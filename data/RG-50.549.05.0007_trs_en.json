        "Q: Okay, this is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Kentucky Oral History\nCommission interview with John M. Rosenberg. We\u2019re at his office in Prestonsburg, Kentucky.\nIt\u2019s August 21\u00b0, 1999. And I\u2019m Arwen Donahue and this is tape number one, side A. We\nalways begin just about the same way, which is with your date of birth and your place of birth.",
        "A: Okay. This is John Rosenberg. I was born in Magdeburg, Germany on October seventh, 1931.\nDon\u2019t remember much about that day. (Laughter.)",
        "Q: Why not? (Laughing.) What was your name at birth?",
        "A: Hans Meinhart Rosenberg, which was changed. And I retained the Meinhart, I mean in this\ncountry we call it Meinhart, I don\u2019t refer to the middle name very often. I think when I got off,\nwhen my family came to this country, the immigration authorities told my mother that most\npeople who were named, most men who were named Hans became John. And so I became John.\nAnd somehow my father was not there at the time, because he said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you name him\nHenry?\u201d But I did not keep the Hans. Some people do keep Hans. There are some Hanses\naround, right?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, that\u2019s where the John comes from. And I have kept the Meinhart. My father actually kept\nthe Israel that Hitler gave him. His name was Rudolph Rosenberg. And you know Hitler gave\nthe men Israel and the women Sarah. And the one thing he retained when he came to this\ncountry, was he called himself Rudolph Israel Rosenberg. Rudolph I., which I don\u2019t think he had\na middle initial from birth.",
        "Q: Meinhart, was that a family name?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it pre-dates me. I don\u2019t think anyone else in the family has it. And my mom asks\nme, do I have any questions when I talk to her, and that\u2019s one question I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever\nasked, is where the Meinhart came from. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the literature. I don\u2019t know, but\nit would be a good question to ask her.",
        "Q: What was her full name, maiden name included?",
        "A: Her name is Gerta Schubach Rosenberg. Her maiden name is Schubach. She was, which her\nfather was a butcher in a town called Idar-Oberstein, which is near Bad Kreuznach, and which\nwe have visited since. And she has still some correspondence with an acquaintance. Well, the\n1\nlast, we went to visit a woman a few years ago, when Jean and I\u2014Jean\u2019s my wife\u2014took Mom\nback to that community. And there was a woman in the next town, which is Oberreidenbach,\nand she was sort of a maid helper in the house. Because my father, her father had a butcher shop\nand her mother had worked, also worked in the store. And I think when they had, traditionally\nwhen they had their meals, it was the three daughters and the parents and all the people who\nworked in the shop. And they did slaughtering on the premises, so they needed help in the\nhousehold. And so she, this woman was still alive. She was in her nineties when we were there\nabout five years ago. But... and I visited that town when I was in the service. I don\u2019t know if\nyou want to do this chronologically, sort of, or how, but...",
        "Q: I think we\u2019ll try to do it chronologically, but allowing for digressions, absolutely.",
        "A: Yeah, well when I was in the Air Force, I was in Germany at one point from 19... I was in\nEngland from 1953 to 1957 with an air resupply group. And our mission was sort of an\nintelligence mission, but we dropped Special Forces in training missions during those days where\nthe Cold War with Russia. And one of our training missions was actually in, we went to\nGermany and the, they attempted to... what they tried to do was set up a situation where they\nwould drop you out of an... if you were dropped out of an airplane behind enemy lines, how do\nyou find your way back and stay out of the way of the bad guys. And the way they did that was\nto take you out in a truck and drop you off one at a time in fairly isolated places. And as they\nwere doing it, I happened to look out in the little slit in the back of the truck and I found myself\nrecognizing the street that my grandfather\u2019s butcher store was on. It was called the\nWasenstrasse. And so we went through this exercise. Took about a week. They identified\ncertain farmers, who were friendly farmers and if you can make your way into that circuit, they\npick you up and give you good meals and you stay out of the way of the bad guys. If the bad\nguys get you, you\u2019re in trouble. But when that exercise was over, I went back to Idar-Oberstein\nand there were still people there who remembered changing my diapers, for example. And some\nof those folks who knew my grandfather and my mother, some of my mother\u2019s contemporaries\nwere still there. And then when I came, that was in like around 1956. More recently when we\ntook, Jean and I took Mom back, it\u2019s probably, oh when we went together it\u2019s probably five or\nsix years, maybe even eight or nine years ago, and we happened to, well we did a sight-seeing\ntour that actually started in... my, Jean\u2019s family\u2019s from, her mother is from Sweden, or her\nmother\u2019s family. We started up there and then we drove and eventually made our way to Idar-\nOberstein and spent a few days there. And while we were there, it turned out that a number of\nher contemporaries were... had this monthly group that got together, and even though they were\nin their seventies and eighties, and they took a, and they\u2019d get together once a month and they\u2019d\nput a little money in a coffee pot and once a year they\u2019d take all that money they gathered and\ntake a trip on the train to some other place. And it happened that while we were there, that was\nthe week they were getting ready to take the big train trip. And so we were able to go to the\nstation when all her own school buddies were there that morning, which was very nice. And we\nmet some other friends of hers, who remembered her. And one fella gave us, he had a picture of\nthe school they went to. But the house, the butcher shop had deteriorated and was no longer\nthere, but some of the neighbors were there. Anyway that\u2019s the tie-in to her community. And\nwe can talk a little bit more about it later.",
        "Q: Were there any Jews left in the town?\n2",
        "A: I think not. We did not... we really did not... our trip wasn\u2019t very long. We stayed in a hotel,\nand we did some sight-seeing and walking around in the area. And most of the people who were\nher age were obviously not Jewish. Her... although he was not a kosher butcher store that he\nhad... as far as I know, we really didn\u2019t run into the Jewish community, any Jews there. When\nwe were in Magdeburg, I mean this is a pretty small town, although now it\u2019s been reconstructed\nand it has some similarities to... the Nahe River runs through the town of Oberstein. And they\ndid an interesting architectural thing. They covered, they have the highway over, they built a\nhighway over the river, which made you, made the streets much more accessible. Because the\nNahe River separated the town of Idar from Oberstein and so it\u2019s called Idar-Oberstein.\nAnyway, in Pikeville, they did this huge cut-through to... because the town used to flood. And\nthey cut the big, made a cut through in the bend of the river and filled that in, much like this\nparticular area, but in a different way. Anyway, Idar-Oberstein is a little, has been rebuilt. I\ndon\u2019t think it was terribly damaged during the war, but it\u2019s sort of touristy. Looks like a little\nSwiss village downtown. And I think if we had stayed there a little longer, we might have made\nmore, a few more connections. The women who, this women\u2019s group, for example, told Mother\nthat one of her boyfriends from school days was now in a nursing home. In fact, it was the\nperson... his name was Hans. And one of the funny stories is my mother decided to name me\nafter him. But he apparently was really failing, was in his nineties. And we didn\u2019t take the time\nand she didn\u2019t feel like she wanted to go to the nursing home. And I think, I think there are\nsome, you know, all the feelings about that place aren\u2019t great, because her family left. I mean\nher father and her two sisters came to this country before, in 1936. They recognized a little\nearlier that they wanted to get out of the country. And I think one of the men who worked for\nmy grandfather took the butcher shop over and he was, himself very... I\u2019ve learned, very\nsympathetic to Hitler and was very much involved locally or never... I don\u2019t know whether he\njust took over the business, didn\u2019t buy it. But I know there was all the family felt pretty badly\nabout that. And some members of my family never want to go back to Germany. Her two\nsisters have never gone back. We did a little bit of exploring. My mother, there\u2019s a small Jewish\ncemetery, my mother had a sister who died, a fourth sister, who died early, either when her\nmother gave birth to her... her mother had been married, her father had married twice. But there\nis the grave of the young child, who either died, was like a month old. And so that cemetery was\nstill kept in quite good condition. I don\u2019t think there was a synagogue there. It\u2019s coming back a\nlittle bit. But we really did not meet any members of the Jewish community and I doubt if there\nare any Jews in Oberstein. Because when we did go, we then went to Magdeburg, my home.\nWe had not been to Magdeburg at all, because it was in the East zone. Hamburg was in the West\nzone and Magdeburg is the next large city down the Elbe River from Hamburg. So when we\nwent back to Magdeburg, they were having, it had been badly bombed in several major raids. It\nwas a town of about three hundred thousand people, an industrial center. We lived in the\nsynagogue, we\u2019ll get to this a little bit later, but we had... and the Russians had renamed all the\nstreets, so they were just starting to rename them back. And so we had a little trouble finding,\ntrying to orient the map to show Mother where we used to live and the synagogue we used to live\nin, where it was. Now there\u2019s just a memorial tablet in the location. There was a big office\nbuilding. But that is gone. But then we, it happened that during the week we were there, they\nhad a memorial exhibit to the Jewish community from Magdeburg in one of the... there\u2019s a\ncloister there. There\u2019s a very large cathedral in Magdeburg, which is fairly famous. And there\nwas actually, the week we were there, they were having a, one of these annual conferences of the\n3\nProtestant gathering in Germany that moves around. All the churches were there and they had\nbooths set up and they had services 1n the main square. And one of the groups there was a group\nthat was trying to promote better relationships between Germany and Israel. And they, they\nwere not Jewish, but that was the mission of this group. And they pointed us in the direction of\nsome people who knew some of the Jewish folks. Again, we went to see this exhibit and I can\nget into that with you a little bit, because one of the exhibits involved, it was a diary written by\nthe person who was the Rabbi in the congregation with my father, who had written a diary when\nthey were picked up to go to the Holocaust museum. I mean to go to the concentration camp.\nSo, this 1s a long winded way of telling you that there, we know there was a Jewish congregation.\nWhen we were walking around the city buildings, and we had this...bumped into this woman\nwho was Jewish or who knew the Jewish... had some connection. And she worked in the city\nhall, worked with the mayor, just happened. And so, it happened when we were walking by that\nthe mayor came out and we spoke to him a little bit. And he said they were just trying, starting,\nhe was interested and glad to meet mother and said the city was starting to put together an event\nlike a lot of other cities had done, to bring the Jewish members of the congregation or for the\nJews from Magdeburg, back to Magdeburg for a kind of gathering and reconciliation sort of\nthing. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happened or she continues to get mailings now from the\ncongregation which is... there was not an active synagogue that we knew of or could find. I\nthink they said there were several hundred families, but we really didn\u2019t go out of our way. I\u2019ve\ngot a book, little brochure at home or here, from that exhibit, which was very touching and very\nnice. Had a huge wall-sized photograph of the inside of the synagogue where my father was the,\nwhere my dad was involved. Anyway there were very few Jews, I think. And it was not an\norganized congregation yet, but we either didn\u2019t bump into them correctly. I mean, we were, it\nwas more of a sight-seeing trip than an effort to dig into records about the congregation sort of\nthing. Because we also had a limited amount of time. And so we got in the car. I had a car and\nwe did drive over to the section where Mother, my dad and my mom first lived, when we came\nthere. I mean, when they first, when my father first married Mother in Idar-Oberstein and then\nthey moved to Magdeburg. It was a small garden apartment kind of place, a little young couple\u2019s\nnew... I\u2019m sure at the time looked very pretty. That area had not been bombed and was still\nthere. It was just much more rundown. I mean it was like going to a building that was 50 years\nold. But the flower boxes were there and we did manage to... you know, we drove by where\nthey probably lived or near where they, in that community. Remarkable for me to see, because\nmy dad didn\u2019t have a car and he bicycled to work every day. People either walked or took bikes\nright into, in the twenties and thirties. I guess he moved to, well I was born in \u201831, so he and\nMother had been married two years. So it was this very pretty little... 1t was kind of like being\nin suburbia and taking a bike, biking into work every day.",
        "Q: Right. Had your father been, you said he met your mother in Idar-Oberstein? Had he been from\nthere or from Magdeburg?",
        "A: My dad was a, he was born in Leer, Ost-Friesland, which is in the northwestern part of Germany,\nnear the Frisian Islands. And I have a family... I was just looking and we have a pretty good\nfamily tree on his mother\u2019s side of the family, going back to the 1700s. His father was a junk\ndealer and he had nine brothers and sisters. He had a large family. And then his father,\nunfortunately, when he was very young, committed suicide.\n4",
        "Q: Your father\u2019s father?",
        "A: My father\u2019s father. Leaving my mother! with this huge, rather large family when they were... I\nthink at that point he was probably like fifteen or sixteen. And so, he went, spent some years in\nan orphanage in Hanover and then went on to our equivalent of college, and to be a Jewish\nschool teacher, which when you think back about it, was quite an achievement. He had an older\nbrother, Sammy, and several sisters. He also had a younger brother, who also committed suicide.",
        "Q: Your father\u2019s younger brother?",
        "A: Yeah, named Meir, who had an affair, I think with a non-Jewish girl, and decided... which was a\nno-no in a big way back then. But he had several sisters, Jetta and Martha, both of whom\nmarried of all things, butchers in the next communities. And they came to this country. One of\nthem is named Dan de Vries. His wife\u2019s name is Martha. They\u2019ve both died in the last ten years\nand their son lives in New Jersey. And his wife is actually the woman who published the coffee\nbook for the Holocaust museum. His name is Alan de Vries. He\u2019d been married before, but\nJudy and he\u2019ve been married for many years. And then he had this other sister, Jetta Van der\nWyck, married Nathan Van der Wyck. They came to this country and had three daughters and\nshe is still living. She\u2019s ninety... She\u2019s kind of failing, but she\u2019s now 90, I guess. Then he had a\nsister Ola*, who was married and went to Argentina and then divorced her husband and came\nback to New York and lived there until she was about fifty and died. And another sister, Lina\u2019,\nwho with her husband went to Israel, early, one of the early settlers in Israel. They moved to a\nmoshav\u2018 in Israel. And they have a son, Moshe, who is my age and whom we have visited. I\nthink that\u2019s all the sisters and brothers. Two of those families came to this country and lived in\nNew York, in the New York area. And both of them were... well, Nathan was a butcher and he\ndied relatively young in this country, while the girls were still growing up. The... Dan de Vries\nlived, well he actually outlived Alan\u2019s mother, but he lived to be about in his eighties. And I\nthink Martha was right around eighty when she died. But my father, you know this large family,\nhis mother\u2019s name was Wexler? before she was married to a Rosenberg. And her father and her\nfather\u2019s father were fairly prominent rabbis in this northern part of Germany. The Wexler\nfamily, that was there. So, there was a very heavy religious influence in my father\u2019s family.\nAnd my dad was very knowledgeable in Jewish law. He knew the five books of Moses by heart.\nYou could start him in the Torah. If you go into the synagogue, the five books of Moses are in\nthe scroll and you could start my father anywhere and he could give you the rest of the passage.\nSo, he was a Jewish school teacher. When he got his degree, he went to Idar-Oberstein I think\noriginally, probably as a practice teaching. But he came there as a young bachelor. And he met,\nto be a school teacher. And... or whether a Sunday school teacher in the Jewish school. And he\nmet my mother, who was a student. She was like sixteen when he met her. I think he had\nanother, I think he had a year of school to go. And he came and he went. He was, she said a\nvery jealous man, when she was still going with some other, this Hans or whatever. And she was\n' JR intended to say that his grandfather\u2019s suicide left his grandmother with a large family.\n2 Married name: Carole Rosenberg\n3 Married name: Lina de Vries\n* Moshav (Hebrew: \u201cSettlement\u201d): Israeli cooperative community that combines privately farmed land and\ncommunal marketing.\n> Married name: Therese Wexler Rosenberg\n5\n18, I guess, quite young, when they were married. Then he took her back to Magdeburg, where\nhe got a position with the Jewish, with the synagogue and the Jewish... it wasn\u2019t the welfare\nagency, but it was like the United, not United Jewish Appeal... sort of like the Central Kentucky\nJewish Organization. He was assisting the, assisted the rabbi as a, not as the cantor, but as the\nlay leader, with services and with classes. And then he also taught classes to people, to Jews\nwho wanted to go to Israel, in Hebrew, and preparing them to go. And I think he wanted to go to\nIsrael, but my mother did not. She wanted to come to this country, if they were going to leave,\nbecause her family was here. And I think my dad really wanted to go to Israel, but they were,\nlike many others, not really, did not think this thing was going to get as bad as it did. So that\u2019s\nwhere he met her and then brought her to Magdeburg in this little garden apartment, this very\npretty, young woman. And then a year later... Mother always likes to kid that I\u2019m a... I don\u2019t\nknow if you realize that people who are born in very early October are often New Year\u2019s Eve\nbabies. They had a big party. Here I am.",
        "Q: Did you, you mentioned about your father\u2019s family being religious. Were you instilled at an\nearly age with a sense of religion, or was there a religious...",
        "A: We were kosher at home. We had, I suppose in Germany a pretty, what would be called, it\nwasn\u2019t Reform, probably like the Conservative American congregation or family. We had a\nkosher household, that meant Mother had two sets of dishes. We had all, we had Sabbath. My\nfather being with the synagogue, went there regularly. And I would go with him. But I was only\neight. I mean I was really young. I went to the... Hitler, you know, in 1936, I believe, started,\nwas when Jewish children could no longer go to school with others. There was a separate Jewish\nschool system. And my father was actually a teacher, then became a teacher 1n the Jewish school\nsystem, in the Jewish school.",
        "Q: After 1936?",
        "A: Yeah, well when I went to school first in nineteen, let\u2019s see I would have been six years old,\nthat\u2019s 1937 when I started. I don\u2019t know if my father had been... I think he\u2019d actually, he must\nhave been a teacher in that school along with being at the synagogue. I think he must have, that\nmust have been his other occupation, that he was actually teaching school already, besides\nworking in the synagogue. Because when I went to the first grade, 1t was in the school where he\nwas teaching.",
        "Q: And what did he do in the synagogue?",
        "A: In the synagogue he assisted the rabbi and was a, he taught these classes and he taught Sunday\nschool classes, taught Hebrew school.",
        "Q: He wasn\u2019t a cantor though?",
        "A: He was not acantor. There is, even in this country, a formal training for cantors. He could be\nthe cantor and I think sometimes he spelled the cantor. And a lot of times, Saturday nights, there\nare at the end of the Sabbath, there are services, which lay leaders lead or when the Rabbi or the\ncantor sit down, somebody else gets up and takes their place for a while. I think my father could\n6\ndo all those things, but his primary occupation was being a teacher in the school system. I\u2019m\njust, as I\u2019m... you know, you don\u2019t always think about these things until you really try to, until\nyou work them through. And so, because his reparation, some of his, I think that part of my\nmother\u2019s social security from Germany is based on his years as a teacher, not just the... not only\nthe congregational status. Though he had probably several years at Oberstein and then\nMagdeburg being a teacher. Except that there was no other place, by that time the schools were\nsegregated. Mother was not working in Germany during, she basically was a housekeeper at\nhome. And did not have anymore formal training after she finished high school. Did we get off\nto some subject on that? You started to ask me something.",
        "Q: Started to ask about religion. I was wondering, did you have much of a religious education?",
        "A: Well, as much as you can get from six to eight. Because we, Kristallnacht was November \u201838,\nso I was just seven years old. I mean I probably had as much as any child would have in those\nearly years. So you learn a lot of the basic biblical stories. You learn Hebrew to read Hebrew.\nBut when we came to this country and my father then went south, which we can get to, I think\nwe became pretty much Reform Jews. I mean because it was so difficult to be kosher unless...\nback then, unless you went to great extremes. Possible to do that in New York. So... I don\u2019t\nknow if you want to talk about how we got there?",
        "Q: How you got to the South?",
        "A: Or what happened in the Holocaust time, itself, that\u2019s about where...",
        "Q: Let\u2019s... I wanted to ask a little bit more about your early childhood. Did you have any siblings?",
        "A: I have two siblings, one of them was born in Germany, my brother, Harry, who is now in Chevy\nChase, who was then...",
        "Q: Chevy Chase, Maryland.",
        "A: Maryland, right. And he\u2019s the head of the Mortality Statistics Section for the National Center for\nVitalstatistics. He\u2019s a demographer. Harry was... he\u2019s four years younger than Iam. And my\nsister, Joan, is in Raleigh, North Carolina. And she\u2019s been an architect for twenty years and then\nwent back to law school. Right now she\u2019s holding her breath to see if she passed the bar. But\nshe was an architect for the state for many years and decided she would go back to law school,\ncould be a lawyer. So, hopefully she will know this week whether she passed the bar or not. But\nmy brother, you know when you\u2019re that age in the early... the only real recollection that I have\nany problem about those early, those years together... .[ mean I have some recollection of having\nbeen at Idar-Oberstein or with some relatives. We went back with my father.",
        "Q: We might want to...",
        "A: You about to switch the tape over?",
        "Q: Yeah, save this for the other side of the tape.\n7",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n8\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape number one, side B.",
        "A: When we, let\u2019s see, what was I talking about? My brother... you don\u2019t have many\nrecollections... I don\u2019t know how much. Do you have brothers and sisters?",
        "Q: Uh huh, I have two brothers.",
        "A: Well, do you remember when you were five and four?",
        "Q: Not a whole lot.",
        "A: Yeah, I remember only the Kristallnacht, that he was out, that he was with my parents, that we\nwere there together. The earlier years, I can remember visiting relatives\u2014as you probably do or\nyou have images of having been\u2014in Leer and playing in my grandfather\u2019s junkyard piles with a\ncousin, for example. Or being in the house, just little things like that. But I really have very\nlittle recollection of my brother and I when we were that age. Or not all, or actually even not too\nmany... four years apart is sort of when you\u2019re always one... often you\u2019re not in the same\nschool. But Harry was, so he was only four years old. We had... oh yeah, when I mentioned\nthere was another sister. My father had another sister, named Mary\u00ae. And Mary was married\nand living in Frankfurt. And that\u2019s where, when, that\u2019s kind of, this is the Holocaust story. I\ndon\u2019t know if you want to ask some more about. I don\u2019t have much else in terms of growing up\nthat I recall, other than where we lived in Magdeburg. We lived in the house that was adjacent to\nthe synagogue, a big courtyard out front. Had just enough of an incline so that my father could\nput me on a bicycle and let me roll down the incline, which he hoped he had taught me to put on\nthe brake on, so I wouldn\u2019t smash into the other side when I was learning to ride a bicycle. The\naddress was Number 2 Schulstrasse. Zwei C, I think, apartment 2C.",
        "Q: Did you spend a lot of time in the synagogue as a child?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Not, I mean, a fair amount, not any, I mean not like an Orthodox child would.\nAlthough I think my father pretty much took me to most services. But it was not a daily. I\ndidn\u2019t go every day, and Orthodox Jews do go everyday. I started school in nineteen... when I\nwas six. And that\u2019s always a very happy occasion. In Germany you begin school by, the big\nevent is you get a large cone, about, almost as big as you are and there\u2019s some pictures. Looks as\nbig as I did. And it\u2019s filled with nice, with goodies, so you celebrate the first day of school.\nCalled a ostertote. I think it actually... I think the school year may have begun or you begin\nschool at Easter time. So, it coincides with Easter, if I remember right. But anyway, there is, I\ndo recall that. And I recall sometime being in my father\u2019s classes and he was a very...did a lot\nof drills. He believed in teaching math with oral drill, \u201cHow much is three times three, four\ntimes four, five times five?\u201d asking kids around the school.",
        "Q: So you were one of his students, from the... Did he start teaching in 1936 or was he teaching\nbefore that?\n\u00a9 Married name: Mary Mescher\n9",
        "A: He was already, he was teaching. I think that he had secured a job with the Jewish school system\nwhen he brought Mother... along with this job at the synagogue. That the two were basically\ntogether. Because he was a teacher. Lehrer. They called him Lehrer Rosenberg, teacher\nRosenberg. So he taught both my mother and me, when you think about it. He was my mother\u2019s\nSunday school and religious school teacher, and I suppose her sisters\u2019. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve got\nsome pictures and I guess her sisters might have been in his classes also. He was a very fine-\nlooking man in his youth. He was a nice looking man later on. But he did have this real store of\nknowledge. But my sister, and as I said, her family went over. And then my, the people, the\nfamily members who were alive, like the two uncles, all those people sort of left around 1936\nand were gone by Kristallnacht, as was my mother\u2019s father, who was in New York. I think my\nfather then, in... my father, we were still living in, we were in Magdeburg the night the\nKristallnacht happened. And that\u2019s what, when I said I remembered my brother, we were\nupstairs in our apartment and my mother and his mother and his brother happened to be visiting\nwith us. Actually my mother said that his mother had come for a visit and been there for several\nmonths. She was still a fairly new... well she had me, but his mother was a very strong,\nassertive woman, both religiously and with her family, and the children really worshipped her as\nfar as I... she was the epitome of a matriarch, that had kept this family going after her husband\nhad committed suicide. She was a very strong woman. And she lived, this is getting ahead a\nlittle bit, into the end, close to the end of the war in a concentration camp. Because my uncle...\nwhich is where my uncle went. But they were visiting with us. And when the Storm Troopers\ncame to the house and rousted us out that night, and they brought us into the courtyard, and\nmother I think thought, she asked somebody whether they\u2019re going to kill us, and he said they\ndidn\u2019t know. And then they...",
        "Q: Is that something that you remember or that your mother told you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. My... she told me that. She didn\u2019t know whether we were going to live or\nnot, live or die. We were all asleep, and they just broke into the apartment and brought\neverybody in the courtyard. And then my... then they bombed, dynamited the Temple, and they\nbrought all the religious scrolls and all the books out into the courtyard and burned them. That\u2019s\nwhat I can remember very vividly, just seeing all that stuff burn up. And then eventually... they\ndidn\u2019t blow the building up. They went in, the next morning when we went in, the upstairs was\nsort of caved in, the upstairs back where the women would sit upstairs. That had been detached\nfrom the walls. They hadn\u2019t totally destroyed the synagogue, but it was quite a mess. But all the\nbooks had been burned. And then somewhere, she said, two or three in the morning they said,\n\u201cGo back into your house.\u201d And the house, things were pretty well upside-down, but it was, they\njust smashed a lot of stuff. And we went back to bed. And then the next morning, early on,\nabout, when it was early, they came back and the military, the Nazis came and arrested my father\nand his brother. Now, I had always... I was just reading some stuff. I always had this\nbackwards, because I thought that my father had... it was interesting, because they arrested Dad\nand they took off. And I don\u2019t have a good recollection of them arresting his brother. Whether\nhis brother and his mother left. Because I know what happened was when they came upstairs,\nthey arrested, they asked for my father and they arrested him. And then my mother asked me if\nshe could, asked the soldier\u2014he had already gone out the door\u2014whether she... when he was\nstanding there, she asked whether she could give him something, make a sandwich for him. And\n10\nthe guy said, \u201cYes, go ahead and do that.\u201d So, she made a sandwich and she asked me to run\nafter them and give my father... and he was, they were already down the street on the sidewalk\nwith my dad in the middle. And I went running after him and gave him the sandwich. And I\ndon\u2019t remember at all that his brother was anywhere around. My mother may know, whether he\ntook his mother back to somewhere else, because he was also arrested and they joined up in the\nconcentration camp. It\u2019s just a little, something I\u2019m not sure of right now. But my mother... I\njust, we were in our kitchen, I think I was on the mattress on the floor, because the beds had been\ntorn up when they came back for Daddy. What had happened, which I thought happened\nafterwards. My father, though, was in the concentration camp about eleven days. They took him\nto Buchenwald, he and his brother. The town we grew up in, Magdeburg, this very large town...\napparently the political establishment was not sympathetic to Hitler. Or a lot of, there were at\nleast a fair number of people in power. And so, with their help, they were able to get my father\nout. And he was ordered to get out of the country within thirty days. He was able to come\nhome. And I have a copy\u2014although I didn\u2019t have it, I mean it\u2019s at home, I recently had it out for\nsome other reason\u2014of the official papers, sending him out, getting him out of the concentration\ncamp. My mother took me to Frankfurt, she said, to my father\u2019s sister. The one whose name is\nMary, that I mentioned a while ago, and my brother. Well, I guess no, she said she took me to\nFrankfurt and that she stayed with friends, not by herself. Different people every night for\nseveral days during that interim. When my father and his brother were released from\nconcentration camp... it must have been at the same time, because I can remember them getting,\ncoming to this apartment. There was a young, my father\u2019s sister had a little boy, had a boy\nnamed Bubi, who was my age. And we played together. And he was the one I played with when\nwe went to see my grandfather at the junk shop. We knew each other. We were just little seven-\nand eight-year-old kids running around together. But I remember being in Frankfurt when my\nfather and his brother came and that they were totally bald. They\u2019d had their heads shaved,\nwhich my father, at that time, had a lot of hair. So it was dramatic to see them, even as a very\nyoung child. And we then, I think Sammy took his mother probably back to Leer and we went\nto...",
        "Q: Sammy is your father\u2019s brother?",
        "A: Right. He was taller than my... was a very outspoken fellow, very active in the Jewish youth\nmovement. Was in his thirties. And he was running the junk, sort of took over the business. He\nwas the oldest son, the oldest one of the children.",
        "Q: I have a couple questions.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When was, I wondered about your father\u2019s and your uncle\u2019s being arrested. Were most Jewish\nmen in Magdeburg arrested? Yeah.",
        "A: I think they rounded up most of... they actually, before they... my father they came for the next\nday. And I think they took off... they arrested hundreds, maybe thousands of Jewish men. And\nit was not yet, I don\u2019t think they were the only ones to get out. I mean, they had help getting out\nof the concentration camp, but I think they had not set on this course yet of genocide. I mean, I\n11\nremember there was this Madagascar Plan about sending the Jews to the Madagascar and getting\nrid of them and basically eliminating them, before they figured out this Final Solution that they\nwere going to kill everybody. It may have been in somebody\u2019s mind. But wait a minute, how\ndid I get on to that? You asked me...?",
        "Q: I asked you about whether Jewish men in Magdeburg in general were arrested.",
        "A: I think there were a lot of, I mean it was a large congregation. Now the other, that was uh... that\ndiary that I was telling you about when we went back to Magdeburg and they had the exhibit of\nall the Jewish artifacts? There was an open diary by, the rabbi\u2019s name was Wilde, WI LD E,\nProfessor Wilde. He was a PhD. It was a large congregation. He had a very prominent role in\nthe community, I think. He started this diary, saying \u201cThere we were. We had all been arrested\nby the police, a banker and a baker and a rabbi and a Rosenberg. And here we were sitting in the\npolice station, all expecting to go home that night.\u201d And I mean, all I could read... it was ina\nglass case, so it just went that far. He ended up going to England. He also got out safely, but he\nwas even older than my father. I don\u2019t know what, I think he just lived out his life in England, in\nLondon somewhere. So, there were a lot of people arrested after Kristallnacht. And how many\nof them... there was a family, there was actually a family living upstairs above us in the\nsynagogue, in this building, like it was just an apartment building, there may have been some\noffices downstairs, but it was perpendicular to the Temple itself, and then there was this\ncourtyard. There was another family upstairs that was Jewish and they were from Poland. And\nthey came and arrested them about, several weeks earlier. And I think that Hitler, that they were\narresting Jews from Poland and shipping them out. I think that was sort of the event probably,\nalthough I\u2019ll never know, you know, that got my father to thinking it was time to get out. And he\nhad thirty days to get out of the country and I always, what I\u2019m going to tell you now 1s I always\nthought he did that after he got out of the concentration camp. But I was reading some notes my\nwife had made, which I suspect happened right after they arrested the Poles, that he said, \u201cWell\nhow am I going to get out of this country? Or how can we do it at this late date?\u201d And he was\ntold to go to the American Consulate and to get a visa and to go to Hamburg. Why don\u2019t I just\nget those notes? I was just looking at them, and I\u2019ll read them. It made a little bit of sense, in\nthat it also had and interest... these were actually from some notes that Jean made when we were\non a plane with my mother a few years ago. And let\u2019s see... yeah, Daddy then, said Opa was\nsafe... he was, let\u2019s see, a teacher in synagogue housing. They, if I have this right, one of the\nreasons Sammy and his mother were there is that they realized that it was getting to be a\ndangerous time and they might have to try to still get out of the country. And so mother said she\nthought that was why their stay was being extended, that they had started realizing they were\ngoing to try to get to the United States. And she said he was on a... they were taking a walk with\nthe family when they ran into an acquaintance, who said to them that if they were going to get\nout it was necessary to go to the U.S. Consulate in Berlin. And my father asked him how to do\nthat and he said, \u201cYou should go to Hamburg in the morning and get in line and book four\npassages to this country. Then when you get those passages, you need to go to Berlin to the\nConsulate to let them know you\u2019ve got your tickets.\u201d\u201d So my father, she said, cashed in his life\ninsurance policy and bought the tickets and got the papers together to get a visa to come to the\nUnited States. He sent the visa application, he said, by registered mail to Berlin. Then he went\nto Berlin and stayed there with his sister Ola and her husband, who was... remember her\nhusband was not Jewish, which was another very... they\u2019re the ones who went to Argentina. So,\n12\nhe went there. So he went there, he went on to the office, but they did not find his papers. He\nshowed them the registered mail stub, which was copied and he was told that he would then get\nthe confirmation of the fact that he would be approved to go to this country. He got a letter,\neventually he got a letter with the number on a piece of paper, which he kept on his person. And\nit said, he gave that piece of paper to Sammy, his brother, when the Gestapo picked him up after\nKristallnacht and took him to the concentration camp. Sammy in turn gave it to his mother, who\ntook me and went to Mary in Frankfurt. So his mother then... what isn\u2019t clear to me, is what\nhappened to Sammy. I suppose they must have arrested him after my father, but I just didn\u2019t pay\nany attention to him because I just wasn\u2019t focused. Because they took him off. Because she\nsaid, it was actually his mother, who took me off to... Mom said, you know, that she took Harry,\nwho was only four at the time and waited around and went from house, lived with different\nfriends in the community while they were waiting for my father. But he had this little\nregistration number, which as you know, probably from other stories, people were selling their\nsouls and lives for, because they were, it was the quota system that determined whether you were\ngoing to make it to this country or not. And we were, we then went, during this thirty-day period\nthey got all their belongings together and filled it in one of these things they call...what\u2019s the\nname of this thing? Where you put everything in a big box that\u2019s going to go to the other\ncountry. And they packed up all their furniture and it was sent to Rotterdam. And they made\ntheir way to Rotterdam, Holland, where we were in this sort of an internment camp. It was\nactually... I think we went on the train and it was a large, overnight hostelry for people who\nwould otherwise have taken, say, the Holland America Line ship. The boat to this country on a\nnormal, as a tourist trip.",
        "Q: Before we leave Germany I want to, I had another question. First about Kristallnacht. You\ndescribed being taken out of your house in the middle of the night by the Storm Troopers and\nthen watching them burn all the Torah scrolls. Was that the first... what do you remember,\npersonally, about that? Was that the first time that you had realized the danger of the situation?",
        "A: I want to believe that I remember the signs on the, some of the signs that said No Jews Allowed,\nwhich you know popped up on stores. And we... the family... but I don\u2019t remember, as a six or\nseven year old having any, you know you just learn what the rules are. Don\u2019t go into this store\nor you stay with your parents or you go to school. I don\u2019t remember children other than my\ncousin. So I don\u2019t know that I ever was afraid. And I don\u2019t think my parents ever gave me any\nreason to be afraid. I mean we lived a very normal life. And I didn\u2019t know, I do remember that\nwe, I played with the kids of that Polish family. They had two children. I think their name\nmight have been Finkelsteiner. They had two children and I remember them. But I don\u2019t... and\nso they were gone. I don\u2019t remember, you know, that we were living in fear, or... until these\nStorm Troopers showed up at the house that I had any conscious feeling about even knowing that\nthings were bad. As I say, in our town there was not a lot of sympathy for him.",
        "Q: So, do you remember that moment of watching the Torah scrolls be burned and being pulled out\nof your house in the middle of the night?",
        "A: I do remember the fire. I mean I do remember going, I do remember, probably because it was so\nvivid. And when I told this story before or talked about it, that it stays a little bit in front of your\nmind, so it\u2019s probably hard to separate. But I have this very strong recollection about this fire in\n13\nthe courtyard. And my father being arrested and running after him. And I just... so those are\nthe, I guess, the vignettes that I remember. I remember them coming to the apartment and my\nmother giving me the sandwich. And I remember that one of them, this fellow who was in\nuniform, who said that she could go ahead and make a sandwich, seemed to be very friendly, or\nwas a very, he said okay and he wasn\u2019t... they didn\u2019t beat any of us, I mean, we... I\u2019m sure the\nadults were very fearful, because they were forced out there. I was just a little kid and everybody\nsaid, \u201cGo outside in the yard.\u201d I mean as I said, my mother certainly was very afraid and they\ndidn\u2019t know what they were going to do. And they did it all over Germany. She told me that,\nMom said at one point that they had heard that was going to happen that night, something like\nthat, that people, that this was... if I, you might know this. I think that they had an excuse for\ndoing it, some official, some German official had been killed and this was an act of retribution.\nIt was the way they got at it. And so, I don\u2019t know that word had spread that this was the night\nthat they said we\u2019re going to synagogues and arrest... blow them up and arrest everybody. But\nthey just, they knew something was going to happen. But they went to bed. They didn\u2019t know\nwhat. I don\u2019t know whether anybody was awake, because we were rousted out.",
        "Q: So do you remember being particularly afraid? No.",
        "A: No. I really don\u2019t have any, any recollection. And all I remember is that I do remember a little\nbit of going to Frankfurt, only because somehow at one point, I remember we were eight years\nold, and my cousin and I were under the table, playing under the table and seeing the knees of all\nthese adults sitting around. I mean, it\u2019s just sort of a goofy thing, but they were also killed. I\nmean almost everybody, this family and this cousin were gassed. Sammy and his mother, we\nstayed... well you wanted to go ahead about Germany. When we get into Holland, [Pll tell you\nwhat I remember about Sammy and his mother. But that\u2019s really about all I remember of those\ndays in Germany. It\u2019s not a... I remember going sometime, vaguely, going back to Idar-\nOberstein as a kid, but not much. I was just too young.",
        "Q: Okay, one more question about Germany, then... you had mentioned, did you mention that your\nfather was involved in some way with helping Jews, who wanted to emigrate to Palestine?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you say something about that? And also did he have any interest, did your parents have any\ninterest in trying to emigrate to Palestine at that time?",
        "A: Well I said my dad, I think, wanted to go and my mother did not. She wanted to go to America.\nIf they were going to leave, she wanted to go to this country, where her family lived. But his\nsister had gone to Israel and I think he... Lina and her husband, whose name was Ivan Van der\nWyck, another Van der Wyck... de Vries. I\u2019m sorry de Vries. And I just actually had sent a\nlittle note to my cousin, when we were... I visited them when I was in the Air Force first, in\n1956, when I was still single and was stationed in England and went to Israel. I stayed with them\nand toured the country. And then when Jean was pregnant with our Michael, we went over. And\nso, we\u2019ve had some connection over the years. And they have a son, Moshe, and his wife, Nurit,\nhave a son, who came to this country and was married a few years ago. And my dad and mom\n14\ndid go to Israel afterwards. In fact Sammy\u2019s widow... Sammy got married in the concentration\ncamp, which we will... can get to or just say, and his wife...",
        "Q: Yeah, you can go ahead and say what camp he was in.",
        "A: Well, he went, I think he and his mother... I mean, we got out. We went to Holland and they did\nnot. Whether he went back to Leer, I\u2019Il have to ask my mom whether... where they went.\nWhether they went to Holland or back to Leer. Because they went to... I think they did\neventually get to Holland and he was supposed to leave on the next boat. I don\u2019t think he was in\nthe camp with us. [ll have to... I might just see where Sammy went, just a minute. Okay, my\nfather had a sister in Frankfurt, was named Elly\u2019. The sister in Rotterdam was named Mary. She\nwas married to a stock broker named Herman Mescher, who spoke a number of languages. They\nhad something like five children. And we would be able to visit with them...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n7 Elly de Levie\n15\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: ...sorry, let me just quickly say, this is tape number two, side A of an interview with John\nRosenberg.",
        "A: I think that it was simply a train trip from Germany to Holland. And they had arranged, it was a\nlegal, they had the papers. They had to be out by thirty days and they had packed everything up,\nexcept a few little, except their day-to-day living clothes and put everything in this big lift is\nwhat they called them, I think. And they expected eventually to send that to this country. As it\nwas, it went to Holland and sat there while they were in the internment camp. And...",
        "Q: Did you all enter Holland illegally?",
        "A: No, I think it was just, my recollection is it was just a train trip and that he had his passport or the\nproper papers to go to Holland. And had been directed to be out of the country in thirty days\nfrom the time he was out of the concentration camp. That\u2019s why I had originally thought he\nwent... that\u2019s when he... I had always remembered that he went to Berlin or that he stood in line\nin Hamburg and in Berlin. This little thing I had read from my wife\u2019s notes, that mother had\nrecalled the other part of it, that he, I think he ended up standing in line for at least a day in\nBerlin at the Consulate to get this number, which was so precious, which ended up being the key\nto allowing us to get out of Holland and coming to this country. But the train, I don\u2019t think there\nwas anything particularly noteworthy about the trip to Holland. They went to Holland. Mother,\nI think, did a lot of the arranging of that while my father was in the concentration camp. Or\nfriends of hers helped her do that, with... and when he got out... I mean, they knew they were\ngoing to have to leave. And they were able to keep this number.",
        "Q: Did they know that they would be staying in this transit camp?",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. I mean they must have... I think that the immigration authorities, the Jewish\nwelfare agencies... I mean they had their... for one thing, he had his tickets. He had purchased\nthe tickets to come to this country, so it was the logical place to go. It was also a place full of\nimmigrants. I don\u2019t know if they put people there who did not have their papers in order or had\nbooked their passage. People had their passages, but they couldn\u2019t leave until they had an\napproval from the authorities in the United States. You had to...you know, they had a quota.\nSo, that was the other part of the... the problem was getting a sponsor in this country.",
        "Q: So everyone in the camp was waiting to come to the United States?",
        "A: Yeah, as far as I know. I mean, whether they were waiting... they were also taking boats to other\nparts of the world, I\u2019m not sure. But that\u2019s what they were waiting to do, was to leave on the\nboat. And I\u2019m not, don\u2019t conscious, have no real recollection of people going ahead of us. We\nended up being there for a year. And, large building like a hotel, and on each floor the\nfurnishings and the layout sort of was equivalent to the class of the boat that you would be going\non. So if you were a first-class passenger you\u2019d have a little... each of these floors, as I\nremember them, had a series of compartments where people would stay, normally for a day or\ntwo before leaving on the boat. So, the first-class cabins would have a little fancier\n16\ncompartment. I mean these compartments weren\u2019t very big. They were like twelve by twelve, at\nleast, small. And then we had, the one that my family had was a very austere, it was, I don\u2019t\nknow if it was equivalent to Daddy\u2019s class, but it was sort of, it was just a very small enclosure\nwith two double beds, with bunk beds. And my brother and I were on an upper and lower and\nmy mom and dad were across from us on an upper and lower and there wasn\u2019t anything else, that\nI can remember, other than maybe a little thing, cabinet to put your clothes in. And then people\ncongregated in other parts of that facility. They had a library, reading room. They had a large\ncafeteria or a large dining room. Huge dining room, where everyone ate at the same, together. I\nalways tell people I remember the sign on the wall said, in five languages, \u201cDon\u2019t spit on the\nfloor.\u201d That was the sign. They had this huge sign. Don\u2019t spit on the floor. My father, so it was\npretty, you know, it wasn\u2019t a great living conditions. But my father\u2019s sister and her husband and\ntheir children lived in Rotterdam. They were Dutch residents. I don\u2019t know where she met him.\nHis name was Herman. I think I mentioned that. And he was a stock broker and they were fairly\nwell-to-do and we could go to see them or they could come to see us. I mean we weren\u2019t, it\nwasn\u2019t any concentration camp. It was just, I think that it was an internment camp and you could\ngo away, go out on weekends. But no one had any vehicles, and unless you had a lot of money,\nwhich they had hardly any money, you basically stayed where you were.",
        "Q: Did they have to, did your family have to pay to stay there and have their meals? Or how did\nthat work?",
        "A: I think it was all, I mean they had a little, they didn\u2019t... now my father... I don\u2019t recall that\nanybody had to work. I can ask Mom. I don\u2019t think so. I mean I think it was run by the Jewish\nWelfare Agency.",
        "Q: The whole camp?",
        "A: Yeah, I mean I think there was a relationship there. Maybe it was a relationship to the Holland-\nAmerica Line. It might have been that it was, someone or the immigration authorities people. I\ndon\u2019t recall, but I can ask. I don\u2019t think that Mother worked in the kitchen, for example. It\nwould be nice to know. We\u2019ve never talked very much about that. But my father decided to\norganize a school for the children in the camp and he did that.",
        "Q: Completely on his own?",
        "A: On his own, yeah. He said, I want to do that for the kids. And so he started a school and gave\ninstruction for a year, while we were there. We had to, he or the people, his sisters who were\nhere and some others set about trying to find a sponsor in this country. And they ultimately\nfound someone who was a fairly well-to-do person, \u2018cause none of his family had any money to\nspeak of and they couldn\u2019t vouch for... they were not citizens, so they couldn\u2019t vouch for him.\nSo during that year they found a sponsor for him, a fellow who was either an architect or a\nbuilder in New York, who my father went to see after we got here and said thank you, and that\nwas the last contact, except that in later years, my brother has met the son of that person, who\nlives in Washington, also.",
        "Q: Do you know his name? The name of the father and the son?\n17",
        "A: I think his name is Meyer, Andrew Meyer. Does that ring a bell?",
        "Q: No, I started to chuckle, because I said the name of the father and the son, and just almost said\nthe Holy Ghost. (Laughter.)",
        "A: Oh, oh. No, but it turns out... his name is Meyer and it turns out that, that...that his father, that\nthis Meyer, who was our sponsor, that his family and our family come together in the seventeen\nhundreds with a family connection named Budenweiser, which led me to think they actually\nidentified someone who was very distantly related. There are some Meyers in our family. And\nmy brother ultimately figured out and I think that David, this fellow, Meyer, the son, that there\nwas a family connection, a couple of hundred years back. So there is a relationship. Probably\nsomebody said, why don\u2019t you go see so-and-so, we don\u2019t have very much to do with him, but\nmaybe he\u2019d sponsor your father. That someone contacted him, Hans Meyer. They knew that he\nwas there. He was well-off, but very distant family. And he agreed to sponsor my family.",
        "Q: Was this part of the hold-up, that you didn\u2019t have a sponsor in the U.S. ?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know why we were there a year. I think part of it, no we were not... I think part of it was\nthat we were not very high up on the list. That there were others in front of us by a long way. In\nfact my father was, we went in that camp probably in... Kristallnacht was November and Dad\nwas there until the end of November, and then December. We probably went to Holland in\nDecember-January. And we came over on the boat in February 1940. That was just before the\nwar broke out with Holland. In fact, we were either on the last boat or the next to last boat. And\nmy dad had already been told that he was going to be the school teacher either in Theresienstadt\nor in the camp that Anne Frank was sent to, the first, the concentration camp.",
        "Q: Westerbork?",
        "A: Westerbork, right. He was going to be the teacher. They wanted him to start that school. And\nhe said, I\u2019m... want to go to America. And he then, there was a fellow... that\u2019s in these notes as\nwell, \u2018cause I keep forgetting the name. He said that as time was growing short, he went to the\nJewish Immigration Agency to find out whether, the hold-up. Because he was not near the top.\nAnd when he got there, he met a fellow named Doctor Moses, who was one of the interview,\ncommittee interviewing people. And he and Doctor Moses... in Germany, he had helped Doctor\nMoses solicit money for Israel. And Moses recognized my father. And my dad... and then he\narranged for us to be on one of the next boats. So, it was a little \u201cgood old boy\u201d. And, but I\nmean we had been there a year. I think there were a lot of those stories that also... that 1t was a\nnumbering system from the top to the bottom, but that if you paid someone, or you always heard\nof, there were probably people moving up that had some influence with whoever. And so, my\nfather said, managed to get this connection or lucked into this connection. Whether he was\nmoved up or he would have been on that boat, I don\u2019t know. But because they were apparently,\nwhat they were doing was interviewing family... they had a committee on which this Doctor\nMoses sat, and he... they determined who was going to go. Because there were probably all\nsorts of priorities. Are they elderly? Do they have... how do you... we\u2019ve got a whole building\nof people who need to go to the United States and the boats only hold so many and somebody\n18\ncan go and somebody can\u2019t. This is my number. And we have a lot of little children. So I think\nhe was able to, that\u2019s what happened. Whether he pulled some strings or whether he just was in\nthe normal course of things and said, you can go. But whatever it was, that\u2019s how we got here.\nSo his number, he still had that little piece of paper and they\u2019d found a sponsor. And so we were\non that last boat, I suspect.",
        "Q: So it was very, very fortunate. If you hadn\u2019t gotten onto that boat, you wouldn\u2019t have gotten out.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s for sure. Yeah, that\u2019s for sure, we would not have gotten... no there wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen any other way. And I don\u2019t think there was any chance of going anywhere else. My uncle\nand his mother, again, I\u2019m not sure why I don\u2019t remember that they are there. But apparently\nthey were on another boat. They came, they were in fact on a boat that was then turned... I think\nthat you go through England. I have some recollection as a young boy, you know, you\u2019re\nplaying on the boat. People, everybody\u2019s always looking for mines. There were all sorts of\nmines floating out in the English Channel, because the war was about to start. And there was a\nroute that you could make and we went. And I remember looking for the mines or looking and\npeople say, there\u2019s something out there. I believe they were in fact on a boat and that the boat\nwas turned around and they got off. Now, whether they were in this same camp or somewhere\nelse, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know why I would not have remembered them being there, but I\u2019 Il\nhave to ask. I\u2019m just not sure.",
        "Q: And they both did not survive the war?",
        "A: No, what happened was they went from there to Theresienstadt. You have the right word for\nHolland, it was Westerbork. I always forget that. Theresienstadt. And they were there. My\nuncle Sammy apparently was in charge of the leather-working shop. They made boots and\nrepaired leather stuff. And they were there into, they were there in 1944. And apparently my\nuncle became a little outspoken. The war was turning and they knew that. And he made some\nuntoward remarks about the Nazis, about these shoes are too good for them or something. And\nsomeone told on him and he was sent to Auschwitz. And he was in the line to go, to be\nexterminated and he ran to the electrified fence and they shot him. We heard that from, I think,\nhis wife. During those four years, three years that he and his mother were in Theresienstadt, he\nmet his wife and they were married. And when I was with mom last weekend, we have pictures\nof their wedding, of them getting married on the day they got married. I mean of their wedding\nor they\u2019re being married. She wasn\u2019t wearing... she was an adult. They were in their thirties.\nHe was probably born in 1900, so he was forty years old. They were both forty. She was a\nlovely person. And they were married. You know they all had coat... he had a coat and a tie on.\nAnd some of their friends are around them in a picture. This was the end of *44. And his,\nDaddy\u2019s mother died, I think, must have died right after he was moved to Auschwitz. I looked it\nup, I mean it\u2019s like a couple, a few months apart. She was, hadn\u2019t been doing well, but she was\nborn in the eighteen... I mean she was probably in her seventies, I think. I\u2019ve got that in the\nother room. We looked up the book, the Gedenk\u00ae book where she\u2019s listed. But she had survived\ninto the late forties and he, with, being with her son. And so, she was there when he got married,\nwhich was nice. And... but then when they moved him to Auschwitz, she died. And then we...\n\u00ae Gedenk bukh: memorial book (Yiddish)\n19\nhis widow lived, and went to Israel. And Jean and I visited her in Israel. And that\u2019s where this\nsort of, I mean that\u2019s what she was told happened to Sammy. She knew that he had been taken.",
        "Q: I had a couple of questions about your time in the camp, at least one question. So when you\nwere staying in the camp in Rotterdam, you were presumably one of your father\u2019s students. Do\nyou remember what the school...?",
        "A: Well, it was just he brought these kids together of varying ages around a big table. It was just a\nlittle sectioned-away room, for I don\u2019t know how many hours. And you\u2019d do your math tables,\nand he\u2019d tell you some stories. He was just teaching. My father had a habit when he, in\nGermany I always remember that when he was teaching Bible stories, he would always tell you\nthree-fourths of the story and leave the ending for the next week, so that you were anxious to\nfind out what was coming. I don\u2019t really remember very much about school, except where it\nwas, and I remember there was, I was, one of the people who was there had a violin that he\nplayed and gave violin lessons. And I think my parents thought that would be a good idea. So\nhe loaned me the violin for a lesson, but I remember that I was not very good. And he got his\nviolin back. I think he thought it was going to... might be untuned or leaving it with an eight-\nyear-old was not the right thing to do. And I don\u2019t really remember very much about the camp.\nI remember a little bit about the library and where the books were. And the older people would\nsit down. They had a radio.",
        "Q: How many students were in the school together?",
        "A: There were probably forty or fifty with us. And whether he did it in shifts or not, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Did you all have to share bathrooms with a bunch of other people?",
        "A: Well there were no, yeah, I mean you had communal bathrooms on each floor, because there\nwere no... I don\u2019t know if the first-class facilities had private baths. This room where we were\nthey had a little sink, I think, with running water, but they didn\u2019t... the bathroom as such was\ndown the hall. It was pretty spartan. I mean it wasn\u2019t terrible because it wasn\u2019t... you weren\u2019t\nunder a guard. But it was, it was very plain. And then when they found, when they got ready to\nleave, they learned that they could not... there was a limit on what they could take out. It was\nlike twenty-five or fifty dollars. And so all the stuff that they were going to take... my mother\nreally doesn\u2019t remember what happened to it. It stayed. She was able to bring over some linens,\nsome crystal, which she still has, and some mementos, several boxes of stuff, things that they\ncould pack up. But no furniture, which they had brought from Germany and things like that.\nThey just either sold them for a very, for a song...",
        "Q: Did your dad teach all the lessons in German?",
        "A: I think he did, yeah. German and perhaps some Hebrew. Of course, I don\u2019t know why anybody\nwould have just spoken...But it would have been... I don\u2019t know that he knew any Dutch. When\nhe came to this country really the only other language that he knew was German. He knew some\nbroken English that he had learned. Mother didn\u2019t know any English. I remember when we\nwere on the boat, I remember, I told people I saw the Wizard of Oz was playing. Was the first\n20\nAmerican color movie, you know, technicolor movie, sound, Judy Garland. I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand the English, but I saw the... they showed the Wizard of Oz on the boat. I\u2019m sure it\nwas a nice boat trip. I mean for us, that was kind of fun, just a little kid running all over the\nplace.",
        "Q: What happened to your uncle and family in Rotterdam?",
        "A: They were... they didn\u2019t get out. They were also killed. I don\u2019t know if they went to\nWesterbork. I tried to, Mother and I looked for his name in that book. We were in, when we\nwere in Magdeburg... after we went to Magdeburg on that trip I was telling you about, we went\nto Berlin for sightseeing and to look around, and we found a Jewish library there in connection\nwith the synagogue or with the agency and they had one of these Gedenk Books where all the\nHolocaust victims were listed alphabetically. So, that\u2019s where I saw my uncle and my mother. I\nlooked for some of...",
        "Q: Your uncle and your grandmother?",
        "A: My grandmother. And I don\u2019t remember that I... I think we looked for some of the others and\ncouldn\u2019t find them. Hermann... they were, all of that family was killed, the one in Rotterdam.\nThe family in Frankfurt was killed. The sister that was living actually in Berlin, went to\nArgentina and then up here. And as I say, mother\u2019s, I mean my father\u2019s mother, because my\nmother\u2019s family had come, already come to this country. When we came to the United States,\nthey were there to greet us. Her two sisters, one of whom I think... well neither of them were\nmarried at that point. But they were all living on, with my grand, with mother\u2019s parents.\nMother\u2019s parents had come over and my grandfather who owned a butcher shop was working as\na butcher in a large restaurant in New York. And he had gotten a job and was maintaining the\nfamily.",
        "Q: Was he a kosher butcher?",
        "A: No, he, no. And it was not a... it was called, I think the restaurant was called Zimmerman\u2019s\nHungaria. I think it was a Hungarian restaurant. I think he could be, I mean he knew what there\nwas to know, but he wasn\u2019t a kosher butcher in Germany. Then he went, they went to the\nsynagogue, this was 803 West 180\" Street, right across from the George Washington Bridge.\nBig neighborhood of German immigrants in those days. It\u2019s changed a lot. A lot of Spanish-\nspeaking people living there now, along with a few of the... some have actually... well, I was\nwith Mother... one of her friends, who lived downstairs, is still in that same building, called her\nto wish her a happy birthday. At 803 180\" Street. Her sisters came to the boat and we moved in\nwith them initially. Just squeezing into an apartment. It was a fairly good-sized apartment. But\nwe lived with them. And at that time, there was not a very good, for some reason, there was no\none that really told my dad what he ought to do is get his teaching degree for this country and\nlearn to speak English and to go on with what he was doing. Or if they told him, he didn\u2019t think\nhe could quickly take care of his family. And there was very little work in New York. Most of\nthe jobs were cleaning for women or people were doing stuff at home. There was an enormous,\nwhat do you call it, craft kind of stuff, they give you... my mother and her sisters would sit\naround sewing slippers together, the bottoms and tops of bedroom slippers, piecework, to make\n21\nmoney. Mom was actually a maid. She\u2019d go out and was cleaning apartments, cleaning houses,\ndoing a little bit of nannies. My father after a very short time, heard that there were jobs in the\nSouth and he went to Spartanburg, South Carolina and started sweeping floors in a textile mill,\nso he could take care of his family. So he went to Spartanburg and got a job, through... I mean\nhe got a job, he knew where he was going. Somebody had said, contact this man when you get\nthere. So, it was a very menial job initially and then he... he swept floors and he did manual\nstuff and pretty quickly learned how to... he became a shift manager at one point and he brought\nus, he had saved his money and got a small apartment, and about six months later we moved to\nSpartanburg, South Carolina.",
        "Q: Before we go on, do you remember anything else about your journey to the U.S.?",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I mean the boat, just that it was a boat trip and we were... it was a big ship. And a little\nkid could run all over the boat. And I remember the Wizard of Oz.",
        "Q: What about arriving? Did you arrive at New York harbor?",
        "A: We came through New York. We did not, for some reason, go to Ellis Island. I\u2019m not sure,\nbecause I think... because our family came to meet us and we went on. Recently I asked my\nmom if we went to Ellis Island, \u2018cause I didn\u2019t remember that, us doing that. And I think my\nfather was... we all went off and the name change must have actually taken place while he\nwasn\u2019t around. Because he might have... even when the paper stuff was done, he had already\ngone to Spartanburg. It said Hans is no longer Hans. Your son\u2019s name is John. But the flags\nwere out when we came. We landed on February 22\"! when we passed the Statue of Liberty.\nAnd so we thought this is really nice, they\u2019ve got all the flags out for us, but it was Washington\u2019s\nbirthday. So I mean, and I remember my aunt giving me a quarter and telling me that was a lot\nof money and I should hang on to it, very, very carefully.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you felt at the time?",
        "A: No. I mean I think you\u2019re kind of, you\u2019re in wonderment. I mean all of sudden you take a boat\ntrip and there\u2019s the Statue of Liberty and then you come up with your family. You\u2019re glad to see\nyour family, because you\u2019ve known them. It\u2019s been a few years since... they had been over\nsince \u201836, I think, \u201837. So they were, let\u2019s see, Mother was born in 1908 and she\u2019s the oldest. So\nIrma and Ruth\u2019 were just eighty, so they were, I think they were born, that would make it about\n1920. So they were in their early twenties when we met them. I think Ruth became, went\nthrough dental hygiene school and I don\u2019t know that Irma was just working in various places.\nThey both met their husbands in the next few years. One of, Irma\u2019s husband was Jewish and\nthen they both went into the service, I think. John and Walter. Walter was a baker and the...\nJohn was a salesman. And I went... they enrolled me in a school called P.S. 132 and they put\nme in a class with kids from other countries. All the early...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n? Irma Haas and Ruth Neumeyer\n22\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: ...the children from other countries and I don\u2019t know how one teacher handled them. I think\nthey taught you some basic English.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t speak any English.",
        "A: I spoke no English. You pick it up pretty quickly on the street playing with other kids. And I\nstayed in that room. It\u2019s funny, because now, you know, they have the dress code that\u2019s going\non. At least one day, on Thursdays you had to wear red, white and blue. It was red, white and\nblue day. And that was all new to me. But they had some codes. But I think I did pretty well\nand adjusted with these other kids. I walked to the school, it was probably three-quarters of a\nmile, every day, from where we lived to the school. And after, I remember after maybe a couple\nof months, I was sort of mainstreamed into another, into the regular... what would that have\nbeen, probably the third grade, second or third grade and I was there. And then we moved to\nSpartanburg. My father had rented a small walk-up, in a poor... 1t was not a very well-to-do\nneighborhood. But a little apartment that he could afford. Actually he had saved enough money,\nhe said, to have bought a car, but they decided to buy furniture or something. But he worked in\nthe shirt factory doing fairly menial work initially, as I said. Then unfortunately after a few\nmonths, he had an... he fell off a ladder, which was interesting, because in this apartment where\nwe lived, we had just a couple of rooms, two or three rooms. My mother did the laundry on a\npotbellied stove. So, she had relied on him to always pick up this big vat of clothes and laundry\nand put it on. We had this little wood burning stove and burned corn cobs and I suppose coal.\nAnd she\u2019d boil the clothes and wash them the old-fashioned way. And when he broke his foot,\nhe couldn\u2019t do that. As a result of that, he went downtown and we had the first Bendix automatic\nwasher. This little immigrant family in Spartanburg, South Carolina had one of the very first\nautomatic washing machines in 1941. Neighbors would come in to look at it and see the clothes\nspinning round and round and round. And Daddy bought it on time, you know, you could buy...\nI mean he was making not a lot of money. But we used that washing machine for many years.\nUntil even when we went to Gastonia, it just kept on working. It was called, I remember it was a\nBendix. But my father also then, 1t was very interesting in our little apartment, \u2018cause he... there\nwas no rabbi in Spartanburg and so he... I don\u2019t know if they ever had one before the war,\nwhether they just got... I mean the Jewish community learned right away about his vast\nknowledge of Jewish culture and religion and that he could actually officiate at a service. And so\nhe began officiating in Spartanburg and started writing sermons in English. And did the whole\nthing, I mean he was quite remarkable. And as a result of that, the Jewish soldiers... there was a\nmilitary base in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Camp Croft. And so the soldiers, the Jewish\nsoldiers who would sometimes come to the synagogue and see Daddy, would come to our little,\npoor apartment on weekends. And on the porch... and we have little pictures with a Brownie,\nblack and white that were taken of all these soldiers sitting out on the porch or out front on a\nSaturday afternoon, because it was a place to go. Because they didn\u2019t know anybody. They\nwere away from home. It was just kind of ironic, right, that you\u2019ve got... and I\u2019m sure the rest\nof the Jewish community was also very fond of them, but they came to Mom and Dad because\nthey were new in the community and very warm. I don\u2019t know whether they realized that this\nimmigrant family had come to Spartanburg, South Carolina and were totally in a new\nenvironment. I mean it\u2019s always been, I\u2019ve always thought it\u2019s been very remarkable when you\n23\nthink about it. I mean, they didn\u2019t stay in New York, where people spoke German. I mean my\nmother and her sisters sort of still speak German. She has an accent. But they came South and\nhere\u2019s my dad, writing sermons and officiating when he\u2019s not in his fairly menial job at the\nfactory. Then somehow the congregation in Gastonia, North Carolina, which was about seventy-\nfive miles away, I think, also had no rabbi. And he got to Gastonia, because there was a family\nnamed Heilbronn, who were in Magdeburg, who were... that they knew in Germany. And that\nfamily, the Heilbronns, had owned a textile mill. They were very well off. And they had\nbrought their whole, their manufacturing facility over and they were living near Gastonia. So, I\nthink they contacted Dad to see if he couldn\u2019t start helping them with services. And so my dad\nstarted commuting between Spartanburg and Gastonia and officiating at services in Gastonia.\nAnd so after a couple of years, Daddy in the shirt factory, let\u2019s see, in Spartanburg the place he\nworked was called, yeah... Dixie Shirt Factory is the mill where he went to work. He started\nmoving up a little bit and became a shift manager and a foreman. And learned essentially how,\nthe textile knitting business, totally something he\u2019d never done in his life. Never knew anything\nabout it. And became very good at it. And so, several years later, the family in Gastonia asked\nDad or Mr. Heilbronn asked him if he wouldn\u2019t come to work for him as a, I think as a shift\nmanager. And then he also, when he got to Gastonia... and he invented, made some innovations\non the machinery in their dye house. But after Spartanburg... so we lived in Spartanburg about\nthree years. And it was, you know, people were, of course, very nice to us, but... and I started\nreally a public school in Spartanburg, both my brother... and my brother, let\u2019s see, I was then, I\nwould have been, let\u2019s see in 1940 I would have been nine. So we were in, I was like in the\nfourth, fifth and sixth grade. And I was kind of a novelty, obviously, immigrant son. And\npeople would ask questions about how it was on the boat. So, the classrooms would start\nscheduling me around as a speaker to other schools, because they had this little ten-year-old, who\ncould talk about life in Germany and coming over on a boat and being Jewish.",
        "Q: So, did you talk about the plight of the Jews in Europe?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I did. I mean, I essentially told, I think, told much of this story from the perspective of\na ten-year-old. If somebody had taped it, I\u2019m sure there were more details that I don\u2019t even\nremember, but it was, you know, it was sort of novel having somebody... there was nobody else\nthere. And I was still probably speaking, well in Spartanburg certainly, spoke broken English. I\nalways remember when the first report card came out with all these numbers. I said, well, what\nare these numbers? When my parents wanted to find out what is this report card, with very good\ngrades. They were like nineties and things like that. you know. And they didn\u2019t know the first\nthing about socialization. They didn\u2019t know that when kids had parties, or you go to somebody\nelse\u2019s house. Everything was different. The conventional things that you grow up with, the\nbooks, the stories, the Alice in Wonderland. The children\u2019s books in this country are totally\ndifferent. So some of that was lost, but I thought they did remarkably well and we had a lot of\nvery nice friends. And I thought the teachers were very welcoming. I still remember some of\nthose teachers. And the community was very accepting. The Jewish community was pretty\nwealthy by and large, because most of them were store owners, as they tended to be. By that\ntime, all lot of them all, like so many others in these smaller Southern towns, their fathers and\nmothers had come to the South, to these communities, selling rags or generally as salespeople.\nAnd then a lot of them decided to stay and built, opened stores. And the war years were fairly\nrecent, so most of them were retail merchants. And some of them were like Heilbronn... there\n24\nwere several factory owners, who were very well-to-do. So, there really... people, most of the\nkids were from much more well-to-do homes and I think to some extent, that\u2019s why so many of\nour own associations, we were always very comfortable with working people, who were not\nnecessarily Jewish. When you\u2019re living really in a Protestant environment in the South. So, I\ndon\u2019t know that we were ever conscious, for example, to the same degree of anti-Semitism to the\nextent that it existed even then. It was never a problem. We never, my parents were not in the\ncountry club set, so they didn\u2019t have to worry about whether they could get in to the country\nclub. But...",
        "Q: Was your lack of socialization a problem at all or did you, were you, did you really feel\nconfident enough that it didn\u2019t affect you?",
        "A: Oh, I think it went very well. I mean, my folks were very permissive about... and I think I\ntended to... the friends that you made in those years, tended to be either in your neighborhood\ndirectly, and there were a few kids that were in the neighborhood that you played with, and then\nchildren, your friends were also, friends who did well, if you were making good grades. The\nkids you hang out with or that you learn and then their parents hear about you. So I spent some\ntime in those years, it was a little more... probably it was more middle-classy than my parents\nwere. Kids whose homes were a little better. But I think it went pretty well. I didn\u2019t play any\nball really until I was really... we played marbles, we played capture the flag. I got into scouting\nin a big way. And when we went to Gastonia, we moved to Gastonia then and I went into the\nseventh grade and my brother was in the third grade. And in the, I think in the seventh, in the\njunior high school I developed a lot more confidence. And I think by the time I was in the eighth\ngrade I was president of the class. In high school I was president of the class in my, I think my\nsophomore and my senior years. I became pretty Americanized. I was very involved in\nscouting, which was a great help, and in some other civic stuff. And I worked after school. I\nthink what gets you off the ground... when I was twelve, I think, you could start at twelve, I had\nmy first newspaper route. And started delivering papers for the... actually I think I may have\ndelivered papers in Spartanburg. I think I delivered the Spartanburg paper just the last few\nmonths before we left, on a bicycle. My parents bought me a bike and that was a big deal to get\na bicycle. It\u2019s interesting it was a big deal to buy... I got a fountain, the first fountain pen. They\nbought me a fountain pen, when I was in fourth or fifth grade. That was a big thing. They really\nnever... they spent all their money, I mean to the extent that they had any money left it was\nalways for the kids, either little gifts like that, I mean we\u2019d... and you didn\u2019t have television in\nthose days, and you didn\u2019t have... you had a radio. Dad didn\u2019t get a car. We actually, the\nfamily, there was another family living in our building, that had a son, who was our age, who,\nand I remember we drove to Tryon, North Carolina and saw Sergeant York, you know, the\nmovie? Did you ever see the movie? Gary Cooper. It\u2019s a wonderful picture. He was a war hero\nin the First World War or Second? He was from Kentucky, from Tennessee. It was a Gary\nCooper movie. It\u2019s a marvelous picture. He was a pacifist, who enlisted and became the\nCongressional Medal of Honor winner and then came back home. He was a marksman from\nshooting wild turkeys, is where he learned to shoot. But then one week it was on, and when we\nreturned it was Pearl Harbor Day, it was December seventh, 1941, when we went with the\nCarver family to that movie in Tryon. But it was, you know, I think that\u2019s part of our heritage.\nAs some people would say, we were poor and didn\u2019t know it. There was always plenty of food\n25\nand my dad was very involved in the Jewish community there and subsequently in Gastonia. But\nthose early years, when you think about it, we had such an enormous adjustment to make.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you about that. It seems that, well I\u2019ve heard other people talk about arriving\nin New York and there being a lot of encouragement for Jews who were immigrating to go to\nvarious other parts of the country. And so many people just didn\u2019t want to do that and felt so\nstrongly about that, that they stayed in New York even though there was no economic\nopportunity at all. And I guess this is more of an observation than a question, but your dad\nseems to have been somebody who was very open-minded and aware of opportunities, and that\nprobably shaped your life a lot, too. I mean, being a child in a situation where you experienced\nthis extreme disadvantage through having your childhood interrupted so much, and then having\nyour family really be broken apart, and many of them killed. But for you to be able to arrive in\nthis new place and be kind of honored for who you are and what your history is... it\u2019s kind of\ndifferent than what Jewish kids in New York, who were immigrating were experiencing for the\nmost part, it seems to me. There were so many immigrants, and so many survivors and people\nwho weren\u2019t really overall encouraged to talk about what had happened to them.",
        "A: Well yeah, I mean, I suppose that going... I don\u2019t know why my Dad did not explore a little\nmore about the teaching. I don\u2019t know that, whether, how he felt New York... we were living in\na very crowded place and I think he wanted to get us out of there. Because that apartment, big as\nit was, had my mother\u2019s parents, and her two sisters. And we sort of were just, they would just\nlet us live there. But I don\u2019t think he wanted to stay there. So he set about pretty early trying to\nfigure out what he could do and how to earn a living basically and bring money home, enough.\nAnd that New York City, whether he felt too hemmed-in there, or there just really wasn\u2019t very\nmuch for him to do, because he couldn\u2019t be a teacher, he couldn\u2019t be a rabbi, and he couldn\u2019t\nget a job. There were so many people looking for work, as you say, and it was this immigrant\nsituation. But it did, I\u2019m sure, shaped my life, from the time we went South. But I think, I don\u2019t\nknow that he always... I mean, you know, they had a very strong work ethic. My parents have a\nstrong work ethic. And so they encouraged me or were not opposed to seeing me have a paper\nroute at a very young age. And then, I mean that\u2019s a very liberating experience. I always tell\npeople, I remember getting up at five in the morning, and going out to get the paper and then\ngoing by the coffee store and putting that nickel down on the lunch counter and saying, \u201cI\u2019d like\na cup of coffee.\u201d (Laughing.) I mean I was probably not much higher than the stool. But you\nknow when you have a newspaper route and you start putting a little money in your own\npocket... So I always had a job of one sort or another. I mean my parents just didn\u2019t have any\nextra money to... and we knew that, because we knew how they lived. Whether there might\nhave been small, I guess there might have been a small allowance at one point, but after that\nnewspaper route, I delivered papers at home for a while and then I started... I was telling Reva!\u00ae\nhere the other day, my fiscal director, I hadn\u2019t thought about it, somebody downstairs was, some\nof these people sell Home Interiors, and they do lot of, sell things. I was always selling things,\nwhen I was thirteen, I started selling stationery and greeting cards around the, knocking on doors.\nHad a little... within a year I had a little business. Had a whole room full of stationery and\ngreeting cards for all occasions. And then I was going to the factory owners and selling\nChristmas cards to businesses. Then I started working in town after school for the Jewish\nmerchants. I was always working, doing some kind of work. And it didn\u2019t really get in the way.\n'0 Reva Trusty\n26\nI mean, but kids...people... all of those experiences help you appreciate the way other people\nlive, especially working people. Women you worked with back then, and their families, and\nmoney\u2019s tight and how you make it and don\u2019t make it, and so you have an appreciation for that.\nAnd my mom and dad, my mother was basically always worked at home. She never worked. I\nmean, she was a very traditional mother, in that she was a housekeeper and cooked, did the\ncooking. And later on, I think, when my brother and my sister is ten years... my sister was born\nin 1946!'. So she\u2019s fifteen years younger than I am, eleven years younger than my brother and\nwas not initially expected, I think. But Mom, after my sister was born, a few years later, she\nfinally became, decided she wanted to work, and became a sales lady in one of the large\ndepartment stores, where she worked for a long time. And I think it did a lot for her, she had\nnever worked in any store. But she\u2019s a very warm, very outgoing woman and was everybody\u2019s\nbuddy. And so, she was a very good salesperson, but it was a new experience for her. I think it\nwas an enormous adjustment for her. And really for Dad. And so when I, I think... anyway,\nscouting, during the... we were a little, I suppose people, where else in the South, when you\nthink about it, with this history, being, having people recognize you, elect you to be president of\nthe class or something was quite a nice thing. But I think scouting, and scouting did a lot of that.\nI became an Eagle Scout, and was a counselor in a scout camp for several, in the summers for\nseveral years, very close to the scout executive. In fact, he... this 1s really kind of off the subject,\nbut it\u2019s interesting when we say how things affect your lives. The scout executive in Gastonia,\nmarried a woman, who was a Cherokee Indian. He was a, his name was Schiele. He was a park\nranger for much of his life, and then he got into scouting. And he also, during his ranger days,\nlearned to stuff, to make, he was a taxidermist. He amassed a large collection of animals that he\nhad mounted. And his wife collected, and together they also collected a lot of Native American\nthings, since she was a Cherokee Indian. And when we were, in the summer in our camp we put\non a large Indian pageant every Thursday night. The pageant of Hiawatha. I was Hiawatha for\nseveral years and my brother was Minihaha. They\u2019d put a wig on him and I would paddle a\ncanoe in the lights at night and bring him up. But Bud Schiele, when he retired, he gave this\ncollection to the town of Gastonia and said, I'd like to start a little museum here. So, he gave\nthat collection and began a natural history museum, which today is about a square block. He\u2019s\nno longer there, but they\u2019ve developed this wonderful museum of natural history with outdoor\nwalking trails and some really beautiful... 1t\u2019s quite remarkable in the sense that it\u2019s also twenty\nmiles from Charlotte, which has a very large science museum. But the point I\u2019m getting to, is\nthat after, when I was at, later went to Duke University, I was a chemistry major before I was a\nlawyer. We can talk more about that if you want to. I\u2019ve always had an interest in science and\nin this region here, we are behind, I mean educationally we\u2019re still behind. We\u2019ve caught up.\nBut I\u2019ve always had an interest, as much as a result of that experience and seeing Bud Schiele\u2019s\nmuseum grow, in starting a science museum here. And so outside of my work, my major activity\nhas been involved with this organization that we began, and in the last legislature, we finally got\ntwo and a half million dollars and we\u2019re going to put a planetartum with a very sophisticated\nprojection system out here at the community college. And the guy, and in fact in our little\noffices are next door, and we have a picture of the Schiele Museum on the wall. Because seeing\nthat effort work and flourish in the small town of Gastonia gave me some real thought, idea\nabout the fact that we can do it here. I think a lot of, I mean I think scouting gave me a lot in\nterms of values apart from the Judaism that is in my family.\n'l Joan Rosenberg\n27",
        "Q: Did you have a Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: Uh huh. Bar Mitzvah in Gastonia, North Carolina.",
        "Q: Did you prepare for that with your father?",
        "A: No. Now, my father, after he did this commuting thing, we eventually, we then moved to\nGastonia, where I was in the seventh grade and he... when he began working full time, actually\nhe worked in the little community called Lowell, North Carolina, which is about seven miles\naway. And he assisted the rabbi. Sometimes between rabbis he would do... he often acted as the\ncantor during services, and he often was on the pulpit. Sometimes he was not. During the high\nholiday services especially, like Yom Kippur, where people pray and they stay in the synagogue\nall day, the rabbi needs somebody to take turns with. But he was very close to most of the rabbis\nthat were there. The rabbi I was Bar Mitzvah was named Bill Silverman. And we had a, it was a\nvery large group. I suspect there were as many people who were not Jewish in the synagogue as\nthere were, a lot of friends, and my father had all of his friends from the mill that he worked with\nevery day. He was, he became an office manager there, after, in addition to his working daily\naround the, as a shift manager, but he became sort of a supervisor in Mr. Heilbronn\u2019s mill. And\nthen by the time I was thirteen, in the seventh or eighth grade, there were school friends, and\nmother had friends. So, it was a very nice congregation in Gastonia. There were probably fifty\nJewish families. And so I was Bar Mitzvah, and my brother was Bar Mitzvah. Can\u2019t remember\nwho the rabbi was when he was there. And my sister, nowadays they also have what they call\nBat Mitzvahs for girls, where girls go through the same thing. Or they have what they call\nconfirmation classes. I think she did that. We stayed pretty active, but like a lot of other kids\nwho are in the South in high school, after that fourteen, fifteen year old, you sort of... you\u2019re\nthere Friday nights, but teenagers, unless they have a real tie to, unless you\u2019re in a Conservative\nor an Orthodox family that is very traditional, which you get away from the Sunday school. And\nyour next connections with other Jews are... I mean, Charlotte has a large Jewish community\nand there were a lot of children our age, boys and girls, men and women. Then when you get to\ncollege. But we had the Bar Mitzvah. And you know, my father, people were very aware of the\nJewish community, I think, in Gastonia. I was always, in retrospect, after I worked in the Civil\nRights Division and after I was in the service, I always felt a little sad that the Jewish community\nwas not a little more assertive about desegregation. But I think the store owners were all afraid\nto lose their business.",
        "Q: You think that if they weren\u2019t afraid to lose their business, that they would have been inclined to\npush for desegregation?",
        "A: Oh, I think that... I mean, Judaism is founded on the theory of Justice. I mean, I think it was as\nbad for them to look the other way as it was for, I mean churches were segregated. It was a\nsegregated life. Although you grow up with it, you don\u2019t pay attention to it. I mean you just\naren\u2019t aware of it. You have, well Spartanburg and Gastonia. Well, Gastonia, as I was growing\nup, I think... .\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n28\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A of an interview with John Rosenberg.",
        "A: Yeah, we were talking about the Jewish communities in these towns and what they might have\ndone. I think it\u2019s always hard to look back and say, but I think the answer would have been if\nthey had felt they could have done more, they might have done more. I think that they were in\nthe business establishment just the way... I mean they were living in the South and they were not\ngoing to be trail blazers, because they would have been ostracized. I mean, if you look at what\nwas going on in the South in those earlier years and even later years when I was in the service...\nwell, I was saying in high school, I think there were some times that there were some occasions\nat high school with kids who were from the, from the black school... there were a few social, not\nsocial engagements, but some things were you tended to see each other. Or if you were working\ntogether, where they were stock boys\u2014I worked in department stores for many years\u2014you\nwould run into them. But it just was a... accepted way of life. And I have just... it did not\nreally, even in college, I mean you heard more about Jews not getting into the country club, and\nthat kind of stuff. And that there were incidents from time to time, but it was never, I don\u2019t think\nI was ever conscious of anti-Semitism. But it was really not until I was in the Service, working\nwith other officers who were African-American, I mean the Service was the first major arena\nwhere there was desegregation in this country, the military. And you know, I have told the story\nthat when I came back from... we brought an airplane back from England one year, by way of\nIceland and Greenland. Came back to New York and then two of us, the radar operator on my\nplane, I was the navigator, was a fellow named Abe Jenkins, who was from South Carolina, who\nwas black. And he and I got on the train in New York together to come home. And when we got\nto Washington, he got up all of a sudden and said, \u201cI'll see you when we get back.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the back of the train, where the blacks are.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah you better, that\u2019s where, I need to go there, otherwise\nwe\u2019re going to have some trouble.\u201d And he did. And I think it was an incident that changed my\nlife, really. Because I never... I was really outraged and aggravated and thought we\u2019ve got to do\nsomething about that or eventually maybe I can help to do something about that or whatever the\nthought was. But that was... so, it was not easy for... it wasn\u2019t going to come without court\naction and others, but I think that the Jews are no less, those Jewish communities are and the\npeople who are there, are no less, maybe no more to blame than their other counterparts. But it\nwas their economic circumstances and they were not willing to speak out or if they did, I don\u2019t\nknow where they did. I mean, the few people who did speak out, until there was more of a\nmovement, couldn\u2019t stay in their communities. I mean I worked with a man, a lawyer in the\nCivil Rights Division, who came from Fort Smith, Arkansas and he started trying to be, I mean\nhe was speaking out and the next thing he knew, he had no law practice left and he was in\nWashington, D.C. So, it\u2019s more easily said than done, but when you think about the history of\nthe persecution in the, that the Jews have had, and the Holocaust and all of the things that are\nbehind us, you... that they\u2019ve gone through, you would have hoped that Jews would have been\nmore sympathetic to the situation that blacks faced every day. And not quite as much of a\nwilling participant. It\u2019s easier said than done. It\u2019s just something that bothers me, you know,\nphilosophically it\u2019s hard to defend it.\n29",
        "Q: So, then was the time that you were in the Air Force the first time that you had had close\npersonal contact with black people and formed friendships?",
        "A: Yeah, right, I think so. I went to, when I went to Duke, I went to Duke on a scholarship which\nterminated. Because I got, the scholarship I was given through a trustee of Duke, who was from\nGastonia. I can\u2019t remember what his prominence was, but he was on the Board. And he died\nabout six months after I went to Duke. And I had started working 1n the dining halls and they\ntold me I made too much money and didn\u2019t need a scholarship, which might have been all right.\nI didn\u2019t have any trouble, I just worked my way through Duke. But he, but Duke had a quota on\nJewish students even in those years. And it was before the years that there were any black\nathletes to speak of, before Duke had any. So, I was just sort of thinking back, were there any\nblacks in my life in those earlier years? There weren\u2019t. And when I came out of the Service, out\nof Duke, I went into the ROTC. And when I was in the military, that was the first time where I\nhave any... and growing up in this country, yeah, thinking back on it.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about, when you were talking about your experiences in Boy Scouts, and\nyour earlier years in Gastonia. I\u2019m wondering if there was ever a conflict between your Jewish\nidentity and your Jewish practice and your social life? Did people expect you to be Christian and\nto be participating in things as a Christian? Was that ever a problem for you?",
        "A: No, it was very interesting, I think. Because the Scout troop, all the Scout troops were sponsored\nby churches. And the Scout troop I was a member of was sponsored by the Associate Reform,\nARP. They were called the Associate Reform Presbyterians. And I think they\u2019d had two or\nthree other Eagle Scouts from the Jewish community. And so, the answer is no. I mean I think\nthey were cognizant of the fact that we were Jewish. And I don\u2019t know that anybody ever tried\nto sort of convert anyone. But the troop, when I got to scout camp as a counselor one summer, I\nwas sort of... I wasn\u2019t... One of my jobs was to arrange the services and many of the scout\ntroops had ministers along with them or they were their scout masters. And so, I found myself in\nthe position of being, sort of the associate minister to these folks and I learned all the, many of\nthe hymns. And as we grew up, I went to church a few times. I certainly went to that\nPresbyterian church. But I think it was just a healthy respect. I think people in the church\nappreciated, I mean were respectful of the Jewish community and that religion. And often times\npeople came to those services. So, I don\u2019t know that, I think, you know, we often, the Schieles\nencouraged me to do that actually, the scout master. To be... and I often times did the Vesper\nservices for the campers who were there over the weekend. And there would probably be not\nmuch Jesus, but I would read from the Old and the New Testament and we would sing the hymns\nthat they knew, and it didn\u2019t bother me. Now it might very well have bothered many other,\nnot... other Jewish men might have said, \u201cWell you\u2019re just stupid. What are you doing this for?\u201d\nOr you know, \u201cWhy are you being a minister in this largely Protestant camp and sort of\nembracing their way of having a service?\u201d But I didn\u2019t have any problem with that. My parents\ndidn\u2019t have any problem with it.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you, did your, do you think your parents taught you Judaism in a way that\nallowed you to think of that as not being a contradiction?\n30",
        "A: I think my parents were very tolerant of other religions. I think my father... I mean my mother\nbasically grew up in a small, country town and was Jewish, but had many more associations with\nnon-Jewish people. Now my father had this very strong Jewish background. And there was\nactually a period of my life after I came out of the Service that I had given some consideration to\ngoing to Rabbinical school. And in the Reform movement, you know, the Reform Rabbinate is\nnot so different from the minister\u2019s life. It isn\u2019t all prayer. It\u2019s social work, visiting with people,\naround with the Jewish doctrine. So, I think my parents, when my father came South and started\nworking in the factory and realized that it was not going to make sense to be kosher and that\nmaybe bacon and eggs were good together. I think he essentially embraced the idea of Reform\nJudaism and was pretty... and since he worked almost all the time with folks who were not\nJewish. I think only the factory owner was Jewish, Heilbronn. That you, you just adapt\nculturally, much more, which the Reform congregations have done. If you go to Israel, Saturday\nall the stores are closed, right? The Sabbath is Saturday. And Friday night to Saturday night. In\nthis country, it\u2019s all on Sunday. I mean there was never such a thing as Sunday school, but\nJewish Reform congregations have Sunday school. And they basically adapted to living in a\nProtestant society. And I think we did that, and of course, you know, I think my father, it was a\nbig change in our family to have me marry someone who wasn\u2019t Jewish. Although it was\nprobably less pronounced because we were both a little older than if... I mean, as time has gone\non it has become much more common than it was. But then my sister married a young man from\nEastern North Carolina, who wasn\u2019t Jewish. They subsequently divorced, but she\u2019s had a\nsignificant other for many years, who\u2019s not Jewish also. So, I don\u2019t know how, you know my\nfather, I assume he came to grips with that. I think they both felt comfortable about their sons\nand then their daughter, who were, you know, were sort of achievers in the community and were\nhappy with their lives. And everybody likes to hear good things about their kids. And so I don\u2019t\nthink they were going to throw up barriers. I don\u2019t know that it was ever verbalized. I think my\nfather had a very... you know, he was very strong with his own convictions and had some very\nstrong ideas, but again, you know, if your kids go in a certain direction... raising children is as\ndifficult for anybody in school. And if they pal around with, in a society where very few people\nare Jewish, to say, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t go out with them or you shouldn\u2019t go to that camp or you\nshouldn\u2019t do this or you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d it\u2019s much harder. And I think they were always sort\nof adapting to where we were. I think. I mean I think it shows terrific flexibility on their part.\nMy mother was always much more of a social person, much more than he, which more than my\nfather. My dad was a pretty private person. And he was very... he read and he worked and he\nread. When he was home, did the dishes, sat down and read. And he had this enormous\nknowledge of Jewish history and Jewish religion. And there were very few people, other than\nthe rabbi, that he really enjoyed having long conversations with. I mean they were just in a\ndifferent world. I mean he would do his work and liked his work in a very exacting way. But\nthis fellow, when I asked you about Mrs. Hirschfield earlier, the person who volunteered... her\nhusband was a scientist, who came over here and became, and went into the textile work.",
        "Q: Was his name William?",
        "A: It\u2019s Frances, wait. Her name was Frances Hirschfield, his name was... I think it might have been\nWilliam.",
        "Q: Yeah, now I\u2019m remembering who they are. Yeah. I think they\u2019re still volunteering there.\n31",
        "A: Well, she just died. But he was... he died a few years back in Gastonia. He was, lived in\nHuntsville, Alabama, before they moved to Gastonia. And he came to Gastonia to be, like the\nchief chemist for the factory, dye work and things like that. And my dad could, would, enjoyed\nhaving him to talk to. And even in his retirement, when they moved to Florida, he... one of his\ngood friends was the rabbi for that congregation. So he was not a, he was in some ways a pretty,\na very private person. And I think he didn\u2019t either understand, not... understand may be the\nwrong word. He did not always appreciate what we were doing in our spare time. He didn\u2019t\ngrow up in scouting, but I think he really appreciated what we learned in scouting. And the\npeople that he met, the other scout masters and the activities that we did.",
        "Q: Was your brother a scout, too?",
        "A: My brother was a scout. And he became an Eagle Scout in that same Presbyterian church. He\nendured a summer with me that he says he\u2019Il never forget, because I was the scout master in\ncharge of the cabin when he was a few years younger and was a camper. And I induced him to\nbe Minihaha or twisted his arm or the Schieles twisted his arm. But... so, when... my dad in that\nway was pretty, I think, tolerant of what we did and just let us do it.",
        "Q: Was being Jewish important to you at the time, from a young age?",
        "A: Oh sure. I think it\u2019s always been important to me and is important to me, today. And you know,\nI think it\u2019s had a profound effect on my life. I talked about it during... I mean, Judaism has been\npart of me all the way through and I guess I\u2019m pretty conscious of being Jewish. Not that I think\nabout it every day, but it\u2019s a very attractive religion, I think. It\u2019s very simple. Its principles\nmake a lot of sense to me, if one is going to believe in a higher being. And people are aware that\nIam Jewish. And I spend some time talking about Judaism, sometimes in schools, sometimes to\ncivic groups or Passover, that sort of thing. But, I mean, nothing to necessarily flout, it\u2019s just the\nway itis. And then of course, I said my wife is not Jewish. But then we have a small Quaker\ncontingent in the mountains that I participate with. So, we put those two things together,\nsomething I probably wouldn\u2019t have predicted years ago either. I\u2019m sure that all of this\nHolocaust history is very much a part of, or has contributed a great deal to what I\u2019ve been doing\nin my later life, in this work that I do and the work I did in the Civil Rights Division.",
        "Q: And I\u2019d really like to discuss that more and maybe it would make more sense to do that after\nwe've really discussed your work here and with the Civil Rights Division so that it can be put\nmore in context. Do you think? Or do you want to say something about it now?",
        "A: Well, what were you thinking? What else did you want to talk about?",
        "Q: Well, your later years (laughing), the rest of your life that we haven\u2019t talked about yet.",
        "A: I see.",
        "Q: But I definitely am interested in hearing how your Holocaust, when you say that your Holocaust\nexperiences that had a profound effect on your subsequent work.\n32",
        "A: Well, I think the family, I think coming to this country... I think we\u2019ve always been grateful for\nthe opportunity that we\u2019re here, from the time we came. And I think my parents were always\nvery cognizant, emphasized that. I always remember right after we, when we moved to\nSpartanburg in those early days, like many other immigrant families, you\u2019d have a picture on the\nwall of Franklin Roosevelt and the Statue of Liberty or something else. And I remember, I think\nI remember this incident: when the immigration people or the FBI showed up one day on our\ndoor in Gastonia\u2014was it Gastonia or Spartanburg?\u2014and they came and took out... you were not\nallowed to have a short-wave radio and you were not allowed to have binoculars, because you\nmight spy on somebody. And we had an old monocular, one of those things that seafaring\ncaptains go... do... use. And they took that. And they saw the picture on the wall and they were\nvery embarrassed in what they were doing. I mean they, my parents were very nice...",
        "Q: So, I\u2019m sorry, it was just immigrants that weren\u2019t allowed to have these things?",
        "A: Right, yeah, if you weren\u2019t American citizens. We were aliens, foreigns, aliens. And eventually,\nyears later they brought them back. They returned them. I don\u2019t know if it was right after we\ngot our citizenship papers. My parents applied to become citizens, then in 1945, after five years,\ntook their test and got their citizenship. We went to Charlotte. Federal judges often talk about\nthe most poignant experiences, how often or how many of them remark about the thrill they\nmake, they have in presiding over the citizenship swearings-in. And we went to... my parents\nwere sworn in in Charlotte. We went across the street. And I think it was... I think that the\nrestaurant... we went to a restaurant. I think it was the first time I ever ate out in my life, that\nthey ever went out. It was a little diner across the street, after the swearing-in ceremony. But,\nand I think that my work, going into the military, in part and then working in the Division and\nmaybe the work I do here is all, in some ways... I never viewed it as a sacrifice, but I think\nhaving a life in public service, in a way, is helping to try to make this country a better place to\nlive in and give back a little bit. I mean there are lots of ways of giving back, if that\u2019s the right\nword, but at least helping to contribute to making this a better society and not necessarily being\ngoverned by the dollar sign, which, you know, we all have an opportunity to do. But in that way,\nI think, all of this, at least I think that whether it was my parents or my Judaism, it all kind of\ncomes together in some way that you... I mean it\u2019s a real privilege to do what I do and get paid\nfor it. And it was that way in the Civil Rights Division, to have a position where you can help to\nprovide better opportunities for African-Americans in this country, by working, by using the\nlegal system to make, to break these barriers down. And to do the same thing in my present job\nor what I\u2019ve been doing for almost thirty years for poor people, to give them a chance to be on\nthe same playing field or to level the playing field for them, at least when they\u2019re trying to make\ntheir way through the legal system, or when they\u2019re in trouble. And to make the legal system\nwork for them, which they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford unless it was for the lawyers and staff in\nthis program that I\u2019ve been in charge of for a number of years.",
        "Q: During the early years that you were in the United States and Spartanburg and Gastonia, as the\nwar is developing, were you aware of what was happening in Europe to the Jews? Were you\nable to follow that?\n33",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know when we found out they were all killed, that the family was killed,\nor what was... you know, in 1944... or even that these ships that were not allowed 1n this\ncountry, all these that were going around and around, went back to Germany, Holland. I don\u2019t\nknow whether there was any contact. I don\u2019t think there was. I don\u2019t think my... that\u2019s a good\nquestion. Whether my father knew where his brother was, that they were alive. I don\u2019t think\nthey did have any contact. Because, and when we looked at those records, I think from being\nwith Mother, that that was the first time that she knew for sure. I mean that we had heard, the\nthing from this... but I don\u2019t think there was any contact. I don\u2019t know. I was still too much in\nschool. I mean, you know, it seems like it jumps from high school. It seems like you\u2019ve always\nknown the story of the Holocaust. But whether we knew that that was happening when, let\u2019s see\nI was, \u201844, I would have been thirteen, in the seventh grade. What are your, what do you know\nabout that?",
        "Q: Well, the stuff that filtered through the press was sketchy and sometimes you\u2019d get news about\nwhat was happening to the Jews, but it wasn\u2019t really until after the war when the liberators were\nencountering the camps and involved with liberating a lot of them that they really knew the\nextent of what was happening and that, that started to really, that started to really reach the press.\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been until \u201845, probably. And definitely as far as keeping in contact, that would\nhave been really hard.",
        "A: I mean that\u2019s what I remember, I mean that\u2019s my thinking. You read these stories about the\nGermans letting the American Red Cross into some of their camps and cleaning them up and all\nof that stuff. And that they did visit some of the camps, right? At least right after the war. But I\ndon\u2019t know...",
        "Q: The camps that the Red Cross...",
        "A: I mean after the war began. Huh?",
        "Q: The camps that the Red Cross visited were cleaned up and altered for the media, and made into\nkind-of stages.",
        "A: Right. But I, I mean that\u2019s all I know. I don\u2019t think my father and mother had any idea that they\nwere alive or where they were until after the war. We don\u2019t really know what happened to the\nfamily in Holland, I don\u2019t think. And Frankfurt, the family in Frankfurt. I think we know\nthey\u2019re, did not live. And that, I\u2019m not sure we... I don\u2019t think I could find the record. Trying to\nremember what his first name was, whether that was another de Vries. But it\u2019s... I have a cousin\nwho did this family tree and he drew a family tree like a tree with limbs and with how many\nimmediate relatives on my father\u2019s side and cousins and cousins. I mean when you\u2019 ve got eight\nchildren, and there are cousins that we\u2019ve never met and what happened to them all. I just don\u2019t\nthink there was any real communication in those years.",
        "Q: Do you remember, do you remember learning about it later? Or do you remember what was\ngoing on in your family in 1945 when you started to learn about what was happening?\n34",
        "A: Well, I mean I was in, let\u2019s see in \u201845 I was fourteen. You know, I don\u2019t have a good\nrecollection. We just had a reunion in Gastonia, North Carolina and one of my teachers was\nthere. She\u2019s living out west. She was, it happened that she was the newest teacher to come to the\nhigh school, so she\u2019s only four years older, or five years older than some of us. At the time she\nwas an algebra teacher. And she had her grade book with my name in it. She still had her grade\nbook from those years. I had very little recollection about having been in her class. And so I\ndon\u2019t know whether other people have have better memories about... I mean whether you you\nstart to lose your long... I mean, how good is your memory? Your memory is probably not too\nbad for high school days.",
        "Q: Yeah, it seems like memories change so much over time.",
        "A: So, I don\u2019t know what I remember about Germany. I mean if you go to... we went to services\nFriday night as we all did and you listened to what happened. I\u2019m sure we were conscious of\nwhat, I mean, just like everybody else when they did go in \u201845 and liberate the camps...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\n35\nTape 3, Side B",
        "A: Side B?",
        "Q: Yeah, tape number three, side B... tape number three, side B of an interview with John\nRosenberg.",
        "A: Well, I was just saying I think that Betty, Sammy\u2019s wife, came out of the concentration camp\nalive. And so there, she was visited a couple of times. We really did not dwell on anything with\nher, I think, other than the fact Sammy was her husband and that she had made it through, I don\u2019t\nknow... and that\u2019s when we went to see her. And of course, that was in 1960... it was 1970,\nwhich would have been twenty-five years after she went to Israel, after the war was over.",
        "Q: She went to Israel in \u201845?",
        "A: She went in, or \u201c46, right after she got out. And my father and mother, I think he was in touch\nwith her and had seen her. I mean they went over before we did... it was somewhere in there...\nwell maybe they didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think they went to Israel until after he retired, which would have\nbeen in 1966. When he was sixty-five he retired from this factory in North Carolina. And he\nwent, they moved to Florida. And then in their retirement they took some, they started traveling.\nSo I think they had corresponded pretty regularly, Betty and my father. But, so it was almost\ntwenty years. I think she had relatives in Israel also. But I don\u2019t think they knew very much\nabout what was going on at all. No, I\u2019m not a fount of knowledge about that. You probably\nhave more from other interviews about that. Did you talk to any people who knew very much\nabout, who were in this country, who knew very much about what was happening in the camps\nin the \u201840s?",
        "Q: No. And I haven\u2019t talked to a whole lot of people who were in this country during those years. I\nmean most of the people I\u2019ve talked to came right afterwards.",
        "A: Came after the war.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You haven\u2019t talked to many second-generation people like me. My sister was born in this\ncountry. She was born in Gastonia. I still speak like fourth-grade German, and can understand\nit. My brother can speak a little bit. My sister doesn\u2019t know any German. Do you want to see\nany of this stuff? I mean you\u2019re welcome to... I don\u2019t know what there 1s to see, but I think\nyou\u2019re doing it primarily on tape. We have birth certificates. I don\u2019t know where my father\u2019s is,\ncouldn\u2019t find it this morning. I have that Gedenk book in the other room. Ill show you that.",
        "Q: Yeah, sure, yeah. I\u2019d love to see some of the pictures you mentioned.",
        "A: Well the pictures, unfortunately are with my mother. She has the old book. And I didn\u2019t... I\nalmost brought them back because nobody ever looks at them. And I happened to look at them\non this trip because I had a little time. For one thing, I didn\u2019t know what had happened to them.\n36\nI was afraid we might have misplaced them. They went back and forth a couple of times. When\nmy mother moved from Florida up to Maryland... my dad passed away in 1989, I think, and she\nstayed another year or two in Florida, where her sister lived in the same place called Century\nVillage. Then she moved to Chevy Chase. She\u2019s about fifteen minutes from my brother in a\nhigh rise for the elderly. So a lot of stuff got moved around, but she does have a lot of the\nphotographs. And it\u2019s nice, interesting to go back and look at them.",
        "Q: So, changing the subject a little bit, when you were in college at Duke, you were really interested\nat that point in science? Is that what you thought you were going to have a career in?",
        "A: I enjoyed, I like chemistry and physics and had a very good chemistry teacher. I also like doing\nsales work. I sold a lot, all the way through high school. I sold clothes, women\u2019s shoes, every...\nso I decided I might enjoy being a chemical salesman or technical representative of that sort.\nAnd so, when I came out of Duke, I first went into the Service. When I came out of the Service I\nwent to work for a chemical firm in Philadelphia, Rohm and Haas Company.",
        "Q: So you graduated in what year?",
        "A: 1953.",
        "Q: \u00b053, and then you enlisted?",
        "A: I was in the Air Force ROTC partly because at the time they gave you a break on tuition, it was\nsort of an avocation. And I think becoming, I had originally, I had thought about, I mean I\njoined it...the early Air Force, the Navy ROTC\u2019s were giving full scholarship. The Air Force\nROTC was just being established. And I think there was a commitment to two years afterwards.\nIt seemed like when you were footloose and fancy-free in peacetime, it might not be such a bad\nthing to do to get, as a trade-off for some tuition and again the idea of doing some service for\nyour country. So at Duke, so that\u2019s what I did. And then the commitment, the two year\ncommitment, I first thought I would like to fly. And I went to flight school for a short period of\ntime and that didn\u2019t really work out, so I ended up going to navigation training, which I liked.\nAnd I became a navigator and that had a three year commitment attached to it, which I served\nout in England.",
        "Q: So was there any, that was during the Korean War, right?",
        "A: Right. It was during the Korean War, but I was very far from Korea.",
        "Q: So there was no... you knew that you weren\u2019t going to get involved in the war if you...",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know that it would have mattered. There were some of my, we had our choice if\nyou were near the top of the class, where you wanted to go. Maybe everybody had a choice.\nAnd I could have gone to, I don\u2019t know that you went to Korea, to the Pacific or to teach. I\ndecided that the opportunity to go to England seemed like a really good one. So I chose to go to\nEngland, because of Europe it just seemed like a nice opportunity to travel. There were, I mean\nwe lost, but 1t was not a military, you know, as I said, it was Cold... during the Cold War. And\n37\nso we were doing a lot of exercises on the border out of Austria. Bad T\u00e9lz'\u201d is where the Special\nForces were. And we did a lot of very low flying to bring stuff in. I would not have objected to\nbeing in, if we had had to go. The big, I think most poignant thing for me was, while I was\nEngland, at one point towards the end of my tour, we were on alert for the Six Day War during\nthe Suez Canal crisis. And we were on alert for a week and nobody knew whose side we were\non. They didn\u2019t know which side they were going to go on. And I said, I think this 1s not a good\nway to spend your life, when you don\u2019t know which side you\u2019re on and then they tell you which\nside you\u2019re on, whether you like it or not. So, I thought... I enjoyed my days in the military, we\nhad very... I mean I had wonderful associations. We, the group I was with on this small base in\nEngland still gets together every two or three years, and we\u2019re going to be in Charleston in\nOctober. Over those years my pacifist Quaker wife has gotten to meet some of my war-\nmongering friends and they\u2019ve all gotten to know her. And you know, most of them are retired.\nA lot of them spent their life in the military and then retired or had second careers. But when\nyou mentioned Duke a while ago, I was thinking that it was very, in those days Duke... if I had it\nto do over again, I probably would have gone to the University of North Carolina. I had this\nscholarship. It had a good academic reputation, as it is now. It\u2019s a much more liberal school\nnow; it was very church-dominated. But I made very good friends. I was in a Jewish fraternity\nthere during those years, which was probably the first group of strong associations with other\nJewish men that I had had since probably ever, because many of them came from other states,\nFlorida and north, New York, New Jersey and what have you. While I was there though, I was\nthe delegate to the convention when we agreed to stop limiting the fraternity membership to\nJews. Still I think maybe predominantly, it was called ZBT. I had a lot of mixed feelings about\nthat at the time, but... I mean it was also part of the history of... there was a Jewish sorority and\na Jewish fraternity, and it sort of kept me, those were my strong associations when I was at\nDuke, other than the fact that I also worked in the dining halls, doing waiting, doing\ndishwashing. And then I became cashier and head waiter and learned the food business at Duke.\nIt was working your way through school. But there were, most of my very good friends at Duke\nwere Jewish. We lived together for the three or four years I was there. In terms of the continuity\nand where it was going. And then I went into the Air Force and actually in London, in England\nwe had some distant relatives, who were... I was just looking at the family tree today, were... a\nguy named David Tichauer who was related. A cousin of my father\u2019s was in London. And then\nhis daughter married a rabbi and they went to South Africa, and I think they\u2019re back in England\nnow. But most of the people on the base were not Jewish. I mean most of my associations in the\nAir Force weren\u2019t. So it\u2019s sort of come and gone. I don\u2019t know what we did on Jewish holidays.\nI think someone, there was a chaplain, he wasn\u2019t Jewish. I mean, it wasn\u2019t a full-time Jewish\nChaplain there. But I think I went to the... several times during the holidays I went to London,\nto be with the family. So it\u2019s sort of come along. I was looking at a picture in my mother\u2019s\nphotograph that was taken at Chapel Hill when I went back to Law School at the University of\nNorth Carolina. And the group of Jewish students and the rabbi who was at Hillel, which was\nthe Jewish Student organization on most campuses. That was taken back then, so... it\u2019s always\nsort of been there. Want to stop for a while?",
        "Q: Okay, it is now August 21st and we\u2019re back again for more interviewing and Mr. Rosenberg\u2019s\ngoing to say some things that he learned last night from talking to his mother.\n'2 Bad T\u00e9lz, Germany\n38",
        "A: John. Actually, this morning. We were not sure, I was not sure what had happened with my\nuncle when he was arrested. And my mother does not know either whether he was arrested and\ntaken away with my father, which I didn\u2019t remember, or whether... she thought that he was\narrested at the same time or almost at the same time. But may have been taken to a different\nplace, because my... I told her my only recollection was running the sandwich up the street to\nmy father. And I didn\u2019t remember seeing my uncle at all. But, I mean he may have been there\nand I was just focused on my father. But they did, he and my father did end up going to\nBuchenwald together. And they were released together, because I remember, as I said, seeing\nthem very bald, in Frankfurt am Main in my Aunt\u2019s house, Elly\u2019s house. And my mother\nconfirmed of course, that my grandmother took me then to Elly\u2019s house. She said that they made\ntheir way to Holland also. She said my grandmother then went to Rotterdam and lived in a small\napartment by herself, near my aunt Mary. That she said, she remembered the German, the Dutch\ngovernment would not allow immigrants to live with their relatives. So she couldn\u2019t live with\nher daughter, Mary, who had four children. And she took, apparently took her meals with her.\nMy family then went into this large detention camp that I had explained, had talked about. And\nshe said my uncle also got there, eventually ended up in that same place in Rotterdam. She\ndidn\u2019t know how he got there, that he... because her impression was that he did not stay with my\nmother, my grandmother. Whether he went back to Leer to close things down very quickly and\nthen made his way to Rotterdam, which is very possible. I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m not sure that\nanyone recorded that. But she did remember that he was in the detention camp with us part of\nthe time because she said that he, she remembered him coming up and talking with my father. I\njust don\u2019t remember, have good recollection of that. And he may not have been there the whole\ntime we were there. She said that he was on the boat that, after us, and the boat turned around,\nshe remembered because war broke out that very day, with the Dutch, and they told the ship to\nturn around. Or with the British. The war had started and they wouldn\u2019t let the boat continue.\nAnd you had asked about our contacts during the war. She knew, as far as she could recall there\nwas no contact with anyone in the concentration camp. She didn\u2019t remember when we learned\nthat Sammy had gotten married in the camp, but there was no correspondence back and forth or\nany kind of... and no one had really any knowledge about what had gone on. She said the Dutch\ngovernment... that both my grandmother and my uncle ended up at Theresienstadt. They\nprobably went to Westerbork first, where most of the refugees went to and then the Germans\ntook all that over. But that was pretty much, I just did not remember, couldn\u2019t fill that hole in.\nWhen I was in the Service, of course we had the relatives in England. And I went to Germany a\nnumber of times with my Air Force, with our crew, we flew planes into Germany several times\nand had some days off. It was a very strange feeling to be in Germany, I always remember,\nhaving, knowing you\u2019re in a country where the language is yours, it\u2019s not like the language you\nlearned in college, but that people are speaking a language that you sort of know is your native\nlanguage. And yet we really were, our trips were generally, our stays were generally quite short.\nAnd I really never made much of an effort to sort of identify the local synagogue if there was\none. I mean I just didn\u2019t come into contact with many Jews. I was trying to think in retrospect, I\nsuppose my first big jaunt was to go, my contact with the Jewish community was really when I\nwent to Israel. When I was in Germany, when I was in England, I took a trip to Israel where I\nvisited my father\u2019s sister and her family, and my counterpart, who was my age at that time. They\nwere out in the country. Living in a little place called Yokneam which was a cooperative\nfarming community.\n39",
        "Q: What were their names?",
        "A: Their names were de Vries. His name was Ivan de Vries and her name was Lina. And that was\nwhen I met Sammy\u2019s widow for the first time. She was living in an apartment, I think in Haifa.\nAnd I spent some time with her, but we didn\u2019t really talk in detail about the camps or I don\u2019t\nknow enough of her own relations. I think she may have had a sister or someone. I don\u2019t know\nabout the details of her family. And Moshe, my cousin, had already gotten married to a young\nwoman named Nurit. In fact while we were there, one of our other cousins was married to...\nwell, no, that was when I went on my second trip. This time I was in the military. I was by\nmyself. And I stayed in Israel a couple of weeks. We had some, I was going to say we had some\nother relatives in Tel Aviv, who had a... whose name was Berliner, he was sort of an amateur\narchaeologist and he had collected this amazing... had done a lot of digging and rooms full of\nartifacts that he had collected. But they were still, they still led a fairly plain farm life back then,\nand were... I remember you didn\u2019t leave any food on your plate. And when they ate their\nchickens, they ate... or ducks, I think, they ate every, they cleaned that duck out. Head included.\nBut they were lovely, lovely people and they knew, of course, Betty. And then I just traveled\naround on my own. And later when I came, after Jean and I were married, we came back when\nshe was pregnant with Michael. She said she was the first non-Jewish wife in the family. But\nwhile we were there we also went to a distant cousin\u2019s, relative, wedding. And that young man\nmarried a Yemenite Jewish woman, which at that time was as different, as rare Jews marrying\nnon-Jews in this country. But that was several years later, and we were still... but it was nice.\nThe family, we are, we still correspond with each other, and we still are close to our family in\nIsrael with Moshe. My father\u2019s sister and her husband have died. And Betty has also died. So,\nbut in terms of Germany itself, you know, when I went, I think I mentioned I had gone back to\nthe town where my mother was born.",
        "Q: Did you have any memories of that town? Of Idar-Oberstein?",
        "A: I may have had some vague memories about the butcher store, because I was so small when we\nwere there, like five and six. I remember the butcher store sign. It\u2019s hard to tell whether what I\nremember really had more to do with recollections from pictures than from what was real. The\npeople I met, who remembered me obviously were contemporaries of my mother or the sisters.\nIt was a small country town and I think my grandfather was well-known in that area for his being\na butcher, an honest butcher and hard working. It\u2019s like Prestonsburg, people who have lived\nhere all of their lives\u2014I mean it was a very well known family, the Schubach family. So people\nwhen I first went there, word traveled pretty quickly, at least in the area where they were and I\nmet a number of people who knew them. I stayed in the local hotel. And later when I came back\nwith mother, a second time, you know, I mentioned her friends were there. But before that... but\nyou always have this feeling generated by the notion that no one there that\u2019s still alive, they\u2019re all\nvery embarrassed, maybe guilty about what happened. And I guess most of them would say they\ndidn\u2019t know anything about it, just like the people who lived near Dachau and Buchenwald and\nsaw the smoke, and were looking the other way or knew, probably most of them knew what was\nhappening or many people certainly knew what was happening in Germany. Many were very\nsympathetic to the whole idea of Hitler and were very supportive of him all the way through,\ncertainly when they thought they were going to win the war. So, I\u2019m sure I think that I had some\nof those mixed feelings and wasn\u2019t, I was younger then, that interested particularly in trying to\n40\ndig up a lot of Jewish history. Well for one thing Magdeburg was not in... I couldn\u2019t go to the\ncity where I was born. So other than the city...",
        "Q: Why couldn\u2019t you go to Magdeburg?",
        "A: It was in the East zone. It was in the Russian zone, so we couldn\u2019t go. We couldn\u2019t go until the\nBerlin Wall came down. So I couldn\u2019t go when I was in the Service or after that. We... I did not\ngo to Leer. I don\u2019t know why I did not really ever try to go to Leer. My wife, Jean and her\nmother, when they drove down from Sweden on a European tour, went through there Leer once\nto see. I have a film at home that was made by a Jewish film maker about a reunion about the\nJewish community from Leer, when Leer hosted the Jewish community for a reconciliation\nweekend and he happened to be there and made a film of that. He\u2019s in Israel now, I think. But I\nhave that film and Leer\u2019s a little bigger than it was. Then I have a family history that you can\nhave or a family tree and there\u2019s a letter from a distant cousin in Virginia, who sort of got into\nthe genealogy and he went back to a number of these places where my father\u2019s mother, the rabbis\nand traced some of that history back. And went to Leer and all of those small towns where my\ngrandmother came from and her family came from. I guess I did not have anything that was\nreally driving me to do that. I think when you get to be older, you sort of start thinking,\nsomebody... which is one my interests in talking with you, it is important to preserve that history\nand it\u2019s nice to have it and to know about it. I\u2019m sure it has some impact on all our lives, but I\ndidn\u2019t do very much of that when I was in the Service. There was, I\u2019m sure, still a lot of\nhostility, feelings, even though my mother and... my father and my mother did go back to\nGermany. They went once or twice. And my dad did not feel, I don\u2019t think he was... I mean\nthey went several summers in their retirement to Austria. And they had been to Vienna on their\nhoneymoon. So I don\u2019t think their feelings were so strong. And my mother, as I said, kept up\nher correspondence with some of her friends. So, anyway, that...",
        "Q: So what compelled you to go back was kind of, was it just a kind of curiosity to see the place?\nOr did you have any...",
        "A: Well, the trips to Germany, the formal, were generally military. We had an airplane. We were\nflying into bases in Germany and had business there of one sort or another, training missions. I\ndidn\u2019t really just go there to sightsee. I mean I was there for a reason and then generally we\nstayed over, as we did in other European places. I had some distant relatives in Paris, which I\nwent to see for family connections, who are related to my mother, two older brothers. But I\nthink there is, you know, and maybe the local explorations were kind of curiosity, but it was\nmore looking at this cathedral or... the towns that I wasn\u2019t familiar with, I didn\u2019t... I went to\nOberstein, I really went to Oberstein, to mother\u2019s home town because I happened to be there in\nsurvival training in that area and didn\u2019t realize how close it was. I think I was not yet on any...\nwhether I would have gone there otherwise, I\u2019m not sure. I might have. I think I had some idea.\nI knew mother was still in touch with her contemporaries. Even though my father had no\nconnections to anybody in Magdeburg. Most of their friends that were alive had come to this\ncountry. So, there wasn\u2019t much reason to go, other than maybe trying to determine what the\nstatus was of the Jewish community. Going to Israel of course was a voluntary, it was a vacation\nthing for me. Going to Paris. I think I didn\u2019t go out of my way to go to Germany.\n4]",
        "Q: About going to Israel, did you have any, did you ever had any Zionist feelings or any desire to\nlive there?",
        "A: Oh, I think it was a wonderful... it was wonderful to be there. And I felt really proud of what\nhad been done. I never... my father was a very strong Zionist. And I felt very strongly and still\ndo about a Jewish homeland there. But I didn\u2019t really, I think with your parents, I never\nconsidered, I think, living far from where my parents lived, either there... I mean sort of staying\nin Israel while they were here. Just like in this country, I thought, I went to law school in\nColorado one summer and went to other places. And unless you have the means to get back and\nforth every weekend or something, you\u2019d want to be... I always thought we belonged in the east.\nTo be near them. So, Israel is certainly, Jean went with me. I'd like to go back again. It\u2019s a\ngreat accomplishment. And it is, it\u2019s part of our history. And it\u2019s especially nice to have when\nyou have relatives who are there, I mean they were part of the family, being that close, being my\nfather\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Did you have a strong sense of to the United States?\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\n42\nTape 4, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side A of an interview with John Rosenberg.",
        "A: I think I always had a very strong feeling about allegiance to America or patriotism. I mean that\ngoes back to my parents coming here. You know, I think as you get older, when events like\nVietnam happens, you question it the way any other... the value of that action or any other action\nthat the country takes as a nation, intervening in other wars or as a world leader and the limits to\nwhich you would want to go, that people go to in the name of... that actions that we take as\nAmericans against other countries, or whatever we do in our official nature. As an American, I\nmean, as a responsible citizen should do, but I have certainly never gave it any thought. I mean,\nI think as I said, when we were on alert for a week and didn\u2019t know whose side we were on, I\nthought that\u2019s not a way I want to spend my life. I think if it were a little clearer than that I\nmight have stayed in the military just because of the very close associations I had with the people\nthat I was in the Service with. I mean we were just very, very good friends. And when you do\nthings together and rely on each other in situations I suppose that are somewhat dangerous, and\nyou become very close. It doesn\u2019t have to be just on the battlefield. Even when you are doing\ntraining exercises that are, that involve some danger, in which you act as a team. And then you\nspend a lot of off time together or you\u2019re on a base, like a small base out in nowhere in England,\nyou become part of a family in some way. And so there was, I would have considered that, I just\nwas not... but I decided that I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m ready to push the button on Israel for example\nand start... if we had come in on the other side against Israel, I would have been in a terrible\npredicament. And wouldn\u2019t want to find myself in that predicament. And then after I married a\nQuaker, I left my tennis shoes at the Pentagon Athletic Club and never went back to get them.\nYou know, I probably have a much more, in some ways a different outlook about the value of\nviolence and the value of military actions to some extent. It\u2019s certainly been moderated. I\nwouldn\u2019t at all call myself a pacifist. But I don\u2019t know, anyway, that\u2019s, I certainly think I would\ncertainly consider myself a very, very much an American citizen.",
        "Q: And when you say you wouldn\u2019t call yourself a pacifist, what does that mean? Does that mean\nthat you... well we\u2019ll just leave it at that. What does that mean?",
        "A: Well, I think, you know, philosophically you obviously, Quakers, if you take that position, take a\nstrong pacifist position, you are in a sense ready to die when someone points a weapon at\nsomeone you love and is ready to pull a trigger. And you\u2019re not going to interfere with that sort\nof situation. Or you feel that there is never any justification for violent action. And I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019m in that place. I mean I think there probably are situations where you may find yourself\nwilling to react violently or to take up arms against somebody else under certain situations, under\nthose situations. Like a war. And you use a war to end a war. (Laughing.) I think that\u2019s\nprobably still in my, I think it\u2019s the last resort, and not one that I would promote, but I don\u2019t\nthink I could easily stand by, and stand there. Of course, I joined the, I was in the Air Force\nvoluntarily, no one drafted me.",
        "Q: Were you aware of criticisms of Jews during the Holocaust, that they had not resisted enough?\nAnd that they had been too pacifistic and just passive in allowing the violence to happen to them,\nthat they had...?\n43",
        "A: You mean in the concentration camps or where or when?",
        "Q: In general in the whole... there were some criticisms that were voiced, especially just\nimmediately following the war by Bruno Bettelheim and others that the Jews had gone like sheep\nto the slaughter. And that they had not resisted enough. That this was a problem with the Jewish\npeople, that they were not ready enough to take up arms to defend themselves. And I\u2019m\nwondering if you, if you shared that point of view or if you were aware that people thought that,\nor if you have any thoughts about that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I am not familiar with that. And I mean I think it\u2019s probably... I don\u2019t see how anybody\ncould take that position because the Germans were so, they were armed. They were so superior.\nThere were those courageous, there were some of those acts, you know, in several concentration\ncamps where the Jews broke out or had plotted to leave and some did escape. I don\u2019t know the\nname of those camps. And there were individual acts of resistance. I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t see\nhow anybody could have said that. I mean I\u2019ve read an awful lot about and heard a lot about\nJews who were made to sort of cooperate and throw the bodies away, or how much were you\nwilling to do to stay alive? Because the camps also, the camps themselves were operated in a\nlarge part by slave labor, which was pretty horrible, and some of the work that people had to do\nwas pretty horrible. And they were doing it partly to stay alive or they could have gotten shot\nunder the circumstances. And I\u2019m sure people right down to the last second feel like, as some\nwould say, I was trying to stay alive and hope everybody would, that people understand it.\nWhether you are the person who\u2019s going down the list and saying this, and have some decision\nmaking about who\u2019s going to die and who\u2019s going to live, or whether you\u2019re out there and, where\nyou\u2019re effectively making those decisions, hoping to keep yourself off the list. Or whether\nyou\u2019re actually throwing bodies in a pit or doing some other kind of maintenance work, you\u2019re\nunder the gun. I don\u2019t think you can ever, I don\u2019t see how any, I mean I do see, but I would\nnever want to be critical of anybody who is doing that when they\u2019re essentially forced to do it.\nThe people who would say go ahead and shoot me, and let somebody shoot them, are heroes of a\ndifferent sort, I suppose. And heroines of different sorts, when you do those sorts of things on\nprinciple. And that\u2019s how, I guess, principles are established over time. But it\u2019s expecting a lot\nfrom someone. And I think there is an element of forgiveness, generally in our tradition and in\nother traditions. You may have to take an extreme measure to save yourself. You can\u2019t expect\npeople to lay down. So I don\u2019t think that anyone could accuse the Jews of being... if that means\ngoing like lambs to the slaughter. I mean they didn\u2019t have, most of those, most families weren\u2019t\narmed. My father never allowed us to have any weapon. He almost bought me a BB gun once\nand then somebody had gotten a window shot out in the neighborhood and I never got my BB\ngun. But we never had a gun in the house. And he wouldn\u2019t let us have weapons. That was one\nof the no-no\u2019s, one of the few no-no\u2019s.",
        "Q: Were you aware of, by the time that you were in the Air Force, were you very interested in\nAmerican politics, political issues? [ll leave it at that. I have another related question.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s hard to answer. I don\u2019t know, because when I was, I think I was, you know, pretty\nyoung. And you come out of high school and you\u2019re out of a background where I had, was\nreally fortunate. I was president of the senior class and had been working and went to Duke and\nAd\nit seemed like a good thing to do. And my father\u2014we went to the bank, I remember borrowing\ntwo or three hundred dollars\u2014he sent me twenty-five bucks a month. And they were straining to\nget me, and I was working to get through. I don\u2019t think the politics of what was going on was, I\nthink my, ideally we were so grateful to be here that generally everything seemed like it was very\npositive to be in this country. I was the first person of my generation to go to college. My\nparents were very proud of that. So, I suspect in many ways... Israel, this country was very\nsupportive of Israel. So, I just think probably in our eyes, it might be a stretch to say the country\ncould do no wrong, but pretty close to it. And that we were ready pretty much to accept the way\nthings were going and felt pretty good about it. I mean I think we felt, I\u2019m sure my parents felt,\nmy dad, that we had come a long way. He was working hard, his son was going to college, his\nyounger brother was doing well in school. I don\u2019t think the politics... my father read the paper\nreligiously. He was a very educated person and he had very strong views of his own about, he\nwas very much of an anti-Communist. He did not, he always preached that Communism\nwouldn\u2019t work, that you couldn\u2019t expect it to and that he thought it was a very repressive system,\nnot only for religion, but for human beings, he thought Communism was terrible. And, I mean\nhe didn\u2019t get out on the street corners, but... he wasn\u2019t himself involved in any politics at home.\nHe voted, he had very strong views, but as I say, he was very much of a private person. And I\nthink the way in many small, southern towns, politics isn\u2019t top of the agenda normally. I mean\nyou lead a pretty insulated, very provincial sort of life. Unless you are... especially if you are in\na working-class family. So I don\u2019t think I was very politically astute. I mean, and as I say, I\ndidn\u2019t have the first thought about any problem about joining the ROTC. I guess I might have\nthought it was a good thing to do, as far as trying to serve the country, you\u2019d get tuition, be able\nto contribute a little bit.",
        "Q: Did you have, so you joined the Air Force in 1954?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, I graduated from Duke in \u201853, so I was in the ROTC the last two years, I think. \u201851,\n1950-51. There were several of my fraternity brothers who were in as well. It was also a way to\nbe an officer and not to be drafted, not to be an enlisted person. But, and we had a summer camp\nin Tyndall Air Force Base in 1950, I guess, or \u201851. So we graduated in \u201853.",
        "Q: The reason I\u2019m asking is I\u2019m interested in your awareness of the Civil Rights movement\ndevelopments and whether you were aware of or particularly interested in what went on with\nBrown versus the Board of Education.",
        "A: Well, it was 1954, which 1s when I... 1954, I was in navigation school in Texas and I think\nclearly I must have known about it. I mean it was a big event in 1954. But you know, it wasn\u2019t\nanything that touched me overnight. And I think Houston, Texas was still pretty much a\nsegregated town. I think over the years that I was in the Air Force, from \u201954 to \u201957, and I told\nyou about the incident with Abe Jenkins. That was really early, actually when you think about it.\nThat incident on the train was 1956. And I think the Interstate Commerce Commission\neliminated that practice, and stopped the segregation in the train, at least by direction, sometime\nin the next two or three years. And things were just starting really to bubble. Because I joined\nthe Civil Rights Division in 1962. The Montgomery Freedom Rides, the bus, those things had\njust taken, they were in 1960, I think, and \u201861, maybe even the beginning of \u201859. But when I\nwent, let\u2019s see, I went to law school and my law school years were \u201859 to \u201862. I came out of the\n45\nservice in \u201857, then I went to work for the Rohm and Haas Company in Philadelphia as a\ntechnical representative for a year and a half. And I traveled Pennsylvania, New York and\nNortheastern states, selling, basically selling chemicals, but doing technical sales work, which\ninvolves developing, having some knowledge of chemistry, developing some product, I called on\nsome pharmaceutical companies. Which among others, water softening, the chemicals in water\nsoftener. Rohm and Haas manufactured something called Amberlite\u00ae resins, which when\nthey\u2019re in very microscopic size, filter water and make hard water soft. And you pour water, salt\nwater in to get the hard water, get the calcium off. And those same resins make a film and when\nyou, when you put them in water and let the water dry up you\u2019ve got clear floor polishes. And if\nyou let the chemical polymers get thicker you get all the way, you all of a sudden you have plex1-\nglass. But I worked at the Rohm and Haas during 1958 and took the law school test. So I\nentered law school in 1959. And we had, one of my classmates is now, who\u2019s now the\nChancellor of North Carolina Central, was an African-American named Julius Chambers, who\nbecame a very prominent civil rights lawyer. Really brilliant young man, who became, was\nactually first in our class. He was the editor-in-chief of the Law Review!*. And we were good\nfriends, and so the years we were in law school, I think those \u201859 to \u201862, were the first... I think\nwe had three or four African-Americans in our class. It had all... the first in North Carolina, that\nbarrier had been broken to some extent. But it was going on, and the Freedom Rides were\nhappening and I think we were all conscious of what was going on. And Julius was just an\nexemplary young man, and did a wonderful, was a great model. Worked terribly hard. We were,\nthere were a few of us who were good friends, who were friends with him. There was still... I\ndon\u2019t know that it was open hostility, because he was such a quiet guy, and who was always first\nin his class, so there wasn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think there was a lot of hostility directed towards him, as\nsuch, except the racial. I mean, people, student body from, law school students are pretty\nconservative anyway, but the students from eastern North Carolina, who were from the\nsegregated, the Black Belt of North Carolina, were certainly still not, I think, as a group,\nsympathetic to having the law school desegregated. We never had any particularly violent, any\nincidents while I was there. But anyway, I think that period, it wasn\u2019t so much when I was\nselling chemicals, I mean I was, really had, I think I was just... law school might have been in\nthe back of my mind, but in the Northeast, things were not as clear. And I was focused on my\nwork and being single and living in Philadelphia and having a good time when I wasn\u2019t working.\nAnd it was not a major kind of issue for me. It was nothing I spent my time on before I went to\nlaw school. And I think law school made you aware of that, especially in the context of my\nexperience in the military, that the South... that we had to do... you know, that things would\nhave to change in the South. They ought to change in the South, because if you were from\nplaces like Gastonia, where I grew up or you liked your hometown, and you liked being a\nSoutherner and you saw the good things that the South had to offer, that this racial situation had\nto change. It might have to be forced to make those changes. But I think I began to think about\ntrying to do something, use, having the law, using the law to help do that. I don\u2019t know that it\nwas all very clear when I first started in law school. Because I really wasn\u2019t sure... I decided to\ngo to law school only... it probably, that may have been in the back of my mind, but I think once\nI had been selling chemicals for a year, it just wasn\u2019t terribly fulfilling. Or if you\u2019re a good\nsalesperson if you like to sell and you like people and can sell anytime. You can always sell one\n'3 Julius LeVonne Chambers, 1936--. Lawyer and civil rights activist, first African-American editor-in-chief of the\nNorth Carolina Law Review.\n46\nproduct or another. I still had the G.I. Bill available and just decided that I thought that there\nmight be a good opportunity to use my head before I let my brain shrink. And so it was all those\nsort of things together. I think that Julius and the... I think that being in law school and\nremembering my experiences in the Service probably had a lot to do, it just sort of came together\nas a way of having me ultimately decide that... I mean when I first went to law school I didn\u2019t\neven know if I could get through law school because it was such a big change.",
        "Q: Why did you choose law school in particular?",
        "A: I think I wanted to, well, I wanted to use my head in a... more of an intellectual capacity. And I\nthought that, and I liked... I don\u2019t know if I took a bunch of interest tests. I wasn\u2019t so sure. I\nwas doing fine in this sales work. And I was about to be moved to New York City to take up\nwhere, a big area, Long Island, New York, where another representative was getting ready to\nretire. You know, I wish I could say, well I wanted to go to law school so I could help, so I\ncould go to work for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. But I don\u2019t think\nthat was quite the way it was. I think I wanted to go to law school because it seemed like a good\nway to... it would be a good skill to have. It would be a challenge to become a lawyer. I think I\nknew enough to know, I knew enough that the legal system was a logical way of thinking. A lot\nof people who are mathematicians or who have scientific backgrounds seem to like that. I had\nsome interest in... I say at one point I thought about even being a rabbi. And in terms of\ninterests it just seemed to fit with my general outlook on a good way to use the G.I. Bill and to\ngo back to North Carolina and go to school. It does sound kind of... I was making, I think when\nI first went to, it was a period of time when a lot of veterans were back in school. And there was\nin fact sitting, this nice educational package to do something with, for a few years if you had\nsomething in your mind. If you could afford it. If you could use it. It wouldn\u2019t pay for\neverything, but... So it seemed to me, I was single. It was kind of like... I don\u2019t know why my\nsister decided to go to law school after twenty years as an architect. I mean it was just, I think it\nwas something like that. It might be nice to change, do something different. I could always sell\nchemicals. I don\u2019t think it had anything necessarily to do with my Jewishness or the Holocaust.\nIt just was, I think I decided, I mean sales people spend their time going from, if you\u2019re traveling,\nwhether it\u2019s chemicals or something else, going from one large corporation to another, sitting in\nsomebody\u2019s waiting room until they\u2019re ready to see you, having, maybe going, having a big\nlunch, but having an hour or two discuss talking about your product and their product and how\nthey might use it and why they aren\u2019t buying as much as they ought to or whether, all the things\nabout your product that are better than the competition\u2019s. And then you go on to someplace else.\nAnd you might stay in nice hotels and eat nice big, eat lots of steaks, looking back on it. But it\nisn\u2019t particularly challenging and it\u2019s not, and you also do not become, you don\u2019t have a\ncommunity. I think that was one of the things that bothered me too, in Philadelphia when I was\nthinking back about it. I remember it bothered me back then to some extent, although I wasn\u2019t as\nconscious of that as 1am now. And that is that the people who I worked with, the executives,\nworked in Philadelphia, but they all lived in suburbia and suburban communities. And so they\nwere not at all concerned about the inner city of Philadelphia. It was not their community. And\nso I, which I think, in many of our urban areas gave really rise to the decay, to having those\ncommunities go downhill, until you found some rebirth in those communities. And that\u2019s what\u2019s\nnice, of course, about small towns, which is what I prefer anyway. But, and so I think I was not\nparticularly happy with that way of life, living down, in my sales job. I think I was looking for\n47\nsomething else to do and hadn\u2019t really... I had not, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything I had a real\nburning desire to do. And going back to school seemed like something I wanted to do, but I\nwasn\u2019t sure, probably. I didn\u2019t want to get a Master\u2019s in chemistry. I didn\u2019t think I wanted to\nspend my life... I spent three months in a research lab. That particular organization that I\nworked for was a, you know, they were an excellent company. They were very... and before\nyou even became a sales representative, you were in the labs for three months, working on\nproducts with their own laboratory people. So, you got a sense of what that life is like and what\nthey can do and the sort of support they can give, and so if you\u2019re throwing out theories about\nwhat might be possible with your product, somebody there could, would be available and that\nsort of thing. I think all of that just sort of moved, it just seemed like a good decision. And after\nall, since when I went to, if it didn\u2019t work out after a year or it didn\u2019t work out, I could always do\nsomething else. I didn\u2019t have a family attached to me. But I know, I\u2019m sure, I think that I\nremember the first couple of months here in law school I wondered what am I doing here. I was\nnot making any money anymore. (Laughing.) And just to have the G.I. Bill and a little savings.\nActually I was in the Air Force Reserve. I was in the Air Force Reserve when I was working for\nRohm and Haas in Delaware. I went down there on weekends once a month. And I suppose\nthat\u2019s a comment on... I think, I\u2019m trying to remember whether, I think I had essentially met my\nobligation. There was a little money there, but I was interested in maintaining that proficiency.\nAnd was not sort of, you know, kissing the military good bye. And I belonged to an Air Force\nReserve organization in Delaware. And kept on flying for a year or two. And then when I came\nback to law school, when I came to law school, I continued. And in part it was an income. At\nthat point it was really partly income and I was a dormitory daddy when I was in law school,\nkeeping, had all of... related to a lot of the Kentucky stuff. But I was the dormitory daddy I call\nit, for all the football players at the University of North Carolina. There are a lot of them and\nthey had a dorm full of players. And some of them were veterans as well, who were going back\nto school. At least two of those years. So, I think all of that sort of combined to see how it\nwould to go. And then I...\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\n48\nTape 4, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side B.",
        "A: But the... in law school, when you start your very first class, it often assumes you\u2019 ve already had\nseveral, all the other classes. All of law is basically so interrelated and the principles that you\napply in one course often come... are related to something in another course. So in a sense it\ndoesn\u2019t all come together till you\u2019re finished. And then you... I told my sister when she started\nstudying for the Bar, as much as I did not like taking the Bar and studying for the Bar, the Bar\nReview for the first time sort of brings all that stuff together. They don\u2019t have a comprehensive.\nI mean I don\u2019t know why, law school easily could have a comprehensive exam like Ph.D. exams,\nand then you\u2019re a lawyer. Been a lot of debate about that, but it never has come about. So, I\u2019m\nsure I, like many other students, felt pretty lost the first couple of months. And say why did I\nleave a nice good paying job in Philadelphia and come back down here and go to law school?\nBut I stuck it out and I actually got to, as I think other law students do, towards, I got to, I got to,\nenjoy may be the wrong word. But by my last year when we were doing seminars and more\nresearch and writing stuff, I enjoyed my being there. And started to see, I think, how I, that I\ncould, that it would be very challenging to be involved in the Civil Rights struggle through the\nlegal, using the law. I wasn\u2019t so sure yet. I still interviewed some firms in Atlanta. It was out\nhere, and you see the United States doing these things. There were firms in the South that were\ndoing some civil rights litigation. And actually when I interviewed with the Honors program for\nthe Department of Justice, I don\u2019t know how this... as I said, I first went to the Anti-Trust\nDivision, and I can\u2019t, don\u2019t know that I chose the Anti-Trust Division or chose the Civil Rights\nDivision. When I got to Washington and they put me in the Anti-Trust Division I asked to go to\nthe Civil Rights Division. And tried to get an interview with... I think the Civil Rights Division\nwas almost impossible to get into, because there were only... they only had about eight lawyers\nthat were doing civil rights work. And one of them was John Doar\", and he was Assistant\nAttorney General and you couldn\u2019t get a job there unless he saw you and he decided he was\ngoing to hire you. And he was in the South most of the time. And it was very hard to get in the\ndoor. And it was not a really favored section in the Department. It was so small because\nCongress didn\u2019t appropriate a lot of money yet. I mean Senator Eastland!\u00b0 and the Congress\nwas not yet really committed to putting the full force of the government behind civil rights\nlitigation. So, that\u2019s how it just sort of came together. And you know, it was logical in some\nways and it made a lot of sense to me. I just don\u2019t think I realized as I was going through law\nschool, I mean as I say, I went to Atlanta and interviewed with a couple of firms, with some\nfirms, one of which did a lot of civil rights work. And it was a small firm, and then I came back\nand I interviewed with the Department of Justice. And then my roommate and I, one of the, a\nfellow from North Carolina who I had gone through law school with, he had interviewed with\nthe Federal Trade Commission and we ended up going to Washington together and renting an\napartment. He was still a bachelor. And that\u2019s how I got my job, initially. I was with the Anti-\nTrust Division probably, maybe a month or two and then I went to work for the Civil Rights\nDivision. And I was very, very pleased to be able to go there.\n'4 John Michael Doar, 1921--. Served as First Assistant and then Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division,\nDepartment of Justice, from 1960 to 1967.\n'S James Oliver Eastland, 1904-1986. Mississippi Senator in 1941 and from 1943-1978.\n49",
        "Q: And at what point did you realize that you wanted to do civil rights work?",
        "A: Well, I think really... I don\u2019t know that in 1959 when I graduated, I mean 1962. That was, Ole\nMiss was going on. And I think Julius Chambers went to Charlotte, I think we had some very\nserious discussions about civil rights work. And it was in the papers. And I think I really did,\nwhile I was on the campus of UNC. I mean, by that time it was the foremost issue in the\ncountry. It was school desegregation, Brown. People were still not complying with Brown!\u00ae. It\nwas the Ross Barnett'\u2019, Ole Miss. It was the summer of Meredith trying to get in'\u00ae. So, and\nNorth Carolina wasn\u2019t on the forefront of desegregation efforts either. I don\u2019t think any of the\nstates were. So I think by the time that I got to Washington, I thought that I would really want to\nbe in the Division if I could get there. I think in my mind I was going to come back to the South\nto practice law. Or that I would come home at some point to North Carolina where my family\nwas living. And that I felt that what the government was doing was right. And that it would be a\ngreat opportunity to be a part of that as a Southerner. I guess you kind of feel like you\u2019re helping\nto improve the place that you live in from a position where you could do some good. I think I\nwas pretty convinced that this was not going to happen entirely voluntarily. And that it would\ntake that kind of activity to do it. Even though those were very, very small steps. The Division\nwas very small and was really... there was Meredith. Most of the work the Division was\ninvolved in involved voting rights at the time. There were very few Federal areas where the\ngovernment had the authority to intervene, besides voting. There was no legislation yet until\n1964 where anything could be done about public accommodations or employment. Housing. All\nof those were yet to come. So John Doar had accepted his position at the end of the Eisenhower\nAdministration. I think he had only been there a couple of years. He was a lawyer from\nWisconsin, a plaintiff's lawyer, who was willing to undertake this job. And then when the\nKennedys came in he was in the South, in Louisiana working. Normally they might have\nappointed... Doar was a Republican. And I think Bobby Kennedy read one of his affidavits he\nhad filed or was looking at one of the cases that he was involved in and was so impressed, he\ninterviewed him and asked him if he would stay on as First Assistant, when Burke Marshall\nbecame the Assistant Attorney General\u2019. And he said he would, so he was the boss, that I\ninterviewed with. And I think he was also somewhat attracted to the fact that I was from the\nSouth. I was also a little older and was a veteran and had done well, so he took a chance.",
        "Q: Was it hard to get an interview with him?",
        "A: Yeah, it was.",
        "Q: How did you manage it?",
        "A: I mean you just had to bang on his, you had to keep coming down. But he was traveling so much\nand I don\u2019t know whether it was part of his system. I mean it was a very small, and some people\n'6 Brown v. Board of Education: 1954 US Supreme Court decision requiring the desegregation of schools across\nAmerica.\n'7 Ross Barnett, 1898-1987.

Became first black student at University of Mississippi in 1962.\n'? Burke Marshall: Assistant Attorney General, US Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, from 1961-1964.\n50\nwould say a little bit of an elite group of people. There were several people who had worked in\nthe Division for a long time, who had been in the Department of Justice and the civil rights area,\nthe government had not been very active. We also had authority in police brutality cases already,\nbut I think generally it was not an area, it was an area where the United States attorneys who\nwere in the various states pretty well controlled. It was seen as something that the government\nwas not doing much about. Mistreatment of blacks in the South by police officers. The U.S.\nattorneys were in charge of that, and many of them were from those areas and they were just not\ngoing to do very much about it. I mean the discrimination and segregation was very blatant. In\nmany of the southern counties, there was... I mean Governor Barnett and Wallace\u201d? just defied\nthe government, said we\u2019re not going to let blacks in these universities, right. And that was the\nway the voting thing was all over the South at the time. You could not, blacks couldn\u2019t vote. If\nthey went up to try and register they\u2019d lose their jobs or their lives. So, it was very, and there\nwere very few resources that were being devoted to doing anything about it, until the Kennedy\nAdministration. And I suppose the President was still, in retrospect, was somewhat criticized.\nBut when Bobby Kennedy came in, I mean there were only, this was a very small, still a very\nsmall division. And it started growing, very small, in small numbers budgetarily. But John\nDoar\u2019s idea and I think Burke Marshall\u2019s was to do one step at a time. And we were in Southern\ncourtrooms with Southern judges and even Federal judges were oftentimes from a background,\nfrom segregated communities and were not willing to step out and enforce the law. So, when we\nfirst started we lost many of those cases, until they were appealed... our job was to... and\ngenerally the FBI in many of those communities was not sympathetic. The FBI wanted to, they\nwanted to go out and solve bank robberies. What we wanted them to do was to come with us to\na courthouse and stand there all day with a microfilm machine and photograph voting records,\nwhich we would then take back to Washington, and we would spend days and nights analyzing\nthose records. We would, because the FBI was also, most of those people from that area, they\nweren\u2019t very good about interviewing in the black community. Probably were not sympathetic\nto having those people register to vote. So, we, John developed the notion\u2014which sounds very\nsensible, but had not happened\u2014of basically going into these communities and identifying the\nblack leaders either through the NAACP\u201d! or they\u2019d go in a funeral home or they\u2019d make a\ncomplaint, or one or two people that, do you know this person, and who else, and we would meet\nwith those people and find out that yes, Arwen Donahue tried to register to vote ten years ago or\nsomebody went up to the courthouse and did try to register to vote a couple of years back. Her\nname or his name, and every once in a while you\u2019d find out that they might have let one or two\npeople register. The guy who owned the local funeral home or somebody who was well-known\nin the community, that the white business community was aware of and that the registrar was\naware of. But they would either not let them vote or register at all, because they would lose their\njobs. This job that John Doar, this case John was working on, that Kennedy had read, involved a\nfellow named Atlas\u2019 in Louisiana, who was a farmer, who raised cotton himself. He had a small\nfarm. He went up to register to vote and they found out, and they wouldn\u2019t let him. But beyond\nthat the local ginners then refused to gin his cotton. He went to a number of places, they simply,\nthey refused, they just would not gin his cotton. So, he went to Federal court to try to order them\nto gin his... to stop interfering with his right to vote. And that was how that began. But then\nJohn, I think, was up in Haywood and some of the Tennessee counties, and wherever people\n\u00b0 George Wallace, 1919-1998: Four-time Alabama Governor (1962, 1970, 1974, 1982).\n*! National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\n*2 Charles Atlas\n51\nstarted writing from, we would get some complaints. And so we would go to the communities\nand find out who tried to register and get those names. And especially if they were able to fill\nout a form. And what these Southern counties, what was going on was they were administering\na literacy test. And basically using a literacy test to deny black applicants. Teachers, people\nwho wrote very articulate constitutional sections and they would give blacks very difficult\nsections to interpret, which you and I might not be able to interpret at all. Or if they gave them\nan easier section they would turn them down. And at the same time they were registering whites\nwho were illiterate, essentially illiterate, and who wrote, and/or who wrote very\nincomprehensible answers that didn\u2019t make any sense. It didn\u2019t matter what they wrote\nbasically. And so I\u2019ve got notebooks. And we would then go back, find the records of those\npersons, and go to court and ask the black registrant applicant to testify, and they would prove,\ncould prove their literacy. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a teacher, I\u2019ve been a teacher for ten or fifteen years. I\nhave a Master\u2019s from Tougaloo College.\u201d And then we would have also found the registration\nforms of those whites who either looked as though they couldn\u2019t write or maybe even in some\ncases there were even x\u2019s. And ask that person, and would have the FBI go out and see the white\npersons and ask to show them their form and ask them to read, when they couldn\u2019t. And so we\nwould subpoena them to court, and they would show that they couldn\u2019t read or that they were\njust given help. They could testify, \u201cYes I came up and I registered. I wrote my name.\u201d \u201cWhat\nabout a constitutional section?\u201d \u201cWell, he told me to copy this and write 1t down.\u201d That kind of\nthing. And so we gradually were able to get the courts to adopt a theory that if you, that they\nhave to register blacks on the same basis they registered the least qualified white person. I don\u2019t\nknow that in those early cases, it wasn\u2019t to register illiterates, because the courts didn\u2019t want to\nregister people who were just illiterate. But if you could write, if they were accepting someone\nwho could only write their name or who could understand a very basic sentence, that that would\nbe applied across the board. But that took several years, because the courts were unwilling.\nThey would find some excuses. Or they would say \u201cWe\u2019ll register the five, we\u2019ve got to register\nthose five people who testified. I believe that\u2019s true of them, but you don\u2019t have any others here.\nWho else do you have?\u201d Well, we might not... there weren\u2019t any others because they were\nafraid to go, even though there might have been more blacks living in the county than whites.\nBut all the whites were registered and very few blacks. And that goes back to reconstruction and\nthe development of the literacy test and the poll test, tax. So, we spent our first, I spent the first\nfew years in those kinds of cases. And as we got more lawyers, and as we did those cases, the\nGreenwood... that was also the period of time when there was more, there was more action by\nSNCC and CORE. And you know, in 1964 you had the killing of the three civil rights workers\naround that very thing. They were holding voting rights meetings in Neshoba County,\nMississippi.",
        "Q: How did that work? If there were eight civil rights lawyers in the Department and then you had\nJohn Doar, who was going down into the center of things and networking with the leaders?\nWould you go along with Doar on selected cases and other lawyers on other cases? Or how did\nit actually, what did you do?",
        "A: Well, we basically, we were essentially split up geographically. We had a Mississippi section\nand an Alabama section and a Louisiana section. And I think when I came there were like four\nlawyers in each of those states, 1t might have been a few more. I shared an office with a fellow\n52\nnamed Gerald Stern\u2019\u2019, who was from Memphis and I think there were actually... for a while, and\nthen there were three or four of us and Gerry eventually went to a large law firm. Anyway, he,\nwe would be, we four would basically be assigned two or three counties and we would go down\nourselves. It was John, it was, the first few cases he tried by, he was the lawyer in the\ncourtroom, and supervised the preparation of the cases, and did much of the courtroom work.\nAnd as time went on, it was a real learning time, we did all of the spade work. And we had a\nteam of us, there were, John would have one lawyer inside the courtroom with him and one or\ntwo of us would be outside. And we would do the interviews of the witnesses. And we did all\nthis document preparation, I mean there would be several, even had a footlocker full of voting\nrights records. Very much like doing an anti-trust case. I mean it was all of their records and our\nwitnesses together proved this case of discrimination. But like, I was assigned to Green... to\nLeFlore County, Mississippi. So, I spent a great deal, I mean John couldn\u2019t learn everybody, all\nover the South. I spent a lot of time in Greenwood, Mississippi. Met all of the leaders in the\ncommunity. And there were a lot of voting marches in 1963. And they arrested a lot of, there\nwere a lot of arrests. And I went into the jail and interviewed a lot of the people who had been\narrested. And then we filed a suit to get them out of jail. There were a lot of discussions\nbetween the lawyers for LeFlore and Greenwood and me and some... John would call in, but at\none point... and then the longer we were there the more responsibility we had. Then as time\nwent on the number of lawyers went from eight to sixteen to thirty. And obviously he couldn\u2019t\ntake all the cases, so at that point I started, we were the lead trial lawyers ourselves. But I, and at\none point I had four of those cases going at once in Greenwood, Mississippi. A case involving,\nthere were voting rights cases. And then in 1964, that summer they, when the Public\nAccommodations Act came in, there were two theaters in Greenwood, the Paramount and the\nLeFlore. The LeFlore was part of a chain out of Louisiana. There was a fellow named\nMarchand, who was the manager. And the chain decided they would comply with the civil rights\nlaws and they were going to let blacks go to the movies, because they had always been upstairs.\nAnd the Paramount said no, they weren\u2019t going to let them in, they were going to challenge the\nlaw. So, when the LeFlore said they would then some blacks went into the movie. They were\nbeaten and were ejected essentially. And the police stood by. And so we filed a case in Federal\ncourt to require the police to start giving them protection and to stop this interfering and to sort\nof guarantee the safety of the blacks who would go to the movies. And then also at the same\ntime we filed a case to stop the Paramount from refusing to admit blacks. Then we had, let\u2019s see,\nthen there was another case. Greenwood is where Byron de la Beckwith, he\u2019s the one who\nkilled, shot Medgar Evers**. The lawyer who was in one of these cases represented Beckwith.\nThere was an earlier case involving a voting rights march, I spent a lot of time... there was a\nlittle community outside of Greenwood named, called Itta Bena, Mississippi. It is a very small\nfarming community that\u2019s all the Delta, cotton country. And the black section of that town was\ncalled Balance Due, sort of the story of their lives, right? And they had a voting rights, they\nwere all at a meeting in a church one night. They were at a rally, a voting rights rally. And there\nwas singing, and people were...in 1964. And someone threw a smoke bomb into the church.\n*3 Gerald Stern: Hired to Civil Rights Division under Burke Marshall in 1961.\n*4 Byron de la Beckwith (1921-2001) assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers on June 12, 1963 in Jackson,\nMississippi. Beckwith died in prison of heart problems while his case was still being appealed.\n53",
        "Q: Was this where Vernon Dahmer\u2019? was from?",
        "A: No, Dahmer was from Meridian, Hattiesburg, Mississippi. We were involved in that case. Jean\nworked on that case. In fact I have a painting, if you come by the house we got off of, we bought\nat a restaurant in Meridian. But we worked, I worked on Dahmer some. I would work on the\nthree civil rights workers case for quite a time. Anyway this voting rights thing. They arrested,\nso they decided to march up to the deputy sheriff's house to complain about this interference.\nAnd there were about sixty or seventy of these folks. And it was night time. And the next thing\nyou know, they arrested them all, and took them all to jail, from like fifteen year olds to seventy\nyear olds. There were a couple of very old people, several old people. And the next morning\nthey tried them in groups of four for disturbing the peace. And I sat through those trials. He sent\nthem all, he convicted them in groups. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers and so he convicted them\nall in groups for disturbing the peace. And they sent them to the state penitentiary. And so, we\nfiled a court action to try to get them out. And it was called the United States against LeFlore\nCounty. And I worked on, I went to that penitentiary every day for a couple of weeks to\ninterview people. It was a very long delayed proceeding. And actually the Federal judge said\nthat we should have, that he would not interfere with this arrest because it was a state law matter,\nthis disturbing the peace. So, we eventually got the National Council of Churches to put up\nenough bond to get most of them... they did let some of the older people out in a few days. But\nit was a horrendous thing. I\u2019ve forgotten the name of this Justice of the Peace. It will come, I\ncould remember it. But I remember going to the penitentiary every day. The guy\u2019s name was\nArterberry, the warden. He had this huge Great Dane that I did not like at all. But it was sort of\nthe climate, you know, here they are, they arrest all these... they really weren\u2019t doing anything.\nThey were complaining about this smoke bomb. So we brought this action complaining about\ntheir interfering with their right to vote. It was not really the most successful thing we had ever\ndone. I think we should have won the case, but we didn\u2019t. And we did eventually get them out\nof jail with the help of the Kentucky Council of Churches, I mean the National Council of\nChurches. That was probably \u201863, I guess. The LeFlore theater cases, which we eventually won,\nI felt really... this man, Marchand, had worked for this theater chain all his life. And they really\njust... as the result of his doing what his bosses told him to do, they just ostracized that man in\nthe community. I mean they thought it was like he was the one who was responsible for\neverything, for having done this. That he should have quit the job or said, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it\nhere. Whites are going to quit going to the theater.\u201d\u201d He was this nice man, who had lived there\nall of his life. His whole life was the movie theater and people coming to the movies, and\neverybody knew him and liked him. And his life was decimated over that incident. Greenwood\nwas a very, you know there was a lot of civil rights activity all summer long there.",
        "Q: Can you name some of the leaders who you worked with?",
        "A: Well you know, that was, you know the SNCC headquarters was there and Stokely Carmichael\u201d\u00b0\nand Bob Moses\u2019, who\u2019s now up in Boston, I understand. And I\u2019ve been meaning to try to\n2\u00b0 Vernon Dahmer, 1908-1966. Born in Forrest County, Mississippi; businessman and community leader. Served\nseveral terms as president of the Forrest County chapter of the NAACP. Led voter registration drives in the 1960s.\nIn 1966, his home was firebombed, and Dahmer was killed. In 1998, KKK leader Sam Bowers was convicted of the\nkilling and sentenced to life in prison.\n54\ncontact him because he\u2019s developed a system for teaching math to inner city kids and algebra,\napparently, that is very successful. That\u2019s, it totally changed, in changing his life. I spent some\ntime with Medgar Evers**, not much. He was in, he wasn\u2019t in LeFlore County, but I had met\nhim. And after he was killed... I had actually been to his house not too long before that. There\nwas a recent issue in a magazine of The Washington Post, which the writer had sent to me. And\nthere was a fellow named Willie McGee, who was either on the cover or on the inside section of\nthat... I mean I guess there was a young woman named June Johnson. Fannie Lou Hamer was in\nSunflower County\u201d\u2019. I don\u2019t know if you ever saw that, but there is a one woman play about the\nlife of Fannie Lou Hamer. She\u2019s a woman who grew up on a farm and became a real strong\nvoting rights activist. And one of the first cases I ever worked on involved a situation where\nFannie Lou Hamer and June Johnson and a beautiful woman named Annelle Ponder. June was\nthen about fifteen or sixteen, I think. And there was another young man. They had been to a\nvoting rights workshop in Atlanta and they were coming home to, well they were coming home.\nAnnelle was coming back with them, because she lived in Atlanta, but Ms. Hamer was over in\nSunflower County and June Johnson was in Greenwood. And the bus stopped in Winona,\nMississippi which had a bus station. Winona is in Alabusha County*\u2019. Anyway it was on the\nmain road south and they got off the bus and wanted to get a Coke. And went into the restaurant,\nwhich had... and they called the, the restaurant owners called the police and the local police\ncame and arrested them off the bus. Came and arrested them and took them to jail and beat\nthem, and... in the jail. Couple of officers beat them.

        "Q: This is tape number five, side A of an interview with John Rosenberg. You filed a police\nbrutality case?",
        "A: Yeah, against those police officers. And one of the... 1t was difficult to prove who did the\nbeating, or that there was, other than from the blacks having said they were beaten. They beat,\nactually beat, Mrs. Hamer had a hip injury. She had worked in the cotton fields for some reason\nand they even, she was on a bunk and they hit her. But the FBI had not found any witnesses and\nwe knew there was a trusty in the jail, who was actually a black man, who played a guitar and\nwho was sort of in and out of that jail because he drank. But we knew he was there a lot. And\nthey said they could not locate him, as was the case often. And I remember that I found him,\nfinally through talking to members in the black community, I learned where he lived. And I\neventually went out to see him and it happened to be on the day President Kennedy was killed in\n1963. It was raining like cats and dogs and I was still in the local hotel. And I went out to find\nand I found the trusty, this trusty. And he identified the officers from the pictures I had. And\nthen he told me that he had, that after they had beaten these young black, well they were really\nquite... men and women, that Mrs. Hamer, I guess, was on a cot then. That after they were\nthrough and put them back in their cells, they told him to mop the blood off the floor, which he\ndid. And he testified to that, to his everlasting credit. But the jury was an all-white jury and they\nacquitted them on a Friday afternoon in a very short period of time. The jury went out, the\nfellow who put the case on was named St. John Barrett, who was the Second Assistant of the\nCivil Rights Division, who is a good friend of mine*\u2019. And it was, we did have the U.S.\nAttorney, H.M. Ray, at the table, which was something new. He was at least there. He was a\npresence. But the government had not yet begun a policy of challenging juries there, so there\nwas an acquittal. And I then had to... I drove over to Sunflower County to see Mrs. Hamer\nafterwards, I think. I don\u2019t know if they were still there during the acquittal. I always feel badly\nand I think St. John Barrett, whose nickname is \u201cSlim,\u201d who 1s still practicing law, never really\nforget that acquittal of that really horrible action. You know, it was just very blatant and such a\ncommentary on the way things still were in 1963. You couldn\u2019t get a white jury, even in a\nFederal court, to convict on that set of facts. But we had brought the case, and that was only a\nyear, well it was a few years later, of course, that the civil rights worker trial went off. And that\nwas an all-white jury, too.",
        "Q: Do you remember, before you go on to that, how Mrs. Hamer was afterwards when you visited\nher?",
        "A: Well, she was a very remarkable woman, I thought. And I read an autobiography about her not\ntoo long ago. She grew up on a farm and was not a very well-educated person, but she was a\nvery, became a very fiery person, and spoke at the Democratic National Convention. I mean I\nthink she was very disappointed. I think there was a lot of criticism by the activist blacks at the\ntime, not just in this case, about why the government wasn\u2019t doing more. And so I think she sort\nof took this loss as one of many losses along the way. There was a voting rights case in\nSunflower County...you know, we were lawyers who spent a lot of time in the community, but\nwe would go back to Washington. And one of the demands that was never met and probably\n3! St. John Barrett served in the Civil Rights Division from 1957-1967.\n56\nrightly so, was the blacks wanted more protections. They wanted federal marshals when they\nwent to register. And they wanted more lawyers, and Congress wasn\u2019t going to do that. And\nthere was still the question of how much, what do the states do and what the federal government\ndoes and the evolving law. And I think SNCC, we, oftentimes those of us who were there in our\ncoats and ties and with our federal ID badges, some of the more activist people thought we were\njust sort of window dressing. And you know, it was not the same as direct action. And\neventually I think Martin Luther King certainly demonstrated that marching and non-violence\nwas the key to success. That mobilizing blacks themselves, in the march in Selma... I mean I\nthink all of these things that were going on were part of the big picture. I think the Division had\na very prominent role, a very pronounced role that isn\u2019t always recognized. Not just because I\nwas there, because I think we demonstrated that the court, that using the court system was\nextremely slow and wasn\u2019t going to answer this... that we could win one little case at a time, but,\nand that was doing some good. And we were starting to... that that was helping. And it also\ngave blacks some confidence to win. But for the broader picture to change, we also helped write\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965. That Congress... you had to do more than that. And I think the\ncivil rights, I think in a lot of these struggles, things like whether it\u2019s the Wall coming down or\nwhatever it is, someone, it always seems to take an incident like the civil rights workers\u2019 death**\nto wake people up, unfortunately. I mean it\u2019s, there are mining disasters that cause the mine\nsafety laws to come in. The three... the publicity in Selma, in Birmingham with the water hoses.\nIt all, I think, helped mobilize the country to change things. We started, I mean I think the\nconviction of the civil rights workers in 1964, which took a great deal of help by this all-white\njury in Mississippi and by, where you had a presiding federal judge, who was clearly a\nsegregationist: Senator Eastland\u2019s roommate, Judge Cox*?. I think he said, \u201cThis is enough, and\nhe\u2019s going to have a fair trial.\u201d And that was a little step along the way. It took a great deal of\nwork.",
        "Q: I have a couple of questions. When you were talking about the case that you worked on in which\nFannie Lou Hamer and June Jordan [sic] and the others were beaten in jail. Your exact role in\nthat was, were you the only lawyer working on that?",
        "A: I was the, really the investigating lawyer. I hadn\u2019t been in the Division that long and so I was, I\nguess you would call, that\u2019s what you would call it. I spent the time in the field and interviewed\nthese folks and got the case pretty much ready for trial. And St. John Barrett was the trial lawyer\nand I assisted him with putting it on and was in the courtroom. I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think I examined\nany of the witnesses in that case. But being in Mississippi I sort of would have written the\nrequest for investigation by the FBI with John. And I went down and was the contact, and\ninterviewed all these people who were eventually to testify and others in the community. And\nsort of put the case together. I mean that was the way we normally did all those cases. Over\ntime that\u2019s also how we learned who the people were in the black community. I mean we did\n2 In 1964 three civil rights workers were murdered by members of the KKK in Neshoba county, Mississippi. The\ncase infamously became known as the Mississippi Burning trial, which began in 1967. Chief Prosecutor John Doar\nsucceeded in securing convictions for seven of the eighteen defendants; none spent more than ten years in prison.\n33 William Harold Cox (1901-1988), federal district judge who presided over Mississippi Burning trial. An ardent\nsegregationist, Cox was appointed to federal bench by President Kennedy to appease Eastland, Cox\u2019s former college\nroommate.\n57\nhave very good contacts all over the state, in all these counties where we worked. And I think\nthat was very helpful.",
        "Q: Did you spend time with them socially?",
        "A: Oh, I probably had, I had quite a few meals in various, you know, they were like country people\neverywhere. We did not go out together. I went to a lot of church... meetings in churches. Did\na lot of observing also, I mean sometimes when there were marches... I\u2019ve got some photos I can\nshow you that I still have from, like from Louisiana. I spent a summer in Bogalusa, where the\nKlan had been taking a lot of action, was upset because, initially because a relatively moderate\ncongressman had been invited to come to speak: Brooks Hays**. And the Klan rallied. And they\nthreatened to boycott stores that were going to sell to blacks. And there were a number of civil\nrights marches during the summer, that summer with James Farmer and others*\u2019. And I was,\nspent the summer there, basically observing marches, interviewing people and getting the facts\ntogether for an action that we were, eventually filed against the Klan in federal court to get an\ninjunction against them from doing, interfering any further. Again it was tied to voting and to\npublic accommodations and employment. So in many of these cases in those earlier years I had\na... my immediate boss was a fellow named Bob Owen, who was from Texas and who passed\naway a few years ago*\u2019. He was involved in some of those trials. He was in charge of\nMississippi. There was somebody in charge of Mississippi, somebody in charge of Alabama and\nsomebody... Bob had gone to the University of Texas Law School. He had gone to Princeton.\nHe grew up on a farm also, in Texas. Wonderful man. So, essentially in those early years, the\nFBI had not been very effective. Things really changed after the civil rights workers incident.\nAfter that, they moved a lot of agents from other parts of the country to Mississippi and Alabama\nand began to use agents who did not live and grow up in those areas to investigate civil rights\nmatters. Is that... I can\u2019t remember what the question was. I think I\u2019m a little punchy, from this\nfour o\u2019clock in the morning thing.",
        "Q: (Laughing.) I was asking you about your role in the, in that particular trial. I\u2019m not sure if I\nasked you a question after that or not.",
        "A: Oh, you asked me about, yeah, about the June Johnson, the case in Winona. That was the way\nwe generally did our... and the bigger cases like this three civil rights workers case, there were\nmany of us who...",
        "Q: The Neshoba County...",
        "A: The Neshoba County case, there were a number of us who did investigative work, both in the\nblack community... we had a lot of FBI agents. And initially the Bureau reports turned up a lot\nof other examples of police brutality. And when we convened the first grand jury, there were\nsome indictments about other cases, not involving the three civil rights workers, because there\nwas not yet any clear confession to who had done that or what had happened. The grand jury,\n34 Lawrence Brooks Hays, 1898-1981. Representative from Arkansas 1943-1959. Special Assistant to President of\nthe U.S. from 1961-1964.\n3\u00b0 James Farmer, 1920-1999. Civil rights leader and advocate for non-violent social action.\n3\u00b0 Bob Owen, 1930-1981. Served in the Civil Rights Division from 1958 to 1969.\n58\nthat one or the second one... I was in, it was sitting in Oxford and I was interviewing people and\nputting them on a plane from Jackson to Oxford to the grand, where they were testifying. We\ndid a lot of, but our, we as lawyers did a lot of investigative work, especially in the black\ncommunity, because the level of trust was a lot bigger. Because the whites... the Bureau in\nthose earlier days was not, made it pretty plain, I think, that they were not sympathetic to the\ncivil rights struggle, or some of them did. Others were, the one in Meridian, the FBI agent in\nMeridian, Mississippi was actually a very fine man, who was very much involved in that\ninvestigation from the beginning.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember his name right now. I mean it\u2019s in my notes somewhere. And there was\na television movie made about it, which was pretty accurate, which put him in the correct light.\nThe Mississippi Burning, which so many people have seen, which was sort of a fictionalized\naccount and always said it didn\u2019t attempt to be accurate. When I have given these talks from\ntime to time and they always say, \u201cWhat happened? Is this the way it was?\u201d And it wasn\u2019t, I\ndon\u2019t think that was really the way the FBI normally acted. I thought that the picture depicted\nthe hostility of whites quite well at the time. But my role in that, besides investigating, I spent\nabout a month trying to put together, putting together a notebook on the background of the\njurors. You know, the jury list was like sixty or seventy people we knew from which the eleven\njurors would be chosen.",
        "Q: Are you talking about the Neshoba County case?",
        "A: Yeah, in fact Jean and I had just gotten married and we came back from our honeymoon. And it\nwas right before the trial of this case and so I, I said I really want to go. So I did. And that\u2019s\nwhat I spent the month doing before the trial, interviewing. Today they have all these very fancy\njury experts. They even practice trials in front of a jury to see how a practice jury would do\nthings, especially in the civil cases, not so much the criminal cases. And then I spent a lot of...\nso I did that.",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious about, when you talk about interviewing the jurors. How did you, what did you do?\nDid you take notes? What was your method?",
        "A: Well, you wouldn\u2019t go see the juror. You\u2019d go see people you trusted who might know the\njurors. \u201cDo you know, who 1s this person? Who are they related to? How long have they lived\nhere? How would you expect them to, would you expect them to be fair? Have you, are they a\nmember of the citizens\u2019 council? Who do they employ?\u201d Many of those forms, I mean today if\nyou go, if you\u2019re going to be selected for jury duty, you fill out a form which gives out a fair\namount of very basic information that everybody has access to. And... where you work, that\nkind of thing. This is a way of trying to put together a picture about a juror without contacting\nthe juror directly and trying to be somewhat respectful of the juror and also, not to infringe on\nanybody\u2019s rights, but simply trying to learn as much as you can. Some things are public\ninformation. I mean back then those were, systems were just being developed and we had a jury\nthat had some blacks on them. And there were some members of the, say you have to identify in\nNeshoba County in those communities, from... which was fairly large, the federal jury was from\n59\na larger geographical area. And you make some decisions about paring down these numbers,\nabout which jurors, somebody from Jackson may be from a large metropolitan area and president\nof this company or that company, that you may not spend as much time on. But I assembled a\nnotebook for John, who was going to try the case, so when he got ready to challenge jurors...\nyou have so many preemptory jurors. I mean suppose, it may not be initially apparent, but from\ntalking to people and identifying folks, you might find that a particular juror is distantly related\nto somebody, one of the defendants. Or that his daughter is married to somebody\u2019s son, who\nworks for... and when the judge says, asks the jury, \u201cAre you related to anyone who is being\ndefended?\u201d Normally if you are, you\u2019re not going to be on that jury. Well, if you\u2019re not being\nforthright, if you have some information that gives the lawyer, like John, the opportunity to ask a\nquestion about it. And then lawyers have their own hunches about... every trial lawyer has their\nown... John always said he wouldn\u2019t like, didn\u2019t want jurors that wore white socks. I don\u2019t\nknow why. I\u2019m wearing white socks today. It was a thing, might have come from his accident\ncases. I don\u2019t know if he even lived, whether that was something he really, always... I\u2019m sure\nthat he used my notebook, primarily. But that was... I did some other work, I mean, other\ninvestigative work in the case, but I interviewed lots of other people. But that was something\nI\u2019ve always been proud of, because we got a conviction. We did get a jury that convicted a\nnumber of these people.",
        "Q: That was in 1967. Is that right?",
        "A: Yeah, the case had happened in 1964, but the delay, the defendants challenged the legality of the\nindictment under federal law. So, the case actually went to the United States Supreme Court on\nthe legal question. This was not a murder conviction. You know, it was a... they were charged\nwith conspiring to deprive the defendants of their civil rights. It\u2019s a federal conspiracy charge.\nThere was an issue of whether that was a crime, because it involved private individuals as well as\nsome law enforcement. And the Supreme Court in that case said, yes it was a crime. And so\nthen, all that took time, so it wasn\u2019t until 1967 that the trial actually took place. And when I left,\none of the last things that I did in 1970 when we left, was to write a brief. They were about to\nbe, they were still trying to prevent them from their arrest. They were still raising legal\nquestions. And I think that... and we were successful in resisting the objections and they finally\nthen took the people who had been convicted \u2014 they weren\u2019t all convicted \u2014 to jail, where they\nserved their time. And I understand that they are today, finally, what is this? 1999? Thirty-two\nyears later they are thinking about charging them with murder, convening a state grand jury\nfinally. As they did in the Beckwith case.\u00b0\u2019",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t they do that at the time?",
        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t do it because the state of Mississippi was not going to take any, I think, serious\naction in racial cases. There were just too much, the officials were unwilling to risk their\npolitical life. I mean, people in Mississippi, I think very substantial numbers still thought these\nwere outsiders who had come in to tell them what to do. They were not sympathetic to\nregistering blacks. \u201cThey should have stayed home. They had it coming to them.\u201d All that kind\n37 In 1999, the state of Mississippi reopened the investigation into the Mississippi Burning case. In 2001, however,\none of the key figures in the case, former Neshoba County Deputy Sheriff and Klansman Cecil Price, died of head\ninjuries. Price\u2019s death was considered a \u201ctragic blow\u201d to the case.\n60\nof sorts of terrible ideas, but it was, but that was... you know, they called it Freedom Summer.\nThey had these workshops, students from all over the country in 1964 were there. And that was\nwhy I was in Mississippi when it happened. Some of us happened to be there. I was in\nGreenwood, I believe when this went on in Neshoba County.",
        "Q: You were in Greenwood during the time of the murder, the disappearance?",
        "A: Right. My friend Frank Schwelb*\u00ae, who is now a judge in the D.C. Circuit, was the lawyer, I\nthink, who was actually in Neshoba County, and called John, these sort of things were\nhappening. I don\u2019t know that... I don\u2019t think that I went over there right away. Because the FBI\nwas out and they were trying to find the bodies. I was involved in some matters in LeFlore\nCounty, but I was in Mississippi. All of us were there during the summer in one way or another.",
        "Q: Were you ever personally threatened or did you feel personally threatened, being there?",
        "A: I\u2019ve been asked that a lot. I really didn\u2019t, I think we, because we were Justice Department people\nand generally people knew who we were. After that I never felt really in danger, particularly\nafter the Neshoba killings, we started always driving together... in Neshoba County, at least, in\npairs, being together with another person who was working. Before that we were always,\ngenerally, by ourselves.",
        "Q: Were you armed?",
        "A: No. I never carried a weapon. I was in a, in a registrar\u2019s office once in Yazoo County,\nMississippi. And I was with a team of FBI agents, photographing voting records. And the\nregistrar\u2019s name was \u201cFoot\u201d Campbell. While they were photographing records, I went 1n his\noffice and we were talking about a variety of things and he related to me that he had witnessed\nsome lynchings. And I don\u2019t know why... and I wasn\u2019t going to try that case, I was just there\nwith the FBI. And he got started talking and then he said, \u201cJohn, let me show you something.\u201d\nAnd he pulled this gun out of his drawer and he shot his pistol into the floor in front of me. And\nI said, \u201cWell, why did you do that?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell I just wanted to show you the gun\nworked.\u201d It was very odd. He shot a big hole in his floor. I think he was a little demented\nanyway. But it was the only time I know that... and he wasn\u2019t aiming at me. But all these\nagents came in. Everybody heard this terrible noise in this old courthouse and came running in\nto see what had happened. And he said, \u201cWell I just wanted to show John this gun worked.\u201d But\nI never really was in fear, at least I don\u2019t recall. I think we all knew that we were in such a\ndifferent situation from the people who we were working with. I mean the blacks, who were so\nvulnerable, who were by themselves, who had to really display such courage just to go register to\nvote. We met so many wonderful people, these farmers, local citizens, who simply wanted to go\nregister, to exercise their right to vote. I think you were mentioning what we were talking about\nthe other day, how apathetic people are about voting today. It\u2019s just quite... when you think\nabout it, I mean I think that always, you just couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by these folks, who\nwere, many of them were just hard-working people, who wanted to have the same opportunities\nor just to have the same right as everyone else. I mean it seems so very simple. I will always\nremember a fellow named Eskridge. There was a farmer named William Eskridge in Carroll\n38 Frank Schwelb worked with the Civil Rights Division from 1962-1979.\n61\nCounty, Mississippi, who was really a very bright, articulate man, who lived in a farm, worked a\nfarm that he owned, way out, by himself, out in a very isolated part of the county. And they\nwanted their son to go to, to get a decent education and were willing to enroll him in a white\nschool, a previously all-white school. And we went to court to desegregate the school. One of\nthe earliest cases that the government filed. There had been other school desegregation cases,\nbut the United States didn\u2019t have the authority prior to 1964 to initiate school desegregation\ncases. We could only do voting cases. And we were able to... and whenever I went to see him,\nwhich was many, many times, I just always marveled at how isolated they were, and his\nwillingness and his drive, just and his very simple desire to see the son go. We had an expert\ncome in, and the black school was horrible. It was the same picture as it was with the voting\nthing. They were in this old, rundown building with a pot-bellied stove. I don\u2019t remember\nwhether there was running water or not. But it was just an incredible contrast. And actually he, I\nthink he might have been registered. Everybody knew him. Everybody knew him. And he had\na very good reputation among the white community and maybe that was why he was not so\nafraid. I mean he had a very nice personality and he was obviously pretty bright...\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\n62\nTape 5, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number five, side B.",
        "A: Well, I just, you know, I think it\u2019s something that we saw repeatedly. It\u2019s been probably eight or\nnine years, but a fellow, one of the people who worked... well he didn\u2019t work on that case,\nanother lawyer who became a judge, Nick Flannery, worked on that case with me*\u2019. But one of\nour friends went by to see him maybe eight or nine years ago. I think he\u2019s died now. Did he die\nrecently? Jean and I went to Holmes, went to one of those counties, no, two or three years back\nand went to see him. He\u2019s probably in his eighties now.",
        "Q: This is the father of the child who...?",
        "A: Right. He had afterwards gotten involved in some Mississippi politics for a while and the\nFreedom Democratic Party. I don\u2019t think he ever ran for office. I always thought he should. But\nthere\u2019s not much more to that other than... we won, the judge ordered them to allow his child to\ngo, Judge Clayton, to enter that grade. And we sort of stayed in touch with each other for some\ntime afterwards both in connection with that case, and whenever I would drive... and whenever I\nwent to Mississippi after a while you get to know some of these people and if you wanted to\nlearn about what was going on in the community or whether there were some other incidents we\nought to be aware of, those were the sort of people who called you.",
        "Q: Did you say his name?",
        "A: It was William Eskridge. I don\u2019t know about the son. Did we meet the son who he was in\nschool with? Actually I have some pictures at home. It was not maybe three years ago. The\nreason I said he died, I think somebody told me. One of the school classes in Holmes County,\nwhich is nearby, one of the high schools did a little project, they put a booklet together on sort of\noral histories about black leaders in their area a few years ago. And it made its way to one of the\nlegal services people who was living there. And they sent it to me and there was an interview of\nMr. Eskridge, who recalled the case we did. I guess that\u2019s really about it, except about, on this\nthing... we just saw those situations repeated over and over. Every county went to wherever the\ngovernment was involved. And today in legal services, I mean whenever you have a movement\nor you have an issue like this, someone is going to, or some group is going to try, is going to\nstand out initially to see, try to help people get justice, or to see that the right result comes about.\nSo, you have leaders like, you may never hear about Mr. Eskridge in Carroll County. You might\nhear about some of the more prominent, you probably hear about Mrs., some of the people, who\nwent to the national scene, like Aaron Henry in Clarksdale, Mississippi, who was President of\nthe NAACP, also*\u00ae. Who\u2019s a very prominent figure and who continued to be a prominent figure\nafter these, in later days when the Voting Rights Act was passed and blacks did get the right to\nvote. Then if you go to Mississippi today, you see the number of black legislators, who are in\nthe Mississippi legislature. And that you had some part in, you see how far it\u2019s come. So there\nare a lot of unsung heroes, I think, like Mr. Eskridge, in all these cases.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Nick Flannery served in Civil Rights Division from 1958 to 1970.\n9 Aaron Henry, 1922-1977. Became Mississippi state president of the NAACP in 1959.\n63",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you kind of a general question. I\u2019m going to try to phrase it clearly, but it might\nnot... take a little while. You mentioned something earlier about living in the South and how\nyou wanted to live in the South and in a way you were proud of being a Southerner and you were\naware of the things that were good and were motivated to be there because of that... to change\nsome of the things that were not as good. I have kind of the idea that so many Northerners and\nmaybe particularly Jews, who lived in the North, felt that the South was backwards and\ncontrolled by the Klan and there would be too much anti-Semitism and too much maybe lack of\nculture or something, putting it crudely or maybe over-exaggerating. But I\u2019m wondering what it\nwas that you saw about living in the South that was so positive, that made yourself identify as a\nSoutherner and motivated you in this whole endeavor?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s the same to some extent what you see in small towns. I think\u2014or the rural areas\u2014\nyou get this, I mean 1n a simplistic way, the idea that people accept you for who you are. As a\nsalesman I always used to say in the South 1f you have a customer, they\u2019re going to initially\nassume you are telling the truth and will take you, at face value, what you say, and will welcome\nyou in, and be happy to spend the time of day. And if you are fair with them, you can have a\nlong lasting relationship as you would with anyone else. Whereas, if you were in the urban areas\nof the North, and then again this is very simplistic and probably not true in the sense that you can\ngeneralize, but I\u2019m sure it indicates some of the way that I think and others think. In the\nNorthern, when I was selling chemicals, I think in the North people say \u201cThis guy is a salesman,\nhe\u2019s out to get us and he\u2019s going to be a con man or con woman of one sort or another.\u201d And\nthey have a much harsher attitude. And maybe because these towns are, these cities are so big,\nare not interested normally in forming another relationship and welcoming someone from\nanother place that has nothing to do with where they live. I think the camaraderie of\ncommunities, the fact that people are, whether it is a slower pace. People do have an interest in\nwhere they live and in making it, and in the sense of place where they are. I think that\u2019s maybe\ntrue of smaller communities across the board. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s true in New Hampshire and Vermont\nand in smaller places up North, but it was true of the South. Much has been written about the\nSouth, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with literature of the South. And I think there is some of that\ncommonality. It\u2019s like when I was in the Civil Rights Division, being a Southerner, itself, was\nprobably helpful... 1t was helpful, I\u2019m sure in many ways, especially in dealing with white\nofficials. I mean not that you would necessarily be their buddy, but they sure couldn\u2019t... There\u2019s\nsomething about being able to say, \u201cOh you\u2019re from way up there in New York or you\u2019re from...\nyou don\u2019t belong here.\u201d I mean, the South, I\u2019m not proud of the Confederacy, but it\u2019s part of its\nhistory. And to that extent, I think that\u2019s why... I mean I like the tradition and the atmosphere\nand the welcoming of those communities, they were... with my family. We were strangers in\nthis county, in Spartanburg and in Gastonia, and it became our home. And I think that it made a\ngreat deal of difference. And I suppose, I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t read as much about that, but we\nhad many associations and many more friends who were not Jewish than the ones who were,\nprobably because of our, because of the economics of the situation. I mean in a sense you have a\nsort of a class system, keeping up with the Joneses. Those people were well off and they were\nfriends in the synagogue and were always very nice, but we weren\u2019t... they would, you know, go\nto Florida, or they would travel, and do things that my family, my parents didn\u2019t do, because we\ncouldn\u2019t afford it, because they weren\u2019t interested in it. So, I think that\u2019s the way itis. I mean,\nit\u2019s the same way I feel about being here in some ways. Been here almost thirty years and it\u2019s\nbecome home. And I think the people here share that same kind of feeling about their place and\n64\ntheir community, and Appalachia, it\u2019s different than North Carolina, but it\u2019s the same sort of\nenvironment.",
        "Q: Did your work change a whole lot after the Civil Rights Act passed?",
        "A: In the Division? Well, we had more work in more areas. And after I worked in the Deep South,\nI became a Chief of what was called the Western Section. I started doing some cases in Texas\nand in Nevada. I litigated a case against the Electrical Workers Union in Las Vegas, believe it or\nnot. They didn\u2019t want to let blacks, who were electricians, into the union. Steel workers in Los\nAngeles. In my section in Texas, I didn\u2019t have any... well, I did, spent the last two years or three\nyears 1n a case against the Houston school system. A big desegregation case involving the\nHouston school system. We moved to Houston for several months, prepared this case that I\ntried. But it had been an ongoing case in Houston. And then I was also, I guess I became the\nChief of what is known as the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division. Which is the\nsection that has responsibility for the police brutality cases, these conspiracy cases like the civil\nrights workers. I didn\u2019t, I was in charge of that and had a group of lawyers working with me and\nfor me and the FBI. And the last thing I did was direct an investigation into the Kent State case.\nBut that\u2019s about the time I left, so I didn\u2019t really get involved in very many more trials. The\nHouston case took a couple of years, off and on. I think I was actually the... was I the Chief of\nthe Western Section? Maybe part of it was still going on when I was Chief of the Criminal\nSection. In all these, by that time the Division had gotten a lot bigger and it was sort of a re-\norganization and I had eight or ten lawyers working under me. And we were doing cases around\nthe United States. After the Civil Rights Act and then the Voting Rights Act was 1965, then I\nwas in what we called the Southeastern section, that was Alabama and Louisiana. And I did\nspend some time in Louisiana working on the, when they first brought in federal observers to\nwatch elections, because under the Voting Rights Act people could register automatically by\nsigning their name. In those southern states were covered by that. Then in 1964, the case that\nJean was talking about, we had a case in Selma, Alabama, which was the first... I\u2019m sorry it was\n1965. It was the first case under the Voting Rights Act in Selma, where they were still using\npaper ballots. And it was the first election in which black officials, where blacks had been\nappointed to be election officials. And it was very interesting. Jim Clark, who was the Sheriff of\nSelma and had been such a repressive force in Selma, was running for re-election. There was a\nmoderate named Wilson Baker.*! The election officials who were black had never done that and\nthey were counting all these ballots and they wanted to be sure, they were trying to be careful.\nAnd it was taking them a very long time to finish counting the ballots at the end of the day. And\nall the boxes had come back in from the white precincts. And so the executive committee met,\nwhich was an all-white, democratic executive committee and they decided they would impound\nall of the... there must be something wrong, these people are taking too long. There must be\nsome sort of fraud going on. So they went out and impounded all those ballots. And the next\nday decided that they would, the fair thing to do is not to count the ballots in those boxes at all,\njust leave them out as a group, which had the effect of not counting probably ninety-five percent\nof the black ballots that had been cast. So we filed an action under the Voting Rights Act to\nrequire them to count those ballots. We went to federal court and we got a judge named, whose\n*! On May 3, 1966, Jim Clark and Wilson Baker competed to become Sheriff of Dallas County, Alabama. Baker\nwas the police chief of Selma at the time. This race was the first primary election held after the passage of the\nVoting Rights Act.\n65\nname was Thomas\u201d, who had refused to desegregate the Mobile County, Louisiana schools.\nEach year he\u2019d do just a little tiny bit and we\u2019d, the government would appeal. The next year the\nCourt of Appeals would tell him to do something more and he would only do a little tiny bit. So,\nhe effectively kept them from being desegregated. But when we put this case on and I tried this\ncase and John, for a change, John told me the day before the trial, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try\nthis case, John?\u201d We had been putting it together. He was my assistant, if you will. (Laughing. )\nThe objections, some objections, I put the case on and he did the opening and he also did the\nclosing. He did a very nice job. And Judge Thomas said that, he required them to count them.\nAnd he said, \u201cYou should not deprive a voter of his right to vote based on what might be a\ntechnical mistake by an election official. And we showed that all the ballots were in the boxes.\nThere was no fraud. The number of people who signed in to vote equaled the number of ballots.\nThere might have been one or two slight differences, but basically we proved that all the ballots\nwere there and what they were doing was perfectly good. There was no reason not to count\nthem. So he ordered them to be counted and the result was that Jim Clark was out. We didn\u2019t\nfile the action to get Jim Clark declared ineligible or anything. We filed the suit under the\nVoting Rights Act, in order to have those votes counted as they ought to be counted, so that their\nright to vote was protected and their vote would be counted. But it was the end of Jim Clark as\nan elected official in the county. So, I was always very pleased to have participated in that case.",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: That was 1960, probably 1966. I'd say \u201865, I think the decision was in \u201866. Because the Voting\nRights Act was passed in 1965, which really changed everything. I mean, across the South there\nwere black sheriffs, in these counties that had more blacks than whites or heavy black counties. I\nthink it was really probably the most important legislation in many ways passed anywhere.\nBecause it really gave blacks the right to vote and changed the political process.",
        "Q: Did you have anything to do with writing that legislation, the Voting Rights Act?",
        "A: I, I mean it wasn\u2019t me personally, the Division, the lawyers in the Division, John and our\nappellate section, Burke Marshall, who was at that time not the Assistant Attorney General, but\nhe was still very... became a professor at Yale. But the lawyers in the Division and in the\nhierarchy of the Department of Justice... some of that language, some of that Act was based on\nthe court cases that we had bought. It said if a certain percentage of voters had not voted and if\nthey used a test or device, like a literacy test, if these various criteria were met then it triggered\nthe application of the Voting Rights Act. And if that was triggered, the registration process then\ninvolved, meant that they had to allow everyone to register by a very simple procedure. And if\nthey weren\u2019t going to do that at the courthouse, they could do it where the federal observers\nwere. Or that they did it in the courthouse with federal observers looking on. It is a forced\nprocess that covered virtually the entire South. There was a challenge to the legality of that, that\nwent to the United States Supreme Court, which was upheld. I think United States versus\nLouisiana. Well no, it wasn\u2019t Louisiana. Then there was also, I was involved with the poll tax.\nThe Southern states used poll taxes to prevent blacks from voting for many years. And so I filed\nan action in Mississippi and then I helped the Assistant Attorney General and put together the\ncase against poll tax in Alabama. Which was a fair amount of my time. In 1960... the poll tax\n* According to John Doar, the judge\u2019s name was Frank Johnson.\n66\nwas probably the Voting Rights Act of \u201867, after Selma. In \u201868, I think we did that case, in\nMontgomery.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights Movement in general and your perceptions of its\nvarious goals and conflicts within the movement. You mentioned SNCC being, and I thought\nmaybe I should mention for the tape that, that\u2019s the Student Non-Violent Coordinating\nCommittee. Right? I was thinking about that and the ideal of non-violence that King and people\nwho worked in that spirit, people who worked with SNCC and people who worked in the\nSouthern Christian Leadership Conference, versus Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, a little\nlater on. How did you perceive that? I mean you were talking a little bit earlier about how you\ndon\u2019t, about non-violence and how you don\u2019t feel that if you were in a situation like that you\nwould just turn the other cheek and let somebody gun down you or somebody dear to you.\nWhereas King was very committed to non-violence and some of his followers were as well.\nWhat were your perceptions of that and of Malcolm X\u2019s agenda?",
        "A: Well, I think that, I mean I might tolerate somebody throwing an egg in my face, especially when\nyou are together with other people, you know. I have a great respect for the non-violent\nmovement and Gandhi and his teachings. I think Martin Luther King and his idea about using\nnon-violence as the way to demonstrate love for your fellow man and woman, and that you have\nto, that that was the way that would be most effective. And that armed, an armed response\nwasn\u2019t going to work. It wasn\u2019t going to work anyway because they didn\u2019t have... a number of\npeople were going to be killed. People were killed along the way. So, I mean, I\u2019m convinced\nreally that you do, that the courts are only an adjunct to any movement of that sort. I mean the\ncourts can help to insure that the rights of individuals and groups are protected within a very,\nwithin a particular sphere or frame of reference. But as I said, the Voting Rights Act, I don\u2019t\nthink, would have been passed, certainly it wouldn\u2019t have been passed as quickly, and I\u2019m not\nsure it would have been passed at all, without the Selma march and the demonstrations and, I\nguess, Martin Luther King\u2019s conviction that gradually the country would recognize how wrong\nsegregation was and that you were simply trying to provide to all citizens of this country the\nrights to which they were secure. I\u2019m not, as far as Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement,\nI\u2019m not a, I don\u2019t, I haven\u2019t studied all of black history anymore than many other subjects I\nhaven\u2019t studied. I think that there is an awful... that it\u2019s important for these, for African-\nAmericans to recognize their history and their culture. There\u2019s a lot to be gained from that, just\nas itis in Appalachia. People ought to be, can be proud of their culture. And that you can do\nthat in this country, within the confines of the law and that there is room for us to have an\nintegrated social system, where groups that are Native Americans, and African-Americans, and\nthe various cultural, ethnic citizens who are coming to this country can still retain and recognize\nsome of their own history and preserve it. And I think that\u2019s really what he was, in part, talking\nabout. I suppose, whether Malcolm X would like to have separated this country into one that\nwas white and black or not. I\u2019m not that familiar with really everything that he wrote. But that\u2019s\nthe way I feel about that. I don\u2019t know that 1t means how I would react in a particular situation.\nWe don\u2019t have any guns in our home, whereas... or in our cars. (Laughing.) And I don\u2019t intend\nto carry any weapons or have them. And many, and in this area and the South, you know, you\nhave a lot of hunters, which Iam not. And you have a lot of people who feel strongly about their\nright to bear arms 1n this area here, where we live. And they can do that. I would be happy for\nus to get rid of all the weapons in this country, hand guns. I don\u2019t need them. But that doesn\u2019t\n67\nmean that I, to me that if push came to shove, I might not feel it was the right thing to do. Or\nthat I would not be a conscientious objector if I were called back into the military. I think that\u2019s\nwhere those lines are. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an absolute line. For me, even though I would think, I do\nbelieve that non-violence has its place and that... if we can achieve the ends that we seek. By\nmass marches, whether it\u2019s for Vietnam or to break down barriers of segregation, then that\u2019s\nwhat should be done.",
        "Q: What did your parents think of your civil rights work?",
        "A: They, I think, well, I think they were quite proud of what I was doing. I think they were quite\nproud of what I was doing. I don\u2019t know that my mom, I mean my father and mother more, I\ndon\u2019t know that my father was totally convinced. I think he was in some ways, he was a little bit\nof an elitist intellectually. As I said earlier, he was not, he was a very private person. He really\nhad a difficult time making conversations with people who he didn\u2019t feel had a great deal of\neducation or that were on his level intellectually. And in that way he was a little bit of a snob, I\nthink. And so I don\u2019t know that he was in total agreement with the use of the nation\u2019s resources\nto desegregate. I don\u2019t know that he was, I think my Dad wasn\u2019t a racist. I don\u2019t think in that\nway, I don\u2019t know that we...\nEnd of Tape 5, Side B\n68\nTape 6, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number six, side A of an interview with John Rosenberg. So he wasn\u2019t sympathetic\nto demonstrations?",
        "A: Well, I mean I think it\u2019s complicated and hard to really articulate what my dad\u2019s feelings were. I\nthink they were very proud of the fact, after the fact. I don\u2019t think they were necessarily\nunderstanding about why I went to law school, when they thought I had already found a career.\nAnd had a good job. Within the Jewish community for example, try to explain to somebody why\na man who is, let\u2019s see how old was I? In \u201859 I was twenty-eight. Why anybody would want to\ngo back to school. I think they had the same reaction when my sister went back to school. You\ncan\u2019t tell them anymore that he\u2019s a successful salesperson going, selling chemicals. You always\nwant to tell somebody your kids are doing something that\u2019s fine and they\u2019re well and they\u2019re\ntaking care of themselves, whether it\u2019s a chemical salesman, or doing great things, making a lot\nof money, which is what the Jewish community wants to hear, that people are making a lot of\nmoney, which is their symbol of success. Maybe my mother more than my father. So when I\nwent to law school. But they were very, I think they were very impressed by and large with the\nlawyers and associates that I met in the Civil Rights Division. And certainly having the Division\nand John and the people who... I mean we didn\u2019t have the Kennedys come to our wedding, but\neverybody, a lot of the people from the Justice Department and the Civil Rights Division and our\nassociates. So, I think they were really, as a general matter, very pleased with what I was doing\nas a lawyer and the work I did there. And the work I did here. I think they would never, there\nwas always the question of why I did I just not go into a law firm and make a whole lot of\nmoney? (Laughing.) Why spend your time doing this public service work? Which people still\ndon\u2019t understand, not only about me, but about a lot of other people who work here and work in\nother programs. The work that many people 1n Social Services do and maybe that people do as\nwriters or artists, where they\u2019re trying to live out their life in a way they are comfortable with\nand like, which may not be financially very rewarding. But that that\u2019s not the test for them and\nprobably it ought not to be the test in my mind. So, it\u2019s hard... so I think they were very, you\nknow, when I received some awards later on for my work here and that sort of thing, parents are\nalways going to be happy with something like that. But I think my dad was kind of a\ncomplicated man when it came to the racial thing, because he worked on a daily basis in his\nfactory and I think saw... was not as ready to believe that if you give everybody a chance, that\npoverty is like a vicious circle. If you live in a very poor environment you are going to have\nilliteracy, you\u2019re going to have drugs, you\u2019re going to have alcohol abuse and substance abuse.\nAnd if you don\u2019t look, if you aren\u2019t willing to deal with the causes, and you aren\u2019t willing to try\nto deal with the elimination of poverty at that level, it\u2019s easy to say, \u201cThese folks are always...\nthey\u2019re drinking, they could be... they drop out of school, and it\u2019s all their fault.\u201d\u201d And the next\nthing you know... and they\u2019re certainly true of... there are more poor white people in this\ncountry than there are blacks. But if you look at it as a Southern phenomenon or where you\nlived... I think that someone like my father, who had a history in the Jewish community, where\nwe\u2019re too often too quick to say, \u201cWe were able to take care of ourselves despite all this\nrepression. We came out of Germany, with only the clothes on our backs and nothing in our\npocket and look what we did. Why can\u2019t they do the same thing? The same thing?\u201d People say,\n\u201cLook at Asians, Japanese have come to this country and whose kids achieve, who are motivated\nto achieve.\u2019\n69",
        "Q: What\u2019s your response to that kind of remark?",
        "A: Well, I mean, I think it\u2019s the same sort of driving force, in a way, that says they are, historically\nhave valued education, and have seen that if you get an education, that you are motivated to\nsucceed and you can be someone. And I think African-Americans see that, too. But I think, I\nthink, as I say, part of it 1s a vicious circle, part of it is, that\u2019s what Jean does, sometimes it\u2019s one\nat a time, that people who are born into these poor economic circumstances, we have a whole\ngeneration, we have several generations of welfare in Eastern Kentucky and in the South. And\nit\u2019s hard to break that cycle in a variety of situations, people, and we... I don\u2019t know that welfare\nreform isn\u2019t all bad. It can be done, in my mind, and I think Jean\u2019s, in a more humane way. But\npeople have to have some support systems, and if you come out from, if you have a series of\ngenerations where education isn\u2019t valued, for example in Eastern Kentucky you could get a very\ngood job mining coal, you didn\u2019t need an education for years and years and generations, all you\nhad to do... I mean, it was hard work, dangerous work in some ways. But it was the kind of\nwork that people knew. It was all manual labor. As that ends, people don\u2019t have those jobs, and\nthey don\u2019t have the options, they find themselves in those situations where there is disparity, they\nhave to leave. And I think the black, in the South, you have the history of segregation for a\ncouple of hundred years, where you don\u2019t have equal opportunity. Where you have terrible\nschools, and where you\u2019re expected to be a sharecropper, really don\u2019t have an equal opportunity.\nThen you can\u2019t have, those children can\u2019t have the expectations of being successful. Now people\ndebate that nationally. Black leaders debate that, you hear it all the time. \u201cWe can be successful.\nWe should not have Affirmative Action.\u201d I think Affirmative Action has been a very successful\ntool. But the pendulum has swung. Now you find Justice Thomas\u201d, and you find black leaders\nwho say, \u201cAffirmative Action is unfair. It\u2019s unfair to whites. It\u2019s unfair in that it gives, we don\u2019t\nneed an unfair advantage,\u201d or to label it as an unfair advantage. To some extent it\u2019s subjective.\nThose are my own feelings about... I think you do have to make additional opportunities\navailable to people who have been historically discriminated against. We have had it and to try\nto isolate that advantage to those very few situations where you can actually prove that this\ncompany discriminated in this bad way and so they\u2019re supposed to overcome that. But I don\u2019t,\nand I don\u2019t think my dad, anymore than anybody else, was... I certainly wish he had been more\nbroadminded about that, I\u2019m just saying he\u2019s not perfect, none of us are perfect and he had his\nimperfections and that was one of them. As far as philosophically, he didn\u2019t go around making\nspeeches about it. But I think he was still proud of what I was doing. I think it was easy, he\nwould be the first, among others, he would say, \u201cWell they should be, certainly not prevent\npeople,\u201d think it was wrong to try to enforce the right to vote or even the right to go to public\nfacilities or to have the same legal rights as everyone else.",
        "Q: Do you think that your awareness of and to some extent your direct experience of persecution of\nthe Jews during World War II, affected your, influenced your interest in working for civil rights\nfor blacks?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure it did. I\u2019m sure that my history and the persecution that Jews had, what we went\nthrough as a family and as Jews had a lot to do with my wanting to participate in the Civil Rights\nMovement.\n3 Clarence Thomas, 1948--. US Supreme Court Justice 1991--.\n70",
        "Q: You talked...",
        "A: (Talkover.) It\u2019s the same thing. I mean it is essentially the same thing. In a different way. I\nmean it\u2019s the mistreatment of blacks, maybe it isn\u2019t genocide, but there were certainly the\nlynching periods when many blacks were killed. Not in the scale that we\u2019re used to here, that\nwas true in the Holocaust. But I think it\u2019s the same thing that motivates, helped to motivate me\nto work there. And work in legal services, where you\u2019re essentially trying to do something\nsimilar to that on an individual basis. To provide those opportunities so that people are at least\neven in the courts and that they can find lawyers to advocate their positions, which they, in the\ncourts, which they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to do. And I\u2019ve said many times, I think it\u2019s the\nmark of, a good mark, one of the things that this country ought to be proud of, 1s the fact that it\ndoes fund programs like ours, so that people, and provide lawyers to low-income people. And\neven makes it possible to sue the government if necessary, that biting the hand that feeds you, if\nyou have to. You don\u2019t have to do that as much as we did. But we don\u2019t get the funds that we\nought to have, that\u2019s regrettable. Just as regrettable as it was that it took so long to get to the\ndays of the civil rights, it took... Brown against the Board of Education is 1954 and we aren\u2019t\nfully at the end of it yet, with regard to higher education. It takes thirty and forty years. Court\nprocesses are slow. But I think it all has to do with human rights, treating people, giving\neveryone the same opportunity, whether they are young or old, or white or black, or... whoever.",
        "Q: Would you tell how you met Jean?",
        "A: My wife, Jean?",
        "Q: Get a chance to fill in the record. Your wife, Jean.",
        "A: I met Jean in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. She was, I was the Deputy\nof the Southeastern Section, which handled Alabama, Mississippi. No Alabama and not\nMississippi, then. My section chief was Frank Dunbaugh\u2122 and Jean came to the section as a\nresearch analyst, which she mentioned to you. They are now called paralegals. We call them\nalso administrative representatives here. They do a little different work in my organization. But\nJohn Doar was invited to speak at Earlham College** in Jean\u2019s senior year, or maybe her junior\nyear. Her roommate, Dorothy, now Landsberg, was then named Shelton, was in charge of the\nspeaking program, and for some reason she had heard about John Doar\u2019s work and asked him to\ncome to Earlham to speak. And he came there and then he, I believe first hired Dorothy for the\nsummer to work for him and he also met Jean. Or she came to, or she came to Washington. I\ndon\u2019t know whether he hired her then. They were about, they were the two, I think, the first\nresearch analysts. Dorothy later on after I... and so, Jean came to this section and we began\nworking together. Of course we were sort of... I was second in charge of the section and she\nwas working on cases, and so I think we once... a group of us went on a skiing trip and that was\nthe first time we had any opportunity to be together socially. \u2018Cause we were still I guess\ndrawing some lines when we were at work. She was just a new employee and working under,\nnot directly under me, but with some other lawyers in preparing cases. What they would do is\n\u201c4 Frank M. Dunbaugh served in the Civil Rights Division from 1958-1978.\n* Earlham College is in Richmond, Indiana.\n71\nanalyze the documents, like the voting records we brought back. We similarly started doing the\nsame thing with schools. Normally in a school desegregation case, someone like Jean might go\ninto the Superintendent\u2019s office under a court order or voluntarily and start analyzing where the\nwhite students and the black students in the county lived and why they were not being\nassigned... say, it was pretty apparent in the segregated school systems that you\u2019d have,\nespecially where there was bussing, that black children would need to pass a white school to be\nassigned to their black school. And to put those patterns together and to analyze how the school\nsystem assigned students deliberately, so that white students would be together and black\nstudents would continue to be together. Or route buses in a way that made sure that schools\nremained segregated. So they were really analyzing those records, which they would then\npresent to the lawyers. And the same thing in employment cases, whether, you know, in a large\nfactory, where you looked at the number of applicants for jobs and determined that a black was\npassed over, even though, let\u2019s say that maybe he had made an application to get to a particular\njob and the company said, \u201cWell you weren\u2019t qualified,\u201d in another area. By looking at several\nof those situations you could look, you\u2019d only know from the records whether the person who\nwas actually put in had the qualifications or not, or whether they passed over someone who was\nblack, or they didn\u2019t, the black who had applied was obviously qualified, or less qualified than\nthe person they hired. That kind of analysis, which was then given to the lawyers. So, that\u2019s\nwhat Jean was hired to do. And then we, later on when we were, she had worked there about a\nyear... well, let\u2019s see. It might not have even been a year. When we went to Alabama on this\nvoting rights case, the Jim Clark case, Jean was there with me. She was involved in some\nrecords analysis. And I almost, we were not yet married, but I almost had to put her on the stand,\nbut I didn\u2019t. And there were a couple of other situations where she ended up in a place where, in\na case that I was working on, where we began to suspect that John Doar was deliberately sending\nher to cases that I was working on, since we had started dating or people knew that we had sort\nof started dating. So, after we worked on this case involving Jim Clark, we went over to, it was\nsort of a night and day affair. She was telling you that we had this unfortunate situation where\nLois Baker, who was our secretary. We hired the first probably, black secretary. We had an\noffice in Selma, Alabama. There was a lawyer from the Civil Rights Division, named Chad\nQuaintance, who was the first lawyer that we had in a field office. He and his family moved to\nSelma and were there. And Chad hired Lois Baker as a secretary and she was an African-\nAmerican. She was the one who had these epileptic seizures. She was just very young. I think\nshe was only about nineteen. I went back to Selma for the thirtieth anniversary of the Selma, of\nthe Voting Rights Act in 1995. They had a big get-together. And it happened that I was going to\nBirmingham for a legal services meeting and one of the lawyers who works in my program,\nLarry York, and I went over to Selma for a couple of days. There was a... they have a small\nvoting rights museum there. There were some people around who we visited and I visited Lois,\nwho had since gotten married and had two, several children. And we were thinking back...\nShe\u2019s the head of the computer section at Montgomery Air Force Base or something at this point\nin time. But after that Jean and I went over to Montgomery and helped work on another, on a\nschool case for several days. It was the statewide school desegregation case, Lee Against Macon\nCounty*\u00ae. They needed some help. They were just going to trial and they needed some help in\ngetting the thing going. And Brian, my roommate, I was living at the time with a lawyer named\nBrian Landsberg, who then subsequently married Jean\u2019s roommate, Dorothy Landsberg, who\n*\u00a9 On August 13, 1963, federal judge Frank M. Johnson ordered Macon County and all of Alabama to integrate its\nschools, after six months of deliberation on the Lee v. Macon County case.\n72\nwas the one that John had invited to come out. And Brian was my roommate. We lived together\nin a small house in Washington that we had bought, that we had rented from a former lawyer in\nthe Division. Anyway after that was over, Jean went back to Philadelphia. You asked me how I\nmet her. That\u2019s how I met her, after the skiing trip we started dating. And then after working\ntogether so much, I think we just decided, I just asked her to see if she didn\u2019t think we ought to\nget married.",
        "Q: Now will you tell the story of how you did that? You mentioned it last night, but we didn\u2019t get it\non tape.",
        "A: Well, I was with, actually John Doar, I think partially to see that I got home. But to assign me,\nJean went back to Philadelphia after the Montgomery trip. And John asked me to go to\nCharlotte. My classmate from law school, Jultus Chambers, who as I mentioned was my\nAfrican-American classmate, had gone, was practicing in Charlotte, had become a very well\nknown lawyer, who was eventually, in later years argued the Charlotte desegregation case in the\nSupreme Court. But he had started a law firm and was involved in a lot of civil rights activities,\nand there had been an attempt to bomb his house. I think the mail... he hadn\u2019t gotten hurt, it\ndidn\u2019t do a lot of damage. But the mailbox, there had been some exterior damage. And we had\nstarted an FBI investigation and it looked like it was fairly, clearly to do with the Klan. And so\nJohn asked me to go up there and look into that and maybe talk with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.\nAnd my friend, Nick Flannery, who had done the Carroll County case with me, a wonderful\nlawyer, who, when he left the Division went to work for, in Boston with the Center for Law and\nEducation, which was the legal services support center for education cases. He was the chief\ntrial lawyer in the Boston school desegregation case, if you... then. But Nick went with me to\nCharlotte and we started doing some investigation. And we went out to eat, we were in line\ngoing out to eat and I said to Nick, I asked him to hold my place in line, that I would be back in a\nfew minutes and I wanted to make a phone call. And I called Jean at her house. I don\u2019t know\nwhether I thought well maybe she would come down. It was just, my family... see Charlotte is\nonly twenty miles from Gastonia. In fact I don\u2019t think, I was staying with Nick in Charlotte and\nI had not, I\u2019m not sure I had even been home yet. And I don\u2019t know why, whether John sent me\nthere so I\u2019d have a chance to see my folks. I think he thought, literally being from North\nCarolina and he knew I knew Julius, that I would have some interest in this case, being from\nhome. So, I called her on the phone and said, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d or, \u201cDon\u2019t you think we\nshould get married, since we\u2019ve been together all this time and seem to get along pretty well?\u201d\nWe'd actually had been, I mean we had been dating pretty steadily by that time. Even had taken\na trip or two with Dorothy and Brian. But we had not really talked about taking the plunge, I\nthink. Jean would, reminds me that I told her, when I first started going out with her, that when\nwe started going out, that I really would not consider marrying someone who was not Jewish.\nThat I had announced that early on in our dating. And I must have let that one go by the board.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember saying that?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know whether, I\u2019m sure I did. I\u2019m sure I did. I\u2019m sure it came up early. Or once we\nstarted seeing each other and it became a consideration, I\u2019m sure my influence and my history\nwas still pretty strong. And I did not think I would ever marry somebody who was not Jewish.\nBut I did.\n73",
        "Q: Was that premeditated, that phone call? It sounds like it was just all of sudden you\u2019re waiting in\nline for food and you just felt like, I gotta go. I gotta go propose marriage. (Laughing.)",
        "A: I think it was clear, I think I put Jean on the plane and I suppose knew that I was pretty much in\nlove with her and that we ought to do that. Why I did it at that particular moment, who knows\u2019?\nMaybe it was the first free moment. We were working on this Klan case and I just had a desire\nto do it. And I knew we would go back to work on the Klan case, probably, and that there would\nbe an opportunity for her to come down. That I would be at home. And then she said, her dad\nsuggested it. I think I got on the phone with them. I don\u2019t know whether I suggested they come\ndown with Jean or her father was never one to sit around and wait. So, then I was able to tell\nNick when I got back in line, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s a wedding in the offing.\u201d We were engaged for, I think\nfrom November, maybe I got home, whether that was the engagement call. We got married in\nFebruary 1967. This was probably like October, November of 1966.",
        "Q: And when did you meet her?",
        "A: Probably, let\u2019s see the Selma case was earlier in \u201866, she came to work in \u201865. So, she came to\nwork right, probably right about the time of the Voting Rights Act. She graduated from Earlham\nin \u201865. Because we just got a postcard, she will be having her thirty-fifth reunion next year. Just\nsent an e-mail out to Dorothy Landsberg. They got married, we were the first of about four or\nfive, actually. She was living, at the time Jean was living in an apartment with Dorothy and\nanother woman named Mary Lee, then Campbell. And all three of them married Civil Rights\nDivision lawyers within a year of each other. And Mary Lee has spent most of her life working\nfor the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. She\u2019s very up in the hierarchy with Marian Edelman*\u2019. She\ndoes a lot of foster care issues, a lot of lobbying. She\u2019s a terrific person. And then Dorothy went\nback to law school. When they, Brian became the Chief of the Appeals Section of the Civil\nRights Division, which he held for a number of years. He worked in our Alabama Section, under\nme, we were living together, but he was in my section for a long, and he then became a section\nchief, I think. And became Chief of the Appeals Section and stayed there until, probably ten\nyears ago, when he joined the faculty at McGeorge Law School in California.*\u00ae And then\nDorothy went back to law school and she\u2019s a lawyer with a very large, not a very large, but with\na fairly prominent law firm in Sacramento. They live in Sacramento. And she\u2019s been recently\nfor the last year been doing a big case with John Doar in his private law firm practice. So most\nof these connections have sort of stayed together. It\u2019s a little bit like the Civil Rights Division,\nfairly small family. The Assistant Attorney General who replaced him, Steve Pollak, was a...\nJean and I... baby, they had three kids and they never had taken a vacation since he came out of\nthe Navy. They were all small. So, one of our first volunteer actions was to move in and they\ntook a two-week vacation, and we moved in with their kids and did child care for a while. All of\nthem are now married or getting married or having children and it was quite an experience for us.\nI think even one of the gerbils died during our sitting. So, that\u2019s how that happened.\nEnd of Tape 6, Side A\n*\u201d Marian Wright Edelman, 1939--. Founder and President of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. First African-American\nwoman admitted to Mississippi state bar.\n*8 University of the Pacific, McGeorge School of Law, Sacramento, CA.\n74\nTape 6, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number six, side B. You were just talking about proposing to Jean and the\nimmediate aftermath of that. Had Jean met your parents by then, by the time that you proposed\nto her?",
        "A: I think she\u2019d been there once, I\u2019d have to ask her. But I think she had been down once and that\nwas probably a clue to them, because I didn\u2019t bring women by. I\u2019m pretty certain that she had\nbeen to the house once before. So, they knew of her and they knew... I\u2019m not sure how I\nmanaged to do that. Whether it was on a vacation or whether we had been working on a case. I\njust don\u2019t remember, but I think they knew that we were pretty serious.",
        "Q: And that first meeting between her parents and your parents and you... would you like to\ndescribe that scene?",
        "A: Well as Jean told you, she was there without me with the both of them facing each other for a\nlittle while, so I guess they were a little bit new to each other. But her father 1s a pretty\nextroverted person, who has a lot of interests and was then much younger, quite young. Was\nvery interested in spiritual things and I think my dad was able to talk to him. And they got along\nvery well. And Jean\u2019s mother and my mother hit it off really well. I think Jean\u2019s mother had\nbeen a secretary and was always doing transcription work of one sort or another. And in fact, in\nthe last fifteen years or so she would not, well after we were married, Jean\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t\ntake a full time job, she worked for Manpower\u00ae\u2019, so they could come down and see Michael or\nbe with the grandson and then the grandchildren. We were both, in the sense that her father\u2019s\nbackground was German and was the son of a tailor immigrant family. His mother was very\nstrong. He grew up in New York City at a time when much of downtown New York was still\nfarm, farming country. There are some old letters in her family that I was reading when I was\nhome, where they were describing the winter and it was cold and they\u2019d have to go outside to the\nouthouse to relieve themselves. And they were literally living in a farming area where the\nUnited Nations Building is now. But the point was that they were sort of both from old\nEuropean generation backgrounds, where the fathers were working and more sort of the\ndominant, and they were making the money and the mothers were at home, and the household\nwas sort of run the way the fathers said it was run. And in that way, I think, there was some\ncommonality, even if the religions weren\u2019t the same and the families got off to a pretty good\nstart. They didn\u2019t stay very long on that occasion and I don\u2019t remember, I mean they saw, saw\neach other periodically and from time to time. Jean\u2019s parents used to, as she said, came to visit\nus alot more. They came down here a lot. They really took a major interest in their\ngrandchildren. My parents had moved to Florida and did not really come up, they made a trip up\nafter we moved here from North Carolina, when they were still living in Gastonia. As I said my\nfather, \u201865, let\u2019s say in 1966... Let\u2019s see, we got married in \u201867. He retired about that time and\nthey moved to Florida shortly thereafter. So that we would go see them usually at Christmas.\nBut they didn\u2019t make many trips up. Right after we moved to Prestonsburg they made a, they\ndrove over, got as far as Pikeville and the four-lane was just being developed, was being blasted\nopen between Pikeville and Prestonsburg. So they got within thirty miles of home and then had\nto take a thirty mile detour around the back hollers from Wheelwright and I don\u2019t think, I think\n* Manpower is a national employment agency for temps.\n75\nthat sort of, was enough for them. Although they moved to Florida, they never really made\nanother big driving excursion up this way. So I don\u2019t know that I have many more, it\u2019s one of\nthose things I don\u2019t have a lot of... Jean probably recalls better than I do. We went back for...\nafter we got married and worked in the Civil Rights Division, when Jean then, when Michael\nwas born in 1970 in April, we had decided then to leave the Division. That was when the Nixon\nAdministration had come in, and even though I was Chief of the Criminal Section, they were not,\npretty much still let me have a free hand. The Houston school case was one of the last cases that\nthey filed in which the government, which I had written the pleadings in, in which we asked for\nbussing as a relief. And they were generally to eliminate segregation, to start bussing black kids\nacross to white schools and whites to black schools. We didn\u2019t get all of that in the relief. We\ndid pair up some schools and we made some other major improvements. But they were, in my\nview, certainly, and others, were retreating on school desegregation. And it wasn\u2019t really... the\nclimate was not what it had been and I, we decided then, I think, that we had been there long\nenough. Besides I had been there, was in a very senior position and at that point you\u2019re starting\nto almost price yourself out of the market if you want to make a career change. You might stay\nwith the government and decide to go, to keep, to go up another notch or two or maybe make\nmore and more money. Or if you\u2019re going to a law firm, in order to get a reasonable salary, too,\nit was at the point where it was a good time for me to do that. So we, and Michael had just been\nborn, it was a nice time to take off for the summer. And we decided then to, we would go on a\nlarge camping trip. We got our little car and the baby carriage, and folded it. We bought a\nPeugeot for eight hundred dollars that looked like it had a lot of miles left on it. And we headed\nNorth and we went North along the American and Canadian coast. We went to the Canadian \u2014\nAmerican National Parks, Fundy and all the way along, Cape Breton, out to Cape Breton and\nPrince Edward Island. Came back to Quebec and basically got away from it all. I think I had\none call from a firm and decided to leave it, not to bother with it. And we weren\u2019t really sure\nwhere, we knew we wanted to do something useful, where I felt I was using my legal talents to\nsomebody\u2019s benefit. And I had talked to some firms and that didn\u2019t really excite me at the time,\nbut I think I was just more, we were really more into making the decision to leave, which was a\nbig thing, because we didn\u2019t have a job. But we wanted to get away for a while and we had\nsome money saved up, so we, while I was on that trip one of the... when we came back... what\nwas it? --Someone left a message for us. One of my former colleagues from the Division, Terry\nLenzner was the head of legal services for the Office of Economic Opportunity. And he was the\none who suggested while we were on this camping trip that we might want to drive through\nCharleston, West, to come through West Virginia and to Kentucky. This is by way of answering\nyou about my parents, because they had moved to Florida. And we were sort of on our way to be\nat the Jewish, to spend the Jewish holidays with my parents in Florida, which is about this time\nof year, in September. So we were off, I think we returned from, we were, went over to Cape\nBreton and we went back to Quebec. And it was really cold and we bought a tent heater. And\nthen we went from there down to Boston and all of a sudden it was ninety-six and we were\nstaying with former colleagues of the Civil Rights Division, who were in graduate school at\nHarvard, I think. And they had this small apartment without an air conditioner. We were\nburning up. Well anyway, we started back down and Terry Lenzner got in touch with us and we\nwent through Charleston. And the program in Kentucky was then associated with this group in\nWest Virginia, called Appalachian Research and Defense Fund, which had been founded by\nthree lawyers, four lawyers, who wanted to start a public interest law firm. And they had begun\nsome environmental work, but were having a tough time economically. And they had gotten in\n76\ntouch with Terry Lenzner at OEO and he wanted to, was willing to do some, to fund an\norganization to do, under the auspices of legal services, to look at some of the symptomatic\nissues around poverty in the Central Appalachian area. Out-of-state mineral interests, black lung\ndisease, environmental damages related to coal mining, deep mining and surface mining. And\nPaul Kaufmann, who was one of the four, there, of those lawyers\u2014there were four attorneys,\nKaufmann was a former gubernatorial candidate and was real active in Democratic politics, had\nbeen a private attorney. And John Boettner, fellow named Ratliff? and a woman named Naomi\nCohen. And then there was a small group here in Eastern Kentucky of lawyers, who had worked\nas a group called Mountain People\u2019s Rights. And there was a fellow named Howard Thorkelson,\nwho was from Pennsylvania. And he had gotten a couple of other lawyers to come down here,\nalthough they were not yet licensed and they were having financial difficulties. So the two of\nthem were sort of interested in working together and getting this federal money through the West\nVirginia organization. West Virginia then had a Republican governor, Arch Moore?\u2019. And he\nwas hostile to legal services, as was the Republican governor in Kentucky, Louis Nunn\u00b0\u201d. So\nthere was a, the West Virginia Technical Institute, was an educational institution, so Terry\nconcocted a scheme whereby he would fund West Virginia Tech, because educational grants\nwere not subject to gubernatorial veto as the other OEO grants were and then they would in turn\nfund Appalred>\u2019. But anyway, I guess I\u2019m getting a little ahead of myself. I was just, we were on\nthis camping trip and so we came to Charleston and talked to the people there. And Paul said,\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go down to visit with the Kentucky people, because Howard Thorkelson is\ngoing to leave and they need someone to replace him and we\u2019re going to be funding them. If\nyou\u2019re interested we would seriously consider asking you to take over this group in Kentucky.\u201d\nSo, we came down here and came here to Prestonsburg on an August or a September evening\nand pitched out tent out there at Jenny Wiley**. Back then, oh actually the campground was at\nthe other end up here near Auxier, at that entrance. Jean wanted me to go out and make sure\nthere weren\u2019t any bears or foxes, she had heard... there wasn\u2019t anybody there but us. It was\nreally after the camping season. But we met the people who were here and everybody seemed\nvery friendly and we decided to go down and... I had already gotten some names of people,\nHarry Caudill, who you know wrote Night Comes to the Cumberlands, was on the Appalred\nBoard in West Virginia>\u2019. He was a friend of Paul Kaufmann\u2019s, I think, and had been very,\nKaufmann had put some people from Kentucky on his Board. He wanted this thing to be more\nof a regional program because there were so many of the issues were common to the Central\nAppalachia, and that the state lines really didn\u2019t mean anything. The strip mining problems in\nKentucky and West Virginia were the same. Unregulated strip mining, land owners having their\nland torn up without their consent, and that sort of thing. So, I went down and talked to Harry\nCaudill. There was a woman, here on Mud Creek they were doing a lot of, they were having a\nlot of problems around health issues. Hospitals weren\u2019t taking people who couldn\u2019t pay. Eula\nHall was her name, she is a good friend, who still works at the, founded the Mud Creek Clinic\nhere in our area\u00ae\u00ae. And I went over into Blackey, Kentucky. There was a fellow named Joe\n50 Ray Ratliff\n>! Arch A. Moore, Jr., 1923--. Republican Governor of West Virginia 1969-1977 and 1985-1989.\n2 Louis B. Nunn, 1924-2004. Republican Governor of Kentucky 1967-1971.\n\u00b03 Appalachian Research and Defense Fund of Kentucky, Inc., headquartered in Prestonsburg.\n4 Jenny Wiley State Resort, Prestonsburg, Kentucky.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Harry M. Caudill, 1922-1990. Attorney, writer, professor. Published Night Comes to the Cumberlands: A\nBiography of a Depressed Area in 1963.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Eula Hall founded the Mud Creek Clinic in Grethel, Floyd County, Kentucky, in 1973.\n77\nBegley, who was running a country store, who was a very strong anti-strip mining advocate?\u2019.\nAnd his wife, Gaynell Begley, she had gotten a Master\u2019s in Education from the University of\nChicago. She was a wonderful person. They... Joe was born here in Floyd County, and he was\npart Indian. We talked a lot about their history and the problems that he saw, poor people, and\nthat people were getting run over by strip miners. Because Kentucky\u2019s courts allowed mining\nwithout, strip mining without land owner approval. Because these out of state mineral owners\nhad come here in the late 1890s and bought out all the minerals. We were talking about country\npeople and being acceptance of outsiders. Have you ever read Harry Caudill\u2019s book, Night\nComes to the Cumberlands? Yeah. Well you know, he describes this situation so well where\nthese land agents for the Northern philanthropists, like Rockefeller and large oil holding and\nmineral holding companies sent their agents down here. They would visit these farmers who\nlived in very remote hollers, where they were farming the mountain hills, really. And they\nwould come in and tell their stories, and spend the night, talk about all the good things that were\ngoing on in the world and how nice this place was. And then they would present them, they\nwould suggest to them that they ought to go ahead and sell over their mineral rights because it\nwasn\u2019t really any benefit to them that they could see. No one knew what mining was. There\nwasn\u2019t any huge deep mine there. The only use they made of their coal would be to cut into the\nhillside enough to get the coal to use for heating up their cabins and their homes, which is what\nmost of them did. You could see the outcrop of the coal and they would run a scraper along the\nmountain and take out a little bit of coal. But no one... certainly they were aware as they were in\nother countries of deep mining methods. And I\u2019m sure these agents didn\u2019t talk a great deal about\nthe possibility of having a huge, deep mine. This was in the 1890s, 1900s, was before the time\nof the railroads. And subsequently the railroads came in once all these minerals had been bought\nup, I mean they literally bought up all of the mineral ownership in Eastern Kentucky. And under\nthe common law, the mineral estate 1s severed from the surface, so what you have left is the land\non top. And they gave them, the deeds they signed as you know, were known as Broad Form\nDeeds because they were so broad in their language. They literally gave the owner of the\nminerals the right to take the minerals and all steps reasonably necessary to build roads and\nrailroads and tram roads. Whatever might be necessary that\u2019s incidental to taking out the coal.\nAnd then they would sign those minerals away. And the Kentucky courts held that those deeds\nwere so broad that they gave the mineral owner the paramount right to the surface owner, as long\nas the mineral owner didn\u2019t arbitrarily misuse that right. As long as he mined by reasonable\nmethods and took the coal out by an acceptable method, the surface owner could not object to\nthat. So those, Joe had one of those old deeds and told me what an awful instrument was, that\neven though at the time when they executed the deeds, no one could have envisioned these\ncurrent methods of mining. Bulldozer, mechanic... and these huge, mechanized equipment that\nwas in use seventy-five years later, that the courts would hold that to be allowable. In most\ncontract law, the contract applies to those things that are within the reasonable contemplation of\nthe parties, like deep mining. There was no doubt that if you were going to mine back then you\nwould deep mine to get the coal out. We never challenged that. But the notion that they could\nuse a method that was not at all in anybody\u2019s contemplation was rejected in other states.\nVirtually. I mentioned West Virginia a while ago, I guess that wasn\u2019t really right. The West\nVirginia courts had said you have to have landowner consent. You could get a surface mining\npermit and you could pay for that. And that was what Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and many of\nthese others, Illinois, all the other states, courts had said, but not Kentucky. So Joe, we talked for\n>\u201d Joe Begley, 1919-2000. Former proprietor of C.B. Caudill Store and History Center in Blackey, Kentucky.\n78\na long time, was pointing out, also how poor people couldn\u2019t get lawyers to challenge those\ndeeds. And they couldn\u2019t get lawyers to challenge a permit application if someone applied for a\npermit. But there were many situations where he thought it would be just a wonderful thing if\nwe could have lawyers available to represent poor people. Because he saw these situations\ncoming up so often. And so, we went on, we went on to Florida to visit my mom and dad and\nwhile on the way I think we kind of decided that this would be an interesting opportunity to try\nto come to Eastern Kentucky. It would be a worthwhile way to practice law and to provide that\nopportunity. There was a lot of interesting work to be done and useful and perhaps important\nwork to do on behalf of low-income clients. And also to help start this legal services program,\nwhich was, had sort of a small beginning in mountain people\u2019s rights. So then we came...\ndecided to come, and we came. And moved to Prestonsburg. At first I looked around in\nBarbourville. We had a little tough time getting off the ground, because the, we had some\ndisagreements about how to do this the best way. Some people, some of the mountain people\u2019s\nrights members thought that it was more important to organize, to organize work with low-\nincome groups like the Welfare Rights Group, rather than doing lawyering work. So it wasn\u2019t\nquite as smooth sailing getting started as I had hoped. But after a little while we got on our way\nand Joe Begley\u2019s son, J. T. Begley, who had just gotten out of the Marines and gone back to law\nschool, turned out to be the first lawyer that I hired. And I hired a fellow named Mort Stamm,\nwho is now in Australia, teaching. And we started off with, then a fellow named Paul Fauri, who\nis the Domestic Relations Commissioner in Franklin County, and we started in that little house I\npointed out to you on the way up here. So, that\u2019s how it began. And I was telling you, it wasn\u2019t\nan easy beginning. I think the Bar Associations were very suspicious and I think they were\nthreatened and thought really we were going to compete with lawyers for clients that would be\nable to pay. And then some, many lawyers, who were employed or retained by coal companies\nwere not particularly sympathetic to the notion that lawyers might start to challenge some of\nthese practices and give people representation in the courts. So we were not the most popular\npeople in town when we started. I had difficulty renting an office. Finally found an office in the\nplace where Jean and I ended up living for a long time on the other side of town, within a week\nof each other. And we got started. It was also a difficult time because at the national level,\nPresident Nixon had an Office of Economic Opportunity Director, who was opposed to legal\nservices, bringing any of these sort of controversial cases against public officials, and\nchallenging welfare rights practices and that sort of thing. And he, he decided to, he wanted to\nde-fund those programs. So I had only been here about a year when all of that began in 1973 and\nit looked like we might lose our money. We had half of the lawyers were on half salaries and the\nsecretary, we had to hire, we got a lawyer in Washington, Steve Pollak, I mentioned to you, I\nused to work with, to represent us to threaten to sue OEO to get our funding. Some other\nprograms similarly went through a period of that sort. Governor Reagan at that time, who would\nbecome President, had sort of declared war on legal services in California, who had represented\nmigrant farm workers and had also won some fairly major welfare decisions with regard to\nhearing rights. And had showed that the California welfare system was violating the rights of\nwelfare recipients and applicants. And he was angry and tried to start, established an inquiry,\ntribunal out in California, that sort of thing. Actually the tribunal came out with a report, this\nincluded some judges, that was very favorable to CRLA. Then when Reagan became President,\nhe decided to do it all over again.",
        "Q: What\u2019s CRLA?\n79",
        "A: California Rural Legal Assistance Program, a rural program much like we are here. But\nfortunately we managed to weather those storms, and we were able to, and in 19... we were able\nto reach an accommodation with legal services actually, in that 1973 when we were represented\nby Steve Pollak and we sort of severed our ties to West Virginia by establishing a separate\ncorporation here. I mean it was... and they established, we added \u201cof Kentucky\u201d at the end of\nour name. We\u2019re still very good friends with the people in West Virginia and some of the work\nwe do is the same. But in West Virginia they ended up establishing a judicare program, which is\na program where cases are sent to the private bar, instead of a staff attorney. And you have a\nsmall central office and the cases are... and then you contract with lawyers. It tends to be a lot\nmore expensive. But Appalred\u2019s office did maintain intact in West Virginia, just with a fewer\nnumber of lawyers. So then we started our own program here. And in 1974, one of the last\nthings President Nixon did was to sign legal services Corporation Act, which he had vetoed once\nbefore. And then the corporations started getting larger amounts of money from year to year.\nAnd between 1975 and 1978 we expanded from the single office here in Prestonsburg to the ten\noffices that we opened and still have. And we went from probably three hundred thousand to\nabout two million dollars a year in our budget. We had eleven offices by 1980, including we had\na research office in Prestonsburg, I mean in Lexington, which we still have. So we undertook\nsome very important day-to-day litigation. We represented a lot of people in everyday problems\nwith family law, consumer rights, housing problems. And we did some of the larger challenges\ninvolved in, with regard to the coal mines. We found out that the agencies that governed all of\nthese programs were not really very responsive at times. The state\u2019s Mine Safety and Health\nAdministration did not do a good job in protecting the rights of coal miners. So we saw that\nwhen miners were fired because they complained about unsafe conditions. I mean, that that\u2019s\nwhat would happen to them if they complained. And so we were able to start representing them\nto get their jobs back and to get damages for them. And then in the environmental area we\nrepresented numbers of people who were challenging surface mining permits because they posed\ndangers to their homes and their property. And we gradually, as we kept after this Broad Form\ndeed, we challenged it in the courts unsuccessfully. And we eventually wrote legislation that\ncorrected the problem. We drafted a statute that said that if the kinds of mining methods were\nnot described in the deed, that it would be assumed that it referred only to methods that were in\nexistence at the time the deed was executed. And in Eastern Kentucky or in most places that\nwould mean deep mining only. That was first introduced in 1994. There were some previous\nefforts, unsuccessful... there was an earlier statute that required surface owner consent and the\ncourts struck that down. And then this legislation of ours was also struck down on a four \u2014 three\nopinion. The court said that the legislature could not tell the courts how to interpret deeds, which\nwe thought was bad reasoning. But after that a legislator from Pike County, Clayton Little\u00b0\u00ae,\nintroduced at the urging of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, that was then called the\nKentucky Fair Tax Coalition...\nEnd of Tape 6, Side B\n\u00b08.N. Clayton Little: Member of the Kentucky state house of representatives, 93\" district. Elected 1973, 1975.\n80\nTape 7, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number seven, side A of an interview with John Rosenberg.",
        "A: I was just saying that the constitutional amendment was passed in 1988, so it was introduced in\nnineteen, I guess in the 1988 legislative session. And it was passed by ninety-two percent of the\nvoters. It was a great publicity campaign by KFTC, a lot of letters to the editor, it sort of put\nthem on the map. We had started KFTC with a small group in Hazard, Kentucky. A group of\ncitizens came together to talk about fair taxation of minerals, initially. Because the coal under\nthe ground, not only did the land owner not have the opportunity to object to whether they could\nbe surface mining or not, but they were paying virtually all the taxes on the property. They were\nnot... and the Kentucky constitution said that all properties, cash... 1s taxed in fair cash value.\nBut the minerals weren\u2019t being taxed. So the group looked at that and decided that they would\ntry to start an organization called the Kentucky Fair Tax Coalition. I\u2019ve even been credited with\ngiving, we were sitting around the room trying to decide what should this thing be called?\nPeople were throwing up names. (Laughing.) Somebody said, I think it was, whatever the\nvarious combinations people had been throwing out, was that I suggested it be called\nKentuckians Fair Tax Coalition. But the other issue it took on was the Broad Form Deed. And\nthe group started very small, it was just kind of a get together really. One of the members who,\none of the folks who was there was a young man named Joe Zakos, who had come from\nPennsylvania and was interested in working with local citizens groups. And he had come, was\nliving in David, I think and had gotten involved in some issues over in Martin County. It didn\u2019t\nhave anything to do with the Broad Form Deed. It was really a proposal to move a low-income\ncommunity out of a flood-prone area. And they were going to fill it in and put in new housing or\nindustrial... the only thing was they forgot to discuss it with the people who were living there.\nAnd he organized an effort there to... which ultimately stopped that. They backed off on that\nproject. But in the process began a group called the Martin County Concerned Citizens, who\nthen were involved with a number of environmental and socially active, social... got involved in\nissues of social concern. We represented them one year in a case challenging the application\nof... Kentucky Power wanted to build another power generating plant. And the reason they\nwanted to build it was to sell more power to other companies, but it would have raised the rates\nof everyone, including the Martin County citizens, people who lived in that area. And we had a\nlawyer in legal services in Lexington, Tony Martin, who focused on energy work, and basically\ndemonstrated that there was no need for the power plant, that all it was going to do was increase\neverybody\u2019s power bill. They had plenty of generating power, they were just trying to expand\nthemselves. And the stockholders might benefit, but the Martin County citizen group was the\nnamed party. And so that was just to say that, even though a group that was called Kentucky\nFair Tax Coalition and decided later to rename itself Kentuckians for the Commonwealth,\nbecause local chapters were working on different issues of local concern. Didn\u2019t necessarily\ninvolve minerals and that sort of thing. But they really put themselves on the map with the\ncampaign to get the constitutional amendment passed. So that amendment was on the ballot in\n1988, along with the lottery. And the lottery barely passed. It passed by, I think, fifty-one or -\ntwo percent of the vote. Ninety-two percent of the vote, people voted for the Broad Form Deed\namendment, which showed people knew what they were doing. In fact, I remember when, early\nwhen we had been here not too many years, the Courier-Journal I think did an informal poll.\nAnd something like ninety-three percent of the people thought they shouldn\u2019t allow anybody to\n81\nstrip mine your land without your consent. But I was then, one of my, the coal industry decided\nthey wanted to challenge the constitutionality of that constitutional amendment as violating the\nfederal constitution. Because they claimed that mineral ownership rights had been established by\nthese series of Kentucky cases in the Supreme Court over the years and that people when they\nbought mineral rights expected to be able to legally surface mine. And we argued... and I was\nrepresenting an older couple in Johnson County, Garnet and Eugene Ward, who lived on a small\nfarm... they really weren\u2019t farming. It was in a holler that had not been mined. And there was a\nmining application by a company. And at the trial court, one of the attorneys who was here then\nwas handling, handled that case, and it was on appeal and it came to me and I took the case over.\nAnd we ended up arguing the constitutionality of the amendment in the Supreme Court. And the\nAttorney General argued in our support and the court then agreed with our theory that they never\nhad the right 1n the first place to grant the right to strip mine. So it took a lot of years, but finally\nthe right was... you cannot today surface mine anybody\u2019s land without their consent.",
        "Q: When did that final decision come down?",
        "A: I think it was 1990. The Supreme Court decision was stated in 1990. Ward versus, Ward\nversus... I forgot the last name for the moment. I can talk about that case a long time, but that\u2019s\nsort of the summary. Garnet, now both of the Wards... Eugene died while we were in the\nSupreme Court. And then Garnet died a couple of years back. She was a very feisty woman.\nShe claimed... they never, no one else had ever paid any taxes on this property. And they didn\u2019t\nknow that anybody else had any claim to the minerals. She thought they owned the claim.\nWhen we were in circuit court we asserted that, and there was some basis for her claim, because\nwhen the minerals were sold, about 1910, really interesting, by... the local owner, the owner was\nin Johnson County and he sold the mineral rights to a company in New York, that wanted to\ndevelop these minerals. And he sold... and they promised to pay him with... they gave him\nshares of stock and said they would buy those shares back once their company was in operation.\nAnd a year went by and nothing happened, so he sued them to get his money. And actually in\nthat suit someone, a deposition of him was taken. And when he sold that property he said, \u201cI will\ngive you the minerals and you may mine that property, but I want you to leave all the walnut,\nchestnut, and hemlock trees over ten inches,\u201d which made it impossible to strip mine. And so we\nactually argued initially it was not a Broad Form Deed, that this deed specifically was limited to\ndeep mining because it was impossible to strip mine, because he had said that. And on\ndeposition, which was... the deposition from his testimony was still in the courthouse. And in\nthe deposition he reasserted that, that he wanted those trees left alone. And that you could use\nthe smaller timbers as people did in deep mines. Timbers under ten inches were used for\nshorings in the deep mine workings. So that made good sense. He was saying, \u201cYou can have\nthe saplings, but I want those good trees left.\u201d So our local judge agreed with that and said,\n\u201cYou can\u2019t mine.\u201d So they appealed to the Court of Appeals and they won. The Court of\nAppeals, the intermediate appellate court said, \u201cWell that\u2019s just what these deed provisions say,\nbut the mineral owner still has the paramount right to mine under our decisions.\u201d So then we\ntook that case to the Supreme Court on discretionary review. We asked them to review that.\nThey took the case and so the amendment was argued, we argued the amendment on that. So\nGarnet, they never, they did not... anyway, when these minerals were sold, he did some, there\nwas very careful, plats were laid out and surveyed. And it was not, and when they filed this\nmining permit and claimed they owned the minerals where Garnet and Eugene lived, they didn\u2019t\n82\ndo that very well. Where they claimed their boundaries looked like went... she could make, we\ncould make a colorable assertion that that didn\u2019t coincide with those original plats. Because they\ndidn\u2019t prove that, clearly she should have had the right to those minerals, but we lost on that\nclaim. It\u2019s just an aside, but I think she probably didn\u2019t own the minerals. It couldn\u2019t clearly be\nshown that she owned the minerals. But we won the case, so that\u2019s the law. It was a big, nice\neffort to have been involved in and I think one of the important achievements that we made\nalong with many other cases I think the program\u2019s been able to bring.",
        "Q: When you first came to Prestonsburg, you and Jean, were you planning on really settling here,\nreally staying for the long haul?",
        "A: I doubt it. I mean I think we probably thought we might be here two or three years. It was a real\nbig transition for her, because she was, had never lived in a rural area or a town the size of\nGastonia, which was 25,000 or 30,000. She was from Philadelphia and had lived in Washington.\nI mean she had been in Southern communities, but she wanted to... she said if... when I looked\nfor a house, she wanted a sidewalk that she could roll the baby carriage on and be near a\nshopping area, not live out at David for example.",
        "Q: Is that what happened?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, I found a house in town that was kind of in a residential area. It\u2019s not where we live\nnow. We moved after ten years, out a little ways, near a school where Michael was going to\nelementary school. The kids went to, both of them went to a day care center at David. In David,\nthe development of the David community was another really major part of what we did in terms\nof economic development in a small community that we were able to purchase for a local\ncommunity development group. Help the development in that town.",
        "Q: Do you want to talk about David and your involvement there?",
        "A: David is about nine miles from Prestonsburg and in the 1930s, especially, it was a booming coal\ntown. It was what they called a model community, sort of like Wheelwright, or many of these\ncoal, you know most... Floyd county and this area had a number of coal camps. They were\nbasically company towns, because a company owned the homes where the people lived and the\ncompany paid them with scrip. And they owed their soul to the company store, as it were. But\nsome of the homes were quite nice. I mean, I think they were very nice communities and very\nclose communities. There were some employers that were better than others. And there were\nthe mine wars in Harlan County, all of the difficult history involving unionization. Where it was\nsuccessful, and where it wasn\u2019t. But David, the mine there was the Princess Coal Company.\nAnd David was mentioned, was named for a fellow named David Francis, who when I came\nhere, lived in Huntington. He still, that family owned the minerals. The only swimming pool in\nthis area, in this end of town was at David and people used to go out there to go swimming on\nthe train. They had a little airport. They had a school. It was a very vibrant mining community\nand when the mine closed in the \u201840s, it kind of went downhill. And it was purchased by... the\nbuildings, not the minerals, but the town of David, the ridge around it and the homes that were\nthere were, was purchased by a small group of businessmen here in Prestonsburg. And people\npaid rent to them. And a group of Catholic priests from St. Vincent\u2019s Mission came to David in\n83\nthe late \u201c60s and *70s and started teaching bible school and some literacy training. And\napparently they were approached by the businessmen to see if the mission was interested in\nbuying the town. I think they viewed themselves as absentee landlords and all they did was\ncollect the rent. They saw the water system going downhill. They didn\u2019t really, weren\u2019t\ninterested in developing the community. The homes were in pretty bad shape. They weren\u2019t\nreally slum lords, they just weren\u2019t doing anything to keep it up. It was a private water system.\nSo the Father, Matthew at the time, one day came to see me, and told us about the offer to buy\nthe town. They weren\u2019t interested in doing it, but they wondered whether we could, whether the\ncommunity might be able to buy it in some way, if they, we could figure out how to, help them\nfigure out how to do that. So, I asked a law student to do some research and we got a little help\nfrom the National Economic Development Law Center\u2019. And we decided, we put together an\neconomic development, a corporation, a Kentucky corporation. And we started having some\ncommunity meetings in David. And there was a company... the town wasn\u2019t working, but Island\nCreek Coal Company still had a store that they owned. The old company store. There was a\nfellow named Tiller\u00ae, who ran the store and who also, he read the Wall Street Journal. And he\nwas a very smart guy. He was an interesting man. So, they elected him as Chair of this group.\nAnd he became the first Chair of our little community development corporation. We didn\u2019t own\nanything yet, but they started planning. We started looking into the possibility of financing the\npurchasing of the town and how it might work. The problem was there was no water, the water\nsystem was unreliable. They had a pump that was literally held together by chicken wire. They\nwere afraid to take the gamble unless they had water. So we were sort of diverted for a couple of\nyears until we were able to figure out with our local area development district how to, ultimately\nwe were able to get a grant, which helped one of the existing water districts bring water to a\nnumber of their new customers in the rural part. The Beaver-Elkhorn water district supplied\nwater to a lot of the homes on Right and Left Beaver Creek. By getting them additional, those\nlines, they agreed they would run a line over to David, an extension. And we established a\nDavid Water District and went to the Public Service Commission to get approval to bring water\nto David through the water district, which would buy its water from this Beaver-Elkhorn Water\nDistrict that agreed to extend its lines. And when we got that done, by that time Mr. Tiller had\nbeen transferred to somewhere, Western Kentucky. People were afraid the corporation was\ngoing to go in, go down, because he was really sort of a driving force. But there was an old coal\nminer, retired, who had black lung, named Ashland Howard, whose nickname was \u201cHawk\u201d.\nAnd he had the energy and the spirit and the\u2014even though he may not have had the formal\neducation\u2014to push this group along. And he took over, became the Chair of that group. And\nwe then, once we got the water district in, we put together a financing package, where we had a\nfirst mortgage from the local bank here in Prestonsburg and a second mortgage from a group in\nWashington, called the Housing Assistance Council. And the idea was that if the corporation\ncould buy the property, all of David, then the renters could buy their homes in turn and the local\nbank would make those mortgages. So the bank would turn its money over quickly and get its\nmortgage paid back as people bought their houses. And the Housing Assistance Council in\nWashington helped, encourages developments of this sort. They were, I think we paid them back\ntwice as fast. So, we were able to purchase the town. We had another lawyer, by that time I had\nanother lawyer named Kay Adrion, who works over in Virginia now as a private practitioner.\nAnd she helped sort of put the deal together. And then after the town... we did all, this was a\n>? National Economic Development and Law Center (NEDLC), Oakland, California.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Claude Tiller\n84\nlarge amount of legal work. Public Service Commission, all this deed work. And we were also\nable to get the corporation to realize they needed to get some staff people. So we helped them to\nwrite a Vista grant to get a Vista out there. At the same time a young man named Danny Greene\nhad come to David and started a, at home, he had taken in some foster care kids. He came down\nas a volunteer with the Mission. And he started this David school, which over the years has\nobtained some national recognition for helping high school dropouts. He realized there was no\nreal alternative school here. Kids would drop out, that was the end of it. The schools really just\nwiped their hands of them. He bought the old store building. We bought most of the town, ridge\nto ridge. And he bought several others and was able to get some financing for the old store,\nwhich became the school. There\u2019s now a brand new building, which 1s very beautiful, that has\nbeen built in the meantime, and the story of the school, I\u2019ve been on their Board and we\u2019ve done\na lot of things together. But afterwards the corporation built and developed about twenty-five\nnew homes, Farmer\u2019s Home owned... put up new houses where the old ones were, had\ndeteriorated in one of the hollers. It\u2019s a very nice, attractive town now. It was sort of the\nAppalachian, we had this big battle over a strip mining permit at one point. There was a large\nblock of coal left underground. I said strip mining. There were some strip mining attempts that\nwe were able to fend off. But there was also a large amount of coal that had not been mined\nbecause they hit water in the mine. There was an attempt to re-open that, to start, to get a permit\nto mine that block of coal. And Danny and the community got very upset about that. And so we\nopposed that permit and there was a lot of community pressure, a lot of help. And thankfully\nthat was, we were able to fend that off. But we\u2019ve been very much, you\u2019ve had deep mining and\nstrip mining and coal truck traffic, all the problems that you see all over, in one little spot here in\nDavid. You have the craft co-operative as a little, as a new, which has become fairly successful.\nIt\u2019s anice community. There were actually, we had plans to develop other parts of David, to\nexpand it, but basically the community sort of decided it didn\u2019t want to get any bigger. It\u2019s a\nvery interesting place. And we learned a great deal and I think had a lot to be proud of in terms\nof what the community did and the role that we were able to play, because they could never\nafford it, that sort of legal work, help.",
        "Q: Okay, we were just talking a little bit, off tape, about how many things we\u2019d, I'd still like to\ncover about your time in Prestonsburg and working for, working with Appalred. And that we\nprobably don\u2019t have the time to get into it all today. So, I was thinking about, when we were just\ntalking a little bit, off tape, about your time here in Prestonsburg, and maybe you can reflect on\nyour work here and a little bit on just the, what you\u2019ve, it turns out that you\u2019ve devoted your life\nto. I mean you had the opportunity of becoming a chemical salesman and you decided that\nwasn\u2019t what you wanted to do. And you\u2019ve gone more and more in the direction of service. Any\nreflections or words on that?",
        "A: Well, I think what I\u2019m doing now has been in many ways has been most fulfilling over the last\nthirty years. Working with the Civil Rights Division was a great opportunity to learn to practice\nlaw and to do something very worthwhile. The big difference is that in the Civil Rights\nDivision, we didn\u2019t live in those communities and that we came and went. Whereas, and I have\ngreat admiration for the people who stayed there and their courage and how difficult their lives\nwere. The lives, the life we\u2019ve had for the last thirty years in Prestonsburg has been here. And I\nwouldn\u2019t at all compare myself to the African-Americans who lived in those communities and\nthe life they had and how difficult that was, because we are white. And we live 1n an area where\n85\nthere are very few African-Americans. And I think their life has been difficult at times although\nit\u2019s gotten much better. I mean there is also a fair amount of blatant racism in this particular\narea, and some of it is direct racism. But over the years I\u2019ve been able to recruit, at least the only\npracticing attorney in Eastern Kentucky right now, is the woman who has my office in Jackson\".\nShe\u2019s been there a number of years. And we\u2019ve tried unsuccessfully to recruit some others,\nbecause they don\u2019t...",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about African-Americans?",
        "A: Yeah, African-American lawyers, and paralegals. You have to have a support system as a\nminority person to live, I think, wherever you are. It\u2019s difficult to be alone. And in Hazard we\nhave a church to which Cynthia from Jackson belongs. And there are some black communities\nthat are concentrated in our areas. So the few people who have looked, that have really taken a\nlittle look at it, I think were, very cautious about, or were not convinced they could feel\ncomfortable living here. We do have a black secretary in Barbourville and one in Harlan and we\nhave a paralegal in Richmond, Richmond having a fairly much larger African-American\ncommunity. But the population is about ninety-eight percent white in our thirty-seven counties.\nBut I think the point I wanted to make was that we do, legal services offices are in the\ncommunities where our clients are and so you are much more associated and you are a part of\nthat community. I think we\u2019re a lot closer to our clients and you get to know your clients. And\nyou get to see the problems and live with the problems from day to day. Not to say that all of us\nare poor, but I think after your kids, especially when your children get into the schools, you\nbegin to feel that you have much more of a stake in trying to develop, do something about that\ncommunity. You find other parents who really want the best thing for their children, even\nthough it may be what we\u2019re doing in court is not always popular. Maybe our value systems are\nnot on the same track as the other lawyers who for a large part are driven by the money they are\ngoing to make in private practice. They do some good things in private practice along the way,\nbut generally in the social structure people are driven by money. So, I feel that the work we do,\nwe represent about 7,000 clients a year and much of the work we do, whether for each of those\nclients, the case we help them on is the most important thing in the world, whether you\u2019 ve got to\ntalk about an abused spouse or someone who\u2019s about to be evicted from an apartment or\nsomeone who we\u2019re helping with social security benefits or something small, or whether we\u2019re\ninvolved in some major issue involving the Broad Form Deed or safety discrimination, the cases\nthat tend to get the headlines. Or working on black lung, working on trying to help make black\nlung regulations more responsive, little more liberal, where more than five percent of the claims\nare approved. Or something like David. Each of those are a real, I think, positive contribution to\nhelping people lead better lives and making the society a more just one. So, I think it\u2019s, you\nasked me a while ago did I think we were going to be here thirty years when I came and I said I\nthought we\u2019d be here maybe two or three years. But I think the work has been so challenging\nand the opportunity to do this work has been a real privilege, that I always say we\u2019re fortunate at\nleast to be paid for doing something we want to do. And the government, state and federal\ngovernments are willing to provide funds to do it. I think the newer, our younger lawyers give\nup a great deal to work for us, because they are working at very low salaries and many of them\nhave large loan re-payments. They start at 25,000 dollars a year and some of them have really\nhuge debts of 80-90,000 dollars to their law schools. We have a small loan re-payment program\n6! John is referring to Cynthia Elliott, who was the only practicing Black attorney in Eastern Kentucky.\n86\nnow that helps them, up to 2,000 dollars a year. But they\u2019re the ones in a way who are, I think,\nmaking a substantial sacrifice to work. I mean you\u2019d hope that the government, we can do better\nthan that. That eventually we could work out, and develop more programs that would encourage\npeople to spend their lives in this sort of work. But I think it\u2019s been so, in part satisfying and\nchallenging and all those adjectives, that I\u2019ve enjoyed it. I probably, there may have been times\nthat Jean might have wondered whether we wouldn\u2019t be better off going for a better educational\nsystem for our kids. Michael was academically very gifted and sort of ahead of the pack. And\nwe had our difficult times, early times with... one of the teachers asked him to explain\nHanukkah, the Jewish holiday one day, and when he, I think the, some kids teased him while he\nwas doing that, made it a little difficult. Or when he was first learning to...",
        "Q: Teased him in terms of...?",
        "A: Presenting this Jewish ceremony. I don\u2019t remember all the details of it, but it hurt him because\nhe was doing it at their request. And I think it was strange. It was a time when they were still,\neven still doing bible...\nEnd of Tape 7, Side A\n87\nTape 7, Side B",
        "Q: Tape seven, side B. Go ahead.",
        "A: I remember the teacher virtually threatened him because he couldn\u2019t keep the crayons within the\nlines, which is still a problem for some children. I mean she was more concerned about his\ndrawing, keeping the crayons in the lines. And what, how that would, then realizing how, what a\nnegative reaction this could have on a child, who was basically an academically-gifted young\nboy. But you know, those were... the teacher eventually left, and we, I think we were fortunate\nthat we had some teachers who saw how bright he was and that he began, that he was able to get\nthe best for himself, was able to do quite well. And we had a principal who wanted, who was\nvery interested in the best, in providing good education for mountain kids, and who encouraged\nJean to help start a Gifted and Talented program in the school. And he never, there wasn\u2019t a\nsingle swing on the yard when we first came there. And so we put together a little committee\nand gradually got a coal company to do some grading and developed a wonderful playground\nwith the PTA, on the school grounds. And that he just, his name was John Pitts. He couldn\u2019t\nfigure out where he wanted to put the swings, so he hadn\u2019t put them anywhere. But he just\nneeded some help. And you know, and I think as people realize that what you want is the same\nthing they want. That what you\u2019re trying to do is really not a turnover, turn everything upside\ndown, that we\u2019re filing law suits every time... but what we\u2019re trying to do 1s help the community\nand be good citizens. Then you begin to feel that people are on your side, even if the few\nlawyers aren\u2019t, and that we have a lot of support in this community. And I remember in our PTA\nwhen the movement first started to put the Ten Commandments up on the walls of the\nclassrooms, which is something that\u2019s come back today again. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the\npaper, the Harlan County Board of Education voted to put the Ten Commandments on the walls,\neven though it\u2019s against the law and the Supreme Court has said you cannot do that. We had a\ndiscussion in our PTA, a very thoughtful discussion. And we had, there was, we had at least one\nfamily of Indians, not Native Americans, but from India. A surgeon, whose daughter was in\nMichael\u2019s class. And, you know, there were people, initially the reaction is what\u2019s wrong with\nthe Ten Commandments? They\u2019re perfectly good commandments. And you know, I could say,\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re the foundation of our faith as Jews, but they may not be the foundation of our\nIndian friends, and religions differ. And I would be the last person to say there\u2019s anything wrong\nwith the Ten Commandments, but they don\u2019t belong on the wall of the school right now.\u201d And\nthe attorney... at the time, they were waiting for the Attorney General to come out for an\nopinion. So, the resolution at that meeting was to wait until the Attorney General came out with\nan opinion. And people were quite comfortable with that. I\u2019m sure that if we hadn\u2019t been there,\nand I mean the point was... that was let\u2019s see, twenty years ago, that people accepted what we\nhad to say, and were respectful of what we had to say, and were willing to wait. And that\nwouldn\u2019t be always the case, I think, where you had folks who are very strong in their... and I\u2019m\nsure some of those people are, were members of fairly doctrinaire, Baptist and... churches, but\nthey were willing to say, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait.\u201d And I think those things always give you some hope, I\nmean give you cause for feeling good about, being proud of the people you are with. I mean I\u2019m\nnot always proud of everything everybody does, and you always wonder, but... So I think as we,\nboth Jean and I, got involved in a lot of educational advocacy work, that we sort of knew we\nwere here. Then when our daughter, Annie, did not do well academically as she got into high\nschool and had a lot more... she 1s a very social person and was friends with people who were\n88\nvery, very poor and friends with people who were quite rich. And she had a lot of kids who were\nfriends who were on the fringy group. And she was in high school and was not doing well. So\nanyway, she went to the David School, which didn\u2019t have many girls at the time and they were\nable to take her. She hadn\u2019t dropped out. She did really well there and thought the David School\nwas a wonderful place because of the one on one. And she had a very good math teacher who\nhelped her with her math. We got her back on the right track, academically. But it was very\nhard for me to take her... I mean I felt, I really wanted to stick with the public school, public\neducation. But they were losing her, and she was a good example of a student who should have\nstayed, who had, at least then, average academic skills, but was just an example of someone that\nfell between the cracks because the teachers were not paying attention. Which is something, I\nthink, we\u2019ve changed. And I think that we\u2019ve always continued to be involved in these kind of\nefforts to try to help out our schools and make this region a better place. And I think that\neducation has a lot to do with that. And I think we see in my work here in the office, we do a lot\nof work, we represent parents of kids who have special needs and the schools tend to, they don\u2019t\nwant to bother with them so often, unless you have a very committed teacher, who\u2019s going to\nwork with students like that. It\u2019s much easier to move them out of the way. So when we, I think\na lot of the cases we\u2019ve done, the consumer cases, all the cases I\u2019ve made reference to, the black\nlung work, where it\u2019s hard for, the organization wouldn\u2019t have anyone to assist them in these\nvery technical fields without spending a great deal of money. Helping them to write regulations\nthat will benefit them. AII these things have been really a great place for me to work and for the\nlawyers who worked in this program. I mean I think people who work in legal services across\nthe country who devote their lives or their careers to serving the poor, are a wonderful group, I\nhave a lot of admiration for them. So it\u2019s always nice for me to come to work every day, because\nit\u2019s such a good place to be.",
        "Q: I wondered, you mentioned that there is some racism in the area and you also talked a little\nearlier about how you had a difficult time when you first arrived, because people were thinking\nof you all as Communists or something like that. And you had trouble renting an office and so\nforth. Did you experience any anti-Semitism? Did people know that you were Jewish? Has that\nbeen a problem at all?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, many people in this area don\u2019t know, really have had no experience with Jews at\nall, or Quakers for that matter, I think. And so in the more recent years, I don\u2019t spend a lot of\ntime at it, but I\u2019ve been to church groups and talked about Judaism. Maybe the Klan, the few\nmembers of the Klan, when they get together, their constitution talks about the white, Aryan\nrace, and Jews, money-making Jews, and that kind of thing. I\u2019ve never been conscious, really of\nanti-Semitism here in any major way. I know that those, I know that people who are strong\nChristians do feel that if you\u2019re not saved, you\u2019re going to Hell. And so they have a real concern\nabout us, whom they may like and they don\u2019t want us to go to hell. And they would like us, I\u2019m\nsure, to be saved.",
        "Q: Do they try to convert you?",
        "A: No, I think... Annie probably went to more church, was, went to church more, because she spent\nmore weekends with friends who went to church, some of whom are more evangelical than\nothers. We have been invited to many churches. And we have gone to, more to the Presbyterian\n89\nchurch than others because, probably the Catholics and the Presbyterians have run more\nprograms for poor people. And in this area over time, St. Vincent\u2019s Mission came in here. Or\nmaybe not the Catholic church as such, but the ministry. They brought more, while they are also\nattempting to increase the number of Catholics in their ranks, I think their message of being\nsocially concerned has been stronger than that of the other faiths, even though they are a\nminority. The Presbyterian church was always very active with its Christian Service ministry.\nAnd it\u2019s not as fundamental as the Baptist church and some of their beliefs with respect to Jesus.\nSo when Jean, as I said from the beginning was working with the Meals on Wheels program and\na number of their related programs in this Christian Service ministry, we\u2019ve gone there many\ntimes. But there\u2019s never been any real, I mean we\u2019ve known all of their ministers. In recent\nyears there\u2019s been a much more sharing between rabbis and ministers. Now here, the Ministerial\nAssociation, they had a Catholic priest that was here when we first came, named Father... oh\ngosh, what\u2019s his name? Getting a little tired. Young Catholic priest was here. It will come to\nme ina moment. And they wouldn\u2019t let him in, wouldn\u2019t let him in the Ministerial Association.\nHe\u2019d tend to wear moccasins around and wear blue jeans and was always a little bit out front on\nsome of the social issues, working with welfare folks, and asking people about this being the way\nJesus would have it. He finally, I think, five or six years later, put a Christmas card in the paper,\nwishing all of his ministers well at Christmas, hoping they would have a nice Christmas. He\nguilt-tripped them into it. They finally let him in. But there was that kind of thing, but there\u2019s\nnever really been, I don\u2019t know, people have always been very nice to us maybe because, more\nabout who we are than what the religion is. I\u2019m sure they would welcome our, many of the\nchurches would have welcomed the conversions. Or the fundamental religion, especially.\nWe\u2019 ve been to many funerals, I mean, when you get to these, especially when you go to a funeral\nwhere they preach over, about salvation and that you simply, you know, you\u2019re doomed if you\u2019re\nnot saved. And they\u2019re looking at you. (Laughing.) But they mean well. I mean that\u2019s what it\nis, they feel like we\u2019re going to be lost if this doesn\u2019t happen.",
        "Q: Would you just talk a little bit about your and Jean\u2019s practice as far as faith, religion? You go to\nsynagogue once a month? You go to a Quaker meeting once a month?",
        "A: Yeah, well we, while the kids were, we sort of maintain the Jewish tradition, Friday nights,\nSaturday, not every Friday night, but especially when everybody is together. And we go to\nservices now more regularly since we go to Williamson West Virginia, for the Jewish services.\nThey are on Sunday night, as I mentioned. It\u2019s a rabbi comes down from Huntington, so he has a\nFriday night service on a Sunday night. The Quakers meet monthly in somebody\u2019s home. And\nof course you can have a Quaker meeting whether you have three people or three thousand,\nbecause they are silent meetings for worship. And people get up and say something during the\nsilence, if they are led to say something. And it may go on for half an hour, it may go the whole\nhour and nobody says anything. Or it maybe that someone has a comment that is on their mind\nand many people speak. In the more organized communities in the East, you have this group of\noverseers. I mean the meeting has to have an administration with dues and Sunday school and\nall of that. But this is a very informal group. There is an annual meeting of Quakers in\nKentucky which we haven\u2019t been to in a while. But the participants here are generally a couple\nin Hazard and a woman who teaches at the Pine Mountain Settlement School and a woman who\nis a doctor in Hyden, who is in her seventies and has been there for maybe twenty-five or thirty\nyears, I guess, who\u2019s a teacher. But he was a doctor and she\u2019s a Quaker, very interesting person,\n90\nwho lives up a holler in Hyden in a small house with... all these hundreds of goldfinches that are\nusually there. A very nice location. And then there have been some Mennonite volunteers, who\nhave come to Quaker meeting during their volunteer period. So the group is a little bit fluid,\nalthough there is this permanent group, if you will. The couple in Hazard work for the rural\nhealth system and they\u2019 ve been there for several years. So they meet once a month and they\nwere in Prestonsburg a few weeks ago. The next time will be in Hazard or at the Pine Mountain\nSettlement School. That woman is in her seventies, also.",
        "Q: And do you always go to the Quaker meetings, too?",
        "A: And I always go. I\u2019m a very big fan of Quakerism. I mean I would not, not to convert. It is a\nvery tolerant religion, built on faith, and the light that shines on everyone. And I don\u2019t know that\nthere\u2019s a great enormous amount of difference, except that it\u2019s built on the teachings of Jesus,\nessentially. But they don\u2019t dwell on salvation and the other parts of it. I think they really dwell\non living your life out in a full life and serving others, and the principles of humanity that I share\nand that I feel good about. So I think it\u2019s been pretty easy for us to adapt to each other. I\u2019ve\nprobably spent more time now with the Quaker part of it. I really haven\u2019t studied Quakerism that\ncarefully. I\u2019ve read a lot of books and probably will some time, as I should read about Judaism.\nAnd I haven\u2019t done as much of that also, a little here and a little there. But I\u2019d like to that a little\nbit more. I\u2019ve got plenty of other things I also want to read. Right? Like you do.",
        "Q: And how did you raise your kids? Were they involved in both religions?",
        "A: They were involved in both, although as I said, Michael, we didn\u2019t have Quaker meetings back\nthen. We had some of the state gatherings. This group is a relatively recent phenomenon of the\nlast three or four years. It was really sparked by the people in Hazard. And we didn\u2019t go\ninitially. We were when Michael, I guess in our earlier years, we pretty much went to services in\nAshland and took Michael when he was little, and Annie. They were the only children their age\nat that time. And we would go fairly regularly, but we always went during the Jewish holidays.\nAnd the Quaker tradition doesn\u2019t have a lot of formal ceremony with it as Judaism does around\nthese holidays. So we would celebrate those and we would go to Passover. We had Passover\nSeders at our house, which Jean and maybe the others would, she did the cooking and became\nfairly well-versed in what\u2019s involved. Did some reading and embarrassingly probably knows\nmore about some of those traditions now than I do. But that\u2019s the way the kids were raised. And\nMichael, as I told you, I spent more time with Michael probably talking about, doing sort of a\nlight Sunday school lesson every Sunday for several years. That was part of our tradition at\nhome. I didn\u2019t do that with Ann Louise for, I\u2019m not sure exactly why. I think... who knows\nwhy? But I didn\u2019t. More recently she has become much more interested in both. I think she\nwas, as Jean was relating to you, very concerned about the Nazis, the history, the danger that it\nposed and still is worried about some goofy Klansperson coming to the house and doing\nsomething.",
        "Q: To you in particular?",
        "A: Yeah. She has become, both of the kids will be home for the Jewish holidays, I think. I don\u2019t\nknow about Annie, for sure, because she works on Saturdays. But neither of them... and\n9]\nMichael will be home. Rosh Hashanah falls on a weekend. I don\u2019t know if he will come on\nYom Kippur. Now someone would say, \u201cHow could you work on Yom Kippur?\u201d And he might\nor might not. But those are their lines to draw. I mean it would have been unthinkable for\nanybody to work on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur when I was growing up. And so they still\nhave to find their own, figure out, I guess, what they want to do in terms of their religious... or\nhow religious they\u2019re going to be. Either way, either way, I think though Annie\u2019s now becoming\na little more interested. Although she hasn\u2019t been going to the synagogue in Louisville. She and\nI went to a Unitarian service together in Lexington a couple of years ago. But we feel okay\nabout it.",
        "Q: Do you want to say something in closing now?",
        "A: Like a prayer? (Laughing.)",
        "Q: Would you lead us in a prayer?",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t imagine anybody listening to all these tapes. I was saying to Jean, \u201cMaybe...\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cWell, can I listen to them?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, you wouldn\u2019t want to listen to all this.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWell, maybe somebody wants to listen to this history years from now or maybe the kids\nwould want to look in some archive, right?\u201d No, it was nice of you to be interested to do it, to\nlisten to it. And I\u2019m sure we still haven\u2019t covered a lot of ground. But it would be true if I did\none of you, even though you probably wouldn\u2019t think so, but we all could spend a lot of time.\nI\u2019ve just been fortunate, probably to have had such an interesting career in these two legal jobs,\nwith the Division and with legal services. And now that I\u2019m also interested in the Science Center\nand other community activities that we\u2019ve been involved in. Just have a lot of interests that I'd\nlike to pursue, that happen to be, I think, in areas that can affect other people and help them in a\npositive way, besides me. And I like to do it, so I think that\u2019s been a real reward. And you can\ncome back in thirty years, and maybe when [ hit a hundred, I'll reflect on the last forty.",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s a good idea. Okay, Ill see you in thirty years. Well, thank you.\nEnd of Tape 7, Side B\n92\nTape 8, Side A",
        "Q: Okay, it\u2019s May 27\", 2000 and we\u2019re several months later, picking up on our interview with John\nRosenberg and so this is actually tape eight, side A.",
        "A: Tape eight?",
        "Q: Yeah. So, going back, we were just talking a little bit off tape about some of your, about some of\nyour speaking experiences and things that you\u2019ve brought up or drawn upon when you\u2019ve gone\nto commencement addresses and so forth. And one of the things that you mentioned was the last\ncase that you had before you left the Justice Department which had to do with the Kent State\nUniversity violence. Can you talk about your role in that and your point of view about what\nhappened?",
        "A: Well, I mean my role was, at the time was as Chief of the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights\nDivision. Because this involved the National Guard and potentially other police officials, state\nofficials, the Justice Department is called in to investigate. Potentially there is a federal crime\nwhen police officials act illegally or summarily and what we call summary punishment by not\narresting, for example, students who do something wrong, but rather they overreact and shoot or\npunish or beat whoever the victim might be. So, when this happened, this incident happened and\nwas called to our attention, my job was to write a request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\nto investigate, to see whether a violation of federal law had occurred. And so, that being May\nof\u2014how many years ago?\u20141970, thirty years ago, I drafted that request, which then was sent\nout under the name of the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, who I believe\nat the time was Jerry Leonard. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have to go dig it out or I don\u2019t even know if I\nhave a copy of it, you know, it would be fairly thorough about where they would be interviewing\nany witnesses who were there and whether they, the police officials in fact were threatened or\nthere was any reason that would justify their having used force in shooting those students who\nwere killed. There was a long grand jury convened after I left. As I recall it was actually\ninconclusive. I think there was no federal trial. I think there were civil trials later which I\u2019m not\nsure, it seemed to me they may have recovered some damages for the families of the children, of\nthe students who had been killed. It was just a very tragic event. There were others at the time.\nI recall, I think when we were speaking, I had seen an article recently before I gave the\ncommencement address here at Prestonsburg Community College, which happened to have been\nwritten by the President of Kent State University. It was sort of a memorial column or just\nrecalling those tragic events and the fact that they were in the memory of the President and\npeople who were at Kent State now. And that the school itself had made great progress in the\nintervening years and that this awful event was a milestone, obviously, in the history of the\nschool, which sort of marred its reputation, along with... or which they felt marred its reputation.\nIt was not forgotten, but that since then the school had progressed and had moved into the age of\ntechnology and that she was very proud of their progress. And I happened to be particularly\nmoved by the way that she ended the column, which was that in this age of technology, it was\nimportant not to lose our humanity. And so I was, used her, some of her quotations in\nconcluding this address that I gave to the local students. And it reminded me that it was also sort\nof one of the last things we did, that I did at the Justice Department, before we left on our\nvacation, but really left. And then were headed for Appalachia.\n93",
        "Q: So you just filed the case, but you didn\u2019t investigate it?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t, no. My job basically, if... had I stayed, the office, the lawyers who worked with\nme and for me as Chief of the Criminal Section... after, the way those things would work 1s that\nwhen the FBI goes through its investigation and prepares a report, those are usually turned over\nto the United States Attorney for prosecution or for determination of whether a crime has been\ncommitted. And generally then if there is some conflict, in other words when the officers say, \u201cI\nthought that it looked like the student had a gun and that we had to shoot the student or we would\nhave been killed,\u201d those factual disputes, someone has to resolve them by generally going to a\ngrand jury, which is what happened. And then either the U.S. Attorney co-operatively with\nlawyers from the Civil Rights Division, or... would make that presentation, but we left. That\nwas at the point after I had authored and drafted this report, this request, was when we left. And\nso the investigation really went on and I believe one of my colleagues, Jim Turner, who was sort\nof one notch up in the hierarchy as a Deputy Attorney General, was sent out there and that he\nspent several months, along with reviewing the reports and working with the grand jury and then\ndetermining whether someone should be indicted or not. I want to think that there was never,\nthat there were no federal indictments, but I may be wrong. It seems to me that was one of the\nsad things, that this was one of those, one of those sort of inconclusive... there were, on the face\nof it you would think that there was no reason to shoot students, because they were certainly not\narmed. And that they got caught in the, were victims of what happened. But I\u2019m not sure that\nanyone was actually ever accused of having, of criminally having done this. That there was\nsome evidence in the heat of the moment that these folks felt threatened, their lives were\nthreatened. And that they, while they may have been negligent or they may have, whatever they\ndid, that there was enough justification to make them question, that they made a bad decision,\nbut it wasn\u2019t, certainly wasn\u2019t intentional on their part. And that it may have been enough to\nwarrant civil proceedings. But that\u2019s the way those things always, you know, went. And so in\nother circumstances, like when I was in the Houston case, we also asked the FBI to investigate\nand to assist us in determining, looking at records and other areas. And then the lawyer who is\nresponsible for the case, as I was in the Houston case with other lawyers working with me and\nwere working under my direction, then I would present the case to the judge. That\u2019s how those\nthings work. We\u2019re done. I didn\u2019t do any more in Kent State. I mean that was, most of that then\nhappened after I left. So it was a memory and this article that I happened to see in the newspaper\nsort of jogged my mind back. It\u2019s sort of the punctuation mark. It\u2019s the point at which we left.",
        "Q: I wonder also if you had, at the time if you felt, you had mentioned in the earlier sessions of this\ninterview how much you idealized this country and its constitution and the principles on which it\nwas founded, and that you really held, had high expectations of it. During the Vietnam War did\nyou feel disillusioned with this country and its government? Or did that change your perspective\nat all?",
        "A: Well, I mean, I think there are lots of times when you wish political decisions were made, were\ndifferent. I mean I think that everyone 1s, that a lot of people are sad about our involvement in\nthe Vietnam War. I was in the war, served during the time of Korea. It was obviously... and as I\nprobably said before, there were lots of reasons I enjoyed the time I spent in the Service. We\n\u00b0 Actually was Deputy Assistant Attorney General.\n94\nmade a lot of very close friends, who I continue to see and hear from, and get together with\nperiodically. And I think you feel that you are doing something worthwhile when you\u2019re in the\nService. And helping this country in a small way. But that I also noted that when, during the\nSuez Canal Crisis, when we were on alert for a week and no one was quite certain which side we\nwere on, and that because the United States hadn\u2019t made up its mind which side we were on, and\nIsrael was one of the partners, was one of the main parties involved in that dispute, the thought\nthat we would be in a conflict with Israel was not very appealing to me, but that it just let me\nknow how much of a, that this was not what I wanted to do (laughing), to be regimented 1n that\nway. So that staying in the Service was not anything that I wanted to do. On the other hand, I\nalways, I think that it\u2019s a very dangerous occupation. And I feel those people who are in the\nMilitary for a career, who really believe that this is an important thing to do, often that we owe a\nlot to people who have been, who have served in our Military, and who have either given their\nlives or come back wounded or who are veterans. And I\u2019m sure now we much, recognize much\nmore the people in Vietnam, who may not have won a war, were nevertheless there because they\nwere doing what they were told to do. And of course a lot of people were willing, were\nConscientious Objectors and didn\u2019t go. My personal feeling is if someone\u2019s a Conscientious\nObjector they ought not to go. And we ought to let them not go. There are plenty of people who\nwant to go or who were willing to go or there were and there were things that could be done. So,\nI don\u2019t know that I, I\u2019m not disillusioned. I\u2019m still very much a, feel very strongly that, I guess\nmaybe it\u2019s a little rhetoric, but I feel that this is still the best country in many, many ways in the\nworld. There are a lot of imperfections with it, that we... and some of the issues that we have to\nresolve are very difficult issues. When we see in this area the economy being as poor as it is.\nWe\u2019ve lost a lot of jobs here. Trying to catch up. What I spoke about at PCC, of course, that,\nthat the Kent State thing related to, I asked, I emphasized to the students how much they should\nbe grateful for being in this free country. It was also the, the week of the graduation was also the\nweek of Law Day, in which we celebrate our freedom and the Constitution under which we live.\nAnd it was also the anniversary of Holocaust Remembrance Day. And it was the anniversary,\nthe thirty year anniversary of Kent State. And I think all of those are messages that we need to\nremember and reflect upon. I think we do have a legal system that really is the basis for the\nfreedom that we have. And a lot of those freedoms are at times tenuous. You worry when the\nKlan, you wish we did not have the Klan around, but the fact that we allow them to exist under,\nin a restricted way still is part of the freedom that we can enjoy. And I think all of those kinds of\nissues sort of tumble around together. And yet we, we have to be, we\u2019re always balancing those\nthings. And I think the political system that we\u2019re under, where we flip back and forth between a\nDemocratic party in control and the Republican party in control at the state and national\ngovernment, kind of keeps everybody off balance, at the state level and the federal level. But it\nseems to make us sort of come out in the middle and even though lots of things go on that we\ndon\u2019t like. I mean I wish we had greater funding for legal services at the state and federal level.\nAnd sometimes Congress, the legislation we have on, that affects welfare moms seems very\npunitive, at times. And I know we could do better with that. We clearly need a better health care\nsystem, there are lots of places where we can improve, where we ought to improve, being as rich\nas this country is. We seem not to regard people, the problems poor people have as seriously as\nwe ought to. Well, that\u2019s a rambling answer. I can\u2019t even remember, it seemed to me that we\nstarted with Kent State and we kind of got into what I was talking about, but it all kind of goes\ntogether.\n95",
        "Q: Yeah. Kind of related to what you were saying, can you talk more, you had mentioned that\nsometimes, you mentioned off tape and I\u2019d like to get this on tape, that you mentioned when you\ngo to speak at various places within the community, people are interested in, partially interested\nin hearing you speak because of your Holocaust-related experiences. And maybe you can talk\nabout your, your invitation to speak at the hundred-year anniversary of one of the black churches\nhere and also talk about why you think it is that people want to hear about that particular aspect.",
        "A: Well, I think that the black church, the name right now escapes me, probably shouldn\u2019t. The\nhundredth anniversary was an event they\u2019d worked on, was quite a significant event for the\nchurch. There are two churches in Wheelwright, Kentucky and this is one of them. And they\nhad been planning this anniversary for some time and have had a series of ministers over the\nyears and it\u2019s a very cohesive community. And I think, probably, one of the reasons they asked\nme to speak was because they related, they knew that I was Jewish and that I had been involved\nas a legal services lawyer and perhaps as a Justice Department lawyer in some civil rights issues\nover time. But also that I was a, that my family had escaped from the Holocaust and they knew\nsome of that history. And I think they analogized it in their own way to the discrimination that\nthey had felt and that they wanted me maybe to reflect upon the f act that there were people who\nwere white and who were discriminated against because they were Jewish or for reasons other\nthan race. But that someone, a family lived in this community that had shared some of that\nhistory that their own families and ancestors had experienced over their lifetime. I know that, I\nthink in the schools, I think that the schools now have made the Holocaust a very much a part of\ntheir curriculum. When I go, I\u2019ve spoken to middle school students and elementary school and\nhigh school students. And when I ask how many of them know who Ann Frank was or whether\nthey have done a unit on Ann Frank, almost every hand goes up in the room. I think that unit is\nprobably done in the fifth and sixth grade and in the seventh grade. And that, but the fact, I think\nteachers tell me, the fact that they see someone who 1s alive and who can come into their class\nand say this is what happened to my family. I was eight years old when they arrested my father\nand took him to the concentration camp. Or I was standing in the courtyard when they were\ndynamiting the synagogue. That is always more, it makes a stronger point than having heard it\nfrom a third person. And if it\u2019s someone in their own community that I suppose has been\nidentified as having some credibility, that doesn\u2019t just make these stories up. I think when you,\nyou always tend to put some faith and trust 1n people that have lived with you a long time, who\nare part of the community. It\u2019s kind of like any other, listening to older, someone described the\nhistory of the May house or the May family or their own family history. When they\u2019ve grown up\nhere it means more. At least I think that\u2019s, whenever you find someone, whether it\u2019s the war, my\nneighbor used to, my neighbor must have been on every beach. He died a few years ago, but he\nwas one of those Appalachian soldiers who was drafted and lived through every beach assault in\nthe Pacific. And even if he tells it in a low key sort of conversational way, it\u2019s very powerful to\ntalk to someone who lived it.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, considering your significant experience, you spent a lot of time working on civil\nrights and a lot of time here in Appalachia working on helping the poor with legal services. And\nit\u2019s interesting that the thing that people would pick out when they want to hear something from\nyou, is this thing that really happened in your distant past and really has to do with your roots,\nwhich hasn\u2019t been so much the focus of your very significant work and interesting work. Do you\nthink, I\u2019m trying to... there\u2019s kind of a question in there somewhere, but I think, you know,\n96\nthere\u2019s some key maybe to your roots which came up in the earlier interviews, too. That you\nmentioned that where you come from and your escape from the Nazis has been a very important\npart of the work that you have subsequently done. Or that it\u2019s something that you\u2019ve kept in\nmind, but we didn\u2019t really go into very much detail about that. Has it been... is that something\nthat you really think about a lot, about the Holocaust era and about your family and about...\nmaybe can you just talk more about that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s with me every day. I think that... and I think I\u2019ve spoken about this before.\nWell, before I forget it, I think in my earlier, when I talked about commencement talks or just\ngenerally about legal services, I really did not speak, talk much about the Holocaust unless I was,\nunless... I mean some of the church groups, when we first came Jean was... we were involved\nwith the Presbyterian church a good bit because they did a lot of social, were more involved in\nlocal social projects. They started Meals on Wheels and Christian Service Ministry that she was\ninvolved with. And so the ministers who knew that we were involved, had Passovers and that I\nwas Jewish and some of that developed into, people, by word of mouth realized that I wasn\u2019t\nborn in this country and that I did have this experience. But it wasn\u2019t, I guess in more recent\nyears, I\u2019ve had more, probably as people learned and as I spoke more about the Holocaust and\nabout being Jewish, that there have been more, there\u2019s been a bit more of an awareness about the\nHolocaust. I think partly because of the Holocaust Memorial and there\u2019s been more publicity\ngenerally about the importance of this whole era and trying to make people remember it and not\nlet it be forgotten. That all probably is part of the reason why this has come up. And I think that\ntying it into Law Day is something that has gotten around among the teachers, that that\u2019s\nsomething I\u2019m willing to speak about or can speak about on Law Day, that may be more\nmeaningful to students than just talking about the Constitution or how the legal system works,\nwhich is the other thing that we generally do when we go to the schools. Well, I don\u2019t have any\ndoubt that the history, that our fleeing from Germany and coming to this country and being\ngrateful for the opportunity to be free here, has sort of moved me into public service work. I\nthink that\u2019s pretty clear. When I was in the military, I think it probably in a way helped move me\nto go to the Service as well. I don\u2019t know that I went into the ROTC, which helped partly also\nwith tuition. Back then it was one of the ways of making Duke affordable, which was an\nexpensive school. But I mean, whether it\u2019s just the rationalization or the reason, I think I\ncertainly felt that being in the Service was one way of trying to help fulfill my, help me give\nsomething back. You can stay out of the Service. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t have to do that. But that was\nduring a time that people also were being drafted. And that if you didn\u2019t want to be an enlisted\nman and wanted to do more with your career in the Service... I guess my bigger decision was\nthat I was, I did have the option after coming out of Duke as a chemistry major, of going to work\nin the Military as being in something that was more science-related back then, working, using\nmy chemistry degree. And I decided really not to do... I decided I was either going to fly and\nthen ultimately became a navigator. Because the pilot training didn\u2019t really work out. But I, so\nI\u2019m sure that was probably, sort of an adventuresome kind of thing to do. It would be more\ninteresting than being in a lab. I knew that I probably might want to sell chemicals some day. I\nreally hadn\u2019t decided my long-term career goals. But I flirted around when I came out of the\nService and went back to Rohm and Haas as a technical representative for a chemical company.\nI don\u2019t know whether we... did we talk about that?",
        "Q: Yeah.\n97",
        "A: So, I flirted around for a little bit at one point about going to Rabbinical school and decided not\nto do that. But I\u2019m sure that what, that going into the civil rights work and being, and wanting to\ndo public service work has been to some extent influenced by, and maybe a large extent,\nprobably a lot of it is subconscious, the fact that I want to feel that the contribution I can make in\nhelping other people in this country, who are not as well off, is just a way of helping to give\nback. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s any sort of sacrifice. I just feel like there are lots of ways to spend\nyour life. And if some people want to spend it practicing law in one way or another, that\u2019s their\nchoice. But it\u2019s a much more, this is part of it, but I don\u2019t feel that I had any obligation to do\nthis. I just, I\u2019m sure that having that history in our family in a major way influenced us, as well\nas... I mean, my father and mom, my father worked in the textile plant. He was a teacher. My\nbrother is in public service, worked for the government all of his life. My sister was an architect\nworking for the state on issues affecting handicapped people, an architectural barriers person.\nSo, and just recently finished law school, and is now thinking about how to use the law degree in\na helpful, probably together... I don\u2019t know that she will be going into legal services, but I... I\nmean I don\u2019t know that my motivations are really, I think all of the lawyers and people who do\npublic service work, whether our daughter, who 1s in social... working on a social work degree,\nand working with developmentally-disabled people now in Louisville. Or our son who works\nwith students who have academic difficulties. Or your or whoever the other people, who are in\npublic service life, who choose to make that their life and feel that service is a way to live out\nyour life in a meaningful way...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side A\n98\nTape 8, Side B",
        "Q: All right, this 1s tape eight, side B. And uh, related to your work or to your experiences with\nspeaking to groups, you had mentioned a little bit earlier that you have on Law Day talked about\nthe Holocaust. And what do you talk about when you talk about the Holocaust on Law Day\u2019?",
        "A: Well, I talk about the contrast between a society that we have in this country, where we have a\ngovernment and a nation, which is governed by the rule of law and what happened in Fascist\nGermany where the legal system was basically put aside for a dictatorship. And that the kinds of\nthings that were able to happen in the Holocaust, which was a result of Hitler\u2019s fanaticism. And\nwhat did happen in that dictatorship, and how, again, grateful we need to be and how they,\nstudents, can reflect on or ought to reflect, and their teachers and all of this ought to reflect on\nthe system we have in this country, which would not, hopefully, permit anything like that to\nhappen. That the checks and balances in the legislative, executive and judicial systems would\nkeep that from happening. And that we have, that free speech 1s important and that all of the\nguarantees that we have under the Constitution and under the Bill of Rights are very meaningful\nand that it\u2019s important to talk about them. So I use, I guess the family\u2019s personal experiences,\nand I talk a little bit about the history of how all this came about in the 1930s from Hitler\u2019s rise\nto power. How during the war, I mean even afterwards, how people would like to pretend in\nGermany that no one knew about it and this all sort of just happened and people are looking the\nother way. At least were looking the other way and most, I suspect, did know about what was\ngoing on in the Death camps. That\u2019s what I try to focus on and I think the teachers seem to\nappreciate that and seem to feel that it\u2019s a good way to have their students appreciate Law Day.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you just talk about... you had mentioned in the first sessions that we did, something\nabout the relationship between Judaism and justice, and it was something that you said that you\nhad thought about. Would you elaborate on that some?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember what I said at the time, but the important tenet, I guess, of Judaism is the\nemphasis on justice, study and justice. That the Ten Commandments and having a society where\nbeing just to each other and where you have a governing, legal codes that govern Judaism, which\nare principles of living really. The major ones. I might have said that those principles probably\nhelped to influence me and the work that I do. I remember when we were just talking about Law\nDay, usually when I begin a talk, I talk a little bit about the fact that we\u2019ve been, who we are and\nwho I am, that I\u2019m here in Prestonsburg. We\u2019ve lived in Floyd County all these years. And talk\na little about our legal services agency and try to describe that we do have a system in this\ncountry that provides lawyers for people who can\u2019t afford lawyers, on the criminal and on the\ncivil side. And that what this program, what Appalred and other civil legal services programs do\nand how difficult it is. Many times it 1s basically impossible to navigate through the legal system\nwithout having a lawyer to help you, so that poor people are often on the short end of business\ntransactions and many other people lose rights. They lose benefits to which they are entitled.\nAnd the kind of work that defenses in eviction cases, consumer cases, all the work that we have\ndone. The Broad Form, environmental work. So I try to also mention that. So, going back to\nwhat you were asking me, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s any easier... I mean I think all religions,\nwhether it\u2019s Christianity with Jesus\u2019 sort of different, somewhat little different spin on the loving\naspect of God, that it\u2019s not as much of the retribution and thunder that you read about in the Old\n99\nTestament. But that any, I know there are a lot of people in legal services and folks have written\nabout, who, even who have had backgrounds in Divinity School, or who feel that by helping, by\nusing their legal talents to help people who are oppressed or who are poor or have been\ndiscriminated in one way or another, that that is a good way for them to live out their life and\ntheir principles and their values. And providing legal services for low income people, I don\u2019t\nthink that that\u2019s... there\u2019s anything particularly unique about being Jewish in that way. I just,\nprobably anyone who feels that their, that religion and a belief in God is part of their personality\nor their person, would feel the same way about that, I think. I mean, we have people in legal\nservices who are very religious. They\u2019re Catholic, Protestant, Jewish. And we have many\npeople who are not religious, just as, I\u2019m sure, other professions do.",
        "Q: The question that had come to my mind before, that had slipped out, was kind of related to\nsomething that, when I\u2019ve interviewed other Holocaust survivors, that gets brought up a lot. And\nI don\u2019t know whether you\u2019 ll have anything to say to it or not. But often I hear people say that\nthey feel, hear people state an opinion about whether a Holocaust could happen again. And\nmany people say, \u201cI think this is going to happen again.\u201d That there is going to be some kind of\nmass persecution of the Jewish people. And some people feel like that\u2019s not going to happen,\nbut a lot of... 1t just comes up, and I\u2019m wondering whether you feel like... you were talking a\nlittle bit earlier about the legal system in this country. Do you feel like that system 1s really\nstable enough so that there is not potential for that kind of disruption or do you feel like it is\npossible for something like that to happen in this country?",
        "A: In this country? I would like to think that 1t could not happen in this country in our lifetime or in\nanybody else\u2019s lifetime. I think that when you read about any sort of fanatical behavior, when\nyou read about... it\u2019s only been a hundred years or a little more, well a hundred fifty years since\nlynchings were pretty commonplace in the South. And we had a, quote, \u201clegal system\u2019, that was\nnot as... we didn\u2019t have transportation systems, and we lacked a lot of the modern conveniences,\nso that I think our life was a lot more rural. But it seems to me that communities were pretty\nheartless about... I mean that there was, in the South more so than any where else, but on a large\nscale, African-Americans were property. I mean they were property. And anyone, and people\nseemed to accept that in a fairly major way. I don\u2019t know that it would happen just to Jews. And\nobviously the Klan had put Jews and Catholics into a group, blacks. But you know, we see\nthings, we see the American Indian in this country for years having, in not the very distant past,\nbeing treated as a second-class citizen. You see... but in the next fifty years probably the white\npopulation as it is, or, quote, \u201cCaucasian\u201d population, will probably be a minority in this country.\nSo I don\u2019t know. I do think that people can be fairly heartless. I mean we\u2019ve had this, even with\nthe go around with theTen Commandments we\u2019 ve had in this state recently, that we have\neducators and superintendents who don\u2019t seem to get it, and don\u2019t understand or can\u2019t understand\nwhy anyone would object to putting those Ten Commandments on the walls of the school or a\npublic building. I mean that\u2019s always pretty scary to me, and they wield a lot of influence. And\nthey could be leading, they could decide that they\u2019re going to march on any one of us. Any\nlawyer who lived in a local community that promoted, who was representing the other side. I\ndon\u2019t know that you would see anything like what happened in Germany, on that massive a\nscale, where you\u2019re filling boxcars with thousands of people on a schedule that end up being\ncremated and killed and gassed. But I think people can, there are leaders that appeal to emotions\nand that in, just the same as the abortion clinics, you have folks who would like to defend the\n100\nfact that they can kill somebody because their view is different than their own. So I think it\u2019s\npossible and I think it is probable they\u2019II continue to happen as long as you have open gun, as\nlong as gun laws are the way they are. And as long as you have people who believe in these\nfairly, I don\u2019t know, fundamentalist religions. Wars are fought. All the things that we\u2019ve seen in\nthe last few years, and maybe this country 1s a little different because of its tendency to become\nmore homogeneous, both culturally and racially. But you think of all the Tutsis and the Hindus\nand you think Kosovo and you see all of these people and you see massive... as far as they\u2019re\nconcerned it is a Holocaust. Right? I mean they are being killed in massive numbers. We just\naren\u2019t there. I don\u2019t know and you feel pretty helpless over here trying to do anything about it.\nSo I don\u2019t know, we can always rationalize it by saying those aren\u2019t very civilized countries. But\nall of these things seem to be done... I mean look at Israel and the Arab countries. Both sides,\ncertainly the Arabs, think that all of this is for Allah, and most of these massive killings are\nreligious wars. And they are done in the name of God for one side or the other. Or the ethnic\nissues up there in Russia. I mean tanks... so, who\u2019s to say that can\u2019t happen here? I would like\nto think it wouldn\u2019t happen here because of all the different pressures that keep the country\ngoing. For one thing, we\u2019re so materialistic, people want to keep making money and they want\nto keep a society and keep the economy going. And wars and internal fighting and disputes on a\nlarge scale, they ruin countries. I think if it\u2019s nothing more than that sort of selfish self-interest\nand political interest, that people know they\u2019re not going to allow anything of that scale to\nhappen without calling out the National Guard or something. At the same time you see on the\ntelevision, you see all those things that you think somebody was just writing a fiction plot a few\nyears ago, they can happen. Whether it\u2019s biological warfare or some goofy, this computer virus\nstuff. We see that everything is possible with technology. But I don\u2019t know that anyone, these\ndays, in this country, I\u2019m not sure that we would have to fear a Holocaust. I do think that\nminorities who live in fairly isolated situations, I think are always somewhat vulnerable. Here in\nFloyd County now, it\u2019s a nice thing to say, we now have a mosque here in Eastern Kentucky,\nwhich is, I think, a real milestone. And we do have more and more African-Americans and\npeople of other cultures, who have, are finding a home and generally acceptance, at least in some\neconomic, to some economic extent. But I don\u2019t know that they are not always somewhat\nvulnerable. To some extent there are people who are here because the area has needed more\nphysicians and for economic reasons and they are excellent citizens. Whether over time, like the\nosteopathy school or if the economy gets worse, people, they will have become enough of this\ncommunity where they would stay and would speak their mind. I thought they were, they were\ntotally silent during the Ten Commandment debate. I had encouraged some of them to speak\nout, because they were the most affected. So, you, you know, it\u2019s the same way with the Jewish\ncommunities during, the Jewish families that moved South in the earlier days. They stood by,\nthey were in their communities, they were merchants in these towns and they could not join\ncountry clubs and they were being discriminated against. They had African-American maids at\nhome. And they were certainly willing to live in a segregated society, because it was\neconomically favorable to them. I think I may have said that earlier. I think those things are,\nthose are difficult ethical, philosophical issues. But it has to create a certain level of discomfiture\nfor people who are doing that.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we go back and we were talking a little earlier about how we might get some more\ndetail about your work on the Neshoba County case. So, go back to there and then work forward\nagain. Last time we talked about it, you mentioned a little bit about how you had been working\n101\non that case, but what were the details of what you were doing exactly on that case? The murder\nof the three civil rights workers.",
        "A: Well, I worked on the case twice. The first time was in the grand jury when I was talking to you\nearlier this morning about the fact that after the FBI has investigated a case, then we get the\nwitnesses together. And after the incident had happened in the summer of \u201964, we had a grand\njury in Mississippi, a federal grand jury. But that was before there were any confessions. And\nSO we went to Neshoba County and the FBI had uncovered a number of other police-brutality\ncases that, where local officials, the sheriff and local police had acted illegally when beating\nblacks, primarily. And we only knew the circumstantial evidence of the killings of these\nworkers. We did not have a confession and so there was not any clear evidence. We did not\nhave an indictment of that. Then there was subsequently a confession. When Jean and I came\nback from... yeah, then the indictments went to the Supreme Court, when there was an issue\nabout, after the confession, when there was an indictment, there was a legal issue about whether\nthese indictments stated a claim under federal law, because they also involved private\nconspirators along with some police officers. That question went all the way to the United States\nSupreme Court. It was decided in 1966, I think, and Jean and I got married in 1967. When we\ncame back from our honeymoon, we, John Doar called me... at the time was I still working in\nthe Southeastern section? He asked me to come down and work on the Mississippi case if I felt\nlike my honeymoon was over. And we were in New York at that point. We\u2019d been down to\nSaint Martin in the Caribbean. And I said to Jean that I just thought probably with this I was\nready to go back to work to try and finish this case.",
        "Q: How long had it been since you had gotten married?",
        "A: We were, we were still on our honeymoon. We got married in February, 1967 and this was\nFebruary, 1967.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We flew back, back. We were out of the country probably ten days and we were going to spend\nanother five, four or five days in New York seeing some plays or something. But when you were\nwere back in this country and this case was ready to go or we were ready to get in and get ready\nfor trial. So I kissed her good-bye and I went to Mississippi. And I spent, specifically actually, I\nprimarily did two things. I spent almost a month interviewing people who were prospective\njurors in the case. Because nowadays they have psychologist, psychological, they have these\njury experts that are sitting, that sit with the lawyers and who\u2019ve done big sophisticated\nbackground checks and they\u2019ve even sometimes tried cases to juries to try them out. They\u2019ll\nhave a mock trial and have a mock verdict. But by learning through the black community, who\nthe members of the white community were that might be trustworthy and who were supportive\nand who thought this was a dreadful thing, this killing of the three workers and who were\nupstanding citizens and who would know people, basically, I created a notebook of information\nabout the jurors. I mean we didn\u2019t know who the twelve would be. You get a list of about forty\nor fifty. And so I collected information on these people by word of mouth primarily. And met a\nlot of people, and then put this notebook together for John Doar, who was my boss and for the\nU.S. attorney for trial, which they used in selecting the jury.\n102",
        "Q: How were the forty people selected in the first place?",
        "A: They\u2019re chosen out of the jury wheel, at that time in most states, they were chosen off the voter\nlist, the voting lists. You put all the voters... it\u2019s a federal court, so the district is much larger\nthan just a county. So you\u2019re more apt to get people that cover a much larger area. And I think\nthe trial was in Biloxi, in the Southern district of Mississippi with Judge Cox. And so these\njurors were somewhat spread out. I mean it wasn\u2019t all the way across the state, but it was in\nSouthern Mississippi in several counties.",
        "Q: And was there some kind of quota with the jurors, where there were supposed to be a certain\namount white and a certain amount black?",
        "A: No, but there were blacks on the jury, but the blacks were, they were struck. Now I was in some\nearlier trials in the early, when I first came, we had a trial in Georgia involving SNCC workers,\nwho were some voter registration workers, including several of whom were black. And then\nlater with the trial of Fannie Lou Hamer and they were all white jurors. It was really at a time\nbefore, again it was something at the time that was not challenged as being unlawful, the system\nfor selecting jurors and that resulted in no blacks being on the jury. Now this particular jury,\nnow in the Southern District, you would think, probably, that half the people on the jury would\nhave to be or close to half would have to be black, because the voting requirements have been so\nslackened. Because that was another part of this whole civil rights struggle, was they were using\nliteracy tests at the time. I\u2019m pretty sure... and that would make sense, because the number of\nblack voters back then was still very, very small, and so you had very few blacks. And they were\nnot, probably every qualified, voting black was probably in the jury pool. So, I don\u2019t know if\nthey were out of the, let\u2019s say the twelve, that were called initially or fifteen, as they were being\nstruck, there may have been several who were black, but they were struck, so that the jury was an\nall white jury. But I was, of course, felt pretty good, because we got a conviction. So I felt like\nthat work was at last helpful. The other thing that I was, we had always, the way we did our\ntrials in the Civil Rights Division... I may have talked about this before. We\u2019d have two people\ninside the courtroom putting on the case and then the fellows outside the courtroom who were\nresponsible for preparing witnesses and making sure, and having things go right. In the Neshoba\nCounty case, my other responsibility, well there were several others, but my one major\nresponsibility was to firm up the identification of the workers. And that was... of these three\ncivil rights workers who were killed. And that was done through their dental records. We went\nback and found who their dentists were and the dentists\u2019 charts and compared them, in the event\nthat that was in dispute. I don\u2019t think we put the dentists on, and it may be that it was admitted,\nbut we did that. And then there was clothing that had been retrieved from the workers, and the\nwhole issue of proving that they were who we claimed they were, that they had been the\nmurdered workers. And then I did a lot of other, I did some... there were other parts of the case,\nwhere you\u2019re trying to make sure that everything is together. And some of the witnesses were\nnot heard. There were people who, a deputy sheriff at one point picked up a young woman who\nwas an Indian\u2014there was a Choctaw reservation in that area\u2014who was an Indian, and she\noverheard a conversation. But she didn\u2019t speak English. So when we wanted to go talk with her,\nwe had to find an interpreter to try to tell us what she was saying. I think actually she did testify,\n103\nbecause she overheard them saying something that indicated they knew what was about to\nhappen or that they were going to stop the workers when they let them out of jail that night.",
        "Q: So, she understood English, but couldn\u2019t speak it?",
        "A: Right, she just spoke a very broken English and she remembered some phrases that they had said\nwhen she was picked up. They gave her a ride. I don\u2019t remember how we tracked her down, but\nit was something that was helpful like that. The grand jury, I worked on the grand jury a while,\none of my roles was nothing more than a logistician. I was in Biloxi, getting people driving from\nNeshoba County, but the grand jury was sitting in Oxford. And we were moving, I was doing a\nlittle more than that, besides interviewing. I kept taking people to the airport and sending them\nfrom Biloxi to Oxford. Keeping the witnesses going. That took, we had a lot of logistical issues\nin getting, finding these people way out in the country and brining them down\u2014especially\nAfrican-Americans\u2014who had been mistreated, and getting them to the airport and getting them\nup there and back. But then the fact that there was a conviction in this case, John did a, really\nquite a remarkable, did a very, very good job in presenting the case. It was a big effort. It was a\nvery sad thing to kind of work on that.",
        "Q: Did you... you strike me as a person with a lot of energy and a lot of drive to go on, but did you\never just feel depressed and have trouble getting out of the bed in the morning? Or is that just\nnot an issue for you? (Laughing. )",
        "A: Back then or now or?",
        "Q: Well, in any of these. I mean, I would, just picturing studying the dental records of these people\nwho had been brutally murdered for working on a good cause. And then you\u2019ve done other work\nsince then that\u2019s had to have been very depressing. I just wonder how...",
        "A: Oh I think you feel, it always has an impact on you. I think that just for this purpose, you never\nforget the smell of those clothes...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side B\n104\nTape 9, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape nine, side A. Will you, will you just repeat what you had started to say?",
        "A: Well, I was just saying in that particular situation I always can picture, we had the clothing put\naway in boxes behind the door. But it was really... the stench of those clothing was so strong,\nthat it was always there. And for some reason that always stuck with me more than the dental\nrecords. Well, you do, you feel very badly for the families, you feel kind of not very forgiving, I\nthink, for the people who did this. And of course, there were some church burnings before that.\nThe atmosphere around, in Mississippi and Neshoba County among the, in the white community\nand among the Klan, that particular group of Klansmen, Sam Bowers\u00ae, the mastermind of this\none, who also was behind the firebombing of another African-American, who was a voting rights\nleader in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Vernon Dahmer, who, they firebombed his house. These\npeople were just pretty evil. They were violent, and just bad people in that sense. So I think you\nhave a, if anything you\u2019re probably driven. I don\u2019t know that I ever felt depressed, I think most\nof us, and at the time this was a pretty highly motivated group of lawyers, who worked in the\nCivil Rights Division. It was a very relatively small group of lawyers in the early \u201860s. It was\nsort of a sidelight, but I mean Congress\u2019s commitment to civil rights was not great either. The\nDivision had very few lawyers working on civil rights cases when I started in 1962. And they\nhad to beg for any money, and so there were very few of us and we worked on these voting\nrights cases, it took an enormous amount of time and it was hard to do more than two or three of\nthem. We\u2019d spend months looking at records and microfilm. And we worked extraordinary long\nhours. He couldn\u2019t understand why people who were family men with children would want to\ngo home at the end of the day and not come back and work at night or work on Saturdays or\nwork on Sundays. Of course, there were some folks who got divorces over that hard work, just\nas they do in the Service, I think. So I don\u2019t know, I think that lawyers get depressed when they\nlose cases. And we lost, we lost many cases in the early stages in the lower courts, voting rights\ncases and others, because the judges themselves were segregationists and were appointed and\ncame out of that society. So we had to appeal their decisions before and they were reversed and\nall of that took time. So, when you work hard, it doesn\u2019t matter what, if you work hard... then\nwhen we knew we were going to lose, it\u2019s... and then you did lose, you\u2019re sort of prepared for it.\nAnd you really are trying to put the case together in the first level, so that it\u2019s a compelling case\nto the next level. And that\u2019s what happened, we overprepared and we generally won, eventually\nwe would win. And then gradually the law started to change. It took a very long time, and so\nI\u2019ve said many times it was fortunate or maybe because of that slow pace and the limited role of\nthe federal government, that somebody like Martin Luther King had to come along. Or that\nblacks had to organize themselves and realize, as so often happens, that people have to organize\nand that movements get started and that direct action has a place. And it all sort of came together\nin this instance around the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That\u2019s when Jean and I met. We were in\nSelma, we were in this case, this voting rights case, this Dallas County case was a case, the first\nvoting rights case under the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that election. I think we may have talked\nabout that before.\n63 Sam Bowers, circa 1925--. As a leader of the Mississippi KKK, authorized the murder of Mickey Schwerner, one\nof the three civil rights workers murdered in Neshoba County, MS, in 1964. Bowers spent six years in jail for his\nrole in the murders. In 1998, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of the black activist Vernon Dahmer.\n105",
        "Q: We did. Is there anything else you want to say about the Neshoba County case?",
        "A: I don\u2019t, not really, I think. There was a very good, made for T.V. movie about that case. I\u2019m\noften asked about \u201cMississippi Burning,\u201d which is a popular movie that came out, which was not\nreally accurate in many ways. But I thought it depicted the hatred of the atmosphere at the time\nfairly well, and some parts of it were there. Jean and I have a, at our house, the painting of the\nsailboat in our living room is from the restaurant called, it was from Meridian, called Wideman\u2019s\nRestaurant, which was where we worked out of the Meridian office, which is close to Neshoba\nCounty. But I don\u2019t think so. I mean, one of the other last things beside the Kent State thing that\nI did at the Civil Rights Division was to, you know after these folks were convicted, then they\nappealed their conviction and it went on. That took a few years. And I think one of the other\nlast things that I did was to file a brief opposing their last motion not to be sent off to prison. I\nwrote the response to that and then they were picked up. Then they finally went to jail. So that\nwas about 1970.",
        "Q: Do people ask you to speak about your civil rights era experiences very often?",
        "A: Not, it only comes, it comes up, well, my friend Ned Pillersdorf, who is a practicing lawyer here,\nteaches a class on the court system, on I think, civil liberties and the law. And he generally has\nspeakers come in, other judges and I usually come in for a night with him. And I\u2019ve spoken a\nfew other times, but really not very much. And I\u2019m not sure that that many people are aware of\nwhat I did. I mean I don\u2019t particularly publicize it. If I\u2019m giving a speech and somebody\u2019s\nwriting some background about my legal history, theyll generally mention that. But I don\u2019t\nreally do much speaking about it. Usually the schools have a unit on it. There\u2019s a lot of,\ncertainly a lot of written materials and most of those... Taylor Branch\u2019s books quote my boss,\nthere\u2019s a lot in Taylor\u2019s books about John Doar\u2122. And usually when books are written like that,\nthat\u2019s who they are going to write about. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m anybody necessarily. But locally\nif people ask, I will talk about the cases. I mean I\u2019ve spoken a few times, not recently about the\nlegal developments of these, of how we put these cases together and the Voting Rights Act and\nthe impact of the Voting Rights Act. But then I left in 1970 and I\u2019ve been doing this legal\nservices work for thirty years. And unless those things come together somewhere, it\u2019s become\npart of my, sort of distant past, except for reunions of Civil Rights Division lawyers and some of\nthe ongoing contacts I\u2019ve had with people. So not really very much.",
        "Q: I wondered if you want to say anything else about the desegregation work you were doing in\nHouston? You mentioned it in the last interview. One of the things that you mentioned in the\nlast interview that I thought you might want to comment on now, 1s that you said it was the\nbeginning of the Nixon administration and you were seeing that that there was kind of a move\naway from real advancement with civil rights. And that Houston, working in Houston, there was\nnot a, you didn\u2019t give much detail, but 1t seemed you weren\u2019t very hopeful for things moving in a\nreal positive direction there. Do you want to talk about that?\n\u00b0\u00a2 Taylor Branch, author of the trilogy America in the King Years.\n106",
        "A: Well, I think probably what I had reference to was after Richard Nixon was elected and William\nMitchell became Attorney General\u00ae\u00b0, they did not want to continue to seek bussing of students as\na remedy to undo segregation. And bussing, Charlotte had accepted a bussing remedy and\nseveral other states, too. The problem is when you have a segregated community, so that white\nstudents, black students are, if you don\u2019t use something like bussing, you can\u2019t achieve very\nmuch integration, unless you pair up schools where the two housing districts happen to be close.\nWhere they call that pairing of schools. You could pair schools that are in nearby\nneighborhoods. But the Nixon administration, so the Nixon administration really backed, not\nonly on bussing, but they generally felt, I think, that the position of the Department in the past\nhad been too strong towards moving towards integrating classrooms. And they were more\ninclined towards free choice, which would essentially leave student... the schools white and\nblack, with some very few exceptions. And the Houston case was filed right after the Nixons\ncame in and we did ask for bussing as a remedy. And it was the last case that they allowed that\nto go through. In fact, the Assistant Attorney General, who was probably called on the carpet\nabout it a little bit, because it had gone to him and he had approved it. And I don\u2019t know that he\nwas brand new, whether he really focused on it as much as he might have. But the Attorney\nGeneral had to, I think had to sign it as well. We went forward in that case. It was a very large\ncase. Houston was the third-largest school district in the country. I can\u2019t remember, a couple of\nhundred schools. They had, what they had done is spent millions and millions of dollars building\nnew suburban schools outside, on the outer fringes of Houston. At the same time they let the\ninner-city schools decay, so it was really doubly bad. It wasn\u2019t just, in some school districts they\ntried to upgrade black schools to prevent desegregation. In Houston they didn\u2019t care. They spent\nall their money on white schools and let the black schools get worse. So, but then at the same\ntime they bussed white kids past black schools and blacks past white schools. So we asked for, I\nhad an expert from Miami, Florida, who was an expert in school desegregation matters. What a\nminute, maybe he was from Austin, Texas. Mike Stolee. I guess he was from Austin. Well, one\nor the other. And he testified as to the need to bus and that using bussing as a remedy would\nproduce a, basically an integrated school system, with all the advantages that might come, or that\ncould come with that. There was much more to it in the case than that, but basically that was it.\nThe other phenomenon at the time was that the Chicano community was just developing, so that\nit was like we had three donuts. You had a core of inner-city black schools, then you had a\nsmall, growing donut around it of Chicano communities and then you had all the whites on the\noutside. But racially, Chicanos were treated as whites at that time, and probably still are.\nThere\u2019s a designation for themselves, but we were trying to desegregate a school district that had\ntraditionally been black and white. And so one of the things that the judge in the case did, was\npair up some white schools with Chicano schools, which I wasn\u2019t particularly happy about. I\nmean I don\u2019t know that we had achieved very much, as we had hoped to do. There were some\nother things. We didn\u2019t get a lot of bussing, but we got, the Board was required to spend massive\namounts of money to get, to upgrade schools. And the other, probably the best thing that\nhappened was they threw out the School Board. They voted in a new School Board that was\nmuch more moderate. And they got rid of the lawyer who had gotten rich representing the Board\nand keeping the system segregated. This case that I was working on had been filed many years\nbefore that and the NAACP had sort of reactivated it and urged the government to enter the case,\nwhich we did. And so when we moved down there with four or five lawyers, and Jean came\n\u00b0\u00b0 This is a misstatement\u2014John Newton Mitchell (1913-1988) was Attorney General under Richard Nixon, 1969-\n1972. William Dewitt Mitchell was Attorney General from 1929-1933 under Herbert Hoover.\n107\nwith me, we had not been married too long and we rented an apartment, we lived there four or\nfive months getting ready for this trial. And when it was over, we took a big trip and nine\nmonths later our son Michael was born. Actually we went to Canada, up to Calgary and... you\never been up there? Lake Louise, Banff. Wonderful country. Houston, I still sort of scratch my\nhead a little bit. I haven\u2019t kept up with what... there was an appeal of that order. And I wrote\npart of the brief on appeal. Still have it with me. But I always felt a little badly about the limited\nresult of the pairing of the schools, but I think it helped a great deal in the long run in different\nways, to move that system from what it had been, where they had just let the black schools\ndeteriorate into such terrible condition. Then let\u2019s see, Michael was born in 1970, I still had a\nhearing, a pre-trial, I think, not a pre-trial, but a conference right after he was born. We delayed\nit because I expected him to be born in April. So, that was April 1970. I think that\u2019s about it. I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019re thinking about something else in the case.",
        "Q: No, I just...",
        "A: Just a large, urban school case. Took a long time. Lot of records, lots of lawyers working with\nus. And I was able to get Jean to come with me on that, to work on the case.",
        "Q: You talked about how you had come to Kentucky and the whole process of establishing\nyourselves in Prestonsburg and some of the challenges involved in that. And I thought maybe\nyou might want to say a little bit more about... one of the things that has struck me, just in\nreading a little bit about Appalred and the early years and your talking about it last time that we\ntalked here, is that when you talked about the difficulty of getting established, you said that it\nwas difficult. But from what other people have said, they suggested that 1t was a lot more\ndifficult than you let on the last time that we talked. I wondered if there\u2019s... I mean you had\nmentioned that you had trouble renting a place and so forth. But what else was happening\nbesides that, during that time? Did any of the difficulty make you feel like, \u201cOkay, if things\ndon\u2019t turn around soon, we\u2019re out of here?\u201d",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t, no, I don\u2019t think I had thought about being out of here. There were a couple of\nthings probably, one was one of the earliest cases that we were involved with, involved the local\nhealth care establishment, for example. There was a federal program in here, that wanted to set\nup what is now a federally funded health care clinic, that Eulah Hall was associated with. But\nthe governing agency was a Community Action agency, which had some public officials and\nlocal doctors, who were either on the Board or very close to the governing Board and they\nbasically didn\u2019t want this thing to do anything. They were going to use it primarily as a taxi\nservice to... they had a trailer, which was fully equipped sitting out, for example, at Mud Creek,\nbut all they used it for was people would go to the trailer and then they\u2019d drive them into\nPrestonsburg to get their medical services from Prestonsburg physicians, that would get money.\nSo, they were reimbursing them for services, but they wouldn\u2019t allow anybody to be treated out\nthere. Not even a nurse to give them shots. And then they employed a doctor. The local\nmedical establishment threw a lot of roadblocks into his getting a license. And it was just a lot of\ntrouble getting it. So the welfare rights groups came to me and we filed some administrative\ncomplaints and basically threatened to close the thing down. I mean their decision was if it\nwasn\u2019t going to work and be responsive, let\u2019s just not have it. Let\u2019s not waste the money. Well,\ntwo things happened, one was, of course, that Jean wasn\u2019t sure who her doctor would be, since\n108\nthey were all mad at us. And so she wondered if she could get any child care, any medical care\nfor her son, who was less than a year old, or just about a year old. And then the establishment,\nthe doctors or the agency complained to Congressman Perkins\u00ae about it and he asked for an\naudit by the General Accounting Office of what we were doing, not just in this case. There was\nat the same time a lot of hostility by local lawyers to having our get started. They thought\nbasically we were going to take money out of their pockets. So the GAO sent an inspector here,\nwhich wasn\u2019t too... but he was in our office for about a month. He looked at all, every piece of\npaper and then he issued... they ended up issuing a report which was really very favorable and\ncomplimentary. And when I called Congressman Perkins to ask him about this thing, about his\nrequest, he said not to worry about it. He was doing it to placate the local officials. He was sure\nit was going to work out okay. So there were things like that. And I had the local Bar was quite\nhostile. I went to them on one occasion and asked them, told them I wanted to set up a system to\nrefer clients to lawyers who, if the clients weren\u2019t eligible for our services, if they made too\nmuch money, that we wanted a fair system. So, would they want to give me a list of the lawyers\nin some order, the ones that would take certain cases and not take... So he appointed a\ncommittee to look into it. The President said he thought that was a good suggestion. Well, the\ncommittee met and their resolution was to suggest that we leave town, that we not practice law\nhere without their permission. It was sort of an indication of the atmosphere. I mean there were\na few, well I don\u2019t know that we had any lawyers who were outside. There were a couple of\nlawyers who had been here earlier, who had had a run in with me, but they were philosophically\nsupportive of free legal services. Because I wasn\u2019t the... when I first came, there were some\nlawyers who had been working here with welfare rights folks. They started something called\nMountain People\u2019s Rights. They saw their role more as being organizers than as being lawyers.\nThey had not gotten their licenses, so we had a serious difference of opinion about how this\nneeded to be done. Cold air out here. Oh, that\u2019s the air conditioning, that\u2019s what that is. Is it too\ncold?",
        "Q: It\u2019s all right with me. You cold?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s just blowing down, I didn\u2019t know where it came from. So, there were those things. And\nI mean the medical... and the fact that I had hired, the first two lawyers I hired, J.T. Begley,\nJoe\u2019s son, who had just come out of the Marines and gone to law school and Mort Stamm, both\nof them were living in Lexington and were staying down during the week and then they would\ngo back on a weekend to their families. So, it was not a, it took a while to, I really didn\u2019t have\nany friends or that much of a support system, especially since I was also sort of fighting with the\nother lawyers who had been here. And Jean was a new mother and was just trying to get to\nknow a few people who might share values, because the lawyers, the wives of the private\npractitioners, were really garden club types or people who were pretty much interested 1n money\nand materialism. But she then, she started, gradually started teaching childbirth classes. That\nwas a big, sort of avocation of hers and got her to have an interest outside of being at home. So I\nthink the first, those early, that early year was probably... wasn\u2019t much lonesomeness, I think it\nwas beautiful. I mean we knew, at the time we were not so sure that we would be here that long.\nI think 1t was much more, as you said, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to run me out of town. We\u2019re going to\nset this up. We\u2019re going to get started. There\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done.\u201d Legally\nthere were many more black and white, if you will, issues. The law was, I mean the law did not\n6\u00b0 Carl Dewey Perkins, 1912-1984, represented the 7\u201c Congressional district in Kentucky from 1949 until his death.\n109\nfavor welfare claimants. A lot of things which we take for granted today, like the right to a\nhearing and the right to your medical records, if you\u2019re involved in one of these, those things had\nnot been established and they seem very basic. So there were a number of these, almost every\ntime you looked at something involving a poor person against an official in one of these\nagencies, including the environmental stuff. There was so much to do and so much that needed\nto be done, that very few others were doing, that the work was very, very interesting from the\nvery beginning. It was very challenging. We were just sort of outsiders, who were not\nparticularly welcome in the community.",
        "Q: What about among the clientele? What kind of relationship did you have with most of the\nclients? Was it just strictly professional? And did you feel a good rapport?",
        "A: Oh I think people who come to you as a lawyer for free service, especially who are just, who\nrealize that lawyers are there, who want to help them and are interested in them and are treating\nthem like people. And then when they see that in court they are meeting the other side with the\nsame, if not even better, with more competent lawyers, they\u2019re pretty proud of that. And I think\nthe clients have been... always from the first day, even when I was in the Civil Rights Division\nwhen I represented the United States, I always admired them a great deal. Most of them had\ndifficult lives, have serious problems. They\u2019re very genuinely nice people. They don\u2019t always\nhave the advantages that the rest of us have. Sometimes in the domestic relations cases, there\nreally aren\u2019t any winners and the children are losers. And I don\u2019t know... we have a lot of\ndebates in legal services about the value of spending so much time on domestic cases. And back\nthen probably the divorce rate was probably twenty-five percent, today it\u2019s over fifty. So, the\ndemand for what we do in that area, because people fight over kids. And the legal system hasn\u2019t\nadjusted. You have to have a lawyer in these things and there just aren\u2019t enough lawyers to go\naround. In this area there aren\u2019t enough people who can afford lawyers, so you either have\npeople who go without representation, if they don\u2019t... or they have to look to us. But on some of\nthe larger issues, the consumer cases or even the evictions or the others, that generally oftentimes\nyou have an opportunity, to help someone make a real difference in their lives. As you can see\nin the case listings that we put together, I think that those are all very significant, very important.\nI think that\u2019s so, but it was not an easy start. And now in retrospect, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s not\nsuch a huge amount of time. And I think, I\u2019ve always said I don\u2019t twist anybody\u2019s arm to come\nto this program. You have to want to be happy in a small community and that has pluses and\nminuses. You can\u2019t get lost in anonymity, which I think small towns have a lot going for them.\nBut at the same time you can feel very isolated if you\u2019re going uphill, and we often are. I mean\nyou\u2019re stepping on toes a lot.",
        "Q: Does that happen still?",
        "A: Well, we still step on toes. I think now there are, we don\u2019t, I don\u2019t like to step on toes if we\ndon\u2019t have to do that. And we try to avoid it and we\u2019ll try to negotiate cases before we file them.\nI think the program now, thirty years later, has a lot of support and so, public support, so people\nsort of expect to see that periodically. When they see a case that\u2019s in the paper, where we\u2019re\ntaking on as somebody would say another cause or fighting, filing a case for someone who\u2019s an\nunderdog or who\u2019s against the county or a hospital or against a coal company, they sort of take it\nfor granted. I mean they understand that back then it was very unusual and the clients probably\n110\nwere, I\u2019m sure, supported back then. I just think that people feel a little more empowered today.\nThe economy has been bad, and I think the coal industry over time has done, it has not been very\ngood, without being forced into making changes that are, to require, which require safe mines\nand low dust levels and environmental measures that make, that will restore the property after\nmining. All of those things have come...\nEnd of Tape 9, Side A\n111\nTape 9, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape nine, side B.",
        "A: It seems that companies just won\u2019t regulate themselves. They will not. We\u2019ve seen that over\nand over again, whether it\u2019s the chemical industry or the mining industry. Because where people\nare looking for profit, primarily, they don\u2019t want to shut something, a mine down, long enough to\nfix what\u2019s broken or to take real measures to keep dust levels down until somebody has made\nthem do it. Because every time you do that, you have to slow production down a little bit and\nyou won\u2019t produce as much. So, as a result you have a high incidence of black lung disease and\nyou have an unfriendly worker environment. Finally things have started changing in the last few\nyears. So now I think it\u2019s much more accepted, if that\u2019s the right word, I think people even can\nunderstand or they see it happening and they see that that\u2019s probably one of the roles that we\nplay. And that we have done over the years, but I think at the same time they can see that what\nwe do is responsible. That we have good lawyers. That we don\u2019t make up law suits and that\ngenerally there\u2019s a good reason for what we do. When we can do something in the community,\nlike the housing project, where we\u2019re working with public officials, who are now, who want to\ndo something for people who let\u2019s say live in substandard housing, out of their own sense of duty\nor their own feeling that everybody\u2019s entitled to have a decent place to live in. If you\u2019ve got that\nsort of in county government, then those are people we can work with and not have to sue. I\nmean, I\u2019d like nothing better than to have us, to be able to put ourselves out of business.\n(Laughing.) But, I don\u2019t know, I think that\u2019s a long way off.",
        "Q: You talked last time about your, about a few of the cases... Do you need a coffee break?\n(Laughing.) Do you, okay, so last time you talked about the Broad Form Deed and how that case\nwas dealt with and the victory that resulted from that. And you talked about the development of\nthe community in David and I\u2019m wondering... and you also talked about the establishment of the\nKentuckians for the Commonwealth, which was called Fair Tax Coalition first, and the work that\nthat organization started on doing. So I think those were the main things that you talked about\nduring this era that you have been in Prestonsburg. I\u2019m wondering if you want to highlight\nanything else from those years? Go into detail about anything else?",
        "A: Well, I think we\u2019ve... there are some other sort of unique things that we\u2019ve done. I think I\u2019m\nvery proud of the work that we\u2019ve done on behalf of coal miners, who have refused to work in\nunsafe conditions. We established a mine safety project, where we represent those miners in\nseeking a reinstatement and damages for having been fired unjustly\u2014excuse me\u2014or\ndiscriminated against unjustly. I think that\u2019s been real successful. And the lawyer who did that\nfor a number of years, Tony Oppegard, who is now the Assistant to the Director of the Mine\nHealth and Safety Administration, who was an Appalred lawyer in West Virginia years ago. I\nthink that\u2019s been very significant. We\u2019ve represented a lot of disabled coal miners in\napplications for black lung benefits, this federal program, where so many people, right now,\nninety-five percent of the people are denied, because the governmental regulations are so severe\nand it\u2019s so difficult to obtain the claims. But we still manage... and the private bar hardly does\nthose cases at all. So we\u2019ve worked with the Black Lung Association, Bill Worthington, for\nexample, officers of the Black Lung Association, in trying to get Congress to be, relax those\nrequirements and to have better regulations that are fairer, that we see a more reasonable number\n112\nof people be approved for black lung benefits. We have won many of those claims, the ones that\nwe\u2019 ve screened and where private attorneys finally gave up. Because it takes so long for private\nattorneys to get their fees and because they\u2019re so complex and take so long, we\u2019re going to get\nanother lawyer to come in pretty soon, nearer in the next few months to do that. And the mine\nsafety and black lung work sort of go hand in hand. The same thing is true of coal miner, of\npension benefits. We had a case we went to the United States Supreme Court on involving\npension benefits where we lost. But it really helped them, I think, in some ways to re-write their\nrequirements. But Gracie, it\u2019s the Gracie Robinson case, a woman up here, a widow up in\nAuxier, whose husband had worked over thirty years in the coal mines, but had not stopped\nworking and applied. And he died in the coal mines in an accident. And the requirements for\nobtaining a widow\u2019s pension was that the miner should have applied for a pension and stopped\nworking. And since he was killed in a mine accident they said he hadn\u2019t applied for his pension,\nthey wouldn\u2019t give her her pension. We said that was arbitrary. If he\u2019s worked thirty years and\nyou only have to have twenty-five to get a pension. And he wanted to keep working, that it was\nlike punishment at that point. We won and then we lost in the District court and then we won in\nthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and then we lost in the United States Supreme\nCourt. But they did actually re-write that provision in the bargaining contract. But I think the\nwork we do for low, for disabled miners has been really important. I think the... in the last few\nyears we\u2019ve started a migrant farm worker program up in Richmond, where we got some money\nfrom the legal services Corporation to help migrant workers throughout the state. We have a\nvery small grant. It\u2019s only about 35,000 dollars, so we\u2019ve done that co-operatively with a\nprogram in Texas that represents these folks full time. And we\u2019ve managed to file some of the\nfirst cases with respect to working conditions. I mean there are cases where the workers come up\nhere and the grower breaches the contract or at least our workers claim the growers have\nbreached their contract by not providing the working time that they claimed they would or the\nworking conditions under which they would work. And the program, the Western Kentucky\nprogram had the grant a few of years ago and they just could not really find the workers and we\nwere, by getting together with the people in Texas, the paralegal from Texas came up and who\nhelped... who helped to do this project, did the outreach work. And oh [YAWNS|] and for\nexample he would meet the bus, the Greyhound bus coming in at one o\u2019clock in the morning at\nthe station and give out his card to the workers and then they would know how to contact him.\nThat kind of thing. And you have to be bilingual, obviously, but I think that\u2019s been a very, even\nthough we have very few migrant workers out here in Eastern Kentucky, there are a number of\nother areas in the state, especially where they have large tobacco farms in Western Kentucky,\nthat\u2019s where we\u2019ve had so many of our cases. I think most recently the development of our\nhousing coalition here, called LINKS*\u2019, where we\u2019re doing this huge home repair project. With\nall the groups that are coming in from out of state. And just bringing all these agencies together\nunder one roof, so they can collaborate and work together, I think has been a real positive\ndevelopment. Showing people how they can, I mean we\u2019ve pulled together a lot of different\nagencies and non-profits, who are all addressing housing issues, into one collaborative. And I\nthink everybody\u2019s been real pleased with that. I think we\u2019ve been able to do that because we\ndon\u2019t have any axes to grind or turf. We just said, \u201cWe want to do this and we\u2019re willing to do it\nif you all will cooperate and we can seek funding together, and do some cooperative work.\u201d And\nso now I actually am sharing a grant with the fiscal court, which would have, and for a worker\nhere, who is a young woman who came from Jean\u2019s program. A participant, who 1s very, very\n\u00b0\u201d Low Income Housing Coalition of Eastern Kentucky.\n113\nbright and who has moved up very fast. Who is a single parent. Could go to law school if she\nwere willing. And that makes me feel good. And we\u2019ve had a number of people like that, who\nare single parents, who have been on welfare, who have worked with us in a training situation\nover a few months\u2019 time and have really, really sort of progressed so quickly and come out of\ntheir shell and have moved on to good jobs. I think we have a pretty extraordinary group in most\nof the offices. It\u2019s a good program to me, I mean if I go through the senior staff in this\norganization, I\u2019m just really proud of who they are and what they do. Many of them have been\nwith me a long time and each of them has different skills, but they\u2019re all committed to what we,\nthis representation of low-income persons, who otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to have lawyers.\nWhether it\u2019s for a mundane situation or something that is pretty exciting, that will really effect a\nlot of other people in the future. I think we\u2019ve, I think we do very, very good legal work and I\nthink we have real committed people who are doing it.",
        "Q: Do you want to say anything, you\u2019ve been mentioning that it\u2019s been kind of a turbulent time for\nlegal services in general. Do you want to say something about your perspective on the state of\nlegal services and what direction it might be taking?",
        "A: Well it\u2019s all conjecture. I think those of us who have been doing this a long time are sort of,\nhave been disappointed the last few years, because we really have not been able to get\nappreciable new funding at the federal level. And this program was established at the federal\nlevel to provide free legal services to the poor and to be a non-political program. When it was\nthe last, one of the last things that President Nixon signed, was this Bill that created this\ncorporation. And we expanded and got additional money from 1974 to 1980. And we went\nfrom like forty million nationally or fifty, to three hundred and twenty-one. And when Governor\nReagan came in as president he was ready to destroy, to get rid of legal services, because of his\nexperience. They had sued him in California. And I won\u2019t go through all that history, but really\nsince the Reagan and that first year, instead of getting rid of us they made a compromise and we\nlost twenty-five percent of our money, which is a lot. And we\u2019ve never really recouped that\nmoney. We\u2019re now still not at the level we were in 1980. So that most of us have half as many\nlawyers as we did in 1981. We were able to... but there have been many efforts in the meantime\nin Congress to just eliminate the program. And we\u2019ve been able to forestall that, which says a\nlot. Because congressional support now is pretty strong. Unfortunately the subcommittee chair\nfor legal services is from this District. It\u2019s Hal Rogers from Somerset. And whereas he\u2019s able to\nbring back lots of money for other local projects, he has never, either he\u2019s not a fan of legal\nservices, or he is trying to mollify the people above him and the others whom he works with,\nbecause his latest... for the last couple of years, that committee has passed out a recommended\nbudget which is only about half the size of our funding level, 140 out of 300 million dollars.\nAnd that\u2019s been real disappointing, but he likes to say that he is keeping it going and that there\nare budgetary shortages, and that the other people on his committee are not as strong as he is.\nAnd he would be supportive. And besides he knows that our supporters will be able to get the\nfunding level up on the floor of the House, once it gets to the floor. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\nBut I\u2019m disappointed in him. I wish he were a little more aggressive or could do more at his end,\nwhich he probably could if he wanted to. But... excuse me just a moment. In the meantime\nwe ve been fortunate to get some money through the State Legislature and I think that\u2019s been a\nreal positive thing in the last few years, where our own legislators have recognized the\nimportance of legal services. We did not get any more money this year, but we did get a repeat\n114\nof last year and so about half of our funding is now state funding. I think it\u2019s conjecture, as I was\ntelling you there are lots of possibilities. I think our current corporation feels that it\u2019s more\nefficient to have a single entity in the state, covering the state. Because the President of the\ncorporation is a former private attorney from the state of Washington, however, where they have\na very effective, single state program. Time will tell us what will happen there. I don\u2019t know.\nAnd some other... anybody else? I think I sust lost my train of thought.",
        "Q: Well, it sounded like you were basically finished with your train of thought, weren\u2019t you?",
        "A: I was talking about the state funding, right? That we didn\u2019t get any more funding this time or\nthat we were... how far did I get with state funding?",
        "Q: Said that this year, you\u2019re at the same level that you were at last year. You weren\u2019t cut anymore,\nbut...",
        "A: We weren\u2019t cut and we were very pleased that we were able to get additional money last time.\nWe have two sources of state funding, one for the filing fee and one for a general appropriation.\nAnd this time, many programs did not get increases. There were a lot of one-time expenditures,\nlike the Science Center, got a litthke more money. But I think a lot of ongoing projects, except for\nthe new ones like the childcare money that I think actually, some of it\u2019s out of the tobacco\nmoney. So, this is a year again, where we have no more new money, state or federal. And that\nmakes it difficult because if you want to give people salary increases, you either have to lose\npositions or something else to free up additional funds. I don\u2019t know whether... and so there is\nthis tendency in our funding agency to pull programs together. There is the thought that state-\nwide programs are more efficient. I don\u2019t think there is any real proof of that anywhere. I mean\nI don\u2019t know that they have evidence of that. It may be more efficient to administer, because one\nperson can make a decision instead of four. You might be able to be more homogeneous around\nthe state. I would like to think that legal services is here to stay. I think for the most part it is. I\nthink there are people in Congress, who think of, that it could be organized differently. When I\nwas talking about a state-wide organization. Or whether... I know that one of my counterparts in\nVirginia would rather be part, consolidate with us, because our client population is so much the\nsame. The Appalachian counties do have a lot in common. Whereas in Virginia you have only,\nall of the state in West Virginia is in Appalachia. And Virginia, a small part of the state is in\nAppalachia. So, whether they would allocate enough resources to that one or two programs in\nthat corner is something that time will just have to tell.",
        "Q: Do you want to take a break and stretch out?",
        "A: I think I need...",
        "A: Well, the other thing that\u2019s been so difficult with legal services has been the restrictions that\nCongress has placed on us in more recent years, which prevent us from filing Class Actions or\nchallenging Welfare Reforms, accepting attorney fees, not being able to represent prisoners.\nThose things all seem to, one could view them as making us second class lawyers. There is no\nreal, rational explanation for them when the preamble to the legal services Corporation Act states\nthat you should not interfere with the professional responsibility to your client. And that clients\n115\nhave the right to have full representation from legal services lawyers. So there\u2019s, it\u2019s not a very\nfavorable atmosphere to work under. It doesn\u2019t mean we still can\u2019t do ninety-five percent of the\ncases, because many of them still fit into, aren\u2019t affected by those prohibitions. But it is\nsomething that needs to be changed. And it\u2019s purely a political affair. And you have the national\nopponents of legal services, who are always looking for one more anecdote to pull out as being\nthe kind of thing that goes on. I mean, no one\u2019s perfect. So you find somebody\u2019s statistics aren\u2019t\nquite right and all of a sudden everybody in the country has to be on guard for an inspection,\neven though we... the way we are funded is by the number of poor people in our areas, not by\nthe number of cases we do. So there\u2019s always a level of, if not harassment, of paperwork that\ngrows and grows and leaves less time for the real work that needs to be done. But at that same\ntime it\u2019s good that we are able to get this money because you really can\u2019t fund this kind of work\nwith private fundraising. You could do a limited amount of it, but not very much. We, I think\nwe\u2019re fortunate to be able to get good lawyers. We don\u2019t pay equivalent salaries. And we have\npeople coming to work with very large, outstanding loans from undergraduate and law school.\nWe\u2019 ve instituted a small repayment program that is helpful. But we\u2019ve just increased our\nstarting salaries to $27,000, which is a big step forward. It\u2019s still behind many of the private\nfirms and many of the state and federal agencies. And then we only go up about thirteen\nhundred a year for, first for nine months and then for a year. But all the same, I think we\u2019re\ncompetitive and we have some good benefits. And we are able, have been fortunate to get\npeople who are really committed. So I am very proud of the work we do. I am very proud of the\npeople who are here and who do the work. We have wonderful relations, I also should mention\nwith the spouse abuse shelters. That\u2019s another project we\u2019ve started in the last few years, 1s to\nhave specialists who work, who represent abused spouses at domestic violence hearings. And\nwe\u2019 ve gotten very involved in that area and I think the family court judges appreciate us and the\nshelters appreciate us. And it is a huge amount of our practice, more than we would like. But\nit\u2019s one of those societal problems that we have to deal with, so we are very interested in the\nrights of children and the rights of these women. Of course, it\u2019s wonderful to have people like\nmy wife, Jean, out trying to help move them, gain some independence and get back into\neducation and develop their careers in a way that they can be productive and independent on\ntheir own. I\u2019ve been real proud of the people that have come from her program into my office,\nboth for representation and several who, at least one of whom is employed now as a full-time\nperson here. It continues to be pretty exciting work. I never, never lack for anything to do.\nClose to the end?\nEnd of Tape 9, Side B\n116\nTape 10, Side A",
        "Q: Okay, tape number ten, side A, an interview with John Rosenberg. I guess now would be a good\ntime for you to say something about your work with establishing the Science Center.",
        "A: Okay. Well, I was a chemistry major as I think you know, and I think that we\u2019ve always known\nthat the scores of our students here in science and math were very low and that science, math and\ntechnology was not valued very highly. So a number of years ago, maybe nineteen, somewhere\nbetween 1990 and \u201892, I asked teachers, some teachers to come together and some other folks in\nthe community to see whether we might not start a, developing some ideas for improving math\nand science, and what they thought. And what we learned was that teachers were very uneasy\nabout teaching math and science. Many of them had very poor backgrounds during their teacher\ntraining and they were ill-equipped, especially at the elementary level, to try to present scientific\nconcepts. And they really wanted more hands-on activities to support them. So we, we sort of\nmet periodically and then over the next couple of years. And then I saw a small video segment,\nor heard about it, about a college up in Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, Juniata College\u00ae\u00ae,\nwhich had obtained funding for a science van, where a chemistry teacher was driving a van\naround and dropping experiments off at high schools, dropping off equipment that the schools\ncouldn\u2019t afford to buy. And was like a sort of Johnny or Jeanie Appleseed, would tell school A\nabout what school B had done with these things. Over the course of several years the number of\nincoming students at Juniata College who were, who majored in or who showed an interest in\nscience, studying science-related courses, like tripled. So, I thought it would be, then got to\nthinking that we would like to, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we did something like that. I had not, I\ndon\u2019t think had really thought about the planetarium theater kind of thing yet. But we were\nmeeting and we got a small grant back about 1990, maybe \u201894 as a result of this work and this\ngroup that kept meeting. We realized that we could maybe establish a center like that if we\ncould get some funding. So, we got a little money out of the legislature, I think 75,000 dollars to\nhire a consultant. One of the legislators here in this area, Greg Stumbo\u00b0\u2019, was interested in\ntechnology and with KERA\u201d having come in I think there was a strong, an atmosphere that was\nconducive to getting some funding. And I thought we should start off in a small way, so we\nhired a consultant from West Virginia, Mike Howard, who had worked in the Kentucky\neducational system, to do some community meetings and help us look at more specifically where\nwe fit and what kind of activities would be helpful. And it sort of reinforced what we had\nalready known in some ways, that teachers wanted hands-on Mr. Wizard kinds of things. And\nthat if we could bring presentations to them and do something like the science van and\neducational programs, that that would be helpful. And I don\u2019t know where I first came up with\nthe idea of trying to do a planetarium or a science museum or really, I thought it might be nice if\nwe could even replicate a coal mine. But I started, we started talking that up and realized that if\nwe had a modern facility it would be really meaningful. And I also learned that you could, they\nhad these portable planetariums that you could take around to schools, which are little... they\ncall them planetarium in a foot locker, where you blow up, it\u2019s like a vinyl thing and you blow it\n68 Juniata College, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.\n6\u00b0 Stumbo was elected Kentucky Attorney General in 2003.

        "A: Kentucky Education Reform Act. 1990 act mandating statewide restructure of the educational system.\n117\nup in a classroom and you can put thirty kids 1n it that will watch a star show and other\neducational shows. And so, by the time the next legislature rolled around, I think we got\n200,000 dollars. We were able to increase our operating grant and on a fairly short notice we got\na local architect to put together just a schematic of what a theater and planetarium might look\nlike and what it could do, and that we would, and that... I think we may have even still been\nthinking about a coal mine. And we put together a board, I organized a board of directors that\nincluded representatives from Morehead and from the Alice Lloyd\u201d and Pikeville College and\nPCC\u201d and Hazard and the teachings, the science teachers and the regional educational\ncooperatives to give us a good cross-section of membership and also a good geographical cross-\nsection. And it\u2019s been, and that\u2019s basically the story. And they helped me, we went to convince\nthem, during the last legislative session, our local legislator agreed to get behind it and we made\na presentation to the Governor and he liked it and called me at home one day to go over the\nbudget. Wanted to know why I had a budget item for rent. He was very meticulous. \u201cWhy do\nyou need this three hundred dollars when you\u2019re going to have...?\u201d I said, \u201cGovernor, we won\u2019t\nbe in that place for a couple, few years yet. We need a budget place, we need an office.\u201d But\nanyway, we got through that with two and a half million dollars, and then this time... so we\nplanned some more, but because of the reorganization of the college, Kentucky college system,\nKCTCS and UK\u201d, the two years went by without any building. There was a lot of planning, but\nwe just got caught in the upheaval of this educational thing, until KCTCS could get on its feet.\nSo, in the meantime we put together a proposal for another million dollars, probably should have\nbeen for more. And after all the wrangling, we were one of the fortunate ones at the end to get\nthe million dollars, because Greg Stumbo, who 1s from here, is a pretty powerful figure and was\nessentially, he and Benny Ray Bailey, who got beat in this last election, were able to pretty much\nget all the one-time funding projects through that they asked for. So, now we are, we just last\nweek had our meeting with the architects and KCTCS folks and college representatives and we\nare settled on where the site is going to be and we have a basic floor plan. And I hope two years\nfrom now the building will be standing. It probably will be. And then that means another\nlegislature will have passed and hopefully we might even increase the operating costs of our\ngroup. We got a little more money for that. But I\u2019m very excited about what we will be able to\ndo, both for students who are in this region, who can\u2019t really, who never see this sort of thing at\nthis sophisticated level. There is now a planetarium at Eastern in Richmond, which a lot of\npeople don\u2019t even know about. But I think if we do this well, it can stimulate a lot of interest in\nscience and technology. We have now decided to expand our laboratory facility so that we will\nbe able to, from a classroom into a sort of laboratory classroom, so we can do experiments in\nDNA fingerprinting and other chemical experiments, at least demonstrative experiments. And\nwe\u2019re coming up with what I think is pretty exciting. Our Director we\u2019ve hired is from Pike\nCounty, he was born there, although he grew up in Michigan. And we have, as I say, a very\ngood board and so I\u2019m, I think that it will be a very important part of the future of Eastern\nKentucky. I think that we now have a new industry in Pike County, a knowledge-based industry,\nwhere a call center, Microsoft, 1f you call an 800 number for Microsoft and you need help on\nyour computer, they\u2019ll pick up the phone down there and give you answers to technical questions\nfrom their computers, which is a breakthrough in terms, because our coal economy is declining\nso quickly in terms of the number of people they can hire. So this is an area that we have to\n1\u201d Alice Lloyd College, Pippa Passes, Kentucky\n\u201d? PCC: Prestonsburg Community College\n3 KCTCS: Kentucky Community and Technical College System. UK: University of Kentucky.\n118\nmove into, that I think can have an appreciable effect on kids. People want to be scientists and\nthey want to be astronomers and they want to be explorers and they can see that happen. And I\nthink that\u2019s what the role of this building is going to be. And obviously, you know, we\u2019re going\nto need more money and I could spend all my time raising money for this facility for that matter.\nWe\u2019re going to be hiring a development director, but I\u2019m very much invested in this project. So\nthat\u2019s what it\u2019s about.",
        "Q: And are you, what are you picturing your role to be in future years?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve been the chair of the board since its inception. Whether they\u2019re going to kick me out\nany time soon, I\u2019m not... but I may, and I\u2019ve been pretty active in that particular role. I don\u2019t\nknow. I mean I think it\u2019s very exciting. Actually it\u2019s the result of, and in part it goes back to my\nscouting days, because when I... did I talk about scouting before? When I was growing up and\nBud Schiele? Maybe I mentioned at the time that that inspired me to sort of get involved with\nthis here. Because we added such a wonderful museum in my home in Gastonia, now, which\ngrew out of a very small effort that started there. And I mean there is, certainly we will need\npeople to volunteer to do everything from just showing kids through the place to actively being a\npart of the soliciting group or... and I will probably be involved. But I\u2019m still very interested in\npracticing, in the practice of law. And if I were not doing legal services work, I\u2019d probably be\ndown the street with my friend Ned, and at least part-time working with him or working on my\nown, or taking in a few cases, because I enjoy doing them. So, I\u2019m not sure that I would just\nstop and do the Science Center. Or maybe I\u2019d be working with the housing group down here. I\nthink I\u2019d like to get our... I mean when you, it\u2019s kind of getting to what else I\u2019d like to be doing.\nI have a number of other interests, but I know I enjoy working. And I think when my daughter is\nout of graduate school and I feel like we have no more immediate important, sort of potentially\nmajor expenses within the family that I would stop. I mean I could stop I suppose. But I think\nit\u2019s a great development. There may be something else that comes up in the community. I mean\nI\u2019m very involved with the historical group, the Friends of the May House, where we\u2019ve renewed\nthis, restored this old building, which I\u2019ve been a part of for twenty years. And I\u2019m still working\non some of their legal documents to get a conservation easement at the moment. And I\u2019ve been\nproud of what we\u2019ve done in that particular thing. And we need to raise some money, because\nwe want to try to get that building open and keep it open. Everybody that is there is a volunteer\nand nobody has time to do any fund-raising. And that\u2019s just one of those things. And I know\nthat from my experience where I am here, I\u2019ve done a fair amount of fund-raising. I don\u2019t get a\nlot of private money, but I\u2019ve written a number of those grants and I know the system that you,\nhow you do it. And I know I could do that there. So, there\u2019s plenty for me to spend my time on.\nWhere I would do it, and I might still, you know, in the practice of law if you get an interesting\ncase and it\u2019s a big case it can eat you up, timewise. It\u2019s like putting together a play or a book or\nradio program.",
        "Q: You mentioned your mother a little earlier and what\u2019s your, when you meet up with her and see\nher, do you, do you usually talk about your family history at this point? What kinds of, what\nkind of relationship do you have with her?",
        "A: Oh, we\u2019re very close. I think she 1s close to all three of her children, maybe more so than ever\nsince my father passed away. And at various times, last time when mother was here we did a\n119\nlittle more oral history. I always tend to, it\u2019s one of those things you just sort of get yourself\ninto. You may be talking about Passover and trying to remember what the lemon cream recipe\nwas that she used to do. And then you talk about how Passover was in Germany. And then who\ntheir friends were that came to Passover and all of a sudden you\u2019re into some history that you\u2019d\nforgotten about or when she went off to learn to cook as a young girl. And so she\u2019s still, the\nstories are still there. Not all of them are recorded. And she still corresponds with people in\nGermany. Her mind 1s very good and she really enjoys being with us, so it\u2019s fun to travel with\nher. Jean has a really good relationship with her. I think my father was a very dominant, strong\npersonality, a very smart man. And mother grew up in a small country town. And I think being\na traditional, they had a very traditional relationship, where he was sort of the power figure in the\nfamily and she cooked and kept house and was very proud of her motherly role, as many Jewish\nmothers are. But Mom\u2019s really pretty sharp. And I almost want to say I think her mind\u2019s gotten\neven better in the last few years, maybe because of, by having to be a little more independent and\nliving on her own, she has, you know, it\u2019s broadened her horizons somewhat. But...",
        "Q: How old is she now?",
        "A: Huh? She\u2019s eighty-eight. She\u2019ll be eighty-nine in August, ninety next year. But she\u2019s very\nstrong physically and very, still gets on her bicycle. So she\u2019s keeping up. When my sister took\nher on a cruise recently to the Panama Canal, they got off at some island to go sight-seeing and it\nturned out they were going up a mountain somewhere and she still kept up with everybody. And\nI think people, people are always quite amazed at her energy and her, you know, sort of... she\u2019s\nvery lively and very friendly, very outgoing. People can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s eighty-eight years\nold. There are others like that around now, who are eighty-five and ninety, who get around and\nI\u2019m hoping I\u2019m still in that, will be in that category. And I\u2019d like to have that, I suppose I was\nprobably saying I wish I had the time to, since she is so interested in traveling right now, that I\nwould like to have more of an opportunity to do that with her. Or for the three of us to go, but\nJean... when you are working, you do it in pieces. And so my brother and his wife have gone to\nChina and so that\u2019s why I went to see her with Jean last weekend. Now we\u2019re trying to plan\nanother trip or two. So I think I was just saying, I wish she were either down here or... I think\nshe\u2019s living in a good situation. She\u2019s in a high-rise for the elderly up in D.C. But she is very\ndependent on her family, because the people in the house, most of them are her age or older.\nWell, they\u2019re about, many of them are in their eighties and many of them are not in as good a\nphysical condition, so she\u2019s always helping others. So she hasn\u2019t made very many connections\nwith people who are her age and want to keep doing things, other than come down to eat and\nmaybe go shop for groceries. We see that and so while she is in a mood to want to be able to do\nthat, you know, you kind of want to accommodate her if you can. But I think between the three\nof us, we can get to do that. But when you have a calendar that is related to your work, you\u2019re\nlimited in that ability. You want to plan a trip in August and Jean\u2019s got to start back to school or\nsomething. You can\u2019t just pick up and go as easily as if you were not working at all.",
        "Q: Has she or have you had any interest in visiting, I know you\u2019ve been back to Magdeburg, but you\nmentioned it was more of a sightseeing trip. Have you had any strong interest in doing a more\ninvestigative trip? Maybe going to Leer where your father was born?\n120",
        "A: I'd like to go to Leer, actually Jean and her mother went to Leer, years ago, when they drove\nthrough. There\u2019s a, I have a film at home. Do you speak German? By a German, by a\nfilmmaker, whose name I\u2019ve forgotten at the moment, that I just\u2014Mother hasn\u2019t seen it. I was\nsurprised. I made a copy for her\u2014of a homecoming to Leer by members of the Jewish\ncongregation. You know many of the German communities have sort of welcomed back\nmembers of the Jewish community, who lived there and who emigrated because of the\nHolocaust. And there is this group that came back to Leer. And there\u2019s a film about that group.\nNow there were no relatives of mine in that that I know of. But I would be interested, actually\nwhen we were in Washington last time and my mother, I was looking for the phone book\nactually, which is in a closet. And it was sitting on a little book that, I can\u2019t remember the name,\nin German. It was a German recipe book, in which you wrote recipes and Mother had kept it.\nAnd there was a folded up piece of paper in there and it was a letterhead of my grandfather, of\nmy father\u2019s father, Meir Rosenberg, who was a junk dealer, who, unfortunately committed\nsuicide when my father was very small. Killed himself. But it was his letterhead, on which my\nmother had written a recipe. And she didn\u2019t even know she had it, I just happened to unfold that\npiece of paper. And the recipe is just something she\u2019d been... wrote in like a little notebook.\nBut it covered many years. It was like she started 1t when she was a new bride. It was actually\nbought for her when she was going off on this trip as a young girl, when they sent her off to learn\nto cook, to a pension that was near Frankfurt, which didn\u2019t work out. So she brought it back and\nstarted writing. And it begins in German. I think over at the end some of the recipes are actually\nin English in this country. But she had that thing from Meir Rosenberg, which I don\u2019t know\nwhere that came from. And my father, of course, was in a school, in an orphanage in Hanover.\nAnd I\u2019ve never, because when his father died after a few years during the Depression, there were\nnine kids at home and so his mother just physically, could not economically take care of them\nand she sent three of them off to an orphanage in Hanover. I\u2019ve never looked into, I don\u2019t know\nmuch about that period. And his brothers and sisters, of course, are dead. I think one of his\nsisters, who is now dead, who went to Israel, did go back to Leer and sort of close the chapter on\nthat. And I don\u2019t know the business, you know, went out. We did go to Mother\u2019s home. I think\nI may have mentioned. The butcher shop and the house where she lived was torn, was no longer\nthere. The houses on either side of the house... which I suspect is due to the fact that her dad ran\na butcher shop and they slaughtered animals. And when he went into the, when they left in 1936\nand it was taken over, they continued using it as a butcher shop and I think it probably just\nrotted. Because of its use and constantly having water and blood and other... being used as a\nmanufacturing facility, probably just, you know, decayed. But we met a number of her\ncontemporaries in that town. There\u2019s still a club of her schoolmates. I may have mentioned that\nthe first time around. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Yeah, you did, yeah.",
        "A: So, you know I have some interest. I don\u2019t know that I feel like a genealogist. We do have a\nfamily tree at home, which one of the distant relatives in Norfolk Virginia did, which identified a\nnumber of people who are related, that I didn\u2019t know, some of whom we now know. And my\nbrother did a family tree that goes back pretty far on my mother\u2019s side. And there are a lot of her\nrelatives are in the Chicago area. And cousins and cousins I\u2019ve never met, some of whom I\u2019ve\ntalked to. Magdeburg, I thought was interesting. Berlin is... I mean in a way, to me, the\nattraction to Germany is that I know the language and when you are there, you know that there\u2019s\n12]\nthis, because of the language, that sounds like a language you know or that you know the\nnuances, even if it\u2019s your... fourth or fifth grade, that there\u2019s very little language barrier. The\nlanguage brings with it a familiarity. Not that it\u2019s home, but it\u2019s like home. That this is a place\nyou\u2019re from. And it doesn\u2019t evoke all that hostility in me now, thirty years later. And I would be\ninterested in whether the Jewish community, the Jewish community in Magdeburg and a number\nof the urban areas is growing again, not huge, but is growing. And Berlin is an exciting city. I\nthink more from a tourist standpoint, wonderful museums and they are the parts of Germany I\u2019d\nlike to go see. But I don\u2019t know that I would spend a lot of time trying to dig out more\ninformation. It\u2019s interesting, when I saw that. And last time I was up there I saw... and I now\nhave, or I came across my father\u2019s, the certificate that released him from the concentration camp,\nwhich you\u2019ve seen copies of, I\u2019m sure, other copies of. And that sort of thing. I think they\u2019re\nvery significant. And I think Michael, our children are interested in this history. How much of\nit... and they are somewhat conversant with it. Well, I don\u2019t guess either one of them have been\nback through this, I would... I\u2019m just as interested in taking them to England, where I spent\nquite a bit of time in the Service. But I think both of them probably want to sort of look at this in\ntheir own way.",
        "Q: Have they asked you and did they ask you much as they were growing up about what you\nremembered about your early years before you left Europe?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I think both of them have. At various times we\u2019ve talked about the history and then\nthey\u2019ve read about things that I\u2019ve written obviously. They\u2019ve read my talks. And they\u2019ve\nheard, both of them have talked a good bit with their grandmother. And I think they\u2019re both\ncognizant of the effect 1t\u2019s had on the family. That it is an important part of our history. It\nwould be nice to, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d ever have the time to re-do it all, but neither one of them\nhave been to Europe yet. I hope they go. We\u2019ll see.",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering about, I\u2019ve been trying to kind of frame a big, biggish question for a while.\nMaybe it\u2019s not a question, maybe it\u2019s just an observation, but you\u2019ve, in your work have kind of\ndevoted yourself to people who, really you naturally don\u2019t share a whole lot in common with, I\nmean as far as your own background and your own tradition. And in some ways that\u2019s why...\nbecause those people were separated from mainstream culture and because they were\ndisadvantaged in various ways, that\u2019s why you felt the need to work with them. But yet it seems\nthat your own tradition as a Jew and as a refugee from Nazi Germany has been an important part\nof your identity. I kind of wonder how you\u2019ve kept that connection with your roots and with that\ntradition alive and whether that\u2019s been a difficult balance for you in a context that\u2019s so separate\nfrom it. I think so many Jews and in particular so many refugees, so many survivors have felt\nthe need to be among people who really understand what they\u2019ve been through and who had\nexperienced something similar to what they\u2019d experienced.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. I think some people just feel the need to continue to... I mean I think you\nhave stated it, that there are people who want to be in an atmosphere where they think others are,\nthat only people who have been through something like that or close to it, can understand them.\nMaybe it\u2019s just like our veterans or sometimes they\u2019re the same thing. I mean, I\u2019ve appreciated\nbeing in Eastern Kentucky very much, in terms of also learning about this culture and its history.\n122\nThe crafts and the independence of people who are here and their ancestors. I\u2019ve always\nadmired people who have lived in a rugged way, and appreciated the environment, and...\nEnd of Tape 10, Side A\n123\nTape 10, Side B",
        "A: I\u2019ve always liked being in smaller towns. Just the trusting nature of people who are in smaller\ncommunities, whether it\u2019s Gastonia or whether it\u2019s rural people generally. And people who, we\nused to, I used to say when I worked selling chemicals up North it\u2019s... again you never, you\nalways wonder about generalizing, but it\u2019s like when you\u2019re a salesperson, if you walk into a\nplace in the South, people assume that they can trust you until you prove that you are not\ntrustworthy and do something wrong. And then you\u2019re done for. As opposed to going into many\nof the urban places where one might think that, they begin by thinking they can\u2019t trust you and\nthat you\u2019re going to pull one over on them. And it takes a long time to have them either trust you\nor have some confidence in you. That\u2019s probably, you know, it may be that that\u2019s old hat. I\nthink there\u2019s still a lot of that here. And that that\u2019s just sort of being country people. I don\u2019t\nknow, in terms of not having that much of a surrounding, maybe part of that may be the fact that\nI\u2019m married to a Quaker. I mean I did not marry someone who 1s Jewish. And we accommodate\nthat to the way we want to, and once you... so you make somewhat of a break from the tradition\nthat permeates the homes of Jewish couples and families where both couples are Jewish. So,\nJean is, obviously gave up some of her ties to being in a Quaker environment where she was a\nvery much involved in young Friends activities and probably never foresaw that she would be\nmarried to somebody who was Jewish, although Quakers are very, probably the most tolerant\ngroup, religious group that is out there. So maybe that has something to do with it. You know, I\ncan never look into somebody else\u2019s brain and I don\u2019t know what motivates people, why people\nhappen to be narrow-minded or not narrow minded, or what... You know, there are great\ndifferences among Jews, as you were saying at lunch, in the way, in the philosophy of the\nHolocaust Museum and how it should be run. I have, my mother\u2019s sister, at least one if not both\nof them, but one of them for certain, would say she would never step foot into Germany again. I\nmean there are many Jews who came from there, who think it\u2019s heretical to go back to Germany\nand would never forgive anybody and would draw the line in the sand. Whereas Mom went back\nand would go and continue to have some correspondence with people. And they were very\ntouched to see her and she was touched to see people she went to school with. My ties, and you\nknow I still have very good friends who I went to school with in North Carolina and Gastonia\nand that sort of thing and in the Service. I think it\u2019s all, I guess it\u2019s one humanity. I mean I think\nyou just, you kind of try to get the most out of what you can, wherever you happen to be. And\nthat has been pretty, I think that in terms of relationships here hasn\u2019t been that hard. I think the\nmost difficult, the big difficulty is that, one difficulty is that most of us who are professionals in\nlegal services or in others, who are in a helping profession or if that\u2019s the way we choose to live\nour lives, in a sense we live a pretty, we live, really, a middle-class life with our own\nsurroundings. And we have most of what we need. We are not disadvantaged the way our\nclients are disadvantaged. On the other hand, our value systems are totally different from our\ncounterparts in private practice or in the business community. So we don\u2019t share a lot of their\nvalues. And so you have to kind of make your own life and if you need a lot of friends in the\ncommunity that may be difficult. And I think to some extent that\u2019s why you have turnover in\ncommunities. Or because you become absorbed in your own world and you do stay so busy and\nyou do enjoy the work that you do, that that takes up a lot of your time. Which is some of, I\nthink, the kinds of stuff that Jean and I keep going, that keeps us going. Whereas in a place like\nWashington, even if you\u2019re working all the time, you\u2019re... and legal services is probably that\nway, you\u2019re socializing and working with the same group of people, because you\u2019re always\n124\ntogether. And so you don\u2019t really need a lot of outside help. I think that\u2019s... and that\u2019s why I\nsaid earlier, the school, I think when your kids start to school, you start to develop much more of\na base in the community and you meet parents. Maybe even socially your friends become, at\nleast for a few years, the parents who have kids in schools like you do. And that social\nengagement helps to, I think, draw you into the community and start thinking about things like a\nScience Center. I mean the first ten or fifteen years I was here, the idea of, you\u2019re just going\nuphill all the time. And even the idea that, that you might be working together with the business\ncommunity. I mean when I was filing these coal cases, the very notion of trying to seek funding,\nfrom say the coal council that\u2019s given the Science Center some money to design coal exhibits. I\nwould have said, \u201cWe can\u2019t do that.\u201d We had a big debate, I was on a Bar committee that was\ndoing a booklet for the elderly, health care for the elderly and rights of the elderly. And whether\nwe should get money, accept money from Humana, because we were suing Humana. I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want any of Humana\u2019s money.\u201d Well, we eventually took Humana\u2019s money and gave\nthem a, I can\u2019t remember. The other committee members said, \u201cLet\u2019s get the money, don\u2019t\nworry about it and give them a little acknowledgement. You can sue them. Let\u2019s get their\nmoney.\u2019",
        "Q: Get their money twice.",
        "A: Right, get their money twice. Those are philosophical issues that are hard to grapple with.\nThat\u2019s why I say, now that I\u2019m sharing a grant with a judge. I sued that judge, ten years ago ina\nstrip mining case, he was in the Service. And we\u2019ve had a couple of knock-downs, but he wants,\nhe\u2019s very... I think he, you know, he\u2019s like a lot of other political figures, but he came up the\nhard way and he wants to see this be a better place to live. And he\u2019s willing to invest his time to\ntry to improve housing and clean up garbage and do things that bring in industry. And as long as\nwe don\u2019t bump into each other over other things, I think that\u2019s a good thing to do. And so those\nare the kind of things that help make being in the community more, when you start thinking well\nmaybe we can do things with others and make this a better place for everybody, even if we have\nto step on some toes. The problem in agencies like these is the temptation with many agencies,\nof course, especially state, to jump over, it\u2019s too easy to get co-opted. And so you, as you were\ntalking about, the problem in the museum or any institution, if you start becoming cautious\nbecause you\u2019re afraid somebody\u2019s going to cut your money off, or you\u2019re going to lose your job\nor something is going to happen, then you lose the effectiveness. And I think we\u2019ve been able to\navoid that, I think, pretty well. I think people know, have known me, that I don\u2019t want to get into\nthat position. And the people on both sides of the fence, that I\u2019m not going to do that. If I did\nthat, I'd stop one or the other. That I think that... it doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t compromise.\nBut it is, you get put into those positions and that\u2019s hard, especially when you have funding\nsources that are problematical. I mean, that\u2019s hard. Like the migrant cases, when we had some\npublicity in one of the migrant cases that we filed and people went screaming to Congress. My\ncounterparts are worried we\u2019re going to lose the money in the State Legislature if they find out\nlegal services is involved in this case. That kind of stuff can be really hard, and you just try your\nbest to get through it. But I\u2019m pretty pleased with where we\u2019ve come. I hope whoever takes\nover will keep it going that way. Most of the people who run my offices, I think, have that\nphilosophy. I can\u2019t remember what you asked.",
        "Q: Oh, it was a while ago, it was that big, that big kind of question.\n125",
        "A: Did we ever talk about the end? Did I ever give you the answer to the big question?",

        "A: You know I don\u2019t know, sometimes it\u2019s hard to know, to answer. And you can go on and the\nreality is you don\u2019t really know the answer.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: You just have some ideas.",
        "Q: The questions are just kind of little ways of getting you to talk about things anyway. (Laughing. )\nThey\u2019re not necessarily to find out the answers.",
        "A: You\u2019re wonderful at pricking, at getting somebody started. And I can begin to see why some\npeople, why someone like yourself does so well. I mean this must be hard just to listen to folks\ngo on, but you can see why some folks start writing books collaboratively and are willing to just\nsort of, finally you turn it all over. Say, \u201cWell, just ask me and I\u2019Il talk a while.\u2019",
        "Q: People like me love listening to stories, it\u2019s fun. (Laughing. )",
        "A: One thing I\u2019m not good at is, I don\u2019t have many stories. I know there are people who can tell\nthem. Jean\u2019s father is a marvelous storyteller and he\u2019s ninety-two. And he remembers jokes. I\nmean hundreds of jokes. And I try to get him, have gotten him to put some down on his\ncomputer or to type them up. Because he, Jean knows, has heard many of them. But it\u2019s\namazing. And I cannot remember a joke five minutes. I'll hear one and think it\u2019s wonderful.\nBoy that will be easy. I won\u2019t forget that. I can\u2019t even remember the punch... it just does not\nstay with me.",
        "Q: I think you underestimate yourself, because you\u2019ve told a lot of stories in this... I mean, we\u2019ve\ngot ten tapes full of...",
        "A: Of something!",
        "Q: Is there anything you want to say to close the interview?",
        "A: To the world? To the world?",
        "Q: Here\u2019s your chance. (Laughing. )\n126",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think give Arwen Donahue an award for having listened to all these hours of\ngoing on. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s much more to add. I feel very lucky. I mean I guess I just\nwould say whoever, if you think back on the fact that I was born into a Germany... I think that\nmy father was in a concentration camp. If you think back on all the experiences that I\u2019ve had,\nI\u2019ve been a pretty fortunate person to have been through all these various experiences and to\nhave people appreciate them and to be where we are today and to have so many different\nconnections. I think one of the nice things that Jean and I\u2019ve been able, have had a nice\nopportunity to do is just, we talk about Sherry Arms today. There\u2019s so many of those people,\neither in the Service or in the law, because she\u2019s in the work that she\u2019s in and because of our\ninterest in education, we\u2019ve just met so many people across the state. And have had a chance...\nand if it wasn\u2019t education, it\u2019s the people, those couples she taught childbirth to, because many of\nthose kids are growing up now. When you go to the grocery store and they say, \u201cLook Jean,\nthat\u2019s my twenty... see that, he\u2019s that baby!\u201d And here\u2019s this guy about six feet three inches tall.\nAnd you see all these, you know, you kind of look around you and you say, well, you\u2019ve had a\nlittle opportunity to do something that made a difference over time. I mean it\u2019s not over yet. It\u2019s\nnot an epitaph.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever have one. You just keep going.",
        "A: Well, people are getting older these days, aren\u2019t they? What is the oldest person you\u2019ve\ninterviewed?",
        "Q: That\u2019s a good question, probably ninety. There\u2019s a, I don\u2019t know, have you heard the things on\nNPR? The Hundred Years of Stories? A friend of mine, who\u2019s producing these. I won\u2019t\ntranscribe it.",
        "A: One of these involved...",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you repeat that you are going to talk about a couple of cases, because I didn\u2019t get that\npart either.",
        "A: Yeah, I was just going to tell you about a couple of... when you said is there anything else and\nthen we started talking about stories. And I said I didn\u2019t really do very well with stories, which I\ndon\u2019t. I\u2019m not a storyteller. But I thought I might mention a couple of experiences, just about\nlegal cases that I was involved with that I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve mentioned. The first one is one in\nthe early \u201870s or in the early \u201870s that involved the Paintsville Housing Authority. A family, part\nIndian, named Elsie, the father was named Elsie Dale. They lived in a shack, in an old house and\ntheir house burned down. And so he applied to get into public housing and they wouldn\u2019t let him\nin. So, I went over there and when I got there Elsie had taken some of the charred timbers that\nwere left and put them up against an old automobile, his car. And the family was living there.\nAnd they applied for public housing and they wouldn\u2019t let them in. They wouldn\u2019t let them in\nbecause the community treated them as black, not as... I mean Indian. They were dark-skinned.\nBut they were very poor. And so we went to the Housing Authority. We started investigating.\nAnd it turned out that the Housing Authority had also threatened to kick out some unwed\nmothers. And then there was a guy named, what was this fellow\u2019s name? He was a veteran. A\nsingle father. They didn\u2019t want him to... he wanted to get in with his child. They didn\u2019t want\n127\nhim in. The woman who was running the place, Maxine somebody, was very... she let you in if\nshe knew you. It was who you knew. There was nothing fair about the system and she just\ndidn\u2019t want them in the project. So, we filed a lawsuit. It was one of the first large cases that we\nhad filed. And on the way up there, I had to get, we had a hearing, we were to have a hearing in\nLexington for preliminary injunction. And we were trying to get the witnesses together. And\nthat night I was going to pick up the fellow who was the veteran. And I couldn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t at\nhome. And I finally found him and he was drunk. And I had to get him up there. And so I\nfinally got him in my car, and we got as far as Salyersville and I filled up the gas tank. And he\nwas riding with me. And he wanted, as we were leaving the gas station, he wanted to get out.\nAnd he was... what did he want to do? He started to hit me. I threw hot water in his face. Oh, I\nthrew my coffee at him. And I remember the coffee spot stayed on the side of the car. So, we\nthen drove, we started driving, I had this old Peugeot in 1970, because Jean and I had bought it to\ntake a camping trip. We brought it to drive down here. We had a \u201859 Volvo and we had this old\nPeugeot. And we had like a \u201862 or \u201866 Peugeot, which we had taken on our camping trip. So,\nwe got halfway to Lexington and I started having car trouble. I got out of the car to look under\nthe hood. And my witness, who was still partially drunk, then locked me out of the car. And the\nstars were out. I remember, it was a beautiful night. He wouldn\u2019t let me back in. What was his\nname? Elvin... Anyway, I bet I was out of the car for about half an hour. He finally let me in.\nWe got into Lexington about 1:30 in the morning. Next morning he was sober, and he got on the\nstand and he was a very, very good witness. And I had a blow-up of this big automobile with the\ntimbers and Elsie Dale got on and testified. He had four kids. He needed a four-bedroom unit.\nAnd the clerk of the court started crying. I mean it was so sad, they wouldn\u2019t let him in. But the\njudge would not order the Housing Authority to let them in. He said I could try to prove that\nthere was further discrimination and as it turned out that day... And the unwed mothers, Effie\nPickelsheimer was her name. She testified. We put on a strong case, but the judge was not\ngoing to do anything that day. So anyway we came back. But I always remember throwing this\ncoffee. Thirty years later. What was his name? He had a short, fat... he eventually, the same\nperson was indicted because he shot a guy in the back, who had started a fight with him. And I\nwent to visit him in the jail about twenty years later after that particular... Crum was his second\nname. It wasn\u2019t Elvin Crum, what was his first name? Well, we ended up having a number of\ngrievance hearings. I got the know all the tenants in that project. This case went on for about\ntwo years. In the meantime they were tearing down a new section, an old section of Paintsville.\nSo we were able for Elsie, he really wanted a house of his own. And as part of the settlement of\nthis case we were able to get him a Farmer\u2019s Home House built by the Community Action\nAgency. He never got in the housing project. But they were such a nice family and you knew\nthe only reason they didn\u2019t live in the project was because they were not white. We did finally\nget a very good, agreed court order that required them to set up a very fair system. And for years\nafter that they wouldn\u2019t... anytime there was a question about whether somebody should get in\nor not, they would call me, because they didn\u2019t want to go back to court. But it was a case that\nwent on forever. And finally really was resolved in a very favorable way for the clients in that\nhousing project. I was thinking, another, when we talk about the effect cases have, I represented\na group over from Pike County, who, they were supposed to strip mine above their, they were\ngoing to strip mine this holler above their homes in Poor Bottom off Maribone Creek over in\nPike County. And the families were worried that the strip mine was right over their houses and\nthat the rocks and boulders were... So when we looked into it, we learned that there were deep\nmine workings that had been worked out inside the mountain and that if they strip mined around\n128\nthe front side, they were in danger of hitting those old deep mine workings which were filled\nwith water. And the water would then potentially be a real problem to the people down below.\nIt just could come out in gallons and wash away houses. So we had a couple of hearings in\nFrankfort and one of the lead plaintiffs was named Edith Easterling, who was very much\ninvolved in the case against the McShurleys, which is when the Appalachian Volunteers were\nhere\u2019*. I don\u2019t know if you now about that? There was this series in The New Yorker about this\ncouple that was arrested by the local prosecutor. The case went to the House Un-American\nActivities Committee. Anyway, Edith\u2019s daughter was name Sue Kobak, she\u2019d married a young\nman in Washington. And she was home and she went to the hearings with us. And they couldn\u2019t\nfind, we were the only folks that could represent anybody because it would cost a fortune. There\nwere no lawyers around who would represent this community to try to stop the strip mining. It\nhad actually already started. I had a wonderful expert, a guy who had been an inspector. And\nshe went to the hearings with us. And I didn\u2019t know this until later, after she got home, she\napplied to go to law school and went to law school as a result of seeing this experience. And\nactually an experience that had a favorable outcome. The administrative judge said that we were\nright in that they had left, this information about the water in the old workings was not on the\npermit application. And that he considered it to be a danger to the family and they stopped the\nstrip mining operation totally. Edith Easterling a wonderful person, a remarkable woman. And I\ndidn\u2019t know until after was in... and Sue went to law school and had a difficult time as an\nAppalachian student for a couple of years. She later married a doctor in Clintwood and she\u2019s a\ncity attorney in Clintwood, Virginia. I was just thinking back about those sorts of human, and\nyou become... you were asking me earlier, you become very close to your clients. She had\norganized that little holler. And it potentially was a really serious problem. We did a lot more\nstrip mining work than we have in recent years because some of the lawyers who worked for us\nare now doing that in private practice. I just recently represented somebody in Letcher County,\nwhose name had been left off, their property had been left off a mining map. They just left them\noff because they didn\u2019t... and they knew, they knew that she owned the property that they\nwanted to mine and that she wasn\u2019t going to let them mine. And so they left, they thought, I\nthink, they could get away with it by just leaving their name off the map, which they are required\nto put on to show the property that they intend to mine, figuring they might just pay her damages\nwhen it was over. And she was outside, this is an older widow, looking up there and saw the\ntrees getting cut, coming over the hill. It was one of the cases that I did. And then we stopped\nthem from going any further and the state agreed that they should not do that. So I don\u2019t know, I\nwas just thinking back on Elsie Dale and the people you get to meet in these cases, who have to\nbe pretty gutsy to stand up against pretty moneyed interests, who pay big bucks for lawyers and\nwho hire people in the community, who hire their... I think one of these folks had a son who was\na truck driver for the same company that had mined, that was mining that strip mine. You\u2019re\nalways running into that, that sort of situation. But in every one of these cases, you know,\nwhether it\u2019s in legal services or it\u2019s the discrimination cases like Fannie Lou Hamer, and the\npeople who... Eulah Hall always reminds me of, you mentioned Eulah Hall. You know Eulah\nand I went to Washington together because in this health care case. I don\u2019t know if I mentioned\nthat the first time, when Eulah started this clinic and I was telling you this morning earlier about\nthe medical clinic when they wouldn\u2019t let these folks do this medical thing. What happened\nthen, we asked for a hearing and she was my witness and I took her to, we went to Washington\nand we had an administrative hearing. And they came back down here and did a big\n74 Vista workers arrested under Kentucky Sedition Statute\n129\ninvestigation and they threatened to close it. They ended up reorganizing it with a new board of\ndirectors, and...",
        "Q: They threatened to close the clinic?",
        "A: Clinic, yeah. The clinic, the program that was in being, because it wasn\u2019t doing what it was\nsupposed to do. And then so they ended up reorganizing that clinic with a new board.",
        "Q: The Mud Creek Clinic?",
        "A: Well that\u2019s what turned into the Mud Creek Clinic, which is now a nationally-known clinic.\nBack then it was called, yeah, I guess back then it was just the Mud Creek Clinic. There was a\nperiod of time, it went through several phases, where it was called Big Sandy Health Care,\nwhatever... back then it was really under the Community Action Agency. But eventually it\nbecame the Mud Creek Clinic. Then that clinic burned down. Jean, she got her nursing degree,\ndid her internship out there after it had been burned down. They put a phone on the telephone\npole. And Eulah kept the place going in her house. No one believed she could do it. In three\nweeks she raised like 200,000 dollars over the telephone. And this was a social worker with a\nfifth-grade education. And she raised enough money, maybe it wasn\u2019t two hundred, to build a\nnew clinic. And it\u2019s been expanded several times since then. Now they have a dental clinic and\na daycare center and it\u2019s a real wonderful institution. That was a place, the only place... and a\ngood friend of ours became a doctor there. That\u2019s the place where we took our kids. Now it\u2019s\nrun by a federally-funded group called Big Sandy Health Care up here. They also run a clinic in\nMagoffin County and one in Pike County. And Eulah has stayed right with it. I mean she\u2019s won\nthese wonder woman awards. She\u2019s on lots of boards and lots of committees. And has just kept\non, but day to day she\u2019s still the social worker out there. And she\u2019s represented people in social\nsecurity and black lung cases, and has really learned it. Recently had her picture hung in the\nCapitol in that Women\u2019s Galleria, you know, one of those, the Kentucky Commission on\nWomen, Women of the Year things, or whatever they call them. I\u2019m real proud of her. I think\nshe\u2019s quite a testimonial to what people can do when they want to do it. And she worked with us\nfor a few years as an outreach worker with Appalred. So those are the people you come across,\nyou know. Hard to beat, right? Well, I guess we can call it a day.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, thanks.",
        "A: Oh, I should also mention.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Did we ever talk about the Jewish community in Williamson?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Where we are going to synagogue these days?\n130",
        "Q: You\u2019ve mentioned, you\u2019ve mentioned that you... Williamson? No, I thought you were going to\nsynagogue somewhere in West Virginia. Is that in West Virginia, Williamson?",
        "A: Virginia. Well we went to Portsmouth, I mean we went to Lexington and then to Ashland,\nKentucky for a while. But then most recently, for the last few years, we\u2019ve been going to a\nsmall...\nEnd of Tape 10, Side B\n131\nTape 11, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number eleven, side A.",
        "A: Well, we\u2019re talking about and I was thinking about how you maintain your Judaism as it were. A\nfew years ago we learned that there was still a congregation in Williamson, West Virginia, which\nis about thirty-five miles from here, much closer than Lexington and we went over there one\nFriday night. And found a very friendly group of people, who were meeting sort of monthly and\nbeing served by the rabbi from Huntington, West Virginia, who comes down on a Sunday night\nto do a Friday night service. And the synagogue is an old, old synagogue. I don\u2019t know,\nprobably a hundred years old at least. It sits up on top of a hill in the black section of\nWilliamson. And there\u2019s no elevator and you\u2019ve got to walk up a huge bunch of steps, well,\nprobably twenty-five. And the average age of the people other than us is about seventy. But\nthey\u2019ve kept on going and they consist of folks from Welch and Grundy and nearby people who\nare in a probably twenty, thirty mile area from around Williamson. I think twenty years ago\nduring the height of the coal mining in this area and maybe through the seventies and eighties I\nthink they had fifty families. Over the years the kids have moved away and so the older\nmembers of the Williamson Jewish community are still there. And the President is a fellow\nnamed Bill Rosen, whose son is now a circuit judge in Ashland. But it\u2019s been a nice group of\npeople, and the rabbi, who is from Huntington, is an interesting personality. His wife teaches a,\nnot Headstart, but Upward Bound program. And I\u2019ve actually been... the rabbi teaches a class at\nMarshall University on Jewish studies. And so I\u2019ve visited his class and spoke about the\nHolocaust as sort of a living survivor. But it is interesting, and then it\u2019s much nicer to go to a\ncongregation of that sort, where every person that comes is one more person that makes a\ndifference, rather than going to Lexington, where you\u2019ve got a large congregation at Adath Israel\nand there\u2019s also the Conservative, the Orthodox congregation there. So, that\u2019s been very nice.\nWe actually have, there are other, three other Jewish mixed couples here. Miriam Silman, whose\nfather, by the way, had the contract to, was an engineer, who re-did, who did the plans to re-do\nMount Vernon. And then Pam Weiner, whose husband is from here, from Pike County, and is a\nBuddhist. They just had a baby. And then Deborah Golden, who is a lawyer with my Pikeville\noffice. And then there is another couple in Pikeville, Terry Mulliken, who\u2019s a lawyer. His wife,\nCynthia, has been on my Board. It used to be there\u2019s a large family in Pikeville that used to go\nto Williamson, their name Yaruses. They\u2019re friends of ours. But they, and they go, now they\u2019re\nolder and they go once in a while. But the Williamson community was sort of the hub of the\nJewish residents of this area for many years. Now there are probably twenty families that are\nleft. One of the younger set married, a young woman married an Israeli when she was in Israel\nand they have a little boy. They\u2019ve recently been divorced. Very few young members. But it 1s\nthere and we have, we joined that congregation, so that we once again do have a, sort of a formal\ntie to a Jewish community that\u2019s here, for whatever it\u2019s worth. I guess it\u2019s worth putting that\ndown.",
        "Q: Is it a Conservative?",
        "A: It\u2019s Reform. Now the congregation the rabbi 1s from in Huntington, you had a Reform and an\nOrthodox congregation merge. Really unusual. And so it\u2019s sort of conservative. And I think he\nactually has, for the benefit of the Orthodox members, he has services on Saturday morning as\n132\nwell. He\u2019s a very funny fellow, almost like a stand-up comic when he does sermons. Because\nhe\u2019ll say something very serious and then it will jog his mind to kind of say something funny,\nreminds him of something funny. But he\u2019s a very bright fellow. It\u2019s a nice group. I mean, it\u2019s\nobviously an older group and they depend on one or two people like the Rosens and one or two\nother families to sort of keep it going. You know, once they got the air conditioning... I don\u2019t\nknow how many more years they can do that. There\u2019s not a very strong base down below.\nSomeone did a series in West Virginia, I think 1t may have even been in The New York Times, an\narticle on old congregations. And someone did a project in Kentucky, didn\u2019t they? On Jewish\nsynagogues in Kentucky, a few years ago?",
        "Q: Yeah. Lee Shai Weissbach did a book on synagogues of Kentucky. He\u2019s at the University of\nLouisville.",
        "A: Well, the one in Ashland 1s, I don\u2019t know what they turned it into, a day care center. We used to\ngo there for the first few years we were here. In fact I had a fraternity brother at Duke, whose\nfather, who was Jewish, whose father was the mayor of Ashland back in the \u201850s, and he\u2019s now\ndown in Florida. And then they gave that up. And I think people either went to Portsmouth,\nabout thirty or forty miles north, or to Huntington. That congregation folded. And then we went\nto Lexington for high Holy days. We never really, I was never, didn\u2019t know many people and\nwe were up there for Seder a couple of nights, but you never felt much a part of it. You know\nwhat I mean?",
        "Q: Yeah. So, Jean\u2019s taken, has Jean taken a strong interest in Judaism?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean, I think, we often go Friday nights. She goes with me. She\u2019s always supported\nthat. Doesn\u2019t know any more, doesn\u2019t know a lot of Hebrew. But we also now have Quakers,\nwe have a Quaker group in Eastern Kentucky, which is a very small Quaker group, she may have\nmentioned to you.",
        "Q: Yeah, and I think you actually talked about the Quaker group a little bit in the last...",
        "A: We go there on weekends. I don\u2019t think tomorrow, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s this weekend. I think it\u2019s\nnext weekend, but three or four couples. They\u2019re awfully nice. But she, someone was saying the\nother day... If you ask Michael, I guess maybe both kids sort of consider themselves Jewish.\nNot that they observe or are really close to the synagogues. When Jean told me that about Ann\nLouise, I was a little surprised, but I think that\u2019s what she says. Whether that will always be that\nway, I think they do associate more with us, rather than the Jewish community at large. All\nright.",
        "Q: Okay. This is it.",
        "A: Now I interview you.",

        "Q: Sammy is your father\u2019s brother?",
        "Q: I have a couple questions.",
        "Q: When was, I wondered about your father\u2019s and your uncle\u2019s being arrested. Were most Jewish\nmen in Magdeburg arrested? Yeah.",
        "Q: I asked you about whether Jewish men in Magdeburg in general were arrested.",
        "Q: Before we leave Germany I want to, I had another question. First about Kristallnacht. You\ndescribed being taken out of your house in the middle of the night by the Storm Troopers and\nthen watching them burn all the Torah scrolls. Was that the first... what do you remember,\npersonally, about that? Was that the first time that you had realized the danger of the situation?",
        "Q: So, do you remember that moment of watching the Torah scrolls be burned and being pulled out\nof your house in the middle of the night?",
        "Q: So do you remember being particularly afraid? No.",
        "Q: Okay, one more question about Germany, then... you had mentioned, did you mention that your\nfather was involved in some way with helping Jews, who wanted to emigrate to Palestine?",
        "Q: Can you say something about that? And also did he have any interest, did your parents have any\ninterest in trying to emigrate to Palestine at that time?",
        "Q: Yeah, you can go ahead and say what camp he was in.",
        "Q: ...sorry, let me just quickly say, this is tape number two, side A of an interview with John\nRosenberg.",
        "Q: Did you all enter Holland illegally?",
        "Q: Did they know that they would be staying in this transit camp?",
        "Q: So everyone in the camp was waiting to come to the United States?",
        "Q: Did they have to, did your family have to pay to stay there and have their meals? Or how did\nthat work?",
        "Q: The whole camp?",
        "Q: Completely on his own?",
        "Q: Do you know his name? The name of the father and the son?",
        "Q: No, I started to chuckle, because I said the name of the father and the son, and just almost said\nthe Holy Ghost. (Laughter.)",
        "Q: Was this part of the hold-up, that you didn\u2019t have a sponsor in the U.S. ?",
        "Q: Westerbork?",
        "Q: So it was very, very fortunate. If you hadn\u2019t gotten onto that boat, you wouldn\u2019t have gotten out.",
        "Q: And they both did not survive the war?",
        "Q: I had a couple of questions about your time in the camp, at least one question. So when you\nwere staying in the camp in Rotterdam, you were presumably one of your father\u2019s students. Do\nyou remember what the school...?",
        "Q: How many students were in the school together?",
        "Q: Did you all have to share bathrooms with a bunch of other people?",
        "Q: Did your dad teach all the lessons in German?",

        "Q: Your uncle and your grandmother?",
        "Q: Was he a kosher butcher?",
        "Q: Before we go on, do you remember anything else about your journey to the U.S.?",
        "Q: What about arriving? Did you arrive at New York harbor?",
        "Q: Do you remember how you felt at the time?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t speak any English.",
        "Q: So, did you talk about the plight of the Jews in Europe?",
        "Q: Was your lack of socialization a problem at all or did you, were you, did you really feel\nconfident enough that it didn\u2019t affect you?",
        "Q: I was going to ask you about that. It seems that, well I\u2019ve heard other people talk about arriving\nin New York and there being a lot of encouragement for Jews who were immigrating to go to\nvarious other parts of the country. And so many people just didn\u2019t want to do that and felt so\nstrongly about that, that they stayed in New York even though there was no economic\nopportunity at all. And I guess this is more of an observation than a question, but your dad\nseems to have been somebody who was very open-minded and aware of opportunities, and that\nprobably shaped your life a lot, too. I mean, being a child in a situation where you experienced\nthis extreme disadvantage through having your childhood interrupted so much, and then having\nyour family really be broken apart, and many of them killed. But for you to be able to arrive in\nthis new place and be kind of honored for who you are and what your history is... it\u2019s kind of\ndifferent than what Jewish kids in New York, who were immigrating were experiencing for the\nmost part, it seems to me. There were so many immigrants, and so many survivors and people\nwho weren\u2019t really overall encouraged to talk about what had happened to them.",
        "Q: Did you have a Bar Mitzvah?",
        "Q: Did you prepare for that with your father?",
        "Q: You think that if they weren\u2019t afraid to lose their business, that they would have been inclined to\npush for desegregation?",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A of an interview with John Rosenberg.",
        "Q: So, then was the time that you were in the Air Force the first time that you had had close\npersonal contact with black people and formed friendships?",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about, when you were talking about your experiences in Boy Scouts, and\nyour earlier years in Gastonia. I\u2019m wondering if there was ever a conflict between your Jewish\nidentity and your Jewish practice and your social life? Did people expect you to be Christian and\nto be participating in things as a Christian? Was that ever a problem for you?",
        "Q: I was going to ask you, did your, do you think your parents taught you Judaism in a way that\nallowed you to think of that as not being a contradiction?",
        "Q: Was his name William?",
        "Q: Yeah, now I\u2019m remembering who they are. Yeah. I think they\u2019re still volunteering there.\n31",
        "Q: Was your brother a scout, too?",
        "Q: Was being Jewish important to you at the time, from a young age?",
        "Q: And I\u2019d really like to discuss that more and maybe it would make more sense to do that after\nwe've really discussed your work here and with the Civil Rights Division so that it can be put\nmore in context. Do you think? Or do you want to say something about it now?",
        "Q: Well, your later years (laughing), the rest of your life that we haven\u2019t talked about yet.",
        "Q: But I definitely am interested in hearing how your Holocaust, when you say that your Holocaust\nexperiences that had a profound effect on your subsequent work.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019m sorry, it was just immigrants that weren\u2019t allowed to have these things?",
        "Q: During the early years that you were in the United States and Spartanburg and Gastonia, as the\nwar is developing, were you aware of what was happening in Europe to the Jews? Were you\nable to follow that?",
        "Q: Well, the stuff that filtered through the press was sketchy and sometimes you\u2019d get news about\nwhat was happening to the Jews, but it wasn\u2019t really until after the war when the liberators were\nencountering the camps and involved with liberating a lot of them that they really knew the\nextent of what was happening and that, that started to really, that started to really reach the press.\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been until \u201845, probably. And definitely as far as keeping in contact, that would\nhave been really hard.",
        "Q: The camps that the Red Cross...",
        "Q: The camps that the Red Cross visited were cleaned up and altered for the media, and made into\nkind-of stages.",
        "Q: Do you remember, do you remember learning about it later? Or do you remember what was\ngoing on in your family in 1945 when you started to learn about what was happening?",
        "Q: Yeah, it seems like memories change so much over time.",

        "Q: She went to Israel in \u201845?",
        "Q: No. And I haven\u2019t talked to a whole lot of people who were in this country during those years. I\nmean most of the people I\u2019ve talked to came right afterwards.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah, sure, yeah. I\u2019d love to see some of the pictures you mentioned.",
        "Q: So, changing the subject a little bit, when you were in college at Duke, you were really interested\nat that point in science? Is that what you thought you were going to have a career in?",
        "Q: So you graduated in what year?",
        "Q: \u00b053, and then you enlisted?",
        "Q: So was there any, that was during the Korean War, right?",
        "Q: So there was no... you knew that you weren\u2019t going to get involved in the war if you...",
        "Q: Okay, it is now August 21st and we\u2019re back again for more interviewing and Mr. Rosenberg\u2019s\ngoing to say some things that he learned last night from talking to his mother.\n'2 Bad T\u00e9lz, Germany\n38",

        "Q: So what compelled you to go back was kind of, was it just a kind of curiosity to see the place?\nOr did you have any...",
        "Q: About going to Israel, did you have any, did you ever had any Zionist feelings or any desire to\nlive there?",

        "Q: This is tape number four, side A of an interview with John Rosenberg.",
        "Q: And when you say you wouldn\u2019t call yourself a pacifist, what does that mean? Does that mean\nthat you... well we\u2019ll just leave it at that. What does that mean?",
        "Q: Were you aware of criticisms of Jews during the Holocaust, that they had not resisted enough?\nAnd that they had been too pacifistic and just passive in allowing the violence to happen to them,\nthat they had...?",
        "Q: In general in the whole... there were some criticisms that were voiced, especially just\nimmediately following the war by Bruno Bettelheim and others that the Jews had gone like sheep\nto the slaughter. And that they had not resisted enough. That this was a problem with the Jewish\npeople, that they were not ready enough to take up arms to defend themselves. And I\u2019m\nwondering if you, if you shared that point of view or if you were aware that people thought that,\nor if you have any thoughts about that?",
        "Q: Were you aware of, by the time that you were in the Air Force, were you very interested in\nAmerican politics, political issues? [ll leave it at that. I have another related question.",
        "Q: Did you have, so you joined the Air Force in 1954?",
        "Q: The reason I\u2019m asking is I\u2019m interested in your awareness of the Civil Rights movement\ndevelopments and whether you were aware of or particularly interested in what went on with\nBrown versus the Board of Education.",

        "Q: How did you manage it?",
        "Q: How did that work? If there were eight civil rights lawyers in the Department and then you had\nJohn Doar, who was going down into the center of things and networking with the leaders?\nWould you go along with Doar on selected cases and other lawyers on other cases? Or how did\nit actually, what did you do?",
        "Q: Was this where Vernon Dahmer\u2019? was from?",

        "Q: Do you remember, before you go on to that, how Mrs. Hamer was afterwards when you visited\nher?",
        "Q: I have a couple of questions. When you were talking about the case that you worked on in which\nFannie Lou Hamer and June Jordan [sic] and the others were beaten in jail. Your exact role in\nthat was, were you the only lawyer working on that?",
        "Q: Did you spend time with them socially?",

        "Q: I\u2019m curious about, when you talk about interviewing the jurors. How did you, what did you do?\nDid you take notes? What was your method?",
        "Q: That was in 1967. Is that right?",

        "Q: Did you say his name?",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you kind of a general question. I\u2019m going to try to phrase it clearly, but it might\nnot... take a little while. You mentioned something earlier about living in the South and how\nyou wanted to live in the South and in a way you were proud of being a Southerner and you were\naware of the things that were good and were motivated to be there because of that... to change\nsome of the things that were not as good. I have kind of the idea that so many Northerners and\nmaybe particularly Jews, who lived in the North, felt that the South was backwards and\ncontrolled by the Klan and there would be too much anti-Semitism and too much maybe lack of\nculture or something, putting it crudely or maybe over-exaggerating. But I\u2019m wondering what it\nwas that you saw about living in the South that was so positive, that made yourself identify as a\nSoutherner and motivated you in this whole endeavor?",
        "Q: Did your work change a whole lot after the Civil Rights Act passed?",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "Q: Did you have anything to do with writing that legislation, the Voting Rights Act?",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights Movement in general and your perceptions of its\nvarious goals and conflicts within the movement. You mentioned SNCC being, and I thought\nmaybe I should mention for the tape that, that\u2019s the Student Non-Violent Coordinating\nCommittee. Right? I was thinking about that and the ideal of non-violence that King and people\nwho worked in that spirit, people who worked with SNCC and people who worked in the\nSouthern Christian Leadership Conference, versus Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, a little\nlater on. How did you perceive that? I mean you were talking a little bit earlier about how you\ndon\u2019t, about non-violence and how you don\u2019t feel that if you were in a situation like that you\nwould just turn the other cheek and let somebody gun down you or somebody dear to you.\nWhereas King was very committed to non-violence and some of his followers were as well.\nWhat were your perceptions of that and of Malcolm X\u2019s agenda?",
        "Q: What did your parents think of your civil rights work?",
        "Q: This is tape number six, side A of an interview with John Rosenberg. So he wasn\u2019t sympathetic\nto demonstrations?",
        "Q: What\u2019s your response to that kind of remark?",
        "Q: Do you think that your awareness of and to some extent your direct experience of persecution of\nthe Jews during World War II, affected your, influenced your interest in working for civil rights\nfor blacks?",
        "Q: You talked...",
        "Q: Would you tell how you met Jean?",
        "Q: Get a chance to fill in the record. Your wife, Jean.",
        "Q: Now will you tell the story of how you did that? You mentioned it last night, but we didn\u2019t get it\non tape.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember saying that?",
        "Q: Was that premeditated, that phone call? It sounds like it was just all of sudden you\u2019re waiting in\nline for food and you just felt like, I gotta go. I gotta go propose marriage. (Laughing.)",
        "Q: And when did you meet her?",
        "Q: This is tape number six, side B. You were just talking about proposing to Jean and the\nimmediate aftermath of that. Had Jean met your parents by then, by the time that you proposed\nto her?",
        "Q: And that first meeting between her parents and your parents and you... would you like to\ndescribe that scene?",
        "Q: What\u2019s CRLA?",
        "Q: This is tape number seven, side A of an interview with John Rosenberg.",
        "Q: When did that final decision come down?",
        "Q: When you first came to Prestonsburg, you and Jean, were you planning on really settling here,\nreally staying for the long haul?",
        "Q: Is that what happened?",
        "Q: Do you want to talk about David and your involvement there?",
        "Q: Okay, we were just talking a little bit, off tape, about how many things we\u2019d, I'd still like to\ncover about your time in Prestonsburg and working for, working with Appalred. And that we\nprobably don\u2019t have the time to get into it all today. So, I was thinking about, when we were just\ntalking a little bit, off tape, about your time here in Prestonsburg, and maybe you can reflect on\nyour work here and a little bit on just the, what you\u2019ve, it turns out that you\u2019ve devoted your life\nto. I mean you had the opportunity of becoming a chemical salesman and you decided that\nwasn\u2019t what you wanted to do. And you\u2019ve gone more and more in the direction of service. Any\nreflections or words on that?",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about African-Americans?",
        "Q: Teased him in terms of...?",
        "Q: Tape seven, side B. Go ahead.",
        "Q: I wondered, you mentioned that there is some racism in the area and you also talked a little\nearlier about how you had a difficult time when you first arrived, because people were thinking\nof you all as Communists or something like that. And you had trouble renting an office and so\nforth. Did you experience any anti-Semitism? Did people know that you were Jewish? Has that\nbeen a problem at all?",
        "Q: Do they try to convert you?",
        "Q: Would you just talk a little bit about your and Jean\u2019s practice as far as faith, religion? You go to\nsynagogue once a month? You go to a Quaker meeting once a month?",
        "Q: And do you always go to the Quaker meetings, too?",
        "Q: And how did you raise your kids? Were they involved in both religions?",
        "Q: To you in particular?",
        "Q: Do you want to say something in closing now?",
        "Q: Would you lead us in a prayer?",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s a good idea. Okay, Ill see you in thirty years. Well, thank you.",
        "Q: Okay, it\u2019s May 27\", 2000 and we\u2019re several months later, picking up on our interview with John\nRosenberg and so this is actually tape eight, side A.",
        "Q: Yeah. So, going back, we were just talking a little bit off tape about some of your, about some of\nyour speaking experiences and things that you\u2019ve brought up or drawn upon when you\u2019ve gone\nto commencement addresses and so forth. And one of the things that you mentioned was the last\ncase that you had before you left the Justice Department which had to do with the Kent State\nUniversity violence. Can you talk about your role in that and your point of view about what\nhappened?",
        "Q: So you just filed the case, but you didn\u2019t investigate it?",
        "Q: I wonder also if you had, at the time if you felt, you had mentioned in the earlier sessions of this\ninterview how much you idealized this country and its constitution and the principles on which it\nwas founded, and that you really held, had high expectations of it. During the Vietnam War did\nyou feel disillusioned with this country and its government? Or did that change your perspective\nat all?",
        "Q: Yeah. Kind of related to what you were saying, can you talk more, you had mentioned that\nsometimes, you mentioned off tape and I\u2019d like to get this on tape, that you mentioned when you\ngo to speak at various places within the community, people are interested in, partially interested\nin hearing you speak because of your Holocaust-related experiences. And maybe you can talk\nabout your, your invitation to speak at the hundred-year anniversary of one of the black churches\nhere and also talk about why you think it is that people want to hear about that particular aspect.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, considering your significant experience, you spent a lot of time working on civil\nrights and a lot of time here in Appalachia working on helping the poor with legal services. And\nit\u2019s interesting that the thing that people would pick out when they want to hear something from\nyou, is this thing that really happened in your distant past and really has to do with your roots,\nwhich hasn\u2019t been so much the focus of your very significant work and interesting work. Do you\nthink, I\u2019m trying to... there\u2019s kind of a question in there somewhere, but I think, you know,",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: All right, this 1s tape eight, side B. And uh, related to your work or to your experiences with\nspeaking to groups, you had mentioned a little bit earlier that you have on Law Day talked about\nthe Holocaust. And what do you talk about when you talk about the Holocaust on Law Day\u2019?",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you just talk about... you had mentioned in the first sessions that we did, something\nabout the relationship between Judaism and justice, and it was something that you said that you\nhad thought about. Would you elaborate on that some?",
        "Q: The question that had come to my mind before, that had slipped out, was kind of related to\nsomething that, when I\u2019ve interviewed other Holocaust survivors, that gets brought up a lot. And\nI don\u2019t know whether you\u2019 ll have anything to say to it or not. But often I hear people say that\nthey feel, hear people state an opinion about whether a Holocaust could happen again. And\nmany people say, \u201cI think this is going to happen again.\u201d That there is going to be some kind of\nmass persecution of the Jewish people. And some people feel like that\u2019s not going to happen,\nbut a lot of... 1t just comes up, and I\u2019m wondering whether you feel like... you were talking a\nlittle bit earlier about the legal system in this country. Do you feel like that system 1s really\nstable enough so that there is not potential for that kind of disruption or do you feel like it is\npossible for something like that to happen in this country?",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we go back and we were talking a little earlier about how we might get some more\ndetail about your work on the Neshoba County case. So, go back to there and then work forward\nagain. Last time we talked about it, you mentioned a little bit about how you had been working\n101",

        "Q: So, she understood English, but couldn\u2019t speak it?",
        "Q: Did you... you strike me as a person with a lot of energy and a lot of drive to go on, but did you\never just feel depressed and have trouble getting out of the bed in the morning? Or is that just\nnot an issue for you? (Laughing. )",
        "Q: Well, in any of these. I mean, I would, just picturing studying the dental records of these people\nwho had been brutally murdered for working on a good cause. And then you\u2019ve done other work\nsince then that\u2019s had to have been very depressing. I just wonder how...",
        "Q: This is tape nine, side A. Will you, will you just repeat what you had started to say?",
        "Q: We did. Is there anything else you want to say about the Neshoba County case?",
        "Q: Do people ask you to speak about your civil rights era experiences very often?",
        "Q: I wondered if you want to say anything else about the desegregation work you were doing in\nHouston? You mentioned it in the last interview. One of the things that you mentioned in the\nlast interview that I thought you might want to comment on now, 1s that you said it was the\nbeginning of the Nixon administration and you were seeing that that there was kind of a move\naway from real advancement with civil rights. And that Houston, working in Houston, there was\nnot a, you didn\u2019t give much detail, but 1t seemed you weren\u2019t very hopeful for things moving in a\nreal positive direction there. Do you want to talk about that?\n\u00b0\u00a2 Taylor Branch, author of the trilogy America in the King Years.",
        "Q: No, I just...",
        "Q: You talked about how you had come to Kentucky and the whole process of establishing\nyourselves in Prestonsburg and some of the challenges involved in that. And I thought maybe\nyou might want to say a little bit more about... one of the things that has struck me, just in\nreading a little bit about Appalred and the early years and your talking about it last time that we\ntalked here, is that when you talked about the difficulty of getting established, you said that it\nwas difficult. But from what other people have said, they suggested that 1t was a lot more\ndifficult than you let on the last time that we talked. I wondered if there\u2019s... I mean you had\nmentioned that you had trouble renting a place and so forth. But what else was happening\nbesides that, during that time? Did any of the difficulty make you feel like, \u201cOkay, if things\ndon\u2019t turn around soon, we\u2019re out of here?\u201d",
        "Q: It\u2019s all right with me. You cold?",
        "Q: What about among the clientele? What kind of relationship did you have with most of the\nclients? Was it just strictly professional? And did you feel a good rapport?",
        "Q: Does that happen still?",
        "Q: This is tape nine, side B.",
        "Q: You talked last time about your, about a few of the cases... Do you need a coffee break?\n(Laughing.) Do you, okay, so last time you talked about the Broad Form Deed and how that case\nwas dealt with and the victory that resulted from that. And you talked about the development of\nthe community in David and I\u2019m wondering... and you also talked about the establishment of the\nKentuckians for the Commonwealth, which was called Fair Tax Coalition first, and the work that\nthat organization started on doing. So I think those were the main things that you talked about\nduring this era that you have been in Prestonsburg. I\u2019m wondering if you want to highlight\nanything else from those years? Go into detail about anything else?",
        "Q: Do you want to say anything, you\u2019ve been mentioning that it\u2019s been kind of a turbulent time for\nlegal services in general. Do you want to say something about your perspective on the state of\nlegal services and what direction it might be taking?",
        "Q: Well, it sounded like you were basically finished with your train of thought, weren\u2019t you?",
        "Q: Said that this year, you\u2019re at the same level that you were at last year. You weren\u2019t cut anymore,\nbut...",
        "Q: Do you want to take a break and stretch out?",
        "Q: Okay, tape number ten, side A, an interview with John Rosenberg. I guess now would be a good\ntime for you to say something about your work with establishing the Science Center.",
        "Q: And are you, what are you picturing your role to be in future years?",
        "Q: You mentioned your mother a little earlier and what\u2019s your, when you meet up with her and see\nher, do you, do you usually talk about your family history at this point? What kinds of, what\nkind of relationship do you have with her?",
        "Q: How old is she now?",
        "Q: Has she or have you had any interest in visiting, I know you\u2019ve been back to Magdeburg, but you\nmentioned it was more of a sightseeing trip. Have you had any strong interest in doing a more\ninvestigative trip? Maybe going to Leer where your father was born?",
        "Q: Yeah, you did, yeah.",
        "Q: Have they asked you and did they ask you much as they were growing up about what you\nremembered about your early years before you left Europe?",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering about, I\u2019ve been trying to kind of frame a big, biggish question for a while.\nMaybe it\u2019s not a question, maybe it\u2019s just an observation, but you\u2019ve, in your work have kind of\ndevoted yourself to people who, really you naturally don\u2019t share a whole lot in common with, I\nmean as far as your own background and your own tradition. And in some ways that\u2019s why...\nbecause those people were separated from mainstream culture and because they were\ndisadvantaged in various ways, that\u2019s why you felt the need to work with them. But yet it seems\nthat your own tradition as a Jew and as a refugee from Nazi Germany has been an important part\nof your identity. I kind of wonder how you\u2019ve kept that connection with your roots and with that\ntradition alive and whether that\u2019s been a difficult balance for you in a context that\u2019s so separate\nfrom it. I think so many Jews and in particular so many refugees, so many survivors have felt\nthe need to be among people who really understand what they\u2019ve been through and who had\nexperienced something similar to what they\u2019d experienced.",
        "Q: Get their money twice.",
        "Q: Oh, it was a while ago, it was that big, that big kind of question.",
        "Q: Well, I think you addressed it, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "Q: The questions are just kind of little ways of getting you to talk about things anyway. (Laughing. )\nThey\u2019re not necessarily to find out the answers.",
        "Q: People like me love listening to stories, it\u2019s fun. (Laughing. )",
        "Q: I think you underestimate yourself, because you\u2019ve told a lot of stories in this... I mean, we\u2019ve\ngot ten tapes full of...",
        "Q: Is there anything you want to say to close the interview?",
        "Q: Here\u2019s your chance. (Laughing. )",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever have one. You just keep going.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a good question, probably ninety. There\u2019s a, I don\u2019t know, have you heard the things on\nNPR? The Hundred Years of Stories? A friend of mine, who\u2019s producing these. I won\u2019t\ntranscribe it.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you repeat that you are going to talk about a couple of cases, because I didn\u2019t get that\npart either.",
        "Q: They threatened to close the clinic?",
        "Q: The Mud Creek Clinic?",
        "Q: Okay. Well, thanks.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve mentioned, you\u2019ve mentioned that you... Williamson? No, I thought you were going to\nsynagogue somewhere in West Virginia. Is that in West Virginia, Williamson?",
        "Q: This is tape number eleven, side A.",
        "Q: Is it a Conservative?",
        "Q: Yeah. Lee Shai Weissbach did a book on synagogues of Kentucky. He\u2019s at the University of\nLouisville.",
        "Q: Yeah. So, Jean\u2019s taken, has Jean taken a strong interest in Judaism?",
        "Q: Yeah, and I think you actually talked about the Quaker group a little bit in the last...",

        "A: Okay. This is John Rosenberg. I was born in Magdeburg, Germany on October seventh, 1931.\nDon\u2019t remember much about that day. (Laughter.)",
        "A: Hans Meinhart Rosenberg, which was changed. And I retained the Meinhart, I mean in this\ncountry we call it Meinhart, I don\u2019t refer to the middle name very often. I think when I got off,\nwhen my family came to this country, the immigration authorities told my mother that most\npeople who were named, most men who were named Hans became John. And so I became John.\nAnd somehow my father was not there at the time, because he said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you name him\nHenry?\u201d But I did not keep the Hans. Some people do keep Hans. There are some Hanses\naround, right?",
        "A: So, that\u2019s where the John comes from. And I have kept the Meinhart. My father actually kept\nthe Israel that Hitler gave him. His name was Rudolph Rosenberg. And you know Hitler gave\nthe men Israel and the women Sarah. And the one thing he retained when he came to this\ncountry, was he called himself Rudolph Israel Rosenberg. Rudolph I., which I don\u2019t think he had\na middle initial from birth.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it pre-dates me. I don\u2019t think anyone else in the family has it. And my mom asks\nme, do I have any questions when I talk to her, and that\u2019s one question I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever\nasked, is where the Meinhart came from. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the literature. I don\u2019t know, but\nit would be a good question to ask her.",
        "A: Her name is Gerta Schubach Rosenberg. Her maiden name is Schubach. She was, which her\nfather was a butcher in a town called Idar-Oberstein, which is near Bad Kreuznach, and which\nwe have visited since. And she has still some correspondence with an acquaintance. Well, the\n1\nlast, we went to visit a woman a few years ago, when Jean and I\u2014Jean\u2019s my wife\u2014took Mom\nback to that community. And there was a woman in the next town, which is Oberreidenbach,\nand she was sort of a maid helper in the house. Because my father, her father had a butcher shop\nand her mother had worked, also worked in the store. And I think when they had, traditionally\nwhen they had their meals, it was the three daughters and the parents and all the people who\nworked in the shop. And they did slaughtering on the premises, so they needed help in the\nhousehold. And so she, this woman was still alive. She was in her nineties when we were there\nabout five years ago. But... and I visited that town when I was in the service. I don\u2019t know if\nyou want to do this chronologically, sort of, or how, but...",
        "A: Yeah, well when I was in the Air Force, I was in Germany at one point from 19... I was in\nEngland from 1953 to 1957 with an air resupply group. And our mission was sort of an\nintelligence mission, but we dropped Special Forces in training missions during those days where\nthe Cold War with Russia. And one of our training missions was actually in, we went to\nGermany and the, they attempted to... what they tried to do was set up a situation where they\nwould drop you out of an... if you were dropped out of an airplane behind enemy lines, how do\nyou find your way back and stay out of the way of the bad guys. And the way they did that was\nto take you out in a truck and drop you off one at a time in fairly isolated places. And as they\nwere doing it, I happened to look out in the little slit in the back of the truck and I found myself\nrecognizing the street that my grandfather\u2019s butcher store was on. It was called the\nWasenstrasse. And so we went through this exercise. Took about a week. They identified\ncertain farmers, who were friendly farmers and if you can make your way into that circuit, they\npick you up and give you good meals and you stay out of the way of the bad guys. If the bad\nguys get you, you\u2019re in trouble. But when that exercise was over, I went back to Idar-Oberstein\nand there were still people there who remembered changing my diapers, for example. And some\nof those folks who knew my grandfather and my mother, some of my mother\u2019s contemporaries\nwere still there. And then when I came, that was in like around 1956. More recently when we\ntook, Jean and I took Mom back, it\u2019s probably, oh when we went together it\u2019s probably five or\nsix years, maybe even eight or nine years ago, and we happened to, well we did a sight-seeing\ntour that actually started in... my, Jean\u2019s family\u2019s from, her mother is from Sweden, or her\nmother\u2019s family. We started up there and then we drove and eventually made our way to Idar-\nOberstein and spent a few days there. And while we were there, it turned out that a number of\nher contemporaries were... had this monthly group that got together, and even though they were\nin their seventies and eighties, and they took a, and they\u2019d get together once a month and they\u2019d\nput a little money in a coffee pot and once a year they\u2019d take all that money they gathered and\ntake a trip on the train to some other place. And it happened that while we were there, that was\nthe week they were getting ready to take the big train trip. And so we were able to go to the\nstation when all her own school buddies were there that morning, which was very nice. And we\nmet some other friends of hers, who remembered her. And one fella gave us, he had a picture of\nthe school they went to. But the house, the butcher shop had deteriorated and was no longer\nthere, but some of the neighbors were there. Anyway that\u2019s the tie-in to her community. And\nwe can talk a little bit more about it later.\n2",
        "A: I think not. We did not... we really did not... our trip wasn\u2019t very long. We stayed in a hotel,\nand we did some sight-seeing and walking around in the area. And most of the people who were\nher age were obviously not Jewish. Her... although he was not a kosher butcher store that he\nhad... as far as I know, we really didn\u2019t run into the Jewish community, any Jews there. When\nwe were in Magdeburg, I mean this is a pretty small town, although now it\u2019s been reconstructed\nand it has some similarities to... the Nahe River runs through the town of Oberstein. And they\ndid an interesting architectural thing. They covered, they have the highway over, they built a\nhighway over the river, which made you, made the streets much more accessible. Because the\nNahe River separated the town of Idar from Oberstein and so it\u2019s called Idar-Oberstein.\nAnyway, in Pikeville, they did this huge cut-through to... because the town used to flood. And\nthey cut the big, made a cut through in the bend of the river and filled that in, much like this\nparticular area, but in a different way. Anyway, Idar-Oberstein is a little, has been rebuilt. I\ndon\u2019t think it was terribly damaged during the war, but it\u2019s sort of touristy. Looks like a little\nSwiss village downtown. And I think if we had stayed there a little longer, we might have made\nmore, a few more connections. The women who, this women\u2019s group, for example, told Mother\nthat one of her boyfriends from school days was now in a nursing home. In fact, it was the\nperson... his name was Hans. And one of the funny stories is my mother decided to name me\nafter him. But he apparently was really failing, was in his nineties. And we didn\u2019t take the time\nand she didn\u2019t feel like she wanted to go to the nursing home. And I think, I think there are\nsome, you know, all the feelings about that place aren\u2019t great, because her family left. I mean\nher father and her two sisters came to this country before, in 1936. They recognized a little\nearlier that they wanted to get out of the country. And I think one of the men who worked for\nmy grandfather took the butcher shop over and he was, himself very... I\u2019ve learned, very\nsympathetic to Hitler and was very much involved locally or never... I don\u2019t know whether he\njust took over the business, didn\u2019t buy it. But I know there was all the family felt pretty badly\nabout that. And some members of my family never want to go back to Germany. Her two\nsisters have never gone back. We did a little bit of exploring. My mother, there\u2019s a small Jewish\ncemetery, my mother had a sister who died, a fourth sister, who died early, either when her\nmother gave birth to her... her mother had been married, her father had married twice. But there\nis the grave of the young child, who either died, was like a month old. And so that cemetery was\nstill kept in quite good condition. I don\u2019t think there was a synagogue there. It\u2019s coming back a\nlittle bit. But we really did not meet any members of the Jewish community and I doubt if there\nare any Jews in Oberstein. Because when we did go, we then went to Magdeburg, my home.\nWe had not been to Magdeburg at all, because it was in the East zone. Hamburg was in the West\nzone and Magdeburg is the next large city down the Elbe River from Hamburg. So when we\nwent back to Magdeburg, they were having, it had been badly bombed in several major raids. It\nwas a town of about three hundred thousand people, an industrial center. We lived in the\nsynagogue, we\u2019ll get to this a little bit later, but we had... and the Russians had renamed all the\nstreets, so they were just starting to rename them back. And so we had a little trouble finding,\ntrying to orient the map to show Mother where we used to live and the synagogue we used to live\nin, where it was. Now there\u2019s just a memorial tablet in the location. There was a big office\nbuilding. But that is gone. But then we, it happened that during the week we were there, they\nhad a memorial exhibit to the Jewish community from Magdeburg in one of the... there\u2019s a\ncloister there. There\u2019s a very large cathedral in Magdeburg, which is fairly famous. And there\nwas actually, the week we were there, they were having a, one of these annual conferences of the\n3\nProtestant gathering in Germany that moves around. All the churches were there and they had\nbooths set up and they had services 1n the main square. And one of the groups there was a group\nthat was trying to promote better relationships between Germany and Israel. And they, they\nwere not Jewish, but that was the mission of this group. And they pointed us in the direction of\nsome people who knew some of the Jewish folks. Again, we went to see this exhibit and I can\nget into that with you a little bit, because one of the exhibits involved, it was a diary written by\nthe person who was the Rabbi in the congregation with my father, who had written a diary when\nthey were picked up to go to the Holocaust museum. I mean to go to the concentration camp.\nSo, this 1s a long winded way of telling you that there, we know there was a Jewish congregation.\nWhen we were walking around the city buildings, and we had this...bumped into this woman\nwho was Jewish or who knew the Jewish... had some connection. And she worked in the city\nhall, worked with the mayor, just happened. And so, it happened when we were walking by that\nthe mayor came out and we spoke to him a little bit. And he said they were just trying, starting,\nhe was interested and glad to meet mother and said the city was starting to put together an event\nlike a lot of other cities had done, to bring the Jewish members of the congregation or for the\nJews from Magdeburg, back to Magdeburg for a kind of gathering and reconciliation sort of\nthing. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happened or she continues to get mailings now from the\ncongregation which is... there was not an active synagogue that we knew of or could find. I\nthink they said there were several hundred families, but we really didn\u2019t go out of our way. I\u2019ve\ngot a book, little brochure at home or here, from that exhibit, which was very touching and very\nnice. Had a huge wall-sized photograph of the inside of the synagogue where my father was the,\nwhere my dad was involved. Anyway there were very few Jews, I think. And it was not an\norganized congregation yet, but we either didn\u2019t bump into them correctly. I mean, we were, it\nwas more of a sight-seeing trip than an effort to dig into records about the congregation sort of\nthing. Because we also had a limited amount of time. And so we got in the car. I had a car and\nwe did drive over to the section where Mother, my dad and my mom first lived, when we came\nthere. I mean, when they first, when my father first married Mother in Idar-Oberstein and then\nthey moved to Magdeburg. It was a small garden apartment kind of place, a little young couple\u2019s\nnew... I\u2019m sure at the time looked very pretty. That area had not been bombed and was still\nthere. It was just much more rundown. I mean it was like going to a building that was 50 years\nold. But the flower boxes were there and we did manage to... you know, we drove by where\nthey probably lived or near where they, in that community. Remarkable for me to see, because\nmy dad didn\u2019t have a car and he bicycled to work every day. People either walked or took bikes\nright into, in the twenties and thirties. I guess he moved to, well I was born in \u201831, so he and\nMother had been married two years. So it was this very pretty little... 1t was kind of like being\nin suburbia and taking a bike, biking into work every day.",
        "A: My dad was a, he was born in Leer, Ost-Friesland, which is in the northwestern part of Germany,\nnear the Frisian Islands. And I have a family... I was just looking and we have a pretty good\nfamily tree on his mother\u2019s side of the family, going back to the 1700s. His father was a junk\ndealer and he had nine brothers and sisters. He had a large family. And then his father,\nunfortunately, when he was very young, committed suicide.\n4",
        "A: My father\u2019s father. Leaving my mother! with this huge, rather large family when they were... I\nthink at that point he was probably like fifteen or sixteen. And so, he went, spent some years in\nan orphanage in Hanover and then went on to our equivalent of college, and to be a Jewish\nschool teacher, which when you think back about it, was quite an achievement. He had an older\nbrother, Sammy, and several sisters. He also had a younger brother, who also committed suicide.",
        "A: Yeah, named Meir, who had an affair, I think with a non-Jewish girl, and decided... which was a\nno-no in a big way back then. But he had several sisters, Jetta and Martha, both of whom\nmarried of all things, butchers in the next communities. And they came to this country. One of\nthem is named Dan de Vries. His wife\u2019s name is Martha. They\u2019ve both died in the last ten years\nand their son lives in New Jersey. And his wife is actually the woman who published the coffee\nbook for the Holocaust museum. His name is Alan de Vries. He\u2019d been married before, but\nJudy and he\u2019ve been married for many years. And then he had this other sister, Jetta Van der\nWyck, married Nathan Van der Wyck. They came to this country and had three daughters and\nshe is still living. She\u2019s ninety... She\u2019s kind of failing, but she\u2019s now 90, I guess. Then he had a\nsister Ola*, who was married and went to Argentina and then divorced her husband and came\nback to New York and lived there until she was about fifty and died. And another sister, Lina\u2019,\nwho with her husband went to Israel, early, one of the early settlers in Israel. They moved to a\nmoshav\u2018 in Israel. And they have a son, Moshe, who is my age and whom we have visited. I\nthink that\u2019s all the sisters and brothers. Two of those families came to this country and lived in\nNew York, in the New York area. And both of them were... well, Nathan was a butcher and he\ndied relatively young in this country, while the girls were still growing up. The... Dan de Vries\nlived, well he actually outlived Alan\u2019s mother, but he lived to be about in his eighties. And I\nthink Martha was right around eighty when she died. But my father, you know this large family,\nhis mother\u2019s name was Wexler? before she was married to a Rosenberg. And her father and her\nfather\u2019s father were fairly prominent rabbis in this northern part of Germany. The Wexler\nfamily, that was there. So, there was a very heavy religious influence in my father\u2019s family.\nAnd my dad was very knowledgeable in Jewish law. He knew the five books of Moses by heart.\nYou could start him in the Torah. If you go into the synagogue, the five books of Moses are in\nthe scroll and you could start my father anywhere and he could give you the rest of the passage.\nSo, he was a Jewish school teacher. When he got his degree, he went to Idar-Oberstein I think\noriginally, probably as a practice teaching. But he came there as a young bachelor. And he met,\nto be a school teacher. And... or whether a Sunday school teacher in the Jewish school. And he\nmet my mother, who was a student. She was like sixteen when he met her. I think he had\nanother, I think he had a year of school to go. And he came and he went. He was, she said a\nvery jealous man, when she was still going with some other, this Hans or whatever. And she was\n' JR intended to say that his grandfather\u2019s suicide left his grandmother with a large family.\n2 Married name: Carole Rosenberg\n3 Married name: Lina de Vries\n* Moshav (Hebrew: \u201cSettlement\u201d): Israeli cooperative community that combines privately farmed land and\ncommunal marketing.\n> Married name: Therese Wexler Rosenberg\n5\n18, I guess, quite young, when they were married. Then he took her back to Magdeburg, where\nhe got a position with the Jewish, with the synagogue and the Jewish... it wasn\u2019t the welfare\nagency, but it was like the United, not United Jewish Appeal... sort of like the Central Kentucky\nJewish Organization. He was assisting the, assisted the rabbi as a, not as the cantor, but as the\nlay leader, with services and with classes. And then he also taught classes to people, to Jews\nwho wanted to go to Israel, in Hebrew, and preparing them to go. And I think he wanted to go to\nIsrael, but my mother did not. She wanted to come to this country, if they were going to leave,\nbecause her family was here. And I think my dad really wanted to go to Israel, but they were,\nlike many others, not really, did not think this thing was going to get as bad as it did. So that\u2019s\nwhere he met her and then brought her to Magdeburg in this little garden apartment, this very\npretty, young woman. And then a year later... Mother always likes to kid that I\u2019m a... I don\u2019t\nknow if you realize that people who are born in very early October are often New Year\u2019s Eve\nbabies. They had a big party. Here I am.",
        "A: We were kosher at home. We had, I suppose in Germany a pretty, what would be called, it\nwasn\u2019t Reform, probably like the Conservative American congregation or family. We had a\nkosher household, that meant Mother had two sets of dishes. We had all, we had Sabbath. My\nfather being with the synagogue, went there regularly. And I would go with him. But I was only\neight. I mean I was really young. I went to the... Hitler, you know, in 1936, I believe, started,\nwas when Jewish children could no longer go to school with others. There was a separate Jewish\nschool system. And my father was actually a teacher, then became a teacher 1n the Jewish school\nsystem, in the Jewish school.",
        "A: Yeah, well when I went to school first in nineteen, let\u2019s see I would have been six years old,\nthat\u2019s 1937 when I started. I don\u2019t know if my father had been... I think he\u2019d actually, he must\nhave been a teacher in that school along with being at the synagogue. I think he must have, that\nmust have been his other occupation, that he was actually teaching school already, besides\nworking in the synagogue. Because when I went to the first grade, 1t was in the school where he\nwas teaching.",
        "A: In the synagogue he assisted the rabbi and was a, he taught these classes and he taught Sunday\nschool classes, taught Hebrew school.",
        "A: He was not acantor. There is, even in this country, a formal training for cantors. He could be\nthe cantor and I think sometimes he spelled the cantor. And a lot of times, Saturday nights, there\nare at the end of the Sabbath, there are services, which lay leaders lead or when the Rabbi or the\ncantor sit down, somebody else gets up and takes their place for a while. I think my father could\n6\ndo all those things, but his primary occupation was being a teacher in the school system. I\u2019m\njust, as I\u2019m... you know, you don\u2019t always think about these things until you really try to, until\nyou work them through. And so, because his reparation, some of his, I think that part of my\nmother\u2019s social security from Germany is based on his years as a teacher, not just the... not only\nthe congregational status. Though he had probably several years at Oberstein and then\nMagdeburg being a teacher. Except that there was no other place, by that time the schools were\nsegregated. Mother was not working in Germany during, she basically was a housekeeper at\nhome. And did not have anymore formal training after she finished high school. Did we get off\nto some subject on that? You started to ask me something.",
        "A: Well, as much as you can get from six to eight. Because we, Kristallnacht was November \u201838,\nso I was just seven years old. I mean I probably had as much as any child would have in those\nearly years. So you learn a lot of the basic biblical stories. You learn Hebrew to read Hebrew.\nBut when we came to this country and my father then went south, which we can get to, I think\nwe became pretty much Reform Jews. I mean because it was so difficult to be kosher unless...\nback then, unless you went to great extremes. Possible to do that in New York. So... I don\u2019t\nknow if you want to talk about how we got there?",
        "A: Or what happened in the Holocaust time, itself, that\u2019s about where...",
        "A: I have two siblings, one of them was born in Germany, my brother, Harry, who is now in Chevy\nChase, who was then...",
        "A: Maryland, right. And he\u2019s the head of the Mortality Statistics Section for the National Center for\nVitalstatistics. He\u2019s a demographer. Harry was... he\u2019s four years younger than Iam. And my\nsister, Joan, is in Raleigh, North Carolina. And she\u2019s been an architect for twenty years and then\nwent back to law school. Right now she\u2019s holding her breath to see if she passed the bar. But\nshe was an architect for the state for many years and decided she would go back to law school,\ncould be a lawyer. So, hopefully she will know this week whether she passed the bar or not. But\nmy brother, you know when you\u2019re that age in the early... the only real recollection that I have\nany problem about those early, those years together... .[ mean I have some recollection of having\nbeen at Idar-Oberstein or with some relatives. We went back with my father.",
        "A: You about to switch the tape over?\n7",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n8\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: When we, let\u2019s see, what was I talking about? My brother... you don\u2019t have many\nrecollections... I don\u2019t know how much. Do you have brothers and sisters?",
        "A: Well, do you remember when you were five and four?",
        "A: Yeah, I remember only the Kristallnacht, that he was out, that he was with my parents, that we\nwere there together. The earlier years, I can remember visiting relatives\u2014as you probably do or\nyou have images of having been\u2014in Leer and playing in my grandfather\u2019s junkyard piles with a\ncousin, for example. Or being in the house, just little things like that. But I really have very\nlittle recollection of my brother and I when we were that age. Or not all, or actually even not too\nmany... four years apart is sort of when you\u2019re always one... often you\u2019re not in the same\nschool. But Harry was, so he was only four years old. We had... oh yeah, when I mentioned\nthere was another sister. My father had another sister, named Mary\u00ae. And Mary was married\nand living in Frankfurt. And that\u2019s where, when, that\u2019s kind of, this is the Holocaust story. I\ndon\u2019t know if you want to ask some more about. I don\u2019t have much else in terms of growing up\nthat I recall, other than where we lived in Magdeburg. We lived in the house that was adjacent to\nthe synagogue, a big courtyard out front. Had just enough of an incline so that my father could\nput me on a bicycle and let me roll down the incline, which he hoped he had taught me to put on\nthe brake on, so I wouldn\u2019t smash into the other side when I was learning to ride a bicycle. The\naddress was Number 2 Schulstrasse. Zwei C, I think, apartment 2C.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Not, I mean, a fair amount, not any, I mean not like an Orthodox child would.\nAlthough I think my father pretty much took me to most services. But it was not a daily. I\ndidn\u2019t go every day, and Orthodox Jews do go everyday. I started school in nineteen... when I\nwas six. And that\u2019s always a very happy occasion. In Germany you begin school by, the big\nevent is you get a large cone, about, almost as big as you are and there\u2019s some pictures. Looks as\nbig as I did. And it\u2019s filled with nice, with goodies, so you celebrate the first day of school.\nCalled a ostertote. I think it actually... I think the school year may have begun or you begin\nschool at Easter time. So, it coincides with Easter, if I remember right. But anyway, there is, I\ndo recall that. And I recall sometime being in my father\u2019s classes and he was a very...did a lot\nof drills. He believed in teaching math with oral drill, \u201cHow much is three times three, four\ntimes four, five times five?\u201d asking kids around the school.",
        "A: He was already, he was teaching. I think that he had secured a job with the Jewish school system\nwhen he brought Mother... along with this job at the synagogue. That the two were basically\ntogether. Because he was a teacher. Lehrer. They called him Lehrer Rosenberg, teacher\nRosenberg. So he taught both my mother and me, when you think about it. He was my mother\u2019s\nSunday school and religious school teacher, and I suppose her sisters\u2019. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve got\nsome pictures and I guess her sisters might have been in his classes also. He was a very fine-\nlooking man in his youth. He was a nice looking man later on. But he did have this real store of\nknowledge. But my sister, and as I said, her family went over. And then my, the people, the\nfamily members who were alive, like the two uncles, all those people sort of left around 1936\nand were gone by Kristallnacht, as was my mother\u2019s father, who was in New York. I think my\nfather then, in... my father, we were still living in, we were in Magdeburg the night the\nKristallnacht happened. And that\u2019s what, when I said I remembered my brother, we were\nupstairs in our apartment and my mother and his mother and his brother happened to be visiting\nwith us. Actually my mother said that his mother had come for a visit and been there for several\nmonths. She was still a fairly new... well she had me, but his mother was a very strong,\nassertive woman, both religiously and with her family, and the children really worshipped her as\nfar as I... she was the epitome of a matriarch, that had kept this family going after her husband\nhad committed suicide. She was a very strong woman. And she lived, this is getting ahead a\nlittle bit, into the end, close to the end of the war in a concentration camp. Because my uncle...\nwhich is where my uncle went. But they were visiting with us. And when the Storm Troopers\ncame to the house and rousted us out that night, and they brought us into the courtyard, and\nmother I think thought, she asked somebody whether they\u2019re going to kill us, and he said they\ndidn\u2019t know. And then they...",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. My... she told me that. She didn\u2019t know whether we were going to live or\nnot, live or die. We were all asleep, and they just broke into the apartment and brought\neverybody in the courtyard. And then my... then they bombed, dynamited the Temple, and they\nbrought all the religious scrolls and all the books out into the courtyard and burned them. That\u2019s\nwhat I can remember very vividly, just seeing all that stuff burn up. And then eventually... they\ndidn\u2019t blow the building up. They went in, the next morning when we went in, the upstairs was\nsort of caved in, the upstairs back where the women would sit upstairs. That had been detached\nfrom the walls. They hadn\u2019t totally destroyed the synagogue, but it was quite a mess. But all the\nbooks had been burned. And then somewhere, she said, two or three in the morning they said,\n\u201cGo back into your house.\u201d And the house, things were pretty well upside-down, but it was, they\njust smashed a lot of stuff. And we went back to bed. And then the next morning, early on,\nabout, when it was early, they came back and the military, the Nazis came and arrested my father\nand his brother. Now, I had always... I was just reading some stuff. I always had this\nbackwards, because I thought that my father had... it was interesting, because they arrested Dad\nand they took off. And I don\u2019t have a good recollection of them arresting his brother. Whether\nhis brother and his mother left. Because I know what happened was when they came upstairs,\nthey arrested, they asked for my father and they arrested him. And then my mother asked me if\nshe could, asked the soldier\u2014he had already gone out the door\u2014whether she... when he was\nstanding there, she asked whether she could give him something, make a sandwich for him. And\n10\nthe guy said, \u201cYes, go ahead and do that.\u201d So, she made a sandwich and she asked me to run\nafter them and give my father... and he was, they were already down the street on the sidewalk\nwith my dad in the middle. And I went running after him and gave him the sandwich. And I\ndon\u2019t remember at all that his brother was anywhere around. My mother may know, whether he\ntook his mother back to somewhere else, because he was also arrested and they joined up in the\nconcentration camp. It\u2019s just a little, something I\u2019m not sure of right now. But my mother... I\njust, we were in our kitchen, I think I was on the mattress on the floor, because the beds had been\ntorn up when they came back for Daddy. What had happened, which I thought happened\nafterwards. My father, though, was in the concentration camp about eleven days. They took him\nto Buchenwald, he and his brother. The town we grew up in, Magdeburg, this very large town...\napparently the political establishment was not sympathetic to Hitler. Or a lot of, there were at\nleast a fair number of people in power. And so, with their help, they were able to get my father\nout. And he was ordered to get out of the country within thirty days. He was able to come\nhome. And I have a copy\u2014although I didn\u2019t have it, I mean it\u2019s at home, I recently had it out for\nsome other reason\u2014of the official papers, sending him out, getting him out of the concentration\ncamp. My mother took me to Frankfurt, she said, to my father\u2019s sister. The one whose name is\nMary, that I mentioned a while ago, and my brother. Well, I guess no, she said she took me to\nFrankfurt and that she stayed with friends, not by herself. Different people every night for\nseveral days during that interim. When my father and his brother were released from\nconcentration camp... it must have been at the same time, because I can remember them getting,\ncoming to this apartment. There was a young, my father\u2019s sister had a little boy, had a boy\nnamed Bubi, who was my age. And we played together. And he was the one I played with when\nwe went to see my grandfather at the junk shop. We knew each other. We were just little seven-\nand eight-year-old kids running around together. But I remember being in Frankfurt when my\nfather and his brother came and that they were totally bald. They\u2019d had their heads shaved,\nwhich my father, at that time, had a lot of hair. So it was dramatic to see them, even as a very\nyoung child. And we then, I think Sammy took his mother probably back to Leer and we went\nto...",
        "A: Right. He was taller than my... was a very outspoken fellow, very active in the Jewish youth\nmovement. Was in his thirties. And he was running the junk, sort of took over the business. He\nwas the oldest son, the oldest one of the children.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think they rounded up most of... they actually, before they... my father they came for the next\nday. And I think they took off... they arrested hundreds, maybe thousands of Jewish men. And\nit was not yet, I don\u2019t think they were the only ones to get out. I mean, they had help getting out\nof the concentration camp, but I think they had not set on this course yet of genocide. I mean, I\n11\nremember there was this Madagascar Plan about sending the Jews to the Madagascar and getting\nrid of them and basically eliminating them, before they figured out this Final Solution that they\nwere going to kill everybody. It may have been in somebody\u2019s mind. But wait a minute, how\ndid I get on to that? You asked me...?",
        "A: I think there were a lot of, I mean it was a large congregation. Now the other, that was uh... that\ndiary that I was telling you about when we went back to Magdeburg and they had the exhibit of\nall the Jewish artifacts? There was an open diary by, the rabbi\u2019s name was Wilde, WI LD E,\nProfessor Wilde. He was a PhD. It was a large congregation. He had a very prominent role in\nthe community, I think. He started this diary, saying \u201cThere we were. We had all been arrested\nby the police, a banker and a baker and a rabbi and a Rosenberg. And here we were sitting in the\npolice station, all expecting to go home that night.\u201d And I mean, all I could read... it was ina\nglass case, so it just went that far. He ended up going to England. He also got out safely, but he\nwas even older than my father. I don\u2019t know what, I think he just lived out his life in England, in\nLondon somewhere. So, there were a lot of people arrested after Kristallnacht. And how many\nof them... there was a family, there was actually a family living upstairs above us in the\nsynagogue, in this building, like it was just an apartment building, there may have been some\noffices downstairs, but it was perpendicular to the Temple itself, and then there was this\ncourtyard. There was another family upstairs that was Jewish and they were from Poland. And\nthey came and arrested them about, several weeks earlier. And I think that Hitler, that they were\narresting Jews from Poland and shipping them out. I think that was sort of the event probably,\nalthough I\u2019ll never know, you know, that got my father to thinking it was time to get out. And he\nhad thirty days to get out of the country and I always, what I\u2019m going to tell you now 1s I always\nthought he did that after he got out of the concentration camp. But I was reading some notes my\nwife had made, which I suspect happened right after they arrested the Poles, that he said, \u201cWell\nhow am I going to get out of this country? Or how can we do it at this late date?\u201d And he was\ntold to go to the American Consulate and to get a visa and to go to Hamburg. Why don\u2019t I just\nget those notes? I was just looking at them, and I\u2019ll read them. It made a little bit of sense, in\nthat it also had and interest... these were actually from some notes that Jean made when we were\non a plane with my mother a few years ago. And let\u2019s see... yeah, Daddy then, said Opa was\nsafe... he was, let\u2019s see, a teacher in synagogue housing. They, if I have this right, one of the\nreasons Sammy and his mother were there is that they realized that it was getting to be a\ndangerous time and they might have to try to still get out of the country. And so mother said she\nthought that was why their stay was being extended, that they had started realizing they were\ngoing to try to get to the United States. And she said he was on a... they were taking a walk with\nthe family when they ran into an acquaintance, who said to them that if they were going to get\nout it was necessary to go to the U.S. Consulate in Berlin. And my father asked him how to do\nthat and he said, \u201cYou should go to Hamburg in the morning and get in line and book four\npassages to this country. Then when you get those passages, you need to go to Berlin to the\nConsulate to let them know you\u2019ve got your tickets.\u201d\u201d So my father, she said, cashed in his life\ninsurance policy and bought the tickets and got the papers together to get a visa to come to the\nUnited States. He sent the visa application, he said, by registered mail to Berlin. Then he went\nto Berlin and stayed there with his sister Ola and her husband, who was... remember her\nhusband was not Jewish, which was another very... they\u2019re the ones who went to Argentina. So,\n12\nhe went there. So he went there, he went on to the office, but they did not find his papers. He\nshowed them the registered mail stub, which was copied and he was told that he would then get\nthe confirmation of the fact that he would be approved to go to this country. He got a letter,\neventually he got a letter with the number on a piece of paper, which he kept on his person. And\nit said, he gave that piece of paper to Sammy, his brother, when the Gestapo picked him up after\nKristallnacht and took him to the concentration camp. Sammy in turn gave it to his mother, who\ntook me and went to Mary in Frankfurt. So his mother then... what isn\u2019t clear to me, is what\nhappened to Sammy. I suppose they must have arrested him after my father, but I just didn\u2019t pay\nany attention to him because I just wasn\u2019t focused. Because they took him off. Because she\nsaid, it was actually his mother, who took me off to... Mom said, you know, that she took Harry,\nwho was only four at the time and waited around and went from house, lived with different\nfriends in the community while they were waiting for my father. But he had this little\nregistration number, which as you know, probably from other stories, people were selling their\nsouls and lives for, because they were, it was the quota system that determined whether you were\ngoing to make it to this country or not. And we were, we then went, during this thirty-day period\nthey got all their belongings together and filled it in one of these things they call...what\u2019s the\nname of this thing? Where you put everything in a big box that\u2019s going to go to the other\ncountry. And they packed up all their furniture and it was sent to Rotterdam. And they made\ntheir way to Rotterdam, Holland, where we were in this sort of an internment camp. It was\nactually... I think we went on the train and it was a large, overnight hostelry for people who\nwould otherwise have taken, say, the Holland America Line ship. The boat to this country on a\nnormal, as a tourist trip.",
        "A: I want to believe that I remember the signs on the, some of the signs that said No Jews Allowed,\nwhich you know popped up on stores. And we... the family... but I don\u2019t remember, as a six or\nseven year old having any, you know you just learn what the rules are. Don\u2019t go into this store\nor you stay with your parents or you go to school. I don\u2019t remember children other than my\ncousin. So I don\u2019t know that I ever was afraid. And I don\u2019t think my parents ever gave me any\nreason to be afraid. I mean we lived a very normal life. And I didn\u2019t know, I do remember that\nwe, I played with the kids of that Polish family. They had two children. I think their name\nmight have been Finkelsteiner. They had two children and I remember them. But I don\u2019t... and\nso they were gone. I don\u2019t remember, you know, that we were living in fear, or... until these\nStorm Troopers showed up at the house that I had any conscious feeling about even knowing that\nthings were bad. As I say, in our town there was not a lot of sympathy for him.",
        "A: I do remember the fire. I mean I do remember going, I do remember, probably because it was so\nvivid. And when I told this story before or talked about it, that it stays a little bit in front of your\nmind, so it\u2019s probably hard to separate. But I have this very strong recollection about this fire in\n13\nthe courtyard. And my father being arrested and running after him. And I just... so those are\nthe, I guess, the vignettes that I remember. I remember them coming to the apartment and my\nmother giving me the sandwich. And I remember that one of them, this fellow who was in\nuniform, who said that she could go ahead and make a sandwich, seemed to be very friendly, or\nwas a very, he said okay and he wasn\u2019t... they didn\u2019t beat any of us, I mean, we... I\u2019m sure the\nadults were very fearful, because they were forced out there. I was just a little kid and everybody\nsaid, \u201cGo outside in the yard.\u201d I mean as I said, my mother certainly was very afraid and they\ndidn\u2019t know what they were going to do. And they did it all over Germany. She told me that,\nMom said at one point that they had heard that was going to happen that night, something like\nthat, that people, that this was... if I, you might know this. I think that they had an excuse for\ndoing it, some official, some German official had been killed and this was an act of retribution.\nIt was the way they got at it. And so, I don\u2019t know that word had spread that this was the night\nthat they said we\u2019re going to synagogues and arrest... blow them up and arrest everybody. But\nthey just, they knew something was going to happen. But they went to bed. They didn\u2019t know\nwhat. I don\u2019t know whether anybody was awake, because we were rousted out.",
        "A: No. I really don\u2019t have any, any recollection. And all I remember is that I do remember a little\nbit of going to Frankfurt, only because somehow at one point, I remember we were eight years\nold, and my cousin and I were under the table, playing under the table and seeing the knees of all\nthese adults sitting around. I mean, it\u2019s just sort of a goofy thing, but they were also killed. I\nmean almost everybody, this family and this cousin were gassed. Sammy and his mother, we\nstayed... well you wanted to go ahead about Germany. When we get into Holland, [Pll tell you\nwhat I remember about Sammy and his mother. But that\u2019s really about all I remember of those\ndays in Germany. It\u2019s not a... I remember going sometime, vaguely, going back to Idar-\nOberstein as a kid, but not much. I was just too young.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well I said my dad, I think, wanted to go and my mother did not. She wanted to go to America.\nIf they were going to leave, she wanted to go to this country, where her family lived. But his\nsister had gone to Israel and I think he... Lina and her husband, whose name was Ivan Van der\nWyck, another Van der Wyck... de Vries. I\u2019m sorry de Vries. And I just actually had sent a\nlittle note to my cousin, when we were... I visited them when I was in the Air Force first, in\n1956, when I was still single and was stationed in England and went to Israel. I stayed with them\nand toured the country. And then when Jean was pregnant with our Michael, we went over. And\nso, we\u2019ve had some connection over the years. And they have a son, Moshe, and his wife, Nurit,\nhave a son, who came to this country and was married a few years ago. And my dad and mom\n14\ndid go to Israel afterwards. In fact Sammy\u2019s widow... Sammy got married in the concentration\ncamp, which we will... can get to or just say, and his wife...",
        "A: Well, he went, I think he and his mother... I mean, we got out. We went to Holland and they did\nnot. Whether he went back to Leer, I\u2019Il have to ask my mom whether... where they went.\nWhether they went to Holland or back to Leer. Because they went to... I think they did\neventually get to Holland and he was supposed to leave on the next boat. I don\u2019t think he was in\nthe camp with us. [ll have to... I might just see where Sammy went, just a minute. Okay, my\nfather had a sister in Frankfurt, was named Elly\u2019. The sister in Rotterdam was named Mary. She\nwas married to a stock broker named Herman Mescher, who spoke a number of languages. They\nhad something like five children. And we would be able to visit with them...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n7 Elly de Levie\n15\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: I think that it was simply a train trip from Germany to Holland. And they had arranged, it was a\nlegal, they had the papers. They had to be out by thirty days and they had packed everything up,\nexcept a few little, except their day-to-day living clothes and put everything in this big lift is\nwhat they called them, I think. And they expected eventually to send that to this country. As it\nwas, it went to Holland and sat there while they were in the internment camp. And...",
        "A: No, I think it was just, my recollection is it was just a train trip and that he had his passport or the\nproper papers to go to Holland. And had been directed to be out of the country in thirty days\nfrom the time he was out of the concentration camp. That\u2019s why I had originally thought he\nwent... that\u2019s when he... I had always remembered that he went to Berlin or that he stood in line\nin Hamburg and in Berlin. This little thing I had read from my wife\u2019s notes, that mother had\nrecalled the other part of it, that he, I think he ended up standing in line for at least a day in\nBerlin at the Consulate to get this number, which was so precious, which ended up being the key\nto allowing us to get out of Holland and coming to this country. But the train, I don\u2019t think there\nwas anything particularly noteworthy about the trip to Holland. They went to Holland. Mother,\nI think, did a lot of the arranging of that while my father was in the concentration camp. Or\nfriends of hers helped her do that, with... and when he got out... I mean, they knew they were\ngoing to have to leave. And they were able to keep this number.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. I mean they must have... I think that the immigration authorities, the Jewish\nwelfare agencies... I mean they had their... for one thing, he had his tickets. He had purchased\nthe tickets to come to this country, so it was the logical place to go. It was also a place full of\nimmigrants. I don\u2019t know if they put people there who did not have their papers in order or had\nbooked their passage. People had their passages, but they couldn\u2019t leave until they had an\napproval from the authorities in the United States. You had to...you know, they had a quota.\nSo, that was the other part of the... the problem was getting a sponsor in this country.",
        "A: Yeah, as far as I know. I mean, whether they were waiting... they were also taking boats to other\nparts of the world, I\u2019m not sure. But that\u2019s what they were waiting to do, was to leave on the\nboat. And I\u2019m not, don\u2019t conscious, have no real recollection of people going ahead of us. We\nended up being there for a year. And, large building like a hotel, and on each floor the\nfurnishings and the layout sort of was equivalent to the class of the boat that you would be going\non. So if you were a first-class passenger you\u2019d have a little... each of these floors, as I\nremember them, had a series of compartments where people would stay, normally for a day or\ntwo before leaving on the boat. So, the first-class cabins would have a little fancier\n16\ncompartment. I mean these compartments weren\u2019t very big. They were like twelve by twelve, at\nleast, small. And then we had, the one that my family had was a very austere, it was, I don\u2019t\nknow if it was equivalent to Daddy\u2019s class, but it was sort of, it was just a very small enclosure\nwith two double beds, with bunk beds. And my brother and I were on an upper and lower and\nmy mom and dad were across from us on an upper and lower and there wasn\u2019t anything else, that\nI can remember, other than maybe a little thing, cabinet to put your clothes in. And then people\ncongregated in other parts of that facility. They had a library, reading room. They had a large\ncafeteria or a large dining room. Huge dining room, where everyone ate at the same, together. I\nalways tell people I remember the sign on the wall said, in five languages, \u201cDon\u2019t spit on the\nfloor.\u201d That was the sign. They had this huge sign. Don\u2019t spit on the floor. My father, so it was\npretty, you know, it wasn\u2019t a great living conditions. But my father\u2019s sister and her husband and\ntheir children lived in Rotterdam. They were Dutch residents. I don\u2019t know where she met him.\nHis name was Herman. I think I mentioned that. And he was a stock broker and they were fairly\nwell-to-do and we could go to see them or they could come to see us. I mean we weren\u2019t, it\nwasn\u2019t any concentration camp. It was just, I think that it was an internment camp and you could\ngo away, go out on weekends. But no one had any vehicles, and unless you had a lot of money,\nwhich they had hardly any money, you basically stayed where you were.",
        "A: I think it was all, I mean they had a little, they didn\u2019t... now my father... I don\u2019t recall that\nanybody had to work. I can ask Mom. I don\u2019t think so. I mean I think it was run by the Jewish\nWelfare Agency.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean I think there was a relationship there. Maybe it was a relationship to the Holland-\nAmerica Line. It might have been that it was, someone or the immigration authorities people. I\ndon\u2019t recall, but I can ask. I don\u2019t think that Mother worked in the kitchen, for example. It\nwould be nice to know. We\u2019ve never talked very much about that. But my father decided to\norganize a school for the children in the camp and he did that.",
        "A: On his own, yeah. He said, I want to do that for the kids. And so he started a school and gave\ninstruction for a year, while we were there. We had to, he or the people, his sisters who were\nhere and some others set about trying to find a sponsor in this country. And they ultimately\nfound someone who was a fairly well-to-do person, \u2018cause none of his family had any money to\nspeak of and they couldn\u2019t vouch for... they were not citizens, so they couldn\u2019t vouch for him.\nSo during that year they found a sponsor for him, a fellow who was either an architect or a\nbuilder in New York, who my father went to see after we got here and said thank you, and that\nwas the last contact, except that in later years, my brother has met the son of that person, who\nlives in Washington, also.\n17",
        "A: I think his name is Meyer, Andrew Meyer. Does that ring a bell?",
        "A: Oh, oh. No, but it turns out... his name is Meyer and it turns out that, that...that his father, that\nthis Meyer, who was our sponsor, that his family and our family come together in the seventeen\nhundreds with a family connection named Budenweiser, which led me to think they actually\nidentified someone who was very distantly related. There are some Meyers in our family. And\nmy brother ultimately figured out and I think that David, this fellow, Meyer, the son, that there\nwas a family connection, a couple of hundred years back. So there is a relationship. Probably\nsomebody said, why don\u2019t you go see so-and-so, we don\u2019t have very much to do with him, but\nmaybe he\u2019d sponsor your father. That someone contacted him, Hans Meyer. They knew that he\nwas there. He was well-off, but very distant family. And he agreed to sponsor my family.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know why we were there a year. I think part of it, no we were not... I think part of it was\nthat we were not very high up on the list. That there were others in front of us by a long way. In\nfact my father was, we went in that camp probably in... Kristallnacht was November and Dad\nwas there until the end of November, and then December. We probably went to Holland in\nDecember-January. And we came over on the boat in February 1940. That was just before the\nwar broke out with Holland. In fact, we were either on the last boat or the next to last boat. And\nmy dad had already been told that he was going to be the school teacher either in Theresienstadt\nor in the camp that Anne Frank was sent to, the first, the concentration camp.",
        "A: Westerbork, right. He was going to be the teacher. They wanted him to start that school. And\nhe said, I\u2019m... want to go to America. And he then, there was a fellow... that\u2019s in these notes as\nwell, \u2018cause I keep forgetting the name. He said that as time was growing short, he went to the\nJewish Immigration Agency to find out whether, the hold-up. Because he was not near the top.\nAnd when he got there, he met a fellow named Doctor Moses, who was one of the interview,\ncommittee interviewing people. And he and Doctor Moses... in Germany, he had helped Doctor\nMoses solicit money for Israel. And Moses recognized my father. And my dad... and then he\narranged for us to be on one of the next boats. So, it was a little \u201cgood old boy\u201d. And, but I\nmean we had been there a year. I think there were a lot of those stories that also... that 1t was a\nnumbering system from the top to the bottom, but that if you paid someone, or you always heard\nof, there were probably people moving up that had some influence with whoever. And so, my\nfather said, managed to get this connection or lucked into this connection. Whether he was\nmoved up or he would have been on that boat, I don\u2019t know. But because they were apparently,\nwhat they were doing was interviewing family... they had a committee on which this Doctor\nMoses sat, and he... they determined who was going to go. Because there were probably all\nsorts of priorities. Are they elderly? Do they have... how do you... we\u2019ve got a whole building\nof people who need to go to the United States and the boats only hold so many and somebody\n18\ncan go and somebody can\u2019t. This is my number. And we have a lot of little children. So I think\nhe was able to, that\u2019s what happened. Whether he pulled some strings or whether he just was in\nthe normal course of things and said, you can go. But whatever it was, that\u2019s how we got here.\nSo his number, he still had that little piece of paper and they\u2019d found a sponsor. And so we were\non that last boat, I suspect.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s for sure. Yeah, that\u2019s for sure, we would not have gotten... no there wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen any other way. And I don\u2019t think there was any chance of going anywhere else. My uncle\nand his mother, again, I\u2019m not sure why I don\u2019t remember that they are there. But apparently\nthey were on another boat. They came, they were in fact on a boat that was then turned... I think\nthat you go through England. I have some recollection as a young boy, you know, you\u2019re\nplaying on the boat. People, everybody\u2019s always looking for mines. There were all sorts of\nmines floating out in the English Channel, because the war was about to start. And there was a\nroute that you could make and we went. And I remember looking for the mines or looking and\npeople say, there\u2019s something out there. I believe they were in fact on a boat and that the boat\nwas turned around and they got off. Now, whether they were in this same camp or somewhere\nelse, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know why I would not have remembered them being there, but I\u2019 Il\nhave to ask. I\u2019m just not sure.",
        "A: No, what happened was they went from there to Theresienstadt. You have the right word for\nHolland, it was Westerbork. I always forget that. Theresienstadt. And they were there. My\nuncle Sammy apparently was in charge of the leather-working shop. They made boots and\nrepaired leather stuff. And they were there into, they were there in 1944. And apparently my\nuncle became a little outspoken. The war was turning and they knew that. And he made some\nuntoward remarks about the Nazis, about these shoes are too good for them or something. And\nsomeone told on him and he was sent to Auschwitz. And he was in the line to go, to be\nexterminated and he ran to the electrified fence and they shot him. We heard that from, I think,\nhis wife. During those four years, three years that he and his mother were in Theresienstadt, he\nmet his wife and they were married. And when I was with mom last weekend, we have pictures\nof their wedding, of them getting married on the day they got married. I mean of their wedding\nor they\u2019re being married. She wasn\u2019t wearing... she was an adult. They were in their thirties.\nHe was probably born in 1900, so he was forty years old. They were both forty. She was a\nlovely person. And they were married. You know they all had coat... he had a coat and a tie on.\nAnd some of their friends are around them in a picture. This was the end of *44. And his,\nDaddy\u2019s mother died, I think, must have died right after he was moved to Auschwitz. I looked it\nup, I mean it\u2019s like a couple, a few months apart. She was, hadn\u2019t been doing well, but she was\nborn in the eighteen... I mean she was probably in her seventies, I think. I\u2019ve got that in the\nother room. We looked up the book, the Gedenk\u00ae book where she\u2019s listed. But she had survived\ninto the late forties and he, with, being with her son. And so, she was there when he got married,\nwhich was nice. And... but then when they moved him to Auschwitz, she died. And then we...\n\u00ae Gedenk bukh: memorial book (Yiddish)\n19\nhis widow lived, and went to Israel. And Jean and I visited her in Israel. And that\u2019s where this\nsort of, I mean that\u2019s what she was told happened to Sammy. She knew that he had been taken.",
        "A: Well, it was just he brought these kids together of varying ages around a big table. It was just a\nlittle sectioned-away room, for I don\u2019t know how many hours. And you\u2019d do your math tables,\nand he\u2019d tell you some stories. He was just teaching. My father had a habit when he, in\nGermany I always remember that when he was teaching Bible stories, he would always tell you\nthree-fourths of the story and leave the ending for the next week, so that you were anxious to\nfind out what was coming. I don\u2019t really remember very much about school, except where it\nwas, and I remember there was, I was, one of the people who was there had a violin that he\nplayed and gave violin lessons. And I think my parents thought that would be a good idea. So\nhe loaned me the violin for a lesson, but I remember that I was not very good. And he got his\nviolin back. I think he thought it was going to... might be untuned or leaving it with an eight-\nyear-old was not the right thing to do. And I don\u2019t really remember very much about the camp.\nI remember a little bit about the library and where the books were. And the older people would\nsit down. They had a radio.",
        "A: There were probably forty or fifty with us. And whether he did it in shifts or not, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: Well there were no, yeah, I mean you had communal bathrooms on each floor, because there\nwere no... I don\u2019t know if the first-class facilities had private baths. This room where we were\nthey had a little sink, I think, with running water, but they didn\u2019t... the bathroom as such was\ndown the hall. It was pretty spartan. I mean it wasn\u2019t terrible because it wasn\u2019t... you weren\u2019t\nunder a guard. But it was, it was very plain. And then when they found, when they got ready to\nleave, they learned that they could not... there was a limit on what they could take out. It was\nlike twenty-five or fifty dollars. And so all the stuff that they were going to take... my mother\nreally doesn\u2019t remember what happened to it. It stayed. She was able to bring over some linens,\nsome crystal, which she still has, and some mementos, several boxes of stuff, things that they\ncould pack up. But no furniture, which they had brought from Germany and things like that.\nThey just either sold them for a very, for a song...",
        "A: I think he did, yeah. German and perhaps some Hebrew. Of course, I don\u2019t know why anybody\nwould have just spoken...But it would have been... I don\u2019t know that he knew any Dutch. When\nhe came to this country really the only other language that he knew was German. He knew some\nbroken English that he had learned. Mother didn\u2019t know any English. I remember when we\nwere on the boat, I remember, I told people I saw the Wizard of Oz was playing. Was the first\n20\nAmerican color movie, you know, technicolor movie, sound, Judy Garland. I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand the English, but I saw the... they showed the Wizard of Oz on the boat. I\u2019m sure it\nwas a nice boat trip. I mean for us, that was kind of fun, just a little kid running all over the\nplace.",
        "A: They were... they didn\u2019t get out. They were also killed. I don\u2019t know if they went to\nWesterbork. I tried to, Mother and I looked for his name in that book. We were in, when we\nwere in Magdeburg... after we went to Magdeburg on that trip I was telling you about, we went\nto Berlin for sightseeing and to look around, and we found a Jewish library there in connection\nwith the synagogue or with the agency and they had one of these Gedenk Books where all the\nHolocaust victims were listed alphabetically. So, that\u2019s where I saw my uncle and my mother. I\nlooked for some of...",
        "A: My grandmother. And I don\u2019t remember that I... I think we looked for some of the others and\ncouldn\u2019t find them. Hermann... they were, all of that family was killed, the one in Rotterdam.\nThe family in Frankfurt was killed. The sister that was living actually in Berlin, went to\nArgentina and then up here. And as I say, mother\u2019s, I mean my father\u2019s mother, because my\nmother\u2019s family had come, already come to this country. When we came to the United States,\nthey were there to greet us. Her two sisters, one of whom I think... well neither of them were\nmarried at that point. But they were all living on, with my grand, with mother\u2019s parents.\nMother\u2019s parents had come over and my grandfather who owned a butcher shop was working as\na butcher in a large restaurant in New York. And he had gotten a job and was maintaining the\nfamily.",
        "A: No, he, no. And it was not a... it was called, I think the restaurant was called Zimmerman\u2019s\nHungaria. I think it was a Hungarian restaurant. I think he could be, I mean he knew what there\nwas to know, but he wasn\u2019t a kosher butcher in Germany. Then he went, they went to the\nsynagogue, this was 803 West 180\" Street, right across from the George Washington Bridge.\nBig neighborhood of German immigrants in those days. It\u2019s changed a lot. A lot of Spanish-\nspeaking people living there now, along with a few of the... some have actually... well, I was\nwith Mother... one of her friends, who lived downstairs, is still in that same building, called her\nto wish her a happy birthday. At 803 180\" Street. Her sisters came to the boat and we moved in\nwith them initially. Just squeezing into an apartment. It was a fairly good-sized apartment. But\nwe lived with them. And at that time, there was not a very good, for some reason, there was no\none that really told my dad what he ought to do is get his teaching degree for this country and\nlearn to speak English and to go on with what he was doing. Or if they told him, he didn\u2019t think\nhe could quickly take care of his family. And there was very little work in New York. Most of\nthe jobs were cleaning for women or people were doing stuff at home. There was an enormous,\nwhat do you call it, craft kind of stuff, they give you... my mother and her sisters would sit\naround sewing slippers together, the bottoms and tops of bedroom slippers, piecework, to make\n21\nmoney. Mom was actually a maid. She\u2019d go out and was cleaning apartments, cleaning houses,\ndoing a little bit of nannies. My father after a very short time, heard that there were jobs in the\nSouth and he went to Spartanburg, South Carolina and started sweeping floors in a textile mill,\nso he could take care of his family. So he went to Spartanburg and got a job, through... I mean\nhe got a job, he knew where he was going. Somebody had said, contact this man when you get\nthere. So, it was a very menial job initially and then he... he swept floors and he did manual\nstuff and pretty quickly learned how to... he became a shift manager at one point and he brought\nus, he had saved his money and got a small apartment, and about six months later we moved to\nSpartanburg, South Carolina.",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I mean the boat, just that it was a boat trip and we were... it was a big ship. And a little\nkid could run all over the boat. And I remember the Wizard of Oz.",
        "A: We came through New York. We did not, for some reason, go to Ellis Island. I\u2019m not sure,\nbecause I think... because our family came to meet us and we went on. Recently I asked my\nmom if we went to Ellis Island, \u2018cause I didn\u2019t remember that, us doing that. And I think my\nfather was... we all went off and the name change must have actually taken place while he\nwasn\u2019t around. Because he might have... even when the paper stuff was done, he had already\ngone to Spartanburg. It said Hans is no longer Hans. Your son\u2019s name is John. But the flags\nwere out when we came. We landed on February 22\"! when we passed the Statue of Liberty.\nAnd so we thought this is really nice, they\u2019ve got all the flags out for us, but it was Washington\u2019s\nbirthday. So I mean, and I remember my aunt giving me a quarter and telling me that was a lot\nof money and I should hang on to it, very, very carefully.",
        "A: No. I mean I think you\u2019re kind of, you\u2019re in wonderment. I mean all of sudden you take a boat\ntrip and there\u2019s the Statue of Liberty and then you come up with your family. You\u2019re glad to see\nyour family, because you\u2019ve known them. It\u2019s been a few years since... they had been over\nsince \u201836, I think, \u201837. So they were, let\u2019s see, Mother was born in 1908 and she\u2019s the oldest. So\nIrma and Ruth\u2019 were just eighty, so they were, I think they were born, that would make it about\n1920. So they were in their early twenties when we met them. I think Ruth became, went\nthrough dental hygiene school and I don\u2019t know that Irma was just working in various places.\nThey both met their husbands in the next few years. One of, Irma\u2019s husband was Jewish and\nthen they both went into the service, I think. John and Walter. Walter was a baker and the...\nJohn was a salesman. And I went... they enrolled me in a school called P.S. 132 and they put\nme in a class with kids from other countries. All the early...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n? Irma Haas and Ruth Neumeyer\n22\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: ...the children from other countries and I don\u2019t know how one teacher handled them. I think\nthey taught you some basic English.",
        "A: I spoke no English. You pick it up pretty quickly on the street playing with other kids. And I\nstayed in that room. It\u2019s funny, because now, you know, they have the dress code that\u2019s going\non. At least one day, on Thursdays you had to wear red, white and blue. It was red, white and\nblue day. And that was all new to me. But they had some codes. But I think I did pretty well\nand adjusted with these other kids. I walked to the school, it was probably three-quarters of a\nmile, every day, from where we lived to the school. And after, I remember after maybe a couple\nof months, I was sort of mainstreamed into another, into the regular... what would that have\nbeen, probably the third grade, second or third grade and I was there. And then we moved to\nSpartanburg. My father had rented a small walk-up, in a poor... 1t was not a very well-to-do\nneighborhood. But a little apartment that he could afford. Actually he had saved enough money,\nhe said, to have bought a car, but they decided to buy furniture or something. But he worked in\nthe shirt factory doing fairly menial work initially, as I said. Then unfortunately after a few\nmonths, he had an... he fell off a ladder, which was interesting, because in this apartment where\nwe lived, we had just a couple of rooms, two or three rooms. My mother did the laundry on a\npotbellied stove. So, she had relied on him to always pick up this big vat of clothes and laundry\nand put it on. We had this little wood burning stove and burned corn cobs and I suppose coal.\nAnd she\u2019d boil the clothes and wash them the old-fashioned way. And when he broke his foot,\nhe couldn\u2019t do that. As a result of that, he went downtown and we had the first Bendix automatic\nwasher. This little immigrant family in Spartanburg, South Carolina had one of the very first\nautomatic washing machines in 1941. Neighbors would come in to look at it and see the clothes\nspinning round and round and round. And Daddy bought it on time, you know, you could buy...\nI mean he was making not a lot of money. But we used that washing machine for many years.\nUntil even when we went to Gastonia, it just kept on working. It was called, I remember it was a\nBendix. But my father also then, 1t was very interesting in our little apartment, \u2018cause he... there\nwas no rabbi in Spartanburg and so he... I don\u2019t know if they ever had one before the war,\nwhether they just got... I mean the Jewish community learned right away about his vast\nknowledge of Jewish culture and religion and that he could actually officiate at a service. And so\nhe began officiating in Spartanburg and started writing sermons in English. And did the whole\nthing, I mean he was quite remarkable. And as a result of that, the Jewish soldiers... there was a\nmilitary base in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Camp Croft. And so the soldiers, the Jewish\nsoldiers who would sometimes come to the synagogue and see Daddy, would come to our little,\npoor apartment on weekends. And on the porch... and we have little pictures with a Brownie,\nblack and white that were taken of all these soldiers sitting out on the porch or out front on a\nSaturday afternoon, because it was a place to go. Because they didn\u2019t know anybody. They\nwere away from home. It was just kind of ironic, right, that you\u2019ve got... and I\u2019m sure the rest\nof the Jewish community was also very fond of them, but they came to Mom and Dad because\nthey were new in the community and very warm. I don\u2019t know whether they realized that this\nimmigrant family had come to Spartanburg, South Carolina and were totally in a new\nenvironment. I mean it\u2019s always been, I\u2019ve always thought it\u2019s been very remarkable when you\n23\nthink about it. I mean, they didn\u2019t stay in New York, where people spoke German. I mean my\nmother and her sisters sort of still speak German. She has an accent. But they came South and\nhere\u2019s my dad, writing sermons and officiating when he\u2019s not in his fairly menial job at the\nfactory. Then somehow the congregation in Gastonia, North Carolina, which was about seventy-\nfive miles away, I think, also had no rabbi. And he got to Gastonia, because there was a family\nnamed Heilbronn, who were in Magdeburg, who were... that they knew in Germany. And that\nfamily, the Heilbronns, had owned a textile mill. They were very well off. And they had\nbrought their whole, their manufacturing facility over and they were living near Gastonia. So, I\nthink they contacted Dad to see if he couldn\u2019t start helping them with services. And so my dad\nstarted commuting between Spartanburg and Gastonia and officiating at services in Gastonia.\nAnd so after a couple of years, Daddy in the shirt factory, let\u2019s see, in Spartanburg the place he\nworked was called, yeah... Dixie Shirt Factory is the mill where he went to work. He started\nmoving up a little bit and became a shift manager and a foreman. And learned essentially how,\nthe textile knitting business, totally something he\u2019d never done in his life. Never knew anything\nabout it. And became very good at it. And so, several years later, the family in Gastonia asked\nDad or Mr. Heilbronn asked him if he wouldn\u2019t come to work for him as a, I think as a shift\nmanager. And then he also, when he got to Gastonia... and he invented, made some innovations\non the machinery in their dye house. But after Spartanburg... so we lived in Spartanburg about\nthree years. And it was, you know, people were, of course, very nice to us, but... and I started\nreally a public school in Spartanburg, both my brother... and my brother, let\u2019s see, I was then, I\nwould have been, let\u2019s see in 1940 I would have been nine. So we were in, I was like in the\nfourth, fifth and sixth grade. And I was kind of a novelty, obviously, immigrant son. And\npeople would ask questions about how it was on the boat. So, the classrooms would start\nscheduling me around as a speaker to other schools, because they had this little ten-year-old, who\ncould talk about life in Germany and coming over on a boat and being Jewish.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I did. I mean, I essentially told, I think, told much of this story from the perspective of\na ten-year-old. If somebody had taped it, I\u2019m sure there were more details that I don\u2019t even\nremember, but it was, you know, it was sort of novel having somebody... there was nobody else\nthere. And I was still probably speaking, well in Spartanburg certainly, spoke broken English. I\nalways remember when the first report card came out with all these numbers. I said, well, what\nare these numbers? When my parents wanted to find out what is this report card, with very good\ngrades. They were like nineties and things like that. you know. And they didn\u2019t know the first\nthing about socialization. They didn\u2019t know that when kids had parties, or you go to somebody\nelse\u2019s house. Everything was different. The conventional things that you grow up with, the\nbooks, the stories, the Alice in Wonderland. The children\u2019s books in this country are totally\ndifferent. So some of that was lost, but I thought they did remarkably well and we had a lot of\nvery nice friends. And I thought the teachers were very welcoming. I still remember some of\nthose teachers. And the community was very accepting. The Jewish community was pretty\nwealthy by and large, because most of them were store owners, as they tended to be. By that\ntime, all lot of them all, like so many others in these smaller Southern towns, their fathers and\nmothers had come to the South, to these communities, selling rags or generally as salespeople.\nAnd then a lot of them decided to stay and built, opened stores. And the war years were fairly\nrecent, so most of them were retail merchants. And some of them were like Heilbronn... there\n24\nwere several factory owners, who were very well-to-do. So, there really... people, most of the\nkids were from much more well-to-do homes and I think to some extent, that\u2019s why so many of\nour own associations, we were always very comfortable with working people, who were not\nnecessarily Jewish. When you\u2019re living really in a Protestant environment in the South. So, I\ndon\u2019t know that we were ever conscious, for example, to the same degree of anti-Semitism to the\nextent that it existed even then. It was never a problem. We never, my parents were not in the\ncountry club set, so they didn\u2019t have to worry about whether they could get in to the country\nclub. But...",
        "A: Oh, I think it went very well. I mean, my folks were very permissive about... and I think I\ntended to... the friends that you made in those years, tended to be either in your neighborhood\ndirectly, and there were a few kids that were in the neighborhood that you played with, and then\nchildren, your friends were also, friends who did well, if you were making good grades. The\nkids you hang out with or that you learn and then their parents hear about you. So I spent some\ntime in those years, it was a little more... probably it was more middle-classy than my parents\nwere. Kids whose homes were a little better. But I think it went pretty well. I didn\u2019t play any\nball really until I was really... we played marbles, we played capture the flag. I got into scouting\nin a big way. And when we went to Gastonia, we moved to Gastonia then and I went into the\nseventh grade and my brother was in the third grade. And in the, I think in the seventh, in the\njunior high school I developed a lot more confidence. And I think by the time I was in the eighth\ngrade I was president of the class. In high school I was president of the class in my, I think my\nsophomore and my senior years. I became pretty Americanized. I was very involved in\nscouting, which was a great help, and in some other civic stuff. And I worked after school. I\nthink what gets you off the ground... when I was twelve, I think, you could start at twelve, I had\nmy first newspaper route. And started delivering papers for the... actually I think I may have\ndelivered papers in Spartanburg. I think I delivered the Spartanburg paper just the last few\nmonths before we left, on a bicycle. My parents bought me a bike and that was a big deal to get\na bicycle. It\u2019s interesting it was a big deal to buy... I got a fountain, the first fountain pen. They\nbought me a fountain pen, when I was in fourth or fifth grade. That was a big thing. They really\nnever... they spent all their money, I mean to the extent that they had any money left it was\nalways for the kids, either little gifts like that, I mean we\u2019d... and you didn\u2019t have television in\nthose days, and you didn\u2019t have... you had a radio. Dad didn\u2019t get a car. We actually, the\nfamily, there was another family living in our building, that had a son, who was our age, who,\nand I remember we drove to Tryon, North Carolina and saw Sergeant York, you know, the\nmovie? Did you ever see the movie? Gary Cooper. It\u2019s a wonderful picture. He was a war hero\nin the First World War or Second? He was from Kentucky, from Tennessee. It was a Gary\nCooper movie. It\u2019s a marvelous picture. He was a pacifist, who enlisted and became the\nCongressional Medal of Honor winner and then came back home. He was a marksman from\nshooting wild turkeys, is where he learned to shoot. But then one week it was on, and when we\nreturned it was Pearl Harbor Day, it was December seventh, 1941, when we went with the\nCarver family to that movie in Tryon. But it was, you know, I think that\u2019s part of our heritage.\nAs some people would say, we were poor and didn\u2019t know it. There was always plenty of food\n25\nand my dad was very involved in the Jewish community there and subsequently in Gastonia. But\nthose early years, when you think about it, we had such an enormous adjustment to make.",
        "A: Well yeah, I mean, I suppose that going... I don\u2019t know why my Dad did not explore a little\nmore about the teaching. I don\u2019t know that, whether, how he felt New York... we were living in\na very crowded place and I think he wanted to get us out of there. Because that apartment, big as\nit was, had my mother\u2019s parents, and her two sisters. And we sort of were just, they would just\nlet us live there. But I don\u2019t think he wanted to stay there. So he set about pretty early trying to\nfigure out what he could do and how to earn a living basically and bring money home, enough.\nAnd that New York City, whether he felt too hemmed-in there, or there just really wasn\u2019t very\nmuch for him to do, because he couldn\u2019t be a teacher, he couldn\u2019t be a rabbi, and he couldn\u2019t\nget a job. There were so many people looking for work, as you say, and it was this immigrant\nsituation. But it did, I\u2019m sure, shaped my life, from the time we went South. But I think, I don\u2019t\nknow that he always... I mean, you know, they had a very strong work ethic. My parents have a\nstrong work ethic. And so they encouraged me or were not opposed to seeing me have a paper\nroute at a very young age. And then, I mean that\u2019s a very liberating experience. I always tell\npeople, I remember getting up at five in the morning, and going out to get the paper and then\ngoing by the coffee store and putting that nickel down on the lunch counter and saying, \u201cI\u2019d like\na cup of coffee.\u201d (Laughing.) I mean I was probably not much higher than the stool. But you\nknow when you have a newspaper route and you start putting a little money in your own\npocket... So I always had a job of one sort or another. I mean my parents just didn\u2019t have any\nextra money to... and we knew that, because we knew how they lived. Whether there might\nhave been small, I guess there might have been a small allowance at one point, but after that\nnewspaper route, I delivered papers at home for a while and then I started... I was telling Reva!\u00ae\nhere the other day, my fiscal director, I hadn\u2019t thought about it, somebody downstairs was, some\nof these people sell Home Interiors, and they do lot of, sell things. I was always selling things,\nwhen I was thirteen, I started selling stationery and greeting cards around the, knocking on doors.\nHad a little... within a year I had a little business. Had a whole room full of stationery and\ngreeting cards for all occasions. And then I was going to the factory owners and selling\nChristmas cards to businesses. Then I started working in town after school for the Jewish\nmerchants. I was always working, doing some kind of work. And it didn\u2019t really get in the way.\n'0 Reva Trusty\n26\nI mean, but kids...people... all of those experiences help you appreciate the way other people\nlive, especially working people. Women you worked with back then, and their families, and\nmoney\u2019s tight and how you make it and don\u2019t make it, and so you have an appreciation for that.\nAnd my mom and dad, my mother was basically always worked at home. She never worked. I\nmean, she was a very traditional mother, in that she was a housekeeper and cooked, did the\ncooking. And later on, I think, when my brother and my sister is ten years... my sister was born\nin 1946!'. So she\u2019s fifteen years younger than I am, eleven years younger than my brother and\nwas not initially expected, I think. But Mom, after my sister was born, a few years later, she\nfinally became, decided she wanted to work, and became a sales lady in one of the large\ndepartment stores, where she worked for a long time. And I think it did a lot for her, she had\nnever worked in any store. But she\u2019s a very warm, very outgoing woman and was everybody\u2019s\nbuddy. And so, she was a very good salesperson, but it was a new experience for her. I think it\nwas an enormous adjustment for her. And really for Dad. And so when I, I think... anyway,\nscouting, during the... we were a little, I suppose people, where else in the South, when you\nthink about it, with this history, being, having people recognize you, elect you to be president of\nthe class or something was quite a nice thing. But I think scouting, and scouting did a lot of that.\nI became an Eagle Scout, and was a counselor in a scout camp for several, in the summers for\nseveral years, very close to the scout executive. In fact, he... this 1s really kind of off the subject,\nbut it\u2019s interesting when we say how things affect your lives. The scout executive in Gastonia,\nmarried a woman, who was a Cherokee Indian. He was a, his name was Schiele. He was a park\nranger for much of his life, and then he got into scouting. And he also, during his ranger days,\nlearned to stuff, to make, he was a taxidermist. He amassed a large collection of animals that he\nhad mounted. And his wife collected, and together they also collected a lot of Native American\nthings, since she was a Cherokee Indian. And when we were, in the summer in our camp we put\non a large Indian pageant every Thursday night. The pageant of Hiawatha. I was Hiawatha for\nseveral years and my brother was Minihaha. They\u2019d put a wig on him and I would paddle a\ncanoe in the lights at night and bring him up. But Bud Schiele, when he retired, he gave this\ncollection to the town of Gastonia and said, I'd like to start a little museum here. So, he gave\nthat collection and began a natural history museum, which today is about a square block. He\u2019s\nno longer there, but they\u2019ve developed this wonderful museum of natural history with outdoor\nwalking trails and some really beautiful... 1t\u2019s quite remarkable in the sense that it\u2019s also twenty\nmiles from Charlotte, which has a very large science museum. But the point I\u2019m getting to, is\nthat after, when I was at, later went to Duke University, I was a chemistry major before I was a\nlawyer. We can talk more about that if you want to. I\u2019ve always had an interest in science and\nin this region here, we are behind, I mean educationally we\u2019re still behind. We\u2019ve caught up.\nBut I\u2019ve always had an interest, as much as a result of that experience and seeing Bud Schiele\u2019s\nmuseum grow, in starting a science museum here. And so outside of my work, my major activity\nhas been involved with this organization that we began, and in the last legislature, we finally got\ntwo and a half million dollars and we\u2019re going to put a planetartum with a very sophisticated\nprojection system out here at the community college. And the guy, and in fact in our little\noffices are next door, and we have a picture of the Schiele Museum on the wall. Because seeing\nthat effort work and flourish in the small town of Gastonia gave me some real thought, idea\nabout the fact that we can do it here. I think a lot of, I mean I think scouting gave me a lot in\nterms of values apart from the Judaism that is in my family.\n'l Joan Rosenberg\n27",
        "A: Uh huh. Bar Mitzvah in Gastonia, North Carolina.",
        "A: No. Now, my father, after he did this commuting thing, we eventually, we then moved to\nGastonia, where I was in the seventh grade and he... when he began working full time, actually\nhe worked in the little community called Lowell, North Carolina, which is about seven miles\naway. And he assisted the rabbi. Sometimes between rabbis he would do... he often acted as the\ncantor during services, and he often was on the pulpit. Sometimes he was not. During the high\nholiday services especially, like Yom Kippur, where people pray and they stay in the synagogue\nall day, the rabbi needs somebody to take turns with. But he was very close to most of the rabbis\nthat were there. The rabbi I was Bar Mitzvah was named Bill Silverman. And we had a, it was a\nvery large group. I suspect there were as many people who were not Jewish in the synagogue as\nthere were, a lot of friends, and my father had all of his friends from the mill that he worked with\nevery day. He was, he became an office manager there, after, in addition to his working daily\naround the, as a shift manager, but he became sort of a supervisor in Mr. Heilbronn\u2019s mill. And\nthen by the time I was thirteen, in the seventh or eighth grade, there were school friends, and\nmother had friends. So, it was a very nice congregation in Gastonia. There were probably fifty\nJewish families. And so I was Bar Mitzvah, and my brother was Bar Mitzvah. Can\u2019t remember\nwho the rabbi was when he was there. And my sister, nowadays they also have what they call\nBat Mitzvahs for girls, where girls go through the same thing. Or they have what they call\nconfirmation classes. I think she did that. We stayed pretty active, but like a lot of other kids\nwho are in the South in high school, after that fourteen, fifteen year old, you sort of... you\u2019re\nthere Friday nights, but teenagers, unless they have a real tie to, unless you\u2019re in a Conservative\nor an Orthodox family that is very traditional, which you get away from the Sunday school. And\nyour next connections with other Jews are... I mean, Charlotte has a large Jewish community\nand there were a lot of children our age, boys and girls, men and women. Then when you get to\ncollege. But we had the Bar Mitzvah. And you know, my father, people were very aware of the\nJewish community, I think, in Gastonia. I was always, in retrospect, after I worked in the Civil\nRights Division and after I was in the service, I always felt a little sad that the Jewish community\nwas not a little more assertive about desegregation. But I think the store owners were all afraid\nto lose their business.",
        "A: Oh, I think that... I mean, Judaism is founded on the theory of Justice. I mean, I think it was as\nbad for them to look the other way as it was for, I mean churches were segregated. It was a\nsegregated life. Although you grow up with it, you don\u2019t pay attention to it. I mean you just\naren\u2019t aware of it. You have, well Spartanburg and Gastonia. Well, Gastonia, as I was growing\nup, I think... .\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n28\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, we were talking about the Jewish communities in these towns and what they might have\ndone. I think it\u2019s always hard to look back and say, but I think the answer would have been if\nthey had felt they could have done more, they might have done more. I think that they were in\nthe business establishment just the way... I mean they were living in the South and they were not\ngoing to be trail blazers, because they would have been ostracized. I mean, if you look at what\nwas going on in the South in those earlier years and even later years when I was in the service...\nwell, I was saying in high school, I think there were some times that there were some occasions\nat high school with kids who were from the, from the black school... there were a few social, not\nsocial engagements, but some things were you tended to see each other. Or if you were working\ntogether, where they were stock boys\u2014I worked in department stores for many years\u2014you\nwould run into them. But it just was a... accepted way of life. And I have just... it did not\nreally, even in college, I mean you heard more about Jews not getting into the country club, and\nthat kind of stuff. And that there were incidents from time to time, but it was never, I don\u2019t think\nI was ever conscious of anti-Semitism. But it was really not until I was in the Service, working\nwith other officers who were African-American, I mean the Service was the first major arena\nwhere there was desegregation in this country, the military. And you know, I have told the story\nthat when I came back from... we brought an airplane back from England one year, by way of\nIceland and Greenland. Came back to New York and then two of us, the radar operator on my\nplane, I was the navigator, was a fellow named Abe Jenkins, who was from South Carolina, who\nwas black. And he and I got on the train in New York together to come home. And when we got\nto Washington, he got up all of a sudden and said, \u201cI'll see you when we get back.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the back of the train, where the blacks are.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah you better, that\u2019s where, I need to go there, otherwise\nwe\u2019re going to have some trouble.\u201d And he did. And I think it was an incident that changed my\nlife, really. Because I never... I was really outraged and aggravated and thought we\u2019ve got to do\nsomething about that or eventually maybe I can help to do something about that or whatever the\nthought was. But that was... so, it was not easy for... it wasn\u2019t going to come without court\naction and others, but I think that the Jews are no less, those Jewish communities are and the\npeople who are there, are no less, maybe no more to blame than their other counterparts. But it\nwas their economic circumstances and they were not willing to speak out or if they did, I don\u2019t\nknow where they did. I mean, the few people who did speak out, until there was more of a\nmovement, couldn\u2019t stay in their communities. I mean I worked with a man, a lawyer in the\nCivil Rights Division, who came from Fort Smith, Arkansas and he started trying to be, I mean\nhe was speaking out and the next thing he knew, he had no law practice left and he was in\nWashington, D.C. So, it\u2019s more easily said than done, but when you think about the history of\nthe persecution in the, that the Jews have had, and the Holocaust and all of the things that are\nbehind us, you... that they\u2019ve gone through, you would have hoped that Jews would have been\nmore sympathetic to the situation that blacks faced every day. And not quite as much of a\nwilling participant. It\u2019s easier said than done. It\u2019s just something that bothers me, you know,\nphilosophically it\u2019s hard to defend it.\n29",
        "A: Yeah, right, I think so. I went to, when I went to Duke, I went to Duke on a scholarship which\nterminated. Because I got, the scholarship I was given through a trustee of Duke, who was from\nGastonia. I can\u2019t remember what his prominence was, but he was on the Board. And he died\nabout six months after I went to Duke. And I had started working 1n the dining halls and they\ntold me I made too much money and didn\u2019t need a scholarship, which might have been all right.\nI didn\u2019t have any trouble, I just worked my way through Duke. But he, but Duke had a quota on\nJewish students even in those years. And it was before the years that there were any black\nathletes to speak of, before Duke had any. So, I was just sort of thinking back, were there any\nblacks in my life in those earlier years? There weren\u2019t. And when I came out of the Service, out\nof Duke, I went into the ROTC. And when I was in the military, that was the first time where I\nhave any... and growing up in this country, yeah, thinking back on it.",
        "A: No, it was very interesting, I think. Because the Scout troop, all the Scout troops were sponsored\nby churches. And the Scout troop I was a member of was sponsored by the Associate Reform,\nARP. They were called the Associate Reform Presbyterians. And I think they\u2019d had two or\nthree other Eagle Scouts from the Jewish community. And so, the answer is no. I mean I think\nthey were cognizant of the fact that we were Jewish. And I don\u2019t know that anybody ever tried\nto sort of convert anyone. But the troop, when I got to scout camp as a counselor one summer, I\nwas sort of... I wasn\u2019t... One of my jobs was to arrange the services and many of the scout\ntroops had ministers along with them or they were their scout masters. And so, I found myself in\nthe position of being, sort of the associate minister to these folks and I learned all the, many of\nthe hymns. And as we grew up, I went to church a few times. I certainly went to that\nPresbyterian church. But I think it was just a healthy respect. I think people in the church\nappreciated, I mean were respectful of the Jewish community and that religion. And often times\npeople came to those services. So, I don\u2019t know that, I think, you know, we often, the Schieles\nencouraged me to do that actually, the scout master. To be... and I often times did the Vesper\nservices for the campers who were there over the weekend. And there would probably be not\nmuch Jesus, but I would read from the Old and the New Testament and we would sing the hymns\nthat they knew, and it didn\u2019t bother me. Now it might very well have bothered many other,\nnot... other Jewish men might have said, \u201cWell you\u2019re just stupid. What are you doing this for?\u201d\nOr you know, \u201cWhy are you being a minister in this largely Protestant camp and sort of\nembracing their way of having a service?\u201d But I didn\u2019t have any problem with that. My parents\ndidn\u2019t have any problem with it.\n30",
        "A: I think my parents were very tolerant of other religions. I think my father... I mean my mother\nbasically grew up in a small, country town and was Jewish, but had many more associations with\nnon-Jewish people. Now my father had this very strong Jewish background. And there was\nactually a period of my life after I came out of the Service that I had given some consideration to\ngoing to Rabbinical school. And in the Reform movement, you know, the Reform Rabbinate is\nnot so different from the minister\u2019s life. It isn\u2019t all prayer. It\u2019s social work, visiting with people,\naround with the Jewish doctrine. So, I think my parents, when my father came South and started\nworking in the factory and realized that it was not going to make sense to be kosher and that\nmaybe bacon and eggs were good together. I think he essentially embraced the idea of Reform\nJudaism and was pretty... and since he worked almost all the time with folks who were not\nJewish. I think only the factory owner was Jewish, Heilbronn. That you, you just adapt\nculturally, much more, which the Reform congregations have done. If you go to Israel, Saturday\nall the stores are closed, right? The Sabbath is Saturday. And Friday night to Saturday night. In\nthis country, it\u2019s all on Sunday. I mean there was never such a thing as Sunday school, but\nJewish Reform congregations have Sunday school. And they basically adapted to living in a\nProtestant society. And I think we did that, and of course, you know, I think my father, it was a\nbig change in our family to have me marry someone who wasn\u2019t Jewish. Although it was\nprobably less pronounced because we were both a little older than if... I mean, as time has gone\non it has become much more common than it was. But then my sister married a young man from\nEastern North Carolina, who wasn\u2019t Jewish. They subsequently divorced, but she\u2019s had a\nsignificant other for many years, who\u2019s not Jewish also. So, I don\u2019t know how, you know my\nfather, I assume he came to grips with that. I think they both felt comfortable about their sons\nand then their daughter, who were, you know, were sort of achievers in the community and were\nhappy with their lives. And everybody likes to hear good things about their kids. And so I don\u2019t\nthink they were going to throw up barriers. I don\u2019t know that it was ever verbalized. I think my\nfather had a very... you know, he was very strong with his own convictions and had some very\nstrong ideas, but again, you know, if your kids go in a certain direction... raising children is as\ndifficult for anybody in school. And if they pal around with, in a society where very few people\nare Jewish, to say, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t go out with them or you shouldn\u2019t go to that camp or you\nshouldn\u2019t do this or you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d it\u2019s much harder. And I think they were always sort\nof adapting to where we were. I think. I mean I think it shows terrific flexibility on their part.\nMy mother was always much more of a social person, much more than he, which more than my\nfather. My dad was a pretty private person. And he was very... he read and he worked and he\nread. When he was home, did the dishes, sat down and read. And he had this enormous\nknowledge of Jewish history and Jewish religion. And there were very few people, other than\nthe rabbi, that he really enjoyed having long conversations with. I mean they were just in a\ndifferent world. I mean he would do his work and liked his work in a very exacting way. But\nthis fellow, when I asked you about Mrs. Hirschfield earlier, the person who volunteered... her\nhusband was a scientist, who came over here and became, and went into the textile work.",
        "A: It\u2019s Frances, wait. Her name was Frances Hirschfield, his name was... I think it might have been\nWilliam.",
        "A: Well, she just died. But he was... he died a few years back in Gastonia. He was, lived in\nHuntsville, Alabama, before they moved to Gastonia. And he came to Gastonia to be, like the\nchief chemist for the factory, dye work and things like that. And my dad could, would, enjoyed\nhaving him to talk to. And even in his retirement, when they moved to Florida, he... one of his\ngood friends was the rabbi for that congregation. So he was not a, he was in some ways a pretty,\na very private person. And I think he didn\u2019t either understand, not... understand may be the\nwrong word. He did not always appreciate what we were doing in our spare time. He didn\u2019t\ngrow up in scouting, but I think he really appreciated what we learned in scouting. And the\npeople that he met, the other scout masters and the activities that we did.",
        "A: My brother was a scout. And he became an Eagle Scout in that same Presbyterian church. He\nendured a summer with me that he says he\u2019Il never forget, because I was the scout master in\ncharge of the cabin when he was a few years younger and was a camper. And I induced him to\nbe Minihaha or twisted his arm or the Schieles twisted his arm. But... so, when... my dad in that\nway was pretty, I think, tolerant of what we did and just let us do it.",
        "A: Oh sure. I think it\u2019s always been important to me and is important to me, today. And you know,\nI think it\u2019s had a profound effect on my life. I talked about it during... I mean, Judaism has been\npart of me all the way through and I guess I\u2019m pretty conscious of being Jewish. Not that I think\nabout it every day, but it\u2019s a very attractive religion, I think. It\u2019s very simple. Its principles\nmake a lot of sense to me, if one is going to believe in a higher being. And people are aware that\nIam Jewish. And I spend some time talking about Judaism, sometimes in schools, sometimes to\ncivic groups or Passover, that sort of thing. But, I mean, nothing to necessarily flout, it\u2019s just the\nway itis. And then of course, I said my wife is not Jewish. But then we have a small Quaker\ncontingent in the mountains that I participate with. So, we put those two things together,\nsomething I probably wouldn\u2019t have predicted years ago either. I\u2019m sure that all of this\nHolocaust history is very much a part of, or has contributed a great deal to what I\u2019ve been doing\nin my later life, in this work that I do and the work I did in the Civil Rights Division.",
        "A: Well, what were you thinking? What else did you want to talk about?",
        "A: I see.\n32",
        "A: Well, I think the family, I think coming to this country... I think we\u2019ve always been grateful for\nthe opportunity that we\u2019re here, from the time we came. And I think my parents were always\nvery cognizant, emphasized that. I always remember right after we, when we moved to\nSpartanburg in those early days, like many other immigrant families, you\u2019d have a picture on the\nwall of Franklin Roosevelt and the Statue of Liberty or something else. And I remember, I think\nI remember this incident: when the immigration people or the FBI showed up one day on our\ndoor in Gastonia\u2014was it Gastonia or Spartanburg?\u2014and they came and took out... you were not\nallowed to have a short-wave radio and you were not allowed to have binoculars, because you\nmight spy on somebody. And we had an old monocular, one of those things that seafaring\ncaptains go... do... use. And they took that. And they saw the picture on the wall and they were\nvery embarrassed in what they were doing. I mean they, my parents were very nice...",
        "A: Right, yeah, if you weren\u2019t American citizens. We were aliens, foreigns, aliens. And eventually,\nyears later they brought them back. They returned them. I don\u2019t know if it was right after we\ngot our citizenship papers. My parents applied to become citizens, then in 1945, after five years,\ntook their test and got their citizenship. We went to Charlotte. Federal judges often talk about\nthe most poignant experiences, how often or how many of them remark about the thrill they\nmake, they have in presiding over the citizenship swearings-in. And we went to... my parents\nwere sworn in in Charlotte. We went across the street. And I think it was... I think that the\nrestaurant... we went to a restaurant. I think it was the first time I ever ate out in my life, that\nthey ever went out. It was a little diner across the street, after the swearing-in ceremony. But,\nand I think that my work, going into the military, in part and then working in the Division and\nmaybe the work I do here is all, in some ways... I never viewed it as a sacrifice, but I think\nhaving a life in public service, in a way, is helping to try to make this country a better place to\nlive in and give back a little bit. I mean there are lots of ways of giving back, if that\u2019s the right\nword, but at least helping to contribute to making this a better society and not necessarily being\ngoverned by the dollar sign, which, you know, we all have an opportunity to do. But in that way,\nI think, all of this, at least I think that whether it was my parents or my Judaism, it all kind of\ncomes together in some way that you... I mean it\u2019s a real privilege to do what I do and get paid\nfor it. And it was that way in the Civil Rights Division, to have a position where you can help to\nprovide better opportunities for African-Americans in this country, by working, by using the\nlegal system to make, to break these barriers down. And to do the same thing in my present job\nor what I\u2019ve been doing for almost thirty years for poor people, to give them a chance to be on\nthe same playing field or to level the playing field for them, at least when they\u2019re trying to make\ntheir way through the legal system, or when they\u2019re in trouble. And to make the legal system\nwork for them, which they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford unless it was for the lawyers and staff in\nthis program that I\u2019ve been in charge of for a number of years.\n33",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know when we found out they were all killed, that the family was killed,\nor what was... you know, in 1944... or even that these ships that were not allowed 1n this\ncountry, all these that were going around and around, went back to Germany, Holland. I don\u2019t\nknow whether there was any contact. I don\u2019t think there was. I don\u2019t think my... that\u2019s a good\nquestion. Whether my father knew where his brother was, that they were alive. I don\u2019t think\nthey did have any contact. Because, and when we looked at those records, I think from being\nwith Mother, that that was the first time that she knew for sure. I mean that we had heard, the\nthing from this... but I don\u2019t think there was any contact. I don\u2019t know. I was still too much in\nschool. I mean, you know, it seems like it jumps from high school. It seems like you\u2019ve always\nknown the story of the Holocaust. But whether we knew that that was happening when, let\u2019s see\nI was, \u201844, I would have been thirteen, in the seventh grade. What are your, what do you know\nabout that?",
        "A: I mean that\u2019s what I remember, I mean that\u2019s my thinking. You read these stories about the\nGermans letting the American Red Cross into some of their camps and cleaning them up and all\nof that stuff. And that they did visit some of the camps, right? At least right after the war. But I\ndon\u2019t know...",
        "A: I mean after the war began. Huh?",
        "A: Right. But I, I mean that\u2019s all I know. I don\u2019t think my father and mother had any idea that they\nwere alive or where they were until after the war. We don\u2019t really know what happened to the\nfamily in Holland, I don\u2019t think. And Frankfurt, the family in Frankfurt. I think we know\nthey\u2019re, did not live. And that, I\u2019m not sure we... I don\u2019t think I could find the record. Trying to\nremember what his first name was, whether that was another de Vries. But it\u2019s... I have a cousin\nwho did this family tree and he drew a family tree like a tree with limbs and with how many\nimmediate relatives on my father\u2019s side and cousins and cousins. I mean when you\u2019 ve got eight\nchildren, and there are cousins that we\u2019ve never met and what happened to them all. I just don\u2019t\nthink there was any real communication in those years.\n34",
        "A: Well, I mean I was in, let\u2019s see in \u201845 I was fourteen. You know, I don\u2019t have a good\nrecollection. We just had a reunion in Gastonia, North Carolina and one of my teachers was\nthere. She\u2019s living out west. She was, it happened that she was the newest teacher to come to the\nhigh school, so she\u2019s only four years older, or five years older than some of us. At the time she\nwas an algebra teacher. And she had her grade book with my name in it. She still had her grade\nbook from those years. I had very little recollection about having been in her class. And so I\ndon\u2019t know whether other people have have better memories about... I mean whether you you\nstart to lose your long... I mean, how good is your memory? Your memory is probably not too\nbad for high school days.",
        "A: So, I don\u2019t know what I remember about Germany. I mean if you go to... we went to services\nFriday night as we all did and you listened to what happened. I\u2019m sure we were conscious of\nwhat, I mean, just like everybody else when they did go in \u201845 and liberate the camps...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\n35\nTape 3, Side B",
        "A: Side B?",
        "A: Well, I was just saying I think that Betty, Sammy\u2019s wife, came out of the concentration camp\nalive. And so there, she was visited a couple of times. We really did not dwell on anything with\nher, I think, other than the fact Sammy was her husband and that she had made it through, I don\u2019t\nknow... and that\u2019s when we went to see her. And of course, that was in 1960... it was 1970,\nwhich would have been twenty-five years after she went to Israel, after the war was over.",
        "A: She went in, or \u201c46, right after she got out. And my father and mother, I think he was in touch\nwith her and had seen her. I mean they went over before we did... it was somewhere in there...\nwell maybe they didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think they went to Israel until after he retired, which would have\nbeen in 1966. When he was sixty-five he retired from this factory in North Carolina. And he\nwent, they moved to Florida. And then in their retirement they took some, they started traveling.\nSo I think they had corresponded pretty regularly, Betty and my father. But, so it was almost\ntwenty years. I think she had relatives in Israel also. But I don\u2019t think they knew very much\nabout what was going on at all. No, I\u2019m not a fount of knowledge about that. You probably\nhave more from other interviews about that. Did you talk to any people who knew very much\nabout, who were in this country, who knew very much about what was happening in the camps\nin the \u201840s?",
        "A: Came after the war.",
        "A: You haven\u2019t talked to many second-generation people like me. My sister was born in this\ncountry. She was born in Gastonia. I still speak like fourth-grade German, and can understand\nit. My brother can speak a little bit. My sister doesn\u2019t know any German. Do you want to see\nany of this stuff? I mean you\u2019re welcome to... I don\u2019t know what there 1s to see, but I think\nyou\u2019re doing it primarily on tape. We have birth certificates. I don\u2019t know where my father\u2019s is,\ncouldn\u2019t find it this morning. I have that Gedenk book in the other room. Ill show you that.",
        "A: Well the pictures, unfortunately are with my mother. She has the old book. And I didn\u2019t... I\nalmost brought them back because nobody ever looks at them. And I happened to look at them\non this trip because I had a little time. For one thing, I didn\u2019t know what had happened to them.\n36\nI was afraid we might have misplaced them. They went back and forth a couple of times. When\nmy mother moved from Florida up to Maryland... my dad passed away in 1989, I think, and she\nstayed another year or two in Florida, where her sister lived in the same place called Century\nVillage. Then she moved to Chevy Chase. She\u2019s about fifteen minutes from my brother in a\nhigh rise for the elderly. So a lot of stuff got moved around, but she does have a lot of the\nphotographs. And it\u2019s nice, interesting to go back and look at them.",
        "A: I enjoyed, I like chemistry and physics and had a very good chemistry teacher. I also like doing\nsales work. I sold a lot, all the way through high school. I sold clothes, women\u2019s shoes, every...\nso I decided I might enjoy being a chemical salesman or technical representative of that sort.\nAnd so, when I came out of Duke, I first went into the Service. When I came out of the Service I\nwent to work for a chemical firm in Philadelphia, Rohm and Haas Company.",
        "A: 1953.",
        "A: I was in the Air Force ROTC partly because at the time they gave you a break on tuition, it was\nsort of an avocation. And I think becoming, I had originally, I had thought about, I mean I\njoined it...the early Air Force, the Navy ROTC\u2019s were giving full scholarship. The Air Force\nROTC was just being established. And I think there was a commitment to two years afterwards.\nIt seemed like when you were footloose and fancy-free in peacetime, it might not be such a bad\nthing to do to get, as a trade-off for some tuition and again the idea of doing some service for\nyour country. So at Duke, so that\u2019s what I did. And then the commitment, the two year\ncommitment, I first thought I would like to fly. And I went to flight school for a short period of\ntime and that didn\u2019t really work out, so I ended up going to navigation training, which I liked.\nAnd I became a navigator and that had a three year commitment attached to it, which I served\nout in England.",
        "A: Right. It was during the Korean War, but I was very far from Korea.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know that it would have mattered. There were some of my, we had our choice if\nyou were near the top of the class, where you wanted to go. Maybe everybody had a choice.\nAnd I could have gone to, I don\u2019t know that you went to Korea, to the Pacific or to teach. I\ndecided that the opportunity to go to England seemed like a really good one. So I chose to go to\nEngland, because of Europe it just seemed like a nice opportunity to travel. There were, I mean\nwe lost, but 1t was not a military, you know, as I said, it was Cold... during the Cold War. And\n37\nso we were doing a lot of exercises on the border out of Austria. Bad T\u00e9lz'\u201d is where the Special\nForces were. And we did a lot of very low flying to bring stuff in. I would not have objected to\nbeing in, if we had had to go. The big, I think most poignant thing for me was, while I was\nEngland, at one point towards the end of my tour, we were on alert for the Six Day War during\nthe Suez Canal crisis. And we were on alert for a week and nobody knew whose side we were\non. They didn\u2019t know which side they were going to go on. And I said, I think this 1s not a good\nway to spend your life, when you don\u2019t know which side you\u2019re on and then they tell you which\nside you\u2019re on, whether you like it or not. So, I thought... I enjoyed my days in the military, we\nhad very... I mean I had wonderful associations. We, the group I was with on this small base in\nEngland still gets together every two or three years, and we\u2019re going to be in Charleston in\nOctober. Over those years my pacifist Quaker wife has gotten to meet some of my war-\nmongering friends and they\u2019ve all gotten to know her. And you know, most of them are retired.\nA lot of them spent their life in the military and then retired or had second careers. But when\nyou mentioned Duke a while ago, I was thinking that it was very, in those days Duke... if I had it\nto do over again, I probably would have gone to the University of North Carolina. I had this\nscholarship. It had a good academic reputation, as it is now. It\u2019s a much more liberal school\nnow; it was very church-dominated. But I made very good friends. I was in a Jewish fraternity\nthere during those years, which was probably the first group of strong associations with other\nJewish men that I had had since probably ever, because many of them came from other states,\nFlorida and north, New York, New Jersey and what have you. While I was there though, I was\nthe delegate to the convention when we agreed to stop limiting the fraternity membership to\nJews. Still I think maybe predominantly, it was called ZBT. I had a lot of mixed feelings about\nthat at the time, but... I mean it was also part of the history of... there was a Jewish sorority and\na Jewish fraternity, and it sort of kept me, those were my strong associations when I was at\nDuke, other than the fact that I also worked in the dining halls, doing waiting, doing\ndishwashing. And then I became cashier and head waiter and learned the food business at Duke.\nIt was working your way through school. But there were, most of my very good friends at Duke\nwere Jewish. We lived together for the three or four years I was there. In terms of the continuity\nand where it was going. And then I went into the Air Force and actually in London, in England\nwe had some distant relatives, who were... I was just looking at the family tree today, were... a\nguy named David Tichauer who was related. A cousin of my father\u2019s was in London. And then\nhis daughter married a rabbi and they went to South Africa, and I think they\u2019re back in England\nnow. But most of the people on the base were not Jewish. I mean most of my associations in the\nAir Force weren\u2019t. So it\u2019s sort of come and gone. I don\u2019t know what we did on Jewish holidays.\nI think someone, there was a chaplain, he wasn\u2019t Jewish. I mean, it wasn\u2019t a full-time Jewish\nChaplain there. But I think I went to the... several times during the holidays I went to London,\nto be with the family. So it\u2019s sort of come along. I was looking at a picture in my mother\u2019s\nphotograph that was taken at Chapel Hill when I went back to Law School at the University of\nNorth Carolina. And the group of Jewish students and the rabbi who was at Hillel, which was\nthe Jewish Student organization on most campuses. That was taken back then, so... it\u2019s always\nsort of been there. Want to stop for a while?",
        "A: John. Actually, this morning. We were not sure, I was not sure what had happened with my\nuncle when he was arrested. And my mother does not know either whether he was arrested and\ntaken away with my father, which I didn\u2019t remember, or whether... she thought that he was\narrested at the same time or almost at the same time. But may have been taken to a different\nplace, because my... I told her my only recollection was running the sandwich up the street to\nmy father. And I didn\u2019t remember seeing my uncle at all. But, I mean he may have been there\nand I was just focused on my father. But they did, he and my father did end up going to\nBuchenwald together. And they were released together, because I remember, as I said, seeing\nthem very bald, in Frankfurt am Main in my Aunt\u2019s house, Elly\u2019s house. And my mother\nconfirmed of course, that my grandmother took me then to Elly\u2019s house. She said that they made\ntheir way to Holland also. She said my grandmother then went to Rotterdam and lived in a small\napartment by herself, near my aunt Mary. That she said, she remembered the German, the Dutch\ngovernment would not allow immigrants to live with their relatives. So she couldn\u2019t live with\nher daughter, Mary, who had four children. And she took, apparently took her meals with her.\nMy family then went into this large detention camp that I had explained, had talked about. And\nshe said my uncle also got there, eventually ended up in that same place in Rotterdam. She\ndidn\u2019t know how he got there, that he... because her impression was that he did not stay with my\nmother, my grandmother. Whether he went back to Leer to close things down very quickly and\nthen made his way to Rotterdam, which is very possible. I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m not sure that\nanyone recorded that. But she did remember that he was in the detention camp with us part of\nthe time because she said that he, she remembered him coming up and talking with my father. I\njust don\u2019t remember, have good recollection of that. And he may not have been there the whole\ntime we were there. She said that he was on the boat that, after us, and the boat turned around,\nshe remembered because war broke out that very day, with the Dutch, and they told the ship to\nturn around. Or with the British. The war had started and they wouldn\u2019t let the boat continue.\nAnd you had asked about our contacts during the war. She knew, as far as she could recall there\nwas no contact with anyone in the concentration camp. She didn\u2019t remember when we learned\nthat Sammy had gotten married in the camp, but there was no correspondence back and forth or\nany kind of... and no one had really any knowledge about what had gone on. She said the Dutch\ngovernment... that both my grandmother and my uncle ended up at Theresienstadt. They\nprobably went to Westerbork first, where most of the refugees went to and then the Germans\ntook all that over. But that was pretty much, I just did not remember, couldn\u2019t fill that hole in.\nWhen I was in the Service, of course we had the relatives in England. And I went to Germany a\nnumber of times with my Air Force, with our crew, we flew planes into Germany several times\nand had some days off. It was a very strange feeling to be in Germany, I always remember,\nhaving, knowing you\u2019re in a country where the language is yours, it\u2019s not like the language you\nlearned in college, but that people are speaking a language that you sort of know is your native\nlanguage. And yet we really were, our trips were generally, our stays were generally quite short.\nAnd I really never made much of an effort to sort of identify the local synagogue if there was\none. I mean I just didn\u2019t come into contact with many Jews. I was trying to think in retrospect, I\nsuppose my first big jaunt was to go, my contact with the Jewish community was really when I\nwent to Israel. When I was in Germany, when I was in England, I took a trip to Israel where I\nvisited my father\u2019s sister and her family, and my counterpart, who was my age at that time. They\nwere out in the country. Living in a little place called Yokneam which was a cooperative\nfarming community.\n39",
        "A: Their names were de Vries. His name was Ivan de Vries and her name was Lina. And that was\nwhen I met Sammy\u2019s widow for the first time. She was living in an apartment, I think in Haifa.\nAnd I spent some time with her, but we didn\u2019t really talk in detail about the camps or I don\u2019t\nknow enough of her own relations. I think she may have had a sister or someone. I don\u2019t know\nabout the details of her family. And Moshe, my cousin, had already gotten married to a young\nwoman named Nurit. In fact while we were there, one of our other cousins was married to...\nwell, no, that was when I went on my second trip. This time I was in the military. I was by\nmyself. And I stayed in Israel a couple of weeks. We had some, I was going to say we had some\nother relatives in Tel Aviv, who had a... whose name was Berliner, he was sort of an amateur\narchaeologist and he had collected this amazing... had done a lot of digging and rooms full of\nartifacts that he had collected. But they were still, they still led a fairly plain farm life back then,\nand were... I remember you didn\u2019t leave any food on your plate. And when they ate their\nchickens, they ate... or ducks, I think, they ate every, they cleaned that duck out. Head included.\nBut they were lovely, lovely people and they knew, of course, Betty. And then I just traveled\naround on my own. And later when I came, after Jean and I were married, we came back when\nshe was pregnant with Michael. She said she was the first non-Jewish wife in the family. But\nwhile we were there we also went to a distant cousin\u2019s, relative, wedding. And that young man\nmarried a Yemenite Jewish woman, which at that time was as different, as rare Jews marrying\nnon-Jews in this country. But that was several years later, and we were still... but it was nice.\nThe family, we are, we still correspond with each other, and we still are close to our family in\nIsrael with Moshe. My father\u2019s sister and her husband have died. And Betty has also died. So,\nbut in terms of Germany itself, you know, when I went, I think I mentioned I had gone back to\nthe town where my mother was born.",
        "A: I may have had some vague memories about the butcher store, because I was so small when we\nwere there, like five and six. I remember the butcher store sign. It\u2019s hard to tell whether what I\nremember really had more to do with recollections from pictures than from what was real. The\npeople I met, who remembered me obviously were contemporaries of my mother or the sisters.\nIt was a small country town and I think my grandfather was well-known in that area for his being\na butcher, an honest butcher and hard working. It\u2019s like Prestonsburg, people who have lived\nhere all of their lives\u2014I mean it was a very well known family, the Schubach family. So people\nwhen I first went there, word traveled pretty quickly, at least in the area where they were and I\nmet a number of people who knew them. I stayed in the local hotel. And later when I came back\nwith mother, a second time, you know, I mentioned her friends were there. But before that... but\nyou always have this feeling generated by the notion that no one there that\u2019s still alive, they\u2019re all\nvery embarrassed, maybe guilty about what happened. And I guess most of them would say they\ndidn\u2019t know anything about it, just like the people who lived near Dachau and Buchenwald and\nsaw the smoke, and were looking the other way or knew, probably most of them knew what was\nhappening or many people certainly knew what was happening in Germany. Many were very\nsympathetic to the whole idea of Hitler and were very supportive of him all the way through,\ncertainly when they thought they were going to win the war. So, I\u2019m sure I think that I had some\nof those mixed feelings and wasn\u2019t, I was younger then, that interested particularly in trying to\n40\ndig up a lot of Jewish history. Well for one thing Magdeburg was not in... I couldn\u2019t go to the\ncity where I was born. So other than the city...",
        "A: It was in the East zone. It was in the Russian zone, so we couldn\u2019t go. We couldn\u2019t go until the\nBerlin Wall came down. So I couldn\u2019t go when I was in the Service or after that. We... I did not\ngo to Leer. I don\u2019t know why I did not really ever try to go to Leer. My wife, Jean and her\nmother, when they drove down from Sweden on a European tour, went through there Leer once\nto see. I have a film at home that was made by a Jewish film maker about a reunion about the\nJewish community from Leer, when Leer hosted the Jewish community for a reconciliation\nweekend and he happened to be there and made a film of that. He\u2019s in Israel now, I think. But I\nhave that film and Leer\u2019s a little bigger than it was. Then I have a family history that you can\nhave or a family tree and there\u2019s a letter from a distant cousin in Virginia, who sort of got into\nthe genealogy and he went back to a number of these places where my father\u2019s mother, the rabbis\nand traced some of that history back. And went to Leer and all of those small towns where my\ngrandmother came from and her family came from. I guess I did not have anything that was\nreally driving me to do that. I think when you get to be older, you sort of start thinking,\nsomebody... which is one my interests in talking with you, it is important to preserve that history\nand it\u2019s nice to have it and to know about it. I\u2019m sure it has some impact on all our lives, but I\ndidn\u2019t do very much of that when I was in the Service. There was, I\u2019m sure, still a lot of\nhostility, feelings, even though my mother and... my father and my mother did go back to\nGermany. They went once or twice. And my dad did not feel, I don\u2019t think he was... I mean\nthey went several summers in their retirement to Austria. And they had been to Vienna on their\nhoneymoon. So I don\u2019t think their feelings were so strong. And my mother, as I said, kept up\nher correspondence with some of her friends. So, anyway, that...",
        "A: Well, the trips to Germany, the formal, were generally military. We had an airplane. We were\nflying into bases in Germany and had business there of one sort or another, training missions. I\ndidn\u2019t really just go there to sightsee. I mean I was there for a reason and then generally we\nstayed over, as we did in other European places. I had some distant relatives in Paris, which I\nwent to see for family connections, who are related to my mother, two older brothers. But I\nthink there is, you know, and maybe the local explorations were kind of curiosity, but it was\nmore looking at this cathedral or... the towns that I wasn\u2019t familiar with, I didn\u2019t... I went to\nOberstein, I really went to Oberstein, to mother\u2019s home town because I happened to be there in\nsurvival training in that area and didn\u2019t realize how close it was. I think I was not yet on any...\nwhether I would have gone there otherwise, I\u2019m not sure. I might have. I think I had some idea.\nI knew mother was still in touch with her contemporaries. Even though my father had no\nconnections to anybody in Magdeburg. Most of their friends that were alive had come to this\ncountry. So, there wasn\u2019t much reason to go, other than maybe trying to determine what the\nstatus was of the Jewish community. Going to Israel of course was a voluntary, it was a vacation\nthing for me. Going to Paris. I think I didn\u2019t go out of my way to go to Germany.\n4]",
        "A: Oh, I think it was a wonderful... it was wonderful to be there. And I felt really proud of what\nhad been done. I never... my father was a very strong Zionist. And I felt very strongly and still\ndo about a Jewish homeland there. But I didn\u2019t really, I think with your parents, I never\nconsidered, I think, living far from where my parents lived, either there... I mean sort of staying\nin Israel while they were here. Just like in this country, I thought, I went to law school in\nColorado one summer and went to other places. And unless you have the means to get back and\nforth every weekend or something, you\u2019d want to be... I always thought we belonged in the east.\nTo be near them. So, Israel is certainly, Jean went with me. I'd like to go back again. It\u2019s a\ngreat accomplishment. And it is, it\u2019s part of our history. And it\u2019s especially nice to have when\nyou have relatives who are there, I mean they were part of the family, being that close, being my\nfather\u2019s sister.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\n42\nTape 4, Side A",
        "A: I think I always had a very strong feeling about allegiance to America or patriotism. I mean that\ngoes back to my parents coming here. You know, I think as you get older, when events like\nVietnam happens, you question it the way any other... the value of that action or any other action\nthat the country takes as a nation, intervening in other wars or as a world leader and the limits to\nwhich you would want to go, that people go to in the name of... that actions that we take as\nAmericans against other countries, or whatever we do in our official nature. As an American, I\nmean, as a responsible citizen should do, but I have certainly never gave it any thought. I mean,\nI think as I said, when we were on alert for a week and didn\u2019t know whose side we were on, I\nthought that\u2019s not a way I want to spend my life. I think if it were a little clearer than that I\nmight have stayed in the military just because of the very close associations I had with the people\nthat I was in the Service with. I mean we were just very, very good friends. And when you do\nthings together and rely on each other in situations I suppose that are somewhat dangerous, and\nyou become very close. It doesn\u2019t have to be just on the battlefield. Even when you are doing\ntraining exercises that are, that involve some danger, in which you act as a team. And then you\nspend a lot of off time together or you\u2019re on a base, like a small base out in nowhere in England,\nyou become part of a family in some way. And so there was, I would have considered that, I just\nwas not... but I decided that I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m ready to push the button on Israel for example\nand start... if we had come in on the other side against Israel, I would have been in a terrible\npredicament. And wouldn\u2019t want to find myself in that predicament. And then after I married a\nQuaker, I left my tennis shoes at the Pentagon Athletic Club and never went back to get them.\nYou know, I probably have a much more, in some ways a different outlook about the value of\nviolence and the value of military actions to some extent. It\u2019s certainly been moderated. I\nwouldn\u2019t at all call myself a pacifist. But I don\u2019t know, anyway, that\u2019s, I certainly think I would\ncertainly consider myself a very, very much an American citizen.",
        "A: Well, I think, you know, philosophically you obviously, Quakers, if you take that position, take a\nstrong pacifist position, you are in a sense ready to die when someone points a weapon at\nsomeone you love and is ready to pull a trigger. And you\u2019re not going to interfere with that sort\nof situation. Or you feel that there is never any justification for violent action. And I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019m in that place. I mean I think there probably are situations where you may find yourself\nwilling to react violently or to take up arms against somebody else under certain situations, under\nthose situations. Like a war. And you use a war to end a war. (Laughing.) I think that\u2019s\nprobably still in my, I think it\u2019s the last resort, and not one that I would promote, but I don\u2019t\nthink I could easily stand by, and stand there. Of course, I joined the, I was in the Air Force\nvoluntarily, no one drafted me.\n43",
        "A: You mean in the concentration camps or where or when?",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I am not familiar with that. And I mean I think it\u2019s probably... I don\u2019t see how anybody\ncould take that position because the Germans were so, they were armed. They were so superior.\nThere were those courageous, there were some of those acts, you know, in several concentration\ncamps where the Jews broke out or had plotted to leave and some did escape. I don\u2019t know the\nname of those camps. And there were individual acts of resistance. I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t see\nhow anybody could have said that. I mean I\u2019ve read an awful lot about and heard a lot about\nJews who were made to sort of cooperate and throw the bodies away, or how much were you\nwilling to do to stay alive? Because the camps also, the camps themselves were operated in a\nlarge part by slave labor, which was pretty horrible, and some of the work that people had to do\nwas pretty horrible. And they were doing it partly to stay alive or they could have gotten shot\nunder the circumstances. And I\u2019m sure people right down to the last second feel like, as some\nwould say, I was trying to stay alive and hope everybody would, that people understand it.\nWhether you are the person who\u2019s going down the list and saying this, and have some decision\nmaking about who\u2019s going to die and who\u2019s going to live, or whether you\u2019re out there and, where\nyou\u2019re effectively making those decisions, hoping to keep yourself off the list. Or whether\nyou\u2019re actually throwing bodies in a pit or doing some other kind of maintenance work, you\u2019re\nunder the gun. I don\u2019t think you can ever, I don\u2019t see how any, I mean I do see, but I would\nnever want to be critical of anybody who is doing that when they\u2019re essentially forced to do it.\nThe people who would say go ahead and shoot me, and let somebody shoot them, are heroes of a\ndifferent sort, I suppose. And heroines of different sorts, when you do those sorts of things on\nprinciple. And that\u2019s how, I guess, principles are established over time. But it\u2019s expecting a lot\nfrom someone. And I think there is an element of forgiveness, generally in our tradition and in\nother traditions. You may have to take an extreme measure to save yourself. You can\u2019t expect\npeople to lay down. So I don\u2019t think that anyone could accuse the Jews of being... if that means\ngoing like lambs to the slaughter. I mean they didn\u2019t have, most of those, most families weren\u2019t\narmed. My father never allowed us to have any weapon. He almost bought me a BB gun once\nand then somebody had gotten a window shot out in the neighborhood and I never got my BB\ngun. But we never had a gun in the house. And he wouldn\u2019t let us have weapons. That was one\nof the no-no\u2019s, one of the few no-no\u2019s.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s hard to answer. I don\u2019t know, because when I was, I think I was, you know, pretty\nyoung. And you come out of high school and you\u2019re out of a background where I had, was\nreally fortunate. I was president of the senior class and had been working and went to Duke and\nAd\nit seemed like a good thing to do. And my father\u2014we went to the bank, I remember borrowing\ntwo or three hundred dollars\u2014he sent me twenty-five bucks a month. And they were straining to\nget me, and I was working to get through. I don\u2019t think the politics of what was going on was, I\nthink my, ideally we were so grateful to be here that generally everything seemed like it was very\npositive to be in this country. I was the first person of my generation to go to college. My\nparents were very proud of that. So, I suspect in many ways... Israel, this country was very\nsupportive of Israel. So, I just think probably in our eyes, it might be a stretch to say the country\ncould do no wrong, but pretty close to it. And that we were ready pretty much to accept the way\nthings were going and felt pretty good about it. I mean I think we felt, I\u2019m sure my parents felt,\nmy dad, that we had come a long way. He was working hard, his son was going to college, his\nyounger brother was doing well in school. I don\u2019t think the politics... my father read the paper\nreligiously. He was a very educated person and he had very strong views of his own about, he\nwas very much of an anti-Communist. He did not, he always preached that Communism\nwouldn\u2019t work, that you couldn\u2019t expect it to and that he thought it was a very repressive system,\nnot only for religion, but for human beings, he thought Communism was terrible. And, I mean\nhe didn\u2019t get out on the street corners, but... he wasn\u2019t himself involved in any politics at home.\nHe voted, he had very strong views, but as I say, he was very much of a private person. And I\nthink the way in many small, southern towns, politics isn\u2019t top of the agenda normally. I mean\nyou lead a pretty insulated, very provincial sort of life. Unless you are... especially if you are in\na working-class family. So I don\u2019t think I was very politically astute. I mean, and as I say, I\ndidn\u2019t have the first thought about any problem about joining the ROTC. I guess I might have\nthought it was a good thing to do, as far as trying to serve the country, you\u2019d get tuition, be able\nto contribute a little bit.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, I graduated from Duke in \u201853, so I was in the ROTC the last two years, I think. \u201851,\n1950-51. There were several of my fraternity brothers who were in as well. It was also a way to\nbe an officer and not to be drafted, not to be an enlisted person. But, and we had a summer camp\nin Tyndall Air Force Base in 1950, I guess, or \u201851. So we graduated in \u201853.",
        "A: Well, it was 1954, which 1s when I... 1954, I was in navigation school in Texas and I think\nclearly I must have known about it. I mean it was a big event in 1954. But you know, it wasn\u2019t\nanything that touched me overnight. And I think Houston, Texas was still pretty much a\nsegregated town. I think over the years that I was in the Air Force, from \u201954 to \u201957, and I told\nyou about the incident with Abe Jenkins. That was really early, actually when you think about it.\nThat incident on the train was 1956. And I think the Interstate Commerce Commission\neliminated that practice, and stopped the segregation in the train, at least by direction, sometime\nin the next two or three years. And things were just starting really to bubble. Because I joined\nthe Civil Rights Division in 1962. The Montgomery Freedom Rides, the bus, those things had\njust taken, they were in 1960, I think, and \u201861, maybe even the beginning of \u201859. But when I\nwent, let\u2019s see, I went to law school and my law school years were \u201859 to \u201862. I came out of the\n45\nservice in \u201857, then I went to work for the Rohm and Haas Company in Philadelphia as a\ntechnical representative for a year and a half. And I traveled Pennsylvania, New York and\nNortheastern states, selling, basically selling chemicals, but doing technical sales work, which\ninvolves developing, having some knowledge of chemistry, developing some product, I called on\nsome pharmaceutical companies. Which among others, water softening, the chemicals in water\nsoftener. Rohm and Haas manufactured something called Amberlite\u00ae resins, which when\nthey\u2019re in very microscopic size, filter water and make hard water soft. And you pour water, salt\nwater in to get the hard water, get the calcium off. And those same resins make a film and when\nyou, when you put them in water and let the water dry up you\u2019ve got clear floor polishes. And if\nyou let the chemical polymers get thicker you get all the way, you all of a sudden you have plex1-\nglass. But I worked at the Rohm and Haas during 1958 and took the law school test. So I\nentered law school in 1959. And we had, one of my classmates is now, who\u2019s now the\nChancellor of North Carolina Central, was an African-American named Julius Chambers, who\nbecame a very prominent civil rights lawyer. Really brilliant young man, who became, was\nactually first in our class. He was the editor-in-chief of the Law Review!*. And we were good\nfriends, and so the years we were in law school, I think those \u201859 to \u201862, were the first... I think\nwe had three or four African-Americans in our class. It had all... the first in North Carolina, that\nbarrier had been broken to some extent. But it was going on, and the Freedom Rides were\nhappening and I think we were all conscious of what was going on. And Julius was just an\nexemplary young man, and did a wonderful, was a great model. Worked terribly hard. We were,\nthere were a few of us who were good friends, who were friends with him. There was still... I\ndon\u2019t know that it was open hostility, because he was such a quiet guy, and who was always first\nin his class, so there wasn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think there was a lot of hostility directed towards him, as\nsuch, except the racial. I mean, people, student body from, law school students are pretty\nconservative anyway, but the students from eastern North Carolina, who were from the\nsegregated, the Black Belt of North Carolina, were certainly still not, I think, as a group,\nsympathetic to having the law school desegregated. We never had any particularly violent, any\nincidents while I was there. But anyway, I think that period, it wasn\u2019t so much when I was\nselling chemicals, I mean I was, really had, I think I was just... law school might have been in\nthe back of my mind, but in the Northeast, things were not as clear. And I was focused on my\nwork and being single and living in Philadelphia and having a good time when I wasn\u2019t working.\nAnd it was not a major kind of issue for me. It was nothing I spent my time on before I went to\nlaw school. And I think law school made you aware of that, especially in the context of my\nexperience in the military, that the South... that we had to do... you know, that things would\nhave to change in the South. They ought to change in the South, because if you were from\nplaces like Gastonia, where I grew up or you liked your hometown, and you liked being a\nSoutherner and you saw the good things that the South had to offer, that this racial situation had\nto change. It might have to be forced to make those changes. But I think I began to think about\ntrying to do something, use, having the law, using the law to help do that. I don\u2019t know that it\nwas all very clear when I first started in law school. Because I really wasn\u2019t sure... I decided to\ngo to law school only... it probably, that may have been in the back of my mind, but I think once\nI had been selling chemicals for a year, it just wasn\u2019t terribly fulfilling. Or if you\u2019re a good\nsalesperson if you like to sell and you like people and can sell anytime. You can always sell one\n'3 Julius LeVonne Chambers, 1936--. Lawyer and civil rights activist, first African-American editor-in-chief of the\nNorth Carolina Law Review.\n46\nproduct or another. I still had the G.I. Bill available and just decided that I thought that there\nmight be a good opportunity to use my head before I let my brain shrink. And so it was all those\nsort of things together. I think that Julius and the... I think that being in law school and\nremembering my experiences in the Service probably had a lot to do, it just sort of came together\nas a way of having me ultimately decide that... I mean when I first went to law school I didn\u2019t\neven know if I could get through law school because it was such a big change.",
        "A: I think I wanted to, well, I wanted to use my head in a... more of an intellectual capacity. And I\nthought that, and I liked... I don\u2019t know if I took a bunch of interest tests. I wasn\u2019t so sure. I\nwas doing fine in this sales work. And I was about to be moved to New York City to take up\nwhere, a big area, Long Island, New York, where another representative was getting ready to\nretire. You know, I wish I could say, well I wanted to go to law school so I could help, so I\ncould go to work for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. But I don\u2019t think\nthat was quite the way it was. I think I wanted to go to law school because it seemed like a good\nway to... it would be a good skill to have. It would be a challenge to become a lawyer. I think I\nknew enough to know, I knew enough that the legal system was a logical way of thinking. A lot\nof people who are mathematicians or who have scientific backgrounds seem to like that. I had\nsome interest in... I say at one point I thought about even being a rabbi. And in terms of\ninterests it just seemed to fit with my general outlook on a good way to use the G.I. Bill and to\ngo back to North Carolina and go to school. It does sound kind of... I was making, I think when\nI first went to, it was a period of time when a lot of veterans were back in school. And there was\nin fact sitting, this nice educational package to do something with, for a few years if you had\nsomething in your mind. If you could afford it. If you could use it. It wouldn\u2019t pay for\neverything, but... So it seemed to me, I was single. It was kind of like... I don\u2019t know why my\nsister decided to go to law school after twenty years as an architect. I mean it was just, I think it\nwas something like that. It might be nice to change, do something different. I could always sell\nchemicals. I don\u2019t think it had anything necessarily to do with my Jewishness or the Holocaust.\nIt just was, I think I decided, I mean sales people spend their time going from, if you\u2019re traveling,\nwhether it\u2019s chemicals or something else, going from one large corporation to another, sitting in\nsomebody\u2019s waiting room until they\u2019re ready to see you, having, maybe going, having a big\nlunch, but having an hour or two discuss talking about your product and their product and how\nthey might use it and why they aren\u2019t buying as much as they ought to or whether, all the things\nabout your product that are better than the competition\u2019s. And then you go on to someplace else.\nAnd you might stay in nice hotels and eat nice big, eat lots of steaks, looking back on it. But it\nisn\u2019t particularly challenging and it\u2019s not, and you also do not become, you don\u2019t have a\ncommunity. I think that was one of the things that bothered me too, in Philadelphia when I was\nthinking back about it. I remember it bothered me back then to some extent, although I wasn\u2019t as\nconscious of that as 1am now. And that is that the people who I worked with, the executives,\nworked in Philadelphia, but they all lived in suburbia and suburban communities. And so they\nwere not at all concerned about the inner city of Philadelphia. It was not their community. And\nso I, which I think, in many of our urban areas gave really rise to the decay, to having those\ncommunities go downhill, until you found some rebirth in those communities. And that\u2019s what\u2019s\nnice, of course, about small towns, which is what I prefer anyway. But, and so I think I was not\nparticularly happy with that way of life, living down, in my sales job. I think I was looking for\n47\nsomething else to do and hadn\u2019t really... I had not, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything I had a real\nburning desire to do. And going back to school seemed like something I wanted to do, but I\nwasn\u2019t sure, probably. I didn\u2019t want to get a Master\u2019s in chemistry. I didn\u2019t think I wanted to\nspend my life... I spent three months in a research lab. That particular organization that I\nworked for was a, you know, they were an excellent company. They were very... and before\nyou even became a sales representative, you were in the labs for three months, working on\nproducts with their own laboratory people. So, you got a sense of what that life is like and what\nthey can do and the sort of support they can give, and so if you\u2019re throwing out theories about\nwhat might be possible with your product, somebody there could, would be available and that\nsort of thing. I think all of that just sort of moved, it just seemed like a good decision. And after\nall, since when I went to, if it didn\u2019t work out after a year or it didn\u2019t work out, I could always do\nsomething else. I didn\u2019t have a family attached to me. But I know, I\u2019m sure, I think that I\nremember the first couple of months here in law school I wondered what am I doing here. I was\nnot making any money anymore. (Laughing.) And just to have the G.I. Bill and a little savings.\nActually I was in the Air Force Reserve. I was in the Air Force Reserve when I was working for\nRohm and Haas in Delaware. I went down there on weekends once a month. And I suppose\nthat\u2019s a comment on... I think, I\u2019m trying to remember whether, I think I had essentially met my\nobligation. There was a little money there, but I was interested in maintaining that proficiency.\nAnd was not sort of, you know, kissing the military good bye. And I belonged to an Air Force\nReserve organization in Delaware. And kept on flying for a year or two. And then when I came\nback to law school, when I came to law school, I continued. And in part it was an income. At\nthat point it was really partly income and I was a dormitory daddy when I was in law school,\nkeeping, had all of... related to a lot of the Kentucky stuff. But I was the dormitory daddy I call\nit, for all the football players at the University of North Carolina. There are a lot of them and\nthey had a dorm full of players. And some of them were veterans as well, who were going back\nto school. At least two of those years. So, I think all of that sort of combined to see how it\nwould to go. And then I...\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\n48\nTape 4, Side B",
        "A: But the... in law school, when you start your very first class, it often assumes you\u2019 ve already had\nseveral, all the other classes. All of law is basically so interrelated and the principles that you\napply in one course often come... are related to something in another course. So in a sense it\ndoesn\u2019t all come together till you\u2019re finished. And then you... I told my sister when she started\nstudying for the Bar, as much as I did not like taking the Bar and studying for the Bar, the Bar\nReview for the first time sort of brings all that stuff together. They don\u2019t have a comprehensive.\nI mean I don\u2019t know why, law school easily could have a comprehensive exam like Ph.D. exams,\nand then you\u2019re a lawyer. Been a lot of debate about that, but it never has come about. So, I\u2019m\nsure I, like many other students, felt pretty lost the first couple of months. And say why did I\nleave a nice good paying job in Philadelphia and come back down here and go to law school?\nBut I stuck it out and I actually got to, as I think other law students do, towards, I got to, I got to,\nenjoy may be the wrong word. But by my last year when we were doing seminars and more\nresearch and writing stuff, I enjoyed my being there. And started to see, I think, how I, that I\ncould, that it would be very challenging to be involved in the Civil Rights struggle through the\nlegal, using the law. I wasn\u2019t so sure yet. I still interviewed some firms in Atlanta. It was out\nhere, and you see the United States doing these things. There were firms in the South that were\ndoing some civil rights litigation. And actually when I interviewed with the Honors program for\nthe Department of Justice, I don\u2019t know how this... as I said, I first went to the Anti-Trust\nDivision, and I can\u2019t, don\u2019t know that I chose the Anti-Trust Division or chose the Civil Rights\nDivision. When I got to Washington and they put me in the Anti-Trust Division I asked to go to\nthe Civil Rights Division. And tried to get an interview with... I think the Civil Rights Division\nwas almost impossible to get into, because there were only... they only had about eight lawyers\nthat were doing civil rights work. And one of them was John Doar\", and he was Assistant\nAttorney General and you couldn\u2019t get a job there unless he saw you and he decided he was\ngoing to hire you. And he was in the South most of the time. And it was very hard to get in the\ndoor. And it was not a really favored section in the Department. It was so small because\nCongress didn\u2019t appropriate a lot of money yet. I mean Senator Eastland!\u00b0 and the Congress\nwas not yet really committed to putting the full force of the government behind civil rights\nlitigation. So, that\u2019s how it just sort of came together. And you know, it was logical in some\nways and it made a lot of sense to me. I just don\u2019t think I realized as I was going through law\nschool, I mean as I say, I went to Atlanta and interviewed with a couple of firms, with some\nfirms, one of which did a lot of civil rights work. And it was a small firm, and then I came back\nand I interviewed with the Department of Justice. And then my roommate and I, one of the, a\nfellow from North Carolina who I had gone through law school with, he had interviewed with\nthe Federal Trade Commission and we ended up going to Washington together and renting an\napartment. He was still a bachelor. And that\u2019s how I got my job, initially. I was with the Anti-\nTrust Division probably, maybe a month or two and then I went to work for the Civil Rights\nDivision. And I was very, very pleased to be able to go there.\n'4 John Michael Doar, 1921--.

        "A: Well, I think really... I don\u2019t know that in 1959 when I graduated, I mean 1962. That was, Ole\nMiss was going on. And I think Julius Chambers went to Charlotte, I think we had some very\nserious discussions about civil rights work. And it was in the papers. And I think I really did,\nwhile I was on the campus of UNC. I mean, by that time it was the foremost issue in the\ncountry. It was school desegregation, Brown. People were still not complying with Brown!\u00ae. It\nwas the Ross Barnett'\u2019, Ole Miss. It was the summer of Meredith trying to get in'\u00ae. So, and\nNorth Carolina wasn\u2019t on the forefront of desegregation efforts either. I don\u2019t think any of the\nstates were. So I think by the time that I got to Washington, I thought that I would really want to\nbe in the Division if I could get there. I think in my mind I was going to come back to the South\nto practice law. Or that I would come home at some point to North Carolina where my family\nwas living. And that I felt that what the government was doing was right. And that it would be a\ngreat opportunity to be a part of that as a Southerner. I guess you kind of feel like you\u2019re helping\nto improve the place that you live in from a position where you could do some good. I think I\nwas pretty convinced that this was not going to happen entirely voluntarily. And that it would\ntake that kind of activity to do it. Even though those were very, very small steps. The Division\nwas very small and was really... there was Meredith. Most of the work the Division was\ninvolved in involved voting rights at the time. There were very few Federal areas where the\ngovernment had the authority to intervene, besides voting. There was no legislation yet until\n1964 where anything could be done about public accommodations or employment. Housing. All\nof those were yet to come. So John Doar had accepted his position at the end of the Eisenhower\nAdministration. I think he had only been there a couple of years. He was a lawyer from\nWisconsin, a plaintiff's lawyer, who was willing to undertake this job. And then when the\nKennedys came in he was in the South, in Louisiana working. Normally they might have\nappointed... Doar was a Republican. And I think Bobby Kennedy read one of his affidavits he\nhad filed or was looking at one of the cases that he was involved in and was so impressed, he\ninterviewed him and asked him if he would stay on as First Assistant, when Burke Marshall\nbecame the Assistant Attorney General\u2019. And he said he would, so he was the boss, that I\ninterviewed with. And I think he was also somewhat attracted to the fact that I was from the\nSouth.

There were several people who had worked in\nthe Division for a long time, who had been in the Department of Justice and the civil rights area,\nthe government had not been very active. We also had authority in police brutality cases already,\nbut I think generally it was not an area, it was an area where the United States attorneys who\nwere in the various states pretty well controlled. It was seen as something that the government\nwas not doing much about. Mistreatment of blacks in the South by police officers. The U.S.\nattorneys were in charge of that, and many of them were from those areas and they were just not\ngoing to do very much about it. I mean the discrimination and segregation was very blatant. In\nmany of the southern counties, there was... I mean Governor Barnett and Wallace\u201d? just defied\nthe government, said we\u2019re not going to let blacks in these universities, right. And that was the\nway the voting thing was all over the South at the time. You could not, blacks couldn\u2019t vote. If\nthey went up to try and register they\u2019d lose their jobs or their lives. So, it was very, and there\nwere very few resources that were being devoted to doing anything about it, until the Kennedy\nAdministration. And I suppose the President was still, in retrospect, was somewhat criticized.\nBut when Bobby Kennedy came in, I mean there were only, this was a very small, still a very\nsmall division. And it started growing, very small, in small numbers budgetarily. But John\nDoar\u2019s idea and I think Burke Marshall\u2019s was to do one step at a time. And we were in Southern\ncourtrooms with Southern judges and even Federal judges were oftentimes from a background,\nfrom segregated communities and were not willing to step out and enforce the law. So, when we\nfirst started we lost many of those cases, until they were appealed... our job was to... and\ngenerally the FBI in many of those communities was not sympathetic. The FBI wanted to, they\nwanted to go out and solve bank robberies. What we wanted them to do was to come with us to\na courthouse and stand there all day with a microfilm machine and photograph voting records,\nwhich we would then take back to Washington, and we would spend days and nights analyzing\nthose records. We would, because the FBI was also, most of those people from that area, they\nweren\u2019t very good about interviewing in the black community. Probably were not sympathetic\nto having those people register to vote. So, we, John developed the notion\u2014which sounds very\nsensible, but had not happened\u2014of basically going into these communities and identifying the\nblack leaders either through the NAACP\u201d! or they\u2019d go in a funeral home or they\u2019d make a\ncomplaint, or one or two people that, do you know this person, and who else, and we would meet\nwith those people and find out that yes, Arwen Donahue tried to register to vote ten years ago or\nsomebody went up to the courthouse and did try to register to vote a couple of years back. Her\nname or his name, and every once in a while you\u2019d find out that they might have let one or two\npeople register. The guy who owned the local funeral home or somebody who was well-known\nin the community, that the white business community was aware of and that the registrar was\naware of. But they would either not let them vote or register at all, because they would lose their\njobs. This job that John Doar, this case John was working on, that Kennedy had read, involved a\nfellow named Atlas\u2019 in Louisiana, who was a farmer, who raised cotton himself. He had a small\nfarm. He went up to register to vote and they found out, and they wouldn\u2019t let him. But beyond\nthat the local ginners then refused to gin his cotton. He went to a number of places, they simply,\nthey refused, they just would not gin his cotton. So, he went to Federal court to try to order them\nto gin his... to stop interfering with his right to vote. And that was how that began. But then\nJohn, I think, was up in Haywood and some of the Tennessee counties, and wherever people\n\u00b0 George Wallace, 1919-1998: Four-time Alabama Governor (1962, 1970, 1974, 1982).\n*! National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\n*2 Charles Atlas\n51\nstarted writing from, we would get some complaints. And so we would go to the communities\nand find out who tried to register and get those names. And especially if they were able to fill\nout a form. And what these Southern counties, what was going on was they were administering\na literacy test. And basically using a literacy test to deny black applicants. Teachers, people\nwho wrote very articulate constitutional sections and they would give blacks very difficult\nsections to interpret, which you and I might not be able to interpret at all. Or if they gave them\nan easier section they would turn them down. And at the same time they were registering whites\nwho were illiterate, essentially illiterate, and who wrote, and/or who wrote very\nincomprehensible answers that didn\u2019t make any sense. It didn\u2019t matter what they wrote\nbasically. And so I\u2019ve got notebooks. And we would then go back, find the records of those\npersons, and go to court and ask the black registrant applicant to testify, and they would prove,\ncould prove their literacy. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a teacher, I\u2019ve been a teacher for ten or fifteen years. I\nhave a Master\u2019s from Tougaloo College.\u201d And then we would have also found the registration\nforms of those whites who either looked as though they couldn\u2019t write or maybe even in some\ncases there were even x\u2019s. And ask that person, and would have the FBI go out and see the white\npersons and ask to show them their form and ask them to read, when they couldn\u2019t. And so we\nwould subpoena them to court, and they would show that they couldn\u2019t read or that they were\njust given help. They could testify, \u201cYes I came up and I registered. I wrote my name.\u201d \u201cWhat\nabout a constitutional section?\u201d \u201cWell, he told me to copy this and write 1t down.\u201d That kind of\nthing. And so we gradually were able to get the courts to adopt a theory that if you, that they\nhave to register blacks on the same basis they registered the least qualified white person. I don\u2019t\nknow that in those early cases, it wasn\u2019t to register illiterates, because the courts didn\u2019t want to\nregister people who were just illiterate. But if you could write, if they were accepting someone\nwho could only write their name or who could understand a very basic sentence, that that would\nbe applied across the board. But that took several years, because the courts were unwilling.\nThey would find some excuses. Or they would say \u201cWe\u2019ll register the five, we\u2019ve got to register\nthose five people who testified. I believe that\u2019s true of them, but you don\u2019t have any others here.\nWho else do you have?\u201d Well, we might not... there weren\u2019t any others because they were\nafraid to go, even though there might have been more blacks living in the county than whites.\nBut all the whites were registered and very few blacks. And that goes back to reconstruction and\nthe development of the literacy test and the poll test, tax. So, we spent our first, I spent the first\nfew years in those kinds of cases. And as we got more lawyers, and as we did those cases, the\nGreenwood... that was also the period of time when there was more, there was more action by\nSNCC and CORE. And you know, in 1964 you had the killing of the three civil rights workers\naround that very thing. They were holding voting rights meetings in Neshoba County,\nMississippi.",
        "A: Well, we basically, we were essentially split up geographically. We had a Mississippi section\nand an Alabama section and a Louisiana section. And I think when I came there were like four\nlawyers in each of those states, 1t might have been a few more. I shared an office with a fellow\n52\nnamed Gerald Stern\u2019\u2019, who was from Memphis and I think there were actually... for a while, and\nthen there were three or four of us and Gerry eventually went to a large law firm. Anyway, he,\nwe would be, we four would basically be assigned two or three counties and we would go down\nourselves. It was John, it was, the first few cases he tried by, he was the lawyer in the\ncourtroom, and supervised the preparation of the cases, and did much of the courtroom work.\nAnd as time went on, it was a real learning time, we did all of the spade work. And we had a\nteam of us, there were, John would have one lawyer inside the courtroom with him and one or\ntwo of us would be outside. And we would do the interviews of the witnesses. And we did all\nthis document preparation, I mean there would be several, even had a footlocker full of voting\nrights records. Very much like doing an anti-trust case. I mean it was all of their records and our\nwitnesses together proved this case of discrimination. But like, I was assigned to Green... to\nLeFlore County, Mississippi. So, I spent a great deal, I mean John couldn\u2019t learn everybody, all\nover the South. I spent a lot of time in Greenwood, Mississippi. Met all of the leaders in the\ncommunity. And there were a lot of voting marches in 1963. And they arrested a lot of, there\nwere a lot of arrests. And I went into the jail and interviewed a lot of the people who had been\narrested. And then we filed a suit to get them out of jail. There were a lot of discussions\nbetween the lawyers for LeFlore and Greenwood and me and some... John would call in, but at\none point... and then the longer we were there the more responsibility we had. Then as time\nwent on the number of lawyers went from eight to sixteen to thirty. And obviously he couldn\u2019t\ntake all the cases, so at that point I started, we were the lead trial lawyers ourselves. But I, and at\none point I had four of those cases going at once in Greenwood, Mississippi. A case involving,\nthere were voting rights cases. And then in 1964, that summer they, when the Public\nAccommodations Act came in, there were two theaters in Greenwood, the Paramount and the\nLeFlore. The LeFlore was part of a chain out of Louisiana. There was a fellow named\nMarchand, who was the manager. And the chain decided they would comply with the civil rights\nlaws and they were going to let blacks go to the movies, because they had always been upstairs.\nAnd the Paramount said no, they weren\u2019t going to let them in, they were going to challenge the\nlaw. So, when the LeFlore said they would then some blacks went into the movie. They were\nbeaten and were ejected essentially. And the police stood by. And so we filed a case in Federal\ncourt to require the police to start giving them protection and to stop this interfering and to sort\nof guarantee the safety of the blacks who would go to the movies. And then also at the same\ntime we filed a case to stop the Paramount from refusing to admit blacks. Then we had, let\u2019s see,\nthen there was another case. Greenwood is where Byron de la Beckwith, he\u2019s the one who\nkilled, shot Medgar Evers**. The lawyer who was in one of these cases represented Beckwith.\nThere was an earlier case involving a voting rights march, I spent a lot of time... there was a\nlittle community outside of Greenwood named, called Itta Bena, Mississippi. It is a very small\nfarming community that\u2019s all the Delta, cotton country. And the black section of that town was\ncalled Balance Due, sort of the story of their lives, right? And they had a voting rights, they\nwere all at a meeting in a church one night. They were at a rally, a voting rights rally. And there\nwas singing, and people were...in 1964. And someone threw a smoke bomb into the church.\n*3 Gerald Stern: Hired to Civil Rights Division under Burke Marshall in 1961.\n*4 Byron de la Beckwith (1921-2001) assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers on June 12, 1963 in Jackson,\nMississippi. Beckwith died in prison of heart problems while his case was still being appealed.\n53",
        "A: No, Dahmer was from Meridian, Hattiesburg, Mississippi. We were involved in that case. Jean\nworked on that case. In fact I have a painting, if you come by the house we got off of, we bought\nat a restaurant in Meridian. But we worked, I worked on Dahmer some. I would work on the\nthree civil rights workers case for quite a time. Anyway this voting rights thing. They arrested,\nso they decided to march up to the deputy sheriff's house to complain about this interference.\nAnd there were about sixty or seventy of these folks. And it was night time. And the next thing\nyou know, they arrested them all, and took them all to jail, from like fifteen year olds to seventy\nyear olds. There were a couple of very old people, several old people. And the next morning\nthey tried them in groups of four for disturbing the peace. And I sat through those trials. He sent\nthem all, he convicted them in groups. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers and so he convicted them\nall in groups for disturbing the peace. And they sent them to the state penitentiary. And so, we\nfiled a court action to try to get them out. And it was called the United States against LeFlore\nCounty. And I worked on, I went to that penitentiary every day for a couple of weeks to\ninterview people. It was a very long delayed proceeding. And actually the Federal judge said\nthat we should have, that he would not interfere with this arrest because it was a state law matter,\nthis disturbing the peace. So, we eventually got the National Council of Churches to put up\nenough bond to get most of them... they did let some of the older people out in a few days. But\nit was a horrendous thing. I\u2019ve forgotten the name of this Justice of the Peace. It will come, I\ncould remember it. But I remember going to the penitentiary every day. The guy\u2019s name was\nArterberry, the warden. He had this huge Great Dane that I did not like at all. But it was sort of\nthe climate, you know, here they are, they arrest all these... they really weren\u2019t doing anything.\nThey were complaining about this smoke bomb. So we brought this action complaining about\ntheir interfering with their right to vote. It was not really the most successful thing we had ever\ndone. I think we should have won the case, but we didn\u2019t. And we did eventually get them out\nof jail with the help of the Kentucky Council of Churches, I mean the National Council of\nChurches. That was probably \u201863, I guess. The LeFlore theater cases, which we eventually won,\nI felt really... this man, Marchand, had worked for this theater chain all his life. And they really\njust... as the result of his doing what his bosses told him to do, they just ostracized that man in\nthe community. I mean they thought it was like he was the one who was responsible for\neverything, for having done this. That he should have quit the job or said, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it\nhere. Whites are going to quit going to the theater.\u201d\u201d He was this nice man, who had lived there\nall of his life. His whole life was the movie theater and people coming to the movies, and\neverybody knew him and liked him. And his life was decimated over that incident. Greenwood\nwas a very, you know there was a lot of civil rights activity all summer long there.",
        "A: Well you know, that was, you know the SNCC headquarters was there and Stokely Carmichael\u201d\u00b0\nand Bob Moses\u2019, who\u2019s now up in Boston, I understand.

In 1998, KKK leader Sam Bowers was convicted of the\nkilling and sentenced to life in prison.\n54\ncontact him because he\u2019s developed a system for teaching math to inner city kids and algebra,\napparently, that is very successful. That\u2019s, it totally changed, in changing his life. I spent some\ntime with Medgar Evers**, not much. He was in, he wasn\u2019t in LeFlore County, but I had met\nhim. And after he was killed... I had actually been to his house not too long before that. There\nwas a recent issue in a magazine of The Washington Post, which the writer had sent to me. And\nthere was a fellow named Willie McGee, who was either on the cover or on the inside section of\nthat... I mean I guess there was a young woman named June Johnson. Fannie Lou Hamer was in\nSunflower County\u201d\u2019. I don\u2019t know if you ever saw that, but there is a one woman play about the\nlife of Fannie Lou Hamer. She\u2019s a woman who grew up on a farm and became a real strong\nvoting rights activist. And one of the first cases I ever worked on involved a situation where\nFannie Lou Hamer and June Johnson and a beautiful woman named Annelle Ponder. June was\nthen about fifteen or sixteen, I think. And there was another young man. They had been to a\nvoting rights workshop in Atlanta and they were coming home to, well they were coming home.\nAnnelle was coming back with them, because she lived in Atlanta, but Ms. Hamer was over in\nSunflower County and June Johnson was in Greenwood. And the bus stopped in Winona,\nMississippi which had a bus station. Winona is in Alabusha County*\u2019. Anyway it was on the\nmain road south and they got off the bus and wanted to get a Coke. And went into the restaurant,\nwhich had... and they called the, the restaurant owners called the police and the local police\ncame and arrested them off the bus. Came and arrested them and took them to jail and beat\nthem, and... in the jail. Couple of officers beat them.

        "A: Yeah, against those police officers. And one of the... 1t was difficult to prove who did the\nbeating, or that there was, other than from the blacks having said they were beaten. They beat,\nactually beat, Mrs. Hamer had a hip injury. She had worked in the cotton fields for some reason\nand they even, she was on a bunk and they hit her. But the FBI had not found any witnesses and\nwe knew there was a trusty in the jail, who was actually a black man, who played a guitar and\nwho was sort of in and out of that jail because he drank. But we knew he was there a lot. And\nthey said they could not locate him, as was the case often. And I remember that I found him,\nfinally through talking to members in the black community, I learned where he lived. And I\neventually went out to see him and it happened to be on the day President Kennedy was killed in\n1963. It was raining like cats and dogs and I was still in the local hotel. And I went out to find\nand I found the trusty, this trusty. And he identified the officers from the pictures I had. And\nthen he told me that he had, that after they had beaten these young black, well they were really\nquite... men and women, that Mrs. Hamer, I guess, was on a cot then. That after they were\nthrough and put them back in their cells, they told him to mop the blood off the floor, which he\ndid. And he testified to that, to his everlasting credit. But the jury was an all-white jury and they\nacquitted them on a Friday afternoon in a very short period of time. The jury went out, the\nfellow who put the case on was named St. John Barrett, who was the Second Assistant of the\nCivil Rights Division, who is a good friend of mine*\u2019. And it was, we did have the U.S.\nAttorney, H.M. Ray, at the table, which was something new. He was at least there. He was a\npresence. But the government had not yet begun a policy of challenging juries there, so there\nwas an acquittal. And I then had to... I drove over to Sunflower County to see Mrs. Hamer\nafterwards, I think. I don\u2019t know if they were still there during the acquittal. I always feel badly\nand I think St. John Barrett, whose nickname is \u201cSlim,\u201d who 1s still practicing law, never really\nforget that acquittal of that really horrible action. You know, it was just very blatant and such a\ncommentary on the way things still were in 1963. You couldn\u2019t get a white jury, even in a\nFederal court, to convict on that set of facts. But we had brought the case, and that was only a\nyear, well it was a few years later, of course, that the civil rights worker trial went off. And that\nwas an all-white jury, too.",
        "A: Well, she was a very remarkable woman, I thought. And I read an autobiography about her not\ntoo long ago. She grew up on a farm and was not a very well-educated person, but she was a\nvery, became a very fiery person, and spoke at the Democratic National Convention. I mean I\nthink she was very disappointed. I think there was a lot of criticism by the activist blacks at the\ntime, not just in this case, about why the government wasn\u2019t doing more. And so I think she sort\nof took this loss as one of many losses along the way. There was a voting rights case in\nSunflower County...you know, we were lawyers who spent a lot of time in the community, but\nwe would go back to Washington. And one of the demands that was never met and probably\n3! St. John Barrett served in the Civil Rights Division from 1957-1967.\n56\nrightly so, was the blacks wanted more protections. They wanted federal marshals when they\nwent to register. And they wanted more lawyers, and Congress wasn\u2019t going to do that. And\nthere was still the question of how much, what do the states do and what the federal government\ndoes and the evolving law. And I think SNCC, we, oftentimes those of us who were there in our\ncoats and ties and with our federal ID badges, some of the more activist people thought we were\njust sort of window dressing. And you know, it was not the same as direct action. And\neventually I think Martin Luther King certainly demonstrated that marching and non-violence\nwas the key to success. That mobilizing blacks themselves, in the march in Selma... I mean I\nthink all of these things that were going on were part of the big picture. I think the Division had\na very prominent role, a very pronounced role that isn\u2019t always recognized. Not just because I\nwas there, because I think we demonstrated that the court, that using the court system was\nextremely slow and wasn\u2019t going to answer this... that we could win one little case at a time, but,\nand that was doing some good. And we were starting to... that that was helping. And it also\ngave blacks some confidence to win. But for the broader picture to change, we also helped write\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965. That Congress... you had to do more than that. And I think the\ncivil rights, I think in a lot of these struggles, things like whether it\u2019s the Wall coming down or\nwhatever it is, someone, it always seems to take an incident like the civil rights workers\u2019 death**\nto wake people up, unfortunately. I mean it\u2019s, there are mining disasters that cause the mine\nsafety laws to come in. The three... the publicity in Selma, in Birmingham with the water hoses.\nIt all, I think, helped mobilize the country to change things. We started, I mean I think the\nconviction of the civil rights workers in 1964, which took a great deal of help by this all-white\njury in Mississippi and by, where you had a presiding federal judge, who was clearly a\nsegregationist: Senator Eastland\u2019s roommate, Judge Cox*?. I think he said, \u201cThis is enough, and\nhe\u2019s going to have a fair trial.\u201d And that was a little step along the way. It took a great deal of\nwork.",
        "A: I was the, really the investigating lawyer. I hadn\u2019t been in the Division that long and so I was, I\nguess you would call, that\u2019s what you would call it. I spent the time in the field and interviewed\nthese folks and got the case pretty much ready for trial. And St. John Barrett was the trial lawyer\nand I assisted him with putting it on and was in the courtroom. I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think I examined\nany of the witnesses in that case. But being in Mississippi I sort of would have written the\nrequest for investigation by the FBI with John. And I went down and was the contact, and\ninterviewed all these people who were eventually to testify and others in the community. And\nsort of put the case together. I mean that was the way we normally did all those cases. Over\ntime that\u2019s also how we learned who the people were in the black community. I mean we did\n2 In 1964 three civil rights workers were murdered by members of the KKK in Neshoba county, Mississippi.

And I think\nthat was very helpful.",
        "A: Oh, I probably had, I had quite a few meals in various, you know, they were like country people\neverywhere. We did not go out together. I went to a lot of church... meetings in churches. Did\na lot of observing also, I mean sometimes when there were marches... I\u2019ve got some photos I can\nshow you that I still have from, like from Louisiana. I spent a summer in Bogalusa, where the\nKlan had been taking a lot of action, was upset because, initially because a relatively moderate\ncongressman had been invited to come to speak: Brooks Hays**. And the Klan rallied. And they\nthreatened to boycott stores that were going to sell to blacks. And there were a number of civil\nrights marches during the summer, that summer with James Farmer and others*\u2019. And I was,\nspent the summer there, basically observing marches, interviewing people and getting the facts\ntogether for an action that we were, eventually filed against the Klan in federal court to get an\ninjunction against them from doing, interfering any further. Again it was tied to voting and to\npublic accommodations and employment. So in many of these cases in those earlier years I had\na... my immediate boss was a fellow named Bob Owen, who was from Texas and who passed\naway a few years ago*\u2019. He was involved in some of those trials. He was in charge of\nMississippi. There was somebody in charge of Mississippi, somebody in charge of Alabama and\nsomebody... Bob had gone to the University of Texas Law School. He had gone to Princeton.\nHe grew up on a farm also, in Texas. Wonderful man. So, essentially in those early years, the\nFBI had not been very effective. Things really changed after the civil rights workers incident.\nAfter that, they moved a lot of agents from other parts of the country to Mississippi and Alabama\nand began to use agents who did not live and grow up in those areas to investigate civil rights\nmatters.

Because the whites... the Bureau in\nthose earlier days was not, made it pretty plain, I think, that they were not sympathetic to the\ncivil rights struggle, or some of them did. Others were, the one in Meridian, the FBI agent in\nMeridian, Mississippi was actually a very fine man, who was very much involved in that\ninvestigation from the beginning.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember his name right now. I mean it\u2019s in my notes somewhere. And there was\na television movie made about it, which was pretty accurate, which put him in the correct light.\nThe Mississippi Burning, which so many people have seen, which was sort of a fictionalized\naccount and always said it didn\u2019t attempt to be accurate. When I have given these talks from\ntime to time and they always say, \u201cWhat happened? Is this the way it was?\u201d And it wasn\u2019t, I\ndon\u2019t think that was really the way the FBI normally acted. I thought that the picture depicted\nthe hostility of whites quite well at the time. But my role in that, besides investigating, I spent\nabout a month trying to put together, putting together a notebook on the background of the\njurors. You know, the jury list was like sixty or seventy people we knew from which the eleven\njurors would be chosen.",
        "A: Yeah, in fact Jean and I had just gotten married and we came back from our honeymoon. And it\nwas right before the trial of this case and so I, I said I really want to go. So I did. And that\u2019s\nwhat I spent the month doing before the trial, interviewing. Today they have all these very fancy\njury experts. They even practice trials in front of a jury to see how a practice jury would do\nthings, especially in the civil cases, not so much the criminal cases. And then I spent a lot of...\nso I did that.",
        "A: Well, you wouldn\u2019t go see the juror. You\u2019d go see people you trusted who might know the\njurors. \u201cDo you know, who 1s this person? Who are they related to? How long have they lived\nhere? How would you expect them to, would you expect them to be fair? Have you, are they a\nmember of the citizens\u2019 council? Who do they employ?\u201d Many of those forms, I mean today if\nyou go, if you\u2019re going to be selected for jury duty, you fill out a form which gives out a fair\namount of very basic information that everybody has access to. And... where you work, that\nkind of thing. This is a way of trying to put together a picture about a juror without contacting\nthe juror directly and trying to be somewhat respectful of the juror and also, not to infringe on\nanybody\u2019s rights, but simply trying to learn as much as you can. Some things are public\ninformation. I mean back then those were, systems were just being developed and we had a jury\nthat had some blacks on them. And there were some members of the, say you have to identify in\nNeshoba County in those communities, from... which was fairly large, the federal jury was from\n59\na larger geographical area. And you make some decisions about paring down these numbers,\nabout which jurors, somebody from Jackson may be from a large metropolitan area and president\nof this company or that company, that you may not spend as much time on. But I assembled a\nnotebook for John, who was going to try the case, so when he got ready to challenge jurors...\nyou have so many preemptory jurors. I mean suppose, it may not be initially apparent, but from\ntalking to people and identifying folks, you might find that a particular juror is distantly related\nto somebody, one of the defendants. Or that his daughter is married to somebody\u2019s son, who\nworks for... and when the judge says, asks the jury, \u201cAre you related to anyone who is being\ndefended?\u201d Normally if you are, you\u2019re not going to be on that jury. Well, if you\u2019re not being\nforthright, if you have some information that gives the lawyer, like John, the opportunity to ask a\nquestion about it. And then lawyers have their own hunches about... every trial lawyer has their\nown... John always said he wouldn\u2019t like, didn\u2019t want jurors that wore white socks. I don\u2019t\nknow why. I\u2019m wearing white socks today. It was a thing, might have come from his accident\ncases. I don\u2019t know if he even lived, whether that was something he really, always... I\u2019m sure\nthat he used my notebook, primarily. But that was... I did some other work, I mean, other\ninvestigative work in the case, but I interviewed lots of other people. But that was something\nI\u2019ve always been proud of, because we got a conviction. We did get a jury that convicted a\nnumber of these people.",
        "A: Yeah, the case had happened in 1964, but the delay, the defendants challenged the legality of the\nindictment under federal law. So, the case actually went to the United States Supreme Court on\nthe legal question. This was not a murder conviction. You know, it was a... they were charged\nwith conspiring to deprive the defendants of their civil rights. It\u2019s a federal conspiracy charge.\nThere was an issue of whether that was a crime, because it involved private individuals as well as\nsome law enforcement. And the Supreme Court in that case said, yes it was a crime. And so\nthen, all that took time, so it wasn\u2019t until 1967 that the trial actually took place. And when I left,\none of the last things that I did in 1970 when we left, was to write a brief. They were about to\nbe, they were still trying to prevent them from their arrest. They were still raising legal\nquestions. And I think that... and we were successful in resisting the objections and they finally\nthen took the people who had been convicted \u2014 they weren\u2019t all convicted \u2014 to jail, where they\nserved their time. And I understand that they are today, finally, what is this? 1999? Thirty-two\nyears later they are thinking about charging them with murder, convening a state grand jury\nfinally. As they did in the Beckwith case.\u00b0\u2019",
        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t do it because the state of Mississippi was not going to take any, I think, serious\naction in racial cases. There were just too much, the officials were unwilling to risk their\npolitical life. I mean, people in Mississippi, I think very substantial numbers still thought these\nwere outsiders who had come in to tell them what to do. They were not sympathetic to\nregistering blacks. \u201cThey should have stayed home. They had it coming to them.\u201d All that kind\n37 In 1999, the state of Mississippi reopened the investigation into the Mississippi Burning case. In 2001, however,\none of the key figures in the case, former Neshoba County Deputy Sheriff and Klansman Cecil Price, died of head\ninjuries. Price\u2019s death was considered a \u201ctragic blow\u201d to the case.\n60\nof sorts of terrible ideas, but it was, but that was... you know, they called it Freedom Summer.\nThey had these workshops, students from all over the country in 1964 were there. And that was\nwhy I was in Mississippi when it happened. Some of us happened to be there. I was in\nGreenwood, I believe when this went on in Neshoba County.",
        "A: Right. My friend Frank Schwelb*\u00ae, who is now a judge in the D.C. Circuit, was the lawyer, I\nthink, who was actually in Neshoba County, and called John, these sort of things were\nhappening. I don\u2019t know that... I don\u2019t think that I went over there right away. Because the FBI\nwas out and they were trying to find the bodies. I was involved in some matters in LeFlore\nCounty, but I was in Mississippi. All of us were there during the summer in one way or another.",
        "A: I\u2019ve been asked that a lot. I really didn\u2019t, I think we, because we were Justice Department people\nand generally people knew who we were. After that I never felt really in danger, particularly\nafter the Neshoba killings, we started always driving together... in Neshoba County, at least, in\npairs, being together with another person who was working. Before that we were always,\ngenerally, by ourselves.",
        "A: No. I never carried a weapon. I was in a, in a registrar\u2019s office once in Yazoo County,\nMississippi. And I was with a team of FBI agents, photographing voting records. And the\nregistrar\u2019s name was \u201cFoot\u201d Campbell. While they were photographing records, I went 1n his\noffice and we were talking about a variety of things and he related to me that he had witnessed\nsome lynchings. And I don\u2019t know why... and I wasn\u2019t going to try that case, I was just there\nwith the FBI. And he got started talking and then he said, \u201cJohn, let me show you something.\u201d\nAnd he pulled this gun out of his drawer and he shot his pistol into the floor in front of me. And\nI said, \u201cWell, why did you do that?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell I just wanted to show you the gun\nworked.\u201d It was very odd. He shot a big hole in his floor. I think he was a little demented\nanyway. But it was the only time I know that... and he wasn\u2019t aiming at me. But all these\nagents came in. Everybody heard this terrible noise in this old courthouse and came running in\nto see what had happened. And he said, \u201cWell I just wanted to show John this gun worked.\u201d But\nI never really was in fear, at least I don\u2019t recall. I think we all knew that we were in such a\ndifferent situation from the people who we were working with. I mean the blacks, who were so\nvulnerable, who were by themselves, who had to really display such courage just to go register to\nvote. We met so many wonderful people, these farmers, local citizens, who simply wanted to go\nregister, to exercise their right to vote. I think you were mentioning what we were talking about\nthe other day, how apathetic people are about voting today. It\u2019s just quite... when you think\nabout it, I mean I think that always, you just couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by these folks, who\nwere, many of them were just hard-working people, who wanted to have the same opportunities\nor just to have the same right as everyone else. I mean it seems so very simple. I will always\nremember a fellow named Eskridge. There was a farmer named William Eskridge in Carroll\n38 Frank Schwelb worked with the Civil Rights Division from 1962-1979.\n61\nCounty, Mississippi, who was really a very bright, articulate man, who lived in a farm, worked a\nfarm that he owned, way out, by himself, out in a very isolated part of the county. And they\nwanted their son to go to, to get a decent education and were willing to enroll him in a white\nschool, a previously all-white school. And we went to court to desegregate the school. One of\nthe earliest cases that the government filed. There had been other school desegregation cases,\nbut the United States didn\u2019t have the authority prior to 1964 to initiate school desegregation\ncases. We could only do voting cases. And we were able to... and whenever I went to see him,\nwhich was many, many times, I just always marveled at how isolated they were, and his\nwillingness and his drive, just and his very simple desire to see the son go. We had an expert\ncome in, and the black school was horrible. It was the same picture as it was with the voting\nthing. They were in this old, rundown building with a pot-bellied stove. I don\u2019t remember\nwhether there was running water or not. But it was just an incredible contrast. And actually he, I\nthink he might have been registered. Everybody knew him. Everybody knew him. And he had\na very good reputation among the white community and maybe that was why he was not so\nafraid. I mean he had a very nice personality and he was obviously pretty bright...\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\n62\nTape 5, Side B",
        "A: Well, I just, you know, I think it\u2019s something that we saw repeatedly. It\u2019s been probably eight or\nnine years, but a fellow, one of the people who worked... well he didn\u2019t work on that case,\nanother lawyer who became a judge, Nick Flannery, worked on that case with me*\u2019. But one of\nour friends went by to see him maybe eight or nine years ago. I think he\u2019s died now. Did he die\nrecently? Jean and I went to Holmes, went to one of those counties, no, two or three years back\nand went to see him. He\u2019s probably in his eighties now.",
        "A: Right. He had afterwards gotten involved in some Mississippi politics for a while and the\nFreedom Democratic Party. I don\u2019t think he ever ran for office. I always thought he should. But\nthere\u2019s not much more to that other than... we won, the judge ordered them to allow his child to\ngo, Judge Clayton, to enter that grade. And we sort of stayed in touch with each other for some\ntime afterwards both in connection with that case, and whenever I would drive... and whenever I\nwent to Mississippi after a while you get to know some of these people and if you wanted to\nlearn about what was going on in the community or whether there were some other incidents we\nought to be aware of, those were the sort of people who called you.",
        "A: It was William Eskridge. I don\u2019t know about the son. Did we meet the son who he was in\nschool with? Actually I have some pictures at home. It was not maybe three years ago. The\nreason I said he died, I think somebody told me. One of the school classes in Holmes County,\nwhich is nearby, one of the high schools did a little project, they put a booklet together on sort of\noral histories about black leaders in their area a few years ago. And it made its way to one of the\nlegal services people who was living there. And they sent it to me and there was an interview of\nMr. Eskridge, who recalled the case we did. I guess that\u2019s really about it, except about, on this\nthing... we just saw those situations repeated over and over. Every county went to wherever the\ngovernment was involved. And today in legal services, I mean whenever you have a movement\nor you have an issue like this, someone is going to, or some group is going to try, is going to\nstand out initially to see, try to help people get justice, or to see that the right result comes about.\nSo, you have leaders like, you may never hear about Mr. Eskridge in Carroll County. You might\nhear about some of the more prominent, you probably hear about Mrs., some of the people, who\nwent to the national scene, like Aaron Henry in Clarksdale, Mississippi, who was President of\nthe NAACP, also*\u00ae. Who\u2019s a very prominent figure and who continued to be a prominent figure\nafter these, in later days when the Voting Rights Act was passed and blacks did get the right to\nvote. Then if you go to Mississippi today, you see the number of black legislators, who are in\nthe Mississippi legislature. And that you had some part in, you see how far it\u2019s come. So there\nare a lot of unsung heroes, I think, like Mr. Eskridge, in all these cases.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Nick Flannery served in Civil Rights Division from 1958 to 1970.\n9 Aaron Henry, 1922-1977. Became Mississippi state president of the NAACP in 1959.\n63",
        "A: I think it\u2019s the same to some extent what you see in small towns. I think\u2014or the rural areas\u2014\nyou get this, I mean 1n a simplistic way, the idea that people accept you for who you are. As a\nsalesman I always used to say in the South 1f you have a customer, they\u2019re going to initially\nassume you are telling the truth and will take you, at face value, what you say, and will welcome\nyou in, and be happy to spend the time of day. And if you are fair with them, you can have a\nlong lasting relationship as you would with anyone else. Whereas, if you were in the urban areas\nof the North, and then again this is very simplistic and probably not true in the sense that you can\ngeneralize, but I\u2019m sure it indicates some of the way that I think and others think. In the\nNorthern, when I was selling chemicals, I think in the North people say \u201cThis guy is a salesman,\nhe\u2019s out to get us and he\u2019s going to be a con man or con woman of one sort or another.\u201d And\nthey have a much harsher attitude. And maybe because these towns are, these cities are so big,\nare not interested normally in forming another relationship and welcoming someone from\nanother place that has nothing to do with where they live. I think the camaraderie of\ncommunities, the fact that people are, whether it is a slower pace. People do have an interest in\nwhere they live and in making it, and in the sense of place where they are. I think that\u2019s maybe\ntrue of smaller communities across the board. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s true in New Hampshire and Vermont\nand in smaller places up North, but it was true of the South. Much has been written about the\nSouth, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with literature of the South. And I think there is some of that\ncommonality. It\u2019s like when I was in the Civil Rights Division, being a Southerner, itself, was\nprobably helpful... 1t was helpful, I\u2019m sure in many ways, especially in dealing with white\nofficials. I mean not that you would necessarily be their buddy, but they sure couldn\u2019t... There\u2019s\nsomething about being able to say, \u201cOh you\u2019re from way up there in New York or you\u2019re from...\nyou don\u2019t belong here.\u201d I mean, the South, I\u2019m not proud of the Confederacy, but it\u2019s part of its\nhistory. And to that extent, I think that\u2019s why... I mean I like the tradition and the atmosphere\nand the welcoming of those communities, they were... with my family. We were strangers in\nthis county, in Spartanburg and in Gastonia, and it became our home. And I think that it made a\ngreat deal of difference. And I suppose, I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t read as much about that, but we\nhad many associations and many more friends who were not Jewish than the ones who were,\nprobably because of our, because of the economics of the situation. I mean in a sense you have a\nsort of a class system, keeping up with the Joneses. Those people were well off and they were\nfriends in the synagogue and were always very nice, but we weren\u2019t... they would, you know, go\nto Florida, or they would travel, and do things that my family, my parents didn\u2019t do, because we\ncouldn\u2019t afford it, because they weren\u2019t interested in it. So, I think that\u2019s the way itis. I mean,\nit\u2019s the same way I feel about being here in some ways. Been here almost thirty years and it\u2019s\nbecome home. And I think the people here share that same kind of feeling about their place and\n64\ntheir community, and Appalachia, it\u2019s different than North Carolina, but it\u2019s the same sort of\nenvironment.",
        "A: In the Division? Well, we had more work in more areas. And after I worked in the Deep South,\nI became a Chief of what was called the Western Section. I started doing some cases in Texas\nand in Nevada. I litigated a case against the Electrical Workers Union in Las Vegas, believe it or\nnot. They didn\u2019t want to let blacks, who were electricians, into the union. Steel workers in Los\nAngeles. In my section in Texas, I didn\u2019t have any... well, I did, spent the last two years or three\nyears 1n a case against the Houston school system. A big desegregation case involving the\nHouston school system. We moved to Houston for several months, prepared this case that I\ntried. But it had been an ongoing case in Houston. And then I was also, I guess I became the\nChief of what is known as the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division. Which is the\nsection that has responsibility for the police brutality cases, these conspiracy cases like the civil\nrights workers. I didn\u2019t, I was in charge of that and had a group of lawyers working with me and\nfor me and the FBI. And the last thing I did was direct an investigation into the Kent State case.\nBut that\u2019s about the time I left, so I didn\u2019t really get involved in very many more trials. The\nHouston case took a couple of years, off and on. I think I was actually the... was I the Chief of\nthe Western Section? Maybe part of it was still going on when I was Chief of the Criminal\nSection. In all these, by that time the Division had gotten a lot bigger and it was sort of a re-\norganization and I had eight or ten lawyers working under me. And we were doing cases around\nthe United States. After the Civil Rights Act and then the Voting Rights Act was 1965, then I\nwas in what we called the Southeastern section, that was Alabama and Louisiana. And I did\nspend some time in Louisiana working on the, when they first brought in federal observers to\nwatch elections, because under the Voting Rights Act people could register automatically by\nsigning their name. In those southern states were covered by that. Then in 1964, the case that\nJean was talking about, we had a case in Selma, Alabama, which was the first... I\u2019m sorry it was\n1965. It was the first case under the Voting Rights Act in Selma, where they were still using\npaper ballots. And it was the first election in which black officials, where blacks had been\nappointed to be election officials. And it was very interesting. Jim Clark, who was the Sheriff of\nSelma and had been such a repressive force in Selma, was running for re-election. There was a\nmoderate named Wilson Baker.*! The election officials who were black had never done that and\nthey were counting all these ballots and they wanted to be sure, they were trying to be careful.\nAnd it was taking them a very long time to finish counting the ballots at the end of the day. And\nall the boxes had come back in from the white precincts. And so the executive committee met,\nwhich was an all-white, democratic executive committee and they decided they would impound\nall of the... there must be something wrong, these people are taking too long. There must be\nsome sort of fraud going on. So they went out and impounded all those ballots. And the next\nday decided that they would, the fair thing to do is not to count the ballots in those boxes at all,\njust leave them out as a group, which had the effect of not counting probably ninety-five percent\nof the black ballots that had been cast. So we filed an action under the Voting Rights Act to\nrequire them to count those ballots. We went to federal court and we got a judge named, whose\n*! On May 3, 1966, Jim Clark and Wilson Baker competed to become Sheriff of Dallas County, Alabama. Baker\nwas the police chief of Selma at the time. This race was the first primary election held after the passage of the\nVoting Rights Act.\n65\nname was Thomas\u201d, who had refused to desegregate the Mobile County, Louisiana schools.\nEach year he\u2019d do just a little tiny bit and we\u2019d, the government would appeal. The next year the\nCourt of Appeals would tell him to do something more and he would only do a little tiny bit. So,\nhe effectively kept them from being desegregated. But when we put this case on and I tried this\ncase and John, for a change, John told me the day before the trial, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try\nthis case, John?\u201d We had been putting it together. He was my assistant, if you will. (Laughing. )\nThe objections, some objections, I put the case on and he did the opening and he also did the\nclosing. He did a very nice job. And Judge Thomas said that, he required them to count them.\nAnd he said, \u201cYou should not deprive a voter of his right to vote based on what might be a\ntechnical mistake by an election official. And we showed that all the ballots were in the boxes.\nThere was no fraud. The number of people who signed in to vote equaled the number of ballots.\nThere might have been one or two slight differences, but basically we proved that all the ballots\nwere there and what they were doing was perfectly good. There was no reason not to count\nthem. So he ordered them to be counted and the result was that Jim Clark was out. We didn\u2019t\nfile the action to get Jim Clark declared ineligible or anything. We filed the suit under the\nVoting Rights Act, in order to have those votes counted as they ought to be counted, so that their\nright to vote was protected and their vote would be counted. But it was the end of Jim Clark as\nan elected official in the county. So, I was always very pleased to have participated in that case.",
        "A: That was 1960, probably 1966. I'd say \u201865, I think the decision was in \u201866. Because the Voting\nRights Act was passed in 1965, which really changed everything. I mean, across the South there\nwere black sheriffs, in these counties that had more blacks than whites or heavy black counties. I\nthink it was really probably the most important legislation in many ways passed anywhere.\nBecause it really gave blacks the right to vote and changed the political process.",
        "A: I, I mean it wasn\u2019t me personally, the Division, the lawyers in the Division, John and our\nappellate section, Burke Marshall, who was at that time not the Assistant Attorney General, but\nhe was still very... became a professor at Yale. But the lawyers in the Division and in the\nhierarchy of the Department of Justice... some of that language, some of that Act was based on\nthe court cases that we had bought. It said if a certain percentage of voters had not voted and if\nthey used a test or device, like a literacy test, if these various criteria were met then it triggered\nthe application of the Voting Rights Act. And if that was triggered, the registration process then\ninvolved, meant that they had to allow everyone to register by a very simple procedure. And if\nthey weren\u2019t going to do that at the courthouse, they could do it where the federal observers\nwere. Or that they did it in the courthouse with federal observers looking on. It is a forced\nprocess that covered virtually the entire South. There was a challenge to the legality of that, that\nwent to the United States Supreme Court, which was upheld. I think United States versus\nLouisiana. Well no, it wasn\u2019t Louisiana. Then there was also, I was involved with the poll tax.\nThe Southern states used poll taxes to prevent blacks from voting for many years. And so I filed\nan action in Mississippi and then I helped the Assistant Attorney General and put together the\ncase against poll tax in Alabama. Which was a fair amount of my time. In 1960... the poll tax\n* According to John Doar, the judge\u2019s name was Frank Johnson.\n66\nwas probably the Voting Rights Act of \u201867, after Selma. In \u201868, I think we did that case, in\nMontgomery.",
        "A: Well, I think that, I mean I might tolerate somebody throwing an egg in my face, especially when\nyou are together with other people, you know. I have a great respect for the non-violent\nmovement and Gandhi and his teachings. I think Martin Luther King and his idea about using\nnon-violence as the way to demonstrate love for your fellow man and woman, and that you have\nto, that that was the way that would be most effective. And that armed, an armed response\nwasn\u2019t going to work. It wasn\u2019t going to work anyway because they didn\u2019t have... a number of\npeople were going to be killed. People were killed along the way. So, I mean, I\u2019m convinced\nreally that you do, that the courts are only an adjunct to any movement of that sort. I mean the\ncourts can help to insure that the rights of individuals and groups are protected within a very,\nwithin a particular sphere or frame of reference. But as I said, the Voting Rights Act, I don\u2019t\nthink, would have been passed, certainly it wouldn\u2019t have been passed as quickly, and I\u2019m not\nsure it would have been passed at all, without the Selma march and the demonstrations and, I\nguess, Martin Luther King\u2019s conviction that gradually the country would recognize how wrong\nsegregation was and that you were simply trying to provide to all citizens of this country the\nrights to which they were secure. I\u2019m not, as far as Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement,\nI\u2019m not a, I don\u2019t, I haven\u2019t studied all of black history anymore than many other subjects I\nhaven\u2019t studied. I think that there is an awful... that it\u2019s important for these, for African-\nAmericans to recognize their history and their culture. There\u2019s a lot to be gained from that, just\nas itis in Appalachia. People ought to be, can be proud of their culture. And that you can do\nthat in this country, within the confines of the law and that there is room for us to have an\nintegrated social system, where groups that are Native Americans, and African-Americans, and\nthe various cultural, ethnic citizens who are coming to this country can still retain and recognize\nsome of their own history and preserve it. And I think that\u2019s really what he was, in part, talking\nabout. I suppose, whether Malcolm X would like to have separated this country into one that\nwas white and black or not. I\u2019m not that familiar with really everything that he wrote. But that\u2019s\nthe way I feel about that. I don\u2019t know that 1t means how I would react in a particular situation.\nWe don\u2019t have any guns in our home, whereas... or in our cars. (Laughing.) And I don\u2019t intend\nto carry any weapons or have them. And many, and in this area and the South, you know, you\nhave a lot of hunters, which Iam not. And you have a lot of people who feel strongly about their\nright to bear arms 1n this area here, where we live. And they can do that. I would be happy for\nus to get rid of all the weapons in this country, hand guns. I don\u2019t need them. But that doesn\u2019t\n67\nmean that I, to me that if push came to shove, I might not feel it was the right thing to do. Or\nthat I would not be a conscientious objector if I were called back into the military. I think that\u2019s\nwhere those lines are. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an absolute line. For me, even though I would think, I do\nbelieve that non-violence has its place and that... if we can achieve the ends that we seek. By\nmass marches, whether it\u2019s for Vietnam or to break down barriers of segregation, then that\u2019s\nwhat should be done.",
        "A: They, I think, well, I think they were quite proud of what I was doing. I think they were quite\nproud of what I was doing. I don\u2019t know that my mom, I mean my father and mother more, I\ndon\u2019t know that my father was totally convinced. I think he was in some ways, he was a little bit\nof an elitist intellectually. As I said earlier, he was not, he was a very private person. He really\nhad a difficult time making conversations with people who he didn\u2019t feel had a great deal of\neducation or that were on his level intellectually. And in that way he was a little bit of a snob, I\nthink. And so I don\u2019t know that he was in total agreement with the use of the nation\u2019s resources\nto desegregate. I don\u2019t know that he was, I think my Dad wasn\u2019t a racist. I don\u2019t think in that\nway, I don\u2019t know that we...\nEnd of Tape 5, Side B\n68\nTape 6, Side A",
        "A: Well, I mean I think it\u2019s complicated and hard to really articulate what my dad\u2019s feelings were. I\nthink they were very proud of the fact, after the fact. I don\u2019t think they were necessarily\nunderstanding about why I went to law school, when they thought I had already found a career.\nAnd had a good job. Within the Jewish community for example, try to explain to somebody why\na man who is, let\u2019s see how old was I? In \u201859 I was twenty-eight. Why anybody would want to\ngo back to school. I think they had the same reaction when my sister went back to school. You\ncan\u2019t tell them anymore that he\u2019s a successful salesperson going, selling chemicals. You always\nwant to tell somebody your kids are doing something that\u2019s fine and they\u2019re well and they\u2019re\ntaking care of themselves, whether it\u2019s a chemical salesman, or doing great things, making a lot\nof money, which is what the Jewish community wants to hear, that people are making a lot of\nmoney, which is their symbol of success. Maybe my mother more than my father. So when I\nwent to law school. But they were very, I think they were very impressed by and large with the\nlawyers and associates that I met in the Civil Rights Division. And certainly having the Division\nand John and the people who... I mean we didn\u2019t have the Kennedys come to our wedding, but\neverybody, a lot of the people from the Justice Department and the Civil Rights Division and our\nassociates. So, I think they were really, as a general matter, very pleased with what I was doing\nas a lawyer and the work I did there. And the work I did here. I think they would never, there\nwas always the question of why I did I just not go into a law firm and make a whole lot of\nmoney? (Laughing.) Why spend your time doing this public service work? Which people still\ndon\u2019t understand, not only about me, but about a lot of other people who work here and work in\nother programs. The work that many people 1n Social Services do and maybe that people do as\nwriters or artists, where they\u2019re trying to live out their life in a way they are comfortable with\nand like, which may not be financially very rewarding. But that that\u2019s not the test for them and\nprobably it ought not to be the test in my mind. So, it\u2019s hard... so I think they were very, you\nknow, when I received some awards later on for my work here and that sort of thing, parents are\nalways going to be happy with something like that. But I think my dad was kind of a\ncomplicated man when it came to the racial thing, because he worked on a daily basis in his\nfactory and I think saw... was not as ready to believe that if you give everybody a chance, that\npoverty is like a vicious circle. If you live in a very poor environment you are going to have\nilliteracy, you\u2019re going to have drugs, you\u2019re going to have alcohol abuse and substance abuse.\nAnd if you don\u2019t look, if you aren\u2019t willing to deal with the causes, and you aren\u2019t willing to try\nto deal with the elimination of poverty at that level, it\u2019s easy to say, \u201cThese folks are always...\nthey\u2019re drinking, they could be... they drop out of school, and it\u2019s all their fault.\u201d\u201d And the next\nthing you know... and they\u2019re certainly true of... there are more poor white people in this\ncountry than there are blacks. But if you look at it as a Southern phenomenon or where you\nlived... I think that someone like my father, who had a history in the Jewish community, where\nwe\u2019re too often too quick to say, \u201cWe were able to take care of ourselves despite all this\nrepression. We came out of Germany, with only the clothes on our backs and nothing in our\npocket and look what we did. Why can\u2019t they do the same thing? The same thing?\u201d People say,\n\u201cLook at Asians, Japanese have come to this country and whose kids achieve, who are motivated\nto achieve.\u2019\n69",
        "A: Well, I mean, I think it\u2019s the same sort of driving force, in a way, that says they are, historically\nhave valued education, and have seen that if you get an education, that you are motivated to\nsucceed and you can be someone. And I think African-Americans see that, too. But I think, I\nthink, as I say, part of it 1s a vicious circle, part of it is, that\u2019s what Jean does, sometimes it\u2019s one\nat a time, that people who are born into these poor economic circumstances, we have a whole\ngeneration, we have several generations of welfare in Eastern Kentucky and in the South. And\nit\u2019s hard to break that cycle in a variety of situations, people, and we... I don\u2019t know that welfare\nreform isn\u2019t all bad. It can be done, in my mind, and I think Jean\u2019s, in a more humane way. But\npeople have to have some support systems, and if you come out from, if you have a series of\ngenerations where education isn\u2019t valued, for example in Eastern Kentucky you could get a very\ngood job mining coal, you didn\u2019t need an education for years and years and generations, all you\nhad to do... I mean, it was hard work, dangerous work in some ways. But it was the kind of\nwork that people knew. It was all manual labor. As that ends, people don\u2019t have those jobs, and\nthey don\u2019t have the options, they find themselves in those situations where there is disparity, they\nhave to leave. And I think the black, in the South, you have the history of segregation for a\ncouple of hundred years, where you don\u2019t have equal opportunity. Where you have terrible\nschools, and where you\u2019re expected to be a sharecropper, really don\u2019t have an equal opportunity.\nThen you can\u2019t have, those children can\u2019t have the expectations of being successful. Now people\ndebate that nationally. Black leaders debate that, you hear it all the time. \u201cWe can be successful.\nWe should not have Affirmative Action.\u201d I think Affirmative Action has been a very successful\ntool. But the pendulum has swung. Now you find Justice Thomas\u201d, and you find black leaders\nwho say, \u201cAffirmative Action is unfair. It\u2019s unfair to whites. It\u2019s unfair in that it gives, we don\u2019t\nneed an unfair advantage,\u201d or to label it as an unfair advantage. To some extent it\u2019s subjective.\nThose are my own feelings about... I think you do have to make additional opportunities\navailable to people who have been historically discriminated against. We have had it and to try\nto isolate that advantage to those very few situations where you can actually prove that this\ncompany discriminated in this bad way and so they\u2019re supposed to overcome that. But I don\u2019t,\nand I don\u2019t think my dad, anymore than anybody else, was... I certainly wish he had been more\nbroadminded about that, I\u2019m just saying he\u2019s not perfect, none of us are perfect and he had his\nimperfections and that was one of them. As far as philosophically, he didn\u2019t go around making\nspeeches about it. But I think he was still proud of what I was doing. I think it was easy, he\nwould be the first, among others, he would say, \u201cWell they should be, certainly not prevent\npeople,\u201d think it was wrong to try to enforce the right to vote or even the right to go to public\nfacilities or to have the same legal rights as everyone else.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure it did. I\u2019m sure that my history and the persecution that Jews had, what we went\nthrough as a family and as Jews had a lot to do with my wanting to participate in the Civil Rights\nMovement.\n3 Clarence Thomas, 1948--. US Supreme Court Justice 1991--.\n70",
        "A: (Talkover.) It\u2019s the same thing. I mean it is essentially the same thing. In a different way. I\nmean it\u2019s the mistreatment of blacks, maybe it isn\u2019t genocide, but there were certainly the\nlynching periods when many blacks were killed. Not in the scale that we\u2019re used to here, that\nwas true in the Holocaust. But I think it\u2019s the same thing that motivates, helped to motivate me\nto work there. And work in legal services, where you\u2019re essentially trying to do something\nsimilar to that on an individual basis. To provide those opportunities so that people are at least\neven in the courts and that they can find lawyers to advocate their positions, which they, in the\ncourts, which they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to do. And I\u2019ve said many times, I think it\u2019s the\nmark of, a good mark, one of the things that this country ought to be proud of, 1s the fact that it\ndoes fund programs like ours, so that people, and provide lawyers to low-income people. And\neven makes it possible to sue the government if necessary, that biting the hand that feeds you, if\nyou have to. You don\u2019t have to do that as much as we did. But we don\u2019t get the funds that we\nought to have, that\u2019s regrettable. Just as regrettable as it was that it took so long to get to the\ndays of the civil rights, it took... Brown against the Board of Education is 1954 and we aren\u2019t\nfully at the end of it yet, with regard to higher education. It takes thirty and forty years. Court\nprocesses are slow. But I think it all has to do with human rights, treating people, giving\neveryone the same opportunity, whether they are young or old, or white or black, or... whoever.",
        "A: My wife, Jean?",
        "A: I met Jean in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. She was, I was the Deputy\nof the Southeastern Section, which handled Alabama, Mississippi. No Alabama and not\nMississippi, then. My section chief was Frank Dunbaugh\u2122 and Jean came to the section as a\nresearch analyst, which she mentioned to you. They are now called paralegals. We call them\nalso administrative representatives here. They do a little different work in my organization. But\nJohn Doar was invited to speak at Earlham College** in Jean\u2019s senior year, or maybe her junior\nyear. Her roommate, Dorothy, now Landsberg, was then named Shelton, was in charge of the\nspeaking program, and for some reason she had heard about John Doar\u2019s work and asked him to\ncome to Earlham to speak. And he came there and then he, I believe first hired Dorothy for the\nsummer to work for him and he also met Jean. Or she came to, or she came to Washington. I\ndon\u2019t know whether he hired her then. They were about, they were the two, I think, the first\nresearch analysts. Dorothy later on after I... and so, Jean came to this section and we began\nworking together. Of course we were sort of... I was second in charge of the section and she\nwas working on cases, and so I think we once... a group of us went on a skiing trip and that was\nthe first time we had any opportunity to be together socially. \u2018Cause we were still I guess\ndrawing some lines when we were at work. She was just a new employee and working under,\nnot directly under me, but with some other lawyers in preparing cases. What they would do is\n\u201c4 Frank M. Dunbaugh served in the Civil Rights Division from 1958-1978.\n* Earlham College is in Richmond, Indiana.\n71\nanalyze the documents, like the voting records we brought back. We similarly started doing the\nsame thing with schools. Normally in a school desegregation case, someone like Jean might go\ninto the Superintendent\u2019s office under a court order or voluntarily and start analyzing where the\nwhite students and the black students in the county lived and why they were not being\nassigned... say, it was pretty apparent in the segregated school systems that you\u2019d have,\nespecially where there was bussing, that black children would need to pass a white school to be\nassigned to their black school. And to put those patterns together and to analyze how the school\nsystem assigned students deliberately, so that white students would be together and black\nstudents would continue to be together. Or route buses in a way that made sure that schools\nremained segregated. So they were really analyzing those records, which they would then\npresent to the lawyers. And the same thing in employment cases, whether, you know, in a large\nfactory, where you looked at the number of applicants for jobs and determined that a black was\npassed over, even though, let\u2019s say that maybe he had made an application to get to a particular\njob and the company said, \u201cWell you weren\u2019t qualified,\u201d in another area. By looking at several\nof those situations you could look, you\u2019d only know from the records whether the person who\nwas actually put in had the qualifications or not, or whether they passed over someone who was\nblack, or they didn\u2019t, the black who had applied was obviously qualified, or less qualified than\nthe person they hired. That kind of analysis, which was then given to the lawyers. So, that\u2019s\nwhat Jean was hired to do. And then we, later on when we were, she had worked there about a\nyear... well, let\u2019s see. It might not have even been a year. When we went to Alabama on this\nvoting rights case, the Jim Clark case, Jean was there with me. She was involved in some\nrecords analysis. And I almost, we were not yet married, but I almost had to put her on the stand,\nbut I didn\u2019t. And there were a couple of other situations where she ended up in a place where, in\na case that I was working on, where we began to suspect that John Doar was deliberately sending\nher to cases that I was working on, since we had started dating or people knew that we had sort\nof started dating. So, after we worked on this case involving Jim Clark, we went over to, it was\nsort of a night and day affair. She was telling you that we had this unfortunate situation where\nLois Baker, who was our secretary. We hired the first probably, black secretary. We had an\noffice in Selma, Alabama. There was a lawyer from the Civil Rights Division, named Chad\nQuaintance, who was the first lawyer that we had in a field office. He and his family moved to\nSelma and were there. And Chad hired Lois Baker as a secretary and she was an African-\nAmerican. She was the one who had these epileptic seizures. She was just very young. I think\nshe was only about nineteen. I went back to Selma for the thirtieth anniversary of the Selma, of\nthe Voting Rights Act in 1995. They had a big get-together. And it happened that I was going to\nBirmingham for a legal services meeting and one of the lawyers who works in my program,\nLarry York, and I went over to Selma for a couple of days. There was a... they have a small\nvoting rights museum there. There were some people around who we visited and I visited Lois,\nwho had since gotten married and had two, several children. And we were thinking back...\nShe\u2019s the head of the computer section at Montgomery Air Force Base or something at this point\nin time. But after that Jean and I went over to Montgomery and helped work on another, on a\nschool case for several days. It was the statewide school desegregation case, Lee Against Macon\nCounty*\u00ae. They needed some help. They were just going to trial and they needed some help in\ngetting the thing going. And Brian, my roommate, I was living at the time with a lawyer named\nBrian Landsberg, who then subsequently married Jean\u2019s roommate, Dorothy Landsberg, who\n*\u00a9 On August 13, 1963, federal judge Frank M. Johnson ordered Macon County and all of Alabama to integrate its\nschools, after six months of deliberation on the Lee v. Macon County case.\n72\nwas the one that John had invited to come out. And Brian was my roommate. We lived together\nin a small house in Washington that we had bought, that we had rented from a former lawyer in\nthe Division. Anyway after that was over, Jean went back to Philadelphia. You asked me how I\nmet her. That\u2019s how I met her, after the skiing trip we started dating. And then after working\ntogether so much, I think we just decided, I just asked her to see if she didn\u2019t think we ought to\nget married.",
        "A: Well, I was with, actually John Doar, I think partially to see that I got home. But to assign me,\nJean went back to Philadelphia after the Montgomery trip. And John asked me to go to\nCharlotte. My classmate from law school, Jultus Chambers, who as I mentioned was my\nAfrican-American classmate, had gone, was practicing in Charlotte, had become a very well\nknown lawyer, who was eventually, in later years argued the Charlotte desegregation case in the\nSupreme Court. But he had started a law firm and was involved in a lot of civil rights activities,\nand there had been an attempt to bomb his house. I think the mail... he hadn\u2019t gotten hurt, it\ndidn\u2019t do a lot of damage. But the mailbox, there had been some exterior damage. And we had\nstarted an FBI investigation and it looked like it was fairly, clearly to do with the Klan. And so\nJohn asked me to go up there and look into that and maybe talk with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.\nAnd my friend, Nick Flannery, who had done the Carroll County case with me, a wonderful\nlawyer, who, when he left the Division went to work for, in Boston with the Center for Law and\nEducation, which was the legal services support center for education cases. He was the chief\ntrial lawyer in the Boston school desegregation case, if you... then. But Nick went with me to\nCharlotte and we started doing some investigation. And we went out to eat, we were in line\ngoing out to eat and I said to Nick, I asked him to hold my place in line, that I would be back in a\nfew minutes and I wanted to make a phone call. And I called Jean at her house. I don\u2019t know\nwhether I thought well maybe she would come down. It was just, my family... see Charlotte is\nonly twenty miles from Gastonia. In fact I don\u2019t think, I was staying with Nick in Charlotte and\nI had not, I\u2019m not sure I had even been home yet. And I don\u2019t know why, whether John sent me\nthere so I\u2019d have a chance to see my folks. I think he thought, literally being from North\nCarolina and he knew I knew Julius, that I would have some interest in this case, being from\nhome. So, I called her on the phone and said, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d or, \u201cDon\u2019t you think we\nshould get married, since we\u2019ve been together all this time and seem to get along pretty well?\u201d\nWe'd actually had been, I mean we had been dating pretty steadily by that time. Even had taken\na trip or two with Dorothy and Brian. But we had not really talked about taking the plunge, I\nthink. Jean would, reminds me that I told her, when I first started going out with her, that when\nwe started going out, that I really would not consider marrying someone who was not Jewish.\nThat I had announced that early on in our dating. And I must have let that one go by the board.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know whether, I\u2019m sure I did. I\u2019m sure I did. I\u2019m sure it came up early. Or once we\nstarted seeing each other and it became a consideration, I\u2019m sure my influence and my history\nwas still pretty strong. And I did not think I would ever marry somebody who was not Jewish.\nBut I did.\n73",
        "A: I think it was clear, I think I put Jean on the plane and I suppose knew that I was pretty much in\nlove with her and that we ought to do that. Why I did it at that particular moment, who knows\u2019?\nMaybe it was the first free moment. We were working on this Klan case and I just had a desire\nto do it. And I knew we would go back to work on the Klan case, probably, and that there would\nbe an opportunity for her to come down. That I would be at home. And then she said, her dad\nsuggested it. I think I got on the phone with them. I don\u2019t know whether I suggested they come\ndown with Jean or her father was never one to sit around and wait. So, then I was able to tell\nNick when I got back in line, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s a wedding in the offing.\u201d We were engaged for, I think\nfrom November, maybe I got home, whether that was the engagement call. We got married in\nFebruary 1967. This was probably like October, November of 1966.",
        "A: Probably, let\u2019s see the Selma case was earlier in \u201866, she came to work in \u201865. So, she came to\nwork right, probably right about the time of the Voting Rights Act. She graduated from Earlham\nin \u201865. Because we just got a postcard, she will be having her thirty-fifth reunion next year. Just\nsent an e-mail out to Dorothy Landsberg. They got married, we were the first of about four or\nfive, actually. She was living, at the time Jean was living in an apartment with Dorothy and\nanother woman named Mary Lee, then Campbell. And all three of them married Civil Rights\nDivision lawyers within a year of each other. And Mary Lee has spent most of her life working\nfor the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. She\u2019s very up in the hierarchy with Marian Edelman*\u2019. She\ndoes a lot of foster care issues, a lot of lobbying. She\u2019s a terrific person. And then Dorothy went\nback to law school. When they, Brian became the Chief of the Appeals Section of the Civil\nRights Division, which he held for a number of years. He worked in our Alabama Section, under\nme, we were living together, but he was in my section for a long, and he then became a section\nchief, I think. And became Chief of the Appeals Section and stayed there until, probably ten\nyears ago, when he joined the faculty at McGeorge Law School in California.*\u00ae And then\nDorothy went back to law school and she\u2019s a lawyer with a very large, not a very large, but with\na fairly prominent law firm in Sacramento. They live in Sacramento. And she\u2019s been recently\nfor the last year been doing a big case with John Doar in his private law firm practice. So most\nof these connections have sort of stayed together. It\u2019s a little bit like the Civil Rights Division,\nfairly small family. The Assistant Attorney General who replaced him, Steve Pollak, was a...\nJean and I... baby, they had three kids and they never had taken a vacation since he came out of\nthe Navy. They were all small. So, one of our first volunteer actions was to move in and they\ntook a two-week vacation, and we moved in with their kids and did child care for a while. All of\nthem are now married or getting married or having children and it was quite an experience for us.\nI think even one of the gerbils died during our sitting. So, that\u2019s how that happened.\nEnd of Tape 6, Side A\n*\u201d Marian Wright Edelman, 1939--. Founder and President of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund.

        "A: I think she\u2019d been there once, I\u2019d have to ask her. But I think she had been down once and that\nwas probably a clue to them, because I didn\u2019t bring women by. I\u2019m pretty certain that she had\nbeen to the house once before. So, they knew of her and they knew... I\u2019m not sure how I\nmanaged to do that. Whether it was on a vacation or whether we had been working on a case. I\njust don\u2019t remember, but I think they knew that we were pretty serious.",
        "A: Well as Jean told you, she was there without me with the both of them facing each other for a\nlittle while, so I guess they were a little bit new to each other. But her father 1s a pretty\nextroverted person, who has a lot of interests and was then much younger, quite young. Was\nvery interested in spiritual things and I think my dad was able to talk to him. And they got along\nvery well. And Jean\u2019s mother and my mother hit it off really well. I think Jean\u2019s mother had\nbeen a secretary and was always doing transcription work of one sort or another. And in fact, in\nthe last fifteen years or so she would not, well after we were married, Jean\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t\ntake a full time job, she worked for Manpower\u00ae\u2019, so they could come down and see Michael or\nbe with the grandson and then the grandchildren. We were both, in the sense that her father\u2019s\nbackground was German and was the son of a tailor immigrant family. His mother was very\nstrong. He grew up in New York City at a time when much of downtown New York was still\nfarm, farming country. There are some old letters in her family that I was reading when I was\nhome, where they were describing the winter and it was cold and they\u2019d have to go outside to the\nouthouse to relieve themselves. And they were literally living in a farming area where the\nUnited Nations Building is now. But the point was that they were sort of both from old\nEuropean generation backgrounds, where the fathers were working and more sort of the\ndominant, and they were making the money and the mothers were at home, and the household\nwas sort of run the way the fathers said it was run. And in that way, I think, there was some\ncommonality, even if the religions weren\u2019t the same and the families got off to a pretty good\nstart. They didn\u2019t stay very long on that occasion and I don\u2019t remember, I mean they saw, saw\neach other periodically and from time to time. Jean\u2019s parents used to, as she said, came to visit\nus alot more. They came down here a lot. They really took a major interest in their\ngrandchildren. My parents had moved to Florida and did not really come up, they made a trip up\nafter we moved here from North Carolina, when they were still living in Gastonia. As I said my\nfather, \u201865, let\u2019s say in 1966... Let\u2019s see, we got married in \u201867. He retired about that time and\nthey moved to Florida shortly thereafter. So that we would go see them usually at Christmas.\nBut they didn\u2019t make many trips up. Right after we moved to Prestonsburg they made a, they\ndrove over, got as far as Pikeville and the four-lane was just being developed, was being blasted\nopen between Pikeville and Prestonsburg. So they got within thirty miles of home and then had\nto take a thirty mile detour around the back hollers from Wheelwright and I don\u2019t think, I think\n* Manpower is a national employment agency for temps.\n75\nthat sort of, was enough for them. Although they moved to Florida, they never really made\nanother big driving excursion up this way. So I don\u2019t know that I have many more, it\u2019s one of\nthose things I don\u2019t have a lot of... Jean probably recalls better than I do. We went back for...\nafter we got married and worked in the Civil Rights Division, when Jean then, when Michael\nwas born in 1970 in April, we had decided then to leave the Division. That was when the Nixon\nAdministration had come in, and even though I was Chief of the Criminal Section, they were not,\npretty much still let me have a free hand. The Houston school case was one of the last cases that\nthey filed in which the government, which I had written the pleadings in, in which we asked for\nbussing as a relief. And they were generally to eliminate segregation, to start bussing black kids\nacross to white schools and whites to black schools. We didn\u2019t get all of that in the relief. We\ndid pair up some schools and we made some other major improvements. But they were, in my\nview, certainly, and others, were retreating on school desegregation. And it wasn\u2019t really... the\nclimate was not what it had been and I, we decided then, I think, that we had been there long\nenough. Besides I had been there, was in a very senior position and at that point you\u2019re starting\nto almost price yourself out of the market if you want to make a career change. You might stay\nwith the government and decide to go, to keep, to go up another notch or two or maybe make\nmore and more money. Or if you\u2019re going to a law firm, in order to get a reasonable salary, too,\nit was at the point where it was a good time for me to do that. So we, and Michael had just been\nborn, it was a nice time to take off for the summer. And we decided then to, we would go on a\nlarge camping trip. We got our little car and the baby carriage, and folded it. We bought a\nPeugeot for eight hundred dollars that looked like it had a lot of miles left on it. And we headed\nNorth and we went North along the American and Canadian coast. We went to the Canadian \u2014\nAmerican National Parks, Fundy and all the way along, Cape Breton, out to Cape Breton and\nPrince Edward Island. Came back to Quebec and basically got away from it all. I think I had\none call from a firm and decided to leave it, not to bother with it. And we weren\u2019t really sure\nwhere, we knew we wanted to do something useful, where I felt I was using my legal talents to\nsomebody\u2019s benefit. And I had talked to some firms and that didn\u2019t really excite me at the time,\nbut I think I was just more, we were really more into making the decision to leave, which was a\nbig thing, because we didn\u2019t have a job. But we wanted to get away for a while and we had\nsome money saved up, so we, while I was on that trip one of the... when we came back... what\nwas it? --Someone left a message for us. One of my former colleagues from the Division, Terry\nLenzner was the head of legal services for the Office of Economic Opportunity. And he was the\none who suggested while we were on this camping trip that we might want to drive through\nCharleston, West, to come through West Virginia and to Kentucky. This is by way of answering\nyou about my parents, because they had moved to Florida. And we were sort of on our way to be\nat the Jewish, to spend the Jewish holidays with my parents in Florida, which is about this time\nof year, in September. So we were off, I think we returned from, we were, went over to Cape\nBreton and we went back to Quebec. And it was really cold and we bought a tent heater. And\nthen we went from there down to Boston and all of a sudden it was ninety-six and we were\nstaying with former colleagues of the Civil Rights Division, who were in graduate school at\nHarvard, I think. And they had this small apartment without an air conditioner. We were\nburning up. Well anyway, we started back down and Terry Lenzner got in touch with us and we\nwent through Charleston. And the program in Kentucky was then associated with this group in\nWest Virginia, called Appalachian Research and Defense Fund, which had been founded by\nthree lawyers, four lawyers, who wanted to start a public interest law firm. And they had begun\nsome environmental work, but were having a tough time economically. And they had gotten in\n76\ntouch with Terry Lenzner at OEO and he wanted to, was willing to do some, to fund an\norganization to do, under the auspices of legal services, to look at some of the symptomatic\nissues around poverty in the Central Appalachian area. Out-of-state mineral interests, black lung\ndisease, environmental damages related to coal mining, deep mining and surface mining. And\nPaul Kaufmann, who was one of the four, there, of those lawyers\u2014there were four attorneys,\nKaufmann was a former gubernatorial candidate and was real active in Democratic politics, had\nbeen a private attorney. And John Boettner, fellow named Ratliff? and a woman named Naomi\nCohen. And then there was a small group here in Eastern Kentucky of lawyers, who had worked\nas a group called Mountain People\u2019s Rights. And there was a fellow named Howard Thorkelson,\nwho was from Pennsylvania. And he had gotten a couple of other lawyers to come down here,\nalthough they were not yet licensed and they were having financial difficulties. So the two of\nthem were sort of interested in working together and getting this federal money through the West\nVirginia organization. West Virginia then had a Republican governor, Arch Moore?\u2019. And he\nwas hostile to legal services, as was the Republican governor in Kentucky, Louis Nunn\u00b0\u201d. So\nthere was a, the West Virginia Technical Institute, was an educational institution, so Terry\nconcocted a scheme whereby he would fund West Virginia Tech, because educational grants\nwere not subject to gubernatorial veto as the other OEO grants were and then they would in turn\nfund Appalred>\u2019. But anyway, I guess I\u2019m getting a little ahead of myself. I was just, we were on\nthis camping trip and so we came to Charleston and talked to the people there. And Paul said,\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go down to visit with the Kentucky people, because Howard Thorkelson is\ngoing to leave and they need someone to replace him and we\u2019re going to be funding them. If\nyou\u2019re interested we would seriously consider asking you to take over this group in Kentucky.\u201d\nSo, we came down here and came here to Prestonsburg on an August or a September evening\nand pitched out tent out there at Jenny Wiley**. Back then, oh actually the campground was at\nthe other end up here near Auxier, at that entrance. Jean wanted me to go out and make sure\nthere weren\u2019t any bears or foxes, she had heard... there wasn\u2019t anybody there but us. It was\nreally after the camping season. But we met the people who were here and everybody seemed\nvery friendly and we decided to go down and... I had already gotten some names of people,\nHarry Caudill, who you know wrote Night Comes to the Cumberlands, was on the Appalred\nBoard in West Virginia>\u2019. He was a friend of Paul Kaufmann\u2019s, I think, and had been very,\nKaufmann had put some people from Kentucky on his Board. He wanted this thing to be more\nof a regional program because there were so many of the issues were common to the Central\nAppalachia, and that the state lines really didn\u2019t mean anything. The strip mining problems in\nKentucky and West Virginia were the same. Unregulated strip mining, land owners having their\nland torn up without their consent, and that sort of thing. So, I went down and talked to Harry\nCaudill. There was a woman, here on Mud Creek they were doing a lot of, they were having a\nlot of problems around health issues. Hospitals weren\u2019t taking people who couldn\u2019t pay. Eula\nHall was her name, she is a good friend, who still works at the, founded the Mud Creek Clinic\nhere in our area\u00ae\u00ae. And I went over into Blackey, Kentucky. There was a fellow named Joe\n50 Ray Ratliff\n>! Arch A. Moore, Jr., 1923--. Republican Governor of West Virginia 1969-1977 and 1985-1989.\n2 Louis B. Nunn, 1924-2004. Republican Governor of Kentucky 1967-1971.\n\u00b03 Appalachian Research and Defense Fund of Kentucky, Inc., headquartered in Prestonsburg.\n4 Jenny Wiley State Resort, Prestonsburg, Kentucky.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Harry M. Caudill, 1922-1990. Attorney, writer, professor. Published Night Comes to the Cumberlands: A\nBiography of a Depressed Area in 1963.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Eula Hall founded the Mud Creek Clinic in Grethel, Floyd County, Kentucky, in 1973.\n77\nBegley, who was running a country store, who was a very strong anti-strip mining advocate?\u2019.\nAnd his wife, Gaynell Begley, she had gotten a Master\u2019s in Education from the University of\nChicago. She was a wonderful person. They... Joe was born here in Floyd County, and he was\npart Indian. We talked a lot about their history and the problems that he saw, poor people, and\nthat people were getting run over by strip miners. Because Kentucky\u2019s courts allowed mining\nwithout, strip mining without land owner approval. Because these out of state mineral owners\nhad come here in the late 1890s and bought out all the minerals. We were talking about country\npeople and being acceptance of outsiders. Have you ever read Harry Caudill\u2019s book, Night\nComes to the Cumberlands? Yeah. Well you know, he describes this situation so well where\nthese land agents for the Northern philanthropists, like Rockefeller and large oil holding and\nmineral holding companies sent their agents down here. They would visit these farmers who\nlived in very remote hollers, where they were farming the mountain hills, really. And they\nwould come in and tell their stories, and spend the night, talk about all the good things that were\ngoing on in the world and how nice this place was. And then they would present them, they\nwould suggest to them that they ought to go ahead and sell over their mineral rights because it\nwasn\u2019t really any benefit to them that they could see. No one knew what mining was. There\nwasn\u2019t any huge deep mine there. The only use they made of their coal would be to cut into the\nhillside enough to get the coal to use for heating up their cabins and their homes, which is what\nmost of them did. You could see the outcrop of the coal and they would run a scraper along the\nmountain and take out a little bit of coal. But no one... certainly they were aware as they were in\nother countries of deep mining methods. And I\u2019m sure these agents didn\u2019t talk a great deal about\nthe possibility of having a huge, deep mine. This was in the 1890s, 1900s, was before the time\nof the railroads. And subsequently the railroads came in once all these minerals had been bought\nup, I mean they literally bought up all of the mineral ownership in Eastern Kentucky. And under\nthe common law, the mineral estate 1s severed from the surface, so what you have left is the land\non top. And they gave them, the deeds they signed as you know, were known as Broad Form\nDeeds because they were so broad in their language. They literally gave the owner of the\nminerals the right to take the minerals and all steps reasonably necessary to build roads and\nrailroads and tram roads. Whatever might be necessary that\u2019s incidental to taking out the coal.\nAnd then they would sign those minerals away. And the Kentucky courts held that those deeds\nwere so broad that they gave the mineral owner the paramount right to the surface owner, as long\nas the mineral owner didn\u2019t arbitrarily misuse that right. As long as he mined by reasonable\nmethods and took the coal out by an acceptable method, the surface owner could not object to\nthat. So those, Joe had one of those old deeds and told me what an awful instrument was, that\neven though at the time when they executed the deeds, no one could have envisioned these\ncurrent methods of mining. Bulldozer, mechanic... and these huge, mechanized equipment that\nwas in use seventy-five years later, that the courts would hold that to be allowable. In most\ncontract law, the contract applies to those things that are within the reasonable contemplation of\nthe parties, like deep mining. There was no doubt that if you were going to mine back then you\nwould deep mine to get the coal out. We never challenged that. But the notion that they could\nuse a method that was not at all in anybody\u2019s contemplation was rejected in other states.\nVirtually. I mentioned West Virginia a while ago, I guess that wasn\u2019t really right. The West\nVirginia courts had said you have to have landowner consent. You could get a surface mining\npermit and you could pay for that. And that was what Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and many of\nthese others, Illinois, all the other states, courts had said, but not Kentucky. So Joe, we talked for\n>\u201d Joe Begley, 1919-2000. Former proprietor of C.B. Caudill Store and History Center in Blackey, Kentucky.\n78\na long time, was pointing out, also how poor people couldn\u2019t get lawyers to challenge those\ndeeds. And they couldn\u2019t get lawyers to challenge a permit application if someone applied for a\npermit. But there were many situations where he thought it would be just a wonderful thing if\nwe could have lawyers available to represent poor people. Because he saw these situations\ncoming up so often. And so, we went on, we went on to Florida to visit my mom and dad and\nwhile on the way I think we kind of decided that this would be an interesting opportunity to try\nto come to Eastern Kentucky. It would be a worthwhile way to practice law and to provide that\nopportunity. There was a lot of interesting work to be done and useful and perhaps important\nwork to do on behalf of low-income clients. And also to help start this legal services program,\nwhich was, had sort of a small beginning in mountain people\u2019s rights. So then we came...\ndecided to come, and we came. And moved to Prestonsburg. At first I looked around in\nBarbourville. We had a little tough time getting off the ground, because the, we had some\ndisagreements about how to do this the best way. Some people, some of the mountain people\u2019s\nrights members thought that it was more important to organize, to organize work with low-\nincome groups like the Welfare Rights Group, rather than doing lawyering work. So it wasn\u2019t\nquite as smooth sailing getting started as I had hoped. But after a little while we got on our way\nand Joe Begley\u2019s son, J. T. Begley, who had just gotten out of the Marines and gone back to law\nschool, turned out to be the first lawyer that I hired. And I hired a fellow named Mort Stamm,\nwho is now in Australia, teaching. And we started off with, then a fellow named Paul Fauri, who\nis the Domestic Relations Commissioner in Franklin County, and we started in that little house I\npointed out to you on the way up here. So, that\u2019s how it began. And I was telling you, it wasn\u2019t\nan easy beginning. I think the Bar Associations were very suspicious and I think they were\nthreatened and thought really we were going to compete with lawyers for clients that would be\nable to pay. And then some, many lawyers, who were employed or retained by coal companies\nwere not particularly sympathetic to the notion that lawyers might start to challenge some of\nthese practices and give people representation in the courts. So we were not the most popular\npeople in town when we started. I had difficulty renting an office. Finally found an office in the\nplace where Jean and I ended up living for a long time on the other side of town, within a week\nof each other. And we got started. It was also a difficult time because at the national level,\nPresident Nixon had an Office of Economic Opportunity Director, who was opposed to legal\nservices, bringing any of these sort of controversial cases against public officials, and\nchallenging welfare rights practices and that sort of thing. And he, he decided to, he wanted to\nde-fund those programs. So I had only been here about a year when all of that began in 1973 and\nit looked like we might lose our money. We had half of the lawyers were on half salaries and the\nsecretary, we had to hire, we got a lawyer in Washington, Steve Pollak, I mentioned to you, I\nused to work with, to represent us to threaten to sue OEO to get our funding. Some other\nprograms similarly went through a period of that sort. Governor Reagan at that time, who would\nbecome President, had sort of declared war on legal services in California, who had represented\nmigrant farm workers and had also won some fairly major welfare decisions with regard to\nhearing rights. And had showed that the California welfare system was violating the rights of\nwelfare recipients and applicants. And he was angry and tried to start, established an inquiry,\ntribunal out in California, that sort of thing. Actually the tribunal came out with a report, this\nincluded some judges, that was very favorable to CRLA. Then when Reagan became President,\nhe decided to do it all over again.\n79",
        "A: California Rural Legal Assistance Program, a rural program much like we are here. But\nfortunately we managed to weather those storms, and we were able to, and in 19... we were able\nto reach an accommodation with legal services actually, in that 1973 when we were represented\nby Steve Pollak and we sort of severed our ties to West Virginia by establishing a separate\ncorporation here. I mean it was... and they established, we added \u201cof Kentucky\u201d at the end of\nour name. We\u2019re still very good friends with the people in West Virginia and some of the work\nwe do is the same. But in West Virginia they ended up establishing a judicare program, which is\na program where cases are sent to the private bar, instead of a staff attorney. And you have a\nsmall central office and the cases are... and then you contract with lawyers. It tends to be a lot\nmore expensive. But Appalred\u2019s office did maintain intact in West Virginia, just with a fewer\nnumber of lawyers. So then we started our own program here. And in 1974, one of the last\nthings President Nixon did was to sign legal services Corporation Act, which he had vetoed once\nbefore. And then the corporations started getting larger amounts of money from year to year.\nAnd between 1975 and 1978 we expanded from the single office here in Prestonsburg to the ten\noffices that we opened and still have. And we went from probably three hundred thousand to\nabout two million dollars a year in our budget. We had eleven offices by 1980, including we had\na research office in Prestonsburg, I mean in Lexington, which we still have. So we undertook\nsome very important day-to-day litigation. We represented a lot of people in everyday problems\nwith family law, consumer rights, housing problems. And we did some of the larger challenges\ninvolved in, with regard to the coal mines. We found out that the agencies that governed all of\nthese programs were not really very responsive at times. The state\u2019s Mine Safety and Health\nAdministration did not do a good job in protecting the rights of coal miners. So we saw that\nwhen miners were fired because they complained about unsafe conditions. I mean, that that\u2019s\nwhat would happen to them if they complained. And so we were able to start representing them\nto get their jobs back and to get damages for them. And then in the environmental area we\nrepresented numbers of people who were challenging surface mining permits because they posed\ndangers to their homes and their property. And we gradually, as we kept after this Broad Form\ndeed, we challenged it in the courts unsuccessfully. And we eventually wrote legislation that\ncorrected the problem. We drafted a statute that said that if the kinds of mining methods were\nnot described in the deed, that it would be assumed that it referred only to methods that were in\nexistence at the time the deed was executed. And in Eastern Kentucky or in most places that\nwould mean deep mining only. That was first introduced in 1994. There were some previous\nefforts, unsuccessful... there was an earlier statute that required surface owner consent and the\ncourts struck that down. And then this legislation of ours was also struck down on a four \u2014 three\nopinion. The court said that the legislature could not tell the courts how to interpret deeds, which\nwe thought was bad reasoning. But after that a legislator from Pike County, Clayton Little\u00b0\u00ae,\nintroduced at the urging of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, that was then called the\nKentucky Fair Tax Coalition...\nEnd of Tape 6, Side B\n\u00b08.N. Clayton Little: Member of the Kentucky state house of representatives, 93\" district. Elected 1973, 1975.\n80\nTape 7, Side A",
        "A: I was just saying that the constitutional amendment was passed in 1988, so it was introduced in\nnineteen, I guess in the 1988 legislative session. And it was passed by ninety-two percent of the\nvoters. It was a great publicity campaign by KFTC, a lot of letters to the editor, it sort of put\nthem on the map. We had started KFTC with a small group in Hazard, Kentucky. A group of\ncitizens came together to talk about fair taxation of minerals, initially. Because the coal under\nthe ground, not only did the land owner not have the opportunity to object to whether they could\nbe surface mining or not, but they were paying virtually all the taxes on the property. They were\nnot... and the Kentucky constitution said that all properties, cash... 1s taxed in fair cash value.\nBut the minerals weren\u2019t being taxed. So the group looked at that and decided that they would\ntry to start an organization called the Kentucky Fair Tax Coalition. I\u2019ve even been credited with\ngiving, we were sitting around the room trying to decide what should this thing be called?\nPeople were throwing up names. (Laughing.) Somebody said, I think it was, whatever the\nvarious combinations people had been throwing out, was that I suggested it be called\nKentuckians Fair Tax Coalition. But the other issue it took on was the Broad Form Deed. And\nthe group started very small, it was just kind of a get together really. One of the members who,\none of the folks who was there was a young man named Joe Zakos, who had come from\nPennsylvania and was interested in working with local citizens groups. And he had come, was\nliving in David, I think and had gotten involved in some issues over in Martin County. It didn\u2019t\nhave anything to do with the Broad Form Deed. It was really a proposal to move a low-income\ncommunity out of a flood-prone area. And they were going to fill it in and put in new housing or\nindustrial... the only thing was they forgot to discuss it with the people who were living there.\nAnd he organized an effort there to... which ultimately stopped that. They backed off on that\nproject. But in the process began a group called the Martin County Concerned Citizens, who\nthen were involved with a number of environmental and socially active, social... got involved in\nissues of social concern. We represented them one year in a case challenging the application\nof... Kentucky Power wanted to build another power generating plant. And the reason they\nwanted to build it was to sell more power to other companies, but it would have raised the rates\nof everyone, including the Martin County citizens, people who lived in that area. And we had a\nlawyer in legal services in Lexington, Tony Martin, who focused on energy work, and basically\ndemonstrated that there was no need for the power plant, that all it was going to do was increase\neverybody\u2019s power bill. They had plenty of generating power, they were just trying to expand\nthemselves. And the stockholders might benefit, but the Martin County citizen group was the\nnamed party. And so that was just to say that, even though a group that was called Kentucky\nFair Tax Coalition and decided later to rename itself Kentuckians for the Commonwealth,\nbecause local chapters were working on different issues of local concern. Didn\u2019t necessarily\ninvolve minerals and that sort of thing. But they really put themselves on the map with the\ncampaign to get the constitutional amendment passed. So that amendment was on the ballot in\n1988, along with the lottery. And the lottery barely passed. It passed by, I think, fifty-one or -\ntwo percent of the vote. Ninety-two percent of the vote, people voted for the Broad Form Deed\namendment, which showed people knew what they were doing. In fact, I remember when, early\nwhen we had been here not too many years, the Courier-Journal I think did an informal poll.\nAnd something like ninety-three percent of the people thought they shouldn\u2019t allow anybody to\n81\nstrip mine your land without your consent. But I was then, one of my, the coal industry decided\nthey wanted to challenge the constitutionality of that constitutional amendment as violating the\nfederal constitution. Because they claimed that mineral ownership rights had been established by\nthese series of Kentucky cases in the Supreme Court over the years and that people when they\nbought mineral rights expected to be able to legally surface mine. And we argued... and I was\nrepresenting an older couple in Johnson County, Garnet and Eugene Ward, who lived on a small\nfarm... they really weren\u2019t farming. It was in a holler that had not been mined. And there was a\nmining application by a company. And at the trial court, one of the attorneys who was here then\nwas handling, handled that case, and it was on appeal and it came to me and I took the case over.\nAnd we ended up arguing the constitutionality of the amendment in the Supreme Court. And the\nAttorney General argued in our support and the court then agreed with our theory that they never\nhad the right 1n the first place to grant the right to strip mine. So it took a lot of years, but finally\nthe right was... you cannot today surface mine anybody\u2019s land without their consent.",
        "A: I think it was 1990. The Supreme Court decision was stated in 1990. Ward versus, Ward\nversus... I forgot the last name for the moment. I can talk about that case a long time, but that\u2019s\nsort of the summary. Garnet, now both of the Wards... Eugene died while we were in the\nSupreme Court. And then Garnet died a couple of years back. She was a very feisty woman.\nShe claimed... they never, no one else had ever paid any taxes on this property. And they didn\u2019t\nknow that anybody else had any claim to the minerals. She thought they owned the claim.\nWhen we were in circuit court we asserted that, and there was some basis for her claim, because\nwhen the minerals were sold, about 1910, really interesting, by... the local owner, the owner was\nin Johnson County and he sold the mineral rights to a company in New York, that wanted to\ndevelop these minerals. And he sold... and they promised to pay him with... they gave him\nshares of stock and said they would buy those shares back once their company was in operation.\nAnd a year went by and nothing happened, so he sued them to get his money. And actually in\nthat suit someone, a deposition of him was taken. And when he sold that property he said, \u201cI will\ngive you the minerals and you may mine that property, but I want you to leave all the walnut,\nchestnut, and hemlock trees over ten inches,\u201d which made it impossible to strip mine. And so we\nactually argued initially it was not a Broad Form Deed, that this deed specifically was limited to\ndeep mining because it was impossible to strip mine, because he had said that. And on\ndeposition, which was... the deposition from his testimony was still in the courthouse. And in\nthe deposition he reasserted that, that he wanted those trees left alone. And that you could use\nthe smaller timbers as people did in deep mines. Timbers under ten inches were used for\nshorings in the deep mine workings. So that made good sense. He was saying, \u201cYou can have\nthe saplings, but I want those good trees left.\u201d So our local judge agreed with that and said,\n\u201cYou can\u2019t mine.\u201d So they appealed to the Court of Appeals and they won. The Court of\nAppeals, the intermediate appellate court said, \u201cWell that\u2019s just what these deed provisions say,\nbut the mineral owner still has the paramount right to mine under our decisions.\u201d So then we\ntook that case to the Supreme Court on discretionary review. We asked them to review that.\nThey took the case and so the amendment was argued, we argued the amendment on that. So\nGarnet, they never, they did not... anyway, when these minerals were sold, he did some, there\nwas very careful, plats were laid out and surveyed. And it was not, and when they filed this\nmining permit and claimed they owned the minerals where Garnet and Eugene lived, they didn\u2019t\n82\ndo that very well. Where they claimed their boundaries looked like went... she could make, we\ncould make a colorable assertion that that didn\u2019t coincide with those original plats. Because they\ndidn\u2019t prove that, clearly she should have had the right to those minerals, but we lost on that\nclaim. It\u2019s just an aside, but I think she probably didn\u2019t own the minerals. It couldn\u2019t clearly be\nshown that she owned the minerals. But we won the case, so that\u2019s the law. It was a big, nice\neffort to have been involved in and I think one of the important achievements that we made\nalong with many other cases I think the program\u2019s been able to bring.",
        "A: I doubt it. I mean I think we probably thought we might be here two or three years. It was a real\nbig transition for her, because she was, had never lived in a rural area or a town the size of\nGastonia, which was 25,000 or 30,000. She was from Philadelphia and had lived in Washington.\nI mean she had been in Southern communities, but she wanted to... she said if... when I looked\nfor a house, she wanted a sidewalk that she could roll the baby carriage on and be near a\nshopping area, not live out at David for example.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, I found a house in town that was kind of in a residential area. It\u2019s not where we live\nnow. We moved after ten years, out a little ways, near a school where Michael was going to\nelementary school. The kids went to, both of them went to a day care center at David. In David,\nthe development of the David community was another really major part of what we did in terms\nof economic development in a small community that we were able to purchase for a local\ncommunity development group. Help the development in that town.",
        "A: David is about nine miles from Prestonsburg and in the 1930s, especially, it was a booming coal\ntown. It was what they called a model community, sort of like Wheelwright, or many of these\ncoal, you know most... Floyd county and this area had a number of coal camps. They were\nbasically company towns, because a company owned the homes where the people lived and the\ncompany paid them with scrip. And they owed their soul to the company store, as it were. But\nsome of the homes were quite nice. I mean, I think they were very nice communities and very\nclose communities. There were some employers that were better than others. And there were\nthe mine wars in Harlan County, all of the difficult history involving unionization. Where it was\nsuccessful, and where it wasn\u2019t. But David, the mine there was the Princess Coal Company.\nAnd David was mentioned, was named for a fellow named David Francis, who when I came\nhere, lived in Huntington. He still, that family owned the minerals. The only swimming pool in\nthis area, in this end of town was at David and people used to go out there to go swimming on\nthe train. They had a little airport. They had a school. It was a very vibrant mining community\nand when the mine closed in the \u201840s, it kind of went downhill. And it was purchased by... the\nbuildings, not the minerals, but the town of David, the ridge around it and the homes that were\nthere were, was purchased by a small group of businessmen here in Prestonsburg. And people\npaid rent to them. And a group of Catholic priests from St. Vincent\u2019s Mission came to David in\n83\nthe late \u201c60s and *70s and started teaching bible school and some literacy training. And\napparently they were approached by the businessmen to see if the mission was interested in\nbuying the town. I think they viewed themselves as absentee landlords and all they did was\ncollect the rent. They saw the water system going downhill. They didn\u2019t really, weren\u2019t\ninterested in developing the community. The homes were in pretty bad shape. They weren\u2019t\nreally slum lords, they just weren\u2019t doing anything to keep it up. It was a private water system.\nSo the Father, Matthew at the time, one day came to see me, and told us about the offer to buy\nthe town. They weren\u2019t interested in doing it, but they wondered whether we could, whether the\ncommunity might be able to buy it in some way, if they, we could figure out how to, help them\nfigure out how to do that. So, I asked a law student to do some research and we got a little help\nfrom the National Economic Development Law Center\u2019. And we decided, we put together an\neconomic development, a corporation, a Kentucky corporation. And we started having some\ncommunity meetings in David. And there was a company... the town wasn\u2019t working, but Island\nCreek Coal Company still had a store that they owned. The old company store. There was a\nfellow named Tiller\u00ae, who ran the store and who also, he read the Wall Street Journal. And he\nwas a very smart guy. He was an interesting man. So, they elected him as Chair of this group.\nAnd he became the first Chair of our little community development corporation. We didn\u2019t own\nanything yet, but they started planning. We started looking into the possibility of financing the\npurchasing of the town and how it might work. The problem was there was no water, the water\nsystem was unreliable. They had a pump that was literally held together by chicken wire. They\nwere afraid to take the gamble unless they had water. So we were sort of diverted for a couple of\nyears until we were able to figure out with our local area development district how to, ultimately\nwe were able to get a grant, which helped one of the existing water districts bring water to a\nnumber of their new customers in the rural part. The Beaver-Elkhorn water district supplied\nwater to a lot of the homes on Right and Left Beaver Creek. By getting them additional, those\nlines, they agreed they would run a line over to David, an extension. And we established a\nDavid Water District and went to the Public Service Commission to get approval to bring water\nto David through the water district, which would buy its water from this Beaver-Elkhorn Water\nDistrict that agreed to extend its lines. And when we got that done, by that time Mr. Tiller had\nbeen transferred to somewhere, Western Kentucky. People were afraid the corporation was\ngoing to go in, go down, because he was really sort of a driving force. But there was an old coal\nminer, retired, who had black lung, named Ashland Howard, whose nickname was \u201cHawk\u201d.\nAnd he had the energy and the spirit and the\u2014even though he may not have had the formal\neducation\u2014to push this group along. And he took over, became the Chair of that group. And\nwe then, once we got the water district in, we put together a financing package, where we had a\nfirst mortgage from the local bank here in Prestonsburg and a second mortgage from a group in\nWashington, called the Housing Assistance Council. And the idea was that if the corporation\ncould buy the property, all of David, then the renters could buy their homes in turn and the local\nbank would make those mortgages. So the bank would turn its money over quickly and get its\nmortgage paid back as people bought their houses. And the Housing Assistance Council in\nWashington helped, encourages developments of this sort. They were, I think we paid them back\ntwice as fast. So, we were able to purchase the town. We had another lawyer, by that time I had\nanother lawyer named Kay Adrion, who works over in Virginia now as a private practitioner.\nAnd she helped sort of put the deal together. And then after the town... we did all, this was a\n>? National Economic Development and Law Center (NEDLC), Oakland, California.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Claude Tiller\n84\nlarge amount of legal work. Public Service Commission, all this deed work. And we were also\nable to get the corporation to realize they needed to get some staff people. So we helped them to\nwrite a Vista grant to get a Vista out there. At the same time a young man named Danny Greene\nhad come to David and started a, at home, he had taken in some foster care kids. He came down\nas a volunteer with the Mission. And he started this David school, which over the years has\nobtained some national recognition for helping high school dropouts. He realized there was no\nreal alternative school here. Kids would drop out, that was the end of it. The schools really just\nwiped their hands of them. He bought the old store building. We bought most of the town, ridge\nto ridge. And he bought several others and was able to get some financing for the old store,\nwhich became the school. There\u2019s now a brand new building, which 1s very beautiful, that has\nbeen built in the meantime, and the story of the school, I\u2019ve been on their Board and we\u2019ve done\na lot of things together. But afterwards the corporation built and developed about twenty-five\nnew homes, Farmer\u2019s Home owned... put up new houses where the old ones were, had\ndeteriorated in one of the hollers. It\u2019s a very nice, attractive town now. It was sort of the\nAppalachian, we had this big battle over a strip mining permit at one point. There was a large\nblock of coal left underground. I said strip mining. There were some strip mining attempts that\nwe were able to fend off. But there was also a large amount of coal that had not been mined\nbecause they hit water in the mine. There was an attempt to re-open that, to start, to get a permit\nto mine that block of coal. And Danny and the community got very upset about that. And so we\nopposed that permit and there was a lot of community pressure, a lot of help. And thankfully\nthat was, we were able to fend that off. But we\u2019ve been very much, you\u2019ve had deep mining and\nstrip mining and coal truck traffic, all the problems that you see all over, in one little spot here in\nDavid. You have the craft co-operative as a little, as a new, which has become fairly successful.\nIt\u2019s anice community. There were actually, we had plans to develop other parts of David, to\nexpand it, but basically the community sort of decided it didn\u2019t want to get any bigger. It\u2019s a\nvery interesting place. And we learned a great deal and I think had a lot to be proud of in terms\nof what the community did and the role that we were able to play, because they could never\nafford it, that sort of legal work, help.",
        "A: Well, I think what I\u2019m doing now has been in many ways has been most fulfilling over the last\nthirty years. Working with the Civil Rights Division was a great opportunity to learn to practice\nlaw and to do something very worthwhile. The big difference is that in the Civil Rights\nDivision, we didn\u2019t live in those communities and that we came and went. Whereas, and I have\ngreat admiration for the people who stayed there and their courage and how difficult their lives\nwere. The lives, the life we\u2019ve had for the last thirty years in Prestonsburg has been here. And I\nwouldn\u2019t at all compare myself to the African-Americans who lived in those communities and\nthe life they had and how difficult that was, because we are white. And we live 1n an area where\n85\nthere are very few African-Americans. And I think their life has been difficult at times although\nit\u2019s gotten much better. I mean there is also a fair amount of blatant racism in this particular\narea, and some of it is direct racism. But over the years I\u2019ve been able to recruit, at least the only\npracticing attorney in Eastern Kentucky right now, is the woman who has my office in Jackson\".\nShe\u2019s been there a number of years. And we\u2019ve tried unsuccessfully to recruit some others,\nbecause they don\u2019t...",
        "A: Yeah, African-American lawyers, and paralegals. You have to have a support system as a\nminority person to live, I think, wherever you are. It\u2019s difficult to be alone. And in Hazard we\nhave a church to which Cynthia from Jackson belongs. And there are some black communities\nthat are concentrated in our areas. So the few people who have looked, that have really taken a\nlittle look at it, I think were, very cautious about, or were not convinced they could feel\ncomfortable living here. We do have a black secretary in Barbourville and one in Harlan and we\nhave a paralegal in Richmond, Richmond having a fairly much larger African-American\ncommunity. But the population is about ninety-eight percent white in our thirty-seven counties.\nBut I think the point I wanted to make was that we do, legal services offices are in the\ncommunities where our clients are and so you are much more associated and you are a part of\nthat community. I think we\u2019re a lot closer to our clients and you get to know your clients. And\nyou get to see the problems and live with the problems from day to day. Not to say that all of us\nare poor, but I think after your kids, especially when your children get into the schools, you\nbegin to feel that you have much more of a stake in trying to develop, do something about that\ncommunity. You find other parents who really want the best thing for their children, even\nthough it may be what we\u2019re doing in court is not always popular. Maybe our value systems are\nnot on the same track as the other lawyers who for a large part are driven by the money they are\ngoing to make in private practice. They do some good things in private practice along the way,\nbut generally in the social structure people are driven by money. So, I feel that the work we do,\nwe represent about 7,000 clients a year and much of the work we do, whether for each of those\nclients, the case we help them on is the most important thing in the world, whether you\u2019 ve got to\ntalk about an abused spouse or someone who\u2019s about to be evicted from an apartment or\nsomeone who we\u2019re helping with social security benefits or something small, or whether we\u2019re\ninvolved in some major issue involving the Broad Form Deed or safety discrimination, the cases\nthat tend to get the headlines. Or working on black lung, working on trying to help make black\nlung regulations more responsive, little more liberal, where more than five percent of the claims\nare approved. Or something like David. Each of those are a real, I think, positive contribution to\nhelping people lead better lives and making the society a more just one. So, I think it\u2019s, you\nasked me a while ago did I think we were going to be here thirty years when I came and I said I\nthought we\u2019d be here maybe two or three years. But I think the work has been so challenging\nand the opportunity to do this work has been a real privilege, that I always say we\u2019re fortunate at\nleast to be paid for doing something we want to do. And the government, state and federal\ngovernments are willing to provide funds to do it. I think the newer, our younger lawyers give\nup a great deal to work for us, because they are working at very low salaries and many of them\nhave large loan re-payments. They start at 25,000 dollars a year and some of them have really\nhuge debts of 80-90,000 dollars to their law schools. We have a small loan re-payment program\n6! John is referring to Cynthia Elliott, who was the only practicing Black attorney in Eastern Kentucky.\n86\nnow that helps them, up to 2,000 dollars a year. But they\u2019re the ones in a way who are, I think,\nmaking a substantial sacrifice to work. I mean you\u2019d hope that the government, we can do better\nthan that. That eventually we could work out, and develop more programs that would encourage\npeople to spend their lives in this sort of work. But I think it\u2019s been so, in part satisfying and\nchallenging and all those adjectives, that I\u2019ve enjoyed it. I probably, there may have been times\nthat Jean might have wondered whether we wouldn\u2019t be better off going for a better educational\nsystem for our kids. Michael was academically very gifted and sort of ahead of the pack. And\nwe had our difficult times, early times with... one of the teachers asked him to explain\nHanukkah, the Jewish holiday one day, and when he, I think the, some kids teased him while he\nwas doing that, made it a little difficult. Or when he was first learning to...",
        "A: Presenting this Jewish ceremony. I don\u2019t remember all the details of it, but it hurt him because\nhe was doing it at their request. And I think it was strange. It was a time when they were still,\neven still doing bible...\nEnd of Tape 7, Side A\n87\nTape 7, Side B",
        "A: I remember the teacher virtually threatened him because he couldn\u2019t keep the crayons within the\nlines, which is still a problem for some children. I mean she was more concerned about his\ndrawing, keeping the crayons in the lines. And what, how that would, then realizing how, what a\nnegative reaction this could have on a child, who was basically an academically-gifted young\nboy. But you know, those were... the teacher eventually left, and we, I think we were fortunate\nthat we had some teachers who saw how bright he was and that he began, that he was able to get\nthe best for himself, was able to do quite well. And we had a principal who wanted, who was\nvery interested in the best, in providing good education for mountain kids, and who encouraged\nJean to help start a Gifted and Talented program in the school. And he never, there wasn\u2019t a\nsingle swing on the yard when we first came there. And so we put together a little committee\nand gradually got a coal company to do some grading and developed a wonderful playground\nwith the PTA, on the school grounds. And that he just, his name was John Pitts. He couldn\u2019t\nfigure out where he wanted to put the swings, so he hadn\u2019t put them anywhere. But he just\nneeded some help. And you know, and I think as people realize that what you want is the same\nthing they want. That what you\u2019re trying to do is really not a turnover, turn everything upside\ndown, that we\u2019re filing law suits every time... but what we\u2019re trying to do 1s help the community\nand be good citizens. Then you begin to feel that people are on your side, even if the few\nlawyers aren\u2019t, and that we have a lot of support in this community. And I remember in our PTA\nwhen the movement first started to put the Ten Commandments up on the walls of the\nclassrooms, which is something that\u2019s come back today again. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the\npaper, the Harlan County Board of Education voted to put the Ten Commandments on the walls,\neven though it\u2019s against the law and the Supreme Court has said you cannot do that. We had a\ndiscussion in our PTA, a very thoughtful discussion. And we had, there was, we had at least one\nfamily of Indians, not Native Americans, but from India. A surgeon, whose daughter was in\nMichael\u2019s class. And, you know, there were people, initially the reaction is what\u2019s wrong with\nthe Ten Commandments? They\u2019re perfectly good commandments. And you know, I could say,\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re the foundation of our faith as Jews, but they may not be the foundation of our\nIndian friends, and religions differ. And I would be the last person to say there\u2019s anything wrong\nwith the Ten Commandments, but they don\u2019t belong on the wall of the school right now.\u201d And\nthe attorney... at the time, they were waiting for the Attorney General to come out for an\nopinion. So, the resolution at that meeting was to wait until the Attorney General came out with\nan opinion. And people were quite comfortable with that. I\u2019m sure that if we hadn\u2019t been there,\nand I mean the point was... that was let\u2019s see, twenty years ago, that people accepted what we\nhad to say, and were respectful of what we had to say, and were willing to wait. And that\nwouldn\u2019t be always the case, I think, where you had folks who are very strong in their... and I\u2019m\nsure some of those people are, were members of fairly doctrinaire, Baptist and... churches, but\nthey were willing to say, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait.\u201d And I think those things always give you some hope, I\nmean give you cause for feeling good about, being proud of the people you are with. I mean I\u2019m\nnot always proud of everything everybody does, and you always wonder, but... So I think as we,\nboth Jean and I, got involved in a lot of educational advocacy work, that we sort of knew we\nwere here. Then when our daughter, Annie, did not do well academically as she got into high\nschool and had a lot more... she 1s a very social person and was friends with people who were\n88\nvery, very poor and friends with people who were quite rich. And she had a lot of kids who were\nfriends who were on the fringy group. And she was in high school and was not doing well. So\nanyway, she went to the David School, which didn\u2019t have many girls at the time and they were\nable to take her. She hadn\u2019t dropped out. She did really well there and thought the David School\nwas a wonderful place because of the one on one. And she had a very good math teacher who\nhelped her with her math. We got her back on the right track, academically. But it was very\nhard for me to take her... I mean I felt, I really wanted to stick with the public school, public\neducation. But they were losing her, and she was a good example of a student who should have\nstayed, who had, at least then, average academic skills, but was just an example of someone that\nfell between the cracks because the teachers were not paying attention. Which is something, I\nthink, we\u2019ve changed. And I think that we\u2019ve always continued to be involved in these kind of\nefforts to try to help out our schools and make this region a better place. And I think that\neducation has a lot to do with that. And I think we see in my work here in the office, we do a lot\nof work, we represent parents of kids who have special needs and the schools tend to, they don\u2019t\nwant to bother with them so often, unless you have a very committed teacher, who\u2019s going to\nwork with students like that. It\u2019s much easier to move them out of the way. So when we, I think\na lot of the cases we\u2019ve done, the consumer cases, all the cases I\u2019ve made reference to, the black\nlung work, where it\u2019s hard for, the organization wouldn\u2019t have anyone to assist them in these\nvery technical fields without spending a great deal of money. Helping them to write regulations\nthat will benefit them. AII these things have been really a great place for me to work and for the\nlawyers who worked in this program. I mean I think people who work in legal services across\nthe country who devote their lives or their careers to serving the poor, are a wonderful group, I\nhave a lot of admiration for them. So it\u2019s always nice for me to come to work every day, because\nit\u2019s such a good place to be.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, many people in this area don\u2019t know, really have had no experience with Jews at\nall, or Quakers for that matter, I think. And so in the more recent years, I don\u2019t spend a lot of\ntime at it, but I\u2019ve been to church groups and talked about Judaism. Maybe the Klan, the few\nmembers of the Klan, when they get together, their constitution talks about the white, Aryan\nrace, and Jews, money-making Jews, and that kind of thing. I\u2019ve never been conscious, really of\nanti-Semitism here in any major way. I know that those, I know that people who are strong\nChristians do feel that if you\u2019re not saved, you\u2019re going to Hell. And so they have a real concern\nabout us, whom they may like and they don\u2019t want us to go to hell. And they would like us, I\u2019m\nsure, to be saved.",
        "A: No, I think... Annie probably went to more church, was, went to church more, because she spent\nmore weekends with friends who went to church, some of whom are more evangelical than\nothers. We have been invited to many churches. And we have gone to, more to the Presbyterian\n89\nchurch than others because, probably the Catholics and the Presbyterians have run more\nprograms for poor people. And in this area over time, St. Vincent\u2019s Mission came in here. Or\nmaybe not the Catholic church as such, but the ministry. They brought more, while they are also\nattempting to increase the number of Catholics in their ranks, I think their message of being\nsocially concerned has been stronger than that of the other faiths, even though they are a\nminority. The Presbyterian church was always very active with its Christian Service ministry.\nAnd it\u2019s not as fundamental as the Baptist church and some of their beliefs with respect to Jesus.\nSo when Jean, as I said from the beginning was working with the Meals on Wheels program and\na number of their related programs in this Christian Service ministry, we\u2019ve gone there many\ntimes. But there\u2019s never been any real, I mean we\u2019ve known all of their ministers. In recent\nyears there\u2019s been a much more sharing between rabbis and ministers. Now here, the Ministerial\nAssociation, they had a Catholic priest that was here when we first came, named Father... oh\ngosh, what\u2019s his name? Getting a little tired. Young Catholic priest was here. It will come to\nme ina moment. And they wouldn\u2019t let him in, wouldn\u2019t let him in the Ministerial Association.\nHe\u2019d tend to wear moccasins around and wear blue jeans and was always a little bit out front on\nsome of the social issues, working with welfare folks, and asking people about this being the way\nJesus would have it. He finally, I think, five or six years later, put a Christmas card in the paper,\nwishing all of his ministers well at Christmas, hoping they would have a nice Christmas. He\nguilt-tripped them into it. They finally let him in. But there was that kind of thing, but there\u2019s\nnever really been, I don\u2019t know, people have always been very nice to us maybe because, more\nabout who we are than what the religion is. I\u2019m sure they would welcome our, many of the\nchurches would have welcomed the conversions. Or the fundamental religion, especially.\nWe\u2019 ve been to many funerals, I mean, when you get to these, especially when you go to a funeral\nwhere they preach over, about salvation and that you simply, you know, you\u2019re doomed if you\u2019re\nnot saved. And they\u2019re looking at you. (Laughing.) But they mean well. I mean that\u2019s what it\nis, they feel like we\u2019re going to be lost if this doesn\u2019t happen.",
        "A: Yeah, well we, while the kids were, we sort of maintain the Jewish tradition, Friday nights,\nSaturday, not every Friday night, but especially when everybody is together. And we go to\nservices now more regularly since we go to Williamson West Virginia, for the Jewish services.\nThey are on Sunday night, as I mentioned. It\u2019s a rabbi comes down from Huntington, so he has a\nFriday night service on a Sunday night. The Quakers meet monthly in somebody\u2019s home. And\nof course you can have a Quaker meeting whether you have three people or three thousand,\nbecause they are silent meetings for worship. And people get up and say something during the\nsilence, if they are led to say something. And it may go on for half an hour, it may go the whole\nhour and nobody says anything. Or it maybe that someone has a comment that is on their mind\nand many people speak. In the more organized communities in the East, you have this group of\noverseers. I mean the meeting has to have an administration with dues and Sunday school and\nall of that. But this is a very informal group. There is an annual meeting of Quakers in\nKentucky which we haven\u2019t been to in a while. But the participants here are generally a couple\nin Hazard and a woman who teaches at the Pine Mountain Settlement School and a woman who\nis a doctor in Hyden, who is in her seventies and has been there for maybe twenty-five or thirty\nyears, I guess, who\u2019s a teacher. But he was a doctor and she\u2019s a Quaker, very interesting person,\n90\nwho lives up a holler in Hyden in a small house with... all these hundreds of goldfinches that are\nusually there. A very nice location. And then there have been some Mennonite volunteers, who\nhave come to Quaker meeting during their volunteer period. So the group is a little bit fluid,\nalthough there is this permanent group, if you will. The couple in Hazard work for the rural\nhealth system and they\u2019 ve been there for several years. So they meet once a month and they\nwere in Prestonsburg a few weeks ago. The next time will be in Hazard or at the Pine Mountain\nSettlement School. That woman is in her seventies, also.",
        "A: And I always go. I\u2019m a very big fan of Quakerism. I mean I would not, not to convert. It is a\nvery tolerant religion, built on faith, and the light that shines on everyone. And I don\u2019t know that\nthere\u2019s a great enormous amount of difference, except that it\u2019s built on the teachings of Jesus,\nessentially. But they don\u2019t dwell on salvation and the other parts of it. I think they really dwell\non living your life out in a full life and serving others, and the principles of humanity that I share\nand that I feel good about. So I think it\u2019s been pretty easy for us to adapt to each other. I\u2019ve\nprobably spent more time now with the Quaker part of it. I really haven\u2019t studied Quakerism that\ncarefully. I\u2019ve read a lot of books and probably will some time, as I should read about Judaism.\nAnd I haven\u2019t done as much of that also, a little here and a little there. But I\u2019d like to that a little\nbit more. I\u2019ve got plenty of other things I also want to read. Right? Like you do.",
        "A: They were involved in both, although as I said, Michael, we didn\u2019t have Quaker meetings back\nthen. We had some of the state gatherings. This group is a relatively recent phenomenon of the\nlast three or four years. It was really sparked by the people in Hazard. And we didn\u2019t go\ninitially. We were when Michael, I guess in our earlier years, we pretty much went to services in\nAshland and took Michael when he was little, and Annie. They were the only children their age\nat that time. And we would go fairly regularly, but we always went during the Jewish holidays.\nAnd the Quaker tradition doesn\u2019t have a lot of formal ceremony with it as Judaism does around\nthese holidays. So we would celebrate those and we would go to Passover. We had Passover\nSeders at our house, which Jean and maybe the others would, she did the cooking and became\nfairly well-versed in what\u2019s involved. Did some reading and embarrassingly probably knows\nmore about some of those traditions now than I do. But that\u2019s the way the kids were raised. And\nMichael, as I told you, I spent more time with Michael probably talking about, doing sort of a\nlight Sunday school lesson every Sunday for several years. That was part of our tradition at\nhome. I didn\u2019t do that with Ann Louise for, I\u2019m not sure exactly why. I think... who knows\nwhy? But I didn\u2019t. More recently she has become much more interested in both. I think she\nwas, as Jean was relating to you, very concerned about the Nazis, the history, the danger that it\nposed and still is worried about some goofy Klansperson coming to the house and doing\nsomething.",
        "A: Yeah. She has become, both of the kids will be home for the Jewish holidays, I think. I don\u2019t\nknow about Annie, for sure, because she works on Saturdays. But neither of them... and\n9]\nMichael will be home. Rosh Hashanah falls on a weekend. I don\u2019t know if he will come on\nYom Kippur. Now someone would say, \u201cHow could you work on Yom Kippur?\u201d And he might\nor might not. But those are their lines to draw. I mean it would have been unthinkable for\nanybody to work on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur when I was growing up. And so they still\nhave to find their own, figure out, I guess, what they want to do in terms of their religious... or\nhow religious they\u2019re going to be. Either way, either way, I think though Annie\u2019s now becoming\na little more interested. Although she hasn\u2019t been going to the synagogue in Louisville. She and\nI went to a Unitarian service together in Lexington a couple of years ago. But we feel okay\nabout it.",
        "A: Like a prayer? (Laughing.)",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t imagine anybody listening to all these tapes. I was saying to Jean, \u201cMaybe...\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cWell, can I listen to them?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, you wouldn\u2019t want to listen to all this.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWell, maybe somebody wants to listen to this history years from now or maybe the kids\nwould want to look in some archive, right?\u201d No, it was nice of you to be interested to do it, to\nlisten to it. And I\u2019m sure we still haven\u2019t covered a lot of ground. But it would be true if I did\none of you, even though you probably wouldn\u2019t think so, but we all could spend a lot of time.\nI\u2019ve just been fortunate, probably to have had such an interesting career in these two legal jobs,\nwith the Division and with legal services. And now that I\u2019m also interested in the Science Center\nand other community activities that we\u2019ve been involved in. Just have a lot of interests that I'd\nlike to pursue, that happen to be, I think, in areas that can affect other people and help them in a\npositive way, besides me. And I like to do it, so I think that\u2019s been a real reward. And you can\ncome back in thirty years, and maybe when [ hit a hundred, I'll reflect on the last forty.\nEnd of Tape 7, Side B\n92\nTape 8, Side A",
        "A: Tape eight?",
        "A: Well, I mean my role was, at the time was as Chief of the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights\nDivision. Because this involved the National Guard and potentially other police officials, state\nofficials, the Justice Department is called in to investigate. Potentially there is a federal crime\nwhen police officials act illegally or summarily and what we call summary punishment by not\narresting, for example, students who do something wrong, but rather they overreact and shoot or\npunish or beat whoever the victim might be. So, when this happened, this incident happened and\nwas called to our attention, my job was to write a request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\nto investigate, to see whether a violation of federal law had occurred. And so, that being May\nof\u2014how many years ago?\u20141970, thirty years ago, I drafted that request, which then was sent\nout under the name of the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, who I believe\nat the time was Jerry Leonard. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have to go dig it out or I don\u2019t even know if I\nhave a copy of it, you know, it would be fairly thorough about where they would be interviewing\nany witnesses who were there and whether they, the police officials in fact were threatened or\nthere was any reason that would justify their having used force in shooting those students who\nwere killed. There was a long grand jury convened after I left. As I recall it was actually\ninconclusive. I think there was no federal trial. I think there were civil trials later which I\u2019m not\nsure, it seemed to me they may have recovered some damages for the families of the children, of\nthe students who had been killed. It was just a very tragic event. There were others at the time.\nI recall, I think when we were speaking, I had seen an article recently before I gave the\ncommencement address here at Prestonsburg Community College, which happened to have been\nwritten by the President of Kent State University. It was sort of a memorial column or just\nrecalling those tragic events and the fact that they were in the memory of the President and\npeople who were at Kent State now. And that the school itself had made great progress in the\nintervening years and that this awful event was a milestone, obviously, in the history of the\nschool, which sort of marred its reputation, along with... or which they felt marred its reputation.\nIt was not forgotten, but that since then the school had progressed and had moved into the age of\ntechnology and that she was very proud of their progress. And I happened to be particularly\nmoved by the way that she ended the column, which was that in this age of technology, it was\nimportant not to lose our humanity. And so I was, used her, some of her quotations in\nconcluding this address that I gave to the local students. And it reminded me that it was also sort\nof one of the last things we did, that I did at the Justice Department, before we left on our\nvacation, but really left. And then were headed for Appalachia.\n93",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t, no. My job basically, if... had I stayed, the office, the lawyers who worked with\nme and for me as Chief of the Criminal Section... after, the way those things would work 1s that\nwhen the FBI goes through its investigation and prepares a report, those are usually turned over\nto the United States Attorney for prosecution or for determination of whether a crime has been\ncommitted. And generally then if there is some conflict, in other words when the officers say, \u201cI\nthought that it looked like the student had a gun and that we had to shoot the student or we would\nhave been killed,\u201d those factual disputes, someone has to resolve them by generally going to a\ngrand jury, which is what happened. And then either the U.S. Attorney co-operatively with\nlawyers from the Civil Rights Division, or... would make that presentation, but we left. That\nwas at the point after I had authored and drafted this report, this request, was when we left. And\nso the investigation really went on and I believe one of my colleagues, Jim Turner, who was sort\nof one notch up in the hierarchy as a Deputy Attorney General, was sent out there and that he\nspent several months, along with reviewing the reports and working with the grand jury and then\ndetermining whether someone should be indicted or not. I want to think that there was never,\nthat there were no federal indictments, but I may be wrong. It seems to me that was one of the\nsad things, that this was one of those, one of those sort of inconclusive... there were, on the face\nof it you would think that there was no reason to shoot students, because they were certainly not\narmed. And that they got caught in the, were victims of what happened. But I\u2019m not sure that\nanyone was actually ever accused of having, of criminally having done this. That there was\nsome evidence in the heat of the moment that these folks felt threatened, their lives were\nthreatened. And that they, while they may have been negligent or they may have, whatever they\ndid, that there was enough justification to make them question, that they made a bad decision,\nbut it wasn\u2019t, certainly wasn\u2019t intentional on their part. And that it may have been enough to\nwarrant civil proceedings. But that\u2019s the way those things always, you know, went. And so in\nother circumstances, like when I was in the Houston case, we also asked the FBI to investigate\nand to assist us in determining, looking at records and other areas. And then the lawyer who is\nresponsible for the case, as I was in the Houston case with other lawyers working with me and\nwere working under my direction, then I would present the case to the judge. That\u2019s how those\nthings work. We\u2019re done. I didn\u2019t do any more in Kent State. I mean that was, most of that then\nhappened after I left. So it was a memory and this article that I happened to see in the newspaper\nsort of jogged my mind back. It\u2019s sort of the punctuation mark. It\u2019s the point at which we left.",
        "A: Well, I mean, I think there are lots of times when you wish political decisions were made, were\ndifferent. I mean I think that everyone 1s, that a lot of people are sad about our involvement in\nthe Vietnam War. I was in the war, served during the time of Korea. It was obviously... and as I\nprobably said before, there were lots of reasons I enjoyed the time I spent in the Service. We\n\u00b0 Actually was Deputy Assistant Attorney General.\n94\nmade a lot of very close friends, who I continue to see and hear from, and get together with\nperiodically. And I think you feel that you are doing something worthwhile when you\u2019re in the\nService. And helping this country in a small way. But that I also noted that when, during the\nSuez Canal Crisis, when we were on alert for a week and no one was quite certain which side we\nwere on, and that because the United States hadn\u2019t made up its mind which side we were on, and\nIsrael was one of the partners, was one of the main parties involved in that dispute, the thought\nthat we would be in a conflict with Israel was not very appealing to me, but that it just let me\nknow how much of a, that this was not what I wanted to do (laughing), to be regimented 1n that\nway. So that staying in the Service was not anything that I wanted to do. On the other hand, I\nalways, I think that it\u2019s a very dangerous occupation. And I feel those people who are in the\nMilitary for a career, who really believe that this is an important thing to do, often that we owe a\nlot to people who have been, who have served in our Military, and who have either given their\nlives or come back wounded or who are veterans. And I\u2019m sure now we much, recognize much\nmore the people in Vietnam, who may not have won a war, were nevertheless there because they\nwere doing what they were told to do. And of course a lot of people were willing, were\nConscientious Objectors and didn\u2019t go. My personal feeling is if someone\u2019s a Conscientious\nObjector they ought not to go. And we ought to let them not go. There are plenty of people who\nwant to go or who were willing to go or there were and there were things that could be done. So,\nI don\u2019t know that I, I\u2019m not disillusioned. I\u2019m still very much a, feel very strongly that, I guess\nmaybe it\u2019s a little rhetoric, but I feel that this is still the best country in many, many ways in the\nworld. There are a lot of imperfections with it, that we... and some of the issues that we have to\nresolve are very difficult issues. When we see in this area the economy being as poor as it is.\nWe\u2019ve lost a lot of jobs here. Trying to catch up. What I spoke about at PCC, of course, that,\nthat the Kent State thing related to, I asked, I emphasized to the students how much they should\nbe grateful for being in this free country. It was also the, the week of the graduation was also the\nweek of Law Day, in which we celebrate our freedom and the Constitution under which we live.\nAnd it was also the anniversary of Holocaust Remembrance Day. And it was the anniversary,\nthe thirty year anniversary of Kent State. And I think all of those are messages that we need to\nremember and reflect upon. I think we do have a legal system that really is the basis for the\nfreedom that we have. And a lot of those freedoms are at times tenuous. You worry when the\nKlan, you wish we did not have the Klan around, but the fact that we allow them to exist under,\nin a restricted way still is part of the freedom that we can enjoy. And I think all of those kinds of\nissues sort of tumble around together. And yet we, we have to be, we\u2019re always balancing those\nthings. And I think the political system that we\u2019re under, where we flip back and forth between a\nDemocratic party in control and the Republican party in control at the state and national\ngovernment, kind of keeps everybody off balance, at the state level and the federal level. But it\nseems to make us sort of come out in the middle and even though lots of things go on that we\ndon\u2019t like. I mean I wish we had greater funding for legal services at the state and federal level.\nAnd sometimes Congress, the legislation we have on, that affects welfare moms seems very\npunitive, at times. And I know we could do better with that. We clearly need a better health care\nsystem, there are lots of places where we can improve, where we ought to improve, being as rich\nas this country is. We seem not to regard people, the problems poor people have as seriously as\nwe ought to. Well, that\u2019s a rambling answer. I can\u2019t even remember, it seemed to me that we\nstarted with Kent State and we kind of got into what I was talking about, but it all kind of goes\ntogether.\n95",
        "A: Well, I think that the black church, the name right now escapes me, probably shouldn\u2019t. The\nhundredth anniversary was an event they\u2019d worked on, was quite a significant event for the\nchurch. There are two churches in Wheelwright, Kentucky and this is one of them. And they\nhad been planning this anniversary for some time and have had a series of ministers over the\nyears and it\u2019s a very cohesive community. And I think, probably, one of the reasons they asked\nme to speak was because they related, they knew that I was Jewish and that I had been involved\nas a legal services lawyer and perhaps as a Justice Department lawyer in some civil rights issues\nover time. But also that I was a, that my family had escaped from the Holocaust and they knew\nsome of that history. And I think they analogized it in their own way to the discrimination that\nthey had felt and that they wanted me maybe to reflect upon the f act that there were people who\nwere white and who were discriminated against because they were Jewish or for reasons other\nthan race. But that someone, a family lived in this community that had shared some of that\nhistory that their own families and ancestors had experienced over their lifetime. I know that, I\nthink in the schools, I think that the schools now have made the Holocaust a very much a part of\ntheir curriculum. When I go, I\u2019ve spoken to middle school students and elementary school and\nhigh school students. And when I ask how many of them know who Ann Frank was or whether\nthey have done a unit on Ann Frank, almost every hand goes up in the room. I think that unit is\nprobably done in the fifth and sixth grade and in the seventh grade. And that, but the fact, I think\nteachers tell me, the fact that they see someone who 1s alive and who can come into their class\nand say this is what happened to my family. I was eight years old when they arrested my father\nand took him to the concentration camp. Or I was standing in the courtyard when they were\ndynamiting the synagogue. That is always more, it makes a stronger point than having heard it\nfrom a third person. And if it\u2019s someone in their own community that I suppose has been\nidentified as having some credibility, that doesn\u2019t just make these stories up. I think when you,\nyou always tend to put some faith and trust 1n people that have lived with you a long time, who\nare part of the community. It\u2019s kind of like any other, listening to older, someone described the\nhistory of the May house or the May family or their own family history. When they\u2019ve grown up\nhere it means more. At least I think that\u2019s, whenever you find someone, whether it\u2019s the war, my\nneighbor used to, my neighbor must have been on every beach. He died a few years ago, but he\nwas one of those Appalachian soldiers who was drafted and lived through every beach assault in\nthe Pacific. And even if he tells it in a low key sort of conversational way, it\u2019s very powerful to\ntalk to someone who lived it.\n96\nthere\u2019s some key maybe to your roots which came up in the earlier interviews, too. That you\nmentioned that where you come from and your escape from the Nazis has been a very important\npart of the work that you have subsequently done. Or that it\u2019s something that you\u2019ve kept in\nmind, but we didn\u2019t really go into very much detail about that. Has it been... is that something\nthat you really think about a lot, about the Holocaust era and about your family and about...\nmaybe can you just talk more about that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s with me every day. I think that... and I think I\u2019ve spoken about this before.\nWell, before I forget it, I think in my earlier, when I talked about commencement talks or just\ngenerally about legal services, I really did not speak, talk much about the Holocaust unless I was,\nunless... I mean some of the church groups, when we first came Jean was... we were involved\nwith the Presbyterian church a good bit because they did a lot of social, were more involved in\nlocal social projects. They started Meals on Wheels and Christian Service Ministry that she was\ninvolved with. And so the ministers who knew that we were involved, had Passovers and that I\nwas Jewish and some of that developed into, people, by word of mouth realized that I wasn\u2019t\nborn in this country and that I did have this experience. But it wasn\u2019t, I guess in more recent\nyears, I\u2019ve had more, probably as people learned and as I spoke more about the Holocaust and\nabout being Jewish, that there have been more, there\u2019s been a bit more of an awareness about the\nHolocaust. I think partly because of the Holocaust Memorial and there\u2019s been more publicity\ngenerally about the importance of this whole era and trying to make people remember it and not\nlet it be forgotten. That all probably is part of the reason why this has come up. And I think that\ntying it into Law Day is something that has gotten around among the teachers, that that\u2019s\nsomething I\u2019m willing to speak about or can speak about on Law Day, that may be more\nmeaningful to students than just talking about the Constitution or how the legal system works,\nwhich is the other thing that we generally do when we go to the schools. Well, I don\u2019t have any\ndoubt that the history, that our fleeing from Germany and coming to this country and being\ngrateful for the opportunity to be free here, has sort of moved me into public service work. I\nthink that\u2019s pretty clear. When I was in the military, I think it probably in a way helped move me\nto go to the Service as well. I don\u2019t know that I went into the ROTC, which helped partly also\nwith tuition. Back then it was one of the ways of making Duke affordable, which was an\nexpensive school. But I mean, whether it\u2019s just the rationalization or the reason, I think I\ncertainly felt that being in the Service was one way of trying to help fulfill my, help me give\nsomething back. You can stay out of the Service. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t have to do that. But that was\nduring a time that people also were being drafted. And that if you didn\u2019t want to be an enlisted\nman and wanted to do more with your career in the Service... I guess my bigger decision was\nthat I was, I did have the option after coming out of Duke as a chemistry major, of going to work\nin the Military as being in something that was more science-related back then, working, using\nmy chemistry degree. And I decided really not to do... I decided I was either going to fly and\nthen ultimately became a navigator. Because the pilot training didn\u2019t really work out. But I, so\nI\u2019m sure that was probably, sort of an adventuresome kind of thing to do. It would be more\ninteresting than being in a lab. I knew that I probably might want to sell chemicals some day. I\nreally hadn\u2019t decided my long-term career goals. But I flirted around when I came out of the\nService and went back to Rohm and Haas as a technical representative for a chemical company.\nI don\u2019t know whether we... did we talk about that?\n97",
        "A: So, I flirted around for a little bit at one point about going to Rabbinical school and decided not\nto do that. But I\u2019m sure that what, that going into the civil rights work and being, and wanting to\ndo public service work has been to some extent influenced by, and maybe a large extent,\nprobably a lot of it is subconscious, the fact that I want to feel that the contribution I can make in\nhelping other people in this country, who are not as well off, is just a way of helping to give\nback. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s any sort of sacrifice. I just feel like there are lots of ways to spend\nyour life. And if some people want to spend it practicing law in one way or another, that\u2019s their\nchoice. But it\u2019s a much more, this is part of it, but I don\u2019t feel that I had any obligation to do\nthis. I just, I\u2019m sure that having that history in our family in a major way influenced us, as well\nas... I mean, my father and mom, my father worked in the textile plant. He was a teacher. My\nbrother is in public service, worked for the government all of his life. My sister was an architect\nworking for the state on issues affecting handicapped people, an architectural barriers person.\nSo, and just recently finished law school, and is now thinking about how to use the law degree in\na helpful, probably together... I don\u2019t know that she will be going into legal services, but I... I\nmean I don\u2019t know that my motivations are really, I think all of the lawyers and people who do\npublic service work, whether our daughter, who 1s in social... working on a social work degree,\nand working with developmentally-disabled people now in Louisville. Or our son who works\nwith students who have academic difficulties. Or your or whoever the other people, who are in\npublic service life, who choose to make that their life and feel that service is a way to live out\nyour life in a meaningful way...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side A\n98\nTape 8, Side B",
        "A: Well, I talk about the contrast between a society that we have in this country, where we have a\ngovernment and a nation, which is governed by the rule of law and what happened in Fascist\nGermany where the legal system was basically put aside for a dictatorship. And that the kinds of\nthings that were able to happen in the Holocaust, which was a result of Hitler\u2019s fanaticism. And\nwhat did happen in that dictatorship, and how, again, grateful we need to be and how they,\nstudents, can reflect on or ought to reflect, and their teachers and all of this ought to reflect on\nthe system we have in this country, which would not, hopefully, permit anything like that to\nhappen. That the checks and balances in the legislative, executive and judicial systems would\nkeep that from happening. And that we have, that free speech 1s important and that all of the\nguarantees that we have under the Constitution and under the Bill of Rights are very meaningful\nand that it\u2019s important to talk about them. So I use, I guess the family\u2019s personal experiences,\nand I talk a little bit about the history of how all this came about in the 1930s from Hitler\u2019s rise\nto power. How during the war, I mean even afterwards, how people would like to pretend in\nGermany that no one knew about it and this all sort of just happened and people are looking the\nother way. At least were looking the other way and most, I suspect, did know about what was\ngoing on in the Death camps. That\u2019s what I try to focus on and I think the teachers seem to\nappreciate that and seem to feel that it\u2019s a good way to have their students appreciate Law Day.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember what I said at the time, but the important tenet, I guess, of Judaism is the\nemphasis on justice, study and justice. That the Ten Commandments and having a society where\nbeing just to each other and where you have a governing, legal codes that govern Judaism, which\nare principles of living really. The major ones. I might have said that those principles probably\nhelped to influence me and the work that I do. I remember when we were just talking about Law\nDay, usually when I begin a talk, I talk a little bit about the fact that we\u2019ve been, who we are and\nwho I am, that I\u2019m here in Prestonsburg. We\u2019ve lived in Floyd County all these years. And talk\na little about our legal services agency and try to describe that we do have a system in this\ncountry that provides lawyers for people who can\u2019t afford lawyers, on the criminal and on the\ncivil side. And that what this program, what Appalred and other civil legal services programs do\nand how difficult it is. Many times it 1s basically impossible to navigate through the legal system\nwithout having a lawyer to help you, so that poor people are often on the short end of business\ntransactions and many other people lose rights. They lose benefits to which they are entitled.\nAnd the kind of work that defenses in eviction cases, consumer cases, all the work that we have\ndone. The Broad Form, environmental work. So I try to also mention that. So, going back to\nwhat you were asking me, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s any easier... I mean I think all religions,\nwhether it\u2019s Christianity with Jesus\u2019 sort of different, somewhat little different spin on the loving\naspect of God, that it\u2019s not as much of the retribution and thunder that you read about in the Old\n99\nTestament. But that any, I know there are a lot of people in legal services and folks have written\nabout, who, even who have had backgrounds in Divinity School, or who feel that by helping, by\nusing their legal talents to help people who are oppressed or who are poor or have been\ndiscriminated in one way or another, that that is a good way for them to live out their life and\ntheir principles and their values. And providing legal services for low income people, I don\u2019t\nthink that that\u2019s... there\u2019s anything particularly unique about being Jewish in that way. I just,\nprobably anyone who feels that their, that religion and a belief in God is part of their personality\nor their person, would feel the same way about that, I think. I mean, we have people in legal\nservices who are very religious. They\u2019re Catholic, Protestant, Jewish. And we have many\npeople who are not religious, just as, I\u2019m sure, other professions do.",
        "A: In this country? I would like to think that 1t could not happen in this country in our lifetime or in\nanybody else\u2019s lifetime. I think that when you read about any sort of fanatical behavior, when\nyou read about... it\u2019s only been a hundred years or a little more, well a hundred fifty years since\nlynchings were pretty commonplace in the South. And we had a, quote, \u201clegal system\u2019, that was\nnot as... we didn\u2019t have transportation systems, and we lacked a lot of the modern conveniences,\nso that I think our life was a lot more rural. But it seems to me that communities were pretty\nheartless about... I mean that there was, in the South more so than any where else, but on a large\nscale, African-Americans were property. I mean they were property. And anyone, and people\nseemed to accept that in a fairly major way. I don\u2019t know that it would happen just to Jews. And\nobviously the Klan had put Jews and Catholics into a group, blacks. But you know, we see\nthings, we see the American Indian in this country for years having, in not the very distant past,\nbeing treated as a second-class citizen. You see... but in the next fifty years probably the white\npopulation as it is, or, quote, \u201cCaucasian\u201d population, will probably be a minority in this country.\nSo I don\u2019t know. I do think that people can be fairly heartless. I mean we\u2019ve had this, even with\nthe go around with theTen Commandments we\u2019 ve had in this state recently, that we have\neducators and superintendents who don\u2019t seem to get it, and don\u2019t understand or can\u2019t understand\nwhy anyone would object to putting those Ten Commandments on the walls of the school or a\npublic building. I mean that\u2019s always pretty scary to me, and they wield a lot of influence. And\nthey could be leading, they could decide that they\u2019re going to march on any one of us. Any\nlawyer who lived in a local community that promoted, who was representing the other side. I\ndon\u2019t know that you would see anything like what happened in Germany, on that massive a\nscale, where you\u2019re filling boxcars with thousands of people on a schedule that end up being\ncremated and killed and gassed. But I think people can, there are leaders that appeal to emotions\nand that in, just the same as the abortion clinics, you have folks who would like to defend the\n100\nfact that they can kill somebody because their view is different than their own. So I think it\u2019s\npossible and I think it is probable they\u2019II continue to happen as long as you have open gun, as\nlong as gun laws are the way they are. And as long as you have people who believe in these\nfairly, I don\u2019t know, fundamentalist religions. Wars are fought. All the things that we\u2019ve seen in\nthe last few years, and maybe this country 1s a little different because of its tendency to become\nmore homogeneous, both culturally and racially. But you think of all the Tutsis and the Hindus\nand you think Kosovo and you see all of these people and you see massive... as far as they\u2019re\nconcerned it is a Holocaust. Right? I mean they are being killed in massive numbers. We just\naren\u2019t there. I don\u2019t know and you feel pretty helpless over here trying to do anything about it.\nSo I don\u2019t know, we can always rationalize it by saying those aren\u2019t very civilized countries. But\nall of these things seem to be done... I mean look at Israel and the Arab countries. Both sides,\ncertainly the Arabs, think that all of this is for Allah, and most of these massive killings are\nreligious wars. And they are done in the name of God for one side or the other. Or the ethnic\nissues up there in Russia. I mean tanks... so, who\u2019s to say that can\u2019t happen here? I would like\nto think it wouldn\u2019t happen here because of all the different pressures that keep the country\ngoing. For one thing, we\u2019re so materialistic, people want to keep making money and they want\nto keep a society and keep the economy going. And wars and internal fighting and disputes on a\nlarge scale, they ruin countries. I think if it\u2019s nothing more than that sort of selfish self-interest\nand political interest, that people know they\u2019re not going to allow anything of that scale to\nhappen without calling out the National Guard or something. At the same time you see on the\ntelevision, you see all those things that you think somebody was just writing a fiction plot a few\nyears ago, they can happen. Whether it\u2019s biological warfare or some goofy, this computer virus\nstuff. We see that everything is possible with technology. But I don\u2019t know that anyone, these\ndays, in this country, I\u2019m not sure that we would have to fear a Holocaust. I do think that\nminorities who live in fairly isolated situations, I think are always somewhat vulnerable. Here in\nFloyd County now, it\u2019s a nice thing to say, we now have a mosque here in Eastern Kentucky,\nwhich is, I think, a real milestone. And we do have more and more African-Americans and\npeople of other cultures, who have, are finding a home and generally acceptance, at least in some\neconomic, to some economic extent. But I don\u2019t know that they are not always somewhat\nvulnerable. To some extent there are people who are here because the area has needed more\nphysicians and for economic reasons and they are excellent citizens. Whether over time, like the\nosteopathy school or if the economy gets worse, people, they will have become enough of this\ncommunity where they would stay and would speak their mind. I thought they were, they were\ntotally silent during the Ten Commandment debate. I had encouraged some of them to speak\nout, because they were the most affected. So, you, you know, it\u2019s the same way with the Jewish\ncommunities during, the Jewish families that moved South in the earlier days. They stood by,\nthey were in their communities, they were merchants in these towns and they could not join\ncountry clubs and they were being discriminated against. They had African-American maids at\nhome. And they were certainly willing to live in a segregated society, because it was\neconomically favorable to them. I think I may have said that earlier. I think those things are,\nthose are difficult ethical, philosophical issues. But it has to create a certain level of discomfiture\nfor people who are doing that.\non that case, but what were the details of what you were doing exactly on that case? The murder\nof the three civil rights workers.",
        "A: Well, I worked on the case twice. The first time was in the grand jury when I was talking to you\nearlier this morning about the fact that after the FBI has investigated a case, then we get the\nwitnesses together. And after the incident had happened in the summer of \u201964, we had a grand\njury in Mississippi, a federal grand jury. But that was before there were any confessions. And\nSO we went to Neshoba County and the FBI had uncovered a number of other police-brutality\ncases that, where local officials, the sheriff and local police had acted illegally when beating\nblacks, primarily. And we only knew the circumstantial evidence of the killings of these\nworkers. We did not have a confession and so there was not any clear evidence. We did not\nhave an indictment of that. Then there was subsequently a confession. When Jean and I came\nback from... yeah, then the indictments went to the Supreme Court, when there was an issue\nabout, after the confession, when there was an indictment, there was a legal issue about whether\nthese indictments stated a claim under federal law, because they also involved private\nconspirators along with some police officers. That question went all the way to the United States\nSupreme Court. It was decided in 1966, I think, and Jean and I got married in 1967. When we\ncame back from our honeymoon, we, John Doar called me... at the time was I still working in\nthe Southeastern section? He asked me to come down and work on the Mississippi case if I felt\nlike my honeymoon was over. And we were in New York at that point. We\u2019d been down to\nSaint Martin in the Caribbean. And I said to Jean that I just thought probably with this I was\nready to go back to work to try and finish this case.",
        "A: We were, we were still on our honeymoon. We got married in February, 1967 and this was\nFebruary, 1967.",
        "A: We flew back, back. We were out of the country probably ten days and we were going to spend\nanother five, four or five days in New York seeing some plays or something. But when you were\nwere back in this country and this case was ready to go or we were ready to get in and get ready\nfor trial. So I kissed her good-bye and I went to Mississippi. And I spent, specifically actually, I\nprimarily did two things. I spent almost a month interviewing people who were prospective\njurors in the case. Because nowadays they have psychologist, psychological, they have these\njury experts that are sitting, that sit with the lawyers and who\u2019ve done big sophisticated\nbackground checks and they\u2019ve even sometimes tried cases to juries to try them out. They\u2019ll\nhave a mock trial and have a mock verdict. But by learning through the black community, who\nthe members of the white community were that might be trustworthy and who were supportive\nand who thought this was a dreadful thing, this killing of the three workers and who were\nupstanding citizens and who would know people, basically, I created a notebook of information\nabout the jurors. I mean we didn\u2019t know who the twelve would be. You get a list of about forty\nor fifty. And so I collected information on these people by word of mouth primarily. And met a\nlot of people, and then put this notebook together for John Doar, who was my boss and for the\nU.S. attorney for trial, which they used in selecting the jury.\n102",
        "A: They\u2019re chosen out of the jury wheel, at that time in most states, they were chosen off the voter\nlist, the voting lists. You put all the voters... it\u2019s a federal court, so the district is much larger\nthan just a county. So you\u2019re more apt to get people that cover a much larger area. And I think\nthe trial was in Biloxi, in the Southern district of Mississippi with Judge Cox. And so these\njurors were somewhat spread out. I mean it wasn\u2019t all the way across the state, but it was in\nSouthern Mississippi in several counties.",
        "A: No, but there were blacks on the jury, but the blacks were, they were struck. Now I was in some\nearlier trials in the early, when I first came, we had a trial in Georgia involving SNCC workers,\nwho were some voter registration workers, including several of whom were black. And then\nlater with the trial of Fannie Lou Hamer and they were all white jurors. It was really at a time\nbefore, again it was something at the time that was not challenged as being unlawful, the system\nfor selecting jurors and that resulted in no blacks being on the jury. Now this particular jury,\nnow in the Southern District, you would think, probably, that half the people on the jury would\nhave to be or close to half would have to be black, because the voting requirements have been so\nslackened. Because that was another part of this whole civil rights struggle, was they were using\nliteracy tests at the time. I\u2019m pretty sure... and that would make sense, because the number of\nblack voters back then was still very, very small, and so you had very few blacks. And they were\nnot, probably every qualified, voting black was probably in the jury pool. So, I don\u2019t know if\nthey were out of the, let\u2019s say the twelve, that were called initially or fifteen, as they were being\nstruck, there may have been several who were black, but they were struck, so that the jury was an\nall white jury. But I was, of course, felt pretty good, because we got a conviction. So I felt like\nthat work was at last helpful. The other thing that I was, we had always, the way we did our\ntrials in the Civil Rights Division... I may have talked about this before. We\u2019d have two people\ninside the courtroom putting on the case and then the fellows outside the courtroom who were\nresponsible for preparing witnesses and making sure, and having things go right. In the Neshoba\nCounty case, my other responsibility, well there were several others, but my one major\nresponsibility was to firm up the identification of the workers. And that was... of these three\ncivil rights workers who were killed. And that was done through their dental records. We went\nback and found who their dentists were and the dentists\u2019 charts and compared them, in the event\nthat that was in dispute. I don\u2019t think we put the dentists on, and it may be that it was admitted,\nbut we did that. And then there was clothing that had been retrieved from the workers, and the\nwhole issue of proving that they were who we claimed they were, that they had been the\nmurdered workers. And then I did a lot of other, I did some... there were other parts of the case,\nwhere you\u2019re trying to make sure that everything is together. And some of the witnesses were\nnot heard. There were people who, a deputy sheriff at one point picked up a young woman who\nwas an Indian\u2014there was a Choctaw reservation in that area\u2014who was an Indian, and she\noverheard a conversation. But she didn\u2019t speak English. So when we wanted to go talk with her,\nwe had to find an interpreter to try to tell us what she was saying. I think actually she did testify,\n103\nbecause she overheard them saying something that indicated they knew what was about to\nhappen or that they were going to stop the workers when they let them out of jail that night.",
        "A: Right, she just spoke a very broken English and she remembered some phrases that they had said\nwhen she was picked up. They gave her a ride. I don\u2019t remember how we tracked her down, but\nit was something that was helpful like that. The grand jury, I worked on the grand jury a while,\none of my roles was nothing more than a logistician. I was in Biloxi, getting people driving from\nNeshoba County, but the grand jury was sitting in Oxford. And we were moving, I was doing a\nlittle more than that, besides interviewing. I kept taking people to the airport and sending them\nfrom Biloxi to Oxford. Keeping the witnesses going. That took, we had a lot of logistical issues\nin getting, finding these people way out in the country and brining them down\u2014especially\nAfrican-Americans\u2014who had been mistreated, and getting them to the airport and getting them\nup there and back. But then the fact that there was a conviction in this case, John did a, really\nquite a remarkable, did a very, very good job in presenting the case. It was a big effort. It was a\nvery sad thing to kind of work on that.",
        "A: Back then or now or?",
        "A: Oh I think you feel, it always has an impact on you. I think that just for this purpose, you never\nforget the smell of those clothes...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side B\n104\nTape 9, Side A",
        "A: Well, I was just saying in that particular situation I always can picture, we had the clothing put\naway in boxes behind the door. But it was really... the stench of those clothing was so strong,\nthat it was always there. And for some reason that always stuck with me more than the dental\nrecords. Well, you do, you feel very badly for the families, you feel kind of not very forgiving, I\nthink, for the people who did this. And of course, there were some church burnings before that.\nThe atmosphere around, in Mississippi and Neshoba County among the, in the white community\nand among the Klan, that particular group of Klansmen, Sam Bowers\u00ae, the mastermind of this\none, who also was behind the firebombing of another African-American, who was a voting rights\nleader in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Vernon Dahmer, who, they firebombed his house. These\npeople were just pretty evil. They were violent, and just bad people in that sense. So I think you\nhave a, if anything you\u2019re probably driven. I don\u2019t know that I ever felt depressed, I think most\nof us, and at the time this was a pretty highly motivated group of lawyers, who worked in the\nCivil Rights Division. It was a very relatively small group of lawyers in the early \u201860s. It was\nsort of a sidelight, but I mean Congress\u2019s commitment to civil rights was not great either. The\nDivision had very few lawyers working on civil rights cases when I started in 1962. And they\nhad to beg for any money, and so there were very few of us and we worked on these voting\nrights cases, it took an enormous amount of time and it was hard to do more than two or three of\nthem. We\u2019d spend months looking at records and microfilm. And we worked extraordinary long\nhours. He couldn\u2019t understand why people who were family men with children would want to\ngo home at the end of the day and not come back and work at night or work on Saturdays or\nwork on Sundays. Of course, there were some folks who got divorces over that hard work, just\nas they do in the Service, I think. So I don\u2019t know, I think that lawyers get depressed when they\nlose cases. And we lost, we lost many cases in the early stages in the lower courts, voting rights\ncases and others, because the judges themselves were segregationists and were appointed and\ncame out of that society. So we had to appeal their decisions before and they were reversed and\nall of that took time. So, when you work hard, it doesn\u2019t matter what, if you work hard... then\nwhen we knew we were going to lose, it\u2019s... and then you did lose, you\u2019re sort of prepared for it.\nAnd you really are trying to put the case together in the first level, so that it\u2019s a compelling case\nto the next level. And that\u2019s what happened, we overprepared and we generally won, eventually\nwe would win. And then gradually the law started to change. It took a very long time, and so\nI\u2019ve said many times it was fortunate or maybe because of that slow pace and the limited role of\nthe federal government, that somebody like Martin Luther King had to come along. Or that\nblacks had to organize themselves and realize, as so often happens, that people have to organize\nand that movements get started and that direct action has a place. And it all sort of came together\nin this instance around the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That\u2019s when Jean and I met. We were in\nSelma, we were in this case, this voting rights case, this Dallas County case was a case, the first\nvoting rights case under the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that election. I think we may have talked\nabout that before.\n63 Sam Bowers, circa 1925--. As a leader of the Mississippi KKK, authorized the murder of Mickey Schwerner, one\nof the three civil rights workers murdered in Neshoba County, MS, in 1964. Bowers spent six years in jail for his\nrole in the murders. In 1998, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of the black activist Vernon Dahmer.\n105",
        "A: I don\u2019t, not really, I think. There was a very good, made for T.V. movie about that case. I\u2019m\noften asked about \u201cMississippi Burning,\u201d which is a popular movie that came out, which was not\nreally accurate in many ways. But I thought it depicted the hatred of the atmosphere at the time\nfairly well, and some parts of it were there. Jean and I have a, at our house, the painting of the\nsailboat in our living room is from the restaurant called, it was from Meridian, called Wideman\u2019s\nRestaurant, which was where we worked out of the Meridian office, which is close to Neshoba\nCounty. But I don\u2019t think so. I mean, one of the other last things beside the Kent State thing that\nI did at the Civil Rights Division was to, you know after these folks were convicted, then they\nappealed their conviction and it went on. That took a few years. And I think one of the other\nlast things that I did was to file a brief opposing their last motion not to be sent off to prison. I\nwrote the response to that and then they were picked up. Then they finally went to jail. So that\nwas about 1970.",
        "A: Not, it only comes, it comes up, well, my friend Ned Pillersdorf, who is a practicing lawyer here,\nteaches a class on the court system, on I think, civil liberties and the law. And he generally has\nspeakers come in, other judges and I usually come in for a night with him. And I\u2019ve spoken a\nfew other times, but really not very much. And I\u2019m not sure that that many people are aware of\nwhat I did. I mean I don\u2019t particularly publicize it. If I\u2019m giving a speech and somebody\u2019s\nwriting some background about my legal history, theyll generally mention that. But I don\u2019t\nreally do much speaking about it. Usually the schools have a unit on it. There\u2019s a lot of,\ncertainly a lot of written materials and most of those... Taylor Branch\u2019s books quote my boss,\nthere\u2019s a lot in Taylor\u2019s books about John Doar\u2122. And usually when books are written like that,\nthat\u2019s who they are going to write about. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m anybody necessarily. But locally\nif people ask, I will talk about the cases. I mean I\u2019ve spoken a few times, not recently about the\nlegal developments of these, of how we put these cases together and the Voting Rights Act and\nthe impact of the Voting Rights Act. But then I left in 1970 and I\u2019ve been doing this legal\nservices work for thirty years. And unless those things come together somewhere, it\u2019s become\npart of my, sort of distant past, except for reunions of Civil Rights Division lawyers and some of\nthe ongoing contacts I\u2019ve had with people. So not really very much.\n106",
        "A: Well, I think probably what I had reference to was after Richard Nixon was elected and William\nMitchell became Attorney General\u00ae\u00b0, they did not want to continue to seek bussing of students as\na remedy to undo segregation. And bussing, Charlotte had accepted a bussing remedy and\nseveral other states, too. The problem is when you have a segregated community, so that white\nstudents, black students are, if you don\u2019t use something like bussing, you can\u2019t achieve very\nmuch integration, unless you pair up schools where the two housing districts happen to be close.\nWhere they call that pairing of schools. You could pair schools that are in nearby\nneighborhoods. But the Nixon administration, so the Nixon administration really backed, not\nonly on bussing, but they generally felt, I think, that the position of the Department in the past\nhad been too strong towards moving towards integrating classrooms. And they were more\ninclined towards free choice, which would essentially leave student... the schools white and\nblack, with some very few exceptions. And the Houston case was filed right after the Nixons\ncame in and we did ask for bussing as a remedy. And it was the last case that they allowed that\nto go through. In fact, the Assistant Attorney General, who was probably called on the carpet\nabout it a little bit, because it had gone to him and he had approved it. And I don\u2019t know that he\nwas brand new, whether he really focused on it as much as he might have. But the Attorney\nGeneral had to, I think had to sign it as well. We went forward in that case. It was a very large\ncase. Houston was the third-largest school district in the country. I can\u2019t remember, a couple of\nhundred schools. They had, what they had done is spent millions and millions of dollars building\nnew suburban schools outside, on the outer fringes of Houston. At the same time they let the\ninner-city schools decay, so it was really doubly bad. It wasn\u2019t just, in some school districts they\ntried to upgrade black schools to prevent desegregation. In Houston they didn\u2019t care. They spent\nall their money on white schools and let the black schools get worse. So, but then at the same\ntime they bussed white kids past black schools and blacks past white schools. So we asked for, I\nhad an expert from Miami, Florida, who was an expert in school desegregation matters. What a\nminute, maybe he was from Austin, Texas. Mike Stolee. I guess he was from Austin. Well, one\nor the other. And he testified as to the need to bus and that using bussing as a remedy would\nproduce a, basically an integrated school system, with all the advantages that might come, or that\ncould come with that. There was much more to it in the case than that, but basically that was it.\nThe other phenomenon at the time was that the Chicano community was just developing, so that\nit was like we had three donuts. You had a core of inner-city black schools, then you had a\nsmall, growing donut around it of Chicano communities and then you had all the whites on the\noutside. But racially, Chicanos were treated as whites at that time, and probably still are.\nThere\u2019s a designation for themselves, but we were trying to desegregate a school district that had\ntraditionally been black and white. And so one of the things that the judge in the case did, was\npair up some white schools with Chicano schools, which I wasn\u2019t particularly happy about. I\nmean I don\u2019t know that we had achieved very much, as we had hoped to do. There were some\nother things. We didn\u2019t get a lot of bussing, but we got, the Board was required to spend massive\namounts of money to get, to upgrade schools. And the other, probably the best thing that\nhappened was they threw out the School Board. They voted in a new School Board that was\nmuch more moderate. And they got rid of the lawyer who had gotten rich representing the Board\nand keeping the system segregated. This case that I was working on had been filed many years\nbefore that and the NAACP had sort of reactivated it and urged the government to enter the case,\nwhich we did. And so when we moved down there with four or five lawyers, and Jean came\n\u00b0\u00b0 This is a misstatement\u2014John Newton Mitchell (1913-1988) was Attorney General under Richard Nixon, 1969-\n1972. William Dewitt Mitchell was Attorney General from 1929-1933 under Herbert Hoover.\n107\nwith me, we had not been married too long and we rented an apartment, we lived there four or\nfive months getting ready for this trial. And when it was over, we took a big trip and nine\nmonths later our son Michael was born. Actually we went to Canada, up to Calgary and... you\never been up there? Lake Louise, Banff. Wonderful country. Houston, I still sort of scratch my\nhead a little bit. I haven\u2019t kept up with what... there was an appeal of that order. And I wrote\npart of the brief on appeal. Still have it with me. But I always felt a little badly about the limited\nresult of the pairing of the schools, but I think it helped a great deal in the long run in different\nways, to move that system from what it had been, where they had just let the black schools\ndeteriorate into such terrible condition. Then let\u2019s see, Michael was born in 1970, I still had a\nhearing, a pre-trial, I think, not a pre-trial, but a conference right after he was born. We delayed\nit because I expected him to be born in April. So, that was April 1970. I think that\u2019s about it. I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019re thinking about something else in the case.",
        "A: Just a large, urban school case. Took a long time. Lot of records, lots of lawyers working with\nus. And I was able to get Jean to come with me on that, to work on the case.",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t, no, I don\u2019t think I had thought about being out of here. There were a couple of\nthings probably, one was one of the earliest cases that we were involved with, involved the local\nhealth care establishment, for example. There was a federal program in here, that wanted to set\nup what is now a federally funded health care clinic, that Eulah Hall was associated with. But\nthe governing agency was a Community Action agency, which had some public officials and\nlocal doctors, who were either on the Board or very close to the governing Board and they\nbasically didn\u2019t want this thing to do anything. They were going to use it primarily as a taxi\nservice to... they had a trailer, which was fully equipped sitting out, for example, at Mud Creek,\nbut all they used it for was people would go to the trailer and then they\u2019d drive them into\nPrestonsburg to get their medical services from Prestonsburg physicians, that would get money.\nSo, they were reimbursing them for services, but they wouldn\u2019t allow anybody to be treated out\nthere. Not even a nurse to give them shots. And then they employed a doctor. The local\nmedical establishment threw a lot of roadblocks into his getting a license. And it was just a lot of\ntrouble getting it. So the welfare rights groups came to me and we filed some administrative\ncomplaints and basically threatened to close the thing down. I mean their decision was if it\nwasn\u2019t going to work and be responsive, let\u2019s just not have it. Let\u2019s not waste the money. Well,\ntwo things happened, one was, of course, that Jean wasn\u2019t sure who her doctor would be, since\n108\nthey were all mad at us. And so she wondered if she could get any child care, any medical care\nfor her son, who was less than a year old, or just about a year old. And then the establishment,\nthe doctors or the agency complained to Congressman Perkins\u00ae about it and he asked for an\naudit by the General Accounting Office of what we were doing, not just in this case. There was\nat the same time a lot of hostility by local lawyers to having our get started. They thought\nbasically we were going to take money out of their pockets. So the GAO sent an inspector here,\nwhich wasn\u2019t too... but he was in our office for about a month. He looked at all, every piece of\npaper and then he issued... they ended up issuing a report which was really very favorable and\ncomplimentary. And when I called Congressman Perkins to ask him about this thing, about his\nrequest, he said not to worry about it. He was doing it to placate the local officials. He was sure\nit was going to work out okay. So there were things like that. And I had the local Bar was quite\nhostile. I went to them on one occasion and asked them, told them I wanted to set up a system to\nrefer clients to lawyers who, if the clients weren\u2019t eligible for our services, if they made too\nmuch money, that we wanted a fair system. So, would they want to give me a list of the lawyers\nin some order, the ones that would take certain cases and not take... So he appointed a\ncommittee to look into it. The President said he thought that was a good suggestion. Well, the\ncommittee met and their resolution was to suggest that we leave town, that we not practice law\nhere without their permission. It was sort of an indication of the atmosphere. I mean there were\na few, well I don\u2019t know that we had any lawyers who were outside. There were a couple of\nlawyers who had been here earlier, who had had a run in with me, but they were philosophically\nsupportive of free legal services. Because I wasn\u2019t the... when I first came, there were some\nlawyers who had been working here with welfare rights folks. They started something called\nMountain People\u2019s Rights. They saw their role more as being organizers than as being lawyers.\nThey had not gotten their licenses, so we had a serious difference of opinion about how this\nneeded to be done. Cold air out here. Oh, that\u2019s the air conditioning, that\u2019s what that is. Is it too\ncold?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s just blowing down, I didn\u2019t know where it came from. So, there were those things. And\nI mean the medical... and the fact that I had hired, the first two lawyers I hired, J.T. Begley,\nJoe\u2019s son, who had just come out of the Marines and gone to law school and Mort Stamm, both\nof them were living in Lexington and were staying down during the week and then they would\ngo back on a weekend to their families. So, it was not a, it took a while to, I really didn\u2019t have\nany friends or that much of a support system, especially since I was also sort of fighting with the\nother lawyers who had been here. And Jean was a new mother and was just trying to get to\nknow a few people who might share values, because the lawyers, the wives of the private\npractitioners, were really garden club types or people who were pretty much interested 1n money\nand materialism. But she then, she started, gradually started teaching childbirth classes. That\nwas a big, sort of avocation of hers and got her to have an interest outside of being at home. So I\nthink the first, those early, that early year was probably... wasn\u2019t much lonesomeness, I think it\nwas beautiful. I mean we knew, at the time we were not so sure that we would be here that long.\nI think 1t was much more, as you said, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to run me out of town. We\u2019re going to\nset this up. We\u2019re going to get started. There\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done.\u201d Legally\nthere were many more black and white, if you will, issues. The law was, I mean the law did not\n6\u00b0 Carl Dewey Perkins, 1912-1984, represented the 7\u201c Congressional district in Kentucky from 1949 until his death.\n109\nfavor welfare claimants. A lot of things which we take for granted today, like the right to a\nhearing and the right to your medical records, if you\u2019re involved in one of these, those things had\nnot been established and they seem very basic. So there were a number of these, almost every\ntime you looked at something involving a poor person against an official in one of these\nagencies, including the environmental stuff. There was so much to do and so much that needed\nto be done, that very few others were doing, that the work was very, very interesting from the\nvery beginning. It was very challenging. We were just sort of outsiders, who were not\nparticularly welcome in the community.",
        "A: Oh I think people who come to you as a lawyer for free service, especially who are just, who\nrealize that lawyers are there, who want to help them and are interested in them and are treating\nthem like people. And then when they see that in court they are meeting the other side with the\nsame, if not even better, with more competent lawyers, they\u2019re pretty proud of that. And I think\nthe clients have been... always from the first day, even when I was in the Civil Rights Division\nwhen I represented the United States, I always admired them a great deal. Most of them had\ndifficult lives, have serious problems. They\u2019re very genuinely nice people. They don\u2019t always\nhave the advantages that the rest of us have. Sometimes in the domestic relations cases, there\nreally aren\u2019t any winners and the children are losers. And I don\u2019t know... we have a lot of\ndebates in legal services about the value of spending so much time on domestic cases. And back\nthen probably the divorce rate was probably twenty-five percent, today it\u2019s over fifty. So, the\ndemand for what we do in that area, because people fight over kids. And the legal system hasn\u2019t\nadjusted. You have to have a lawyer in these things and there just aren\u2019t enough lawyers to go\naround. In this area there aren\u2019t enough people who can afford lawyers, so you either have\npeople who go without representation, if they don\u2019t... or they have to look to us. But on some of\nthe larger issues, the consumer cases or even the evictions or the others, that generally oftentimes\nyou have an opportunity, to help someone make a real difference in their lives. As you can see\nin the case listings that we put together, I think that those are all very significant, very important.\nI think that\u2019s so, but it was not an easy start. And now in retrospect, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s not\nsuch a huge amount of time. And I think, I\u2019ve always said I don\u2019t twist anybody\u2019s arm to come\nto this program. You have to want to be happy in a small community and that has pluses and\nminuses. You can\u2019t get lost in anonymity, which I think small towns have a lot going for them.\nBut at the same time you can feel very isolated if you\u2019re going uphill, and we often are. I mean\nyou\u2019re stepping on toes a lot.",
        "A: Well, we still step on toes. I think now there are, we don\u2019t, I don\u2019t like to step on toes if we\ndon\u2019t have to do that. And we try to avoid it and we\u2019ll try to negotiate cases before we file them.\nI think the program now, thirty years later, has a lot of support and so, public support, so people\nsort of expect to see that periodically. When they see a case that\u2019s in the paper, where we\u2019re\ntaking on as somebody would say another cause or fighting, filing a case for someone who\u2019s an\nunderdog or who\u2019s against the county or a hospital or against a coal company, they sort of take it\nfor granted. I mean they understand that back then it was very unusual and the clients probably\n110\nwere, I\u2019m sure, supported back then. I just think that people feel a little more empowered today.\nThe economy has been bad, and I think the coal industry over time has done, it has not been very\ngood, without being forced into making changes that are, to require, which require safe mines\nand low dust levels and environmental measures that make, that will restore the property after\nmining. All of those things have come...\nEnd of Tape 9, Side A\n111\nTape 9, Side B",
        "A: It seems that companies just won\u2019t regulate themselves. They will not. We\u2019ve seen that over\nand over again, whether it\u2019s the chemical industry or the mining industry. Because where people\nare looking for profit, primarily, they don\u2019t want to shut something, a mine down, long enough to\nfix what\u2019s broken or to take real measures to keep dust levels down until somebody has made\nthem do it. Because every time you do that, you have to slow production down a little bit and\nyou won\u2019t produce as much. So, as a result you have a high incidence of black lung disease and\nyou have an unfriendly worker environment. Finally things have started changing in the last few\nyears. So now I think it\u2019s much more accepted, if that\u2019s the right word, I think people even can\nunderstand or they see it happening and they see that that\u2019s probably one of the roles that we\nplay. And that we have done over the years, but I think at the same time they can see that what\nwe do is responsible. That we have good lawyers. That we don\u2019t make up law suits and that\ngenerally there\u2019s a good reason for what we do. When we can do something in the community,\nlike the housing project, where we\u2019re working with public officials, who are now, who want to\ndo something for people who let\u2019s say live in substandard housing, out of their own sense of duty\nor their own feeling that everybody\u2019s entitled to have a decent place to live in. If you\u2019ve got that\nsort of in county government, then those are people we can work with and not have to sue. I\nmean, I\u2019d like nothing better than to have us, to be able to put ourselves out of business.\n(Laughing.) But, I don\u2019t know, I think that\u2019s a long way off.",
        "A: Well, I think we\u2019ve... there are some other sort of unique things that we\u2019ve done. I think I\u2019m\nvery proud of the work that we\u2019ve done on behalf of coal miners, who have refused to work in\nunsafe conditions. We established a mine safety project, where we represent those miners in\nseeking a reinstatement and damages for having been fired unjustly\u2014excuse me\u2014or\ndiscriminated against unjustly. I think that\u2019s been real successful. And the lawyer who did that\nfor a number of years, Tony Oppegard, who is now the Assistant to the Director of the Mine\nHealth and Safety Administration, who was an Appalred lawyer in West Virginia years ago. I\nthink that\u2019s been very significant. We\u2019ve represented a lot of disabled coal miners in\napplications for black lung benefits, this federal program, where so many people, right now,\nninety-five percent of the people are denied, because the governmental regulations are so severe\nand it\u2019s so difficult to obtain the claims. But we still manage... and the private bar hardly does\nthose cases at all. So we\u2019ve worked with the Black Lung Association, Bill Worthington, for\nexample, officers of the Black Lung Association, in trying to get Congress to be, relax those\nrequirements and to have better regulations that are fairer, that we see a more reasonable number\n112\nof people be approved for black lung benefits. We have won many of those claims, the ones that\nwe\u2019 ve screened and where private attorneys finally gave up. Because it takes so long for private\nattorneys to get their fees and because they\u2019re so complex and take so long, we\u2019re going to get\nanother lawyer to come in pretty soon, nearer in the next few months to do that. And the mine\nsafety and black lung work sort of go hand in hand. The same thing is true of coal miner, of\npension benefits. We had a case we went to the United States Supreme Court on involving\npension benefits where we lost. But it really helped them, I think, in some ways to re-write their\nrequirements. But Gracie, it\u2019s the Gracie Robinson case, a woman up here, a widow up in\nAuxier, whose husband had worked over thirty years in the coal mines, but had not stopped\nworking and applied. And he died in the coal mines in an accident. And the requirements for\nobtaining a widow\u2019s pension was that the miner should have applied for a pension and stopped\nworking. And since he was killed in a mine accident they said he hadn\u2019t applied for his pension,\nthey wouldn\u2019t give her her pension. We said that was arbitrary. If he\u2019s worked thirty years and\nyou only have to have twenty-five to get a pension. And he wanted to keep working, that it was\nlike punishment at that point. We won and then we lost in the District court and then we won in\nthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and then we lost in the United States Supreme\nCourt. But they did actually re-write that provision in the bargaining contract. But I think the\nwork we do for low, for disabled miners has been really important. I think the... in the last few\nyears we\u2019ve started a migrant farm worker program up in Richmond, where we got some money\nfrom the legal services Corporation to help migrant workers throughout the state. We have a\nvery small grant. It\u2019s only about 35,000 dollars, so we\u2019ve done that co-operatively with a\nprogram in Texas that represents these folks full time. And we\u2019ve managed to file some of the\nfirst cases with respect to working conditions. I mean there are cases where the workers come up\nhere and the grower breaches the contract or at least our workers claim the growers have\nbreached their contract by not providing the working time that they claimed they would or the\nworking conditions under which they would work. And the program, the Western Kentucky\nprogram had the grant a few of years ago and they just could not really find the workers and we\nwere, by getting together with the people in Texas, the paralegal from Texas came up and who\nhelped... who helped to do this project, did the outreach work. And oh [YAWNS|] and for\nexample he would meet the bus, the Greyhound bus coming in at one o\u2019clock in the morning at\nthe station and give out his card to the workers and then they would know how to contact him.\nThat kind of thing. And you have to be bilingual, obviously, but I think that\u2019s been a very, even\nthough we have very few migrant workers out here in Eastern Kentucky, there are a number of\nother areas in the state, especially where they have large tobacco farms in Western Kentucky,\nthat\u2019s where we\u2019ve had so many of our cases. I think most recently the development of our\nhousing coalition here, called LINKS*\u2019, where we\u2019re doing this huge home repair project. With\nall the groups that are coming in from out of state. And just bringing all these agencies together\nunder one roof, so they can collaborate and work together, I think has been a real positive\ndevelopment. Showing people how they can, I mean we\u2019ve pulled together a lot of different\nagencies and non-profits, who are all addressing housing issues, into one collaborative. And I\nthink everybody\u2019s been real pleased with that. I think we\u2019ve been able to do that because we\ndon\u2019t have any axes to grind or turf. We just said, \u201cWe want to do this and we\u2019re willing to do it\nif you all will cooperate and we can seek funding together, and do some cooperative work.\u201d And\nso now I actually am sharing a grant with the fiscal court, which would have, and for a worker\nhere, who is a young woman who came from Jean\u2019s program. A participant, who 1s very, very\n\u00b0\u201d Low Income Housing Coalition of Eastern Kentucky.\n113\nbright and who has moved up very fast. Who is a single parent. Could go to law school if she\nwere willing. And that makes me feel good. And we\u2019ve had a number of people like that, who\nare single parents, who have been on welfare, who have worked with us in a training situation\nover a few months\u2019 time and have really, really sort of progressed so quickly and come out of\ntheir shell and have moved on to good jobs. I think we have a pretty extraordinary group in most\nof the offices. It\u2019s a good program to me, I mean if I go through the senior staff in this\norganization, I\u2019m just really proud of who they are and what they do. Many of them have been\nwith me a long time and each of them has different skills, but they\u2019re all committed to what we,\nthis representation of low-income persons, who otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to have lawyers.\nWhether it\u2019s for a mundane situation or something that is pretty exciting, that will really effect a\nlot of other people in the future. I think we\u2019ve, I think we do very, very good legal work and I\nthink we have real committed people who are doing it.",
        "A: Well it\u2019s all conjecture. I think those of us who have been doing this a long time are sort of,\nhave been disappointed the last few years, because we really have not been able to get\nappreciable new funding at the federal level. And this program was established at the federal\nlevel to provide free legal services to the poor and to be a non-political program. When it was\nthe last, one of the last things that President Nixon signed, was this Bill that created this\ncorporation. And we expanded and got additional money from 1974 to 1980. And we went\nfrom like forty million nationally or fifty, to three hundred and twenty-one. And when Governor\nReagan came in as president he was ready to destroy, to get rid of legal services, because of his\nexperience. They had sued him in California. And I won\u2019t go through all that history, but really\nsince the Reagan and that first year, instead of getting rid of us they made a compromise and we\nlost twenty-five percent of our money, which is a lot. And we\u2019ve never really recouped that\nmoney. We\u2019re now still not at the level we were in 1980. So that most of us have half as many\nlawyers as we did in 1981. We were able to... but there have been many efforts in the meantime\nin Congress to just eliminate the program. And we\u2019ve been able to forestall that, which says a\nlot. Because congressional support now is pretty strong. Unfortunately the subcommittee chair\nfor legal services is from this District. It\u2019s Hal Rogers from Somerset. And whereas he\u2019s able to\nbring back lots of money for other local projects, he has never, either he\u2019s not a fan of legal\nservices, or he is trying to mollify the people above him and the others whom he works with,\nbecause his latest... for the last couple of years, that committee has passed out a recommended\nbudget which is only about half the size of our funding level, 140 out of 300 million dollars.\nAnd that\u2019s been real disappointing, but he likes to say that he is keeping it going and that there\nare budgetary shortages, and that the other people on his committee are not as strong as he is.\nAnd he would be supportive. And besides he knows that our supporters will be able to get the\nfunding level up on the floor of the House, once it gets to the floor. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\nBut I\u2019m disappointed in him. I wish he were a little more aggressive or could do more at his end,\nwhich he probably could if he wanted to. But... excuse me just a moment. In the meantime\nwe ve been fortunate to get some money through the State Legislature and I think that\u2019s been a\nreal positive thing in the last few years, where our own legislators have recognized the\nimportance of legal services. We did not get any more money this year, but we did get a repeat\n114\nof last year and so about half of our funding is now state funding. I think it\u2019s conjecture, as I was\ntelling you there are lots of possibilities. I think our current corporation feels that it\u2019s more\nefficient to have a single entity in the state, covering the state. Because the President of the\ncorporation is a former private attorney from the state of Washington, however, where they have\na very effective, single state program. Time will tell us what will happen there. I don\u2019t know.\nAnd some other... anybody else? I think I sust lost my train of thought.",
        "A: I was talking about the state funding, right? That we didn\u2019t get any more funding this time or\nthat we were... how far did I get with state funding?",
        "A: We weren\u2019t cut and we were very pleased that we were able to get additional money last time.\nWe have two sources of state funding, one for the filing fee and one for a general appropriation.\nAnd this time, many programs did not get increases. There were a lot of one-time expenditures,\nlike the Science Center, got a litthke more money. But I think a lot of ongoing projects, except for\nthe new ones like the childcare money that I think actually, some of it\u2019s out of the tobacco\nmoney. So, this is a year again, where we have no more new money, state or federal. And that\nmakes it difficult because if you want to give people salary increases, you either have to lose\npositions or something else to free up additional funds. I don\u2019t know whether... and so there is\nthis tendency in our funding agency to pull programs together. There is the thought that state-\nwide programs are more efficient. I don\u2019t think there is any real proof of that anywhere. I mean\nI don\u2019t know that they have evidence of that. It may be more efficient to administer, because one\nperson can make a decision instead of four. You might be able to be more homogeneous around\nthe state. I would like to think that legal services is here to stay. I think for the most part it is. I\nthink there are people in Congress, who think of, that it could be organized differently. When I\nwas talking about a state-wide organization. Or whether... I know that one of my counterparts in\nVirginia would rather be part, consolidate with us, because our client population is so much the\nsame. The Appalachian counties do have a lot in common. Whereas in Virginia you have only,\nall of the state in West Virginia is in Appalachia. And Virginia, a small part of the state is in\nAppalachia. So, whether they would allocate enough resources to that one or two programs in\nthat corner is something that time will just have to tell.",
        "A: I think I need...",
        "A: Well, the other thing that\u2019s been so difficult with legal services has been the restrictions that\nCongress has placed on us in more recent years, which prevent us from filing Class Actions or\nchallenging Welfare Reforms, accepting attorney fees, not being able to represent prisoners.\nThose things all seem to, one could view them as making us second class lawyers. There is no\nreal, rational explanation for them when the preamble to the legal services Corporation Act states\nthat you should not interfere with the professional responsibility to your client. And that clients\n115\nhave the right to have full representation from legal services lawyers. So there\u2019s, it\u2019s not a very\nfavorable atmosphere to work under. It doesn\u2019t mean we still can\u2019t do ninety-five percent of the\ncases, because many of them still fit into, aren\u2019t affected by those prohibitions. But it is\nsomething that needs to be changed. And it\u2019s purely a political affair. And you have the national\nopponents of legal services, who are always looking for one more anecdote to pull out as being\nthe kind of thing that goes on. I mean, no one\u2019s perfect. So you find somebody\u2019s statistics aren\u2019t\nquite right and all of a sudden everybody in the country has to be on guard for an inspection,\neven though we... the way we are funded is by the number of poor people in our areas, not by\nthe number of cases we do. So there\u2019s always a level of, if not harassment, of paperwork that\ngrows and grows and leaves less time for the real work that needs to be done. But at that same\ntime it\u2019s good that we are able to get this money because you really can\u2019t fund this kind of work\nwith private fundraising. You could do a limited amount of it, but not very much. We, I think\nwe\u2019re fortunate to be able to get good lawyers. We don\u2019t pay equivalent salaries. And we have\npeople coming to work with very large, outstanding loans from undergraduate and law school.\nWe\u2019 ve instituted a small repayment program that is helpful. But we\u2019ve just increased our\nstarting salaries to $27,000, which is a big step forward. It\u2019s still behind many of the private\nfirms and many of the state and federal agencies. And then we only go up about thirteen\nhundred a year for, first for nine months and then for a year. But all the same, I think we\u2019re\ncompetitive and we have some good benefits. And we are able, have been fortunate to get\npeople who are really committed. So I am very proud of the work we do. I am very proud of the\npeople who are here and who do the work. We have wonderful relations, I also should mention\nwith the spouse abuse shelters. That\u2019s another project we\u2019ve started in the last few years, 1s to\nhave specialists who work, who represent abused spouses at domestic violence hearings. And\nwe\u2019 ve gotten very involved in that area and I think the family court judges appreciate us and the\nshelters appreciate us. And it is a huge amount of our practice, more than we would like. But\nit\u2019s one of those societal problems that we have to deal with, so we are very interested in the\nrights of children and the rights of these women. Of course, it\u2019s wonderful to have people like\nmy wife, Jean, out trying to help move them, gain some independence and get back into\neducation and develop their careers in a way that they can be productive and independent on\ntheir own. I\u2019ve been real proud of the people that have come from her program into my office,\nboth for representation and several who, at least one of whom is employed now as a full-time\nperson here. It continues to be pretty exciting work. I never, never lack for anything to do.\nClose to the end?\nEnd of Tape 9, Side B\n116\nTape 10, Side A",
        "A: Okay. Well, I was a chemistry major as I think you know, and I think that we\u2019ve always known\nthat the scores of our students here in science and math were very low and that science, math and\ntechnology was not valued very highly. So a number of years ago, maybe nineteen, somewhere\nbetween 1990 and \u201892, I asked teachers, some teachers to come together and some other folks in\nthe community to see whether we might not start a, developing some ideas for improving math\nand science, and what they thought. And what we learned was that teachers were very uneasy\nabout teaching math and science. Many of them had very poor backgrounds during their teacher\ntraining and they were ill-equipped, especially at the elementary level, to try to present scientific\nconcepts. And they really wanted more hands-on activities to support them. So we, we sort of\nmet periodically and then over the next couple of years. And then I saw a small video segment,\nor heard about it, about a college up in Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, Juniata College\u00ae\u00ae,\nwhich had obtained funding for a science van, where a chemistry teacher was driving a van\naround and dropping experiments off at high schools, dropping off equipment that the schools\ncouldn\u2019t afford to buy. And was like a sort of Johnny or Jeanie Appleseed, would tell school A\nabout what school B had done with these things. Over the course of several years the number of\nincoming students at Juniata College who were, who majored in or who showed an interest in\nscience, studying science-related courses, like tripled. So, I thought it would be, then got to\nthinking that we would like to, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we did something like that. I had not, I\ndon\u2019t think had really thought about the planetarium theater kind of thing yet. But we were\nmeeting and we got a small grant back about 1990, maybe \u201894 as a result of this work and this\ngroup that kept meeting. We realized that we could maybe establish a center like that if we\ncould get some funding. So, we got a little money out of the legislature, I think 75,000 dollars to\nhire a consultant. One of the legislators here in this area, Greg Stumbo\u00b0\u2019, was interested in\ntechnology and with KERA\u201d having come in I think there was a strong, an atmosphere that was\nconducive to getting some funding. And I thought we should start off in a small way, so we\nhired a consultant from West Virginia, Mike Howard, who had worked in the Kentucky\neducational system, to do some community meetings and help us look at more specifically where\nwe fit and what kind of activities would be helpful. And it sort of reinforced what we had\nalready known in some ways, that teachers wanted hands-on Mr. Wizard kinds of things. And\nthat if we could bring presentations to them and do something like the science van and\neducational programs, that that would be helpful. And I don\u2019t know where I first came up with\nthe idea of trying to do a planetarium or a science museum or really, I thought it might be nice if\nwe could even replicate a coal mine. But I started, we started talking that up and realized that if\nwe had a modern facility it would be really meaningful. And I also learned that you could, they\nhad these portable planetariums that you could take around to schools, which are little... they\ncall them planetarium in a foot locker, where you blow up, it\u2019s like a vinyl thing and you blow it\n68 Juniata College, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.\n6\u00b0 Stumbo was elected Kentucky Attorney General in 2003.

I think we may have even still been\nthinking about a coal mine. And we put together a board, I organized a board of directors that\nincluded representatives from Morehead and from the Alice Lloyd\u201d and Pikeville College and\nPCC\u201d and Hazard and the teachings, the science teachers and the regional educational\ncooperatives to give us a good cross-section of membership and also a good geographical cross-\nsection. And it\u2019s been, and that\u2019s basically the story. And they helped me, we went to convince\nthem, during the last legislative session, our local legislator agreed to get behind it and we made\na presentation to the Governor and he liked it and called me at home one day to go over the\nbudget. Wanted to know why I had a budget item for rent. He was very meticulous. \u201cWhy do\nyou need this three hundred dollars when you\u2019re going to have...?\u201d I said, \u201cGovernor, we won\u2019t\nbe in that place for a couple, few years yet. We need a budget place, we need an office.\u201d But\nanyway, we got through that with two and a half million dollars, and then this time... so we\nplanned some more, but because of the reorganization of the college, Kentucky college system,\nKCTCS and UK\u201d, the two years went by without any building. There was a lot of planning, but\nwe just got caught in the upheaval of this educational thing, until KCTCS could get on its feet.\nSo, in the meantime we put together a proposal for another million dollars, probably should have\nbeen for more. And after all the wrangling, we were one of the fortunate ones at the end to get\nthe million dollars, because Greg Stumbo, who 1s from here, is a pretty powerful figure and was\nessentially, he and Benny Ray Bailey, who got beat in this last election, were able to pretty much\nget all the one-time funding projects through that they asked for. So, now we are, we just last\nweek had our meeting with the architects and KCTCS folks and college representatives and we\nare settled on where the site is going to be and we have a basic floor plan. And I hope two years\nfrom now the building will be standing. It probably will be. And then that means another\nlegislature will have passed and hopefully we might even increase the operating costs of our\ngroup. We got a little more money for that. But I\u2019m very excited about what we will be able to\ndo, both for students who are in this region, who can\u2019t really, who never see this sort of thing at\nthis sophisticated level. There is now a planetarium at Eastern in Richmond, which a lot of\npeople don\u2019t even know about. But I think if we do this well, it can stimulate a lot of interest in\nscience and technology. We have now decided to expand our laboratory facility so that we will\nbe able to, from a classroom into a sort of laboratory classroom, so we can do experiments in\nDNA fingerprinting and other chemical experiments, at least demonstrative experiments. And\nwe\u2019re coming up with what I think is pretty exciting. Our Director we\u2019ve hired is from Pike\nCounty, he was born there, although he grew up in Michigan. And we have, as I say, a very\ngood board and so I\u2019m, I think that it will be a very important part of the future of Eastern\nKentucky. I think that we now have a new industry in Pike County, a knowledge-based industry,\nwhere a call center, Microsoft, 1f you call an 800 number for Microsoft and you need help on\nyour computer, they\u2019ll pick up the phone down there and give you answers to technical questions\nfrom their computers, which is a breakthrough in terms, because our coal economy is declining\nso quickly in terms of the number of people they can hire. So this is an area that we have to\n1\u201d Alice Lloyd College, Pippa Passes, Kentucky\n\u201d? PCC: Prestonsburg Community College\n3 KCTCS: Kentucky Community and Technical College System. UK: University of Kentucky.\n118\nmove into, that I think can have an appreciable effect on kids. People want to be scientists and\nthey want to be astronomers and they want to be explorers and they can see that happen. And I\nthink that\u2019s what the role of this building is going to be. And obviously, you know, we\u2019re going\nto need more money and I could spend all my time raising money for this facility for that matter.\nWe\u2019re going to be hiring a development director, but I\u2019m very much invested in this project. So\nthat\u2019s what it\u2019s about.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve been the chair of the board since its inception. Whether they\u2019re going to kick me out\nany time soon, I\u2019m not... but I may, and I\u2019ve been pretty active in that particular role. I don\u2019t\nknow. I mean I think it\u2019s very exciting. Actually it\u2019s the result of, and in part it goes back to my\nscouting days, because when I... did I talk about scouting before? When I was growing up and\nBud Schiele? Maybe I mentioned at the time that that inspired me to sort of get involved with\nthis here. Because we added such a wonderful museum in my home in Gastonia, now, which\ngrew out of a very small effort that started there. And I mean there is, certainly we will need\npeople to volunteer to do everything from just showing kids through the place to actively being a\npart of the soliciting group or... and I will probably be involved. But I\u2019m still very interested in\npracticing, in the practice of law. And if I were not doing legal services work, I\u2019d probably be\ndown the street with my friend Ned, and at least part-time working with him or working on my\nown, or taking in a few cases, because I enjoy doing them. So, I\u2019m not sure that I would just\nstop and do the Science Center. Or maybe I\u2019d be working with the housing group down here. I\nthink I\u2019d like to get our... I mean when you, it\u2019s kind of getting to what else I\u2019d like to be doing.\nI have a number of other interests, but I know I enjoy working. And I think when my daughter is\nout of graduate school and I feel like we have no more immediate important, sort of potentially\nmajor expenses within the family that I would stop. I mean I could stop I suppose. But I think\nit\u2019s a great development. There may be something else that comes up in the community. I mean\nI\u2019m very involved with the historical group, the Friends of the May House, where we\u2019ve renewed\nthis, restored this old building, which I\u2019ve been a part of for twenty years. And I\u2019m still working\non some of their legal documents to get a conservation easement at the moment. And I\u2019ve been\nproud of what we\u2019ve done in that particular thing. And we need to raise some money, because\nwe want to try to get that building open and keep it open. Everybody that is there is a volunteer\nand nobody has time to do any fund-raising. And that\u2019s just one of those things. And I know\nthat from my experience where I am here, I\u2019ve done a fair amount of fund-raising. I don\u2019t get a\nlot of private money, but I\u2019ve written a number of those grants and I know the system that you,\nhow you do it. And I know I could do that there. So, there\u2019s plenty for me to spend my time on.\nWhere I would do it, and I might still, you know, in the practice of law if you get an interesting\ncase and it\u2019s a big case it can eat you up, timewise. It\u2019s like putting together a play or a book or\nradio program.",
        "A: Oh, we\u2019re very close. I think she 1s close to all three of her children, maybe more so than ever\nsince my father passed away. And at various times, last time when mother was here we did a\n119\nlittle more oral history. I always tend to, it\u2019s one of those things you just sort of get yourself\ninto. You may be talking about Passover and trying to remember what the lemon cream recipe\nwas that she used to do. And then you talk about how Passover was in Germany. And then who\ntheir friends were that came to Passover and all of a sudden you\u2019re into some history that you\u2019d\nforgotten about or when she went off to learn to cook as a young girl. And so she\u2019s still, the\nstories are still there. Not all of them are recorded. And she still corresponds with people in\nGermany. Her mind 1s very good and she really enjoys being with us, so it\u2019s fun to travel with\nher. Jean has a really good relationship with her. I think my father was a very dominant, strong\npersonality, a very smart man. And mother grew up in a small country town. And I think being\na traditional, they had a very traditional relationship, where he was sort of the power figure in the\nfamily and she cooked and kept house and was very proud of her motherly role, as many Jewish\nmothers are. But Mom\u2019s really pretty sharp. And I almost want to say I think her mind\u2019s gotten\neven better in the last few years, maybe because of, by having to be a little more independent and\nliving on her own, she has, you know, it\u2019s broadened her horizons somewhat. But...",
        "A: Huh? She\u2019s eighty-eight. She\u2019ll be eighty-nine in August, ninety next year. But she\u2019s very\nstrong physically and very, still gets on her bicycle. So she\u2019s keeping up. When my sister took\nher on a cruise recently to the Panama Canal, they got off at some island to go sight-seeing and it\nturned out they were going up a mountain somewhere and she still kept up with everybody. And\nI think people, people are always quite amazed at her energy and her, you know, sort of... she\u2019s\nvery lively and very friendly, very outgoing. People can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s eighty-eight years\nold. There are others like that around now, who are eighty-five and ninety, who get around and\nI\u2019m hoping I\u2019m still in that, will be in that category. And I\u2019d like to have that, I suppose I was\nprobably saying I wish I had the time to, since she is so interested in traveling right now, that I\nwould like to have more of an opportunity to do that with her. Or for the three of us to go, but\nJean... when you are working, you do it in pieces. And so my brother and his wife have gone to\nChina and so that\u2019s why I went to see her with Jean last weekend. Now we\u2019re trying to plan\nanother trip or two. So I think I was just saying, I wish she were either down here or... I think\nshe\u2019s living in a good situation. She\u2019s in a high-rise for the elderly up in D.C. But she is very\ndependent on her family, because the people in the house, most of them are her age or older.\nWell, they\u2019re about, many of them are in their eighties and many of them are not in as good a\nphysical condition, so she\u2019s always helping others. So she hasn\u2019t made very many connections\nwith people who are her age and want to keep doing things, other than come down to eat and\nmaybe go shop for groceries. We see that and so while she is in a mood to want to be able to do\nthat, you know, you kind of want to accommodate her if you can. But I think between the three\nof us, we can get to do that. But when you have a calendar that is related to your work, you\u2019re\nlimited in that ability. You want to plan a trip in August and Jean\u2019s got to start back to school or\nsomething. You can\u2019t just pick up and go as easily as if you were not working at all.\n120",
        "A: I'd like to go to Leer, actually Jean and her mother went to Leer, years ago, when they drove\nthrough. There\u2019s a, I have a film at home. Do you speak German? By a German, by a\nfilmmaker, whose name I\u2019ve forgotten at the moment, that I just\u2014Mother hasn\u2019t seen it. I was\nsurprised. I made a copy for her\u2014of a homecoming to Leer by members of the Jewish\ncongregation. You know many of the German communities have sort of welcomed back\nmembers of the Jewish community, who lived there and who emigrated because of the\nHolocaust. And there is this group that came back to Leer. And there\u2019s a film about that group.\nNow there were no relatives of mine in that that I know of. But I would be interested, actually\nwhen we were in Washington last time and my mother, I was looking for the phone book\nactually, which is in a closet. And it was sitting on a little book that, I can\u2019t remember the name,\nin German. It was a German recipe book, in which you wrote recipes and Mother had kept it.\nAnd there was a folded up piece of paper in there and it was a letterhead of my grandfather, of\nmy father\u2019s father, Meir Rosenberg, who was a junk dealer, who, unfortunately committed\nsuicide when my father was very small. Killed himself. But it was his letterhead, on which my\nmother had written a recipe. And she didn\u2019t even know she had it, I just happened to unfold that\npiece of paper. And the recipe is just something she\u2019d been... wrote in like a little notebook.\nBut it covered many years. It was like she started 1t when she was a new bride. It was actually\nbought for her when she was going off on this trip as a young girl, when they sent her off to learn\nto cook, to a pension that was near Frankfurt, which didn\u2019t work out. So she brought it back and\nstarted writing. And it begins in German. I think over at the end some of the recipes are actually\nin English in this country. But she had that thing from Meir Rosenberg, which I don\u2019t know\nwhere that came from. And my father, of course, was in a school, in an orphanage in Hanover.\nAnd I\u2019ve never, because when his father died after a few years during the Depression, there were\nnine kids at home and so his mother just physically, could not economically take care of them\nand she sent three of them off to an orphanage in Hanover. I\u2019ve never looked into, I don\u2019t know\nmuch about that period. And his brothers and sisters, of course, are dead. I think one of his\nsisters, who is now dead, who went to Israel, did go back to Leer and sort of close the chapter on\nthat. And I don\u2019t know the business, you know, went out. We did go to Mother\u2019s home. I think\nI may have mentioned. The butcher shop and the house where she lived was torn, was no longer\nthere. The houses on either side of the house... which I suspect is due to the fact that her dad ran\na butcher shop and they slaughtered animals. And when he went into the, when they left in 1936\nand it was taken over, they continued using it as a butcher shop and I think it probably just\nrotted. Because of its use and constantly having water and blood and other... being used as a\nmanufacturing facility, probably just, you know, decayed. But we met a number of her\ncontemporaries in that town. There\u2019s still a club of her schoolmates. I may have mentioned that\nthe first time around. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: So, you know I have some interest. I don\u2019t know that I feel like a genealogist. We do have a\nfamily tree at home, which one of the distant relatives in Norfolk Virginia did, which identified a\nnumber of people who are related, that I didn\u2019t know, some of whom we now know. And my\nbrother did a family tree that goes back pretty far on my mother\u2019s side. And there are a lot of her\nrelatives are in the Chicago area. And cousins and cousins I\u2019ve never met, some of whom I\u2019ve\ntalked to. Magdeburg, I thought was interesting. Berlin is... I mean in a way, to me, the\nattraction to Germany is that I know the language and when you are there, you know that there\u2019s\n12]\nthis, because of the language, that sounds like a language you know or that you know the\nnuances, even if it\u2019s your... fourth or fifth grade, that there\u2019s very little language barrier. The\nlanguage brings with it a familiarity. Not that it\u2019s home, but it\u2019s like home. That this is a place\nyou\u2019re from. And it doesn\u2019t evoke all that hostility in me now, thirty years later. And I would be\ninterested in whether the Jewish community, the Jewish community in Magdeburg and a number\nof the urban areas is growing again, not huge, but is growing. And Berlin is an exciting city. I\nthink more from a tourist standpoint, wonderful museums and they are the parts of Germany I\u2019d\nlike to go see. But I don\u2019t know that I would spend a lot of time trying to dig out more\ninformation. It\u2019s interesting, when I saw that. And last time I was up there I saw... and I now\nhave, or I came across my father\u2019s, the certificate that released him from the concentration camp,\nwhich you\u2019ve seen copies of, I\u2019m sure, other copies of. And that sort of thing. I think they\u2019re\nvery significant. And I think Michael, our children are interested in this history. How much of\nit... and they are somewhat conversant with it. Well, I don\u2019t guess either one of them have been\nback through this, I would... I\u2019m just as interested in taking them to England, where I spent\nquite a bit of time in the Service. But I think both of them probably want to sort of look at this in\ntheir own way.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I think both of them have. At various times we\u2019ve talked about the history and then\nthey\u2019ve read about things that I\u2019ve written obviously. They\u2019ve read my talks. And they\u2019ve\nheard, both of them have talked a good bit with their grandmother. And I think they\u2019re both\ncognizant of the effect 1t\u2019s had on the family. That it is an important part of our history. It\nwould be nice to, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d ever have the time to re-do it all, but neither one of them\nhave been to Europe yet. I hope they go. We\u2019ll see.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. I think some people just feel the need to continue to... I mean I think you\nhave stated it, that there are people who want to be in an atmosphere where they think others are,\nthat only people who have been through something like that or close to it, can understand them.\nMaybe it\u2019s just like our veterans or sometimes they\u2019re the same thing. I mean, I\u2019ve appreciated\nbeing in Eastern Kentucky very much, in terms of also learning about this culture and its history.\n122\nThe crafts and the independence of people who are here and their ancestors. I\u2019ve always\nadmired people who have lived in a rugged way, and appreciated the environment, and...\nEnd of Tape 10, Side A\n123\nTape 10, Side B",
        "A: I\u2019ve always liked being in smaller towns. Just the trusting nature of people who are in smaller\ncommunities, whether it\u2019s Gastonia or whether it\u2019s rural people generally. And people who, we\nused to, I used to say when I worked selling chemicals up North it\u2019s... again you never, you\nalways wonder about generalizing, but it\u2019s like when you\u2019re a salesperson, if you walk into a\nplace in the South, people assume that they can trust you until you prove that you are not\ntrustworthy and do something wrong. And then you\u2019re done for. As opposed to going into many\nof the urban places where one might think that, they begin by thinking they can\u2019t trust you and\nthat you\u2019re going to pull one over on them. And it takes a long time to have them either trust you\nor have some confidence in you. That\u2019s probably, you know, it may be that that\u2019s old hat. I\nthink there\u2019s still a lot of that here. And that that\u2019s just sort of being country people. I don\u2019t\nknow, in terms of not having that much of a surrounding, maybe part of that may be the fact that\nI\u2019m married to a Quaker. I mean I did not marry someone who 1s Jewish. And we accommodate\nthat to the way we want to, and once you... so you make somewhat of a break from the tradition\nthat permeates the homes of Jewish couples and families where both couples are Jewish. So,\nJean is, obviously gave up some of her ties to being in a Quaker environment where she was a\nvery much involved in young Friends activities and probably never foresaw that she would be\nmarried to somebody who was Jewish, although Quakers are very, probably the most tolerant\ngroup, religious group that is out there. So maybe that has something to do with it. You know, I\ncan never look into somebody else\u2019s brain and I don\u2019t know what motivates people, why people\nhappen to be narrow-minded or not narrow minded, or what... You know, there are great\ndifferences among Jews, as you were saying at lunch, in the way, in the philosophy of the\nHolocaust Museum and how it should be run. I have, my mother\u2019s sister, at least one if not both\nof them, but one of them for certain, would say she would never step foot into Germany again. I\nmean there are many Jews who came from there, who think it\u2019s heretical to go back to Germany\nand would never forgive anybody and would draw the line in the sand. Whereas Mom went back\nand would go and continue to have some correspondence with people. And they were very\ntouched to see her and she was touched to see people she went to school with. My ties, and you\nknow I still have very good friends who I went to school with in North Carolina and Gastonia\nand that sort of thing and in the Service. I think it\u2019s all, I guess it\u2019s one humanity. I mean I think\nyou just, you kind of try to get the most out of what you can, wherever you happen to be. And\nthat has been pretty, I think that in terms of relationships here hasn\u2019t been that hard. I think the\nmost difficult, the big difficulty is that, one difficulty is that most of us who are professionals in\nlegal services or in others, who are in a helping profession or if that\u2019s the way we choose to live\nour lives, in a sense we live a pretty, we live, really, a middle-class life with our own\nsurroundings. And we have most of what we need. We are not disadvantaged the way our\nclients are disadvantaged. On the other hand, our value systems are totally different from our\ncounterparts in private practice or in the business community. So we don\u2019t share a lot of their\nvalues. And so you have to kind of make your own life and if you need a lot of friends in the\ncommunity that may be difficult. And I think to some extent that\u2019s why you have turnover in\ncommunities. Or because you become absorbed in your own world and you do stay so busy and\nyou do enjoy the work that you do, that that takes up a lot of your time. Which is some of, I\nthink, the kinds of stuff that Jean and I keep going, that keeps us going. Whereas in a place like\nWashington, even if you\u2019re working all the time, you\u2019re... and legal services is probably that\nway, you\u2019re socializing and working with the same group of people, because you\u2019re always\n124\ntogether. And so you don\u2019t really need a lot of outside help. I think that\u2019s... and that\u2019s why I\nsaid earlier, the school, I think when your kids start to school, you start to develop much more of\na base in the community and you meet parents. Maybe even socially your friends become, at\nleast for a few years, the parents who have kids in schools like you do. And that social\nengagement helps to, I think, draw you into the community and start thinking about things like a\nScience Center. I mean the first ten or fifteen years I was here, the idea of, you\u2019re just going\nuphill all the time. And even the idea that, that you might be working together with the business\ncommunity. I mean when I was filing these coal cases, the very notion of trying to seek funding,\nfrom say the coal council that\u2019s given the Science Center some money to design coal exhibits. I\nwould have said, \u201cWe can\u2019t do that.\u201d We had a big debate, I was on a Bar committee that was\ndoing a booklet for the elderly, health care for the elderly and rights of the elderly. And whether\nwe should get money, accept money from Humana, because we were suing Humana. I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want any of Humana\u2019s money.\u201d Well, we eventually took Humana\u2019s money and gave\nthem a, I can\u2019t remember. The other committee members said, \u201cLet\u2019s get the money, don\u2019t\nworry about it and give them a little acknowledgement. You can sue them. Let\u2019s get their\nmoney.\u2019",
        "A: Right, get their money twice. Those are philosophical issues that are hard to grapple with.\nThat\u2019s why I say, now that I\u2019m sharing a grant with a judge. I sued that judge, ten years ago ina\nstrip mining case, he was in the Service. And we\u2019ve had a couple of knock-downs, but he wants,\nhe\u2019s very... I think he, you know, he\u2019s like a lot of other political figures, but he came up the\nhard way and he wants to see this be a better place to live. And he\u2019s willing to invest his time to\ntry to improve housing and clean up garbage and do things that bring in industry. And as long as\nwe don\u2019t bump into each other over other things, I think that\u2019s a good thing to do. And so those\nare the kind of things that help make being in the community more, when you start thinking well\nmaybe we can do things with others and make this a better place for everybody, even if we have\nto step on some toes. The problem in agencies like these is the temptation with many agencies,\nof course, especially state, to jump over, it\u2019s too easy to get co-opted. And so you, as you were\ntalking about, the problem in the museum or any institution, if you start becoming cautious\nbecause you\u2019re afraid somebody\u2019s going to cut your money off, or you\u2019re going to lose your job\nor something is going to happen, then you lose the effectiveness. And I think we\u2019ve been able to\navoid that, I think, pretty well. I think people know, have known me, that I don\u2019t want to get into\nthat position. And the people on both sides of the fence, that I\u2019m not going to do that. If I did\nthat, I'd stop one or the other. That I think that... it doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t compromise.\nBut it is, you get put into those positions and that\u2019s hard, especially when you have funding\nsources that are problematical. I mean, that\u2019s hard. Like the migrant cases, when we had some\npublicity in one of the migrant cases that we filed and people went screaming to Congress. My\ncounterparts are worried we\u2019re going to lose the money in the State Legislature if they find out\nlegal services is involved in this case. That kind of stuff can be really hard, and you just try your\nbest to get through it. But I\u2019m pretty pleased with where we\u2019ve come. I hope whoever takes\nover will keep it going that way. Most of the people who run my offices, I think, have that\nphilosophy. I can\u2019t remember what you asked.\n125",

I mean this must be hard just to listen to folks\ngo on, but you can see why some folks start writing books collaboratively and are willing to just\nsort of, finally you turn it all over. Say, \u201cWell, just ask me and I\u2019Il talk a while.\u2019",
        "A: One thing I\u2019m not good at is, I don\u2019t have many stories. I know there are people who can tell\nthem. Jean\u2019s father is a marvelous storyteller and he\u2019s ninety-two. And he remembers jokes. I\nmean hundreds of jokes. And I try to get him, have gotten him to put some down on his\ncomputer or to type them up. Because he, Jean knows, has heard many of them. But it\u2019s\namazing. And I cannot remember a joke five minutes. I'll hear one and think it\u2019s wonderful.\nBoy that will be easy. I won\u2019t forget that. I can\u2019t even remember the punch... it just does not\nstay with me.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think give Arwen Donahue an award for having listened to all these hours of\ngoing on. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s much more to add. I feel very lucky. I mean I guess I just\nwould say whoever, if you think back on the fact that I was born into a Germany... I think that\nmy father was in a concentration camp. If you think back on all the experiences that I\u2019ve had,\nI\u2019ve been a pretty fortunate person to have been through all these various experiences and to\nhave people appreciate them and to be where we are today and to have so many different\nconnections. I think one of the nice things that Jean and I\u2019ve been able, have had a nice\nopportunity to do is just, we talk about Sherry Arms today. There\u2019s so many of those people,\neither in the Service or in the law, because she\u2019s in the work that she\u2019s in and because of our\ninterest in education, we\u2019ve just met so many people across the state. And have had a chance...\nand if it wasn\u2019t education, it\u2019s the people, those couples she taught childbirth to, because many of\nthose kids are growing up now. When you go to the grocery store and they say, \u201cLook Jean,\nthat\u2019s my twenty... see that, he\u2019s that baby!\u201d And here\u2019s this guy about six feet three inches tall.\nAnd you see all these, you know, you kind of look around you and you say, well, you\u2019ve had a\nlittle opportunity to do something that made a difference over time. I mean it\u2019s not over yet. It\u2019s\nnot an epitaph.",
        "A: Well, people are getting older these days, aren\u2019t they? What is the oldest person you\u2019ve\ninterviewed?",
        "A: One of these involved...",
        "A: Yeah, I was just going to tell you about a couple of... when you said is there anything else and\nthen we started talking about stories. And I said I didn\u2019t really do very well with stories, which I\ndon\u2019t. I\u2019m not a storyteller. But I thought I might mention a couple of experiences, just about\nlegal cases that I was involved with that I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve mentioned. The first one is one in\nthe early \u201870s or in the early \u201870s that involved the Paintsville Housing Authority. A family, part\nIndian, named Elsie, the father was named Elsie Dale. They lived in a shack, in an old house and\ntheir house burned down. And so he applied to get into public housing and they wouldn\u2019t let him\nin. So, I went over there and when I got there Elsie had taken some of the charred timbers that\nwere left and put them up against an old automobile, his car. And the family was living there.\nAnd they applied for public housing and they wouldn\u2019t let them in. They wouldn\u2019t let them in\nbecause the community treated them as black, not as... I mean Indian. They were dark-skinned.\nBut they were very poor. And so we went to the Housing Authority. We started investigating.\nAnd it turned out that the Housing Authority had also threatened to kick out some unwed\nmothers. And then there was a guy named, what was this fellow\u2019s name? He was a veteran. A\nsingle father. They didn\u2019t want him to... he wanted to get in with his child. They didn\u2019t want\n127\nhim in. The woman who was running the place, Maxine somebody, was very... she let you in if\nshe knew you. It was who you knew. There was nothing fair about the system and she just\ndidn\u2019t want them in the project. So, we filed a lawsuit. It was one of the first large cases that we\nhad filed. And on the way up there, I had to get, we had a hearing, we were to have a hearing in\nLexington for preliminary injunction. And we were trying to get the witnesses together. And\nthat night I was going to pick up the fellow who was the veteran. And I couldn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t at\nhome. And I finally found him and he was drunk. And I had to get him up there. And so I\nfinally got him in my car, and we got as far as Salyersville and I filled up the gas tank. And he\nwas riding with me. And he wanted, as we were leaving the gas station, he wanted to get out.\nAnd he was... what did he want to do? He started to hit me. I threw hot water in his face. Oh, I\nthrew my coffee at him. And I remember the coffee spot stayed on the side of the car. So, we\nthen drove, we started driving, I had this old Peugeot in 1970, because Jean and I had bought it to\ntake a camping trip. We brought it to drive down here. We had a \u201859 Volvo and we had this old\nPeugeot. And we had like a \u201862 or \u201866 Peugeot, which we had taken on our camping trip. So,\nwe got halfway to Lexington and I started having car trouble. I got out of the car to look under\nthe hood. And my witness, who was still partially drunk, then locked me out of the car. And the\nstars were out. I remember, it was a beautiful night. He wouldn\u2019t let me back in. What was his\nname? Elvin... Anyway, I bet I was out of the car for about half an hour. He finally let me in.\nWe got into Lexington about 1:30 in the morning. Next morning he was sober, and he got on the\nstand and he was a very, very good witness. And I had a blow-up of this big automobile with the\ntimbers and Elsie Dale got on and testified. He had four kids. He needed a four-bedroom unit.\nAnd the clerk of the court started crying. I mean it was so sad, they wouldn\u2019t let him in. But the\njudge would not order the Housing Authority to let them in. He said I could try to prove that\nthere was further discrimination and as it turned out that day... And the unwed mothers, Effie\nPickelsheimer was her name. She testified. We put on a strong case, but the judge was not\ngoing to do anything that day. So anyway we came back. But I always remember throwing this\ncoffee. Thirty years later. What was his name? He had a short, fat... he eventually, the same\nperson was indicted because he shot a guy in the back, who had started a fight with him. And I\nwent to visit him in the jail about twenty years later after that particular... Crum was his second\nname. It wasn\u2019t Elvin Crum, what was his first name? Well, we ended up having a number of\ngrievance hearings. I got the know all the tenants in that project. This case went on for about\ntwo years. In the meantime they were tearing down a new section, an old section of Paintsville.\nSo we were able for Elsie, he really wanted a house of his own. And as part of the settlement of\nthis case we were able to get him a Farmer\u2019s Home House built by the Community Action\nAgency. He never got in the housing project. But they were such a nice family and you knew\nthe only reason they didn\u2019t live in the project was because they were not white. We did finally\nget a very good, agreed court order that required them to set up a very fair system. And for years\nafter that they wouldn\u2019t... anytime there was a question about whether somebody should get in\nor not, they would call me, because they didn\u2019t want to go back to court. But it was a case that\nwent on forever. And finally really was resolved in a very favorable way for the clients in that\nhousing project. I was thinking, another, when we talk about the effect cases have, I represented\na group over from Pike County, who, they were supposed to strip mine above their, they were\ngoing to strip mine this holler above their homes in Poor Bottom off Maribone Creek over in\nPike County. And the families were worried that the strip mine was right over their houses and\nthat the rocks and boulders were... So when we looked into it, we learned that there were deep\nmine workings that had been worked out inside the mountain and that if they strip mined around\n128\nthe front side, they were in danger of hitting those old deep mine workings which were filled\nwith water. And the water would then potentially be a real problem to the people down below.\nIt just could come out in gallons and wash away houses. So we had a couple of hearings in\nFrankfort and one of the lead plaintiffs was named Edith Easterling, who was very much\ninvolved in the case against the McShurleys, which is when the Appalachian Volunteers were\nhere\u2019*. I don\u2019t know if you now about that? There was this series in The New Yorker about this\ncouple that was arrested by the local prosecutor. The case went to the House Un-American\nActivities Committee. Anyway, Edith\u2019s daughter was name Sue Kobak, she\u2019d married a young\nman in Washington. And she was home and she went to the hearings with us. And they couldn\u2019t\nfind, we were the only folks that could represent anybody because it would cost a fortune. There\nwere no lawyers around who would represent this community to try to stop the strip mining. It\nhad actually already started. I had a wonderful expert, a guy who had been an inspector. And\nshe went to the hearings with us. And I didn\u2019t know this until later, after she got home, she\napplied to go to law school and went to law school as a result of seeing this experience. And\nactually an experience that had a favorable outcome. The administrative judge said that we were\nright in that they had left, this information about the water in the old workings was not on the\npermit application. And that he considered it to be a danger to the family and they stopped the\nstrip mining operation totally. Edith Easterling a wonderful person, a remarkable woman. And I\ndidn\u2019t know until after was in... and Sue went to law school and had a difficult time as an\nAppalachian student for a couple of years. She later married a doctor in Clintwood and she\u2019s a\ncity attorney in Clintwood, Virginia. I was just thinking back about those sorts of human, and\nyou become... you were asking me earlier, you become very close to your clients. She had\norganized that little holler. And it potentially was a really serious problem. We did a lot more\nstrip mining work than we have in recent years because some of the lawyers who worked for us\nare now doing that in private practice. I just recently represented somebody in Letcher County,\nwhose name had been left off, their property had been left off a mining map. They just left them\noff because they didn\u2019t... and they knew, they knew that she owned the property that they\nwanted to mine and that she wasn\u2019t going to let them mine. And so they left, they thought, I\nthink, they could get away with it by just leaving their name off the map, which they are required\nto put on to show the property that they intend to mine, figuring they might just pay her damages\nwhen it was over. And she was outside, this is an older widow, looking up there and saw the\ntrees getting cut, coming over the hill. It was one of the cases that I did. And then we stopped\nthem from going any further and the state agreed that they should not do that. So I don\u2019t know, I\nwas just thinking back on Elsie Dale and the people you get to meet in these cases, who have to\nbe pretty gutsy to stand up against pretty moneyed interests, who pay big bucks for lawyers and\nwho hire people in the community, who hire their... I think one of these folks had a son who was\na truck driver for the same company that had mined, that was mining that strip mine. You\u2019re\nalways running into that, that sort of situation. But in every one of these cases, you know,\nwhether it\u2019s in legal services or it\u2019s the discrimination cases like Fannie Lou Hamer, and the\npeople who... Eulah Hall always reminds me of, you mentioned Eulah Hall. You know Eulah\nand I went to Washington together because in this health care case. I don\u2019t know if I mentioned\nthat the first time, when Eulah started this clinic and I was telling you this morning earlier about\nthe medical clinic when they wouldn\u2019t let these folks do this medical thing. What happened\nthen, we asked for a hearing and she was my witness and I took her to, we went to Washington\nand we had an administrative hearing. And they came back down here and did a big\n74 Vista workers arrested under Kentucky Sedition Statute\n129\ninvestigation and they threatened to close it. They ended up reorganizing it with a new board of\ndirectors, and...",
        "A: Clinic, yeah. The clinic, the program that was in being, because it wasn\u2019t doing what it was\nsupposed to do. And then so they ended up reorganizing that clinic with a new board.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s what turned into the Mud Creek Clinic, which is now a nationally-known clinic.\nBack then it was called, yeah, I guess back then it was just the Mud Creek Clinic. There was a\nperiod of time, it went through several phases, where it was called Big Sandy Health Care,\nwhatever... back then it was really under the Community Action Agency. But eventually it\nbecame the Mud Creek Clinic. Then that clinic burned down. Jean, she got her nursing degree,\ndid her internship out there after it had been burned down. They put a phone on the telephone\npole. And Eulah kept the place going in her house. No one believed she could do it. In three\nweeks she raised like 200,000 dollars over the telephone. And this was a social worker with a\nfifth-grade education. And she raised enough money, maybe it wasn\u2019t two hundred, to build a\nnew clinic. And it\u2019s been expanded several times since then. Now they have a dental clinic and\na daycare center and it\u2019s a real wonderful institution. That was a place, the only place... and a\ngood friend of ours became a doctor there. That\u2019s the place where we took our kids. Now it\u2019s\nrun by a federally-funded group called Big Sandy Health Care up here. They also run a clinic in\nMagoffin County and one in Pike County. And Eulah has stayed right with it. I mean she\u2019s won\nthese wonder woman awards. She\u2019s on lots of boards and lots of committees. And has just kept\non, but day to day she\u2019s still the social worker out there. And she\u2019s represented people in social\nsecurity and black lung cases, and has really learned it. Recently had her picture hung in the\nCapitol in that Women\u2019s Galleria, you know, one of those, the Kentucky Commission on\nWomen, Women of the Year things, or whatever they call them. I\u2019m real proud of her. I think\nshe\u2019s quite a testimonial to what people can do when they want to do it. And she worked with us\nfor a few years as an outreach worker with Appalred. So those are the people you come across,\nyou know. Hard to beat, right? Well, I guess we can call it a day.",
        "A: Oh, I should also mention.",
        "A: Did we ever talk about the Jewish community in Williamson?",
        "A: Where we are going to synagogue these days?\n130",
        "A: Virginia. Well we went to Portsmouth, I mean we went to Lexington and then to Ashland,\nKentucky for a while. But then most recently, for the last few years, we\u2019ve been going to a\nsmall...\nEnd of Tape 10, Side B\n131\nTape 11, Side A",
        "A: Well, we\u2019re talking about and I was thinking about how you maintain your Judaism as it were. A\nfew years ago we learned that there was still a congregation in Williamson, West Virginia, which\nis about thirty-five miles from here, much closer than Lexington and we went over there one\nFriday night. And found a very friendly group of people, who were meeting sort of monthly and\nbeing served by the rabbi from Huntington, West Virginia, who comes down on a Sunday night\nto do a Friday night service. And the synagogue is an old, old synagogue. I don\u2019t know,\nprobably a hundred years old at least. It sits up on top of a hill in the black section of\nWilliamson. And there\u2019s no elevator and you\u2019ve got to walk up a huge bunch of steps, well,\nprobably twenty-five. And the average age of the people other than us is about seventy. But\nthey\u2019ve kept on going and they consist of folks from Welch and Grundy and nearby people who\nare in a probably twenty, thirty mile area from around Williamson. I think twenty years ago\nduring the height of the coal mining in this area and maybe through the seventies and eighties I\nthink they had fifty families. Over the years the kids have moved away and so the older\nmembers of the Williamson Jewish community are still there. And the President is a fellow\nnamed Bill Rosen, whose son is now a circuit judge in Ashland. But it\u2019s been a nice group of\npeople, and the rabbi, who is from Huntington, is an interesting personality. His wife teaches a,\nnot Headstart, but Upward Bound program. And I\u2019ve actually been... the rabbi teaches a class at\nMarshall University on Jewish studies. And so I\u2019ve visited his class and spoke about the\nHolocaust as sort of a living survivor. But it is interesting, and then it\u2019s much nicer to go to a\ncongregation of that sort, where every person that comes is one more person that makes a\ndifference, rather than going to Lexington, where you\u2019ve got a large congregation at Adath Israel\nand there\u2019s also the Conservative, the Orthodox congregation there. So, that\u2019s been very nice.\nWe actually have, there are other, three other Jewish mixed couples here. Miriam Silman, whose\nfather, by the way, had the contract to, was an engineer, who re-did, who did the plans to re-do\nMount Vernon. And then Pam Weiner, whose husband is from here, from Pike County, and is a\nBuddhist. They just had a baby. And then Deborah Golden, who is a lawyer with my Pikeville\noffice. And then there is another couple in Pikeville, Terry Mulliken, who\u2019s a lawyer. His wife,\nCynthia, has been on my Board. It used to be there\u2019s a large family in Pikeville that used to go\nto Williamson, their name Yaruses. They\u2019re friends of ours. But they, and they go, now they\u2019re\nolder and they go once in a while. But the Williamson community was sort of the hub of the\nJewish residents of this area for many years. Now there are probably twenty families that are\nleft. One of the younger set married, a young woman married an Israeli when she was in Israel\nand they have a little boy. They\u2019ve recently been divorced. Very few young members. But it 1s\nthere and we have, we joined that congregation, so that we once again do have a, sort of a formal\ntie to a Jewish community that\u2019s here, for whatever it\u2019s worth. I guess it\u2019s worth putting that\ndown.",
        "A: It\u2019s Reform. Now the congregation the rabbi 1s from in Huntington, you had a Reform and an\nOrthodox congregation merge. Really unusual. And so it\u2019s sort of conservative. And I think he\nactually has, for the benefit of the Orthodox members, he has services on Saturday morning as\n132\nwell. He\u2019s a very funny fellow, almost like a stand-up comic when he does sermons. Because\nhe\u2019ll say something very serious and then it will jog his mind to kind of say something funny,\nreminds him of something funny. But he\u2019s a very bright fellow. It\u2019s a nice group. I mean, it\u2019s\nobviously an older group and they depend on one or two people like the Rosens and one or two\nother families to sort of keep it going. You know, once they got the air conditioning... I don\u2019t\nknow how many more years they can do that. There\u2019s not a very strong base down below.\nSomeone did a series in West Virginia, I think 1t may have even been in The New York Times, an\narticle on old congregations. And someone did a project in Kentucky, didn\u2019t they? On Jewish\nsynagogues in Kentucky, a few years ago?",
        "A: Well, the one in Ashland 1s, I don\u2019t know what they turned it into, a day care center. We used to\ngo there for the first few years we were here. In fact I had a fraternity brother at Duke, whose\nfather, who was Jewish, whose father was the mayor of Ashland back in the \u201850s, and he\u2019s now\ndown in Florida. And then they gave that up. And I think people either went to Portsmouth,\nabout thirty or forty miles north, or to Huntington. That congregation folded. And then we went\nto Lexington for high Holy days. We never really, I was never, didn\u2019t know many people and\nwe were up there for Seder a couple of nights, but you never felt much a part of it. You know\nwhat I mean?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean, I think, we often go Friday nights. She goes with me. She\u2019s always supported\nthat. Doesn\u2019t know any more, doesn\u2019t know a lot of Hebrew. But we also now have Quakers,\nwe have a Quaker group in Eastern Kentucky, which is a very small Quaker group, she may have\nmentioned to you.",
        "A: We go there on weekends. I don\u2019t think tomorrow, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s this weekend. I think it\u2019s\nnext weekend, but three or four couples. They\u2019re awfully nice. But she, someone was saying the\nother day... If you ask Michael, I guess maybe both kids sort of consider themselves Jewish.\nNot that they observe or are really close to the synagogues. When Jean told me that about Ann\nLouise, I was a little surprised, but I think that\u2019s what she says. Whether that will always be that\nway, I think they do associate more with us, rather than the Jewish community at large. All\nright.",
