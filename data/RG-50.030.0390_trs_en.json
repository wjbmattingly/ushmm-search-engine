        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And there -- like I say, the grandfather, he had the farm, so the son was involved in the f -\n- in the farming and the son-in-law. And my father, now, you\u2019ll ask me that -- now my\nfather was a Yeshivablocher, you know, you went to Yeshiva. And the -- in -- and it\nhappened to be in Proushinna being Yeshiva. And the Yeshiva, the way it was set up, you\nknow, each -- da -- each day somebody else used to -- you wite -- wite the\nYeshivablocher for supper and on the weekends, Friday night, Shabbat, you was invited\nto my grandf -- my grandfather\u2019s place and eventually he -- that\u2019s where he met my\nmother, in there, and -- and he married my mother.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re saying that he studied and be-because he was away from his family, people in\nthe community would invite him to dinner every night?",
        "A: That\u2019s -- ya -- no, th-that\u2019s the way -- that\u2019s the way they\u2019re set up, you know? We didn\u2019t\nhave restaurants, but that\u2019s the way they set up, yeah. Each Jewish family invites a\nYeshivablocher, you know, when it was a holiday Shabvas, for -- you know, for after --\nafter the services to come -- come from -- from Shul to come to his place. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s --as a\nmatter of fact, he had sometimes two or three Yeshivablocher -- to -- my grandfather.",
        "Q: What -- what did your parents tell you about how they met?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what -- it was -- it was like steady -- being s -- invited there for the holiday --\nfor holidays and -- and the -- Friday for Shabbat, you know. So -- and that\u2019s the way they\nmet and -- and that\u2019s the way they -- when they got married. Now, you cannot make a -- a\nshe -- Yeshivablocher, you know. They was going to take him in in the business -- in the\nfarm, you know, in the -- in the farm business. But there\u2019s a saying, you know,\nYeshivablocher, you know, learns, so [indecipherable] you cannot make a -- you cannot\nmake a farmer out of Yeshivablocher. So -- so what happened, is -- this was, of course,\nbefore the first war under the Czar. And they had a little -- where the little f-factory,\nbesides -- making cigarettes, just to make cigarettes and s -- and sell the cigarettes. But\nafter -- after the war, when the Polish -- Poland became independent, they -- and what\u2019s -\n- it\u2019s the tobacco and cigarette business was concessions -- you couldn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t -- it -\n- it -- it -- you c -- you was allowed, they gave him a concession slip, instead they\nliquidated, or they took it over [indecipherable] a little factory from the cigarettes and\nthey gave him the right, a concession to sell tobacco products.",
        "Q: The government took over the factory?",
        "A: It was in Poland you couldn\u2019t have. It was -- it was concessioned tobacco, it was the\nsame thing as liquor, it was concession. So they gave him half -- they gave him a permit,\na concession and we opened the store. It -- we had the in Proushinna there was -- call it a\n-- on the marketplace over here, like all the -- you got your shopping centers, but those --\nwe had that -- we had -- in the center of the city was a marketplace and there were about -\n- a big buildings with probably 100 stores -- you know, little stores and each store -- we\nmostly, mostly be Jewish merchants. I would say 95 percent. So you had a store, you\nknow, like a tobacco concession store, hardware store, a liquor store and -- and a\ndrugstore and you know, the -- with all this -- it\u2019s -- store, the individual stores, selling\nindividual products. And so he had a store and selling tobacco products.",
        "Q: What did -- could you tell us what the store looked like? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, it wa -- the s -- the store, you -- it was all in one big building and they -- 1-it was s-\nstores all around, east, west, you know. It wasn\u2019t really square, it\u2019s mostly I would say,\nshape like a -- a -- how would you call it?",
        "Q: A rectangle?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So I would say the -- for some -- like a big 25 -- 25 feet or 25 feet by 15 or\nsomething like that. It\u2019s not too -- not too big stores, because 100 stores in one building,\nnot big enough. But that\u2019s the way -- all the stores were the same size. Now we had,\nespecially it was im-important, the textile stores located in this marketplace and because\nin -- in -- in [indecipherable] -- in Proushinna, you couldn\u2019t go in and buy a suit or buy a\npair of pants or buy a pair of shoes. Everything -- you had to buy clothes, you went to a\ntailor -- tailor made and the tailor made you a suit or the tailor made you a pants. The\nsame thing, you know, there were leather stores there. So you went and you bought some\n-- you know, you went -- actually -- I mean either you went for yourself or da -- you\nordered -- you went to your shoemaker, the shoemaker went to -- what you had to buy --\nleather goods in the store. So everyth -- ev -- every store was -- was unique, the same\nsize. The only -- the only yourk occasions, the textile stores and this was a very\nexceptional busin-bu-business, in -- in -- in -- in push -- in the market, because all the\nfarmers -- we used to have twice a week, it -- we call it a farmer\u2019s market, where the -- all\nthe stores were located and there was a lot of land -- I mean it wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t paved\nlike over here, it was all with stones. It was where the farmers used to come twice a\nweek. Used to come on -- I think it was the -- like on Tuesday and Thursday and bring\ndown their products to sell. We depended on the farmers -- so all the vegetables, fresh.\nThey sold eggs, vegetables, chickens, even meat. But most -- it mostly they was coming\nand selling their -- you know, the ca-calfs to the -- for the butchers, there was so many\nbutchers around, too. You would -- to buy calfs and cows and -- and ships and chicken.\nSo everything was brought from the farmers and there were -- they were spread out, I\nwould say was acres, was acres of land around the -- that farm -- that marketplace where\nthey used to, you know, they used to unload the -- and s-s-stay all day til sometimes the\nproducts were sold.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about now -- about your -- your home? Wh-Wh- What are some\nof your first memories of your parents and the house that you grew up in?",
        "A: Oh, well, we -- you know, it\u2019s -- Pr-Proushinna was a city, it -- it was not a big city. The\npopulation in general was, I would say, around 12,000. And the -- 57 percent of the\npopulation was Jewish. So I would say it -- it\u2019s roughly put at 12,000 -- 50 cent -- it\nprobably had -- had at least six or 7,000 Jewish families. And -- and see, we had a house\non Kobrina, you know, [indecipherable] Kobrina, they c-ca -- that\u2019s another city, they\ncall it Kobrine, was a -- a city a-about 40 - 50 kilometers from Proushinna, so they call it\nKobrinska -- Kobrinska s-street, number 25 and it was mostly -- this street where we\nlived was mostly Jewish. There were some Gentiles, but a street full mostly with boys,\nvery few girls on the whole street. Now, I -- I mean -- I had all my friends next, like a\nfew blocks away, there was four boys and there was three boys. Now, we had -- in our\nfamily, there was two girls, they call it Kobrina street, you -- you know, if there is no\ngirls [indecipherable] and boy street.",
        "Q: What kind of games did you play with your friends?",
        "A: Oh, games?",

        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, pond, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. And what happens, wintertime, it used to freeze up, so we -- mostly the -- you\nknow, the younger ch -- young -- we were kids, we were skating on the pound. It was\nmore -- you know, it\u2019s Saturday, it was boys and girls. Of course that time we didn\u2019t have\nthe skates like here now. The first skates I remember I had was made out of wood, with a\nsteel wire attached to it. Eventually, you know, we got some skates, which was sf -- you\nhad to have a special -- special shoe and s -- and the-there -- there was a latch where you\nattach and -- and then -- and then you had to tighten it up. I mean, this was a real luxury.\nThis was already -- we didn\u2019t have those -- like hockey -- hockeys boots and skates\n[indecipherable]. So wintertime we used to s -- mostly skate and -- and the big sport was\nsoccer, you know, in Europe, where kids -- especially mostly boys, we used to play\nsoccer. And they would -- so each organize groups and you know, we -- the youth belong\n-- those years in Poland, we used to belong to certain organization, was a Zionist\norganization. It was Zionist organization, consisted of so many branches. It was -- you\nhad the -- you had the Shamir and you had the -- the Haroots and you had the Bitar and\nyou had -- you know, all those -- all those Zionist organization. Leftist, Rights and left --\nlefts -- Leftists. And girls used to belong to the -- those organizations and we used to\nmeet -- meet in -- 1n certain halls -- we had a hall and play sometimes Ping Pong and play\nduring the -- the weekend. And our -- was a big game -- boys, we used to -- we used to\nplay chess in the evening. Chess was very popular, it -- as a matter of fact, my father was\na Chess player. You learn how to play Chess. He was a good Chess player. So I used to\nplay with him. And so I learned to play then. We used to get together in the evening and\nplay Chess. Ch -- and -- but I was -- I had a -- a friend next to us, where we lived and\nthey were -- they had a factory and they made soft drinks and seltzer water and this was a\ngood business too, you know. Every -- everywhere, especially for the holidays and for\nSabbath, you ordered those -- I remember the [indecipherable] where you get those, it\nwas quess -- quess [indecipherable] seltzer water. Every Jewish family had that. And\nbeside, they used to make soft drinks, too -- out as -- you know, bottled soft drinks, or --\nand they had a radio those years, they had a radio. And when I was -- this was for -- when\nI was y-young -- 13 - 14. So, we used to listen, usually in the evenings, beside playing\nChess, you know, there\u2019s -- used to get together, not only s -- couple more friends and\nafter playing Chess, we used to listen to the radio. This was before -- this was in the\nbeginning -- in the beginning 30\u2019s -- 1930\u2019s. So we loved especially th-th-the favor of\nmine and all it was -- we used to put on the Gypsy music from Soffie -- Soft -- the capitol\nof -- I think it\u2019s from Sof -- Sofi -- Sof -- e1 -- onc -- I said Onc?",

But he\u2019s -- he was able to read the Torah, he\nwas reading the Torah so-sometimes a substitute reading the -- you know the Torah, the -\n- and -- and -- and -- and many times they used to really -- wouldn\u2019t waise farther way\nand the widdow waiser was a hazan sometime. They -- you know, they used to cantor\nbefore the holidays. Yeah and I went to -- every Friday -- to Shul and Saturday to Shul.\nThe reason I went to Shul Saturday, because I was -- my s -- my grand -- they say that my\ngrand -- my grandfather, after coming from Shul, he always made a kitty, you know, a\nkiddish, [indecipherable] mostly, you know, have a full house and I wanted to know, so I\nwent to -- to the -- to the house, because you had wine and they -- he had -- he had wine\nand he had a lot of -- you know -- and -- and especially the -- the cakes and the -- they\ncall it an torte -- torte duddee. The -- another honey cake, the -- how did the -- oh, let\u2019s\nsee, he had honey cake and -- and I like the -- the -- the plain what do you call it, what do\nyou call it here?

And they made me seem -- even\nmy father, because it was -- it was re-religious and every S-Saturday, after the meal,\nwhen you come from Shul, you go, you have your meal, go home. We had the Kiddush,\nthen you go home and have the meal. So, I used to come after the -- after the meal, used\nto make me to recite a whole sedra from that -- from the five books of Mor, the old sedra.\nI said, \u201cI have to do it. I want to go out, play.\u201d And no, you got to do it, you got to say it\nall. Sedra took about an hour. And you had the sedra with the -- with the Aftorah -- the\nAftorah. I still can do the Aftorah now. And my mother was busy, you know, busy with\nthe four children. Besides, like I say, we had a big, big house and a garden, all the\nchildren, we all shared and helped. The garden we had our own vegetables, we had our\nown tomatoes and -- and -- and cucumbers and -- and radishes and -- and you name it, we\nhad plenty. And besides, we had two cows, yeah, because my -- to say that it was, you\nknow, it was a farmer, you know, so which -- you know it -- two cows, I want two cows -\n- to take care two cows and I -- you know, you know, I[ all -- so the ca -- you got to milk\nthe cows, two -- twice, three times, just -- and you know, after you -- the children -- make\nsure the children get the fresh -- right of the cow, fresh milk right of the cow.",

You know, I probably -- I probably, maybe -- my older brother did\nalready -- decided to u -- immigrate to the United States.

I knew all the history. So we were speaking politics with my\nfather. He was involved in politics.

        "A: Yeah, I he -- I heard -- we -- I heard what happening, yes. We knew all of this -- we all\nknew all -- all about it. We\u2019re figuring that time, geez -- well, why do they -- you know,\nthey f -- why -- especially s -- if 1t\u2019s so bad, why don\u2019t they -- why don\u2019t they take off and\n-- and -- and get out?",
        "Q: The Jews in Germany\u2019?",
        "A: The -- the -- Germany. After all, if there is the law -- that\u2019s only Germany, you know.\nDon\u2019t do it -- but it\u2019s like the same, it was -- it was -- 1t was taw -- it was hard. You live\nall your life in a country, you build a country, so you figured some did, you know, left,\nwho knows? Those -- some decided and they left, in the -- you know, already 19 -- 1936,\n\u201837, before they were able, they left and they had to abandoned, you know, they are --\nthey have to give up their businesses. I think in the beginning they were able to sell --\nforced to sell. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the law changed so rapidly there, that in the\nbeginning they -- they allow you to sell what you had to sell, you know, prac-practically\nto give it away. But at least you were able to sell and you were able to get out. You were\nable to get out, if you had a place where to go. So some went out. S-Some, I know, so in -\n- some German Jews were able to get out in that time now. Actually where you\u2019re going\nto go depends -- depends who 1s going to accept you. You see, I know that. My brother,\nhe -- he had a relative, so -- so many here -- relatives here and it took -- it took from \u201837 -\n\u201839, two years, it was a quota -- everything was in a quota. Polish quota and -- you\ncouldn\u2019t -- you could -- there were so many, probably, applications, that you had to wait\nfor your next. And probably the same as in Germany. Now, there was no place to go --\nthe only sodo -- the -- some went -- some went to -- some went probably United States, I\nunderstand now and they left for the United States, where we were able. I take it the\nmajority mostly went -- if we didn\u2019t have a Jewish state, we went to Palestine. Yeah,\nthat\u2019s the only he -- somehow, illegally went to Palestine. And those who remained, see, I\ndon\u2019t know, either they still didn\u2019t believe -- this was before all the atrocities, before all\nthe -- you know, before all the -- the c-camps and the -- the chambers. Gas chambers\nwasn\u2019t heard of yet in those years. They didn\u2019t know anyth -- you know, nobody knew\nabout it yet, what was going on. You had some laws -- certain laws went in, okay, that ya\n-- there in Germany, I don\u2019t know if they had -- in the -- where those -- I don\u2019t think until\nlate -- later they had -- in 1938, I think they had to wear their yellow stars, but in\nbeginning they -- the beginning they -- the laws that -- you know, you weren\u2019t allowed to\npractice your profession.",
        "Q: Y-You said that your father was involved in politics in Proushinna. Te-Tell us a little bit\nabout that. How so?",
        "A: W-Well, he -- he was -- the politics -- now, the later years already, 1t was when -- in 19 --\nin 1939 -- so we were fortunate that Proushinna -- see, the Germans started the war in --\nin September. The po -- you know, the war started September first, 1939 -- in all the\nhistory. You know they requested, you know -- bef-before it -- before it started the war\nwith Poland. That\u2019s -- we call it actually when the second war started, but bef -- in 1938,\nthe Anschluss -- you know they took over it -- they took over Aust-Austria without -- I\nmean the Anschluss, I mean they were invited without -- just marched 1n and took it over\nand they -- and they -- they were -- they were welcomed with flowers and they were --\nthey were -- you know, they were happy that -- and then I know it came with\nCzechoslovakia. You know, I followed all on the -- you know, I followed all the news\nwith the checko -- in Czechoslovakia -- th-they requested the Sudinland -- Sudatenland.\nNow, Sudatenland, they choseu at that time, chare with what\u2019s his name, that if -- a\nforeign -- Foreign Minister from Britain, Chamberlain, he still went down, you know, and\nyou made -- y-y-you gave him alcage -- they agreed, the Czechs agreed to -- to -- to give\nit up S-Sudatenland. The reason -- they were greedy, they claimed Sudatenland was --\nonce belonged to the Germans and there was a lot of German nationals. So we ke -- you\nalways exclaim, I remember exclaim -- they said they were mistreated and this and that --\nthe reason given why he wants to give it Sudatenland. So finally -- you know the Czechs,\nthey didn\u2019t have a choice, so they gave it off bit Sudatenland. But he wasn\u2019t satisfied and\n-- and -- and that\u2019s when the p -- you know, the pact was made with -- win Chamberlain\nand it was -- Czech, the Czech was sold out. See, Chamberlain thought he\u2019s got a pact,\nyou know, with Hitler. You cannot make with -- make up with a tyrant --\n[indecipherable] a tyrant like that. And -- and that came back and this, and he says now --\npeace is now -- he established peace and the world is going to have peace now. And the -\n- you see the feather -- the -- the feather of the allies and finally he grabbed all\nCzechoslovakia. So then he started, in 1939, he started with Poland, but was -- speaking\nabout Poland, now Poland was an -- see, they were an -- anti-Semitic later. In the\nbeginning, when Poland was established, the president th -- th -- 1t was that Marshall\nYusef Pulsutski. He was the one organized the army and liberated Poland. Under\nPulsutski -- he was -- he was a social democrat iff, you know? And under him, it was --\nthe Jews felt safe and they were -- you know, incorporated as -- as democracy, treated as\nany other -- or a -- you know, there was not too many in Poland. We had nationalities\nhere, had Poles and you had -- you had Jews and you had some White Russian,\nBellarouse. It\u2019s not like he -- United States, you have so many nationalities, so many\ngroups -- or in Russia. So the anti-Semitism in Poland actually started after he died. Now,\nhe was -- it\u2019s -- there was rumors even going on. I heard that -- that th-the Jews saved P-\nPulsutski\u2019s -- you know they put the -- the -- the Russians were after him and they put -- I\ndon\u2019t know if -- where is common, they put a [indecipherable] on him and twirl him and\nthey saved him and he appreciate that -- that\u2019s fa -- you know? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s -- you\nf -- where -- it\u2019s not written in the history, but I -- that\u2019s what I heard. So he was ca -- he\nwas appreciate -- it was good. After he died, it -- this was in the late nine -- 20\u2019s -- and\nbeginning 1930\u2019s, that\u2019s when -- you know -- it -- the ch -- it changed. And what\nhappened influen -- the German influence a lot. So when the war broke out in 1939, the f\n-- the Foreign Minister of Poland, Beck -- disappeared and you find out he was a German\nspy, the Foreign Minister Beck. Now -- and he was influential to -- you know, they --\nthey -- they knew in Poland that\u2019s the war -- you know, that the Germans, first of all, they\nrequested -- they requested Danzig, that was the first thing. This was the -- the\ninternational port -- supposed to be -- did belong maybe one time, to Germany. So, okay,\nthey gave him -- s-so they gave him danz -- they gave him Danzig. But he wasn\u2019t\nsatisfied. Then h-he wanted -- he wanted the other part, we are speaking of -- about\nPoland -- he -- that -- the same thing in Poland, they were on that border with Germany,\nwhich -- there -- when Poland was established a independent state, there was a lot of\nGerman nationals there. So he -- je lee -- I remembered it exactly that the pretext that he\nsays, you know the Poles are mistreating the j -- the -- the -- the German nationals and\nthey killed German nationals -- is going to -- that\u2019s why he\u2019s going to just -- you know, 1s\ngoing to try and save his -- the -- his G-German nationals. It was a bluff. It -- it was a\nbluff, it was an excuse.",
        "Q: When you felt things beginning to change like that, did you ever consider leaving? Did\nyour father ever talk about it? Your brother, like it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",

        "Q: -- it\u2019s getting bad. S -- 1938, \u201839 --",
        "A: Libby -- you -- in -- this is already -- in nine -- in 1939, see what ha -- see what happened\nin 1939, we were saved by the -- it\u2019s -- we ex -- the war started and the Germ -- we\nexpected the Germans. And the Germans came in our town. They stayed a day or two,\nwas quiet. You know, we were in -- outside, we had to get water, you know, we didn\u2019t\nhave water inside, running water. We had to go to the wells, get water ona. And the army,\nthey -- it was -- it was quiet, he -- nothing, I mean, there was n -- and all of a sudden,\novernight, they pulled out. So we didn\u2019t even know there was a secret pact between --\nmade between Stalin and Hitler. And then we realized, you know, finally, you know, that\nthat\u2019s when it started in thir -- in \u201839. See, they m -- Stalin and Hitler made a secret pact\nand it promised -- gave Poland, it says, eventually you can -- you know, you can take\nover Lithuania, you can take over Latvia, you can take over Estonia and then gave him\nlittle -- if you want a little territory someplace -- you don\u2019t want -- this is -- between the\nCzechoslovakia and -- and -- and Romania, they call -- that\u2019s the part -- part of the\nterritory they gave it to the Russians. And so the Russians came over to our city, that was\nalmost -- you know, so we had from \u201839 to 1941 were the Russians. Well, under the\nRussians, when they came over, all right, I mean it was -- the system changed, but it\nwasn\u2019t like in the Soviet Union, you know what I mean? It -- the -- especially for the\nprofessionals, what somed -- was even better than -- than in Poland. You know, teachers\nwere very important, you know, you could -- they had -- you remained the Jewish --\nJewish schools, the worn clothes, you went to a Jewish school, you went to Russian\nschool, or the Polish school. They kept, you know the schools -- the schools the way --\nthe way it was before. And even -- even the farmers, they -- they didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t\ncollectawhy, you know what I mean?",
        "Q: Collectivize?",
        "A: Co -- Collect -- you know, like in Russia? They -- each farmer still operated and se -- but\nmy grandfather, they took -- my grandfather was too big, so they took -- they took the\nfarm away, yeah. They took the farm away and they\u2019Il -- they\u2019Il let him manage to -- put\nit this way, I mean it\u2019s already -- you know, and they paid him a salary -- paid him a --\npaid a -- paid him a salary. So it means -- and -- but the profession -- doctors the same,\nwere working in the hospitals and the -- the private practice and lawyers -- it didn\u2019t\nchange very much. So we had a normal -- we had a normal life for another two years, for\n1939 - 19 -- 1941. So I went to the Russian school. So, from the Polish school I had two\nmore years, I went to the Russian school. And in the Russian school we learned Russian\nhistory and there was no anti-Se -- anti-Semitism at all.",
        "Q: What was your grandfather\u2019s reaction when the farm was taken away?",
        "A: Well, what ca -- the reaction -- of course, I mean it\u2019s -- not much, I mean the reaction, it -\n- it not much you can do. They took away the same thing, they took away my uncle\u2019s fa -\n- you know. They let him work there, he managed the mill at the same -- they took away.\nYeah -- well, we expected the Germans. It\u2019s -- you know, we expected the Germans and\nit\u2019s already 1939, it\u2019s already too late. Where you going to go? I mean, if the German\nwould come, there is no way you can -- nowhere to go. It\u2019s too late to go. So at least you\nknow with the reaction -- you didn\u2019t like it, I mean, but at least we heard what\u2019s going on\non the other side of Poland there. All the refugees from the -- from the western Poland,\nthey were -- they were flooding -- you know, trying to get in to the eastern, where we --\nyou know, where we were under the Russians. A lot of them -- a lot of them, you know,\nfrom -- from big cities -- from Lodz or from Warsaw, from other cities, they were able\nyet, in the beginning, you know, to smuggle through -- going through. And the -- and the\nRussian accepted them in the beginning, but there was such a flood later on, there was a\nlot of -- came -- came over with a flood, so the Russians sent them away up sisib you\nknow, was too many, they send them to ser -- to -- to -- not to Siberia, but you know yur,\nthere\u2019s a Azerba-Azerbaijan in Russia, they try to make -- now under the Russian, this\nwas under Stalin, tried to make a Jewish re-re-repull like a Jewish state in Azerbaijan,\nyou had the Jews there. Yeah, so they went there. [indecipherable] some of them\nsurvived. So it\u2019s better than -- we heard already, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s better than -- than the\nNazis.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about your political activities. You had mentioned earlier that you were\ninvolved in a youth group?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were you still involved in it or were you involved in any other sort of meetings or\ndiscussions about politics?",
        "A: Yeah, I was -- I was all -- I was involved with each -- that\u2019s -- you know, in -- in\nProushinna we had two groups. There was Zionist group -- like I say the Zionist group\nthere were -- there was Shamir -- atsa -- Holatsim and -- and -- and -- and the Istad, there\nis a lot ou -- ou -- a lot of groups from the Zionists and then there were the Bund. You\nknow, the Bund is -- this is Socialist groups. They believed -- they didn\u2019t believed in a\nJewish state in Zionist, they believed that, you know, you live in Poland and you -- you\ngot to be citizen of Poland and live in Poland and try to -- and try to get your education,\nyou know, do the best you can and account for your livid. Yeah, that is the Bund. They\nwere -- they were [indecipherable]. I was -- I was a Zionist and I was a Zionist and I\nwould belong to Bitar, which is -- Bitar is the organization, they call it a leekhood now.\nWhat\u2019s in Israel, leekhood. I always believed that, you know, if you want to have a state\nnow -- we always -- if you want to have a state, nobody -- you have to fight for state,\neven if not -- but even if you -- you know, we didn\u2019t have a Jewish state, we have\nPalestine. And so even if you tr -- you know, you -- you illegal, you get into Palestine,\nyou have to be able to defend yourself. City Jews, you know, they settled there, they\nworked hard in the beginning and on the Kibbutzim and all that and eventually some\nArabs, they came -- you know, there was a lot of -- and ca -- there was a lot of pogroms,\nthey -- in -- in pal -- you know, in Palestine before the Jewish state. Because see, they\ndidn\u2019t believe that -- you know, the Jews that -- in -- in -- what you call it -- in fighting or\nsomething -- resisting fighting. I mean, even if you -- if you leave your home there and\nyou work -- and you -- you know these people work in the swamps, those pioneers. We\nhad so many pioneers from my town went. I had a friend, his brother went before the war.\nHe was a pioneer, went to -- if we didn\u2019t have a Jewish state, they went to Palestine. And\nyou -- you know, he survived. So I was -- I was a little -- they called us -- they did call us\nin -- in Proushinna, you know, they ca -- that time, you know, with the -- like -- in, say,\nthe brown shirts, you know, brown shirts like, you know, fighters.",
        "Q: They called you the brown shirts?",
        "A: The Bitar was brown shirts.",
        "Q: Bitar, oh, okay.",
        "A: Bitar, you know the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- from the other side -- from the shar -- Ha-\nHalatsim and Shamir, from the other Zionists, Leftists organization what it was, you\nknow. They called us -- we are writers, you know. We have more writers. Zha -- Zhavit --\nyou know, if you know, we know the leekhood. I remember Shaboutinski. You know for\n-- Shaboutinski, the leader? He believed that -- you know -- that you try to encourage the\nJews to organized in the [indecipherable] to organize and to defend yourself.",
        "Q: How had you come to have such strong feelings, though, about that? There you are, in\nProushinna and you\u2019re growing up, it\u2019s pretty middle class, things are pretty good. How\ndid you get such a strong feeling that you should be part of a youth group that would\nultimately believe in fighting for a state?",
        "A: Well, because -- because first of all my leader -- the leader of my group from Bitar, was\nthe first one -- organized the a -- the resistance in the ghetto. And he was the first one\nwho left the ghetto, which -- you know, very -- the ghetto was still existing when we\nwere trying, you know, to arm ourselves. And he was the first for the 10 people who left\nthe forest when the ghetto was still established, four months before the liquidation. So --\ny-you know, when you belong to this group, you got -- you got somehow indoctrinated. I\nwould sa -- I know indoctrinated. That\u2019s for -- that\u2019s what we were be living to, you\nknow. We were living to -- you know, have all of Palestine now. I remember that -- oh,\nyou know, the song, have all --",
        "Q: What\u2019s --",
        "A: They dote lier dade seshelon stador, dote lier dade seshelon. See, I still remember\n[indecipherable]. It means we will -- both side of the Jordan not enough, you know. We\nbelieved on the both side of Jordan. And now, you know, Miss Baggan, you know the\nBaggan, the Foreign Minister, badaway, he comes from Presque, chestatoffsk brest -- this\nwas where the s -- a-armistice was signed. The first World War. It\u2019s not far. And\nProushinna was the region of -- region on the -- from Poland, it were region of Jesht.\nNow Baggan was coming down, I was in the Bitar, you know, Baggan was come down in\nProushinna. I redba -- I remember him, you know, eve already, all he is -- Baggan used to\ncome down and we used to -- you know, we were soldiers, we used to march and salute,\nyou know. Yeah, I was a Baggan man.",
        "Q: Interesting. Y-You said that you were indoctrinated at the -- tell us a little bit about a\nBitar meeting.",
        "A: W-We had meetings.",
        "Q: How -- what would you talk about and -- and what would happen in those meetings?",
        "A: On the -- in the meetings, well, in the meetings it was social. We were young sometimes,\nit was social. What it -- sometimes we\u2019re switched. You know, my brother was older, he\nswitched from [indecipherable], he says, \u201cThere is nicer girls here,\u201d he\u2019Il\n[indecipherable] go, you know. This is stuff, we were young yet -- 15 - 16 - 17. So we\nsticked with the group and we used to get together once -- once -- at least once a week,\nsometimes many times you the week, we had a hall, they all -- each org -- you know, in\nProushinna, each organization had a hall, used to have meetings, used to have speakers.\nSpeakers used to come and speak and besides -- and there\u2019s a lot a -- we used to have\noutside -- what you call it? a cookout -- you go out in the woods, like a -- like vashomer\nand went to the woods and -- and marched in the woods an-and not far from Proushinna.\nAnd that\u2019s the way -- that\u2019s the way the organization, they operated, yeah.",
        "Q: D-Did your father -- what were your father -- father\u2019s feelings about you being in Bitar\nand beginning to have these more political --",
        "A: Well, he really didn\u2019t -- he -- he really didn\u2019t care. He -- my father -- he really didn\u2019t care\nif I was in Bitar and it wasn\u2019t that, he -- you know, it didn\u2019t -- it -- he knew -- he knew --\nI mean the -- the philosophy of the Bitar, what it stand for and all that. But he really\ndidn\u2019t care, yeah. But, you see, my father was a pessimist. Well, he -- well right -- this is\nspeaking about ninet -- when the war already when we were -- the war in \u201841, you know,\nwhen the st -- 1t started June. This was [indecipherable] the Russians, I t -- like I told you.\nWell, normal ristu -- in 1942, in June, 22, when the -- the war broke out with the\nRussians and the Germans, this was terrible. Now, they marched the -- first of all -- see,\nthey did, they tricked -- they did the same thing as the Japanese did with Pearl Harbor.\nYou know, they have the same system. They utilize the time when the Russians were on\nwhat you call it? Was a holiday off. Most -- most of them celebrated. And that\u2019s when\nthey attacked. And they -- it\u2019s about -- like I mentioned before, the border between the\nPolish - German, where the Germans are and here where we were is about press boog,\nthere we were boog for -- press the tob chashed. The boog divided and out of sight was\nthe Germans occupation, they were in the -- here were the Russians -- were the Russians.\nSo, I remember it was the ficausit overnight they broke through. And that they marched.\nIt was Panzer and tanks and motorcars and no one on foot. No one -- at -- less that, you\nknow, through the street -- through the city and oh, outside the street for weeks, power --\nopen. I mean they -- they -- they already broke through, they [indecipherable] it from 50.\nThey -- they broke through right away there. And we went out, we had to come out, you\nknow, like get some water. Everybody was afraid what sit in the house. And the only\nthing -- they didn\u2019t bother the army, they were marching, they didn\u2019t bother anybody,\nyou went out to get some water. And the only question is -- they were asking how far 1s\nMinsk? Well, I says, Minsk, you know, I was -- I was outside, too, I says, \u201cMinsk, you\njust cross the border.\u201d It depends -- it depends if they are from the -- you know, maybe\nthey are from way back. I mean -- on the -- w-what -- the -- they probably started maybe\nthe -- from Germany or from some -- western Poland my -- you know, the army. They\nsays, \u201cOh you -- you have a long way to go yet, I think, to Minsk, you still got maybe a\ncouple hundred kilometers.\u201d And it was open, you know. The tanks were open, they\nbroke the line. And [indecipherable] Russian, where we retreat.",
        "Q: The Russians were retreating?",
        "A: They were in a panic, a retreated in that -- in that section. You know, there was three\nfronts. We were in the Bellarouse and there was Ukraine. They attacked from three sides.\nNow, the way I understand from -- from brief now a side, they broke through, right away\nthey went through. First of all, yeah, I didn\u2019t mention. When the Russian took over\nProushinna, they build a big airport -- right outside from Proushinna. We didn\u2019t have an\nairport. A big -- they probably prepared themselve, they -- either they knew, right near\nthe border. And it was a tremendous airport. And -- and -- mi-military airport. And they\nwere flying, training and flying pilots. So, in Proushinna, all the time was noise. During\nthe night it was, all the time. And we got a kick out of 1t sometime, you -- in the day, you\nknow, you saw the way the planes, you know, they do a -- they -- they -- they exercise in\nthe planes. I thought, \u201cGee, they\u2019re going to drop down.\u201d It was -- you know, it was -- it\nwas -- it\u2019s exciting things. So they had the -- the Germans bombed the first -- right away\nthey bombed the complete -- whatever airplanes was on the airport. They destroyed them\nall. [indecipherable] see?",
        "Q: Did they bomb Proushinna?",
        "A: Not -- the Pr-Proushin-Proushinna, on the outskirts they did, but they di -- th-the airport\nand the outskirt of Proushinna -- so the airport was des -- was destroyed. And so f --\nabout maybe a month -- four or five weeks, that\u2019s all, they were marching, marching\nthrough the city. And everybody was sitting, was -- the people were sitting inside, were\nafraid to go out. But the German army didn\u2019t bother much.",
        "Q: Just bu -- before you go on, just try to remember that month. What was going on in your\nhouse? You said a lot of people were sitting. What was your mother saying? What was\nyour father saying? What were you and your brother doing? In that month where you\ndon\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and the troops are coming in -- the German troops.",
        "A: Yeah w-well -- well, we were -- we were -- [indecipherable] my mother saying that there\nis -- we knew -- we knew it\u2019s going to be -- we knew it\u2019s going to be trouble. I knew that.\nNot my -- we knew it\u2019s going to be trouble eventually. We understood, but not -- what\ncan you do, you know? You try the best. And so they -- wike went -- were -- the feeling -\n- what\u2019s -- we still -- you were still in your house, you stilled -- everybody knew the war\nis going starve it -- everybody prepared a little foods. You know, food and certain\nvegetables so last for awhile, whatever. And there\u2019s nothing unusual happened the first\nmonth -- three, four weeks for the [indecipherable]. But after, there were some military\npolice took it over, yeah. And they were used to maybe grab sometimes, you know,\ncertain Jewish people -- younger people, for certain work -- you know, clean up here,\nclean up there, whatever, yeah. But I mean there was nothing serious, unusual, serious\nhappened. But when -- after f -- about a month, then the Gestapo and the SS came in.\nAnd they took over control of the city. So the first -- the second day, what they did is\nthey requested -- they, you know, they had spies from the ca -- the local population\ncollaborated. Most of the intelligencia from 20 -- I think was 18 people, right away,\nwomen and men. And somebody, you know, a leader from the organization, a leader\nfrom the Temple and if they knew somebody\u2019s a Socialist and somebody\u2019s a Communist\nand somebody\u2019s -- so they selected 18 men and they took him right out to the -- it was not\nfar from Proushinna in the forest and they shot him. We knew that. We knew that. That\nwas the first couple days.",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: Because -- how did I know that? Because it was in ghetto established and we have\ncontact yet with the -- we were free to go out and mix with the Gentiles and they -- you\nknow, there is some religious around there, we knew that -- that, you know, they were\nshot. We knew that. It was no secret, everybody knew that. They took him out -- there\nwere some witnesses and this was the first two days. And it -- it took them about -- so 1-1t\n-- they used to grab every -- you know, every once in awhile, somebody -- we were still\nliving -- each one in -- you know, I lived in our house, each one was living in their own\nhomes. It was not a ghetto established. So they used to grab many times -- I remember\nthe ghetto was established, they grabbed some people to an airport -- I think I mentioned\nthere was a airport near the city and the Russians left a awful lot of -- you know, and they\nwere surprised -- is a lot of clean up -- debris is clean up and they left a lot of\nammunition. And this was -- this was wintertime in -- no, they -- no, th-this -- th-th-they\ncame in and no, that\u2019s not -- I\u2019m sorry, in the winter, this was the 20 -- June the 20 --\nJune 22. So, clean the airport and sometimes, you know, you get with -- you know, y-y-y\n-- depends -- depends where -- which group you worked for.",
        "Q: Were you ever grabbed?",
        "A: Oh, well, yeah. I -- we were grabbed. For instance, what happened up -- now -- we were\non the airport, now, it happened to -- you know, there was an engines -- I\n[indecipherable] an engine. Big engine weighs 1000 pounds. And they told me, two\npeople to lift up the engine and put it on the truck. It\u2019s impossible, how can you put it in?\nI mean, you got to have a -- it weighs 1000 pounds, you\u2019re not going to pick it up. The\n[indecipherable] for them this was already -- you know, the SS and Gestapo. Pick it up.\n[indecipherable] you know, with a stick, hit you over the head, bang you. They know you\ncouldn\u2019t do it. F-For them it was -- you know what I mean. So, they beat you up and that\n-- finally, you know, they says, well, get a couple more help and put it on on the truck.\nThis was I -- the first days were I experien -- really experience. So, but -- you mean --\nyou couldn\u2019t do anything, you know, if they cat -- they -- they coo -- 1t was -- most of the\ntime a cleaning up jobs -- only men, they didn\u2019t take any women that time, only men,\nyoung. Mostly the younger men for ca -- all kind of clean up jobs. And eventually -- you\nknow, started dill -- 1t came in the laws -- before they stop this, the Judenrat, 1t came in\nalready, certain decree, certain laws. I remember that, that you know, you had to -- you\ncouldn\u2019t -- you still free to move outside the ghetto and deal and trade with the farmers if\nyou had a little money and all that and so you couldn\u2019t work already, a Jew, you had\nbefore, the arm band. You didn\u2019t have the yellow star, you had a arm band on the right\nside, with it says Juda. So it means, you know, if you went out, they knew that say Juda,\nout -- you -- they knew you\u2019re Juda, that\u2019s -- they grabbed ou-ouch -- otherwise they\u2019re\ngoing to grab somebody by the ow -- how did they know you -- know to grab -- to gr -- to\ngrab a Jew, because it\u2019s -- you have the arm band and they -- a Juda. Now, of course\neverybody followed, it\u2019s -- maybe some -- it wasn\u2019t s -- you know, you were scared. Inc -\n- you -- I mean, you put on the arm band, what would happen if you wouldn\u2019t po -- put\non the arm band, I really don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know, sometime, if they would\ndiscover it, you know, maybe they\u2019II kill you. Well, I -- it didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t experience\nthat. And -- but it didn\u2019t lasted, it lasted about a month and they started to organize the\nghetto. So -- and they -- before they organized the ghetto -- before they organized the\nghetto, they selected a Judenrat, you know, they selected each -- you know, that\u2019s their --\nthat\u2019s the system. And they didn\u2019t install the Judenrat, they told the Jews that you install\na Jewish council, that\u2019s a Judenrat, it\u2019s a Jewish council. Would represent -- represent a\ndifferent -- different branches. Now, if we need labor, there you\u2019re going to be, there\u2019s\nMinister -- you ha -- you\u2019d -- Minister of Labor, you\u2019re going to be Minister of Sanitation\nand Minister of -- of Police -- Jewish police. You got a -- you know, Jewish police to --\nyou know, in the Judenrat to keep order, the Jewish police for -- you had to keep the\norder, you know, there was some decrees for the Judenrat and if -- for no kind of\nbranches, you know what I mean and that\u2019s the way and so they would select -- they try\nto select among the Jews, which is a select well -- in the beginning they selected, it was a\na-attorney, a big attorney, Schreibman. All attorney -- well attorney, maybe we sho-\nshould select Schreibman. And they decided, well, we going to -- they decided to select\nha -- he was a big businessman, an educated -- yeah, so they -- It-Itsal Yanovitch. Very\nbig extra -- you know, respective -- respected Jew businessman, respected by the -- all\nthe community from the poor. You know, everybody, Poles and all that. And educated\nman, so he was the president and then there -- the important job was the -- very important",
        "A: -- ovitch. Very big extra -- you know, respective -- respected Jew, businessman,\nrespected by the -- all the community from the poor. You know, everybody, Poles and all\nthat. And educated man, so he was the president and then there -- the important job was\nthe -- very important job is that -- in charge of labor. Now, the Germans now, they\u2019re not\ngoing to pick this, you know, that\u2019s [indecipherable], so this was the Juden -- they picked\nthe Judenrat, which consisted of -- I think 1t was 22 people all together. Each one has his\nown job. And they told the Judenrat that we going to establish a ghetto in certain spots --\nyou know, they picked -- they say the spot is going to be usually they picks the spots, you\nknow, what is slum spots, not the -- not in the center. Yeah, and they gave you a certain -\n- certain -- 15 blocks or -- or so -- 20 block. The -- the -- the measurements exactly where\nthe Juderat is going to be and those Jews who lived in -- you know, have their own,\nstayed there. All the Jews living outside -- on outside the Juden ghetto, had to abandon\ntheir homes. Of course maw -- there was very few Gentiles living in the slums, there.\nThere was eve -- there was some -- they had to abandon -- they had to leave their homes.\nAnd so they were -- established the ghetto and it was -- you know, f-fenced, as all the\nghettos -- fenced in with ba-barb wire fenced in.",
        "Q: Who built the fence?",
        "A: The Jews had to f -- build themselves, they told us exactly the measurement, the plan.\nYou build it. We had to build it. We had to pay for -- our labor, of course. We build it, we\npaid for it, with all -- and --",
        "Q: Did you -- you help build it?",
        "A: Well, I really -- I really didn\u2019t help build it. Th-That -- it -- 1t -- they had -- they had the --\nwhat you call it, ca -- c-carpenters, they had welders and they had -- I was too young, I\ndidn\u2019t participate in building that, no. You know, professionals, which it -- and\neverything. Well, we didn\u2019t have the machinery, everything would had to -- done by\nhand. And that\u2019s the -- all the outside Jews were put in the Judenrat and the\nBurgermeister came in in town. That\u2019s the mayor of the town and he had -- he had the --\nthe authority for the whole city. Includes already, I mean, his -- the Juden -- already the\nJudenrat and all that into -- beside the SS and the Gestapo and the other units. So, when\nthe Judenrat -- we had -- our house was in the ghetto, yeah, yeah. Our hou -- because it\u2019s\n-- it was the section there, somehow -- we had a big house, like it says, a pound way back\nin it, our house was still in the ghetto, so we remained -- we still remained in the ghetto. I\nmean, we remained in our house. And then, eventually the laws -- right away, laws went\nin that you have to -- of course you have to wear it -- that -- that you got to wear the\nyellow star -- yellow star on your chest, on the left side and the back, I think it\u2019s five\ninches -- you know each one, a child, everybody wear -- to wear the yellow star. And\neverybody had a little -- still -- ver -- food saved up and stored up for -- f-for little, you\nknow, for -- you were still be able befo -- able to go out before the Judenrat was\nestablished -- to deal with the farmers. You know, still free, but you still have the yellow\nband, you\u2019re still free if you had -- there was no money. If you had money, it was mostly\nbartering most of the time, you know, for the farmer. If you didn\u2019t have any money, so\nyou have a pair of shoes, they gave you -- gave you sa -- they gave you, for instance,\nsome vegetables, whatever or meat or -- or some butter or a little cheese or a suit or\n[indecipherable]. This was bar -- you know. This was -- you were -- what do you call it?\nBar -- Bar --",
        "Q: Bartering.",
        "A: Bar-Bartering.",
        "Q: Trading.",
        "A: And -- because, yeah -- trading, because the ruble, under the Russian, the ruble was\nalready not for -- you know, change wasn\u2019t considered [indecipherable] at all. They\npreferred tradder -- the farmers -- they preferred tradder -- you want something, they\nwant something valuable. So -- but when that Judenrat was established, this was already -\n- rationing went in at -- to effect. They gave you so much -- so much bread. We didn\u2019t get\n-- we didn\u2019t get bread. We got flour. My uncle\u2019s mill supplied the flour for the Judenrat.\nYou know, we used to get flour. They figured out already, excess -- roughly how much\nflour -- 400 pounds, how much bread is going to come out. So it was -- I don\u2019t know, 25\ngrams or so much. 12 - fif - 25 grams of bread, then they rationing and so much little --\nmargarine for each family and little -- I think it -- they have -- it -- it was over here, what\nthey call it, like oh, Jello type, little Jello, if you want I should, yeah. And then, right\naway l-law went in. They requested from the Judenrat that you have to -- half a million\nrul -- there\u2019s some -- you know, you have some money -- rubles left, you know, from the\nRussians, rubles left -- half a million rubles and this was the -- you know, this was as\nfunction already from the police, make sure -- you know, 1-1f they knew that somebody --\nyou know, rich, poor, you know. So, somebody didn\u2019t want to -- didn\u2019t want to give the\npolice -- the Jewish police were forced, you know -- you got to give. Or somebody didn\u2019t\nbehave or somebody -- you know, the police f -- the police function was to keep order.\nWe had a lot of -- you know, there was a lot of stealing and -- and when you\u2019re hungry,\nyou know, you know something, you\u2019ll grab -- so it\u2019s got to be, you know, got to be\norder. So the p -- the function of police to keep order in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Let me just check this. You said there was a -- a -- a -- a law established to -- to get\nmoney from the Jewish community. Ho-How much did your family have to give and did\nyou have the cash or did you have to --",
        "A: No, we-well, the rubles, we gave some ru -- I don\u2019t know, it was a half a -- half -- it was a\nhalf a million rubles and it was about 10 kilogram of silver. It was the -- went effect right\naway and I think it\u2019s a kilogram of gold. So, each one, you know, in orders -- the\nJudenrat is -- their function is to make sure that getting from the Jews and each one had\nto -- you know, had to give -- you know, if you had a [indecipherable] something, yeah,\nso that -- and besides, any foreign foreigncy not allowed, you know, that\u2019s strict, they\nwere going to -- if they\u2019re going to catch you, you got caught with foreign currency, let\u2019s\nsay a dollar, you know, the death penalty. For no -- no radios. All the radios has to be\nconfiscated. Whoever had a radio, you could not --",
        "Q: The radio next door?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: The Goldberg\u2019s radio?",
        "A: They already had gon -- I mean, all the radios had to be confiscated. And all -- a Jew\ndidn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t -- weren\u2019t allowed to own a radio. You didn\u2019t wa-wa-weren\u2019t allowed\nto own a camera. You were -- they didn\u2019t allow to had Bell telephones. There was not too\nmany telephone, radios and any other -- we didn\u2019t have the -- had like here now, you\nknow, the television and VCR\u2019s and compasses -- I give you example, maps -- a map, a\ncompass, anything like that, yeah, was not allowed. And had to be turned over and this is\n-- this is -- the first laws went into effect. And so it was the Judenrat in general, in\nProushinna, you know, was -- did a good job. You know, they\u2019ve -- some complaints in\nsome other places, in other ghetto. They were -- they did a good job. As a matter of fact,\nthey -- it -- 1t -- they came later on, in 19 -- it was establish in 19 -- it\u2019s \u201841 -- 41, from\nsome other cities to learn the system the way, you know -- to learn the system the way we\nin the Proushinna ghetto operates. Now, eventually, in late 1941, that was established in\nJune, late f -- 1941, they brought in f -- Jews from little surrounding towns. Most of the\nlittle towns were liquidated for -- on the spot. You know, there was families, a little\nhamlet or village, with 20 - 50 - 100 families [indecipherable] you know, the SS, they --\nthey -- they killed them on the spot. I know a fact, it is not far from Proushinna, there was\n-- we didn\u2019t have the statio-station in Proushinna, we had to go -- it\u2019s about 10 kilometers\nto the railroad station. We had a little trolley station. If you want to travel, you had to\ntake the trolley and -- to Dalinavo, which is 10 kilometer and then there was a little town\n-- little village. There were about 25 families and in 19 -- in ni -- this was in -- right\naway, the first -- the first -- when they arrived, the first month, they killed them all out. In\none family, somehow one person from that family somehow escaped and came to our\nghetto. This was -- came to the ghetto. So, they -- yeah?",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to stop you there, because we\u2019re just about out of tape, yeah. You know, every\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Okay, at this point the ghetto has been established, it\u2019s still fairly early on. What was a\nregular day like? What -- you would wake up in the morning -- at this point you\u2019re still in\nyour house?",
        "A: Yeah, well --",
        "Q: What would --",
        "A: -- 1s -- th-the ghetto was established in -- in August fir -- in August first. Now, that time\nalready, the Germans -- any part -- any di -- what you call it, like we had the\nBurgermeister, SS, yes and the -- the Gestapo and there was -- there was an airport and\nthere was some warehouses, so it was already a system established, when the Germans\nrequested, for instance, 500 people one place, 200 people here. So the Juden, you know,\nthey gave an order and the Judenrat supplied, sort of in the morning. And you know, they\nkept -- bookkeeping, you know, fair -- it means if I went today, somebody else will go\ntomorrow. Now, if I like -- if -- if I like the place where I was sent and they gave you,\nyou know, some places -- they treat you -- they gave you a s -- sometimes a s -- extra\npiece of bread or something -- little margarine or something. So you were willing to go\nand work there and I don\u2019t mind going to work there another day. But there was some\nplaces where -- where you -- they and -- there was a -- a Leaman -- a Leaman commando,\nwhich they were in charge of the communication line and telegram and te-telegraph,\ntelegram poles and they were rough people there, where -- you know, nobody wanted to\ngo and work there, because they beat -- you went there and you know, they told you what\nto do and decided they were unsatisfied, they -- you know, they were beating you up and\nkicking you for no other reason. So, you say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not -- you\u2019re sending me back to\nLeaman brothers? I went there yesterday, I don\u2019t want to go there,\u201d you know. So it\ndepends. So each -- each gr-group from the Germans, they requested some people and it -\n- they were fair. They kept somehow a list and -- and you did for -- went to all kind of\ndifferent work. Especially it was winter, you know, wintertime the airport, which so big.\nOn the airport you had to go -- now, they could have -- I mean they could have af-afford\nand -- and clean the airport miles for the runways with -- with snow plows and\nbulldozers, whatever. So the airport, thousands -- 2000, with the shovel -- we had to have\nshovels and wheelbarrows, so you know, that\u2019s cheap labor. So we had --",
        "Q: So you moved the snow with your shovels?",
        "A: Well, you know, we get in -- we get in -- that\u2019s in Bellarouse, in the part of Poland, a\nawful lot of snow and cold -- winter cold and snow, so you had to clean the -- you know\nand the snow, in that wheelbarrow with the -- for tu -- with the shovel and there was\ncertain spot where you dumped it, you know, half a mile away and -- and they had cheap\nlabor. So this was wintertime that lasted -- you know, had long winters, sometime for\nthree, four, five months. And I was working -- everybody was working in the airport.\nAnd besides, you were sent some -- for instance, to work in the woods, to chop for the\nGermans. They did -- that\u2019s the same thing, they had to -- th-th-that\u2019s the only source of -\n- of cooking and so -- and heating sys -- heating. And so you had to go -- be requested,\nfor instance, a group of a few hundred people to go in the woods. Now, we were\nfortunate, we had woods near -- about 25 kilometers, actually -- the nearest part, we had\nlot of forest. So, they were sending in groups to the forest and sometimes for -- you had\nto stay there a week, you know, because it takes 20 -- no, it takes a long time til you go\nthere. So -- they supplied you -- the Judenrat, with certain rationing and you had to go\nthere and chop wood, cut logs, chop wood and then bring it back to the ghetto and for\nthat -- for the -- outside the ghetto population. So, this type of work. And -- and any -- I\nmean, there is -- there -- there was no labor -- it was no machinery which they had, no\nmachinery. You know they -- they used cheap labor -- machinery. Especi -- for instance,\nnow, they didn\u2019t like it -- the Germans were complaining. They said th-that they -- you\nknow, when they marched in and if -- we didn\u2019t have the roads like over here paved,\nsarek -- so they were complaining dowse dumb, foolish Polish, they -- and over -- it was\nmuddy, you know, they were go-going through the tanks and the -- you know, through\nthe roads, they made holes and they made a -- it was -- it was a -- a ma -- I mean it was a\nlot of mud and all that. He says, \u201cThey -- that -- look at the roads they have,\u201d they didn\u2019t\nlike the roads. Build them roads. So, we had to -- it was a -- a -- a caroda, that\u2019s a big job,\nalways crush stones. You know, with a sledgehammer -- you know, big stones, crush\nstones in order to fix the roads. So this is -- this is all the time, hundreds of -- you know,\nwhich is -- it was hard work and how did you get -- you know, from big stones, you had\nto crush the stones til you -- you know, you crush them to s-small and that\u2019s the way it --\nin roads and then you filled in the roads. They call it gravel here, like crushed -- you\nknow, they -- when you buy, you know, want it crush or gravel if you want stones graded\nup some -- some lots over here you see sometimes here. So this type of work -- all -- all\nkind of work -- all kind of work.",
        "Q: And -- and if you were working, would there be a German supervising you?",
        "A: Well, a-as a rule, when there was a group, yeah there were -- of course there were\nGermans, a few German, they would supervise you, yes. They were with dogs, supervise\nyou. And even -- even -- see, my brother now, eventually my brother was assigned, in\n1942, they needed some -- the -- the -- the mayor needed somebody around t-t-t-the\nhouse -- well, they call it a chores boy -- a chores --",

        "A: Ch -- yeah, ch -- yeah, yeah, chore. Help him get -- well, he chopped the wood and all\nthis and that. So he was picked up -- even though, he was picked up every morning from\nthe ghetto and to outside to the Burgermeister and they had them -- had a guard, you\nknow, he had a guard follow him. He -- he had a mansion, you know. The law went in,\nyou weren\u2019t allowed to walk on the sidewalk, you had to walk in the -- you know, on the\nwhat you call it, drain, in the -- on the road. On the right side of the road where the drain\nexists there. Yeah, and the SS man or whatev -- the soldier, you know, with the rifle, was\nfollowing on the s-side of -- following and y-you had to walk -- you had to walk in the dr\n-- on the s -- on the road -- on the right side of the road only, yeah, you had to walk.",
        "Q: But you're -- you\u2019re still living at home, in the house?",

        "A: Well, this was already -- forget about -- it was already not political, no, no, hm-mm.",
        "Q: W-Was anything going o-on though, in terms of discussions, among friends, about --",
        "A: Yeah, we --",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about that.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we were getting -- we were getting around, you know, in the ghetto in the\nbeginning, meeting in some houses and spend, you know, talking about a situation and --\nand playing chess and -- and still -- you know, cards, chess and -- and try to spend the\ntime, see. The Germans didn\u2019t -- when the Judenrat was established, the Germans didn\u2019t\nwent in in the ghetto too often. See? They only came in -- you know, the Judenrat had a\nspecial building, mostly on the outskirts, near that opening -- they call it in German,\nshlotbarn, where the gate opens up and not far from there was a big house, where the\nJudenrat were -- were located. And it was a big house with a lot of rooms, you know, it\nwas -- they took up -- rich person lived there. And the Germans used to have a -- I mean\nfrom -- from the -- not soldiers, but from the -- from the leaders, used to come down\nevery day to the Judenrat with requests about labor, we need labor here, labor there. We\nneed money here, we need always money and in the beginning, see, they could be bribed\na little. The Burgermeister, even the SS, they could be bribed. They knew, you know,\nthey mer -- you know, that they were looking for something. If they can get, they going\nto that. For instance, we had some selections wintertime in the ghetto. You know, they\nwant to make sure -- do -- a do -- about the rationing exactly. If somebody dies -- many\npeople or somebody gets born. So, they call that a selection. You had to go out and make\nsure, check exactly if it\u2019s -- the number\u2019s right or not right. But they really didn\u2019t know\nthe number and they didn\u2019t care. This was just -- you know, just fun for them to -- to --\nthey call it a selection, to go outside, you had to be -- wintertime, summertime or\nwintertime, go out --",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- and lined up in four lines and they going to -- yeah, they counting -- they counting and\nthen it keeps you -- and they counted and then you know, you freeze, with little children,\ncrippled people, no [indecipherable] to go out and sometimes it lasted for three -- for\nthree or four hours, finish the counting, the -- I don\u2019t know. Counting goo -- you can go\nback, you know, go back. Quite often they did that. They called it the counting.",
        "Q: H-How would they call you to that?",

        "Q: How would you know? Was there a bell or something?",
        "A: No, no, the Juden, see, th -- they told the Judenrat that this and this day, at eight -- such a\ntime, and the police and you know the wa -- police and it was postered, you know, on the\nstreets, in the -- certain places and that you had to be out -- be ready for this time, you\nknow, yeah. This is -- everything, see, organized. They didn\u2019t -- they had the Judenrat\nthere to organize all that.",

        "Q: -- at some level, with the Germans?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, see, in general they did -- the Judenrat were fair in Proushinna. There were some\ncomplaints, you know what I mean. There\u2019s always certain complaint. But as a rule, on\nthe average, there were -- they were trying -- they were trying the best. Now, they were\nagainst organizing or something, you know, they didn\u2019t allow that. They were\nresponsible, you know what I mean? They -- you know, if they didn\u2019t know in the\nbeginning, but eventually, when it came out, you know, later on, when it\u2019s got -- wh-what\nI come to, the 19 -- in the 1942, I know when they start already organizing. So they were\nof course against that, because they were responsible. First of all, they were responsible\nfor the population of the ghetto and they were the first one we sacrificed. So, you know,\nyou -- I don\u2019t know, you can blame him or you\u2019re not -- you know what I mean? It\u2019s a\ntough situation byegot, tough. Don\u2019t forget that -- to that -- 1t was reprisals, it\u2019s not like in\nnormal times you get somebody or you get a -- you [indecipherable] a partisan, or a\nrevolt or somebody -- instigator, you know, they take revenge. If the Germans find out --\nfor instance, if I did something or I\u2019m doing something or I\u2019m preparing for something,\nyou know, not only -- you know they were, oh my family, my -- you know, they would\nget, oh my family and my ga -- uncles and -- and nieces and nephews and who knows\nhow many, you know, responsible. It\u2019s -- so it was -- it was at -- yeah, it was risky. It was\nrisky.",
        "Q: T-Tell us --",
        "A: It\u2019s very, very risky. You know, you didn\u2019t want to have on your conscience, that you\nknow, you did something on account you saw and the same thing, the Judenrat had a\nproblem. The same, they didn\u2019t want to -- yeah. But they didn\u2019t know -- they didn\u2019t\nknow, they didn\u2019t allow. They lest eventually when they did discovered, late -- in the 19 -\n- late 1942, part of it, it was already too late, you know. It was already too late. You\nknow, we had to -- you know, the way we -- the way you -- the -- the organization, we\nstarted it, had to be so secret, you know, you had to sa -- that you -- you -- even your own\nfamily didn\u2019t have to know what you\u2019re doing.",
        "Q: T-Tell us about that. How -- how -- when did the idea first emerge --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in your head, that hey --",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you, because I didn\u2019t -- I want to say that in 19 -- when they established the\nghetto in 1941, in -- in October -- now, in beginning 1942, they broke into Proushinna\nghetto from surrounding towns, from Ginefcare, from Narefkar, from Bielovairsh and\nKarminitz. Four cities and then from Bialystok, those were little cities. And what\nhappened, fortunately, you know, most of the little cities, you know, in 1941 or in 19,\nbeginning \u201842, they liquidated them, you know? They didn\u2019t bother even establishing a\nghetto. They liquidate them -- they -- they killed them on the spot or they took them out\nin the woods -- took them out in the woods and killed. And then, after -- after that, 1t was\nof course -- it -- 1t was too much of a -- they didn\u2019t have the power yet, the -- the -- the\nmanpower, it was a tall job. And -- so they start bringing 1n in Proushinna ghettos, of s-\nsome -- those that are fortunate and the ghetto swelled from about -- we had -- like is\nmentioned, 6000 Jews, 1000 from here, 2000 from here, so finally the ghetto swelled to\n12,000. And some -- some were brought in by trucks from Ginefcare. And some were\nmarched by foot for 80 -- you know, from -- especially from the Narefkar, the city and\nwe had to take in a family from there and they marched them. They marched them, you\nknow, the whole -- from, it\u2019s about, I would say maybe 16 -17 kilometers, can you\nimagine? So half -- what happened to the cripples, from the children and the -- and the\nwhat you call it? A lot of them you know, lost -- lost parents, air children. They couldn\u2019t\nma -- you know and those who couldn\u2019t make it, they shot them on the spot. And\neventually those who made it, brought them in in the ghetto. So we heard -- we heard\nfrom those people, we right there you know, we had to take in. You had a big house, we\ntake in some families, you know. Some says, you know, and they\u2019ve lost a father or lost a\n-- lost a little baby or lost a child, yeah. And then they brought in from Bialystok, it\u2019s a\nbig city, Bialystok, so they brought in 2000 from Bialystok in Proushinna, in our town.\nNow, I want to mention that Proushinna and the vicinity was enclosed in the Third Reich,\nthey call 1t, you know? They incorporated -- fer-favored the Third Reich, we going to be\ntreated a little better. Wa -- the reason they incorporated Proushinna in the Third Reich, 1s\nbecause we were near Bielovairsh and Bielovairsh a forest, were the famous forest in\nPoland. One of the biggest famous forests in Poland, that\u2019s about 60 or 70 kilometers\nfrom Proushinna. And there were famous for certain animals. And -- and Goering and all\nthe groups and -- and -- and -- and Himmler, they used to hunt there. That\u2019s the reason --\nthat\u2019s the reason they incorporated Proushinna and even Bialystok, the certain territory\nand they call it to the east, Prussia. Not to -- you know, greater Germany is Prussia. So\ncomparison with other ghettos, maybe we were treated a little bit in the beginning, better,\nbecause we didn\u2019t have those -- th-they call it aktiones -- actions. The German cou -- you\nknow, aktiones, like in other cities, they requested, let\u2019s see, right away, 1000 inslawnie\n2000 - 5000 action and they -- they took them out someplace in -- in certain, you know,\nravines and certain places right away and -- even 19 -- in -- in the beginning of the war,\nand they killed. So we didn\u2019t have that, we didn\u2019t have the actions, you know, like\n[indecipherable] hundred and except -- except it was -- you know, every once in awhile,\nevery day there was some casualties, you know we had -- you know, the -- when outsider\n-- some -- they took people off the stru -- 60 years old. So it means some -- some were\nmistreated and some couldn\u2019t make it, some were weak, so there was some casualties.\nWe had to bring them in in the ghetto. So we were told, you know, there is two or three,\nevery once in awhile I heard that they brought them in -- in -- in the ghetto and -- for\nburial. Now -- now that -- my -- what I want to mention is this, I had an uncle the one --\nthe one was -- yes, you know, associated in the -- for the farm. Now, we had a bakery in\nthe town -- in the -- in the ghetto. We weren\u2019t getting bread, we were getting flour. And\nwe were the bakery in the -- in -- in the ghetto and the fire -- the fire engine, you know,\nthe f -- the -- it was -- it\u2019s -- in the ghetto, we suppose we were in a fire, you know, the --\nthe -- we had to take care -- the fire station was in -- the same -- already was -- it was\nstationed in -- in Proushinna ghetto and with a -- with a hospital in Proushinna ghetto. So,\nyeah, we had to speak in my -- my uncle, so he f -- like -- was a farmer and we had some\n-- a fleet of horses and wagons to -- any time the German requested, for instance, if you\nhave to take down 50 people to the forest or 100 people to forest. So they told us, they\nwere -- they were the truckers, we didn\u2019t have no truck, they were -- truck had taken the\npeople down the forest and see, my uncle was killed. They -- they -- what do you call it?\nThe experiments with dogs, yeah. He was torn by dogs.",
        "Q: Can you explain a little more?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Can you just explain a little more?",
        "A: Well, the experiments with dogs are -- one dog -- how long 1s going to take -- how long 1s\ngoing to take dogs to kill a person. You understand? Ah. You know, th-th-they\nexperiment, they wanted -- they wanted to know how long 1s going to take one dog or\ntwo dogs, finally, yeah. So, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a -- that -- that happened. That made a big\nimpression on me.",
        "Q: When did you -- can you tell us a little bit more about when you began to think and talk\nwith your friends about your --",
        "A: Well, this happened in 1942, this and then -- see, we had so many brought in in that\nghetto, escapees. Like I mention, they brought some in from different towns. And then\nthey used to pick some -- find some Jews from the outside -- for instance, and somebody\nsurvived and they used to drop him in in the ghetto. So, you know, we heard all this -- all\nkind of stories, so I was wondering, you know, they could have killed them, now why did\nthey brought them in in the ghetto? Some work -- he was telling us that he survived\nsomehow, I know some way and from the little village and he was wandering and they\ncaught him and they put -- the Germans caught him and drop him in into the ghetto. So, it\n-- it mean -- it, you know, it reached your mind that understanding there is -- there is\nsomething -- you know, it\u2019s a matter of time. Now, why did they have to bring in -- I was\no figure, why did they have to bring 1n those escapees, those -- those survivors? They\ncould have killed them, they dropped them in the -- you know, many -- they dropped him\nin in the ghetto. We hear -- we heard all kind of atrocities with -- you know, leaving a trai\n-- you know, leaving witnesses. So we understood that\u2019s -- you know, there\u2019s a matter of\ntime, you know, it\u2019s a matter of time. And -- and fortunately, when -- you know, in -- the\n-- when the group was established, many -- there\u2019s a lot of -- from the group, worked in\ndifferent kind of places. One from our group worked in the woods, sent to cut fo -- for --\nyou know, for a week and he was work and they left -- you know, they stayed there in the\nwoods for a week and at night Russian couple -- couple -- Russian partisans came over.\nAnd the Germans slept already there. They came over and they says, \u201cWell, if you going\nto get some arms, we\u2019ll take you in.\u201d They were -- it wasn\u2019t organized yet. You know, it\nwas -- it was independent groups, I call it, you know it -- it was still -- you\u2019ve -- you\u2019 ve --\nyou could find in the woods that time, criminals. You can find escapees from -- pr-\nprisoners, Russian prisoners, [indecipherable] you know, they went in in the woods. They\nhad the ammunition instead of getting, you n -- take a big -- taken in prison. And they --\nthere was all, you know, and -- and there was some -- for instance, farmers for the boys.\nThe older people -- the older, they didn\u2019t take. If a farmer had couple boys, especially\nboys, they used to take them to work in Germany, to work on the German farms, because\nyou know, they needed help. All Germany [indecipherable] all -- they can use all the --\nall the -- all the men -- all the men they could. So they can get cheap labor, so they tried\nfarmers, get the -- get those farmer\u2019s boys to shf -- go to Germany. Now, they didn\u2019t want\nto go and they knew the territory, see? Thes -- they went in in the woods. And -- and they\nstayed in -- you know, sometimes in the night they\u20191l go back to their parents and find\nout. So -- so there was all kind of groups there in the woods and this is the first -- the first\nfriend we met at two -- a Russian -- they were Russian Bitar, so they said, \u201cWell, try and\nget some arms, or get some money and maybe we can, you know, if you get some ar --\nmoney we can -- we\u2019ll take you in some.\u201d But, you know, one of the -- the -- from the --\nthe man from our group was responsive for this man. He was responsible for this man I\nmean, actually one or two or three could have -- could have -- they would have taken it.\nYou know they would -- they would accept two or three, three or few, not ag -- not 50 or\n100. But you know, he wouldn\u2019t -- you we -- were responsible were sent for the Judenrat\nand -- and if you don\u2019t come, you were accounted for the people. Now, if you\u2019Il come\nwith three less, what happened to the other three? You know, it wa -- it -- you know, it\nwas -- y-you had the moral responsibility.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about why you didn\u2019t just run away right then?",
        "A: Well, right then, well, I wasn\u2019t there, but I mean, I could -- if I were there --",
        "Q: No, right, but what I mean [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, so, that\u2019s -- oh, there\u2019s some partisan in the meantime in the woods. so we started -\n- you know, to get organized and try and get some arm and ammunition. In the meantime,\nwe know there\u2019s some, you know, in the woods. It\u2019s -- this 1s far away actually, this isn\u2019t\navail -- over here. Y-You know, this 1s about 50 kilometers. And so the youths, in\ngeneral, got thats understanding already, you know, because you don\u2019t believe, you\nknow, the human nature. You still believe maybe you -- I mean, you have figured -- it\u2019s -\n- maybe you\u2019re going to -- the time will come, maybe the war will be over and maybe\nsomething is go -- going to happen, yeah, a miracle\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re not going\nto have any miracle. It was a panic already in the ghetto in 1942, we heard about all the\nliquidations from the cities, and from the -- from other parts, from little towns and they\nwere bringing them 1n in the ghetto and leaving witnesses, so we knew what\u2019s was going\non and all. So they -- every -- every -- you know, a realization that you might know.\nThere\u2019s something, you know, there is -- there is -- tricky, we have to -- we have to do\nsomething, we have to get organized and -- and we not going to go -- we not -- you know\n-- when it comes for -- if and when it comes the time, we not going to go. Worst if -- even\nif we not going to get out, we figured we going to even burn up the ghetto or do\nsomething. I mean, even if you, you know, burn up, let\u2019s -- anybody, whatever ca -- can\nescape, can escape, wor -- worse scenario. So, y -- whoever\u2019s can escape -- they knew\nalready in the ghetto, their -- it -- it co -- you know, when the group was established, now\n-- later on, when we got established, so it was a problem to get -- how you get arm and\nammunition. Besi -- yeah?",
        "Q: But, bef-before we go to that, let me ask you a little bit about -- I mean, did you actually\nhave a meeting and -- with some of your friends and say, okay, we are a group now and\nthese are the requirements to be in it? Or --",
        "A: Oh, yeah, yeah. We had -- we had a -- we had a m-meetings -- we used to had a meeting\nand each, you know, from the group, each one worked in different kind of locations and\none of our group worked in the warehouses where there were -- you know, there was 50\nor 100 people working there, or one or two people from our group worked in the\nwarehouses, where was the Russian leftover. And there was ammunition, they were cr --\nyou know, sorting and crating, to ship it to Germany. And so it was a plan that time when\nwe\u2019re -- how to -- you could -- you know, you -- you could s-steal sometimes. It\u2019s -- it\nwas easy to hide or something, but the problem is how you going to get in in the ghetto,\nyou know? You could have -- it -- it was -- wouldn\u2019t be a problem to leave it outside a\nghetto. Very easy, because they were working outside the ghetto, you could have buried\nsomeplace. But it\u2019s -- 1t wouldn\u2019t be used, you know, how you going to get to it? You\nknow, the important thing is to have it with you in the ghetto, you know? The -- the --\nyou know, the arm -- ammunition or whatever. So this was a problem, because the ghetto\nwas -- you know, like I mentioned, was surrounded and it was patrolled all the time with\n-- with police and they had the -- for dogs, Germans and collaborators. We had the -- we\nhad the Lithuanians in Poland, too. And it was pretty strict, you know. You couldn\u2019t get\nout. In order, you know, it was you -- you were -- you were locked in. No communication\nwith the outside at all. No [indecipherable] men and you know, not far -- what I\nmentioned one still living in h-homes, at 60 colone. We didn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t send any\nletters, we couldn\u2019t communicate, we couldn\u2019t travel, we couldn\u2019t go out. So, we had\nsome people working there in the ammunitions. We had some people working in the\nwoods, cutting the woods and we had some people -- we had a engineer. We had a secret\nradio -- a engineer, which he fixed up. We had a f -- secret radio, which we can listen for\nthe outside world and you know, and you still worried whofer organized, a little bit. But\nmostly we used -- we used to get the news from the papers, from the German papers.\nThey -- I mean yid -- they let you have a paper, for you can not read it anyway or\nsomething. So whatever, you know, we -- so we knew a little situation what\u2019s going on\non the front, how far they are, yeah, how far they are, yeah. But it was a secret radio, so\nwe knew a little, we\u2019d from -- from the public -- Br-British public broadcasting.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, so we -- we knew from both sides. So that\u2019s the way the group started at. And --",
        "Q: How many people?",
        "A: It was actually -- the group was 18 and three women is 21, and 10 is 31. 10 from our\ngroup was out -- they had co-contact already, s -- in -- in another part, the adkund. This\nwas -- what I mentioned they worked chopping the wood. Now, this was far away. Now,\nthe nearest part from -- from Proushinna was 30 kilometers, the nearest wood. This 1s\nalready the -- the -- they call that the trouknavitch, that\u2019s a mosher forest. Now, we got in\nki -- a couple partisans got in contact with our group and they used to come in -- the\ngroup -- our group already had a secret tunnel, I didn\u2019t even know where it was. Only\ncertain -- you know, I -- I know there 1s -- there 1s a se -- a secret tunnel going in and out\nof the ghetto. So, we s -- two part-partisans -- Russian partisans, they used to come in in\nthe ghetto and be in contact with our group. And they -- the same, they told us to get\norganized and try and get some ammunition or money. I mean they figured money, they\ncan buy it. It was not -- you know, that -- it was still independent groups, it was not -- no\norganization at all, it was the rule of the jungle yet. So you figured, get some money, you\nsee? So they -- eventually 10 people from our group, left in Septem -- October, four\nmonths before the liquida -- in October, they left already in the woods. And they learned\na little from those couple partisans, you know, from the Russians, how to make a bunker,\nhow to live, you know, live in the woods. So they stayed there and quite often they used\nto warn -- a few of them used to come back here and in the ghetto, we had contact with\nthem -- used to come in, I still didn\u2019t know how they went in through the secret tunnel.\nAnd that\u2019s the way we had -- we had th -- th -- we used to communicate with each other.",
        "Q: Did -- did you have an oath or something, when you did form your group, was there any\ndiscussion at one point saying this is why we\u2019re doing it or I swear I will do this or that?\nWas there ever any sort of formal -- formalization to --",
        "A: It\u2019s very secret.",
        "Q: Commitment?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s a ga -- it\u2019s ver -- 1t\u2019s yeah, it\u2019s very secret, very secret and that\u2019s -- nobody\nknew about it. It was so secret and so confidential, that you know that your own parents\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on. Because you -- you didn\u2019t want to -- you didn\u2019t want to -\n- what you call it -- tell even your parents, they wouldn\u2019t sleep nights, you know what I\nmean? They wouldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if they would object or not object, but you -- you\njust -- you just couldn\u2019t do it, yo-you know what I mean? In case it is -- it had to be so\nsecret that -- in -- nobody -- nobody -- nobody knew about this group, about our group.",
        "Q: But can you tell us what it was? I mean, did you swear an oath, or --",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t -- we really -- we -- we really didn\u2019t swear an o-oath, but we -- you\nknow, we cooperated. We knew there was some -- you know, there was some\ncooperation between our group. See, my brother was little older and he was more\ninstrumental -- I\u2019m going to go -- this is later on, I would imagine, that -- so that\u2019s the\nway the group was established. So the 10 were there and we were working -- the 18.\nNow, there was some other groups, we didn\u2019t know about them. We not -- were not the\nexceptional, no, there was some other groups. You think there are -- you know, we\nthought we -- we di -- we thought we maybe were the only ones, but there was some\ngroups, eventually we met them -- a gr -- another group, we met them in the woods. So, it\nwas very secret.",
        "Q: But you did know -- if you were in the ghetto, you knew the 18 people, you could\nrecognize their face and they -- you knew they were part of your group?",
        "A: Oh, we knew exactly, I mean, knew exactly.",
        "Q: Okay. So you knew.",
        "A: Each one knew exactly..",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, we used to get together and this group, the 18, our group, we had our own bunker,\ntunnel built. In case -- but we didn\u2019t have time yet to -- it was -- we found a spot\nsomehow near the border where you can get out. There was some farmland and barns.\nIt\u2019s easy to -- you know, easy to get -- easy to escape in case emergency.",
        "Q: So, what was your goal at the group? You were trying to prepare for, is -- an escape?",
        "A: Well, yeah. We were trying -- we were -- actually, we knew that we were going to get --\nescape. We knew that we\u2019re going to either escape, if -- 1f not escape -- the 10 are already\nout. Now, we were left to organize some more, you know, til y-y -- it still, 1t -- it -- it -- in\nthe beginning it wasn\u2019t 18, it was si -- 10, then 12 and then you know, it wa -- another\none because we needed -- we needed a -- a -- a carpenter, because in order to smuggle in\nthe -- the rifles, many times it\u2019s too long, we had to break it in half, break the wood off in\norder to, you know, in order to smuggle in, this is too big and too long. So we needed a\ncarpenter in order to fix -- fix the rifle up, yeah. And -- and then there was couple from --\nin the group and they were much older than I am -- two brothers and they were dealing in\n-- in -- they were dealing 1n -- in the -- f -- with lumber. And they knew the territ --",
        "Q: It\u2019s easy to -- you know, easy to get -- easy to escape in case emergency.",
        "Q: So, what was your goal at the group? You were trying to prepare for -- is -- an escape?",
        "A: Well, yeah. We were trying -- we were -- actually, we knew that we were going to get --\nescape.

And -- and then there was couple from --\nin the group and they were much older than I am -- two brothers and they were dealing in\n-- in -- they were d-dealing in -- in the -- f -- with lumber. And they knew the territory\nexactly, you know. They used to buy logs and ta -- take 1t down to the sawmill -- we had\na sawmill, too in Syracuse -- industry. So, they knew the be -- territory a little there, so\nthey --",
        "Q: In Proushinna.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: You had a sawmill in Proushinna.",
        "A: Oh we -- yeah, we had a sa --",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: There was a sawmill in Proushinna, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. So we took now -- and they were cousins to the one from the -- the 10 who left in\nthe woods, it was my Bitar commander. He was the first one organizing, you know, th-\nthe 10. And his name was Barro Sagell -- Barro Sagell. So, mostly I would say there\u2019s a\nlot of -- majority is -- 1s from Bitar, would say half of the group is from Bitar. Now, he va\n-- he is the first one that -- from the 10, he left his younger brother, then 1t went in the ya\n-- [indecipherable] saloontashur with his wife, he took his wife and he was a mechanic\nwhere he -- he belonged to the group and then it was a -- a britebar five, 10 and it was\ntwo from Bialystok. And th-those from the 10, quite often used to come down in -- wa --\nlike I mention, in the ghetto and we used to have contact with them.",
        "Q: So you and your brother are doing this and you didn\u2019t tell your parents anything about it?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know, no. You see, I -- like I -- I mentioned to you before, my father was\npessimist a little. Now, now, by ra -- by wanting -- geographically, maybe he was right.\nNo, he was a educated man, you know, he drew a map, never forget. He drew a map and\nhe says, \u201cBoys.\u201d We were ta -- no, we were talking some, we was talking about -- th-they\ndidn\u2019t know the -- you know, that we are organized, what we should do or something like\nthat. We, well -- planning, wer -- you know, saying some and w-we going to escape, no,\nwe going to do something. H-H-He knew, but he didn\u2019t know about the group -- he knew\nthere -- because he drew a map and he says, \u201cBoys, look, here is Poland.\u201d And then he\ndrew, you know, you got Czechoslovakia, he knew exactly all the -- Europe. He says,\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a single country -- neutral country. You got Sweden and Switzerland.\nNow, all Europe was already taken. Now, let\u2019s -- even if you\u2019ll get out the ghetto,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cyou got such a long way to go and you going to be ca-caught,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\nknow, you get a caught by the -- bun -- by the certain groups, let\u2019s see, unfriendly\nGentiles, he\u2019ll -- he\u2019ll give you out,\u201d because it was a prize, you know, to catching a Jew,\ntwo kilograms of sugar. That\u2019s all. If -- you know, if you find a Jew hiding or if you find\nsomebody and you deliver him to the Germans, you\u2019ll get two kilogram of sugar. And\nsome went for that. Sugar was, you know, a luxury, two kilogram of sugar. So he says, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t,\u201d-- it\u2019s a lost cause to him. He says it\u2019s a lost cause, yeah. So he didn\u2019t vel -- you\nknow, he disco -- he well, I don\u2019t know, he -- bara -- one thing he was right. He didn\u2019t\nknow we had connection with Bitar. He didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t tell him that already and\nlater on the connection, and all this. So he\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know to say if it was right or not\nright, who knows? I mean that -- geographically he was -- he was right, because it was --\nyou know, it\u2019s near, if you have a border, you could have even get out. But he didn\u2019t\nrealize, you know, if we did know there is some woods, partisans, we don\u2019t have to go.\nNow, if we wouldn\u2019t have the woods near, you know, it\u2019d be a problem, you know. Oh,\nyou know, if some -- from Warsaw, other cities, from Lodz, where they going to go? You\nsee, they fought, you know, in Warsaw ghetto. They -- you know, those -- those -- the\nresistant lasted for month. For month they resisted, it\u2019s longer than -- longer -- longer\nthan the -- than the -- the -- than French [indecipherable], French capitulated in -- what is\nit, in 10 - 12 days.",
        "Q: So when you -- I\u2019m jumping ahead just a little bit now, but when you ultimately did\nleave, you weren\u2019t able -- I mean, were you able to say good-bye to your parents?",
        "A: No. Because, you see what happened is, now we had to -- it was emergency already. We\ndidn\u2019t expect that. It came an order in -- in -- it was ninete -- in -- in 1943, in January s --\nthe 27 it started. Sometimes a -- the 26th, came an order that -- you know, they gave it\nthe Judenrat that the Jews from Proushinna are going to be deported. They didn\u2019t say\nwhere they\u2019re going to be deported to Saleesia -- Salessia, a part of Poland and you\u2019re\ngoing to be working -- because I -- I didn\u2019t escape the first -- you know, I -- I remember\nthe first night and the men were going to be working, y-you know, nothing\u2019s going to\nhappen to them and bitechis and what are you going to do the -- and the women -- and the\n-- all the women and the children are going to be near there, all kind of baloney. Who in\nthe hell you going to fool, I mean. So we got already caught, we could have -- you know,\nwe didn\u2019t expect the date exactly, we could have gone out before. See, we could have\ngone out before -- they said, you know, either through the tunnel, or we could have cut\nthe wire, the same thing or we cut the -- break the fence, cut the wire, what we did, yeah.\nSo -- so it -- when it came out the -- they announced it -- the liquidation that time. We\nwere trying to break through, our crew. And we were followed by a mob. It was six\no\u2019clock, you know, it was still light. And you know, the -- the ghetto was so packed,\neverybody\u2019s on the street and they see you. And, you know, everybody see you,\neverybody follows you and they figured maybe they going to go through with us. And it\nwas imposs -- I mean, they would have -- we couldn\u2019t take a chance, because it would be\na lost cause. The Germans -- the Germans, you know, the patrol would have discovered\nit. So -- I mean, such a mob. So we decided we going to -- we went back to a -- where the\nbunker, we sit out in the bunker -- with a bunker -- and we tried for the second night. But\nalready it -- in the town, already they heard, they knew, you know, the group there,\nmumb boys -- there\u2019s the group exists. It was already going around in the ghetto, so the\nGermans probably knew -- know there is part of th-the -- you know the -- there\u2019s a group.\nSo we hopes they\u2019re -- the -- they -- they were saying wa -- you know, I discovered that\nwhen I was liberated, you know, some of them ca -- some of them -- I didn\u2019t even know\nthey were sent to Auschwitz when we escaped. We didn\u2019t know where we were going,\nsee? And so they -- s-some girls were saying I hope, you know the group survives it. And\nmaybe they going to have witnesses telling, you know, the story or whatever. So, the\nsecond night, we decided we going to fight through, break through, whatever happens. I\nmean, it\u2019s already -- so we still -- we still -- if w-we had maybe about 50 people followed\nus in our group. Some went through with us. Older people, older men with children. They\nwent through. Finally, you know, they -- they -- yeah, th-they discovered -- they did dis --\nyou know, eventually, they -- the guard went by and discovered that -- you know, it is a\nmab something went through. And we f -- we -- we picked a place, exact -- you know, we\npicked a place where to go through, so we\u2019ll be near the Christian side where there 1s\nsome -- not homes, but _ f-f-farmland mostly with -- with barns, big barns and hay piles\naround, so you can -- you can sneak it in and as long you get out, you know. So you have\n-- SO you can -- you can take off.",
        "Q: Okay. [inaudible]\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: I want to go back on a couple details -- you jumped ahead a -- a bit, but I\u2019m wondering if\nyou could tell us a little bit about your brother -- your brother very active in this\norganization. And also the planning for getting arms for your group.",
        "A: Yeah. Okay, now there were some ways of getting in the f -- arms in the ghetto through a\nsecret -- the only way is the secret tunnel, like the first -- the first 10, they cu -- they\nwent in and they went out. So they could, you know, you could have send it out with\nthem, a rifle, or bring it in, but in a -- in a bigger form [indecipherable] form, you know,\nit was a problem. Because every time you entered the ghetto by the gate, you were\nsearched. All the time. You were searched completely. You know, maybe you have s-\nsome -- it depends on the guard. Certain guard, if he\u2019ll find you carry a little extra bread,\nso he didn\u2019t mind. And if it\u2019s another guard, he\u2019|l stop you for -- you know, if you\nworked in certain place and they gave you a little extra piece of bread or something else,\nhe\u2019 ll let you in. You know, they search you pretty -- pretty thorough. And it was -- it was\ntough. Very stri -- t-tough to bring in arms and that. So you had to, 1n order -- in order to\nbring in a substantial amount -- a big amount and to increase the group, you had to f --\nhave a certain plan, a certain plan. So -- see, my brother was assigned, like I mentioned\nbefore, to work for the Burgermeister, actually for the wife. So, around the house,\nchopping wood and cleaning and sh -- the Burgermeister\u2019s wife was a -- what you call it?\nI would call her a soft -- nice, soft woman. And she f -- and she felt little sorry\nsometimes, so she\u2019ll give my brother a little extra sometime, to bring it to the family. And\nSO we used, you know, the occasion on that, so figure -- one time he asked her, he said\nthe mother is sick and you -- you know, and it\u2019s cold in the house, if you can have certain\namount of -- he was chopping wood for them, plenty of wood anyway and -- and if he\ncan take some home. Now, in order to -- how you going to bring it home? So he says,\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to get a sled.\u201d And so she agreed and the Burgermeister didn\u2019t\nobject. So we had to build, you know, we had to, you know, it\u2019s not a sled with a ho --\nwith a horse pulling sled. It was a big sled anyway and like I say, we had a carpenter, so\nwe had to fix it up deep enough, make sure it\u2019s got a good bottom, so you can put a good\n-- quite a few -- quite a few rifles. Now, on the ammunition is where it was easy\nsometimes --",
        "Q: You made a place, a --",
        "A: A double --",
        "Q: -- in the sled?",
        "A: It was a big sled, with a false back, enclosed, so and shou -- hollowed back. So, it\u2019s big\nenough in the sled, for instance to pu -- to -- two or three people to go in and hide. You --\nspace enough. So we\u2019d -- and having those already the group -- boys, ha -- stealing and\nhiding, laying outside the warehouses, which 1s not far from the airport and it was not far\nreally, from the Burgermeister. Now, he had -- working for the -- for the Burgermeister,\nhe was outside a ghetto, so he had a -- he had a -- a -- a paper, what you call it? A -- a\ncard, so he know -- with his picture, so he could move. Sometimes she\u2019!l send him there -\n- so he could move himself already outside. Once in awhi -- not all the time, once in\nawhile. So, it was made the plan, that -- that is to the sled and he went to the -- you know,\nnear -- near that contraband where it was -- where it was hidden. And there was couple,\nthe ca -- from our group -- the couple guys, they had to [indecipherable] quick and load\nit, filled it up with that -- with the ammunition that time. You had a lot of hand grenades,\nespecially they had type -- the Russian type ha -- hand grenades. It\u2019s a small and this was\nvery important. Yeah, you know, the hand grenades. It\u2019s light and -- and you can do a lot\nof damage with that. It\u2019s more than a rifle, we had a lot of this and -- and we had a -- a\nmach -- a machine gun. I know that was -- you know, you know, you -- can you imagine\nwith a machine gun? Machine gun -- how you going to smuggle in a machine gun? And\nseven ri -- I think it was seven rifles and a machine gun and three automatic rifles and a\nlot of ammunition. And brought it to the Burgermeister and loaded up the wood on top of\nthat and he had to s -- he -- he -- somehow he had -- he\u2019s -- he is -- his assistant, whoever\n-- the chauffeur, you know -- you know, the bigger wintertime, say wintertime, he had a\ncar, but wintertime he had a beautiful pair of horses and a sled, you know those -- you see\nit on the movies sometime. Oh, what a beautiful sled and horses and taking them down,\nwintertime to the ghetto, back and forth. And drive the car and the same thing, the SS,\nthey had horses. So, he brought it back to the Burgermeister and he loaded up the -- and\none of that -- she persuaded one of the chauffeurs to attach to the s -- to the sled with the\nhorses and I was waiting already outside the -- inside the ghetto and here, you know, he\nhad me in leftero for the Burgermeister, they know sled 1s coming, deal with that, it\u2019s\nlegal. I took it right in -- into -- I took it right in. This was the time already, we lost -- our\nhouse was outside the ghetto. We had to move out or move to my aunt. We stayed with\nthis one -- with the -- the widow, the one -- that one a -- the one lost, you know, the\nhusband. What I mentioned was killed by the dogs. That\u2019s my aunt we moved in. We\nmoved in with her and she had four children, four girls and we were four children, eight.\nAnd we stayed there already and we saw -- I brought 1n the sled and they were, you\nknow, that time mother and the -- and the \u201cOh, good,\u201d you know, \u201cwood. Oh good,\ngood.\u201d But you know, I had to f -- had to find a place for to -- to -- to hide that and they\nhad -- and they -- they had, where they stayed, they had a little barn down there anyways,\nso that\u2019s the way, eventually, was hidden there, and --",
        "Q: In the barn?",
        "A: In the barn was, yeah -- I had to take it in and they didn\u2019t have to -- no one in my family,\nthey didn\u2019t know. Nobody knew about it. Nobody knew about it, not even the -- not even\nthe other groups, you know, they knew they wouldn\u2019t know. I knew where it -- where I\nput it. I knew where to hide it. And eventually we used that.",
        "Q: We-Were you afraid when you did something like that [indecipherable].",
        "A: Afraid for -- in the ghetto?",
        "Q: Well, when you were actually bringing the sled in, there are guns underneath. What if\nyou\u2019re found out?",
        "A: Who, who?",
        "Q: You. Were you thinking about that?",
        "A: Oh, oh, well, n -- it seems to me that time, it was -- we were pretty sure, if -- pretty sure if\n-- it\u2019s always a risk, but I mean, 1-1f was permission given and she gave -- the wife gave\npermission -- if you say the husband knew, because she had to tell the husband, you\nknow, tell -- husband had to tell the chauffeur, she didn\u2019t have much to -- much to sa --\nyou know, to sa -- have to say -- have the authority to tell him. Yeah, the Burgermeister\ncan tell that -- the chauffeur or -- or -- ta -- to do that. N-N -- Well, it was risk -- it was a\nrisk, but w-we\u2019re sure that we\u2019re going to -- this -- I think we\u2019re going to make it. We\u2019re\nsure we\u2019re going to make it. As -- as -- as -- as long -- as long they going to stop it at the\ngate and then -- so they see it\u2019s wood, or something like that. It was a risk. It\u2019s a\nhistorical risk. It just -- you know, it\u2019s just a mazel, that\u2019s all. I mean, it\u2019s a --",
        "Q: A what?",
        "A: They say Yiddish mazel -- mazel, luck. Who knows, call it -- either -- either call it luck\nor call it -- I just -- grace of God -- I don\u2019t know, the word just to use for that[inaudible].\nSo this -- this helped us and we had silver and we escaped the second night. We --",
        "Q: Bef-Before you go to that, I want you tell me a little bit more -- what was the idea -- did\nyou actually ya -- you said you were going to break the fence, did -- what were you going\nto cut the wire? What was the plan?",
        "A: The plan was, that time, on the second night, that we going to t-try and break through in\nthat spot there -- where we picked out a spot near -- it\u2019s already the farmhouses there and\n-- and we\u2019ll cut, you know -- you know, we\u2019ll cut the wire and we\u2019ll go through. And in\ncase we not going to er -- what -- in case we have to -- dis -- we\u2019ll be discovered, so we\u2019ll\nfight through. I mean, we\u2019ll fight through. There\u2019s no other chance. So it means, okay,\nwhatever will go through, will through. I mean, they patrolled a few -- we\u2019ll fight\nthrough, whatever -- we\u2019ll go through there. We\u2019ll go through -- we lost -- we lost three\nmen. You know, diff -- and like I said, a mob followed. Even though a mob followed us,\nabout maybe 50, but I think 30 went through with us. You know, some survived. Older\npeople, they survived.",
        "Q: S-So you told everyone to come at a certain time and you gave everyone a gun? I mean,\nwhat did -- how did you distribute the arms?",
        "A: Oh, this was -- oh this, they are -- that time -- the arms -- this was a -- about four -- three\nmonths before -- it was in a long -- three months before. Then we had to stri -- we\ndistributed the arms. This wasn\u2019t -- this -- th-the night before -- way before. This was\nabout three -- this was like I\u2019m saying three or four months before, when we were --\ndecided, you know, the you decided that we going to -- that -- that we\u2019re going to do\nsomething. We had already f -- 10 men in the woods and that\u2019s all we are left 1s to -- just\nto organize and get arms. You know, get to -- get more organize -- more important was to\nget the arms, because we were told the -- the few partisans, it says we can not accept you\ntil you\u2019ll get arms. Or if -- arms or money. Maybe they going to -- the money -- th -- I --\nthe understanding, I figure they would -- they wouldn\u2019t -- they would take the money.\nThose -- those time it was in the -- on the -- underground movement wasn\u2019t organized\nyet. Each one was -- each group was living independently. So, because when we went --\nyou know, when we went through, we came in the woods, we expected -- we supposed to\n-- you know, we supposed to meet them at a certain spot there, near and we didn\u2019t meet\nthe 10 people. And it was tough and we had to, you know, we had to wander around,\nalmost for days and we couldn\u2019t find them.",
        "Q: Well, before we go on to that --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I\u2019m just trying to figure out, once you had all the arms in the barn --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- over those couple months, did you little by little say here, here\u2019s your rifle, here\u2019s your\ner -- how did -- how did --",
        "A: No, the group, it was all, yeah --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was all the -- yeah, it was all distributed to the group -- to the commander of the group.\nWe had a commander of the group, which -- he was Laser Israleet, his name and he was -\n- served in Polish army and he was a officer, matter of f -- matter of fact, the Polish army.\nAnd he somehow escaped, you know, wasn\u2019t taken prison. And so that\u2019s why we picked\nhim as -- as the commander, because he\u2019s a military man. He were much older and he\ntook his wife with him. He brought -- which we -- which was not allowed. We didn\u2019t\neven -- we didn\u2019t consider that, you know what I mean? We only knew -- that\u2019s where\nthe three women is involved, one 1s his wife. All right, so if he brought -- he brought his\nwife with him -- in the bunker, by the way. So he sticked out already, so sh -- yeah, but --\nbut the original plan was only, mostly men.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And, so when you left that night, when you packed to go, what were you\ncarrying?",
        "A: What --",
        "Q: The night that you escaped, what did you pack? Did you take anything?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Or did you just have your coat?",
        "A: We sat -- we sat in the -- in the bunker and we went through, we had -- yeah, we had\nwinter clothes there and we took certain amount, I mean we were prepared, you know,\nthey call -- the -- over here you toast the br-bread, for instance, to last f -- to last for few\ndays, it means when you -- we didn\u2019t toasted that -- what actually it was always stale\nbread, ha -- you know what I mean, har -- we took a little bread, a little to -- food to last\nfor a couple days, yeah. But he was later -- Commandeer Laser, he was smart, he\u2019s a\nmiltil -- you know, military man. He had prepared himself pretty good with his wife. But,\nI mean know what -- you know, I mean they knew. He even had the -- what you call it,\nthe military, where you carry that -- that can f -- for drinks.",
        "Q: A canteen?",
        "A: Canteen, yeah. A canteen. We didn\u2019t have a canteen, he had. Ah, so some -- so he\u2019! last -\n- so he\u2019ll last him a little bit more. So act -- we didn\u2019t have too much, ac -- we escape\nwith a little -- little. We did have clothes, was important. Had warm clothes, was\nwintertime, was very cold. And make sure you have good boots. And -- and a hat, a good\nhat. Different kind of clothes, it was -- 1t was no -- you know, you know -- everybody --\neverybody looks like Santa Claus or something here different.",
        "Q: Like Santa?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Wh -- Do you think your mother and your father suspected that you were getting ready to\nleave?",
        "A: Well, they -- we -- my father is another story. I didn\u2019t mention it there in the paper. With\nmy father is another story. Now, if you want to know it, my father, will have to tell you\nexactly what happened my father. You want that? Yeah. Now, in -- this was 19 --\nJanuary, 1943, October. October, 1942, we got the same -- an order fr-from the SS to the\nJudenrat to be ready, you\u2019re going to be taken to exp -- on transport. Now, be ready at\ncertain time, eight o\u2019clock in the morning. I -- I mention we didn\u2019t have the station near\nProushinna? It was 10 kilometer -- 10 kilometers away. And we knew that\u2019s the\nliquidation. Somehow, was rescinded. Either -- I don\u2019t know, the per -- Burgermeister\npaid off, it\u2019s rescinded. The Judenrat decided that night, when the order came -- I don\u2019t\nsay all the Judenrat, most of the Judenrat decided to commit suicide, see? And this\ndoctor, I s -- I imagine, the Jewish doctor, she belonged to the Judenrat and she supplied\npills for that -- you know, she had pills. We figured, you know -- and they went to a big\nhouse -- not all the Judenrat, maybe -- the Judenrat was 22, maybe about 10 or 12 decided\nto commit suicide. And -- and they were -- it wasn\u2019t successful. Yeah, I know it was, I\nremember that -- I remember that they took pills and then they put their lid -- the chimney\nand you know, they clo -- they made a fire -- firewood and they didn\u2019t open the chimney\nand they thought, you know, with carbon monoxide, somehow -- and only two died. Only\ntwo died. See, my father committed suicide. This -- this is the same night. See, he knew\nwhat was going on with the Judenrat, but he -- see, he hanged himself. So, at least we had\nthree, four months left. We buried them, yet you know, in the spot in the ba -- you know\nand we still have time to say Kaddish and yeah. That\u2019s what happened to my father.",
        "Q: Were you there?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Were you living at home when that happened?",
        "A: This was -- we still were in our ho --",
        "Q: In the house?",
        "A: -- we still yeah, this was -- next month we moved to our aunt. It happen about -- about\nmaybe two months when -- you -- you know, two -- you know, both, you know,\numwannus widows. The three widows, yeah. That happened. I didn\u2019t want to write this in\nthe paper, but this is -- this is the story. So, from -- so eanse we knew, he said all along,\nhe says he is not going to -- he 1s going to -- you know, he is going to -- not going to be\nleft -- go to the transports, you [inaudible]. Yeah, so he -- at least he had a little, I mean,\nif we had time to say -- in the same -- in the same house we stayed with my aunt, we had\nthe meeann you know and -- and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve been meaning to actually ask you the name of your aunt\u2019s husband who was killed\nby the Germans.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What -- what was his name?",
        "A: His name -- the last name, Maysha Shershefski. Maysha Shershefsk1.",
        "Q: And it was your mother\u2019s sister\u2019s --",
        "A: My mother\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they had four girls and in the range about -- about the same, this -- the older girl, you\nknow, probably was my -- maybe a little bit older than my brother and the same -- she\nprobably was already 23 or 24 and 20 and maybe 17 - 15 and a smaller one, four girls.\nAnd I had two sisters and two sis -- shane -- my two sister, yes, so they -- they all went to\nthe same transport the same day, probably. I don\u2019t know it. I think it was the third. You\nknow, they transported -- four days took that to transport the ta -- 12,000 Jews. They\nprobably didn\u2019t have the -- the -- you know, f -- wagons and you know. So it was 3000.\nThey divide it when it came, yeah -- this is January the third, 20\u2019s -- 28 - 29 -- the 30th.\nNo, it\u2019s 27 - 28 - 29 and 30th, so -- so it was divided the city on four sections and they\nsays east side, each day 3000 and now it was prepared, you know, you have to go to the\nstation, we don\u2019t have a station [indecipherable]10 miles. So farmers were already lined\nup for miles inside the ghetto and outside the ghetto. It came the order that you got to be,\neight o\u2019clock in the morning, to be ready, that\u2019s all is allowed to take a backpack, certain\namount. It says, each one take a backpack. So it means get your better, whatever, because\nyou didn\u2019t see the backpack anyway any more. So they prepare you to take the backpack,\nso you -- of course you put it in, most of your better belongings, or -- you know what I\nmean? And be ready and at farmer\u2019s market, and -- and y-you going to be sent to Salesia,\nlike amerasion to work. Nothing about -- about concentration camps, you\u2019re going to be\nand the women, all this baloney [inaudible]. So it took them four days. Some tried to\nescape, I found out later, you know, from the wagon, you know, go and it\u2019s wintertime,\nthe f -- it was way below zero. Can you imagine when you have to have family, two\nfamilies, 10 - 12 or 15 people in the sled with the belongings and it takes about couple\nhours and you know, it\u2019s freezing, you have a child -- you saw some women and\nchildren, you know, froze to death. Some of them tried to escape. So, it didn\u2019t -- 1f you\nmanage to escape from all the transport, some got shot on the spot, some managed to\nescape and they got them in touch with a certain friend, a Christian friend and they stayed\nthere for awhile and they were told you know, there is some Proushinna, go and this way\npartisans and they reached the partisans there -- if they reached, you know, and they\njoined, eventually, our group. When we were in the woods, there was a na -- you know --\nthere is -- we found another group. So, the second night, I say -- when we es -- finally we\nescaped, it took us all night to reach the forest. We didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t meet those guys\nthere that had -- and this was the worst experience of our life. We -- it was cold and\nhungry and -- and -- it\u2019s -- we were wondering around, maybe we\u2019re going to found\nthem, because they supposed to have already s -- maybe a place -- you know, they -- a\nbunker, you know, we all live in a bunker in the -- in the woods, camouflaged somehow,\nbut you can make a fire and all that. We did, you know, with matches, we did had --\nmade, at night we made a fire, emergency. We ha -- li -- you know, warmed up a little.\nBut it was -- 1t was rough for the older, some -- some couldn\u2019t take it, you know. It f --\nand so -- so we wandered around for about a week and we tried -- the group, our group,\nthe 18 and three women, to be independent. Which -- so we tried, we knew -- made a\nlittle bunker and we had plenty of --",
        "Q: You dug under?",
        "A: Well, the bunk -- you know what the bunker is? I-It 1s a -- we call, it\u2019s more -- about\nthree, four feet in the ground, yeah. With plenty -- you know, in the woods, you have\nplenty of trees and logs and all that. So you try to -- you brace and then you\u2019re -- we\nknew -- we have an idea how the bunker -- you know, how to build the bunker so you can\ns-sleep about 10 on each side. So -- and just high enough, six feet, so you can -- you\nknow, you can go in. And then you had the -- on both sides you had the -- what you call\nit? B-Bunk -- the -- the bunks where you can just lay around and sl -- you know, just lay\naround and sleep. And in -- in middle, eventually, in the middle of the bu -- middle of the\nbunker was a stove, made a stove. This was -- this was when we -- you know, we decided\nwe had to go to get some bricks. We had to go to the farms, get bricks and ge -- and --\nand build the stove, make that. Then we had to go -- go to g-get some -- for the food\nundertaking, you know, they call it in Russia bombioshka. To go to a farm, you got to\neat. After a week, you know, you -- we didn\u2019t find leave -- we were hungry, starved. So --",
        "Q: But what would you do -- how would you approach the farmers?",
        "A: Well, here, the first time approach the farmers, so we decided five men from the group. I\nparticipated and we decided we going to go -- we were armed, we were going to go to a\nfarm and get some bread and get some -- you know, if -- we\u2019re around, then we ne -- after\nall, that\u2019s the way they\u2019re -- they -- they -- Russians lived there so -- for so many month.\nThey knew already the territory, they were there -- have guns to the farmer. The --\nlessinder -- the farmer was caught in between, let\u2019s put it, caught watteeou in between. So\n-- so, on the way, the first -- the first undertaking, we met on the road, it was wintertime,\na Sled, a farmer had a calf and he had in his sled and he had some salt and he had some\nflour from the mill. So we took the sled and yeah, we soo -- the sled, whatever -- away\nfrom the farmer and we brought it down to the f -- to the -- he was riding just -- on the\ntrack, you know, between -- between the -- not far from the woods. We brought this in\nthe -- to our place, our home there and on the way going -- you\u2019re going -- going to our\nplace -- to the bunker, call it a home, we stopped another little farm, we got some bread,\nyou know, the way the Russian did. They baked a big loaf of bread. If you get t-two loafs\nof bread -- it was rationing, so it -- mean, at least you managed, you managed. You know,\none loaf of bread, you can -- you can make 20 or 25 portions. So you s -- you stayed on a\nportion. You know, we were -- we were fair. Each one got a portion of bread. These were\nthe first days. Then we discovered that farmers were coming in the woods, chopping --\nchopping -- you know, they came in and they were chopping wo -- woods, logs for\nthemselves and we are pretty close there, so we had to abandon [indecipherable]. We had\nto abandon the first time with -- we abandon that place, already. And, yeah, this was\nwhen we went the first time, we had to go to the farm, to the farmers to get the equipment\nin order to build. You ha -- we had to have like a -- a s -- a saws, we had to have shovels,\nwe have to have picks in order --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t take that with you?",
        "A: No, you -- no, we never [indecipherable] no, we didn\u2019t have this with us, no, we didn\u2019t\nhave this. We expected the 10 men, they going to have a place, a home for us. See, we\ndidn\u2019t meet them for -- took us a -- took us a long time. I think on the third week we met\nthem. So, the first -- so we got -- we got all the equipment to build -- to build this gym --\nwe call it gymlamka, it means in the -- in the ground. And it was camouflaged with brush\nand -- and a -- in order to protect -- you know, the rain shouldn\u2019t go in, we had plenty\nsand, fill up with sand. But even though the sand, you know, went through, you know, it\nwas -- it w -- in the beginning it -- 1t wasn\u2019t too bad, later on there was a problem. Later\non was a problem, well you bose -- you know, you got loaded with lice and fleas.",
        "Q: With lice and fleas?",
        "A: Oh, because from the sand and -- you know, later on. Even -- even -- even being, you\nknow, when we organized being in the partisan with the -- all together, the Russian\npartisan. But we got used to 1s already. That time, we already had -- we had -- we call it -\n- they had a -- a steam room outside, yeah. A steam room, you went outs -- I -- I don\u2019t\nknow, you went out of the steam room wintertime, almost naked, then you run in in order\nto get -- in order to get rid of them. It was a problem because, you know, the bunks you\nslept, each time -- you never undressed, you never took your shoes off. You only slept on\n-- you know, like -- like a -- it reminds me the concentration camps, you slept close to\neach other and -- and you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s bound to get from this -- from the -- from\nsomebody else or from the sand and somehow, get infested -- get infested. But we f -- we,\nfrom the experience idis we discovered, we learned, you know, we got rid of. We used to\nmake a fire.",
        "Q: What would you do?",
        "A: Yeah, you know, in order to get -- in the beginning we used to make a fire -- well, this\nwas already when we are organized. So he told us, m-make a fire and the smoke, make a\nbig smoke, take off your shirt and hold it over the fire and then alls -- you know, thens --\nthen they all -- they all commit -- all drop. This was only in the beginning. Later on, you\nknow, we were in 19 -- so this independent Jewish group, we lived for four months\nindependently. We learned our lessons, then we moved three times. Here, was in a car\nyou know, we saw farmers there. We went -- you know, like they di -- we were afraid we\ngoing to be discovered, so we decided we going to go in another place. Then we discover\nthere\u2019s another group in the woods, about 12 Jewi-Jewish groups and there was another\ngroup, eight, there\u2019s another 20. We were already -- so, ev -- being maybe around 50 -\n60, you got to have enough food, you know to -- so, we tried, the second time to go a\nbigger undertaking, they call it for -- f-food undertaking. And it was -- we went to a big\nfarm, not far from our town, you know this and we loaded up two loads, two -- 1-it was\nstill wintertime -- two sleds with lot of products, most -- you know bread, flour and the\noats, whatever they had there. Potatoes. Now, potatoes wasn\u2019t a problem with -- potatoes,\nthe farmers added -- all the farms, they s -- they had their supply potatoes outside. Supply\nfor the whole wint -- for the whole season and the same thing, but covered with straw and\nthen with sand, so you shouldn\u2019t freeze. Now, the same thing looks like a outside bunker,\nwe were -- you know, we were inside -- outside. So we used to go -- potatoes, we used to\ngo in and steal, was no prob -- we can always get potatoes enough. If you didn\u2019t have\nfood, well you got potatoes. And you had a fire, so baked po -- used to bake th -- baked\npotatoes. Or that -- I mean a -- as long so, you got -- you got a -- you got along, you did --\nwa-wasn\u2019t a hungry. And the only thing is we still -- we still don\u2019t -- where -- where is\nour voice? Where is our voice? So, we were wandering around, we met some partisans\nalready that time in the woods. And they were already as -- dressed nice and they -- you\nknow, driving -- during the day, right on the route. You know, in t -- near -- in the\nterritory around the woods, they weren\u2019t even afraid. Driving around with a sled and the\nhorses. And they met us and they says, \u201cWell,\u201d -- the same thing -- those who are armed,\nthey would take it. Those who don\u2019t -- hasn\u2019t got any arms, he says you got to have the --\nthey wouldn\u2019t nex -- they wouldn\u2019t take it in. They wouldn\u2019t -- they -- you know, they\nwouldn\u2019t accept them. So, they were friendly in the beginning. They helped us go, if --\nyou know, with our group and they participated and they helped us to go for a bigger\nundertaking, food undertaking. They knew already how to do it. See, we weren\u2019t\nexperience. And they helped us with food undertaking. So it wasn\u2019t so bad and\neventually, I think I -- on the third week, we found our group, see? And they were still,\nalready incorporated with some partisans, with some Russian partisans. But it still was\nindependent groups, each one living independently. But at least we had some -- so they --\nwhen we met the 10 groups, they were already more experienced, we took on some\nmilitary missions, couple. So, in order to get some more ammunition for the -- you know,\nwhere the -- you\u2019re about 60 there, some of them didn\u2019t -- came [inaudible] the 12 -- the\n12, they only have maybe a couple rifles. Now, our group, considering the way we were\narmed, it\u2019s unbelievable, having -- because I -- I -- y-y-y-y-y -- in -- come to think of -- I\nwas mention, in -- in Warsaw ghetto, it was so rough to -- you know, it was so rough to\nsmug -- to get arms in. They tried the -- the -- the -- the underground, Polish\nunderground. They supposed to help them and you know, with money to buy -- you\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know, you had to buy guns and ammunition. Many times, you know they\ntak -- they took the money and they didn\u2019t deliver it. You know, they didn\u2019t deliver it.\nWith so little, whatever they had -- with so little, you know, they stood out and they\ncouldn\u2019t and the Germans had to bomb them out, in order -- can you imag -- in Warsaw\nghetto, with so little. So comparison the little group, there was thou -- Warsaw ghetto\nwith half a million Jews, 400,000 Jews, so you figured, \u201cGee, we are blessed compar --\nunbelievable,\u201d we were blessed comparison. So -- so we managed -- you know, went to\nthe farmers, they saw we are Jews, but what can they do? They looked around, a Jew, I\nmean some were unfriendly farmers, but they -- we took whatever we needed that. So\nwhen we met up with the other 10, we already -- I mean we got -- build some senti --\nwhat do you call it, a bunkers, three -- three of -- 20 of -- we -- three bunkers 1n each side\nand they helped us, we went have bigger -- you know, on food a-assignment, we had\nalready help from the Russians -- partisans. They wo -- they -- they helped us. And many\ntimes we reciprocated, they says, okay, wi -- you'll have to go with us, they picked a few\nfr-from the -- our group, which -- you know, some not armed. Over -- he says, they ouv --\nthey going to protect us. They took us and they said we going to go on the track and you\ngoing to -- they gave us saws, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re going to cu-cut telephone poles and\ntelegraphs and stuff like that.\u201d The Russian says, \u201cOh, you do, we -- they lay an ambush,\u201d\nhe says, \u201cwe going to protect you, at\u201d -- everything at night. S --",
        "Q: Now, this now -- th -- y-you\u2019re talking now about a -- a mission now?",
        "A: Well, this is -- this is a mission, but I mean it -- okay, cut tele -- yeah, I mean -- two --\nyou know, the old, each one on two sides, you -- the holes, we didn\u2019t have the electric\nsaws. Had to saw the -- cut the telephone at night, saw it -- what\u2019s the -- through the --\ndisrupt the communication. They had to come back, you know, in the morning, you\nknow, and the ki -- th -- chi -- group from German would have to come back and replace\nthe poles. This was -- this was a battle for them. So this we did, before we even got\norganized with them, they made us [indecipherable]. I mean, it foo -- it wasn\u2019t so bad.\nAfter all, they helped us -- they helped us with food, but when we met up with the 10 -- f-\nfirst 10 already, we decided that we\u2019ll go for a little mi-mil -- missions. We\u2019ll go -- they\nknew and we went, for instance, three examples I put there. One time, we s -- we went to\na -- to the -- to the -- there was -- I mentioned there was a sawmill in -- near Proushinna\nand there was a German -- you know, the German -- we went to the sawmill, there was --\nthey had a sawmill and a flour mill there and it\u2019s -- and -- and it was a big -- big\noperation see -- badaway for Jewish engi -- contro -- Jewish -- on the -- two Jewish\npeople. So we went there and we disarmed -- we didn\u2019t kill the German. We went in the\nhouse, whatever we had, the guns, whatever we had, the gun. We took his gun, we took\nsome clothes and we loaded up our -- two -- what you ca-call it? The same sleds, wagons,\nwith how other products. There\u2019s a fa -- lot of products and we brought it in -- back to --\nyeah, so -- this the -- that time, it helped. It\u2019s a little mission.

        "Q: -- bad. After all, they helped us -- they helped us with food, but when we met up with the\n10 -- f-first 10 already, we decided that we\u2019ll go for a little mi-mil -- missions.

And -- but the main -- the\nmain -- the main mission was when we blew up -- this was with still Jewish group with\nother group. We -- we crept into the -- outside of the ghetto and we blew up the\nheadquarters, the Gestapo headquarter, yeah.",
        "Q: At this point the ghetto was empty, right?",
        "A: Empty. Empty. I mean we just crept in -- you know, it was at night, we went 1n there and\nyeah, we burned it up, we blew up -- burned up the headquarters. It was -- 1t wa -- it wa --\nit was a big house, where they operated from there. And -- and -- and on the way back --\non the way back there were -- yo-you know, and it was already late. We met -- there was\nthree German patrols there, patrolling there, you know, we ambushed the -- he wa --\nambushed them and took their rifles away, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you kill them?",
        "A: Yeah. The three -- yeah, we killed the three Germans. We had to. We take the rifles away\nand es-especially the -- especially the winter, you know, the clothes and the boots was\nimportant. Yeah, yeah, this is a Jewish group, the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you get the boots? You, yourself?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Did you get the boots?",
        "A: Oh ye -- oh -- well, I -- well, I -- I wore the boots. Each one -- each one -- it was 1f you --\neverybody was running, you know, later on, when it was organ -- everybody was running\nfor the [indecipherable]. You know, we used to -- mine, for instance -- this was in 19 -- 1-\nin 19 -- late 1941, I think, in June. They dropped -- now we were already -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nalmost five months as independent groups, with little Russians here and there groups, all\nkind of groups. Everybody was independent. And in s -- late May, they -- Russian planes\ndropped off military -- military what you call it? Men. And that\u2019s when the rule of the\njungle finished. Finally came an order, they -- you know, they realized there is some\npartisans and they wanted to get organized more. So, for us, Jewish partisans, it was the\nrule of the jungle, becau -- was ended. It -- they says, no more. You cannot just go around\nand live off of your farmers and survive. You got to fight for -- you know, you got to\nfight the enemy. So, all the groups in the woods, the surrounding whoever, they found.\nJews, Poles, Russian, White Russians. Was established the young ones belonged to a\nfighting group, the older ones -- you know we had some older escapees and couples,\nmarried the -- and -- and a family up front, you call it a boyavoyee and a family.\nBoyavoyee\u2019s a fighting -- fighting brigade and a family brigade. Now, the family, see the\n-- they didn\u2019t break it up. If you were husband and wife, it was in the family. Now, my\ncommander with his wife went in the co -- went in in the family group. Older people --\nyou know, anything is the fa -- and the family was -- now, they had their own place. We\nwere responsible for them. And all the young ones, single young ones who were able to\nfight in the fighting groups. So that time I was assigned to the 16 of the -- all the Jewish\npartisans, 16 were assigned to the Kirov group. They called it Kirov brigade and this was\na unit of the ien Ponnavarenko division. That\u2019s what it tells you, they\u2019re Ponnavarenko.\nThis is -- our brigade belonged to the Ponnavarenko. And I was assigned and my brother\nwas assigned to the Kirov brigade and the third battalion and third platoon somehow\nthere. And that\u2019s the way we were assigned and th-the life of the partisan changed. We\nwere already safer, because we lost, you know, we went one time from our group, we\nwent for a underta -- food undertaking. Now we undertook too much and we came,\nsuccessfully with two loaded wagons with food to our place, the bunker. And we st -- I\nwa -- I participated, my brother participated, that time was about 15 of us went. And the\nGermans followed. Eventually it was -- at night we were safe. And we were loading it, all\nthe food and you were -- kept the -- you know the food, mostly you ke -- you kept it\nhidden in certain -- all around the certain places, make sure that in case you get chased\nout or you have to -- or you have to abandon the place. You had to be careful not only\nabout y-ye -- for the Germans, sometimes from farmers or from even a -- you know, from\nthey\u2019 Il come in in the woods, or they had a lot of spies. You see, there was -- the\nGermans had a lot of spies. They knew there is some partisans. And they had a lot of\ncollaborators from the Russians. There was a whole division, they call it the Valosofts1.\nWe ca -- we called them Valosoftsi, General Valosoft -- Valosoft went, the first day of\nthe war is the -- two more -- they surrender to the Germans. Just -- and what happened,\nthey surrendered. And the Germans didn\u2019t use them on the-- to fight on the front, but they\nused the all divisions, you know -- you know is a evosovla -- all army maybe, I don\u2019t\nknow it -- maybe -- maybe two, three division. A division is 20,000 men. So the German\nused those Valososftsi\u2019s, they -- those are the Valosoftsi\u2019s, as collaborators. They put\nthem for alt -- you know, to do all the kind of dirty work in the -- in the garrisons, in --\nyou know, all kind -- in garrisons, or in the villages, in the cities and -- and they replaced\nthe Germans -- you know, they did the work for the Germans.",
        "Q: You were saying that sometimes you lost people and you started to tell a story after that.",
        "A: Oh, well, ye -- see, what happened? So, all of a sudden the Germans, you know, there\nwas a shot -- we had a shot. And those who were outside, we were outside, just ready and\nSO we saw the Germans. So we tried to grab you -- the rifle, anything you could, we start\nto escape deeper in the woods. And here, the Germans blew up the bun -- there was about\n-- about eight of -- eight -- they didn\u2019t participated, but they belonged to our group, eight\nguys. So they -- that\u2019s all they did is -- 1s they -- with grenade, they blew up the bunkers\nand they -- they killed the -- thega -- they killed them all and they got one girl, they took\na -- a injured girl a pri -- as a prisoner. The reason -- I don\u2019t know, they took the girl,\nprobably they tried to squeeze -- find -- maybe to find out more information. So we had\nthe -- that\u2019s -- we had one -- what you call it, tragedy. And, so we lost at that time, seven\n- eight men from our group. And seven men from the first group got killed before we got\norganized, by -- by another group of partisans, for -- the only reason they got -- were wot\n-- killed, because -- for their clothes, for their boots or something. Because it was the rule\nof the jungle, before.",
        "Q: So -- so people who were -- essentially believed in the same thing, they were partisans\nand they killed each other?",
        "A: It was not -- it was -- what I mean, this is the rule -- they -- they are in the woods the\nsame. They supposed to -- they supposed to fight and we all, but that\u2019s the way it was,\nthe rule of the jungle. I mean, they didn\u2019t -- if -- if -- if they figure maybe you have a\nwatch -- I don\u2019t know, we never -- we complained later on to -- you know, we were\norganized already in the -- you know, in the partisans. But it was too late, we says, well,\nnot much -- I mean, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a terrible loss. And the bar -- that commander and his\nbrother got killed. That -- what I say -- that Barro Sagell. The first one, yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stop. We\u2019ll stop now. They have to change tapes again.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: When your group went from being more independent to more organized, did you ever\nhave any military training?",
        "A: Well, I did a little. See, when you -- in the Russians class, when you reach 18 in Russia,\nthey -- they taught you how to clean a rifle and take apart a rifle. It\u2019s by the Russians. So,\nin last year, I knew out -- you know, the Russian rifle -- how to take apart and clean a\nrifle and all that. But, we never -- we never went on the range for experience that, yeah.",
        "Q: Hm. Had you ever shot a rifle?",
        "A: Did I have a --",
        "Q: Had you ever shot a rifle, a gun? Before --",
        "A: Oh, before -- before that?",
        "Q: I mean, when you were younger, had you --",
        "A: No. First of all, it was ill -- you know in pole -- in Poland was illegal. It\u2019s not like here. It\nwas illegal to have arm, any rifle, machine. Only the police or certain -- it was illegal, no\nguns. Most of -- most -- if you heard the -- what\u2019s -- 1f committed murders is just -- you\nknow -- no gun used.",
        "Q: What -- what --",
        "A: I was trained. I was trained, that\u2019s what I want to say. Now, I was young and I was -- you\nknow, I was strong. As a rule, most of the Russians are a -- a liltz -- some are -- I would\nsay Russian soldiers, majority is not like Germans -- big guys. Small -- smaller guys. And\nwe -- in the third where I was assigned, in the third battalion [indecipherable] brigade.\nWe had a anti-tank gun. This is the only gun the brigade possessed that time. Now, they\ncall that PT -- Russian is P-PTR. Now this -- this gun was used mostly -- we didn\u2019t\nexpect to get involved, you know, with fweet -- with the German tanks or Panzers, or yur\n-- in battle. It was used mostly on the railroad to s -- to s-shoot in their engine and stop\nthe engine all -- blow up the engine so the train can not. We were very limited in\nexplosive that time. You know, ba explosives. So we used the PT and only gun. The -- it\nweigh -- it weighed -- it weigh -- it was very heavy, it weighed maybe 150 pounds. But it\nwas -- you know, now there 1s -- the whole timer and it\u2019s two parts. It was -- y-y-you --\nyou could separate it in two parts, so I was assigned at number two and -- and there was\nnumber three -- three -- three pe -- thr-three guys used to be in charge of the PTR -- of\nthat -- of --",
        "Q: To carry it?",
        "A: Carry it and the number one, it was responsible by shooting it. Yes, so I was -- in the\nbeginning there, you know, the number two and fin -- I was trained then to be number\none, to use the gun on missions for the trains to -- to shoot ac-actually to -- mostly what\nyou can do is, many times it -- in engines -- make sure that either yo -- either you\ndestroyed the engine, you know, it wasn\u2019t -- 1t wasn\u2019t -- that time -- it\u2019s better -- I mean\nit\u2019s -- it -- it 1s -- it is the only ti -- the only gun we used on these certain missions. Now,\nlater on, it was in the late \u201842, in the be -- in the I-late -- no, \u201842, in beginning \u201843,\nRussian planes already used to drop off a lot of explosives. And til then, it -- we had to --\nbesides using that -- that -- that what you call, anti-tank gun, the partisans dependent on\nthe dynamite explosives to -- gathered from the outside. Now, how do you get it? Mostly\nfrom the outside. You know, the war was going on, you were finding shells here, you\nknow, artillery shells and it was very dangerous to -- you know, sometimes a lot of them\ngot killed in order to build a bomb -- to build the -- the -- what you call it? The -- yeah,\nthe --",
        "Q: The bomb.",
        "A: The ex -- the explosive, yeah. So, but it -- they -- we did -- you know, already at that\ntime, there were some specialists in from the Russians, which they tried somehow to get\nthe shell apart and to build the bomb by hand and use -- use the -- the -- the -- usually\nwhat I mentioned, the hand grenades -- the hand grenades was very, very important for\nthe purpose of the bomb, because it\u2019s all you had to do is pull the pin out and this can ex -\n- you know, this was used as a detonator for the bomb. But, later on -- like they -- they\nwere -- the Soviets planes used to come down at night and drop off a lot of materials,\nmostly the -- you know, for the purpose of -- I would say a lot of automatic rifles, but a\nlot of em -- those m -- dynamite supplies, bomb supplies.",
        "Q: Before you had the dynamite, just describe one mission. Would you go and set up the gun\nalongside a train track. How -- how would it work?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s very -- see, we used to -- we used to do -- this is now where I -- where I\nparticipate quite often with that. We used to reach a place, mostly at night and find a spot\nsuitable for us to retreat in case, you know -- you know, right in the jungle or something,\nin the swamp. Find a spot there. Now, and we used to mine the -- the -- the -- the tracks,\nyou know, [indecipherable] was -- was very -- you know -- they were in -- it was very\neasy, they weren\u2019t -- what you call it? Patrolled or -- and -- and watched so carefully.\nAnd you f -- you s -- now, you had a s -- there was so many -- there was so many\nbrigades already in the woods that time, that each brigade had their own territory. You\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know what I mean? You just couldn\u2019t go in anywhere near here. For\ninstance, we got a section, they gave us a territory where we had to operate, far away\nfrom our camp. Let\u2019s see -- and another group was close to our camps, you know, and\nthat\u2019s the way it was set up. So, we used to -- at -- at night, creep down, we had plenty of\ntime -- small groups, about. On this missions the mostly -- the most is four or five men.\nVery -- it\u2019s all -- you go -- first of all, you -- you couldn\u2019t find out exactly when the train\nis going to go, or something.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, and we were operating on the main -- m-m-ma-ma-main junction, which is\n[indecipherable] and means komoskwa -- the main junction where all the -- where all the\nt-trains were going, all the traffic. So, in the beginning, so you put the mine and you had\nto dig a little hole between the -- between the -- what do you call it? You have the\nrailroad, the -- the -- the -- what do you call it, the wood, or --",
        "Q: The tie?",
        "A: Blocks.",
        "Q: The railroad tie?",
        "A: Tie, yeah, betwee -- the -- the -- between the railroad ties, there. And many times and it\nwas a detonator sticking out. You know, they had a detonator sticking out. So the train\ngoes by and it touches the detonator and it blows up. But the Germans got smart,\neventually, you know what happens, so they were ripping the trains day and night and\nyou know, the war was going on. So they tried to put -- before -- you know th -- before\nthe engine, you know, before the engine goes, the -- first of all, the engine is going to --\nwhat happened -- the engine comes first -- the engine blows up first. So that\u2019s -- that\nstops the whole operation, engine. So they tried to put two flatbed cars full with sand or\nbricks or -- or all kind of -- th-tho -- heavy material. So this should rip -- you know, it-\nitll hit -- this\u2019Il hit first, so this\u2019Il ge-get blown up, it\u2019s not going to hit the engine. So\nthey -- they\u2019re going disconnect, so they going to follow that, then it\u2019s -- it means -- and\ncame to point, you know, this was very -- this was very easy because they couldn\u2019t\ncontrol all the railroad. They were in such a p -- they -- they were in such a trouble, that\nfinally they decided -- you know, they took farmers each from -- from the farms and put\nthem at night -- forced them on the tracks to watch the -- you know, to watch the tracks.\nMany times I used to come on the tracks and there was -- you know, civilians. They got\ncaught in the middle. I don\u2019t\u2019 know, you know, it\u2019s tough. They got -- its\u2019 a war, they got\ncaught in the middle.",
        "Q: Well, what would happen to the civilians?",
        "A: We told them -- well, w-we told them, \u201cYou better take off.\u201d\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened, the German ac -- you know what I mean? We weren\u2019t afraid, we told them,\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to mine, you better -- you better get out of here. You better take off.\u201d So\nthat\u2019s -- it means they\u2019re so desperate -- so -- so desperate to watch the traffic -- watch\nthe traffic. But the main, the -- finally the main -- you know, the Russian, they discovered\na trick that\u2019s -- in -- in order -- we were supplied with -- just like a bar of soap. That\u2019s all\nit had -- and had a little detonator there. And that\u2019s all you had to rip the tracks instead --\ninstead the trains. Just rip the [indecipherable] rip the tracks, you know, the tracks.",
        "Q: It would rip the tracks up?",
        "A: Just rip the tracks, take a fist, you know. And this is so easy, we -- we went out\nsometimes 40 - 50 at a time for miles, miles of the track. That\u2019s all you had to do 1s -- as\nleedbat -- you know, it was something like a -- it\u2019s not a rope, but it hads -- had -- it\u2019s not\na wire, too.",
        "Q: Leads?",
        "A: No, the --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- the -- the fuse was -- the fuse was inside a little bar of soap.",
        "Q: [indecipherable], okay.",
        "A: But you -- that\u2019s all you needed is a match and five or 10 minutes, til itll -- it\u201911 burn til\nit\u2019ll reach the -- til 1t\u2019Il reach the tracks, so you true retreat. So, we were laying right\nbetween it and it -- it fits right between the -- the railroad track, the railroad s-siding\nthere, yeah. And this was -- th-th-th -- this was -- it was the -- blowing the tracks, day and\nnight -- day and night. So this was minor tra -- this was already minor -- mi -- minor\noperation. It -- now, the big oper -- the bigger operation it came to point when the so -- in\n-- this was already 1944, we told -- you know, we told our commanders that in\nProushinna, there were the Leaman brother -- that Leaman for the communication and the\n-- and the telephone lines, and he was the one -- he was a murderer, I guess. That\u2019s him --\nnobody wanted to work or -- for him. So we told -- we told the commander, you know,\nwhy can\u2019t we go on this -- on the Proushinna - Voushanna line there and -- and -- and\nmine the road and we\u2019|l got -- you know, he was in charge of -- he was always in charge.\nMine the road and we were in the forest that time on both sides, maybe -- maybe 60 or\n70 men lay in ambush. So what we did is we cut the lines. We knew they left to come in\nin the morning, during the night. We mined the roads, because -- in case there was not\ntoo much traffic, only military. So -- and we mined the roads just -- in -- in the -- you\nknow, in the morning. We knew that they going to s -- the minute, what you call it,\nsunlight, they going to ar-arrive and would -- you know, lay there in ambush on both\nsides and you know, two trucks, you know, with the Germans, each one -- 30 on each\ntruck. Now, the first truck, the first one hit the mine and blew up. We knew -- the second\none stopped. We knew that the second one is going to stop and we\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll -- we -- we\nlaid on both side and this was a spot we picked -- it just -- you know, has got to go\nthrough the woods, through this -- you know, through the -- on both sides we are\nprotected. Either we\u2019re going to cut off -- we can go to the right, we can run to the left --\nwe are in the woods. And -- and sure, the second one stopped and we opened a fire from -\n- you know, it was from both side across. We killed them all, 30. Everybody was running\nfor the booty -- you know, booty.",
        "Q: For the booty, mm-hm.",
        "A: To get. To get -- you know, for -- arm we didn\u2019t need already maybe, the only thing was\nimportant, pistol. I mean we\u2019d -- we a -- you know, not everybody had a pistol. So, in\norder to have the pistol, a guard -- or sometime -- this was already, you know, important\ntouch from both sides, you know, you were respected. You had a pistol, you must have --\nyou know, already -- you were already a respected partisan. You must have -- if you\npicked -- killed -- got a pistol, it\u2019s yours. And no -- no, you can -- cannot take it away\nfrom you. If I took the pistol, it\u2019s mine.",
        "Q: Did you get one?",
        "A: Yeah, I got a pist -- beside -- besides that, of course they had -- we took especially, the cl\n-- the clothes what they had and all that. So, this was one of the -- one of the main -- it\u2019s\nnot the main mission, we -- where I participated and my brother participated. Later, after\nthat, it happened that, you know, my brother somehow -- with a post, so he fell asleep, so\nthey s-separated them, they dropped -- there was another group, they dropped down 50 -\nsome paratroopers and they needed local partisans, so all the three who were in the post\nfor a punishment, he says they needed -- they send them in to the -- to the o -- to the\nothers -- to the other group. And --",
        "Q: So, they sent your brother away from you [indecipherable]",
        "A: The -- ma -- my brother and the other two on the post as a punishment, because a\npunishment could be -- you know, this is -- could be -- you can be shot when you fell\nasleep on the post. So they -- I was separated and I didn\u2019t hear from him for the -- all that\ntime. I didn\u2019t hear -- I knew he is with the Capute -- eventually they joined they ca -- they\ncall it the Capusta brigade. I knew there, but we didn\u2019t see each other and we didn\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t ca -- didn\u2019t communicate each other -- with each other. And only once -- I heard\nonce -- once that he\u2019s -- you know, that he\u2019s operating, he\u2019s alive, so forth, yeah.",
        "Q: Could you just tell us a little bit more about when you weren\u2019t doing -- when you weren\u2019t\nengaged in missions, wh-wh-wh-what would it be like back at the -- at the camp? What\nwould you do in the evening and what -- a lot of times you were working at night.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: W-Would it be during the day? What would you do?",
        "A: Oh, well. Well, well, here it is. A lot of -- a lot of partisans were assigned at the camp.\nNow, at the camp, mostly those who were assigned at the camp -- pardon me -- their\nresponsibility was to go and -- on the food undertaking for themselves and for the family\ne -- for the family br-brigade, because there was all -- a lot in the families, yeah.\nHundreds, you know, I mean -- you know, not only Jewish already, you know, from some\n-- you know, from Rofe and Belagooshins ala -- there\u2019s a -- this -- it was -- it was -- big\ncamps, family camps. And so those who didn\u2019t participated, so they had to do local work,\nchop wood and stay on posts. The posts, that\u2019s boring, you know, stay on -- you know,\nthere\u2019s a -- posts, there\u2019s a lot of -- y-y-you were s -- you were -- spread it for mi-miles\naway, you know. A post here, maybe 10 miles another one, two, three on this track, on\nthe onther track. And the purpose of the post -- then you had -- they call it like a secret --\nyou had the secret parole they call that the secret code. You know, if you meet somebody,\nhey, even the partisans, it\u2019s -- you know it was every -- you know, it was concentrated\nwith a command from the different ach -- from the different brigade. He had -- he knew\nthe code, because if they were true and they didn\u2019t say the story, I say, \u201cStop, I\u2019m going\nto shoot. Who are you? Give me the code.\u201d If he didn\u2019t have the code, he\u2019s a -- he\u2019s a\nspy, he\u2019s a traitor, he\u2019s going to get killed.",
        "Q: What was the code?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: What was the code?",
        "A: Oh, they\u2019Il say a code, for instance -- any type of code, one f -- I give you example, 15 -\n10 or of Vashilare beach or -- or Josie. You know, they picked any kind -- any kind of\ncodes. Like in the military, you know, yeah. So it was -- you know, it was central\ncommand, very -- you know, with the discipline -- with the discipline. So they -- those\nwho didn\u2019t participated were doing work around there, mostly on poles. And so they ju --\nwere just sitting, doing sometime -- they si-sitting, doing nothing too, you know. And\nthat time, food were plenty. Three times a day, meals. Now, the meal consisted -- you\nknow, not fussy. Now, what we had -- it came to point that we went -- we had to a -- to a\nfarm. Now, our -- our duty was to go to farms to -- far away, like I say, each one was\nassigned a territory. We couldn\u2019t go to the poor farmers. We had to go to the rich\nfarmers, because the ch -- we knew that the Germans gave them a quarter that they on --\nthey can only have -- raise a pig or two pigs and the rest of them, they have to give it or\nsell it. There has to be for the German army that stand. So, and the same thing with cows\nand with butter, whatever they liked, you know, they call it -- cheeses and butter. The\nGermans requested from the rich -- from the rich farmers that they s -- I don\u2019t know if\nthey paid them something for it, it belongs to them, you know. And we had to go to those\nspecial farms to take away the German food, specially. Go far away and attack wi -- you\nknow, sometimes, if we had a -- the assignment, undertaking, were in the hundred -- you\nknow, sometime 100 - 200. Now they couldn\u2019t -- at night they were afraid, we controlled\nalready that time the -- the woods. Even sometimes joonk -- the -- what happens, if you\nwent for a mission and let\u2019s say it\u2019s late at night already, you couldn\u2019t reach your\ndestination to youk -- to your -- back to your -- to your -- ah, what\u2019s with -- to your\nbunker or your house. So, summertime, we had a -- summertime we had a privilege, you\nknow, we used to go in and hide -- small groups. I\u2019m talking about this -- a g -- smaller\ngroups going on mission to mine the roads or mine the bridges on -- or rip up the tracks.\nSo, we used to stop and go in in the field, you know, on the road, going in the field,\nsneaking in the corn field, in the -- in those field and st -- and stay up all day there. It was\nhot -- oh, 1t was ho -- you know, the sun in the hot day and -- and sometimes -- oh, we\nhad -- you know, we carried -- we had some water, we had some supplies. It was so -- it -\n- it -- 1t was a system -- it was a sys -- many times if you didn\u2019t reach, many times we\nforced in and I went in to a village -- not, I mean a single -- not 1n a be -- not in a col --\nyeah, in a hamlet for is -- lot of farmers, like -- they call it a hoota -- a fa -- a big farmer\nhad lu -- has got his house by himself someplace set up in his -- in his fields there. And\nSO We -- we went in there and we kept him there and we didn\u2019t let nobody out. Anybody\ncame in, we had -- they stayed there til night reached. We impounded them and we left --\nnight reached, we went out, yeah, yeah. I -- I discovered -- you know, I discovered there\nwas two advantages about -- first of all, it -- about going on the missions, you know. You\nhave two advantages. First of all, the food always the same is, on the camp. Three meals\na day and soup and meat. Now the -- the staff, at a different kitchen, see that, and they\nhave a different -- different -- and they had that -- that cook, a different cook. They had\nalready -- we had cows. It came to a point we had cows, we had horses already. Many\nhere -- I mean there was cows, let\u2019s see, sometimes 10 - 15 - 20 cows and the cows were\nmilked and from the milk, this is for the staff. Now, when we went out, you know, you\nwent into a farm, then you got -- first of all you got cleaned up and you had a changed\n[indecipherable] you know, while you -- the night you got to go in the pound and to go in\nand get washed and -- and take a dive, went in to the farmer and got some -- you know,\nund -- you -- cotton. Usually the farmers, they made their own -- they made their own\nclothes. Yeah, to change. And it -- it -- I\u2019m -- 1-1-1t -- and one advantage and the second\nadvant -- and the second advantage, you -- you -- you had -- you can -- had a little milk.\nYou can -- you can have sometime only -- if you want a little booze, they used to make\ntheir own -- you know the [indecipherable] -- they used to have -- make their own, the\nfarmers -- little booze. Well, I didn\u2019t -- once in awhile. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a different -- you\nknow, when you go out, it\u2019s -- it sounds, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s March. It\u2019s -- it was safer in the\nsmaller groups than the bigger groups. Because we didn\u2019t try to get involved the small\ngroup in the fight for the Germans. You know, we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know we na -- we\ndidn\u2019t -- going to win the war fighting with the -- we just -- our -- our mission was to just\n-- to do as much damage -- disrupt the lines, cut the lines, mine the roads and mine the\nbridges and ge -- and give them as much trouble as -- as you know -- as much as we\ncould, that\u2019s all. We didn\u2019t expect -- you know, the partisans, but we had -- you know, we\nhad -- I-later on -- when it already this -- with the Soviets, when they dropped down -- the\nplanes landed, you know, they already took certain injured partisans, they took them.\nThey landed at night. You know, there was certain spots. Nobody controlled -- you know,\nti -- ti -- a lot of territory. Even sometime during the day, they -- then they -- they were --\nthey were -- I mean they didn\u2019t have the guts to go in in the woods.",
        "Q: Were there women fighters that you worked -- that you fought alongside?",
        "A: Yeah, we had women, yes.",
        "Q: Tell [indecipherable].",
        "A: We had women. We had -- like I said, there weren\u2019t too many Jewish women, we had\nwomen, a few Jewish women participated in the -- in the -- 1n -- in -- in certain missions.\nBut there was a lot a girls from the C-Christians, from the -- mostly the White Russians.\nF-From the villages, you know, there were certain -- certain villages, those were situated\nnear -- near the -- the territory -- near the woods we have -- we operated. Now, see the\nGermans, what they did is they put garrisons in there. They knew the partisans are\ncontrolling the territory, so they put garrisons around those villages and I-lot f-from those\nvillages, they cooperated. They were sympathize with us, because some of their -- some\nof their boys already were in partis -- in partisans with us, with other groups. And so we\nhad -- we had g-good connections many times. For instance, when we went for a mission\n-- for big mission for food undertaking. You know, we found out before we went into\nvillage to find out if there is any Germans around. Is there garrisons around, because you\nknow, you -- to make sure that -- that there is -- there 1s non -- there is -- we should be\nsafe. But most of the garrisons, like I mentioned before, they were controlled by those --\nby those Valosoftis. There was a lot of Ukrainians there, who are the la -- this -- here the\nGermans, the collaborators, they put them in there. Of course with the German control,\nthere was some Germans with them. But the majority, the lot of -- they gave us a lot of\ntrouble, see? They send a lot of spies in the woods. They -- you know, they send the\nGermans, a -- a lot of spies in the woods and sometimes it was -- they -- they gave you\nout. They -- sometimes they -- but we had good connections, we had good connections\nand the last -- like I say -- when we got supplied from the -- we got supplied from the\nplanes and so we didn\u2019t have to go look any more for this -- make up our own minds and\nall that -- that -- everything was ready made and it was -- it was easy and -- and it was\nenjoyed.",
        "Q: It was?",

        "Q: You became a soldier?",
        "A: Yeah... Now, we had some problems though, 1n -- in the -- in -- in -- this was in 1944,\nyou know, we went -- besides, when they put those garrisons, those -- those Valosoftsis\nin there, we got an order to get them out. A mission, you know, a mission, you know, and\nthis is 200 here and two -- you know, and 200 there, 300 there. Sometimes we went for a\nmission where a few brigades took part. I would say 1000 - 1500, because if they had a\npower 600, you know, we had to double that. And we had to go and to a track and to\ndestroy the garrison.

For the history.",
        "Q: Can you tell --",
        "A: Th-That was -- that a Jewish fighter is -- you know, because I -- I always thought about\nthose -- you know, I didn\u2019t know where -- where -- where my family was taken and --\nand til -- til you know, I was liberated 1944 and my feeling was that I\u2019m doing something\nbeside as a fighter, I\u2019m doing a duty for the -- you know, something for the -- for the\nJewish people... That -- and that -- I was able to do something... Now I -- I came back\nafter the war to my -- I was liberated 1944, in -- in June. Now, they send me -- you know,\nI was a decorated partisan, so most of the partisans were taken on the front. The war was\nstill going on. As a matter of fact, in June, when they -- the second front started,\nsometimes the allied started in -- I think the same time maybe the second front started,\nnow. So I came -- they sent me and another group of -- of -- from the partisans, see and --\nto Proushinna to establish my town -- to establish order. You know, I\u2019m a decorated\npartisan -- a Jewish partisan. I came to Proushinna and I came to my house. And in my --\nand the house was -- that wasn\u2019t destroyed and I found in the house was a family of --\nyou know, I don\u2019t think -- I think it\u2019s a Ballousha family. Have a few children and you\nknow, she was surprised, you know, they were surprised to seeing, you know. I didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t even ask her how do you wind up in the house. My duty that time was to establish\nyou know, like -- like the front is moving, you know. It\u2019s interesting the way -- the way I\nwas liberated, you know. This 1s very interesting. We knew already that the -- that the\nRussians are coming now. And the patrol house already met with the Russian patrol. And\nwe were told that time that we have all the brigades what existed in the woods, that we\nhave to mine all the roads and all the bridges and let the Ger-Germans -- you know, to sla\n-- the retreat -- they shouldn\u2019t be li-living. You know, they were in a panic. I -- you\nknow, that\u2019s disati-disatisfaction they were k -- you know, they were -- they were running\nback. They were -- the Russian were chasing him and -- and -- and bombarding them and\nthey were running away so we tried our -- our mission was to mine the roads, not to let\nthem through. Let them go into the side, in the woods and to the -- all the other -- to all\nother ways. And we were in the woods and -- and we were -- you know, we -- we were\ncatching them by the -- by the hundreds. In the beginning we were sniping and we was\nkilling them. I mean sniping in the wood. It came to a point, you know, there was -- we\ncaught -- you know, we were complete army. You know, we were ca -- the partisans\nactually -- if we had an order, we could have gone in and liberate my -- liberated the --\nth-the city of Proushinna. The partisan were strong enough to go and liberate it -- this\nwhole city, all the cities around. You know, so they gave us the mission that -- that before\nI will -- came to Prou -- this was before, that we had -- had to participate and stop the\nenemy of -- you know, do as much damage as you can of retreating them. And that time\ncame an order, you know, we c-caught so many prisoners, we still were in the woods. We\nalready liberated, we are in the -- still in the woods, but we had to stake you know, and\njoin -- that\u2019s for our mission is to help the Russian army to disarm and to da -- day -- you\nknow, and to -- to -- there -- it was a disarray. I mean the -- the -- 1-it -- it\u2019s wortdill -- it\u2019s\nwort -- wild to me to live through a period seeing the way they marched in with such a\npower, d -- you know, great big -- big, you know, army was going to conquer the world,\nseeing them in retreat, you know, dirty, you know. They tried to -- to -- you know,\nchange their clothes in civilian clothes, they shouldn\u2019t -- you know, they shouldn\u2019t be\nrecognize as Germans. You know, it unbelievable in the retreat. So they tho --you\u2019re\nasking me th -- to me it\u2019s the -- that I lived through to see the biggest satisfaction with my\neyes. The retreat and the -- and the defeat. The defeat and disarray -- the ray -- the way a\n-- on that front -- on -- on the Russian front, the army. And the damage we did to them,\nyeah. We were laying -- we were assigned one time, of two -- on one bri -- there was a\nbridge, a very important bridge. Now we partisan, we had to control this bridge. We\nmined the road. Now, the German had to fix this bridge and now -- each time -- we were\nlaying from both side in ambushes. Each time they tried to fix -- they were in retreat, you\nknow, not the -- disorganized already, you know that? And they tried to fix the bridge,\neach time we opened fire. They didn\u2019t know if this is partisan or the Russian army. I\nthought I will fi -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sure that they -- they thought already, if the partisan they\nprobably would take a chance you know, and -- and -- and -- and f -- probably -- clean us\n-- go in a battle with us and get a -- you know, fight with us. But I -- I\u2019m sure they\nthought that was the Russian army at. And they never -- they were unsuccessful. They\ncouldn\u2019t -- they could -- never could build a bridge. That\u2019s why they had to go around.\nWe don\u2019t let them through the bridge, let\u2019s go around. So, then I was sent -- that\u2019s was\nalready -- we already free people -- already we -- the Russian army free. So, like I say,\nsome of them -- most of them were sent on the front. A lot of the farmers were sent back\nwith the children -- families. The families sent all back home and I was with -- I was --\nfrom the -- and that three of -- three more from the Proushinna Jewish partisans, sent to\nProushinna to establish the order -- establish order. So my job, so I did my job, which\nsatisfaction, I can say that.",

I was, you\nknow, assigned, working with the -- with the -- we call that the internal police -- with the\nRussian internal police. And they know, they -- you know, they knew -- you know, \u2019'm\nJew -- a Jew -- I probably know -- I was in the ghetto, probably if I know who was a\npoliceman, who was this -- who was -- who was a collaborator.

        "Q: Can you tell us a story?

        "A: Well, this -- there is -- well, there were a lot. There were a lo -- there were quite a few,\nthere was a lot. I mean, f-f-for -- like, for instance a policeman, he was a Polish\npoliceman and -- was cabbage -- was cabbage -- you know he was my -- probably was\nmy age. You know, th-that time -- you know, the ger -- the Germans, they didn\u2019t\nappointed those people. They were -- they were -- they were -- I mean volunteering. You\nknow, there\u2019s not such a thing volunteering. Not everybody wanted to be a -- a cop or not\neverybody wanted to be policeman, not everybody wanted to participate and go and kill\nand -- an-and -- an-and -- an-and_ do all kind of criminal -- commit all kind of atrocities\nlike that. But some figured, well, in the beginning, in \u201840, figured the Germans going to\nwin the war. They never realized, you know, everybody was -- you know, everybody was\nimpression. See, my father was a pessimist, he says, [indecipherable].

And I was shocked\nto s -- you know, how did you? So, what happened, she -- and she was probably -- I mean\nin the 50\u2019s, you know -- not the -- not the -- maybe -- maybe 60. And she escaped from\nthat wagons and she followed 10 kilometers and she came to Proushinna to the nun. The\nnun gave her the -- the -- you know, she got the clothes and she put a c-cross on her. But\nthe -- the -- the -- she told -- she told me -- this is after the liberation, now, she told me\nthat sh -- now the -- the -- in charge of that convent, they call it a -- the -- what you call it\na maynon orsed something.",
        "Q: Mother Superior?",
        "A: The mother -- the Mother Superior, of course, wasn\u2019t satisfied, she says better take her\nand go away with her, deep in Poland, where nobody knows. She was afraid that -- you\nknow, sometimes -- you -- you know, you -- sometimes maybe -- maybe somebody\u2019\ndiscover. You can\u2019t blame her, you know, they discover. So she took -- you know, when\nshe came in and the next day, you know, with the blessing with the Mother Superior, the\nblessing, she went the -- she actually comes from the different town. She comes some --\nthe towns near Lodz. And she -- they traveled somehow with her -- with the doctor. And\nshe spent all those years as a nun -- I mean as a doctor and n-not a doctor and she\u2019s wo --\nyou know, s-she was giving -- helping peop -- I mean, she\u2019s a doctor, they were so -- oh,\nthey were surprised. So when sh -- she came back, in Proushinna with this nun,\n[indecipherable] the nun, of course I will help. So, I tried -- I cou -- was able to do a lot\nof things here in Proushinna. Oh, anything you know, I tried to help the nun with -- with\nconvent -- even the whole convent to supply, make sure they have enough food. It was\nstill -- you know, the wa -- still with the Russians. It\u2019s still -- the war was still -- 1944,\nstill the war was going on and all that. And yeah, she -- she\u2019s on the list [indecipherable]\nRosa, she\u2019s on -- you know, she\u2019s on the li -- she is on the list, I saw her in the museum\non the -- from the Righteous Gentiles, yeah, yeah. The funny part is this, that this doctor -\n- now, when I left Proushinna, my town, eventually I had to get out. My brother was in\nBialystok and I was in Proushinna. And Bialystok was a temporary capital of Poland.\nThey didn\u2019t take Warsaw yet. So, my brother was smarter, he wanted to get to the United\nStates, so he didn\u2019t want to -- he knew he\u2019|I -- that as long he can -- he was nearer there,\nthat he g-got out to Bialystok. So finally I discovered that he is in Bialystok. Now, for me\nit was a tough job getting out from Proushinna, because of my position. I told my\ncommander -- you know, the commander from the -- from the -- from the brigade was in\nProushinna too, he was there. So, I told him, you know, I have only brother and he\u2019s al --\nleft of family and he is in Bialystok and this is already Poland. Proushinna is White\nRussia. And so he said, \u201cOh yeah, you got a brother left? I\u2019m going to se -- we going to\nbring him, send a plane, we\u2019ll bring him -- bring him here,\u201d he says[indecipherable]. So\nthat\u2019s up to him, now. This was already a -- I was in Proushinna already about four, five\nmonths. This was close to -- the war was still going on, Russia wasn\u2019t taken yet. So,\nfinally, he would release me, my commander. But he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me, I have to go\nup to the -- you know, to higher -- to the region commander.\u201d Now, I went down to the\nregion commander and he send with a letter -- and the region -- you know, the reason I\ngave you know, the only -- family I lost -- have the only brother. So the region\ncommander says that well, that\u2019s good, yeah, t-take fr-fr -- it\u2019s a good -- I didn\u2019t know\nthey sent me with a secret letter back in Proushinna, but then I discovered that it -- he --\nhe mentioned that it\u2019s a -- for me, if I want to take, you know, go on the front and kill\nsvor -- kill as many more -- you know, take revenge for my family, as many to -- he is a\ngood c-candidate to go on the front. I\u2019m a good candidate to go on the front, you\nunderstand? It means because, well they figured the c -- well, I want to get out, you\nknow, it was you couldn\u2019t get out that time yet. 1944, you -- 19. Then they passed a law\nin 194- -- late 19 -- after the war, you know the p -- the law was passed that all those\ncitizens, Polish citizens from before the war, Proushinna, I was -- was Polish citizens,\nbecause mostly partisans, lot of them -- lot of survivors from the Auschwitz, you know,\nthey came back to Proushinna. And eventually was -- you know, you could apply, it was\nlegal. You could have -- you could have gone to Poland. But it -- I had a tough time\ngetting out.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: I just want to go back a little bit, to Proushinna.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: When you first returned and you\u2019re staying back at your house, did you th -- were people\ncoming back? Were Jews beginning to come back?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And did you think perhaps family members might come back?",
        "A: When I -- this was in -- I was liberated in June, 1944. In Proushinna, only the few\npartisans who -- who were assigned to go to Proushinna and there I mentioned the\ndoctors unusual case. And no, there was -- I left -- I left Proushinna in late \u201844. It means I\ndidn\u2019t leave Proushinna. I had to take off abba partisan. I knew the territory. In order to --\nyou know it came to a point that I wanted to go to Bialystok and be with my brother. And\nwhile in Proushinna, after the liberation, 1944, I wrote a letter to my uncle, which\nprobably you read, yeah? I had a chance -- it took a long, long -- I knew that -- that my\nbrother\u2019s in Bialystok already, so I knew that he survived. So it took a long -- some -- a\nlong, long time. I think they got it in -- sometimes in 1945 in May, almost from the war --\nalmost fr -- the war was over kind of late, took very long. And I left Proushinna in s --\nclose -- June, July, Aug -- maybe around September, and -- in order to get into Bialystok.\nSo in -- I had to take -- I knew the territory, so I had to take the doctor and the nun with\nme and we -- you know, we crossed the water. It was between -- Bialystok was already\nPoland, not far f -- what I [indecipherable] over the border. So at night, somehow we\nsmuggled through and with the -- with -- I was -- I -- I still was in charge, I could -- I\u2019d\nbeen assigned, I can assign a farmer -- you know, to -- for -- for the job. I says, \u201cWe need\nyou to go in here and there.\u201d So we assigned a farmer and the doctor and the nun and I\nleft Proushinna and we were -- and we came to Bialystok. This was -- this was\nsmuggling, I mean -- yeah. This was illegal. It\u2019s taking a chance for -- for that other --\nother way. It was deserting.",
        "Q: You -- technically you were deserting?",
        "A: Well, I -- I was -- I was still assigned. They wouldn\u2019t let me -- they wouldn\u2019t let me go. I\nwas still assigned there, the job. So, it means, you know, yeah.",
        "Q: How did you feel about that?",

        "Q: About that? That you left?",
        "A: Well, I f -- I was determined, you know, I was determined that -- that I want to -- you\nknow, I want to go west, you know. I was determined -- feel about it. You know, it\u2019s\nokay, I was a fighter, but I didn\u2019t believe -- I wasn\u2019t Communist. I didn\u2019t -- I knew that\u2019s\n-- that\u2019s -- I -- I -- | appreciate and acknowledge the help the Russians did to us. But I\nwanted -- you know, I didn\u2019t want to stay. I didn\u2019t know that it -- you know, that\neventually Ill be free and I\u2019Il be able to legally leave Proushinna, like some other ones.\nNow, I came in Bialystok, late \u201c44. Now, Warsaw was still -- [indecipherable] wasn\u2019t\ntaken yet, because there was a big, big battle [indecipherable] Warsaw, you know. I\nremember there was the Polish army which was associated with the Russian army. There\nwas two Polish armies. One Polish army was established in Russia, which the Russian\ntook prisoners, most of the Polish army. This was -- you know, when the pact -- unknown\npact, Hitler and -- and Stalin made the pact and when the Germans in 1939 pushed the --\nno -- attacked, most of the army retreated east, towards the Russian border. And\neventually got trapped in Russia and took in prisoners.",
        "Q: You -- a -- a minute ago you mentioned that -- that you were -- that you had gratitude\ntowards the Russians for what they\u2019d done. Can you just talk a little bit about how the\nRussians treated you? Did they treat you any differently because you were Jewish? Did\nyou ever experience [indecipherable]",
        "A: Th-There -- well, there was a little, not -- the -- t-to say, really the Russians, they -- the\nwesterners in there. There were -- there were not so anti-Semitic than the eastern.

And, very little -- there was the --\nthere was more, I would say, there was even in -- even in the -- in the partisans, you\nknow, you felt like they call you some names. You know, the same.",

        "A: Oh yeah, they were f -- they were fair to me, because -- because they -- they appreciate\nmy work. Put it this way, not because -- I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m -- was a Jew, because they\nappreciated the -- the work I was doing and -- and I was devoted to doing the job. That\u2019s\nthe pri -- that\u2019s the appreciation, I think they had.",
        "Q: At this point, di -- what did you know, or what -- what did you know about your f -- your\nfamily, besides your brother?",
        "A: Well, here -- I came in Bialystok and Is -- I wind up -- so we stayed in Bialystok for\nabout maybe three or four months. And in Bialystok I met a girl, the first girl which was\nliberated from Auschwitz. This was in the beginning, 19 -- I think in the beginning --\nbeginning 1945. So, Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army, I think it was in --\nsometimes in \u201845 in January. Now, she came to Bialystok. She was a young girl and I met\nher there and she\u2019s the one told me that Proushinna was taken to Auschwitz. Otherwise I\nwouldn\u2019t e -- I wouldn\u2019t even know that they took -- you know, she told me, she just --\nshe was survivor from Auschwitz. S-So I told her, you know, don\u2019t go to Proushinna, I\u2019m\njust coming back from Proushinna. I can tell you who is there. She thought maybe you\nknow, maybe some survivor, something, you -- you know. So, some -- a few though -- I\nthink went back -- when they were liberated in 19 -- beginning 1945. I was in\nProushinna, but I know a few came to Proushinna. And some -- there 1s a -- there is still\nin Proushinna I would say, a community. I would say maybe a self -- some came back s --\nfrom Auschwitz and maybe they settled there. Some came back from the front. You\nknow, a lot of Proushinna maybe was in the Russian army, you know. So there is maybe\n50 Jews there, in the whole city.",
        "Q: So when you left and you were on your way to Bialystok, when you left your house, did -\n- did -- did you take anything from the house? Something small?",
        "A: Nothing. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t -- I d -- no, didn\u2019t interest me, nothing. No, I didn\u2019t -- it -- the\nhouse. If I wanted, I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t interested that. I could have taken -- I have a -- I\nhad a possibility of taking a -- a -- if greedy, taking a lot of things, because, you know, I -\n- | was -- you n -- | -- | -- I -- I had the power -- I had the power to -- to assign and take\nand do and anything. I just helped the doctor and helped the nun what I can and then, as a\nmatter of fact, she [indecipherable] adopted me.",
        "Q: What do you mean by that?",
        "A: We a manats -- I mean that -- I mean she -- she was like a mother to me... Yeah... So, in\nBialystok, when I wrote a letter and that time I got in contact -- I was from the first --\nfrom the first -- you know, from the first survivors, we got -- they discovered about me,\nmy brother, that\u2019s the organization we\u2019re already operating in Bialystok, we had already\nfrom the -- from the Joint Distribution, we had all -- we had from -- from different kind\norganizations, not only Jewish organizations. It was a lot of -- it was at -- esta-established\nthe capital of Poland. So there was evil -- I didn\u2019t even know the evil was there in\nBialystok, so, oh you been sa -- partisan, I said par -- yes. Well, [indecipherable]. They\nwanted -- you know, there was no survivors, yet we didn\u2019t know about Auschwitz, we\ndidn\u2019t know -- the f -- we -- we didn\u2019t know where any concentration camp. So he says,\n\u201cDid you kept the diary?\u201d I -- I says, \u201cWhat diary?\u201d I says, \u201cNo.\u201d And they -- well they\nk-kept me there for couple weeks. They said, \u201cThink.\u201d You know, go home, something.\nThink and certain dates, pick certain dates. For instance, what did you do as -- in the\nregional part -- Jewish partisan, this -- you know, or that day -- or that day, a few days, or\n-- especially, you know, about -- they were interested in activities, about the life. And\nthey so -- I -- I\u2019ve -- that time, I told them the same story. You know, little bit more -- the\nsame story about the life in the ghetto, before the ghetto and all the same and I -- and --\nand -- and about my parents and -- and -- and they were especially interested about the\npartisan, Jewish li -- Jewish -- the activities, tell me. So I told them, ya -- that we were a\ngroup and -- and -- and we escaped the same -- the date we escaped and all this, the same\nstory of we did. How we organized, how we smuggled in this -- all this business and\nespecially and they were interested in the J -- Jewish group and then if we participated in\nany mission as Jewish group. So I told them yes, Je-Jewish beside that, we did\nparticipated. Like, I mentioned couple times that -- that we had those couple more\nmissions as a Jewish group. We went in near Proushinna and we had to get some -- you\nknow, we had to get some arms for the rest of the boys. We had a group of 60 there, you\nknow, some olders. Not everybody -- wh-when the ro -- this is before we joined, you\nknow, before we joined the Russian, but it was the -- it 1s -- we\u2019ll call itas--ac--a\ncommand s-structural command -- command from Russia, an order with discipline and\nall that. So, yeah we -- we participated in -- one time we went near Proushinna and -- and\nwe ambushed three German soldiers, we got three rifles, so we brought three rifles. This\nis beside -- beside what I participated from there. And especially this -- yeah, the\nactivities. And I mentioned m-most of it, but the main th -- I\u2019ve -- the main thing what I\ndidn\u2019t mention, in 1944, in May, we went through -- this is called -- a call -- a raid. A -- a\n-- this mission, destroy -- the Germans mobilized three divisions. One German division\nand two -- this was in 1945 and two Hungarians, because I didn\u2019t know the Hungarians\nwere allies for the -- the Hungarians, I think they -- they -- they allied -- they were with\nthe j -- with the -- and Ro -- and Romania and Hungaria, you know, they were allies for\nthe Germans. So they -- they -- th -- I mean, you know, they were in -- in the -- in\nGerman uniforms, though, in German uniform. And it came an order that we had to go\nthrough and clean them out once and for all. So it consisted from three divisions, 75,000\ns-strong. And they came in -- we knew already in advan -- you know, we had tiptoe if we\nhad lotake. We had good connection from the villages. And that time, 1t came an order\nfrom all the brigades, from all over stretching from this -- from eastern Poland, way up in\nLithuania, whatever, deep to the Russian territory, that we have to -- this was impor --\nimp -- that we, first of all, we have to mine all the roads and mine all the bridges. And\nwe're not going to get involved in the fight with them. There\u2019s no match, because tanks\nand -- and artillery, there\u2019s no match. But the first priority is to save the family -- family\nu -- the family we -- units. And that was a job. So, we had to take them out, way in the\nswamps, you know, hundreds of them. And we decided that -- that we going to -- we\ngoing to even mine the little roads where it leads to our bunkers and to our -- you know,\nwe had the -- the fields with the cows, everything was mined. We decided we\u2019re going to\nretreat in certain -- way up in the pinz -- the -- that -- that was swamps. So, in order to get\nint -- and in the swamps we had to go way up here in -- in mud, all the partisans. And\nsome of the -- you know, those -- those who couldn\u2019t make it -- we had to help the\nelderly and you know, we -- in advance -- so we whack away that first olea -- the f -- the\nfamily airtrads. Unfortunately there is only one occasion, there is one group, a family was\nabandoned, yeah. It was from the [indecipherable], I think it\u2019s 18. Well, so they and from\nall this, they went through the -- all the woods. They went in, they discovered our\nbunkers, they find everything. But -- they destroyed our cows, they destroyed our horses,\nthey blew out our bunkers and they destroyed our cemetery. We had a ce -- yeah, they\ndestroyed our cemetery. And not a single -- we retreated at -- and well, there was 17 from\nthe family which they found, unfortunate. It\u2019s -- we had very little -- th-there\u2019s very --\nand not much, I mean casualties, very small. But, de -- what I\u2019m saying, the big -- what\nthey -- that\u2019s all they could do is to destroy and -- and even to dis -- dis -- the cow there --\nkill the cows. They didn\u2019t take the cow, kill the cows, kill the horses and -- and -- and --\nand -- and blow up the bun -- blow up all the bunker. And eventually we came, you\nknow, they retreated. They retreated, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all and finally -- next -- this May --\nin June we were already -- in June we already -- we\u2019re already liberated. I mean they\nwere so desperate, they figure they will pull out the -- pull -- you know, they were\nretreating, they were s -- getting such a beating. You know, there\u2019s such a beating, you\nknow. Retreating in such a disarray, but it still -- they decided, well, we got to clean up --\nwe got to get those partisans -- to catch the partisans, yeah.",
        "Q: Wh- While I have you talking about that, there was one thing I sort of skipped over. When\nyou had described the machine gun that you worked with --",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah, it was a -- it -- this was -- this was very -- it\u2019s as just the same as a -- it\u2019s just the\nsame as a rifle.

If you don\u2019t hit the first time, she hit a second time. This was -- yeah, it\u2019s -- it -- it\nwas just a simple thing -- a simple thing. You know, you did -- you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t\ntry to pinpoint a certain -- it\u2019s a big, big, big engine, you know. And you lay -- it\u2019s got to\ngo -- we were pretty close, you know, we lay in the woods there, near there in a spot, you\nknow, waiting exactly when it\u2019s going to reach and there\u2019s a perfect time to hit it. There\u2019s\nno pro -- it was no problem. This was mine -- this was -- this was minor. This was very\neasy, minor. It happened one time that -- that we were cut off and we were chased and\nyou know, the Germans, they yugerfer -- they called reinforcement and more\nreinforcement and they chased us in the wood and I had, you know and I had to run with\nthat -- with that gun and I told the commander that -- everybody was in disarray,\neverybody was running and I says, you know, \u201cSave the guy, it\u2019s heavy, I\u2019m going to\ndrop.\u201d I's -- told.

        "A: Well, yeah -- well, he heard -- he heard already that I\u2019m on the way with that -- you\nknow, that\u2019s -- matter -- I brought a cow [indecipherable]. Now, the only thing what I\nbrought from -- from -- from Proushinna, when I traveled, so I had a cow.",
        "Q: A cow?",
        "A: A cow, yeah, attached to the wagon, with the doctor. So I figure, what I\u2019m going to take,\nthe house? I\u2019m my -- you cannot sell it. I mean the house -- y- you can -- what was --\nwhat -- what is a house? I mean there is no value. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know there was\na market for it. So I figure I\u2019m going to bring a cow. At least in Poland, in Bialystok you\ncan sell a cow and get -- and get the -- I don\u2019t know, 10 dollars or five dollars or\nsomething. And just for -- just for fun of it, sa -- that\u2019s all is I brought -- I brought a cow.\nSo he heard already, you know. I think -- I th -- I -- he heard that -- you know, he\u2019s on the\nway. They -- you know, from rumors, he\u2019s on the way to -- traveling with a cow, with a\ndoctor, with a nun.",
        "Q: And how did you find him? Was it difficult to find him?",
        "A: No, no. There was -- 1-1t was easy. You know that you -- like I say, you had that Jewish --\nthat\u2019s the Jewish o -- council there and you had organization and they -- it\u2019s -- I\u2019m afraid\n-- they -- they didn\u2019t know much about all the survivors, but they knew, you know, they\nknew who was in Bialystok, you know. If you want to look for somebody, you go in\nthere. And -- you know, had a -- a-anybody was registered right there, you -- from all\nthese -- from all the survivors. Mostly -- eventually, like when I came, there was still --\nyou know, there\u2019s still -- the c-camps were -- I did -- the camps were still -- Auschwitz\nwasn\u2019t even liberated. And -- and -- I didn\u2019t hear -- that\u2019s -- I didn\u2019t hear about\nAuschwitz, even in -- see -- even in the woods. You see, it was impossible sometimes -- I\nwould say to s -- there\u2019s never s -- never was an escapee from the camp. Speaking -- they\nhad -- they had -- they had not only Jews, they had, you know, prisoners, Poles and the\nRussians and they had Gypsies there, all. Sometime -- you weren\u2019t be able to escape from\nthere.",
        "Q: Did you find -- did you go and look? Did you -- in -- in -- in the lists of people, thinking\nthat your sisters might be there? Or your mother?",
        "A: Well, well, when I met the girl, the first girl from -- from Bialy -- the one in Bialystok, so\nI knew they went to Auschwitz. Now, I know they went to Auschwitz, so -- as a rule, you\nknow my sister was -- the -- you know, they was -- they were too young yet, you know,\nin Auschwitz the way the system, so they separated those -- those -- those who are able to\nwork yet, know -- women or men and th-they -- they weren\u2019t -- you know, I -- I -- I was\nsure that, you know, they went to the right or the left. They went to right, they went in the\ncrematorium. Because otherwise you know, you do -- would have known. I didn\u2019t expect\nmy mother -- I didn\u2019t expect -- the only thing I resent is -- you know, I could have -- if I\nwould know, know -- that\u2019s what -- if I would know, I -- ner -- I could have saved one\nsister. If she would be with me -- with us in the bunker, like some other strangers, she\nwould be -- she would survived. I mean, she would went through, see? Even though,\nwell, she was -- she was -- would have been 17 years old, a big girl -- a big girl, see? So\nit\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know, like I say, it\u2019s hard to say if you did the right thing or na -- if I did the\nright thing or the wrong thing, I wouldn\u2019t say -- I -- they let history say, I -- I couldn\u2019t say\nthe -- really, if it is the right thing. You know, I was asked -- I was asked this question. I\ndon\u2019t know, you know, if it\u2019s, yeah do I feel? That\u2019s -- how -- about -- you know, about\ngoing through all that. But I know one thing that, you know -- that it\u2019s important as a\nsurvivor that -- I have a duty to -- to tell this -- you know, to the story for the future --\nfuture generation.",
        "Q: One thing I [indecipherable] think I read, that for all -- you told me too, that earlier in\nyour life, you didn\u2019t really like to talk about this. That you didn\u2019t -- you really --",
        "A: Oh no, I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: -- you wouldn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, I -- right, I didn\u2019t. I -- the children knew a little, I -- I didn\u2019t because I was --\nI tried to -- I -- you know, I was raising a family, three children and I was in business and\nI worked hard and somehow, you know, I tried -- it was -- I tr -- I tried to -- not to\nadvertise. I mean my family knew, the children, you know. I wasn\u2019t advertise. I was\napproached a way -- I was approached a couple times by -- you know, when it comes --\nYom HaShoah or something and I -- from the television years ago. And I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nwant to re-really, you know, this twa -- the -- all the -- all the stories. Tried to -- I tried to,\nsomehow to make peace with that. Forget it and make peace.",
        "Q: So what changed your mind?",
        "A: Well, I think my son influenced me, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he\u2019s active and I\u2019m glad\nabout that, yeah. He\u2019s active. He influenced me, he said, \u201cDad, you got to tell your\nstory.\u201d And finally up in public and this -- I started -- I wrote it in the -- in that -- first I\ngave him a chance. I didn\u2019t want to go to the papers. So, I figured for -- in Syracuse and I\ncame ri -- you know, fir -- all the -- came right to Syracuse and it\u2019s 50 years. I decided it\nwas 50 years, 194- -- 1994, 50 years liberation and, well maybe it\u2019s a time to say -- 50\nyears liberation. I was liberated in 1944 and this was 19 -- 1994, so I figured Pll write a\nlittle -- yeah. And -- and it was this -- the city was -- was shocked. They [indecipherable]\nI\u2019m the only -- they say the only -- we have quite a few and there is a lot -- I mean, and of\ncourse the -- it\u2019s already the -- all the ones -- a lot of them are gone, you know, are gone.\nHow many more years do I have? But as a rule, you know, I\u2019m the young one,\ncomparison -- I was only 20, you know when I -- 20 when I escaped, but if somebody\nwas 30 or 25 - 30 or 40, th -- you know, [indecipherable]. So they probably gone, they --\n[indecipherable] are gone.",
        "Q: One story that I didn\u2019t get you to tell then, which is about the Leaman brothers and the\nrabbi?",
        "A: Oh well, the -- well, the Leaman -- we killed the Leaman brothers. That\u2019s -- you know, I\ntold you, we ki --",
        "Q: Yes, but I didn\u2019t know the rest of the story.",
        "A: I -- yeah, the Leaman brothers, you know, when we as -- we were assigned -- the\npartisans that time, we were strong together. We couldn\u2019t do it ourselves as a group. We\ncould never do that -- we didn\u2019t have the power and the ammunition to do that. But from\nan -- already being assigned to the brigade, so I told the commandeer and he said,\n\u2018\u201c\u201cHadashov we\u2019 ll -- let\u2019s try it.\u201d I says, \u201cWe got to get -- that\u2019s the easy job, to get this\nguy.\u201d Because he was -- he was a terrible Nazi. And I mean, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s worthwhile, so we\ngot him. And the second -- you mentioned that -- yeah, but of all this, yeah. I -- I found\nout about the rabbi. Now, there\u2019s a lot -- among the f -- 22 Jewish Judenrat, is -- only two\nsurvived -- you know, 20 perished in Auschwitz and two survived. One 1s in -- this --\nthey already both dead. They -- they all -- I mean, they survived. One was in United\nStates and one was in Israel. Now, they wrote the same thing at Yad Vashem, they wrote\ntheir stories. And the one 1s in -- the one was in the United States is as -- is Sagell. He\nwas the Foreign Minister. Now, he\u2019s -- before the war, he was ins -- in the business in\nDanzig, somehow in the export -- import you international. He s-speak fluently, German.\nAn intellectual, you know, educated man, they made him Foreign Minister. So he wrote\nsomething -- you know, we had a pinkus -- you call that a me -- a memorial book. From -\n- my story is from the -- is from the evewa -- you know, eva what -- what they --\neventually was printed in Israel in Yad Vashem. I didn\u2019t even know, I discovered that in\nthe 1950\u2019s, that they had evewa eventually printed at -- in Hebrew. I wrote it -- you\nknow, I wrote it in Yiddish and I had that in book in Yiddish. And -- and so this Sagell,\nhe was in charge about dealing and wheeling with the Burgermeister and all the\ntransports, where is -- was coming in and anything coming in in the ghetto -- outside the\nghetto, he was responsible, he was dealing direct with the -- with the Burgermeister, with\nthe SS. So, he says, from the Bialystok I came in -- that\u2019s what I -- what came in a\ntransfer from Bialystok, he had to receive them and they came in by truck. Because far --\nlike I say, some of them had to march -- they marched them. They brought in two hun --\n2000. It took about couple days. So, he says, here is -- you know, here is your shyser, you\ntake them in now. I don\u2019t know if you understand in German?",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Here is your shy -- the Jews what from Bialystok. Here is your shyser, take him in in the\nghetto. The shyser is partly -- you know what I mean in the shyser? Well, it\u2019s a -- kitty\nlitter [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Here 1s -- you know, take -- here is your shyser, now you take him in. This is\n[indecipherable]. Now with the rabbi, this Leaman, I didn\u2019t know that -- you know, he\ntook the rabbi -- it was a lot of -- he took the rabbi, he used the rabbi and he told him --\nhe was a heavy man, a big man. And he to-to-to-told him, take the tallis and twirl it and\nhe told him to march and run, in the ghetto. Now, he was bribed many times. He was\ninterested -- he was so interested in the bribe, the big bribe. He knew he 1s going to get --\nhe -- he could have -- I mean, actually he could have shot the rabbi, he can do anything, I\nmean he had the power to do anything he want. But he probably wanted a big, big bribe.\nSo somebody noticed it, I didn\u2019t. You know, I didn\u2019t see it, but somebody noticed it in\nthe ghetto, you know. You know -- you know, \u201cThe ra -- they marching the rabbi,\nLeaman.\u201d So they had to bribe him and in order to release him, see? And what happened,\nhe -- he went to Auschwitz the same, he went to Auschwitz, the rabbi. But to them it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s f -- it\u2019s something unusual, right? But they ne -- he knew that it\u2019s\ngot a twa -- a tallis. They knew -- he\u2019s got twirling.

        "Q: Is there something I haven\u2019t asked you that you would like to say?",

It\nmeans -- it means that you have to f -- you have to f-fight and educate people and -- and -\n- and -- and hope -- and hope that -- that all those people who perished -- I would say\ndidn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t go in vain, what you call that. You know what I mean? And they -- that --\nthat... that\u2019s what happened, it happened.

        "A: [indecipherable] yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah it was. And the [indecipherable], he had, besides\nthe flour mill, but he was in partnership with somebody, he wasn\u2019t alone. He was in\npartnership with -- with -- with another -- with another person and they -- besides the --\nthey had -- the -- th-th-the flour mill, they had a soybean mill, because in -- in the vicinity\naround Proushinna territory, the farmer\u2019s used to plant soybeans and from the soybeans,\nbesides the -- they used to ha -- make soybean oil. He had a -- you know, a compressing\nscr -- compr -- compress the soybean, make s-soybean o1-oil and -- and I know it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\n-- from the process, the way it was compressed and when the -- all the oil got out of it, of\ncourse what\u2019s left over, it was like this ground -- ground from the leftover, from the\ngrain, this was used for -- the farmers use-used that for feeding their cattle.

        "A: And there -- like I say, the grandfather, he had the farm, so the son was involved in the f -\n- in the farming and the son-in-law. And my father, now, you\u2019ll ask me that -- now my\nfather was a Yeshivablocher, you know, you went to Yeshiva. And the -- in -- and it\nhappened to be in Proushinna being Yeshiva. And the Yeshiva, the way it was set up, you\nknow, each -- da -- each day somebody else used to -- you wite -- wite the\nYeshivablocher for supper and on the weekends, Friday night, Shabbat, you was invited\nto my grandf -- my grandfather\u2019s place and eventually he -- that\u2019s where he met my\nmother, in there, and -- and he married my mother.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- ya -- no, th-that\u2019s the way -- that\u2019s the way they\u2019re set up, you know? We didn\u2019t\nhave restaurants, but that\u2019s the way they set up, yeah. Each Jewish family invites a\nYeshivablocher, you know, when it was a holiday Shabvas, for -- you know, for after --\nafter the services to come -- come from -- from Shul to come to his place. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s --as a\nmatter of fact, he had sometimes two or three Yeshivablocher -- to -- my grandfather.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what -- it was -- it was like steady -- being s -- invited there for the holiday --\nfor holidays and -- and the -- Friday for Shabbat, you know. So -- and that\u2019s the way they\nmet and -- and that\u2019s the way they -- when they got married. Now, you cannot make a -- a\nshe -- Yeshivablocher, you know. They was going to take him in in the business -- in the\nfarm, you know, in the -- in the farm business. But there\u2019s a saying, you know,\nYeshivablocher, you know, learns, so [indecipherable] you cannot make a -- you cannot\nmake a farmer out of Yeshivablocher. So -- so what happened, is -- this was, of course,\nbefore the first war under the Czar. And they had a little -- where the little f-factory,\nbesides -- making cigarettes, just to make cigarettes and s -- and sell the cigarettes. But\nafter -- after the war, when the Polish -- Poland became independent, they -- and what\u2019s -\n- it\u2019s the tobacco and cigarette business was concessions -- you couldn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t -- it -\n- it -- it -- you c -- you was allowed, they gave him a concession slip, instead they\nliquidated, or they took it over [indecipherable] a little factory from the cigarettes and\nthey gave him the right, a concession to sell tobacco products.",
        "A: It was in Poland you couldn\u2019t have. It was -- it was concessioned tobacco, it was the\nsame thing as liquor, it was concession. So they gave him half -- they gave him a permit,\na concession and we opened the store. It -- we had the in Proushinna there was -- call it a\n-- on the marketplace over here, like all the -- you got your shopping centers, but those --\nwe had that -- we had -- in the center of the city was a marketplace and there were about -\n- a big buildings with probably 100 stores -- you know, little stores and each store -- we\nmostly, mostly be Jewish merchants. I would say 95 percent. So you had a store, you\nknow, like a tobacco concession store, hardware store, a liquor store and -- and a\ndrugstore and you know, the -- with all this -- it\u2019s -- store, the individual stores, selling\nindividual products. And so he had a store and selling tobacco products.",
        "A: Well, it wa -- the s -- the store, you -- it was all in one big building and they -- 1-it was s-\nstores all around, east, west, you know. It wasn\u2019t really square, it\u2019s mostly I would say,\nshape like a -- a -- how would you call it?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So I would say the -- for some -- like a big 25 -- 25 feet or 25 feet by 15 or\nsomething like that. It\u2019s not too -- not too big stores, because 100 stores in one building,\nnot big enough. But that\u2019s the way -- all the stores were the same size. Now we had,\nespecially it was im-important, the textile stores located in this marketplace and because\nin -- in -- in [indecipherable] -- in Proushinna, you couldn\u2019t go in and buy a suit or buy a\npair of pants or buy a pair of shoes. Everything -- you had to buy clothes, you went to a\ntailor -- tailor made and the tailor made you a suit or the tailor made you a pants. The\nsame thing, you know, there were leather stores there. So you went and you bought some\n-- you know, you went -- actually -- I mean either you went for yourself or da -- you\nordered -- you went to your shoemaker, the shoemaker went to -- what you had to buy --\nleather goods in the store. So everyth -- ev -- every store was -- was unique, the same\nsize. The only -- the only yourk occasions, the textile stores and this was a very\nexceptional busin-bu-business, in -- in -- in -- in push -- in the market, because all the\nfarmers -- we used to have twice a week, it -- we call it a farmer\u2019s market, where the -- all\nthe stores were located and there was a lot of land -- I mean it wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t paved\nlike over here, it was all with stones. It was where the farmers used to come twice a\nweek. Used to come on -- I think it was the -- like on Tuesday and Thursday and bring\ndown their products to sell. We depended on the farmers -- so all the vegetables, fresh.\nThey sold eggs, vegetables, chickens, even meat. But most -- it mostly they was coming\nand selling their -- you know, the ca-calfs to the -- for the butchers, there was so many\nbutchers around, too. You would -- to buy calfs and cows and -- and ships and chicken.\nSo everything was brought from the farmers and there were -- they were spread out, I\nwould say was acres, was acres of land around the -- that farm -- that marketplace where\nthey used to, you know, they used to unload the -- and s-s-stay all day til sometimes the\nproducts were sold.",
        "A: Oh, well, we -- you know, it\u2019s -- Pr-Proushinna was a city, it -- it was not a big city. The\npopulation in general was, I would say, around 12,000. And the -- 57 percent of the\npopulation was Jewish. So I would say it -- it\u2019s roughly put at 12,000 -- 50 cent -- it\nprobably had -- had at least six or 7,000 Jewish families. And -- and see, we had a house\non Kobrina, you know, [indecipherable] Kobrina, they c-ca -- that\u2019s another city, they\ncall it Kobrine, was a -- a city a-about 40 - 50 kilometers from Proushinna, so they call it\nKobrinska -- Kobrinska s-street, number 25 and it was mostly -- this street where we\nlived was mostly Jewish. There were some Gentiles, but a street full mostly with boys,\nvery few girls on the whole street. Now, I -- I mean -- I had all my friends next, like a\nfew blocks away, there was four boys and there was three boys. Now, we had -- in our\nfamily, there was two girls, they call it Kobrina street, you -- you know, if there is no\ngirls [indecipherable] and boy street.",

        "A: Oh. Well, we used to -- now you may -- you was asking about a house.",
        "A: We had a -- we had a good size house and in back of our house was a little pound and in -\n- and really many times when it was raining -- of-often -- eff -- in the back were the big\ngarden, very big garden. And you know, my mother and I and the children, we used to\nhelp. We enjoyed -- we rai -- we raised our own vegetables, that\u2019s -- we ha -- we raised\nour own, even chickens and ducks and -- and turkeys and -- and in the back of the ca --\nback of the -- many times in the back of the garden, there was a little -- little pound and\nthe pound just --",

        "A: Yeah. And what happens, wintertime, it used to freeze up, so we -- mostly the -- you\nknow, the younger ch -- young -- we were kids, we were skating on the pound. It was\nmore -- you know, it\u2019s Saturday, it was boys and girls. Of course that time we didn\u2019t have\nthe skates like here now. The first skates I remember I had was made out of wood, with a\nsteel wire attached to it. Eventually, you know, we got some skates, which was sf -- you\nhad to have a special -- special shoe and s -- and the-there -- there was a latch where you\nattach and -- and then -- and then you had to tighten it up. I mean, this was a real luxury.\nThis was already -- we didn\u2019t have those -- like hockey -- hockeys boots and skates\n[indecipherable]. So wintertime we used to s -- mostly skate and -- and the big sport was\nsoccer, you know, in Europe, where kids -- especially mostly boys, we used to play\nsoccer. And they would -- so each organize groups and you know, we -- the youth belong\n-- those years in Poland, we used to belong to certain organization, was a Zionist\norganization. It was Zionist organization, consisted of so many branches. It was -- you\nhad the -- you had the Shamir and you had the -- the Haroots and you had the Bitar and\nyou had -- you know, all those -- all those Zionist organization. Leftist, Rights and left --\nlefts -- Leftists. And girls used to belong to the -- those organizations and we used to\nmeet -- meet in -- 1n certain halls -- we had a hall and play sometimes Ping Pong and play\nduring the -- the weekend. And our -- was a big game -- boys, we used to -- we used to\nplay chess in the evening. Chess was very popular, it -- as a matter of fact, my father was\na Chess player. You learn how to play Chess. He was a good Chess player. So I used to\nplay with him. And so I learned to play then. We used to get together in the evening and\nplay Chess. Ch -- and -- but I was -- I had a -- a friend next to us, where we lived and\nthey were -- they had a factory and they made soft drinks and seltzer water and this was a\ngood business too, you know. Every -- everywhere, especially for the holidays and for\nSabbath, you ordered those -- I remember the [indecipherable] where you get those, it\nwas quess -- quess [indecipherable] seltzer water. Every Jewish family had that. And\nbeside, they used to make soft drinks, too -- out as -- you know, bottled soft drinks, or --\nand they had a radio those years, they had a radio. And when I was -- this was for -- when\nI was y-young -- 13 - 14. So, we used to listen, usually in the evenings, beside playing\nChess, you know, there\u2019s -- used to get together, not only s -- couple more friends and\nafter playing Chess, we used to listen to the radio. This was before -- this was in the\nbeginning -- in the beginning 30\u2019s -- 1930\u2019s. So we loved especially th-th-the favor of\nmine and all it was -- we used to put on the Gypsy music from Soffie -- Soft -- the capitol\nof -- I think it\u2019s from Sof -- Sofi -- Sof -- e1 -- onc -- I said Onc?",

        "A: Sofia, yeah.",
        "A: It was a -- think it\u2019s a na -- it\u2019s Gypsy music. And the -- after, you know, when it started\nin the 19 -- 1933 and that -- and as -- you know, when that Hitler came to power and the\nNazis overtook the -- the power in Germany and I was very interested in politics. So, his\nfather, the -- my friend\u2019s father were -- you know, what I\u2019m -- that-- we were visiting and\nlisten to the radio and he was -- well, now [indecipherable], he was a intraer politician.\nAnd so that\u2019s -- they started, you know, listening to the -- what was going on and the way\nHitler came to power and the rise -- the rise of the Reich and -- and eventually, 1935,\nwhen they -- they started the -- you know, the Nuremberg laws were -- and I followed\nthat and -- and we were still in Poland, figure well, it was -- you heard about war is going\nin in Germany, but so you figured, you know, it\u2019s in Germany, but y-you -- you were\nconcerned of course, but you still -- life was going on as normal in Poland, this was still\nin 1933 - \u201834 - \u201835.

We lived in Poland here. We live\nin Poland. And eventually, in 19 -- so -- and then it was interesting. It was a -- a doctor,\nlived not far from us, too. And her name is -- is Ola Goldfinich.

This is in 19 -- speaking in 19 --\nbefore 39, Iwas I was 17, still at the school, so I didn\u2019t make up my mind yet what I\nwas going to do. I figured worse, you know, being -- being in the family, you know,\nhaving in the business family, an uncle, if I would want to go work for my uncle. It\u2019s --\nmy older brother, you know, the spare time worked there, you know, made extra money.\nAnd to go in in farming, I didn\u2019t think about it yet. I didn\u2019t -- 1t -- you know, it came, 19 -\n- in 1939 the war broke out. Nowadays, I don\u2019t know if here when you\u2019re 17 you know\nwhat you want to do. You know, I probably -- I probably, maybe -- my older brother did\nalready -- decided to u -- immigrate to the United States. He was three years older and he\napplied now -- the -- now I couldn\u2019t do it because I\u2019m -- we were so close with the\nfamily, so [indecipherable] and so -- and I was figuring he is going to leave the family.\nHe applied and -- in 1937, for a visa to the United States, to uncle Elman in Syracuse and\nit was -- it -- you know, it takes time. If not the war -- if the war wouldn\u2019t break out in\n1939, maybe 1939, \u201840, we\u2019d all be in the United States.",

I knew all the history. So we were speaking politics with my\nfather. He was involved in politics.

        "A: The -- the -- Germany. After all, if there is the law -- that\u2019s only Germany, you know.\nDon\u2019t do it -- but it\u2019s like the same, it was -- it was -- 1t was taw -- it was hard. You live\nall your life in a country, you build a country, so you figured some did, you know, left,\nwho knows? Those -- some decided and they left, in the -- you know, already 19 -- 1936,\n\u201837, before they were able, they left and they had to abandoned, you know, they are --\nthey have to give up their businesses. I think in the beginning they were able to sell --\nforced to sell. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the law changed so rapidly there, that in the\nbeginning they -- they allow you to sell what you had to sell, you know, prac-practically\nto give it away. But at least you were able to sell and you were able to get out. You were\nable to get out, if you had a place where to go. So some went out. S-Some, I know, so in -\n- some German Jews were able to get out in that time now. Actually where you\u2019re going\nto go depends -- depends who 1s going to accept you. You see, I know that. My brother,\nhe -- he had a relative, so -- so many here -- relatives here and it took -- it took from \u201837 -\n\u201839, two years, it was a quota -- everything was in a quota. Polish quota and -- you\ncouldn\u2019t -- you could -- there were so many, probably, applications, that you had to wait\nfor your next. And probably the same as in Germany. Now, there was no place to go --\nthe only sodo -- the -- some went -- some went to -- some went probably United States, I\nunderstand now and they left for the United States, where we were able. I take it the\nmajority mostly went -- if we didn\u2019t have a Jewish state, we went to Palestine. Yeah,\nthat\u2019s the only he -- somehow, illegally went to Palestine. And those who remained, see, I\ndon\u2019t know, either they still didn\u2019t believe -- this was before all the atrocities, before all\nthe -- you know, before all the -- the c-camps and the -- the chambers. Gas chambers\nwasn\u2019t heard of yet in those years. They didn\u2019t know anyth -- you know, nobody knew\nabout it yet, what was going on. You had some laws -- certain laws went in, okay, that ya\n-- there in Germany, I don\u2019t know if they had -- in the -- where those -- I don\u2019t think until\nlate -- later they had -- in 1938, I think they had to wear their yellow stars, but in\nbeginning they -- the beginning they -- the laws that -- you know, you weren\u2019t allowed to\npractice your profession.",
        "A: W-Well, he -- he was -- the politics -- now, the later years already, 1t was when -- in 19 --\nin 1939 -- so we were fortunate that Proushinna -- see, the Germans started the war in --\nin September. The po -- you know, the war started September first, 1939 -- in all the\nhistory. You know they requested, you know -- bef-before it -- before it started the war\nwith Poland. That\u2019s -- we call it actually when the second war started, but bef -- in 1938,\nthe Anschluss -- you know they took over it -- they took over Aust-Austria without -- I\nmean the Anschluss, I mean they were invited without -- just marched 1n and took it over\nand they -- and they -- they were -- they were welcomed with flowers and they were --\nthey were -- you know, they were happy that -- and then I know it came with\nCzechoslovakia. You know, I followed all on the -- you know, I followed all the news\nwith the checko -- in Czechoslovakia -- th-they requested the Sudinland -- Sudatenland.\nNow, Sudatenland, they choseu at that time, chare with what\u2019s his name, that if -- a\nforeign -- Foreign Minister from Britain, Chamberlain, he still went down, you know, and\nyou made -- y-y-you gave him alcage -- they agreed, the Czechs agreed to -- to -- to give\nit up S-Sudatenland. The reason -- they were greedy, they claimed Sudatenland was --\nonce belonged to the Germans and there was a lot of German nationals. So we ke -- you\nalways exclaim, I remember exclaim -- they said they were mistreated and this and that --\nthe reason given why he wants to give it Sudatenland. So finally -- you know the Czechs,\nthey didn\u2019t have a choice, so they gave it off bit Sudatenland. But he wasn\u2019t satisfied and\n-- and -- and that\u2019s when the p -- you know, the pact was made with -- win Chamberlain\nand it was -- Czech, the Czech was sold out. See, Chamberlain thought he\u2019s got a pact,\nyou know, with Hitler. You cannot make with -- make up with a tyrant --\n[indecipherable] a tyrant like that. And -- and that came back and this, and he says now --\npeace is now -- he established peace and the world is going to have peace now. And the -\n- you see the feather -- the -- the feather of the allies and finally he grabbed all\nCzechoslovakia. So then he started, in 1939, he started with Poland, but was -- speaking\nabout Poland, now Poland was an -- see, they were an -- anti-Semitic later. In the\nbeginning, when Poland was established, the president th -- th -- 1t was that Marshall\nYusef Pulsutski. He was the one organized the army and liberated Poland. Under\nPulsutski -- he was -- he was a social democrat iff, you know? And under him, it was --\nthe Jews felt safe and they were -- you know, incorporated as -- as democracy, treated as\nany other -- or a -- you know, there was not too many in Poland. We had nationalities\nhere, had Poles and you had -- you had Jews and you had some White Russian,\nBellarouse. It\u2019s not like he -- United States, you have so many nationalities, so many\ngroups -- or in Russia. So the anti-Semitism in Poland actually started after he died. Now,\nhe was -- it\u2019s -- there was rumors even going on. I heard that -- that th-the Jews saved P-\nPulsutski\u2019s -- you know they put the -- the -- the Russians were after him and they put -- I\ndon\u2019t know if -- where is common, they put a [indecipherable] on him and twirl him and\nthey saved him and he appreciate that -- that\u2019s fa -- you know? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s -- you\nf -- where -- it\u2019s not written in the history, but I -- that\u2019s what I heard. So he was ca -- he\nwas appreciate -- it was good. After he died, it -- this was in the late nine -- 20\u2019s -- and\nbeginning 1930\u2019s, that\u2019s when -- you know -- it -- the ch -- it changed. And what\nhappened influen -- the German influence a lot. So when the war broke out in 1939, the f\n-- the Foreign Minister of Poland, Beck -- disappeared and you find out he was a German\nspy, the Foreign Minister Beck. Now -- and he was influential to -- you know, they --\nthey -- they knew in Poland that\u2019s the war -- you know, that the Germans, first of all, they\nrequested -- they requested Danzig, that was the first thing. This was the -- the\ninternational port -- supposed to be -- did belong maybe one time, to Germany. So, okay,\nthey gave him -- s-so they gave him danz -- they gave him Danzig. But he wasn\u2019t\nsatisfied. Then h-he wanted -- he wanted the other part, we are speaking of -- about\nPoland -- he -- that -- the same thing in Poland, they were on that border with Germany,\nwhich -- there -- when Poland was established a independent state, there was a lot of\nGerman nationals there. So he -- je lee -- I remembered it exactly that the pretext that he\nsays, you know the Poles are mistreating the j -- the -- the -- the German nationals and\nthey killed German nationals -- is going to -- that\u2019s why he\u2019s going to just -- you know, 1s\ngoing to try and save his -- the -- his G-German nationals. It was a bluff. It -- it was a\nbluff, it was an excuse.",
        "A: In -- in --",
        "A: Libby -- you -- in -- this is already -- in nine -- in 1939, see what ha -- see what happened\nin 1939, we were saved by the -- it\u2019s -- we ex -- the war started and the Germ -- we\nexpected the Germans. And the Germans came in our town. They stayed a day or two,\nwas quiet. You know, we were in -- outside, we had to get water, you know, we didn\u2019t\nhave water inside, running water. We had to go to the wells, get water ona. And the army,\nthey -- it was -- it was quiet, he -- nothing, I mean, there was n -- and all of a sudden,\novernight, they pulled out. So we didn\u2019t even know there was a secret pact between --\nmade between Stalin and Hitler. And then we realized, you know, finally, you know, that\nthat\u2019s when it started in thir -- in \u201839. See, they m -- Stalin and Hitler made a secret pact\nand it promised -- gave Poland, it says, eventually you can -- you know, you can take\nover Lithuania, you can take over Latvia, you can take over Estonia and then gave him\nlittle -- if you want a little territory someplace -- you don\u2019t want -- this is -- between the\nCzechoslovakia and -- and -- and Romania, they call -- that\u2019s the part -- part of the\nterritory they gave it to the Russians. And so the Russians came over to our city, that was\nalmost -- you know, so we had from \u201839 to 1941 were the Russians. Well, under the\nRussians, when they came over, all right, I mean it was -- the system changed, but it\nwasn\u2019t like in the Soviet Union, you know what I mean? It -- the -- especially for the\nprofessionals, what somed -- was even better than -- than in Poland. You know, teachers\nwere very important, you know, you could -- they had -- you remained the Jewish --\nJewish schools, the worn clothes, you went to a Jewish school, you went to Russian\nschool, or the Polish school. They kept, you know the schools -- the schools the way --\nthe way it was before. And even -- even the farmers, they -- they didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t\ncollectawhy, you know what I mean?",
        "A: Co -- Collect -- you know, like in Russia? They -- each farmer still operated and se -- but\nmy grandfather, they took -- my grandfather was too big, so they took -- they took the\nfarm away, yeah. They took the farm away and they\u2019Il -- they\u2019Il let him manage to -- put\nit this way, I mean it\u2019s already -- you know, and they paid him a salary -- paid him a --\npaid a -- paid him a salary. So it means -- and -- but the profession -- doctors the same,\nwere working in the hospitals and the -- the private practice and lawyers -- it didn\u2019t\nchange very much. So we had a normal -- we had a normal life for another two years, for\n1939 - 19 -- 1941. So I went to the Russian school. So, from the Polish school I had two\nmore years, I went to the Russian school. And in the Russian school we learned Russian\nhistory and there was no anti-Se -- anti-Semitism at all.",
        "A: Well, what ca -- the reaction -- of course, I mean it\u2019s -- not much, I mean the reaction, it -\n- it not much you can do. They took away the same thing, they took away my uncle\u2019s fa -\n- you know. They let him work there, he managed the mill at the same -- they took away.\nYeah -- well, we expected the Germans. It\u2019s -- you know, we expected the Germans and\nit\u2019s already 1939, it\u2019s already too late. Where you going to go? I mean, if the German\nwould come, there is no way you can -- nowhere to go. It\u2019s too late to go. So at least you\nknow with the reaction -- you didn\u2019t like it, I mean, but at least we heard what\u2019s going on\non the other side of Poland there. All the refugees from the -- from the western Poland,\nthey were -- they were flooding -- you know, trying to get in to the eastern, where we --\nyou know, where we were under the Russians. A lot of them -- a lot of them, you know,\nfrom -- from big cities -- from Lodz or from Warsaw, from other cities, they were able\nyet, in the beginning, you know, to smuggle through -- going through. And the -- and the\nRussian accepted them in the beginning, but there was such a flood later on, there was a\nlot of -- came -- came over with a flood, so the Russians sent them away up sisib you\nknow, was too many, they send them to ser -- to -- to -- not to Siberia, but you know yur,\nthere\u2019s a Azerba-Azerbaijan in Russia, they try to make -- now under the Russian, this\nwas under Stalin, tried to make a Jewish re-re-repull like a Jewish state in Azerbaijan,\nyou had the Jews there. Yeah, so they went there. [indecipherable] some of them\nsurvived. So it\u2019s better than -- we heard already, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s better than -- than the\nNazis.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I was -- I was all -- I was involved with each -- that\u2019s -- you know, in -- in\nProushinna we had two groups. There was Zionist group -- like I say the Zionist group\nthere were -- there was Shamir -- atsa -- Holatsim and -- and -- and -- and the Istad, there\nis a lot ou -- ou -- a lot of groups from the Zionists and then there were the Bund. You\nknow, the Bund is -- this is Socialist groups. They believed -- they didn\u2019t believed in a\nJewish state in Zionist, they believed that, you know, you live in Poland and you -- you\ngot to be citizen of Poland and live in Poland and try to -- and try to get your education,\nyou know, do the best you can and account for your livid.

I was -- I was a Zionist and I was a Zionist and I\nwould belong to Bitar, which is -- Bitar is the organization, they call it a leekhood now.\nWhat\u2019s in Israel, leekhood. I always believed that, you know, if you want to have a state\nnow -- we always -- if you want to have a state, nobody -- you have to fight for state,\neven if not -- but even if you -- you know, we didn\u2019t have a Jewish state, we have\nPalestine. And so even if you tr -- you know, you -- you illegal, you get into Palestine,\nyou have to be able to defend yourself. City Jews, you know, they settled there, they\nworked hard in the beginning and on the Kibbutzim and all that and eventually some\nArabs, they came -- you know, there was a lot of -- and ca -- there was a lot of pogroms,\nthey -- in -- in pal -- you know, in Palestine before the Jewish state. Because see, they\ndidn\u2019t believe that -- you know, the Jews that -- in -- in -- what you call it -- in fighting or\nsomething -- resisting fighting. I mean, even if you -- if you leave your home there and\nyou work -- and you -- you know these people work in the swamps, those pioneers. We\nhad so many pioneers from my town went. I had a friend, his brother went before the war.\nHe was a pioneer, went to -- if we didn\u2019t have a Jewish state, they went to Palestine. And\nyou -- you know, he survived. So I was -- I was a little -- they called us -- they did call us\nin -- in Proushinna, you know, they ca -- that time, you know, with the -- like -- in, say,\nthe brown shirts, you know, brown shirts like, you know, fighters.",

So --\ny-you know, when you belong to this group, you got -- you got somehow indoctrinated. I\nwould sa -- I know indoctrinated. That\u2019s for -- that\u2019s what we were be living to, you\nknow.

But he really\ndidn\u2019t care, yeah. But, you see, my father was a pessimist. Well, he -- well right -- this is\nspeaking about ninet -- when the war already when we were -- the war in \u201841, you know,\nwhen the st -- 1t started June. This was [indecipherable] the Russians, I t -- like I told you.\nWell, normal ristu -- in 1942, in June, 22, when the -- the war broke out with the\nRussians and the Germans, this was terrible. Now, they marched the -- first of all -- see,\nthey did, they tricked -- they did the same thing as the Japanese did with Pearl Harbor.\nYou know, they have the same system. They utilize the time when the Russians were on\nwhat you call it? Was a holiday off. Most -- most of them celebrated. And that\u2019s when\nthey attacked. And they -- it\u2019s about -- like I mentioned before, the border between the\nPolish - German, where the Germans are and here where we were is about press boog,\nthere we were boog for -- press the tob chashed. The boog divided and out of sight was\nthe Germans occupation, they were in the -- here were the Russians -- were the Russians.\nSo, I remember it was the ficausit overnight they broke through. And that they marched.\nIt was Panzer and tanks and motorcars and no one on foot. No one -- at -- less that, you\nknow, through the street -- through the city and oh, outside the street for weeks, power --\nopen. I mean they -- they -- they already broke through, they [indecipherable] it from 50.\nThey -- they broke through right away there. And we went out, we had to come out, you\nknow, like get some water. Everybody was afraid what sit in the house. And the only\nthing -- they didn\u2019t bother the army, they were marching, they didn\u2019t bother anybody,\nyou went out to get some water. And the only question is -- they were asking how far 1s\nMinsk? Well, I says, Minsk, you know, I was -- I was outside, too, I says, \u201cMinsk, you\njust cross the border.\u201d It depends -- it depends if they are from the -- you know, maybe\nthey are from way back. I mean -- on the -- w-what -- the -- they probably started maybe\nthe -- from Germany or from some -- western Poland my -- you know, the army. They\nsays, \u201cOh you -- you have a long way to go yet, I think, to Minsk, you still got maybe a\ncouple hundred kilometers.\u201d And it was open, you know.

        "A: They were in a panic, a retreated in that -- in that section. You know, there was three\nfronts. We were in the Bellarouse and there was Ukraine. They attacked from three sides.\nNow, the way I understand from -- from brief now a side, they broke through, right away\nthey went through. First of all, yeah, I didn\u2019t mention. When the Russian took over\nProushinna, they build a big airport -- right outside from Proushinna. We didn\u2019t have an\nairport. A big -- they probably prepared themselve, they -- either they knew, right near\nthe border. And it was a tremendous airport. And -- and -- mi-military airport. And they\nwere flying, training and flying pilots. So, in Proushinna, all the time was noise. During\nthe night it was, all the time. And we got a kick out of 1t sometime, you -- in the day, you\nknow, you saw the way the planes, you know, they do a -- they -- they -- they exercise in\nthe planes. I thought, \u201cGee, they\u2019re going to drop down.\u201d It was -- you know, it was -- it\nwas -- it\u2019s exciting things. So they had the -- the Germans bombed the first -- right away\nthey bombed the complete -- whatever airplanes was on the airport. They destroyed them\nall. [indecipherable] see?",
        "A: Not -- the Pr-Proushin-Proushinna, on the outskirts they did, but they di -- th-the airport\nand the outskirt of Proushinna -- so the airport was des -- was destroyed. And so f --\nabout maybe a month -- four or five weeks, that\u2019s all, they were marching, marching\nthrough the city. And everybody was sitting, was -- the people were sitting inside, were\nafraid to go out. But the German army didn\u2019t bother much.",
        "A: Yeah w-well -- well, we were -- we were -- [indecipherable] my mother saying that there\nis -- we knew -- we knew it\u2019s going to be -- we knew it\u2019s going to be trouble. I knew that.\nNot my -- we knew it\u2019s going to be trouble eventually. We understood, but not -- what\ncan you do, you know? You try the best. And so they -- wike went -- were -- the feeling -\n- what\u2019s -- we still -- you were still in your house, you stilled -- everybody knew the war\nis going starve it -- everybody prepared a little foods. You know, food and certain\nvegetables so last for awhile, whatever. And there\u2019s nothing unusual happened the first\nmonth -- three, four weeks for the [indecipherable]. But after, there were some military\npolice took it over, yeah. And they were used to maybe grab sometimes, you know,\ncertain Jewish people -- younger people, for certain work -- you know, clean up here,\nclean up there, whatever, yeah. But I mean there was nothing serious, unusual, serious\nhappened. But when -- after f -- about a month, then the Gestapo and the SS came in.\nAnd they took over control of the city. So the first -- the second day, what they did is\nthey requested -- they, you know, they had spies from the ca -- the local population\ncollaborated. Most of the intelligencia from 20 -- I think was 18 people, right away,\nwomen and men. And somebody, you know, a leader from the organization, a leader\nfrom the Temple and if they knew somebody\u2019s a Socialist and somebody\u2019s a Communist\nand somebody\u2019s -- so they selected 18 men and they took him right out to the -- it was not\nfar from Proushinna in the forest and they shot him. We knew that. We knew that. That\nwas the first couple days.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Because -- how did I know that? Because it was in ghetto established and we have\ncontact yet with the -- we were free to go out and mix with the Gentiles and they -- you\nknow, there is some religious around there, we knew that -- that, you know, they were\nshot. We knew that. It was no secret, everybody knew that. They took him out -- there\nwere some witnesses and this was the first two days. And it -- it took them about -- so 1-1t\n-- they used to grab every -- you know, every once in awhile, somebody -- we were still\nliving -- each one in -- you know, I lived in our house, each one was living in their own\nhomes. It was not a ghetto established. So they used to grab many times -- I remember\nthe ghetto was established, they grabbed some people to an airport -- I think I mentioned\nthere was a airport near the city and the Russians left a awful lot of -- you know, and they\nwere surprised -- is a lot of clean up -- debris is clean up and they left a lot of\nammunition. And this was -- this was wintertime in -- no, they -- no, th-this -- th-th-they\ncame in and no, that\u2019s not -- I\u2019m sorry, in the winter, this was the 20 -- June the 20 --\nJune 22. So, clean the airport and sometimes, you know, you get with -- you know, y-y-y\n-- depends -- depends where -- which group you worked for.",
        "A: Oh, well, yeah. I -- we were grabbed. For instance, what happened up -- now -- we were\non the airport, now, it happened to -- you know, there was an engines -- I\n[indecipherable] an engine. Big engine weighs 1000 pounds. And they told me, two\npeople to lift up the engine and put it on the truck. It\u2019s impossible, how can you put it in?\nI mean, you got to have a -- it weighs 1000 pounds, you\u2019re not going to pick it up. The\n[indecipherable] for them this was already -- you know, the SS and Gestapo. Pick it up.\n[indecipherable] you know, with a stick, hit you over the head, bang you. They know you\ncouldn\u2019t do it. F-For them it was -- you know what I mean. So, they beat you up and that\n-- finally, you know, they says, well, get a couple more help and put it on on the truck.\nThis was I -- the first days were I experien -- really experience. So, but -- you mean --\nyou couldn\u2019t do anything, you know, if they cat -- they -- they coo -- 1t was -- most of the\ntime a cleaning up jobs -- only men, they didn\u2019t take any women that time, only men,\nyoung. Mostly the younger men for ca -- all kind of clean up jobs. And eventually -- you\nknow, started dill -- 1t came in the laws -- before they stop this, the Judenrat, 1t came in\nalready, certain decree, certain laws. I remember that, that you know, you had to -- you\ncouldn\u2019t -- you still free to move outside the ghetto and deal and trade with the farmers if\nyou had a little money and all that and so you couldn\u2019t work already, a Jew, you had\nbefore, the arm band. You didn\u2019t have the yellow star, you had a arm band on the right\nside, with it says Juda. So it means, you know, if you went out, they knew that say Juda,\nout -- you -- they knew you\u2019re Juda, that\u2019s -- they grabbed ou-ouch -- otherwise they\u2019re\ngoing to grab somebody by the ow -- how did they know you -- know to grab -- to gr -- to\ngrab a Jew, because it\u2019s -- you have the arm band and they -- a Juda. Now, of course\neverybody followed, it\u2019s -- maybe some -- it wasn\u2019t s -- you know, you were scared. Inc -\n- you -- I mean, you put on the arm band, what would happen if you wouldn\u2019t po -- put\non the arm band, I really don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know, sometime, if they would\ndiscover it, you know, maybe they\u2019II kill you. Well, I -- it didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t experience\nthat. And -- but it didn\u2019t lasted, it lasted about a month and they started to organize the\nghetto. So -- and they -- before they organized the ghetto -- before they organized the\nghetto, they selected a Judenrat, you know, they selected each -- you know, that\u2019s their --\nthat\u2019s the system. And they didn\u2019t install the Judenrat, they told the Jews that you install\na Jewish council, that\u2019s a Judenrat, it\u2019s a Jewish council. Would represent -- represent a\ndifferent -- different branches. Now, if we need labor, there you\u2019re going to be, there\u2019s\nMinister -- you ha -- you\u2019d -- Minister of Labor, you\u2019re going to be Minister of Sanitation\nand Minister of -- of Police -- Jewish police. You got a -- you know, Jewish police to --\nyou know, in the Judenrat to keep order, the Jewish police for -- you had to keep the\norder, you know, there was some decrees for the Judenrat and if -- for no kind of\nbranches, you know what I mean and that\u2019s the way and so they would select -- they try\nto select among the Jews, which is a select well -- in the beginning they selected, it was a\na-attorney, a big attorney, Schreibman. All attorney -- well attorney, maybe we sho-\nshould select Schreibman. And they decided, well, we going to -- they decided to select\nha -- he was a big businessman, an educated -- yeah, so they -- It-Itsal Yanovitch. Very\nbig extra -- you know, respective -- respected Jew businessman, respected by the -- all\nthe community from the poor. You know, everybody, Poles and all that. And educated\nman, so he was the president and then there -- the important job was the -- very important",
        "A: -- ovitch. Very big extra -- you know, respective -- respected Jew, businessman,\nrespected by the -- all the community from the poor. You know, everybody, Poles and all\nthat. And educated man, so he was the president and then there -- the important job was\nthe -- very important job is that -- in charge of labor. Now, the Germans now, they\u2019re not\ngoing to pick this, you know, that\u2019s [indecipherable], so this was the Juden -- they picked\nthe Judenrat, which consisted of -- I think 1t was 22 people all together. Each one has his\nown job. And they told the Judenrat that we going to establish a ghetto in certain spots --\nyou know, they picked -- they say the spot is going to be usually they picks the spots, you\nknow, what is slum spots, not the -- not in the center. Yeah, and they gave you a certain -\n- certain -- 15 blocks or -- or so -- 20 block. The -- the -- the measurements exactly where\nthe Juderat is going to be and those Jews who lived in -- you know, have their own,\nstayed there. All the Jews living outside -- on outside the Juden ghetto, had to abandon\ntheir homes. Of course maw -- there was very few Gentiles living in the slums, there.\nThere was eve -- there was some -- they had to abandon -- they had to leave their homes.\nAnd so they were -- established the ghetto and it was -- you know, f-fenced, as all the\nghettos -- fenced in with ba-barb wire fenced in.",
        "A: The Jews had to f -- build themselves, they told us exactly the measurement, the plan.\nYou build it. We had to build it. We had to pay for -- our labor, of course. We build it, we\npaid for it, with all -- and --",
        "A: Well, I really -- I really didn\u2019t help build it. Th-That -- it -- 1t -- they had -- they had the --\nwhat you call it, ca -- c-carpenters, they had welders and they had -- I was too young, I\ndidn\u2019t participate in building that, no. You know, professionals, which it -- and\neverything. Well, we didn\u2019t have the machinery, everything would had to -- done by\nhand. And that\u2019s the -- all the outside Jews were put in the Judenrat and the\nBurgermeister came in in town. That\u2019s the mayor of the town and he had -- he had the --\nthe authority for the whole city. Includes already, I mean, his -- the Juden -- already the\nJudenrat and all that into -- beside the SS and the Gestapo and the other units. So, when\nthe Judenrat -- we had -- our house was in the ghetto, yeah, yeah. Our hou -- because it\u2019s\n-- it was the section there, somehow -- we had a big house, like it says, a pound way back\nin it, our house was still in the ghetto, so we remained -- we still remained in the ghetto. I\nmean, we remained in our house. And then, eventually the laws -- right away, laws went\nin that you have to -- of course you have to wear it -- that -- that you got to wear the\nyellow star -- yellow star on your chest, on the left side and the back, I think it\u2019s five\ninches -- you know each one, a child, everybody wear -- to wear the yellow star. And\neverybody had a little -- still -- ver -- food saved up and stored up for -- f-for little, you\nknow, for -- you were still be able befo -- able to go out before the Judenrat was\nestablished -- to deal with the farmers. You know, still free, but you still have the yellow\nband, you\u2019re still free if you had -- there was no money. If you had money, it was mostly\nbartering most of the time, you know, for the farmer. If you didn\u2019t have any money, so\nyou have a pair of shoes, they gave you -- gave you sa -- they gave you, for instance,\nsome vegetables, whatever or meat or -- or some butter or a little cheese or a suit or\n[indecipherable]. This was bar -- you know. This was -- you were -- what do you call it?\nBar -- Bar --",
        "A: Bar-Bartering.",
        "A: And -- because, yeah -- trading, because the ruble, under the Russian, the ruble was\nalready not for -- you know, change wasn\u2019t considered [indecipherable] at all. They\npreferred tradder -- the farmers -- they preferred tradder -- you want something, they\nwant something valuable. So -- but when that Judenrat was established, this was already -\n- rationing went in at -- to effect. They gave you so much -- so much bread. We didn\u2019t get\n-- we didn\u2019t get bread. We got flour. My uncle\u2019s mill supplied the flour for the Judenrat.\nYou know, we used to get flour. They figured out already, excess -- roughly how much\nflour -- 400 pounds, how much bread is going to come out. So it was -- I don\u2019t know, 25\ngrams or so much. 12 - fif - 25 grams of bread, then they rationing and so much little --\nmargarine for each family and little -- I think it -- they have -- it -- it was over here, what\nthey call it, like oh, Jello type, little Jello, if you want I should, yeah. And then, right\naway l-law went in. They requested from the Judenrat that you have to -- half a million\nrul -- there\u2019s some -- you know, you have some money -- rubles left, you know, from the\nRussians, rubles left -- half a million rubles and this was the -- you know, this was as\nfunction already from the police, make sure -- you know, 1-1f they knew that somebody --\nyou know, rich, poor, you know. So, somebody didn\u2019t want to -- didn\u2019t want to give the\npolice -- the Jewish police were forced, you know -- you got to give. Or somebody didn\u2019t\nbehave or somebody -- you know, the police f -- the police function was to keep order.\nWe had a lot of -- you know, there was a lot of stealing and -- and when you\u2019re hungry,\nyou know, you know something, you\u2019ll grab -- so it\u2019s got to be, you know, got to be\norder. So the p -- the function of police to keep order in the ghetto.",
        "A: No, we-well, the rubles, we gave some ru -- I don\u2019t know, it was a half a -- half -- it was a\nhalf a million rubles and it was about 10 kilogram of silver. It was the -- went effect right\naway and I think it\u2019s a kilogram of gold. So, each one, you know, in orders -- the\nJudenrat is -- their function is to make sure that getting from the Jews and each one had\nto -- you know, had to give -- you know, if you had a [indecipherable] something, yeah,\nso that -- and besides, any foreign foreigncy not allowed, you know, that\u2019s strict, they\nwere going to -- if they\u2019re going to catch you, you got caught with foreign currency, let\u2019s\nsay a dollar, you know, the death penalty. For no -- no radios. All the radios has to be\nconfiscated. Whoever had a radio, you could not --",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: They already had gon -- I mean, all the radios had to be confiscated. And all -- a Jew\ndidn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t -- weren\u2019t allowed to own a radio. You didn\u2019t wa-wa-weren\u2019t allowed\nto own a camera. You were -- they didn\u2019t allow to had Bell telephones. There was not too\nmany telephone, radios and any other -- we didn\u2019t have the -- had like here now, you\nknow, the television and VCR\u2019s and compasses -- I give you example, maps -- a map, a\ncompass, anything like that, yeah, was not allowed. And had to be turned over and this is\n-- this is -- the first laws went into effect. And so it was the Judenrat in general, in\nProushinna, you know, was -- did a good job. You know, they\u2019ve -- some complaints in\nsome other places, in other ghetto. They were -- they did a good job. As a matter of fact,\nthey -- it -- 1t -- they came later on, in 19 -- it was establish in 19 -- it\u2019s \u201841 -- 41, from\nsome other cities to learn the system the way, you know -- to learn the system the way we\nin the Proushinna ghetto operates. Now, eventually, in late 1941, that was established in\nJune, late f -- 1941, they brought in f -- Jews from little surrounding towns. Most of the\nlittle towns were liquidated for -- on the spot. You know, there was families, a little\nhamlet or village, with 20 - 50 - 100 families [indecipherable] you know, the SS, they --\nthey -- they killed them on the spot. I know a fact, it is not far from Proushinna, there was\n-- we didn\u2019t have the statio-station in Proushinna, we had to go -- it\u2019s about 10 kilometers\nto the railroad station. We had a little trolley station. If you want to travel, you had to\ntake the trolley and -- to Dalinavo, which is 10 kilometer and then there was a little town\n-- little village. There were about 25 families and in 19 -- in ni -- this was in -- right\naway, the first -- the first -- when they arrived, the first month, they killed them all out. In\none family, somehow one person from that family somehow escaped and came to our\nghetto. This was -- came to the ghetto. So, they -- yeah?\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: Yeah, well --",
        "A: -- 1s -- th-the ghetto was established in -- in August fir -- in August first. Now, that time\nalready, the Germans -- any part -- any di -- what you call it, like we had the\nBurgermeister, SS, yes and the -- the Gestapo and there was -- there was an airport and\nthere was some warehouses, so it was already a system established, when the Germans\nrequested, for instance, 500 people one place, 200 people here. So the Juden, you know,\nthey gave an order and the Judenrat supplied, sort of in the morning. And you know, they\nkept -- bookkeeping, you know, fair -- it means if I went today, somebody else will go\ntomorrow. Now, if I like -- if -- if I like the place where I was sent and they gave you,\nyou know, some places -- they treat you -- they gave you a s -- sometimes a s -- extra\npiece of bread or something -- little margarine or something. So you were willing to go\nand work there and I don\u2019t mind going to work there another day. But there was some\nplaces where -- where you -- they and -- there was a -- a Leaman -- a Leaman commando,\nwhich they were in charge of the communication line and telegram and te-telegraph,\ntelegram poles and they were rough people there, where -- you know, nobody wanted to\ngo and work there, because they beat -- you went there and you know, they told you what\nto do and decided they were unsatisfied, they -- you know, they were beating you up and\nkicking you for no other reason. So, you say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not -- you\u2019re sending me back to\nLeaman brothers? I went there yesterday, I don\u2019t want to go there,\u201d you know. So it\ndepends. So each -- each gr-group from the Germans, they requested some people and it -\n- they were fair. They kept somehow a list and -- and you did for -- went to all kind of\ndifferent work. Especially it was winter, you know, wintertime the airport, which so big.\nOn the airport you had to go -- now, they could have -- I mean they could have af-afford\nand -- and clean the airport miles for the runways with -- with snow plows and\nbulldozers, whatever. So the airport, thousands -- 2000, with the shovel -- we had to have\nshovels and wheelbarrows, so you know, that\u2019s cheap labor. So we had --",
        "A: Well, you know, we get in -- we get in -- that\u2019s in Bellarouse, in the part of Poland, a\nawful lot of snow and cold -- winter cold and snow, so you had to clean the -- you know\nand the snow, in that wheelbarrow with the -- for tu -- with the shovel and there was\ncertain spot where you dumped it, you know, half a mile away and -- and they had cheap\nlabor. So this was wintertime that lasted -- you know, had long winters, sometime for\nthree, four, five months. And I was working -- everybody was working in the airport.\nAnd besides, you were sent some -- for instance, to work in the woods, to chop for the\nGermans. They did -- that\u2019s the same thing, they had to -- th-th-that\u2019s the only source of -\n- of cooking and so -- and heating sys -- heating. And so you had to go -- be requested,\nfor instance, a group of a few hundred people to go in the woods. Now, we were\nfortunate, we had woods near -- about 25 kilometers, actually -- the nearest part, we had\nlot of forest. So, they were sending in groups to the forest and sometimes for -- you had\nto stay there a week, you know, because it takes 20 -- no, it takes a long time til you go\nthere. So -- they supplied you -- the Judenrat, with certain rationing and you had to go\nthere and chop wood, cut logs, chop wood and then bring it back to the ghetto and for\nthat -- for the -- outside the ghetto population. So, this type of work. And -- and any -- I\nmean, there is -- there -- there was no labor -- it was no machinery which they had, no\nmachinery. You know they -- they used cheap labor -- machinery. Especi -- for instance,\nnow, they didn\u2019t like it -- the Germans were complaining. They said th-that they -- you\nknow, when they marched in and if -- we didn\u2019t have the roads like over here paved,\nsarek -- so they were complaining dowse dumb, foolish Polish, they -- and over -- it was\nmuddy, you know, they were go-going through the tanks and the -- you know, through\nthe roads, they made holes and they made a -- it was -- it was a -- a ma -- I mean it was a\nlot of mud and all that. He says, \u201cThey -- that -- look at the roads they have,\u201d they didn\u2019t\nlike the roads. Build them roads. So, we had to -- it was a -- a -- a caroda, that\u2019s a big job,\nalways crush stones. You know, with a sledgehammer -- you know, big stones, crush\nstones in order to fix the roads. So this is -- this is all the time, hundreds of -- you know,\nwhich is -- it was hard work and how did you get -- you know, from big stones, you had\nto crush the stones til you -- you know, you crush them to s-small and that\u2019s the way it --\nin roads and then you filled in the roads. They call it gravel here, like crushed -- you\nknow, they -- when you buy, you know, want it crush or gravel if you want stones graded\nup some -- some lots over here you see sometimes here. So this type of work -- all -- all\nkind of work -- all kind of work.",
        "A: Well, a-as a rule, when there was a group, yeah there were -- of course there were\nGermans, a few German, they would supervise you, yes. They were with dogs, supervise\nyou.

The Germans didn\u2019t -- when the Judenrat was established, the Germans didn\u2019t\nwent in in the ghetto too often. See?

We\nneed money here, we need always money and in the beginning, see, they could be bribed\na little. The Burgermeister, even the SS, they could be bribed. They knew, you know,\nthey mer -- you know, that they were looking for something. If they can get, they going\nto that. For instance, we had some selections wintertime in the ghetto. You know, they\nwant to make sure -- do -- a do -- about the rationing exactly. If somebody dies -- many\npeople or somebody gets born. So, they call that a selection. You had to go out and make\nsure, check exactly if it\u2019s -- the number\u2019s right or not right. But they really didn\u2019t know\nthe number and they didn\u2019t care.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I understand your question --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, see, in general they did -- the Judenrat were fair in Proushinna. There were some\ncomplaints, you know what I mean. There\u2019s always certain complaint. But as a rule, on\nthe average, there were -- they were trying -- they were trying the best. Now, they were\nagainst organizing or something, you know, they didn\u2019t allow that. They were\nresponsible, you know what I mean? They -- you know, if they didn\u2019t know in the\nbeginning, but eventually, when it came out, you know, later on, when it\u2019s got -- wh-what\nI come to, the 19 -- in the 1942, I know when they start already organizing. So they were\nof course against that, because they were responsible. First of all, they were responsible\nfor the population of the ghetto and they were the first one we sacrificed. So, you know,\nyou -- I don\u2019t know, you can blame him or you\u2019re not -- you know what I mean? It\u2019s a\ntough situation byegot, tough. Don\u2019t forget that -- to that -- 1t was reprisals, it\u2019s not like in\nnormal times you get somebody or you get a -- you [indecipherable] a partisan, or a\nrevolt or somebody -- instigator, you know, they take revenge. If the Germans find out --\nfor instance, if I did something or I\u2019m doing something or I\u2019m preparing for something,\nyou know, not only -- you know they were, oh my family, my -- you know, they would\nget, oh my family and my ga -- uncles and -- and nieces and nephews and who knows\nhow many, you know, responsible. It\u2019s -- so it was -- it was at -- yeah, it was risky. It was\nrisky.",
        "A: It\u2019s very, very risky. You know, you didn\u2019t want to have on your conscience, that you\nknow, you did something on account you saw and the same thing, the Judenrat had a\nproblem. The same, they didn\u2019t want to -- yeah. But they didn\u2019t know -- they didn\u2019t\nknow, they didn\u2019t allow. They lest eventually when they did discovered, late -- in the 19 -\n- late 1942, part of it, it was already too late, you know. It was already too late. You\nknow, we had to -- you know, the way we -- the way you -- the -- the organization, we\nstarted it, had to be so secret, you know, you had to sa -- that you -- you -- even your own\nfamily didn\u2019t have to know what you\u2019re doing.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you, because I didn\u2019t -- I want to say that in 19 -- when they established the\nghetto in 1941, in -- in October -- now, in beginning 1942, they broke into Proushinna\nghetto from surrounding towns, from Ginefcare, from Narefkar, from Bielovairsh and\nKarminitz. Four cities and then from Bialystok, those were little cities. And what\nhappened, fortunately, you know, most of the little cities, you know, in 1941 or in 19,\nbeginning \u201842, they liquidated them, you know? They didn\u2019t bother even establishing a\nghetto. They liquidate them -- they -- they killed them on the spot or they took them out\nin the woods -- took them out in the woods and killed. And then, after -- after that, 1t was\nof course -- it -- 1t was too much of a -- they didn\u2019t have the power yet, the -- the -- the\nmanpower, it was a tall job. And -- so they start bringing 1n in Proushinna ghettos, of s-\nsome -- those that are fortunate and the ghetto swelled from about -- we had -- like is\nmentioned, 6000 Jews, 1000 from here, 2000 from here, so finally the ghetto swelled to\n12,000. And some -- some were brought in by trucks from Ginefcare. And some were\nmarched by foot for 80 -- you know, from -- especially from the Narefkar, the city and\nwe had to take in a family from there and they marched them. They marched them, you\nknow, the whole -- from, it\u2019s about, I would say maybe 16 -17 kilometers, can you\nimagine? So half -- what happened to the cripples, from the children and the -- and the\nwhat you call it? A lot of them you know, lost -- lost parents, air children. They couldn\u2019t\nma -- you know and those who couldn\u2019t make it, they shot them on the spot. And\neventually those who made it, brought them in in the ghetto. So we heard -- we heard\nfrom those people, we right there you know, we had to take in. You had a big house, we\ntake in some families, you know. Some says, you know, and they\u2019ve lost a father or lost a\n-- lost a little baby or lost a child, yeah. And then they brought in from Bialystok, it\u2019s a\nbig city, Bialystok, so they brought in 2000 from Bialystok in Proushinna, in our town.\nNow, I want to mention that Proushinna and the vicinity was enclosed in the Third Reich,\nthey call 1t, you know? They incorporated -- fer-favored the Third Reich, we going to be\ntreated a little better. Wa -- the reason they incorporated Proushinna in the Third Reich, 1s\nbecause we were near Bielovairsh and Bielovairsh a forest, were the famous forest in\nPoland. One of the biggest famous forests in Poland, that\u2019s about 60 or 70 kilometers\nfrom Proushinna. And there were famous for certain animals. And -- and Goering and all\nthe groups and -- and -- and -- and Himmler, they used to hunt there. That\u2019s the reason --\nthat\u2019s the reason they incorporated Proushinna and even Bialystok, the certain territory\nand they call it to the east, Prussia. Not to -- you know, greater Germany is Prussia. So\ncomparison with other ghettos, maybe we were treated a little bit in the beginning, better,\nbecause we didn\u2019t have those -- th-they call it aktiones -- actions. The German cou -- you\nknow, aktiones, like in other cities, they requested, let\u2019s see, right away, 1000 inslawnie\n2000 - 5000 action and they -- they took them out someplace in -- in certain, you know,\nravines and certain places right away and -- even 19 -- in -- in the beginning of the war,\nand they killed. So we didn\u2019t have that, we didn\u2019t have the actions, you know, like\n[indecipherable] hundred and except -- except it was -- you know, every once in awhile,\nevery day there was some casualties, you know we had -- you know, the -- when outsider\n-- some -- they took people off the stru -- 60 years old. So it means some -- some were\nmistreated and some couldn\u2019t make it, some were weak, so there was some casualties.\nWe had to bring them in in the ghetto. So we were told, you know, there is two or three,\nevery once in awhile I heard that they brought them in -- in -- in the ghetto and -- for\nburial. Now -- now that -- my -- what I want to mention is this, I had an uncle the one --\nthe one was -- yes, you know, associated in the -- for the farm. Now, we had a bakery in\nthe town -- in the -- in the ghetto. We weren\u2019t getting bread, we were getting flour. And\nwe were the bakery in the -- in -- in the ghetto and the fire -- the fire engine, you know,\nthe f -- the -- it was -- it\u2019s -- in the ghetto, we suppose we were in a fire, you know, the --\nthe -- we had to take care -- the fire station was in -- the same -- already was -- it was\nstationed in -- in Proushinna ghetto and with a -- with a hospital in Proushinna ghetto. So,\nyeah, we had to speak in my -- my uncle, so he f -- like -- was a farmer and we had some\n-- a fleet of horses and wagons to -- any time the German requested, for instance, if you\nhave to take down 50 people to the forest or 100 people to forest. So they told us, they\nwere -- they were the truckers, we didn\u2019t have no truck, they were -- truck had taken the\npeople down the forest and see, my uncle was killed. They -- they -- what do you call it?\nThe experiments with dogs, yeah. He was torn by dogs.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Well, the experiments with dogs are -- one dog -- how long 1s going to take -- how long 1s\ngoing to take dogs to kill a person. You understand? Ah. You know, th-th-they\nexperiment, they wanted -- they wanted to know how long 1s going to take one dog or\ntwo dogs, finally, yeah. So, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a -- that -- that happened. That made a big\nimpression on me.",
        "A: Well, this happened in 1942, this and then -- see, we had so many brought in in that\nghetto, escapees. Like I mention, they brought some in from different towns. And then\nthey used to pick some -- find some Jews from the outside -- for instance, and somebody\nsurvived and they used to drop him in in the ghetto. So, you know, we heard all this -- all\nkind of stories, so I was wondering, you know, they could have killed them, now why did\nthey brought them in in the ghetto? Some work -- he was telling us that he survived\nsomehow, I know some way and from the little village and he was wandering and they\ncaught him and they put -- the Germans caught him and drop him in into the ghetto. So, it\n-- it mean -- it, you know, it reached your mind that understanding there is -- there is\nsomething -- you know, it\u2019s a matter of time. Now, why did they have to bring in -- I was\no figure, why did they have to bring 1n those escapees, those -- those survivors? They\ncould have killed them, they dropped them in the -- you know, many -- they dropped him\nin in the ghetto. We hear -- we heard all kind of atrocities with -- you know, leaving a trai\n-- you know, leaving witnesses. So we understood that\u2019s -- you know, there\u2019s a matter of\ntime, you know, it\u2019s a matter of time. And -- and fortunately, when -- you know, in -- the\n-- when the group was established, many -- there\u2019s a lot of -- from the group, worked in\ndifferent kind of places. One from our group worked in the woods, sent to cut fo -- for --\nyou know, for a week and he was work and they left -- you know, they stayed there in the\nwoods for a week and at night Russian couple -- couple -- Russian partisans came over.\nAnd the Germans slept already there. They came over and they says, \u201cWell, if you going\nto get some arms, we\u2019ll take you in.\u201d They were -- it wasn\u2019t organized yet. You know, it\nwas -- it was independent groups, I call it, you know it -- it was still -- you\u2019ve -- you\u2019 ve --\nyou could find in the woods that time, criminals. You can find escapees from -- pr-\nprisoners, Russian prisoners, [indecipherable] you know, they went in in the woods. They\nhad the ammunition instead of getting, you n -- take a big -- taken in prison. And they --\nthere was all, you know, and -- and there was some -- for instance, farmers for the boys.\nThe older people -- the older, they didn\u2019t take. If a farmer had couple boys, especially\nboys, they used to take them to work in Germany, to work on the German farms, because\nyou know, they needed help. All Germany [indecipherable] all -- they can use all the --\nall the -- all the men -- all the men they could. So they can get cheap labor, so they tried\nfarmers, get the -- get those farmer\u2019s boys to shf -- go to Germany. Now, they didn\u2019t want\nto go and they knew the territory, see? Thes -- they went in in the woods. And -- and they\nstayed in -- you know, sometimes in the night they\u20191l go back to their parents and find\nout. So -- so there was all kind of groups there in the woods and this is the first -- the first\nfriend we met at two -- a Russian -- they were Russian Bitar, so they said, \u201cWell, try and\nget some arms, or get some money and maybe we can, you know, if you get some ar --\nmoney we can -- we\u2019ll take you in some.\u201d But, you know, one of the -- the -- from the --\nthe man from our group was responsive for this man. He was responsible for this man I\nmean, actually one or two or three could have -- could have -- they would have taken it.\nYou know they would -- they would accept two or three, three or few, not ag -- not 50 or\n100. But you know, he wouldn\u2019t -- you we -- were responsible were sent for the Judenrat\nand -- and if you don\u2019t come, you were accounted for the people. Now, if you\u2019Il come\nwith three less, what happened to the other three? You know, it wa -- it -- you know, it\nwas -- y-you had the moral responsibility.",
        "A: Well, right then, well, I wasn\u2019t there, but I mean, I could -- if I were there --",
        "A: Yeah, so, that\u2019s -- oh, there\u2019s some partisan in the meantime in the woods. so we started -\n- you know, to get organized and try and get some arm and ammunition. In the meantime,\nwe know there\u2019s some, you know, in the woods. It\u2019s -- this 1s far away actually, this isn\u2019t\navail -- over here. Y-You know, this 1s about 50 kilometers. And so the youths, in\ngeneral, got thats understanding already, you know, because you don\u2019t believe, you\nknow, the human nature. You still believe maybe you -- I mean, you have figured -- it\u2019s -\n- maybe you\u2019re going to -- the time will come, maybe the war will be over and maybe\nsomething is go -- going to happen, yeah, a miracle\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re not going\nto have any miracle. It was a panic already in the ghetto in 1942, we heard about all the\nliquidations from the cities, and from the -- from other parts, from little towns and they\nwere bringing them 1n in the ghetto and leaving witnesses, so we knew what\u2019s was going\non and all. So they -- every -- every -- you know, a realization that you might know.\nThere\u2019s something, you know, there is -- there is -- tricky, we have to -- we have to do\nsomething, we have to get organized and -- and we not going to go -- we not -- you know\n-- when it comes for -- if and when it comes the time, we not going to go. Worst if -- even\nif we not going to get out, we figured we going to even burn up the ghetto or do\nsomething. I mean, even if you, you know, burn up, let\u2019s -- anybody, whatever ca -- can\nescape, can escape, wor -- worse scenario. So, y -- whoever\u2019s can escape -- they knew\nalready in the ghetto, their -- it -- it co -- you know, when the group was established, now\n-- later on, when we got established, so it was a problem to get -- how you get arm and\nammunition. Besi -- yeah?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, yeah. We had -- we had a -- we had a m-meetings -- we used to had a meeting\nand each, you know, from the group, each one worked in different kind of locations and\none of our group worked in the warehouses where there were -- you know, there was 50\nor 100 people working there, or one or two people from our group worked in the\nwarehouses, where was the Russian leftover. And there was ammunition, they were cr --\nyou know, sorting and crating, to ship it to Germany. And so it was a plan that time when\nwe\u2019re -- how to -- you could -- you know, you -- you could s-steal sometimes. It\u2019s -- it\nwas easy to hide or something, but the problem is how you going to get in in the ghetto,\nyou know? You could have -- it -- it was -- wouldn\u2019t be a problem to leave it outside a\nghetto. Very easy, because they were working outside the ghetto, you could have buried\nsomeplace. But it\u2019s -- 1t wouldn\u2019t be used, you know, how you going to get to it? You\nknow, the important thing is to have it with you in the ghetto, you know? The -- the --\nyou know, the arm -- ammunition or whatever. So this was a problem, because the ghetto\nwas -- you know, like I mentioned, was surrounded and it was patrolled all the time with\n-- with police and they had the -- for dogs, Germans and collaborators. We had the -- we\nhad the Lithuanians in Poland, too. And it was pretty strict, you know. You couldn\u2019t get\nout. In order, you know, it was you -- you were -- you were locked in. No communication\nwith the outside at all. No [indecipherable] men and you know, not far -- what I\nmentioned one still living in h-homes, at 60 colone. We didn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t send any\nletters, we couldn\u2019t communicate, we couldn\u2019t travel, we couldn\u2019t go out. So, we had\nsome people working there in the ammunitions. We had some people working in the\nwoods, cutting the woods and we had some people -- we had a engineer. We had a secret\nradio -- a engineer, which he fixed up. We had a f -- secret radio, which we can listen for\nthe outside world and you know, and you still worried whofer organized, a little bit. But\nmostly we used -- we used to get the news from the papers, from the German papers.\nThey -- I mean yid -- they let you have a paper, for you can not read it anyway or\nsomething. So whatever, you know, we -- so we knew a little situation what\u2019s going on\non the front, how far they are, yeah, how far they are, yeah. But it was a secret radio, so\nwe knew a little, we\u2019d from -- from the public -- Br-British public broadcasting.",
        "A: Yeah, so we -- we knew from both sides. So that\u2019s the way the group started at. And --",
        "A: It was actually -- the group was 18 and three women is 21, and 10 is 31. 10 from our\ngroup was out -- they had co-contact already, s -- in -- in another part, the adkund. This\nwas -- what I mentioned they worked chopping the wood. Now, this was far away. Now,\nthe nearest part from -- from Proushinna was 30 kilometers, the nearest wood. This 1s\nalready the -- the -- they call that the trouknavitch, that\u2019s a mosher forest. Now, we got in\nki -- a couple partisans got in contact with our group and they used to come in -- the\ngroup -- our group already had a secret tunnel, I didn\u2019t even know where it was. Only\ncertain -- you know, I -- I know there 1s -- there 1s a se -- a secret tunnel going in and out\nof the ghetto. So, we s -- two part-partisans -- Russian partisans, they used to come in in\nthe ghetto and be in contact with our group. And they -- the same, they told us to get\norganized and try and get some ammunition or money. I mean they figured money, they\ncan buy it. It was not -- you know, that -- it was still independent groups, it was not -- no\norganization at all, it was the rule of the jungle yet. So you figured, get some money, you\nsee? So they -- eventually 10 people from our group, left in Septem -- October, four\nmonths before the liquida -- in October, they left already in the woods. And they learned\na little from those couple partisans, you know, from the Russians, how to make a bunker,\nhow to live, you know, live in the woods. So they stayed there and quite often they used\nto warn -- a few of them used to come back here and in the ghetto, we had contact with\nthem -- used to come in, I still didn\u2019t know how they went in through the secret tunnel.\nAnd that\u2019s the way we had -- we had th -- th -- we used to communicate with each other.",
        "A: It\u2019s very secret.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s a ga -- it\u2019s ver -- 1t\u2019s yeah, it\u2019s very secret, very secret and that\u2019s -- nobody\nknew about it. It was so secret and so confidential, that you know that your own parents\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on. Because you -- you didn\u2019t want to -- you didn\u2019t want to -\n- what you call it -- tell even your parents, they wouldn\u2019t sleep nights, you know what I\nmean? They wouldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if they would object or not object, but you -- you\njust -- you just couldn\u2019t do it, yo-you know what I mean? In case it is -- it had to be so\nsecret that -- in -- nobody -- nobody -- nobody knew about this group, about our group.",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t -- we really -- we -- we really didn\u2019t swear an o-oath, but we -- you\nknow, we cooperated. We knew there was some -- you know, there was some\ncooperation between our group. See, my brother was little older and he was more\ninstrumental -- I\u2019m going to go -- this is later on, I would imagine, that -- so that\u2019s the\nway the group was established. So the 10 were there and we were working -- the 18.\nNow, there was some other groups, we didn\u2019t know about them. We not -- were not the\nexceptional, no, there was some other groups. You think there are -- you know, we\nthought we -- we di -- we thought we maybe were the only ones, but there was some\ngroups, eventually we met them -- a gr -- another group, we met them in the woods. So, it\nwas very secret.",
        "A: Oh, we knew exactly, I mean, knew exactly.",
        "A: Each one knew exactly..",
        "A: Yeah, we used to get together and this group, the 18, our group, we had our own bunker,\ntunnel built. In case -- but we didn\u2019t have time yet to -- it was -- we found a spot\nsomehow near the border where you can get out. There was some farmland and barns.\nIt\u2019s easy to -- you know, easy to get -- easy to escape in case emergency.",
        "A: Well, yeah. We were trying -- we were -- actually, we knew that we were going to get --\nescape. We knew that we\u2019re going to either escape, if -- 1f not escape -- the 10 are already\nout. Now, we were left to organize some more, you know, til y-y -- it still, 1t -- it -- it -- in\nthe beginning it wasn\u2019t 18, it was si -- 10, then 12 and then you know, it wa -- another\none because we needed -- we needed a -- a -- a carpenter, because in order to smuggle in\nthe -- the rifles, many times it\u2019s too long, we had to break it in half, break the wood off in\norder to, you know, in order to smuggle in, this is too big and too long. So we needed a\ncarpenter in order to fix -- fix the rifle up, yeah.

And they knew the territory\nexactly, you know. They used to buy logs and ta -- take 1t down to the sawmill -- we had\na sawmill, too in Syracuse -- industry. So, they knew the be -- territory a little there, so\nthey --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Oh we -- yeah, we had a sa --",
        "A: There was a sawmill in Proushinna, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. So we took now -- and they were cousins to the one from the -- the 10 who left in\nthe woods, it was my Bitar commander. He was the first one organizing, you know, th-\nthe 10. And his name was Barro Sagell -- Barro Sagell. So, mostly I would say there\u2019s a\nlot of -- majority is -- 1s from Bitar, would say half of the group is from Bitar. Now, he va\n-- he is the first one that -- from the 10, he left his younger brother, then 1t went in the ya\n-- [indecipherable] saloontashur with his wife, he took his wife and he was a mechanic\nwhere he -- he belonged to the group and then it was a -- a britebar five, 10 and it was\ntwo from Bialystok. And th-those from the 10, quite often used to come down in -- wa --\nlike I mention, in the ghetto and we used to have contact with them.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know, no. You see, I -- like I -- I mentioned to you before, my father was\npessimist a little. Now, now, by ra -- by wanting -- geographically, maybe he was right.\nNo, he was a educated man, you know, he drew a map, never forget. He drew a map and\nhe says, \u201cBoys.\u201d We were ta -- no, we were talking some, we was talking about -- th-they\ndidn\u2019t know the -- you know, that we are organized, what we should do or something like\nthat. We, well -- planning, wer -- you know, saying some and w-we going to escape, no,\nwe going to do something. H-H-He knew, but he didn\u2019t know about the group -- he knew\nthere -- because he drew a map and he says, \u201cBoys, look, here is Poland.\u201d And then he\ndrew, you know, you got Czechoslovakia, he knew exactly all the -- Europe. He says,\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a single country -- neutral country. You got Sweden and Switzerland.\nNow, all Europe was already taken. Now, let\u2019s -- even if you\u2019ll get out the ghetto,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cyou got such a long way to go and you going to be ca-caught,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\nknow, you get a caught by the -- bun -- by the certain groups, let\u2019s see, unfriendly\nGentiles, he\u2019ll -- he\u2019ll give you out,\u201d because it was a prize, you know, to catching a Jew,\ntwo kilograms of sugar. That\u2019s all. If -- you know, if you find a Jew hiding or if you find\nsomebody and you deliver him to the Germans, you\u2019ll get two kilogram of sugar. And\nsome went for that. Sugar was, you know, a luxury, two kilogram of sugar. So he says, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t,\u201d-- it\u2019s a lost cause to him. He says it\u2019s a lost cause, yeah. So he didn\u2019t vel -- you\nknow, he disco -- he well, I don\u2019t know, he -- bara -- one thing he was right. He didn\u2019t\nknow we had connection with Bitar. He didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t tell him that already and\nlater on the connection, and all this. So he\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know to say if it was right or not\nright, who knows? I mean that -- geographically he was -- he was right, because it was --\nyou know, it\u2019s near, if you have a border, you could have even get out. But he didn\u2019t\nrealize, you know, if we did know there is some woods, partisans, we don\u2019t have to go.\nNow, if we wouldn\u2019t have the woods near, you know, it\u2019d be a problem, you know. Oh,\nyou know, if some -- from Warsaw, other cities, from Lodz, where they going to go? You\nsee, they fought, you know, in Warsaw ghetto. They -- you know, those -- those -- the\nresistant lasted for month. For month they resisted, it\u2019s longer than -- longer -- longer\nthan the -- than the -- the -- than French [indecipherable], French capitulated in -- what is\nit, in 10 - 12 days.",
        "A: No. Because, you see what happened is, now we had to -- it was emergency already. We\ndidn\u2019t expect that. It came an order in -- in -- it was ninete -- in -- in 1943, in January s --\nthe 27 it started. Sometimes a -- the 26th, came an order that -- you know, they gave it\nthe Judenrat that the Jews from Proushinna are going to be deported. They didn\u2019t say\nwhere they\u2019re going to be deported to Saleesia -- Salessia, a part of Poland and you\u2019re\ngoing to be working -- because I -- I didn\u2019t escape the first -- you know, I -- I remember\nthe first night and the men were going to be working, y-you know, nothing\u2019s going to\nhappen to them and bitechis and what are you going to do the -- and the women -- and the\n-- all the women and the children are going to be near there, all kind of baloney. Who in\nthe hell you going to fool, I mean. So we got already caught, we could have -- you know,\nwe didn\u2019t expect the date exactly, we could have gone out before. See, we could have\ngone out before -- they said, you know, either through the tunnel, or we could have cut\nthe wire, the same thing or we cut the -- break the fence, cut the wire, what we did, yeah.\nSo -- so it -- when it came out the -- they announced it -- the liquidation that time. We\nwere trying to break through, our crew. And we were followed by a mob. It was six\no\u2019clock, you know, it was still light. And you know, the -- the ghetto was so packed,\neverybody\u2019s on the street and they see you. And, you know, everybody see you,\neverybody follows you and they figured maybe they going to go through with us. And it\nwas imposs -- I mean, they would have -- we couldn\u2019t take a chance, because it would be\na lost cause. The Germans -- the Germans, you know, the patrol would have discovered\nit. So -- I mean, such a mob. So we decided we going to -- we went back to a -- where the\nbunker, we sit out in the bunker -- with a bunker -- and we tried for the second night. But\nalready it -- in the town, already they heard, they knew, you know, the group there,\nmumb boys -- there\u2019s the group exists. It was already going around in the ghetto, so the\nGermans probably knew -- know there is part of th-the -- you know the -- there\u2019s a group.\nSo we hopes they\u2019re -- the -- they -- they were saying wa -- you know, I discovered that\nwhen I was liberated, you know, some of them ca -- some of them -- I didn\u2019t even know\nthey were sent to Auschwitz when we escaped. We didn\u2019t know where we were going,\nsee? And so they -- s-some girls were saying I hope, you know the group survives it. And\nmaybe they going to have witnesses telling, you know, the story or whatever. So, the\nsecond night, we decided we going to fight through, break through, whatever happens. I\nmean, it\u2019s already -- so we still -- we still -- if w-we had maybe about 50 people followed\nus in our group. Some went through with us. Older people, older men with children. They\nwent through. Finally, you know, they -- they -- yeah, th-they discovered -- they did dis --\nyou know, eventually, they -- the guard went by and discovered that -- you know, it is a\nmab something went through. And we f -- we -- we picked a place, exact -- you know, we\npicked a place where to go through, so we\u2019ll be near the Christian side where there 1s\nsome -- not homes, but _ f-f-farmland mostly with -- with barns, big barns and hay piles\naround, so you can -- you can sneak it in and as long you get out, you know. So you have\n-- SO you can -- you can take off.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Yeah. Okay, now there were some ways of getting in the f -- arms in the ghetto through a\nsecret -- the only way is the secret tunnel, like the first -- the first 10, they cu -- they\nwent in and they went out. So they could, you know, you could have send it out with\nthem, a rifle, or bring it in, but in a -- in a bigger form [indecipherable] form, you know,\nit was a problem. Because every time you entered the ghetto by the gate, you were\nsearched. All the time. You were searched completely. You know, maybe you have s-\nsome -- it depends on the guard. Certain guard, if he\u2019ll find you carry a little extra bread,\nso he didn\u2019t mind. And if it\u2019s another guard, he\u2019|l stop you for -- you know, if you\nworked in certain place and they gave you a little extra piece of bread or something else,\nhe\u2019 ll let you in. You know, they search you pretty -- pretty thorough. And it was -- it was\ntough. Very stri -- t-tough to bring in arms and that. So you had to, 1n order -- in order to\nbring in a substantial amount -- a big amount and to increase the group, you had to f --\nhave a certain plan, a certain plan. So -- see, my brother was assigned, like I mentioned\nbefore, to work for the Burgermeister, actually for the wife. So, around the house,\nchopping wood and cleaning and sh -- the Burgermeister\u2019s wife was a -- what you call it?\nI would call her a soft -- nice, soft woman. And she f -- and she felt little sorry\nsometimes, so she\u2019ll give my brother a little extra sometime, to bring it to the family. And\nSO we used, you know, the occasion on that, so figure -- one time he asked her, he said\nthe mother is sick and you -- you know, and it\u2019s cold in the house, if you can have certain\namount of -- he was chopping wood for them, plenty of wood anyway and -- and if he\ncan take some home. Now, in order to -- how you going to bring it home? So he says,\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to get a sled.\u201d And so she agreed and the Burgermeister didn\u2019t\nobject. So we had to build, you know, we had to, you know, it\u2019s not a sled with a ho --\nwith a horse pulling sled. It was a big sled anyway and like I say, we had a carpenter, so\nwe had to fix it up deep enough, make sure it\u2019s got a good bottom, so you can put a good\n-- quite a few -- quite a few rifles. Now, on the ammunition is where it was easy\nsometimes --",
        "A: A double --",
        "A: It was a big sled, with a false back, enclosed, so and shou -- hollowed back. So, it\u2019s big\nenough in the sled, for instance to pu -- to -- two or three people to go in and hide. You --\nspace enough. So we\u2019d -- and having those already the group -- boys, ha -- stealing and\nhiding, laying outside the warehouses, which 1s not far from the airport and it was not far\nreally, from the Burgermeister. Now, he had -- working for the -- for the Burgermeister,\nhe was outside a ghetto, so he had a -- he had a -- a -- a paper, what you call it? A -- a\ncard, so he know -- with his picture, so he could move. Sometimes she\u2019!l send him there -\n- so he could move himself already outside. Once in awhi -- not all the time, once in\nawhile. So, it was made the plan, that -- that is to the sled and he went to the -- you know,\nnear -- near that contraband where it was -- where it was hidden. And there was couple,\nthe ca -- from our group -- the couple guys, they had to [indecipherable] quick and load\nit, filled it up with that -- with the ammunition that time. You had a lot of hand grenades,\nespecially they had type -- the Russian type ha -- hand grenades. It\u2019s a small and this was\nvery important. Yeah, you know, the hand grenades. It\u2019s light and -- and you can do a lot\nof damage with that. It\u2019s more than a rifle, we had a lot of this and -- and we had a -- a\nmach -- a machine gun. I know that was -- you know, you know, you -- can you imagine\nwith a machine gun? Machine gun -- how you going to smuggle in a machine gun? And\nseven ri -- I think it was seven rifles and a machine gun and three automatic rifles and a\nlot of ammunition. And brought it to the Burgermeister and loaded up the wood on top of\nthat and he had to s -- he -- he -- somehow he had -- he\u2019s -- he is -- his assistant, whoever\n-- the chauffeur, you know -- you know, the bigger wintertime, say wintertime, he had a\ncar, but wintertime he had a beautiful pair of horses and a sled, you know those -- you see\nit on the movies sometime. Oh, what a beautiful sled and horses and taking them down,\nwintertime to the ghetto, back and forth. And drive the car and the same thing, the SS,\nthey had horses. So, he brought it back to the Burgermeister and he loaded up the -- and\none of that -- she persuaded one of the chauffeurs to attach to the s -- to the sled with the\nhorses and I was waiting already outside the -- inside the ghetto and here, you know, he\nhad me in leftero for the Burgermeister, they know sled 1s coming, deal with that, it\u2019s\nlegal. I took it right in -- into -- I took it right in. This was the time already, we lost -- our\nhouse was outside the ghetto. We had to move out or move to my aunt. We stayed with\nthis one -- with the -- the widow, the one -- that one a -- the one lost, you know, the\nhusband. What I mentioned was killed by the dogs. That\u2019s my aunt we moved in. We\nmoved in with her and she had four children, four girls and we were four children, eight.\nAnd we stayed there already and we saw -- I brought 1n the sled and they were, you\nknow, that time mother and the -- and the \u201cOh, good,\u201d you know, \u201cwood. Oh good,\ngood.\u201d But you know, I had to f -- had to find a place for to -- to -- to hide that and they\nhad -- and they -- they had, where they stayed, they had a little barn down there anyways,\nso that\u2019s the way, eventually, was hidden there, and --",
        "A: In the barn was, yeah -- I had to take it in and they didn\u2019t have to -- no one in my family,\nthey didn\u2019t know. Nobody knew about it. Nobody knew about it, not even the -- not even\nthe other groups, you know, they knew they wouldn\u2019t know. I knew where it -- where I\nput it. I knew where to hide it. And eventually we used that.",
        "A: Afraid for -- in the ghetto?",
        "A: Who, who?",
        "A: Oh, oh, well, n -- it seems to me that time, it was -- we were pretty sure, if -- pretty sure if\n-- it\u2019s always a risk, but I mean, 1-1f was permission given and she gave -- the wife gave\npermission -- if you say the husband knew, because she had to tell the husband, you\nknow, tell -- husband had to tell the chauffeur, she didn\u2019t have much to -- much to sa --\nyou know, to sa -- have to say -- have the authority to tell him. Yeah, the Burgermeister\ncan tell that -- the chauffeur or -- or -- ta -- to do that. N-N -- Well, it was risk -- it was a\nrisk, but w-we\u2019re sure that we\u2019re going to -- this -- I think we\u2019re going to make it. We\u2019re\nsure we\u2019re going to make it. As -- as -- as -- as long -- as long they going to stop it at the\ngate and then -- so they see it\u2019s wood, or something like that. It was a risk. It\u2019s a\nhistorical risk. It just -- you know, it\u2019s just a mazel, that\u2019s all. I mean, it\u2019s a --",
        "A: They say Yiddish mazel -- mazel, luck. Who knows, call it -- either -- either call it luck\nor call it -- I just -- grace of God -- I don\u2019t know, the word just to use for that[inaudible].\nSo this -- this helped us and we had silver and we escaped the second night. We --",
        "A: The plan was, that time, on the second night, that we going to t-try and break through in\nthat spot there -- where we picked out a spot near -- it\u2019s already the farmhouses there and\n-- and we\u2019ll cut, you know -- you know, we\u2019ll cut the wire and we\u2019ll go through. And in\ncase we not going to er -- what -- in case we have to -- dis -- we\u2019ll be discovered, so we\u2019ll\nfight through. I mean, we\u2019ll fight through. There\u2019s no other chance. So it means, okay,\nwhatever will go through, will through. I mean, they patrolled a few -- we\u2019ll fight\nthrough, whatever -- we\u2019ll go through there. We\u2019ll go through -- we lost -- we lost three\nmen. You know, diff -- and like I said, a mob followed. Even though a mob followed us,\nabout maybe 50, but I think 30 went through with us. You know, some survived. Older\npeople, they survived.",
        "A: Oh, this was -- oh this, they are -- that time -- the arms -- this was a -- about four -- three\nmonths before -- it was in a long -- three months before. Then we had to stri -- we\ndistributed the arms. This wasn\u2019t -- this -- th-the night before -- way before. This was\nabout three -- this was like I\u2019m saying three or four months before, when we were --\ndecided, you know, the you decided that we going to -- that -- that we\u2019re going to do\nsomething. We had already f -- 10 men in the woods and that\u2019s all we are left 1s to -- just\nto organize and get arms. You know, get to -- get more organize -- more important was to\nget the arms, because we were told the -- the few partisans, it says we can not accept you\ntil you\u2019ll get arms. Or if -- arms or money. Maybe they going to -- the money -- th -- I --\nthe understanding, I figure they would -- they wouldn\u2019t -- they would take the money.\nThose -- those time it was in the -- on the -- underground movement wasn\u2019t organized\nyet.

Now, if you want to know it, my father, will have to tell you\nexactly what happened my father. You want that? Yeah. Now, in -- this was 19 --\nJanuary, 1943, October. October, 1942, we got the same -- an order fr-from the SS to the\nJudenrat to be ready, you\u2019re going to be taken to exp -- on transport.

And this\ndoctor, I s -- I imagine, the Jewish doctor, she belonged to the Judenrat and she supplied\npills for that -- you know, she had pills.

Only\ntwo died. See, my father committed suicide. This -- this is the same night. See, he knew\nwhat was going on with the Judenrat, but he -- see, he hanged himself.

I don\u2019t know it. I think it was the third. You\nknow, they transported -- four days took that to transport the ta -- 12,000 Jews. They\nprobably didn\u2019t have the -- the -- you know, f -- wagons and you know. So it was 3000.\nThey divide it when it came, yeah -- this is January the third, 20\u2019s -- 28 - 29 -- the 30th.\nNo, it\u2019s 27 - 28 - 29 and 30th, so -- so it was divided the city on four sections and they\nsays east side, each day 3000 and now it was prepared, you know, you have to go to the\nstation, we don\u2019t have a station [indecipherable]10 miles. So farmers were already lined\nup for miles inside the ghetto and outside the ghetto. It came the order that you got to be,\neight o\u2019clock in the morning, to be ready, that\u2019s all is allowed to take a backpack, certain\namount. It says, each one take a backpack. So it means get your better, whatever, because\nyou didn\u2019t see the backpack anyway any more. So they prepare you to take the backpack,\nso you -- of course you put it in, most of your better belongings, or -- you know what I\nmean? And be ready and at farmer\u2019s market, and -- and y-you going to be sent to Salesia,\nlike amerasion to work. Nothing about -- about concentration camps, you\u2019re going to be\nand the women, all this baloney [inaudible]. So it took them four days. Some tried to\nescape, I found out later, you know, from the wagon, you know, go and it\u2019s wintertime,\nthe f -- it was way below zero. Can you imagine when you have to have family, two\nfamilies, 10 - 12 or 15 people in the sled with the belongings and it takes about couple\nhours and you know, it\u2019s freezing, you have a child -- you saw some women and\nchildren, you know, froze to death. Some of them tried to escape. So, it didn\u2019t -- 1f you\nmanage to escape from all the transport, some got shot on the spot, some managed to\nescape and they got them in touch with a certain friend, a Christian friend and they stayed\nthere for awhile and they were told you know, there is some Proushinna, go and this way\npartisans and they reached the partisans there -- if they reached, you know, and they\njoined, eventually, our group. When we were in the woods, there was a na -- you know --\nthere is -- we found another group. So, the second night, I say -- when we es -- finally we\nescaped, it took us all night to reach the forest. We didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t meet those guys\nthere that had -- and this was the worst experience of our life. We -- it was cold and\nhungry and -- and -- it\u2019s -- we were wondering around, maybe we\u2019re going to found\nthem, because they supposed to have already s -- maybe a place -- you know, they -- a\nbunker, you know, we all live in a bunker in the -- in the woods, camouflaged somehow,\nbut you can make a fire and all that. We did, you know, with matches, we did had --\nmade, at night we made a fire, emergency. We ha -- li -- you know, warmed up a little.\nBut it was -- 1t was rough for the older, some -- some couldn\u2019t take it, you know. It f --\nand so -- so we wandered around for about a week and we tried -- the group, our group,\nthe 18 and three women, to be independent.

        "A: Well, the bunk -- you know what the bunker is? I-It 1s a -- we call, it\u2019s more -- about\nthree, four feet in the ground, yeah. With plenty -- you know, in the woods, you have\nplenty of trees and logs and all that. So you try to -- you brace and then you\u2019re -- we\nknew -- we have an idea how the bunker -- you know, how to build the bunker so you can\ns-sleep about 10 on each side. So -- and just high enough, six feet, so you can -- you\nknow, you can go in. And then you had the -- on both sides you had the -- what you call\nit? B-Bunk -- the -- the bunks where you can just lay around and sl -- you know, just lay\naround and sleep. And in -- in middle, eventually, in the middle of the bu -- middle of the\nbunker was a stove, made a stove. This was -- this was when we -- you know, we decided\nwe had to go to get some bricks. We had to go to the farms, get bricks and ge -- and --\nand build the stove, make that. Then we had to go -- go to g-get some -- for the food\nundertaking, you know, they call it in Russia bombioshka. To go to a farm, you got to\neat. After a week, you know, you -- we didn\u2019t find leave -- we were hungry, starved. So --",
        "A: Well, here, the first time approach the farmers, so we decided five men from the group. I\nparticipated and we decided we going to go -- we were armed, we were going to go to a\nfarm and get some bread and get some -- you know, if -- we\u2019re around, then we ne -- after\nall, that\u2019s the way they\u2019re -- they -- they -- Russians lived there so -- for so many month.\nThey knew already the territory, they were there -- have guns to the farmer. The --\nlessinder -- the farmer was caught in between, let\u2019s put it, caught watteeou in between. So\n-- so, on the way, the first -- the first undertaking, we met on the road, it was wintertime,\na Sled, a farmer had a calf and he had in his sled and he had some salt and he had some\nflour from the mill. So we took the sled and yeah, we soo -- the sled, whatever -- away\nfrom the farmer and we brought it down to the f -- to the -- he was riding just -- on the\ntrack, you know, between -- between the -- not far from the woods. We brought this in\nthe -- to our place, our home there and on the way going -- you\u2019re going -- going to our\nplace -- to the bunker, call it a home, we stopped another little farm, we got some bread,\nyou know, the way the Russian did. They baked a big loaf of bread. If you get t-two loafs\nof bread -- it was rationing, so it -- mean, at least you managed, you managed. You know,\none loaf of bread, you can -- you can make 20 or 25 portions. So you s -- you stayed on a\nportion. You know, we were -- we were fair. Each one got a portion of bread. These were\nthe first days. Then we discovered that farmers were coming in the woods, chopping --\nchopping -- you know, they came in and they were chopping wo -- woods, logs for\nthemselves and we are pretty close there, so we had to abandon [indecipherable]. We had\nto abandon the first time with -- we abandon that place, already. And, yeah, this was\nwhen we went the first time, we had to go to the farm, to the farmers to get the equipment\nin order to build. You ha -- we had to have like a -- a s -- a saws, we had to have shovels,\nwe have to have picks in order --",
        "A: No, you -- no, we never [indecipherable] no, we didn\u2019t have this with us, no, we didn\u2019t\nhave this. We expected the 10 men, they going to have a place, a home for us. See, we\ndidn\u2019t meet them for -- took us a -- took us a long time. I think on the third week we met\nthem. So, the first -- so we got -- we got all the equipment to build -- to build this gym --\nwe call it gymlamka, it means in the -- in the ground. And it was camouflaged with brush\nand -- and a -- in order to protect -- you know, the rain shouldn\u2019t go in, we had plenty\nsand, fill up with sand. But even though the sand, you know, went through, you know, it\nwas -- it w -- in the beginning it -- 1t wasn\u2019t too bad, later on there was a problem. Later\non was a problem, well you bose -- you know, you got loaded with lice and fleas.",
        "A: Oh, because from the sand and -- you know, later on. Even -- even -- even being, you\nknow, when we organized being in the partisan with the -- all together, the Russian\npartisan. But we got used to 1s already. That time, we already had -- we had -- we call it -\n- they had a -- a steam room outside, yeah. A steam room, you went outs -- I -- I don\u2019t\nknow, you went out of the steam room wintertime, almost naked, then you run in in order\nto get -- in order to get rid of them. It was a problem because, you know, the bunks you\nslept, each time -- you never undressed, you never took your shoes off. You only slept on\n-- you know, like -- like a -- it reminds me the concentration camps, you slept close to\neach other and -- and you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s bound to get from this -- from the -- from\nsomebody else or from the sand and somehow, get infested -- get infested. But we f -- we,\nfrom the experience idis we discovered, we learned, you know, we got rid of. We used to\nmake a fire.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, in order to get -- in the beginning we used to make a fire -- well, this\nwas already when we are organized. So he told us, m-make a fire and the smoke, make a\nbig smoke, take off your shirt and hold it over the fire and then alls -- you know, thens --\nthen they all -- they all commit -- all drop. This was only in the beginning. Later on, you\nknow, we were in 19 -- so this independent Jewish group, we lived for four months\nindependently. We learned our lessons, then we moved three times. Here, was in a car\nyou know, we saw farmers there. We went -- you know, like they di -- we were afraid we\ngoing to be discovered, so we decided we going to go in another place. Then we discover\nthere\u2019s another group in the woods, about 12 Jewi-Jewish groups and there was another\ngroup, eight, there\u2019s another 20. We were already -- so, ev -- being maybe around 50 -\n60, you got to have enough food, you know to -- so, we tried, the second time to go a\nbigger undertaking, they call it for -- f-food undertaking. And it was -- we went to a big\nfarm, not far from our town, you know this and we loaded up two loads, two -- 1-it was\nstill wintertime -- two sleds with lot of products, most -- you know bread, flour and the\noats, whatever they had there. Potatoes. Now, potatoes wasn\u2019t a problem with -- potatoes,\nthe farmers added -- all the farms, they s -- they had their supply potatoes outside. Supply\nfor the whole wint -- for the whole season and the same thing, but covered with straw and\nthen with sand, so you shouldn\u2019t freeze. Now, the same thing looks like a outside bunker,\nwe were -- you know, we were inside -- outside. So we used to go -- potatoes, we used to\ngo in and steal, was no prob -- we can always get potatoes enough. If you didn\u2019t have\nfood, well you got potatoes. And you had a fire, so baked po -- used to bake th -- baked\npotatoes. Or that -- I mean a -- as long so, you got -- you got a -- you got along, you did --\nwa-wasn\u2019t a hungry. And the only thing is we still -- we still don\u2019t -- where -- where is\nour voice? Where is our voice? So, we were wandering around, we met some partisans\nalready that time in the woods. And they were already as -- dressed nice and they -- you\nknow, driving -- during the day, right on the route. You know, in t -- near -- in the\nterritory around the woods, they weren\u2019t even afraid. Driving around with a sled and the\nhorses. And they met us and they says, \u201cWell,\u201d -- the same thing -- those who are armed,\nthey would take it. Those who don\u2019t -- hasn\u2019t got any arms, he says you got to have the --\nthey wouldn\u2019t nex -- they wouldn\u2019t take it in. They wouldn\u2019t -- they -- you know, they\nwouldn\u2019t accept them. So, they were friendly in the beginning. They helped us go, if --\nyou know, with our group and they participated and they helped us to go for a bigger\nundertaking, food undertaking. They knew already how to do it. See, we weren\u2019t\nexperience. And they helped us with food undertaking. So it wasn\u2019t so bad and\neventually, I think I -- on the third week, we found our group, see? And they were still,\nalready incorporated with some partisans, with some Russian partisans. But it still was\nindependent groups, each one living independently. But at least we had some -- so they --\nwhen we met the 10 groups, they were already more experienced, we took on some\nmilitary missions, couple. So, in order to get some more ammunition for the -- you know,\nwhere the -- you\u2019re about 60 there, some of them didn\u2019t -- came [inaudible] the 12 -- the\n12, they only have maybe a couple rifles. Now, our group, considering the way we were\narmed, it\u2019s unbelievable, having -- because I -- I -- y-y-y-y-y -- in -- come to think of -- I\nwas mention, in -- in Warsaw ghetto, it was so rough to -- you know, it was so rough to\nsmug -- to get arms in. They tried the -- the -- the -- the underground, Polish\nunderground. They supposed to help them and you know, with money to buy -- you\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know, you had to buy guns and ammunition. Many times, you know they\ntak -- they took the money and they didn\u2019t deliver it. You know, they didn\u2019t deliver it.\nWith so little, whatever they had -- with so little, you know, they stood out and they\ncouldn\u2019t and the Germans had to bomb them out, in order -- can you imag -- in Warsaw\nghetto, with so little. So comparison the little group, there was thou -- Warsaw ghetto\nwith half a million Jews, 400,000 Jews, so you figured, \u201cGee, we are blessed compar --\nunbelievable,\u201d we were blessed comparison. So -- so we managed -- you know, went to\nthe farmers, they saw we are Jews, but what can they do? They looked around, a Jew, I\nmean some were unfriendly farmers, but they -- we took whatever we needed that. So\nwhen we met up with the other 10, we already -- I mean we got -- build some senti --\nwhat do you call it, a bunkers, three -- three of -- 20 of -- we -- three bunkers 1n each side\nand they helped us, we went have bigger -- you know, on food a-assignment, we had\nalready help from the Russians -- partisans. They wo -- they -- they helped us. And many\ntimes we reciprocated, they says, okay, wi -- you'll have to go with us, they picked a few\nfr-from the -- our group, which -- you know, some not armed. Over -- he says, they ouv --\nthey going to protect us. They took us and they said we going to go on the track and you\ngoing to -- they gave us saws, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re going to cu-cut telephone poles and\ntelegraphs and stuff like that.\u201d The Russian says, \u201cOh, you do, we -- they lay an ambush,\u201d\nhe says, \u201cwe going to protect you, at\u201d -- everything at night. S --",
        "A: Well, this is -- this is a mission, but I mean it -- okay, cut tele -- yeah, I mean -- two --\nyou know, the old, each one on two sides, you -- the holes, we didn\u2019t have the electric\nsaws. Had to saw the -- cut the telephone at night, saw it -- what\u2019s the -- through the --\ndisrupt the communication. They had to come back, you know, in the morning, you\nknow, and the ki -- th -- chi -- group from German would have to come back and replace\nthe poles. This was -- this was a battle for them. So this we did, before we even got\norganized with them, they made us [indecipherable]. I mean, it foo -- it wasn\u2019t so bad.\nAfter all, they helped us -- they helped us with food, but when we met up with the 10 -- f-\nfirst 10 already, we decided that we\u2019ll go for a little mi-mil -- missions. We\u2019ll go -- they\nknew and we went, for instance, three examples I put there. One time, we s -- we went to\na -- to the -- to the -- there was -- I mentioned there was a sawmill in -- near Proushinna\nand there was a German -- you know, the German -- we went to the sawmill, there was --\nthey had a sawmill and a flour mill there and it\u2019s -- and -- and it was a big -- big\noperation see -- badaway for Jewish engi -- contro -- Jewish -- on the -- two Jewish\npeople. So we went there and we disarmed -- we didn\u2019t kill the German. We went in the\nhouse, whatever we had, the guns, whatever we had, the gun. We took his gun, we took\nsome clothes and we loaded up our -- two -- what you ca-call it? The same sleds, wagons,\nwith how other products. There\u2019s a fa -- lot of products and we brought it in -- back to --\nyeah, so -- this the -- that time, it helped. It\u2019s a little mission. And -- but the main -- the\nmain -- the main mission was when we blew --",
        "A: Empty. Empty. I mean we just crept in -- you know, it was at night, we went 1n there and\nyeah, we burned it up, we blew up -- burned up the headquarters. It was -- 1t wa -- it wa --\nit was a big house, where they operated from there. And -- and -- and on the way back --\non the way back there were -- yo-you know, and it was already late. We met -- there was\nthree German patrols there, patrolling there, you know, we ambushed the -- he wa --\nambushed them and took their rifles away, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. The three -- yeah, we killed the three Germans. We had to. We take the rifles away\nand es-especially the -- especially the winter, you know, the clothes and the boots was\nimportant. Yeah, yeah, this is a Jewish group, the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Oh ye -- oh -- well, I -- well, I -- I wore the boots. Each one -- each one -- it was 1f you --\neverybody was running, you know, later on, when it was organ -- everybody was running\nfor the [indecipherable]. You know, we used to -- mine, for instance -- this was in 19 -- 1-\nin 19 -- late 1941, I think, in June. They dropped -- now we were already -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nalmost five months as independent groups, with little Russians here and there groups, all\nkind of groups. Everybody was independent. And in s -- late May, they -- Russian planes\ndropped off military -- military what you call it? Men. And that\u2019s when the rule of the\njungle finished. Finally came an order, they -- you know, they realized there is some\npartisans and they wanted to get organized more. So, for us, Jewish partisans, it was the\nrule of the jungle, becau -- was ended. It -- they says, no more. You cannot just go around\nand live off of your farmers and survive. You got to fight for -- you know, you got to\nfight the enemy. So, all the groups in the woods, the surrounding whoever, they found.\nJews, Poles, Russian, White Russians. Was established the young ones belonged to a\nfighting group, the older ones -- you know we had some older escapees and couples,\nmarried the -- and -- and a family up front, you call it a boyavoyee and a family.\nBoyavoyee\u2019s a fighting -- fighting brigade and a family brigade. Now, the family, see the\n-- they didn\u2019t break it up. If you were husband and wife, it was in the family. Now, my\ncommander with his wife went in the co -- went in in the family group. Older people --\nyou know, anything is the fa -- and the family was -- now, they had their own place. We\nwere responsible for them. And all the young ones, single young ones who were able to\nfight in the fighting groups. So that time I was assigned to the 16 of the -- all the Jewish\npartisans, 16 were assigned to the Kirov group. They called it Kirov brigade and this was\na unit of the ien Ponnavarenko division. That\u2019s what it tells you, they\u2019re Ponnavarenko.\nThis is -- our brigade belonged to the Ponnavarenko. And I was assigned and my brother\nwas assigned to the Kirov brigade and the third battalion and third platoon somehow\nthere. And that\u2019s the way we were assigned and th-the life of the partisan changed. We\nwere already safer, because we lost, you know, we went one time from our group, we\nwent for a underta -- food undertaking. Now we undertook too much and we came,\nsuccessfully with two loaded wagons with food to our place, the bunker. And we st -- I\nwa -- I participated, my brother participated, that time was about 15 of us went. And the\nGermans followed. Eventually it was -- at night we were safe. And we were loading it, all\nthe food and you were -- kept the -- you know the food, mostly you ke -- you kept it\nhidden in certain -- all around the certain places, make sure that in case you get chased\nout or you have to -- or you have to abandon the place. You had to be careful not only\nabout y-ye -- for the Germans, sometimes from farmers or from even a -- you know, from\nthey\u2019 Il come in in the woods, or they had a lot of spies. You see, there was -- the\nGermans had a lot of spies. They knew there is some partisans. And they had a lot of\ncollaborators from the Russians. There was a whole division, they call it the Valosofts1.\nWe ca -- we called them Valosoftsi, General Valosoft -- Valosoft went, the first day of\nthe war is the -- two more -- they surrender to the Germans. Just -- and what happened,\nthey surrendered. And the Germans didn\u2019t use them on the-- to fight on the front, but they\nused the all divisions, you know -- you know is a evosovla -- all army maybe, I don\u2019t\nknow it -- maybe -- maybe two, three division. A division is 20,000 men. So the German\nused those Valososftsi\u2019s, they -- those are the Valosoftsi\u2019s, as collaborators. They put\nthem for alt -- you know, to do all the kind of dirty work in the -- in the garrisons, in --\nyou know, all kind -- in garrisons, or in the villages, in the cities and -- and they replaced\nthe Germans -- you know, they did the work for the Germans.",
        "A: Oh, well, ye -- see, what happened? So, all of a sudden the Germans, you know, there\nwas a shot -- we had a shot. And those who were outside, we were outside, just ready and\nSO we saw the Germans. So we tried to grab you -- the rifle, anything you could, we start\nto escape deeper in the woods. And here, the Germans blew up the bun -- there was about\n-- about eight of -- eight -- they didn\u2019t participated, but they belonged to our group, eight\nguys. So they -- that\u2019s all they did is -- 1s they -- with grenade, they blew up the bunkers\nand they -- they killed the -- thega -- they killed them all and they got one girl, they took\na -- a injured girl a pri -- as a prisoner. The reason -- I don\u2019t know, they took the girl,\nprobably they tried to squeeze -- find -- maybe to find out more information. So we had\nthe -- that\u2019s -- we had one -- what you call it, tragedy. And, so we lost at that time, seven\n- eight men from our group. And seven men from the first group got killed before we got\norganized, by -- by another group of partisans, for -- the only reason they got -- were wot\n-- killed, because -- for their clothes, for their boots or something. Because it was the rule\nof the jungle, before.",
        "A: It was not -- it was -- what I mean, this is the rule -- they -- they are in the woods the\nsame. They supposed to -- they supposed to fight and we all, but that\u2019s the way it was,\nthe rule of the jungle. I mean, they didn\u2019t -- if -- if -- if they figure maybe you have a\nwatch -- I don\u2019t know, we never -- we complained later on to -- you know, we were\norganized already in the -- you know, in the partisans. But it was too late, we says, well,\nnot much -- I mean, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a terrible loss. And the bar -- that commander and his\nbrother got killed. That -- what I say -- that Barro Sagell. The first one, yeah.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: Well, I did a little. See, when you -- in the Russians class, when you reach 18 in Russia,\nthey -- they taught you how to clean a rifle and take apart a rifle. It\u2019s by the Russians. So,\nin last year, I knew out -- you know, the Russian rifle -- how to take apart and clean a\nrifle and all that. But, we never -- we never went on the range for experience that, yeah.",
        "A: Did I have a --",
        "A: Oh, before -- before that?",
        "A: No. First of all, it was ill -- you know in pole -- in Poland was illegal. It\u2019s not like here. It\nwas illegal to have arm, any rifle, machine. Only the police or certain -- it was illegal, no\nguns. Most of -- most -- if you heard the -- what\u2019s -- 1f committed murders is just -- you\nknow -- no gun used.",
        "A: I was trained. I was trained, that\u2019s what I want to say. Now, I was young and I was -- you\nknow, I was strong. As a rule, most of the Russians are a -- a liltz -- some are -- I would\nsay Russian soldiers, majority is not like Germans -- big guys. Small -- smaller guys. And\nwe -- in the third where I was assigned, in the third battalion [indecipherable] brigade.\nWe had a anti-tank gun. This is the only gun the brigade possessed that time. Now, they\ncall that PT -- Russian is P-PTR. Now this -- this gun was used mostly -- we didn\u2019t\nexpect to get involved, you know, with fweet -- with the German tanks or Panzers, or yur\n-- in battle. It was used mostly on the railroad to s -- to s-shoot in their engine and stop\nthe engine all -- blow up the engine so the train can not. We were very limited in\nexplosive that time. You know, ba explosives. So we used the PT and only gun. The -- it\nweigh -- it weighed -- it weigh -- it was very heavy, it weighed maybe 150 pounds. But it\nwas -- you know, now there 1s -- the whole timer and it\u2019s two parts. It was -- y-y-you --\nyou could separate it in two parts, so I was assigned at number two and -- and there was\nnumber three -- three -- three pe -- thr-three guys used to be in charge of the PTR -- of\nthat -- of --",
        "A: Carry it and the number one, it was responsible by shooting it. Yes, so I was -- in the\nbeginning there, you know, the number two and fin -- I was trained then to be number\none, to use the gun on missions for the trains to -- to shoot ac-actually to -- mostly what\nyou can do is, many times it -- in engines -- make sure that either yo -- either you\ndestroyed the engine, you know, it wasn\u2019t -- 1t wasn\u2019t -- that time -- it\u2019s better -- I mean\nit\u2019s -- it -- it 1s -- it is the only ti -- the only gun we used on these certain missions. Now,\nlater on, it was in the late \u201842, in the be -- in the I-late -- no, \u201842, in beginning \u201843,\nRussian planes already used to drop off a lot of explosives. And til then, it -- we had to --\nbesides using that -- that -- that what you call, anti-tank gun, the partisans dependent on\nthe dynamite explosives to -- gathered from the outside. Now, how do you get it? Mostly\nfrom the outside. You know, the war was going on, you were finding shells here, you\nknow, artillery shells and it was very dangerous to -- you know, sometimes a lot of them\ngot killed in order to build a bomb -- to build the -- the -- what you call it? The -- yeah,\nthe --",
        "A: The ex -- the explosive, yeah. So, but it -- they -- we did -- you know, already at that\ntime, there were some specialists in from the Russians, which they tried somehow to get\nthe shell apart and to build the bomb by hand and use -- use the -- the -- the -- usually\nwhat I mentioned, the hand grenades -- the hand grenades was very, very important for\nthe purpose of the bomb, because it\u2019s all you had to do is pull the pin out and this can ex -\n- you know, this was used as a detonator for the bomb. But, later on -- like they -- they\nwere -- the Soviets planes used to come down at night and drop off a lot of materials,\nmostly the -- you know, for the purpose of -- I would say a lot of automatic rifles, but a\nlot of em -- those m -- dynamite supplies, bomb supplies.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s very -- see, we used to -- we used to do -- this is now where I -- where I\nparticipate quite often with that. We used to reach a place, mostly at night and find a spot\nsuitable for us to retreat in case, you know -- you know, right in the jungle or something,\nin the swamp. Find a spot there. Now, and we used to mine the -- the -- the -- the tracks,\nyou know, [indecipherable] was -- was very -- you know -- they were in -- it was very\neasy, they weren\u2019t -- what you call it? Patrolled or -- and -- and watched so carefully.\nAnd you f -- you s -- now, you had a s -- there was so many -- there was so many\nbrigades already in the woods that time, that each brigade had their own territory. You\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know what I mean? You just couldn\u2019t go in anywhere near here. For\ninstance, we got a section, they gave us a territory where we had to operate, far away\nfrom our camp. Let\u2019s see -- and another group was close to our camps, you know, and\nthat\u2019s the way it was set up. So, we used to -- at -- at night, creep down, we had plenty of\ntime -- small groups, about. On this missions the mostly -- the most is four or five men.\nVery -- it\u2019s all -- you go -- first of all, you -- you couldn\u2019t find out exactly when the train\nis going to go, or something.",
        "A: Yeah, and we were operating on the main -- m-m-ma-ma-main junction, which is\n[indecipherable] and means komoskwa -- the main junction where all the -- where all the\nt-trains were going, all the traffic. So, in the beginning, so you put the mine and you had\nto dig a little hole between the -- between the -- what do you call it? You have the\nrailroad, the -- the -- the -- what do you call it, the wood, or --",
        "A: Blocks.",
        "A: Tie, yeah, betwee -- the -- the -- between the railroad ties, there. And many times and it\nwas a detonator sticking out. You know, they had a detonator sticking out. So the train\ngoes by and it touches the detonator and it blows up. But the Germans got smart,\neventually, you know what happens, so they were ripping the trains day and night and\nyou know, the war was going on. So they tried to put -- before -- you know th -- before\nthe engine, you know, before the engine goes, the -- first of all, the engine is going to --\nwhat happened -- the engine comes first -- the engine blows up first. So that\u2019s -- that\nstops the whole operation, engine. So they tried to put two flatbed cars full with sand or\nbricks or -- or all kind of -- th-tho -- heavy material. So this should rip -- you know, it-\nitll hit -- this\u2019Il hit first, so this\u2019Il ge-get blown up, it\u2019s not going to hit the engine. So\nthey -- they\u2019re going disconnect, so they going to follow that, then it\u2019s -- it means -- and\ncame to point, you know, this was very -- this was very easy because they couldn\u2019t\ncontrol all the railroad. They were in such a p -- they -- they were in such a trouble, that\nfinally they decided -- you know, they took farmers each from -- from the farms and put\nthem at night -- forced them on the tracks to watch the -- you know, to watch the tracks.\nMany times I used to come on the tracks and there was -- you know, civilians. They got\ncaught in the middle. I don\u2019t\u2019 know, you know, it\u2019s tough. They got -- its\u2019 a war, they got\ncaught in the middle.",
        "A: We told them -- well, w-we told them, \u201cYou better take off.\u201d\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened, the German ac -- you know what I mean? We weren\u2019t afraid, we told them,\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to mine, you better -- you better get out of here. You better take off.\u201d So\nthat\u2019s -- it means they\u2019re so desperate -- so -- so desperate to watch the traffic -- watch\nthe traffic. But the main, the -- finally the main -- you know, the Russian, they discovered\na trick that\u2019s -- in -- in order -- we were supplied with -- just like a bar of soap. That\u2019s all\nit had -- and had a little detonator there. And that\u2019s all you had to rip the tracks instead --\ninstead the trains. Just rip the [indecipherable] rip the tracks, you know, the tracks.",
        "A: Just rip the tracks, take a fist, you know. And this is so easy, we -- we went out\nsometimes 40 - 50 at a time for miles, miles of the track. That\u2019s all you had to do 1s -- as\nleedbat -- you know, it was something like a -- it\u2019s not a rope, but it hads -- had -- it\u2019s not\na wire, too.",
        "A: No, the --",
        "A: -- the -- the fuse was -- the fuse was inside a little bar of soap.",
        "A: But you -- that\u2019s all you needed is a match and five or 10 minutes, til itll -- it\u201911 burn til\nit\u2019ll reach the -- til 1t\u2019Il reach the tracks, so you true retreat. So, we were laying right\nbetween it and it -- it fits right between the -- the railroad track, the railroad s-siding\nthere, yeah. And this was -- th-th-th -- this was -- it was the -- blowing the tracks, day and\nnight -- day and night. So this was minor tra -- this was already minor -- mi -- minor\noperation. It -- now, the big oper -- the bigger operation it came to point when the so -- in\n-- this was already 1944, we told -- you know, we told our commanders that in\nProushinna, there were the Leaman brother -- that Leaman for the communication and the\n-- and the telephone lines, and he was the one -- he was a murderer, I guess. That\u2019s him --\nnobody wanted to work or -- for him. So we told -- we told the commander, you know,\nwhy can\u2019t we go on this -- on the Proushinna - Voushanna line there and -- and -- and\nmine the road and we\u2019|l got -- you know, he was in charge of -- he was always in charge.\nMine the road and we were in the forest that time on both sides, maybe -- maybe 60 or\n70 men lay in ambush. So what we did is we cut the lines. We knew they left to come in\nin the morning, during the night. We mined the roads, because -- in case there was not\ntoo much traffic, only military. So -- and we mined the roads just -- in -- in the -- you\nknow, in the morning. We knew that they going to s -- the minute, what you call it,\nsunlight, they going to ar-arrive and would -- you know, lay there in ambush on both\nsides and you know, two trucks, you know, with the Germans, each one -- 30 on each\ntruck. Now, the first truck, the first one hit the mine and blew up. We knew -- the second\none stopped. We knew that the second one is going to stop and we\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll -- we -- we\nlaid on both side and this was a spot we picked -- it just -- you know, has got to go\nthrough the woods, through this -- you know, through the -- on both sides we are\nprotected. Either we\u2019re going to cut off -- we can go to the right, we can run to the left --\nwe are in the woods. And -- and sure, the second one stopped and we opened a fire from -\n- you know, it was from both side across. We killed them all, 30. Everybody was running\nfor the booty -- you know, booty.",
        "A: To get. To get -- you know, for -- arm we didn\u2019t need already maybe, the only thing was\nimportant, pistol. I mean we\u2019d -- we a -- you know, not everybody had a pistol. So, in\norder to have the pistol, a guard -- or sometime -- this was already, you know, important\ntouch from both sides, you know, you were respected. You had a pistol, you must have --\nyou know, already -- you were already a respected partisan. You must have -- if you\npicked -- killed -- got a pistol, it\u2019s yours. And no -- no, you can -- cannot take it away\nfrom you. If I took the pistol, it\u2019s mine.",
        "A: Yeah, I got a pist -- beside -- besides that, of course they had -- we took especially, the cl\n-- the clothes what they had and all that. So, this was one of the -- one of the main -- it\u2019s\nnot the main mission, we -- where I participated and my brother participated. Later, after\nthat, it happened that, you know, my brother somehow -- with a post, so he fell asleep, so\nthey s-separated them, they dropped -- there was another group, they dropped down 50 -\nsome paratroopers and they needed local partisans, so all the three who were in the post\nfor a punishment, he says they needed -- they send them in to the -- to the o -- to the\nothers -- to the other group. And --",
        "A: The -- ma -- my brother and the other two on the post as a punishment, because a\npunishment could be -- you know, this is -- could be -- you can be shot when you fell\nasleep on the post. So they -- I was separated and I didn\u2019t hear from him for the -- all that\ntime. I didn\u2019t hear -- I knew he is with the Capute -- eventually they joined they ca -- they\ncall it the Capusta brigade. I knew there, but we didn\u2019t see each other and we didn\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t ca -- didn\u2019t communicate each other -- with each other. And only once -- I heard\nonce -- once that he\u2019s -- you know, that he\u2019s operating, he\u2019s alive, so forth, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, well. Well, well, here it is. A lot of -- a lot of partisans were assigned at the camp.\nNow, at the camp, mostly those who were assigned at the camp -- pardon me -- their\nresponsibility was to go and -- on the food undertaking for themselves and for the family\ne -- for the family br-brigade, because there was all -- a lot in the families, yeah.\nHundreds, you know, I mean -- you know, not only Jewish already, you know, from some\n-- you know, from Rofe and Belagooshins ala -- there\u2019s a -- this -- it was -- it was -- big\ncamps, family camps. And so those who didn\u2019t participated, so they had to do local work,\nchop wood and stay on posts. The posts, that\u2019s boring, you know, stay on -- you know,\nthere\u2019s a -- posts, there\u2019s a lot of -- y-y-you were s -- you were -- spread it for mi-miles\naway, you know. A post here, maybe 10 miles another one, two, three on this track, on\nthe onther track. And the purpose of the post -- then you had -- they call it like a secret --\nyou had the secret parole they call that the secret code. You know, if you meet somebody,\nhey, even the partisans, it\u2019s -- you know it was every -- you know, it was concentrated\nwith a command from the different ach -- from the different brigade. He had -- he knew\nthe code, because if they were true and they didn\u2019t say the story, I say, \u201cStop, I\u2019m going\nto shoot. Who are you? Give me the code.\u201d If he didn\u2019t have the code, he\u2019s a -- he\u2019s a\nspy, he\u2019s a traitor, he\u2019s going to get killed.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Oh, they\u2019Il say a code, for instance -- any type of code, one f -- I give you example, 15 -\n10 or of Vashilare beach or -- or Josie. You know, they picked any kind -- any kind of\ncodes. Like in the military, you know, yeah. So it was -- you know, it was central\ncommand, very -- you know, with the discipline -- with the discipline. So they -- those\nwho didn\u2019t participated were doing work around there, mostly on poles. And so they ju --\nwere just sitting, doing sometime -- they si-sitting, doing nothing too, you know. And\nthat time, food were plenty. Three times a day, meals. Now, the meal consisted -- you\nknow, not fussy. Now, what we had -- it came to point that we went -- we had to a -- to a\nfarm. Now, our -- our duty was to go to farms to -- far away, like I say, each one was\nassigned a territory. We couldn\u2019t go to the poor farmers. We had to go to the rich\nfarmers, because the ch -- we knew that the Germans gave them a quarter that they on --\nthey can only have -- raise a pig or two pigs and the rest of them, they have to give it or\nsell it. There has to be for the German army that stand. So, and the same thing with cows\nand with butter, whatever they liked, you know, they call it -- cheeses and butter. The\nGermans requested from the rich -- from the rich farmers that they s -- I don\u2019t know if\nthey paid them something for it, it belongs to them, you know. And we had to go to those\nspecial farms to take away the German food, specially. Go far away and attack wi -- you\nknow, sometimes, if we had a -- the assignment, undertaking, were in the hundred -- you\nknow, sometime 100 - 200. Now they couldn\u2019t -- at night they were afraid, we controlled\nalready that time the -- the woods. Even sometimes joonk -- the -- what happens, if you\nwent for a mission and let\u2019s say it\u2019s late at night already, you couldn\u2019t reach your\ndestination to youk -- to your -- back to your -- to your -- ah, what\u2019s with -- to your\nbunker or your house. So, summertime, we had a -- summertime we had a privilege, you\nknow, we used to go in and hide -- small groups. I\u2019m talking about this -- a g -- smaller\ngroups going on mission to mine the roads or mine the bridges on -- or rip up the tracks.\nSo, we used to stop and go in in the field, you know, on the road, going in the field,\nsneaking in the corn field, in the -- in those field and st -- and stay up all day there. It was\nhot -- oh, 1t was ho -- you know, the sun in the hot day and -- and sometimes -- oh, we\nhad -- you know, we carried -- we had some water, we had some supplies. It was so -- it -\n- it -- 1t was a system -- it was a sys -- many times if you didn\u2019t reach, many times we\nforced in and I went in to a village -- not, I mean a single -- not 1n a be -- not in a col --\nyeah, in a hamlet for is -- lot of farmers, like -- they call it a hoota -- a fa -- a big farmer\nhad lu -- has got his house by himself someplace set up in his -- in his fields there. And\nSO We -- we went in there and we kept him there and we didn\u2019t let nobody out. Anybody\ncame in, we had -- they stayed there til night reached. We impounded them and we left --\nnight reached, we went out, yeah, yeah. I -- I discovered -- you know, I discovered there\nwas two advantages about -- first of all, it -- about going on the missions, you know. You\nhave two advantages. First of all, the food always the same is, on the camp. Three meals\na day and soup and meat. Now the -- the staff, at a different kitchen, see that, and they\nhave a different -- different -- and they had that -- that cook, a different cook. They had\nalready -- we had cows. It came to a point we had cows, we had horses already. Many\nhere -- I mean there was cows, let\u2019s see, sometimes 10 - 15 - 20 cows and the cows were\nmilked and from the milk, this is for the staff. Now, when we went out, you know, you\nwent into a farm, then you got -- first of all you got cleaned up and you had a changed\n[indecipherable] you know, while you -- the night you got to go in the pound and to go in\nand get washed and -- and take a dive, went in to the farmer and got some -- you know,\nund -- you -- cotton. Usually the farmers, they made their own -- they made their own\nclothes. Yeah, to change. And it -- it -- I\u2019m -- 1-1-1t -- and one advantage and the second\nadvant -- and the second advantage, you -- you -- you had -- you can -- had a little milk.\nYou can -- you can have sometime only -- if you want a little booze, they used to make\ntheir own -- you know the [indecipherable] -- they used to have -- make their own, the\nfarmers -- little booze. Well, I didn\u2019t -- once in awhile. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a different -- you\nknow, when you go out, it\u2019s -- it sounds, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s March. It\u2019s -- it was safer in the\nsmaller groups than the bigger groups. Because we didn\u2019t try to get involved the small\ngroup in the fight for the Germans. You know, we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know we na -- we\ndidn\u2019t -- going to win the war fighting with the -- we just -- our -- our mission was to just\n-- to do as much damage -- disrupt the lines, cut the lines, mine the roads and mine the\nbridges and ge -- and give them as much trouble as -- as you know -- as much as we\ncould, that\u2019s all. We didn\u2019t expect -- you know, the partisans, but we had -- you know, we\nhad -- I-later on -- when it already this -- with the Soviets, when they dropped down -- the\nplanes landed, you know, they already took certain injured partisans, they took them.\nThey landed at night. You know, there was certain spots. Nobody controlled -- you know,\nti -- ti -- a lot of territory. Even sometime during the day, they -- then they -- they were --\nthey were -- I mean they didn\u2019t have the guts to go in in the woods.",
        "A: Yeah, we had women, yes.",
        "A: We had women. We had -- like I said, there weren\u2019t too many Jewish women, we had\nwomen, a few Jewish women participated in the -- in the -- 1n -- in -- in certain missions.\nBut there was a lot a girls from the C-Christians, from the -- mostly the White Russians.\nF-From the villages, you know, there were certain -- certain villages, those were situated\nnear -- near the -- the territory -- near the woods we have -- we operated. Now, see the\nGermans, what they did is they put garrisons in there. They knew the partisans are\ncontrolling the territory, so they put garrisons around those villages and I-lot f-from those\nvillages, they cooperated. They were sympathize with us, because some of their -- some\nof their boys already were in partis -- in partisans with us, with other groups. And so we\nhad -- we had g-good connections many times. For instance, when we went for a mission\n-- for big mission for food undertaking. You know, we found out before we went into\nvillage to find out if there is any Germans around. Is there garrisons around, because you\nknow, you -- to make sure that -- that there is -- there 1s non -- there is -- we should be\nsafe. But most of the garrisons, like I mentioned before, they were controlled by those --\nby those Valosoftis. There was a lot of Ukrainians there, who are the la -- this -- here the\nGermans, the collaborators, they put them in there. Of course with the German control,\nthere was some Germans with them. But the majority, the lot of -- they gave us a lot of\ntrouble, see? They send a lot of spies in the woods. They -- you know, they send the\nGermans, a -- a lot of spies in the woods and sometimes it was -- they -- they gave you\nout. They -- sometimes they -- but we had good connections, we had good connections\nand the last -- like I say -- when we got supplied from the -- we got supplied from the\nplanes and so we didn\u2019t have to go look any more for this -- make up our own minds and\nall that -- that -- everything was ready made and it was -- it was easy and -- and it was\nenjoyed.",
        "A: I mean, I -- I -- I enj -- I -- is en -- for me, it was enj -- for me it was enjoying. I did\nsomething -- I -- you know, I mean it\u2019s -- I would -- I would call. I mean I was a soldier. I\ndidn\u2019t call it to arrange, but I\u2019m a soldier. I\u2019m -- you know, I can fight, like any soldier,\ncan fight enemy.",
        "A: Yeah... Now, we had some problems though, 1n -- in the -- in -- in -- this was in 1944,\nyou know, we went -- besides, when they put those garrisons, those -- those Valosoftsis\nin there, we got an order to get them out. A mission, you know, a mission, you know, and\nthis is 200 here and two -- you know, and 200 there, 300 there. Sometimes we went for a\nmission where a few brigades took part. I would say 1000 - 1500, because if they had a\npower 600, you know, we had to double that. And we had to go and to a track and to\ndestroy the garrison. I mean just many times, many times I recall, you know, it was house\nto house. How --",
        "A: House to house, itch -- you know, they were -- there were -- into -- they controlled the\nvillage now. We went in and there was some those -- those Valosoftsis, you know, they\ndidn\u2019t wear German -- they didn\u2019t ger -- wear German clothes -- German. They had a\ndifferent, what you call? Uniform, yeah. They have a uniform. So, it came a -- came a\norder, we had to destroy it -- you know, vitist destroy them. Yeah, we had a lot of casual\n-- there was casualties, you know, over time. There was -- you know, Valosoft -- with\nJewish -- you know, Jewish partisan. One here, couple there from -- from the 16 -- from\nthe 16, from the -- from our -- my -- my brigade, which folong you know, there\u2019s quite a\nfew got killed. Quite a few got killed.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. It -- it -- yes, it -- it happened one -- it happened one time -- we were --\nwe were -- we went -- we went for a mission and in the house -- it fa -- like to say house\nto house -- in the house was a German and I was there. Right in the same house. And I\ndidn\u2019t kill him and he -- and he took -- you know somehow, you know we -- in the same\nhou -- he could have killed me and I could have killed him. And somehow, you know, it\nwas -- it -- it -- it was -- what you call it? That time, we had a mission to -- to take the\nvillage, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t -- I -- you know, I came out, I says -- I came out I says, a ger -- I -- you\nknow, there is a German there. Now, eventually we tried to look for him, you know, he\ndisappeared too. Maybe he got -- you know, he disappeared, you know. On many\noccasions, you know, it was lot of occasions, where just like in the army, you know, just\nlike in the army.",
        "A: Well, first -- first of all, I felt a satisfaction that -- you know, that I\u2019m a soldier, that I can\nfight and I can -- you know and I wouldn\u2019t call, really that -- I wouldn\u2019t call it revenge. I\nwould call it that I was maybe blessed or something. That I -- I\u2019m alive and I can fight,\nyou know, I can fight -- fight the enemy. You know, I didn\u2019t think about -- feel like this\nis my -- for my father or for my mother or something like that. No, I wasn\u2019t thinking\nabout it. I was -- you know, I -- it was -- interested -- I was just interested. Well, another\nthing I had in mind beside that, I -- my feeling was for the -- actually for the history,\nbesides, yeah. For the history.",
        "A: Th-That was -- that a Jewish fighter is -- you know, because I -- I always thought about\nthose -- you know, I didn\u2019t know where -- where -- where my family was taken and --\nand til -- til you know, I was liberated 1944 and my feeling was that I\u2019m doing something\nbeside as a fighter, I\u2019m doing a duty for the -- you know, something for the -- for the\nJewish people... That -- and that -- I was able to do something... Now I -- I came back\nafter the war to my -- I was liberated 1944, in -- in June. Now, they send me -- you know,\nI was a decorated partisan, so most of the partisans were taken on the front. The war was\nstill going on. As a matter of fact, in June, when they -- the second front started,\nsometimes the allied started in -- I think the same time maybe the second front started,\nnow. So I came -- they sent me and another group of -- of -- from the partisans, see and --\nto Proushinna to establish my town -- to establish order. You know, I\u2019m a decorated\npartisan -- a Jewish partisan. I came to Proushinna and I came to my house. And in my --\nand the house was -- that wasn\u2019t destroyed and I found in the house was a family of --\nyou know, I don\u2019t think -- I think it\u2019s a Ballousha family. Have a few children and you\nknow, she was surprised, you know, they were surprised to seeing, you know. I didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t even ask her how do you wind up in the house. My duty that time was to establish\nyou know, like -- like the front is moving, you know. It\u2019s interesting the way -- the way I\nwas liberated, you know. This 1s very interesting. We knew already that the -- that the\nRussians are coming now. And the patrol house already met with the Russian patrol. And\nwe were told that time that we have all the brigades what existed in the woods, that we\nhave to mine all the roads and all the bridges and let the Ger-Germans -- you know, to sla\n-- the retreat -- they shouldn\u2019t be li-living. You know, they were in a panic. I -- you\nknow, that\u2019s disati-disatisfaction they were k -- you know, they were -- they were running\nback. They were -- the Russian were chasing him and -- and -- and bombarding them and\nthey were running away so we tried our -- our mission was to mine the roads, not to let\nthem through. Let them go into the side, in the woods and to the -- all the other -- to all\nother ways. And we were in the woods and -- and we were -- you know, we -- we were\ncatching them by the -- by the hundreds. In the beginning we were sniping and we was\nkilling them. I mean sniping in the wood. It came to a point, you know, there was -- we\ncaught -- you know, we were complete army. You know, we were ca -- the partisans\nactually -- if we had an order, we could have gone in and liberate my -- liberated the --\nth-the city of Proushinna. The partisan were strong enough to go and liberate it -- this\nwhole city, all the cities around. You know, so they gave us the mission that -- that before\nI will -- came to Prou -- this was before, that we had -- had to participate and stop the\nenemy of -- you know, do as much damage as you can of retreating them. And that time\ncame an order, you know, we c-caught so many prisoners, we still were in the woods. We\nalready liberated, we are in the -- still in the woods, but we had to stake you know, and\njoin -- that\u2019s for our mission is to help the Russian army to disarm and to da -- day -- you\nknow, and to -- to -- there -- it was a disarray. I mean the -- the -- 1-it -- it\u2019s wortdill -- it\u2019s\nwort -- wild to me to live through a period seeing the way they marched in with such a\npower, d -- you know, great big -- big, you know, army was going to conquer the world,\nseeing them in retreat, you know, dirty, you know. They tried to -- to -- you know,\nchange their clothes in civilian clothes, they shouldn\u2019t -- you know, they shouldn\u2019t be\nrecognize as Germans. You know, it unbelievable in the retreat. So they tho --you\u2019re\nasking me th -- to me it\u2019s the -- that I lived through to see the biggest satisfaction with my\neyes. The retreat and the -- and the defeat. The defeat and disarray -- the ray -- the way a\n-- on that front -- on -- on the Russian front, the army. And the damage we did to them,\nyeah. We were laying -- we were assigned one time, of two -- on one bri -- there was a\nbridge, a very important bridge. Now we partisan, we had to control this bridge. We\nmined the road. Now, the German had to fix this bridge and now -- each time -- we were\nlaying from both side in ambushes. Each time they tried to fix -- they were in retreat, you\nknow, not the -- disorganized already, you know that? And they tried to fix the bridge,\neach time we opened fire. They didn\u2019t know if this is partisan or the Russian army. I\nthought I will fi -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sure that they -- they thought already, if the partisan they\nprobably would take a chance you know, and -- and -- and -- and f -- probably -- clean us\n-- go in a battle with us and get a -- you know, fight with us. But I -- I\u2019m sure they\nthought that was the Russian army at. And they never -- they were unsuccessful. They\ncouldn\u2019t -- they could -- never could build a bridge. That\u2019s why they had to go around.\nWe don\u2019t let them through the bridge, let\u2019s go around. So, then I was sent -- that\u2019s was\nalready -- we already free people -- already we -- the Russian army free. So, like I say,\nsome of them -- most of them were sent on the front. A lot of the farmers were sent back\nwith the children -- families. The families sent all back home and I was with -- I was --\nfrom the -- and that three of -- three more from the Proushinna Jewish partisans, sent to\nProushinna to establish the order -- establish order. So my job, so I did my job, which\nsatisfaction, I can say that.",

You know, th-that time -- you know, the ger -- the Germans, they didn\u2019t\nappointed those people. They were -- they were -- they were -- I mean volunteering. You\nknow, there\u2019s not such a thing volunteering. Not everybody wanted to be a -- a cop or not\neverybody wanted to be policeman, not everybody wanted to participate and go and kill\nand -- an-and -- an-and -- an-and_ do all kind of criminal -- commit all kind of atrocities\nlike that. But some figured, well, in the beginning, in \u201840, figured the Germans going to\nwin the war. They never realized, you know, everybody was -- you know, everybody was\nimpression. See, my father was a pessimist, he says, [indecipherable]. He says, \u201cNo, now\nboys, nothing doing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Germans,\u201d this was in 1941. \u201cThey took -- they\ncontrol all Europe, see?\u201d So then I stayed in Proushinna and I got to tell you that. The\ndoctor, which I mentioned, the neighbor of mine, that Olga Goldfein, arrived in\nProushinna. She was saved -- now, she escaped from the trains in -- she escaped from the\ntrains in the -- from the station at night and she came to Proushinna to the -- to that\nconvent -- nun convent -- Christian convent.",
        "A: Convent, yeah.",
        "A: And she was befriended with a nun and her name -- you know, her name is DellaRosa.\nBecause, she came with her in Proushinna, when I was in Proushinna. And I was shocked\nto s -- you know, how did you? So, what happened, she -- and she was probably -- I mean\nin the 50\u2019s, you know -- not the -- not the -- maybe -- maybe 60. And she escaped from\nthat wagons and she followed 10 kilometers and she came to Proushinna to the nun. The\nnun gave her the -- the -- you know, she got the clothes and she put a c-cross on her. But\nthe -- the -- the -- she told -- she told me -- this is after the liberation, now, she told me\nthat sh -- now the -- the -- in charge of that convent, they call it a -- the -- what you call it\na maynon orsed something.",
        "A: The mother -- the Mother Superior, of course, wasn\u2019t satisfied, she says better take her\nand go away with her, deep in Poland, where nobody knows. She was afraid that -- you\nknow, sometimes -- you -- you know, you -- sometimes maybe -- maybe somebody\u2019\ndiscover. You can\u2019t blame her, you know, they discover. So she took -- you know, when\nshe came in and the next day, you know, with the blessing with the Mother Superior, the\nblessing, she went the -- she actually comes from the different town. She comes some --\nthe towns near Lodz. And she -- they traveled somehow with her -- with the doctor. And\nshe spent all those years as a nun -- I mean as a doctor and n-not a doctor and she\u2019s wo --\nyou know, s-she was giving -- helping peop -- I mean, she\u2019s a doctor, they were so -- oh,\nthey were surprised. So when sh -- she came back, in Proushinna with this nun,\n[indecipherable] the nun, of course I will help. So, I tried -- I cou -- was able to do a lot\nof things here in Proushinna. Oh, anything you know, I tried to help the nun with -- with\nconvent -- even the whole convent to supply, make sure they have enough food. It was\nstill -- you know, the wa -- still with the Russians. It\u2019s still -- the war was still -- 1944,\nstill the war was going on and all that.

The funny part is this, that this doctor -\n- now, when I left Proushinna, my town, eventually I had to get out. My brother was in\nBialystok and I was in Proushinna. And Bialystok was a temporary capital of Poland.\nThey didn\u2019t take Warsaw yet. So, my brother was smarter, he wanted to get to the United\nStates, so he didn\u2019t want to -- he knew he\u2019|I -- that as long he can -- he was nearer there,\nthat he g-got out to Bialystok. So finally I discovered that he is in Bialystok. Now, for me\nit was a tough job getting out from Proushinna, because of my position. I told my\ncommander -- you know, the commander from the -- from the -- from the brigade was in\nProushinna too, he was there. So, I told him, you know, I have only brother and he\u2019s al --\nleft of family and he is in Bialystok and this is already Poland. Proushinna is White\nRussia. And so he said, \u201cOh yeah, you got a brother left? I\u2019m going to se -- we going to\nbring him, send a plane, we\u2019ll bring him -- bring him here,\u201d he says[indecipherable]. So\nthat\u2019s up to him, now. This was already a -- I was in Proushinna already about four, five\nmonths. This was close to -- the war was still going on, Russia wasn\u2019t taken yet. So,\nfinally, he would release me, my commander. But he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me, I have to go\nup to the -- you know, to higher -- to the region commander.\u201d Now, I went down to the\nregion commander and he send with a letter -- and the region -- you know, the reason I\ngave you know, the only -- family I lost -- have the only brother. So the region\ncommander says that well, that\u2019s good, yeah, t-take fr-fr -- it\u2019s a good -- I didn\u2019t know\nthey sent me with a secret letter back in Proushinna, but then I discovered that it -- he --\nhe mentioned that it\u2019s a -- for me, if I want to take, you know, go on the front and kill\nsvor -- kill as many more -- you know, take revenge for my family, as many to -- he is a\ngood c-candidate to go on the front. I\u2019m a good candidate to go on the front, you\nunderstand? It means because, well they figured the c -- well, I want to get out, you\nknow, it was you couldn\u2019t get out that time yet. 1944, you -- 19. Then they passed a law\nin 194- -- late 19 -- after the war, you know the p -- the law was passed that all those\ncitizens, Polish citizens from before the war, Proushinna, I was -- was Polish citizens,\nbecause mostly partisans, lot of them -- lot of survivors from the Auschwitz, you know,\nthey came back to Proushinna. And eventually was -- you know, you could apply, it was\nlegal. You could have -- you could have gone to Poland. But it -- I had a tough time\ngetting out.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",

        "A: When I -- this was in -- I was liberated in June, 1944. In Proushinna, only the few\npartisans who -- who were assigned to go to Proushinna and there I mentioned the\ndoctors unusual case. And no, there was -- I left -- I left Proushinna in late \u201844. It means I\ndidn\u2019t leave Proushinna. I had to take off abba partisan. I knew the territory. In order to --\nyou know it came to a point that I wanted to go to Bialystok and be with my brother. And\nwhile in Proushinna, after the liberation, 1944, I wrote a letter to my uncle, which\nprobably you read, yeah? I had a chance -- it took a long, long -- I knew that -- that my\nbrother\u2019s in Bialystok already, so I knew that he survived. So it took a long -- some -- a\nlong, long time. I think they got it in -- sometimes in 1945 in May, almost from the war --\nalmost fr -- the war was over kind of late, took very long. And I left Proushinna in s --\nclose -- June, July, Aug -- maybe around September, and -- in order to get into Bialystok.\nSo in -- I had to take -- I knew the territory, so I had to take the doctor and the nun with\nme and we -- you know, we crossed the water. It was between -- Bialystok was already\nPoland, not far f -- what I [indecipherable] over the border. So at night, somehow we\nsmuggled through and with the -- with -- I was -- I -- I still was in charge, I could -- I\u2019d\nbeen assigned, I can assign a farmer -- you know, to -- for -- for the job. I says, \u201cWe need\nyou to go in here and there.\u201d So we assigned a farmer and the doctor and the nun and I\nleft Proushinna and we were -- and we came to Bialystok. This was -- this was\nsmuggling, I mean -- yeah. This was illegal. It\u2019s taking a chance for -- for that other --\nother way. It was deserting.",
        "A: Well, I -- I was -- I was still assigned. They wouldn\u2019t let me -- they wouldn\u2019t let me go. I\nwas still assigned there, the job. So, it means, you know, yeah.",
        "A: How did I feel?",
        "A: Well, I f -- I was determined, you know, I was determined that -- that I want to -- you\nknow, I want to go west, you know. I was determined -- feel about it. You know, it\u2019s\nokay, I was a fighter, but I didn\u2019t believe -- I wasn\u2019t Communist. I didn\u2019t -- I knew that\u2019s\n-- that\u2019s -- I -- I -- | appreciate and acknowledge the help the Russians did to us. But I\nwanted -- you know, I didn\u2019t want to stay.

Now, Warsaw was still -- [indecipherable] wasn\u2019t\ntaken yet, because there was a big, big battle [indecipherable] Warsaw, you know. I\nremember there was the Polish army which was associated with the Russian army. There\nwas two Polish armies. One Polish army was established in Russia, which the Russian\ntook prisoners, most of the Polish army. This was -- you know, when the pact -- unknown\npact, Hitler and -- and Stalin made the pact and when the Germans in 1939 pushed the --\nno -- attacked, most of the army retreated east, towards the Russian border. And\neventually got trapped in Russia and took in prisoners.",

And, very little -- there was the --\nthere was more, I would say, there was even in -- even in the -- in the partisans, you\nknow, you felt like they call you some names. You know, the same.",
        "A: Oh yeah, they were f -- they were fair to me, because -- because they -- they appreciate\nmy work.

        "A: Well, here -- I came in Bialystok and Is -- I wind up -- so we stayed in Bialystok for\nabout maybe three or four months. And in Bialystok I met a girl, the first girl which was\nliberated from Auschwitz. This was in the beginning, 19 -- I think in the beginning --\nbeginning 1945. So, Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army, I think it was in --\nsometimes in \u201845 in January. Now, she came to Bialystok. She was a young girl and I met\nher there and she\u2019s the one told me that Proushinna was taken to Auschwitz. Otherwise I\nwouldn\u2019t e -- I wouldn\u2019t even know that they took -- you know, she told me, she just --\nshe was survivor from Auschwitz. S-So I told her, you know, don\u2019t go to Proushinna, I\u2019m\njust coming back from Proushinna. I can tell you who is there. She thought maybe you\nknow, maybe some survivor, something, you -- you know. So, some -- a few though -- I\nthink went back -- when they were liberated in 19 -- beginning 1945. I was in\nProushinna, but I know a few came to Proushinna. And some -- there 1s a -- there is still\nin Proushinna I would say, a community. I would say maybe a self -- some came back s --\nfrom Auschwitz and maybe they settled there. Some came back from the front. You\nknow, a lot of Proushinna maybe was in the Russian army, you know. So there is maybe\n50 Jews there, in the whole city.",

        "A: We a manats -- I mean that -- I mean she -- she was like a mother to me... Yeah... So, in\nBialystok, when I wrote a letter and that time I got in contact -- I was from the first --\nfrom the first -- you know, from the first survivors, we got -- they discovered about me,\nmy brother, that\u2019s the organization we\u2019re already operating in Bialystok, we had already\nfrom the -- from the Joint Distribution, we had all -- we had from -- from different kind\norganizations, not only Jewish organizations. It was a lot of -- it was at -- esta-established\nthe capital of Poland. So there was evil -- I didn\u2019t even know the evil was there in\nBialystok, so, oh you been sa -- partisan, I said par -- yes. Well, [indecipherable]. They\nwanted -- you know, there was no survivors, yet we didn\u2019t know about Auschwitz, we\ndidn\u2019t know -- the f -- we -- we didn\u2019t know where any concentration camp. So he says,\n\u201cDid you kept the diary?\u201d I -- I says, \u201cWhat diary?\u201d I says, \u201cNo.\u201d And they -- well they\nk-kept me there for couple weeks. They said, \u201cThink.\u201d You know, go home, something.\nThink and certain dates, pick certain dates. For instance, what did you do as -- in the\nregional part -- Jewish partisan, this -- you know, or that day -- or that day, a few days, or\n-- especially, you know, about -- they were interested in activities, about the life. And\nthey so -- I -- I\u2019ve -- that time, I told them the same story. You know, little bit more -- the\nsame story about the life in the ghetto, before the ghetto and all the same and I -- and --\nand -- and about my parents and -- and -- and they were especially interested about the\npartisan, Jewish li -- Jewish -- the activities, tell me. So I told them, ya -- that we were a\ngroup and -- and -- and we escaped the same -- the date we escaped and all this, the same\nstory of we did. How we organized, how we smuggled in this -- all this business and\nespecially and they were interested in the J -- Jewish group and then if we participated in\nany mission as Jewish group. So I told them yes, Je-Jewish beside that, we did\nparticipated. Like, I mentioned couple times that -- that we had those couple more\nmissions as a Jewish group. We went in near Proushinna and we had to get some -- you\nknow, we had to get some arms for the rest of the boys. We had a group of 60 there, you\nknow, some olders. Not everybody -- wh-when the ro -- this is before we joined, you\nknow, before we joined the Russian, but it was the -- it 1s -- we\u2019ll call itas--ac--a\ncommand s-structural command -- command from Russia, an order with discipline and\nall that. So, yeah we -- we participated in -- one time we went near Proushinna and -- and\nwe ambushed three German soldiers, we got three rifles, so we brought three rifles. This\nis beside -- beside what I participated from there. And especially this -- yeah, the\nactivities. And I mentioned m-most of it, but the main th -- I\u2019ve -- the main thing what I\ndidn\u2019t mention, in 1944, in May, we went through -- this is called -- a call -- a raid. A -- a\n-- this mission, destroy -- the Germans mobilized three divisions. One German division\nand two -- this was in 1945 and two Hungarians, because I didn\u2019t know the Hungarians\nwere allies for the -- the Hungarians, I think they -- they -- they allied -- they were with\nthe j -- with the -- and Ro -- and Romania and Hungaria, you know, they were allies for\nthe Germans. So they -- they -- th -- I mean, you know, they were in -- in the -- in\nGerman uniforms, though, in German uniform. And it came an order that we had to go\nthrough and clean them out once and for all. So it consisted from three divisions, 75,000\ns-strong. And they came in -- we knew already in advan -- you know, we had tiptoe if we\nhad lotake. We had good connection from the villages. And that time, 1t came an order\nfrom all the brigades, from all over stretching from this -- from eastern Poland, way up in\nLithuania, whatever, deep to the Russian territory, that we have to -- this was impor --\nimp -- that we, first of all, we have to mine all the roads and mine all the bridges. And\nwe're not going to get involved in the fight with them. There\u2019s no match, because tanks\nand -- and artillery, there\u2019s no match. But the first priority is to save the family -- family\nu -- the family we -- units. And that was a job. So, we had to take them out, way in the\nswamps, you know, hundreds of them. And we decided that -- that we going to -- we\ngoing to even mine the little roads where it leads to our bunkers and to our -- you know,\nwe had the -- the fields with the cows, everything was mined. We decided we\u2019re going to\nretreat in certain -- way up in the pinz -- the -- that -- that was swamps. So, in order to get\nint -- and in the swamps we had to go way up here in -- in mud, all the partisans. And\nsome of the -- you know, those -- those who couldn\u2019t make it -- we had to help the\nelderly and you know, we -- in advance -- so we whack away that first olea -- the f -- the\nfamily airtrads. Unfortunately there is only one occasion, there is one group, a family was\nabandoned, yeah. It was from the [indecipherable], I think it\u2019s 18. Well, so they and from\nall this, they went through the -- all the woods. They went in, they discovered our\nbunkers, they find everything. But -- they destroyed our cows, they destroyed our horses,\nthey blew out our bunkers and they destroyed our cemetery. We had a ce -- yeah, they\ndestroyed our cemetery. And not a single -- we retreated at -- and well, there was 17 from\nthe family which they found, unfortunate. It\u2019s -- we had very little -- th-there\u2019s very --\nand not much, I mean casualties, very small. But, de -- what I\u2019m saying, the big -- what\nthey -- that\u2019s all they could do is to destroy and -- and even to dis -- dis -- the cow there --\nkill the cows. They didn\u2019t take the cow, kill the cows, kill the horses and -- and -- and --\nand -- and blow up the bun -- blow up all the bunker. And eventually we came, you\nknow, they retreated. They retreated, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all and finally -- next -- this May --\nin June we were already -- in June we already -- we\u2019re already liberated. I mean they\nwere so desperate, they figure they will pull out the -- pull -- you know, they were\nretreating, they were s -- getting such a beating. You know, there\u2019s such a beating, you\nknow. Retreating in such a disarray, but it still -- they decided, well, we got to clean up --\nwe got to get those partisans -- to catch the partisans, yeah.",

And just for -- just for fun of it, sa -- that\u2019s all is I brought -- I brought a cow.\nSo he heard already, you know. I think -- I th -- I -- he heard that -- you know, he\u2019s on the\nway. They -- you know, from rumors, he\u2019s on the way to -- traveling with a cow, with a\ndoctor, with a nun.",
        "A: No, no. There was -- 1-1t was easy. You know that you -- like I say, you had that Jewish --\nthat\u2019s the Jewish o -- council there and you had organization and they -- it\u2019s -- I\u2019m afraid\n-- they -- they didn\u2019t know much about all the survivors, but they knew, you know, they\nknew who was in Bialystok, you know. If you want to look for somebody, you go in\nthere. And -- you know, had a -- a-anybody was registered right there, you -- from all\nthese -- from all the survivors. Mostly -- eventually, like when I came, there was still --\nyou know, there\u2019s still -- the c-camps were -- I did -- the camps were still -- Auschwitz\nwasn\u2019t even liberated. And -- and -- I didn\u2019t hear -- that\u2019s -- I didn\u2019t hear about\nAuschwitz, even in -- see -- even in the woods. You see, it was impossible sometimes -- I\nwould say to s -- there\u2019s never s -- never was an escapee from the camp. Speaking -- they\nhad -- they had -- they had not only Jews, they had, you know, prisoners, Poles and the\nRussians and they had Gypsies there, all. Sometime -- you weren\u2019t be able to escape from\nthere.",
        "A: Well, well, when I met the girl, the first girl from -- from Bialy -- the one in Bialystok, so\nI knew they went to Auschwitz. Now, I know they went to Auschwitz, so -- as a rule, you\nknow my sister was -- the -- you know, they was -- they were too young yet, you know,\nin Auschwitz the way the system, so they separated those -- those -- those who are able to\nwork yet, know -- women or men and th-they -- they weren\u2019t -- you know, I -- I -- I was\nsure that, you know, they went to the right or the left. They went to right, they went in the\ncrematorium. Because otherwise you know, you do -- would have known. I didn\u2019t expect\nmy mother -- I didn\u2019t expect -- the only thing I resent is -- you know, I could have -- if I\nwould know, know -- that\u2019s what -- if I would know, I -- ner -- I could have saved one\nsister. If she would be with me -- with us in the bunker, like some other strangers, she\nwould be -- she would survived. I mean, she would went through, see? Even though,\nwell, she was -- she was -- would have been 17 years old, a big girl -- a big girl, see? So\nit\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know, like I say, it\u2019s hard to say if you did the right thing or na -- if I did the\nright thing or the wrong thing, I wouldn\u2019t say -- I -- they let history say, I -- I couldn\u2019t say\nthe -- really, if it is the right thing. You know, I was asked -- I was asked this question. I\ndon\u2019t know, you know, if it\u2019s, yeah do I feel? That\u2019s -- how -- about -- you know, about\ngoing through all that. But I know one thing that, you know -- that it\u2019s important as a\nsurvivor that -- I have a duty to -- to tell this -- you know, to the story for the future --\nfuture generation.",
        "A: Oh no, I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, I -- right, I didn\u2019t. I -- the children knew a little, I -- I didn\u2019t because I was --\nI tried to -- I -- you know, I was raising a family, three children and I was in business and\nI worked hard and somehow, you know, I tried -- it was -- I tr -- I tried to -- not to\nadvertise. I mean my family knew, the children, you know. I wasn\u2019t advertise. I was\napproached a way -- I was approached a couple times by -- you know, when it comes --\nYom HaShoah or something and I -- from the television years ago. And I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nwant to re-really, you know, this twa -- the -- all the -- all the stories. Tried to -- I tried to,\nsomehow to make peace with that. Forget it and make peace.",
        "A: Well, I think my son influenced me, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he\u2019s active and I\u2019m glad\nabout that, yeah. He\u2019s active. He influenced me, he said, \u201cDad, you got to tell your\nstory.\u201d And finally up in public and this -- I started -- I wrote it in the -- in that -- first I\ngave him a chance. I didn\u2019t want to go to the papers. So, I figured for -- in Syracuse and I\ncame ri -- you know, fir -- all the -- came right to Syracuse and it\u2019s 50 years. I decided it\nwas 50 years, 194- -- 1994, 50 years liberation and, well maybe it\u2019s a time to say -- 50\nyears liberation. I was liberated in 1944 and this was 19 -- 1994, so I figured Pll write a\nlittle -- yeah. And -- and it was this -- the city was -- was shocked. They [indecipherable]\nI\u2019m the only -- they say the only -- we have quite a few and there is a lot -- I mean, and of\ncourse the -- it\u2019s already the -- all the ones -- a lot of them are gone, you know, are gone.\nHow many more years do I have? But as a rule, you know, I\u2019m the young one,\ncomparison -- I was only 20, you know when I -- 20 when I escaped, but if somebody\nwas 30 or 25 - 30 or 40, th -- you know, [indecipherable]. So they probably gone, they --\n[indecipherable] are gone.",
        "A: Oh well, the -- well, the Leaman -- we killed the Leaman brothers. That\u2019s -- you know, I\ntold you, we ki --",
        "A: I -- yeah, the Leaman brothers, you know, when we as -- we were assigned -- the\npartisans that time, we were strong together. We couldn\u2019t do it ourselves as a group. We\ncould never do that -- we didn\u2019t have the power and the ammunition to do that. But from\nan -- already being assigned to the brigade, so I told the commandeer and he said,\n\u2018\u201c\u201cHadashov we\u2019 ll -- let\u2019s try it.\u201d I says, \u201cWe got to get -- that\u2019s the easy job, to get this\nguy.\u201d Because he was -- he was a terrible Nazi. And I mean, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s worthwhile, so we\ngot him. And the second -- you mentioned that -- yeah, but of all this, yeah. I -- I found\nout about the rabbi. Now, there\u2019s a lot -- among the f -- 22 Jewish Judenrat, is -- only two\nsurvived -- you know, 20 perished in Auschwitz and two survived. One 1s in -- this --\nthey already both dead. They -- they all -- I mean, they survived. One was in United\nStates and one was in Israel. Now, they wrote the same thing at Yad Vashem, they wrote\ntheir stories. And the one 1s in -- the one was in the United States is as -- is Sagell. He\nwas the Foreign Minister. Now, he\u2019s -- before the war, he was ins -- in the business in\nDanzig, somehow in the export -- import you international. He s-speak fluently, German.\nAn intellectual, you know, educated man, they made him Foreign Minister. So he wrote\nsomething -- you know, we had a pinkus -- you call that a me -- a memorial book. From -\n- my story is from the -- is from the evewa -- you know, eva what -- what they --\neventually was printed in Israel in Yad Vashem. I didn\u2019t even know, I discovered that in\nthe 1950\u2019s, that they had evewa eventually printed at -- in Hebrew. I wrote it -- you\nknow, I wrote it in Yiddish and I had that in book in Yiddish. And -- and so this Sagell,\nhe was in charge about dealing and wheeling with the Burgermeister and all the\ntransports, where is -- was coming in and anything coming in in the ghetto -- outside the\nghetto, he was responsible, he was dealing direct with the -- with the Burgermeister, with\nthe SS. So, he says, from the Bialystok I came in -- that\u2019s what I -- what came in a\ntransfer from Bialystok, he had to receive them and they came in by truck. Because far --\nlike I say, some of them had to march -- they marched them. They brought in two hun --\n2000. It took about couple days. So, he says, here is -- you know, here is your shyser, you\ntake them in now. I don\u2019t know if you understand in German?",
        "A: Here is your shy -- the Jews what from Bialystok. Here is your shyser, take him in in the\nghetto. The shyser is partly -- you know what I mean in the shyser? Well, it\u2019s a -- kitty\nlitter [indecipherable]",
        "A: Here 1s -- you know, take -- here is your shyser, now you take him in. This is\n[indecipherable]. Now with the rabbi, this Leaman, I didn\u2019t know that -- you know, he\ntook the rabbi -- it was a lot of -- he took the rabbi, he used the rabbi and he told him --\nhe was a heavy man, a big man. And he to-to-to-told him, take the tallis and twirl it and\nhe told him to march and run, in the ghetto. Now, he was bribed many times. He was\ninterested -- he was so interested in the bribe, the big bribe. He knew he 1s going to get --\nhe -- he could have -- I mean, actually he could have shot the rabbi, he can do anything, I\nmean he had the power to do anything he want. But he probably wanted a big, big bribe.\nSo somebody noticed it, I didn\u2019t. You know, I didn\u2019t see it, but somebody noticed it in\nthe ghetto, you know. You know -- you know, \u201cThe ra -- they marching the rabbi,\nLeaman.\u201d So they had to bribe him and in order to release him, see? And what happened,\nhe -- he went to Auschwitz the same, he went to Auschwitz, the rabbi. But to them it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s f -- it\u2019s something unusual, right? But they ne -- he knew that it\u2019s\ngot a twa -- a tallis. They knew -- he\u2019s got twirling. I mean they -- they -- they learned,\nthe Jewish -- th-they -- the Jewish history so much, they knew more than I do, probably.",
        "A: Well...well, the -- well I -- well, what I would say, that m -- that the wor -- ye -- I mean,\nthe world should -- a lesson -- they should learn a lesson from the past, what can happen\nto a -- what can happen to a nation, it can happen to anybody, you know what I mean? It\nmeans -- it means that you have to f -- you have to f-fight and educate people and -- and -\n- and -- and hope -- and hope that -- that all those people who perished -- I would say\ndidn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t go in vain, what you call that. You know what I mean? And they -- that --\nthat... that\u2019s what happened, it happened. Not much [indecipherable] happened, but I\nhope it -- you know, it\u2019s -- they sacri -- they should [indecipherable] sacrifice, they\nshouldn\u2019t happen such a Holocaust again.
