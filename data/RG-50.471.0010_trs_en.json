There was a\nbanner on--on the side of the train--uh the cars\nwh--which carried watermelons. Lithuania was an agri-\ncultural country, we never lacked for any food or\nwatermelons at that point; for that uh.\nEverybody had to uh fall in step with the Russian\nphilosophy of life uh because we were uh business\npeople; my parents that is.

So anti-Semitism was rampant in Lithuania uh\nthey didn't need encouragement of Germans to act out\nthere anger or frustration or whatever it was uh or\nhatred for the Jews. During the period I was--uh I can\nrecall, I--there were no Pogroms that I was aware at\nleast not in Kovno itself. Perhaps there may\nhave been in some of the smaller towns.

And uh they wanted to consoli-\ndate us in--into one area so we were all made to move.\nThere was one building that was a hospital building.\nQuote unquote uh it wasn't a real hospital. It was\njust a hospital where pe--sick people were kept. And I\nremember seeing that was on fire. Uh I thinking in\nterms that uh some of the people that were in that\nhospital were not allowed to leave. So they might have\nbeen burned in the building alive. But that's my\nsurmise.

Uh my brother,\nmother, uh my father and myself and there aren't maybe\na total of like uh maybe 15 people in that uh one floor\nOr apartment that we were in.

Uh, there was one area which\nwaS a main square like where the gate from the ghetto\nuh was uh. And people use to have to assemble there to\ngo into work brigades. My brother, my father being one\nof them. They uh assembled in the morning. They were\nmarched out and uh--uh we were standing at night--in\nevening rather waiting for him to come back and hoping\nthat they would come back and in some cases they some\nof them did not.

Uh, fortunately\nfor us because what my brother and my father who were\nyoung and robust people uh were redeemed to be of\nwork--of labor quality and so the whole family unit\nincluding the two strange women, heh, that latched on\nto us uh managed to be selected into the side that\nsurvived. The other side were apparently taken to\nuh--uh what I understand is to be a Fort in where they\nwere shot. At least that's the story that I--I recall.\nUh so that was uh very trying time for us anda very\ndramatic experience. Uh, there was another time when\nwe had an assembly uh were all of us were forced to\ngather around a big place and there was a uh a scaf-\nfold, a hanging scaffold and there was a man being\nbrought out and we were forced to watched uh to the\nscaffold. And the reason presumably that he was going\nto be executed, hanged. That they uh was that they\nfound some kind of a weapon on him. And uh I remember\nuh being made to watch this uh where they put him up on\na box I believe with his hands and legs tied, I think.\nUh and they kicked out the box from under him. A\nGerman soldier did that and he was hanging. The things\nyou remember as a child is that uh--uh urine was coming\ndown his leg as he was wriggling on--on--on the\nnoose--on the rope.

Uh, I\nremember that uh there was a cobbler who use to make uh\nboots and uh the German officers to come to uh have\nboots custom made for them and the uh we watched that\nand uh it was uh an impression that made uh me, was\nthat even in the ghetto, if you had any kind of skill\nor craft, uh you could survive better than anybody\nelse. So that gave me the philosophy in life that uh\nwhat I have in my brain, and my skills and my abili-\nties, nobody can take away, while all material things\ncan be taken away.

It\nwas in the summer I believed. We stripped our clothing\noff, intentionally to be able to stay there. And the\nair was foul and uh there was no toilet facilities.\nUh, it became very very difficult to just exist in that\nenvironment. We heard commotions outside; Germans\nrunning around shouting the Uden Roust, you know.\nWorstatefect and Verchaust and uh there were some\nchildren who were crying in--in the basement uh, I\nguess the mothers or fathers tried to shut them up so\nthat they wouldn't be heard but apparently somebody did\nhear commotion or suspected one, found a trap door and\ndropped a grenade down.
