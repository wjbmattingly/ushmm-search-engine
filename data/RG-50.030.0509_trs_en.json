This interview is made possible by a grant from\nCarol and Maurice Burke. This is tape number one, side A. Mrs. Green, would you please begin\nby telling me your full name and when and where you were born.",
        "Answer: My name is Ann Green, I was born in Austria at -- and I was born on August the 28\",\n1925.",
        "Q: And where exactly were you born in Austria?",
        "A: In a -- in a town outside [indecipherable] maybe 50 miles outside, maybe more, it\u2019s\nNeunkirchen. I -- want me to spell it?",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. What -- what was your name at birth?",
        "A: Preis, P-r-e-i-s.",
        "Q: And did you have any other names that you used during the war time?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So, can you tell me a little bit about your parents, their names, and any siblings?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Josephine, my father\u2019s name was Berthold, my brother\u2019s name was\nIgnatz. He never used the name, he hated it.",
        "Q: What name did he use?",
        "A: I -- he was called Bushy, that\u2019s an Austrian expression, little boy. And so he never really used\nit, only on pape-- on documents and so on.",
        "Q: And tell me a little bit about the personalities of the members of your family, your father,\nyour mother, your brother. Tell -- give me a little picture of each one of them.",
        "A: They were -- how shall I say it? In my -- in -- as -- as a child looking at them, just normal\npeople, if [indecipherable]. I really ca -- 1-it\u2019s very hard to say, you know, what -- because you\u2019re\nlooking at it as a child. They\u2019re just ple -- nice, normal people.",
        "Q: You know, a lot of siblings have naturally, you know, some kind of sibling rivalry. Did you\nget along very well with your brother?",
        "A: [indecipherable] I was, you know, sibling rivalry, I would y -- tease him. If I really wanted to\nhurt him I called him by his name. But that was about the extent of it, I mean, we didn\u2019t -- one\nday he -- I locked him up in the room, an -- and he said he\u2019s going to jump out the window and I\nsaid go ahead. But that\u2019s not -- so anyway, we -- you know, there was really not -- he was four\nyears younger than I am, and -- so there was not this much rivalry.",
        "Q: And tell me more about your parents. Did they run a strict household, and also what kind of\nwork did your father do and your mother, did she work?",
        "A: No, my mother didn\u2019t, but my father was in the scrap metal and then he wheeled and dealed. I\nca -- really, it\u2019s very interesting that I cannot really remember, because I was very young. Was a\nnormal child, not interested in anything but myself. And -- so it\u2019s very difficult to say. I can\u2019t\nreally remember, you know, that it wa -- that something really would have impressed me, or\ninterest me. All I was interested is having -- you know, playing and that\u2019s it. So --",
        "Q: Were your parents strict at home?",
        "A: Yes, and no. You know, European parents, I mean, they would be going to jail here. But no,\nthey -- it -- just a normal family life. My father -- when we lived in outs -- in Neunkirchen, my\nfather commuted from Vienna for awhile, and then we moved. So -- but it was a nor -- it was a\nnormal, average life, we can compare the middle class life to America.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about whatever memories you have of this first town that you were living\nin, where you were born.",
        "A: I remember playing with -- having a friend, which was very interesting. Then, of course, I had\nno clue whose -- all her brothers were in the par -- in the party, the Nazi party, had pictures up of\nHitler and all. And here she was my playmate. I mean, we were four years old -- four or five\nyears old, and I remember that, but otherwise -- and we were good friends, we\u2019d -- she would\ncome to my house, I\u2019d go to her house. And that -- you know, the parents never said you can\u2019t\nplay with her or anything. And -- but I do remember the pictures because you know, it was\nsomething different with the -- the emblem, the colors and whatever else.",
        "Q: Was it something that made you uncomfortable in some way?",
        "A: I couldn't really -- I mean, I noticed it, because you know, we knew what was going on in\nGermany, but Germany couldn\u2019t be compared to Austria because in Germany the Jews, though\nthey were persecuted, they were not to that extent. They still had a more or less, if you can call it\nnormal life, existence. And that\u2019s all they really [indecipherable] five si -- four or five years per -\n- no, five -- five, six maybe, and that\u2019s it. So --",
        "Q: So this is when you moved to Vienna?",
        "A: Vienna, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So tell me about the transition, moving to Vienna.",
        "A: What do you mean living together?",
        "Q: Oh, the transition, moving from this smaller town to -- to going to the big city of Vienna.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t that small a tow -- it was a city, but really not. Adjusted. You know, moved,\nadjusted. I was -- my parents -- I was taken care of. And what are children interested in, right?\nYou make new friends. And we had family living in Vienna, broth -- my father\u2019s brother was\nliving in Vienna, and I had a cousin. So, you know, the transition wasn\u2019t that great. You are in\nthe same country, you are speaking the same language, so it doesn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t make this -- there\nwasn\u2019t this great an impact.",
        "Q: Did you like living in Vienna?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What are some of your fonder memories?",
        "A: Just -- I really -- a nor -- a very normal life until 1938, and I remember that. I was -- I\nhappened to go to the movies, and this was Jeanette MacDonald, which is long before your time,\nand was May time and here the troops were marching in and they were -- the people were there\nwith open ha -- hands and hearts to wo -- welcome them. And here I just loo -- you know, to me\nit was just a movement of troops. We knew there was something going on, but nobody really had\na concept what will be ahead. Because everything was looked at from Germany, and the people\nwho came from Germany. We happened to know -- my father happened to know somebody who\ncame from Berlin, and the things -- the stories he told weren\u2019t that hair raising, so we really -- it\nreally became bad after the anschluss, so --",
        "Q: And that\u2019s the day when you were at the movies, that you\u2019re remembering?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah. It was -- it was in May, I don\u2019t remember the date, but I know it was in May of\n\"38.",
        "Q: And what did you associate with, you know, what came right after, or what did you think was\nstarting to happen right after this? Did you know much?",
        "A: Nobody -- nobody knew. Nobody had a concept. I mean, nobody could unders -- you know,\nnobody knew that na -- I mean, they were -- the Austrians welcomed the invasion, what they call\ninvasion, with open arms, and there was -- I's -- I presume now, looking back, there was a lot of\npoverty, there was a lot -- there wi -- you know, people that didn\u2019t have -- there was no work, so\n-- and the Austrians isn\u2019t, by nature, are not very pri -- used to be -- not a very productive person.\nAs long as they had three meals, or four meals, and didn\u2019t have to extend themselves, that was\ntheir outlook in life. And so here they felt, you know, they were -- they were going to get\nsomething, because what did Hitler do? He took it from Peter, gave it to Paul. I mean, he took\nthe businesses away, and so consequently the people suddenly became business owners, and\nstarted ye -- regardless if it had the ability or not, they started the middle class life, so to say, and\nwere very happy with it.",
        "Q: So if we could go back a little bit to -- prior to the anschluss --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- just to get a little bit better picture of your home life.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: If you could give me just -- sort of set the scene and give like a physical description of your\nhome as you recall it, in Vienna.",
        "A: Well, we had a -- we had -- we had a -- two, three bedroom apartment in -- on the third\ndistrict, and it\u2019s very hard to describe. It was just a normal apartment and a normal -- what you\nwould call an American -- equal in to an American life. Not -- not -- I -- I really don\u2019t know how\nto describe it to you. Just a very normal life, which abruptly ended, and we got notice that we\nwere going to be relocated, that\u2019s what the -- would be call -- and we knew when, and we were lo\n-- no, we were relocated in -- we -- into an apartment and we stayed there with another family\nand their daughter. It was really a storefront, an apart -- and a -- and a room, and a kitchen. And\nmy mother, father, my brother and I lived in the storefront, and this other couple, who were very\nelderly and their daughter lived in the back. And this is how we started our new life, so to say,\nuntil we got notice that we\u2019re going to be relocated, and at that point we all left. And my father\nhappened to have a friend who was not Jewish, and who was an illegal member of the party, and\nhe send him a postcard, and he said, if you need me, call me, I\u2019m there. And my father called\nhim. He -- he -- he became the director of the sanitarium.",
        "Q: Do you know his name?",
        "A: Yeah, his name was Kittel, K-1-t-t-e-l. And his wife was esn -- his wife\u2019s name was Mia, he --\nhis was Leo. And they -- I stayed with them. I was this -- I was the niece from the German\nspeaking part of Czechoslovakia, from Barin. And I stayed with them for many, many months\nand my father and mother found a place, and for awhile my brother was with them, and then he\nmoved with -- to Mariani and her husband. Mariani is a friend of ours, was a friend of my\nfather\u2019s, and her husband. And they ca -- when they had to vacate their apartment, they were\ngoing to be relocated so to speak, they came to us and they stay -- they stayed in the kitchen, and\nevery time the chimney sweep would come, they had to get up and come into the -- come into\nour room and stay with us, because he came in the back, or the front, whatever you want to call\nit. And my br -- as I said, this is -- I\u2019m mixing the whole thing up.",
        "Q: So may -- so maybe we can get the chronology here. So the first time you moved from your\noriginal home in Vienna --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: That was something you did not because of a -- a relocation order, or was it?",
        "A: Right, I -- I ca -- you know what? I really don\u2019t remember how it came about that we had to\nvacate, and we sold our -- the furniture and everything was sold, and we moved into this\nstorefront. I don\u2019t know how -- how the whole thing came to be, and --",
        "Q: And what age are you about, at that time?",
        "A: Iwas 13.",
        "Q: And so what year is this?",
        "A: [indecipherable] maybe I was -- I must have been older, about f-four -- maybe 14 -- 14 - 15.",
        "Q: And was -- was this actually one of the first places where you were 1n hiding, or were you still\nliving --",
        "A: No, no, no, we ju -- we still lived a so-called normal existence. And we were there until \u201941. I\nthink we moved there in \u00b040 -- in \u00b040, and we were there in \u00b041, and then we were being re --\nsuppose -- relocated, and that\u2019s when we went into hiding.",
        "Q: What did you know, if anything, about the relocation order? Did you know anything?",
        "A: It -- 1t was all underground cr -- grapevine, so to speak, you know, you -- you heard, you\nknow, people found out, they told you that this and this street will be next, so you were alerted to\nit by -- by people who knew, and --",
        "Q: So it sounds like even before you got the actual order --",
        "A: No, no, no, no, you went before, you know, you had to go before. In fact, we had a\nsuperintendent who was very, very good to us, and Mariani and her husband stayed in her\nfather\u2019s apartment, and he gave them a little room to stay there, hiding. And the woman, the\ndaughter of the people who lived in the same apartment as we did, went there to sleep every\nnight, she had -- she -- he let her sleep next to him in his bed. I mean, when you think about it\nnow, the situations were such, as I\u2019m recounting them I can\u2019t really believe it, because I\u2019m\ntelling it to you and I say, if people will listen to this, what will they think? So -- and then of\ncourse, when we got notice to leave, you know, that we were being picked up, or rounded up, or\nS -- we -- we left. And at one point we stayed, we -- we moved right in next door with Mariani\nand her husband, and when they came for us we could hear them through the wall, because they -\n- they came in and, you know, they were looking for us. And my brother had parakeets, h -- in\nthe storefront window. And those birds -- you know, they came in and they made a lot of noise,\nof course, and those parakeets started to screech, and whatever. We could hear all this. And of\ncourse they were they -- you know, they realized that we left, we left everything but what we\nreally needed, and went. And that was it. And wi --",
        "Q: But you were just next door, and -- and somebody could have found you very easily?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean they -- if they had no clue that we -- they would have never, ever thought\nthat we would be -- there would be anybody next door. So -- it was an adjacent apartment, so --\nand then of course we had to leave because people in the building wouldn\u2019t -- knew us, and\npeople in the neighborhood knew us, so we really had to vacate and find another place to stay.\nAnd then we just started traveling from place to place, whoever would take us, we would stay\nwith, you know, whatever length of time we could. Because you had to be very careful, because\nif you stayed -- the law over there wa -- was or is that when you are -- I think it was a week, you\nhad to go to police, and report that you are living there. So if anybody would have seen us, or --\nor -- you know, for any length of time, that will be a tip off [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So, if I have this correctly, that\u2019s really when you first went into hiding --",
        "A: Hiding, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and this is 1941, we think, and this is when you moved next door to the storefront --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- that\u2019s really the --",
        "A: I mean, this is the -- we had no -- we had no -- we didn't know where we are going to be, and\nso this was the only place we could be for the -- for the day or two, or I -- I can\u2019t remember how\nlong we stayed there. It wasn\u2019t long because it was one of those very small rooms, and so we\nreally didn't know how long we\u2019re going to be there, or wa -- we were there, we just -- my father\nfound a place for me, and my brother then went with Mariani. And I can\u2019t remem -- you know,\nthey just -- he -- she took him and I went to this friend of my father\u2019s and I stayed there. I stayed\nthere for many, many months, and then I changed to other places, and eventually ended up with\nMariani when they -- when -- because every so often I would leave, and then a couple months\nlater come back to the same place. And that was really a -- you know, it was -- 1 -- you were\nnever any length of time, so to speak. We had one very -- was a very weird thing, I don\u2019t know\nhow, when and where, I don\u2019t remember that any more, but there was an SR man who took us in.\nIn fact, he took Mariani, her husband, me, my brother, and we stayed there. And he had -- he had\na party, and the woman who was living -- the -- the daughter of the people who were living there,\nwent and she was -- she served -- she served them. And her name was Whittler, and she -- you\nknow, she would walk in and she would say, heil Whittler. You know, she would name her --\nyou -- she would say her name. Nobody could understand. And here she was, she was -- wore a\nlittle -- she was a huge person, and she was a little outfit -- you know, one of those serving\nthings, a little [indecipherable]. I mean, those are the -- the funny -- the funny things, but we\nstayed there for a little while and his wife, for some reason -- she was British, and she resented it,\nand we had to move, and Mariani, my brother, and her husband moved and I stayed. I was the\nnursemaid.",
        "Q: But this is the man who was part of the SA?",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And how is it that he was willing to take you in?",
        "A: Yeah, he used to be -- when I stayed with this friend of my father and mother, he used to\ncome and visit me, which was very welcome, because he would come in full uniform, you know,\nand he would walk -- come in -- he always came in through the back, through the garden, he\nwould -- you know, so everybody could see him. And they lived in a private house, and that was\nvery welcome, you know, they -- they wanted him to come to see, you know, so --",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Spiegel. It was a really, when you sp -- a really -- you would think it\u2019s a Jewish name, but he\nwasn\u2019t. Maybe he was and we didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But you felt safe with him?",
        "A: Oh yeah. No, I mean, he was -- he -- as I said, he was very nice. And then his wife -- 1t was --\nthe place was so cold -- they didn't heat the upstairs, the water froze in the water picture. I would\nget undressed under the cover, and then in the morning I would take all my clothes, put them\nunder the cover, warm them up and get dressed again. It was terribly cold there beca -- why?\nBecause they didn\u2019t heat their upstairs. And the -- and the interesting part was her father lived\nupstairs too.",
        "Q: Now, I know we\u2019 ve kind of jumped ahead to a lot of the experiences in hiding. I wanted to\njust step back and -- and try to jog your memory a little, I know you were very young right after\nthe anschluss. At that stage, how old are you?",
        "A: I think 14. I wa -- the anschluss was 13, I was 13.",
        "Q: So I know you\u2019re still pretty young.",
        "A: I mean it was -- it was a [indecipherable] -- how long -- yeah.",
        "Q: 1938.",
        "A: 1938 I was 13.",
        "Q: Right. So -- but I wanted to go back a little --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- and just to make sure we have a full understanding. Tell me the role of religion in your\nfamily\u2019s life before the anschluss.",
        "A: Well, we went to Sunday school, went to Hebrew school. At one point I could really read, and\nI could write. In Europe, if you were Jewish, they didn't let you forget it. So you were\nConservative, because at that point there was no Reform. And that is it, you know, that\u2019s the\nextent of it.",
        "Q: Did you have certain favorite holidays?",
        "A: All of them, because we always got new clothes. That was a -- almost like a ritual. Not that\nwe didn\u2019t have anything to wear before, but -- but the holidays we wer -- we always got new\nclothes. And it took me awhile here not to buy anything new for the holidays.",
        "Q: And you have fond memories. Did you have in your home the Passover Seder and --",
        "A: Yes, we had Seders which lasted forever. And I remember my grandmother being alive, and\nmy brother was little -- he was little and she wouldn\u2019t let him be fed in -- in the house because it\nwas Passover, Mother had to go to the neighbor to feed him. That ar -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s so weird how\nyou remember things. And so, remember changing the dishes and cleaning up and whatever. And\n-- which when -- you know, was -- is a pleasant memory, which the children really today don\u2019t\nhave, only if you\u2019re really Conservative, or Orthodox.",
        "Q: And did you -- did you speak Yiddish at home, did you learn other languages?",
        "A: No, no, no. We were what they would call assimilated Jews, you know [indecipherable] that -\n- that probably, I mean I don\u2019t know it was a problem or not. But European Jews as a -- as a rule,\nwere assimilated. He -- it -- it\u2019s only the population which made you understand that you are\nJewish.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: But they do the same thing here.",
        "Q: How was it for you as a child, this idea that you knew you were Jewish, especially in relation\nto non-Jews? You know, what -- what -- what happened? Any incidents you remember?",
        "A: Not -- how shall I say? After the anschluss is -- there was a teacher, she was really anti-\nSemitic and she would -- I can\u2019t really reme -- I remember she made a remark about the Jews in\nclass, that I remember. But I ca -- I wouldn\u2019t be able to remem -- remi -- remember what it was.\nAnd no, anti-Semitism in -- in Europe was -- how shall I say? Like here. It was there, you knew\nit. If you really would ha -- if you wanted to be killed, you would tell them that Jesus is a Jew. I\nmean, that was the worst thing you could have ever done, and nobody would ever do that, okay?\nBut you were always aware that you were Jewish, but for some reason, tha -- my attitude and my\nfamily\u2019s attitude was, they\u2019re ignorant people, and I\u2019m abo -- we are above it. And that\u2019s how\nyou survived. I mean, it wasn\u2019t as -- it -- anti-Semitism in Europe I think was more -- more open\nthan here. But whenever the church becomes powerful, then -- then it does not lead to good.",
        "Q: What about one on one friendships? Did you have mostly Jewish friends, also non-Jewish\nfriends?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we had non-Jewish friends, I had non-Jewish friends. My father most certainly\nhad non-Jewish friends. And they would say, you\u2019d -- you -- you are not like the -- like other\nJews, you\u2019re a different Jew. I mean, that shows you their ignorance. And of course we did not |\n-- we didn\u2019t look Jewish. My mother had red hair, blue eyes, I had blue eyes. So, you know, we\nweren't -- we weren\u2019t looked upon as -- as the -- the typical portrait Jew. But most -- I mean,\nmost European Jews didn\u2019t look what they were supposed to look, or what they wanted them to\nlook. So that\u2019s really it.",
        "Q: What about school? Were you in public school, and what kind of memories --",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: -- do you have fond memories of school?",
        "A: I do -- I di -- I think the whole thing is overshadowed by the -- by the rest of the -- my life.\nSo, you know, I went to school. I know that I would ep -- bring matzo to school. And I would go\nto school on Saturday and not write, okay. But otherwise, school was school, okay.",
        "Q: Did you go to synagogue every week with your family?",
        "A: No, no. Holidays, just like -- you know. Loved to go to si -- I loved to go because it was\nConservative and you had to be upstairs. And for the holidays, as a kid, you could\n[indecipherable] downstairs and of course when there was [indecipherable] you were outside,\nand you went out to play. And you know, it was really -- it is -- was the same type of life as a mi\n-- as a middle class family you lived here. I mean, there was really not that much difference. So\nit\u2019s very, you know, it\u2019s very -- it -- it\u2019s a very long time. So you really don\u2019t remember, or\nmaybe you choose not to, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What do you remember about any changes at school after the anschluss?",
        "A: Way -- there was no school.",
        "Q: When -- when did that happen?",
        "A: I think in -- well, there was no school from \u201941 on, because we went in -- you know, there was\nno school from 1941 on. So I basically had very little education. As I told my son once, I went to\nthe university of life. So that\u2019s that.",
        "Q: And did you miss school, or you had so many other concerns by this time?",
        "A: You know, there was so -- there was so many other things going that going to school never\nreally -- I don\u2019t think it ent -- I can\u2019t say it never, but I don\u2019t think it ever entered my mind,\nbecause the -- you know, to survive was the most important thing.",
        "Q: Now you, at this age clearly understood that -- that to survive, that -- that you are in a\nparticularly challenging position as -- as a Jewish child to survive.",
        "A: Right. Yeah, no the -- that you realized, I mean, you know, that you real -- you realized it and\nI didn\u2019t because at -- we were, you know, at that time we were still able to move around the city,\nthough we wore the emblem.",
        "Q: When did you st --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen. This is tape number one, side B. So we were doing a little bit of backtracking and -- and\ntalking about after the anschluss, if -- if -- we were at the end of the other side of the tape, if you\ncould just tell me again when approximately you think you started wearing the Jewish star, and\nalso what other things started happening that seemed very different?",
        "A: Well, my mother was pulled out to go clean the streets, scrub the streets, I was with her. My\nfather had to go shovel snow, and at random th -- I think we started to wear the star in \u201939, and of\ncourse when we were hiding we had to take it off. And we -- you know, you mov -- at that time\nyou were still able to move around with your star, you know, able to cre -- come and go. Once\nyou took it off you just had to be careful not to meet anybody who knew you, and maybe would\nalert them that you\u2019re still around.",
        "Q: Did you run into people you knew a lot anyway in Vienna? And how did people respond to\nyou wearing the star, do you remember?",
        "A: No, no, because we moved out of the district, and it was real sheer chance that you don\u2019t meet\nsomebody. You had to be very careful, and you had to be very alert, and it was a -- a very, very\ndifficult, very -- very hard to relate, because basically, living here -- I mean being an American,\nor in any country, if you haven\u2019t experienced it, it\u2019s really not something one can understand. As\nI always say, if I say my shoe hurts, until yours hurts, you don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t really -- you\nknow, you say, oh yes. But it\u2019s very, very difficult because it was just a -- a -- something you\ncan\u2019t comprehend. And you just do the best you can.",
        "Q: Do you think as a teenager you actually started f -- you know, feeling real fear? What -- what\ndo you think you felt back then?",
        "A: Well, fear is -- was the thing which was always with you, or maybe caution. I don\u2019t know if\nyou understand fear. Fear is only when you are exposed to it, you know, when you face it. But\nbeing -- you were always conscious and you always knew and you -- of course you were afraid\nthat you are being found out. So you don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t live with f -- I don\u2019t think\nyou live with fear, you live with the -- with the thought of hoping that it will -- 1t will be over\nsoon.",
        "Q: Now during this time, first of all we see the -- I mean, what are the things that you\u2019re seeing\non the streets? Are you seeing Jewish stores, you know, things happening to stores and\nsynagogues, and what do you remember about those sorts of incidents?",
        "A: Well, the stores were da -- you know, defaced, and they wrote Jew on it, and the stores were\nbeing taken over by people tha -- you know, the party gave the stores to -- to everybody whom\nthey thought was worthwhile being in the party, or whatever. And it -- it was just something you\ncan\u2019t -- y-you can\u2019t really retell because that\u2019s [indecipherable] store things happen, and you\ntook them -- that\u2019s the way it was, okay you -- as long as you were -- the drive to survive was to\nbe invisible. And th-that\u2019s all you really could do to survive, especially when you were hiding. I\nmean, if you walked around with the star, if somebody didn't like your face, they could do\nanything to you, whatever they wanted to, you were only a Jew. So you were expandable.",
        "Q: What do you remember about Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Just hearing about it, because you weren't present. But I remember as the story goes, my\nmother came from Grodz, which is [indecipherable]. And they took the rabbi there, and they had\nhim -- they held him over the -- the river which goes through town, with a [indecipherable] you\nknow, 0-on the bridge, they held him there, just to scare him, they didn\u2019t throw him over. I mean,\nyou ni -- you\u2019re not -- you -- you\u2019re seeing something, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re hearing something which\nis really not -- which one can\u2019t comprehend, because they weren't human. It\u2019s like today, we\nhaven\u2019t learned. We really haven\u2019t learned. So --",
        "Q: And do you think as a teenager you comprehended what was happening at the time?",
        "A: Not really, no. Because I -- when I was a teenager, sometimes I did things you wouldn\u2019t\nbelieve.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: Like what? I had -- I had a boyfriend who was -- who did not need to wear the star. I didn\u2019t\nwear it, I was already in hiding. We\u2019d go to the city, we\u2019d go like teenagers here, okay? At that\npoint I was 18 -- 17 -- 18. We\u2019d go to a -- we\u2019d go to a restaurant, we go -- you know. One day I\nwent to buy a birthday present for my mother, and I left in the morning and I came back in the\nlate afternoon. And I remember like today, at that time they had umbrellas, and they had a cu --\nthey were regular umbrellas like the little ones now, they had a [indecipherable] and a -- was a\nlea -- it was all of leather. When I came in my father took it and ch-chased me. Because, I mean,\nthink. There was no phone, there was no way, but you know, you\u2019re a teenager. What -- what is -\n- what is the problem, you know? You\u2019re having a good time.",
        "Q: And did you feel like you were a little bit invincible as -- you know, as some teenagers feel?",
        "A: I think youth is. I -- I always said when I had children, I hope -- I have to remember what I\ndid when I was a child or a teenager, and that will help me survive. I\u2019m a survivor by nature.",
        "Q: Well, you were a little bit of an adventurer it sounds like.",
        "A: Well, I was a teenager. I was not -- I don\u2019t think I was any different than teenagers today. But\n-- and you -- you don\u2019t think what the consequences. I mean, if they would have caught me, they\nwould have caught my parents. I mean, a whole family, and an extended family would have\ngone. Never gave it a thought.",
        "Q: And what were the conversations like at home if your father was upset for instance that one\nday? What -- what were the kind of conversations you were having at that time?",
        "A: Like what?",
        "Q: You know, were you talking about strategies or plans for what you would do next, and what --\nwhat was -- did you talk about the war?",
        "A: [indecipherable] you -- you lived day by day. You -- you couldn\u2019t plan, because you don\u2019t --\nyou didn\u2019t know what is going to happen. At one point, when I stayed with Mariani, I had to\nleave during the day so I got a place to stay at during the day, I became the maid. And her hus --\nand they were very nice people, but her husband apparently wasn\u2019t too bright. One day he called\nand he said, this is the gover -- some government calling, and they know that he is -- he\u2019s hiding\nsomebody and they\u2019re going to come over and get me. Well, I cleared out of there so fast I must\nhave -- I must have run I don\u2019t know how many miles, just -- and that was in the inner city, and I\n-- we lived in the outskirts. And I never gi -- went back there. He thought it was a great joke,\nokay?",
        "Q: He was just kidding?",
        "A: Yeah, he was kidding. You know, he was -- he wanted to know if it -- and at th -- and th --\nyou couldn\u2019t walk a -- you had to be very careful. I couldn\u2019t use the vacuum cleaner because\neverybody knew they went to work in the morning, so there was nobody supposed to be in their\nhouse. So -- I mean, 1 -- totally stupid. You know, not -- thoughtless, and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: I\u2019m just going to take a break.",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "Q: Tell me what happened to your father\u2019s business.",
        "A: It just dissipated, it dissipated, you know, and that was it. That I understand. So -- and then he\n-- my father knew a lot of -- lot of people and he would a -- he was able to -- you know, there\nwas a lot of selling and buying, and -- and he knew a lot of -- he had a lot of non-Jewish friends,\nand that\u2019s what he did. You know, as mu -- as -- as well as he could. And that\u2019s how we\nsurvived, I suppose, to a certain degree.",
        "Q: Did anything happen to the synagogue where your family went?",
        "A: Yeah, they burned it down. They burned it down.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of it?",
        "A: No, no, no. The only temple which stayed in 1s -- was not destroyed, I think, was the -- I can\u2019t\nremember the name now, it just escaped me. The main synagogue in Vienna, in the first district,\nyou know? I think -- no, 1t wasn't central, central is here.",
        "Q: So what do you remember about the actual beginning of the war in 1939? Were you hearing\nmuch in the way of news?",
        "A: Yeah, we would hear, and of course we also listened to the voice of America. And you know,\nthe grapevine, it -- 1t -- and the circles my father traveled in, there was always news, but you\nknow, you really -- it -- everything went so fast, and everything was so new, that people really\ndid not -- I mean, did not comprehend. I mean, we had people aba -- when we still lived in the\nstorefront, people would come to our house, they put coffee, for after dinner co -- after dinner --\nthe main meal in Europe was lunch. And they would come and have coffee and debate and talk\nand th -- you know, for naught. And, you know, so we are -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s something really you --\nyou -- you rethink, and you re -- even today when I think, or when I\u2019m talking to Mariani, the\ninteresting part about it is that we were able to lead a normal life, to the norm of norm. But -- so\nyou can\u2019t real -- you know, when I look back, it\u2019s -- you ju -- 1t just became -- you -- this 1s what\nyou were confronted with, and that\u2019s what you had to make the best of it.",
        "Q: You sort of adjusted your concept of what was normal, it seems.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, you tr -- you know, you had to, because otherwise you couldn\u2019t survive. You cou\n-- you know, you would -- you would just waste your -- your energy and strength, which I\nsuppose you subconsciously realized that you shouldn\u2019t do. Oh, I\u2019m so far away from you, I\u2019m\nSOITY.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. All right, so I wanted to know what you were hearing about people being\ndeported at this time. What -- what sort of --",
        "A: We --",
        "Q: -- information did you have, if any?",
        "A: We knew that there was Theresienstadt, and -- but we really didn\u2019t know what it -- what it\nwas. My parents were deported. My parents were caught. How, when and where, I don\u2019t know,\nbut this friend I had who was Romanian, he did not have to wear a star, so he had more entry into\nplaces, and he found out that they were deported. He was supposed to meet my father, and\napparently didn\u2019t, because they caught them, and they went to Theresienstadt, and at one point\nyou could send food to Theresienstadt. If they got it, we never knew. But we could go to\ndifferent -- different districts, and mail whatever we could spare or get together, and mail it to\nthem. And then, of course, they stopped that. So I don\u2019t know if they ever received it or not.",
        "Q: When you were still with your parents, and things were changing though, of course, after the\nanschluss, did you -- I know you\u2019 ve talked about having an optimistic outlook --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and hoping that things would change for the better soon.",
        "A: Yeah, but my father -- my father felt this not going to -- this is not going to last, I mean,\npeople would -- they -- because he had so many non-Jewish friends, he -- he never really\nunderstood either that it could last this long, or anybody could even contemplate anything like\nthat. So --",
        "Q: Do you think you picked up your optimistic attitude from your parents?",
        "A: Probably. Probably. I mean, my father felt, you know, why emigrate. And probably, when I\nthink about it now, he was in his early 50\u2019s, he had two young children, and a wife, and I --\nprobably was afraid, which is very possible. And as I said, really not understanding the -- the\npower. So, he -- we were going to -- I think 1t was Nicorag -- one of those South American\ncountries, and -- but it never materialized. It was always on the edge, you know, we were going\nto go in two weeks, okay? And then it dissipated. So we never really -- as I said, he -- it was not -\n- he -- he just didn\u2019t have his heart to go.",
        "Q: What about your mother? How did she react?",
        "A: You know, European wives are more -- we are going back 60 years, 70 years, so it\u2019s, you\nknow, whatever he felt. And Is -- I suppose she wasn\u2019t as keen to -- to relocate either. You\nknow, you heard -- and then, of course, it stopped, you know. America closed down, and -- I\nmean, th -- a lot of my -- my brother -- my father\u2019s brother went to Poland, okay, the one in\nHungary, who lived in Hungary, they lived under false papers. They had Christian papers, and\nthey came here, they were brought here by a priest. So, you know, not everybody -- the majority\nwas bad, but there were some very good people in between. So, you know, so people sa - peoples\nthe -- the people survived, only could survive in account of people who helped them.",
        "Q: And I guess that would be in your case, people who were willing to hide you.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, and they -- I mean, they -- they put their -- they -- they didn't all do it for\nlove. A lot of it was money, okay, but they really put themselves in danger at that -- if you were\nfound, you know, if your -- if they found you, or if somebody denounced you, so it\u2019s -- it was a\nvery -- it was very, very interesting. Like, if somebody today would come to you and say, can\nyou hide me? So, you -- you know, it\u2019s -- those people really put their own life at stake. So --\nright?",
        "Q: So just to ge -- continue with where we were. I know we talked about a number of different\nthings and now I want to come back to the time when you were in hiding. So if you could just\nsort of summarize. When you started going into hiding -- also at that particular moment, what if\nanything do you remember about conversation -- conversations with your parents, you know,\nthat you would see them frequently or try to, cause I know at this time you\u2019re separating from\nyour parents.",
        "A: Right. We went into hiding I think the end of \u201941, beginning of \u201942, and I would see my\nparents, I would come to see them, they would come to see me. Would bring food which they\npurchased on the black market. And we lived in different places, and we switched places, and\nreally I -- I traveled a lot, I traveled into -- I was at many different places because I was young,\nand you know, people could not keep me for any length of time. Certain places I could go out,\nother places I could never leave. There was a place in the inner city, in the old city where I\nstayed, and I was not be -- I wasn\u2019t able to go out, and it was -- it was a big -- very, very big\napartment with all very old antique furniture, and it was very scary to be there, especially when\nyou were alone and they always said, if somebody ever comes in here, I\u2019d be hiding behind one\nof those big dining room table legs. You -- you think of the dumbest things. And --",
        "Q: Did you ever have any of those kind of close calls in any of the places where you were?",
        "A: No. Yeah, one. I had one very [indecipherable] and with another ca -- in a Jewish house. But\nthey were -- they did not have to wear a star at the time, and for whatever reason somebody came\ninto their apartment, some official, and I was in the bathroom, and I -- in the bathtub, and I\ngrabbed my robe, and I ran. I ran up the block, and I knew a doctor there, so I went there, and --\nand that was it. I mean ga -- you know, you -- you go -- get into situations where you don\u2019t think,\nyou just -- especially when you\u2019re -- you know, you\u2019re running. And you just take off and you\ndon\u2019t think. I mean, here I was running, if somebody would say, look, what she\u2019s doing here?\nSomebody could have picked up on it, and -- and that was it, it was -- the ma -- it\u2019s really -- the\nwhole thing was more luck than anything else. Whatever was supposed to be, that\u2019s the way it\nwas. But --",
        "Q: Were you -- did it ever feel like an adventure? I mean now, looking back, I see that you can\nsmile over some of these anecdotes. At the time was it more frightening and you always had\nsome --",
        "A: Well, yes -- no, it wa -- it was serious, it was not -- 1t was not a game. I mean, this much I\nunderstood. But at the -- at the point of danger, I w -- I wa -- suppose I was not old enough, or\ndidn\u2019t comprehend that the f -- that fear drove you to move, drove you to run, and that\u2019s what I\ndid.",
        "Q: Now, can you estimate how many, perhaps -- approximately how many different hiding\nplaces you -- you had in Vienna?",
        "A: At least 10 or 12. I -- you know, at least. Because certain places I stayed for awhile, other\nplaces it wasn't convenient to stay. And you know, people were frightened, and so I moved from\nplace to place. And somebody -- you know, there was an underground communication, you\nknow, somebody would say -- well, I know somebody who would -- you could stay with,\nbecause the people who did it knew somebody else, you know, their fre -- in their circle, so -- but\nit was very difficult. It was not easy. And sometimes when I went -- I think I was the one who\nmoved the most. And -- being a girl, and being 17 - 18, so I was the -- really the one who moved\nthe most. Sometimes I would stay with my parents. They were -- I mean, luckily enough, they\nwere always together. And then somebody would find a place where I would go and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Now, were the people who were hiding you always receiving some kind of money or\ncompensation?",
        "A: Yeah, they were -- yeah, most of them were -- were -- got -- got money, most of them -- my\nmother always brought food. And -- but money wa -- there were a few where it was money, but\nmost of them did not. It was strictly doing it for the -- for the good of the people or whatever, or\ntheir conscience, or they -- or you know, you can\u2019t -- you don\u2019t know. It was -- it was a\ntremendous undertaking for them.",
        "Q: And were they -- the people hiding you, were they all non-Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, they were all non-Jewish.",
        "Q: And how did you feel in their treatment toward you?",
        "A: Always very, ver -- I mean, you were always taken into the family, or most of the time taken\ninto the family. I -- I mean the longest I stayed [indecipherable] the longest [indecipherable] was\nI stayed with my father\u2019s friend, and I was -- I was just part of the family and that\u2019s it. But really,\nthe chances they took were im -- um -- you know, they had -- they had family whom I never\nknew if they knew or if they didn\u2019t know. I mean, you had to be pretty dense not to, you know,\nbut nobody ever said anything or did anything, you know, so -- I mean, eventually I had to leave,\nand then of course, I went th -- stayed with Mariani, and then we were caught.",
        "Q: When did it begin when you stayed with Mariani and can you tell me -- first can you tell me\nher full name, and her husband\u2019s full name?",
        "A: Her -- her name was Mariani -- Mariani Fierstein, okay, Brauer, and her husband\u2019s name was\nOtto Brauer. And I think it was -- I -- I was there for about a year, maybe less. That was a -- we\nstayed in th -- the place was a laundry and it wasn't the ha -- the house was a shack. It was a\nwooden shack, it had -- it had three bedrooms, and three -- one, two, three or four -- four so\ncalled bedrooms, okay, and a living room which was also a workplace where the ironing was\ndone, and the kitchen. And it had no cellar or anything, it was undergr -- it was a wooden shack.\nIt was just totally incredible when you think abou -- I mean, I\u2019m laughing now, but it -- to\ndescribe it 1s -- like a lean-to. And th-there was a hand laundry, you know, they had kettles there,\nand they boiled the laundry and they scrubbed the laundry, we did too. Just because we had\nnothing else to do. And we learned to iron on a flat board instead of an ironing board. I became a\ncur -- I could iron men\u2019s shirts perfect. And we ironed with an iron with a hot st -- stone in there,\nand it had no back. And of course you did other people\u2019s laundry, so we had to be careful that\nstone shouldn\u2019t slip out from the thing. And then we were -- we lived there, and we all -- we --\nthe facility was an outhouse and there was another -- there was another man there, hi -- there was\nsomething -- he was mentally ill. And he lived in a little -- also in this lean-to. And his thing was,\nhe was waiting -- he liked Mariani\u2019s bath water. He used to call it -- Mariani came there in the\nsummertime, when they moved in it was summertime. And he -- we would have four foot of\nsnow on the ground, and he would call her the summer lady. And we would give him the food\nwhich was left over, but he never ate that, he had it in cans, and he waited until it became moldy\nand then he ate it. I mean, the man was sick. Sometimes I wonder if he knew what was going on.\nI don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: How 1s -- he was living in -- next door, or --",
        "A: He was living in another little lean-to, and no heat, next to the -- next to the outhouse. It\u2019s\nincredible, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: Do you remember it being uncomfortable living there?",
        "A: Well, I -- Mariani, her husband and I slept in one be -- in two beds. I slept across, and they\nslept -- I mean, we are laughing, if we wouldn\u2019t be laughing, we\u2019d be crying. So --",
        "Q: Now, were you very close friends already with Marianne before this?",
        "A: Well, Mariani lived with -- with us. I mean, I b -- I didn\u2019t know Mariani until I was 13, when\nshe -- when they c -- needed to go some places, and my father and the lady who lived in the other\nroom apparently met Mariani, knew Mariani, I don\u2019t know. And they needed to vacate their\napartment because they were going to be relocated, so to say. And they came -- they -- so they\nbrought them to us. And as I said, they stayed in the kitchen in a -- up in a -- in a bunk bed. And\nas I said before, when the chimney sweep came, the super came, and said, you have to get up\nbecause he\u2019s coming to sweep.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s before you went to the laundry place?",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was long before, yes. That was before we even moved.",
        "Q: How did this arrangement get made to hide in this shack in -- behind the laundry or --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where -- somebody knew of her, and approached her, and -- hers -- hers was\nstrictly money.",
        "Q: What\u2019s her name?",
        "A: I think her name was Pukas.",
        "Q: And so she was the owner, or she ran the laundry?",
        "A: She was -- she was the owner of the laundry and that was it.",
        "Q: What do you remember of her personality, what type of person was she?",
        "A: She was not too bright, but a nice person and we have another incident where she -- there are\ncertain things she had to have, among them was a ti -- a goose for Christmas, and I think Mariani\ntold you about that, that we went, we finally got the goose, and you shou -- it was a tapestry bag\nwe put it in, and suddenly a door --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen. This is tape number two, side A. You were telling me about a story, an anecdote where\nyou and Marianne were getting a goose, I believe, for Christmas. Can you tell me again the\ndetails of the story?",
        "A: Well we picked up the goose, and it -- carried it in a -- a tapestry bag and apparently a dog\npicked up the scent and followed us until we got to the trolley. And got into the trolley, nobody\nnoticed that the dog is following us. I got home, I had a navy coat on -- I wore, and I had a navy\nsweater, and when I undressed, I was navy. The color -- I must have perspired so from fear, that -\n- th-the colo -- the color came off.",
        "Q: Is this the kind of thing you were actually able to laugh about in the moment?",
        "A: Yeah. After -- after it was all over, we laughed about it. I mean, we did not -- you know, wa --\nwe -- for some reason we had either durability or the -- I -- I -- I really don\u2019t know what it wa --\nthe drive to survive that we could make light of it. We -- we didn\u2019t dwell on it. We want --\nthough we were victims, we weren\u2019t the victims in our mind. And you know, we had th -- we had\nno -- it wasn\u2019t in our power to -- to survive, to -- to -- so we -- we did the best we could, and not\nto let us -- not to sink to their level.",
        "Q: Were there other humorous anecdotes during your time 1n hiding?",
        "A: As I said, this man who was really mentally ill, used to love Mariani\u2019s bath water, and he\nbrushed his teeth with it. Apparently he liked the soap she used or whatever, because at -- what\nwe used as a -- to -- to bathe was one of those tin tubs from many, many years ago, even before\nmy time. And he would pass by and he\u2019d say, did she take her bath? Did she take her bath? You\nknow, this was in summertime, we used to be outside and he\u2019d say, did she take her bath? And\nthe minute she was -- she was ready to s -- throw the water out, here he was with his can wash --\nwaiting to wa -- to rinse his mouth. It was disgusting. I mean --",
        "Q: And did you laugh at the time?",
        "A: Yeah, we laugh, of course. I mean, that was our entertainment, 1f you know what I mean. We\n-- We -- we -- we created our own entertainment. So my br -- my brother used to raise rabbits for\nfood, and he worked -- there was a shoemaker next door and he would work there, and they\nwould give him oats, and -- like oatmeal, and he would feed it to the rabbits. And then he -- but\nhe never -- he would never eat them, and he would take them to a neighbor and she would kill\nthem and skinned them and whatever else. But he would ta -- his portion he would feed to the\ncat, and the woman was incensed that he used to do that. But that was it.",
        "Q: Why did he raise them and then --",
        "A: For foo -- he -- well he -- we ate them. We -- you know, domesticated rabbit tastes like\nchicken. He would -- that was our supplement of meat, but he would not eat them because he\nwas -- he was -- he fed them, he bred them, so he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t eat them.",
        "Q: When did your brother join you in hiding, cause he wasn't with you all the time before.",
        "A: No, I -- I was away. He was always -- he was always with Marianne. So I came.",
        "Q: What else did you do for food? What else did you eat?",
        "A: Well, there was -- there was a lesbian [indecipherable] they were gard -- they -- professional\ngardeners, and they had greenhouses, and they would bring us vegetables, lettuce, and things like\nthat. And the food was bought in the black market. That was always avail -- you know, that was\navailable.",
        "Q: Did you have enough money with you?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have any. Marianne\u2019s husband. I didn\u2019t have any. I was -- we were just there, and\nthey took care of us.",
        "Q: And was the woman, Mrs. or Ms. Pukas, was she involved at all in the food -- getting food for\nyou, or helping you to get food?",
        "A: Well, I pres -- I suppose, you know, whatever was being ab -- whatever was being purchased\nin the black market, whoever could bring it, and whoever could locate it. Because the\n[indecipherable] on -- you know, everybody else was on food stamps. So you purchased food\nstamps and then you could buy food, or you had people who grew food, and we had chickens\nalso, and they laid eggs. And ma -- Mariani became the farmer\u2019s wife, and she would go out and\nlook for the eggs, I mean, so when you think about it, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- as sad at it -- as it 1s, it\u2019s\nalmost -- you can\u2019t really comprehend it, it\u2019s just not something -- you look back and you say, I\nreally did that? And this was luxury yet.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel hungry while you were in hiding?",
        "A: No, no. No, it was -- it -- it -- I well -- how shall I say? When I was with my father\u2019s friend I\nlived a very civilized life, and I mean it was civilized with Mariani too, and with -- with almost\neverybody else, I mean, I -- I moved around, I lived in many places, and it is interesting, some of\nthe people must have known. I lived in a place where she -- the woman owned a restaurant, a\nhotel and a coffee house, and the wine growers would come, you know, to f -- to si -- 1s -- and\nshe would entertain them. At 11 o\u2019clock at night she would go to bed and she would leave me\nthere with all those people until they were all ready to go home. And she had a -- she had a -- an\n-- she had a maid and she must have known, I mean, 1-it was just almost like impossible not to,\nbecause there I didn't go out, I stayed in -- in the apartment all the time, so -- I mean, I was in\nsituations where you -- looking back now I said, you know, I ca -- I can\u2019t comprehend them. So -\n- so to relate them, and make people say, that is not that\u2019s -- you know, it -- it doesn\u2019t make\nsense.",
        "Q: Now, when you first left home and you first went into hiding, were there certain items that\nwere important to you that you could bring? Or did you have to leave pretty much everything at\nhome?",
        "A: Yeah, cl -- clothing. I brought -- you know, you brought as much clothing as you could carry.\nYou couldn't -- you couldn\u2019t carry a lot because you\u2019re moving in someplace, you -- you know,\nyour space was very limited. But you know, there are a few things you took and you also have to\nremember I was hiding from the beginning of \u201942 until \u00b044. There was winter, summer, so you\nreally had -- that was an additional thing you had to fend for. S-So as long -- you know, as long\nas my parents were around, they were -- they -- they took care, but thereafter it was really\nMariani and her husband.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the age difference between you and Mariani?",
        "A: She was born in 1910, and -- 15 years.",
        "Q: And what did it feel like, was she a close friend, was she more like a mother substitute, or --",
        "A: No, y-you know [indecipherable] in Europe you will -- you are -- you -- you don\u2019t -- you\ndon\u2019t address people in the [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know wha --",
        "Q: Familiar way --",
        "A: On a familiar basis. You\u2019re more -- I mean, I always would call her Mrs. Mariani, if -- you\nknow, all those years. And only when I -- when she came here, she became Mariani. You know,\nas -- as we got older -- I mean to her I\u2019m chil -- to her I\u2019m still the child, okay, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s very\nfunny now, but that\u2019s the way it is. So no, she was -- sh-she always -- there was always a certain\namount of respect, and that was it.",
        "Q: Since you were separated from your parents, did you -- do you feel that you looked to her for\ncertain parenting sort of guidance?",
        "A: No, I was re -- I was self sufficient, self reli -- not sufficient, self reliant, I didn't -- no I didn't,\nreally not. I mean, she told me when to get on and off, but otherwise -- I mean, we ha -- I -- it\u2019s\nvery difficult, I mean she -- she did not a-assume a parental type of a -- it wasn\u2019t that type of a\nrelationship. It was more like, you know, we all lived together. I mean, we slept together, you\ncan\u2019t get much closer. But there was still as -- a certain respect.",
        "Q: What are some of the ways that even if it was not in the style of a sort of parental role, but\nsome of the ways that perhaps she helped take care of you during this time?",
        "A: Well, y -- you know, if I ne -- if I needed to -- I would ask her for anything, for -- there was\nreally no -- no -- for advice or anything, I mean, we just lived day by day. There was no -- you\nknow, there was nothing that you would say, what shall I do, or how shall I do. That never came\ninto question because there was no -- there was no way or no reason for anything like that.",
        "Q: What about your education? You weren't going to school, so --",
        "A: No, we -- I -- I -- no, we would -- she [indecipherable] her husband would -- we would do\nmath and we would read. And I was an insa -- I was an voracious reader, and we listened to the\nradio, and music, and talk, mostly talk.",
        "Q: Anything you remember about your conversations?",
        "A: No, no, no. I mean, most of it was really political. I mean, we would listen to the -- to news,\nwe would listen to the Voice of America, you know, and they\u2019re bombing here, they\u2019re bombing\nthere and they are retreating because it is advantageous for the Germans, but we are winning.\nAnd, so it was really mostly we were waiting. We -- we would see the planes coming in and we\nwere delighted, you know. Bela -- it\u2019s because it was m -- really in an outer district. We see the -\n- wa -- American or British planes flying over, dropping bombs, and we were delighted. I mean,\nwhen I lived in the city 1t wasn\u2019t this much fun because everybody went into the basement where\nyou were -- I was alone in a big apartment house, and that was not fun.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: That was when I was hiding, you know, when one of the places, when the air raid sirens\ncame, everybody had to vacate their apartment and at one time I was hiding in the closet because\nthey were going from apartment to apartment to see if all the apartments are empty. And of\ncourse you never knew if you\u2019re -- this building is going to be bombed, th -- at that point you\nwere scared, but there was nothing you could do. You could just wait it out and hope for the best.",
        "Q: I think Marianne also mentioned when you\u2019 re hiding together with her, that while everybody\nduring the air raids went to the cellar, you would go to the attic. Is that what you remember?",
        "A: No, th-that probably was when we were at this [indecipherable] house. No, I don\u2019t remember\nthat, because most -- as I said, that\u2019s the only time we had an attic. Otherwise, there was no attic.\nThat -- that -- the worst was the apartment buildings because here the apart -- the house was\ntotally still, there was nobody there, and that was it.",
        "Q: So you were afraid of both the air raid and then being found?",
        "A: [indecipherable] right. I mean we -- I mean, we knew what bombs can do, or maybe have\nseen destruction, and it was just the eeriest feeling to be in a -- in a building, the only person in a\nbuilding, so to say. I p -- the a -- in your imagination, because you didn\u2019t see it. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So -- so now when you are in the hiding place in the -- 1n the wooden shack, I believe, that\u2019s\nbehind the laundry --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- place, so what -- I just lost my train of thought -- when you were there -- do you know\napproximately how long you were in hiding there, and would you sometimes leave from there\nand come back and go to different hiding places in between?",
        "A: Here and there I would leave, yes. Here and there, when something became available. I mean,\nwe lived in odd quo -- I mean in -- under odd circumstances. My poor brother slept on a chaise\nlounge which was infested with slee -- with fleas. It was horrendous.",
        "Q: And where was that?",
        "A: That was there because you know, you were on the ground, there was -- there were just\nboards on the ground as floors. So -- I mean, it -- it -- it didn't look this terrible. I me -- I\u2019m just\ndescribing it which is really -- you can\u2019t imagine it, okay? But it wasn\u2019t that uncomfortable, and\nthe -- the living room was -- the bedroom was perfectly fine looking, you know, we had the\nwindows and all. But those were the --",
        "Q: So you left when you thought there was a better place to go to?",
        "A: No, not better, you know, just to make room, just to disappear. And --",
        "Q: Cause you were worried about being caught at the laundry place?",
        "A: No, and -- just making room, you know, there were so many people, I mean -- so when there\nwas something else opened up, and somebody said, you know there is -- you\u2019ll be able to stay\nthere, you moved on.",
        "Q: And about how long in total would you say you were at the -- at this wooden shack?",
        "A: Maybe a year in total. Yeah, maybe a year in total, may -- a year and a half, I really ti -- I\nhave no concept of time. Course it\u2019s 60 -- over 60 years, and I don\u2019t dwell on it. If you were a\nperson who dwells on it, it\u2019s a totally different story. Not only is it -- it becomes worse, because\nyour imagination goes, right?",
        "Q: Now, I think I heard, also from Marianne, some kind of story about the day when it was\nsupposed to be your brother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s when they caught, and they came [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And when was this and can you tell me the story?",
        "A: Yeah, was -- it would be May 19\". He was -- he was born in \u201929, so he was, in \u201944 he was --\ntw -- 39 and five, he was 13. What am I doing? He was 13. And we were waiting, you know, for\nmy parents to come and this friend of mine came and he said they were caught. And I cannot\nremember any more how -- somebody denounced them. Tha -- yes, somebody denounced them.\nSo -- and he came and he told us, and he was able -- he went to visit them in the jail when they\nwere in jail, and my parents told their interrogator that we went over the border to Hungary, so\nthey shouldn\u2019t be looking for us because they caught the parents, so they knew the children was\nthere, but my parents told them that we went -- we were sent to Hungary, and that\u2019s -- that was\nthat. And then they were transported to Theresienstadt.",
        "Q: But when did you learn about that?",
        "A: Well, they were allowed to write, and they wrote to this friend of mine, and that\u2019s how we\nknew where they were. You know, when they arrived, you know, we are ha -- we are in a\nbeautiful place, everything is nice, and that\u2019s how we were able to send them f-food. We would\nsend a bag of onions or something, bag of potatoes, you know, something you can -- not\nknowing if they ever get it or not, but that was -- was -- so --",
        "Q: The day of your brother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah, where were you that day when you got this news?",
        "A: We were in -- we were home. I mean, we were hiding.",
        "Q: In the laundry place?",
        "A: In -- in -- yeah, yeah, mm-hm. Yeah.",
        "Q: And -- and so he did have his Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: Oh no. I -- I -- when we say it would have been his Bar Mi -- he was 13. There was no way\nthat he would ever have had it, okay? This was just like a -- you know, here he was, 13, his 13\"\nbirthday. So -- but --",
        "Q: How did your brother take the news?",
        "A: Well, he was 13. He was not very -- he was not very vocal. You know, he was a 13 year old\nboy who lived under very vicarious circumstances or conditions and so -- and as I said, he wasn\u2019t\nvery -- he -- he was not very vocal.",
        "Q: How did you take it? Was it somehow possible to be optimistic after -- after this?",
        "A: You had to be. You had no choice. It\u2019s ye -- I -- I suppose this is -- we all were -- I mean, it\nwas not a pla -- it was not pleasant, we did not know -- but we didn\u2019t know -- we had no -- we\nhad absolutely no understanding, because nobody can -- I mean, it\u2019s not something a normal\nmind can comprehend. You can fear, but you really -- and -- and also, the optimism that it will be\nover, it will be over very soon because America is there, and Britain is fighting, okay? So it\u2019s not\ngoing to be -- it\u2019s going to be very fast, I mean. When he went into ru -- when Germans went\ninto Russia, I mean, th-this was the end, oka -- but a -- you were always optimistic that\nsomething is going to happen what\u2019s going to end it.",
        "Q: And you were actively following the news about the war?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. In fact, when we were caught, we were interrogated by the Gestapo, and so\nhe said, and you listened to the Voice of America, and the radio we had, we couldn\u2019t really listen\nto it, but we had a neighbor there, she was Jewish, he wasn\u2019t, and there was a -- the owner of the\nbuilding, her husband was Jewish, she wasn\u2019t, and she had two adult children, one -- one was a\nphysician and one was -- I don\u2019t know what she was. But they were -- they knew we were there,\nand they would listen or they would call Mariani and say -- and her husband, say to come and\nlisten to the Voice of America. So when this Gest -- when I was interrogated, he said to me,\n\u2018And I understand you listened to the Voice of America.\u201d And I said to him, \u201dNo,\u201d I said, \u201cwe\ncould never, ever listen with the radio we have,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you put your finger,\u201d I said -- there\nwas an opening in the back and, \u201cif you put your finger there, the voice would get -- the music\nwould get strong,\u201d I said, \u201cand if you took it away, it died.\u201d So he looked at me and he said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019re this stupid, or if you\u2019re playing.\u201d And I looked at him and I said, \u201cNo,\nthat\u2019s the way it was.\u201d And I was in there first, and then when Mariani came, I handed her my\ncoat, and I sa -- didn\u2019t say anything, you know, and that was it. But it would -- and then -- I mean\n-- [\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- how shall I say? We were able to laugh about it, you know? I mean, it was scary\nat the moment, but I co -- I couldn\u2019t really think of anything else, I mean, he accuses us of\nlistening, which was a very normal thing, I mean, he di -- he might not even have known, you n -\n- but with that radio, you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t if you would have wanted to. So --",
        "Q: When is the last time that you spoke to or saw your parents? Excuse me.",
        "A: Bless you. Is -- probably a week before they were caught. You know, there was no telephone\n-- there was really only when my mother could come or I could go. Mariani and I really moved\nquite freely. Didn\u2019t look Jewish. I pa -- what does looking Jewish mean, right? I mean, if you\nwould -- if you would be black, or you would be oriental, it\u2019s fine. But here we were. I had blue\neyes, she had blonde hair, blue eyes, very statuesque type of a per -- you know, appearance.\nNobody looked at us, we hoped. We had no papers. We just, you know, we just walked.",
        "Q: So you were out on the streets often?",
        "A: Oh yeah. We were out in the street. We even -- we even went to the Turkish bath every\ncouple of weeks once, we would go and you know, make believe we having a great time, and we\ndid. That was -- that was our -- here I was, what, 18 - 19? Going to the Turkish baths at -- in\nthere, nobody knew who you were, you -- you know. And it was like a bi -- you know, big -- it\u2019s\nnot like the bath house here, there we -- you pro -- might have seen them. And this was our\nrecreation.",
        "Q: So you tried to enjoy life when you could?",
        "A: We -- we tried to make the best what we had, you know, that\u2019s it. Like my brother never\nventured out, because he was almost six foot tall, and he couldn\u2019t go out because what is he\ndoing midday on the street, when everybody else is in the army, or -- or working? So what is he\ndoing at night out, he can\u2019t go out, so he never went out.",
        "Q: Well, this makes me wonder was it easier to go out as a young woman?",
        "A: Yeah, you know, because I mean we knew -- you know, we wouldn\u2019t travel the time when\npeople were working, we tried to travel with the crowd. You know, don\u2019t --the danger was that\nyou met somebody, and in -- in there. But they might not even have meant you harm, but in -- in\ntheir just strict -- just gossiping, or say, oh we saw Annie, okay? She looked -- you know. If they\nwould s -- [indecipherable] to have spoken to us it would have been terrible, because where do\nyou live? How come you\u2019re still here, you know? So that was the danger of going out.",
        "Q: Now you were aware of -- you said there\u2019s this underground sort of movement, you were\naware of many Jewish people staying there in hiding.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean they -- not everybody knew everybody, but this is how you -- you found\nplaces. If somebody needed a place, and you knew of somebody who might or will, you passed it\non. And that\u2019s, you know, it was like underground -- a whole underground circuit.",
        "Q: Where was -- do you remember the address or the general location of this laundry place\nwhere you hid?",
        "A: Yeah, it was 13 Roebuckerstrasse. I went back there and it was -- it was totally cleared, so it\nwas the weirdest, weirdest sight.",
        "Q: When did you go?",
        "A: Maybe 15 - 20 years ago. My husband wanted to go see Austria, so we went. It\u2019s a ver -- was\na very, very strange experience. First of all, I carried a chip on my shoulder to the population,\nand I knew every nook and crevice. I could travel the underground, I could travel on -- but I felt\nlike a tourist, and then that was it. In fact, we went to -- where was it? Corinthia we went and the\n-- that was really -- the homeland of Mr. Schwarzenegger, and [indecipherable] of my number,\nbecause I wasn't going to give them the satisfaction to say, look at them, what are -- what are\nthey talking about we did to the Jews? So I -- I just -- I was not going to give them the\nsatisfaction to say that, you know, and they wanted to know how come I speak so -- I can speak\ndialect. So how come? If I was a war bride? No, I wasn\u2019t, okay? And Austrians, when they -- I\nmean, it\u2019s stupid to say, are very nosy. And, you were a war bride? No. How come you speak\nsuch good -- you know. I learned it.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want to tell them you\u2019re from there?",
        "A: No, no. I mean, you know, I wasn't -- I he -- I traveled with an American passport, you know,\nand they can tell where you were born, so she knew I was aw -- you know, but sh-she wanted --\nthey wanted to know, you know, more detail, and I wasn't going to volunteer. And that\u2019s it. Now\npeople will say why did you -- why did you cover your number? I says because I just was not\ngoing to have them say, what did they say what we did to the Jews? Look at them travel, you\nknow? That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Now, I think we\u2019re getting to the point where --",
        "A: We go to camp.",
        "Q: -- you know, you have been -- where you\u2019re found out in your hiding place, but I\u2019m -- I was\njust curious in general, is there anything else you remember as far as anything you haven\u2019t\nalready shared, what would be the biggest challenges of this life that you had in hiding?",
        "A: It was just one big challenge, there was no big, no small, it was just -- it was so -- to survive.\nAnd e -- I don\u2019t th -- I mean, I did not have the capacity, I don\u2019t think as -- I don\u2019t know, age or -\n-or -- or brain, to -- to realize how dire the situation was, you know? I mean, you wanted to\nsurvive and you -- the hope that it will end, that\u2019s all. I mean, you -- y-you just, as I said before,\nyou tried not to -- not to be di -- to -- to -- not to be destroyed. You lived in your own little mind.\nAnd that\u2019s the whole a -- it -- it\u2019s really very, very difficult to -- to under -- I -- I myself don\u2019t\nlike it -- don\u2019t understand it. And looking back on it I say, did I really live like this, did I really\ndo that? And as I have said many times, that the m --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen. This is tape number two, side B. I think you wanted to say something? Did you want to --\nokay. So now I wanted to ask you, continuing where we left off, if you would tell me what\nhappened when you were discovered in the hiding place.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: This is the place with Mrs. or Miss Pukas.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The -- the laundry. What happened?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s six o\u2019clock in the morning, we could hear the gate opening. There was a fence, and\nthere was a gate. The gate opened, and the bedroom windows faced, and we saw I don\u2019t know\nhow many coming in. And they just came in and they arrested us. I mean, they went through the\nwhole -- through the place, they were looking for things. And I don\u2019t know if Mariani told you,\nbut her husband wrote a memoir, and of course they found it. And he also was -- he had colon\ncancer, a -- operated on, but he wore a --",
        "Q: A catheter?",
        "A: Yeah. And of course they saw the -- his manuscript and that didn\u2019t help any. So anyway, we\nwent from there, they arrested us and they brought us to the city jail, and there we were, I think,\nfor almost a month. We were privileged prisoners there because we were the only, more or le --\nthat was mostly migrant workers, and I was [indecipherable] in quarantine, and the\n[indecipherable] was into a big room. Mariani and I slept on the table because we weren\u2019t about\nto sleep on the -- with them, because we were scared. And we would get up in the morning and\nwe would go into the washroom and strip and wash, because one thing we knew, we had to try to\nkeep clean. Those people all looked at us because they didn't know from that. Anyway,\neventually --",
        "Q: And when was this?",
        "A: That was in the city jail.",
        "Q: But when?",
        "A: When? That was in May \u00b044. May \u201944, was it?",
        "Q: I think she said it was --",
        "A: I have it here.",
        "Q: -- June. Think it was close to that.",
        "A: It\u2019s ju -- no, I\u2019m sorry, it was in June. It was in June -- no, it was in -- in June, I think, yeah.\nNo, we were deported in June, that was at -- 1t was my -- it -- it was either -- it was either the end\nof May, or the beginning of June, because the end of June we were deported. We -- yeah, we got\n-- we came to Auschwitz, to Birkenau.",
        "Q: How do you think or what do you know about the way in which you were found in your\nhiding place? What -- what have you been able to understand how that happened that you were\ncaught?",
        "A: We really -- I really don\u2019t know. The woman who was hiding us, nothing happened to her. All\nthe things we had that -- photographs, and little whatever was left there -- excuse me, stayed\nthere, and Mariani recouped that after the war. So we don\u2019t unders -- excuse me -- we also -- she\nalso has a deserter -- not -- I don\u2019t know if -- if she told him he can\u2019t stay any more, and he was\ncaught. So we -- I don\u2019t know if it was he who was trying to save himself and said there are Jews\nthere, or if she became scared and told somebody, and they went and denounced us. I w --\nnobody ever knows -- will know.",
        "Q: It came as a total surprise at the time?",
        "A: Total. Out of -- out of the blue. No pla -- there was no -- nothing said, nobody -- nothing --\nnobody but the deserter came -- you know, there was nobody new who would have -- we would\nhave said, oh maybe. But it was all the old acquaintances, or people who were aware of us. So,\nreally I don\u2019t know. I truly don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And you stayed in the jail for --",
        "A: A month.",
        "Q: A month. And what were conditions like there? You were starting to explain.",
        "A: Yeah, wi -- how and when I can\u2019t remember any more, but it -- we -- first we stayed in that\nhumongous -- with like maybe 40 or 50 people. And then we were moved into a smaller cell,\nwith maybe only 20 and then I don\u2019t know if it was the matron or who, took a -- chose us to give\nout food and dishes and we swept the hal -- the hall, and our -- our s -- we -- Mariani had a pr --\nand I had a pr -- a private cell. I shouldn\u2019t laugh, but it was -- I mean, it was -- and they never\nlocked the gate or any -- we couldn\u2019t go anyplace, I mean we were in jail.",
        "Q: But it was sort of relaxed conditions?",
        "A: Yeah, it was, for us it was a rela -- you know, the breakfast, lunch and dinner was ser -- you\nknow, we would give out the cutlery and we collected and would sweep the floors. So the day\npassed. And Mariani was a ferocious smoker. She didn\u2019t only smoke cigarettes, she would --\nthey would -- you know, cigarettes were very hard to get by. They would take the butt, open it up\n[indecipherable] the tobacco and they re -- either roll it, or re-stuff it and smoke it. And -- so one\nday Mariani said, she s -- we have to [indecipherable] to get -- if you can get to our stuff, and the\nonly reason she wanted to get in there because she had two boxes of that smelly, old tobacco.\nAnd the interesting part is she smoked all this, and she s -- that was the end of smoking. Like\ncold turkey, no more.",
        "Q: When is it that she stopped smoking? You\u2019re saying --",
        "A: In -- 1n jail. When -- when she was finished smoking whatever she had there, and that was it.",
        "Q: So you were able to bring a few items with you?",
        "A: Yeah, I mean, you know. And th-the most important was the tobacco.",
        "Q: Now, you had about a month there --",
        "A: A month there.",
        "Q: -- and what were you thinking would happen next?",
        "A: We had no -- we had really, absolutely -- I mean, n-no -- I -- I -- no -- how shall I -- we didn't\nknow. We just didn\u2019t know. The only thing we knew was Theresienstadt. We didn\u2019t know\nAuschwitz, we didn\u2019t know Mauthausen. I mean, I had a very -- we had a very interesting thing\nhappen to us in -- when I traveled with my husband, we were in Salzburg. Mauthausen 1s right\nthere, and my husband is a tourist, he speaks to everybody and speaking the language -- he spoke\nthe -- the bridge was closed, so he wanted to know from the policeman why the bridge was\nclosed. So he -- they were making a movie and the policeman said to him, have you gone to\nMauthausen? And my husband said no. So he told him how to get there, but among other things\nhe also said he lived the ri -- the -- it\u2019s -- it was a country road, okay, and the trucks would go\npast there. There was -- you know, there was the road, and there was houses on one side of the\nstreet. And he said, you know, the trucks would go by, we didn\u2019t know that there was a camp\nthere, there were thi -- they were doing this. So that\u2019s the mentality of the -- of -- we didn\u2019t\nknow. I mean, we didn't want it, but we just waited for him, and we opened our arms when they\narrived.",
        "Q: So you find it hard to believe that they didn\u2019t know that --",
        "A: From -- from a -- you know, I have a slanted -- I\u2019m for -- that -- that I have a very sla --\nbecause I\u2019ve lived there, I -- yo-you know, I felt the anti-Semitism all my life, so consequently I\n-- \u2019m -- I\u2019m talking about the -- more or less, I\u2019m not talking about the people of today, I can\u2019t\nbecause I don\u2019t know them. But they are probably better educated, and what 1s a -- a -- an\nAustrian? Austria was a mixture of Czechs, Poles, Yugoslavs, you know, I mean there\u2019s no such\na thing as a pure Austrian. They all came from the so -- I mean, it was the great Austrian under\nthe -- under the emperor. So there\u2019s no such a thing, so you have a mixture of -- of people. And\nas I said, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I was -- I\u2019m prejudiced, I suppose, and I look at them totally different.\nAnd so I can\u2019t really -- I\u2019m -- I can\u2019t have a unprejudiced opinion.",
        "Q: So you had no idea what was about to happen --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- but then --",
        "A: We went on the special transport, we were only I think 15 or 16 people, and really was a -- a\nregular train car, and we knew there was something going on, but of course, nobody knew.\nNobody could in -- nobody ever got out of there to tell, and America knew, but they didn\u2019t\nspread the word, so nobody knew. America knew where the camps were, right? So we were -- I\nmean, we know it did not bode well, but we really had to see what it is. We had to wait, we had\nno -- what were we going to do?",
        "Q: Describe the journey, how long and -- and when did you know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t think -- it was just a couple of hours. Was a -- you know, Vienna is not\nthis far away from -- from Auschwitz. It wasn\u2019t an overnight, it definitely wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: And it was a comfortable ride?",
        "A: Oh, it -- it was a regular third class coach, you know, we had -- we had the whole\ncompartment -- we had the whole -- we had the whole car, I should say, not compartment, you\nknow? And I suppose we were guarded. That I can\u2019t even remember, you know, we were --\nbecause here we are, we didn\u2019t know where we were going. I remember --",
        "Q: But -- but you felt it was ominous?",
        "A: Oh yes. In fact, there was one man, he was alone, and he asked -- he had some gold pieces,\nand he asked Mariani to sew it into his coat. And she did. Not that it ever helped him, because he\nlost his coat, okay? So --",
        "Q: You were with other Jewish prisoners?",
        "A: Yeah, we were about with 15 other people. We were with 15 other people. We -- and there\nwas one -- there was one family who thought that they weren\u2019t Jewish, the -- they converted, but\nthey were with us, too. And the mother died, and I think Mariani took care of the girl, and I think\nthe father also survived. I don\u2019t know because I left -- I was lucky enough to be shipped out, so I\nwasn't there when Ausch -- wh-when Birkenau was liberated.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re on this journey, it\u2019s not a very long one, but when do you first know that you\u2019re\narriving to Auschwitz? Tell me about that.",
        "A: Well, we arrived, and we were sele -- you know, there was selection, the separation of men\nand women. And in hindsight, of course, we -- after we were -- we -- after you -- the -- we talked\nto inmates, we found out what was going on. Before that you had no idea. We didn\u2019t. And\nMariani\u2019s husband was sent to one side, my brother went in the other side, and Mariani and I are\n-- were together. And we were together for a whi -- for a -- in fact, I wanted my brother to go\nwith Mariani\u2019s husband and they pushed him back. He went right into -- into selection. And\nMariani and I were in the block together for maybe four weeks or so, four or five weeks, and\nthen I worked that we -- I was sent to work in -- they tor -- I still don\u2019t know what they did with\nit. You tor -- you tore the clothing into strips, braided them, and that\u2019s it. Whatever they did with\nit, whatever they used it for, I never found out. And then I worked -- I built a road to the east, we\nwere transporting rocks and breaking the rocks, and there we had a guard who would let us sit in\nthe outhouse by the tower to take a re -- it was brutally hot, even in -- in September. No, th --\nOctober -- no, was towards -- 1t was hot. And he would let us go in one by one and when the\nsuper -- the guy who was supervising, him came -- he came on a horse, so he could see him, so\nhe would call whoever was in there out. I mean, that was --",
        "Q: But he gave you breaks, he let you ta --",
        "A: He gave us breaks. He gave -- it was a young -- it was a young Austrian kid who really\nprobably didn\u2019t want to be there, and didn\u2019t agree, and gave each and every one of us a break.",
        "Q: Was it very hard work? Very hard, manual labor?",
        "A: It was physical labor. I mean, people breaking -- you know, breaking stones and loading them\ninto lorries and moving the lorries, and dumping them in this -- 1n the -- in the road bed. And -- I\nmean, it was physical labor.",
        "Q: Were you pretty strong at the time?",
        "A: I must have been. I must have been because otherwise I couldn\u2019t -- there\u2019s one thing you tried\nto avoid, and that was being in the hospice. Okay, that was not -- and I was there two -- I had\ndysentery, and in fact, that\u2019s where Mariani broke her nose, she came to visit me and she slipped,\nshe broke her nose. But fortunately I got out of there, and after I got out of there, I -- we did\nlandscaping for -- with pick and shovel. And they had -- also they had Russian prisoners there,\npr-prisoners of war, I suppose. And there was one of them, he used -- they had -- he must have\nbeen working in an orchard or something, and whenever we crossed, he would give me apples. I\nmean, when y -- you know, I remember the -- the -- how shall I say? The good things.",
        "Q: You remember little moments of human kindness.",
        "A: Right, you know. And that -- I mean, I would -- I would buy cabbage. There were people who\nworked in -- in the fields and they would bring heads of cabbage back, and I would give one\nration of my bread, one day ration, for cabbage. And I really think that\u2019s what helped me survive,\nbecause it was the only --",
        "Q: You had no other sort of vegetables, or roughage, or --",
        "A: No, no, no, whatever it was, it was boiled. It was soup. The only solids we ever got was\npotatoes. And if you were lucky you were the last one, so you can get the peels, too.",
        "Q: Were you hungry a lot of the time?",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember. Y-You n -- you know, we would have -- I -- I would have -- we would have\nsit in -- we have food fantasies, we would set a table with candles, and the tablecloths and\nnapkins and silver. I mean, you know --",
        "Q: In your mind.",
        "A: In your -- yeah, you were -- we were talking. The way -- this is the way it\u2019s going to look.\nYou know --",
        "Q: You would talk with friends and fantasize about the future.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know. It\u2019s --",
        "Q: And mostly about food, or other things, too?",
        "A: Yeah, no, but -- bu -- you know, tha-that was the weirdest thing, to se -- here you are, you\nhave nothing to eat, you have to watch that nobody steals your bread, or you ge -- or you traded\nyour bread for a -- for a quarter head of cabbage. And -- and that\u2019s it. So it 1s really -- the -- the\nweird -- I think the weirdness about this all, that here we are, we are sitting here and we are\ntalking about it. Right? And we can laugh, as sad as it is, so --",
        "Q: Did you form friendships?",
        "A: Yes and no, you know. I -- I had a -- a friend which -- she died of TB. We slept together -- so\n-- in the work camp. See, I was very lucky because I was only in Auschwitz from the end of June\nto October, and at that point they were looking for German citizens. Suddenly I became\n[indecipherable] German citizen. Was elevated. And they were looking for laborers, labor for a --\nfor a factory. And that\u2019s when we were shipped out, and then we were shi -- there were -- we -- it\nmust have been all the way up north, and -- and what is it called, they have -- they have the --\nright by the -- you know, the -- where the bogs are, what is it called?",
        "Q: That region of -- of Germany, you mean?",
        "A: Yeah, and I don\u2019t know what it is called. And then they transport -- they had no place for us,\nso they pick -- they pitched enormous tents, like circus tents and they put us in there, and there\nwas a storm and one of the tents collapsed. It was horrible.",
        "Q: Where is this?",
        "A: That was in Germany.",
        "Q: In a -- a different camp?",
        "A: Yeah, w-we were on transport. And they kept us there for while, and the horrible part there\nwas it was very damp, and it was very wet, and the only place -- th-the onl -- they built a latrine.\nAll they did was dig a hole, put -- took the bark off the trees and made a landing, so to say, and\nthen put a log across, and my biggest fear was to fall in, to slip because it was wet. I -- I mean,\nyou n -- you walked there and your -- your -- you wore those wooden shoes and they would stick\nin the mud, you know? So here you are, going up on this little --",
        "Q: Like a ledge --",
        "A: -- like a -- a platform, but it was all tree -- 1t was like an -- a -- a logs, but they had no bark on\nit, because if you had bark on it, you don\u2019t slip. And my fear was to fall in there. And from there\nwe went to Bergen-Belsen, and we just hung there until we came -- wi -- they send us to the\nammunition factory.",
        "Q: Now, I want go back for a moment. Do you think you would recognize -- I have a map of\nAuschwitz -- of Birkenau, and I don\u2019t know if you would be able to point out any of the places\nwhere you remember being, or -- I know you said when you were first there, you were in a\ncertain area with Marianne. I don\u2019t know if any of this looks familiar to you.",
        "A: No. We were in block 13, and you know what the greatest -- the most horrible part about\nAuschwitz was, to me anyway, was that I could not comprehend -- now I understand, but then I\ncouldn\u2019t comprehend, the cru -- the cruelty of the -- of the Jewish people to -- you know, like the\nblockoma, okay? I walked -- when we were there, the first day, I went up to a young kid, she had\nher mother and her sister with her, she was younger than I am, beautiful, beautiful girl, Polish.\nAnd I ask her to -- the house -- the bunk was empty, if Mariani could go inside. It was brutally\nhot, and humid. She wouldn\u2019t let her go in, okay? And I said, if I ever come across her, I'll really\nkill her. I had such anger at her. I did come across her. What did she do? At -- we were li -- at the\nday we were liberated, she -- I s -- suddenly see her, what\u2019d she do? There was a German kid,\nand she knocked him off his bike and she took the bike. And I said, you know what? I wouldn\u2019t\neven dirty my hands on her. It was -- it was so -- I mean, I-I could not understand, you know,\nthat the -- the kapos and whatever, would -- I mean, she wasn't specially cruel, she was dumb,\nbecause she had entry to clothing and everything, and she would parade -- she was a kid -- sh -- I\n-- | remember one day she had a pink peignoir with feathers and slippers and a cigarette holder,\nand she would parade through the -- I mean, she was a kid. She was beautiful but she was --\nmaybe she was maybe 16 or 17.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Did you have other experiences like that, or see other --",
        "A: No, no, she was the -- really, she was the only one. But a-as I said, when I was there, I\ncouldn\u2019t comprehend the cruelty. But that -- that was the method. That\u2019s what the -- that was ve-\nvery German type -- you know, that\u2019s -- that was their method of doing it, because that really\ngnawed in your ment -- on your mind. I mean, now I understand it, because they had to survive\nthemselves, okay? That was their way of surviving. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if I\nwould have been in the position. So you -- you can\u2019t really blame them, but at -- a-at -- at the\ntime, I could not understand it.",
        "Q: Now you at first were with Marianne --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- staying with her, and then what happened, you were separated?",
        "A: We were separated, I went -- see, Mariani had -- she w -- Mariani was stateless, so she had no\n-- she did not have an Austrian --",
        "Q: And why was that, do you know?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know, that I don\u2019t know. But they were looking for German citi -- citizens to -- to\n-- we didn\u2019t know for what. And they wanted us to work in an ammunition factory, and we did.\nThat\u2019s where we fi -- that\u2019s -- that was the lifesaving part of it, because I was only in camp for 11\nmonths.",
        "Q: When -- when you were with Marianne, or when you were still in Auschwitz but you were\nseparated from her, would you still have occasion to see her?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, we -- yeah, she was in a different -- she was in a different block and I was in a\ndifferent block.",
        "Q: And how would you get to see one another, or --",
        "A: Y-You w -- you were f -- you can\u2019t say you were free to walk, but you were -- you know, like\nfor instance, I once -- I knew my -- my -- we were -- when we were going out for w-work, my\nbrother\u2019s group was walking this -- we were going the opposite directions, and once I -- I gave\nsome bread for some garlic. And I -- you know, you had that thing that there\u2019s certain things you\nshould try to get to eat, to s -- to -- like we do today, we go to the health food store, you know?\nSo -- and I handed it to him and they caught him. They caught me and they caught him, and I just\n-- I happened to -- there was a kapo there, a woman, and her boyfriend told me that he was\nalright at the time. That\u2019s -- you know -- because I didn\u2019t know what they were going to do to\nhim. It just s -- and he -- you know, he s -- put his hand out, I put mine out in walking by and\nsomebody saw it, so that was a bad experience.",
        "Q: And with Marianne you were able to spend time with her and -- and --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, she knew where I was, she knew -- and I don\u2019t know where she\nwas, but we were -- we were together and we were apart, and sometimes we were in the same\nbunk, then we were separated and then we come back into the same bunk.",
        "Q: Do you think it was important for you to have someone like that -- her there, and --",
        "A: Oh definitely, definitely. Yeah [indecipherable] it was important for -- I suppose important for\nher, and you know, I was -- I was -- though I was eight -- 19, I was still, you know, I don\u2019t know\nif you can say a kid. I mean, I was -- I wasn\u2019t this exposed to the world, so at that point I looked\nat her as a -- a -- aco -- how shall I say, guardian or si -- whatever, you know\u201d? At one point I go\n-- I was desperate, I told her I had -- I had lice, you know? And she said, \u201cYou take care of yours\nand I take care of mine.\u201d",
        "Q: She was scared to get it?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Was she scared to get it from you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I mean -- you know? So -- but there was nothing she could do for me.",
        "Q: She told me some story about showering in the middle of the night, do you remember this?\nTaking cold showers in the middle of the night to stay --",
        "A: No, that I don\u2019t know. You couldn\u2019t go out. I mean, at night you couldn\u2019t -- you were in,\nokay? And the worst thing which could happen to you, that was in Birkenau, is -- you know, you\nhad a bucket for elimination, so there was a thing which, if you were the last one in the morning\nto use that, because if you used it the last one, 1t was you who carried it out. As I said, if you\ndon\u2019t laugh, you cry. When I -- when we first went -- got there, you know, we undressed, we\nwent into the shower, they cut your hair. They tattooed you and they gave you clothes. And you\nhave to remember we came from -- that we want to say normal life. We had normal clothes on\nand here I get whatever they gave me, I know what it was. It was a navy blue, straight dress. And\nit had a whatever on there. And I had to go to the bathroom and the latrines all have the\nwindows. And I\u2019m si -- I\u2019m looking in and I see a -- somebody standing there in the reflection in\nthe window, you know? And I turn around and I\u2019m looking for the person. It was me. Didn't\nrecognize myself, because my hair was cut, and I had this funny dress on, and here I am, looking\n-- looking around, I thought maybe there\u2019s somebody, you know, there must be somebody in\nback of me, it wasn\u2019t me. And at -- suddenly I realized, it\u2019s you.",
        "Q: Was this a real shock to your system?",
        "A: Yes, that was a shock, because you know, I had no mirr --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen. This is tape number three, side A.",
        "A: A transformation, yeah, I mean I had long hair. Suddenly I -- I was -- we were lucky, our hair\nwasn\u2019t shorn. So -- you know, and I remember they cut it, and the shock was such, you know, it -\n- we was -- within a couple of hours that you came from -- want to call it normal environment\ninto -- in -- into -- you know, just totally different.",
        "Q: So this is right upon arrival?",
        "A: Right upon arrival, okay, you\u2019re -- here I am. I\u2019m looking. Who 1s this person? And the shock\nto see it is me, and I was always very well endowed. Here I had no bra on.

        "Q: So what else went with this feeling? I mean, this was obviously very different than anything\nelse you\u2019d already experienced.",
        "A: Right, I mean, th -- it -- 1t wasn\u2019t life threatening or anything, it was just shocking. It was --\nth-the -- the sudden transformation, that was the -- the thing.",
        "Q: When did you receive the tattoo?",
        "A: Right at entry, you know, right when we were in the -- we undressed, I think -- we undressed,\nour hair was cut, went into the sauna, or even -- and I think we might even have gotten the to --\ntattoo right away, cause wi -- went very fast.",
        "Q: Do you remember your number?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me?",
        "A: Yeah. A7268.",
        "Q: And would you mind telling me just this little story you mentioned when we weren\u2019t\nrecording, about describing or trying to tell young children, your children and perhaps your\ngrandchildren what this number on your arm is all about.",
        "A: When -- I always felt that y -- very young children, or children as a rule, to tell them\nsomething adults can\u2019t comprehend was not necessary to convey to them, so I told them that --\nthey wanted to know what my number was and I told them that when I was a little girl my\nmother didn\u2019t want me to get lost, so that was my telephone number. And they took that as -- a-\nas that\u2019s what it was. And as they got older, and they heard and they learned and they never\nquestioned why I said that. They -- you know, they were old -- when they learned and heard\nabout the Holocaust, they were old enough to know that I didn't want to scare them or burden\nthem, and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: And you said there was something that came up because Marianne has a similar number.",
        "A: Yeah, Mariani has it se -- A7265. And they wanted to know how come that her telephone\nnumber and my telephone number is the same.",
        "Q: Did you ha --",
        "A: Similar.",
        "Q: Did you have to answer those kind of que --",
        "A: Well, at that point, you know, we told them, you know. But they were already older, you\nknow. Because then they have heard, you know, the kids hear. We think they don\u2019t, but they do,\nand they might not talk about it, but they, at that point they apparently knew. And whenever they\nask a question I would answer them, but I would never elaborate, because whatever they wanted\nto know they -- they were told, but let them digest it so to say and if they want to know ask more.\nAnd I -- I really feel that when they ask me to speak in the -- in the temple, I said, the children\nonly have to be 13 or 14, and -- and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the same age you were when --",
        "A: Yeah, but I never give it -- I just felt, you know, the ol -- you know, as I said, I -- it\u2019s so\ninteresting because here they are, middle class house, you\u2019re telling them you lived the same life\nand then they see movies and they hear, and then they look at you, and it\u2019s very har -- it -- it\u2019s\nreally not something you can understand, you -- or imagine. You can look at pictures or\neverything. I\u2019m -- as I have said before, and I\u2019Il say it again, that even I can\u2019t believe that al --\nyou can -- you can sink this low and come back.",
        "Q: Now, when you saw Marianne\u2019s husband Otto going to this one side --",
        "A: No, we had -- we had no idea.",
        "Q: When -- when did you learn?",
        "A: When we got into camp. When we got in -- 1n -- into the blocks, you know, and we met other\nprisoners. I mean, I once -- there was one lady who came in from Theresienstadt, and the\nchimneys were going and the smell -- I mean, you can -- when you -- when hair burns and when\nflesh burns, you smell it. And she thought it was a bakery, because that\u2019s what she was told. All\nright? So it\u2019s really -- you know, it\u2019s not only I who ca -- who, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s just some -- I mean, you\nsee the smoke, you see the s -- you -- you have the smell, and she was told it\u2019s a bakery.",
        "Q: But -- but you knew otherwise pretty soon?",
        "A: Oh yeah -- no -- well, of cour -- once you\u2019re there, you knew.",
        "Q: And is that smell one of your most dominant memories of --",
        "A: No, no. I ha -- I was -- when I came here and I married, and I had -- eventually had children, I\nwanted them -- I wasn\u2019t ga -- I-I was not going to burden them with my background. Since I\ncan\u2019t comprehend, there was no reason to -- t-to -- you know, you -- to do that, becau -- you have\nto eat that, because I didn\u2019t have anything to eat. I just felt that this wasn\u2019t the right approach, so\nI never do -- dwelled on it, and I wanted tha -- I consciously, subconsciously, I wanted to lead as\nnormal a life as one can.",
        "Q: And you think this did help you, this approach?",
        "A: Yeah, because I -- I don\u2019t dwell on it, I don\u2019t feel sorry for myself. It\u2019s a part of history I\ncould have lived without, and everybody else could have. But it happened, can\u2019t be undone,\nthat\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Did you ever at the time let your emotions get the better of you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no, because I -- I -- everybody\u2019s ho-ho -- every inmate hoped to get out,\nokay? If 1t wasn\u2019t tomorrow it was the day after. You -- you -- I myself always -- I always -- I\nwas invisible. Stand, stand, sit, sit. Three hours, two hours, it didn\u2019t matter. [indecipherable]\nbrainless, I don\u2019t know. It was just -- I felt that this was -- by looking at the situation I felt that\nthis was the -- the only way to survive. You tried to be well, you tried stay out of the hospital,\nand -- and that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: When did you learn what had happened to your brother?",
        "A: When I came out, when we were liberated, when -- when I came back to Vienna.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know what had happened to him at Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, th-the -- we said, whenever we get separated, whatever we\u2019ll be, we come back to\nVienna. And -- and that was it.",
        "Q: And -- and what did happen to him?",
        "A: I -- he went into tra -- he was in tr -- he went in trans -- into selection, he got gassed. So they\nhad -- they have -- the Germans are very good keepers of data. They have -- every sa -- have -- I\ncan\u2019t find it, but I have it. They tell you what transport they went in, they tell you when they\nwent into the gas chamber, they know every -- everything is documented.",
        "Q: At some point at Auschwitz you didn\u2019t see him any more, but you didn't know --",
        "A: No, I mean, and I -- once you ch-changed your working -- where we work station, he was sent\nsomeplace else, and they were sent some -- he worked on a -- on a -- it was like an Air Force\nbase, but not active for flying, they were demolishing the planes which were shot down, which\nthey can sal -- it was like a salvage yard or something. I learned that.",
        "Q: And how were you -- not that it\u2019s possible to console someone, but did you spend time with\nMarianne after she learned about her husband, and was it possible to --",
        "A: No, we did -- we didn't know. I mean, we -- we found out, you know, later, but there was no -\n- ye -- you know, you were totally helpless, there was nothing you could do. If you went into a --\na -- a depresh -- if you would have gone into a depression or something, it would have been\ndetrimental to the -- to your -- to your own well being or survival, or whatever. I don\u2019t think we\ndid it consciously, but s -- some -- because the dri -- at that point the drive to survive 1s\nincredible. Even if the chances are small, you don\u2019t realize that the chances are small. You are a -\n- if you\u2019re optimistic, you are going to get out and that\u2019s it, you know, so the mind is a very, very\ncomplicated organ. Is it an organ? No.",
        "Q: The brain, yes.",
        "A: The brain.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: I think the brain, yes.",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s a very, very complicated part of the body.",
        "Q: Were you very worried about being selected as well?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, the last selection I went through was with Mariani and I was -- I had a\nrash, and this was a total no-no. And so Mariani said -- we were falling back, so by the time --\nyou know, you did anything and everything, and I kept my clothes here -- I mean, you\u2019re naked,\nbut you have your possessions. So I went and I -- so I should be -- with the whole thing, you\nknow, a -- apparently they had enough, and here I was, and they gave me -- I showed them my\nnumber and he gave me a push like I almost no -- fell, you know, but they had enough. You\nknow, he didn't want me any more, and neither they didn\u2019t -- and not Mariani either, so -- she\nwas in back of me. So that was that. It\u2019s -- it is t -- as the -- as the dice falls, that\u2019s what it 1s.",
        "Q: Were the living conditions, what were they like in your barracks where you were sleeping?",
        "A: Yeah, the regular barracks, I mean --",
        "Q: Was it very cramped and -- and --",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t remember how many we were, but we slept head foot, foot head, you\nknow? I think probably te -- I -- I really don\u2019t know how many. At least 10.",
        "Q: Were you with other Jewish women also from Austria, or where were they from?",
        "A: No, w-we were -- I don\u2019t really know where they all came from, but no, no, just -- we came in\nwith the Hungarian transport. When we came in the Hungarian transports were just coming in.\nThat\u2019s why I have an A, because most -- most older Hungarian transports who had tattoos, got an\nA. I mean, they prac -- I mean, it was 11 months before the war was over.",
        "Q: Now, tell me about how you learned about your parents? Did you learn something about their\nfate while you were in Auschwitz?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: That\u2019s also after?",
        "A: No, also after. There wa -- th-there was a transport came in and there was one woman from\naus -- from Theresienstadt, and I ask her if she knew my mother, a be -- my mother had red --\nvery, very dark red hair, and so I described her to her, so she says, yes, she knew her, she walked\n-- she worked in the laundry, okay? But she said, you know, she ca -- all right, this lady came to\nAuschwitz, she doesn\u2019t know what is going to be. And that was it, that\u2019s the last I heard. And my\nparents were th -- transported out, one of the last transports.",
        "Q: To Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And when did you learn about that finally?",
        "A: Not I -- not too long ago that I -- I don\u2019t know how, when and where. I don\u2019t know if it was\nDebbie that we got a -- that sh -- that we received a -- the notice that on this and this date, they\ncame to Auschwitz, and they were gassed.",
        "Q: So you never really knew for sure what had happened to them for many years?",
        "A: No, no, I mean, that\u2019s logi -- that -- you know, they did not survive, because if they would\nhave survived, they would have come back. And this was -- you know, this was their\narrangement, whoever comes back, goes back.",
        "Q: So, there was this one person who gave you little breaks when you were working, but other\nthan that at Auschwitz, were you working very long hours? Was it very difficult work?",
        "A: Yeah, they -- we all did. We stay -- I\u2019m sorry. We went to what -- appelle, okay? And then we\nwent out to work. And then we came back, I -- you know, time and days, I -- one go -- I -- we\ncame back for a whatever, in the early -- late afternoon I suppose, and have appelle, have food\nand go to bed.",
        "Q: Did you ever get a day off?",
        "A: No. What\u2019s a day off? We wouldn\u2019t have known what to do with a day off. No, it was -- it\nwas -- it\u2019s a -- it was detention, it was jail, you know?",
        "Q: Did you feel any connection any more to the religion you\u2019d grown up with, at that time?",
        "A: I -- how -- you know, it\u2019s wa -- I -- I knew I was Jewish. I had no -- I had no -- I have no\nanger. I didn\u2019t ask why me. And it was -- I mean, I would have never changed my religion, or\nyou know, never given it a thought, no.",
        "Q: I mean, did you pray at all while you were in au -- Auschwitz?",
        "A: To survive. But not really pray. Hoping rather than praying.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t necessarily pray to God during that time?",
        "A: Probably not. Probably not. You know, just -- I -- somehow religion never -- never -- never\nentered, you know? The -- the one thing you -- you wanted was to survive. How, when and\nwhere was up to God, right? So it\u2019s -- I really can\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Were there any -- was there any way in which you observed any of the Jewish holidays?",
        "A: No, you wouldn\u2019t know when they were, unless somebody would have had a calendar\nsomeplace, or heard someplace, you know -- I mean, some people had entries to offices and\nthings like that, and they would say, you know, today is -- whatever, okay? Now I knew when I\nwas Selected to -- to leave, it was my mother\u2019s birthday because somebody told me that it was\nOctober the 18\". So I didn\u2019t know when I -- you know, but that -- that\u2019s about it. It was just so\nhappen, but y -- there was no time, you lose time, which is fortunate because you don\u2019t, you\nknow, th-that, there is no time. You can\u2019t tell a week from a month from a day. Didn\u2019t matter if it\nwas Saturday or it was Tuesday, it\u2019s [indecipherable] I mean, to me not anyway.",
        "Q: Marianne said that you know, you had be very resourceful, of course --",
        "A: Very much so.",
        "Q: -- and even to learn to steal food. Did you see that, or --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t be -- I never stole food. I always watched that nobody steal from me, but I never\nstole food. And -- and -- and -- and I bought -- you know, I would -- what is the word?",
        "Q: Exchange?",
        "A: Yeah, trade. But I -- no, I never stole food. That\u2019s the one thing I ta -- I would -- you know,\nyou would be lucky and were able to help to carry the kettle, which meant that when you -- when\nit was all empty, you had the bottom, whatever was there. But otherwise all you had to be was\nthe last one in line to get the potatoes, you had all the peels, which was great. But otherwise --",
        "Q: Now, what was -- what was the situation with your health? Was it changing a lot while you\nwere at Auschwitz?",
        "A: I went from 150 to maybe 70 pounds. So when I got -- I was very sick when the -- when we\nwere liberated. I had -- I had diarrhea, and I had -- it was horrible. To come from the bunk to the\n-- to the latrine was like you -- you know, you were lucky if you made it. And we were liberated\nthe [indecipherable] I think it was the 84\"\" division, and Pa-Patton\u2019s army, they were still coming\ndown. And they opened the gates and of course everybody went out. And I turned around and I\nwent back. I ge -- I could have gotten trampled, but I -- it was so scary, because everybody\npushed out for no reason at all. And we had that -- it was very interesting because the camps for\nthe north -- there were camps in -- further north, above our camp, and --",
        "Q: And now you\u2019re talking about --",
        "A: About the work camp.",
        "Q: And the name is?",
        "A: It was in Salzwedel, it was a -- a converted wire factory, but we made ammunition. I -- I made\nhulls for bullets. And 1t worked in a drum, and every so often a bullet would get stuck, you know\na hull would get stuck, and I would let the machine run. That was my contribution to -- but you\nhad to be careful, because the guard would hear it if she was close by, so you had to be very\ncareful. But that was a -- it was like an achievement. So anyway --",
        "Q: So just to go back, so we\u2019re sort of finishing up when you were at Auschwitz, did you witness\nor have anything to do with any resistance activities there?",
        "A: No, no. We just had to stand once, I don\u2019t know for how many hours because somebody\nescaped. And they brought him back and they put -- they ha -- they put him in a bunker. Meaning\na bunker was like y-you couldn\u2019t sit, stand straight for -- I mean, I don\u2019t know, I -- that\u2019s what I\nwas told, that you could not stand straight. And we had to stand appelle. And then once they\nhung somebody in front of everybody to show them what happened when you escape. That was\nmy whole --",
        "Q: Do you think you saw these things and reacted emotionally, or do you think you were shutting\ndown your emotions a lot of the time?",
        "A: I think we shut it down. You just shut off, because you cou -- you -- you had to. You know,\nyou -- if you wanted to survive, you could not -- you couldn\u2019t -- you -- you just couldn\u2019t wallow\n-- you couldn\u2019t be -- wallop in it, you couldn\u2019t -- and you could not come back to -- to a normal\nlife 1f you would. I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Do you have any sense if most of the others around you were reacting similarly? Did you talk\nwith others about this sort of thing?",
        "A: You know, I have very little contact with people who -- I-I just hear, okay? Debbie has a\nfriend, it was -- it\u2019s -- oh, and his parents are survivors, and he looked at me, and he said, \u201cHow\ncome you\u2019re so normal?\u201d I didn't -- I really did not -- I di -- I -- so his wife to -- I don\u2019t know if\nit\u2019s his wi -- it -- both parents, I -- I really -- and she said, \u201cI want you to meet my mother.\u201d And I\nsaid to Debbie, \u201cDebbie, this is not -- I\u2019m not doing this, you know?

It\u2019s been, and I -- you can\u2019t let it take\nhold of you. It\u2019s been, it\u2019s like when somebody pa -- dies -- when somebody passes away. I\nmean, it\u2019s not fun to have lost my husband, but that\u2019s life. He lived a good life, he enjoyed his\nchildren, he enjoyed his family, that\u2019s it. Maybe camp made me like that, I don\u2019t know. I really\ndon\u2019t. Sometimes I think there\u2019s something wrong with me. I really do. But, as I said, that was --\nmy thing was that I did not want to mutilate my children, because I have seen people do it. I have\n-- | have a friend who has -- was not in camp, whole family survived, and she mutilated her\nchildren. For no reaso -- you know, it\u2019s for no reason at all.

        "Q: Do you feel hatred some of the time?",
        "A: No, really not, really not. It\u2019s a -- whom do you hate? You hate a phantom. You can\u2019t -- you\ncan only hate when you hate one person, okay? So you\u2019re not really -- you can\u2019t -- you can\u2019t\nmake everybody responsible, though they were, the great majority of the people were, okay, but\nthat -- that\u2019s the way it was. That\u2019s the way it is, right? We haven\u2019t learned. And of course,\nbecause it was only Jews, nobody was really interested in helping. I mean, we thought America\nwas the great -- the -- the greatest th-thing God every created, right? But as -- as -- as you go\nalong, there is -- there is -- it\u2019s still better than any other place. So, that\u2019s it, right?",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- also tell me what happened at this point with Marianne. She did not go with you?",
        "A: She -- Marianne stayed in Auschwitz, in poy -- in Birkenau, okay. She was liberated by the\nRussians in January, we were liberated in May. I think she went to -- she went in the\n[indecipherable] I believe it was, she told me, to Romania. And from there she went -- I don\u2019t\nknow, to Vienna, I believe, or to Italy. I really don\u2019t know because her sister was in Italy, her\nbrother was in Venezuela.. So I -- that -- I -- I really don\u2019t know. I found my -- I -- I knew a sold\n-- an American soldier, Jewish and he went to Vienna, and I ask him to go to the Jewish agency\nto find if my -- if -- who is alive and who isn\u2019t. And I gave him the names and among them he\nfound Mariani. And she wa -- at -- in the time I think -- I believe she was a nurse in the Jewish\nhospital there. And so he told her that I was alive in Linz. I could not come down because the ru\n-- there was the Russian zone in between. And finally I borrowed an I.D. card and I took the\ntrain, and I ba -- and I got through. And the Russian -- you know, the Russians were coming into\nthe play -- the train and look for I.D. cards. The als -- the other danger was if they liked you they\ncan take you out. So here we were, okay. So we went -- so I went and I went with another girl,\nand I get to the street where Mariani lives, it\u2019s about 11 o\u2019clock at night. And of course after a\ncertain time the doors are locked, and we -- you know, you have to ring for the super. And here I\nhear footsteps on the cobblestones. There were two Russian soldiers coming down. And this was\nan encounter you really weren\u2019t looking for. So -- but finally what happened was I had pennies,\nand I so -- and I saw -- and I saw a light in the window. And I knew what floor she was on, but I\ndidn\u2019t know if it was her window. And suddenly she passed her window, so here I am throwing\nthe pennies, and she finally realized, you know? So she came -- she opened up and she came\ndown just before they -- before those Russian came up, and I -- that\u2019s how I me -- that\u2019s how I\nmet and saw Mariani the first time.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen. This is tape number three, side B. Okay, continue -- you were telling me about a storm.",
        "A: It was a terrible storm, and the tent we were in collapsed. Now, we were just sitting on straw,\nI don\u2019t know how many hundreds of people in one tent, and it was terrible. And from there they\nmoved us to Bergen-Belsen for a very short time. I couldn\u2019t tell you if it was a week, or two\nweeks, but our transport went to Salzwedel into an ammunition factory. And there -- that was\nfrom October to May, when I was liberated.",
        "Q: Now at Bergen-Belsen, were you telling me something about Anne Frank while you were\nthere?",
        "A: I an -- I heard only recently that she was on a transport where they housed them in huge tents\nbefore getting to Bergen-Belsen, so I said that that must have been the transport. In Bergen-\nBelsen, be -- that was in the very, very beginning of Bergen-Belsen, I tho -- because there were\njust barracks there, we didn\u2019t do anything, we just sat around all day long, and -- until we were\ntransported to the factory. And there we worked two weeks day shift, two weeks night shift. As\nsoon as the body got accustomed to -- to day shift, we went to night shift and the other way\naround. But there we were only maybe eight or 10 girls in one room, and we had a -- was\nwintertime and we had a stove there which came in very handy because we used to wet the\nseams of our clothes and put them up against -- on the stove pipe, to steam it, to kill the fl -- to\nkill the lice.",
        "Q: That seems very resourceful.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s all we had. That and DDT. And -- a-and we worked. We left in the morning and\ncame hom -- and then that was really almost if you can call it luxury because we had a purp --\nyou know, we were indoors. The only scary part there was apparently they knew that that was in\neffec -- there were als -- there were also French prisoner of war camps around there, and they\ndidn't bomb us, but we -- th -- we mo -- they moved us into the -- into the place where they kept\nthe ammunition. It wasn\u2019t very secure feeling, it wasn\u2019t, because we -- we were right there, the\nwhole thi -- if they would have ever bombed it, the whole thing would have gone up. But they\nnever bombed there. They flew over, but they never bombed.",
        "Q: What did you know about the war at this stage?",
        "A: We -- we -- we didn\u2019t -- we knew it wasn\u2019t going well because there was one elderly\ngentleman there who befriended one of the prisoners who was -- she converted from ju -- to\nChristianity and he was married to a Christian. And he contacted her husband and he was the\nperson who would always tell us, you know, it\u2019s going good, or it\u2019s going bad, or whatever. So\nthere we had some semblance of knowledge at the time. But unfortunately somebody reported\nhim, and I don\u2019t -- he -- they jailed him. I hope he -- you know, he was a real nice old gentleman.",
        "Q: Did you remain optimistic during this time?",
        "A: We were always optimistic. We had to be. If you wanted -- if you -- you tried to survive, and\nthe only way to survive was to be optimistic that some -- something will -- Americans are wi --\ngo -- Americans are going to come, they\u2019re going to -- the war is going to be over.",
        "Q: Was it only other women working at this camp?",
        "A: Yeah, just women. Was just -- yeah, there were just women. We had the -- the German\nsupervisors, you know, people who used to work in the factory before were supervisors, and of\ncourse we had the guards.",
        "Q: How did they treat you?",
        "A: There was no friction there. There was no friction there. I mean, I was told once -- I had -- I\nmu -- I don\u2019t know what I did, I -- probably I let that thing run, and she told me that if I don\u2019t --\nif I keep it up I won\u2019t be around long, so I was very careful.",
        "Q: But on a daily basis --",
        "A: Yeah, no, th -- on the daily, you worked, you -- no, you worked you -- you had your -- your\nlunch period, your -- you -- you were treated like a moral -- I mean, you were a prisoner, but you\nwere treated like a worker. So --",
        "Q: And that\u2019s considered a slave labor camp, right?",
        "A: Yeah, that was slave la -- I mean, it was all slave labor.",
        "Q: Do you receive reparations for having worked there? Or do you receive, you know, restitution\nmoney?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t get -- no, I don\u2019t get anything from Germany, I have a -- I have a disability from\nAustria and I get Social Security from Austria because I -- because you know, I -- I never -- I\nnever worked legally in Austria but they give me Social Security. What is it, I think 300 some\nodd dollars a month. And -- and when th -- when they first started to give ref -- reparation, I was\ngoing to send it back, I was so in -- I was so -- really, I was so upset, I said I\u2019m sending it ma -- I\nthink it was 500 dollars or something, and I was going to go and send it back and they said, you\nstupid?",
        "Q: Now -- excuse me, I was reading -- I was reading in a survivor\u2019s memoir about Salzwedel --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and read an interesting story about the water faucets in the camp, and I was wondering if\nyou knew anything about this. She wrote that the water faucets in the camp were wired with\nbombs. Had you ever heard anything about that?",
        "A: No, no, that I have never -- I mean saw -- Salzwedel was a -- I mean, was luxury. We -- I\nmean, we worked. We were -- the f -- the food wasn\u2019t food, but 1t was wi -- compared to -- to --\nto Auschwitz it was, you know. We were laborers, so they knew enough to give wa -- you know,\nwe -- it was only soup also, but it was more a -- you know, we were laborers, they needed us at\nthat point.",
        "Q: Was it difficult work?",
        "A: No, I mean, I just monitored a machine. The machine did the work. You know, all they did\nwas make the -- they stamped the hulls. Some people probably had more, you know, heavier\nwork, I was just lucky to get this machine.",
        "Q: And was it -- you said it was only women, was it also only Jewish women in this camp?",
        "A: I think so. I think so. Because when we would -- u-unless they came from other places too, I\nreally couldn\u2019t say that for -- the people I knew, you know, only the supervisors were old wor --\nyou know, the workforce from before.",
        "Q: And what about routines like there was also appelle and roll call at this camp?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I th -- no, we just came home, washed, went for food, went back. No, I don\u2019t\nthink so. I don\u2019t believe so. Maybe they counted as we lined up for food, I really don\u2019t\nremember, but I really don\u2019t think so. I cannot remember having to get up and standing outside.",
        "Q: And now we get to the time of liberation, so tell me a little bit more. I know you -- also you\nalready mentioned people, the women, flooding the gate. But what else are your impressions?",
        "A: What do you mean flooding the gate?",
        "Q: Oh --",
        "A: Oh yeah, going out",
        "Q: Rushing to the gate. What other first impressions do you have?",
        "A: My first impression was that we had -- all the guards from the other camps came to our camp.\nThey tore off their insignia and they also had prisoners come from other camps, they brought\nthem down, but they themselves tore off all their insignia on their clothes. And I have to say\nAmericans treated them with kid gloves. I -- it was absolutely revolting to watch. Revolting in a\nway, in another way admirable, because the only -- wa -- the only incident happened, the cook,\nwho was a German soldier, ran, and the guy in the turret shot him, and they let him lay there for I\ndon\u2019t know how many, a couple of days. But that was the only -- how shall I -- incident which\nwas -- that you say was any type of -- can\u2019t say cruel, what happened. But the -- the -- the camp\ncommander, everybody was treated, it was just absolutely disgusting to watch. I mean, I didn\u2019t\nme -- y-you know, they weren't always -- they were -- weren't even treated as -- as -- as pris -- as\nprisoners or anything. They were just handled with such -- almost they were guests. It was\ndisgusting to watch.",
        "Q: And did they stay there, or did they just walk free, and walk out?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. They -- they -- they were -- but they were -- it -- it was done in such a laissez-\nfaire way, you know\u201d? And of course there were someth -- you know, were peop -- jewi -- some\nof the prisoners who were in the office in work, they spoke for them and told them that they were\nmarvelous and whatever else. I mean, we weren\u2019t mistreated, don\u2019t misunderstand. I mean, it\nwas -- it was total luxury compared to before. So that -- that was interesting and I wa --\nsomething very funny happened. As the troops were going through, I said it was so American. I\nmean, they were young kids, you know, it was th -- practic -- the end of the war, and they must\nhave got -- found food in farms or wherever, whatever they, you know, collected. They u -- they\nthrew eggs, cartons of eggs at us, we should catch them. As the trucks were -- they were going\nvery slow, I have to say, but as they were moving through, they were throwing eggs.",
        "Q: Did a lot of eggs break?",
        "A: All of them broke. And then they fed us and they made chicken soup with rice. And it was\nmore fat than soup, and I would say 99 percent the people got jaundiced.",
        "Q: How about you, how was your health?",
        "A: And I didn\u2019t, because I didn\u2019t eat. I was -- I was so sick that I -- I ca -- I mean, I was afraid to\ntake anything in. So you walked around, everybody was yellow. It was -- it was funny. It wasn\u2019t\nfunny, but it was funny. And -- and it took me awhile to go out. I waited until you -- you know\nthe -- the flow stopped, and then I went out, but I had no place to go.",
        "Q: And when you went out, that was the last time you saw that place, you just left? Or did you\ncome back?",
        "A: I -- you know, no, they transported us onto an Air Force base, and we stayed there for a\ncouple of -- you know, time is very difficult to remember. I don\u2019t know if it was weeks or\nmonths. And th -- and I was with Hungarian girls there, and -- and we went to ha -- we go -- we\nstarted to work at the British officer\u2019s home, keeping house [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Where wa -- where was this?",
        "A: In Hanover. And from there I tried to get back to Vienna. You know, wh-when everything\ncalmed. And one day there was a bus going, and I took it. And I ended up in Linz and I couldn\u2019t\ngo any further because there was the Russian zone in between. So I looked for a place to stay. I\nwas with two other girls. And I found a -- I found a room, and I found it -- and I looked for a job.\nAnd I worked for the civil censor, which -- there was a -- the amer -- an -- a unit there which was\nall -- well, most of them -- most of them spoke German, and a lot of them were -- and one of\nthem were Jewish. And I ca -- I got the job there, and I was able to rent a -- the room, and I met a\nyoung man and a bi -- he -- and he said to me, what are you going to do here, you know. And I\nhad a cou -- I have a cou -- I have a cousin in Israel and he asked me if I wanted to come live on\na kibbutz. And that\u2019s the one thing I could not -- I couldn\u2019t even imagine, living with people.\nThat\u2019s the one thing I ga -- you know, I -- I just couldn't -- so I didn't want to go. And he said to\nme, what are you going to do here, you know. So I said, well I don\u2019t know, you know, I will see.\nGo back [indecipherable] eventually I get back to Vienna. And he says, would you really want to\nlive here? So I said, I don\u2019t know. So anyway, he wrote to his brother. I remembered my mother\n-- my father\u2019s sister, her husband came here, and I remembered the address of the brother he\nwent to stay with in Brooklyn, Stillwell Avenue, and I knew the -- I remembered the number,\ndon\u2019t ask me today. I remembered the number, and I knew it was Stillwell Avenue and it wa -- I\nknew it was Brooklyn, and I knew he had a plumbing business. So anyway, this friend of mine,\nPaul, wrote to his brother, and his brother put an ad in the paper to look for him -- in Aufbau, the\n-- the German refugee paper. And he, in turn, looked for my -- for my uncle, and he in turn got in\ntouch with my mother\u2019s uncle who eventual -- whose -- whose in-laws eventually sent me a visa,\nand I came here on the second boat crossing the -- crossing over.",
        "Q: Now when was that and where did you leave from?",
        "A: I left from Hamburg. I -- what happened is I worked, okay, and I went on vacation. And I got\na call from my landlady that the American embassy is looking for me. And so I went -- got on\nthe train and I went back and I contacted them, and they wanted -- you know, they told me that I\nhave a visa to go, and they made an appointment for an examination, and I was lucky because I\nhad silicosis, which I didn't know. Wek -- you know, I didn\u2019t know, I was -- I gained wek -- from\n70 pounds I went to 150 so I was roly-poly, you know. I didn't look sick, nothing hurt me. S --\nand I remember the nurse at the embassy, she listened and she listened and she listened, and --\nbut eventually she let me go. S -- and I only found out when I came to the States, almost a year\nlater, that that\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: How did you find out a year later?",
        "A: How? I was treated for -- they treated -- a year later they treated me for TB. And sputum,\neverything was negative, but I was [indecipherable] they didn\u2019t know, took x-rays, they see\nspots. So I stayed in bed. First I stayed in bed for six months, that didn\u2019t help because I was do --\nwhat happened was, when I weighed -- I mean, I came here, I weighed 150 pounds, you know? I\nhad a friend, a school friend from Vienna, and she was beautiful, she was tall, slim, blonde. She\nlooked at me and she said, nobody in America walks around like this. So what\u2019d she do, she\ntakes me to a European doctor, a woman. And she gave me ups, downs, ons and overs. Pills. I\nwent down to 113 pounds, and I started coughing. So I had to -- I went to the doctor, so they took\nan x -- they -- no, he sent -- so I went to the doctor and he said I have to go to a rest home. And\nhe sent me up someplace close to Monticello and I was -- I was the -- I was the youngest person\nthere, everybody was recuperating, it was -- it -- it was from the workman\u2019s circle. I didn't\nbelong. Why -- how I got there, I don\u2019t know. And the nurse there said everybody should have\nan x-ray. So I said, okay, I have an x-ray, I -- I had nothing to do. Took an x-ray. She brings it --\nLiberty was a big TV -- TB center. And the doctor looks at it, and he said, put her into the\npavilion. They had a t -- a TB pavilion up there. And I picked up the phone and I called my\nhusband, I said, can you pick me up? He said, no I can\u2019t, so I said, I\u2019m taking the bus. And I took\nthe bus back to New York, and I went to my doctor and of course they treated me for TB. Then,\nat the time, streptomycin came out, which was a very dangerous drug, and I -- they gave it to me,\nthat was four injections a day for a week, three, two, and then one for two weeks. I got that three\ntimes. Nothing changed. So, after six months, finally they decided I should go see somebody\nelse. And the woman worked for the city, and she says she wo -- she happened to be Viennese,\nand she said to me, get up, lead a normal life, and wait. I did that. And then I went to the Vincent\nAster diagnostic center. I don\u2019t know if this still exists, but you -- you -- it\u2019s -- you pay, but you\nget a specialist assigned to you, and I was lucky, and the man wrote his thesis on silicosis. And\nhe ada -- he diagnosed me and that was it, and he said, so and so many percentage die, somebody\n-- some recover somewhat and some recover. And that was it. And I thought -- and then -- and\nthat was it.",
        "Q: This was sort of a major health issue that kept following you around after the war.",
        "A: In fact, in fact, somebody started a class action suit. I didn't even know about it. One day I got\na letter that whoever produced the drug, I can\u2019t remember any more, I will get a check because --\nI didn\u2019t do anything. They must have -- I don\u2019t know how it works, but apparently every\ndrugstore knew at the time what drugs were administered to whom, so they found out that I got it\ntoo. I think that -- I think it was a thousand dollars or something, at the time it was like I didn\u2019t\nknow where it came from. But that was it.",
        "Q: Now, to go back, I mean how was your health in the immediate aftermath of being liberated?\nWere you able to rebound fairly quickly?",
        "A: Yeah, I rebound, I rebound, and I was careful, of course, right away what I was eating, and I\nprobably went to a doctor or something. That I can\u2019t even remember any more. But apparently it\nwent away, and I started to gain weight and I went back up to 150 pounds.",
        "Q: And at liberation, can you describe some part of the feeling, and also the feeling of others\naround you. Were people emotional? Did you feel emotional?",
        "A: Yes, but you know what? He -- it was so -- something so totally -- you couldn\u2019t comprehend\nit. You know, everybody was pushing out, and I was in the middle, and -- and I just stopped -- I\ndidn't wa -- you know, I just stood there and let everybody else pass me because I was so\noverwhelmed. Ye -- it -- it was something you were waiting for, and when it happened, you were\nlike stunned. It was something you couldn\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t know why I wanted to go back. It was\njust a reaction I had. Probably security. Because here I was in no man\u2019s land. I mean, I -- I didn\u2019t\nknow the town.",
        "Q: I read in this other survivor\u2019s memoir that in the town there were department stores, and that\nsome of the prisoners -- the women from Salzwedel, from the camp, were going into the town.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: Did you see this, or part of --",
        "A: -- I saw that, I saw re -- soldiers doing it. I saw people doing it. It\u2019s not my -- it\u2019s --",
        "Q: Did you go as well?",
        "A: No. It\u2019s not my temperament, you know? I ti -- somehow or other I -- I -- 1t\u2019s not me. Yeah, I\nsaw that, yeah. This is the like the gurd -- th-the -- the -- the blockoma who knocked the kid off\nthe bike for no reason at all, because what\u2019s she going to do with the bike? You know? I mean,\nwhat that little kid ever do to her? So, I mean -- if she would have [indecipherable] confront\nsomebody, adult or something, you know, but to knock the -- I mean, she literally knocked the --\nI see her in front of me. And of course I had no use for her to start off. You know, so -- no, that\u2019s\n-- yeah, that\u2019s the -- the -- I -- I would watch the soldiers go into apartments. You know, once we\nwalked on the street, and I would watch, but th -- I\u2019d -- how shall I say? I had no n -- I shouldn\u2019t\nsay I had no need to -- what -- wha -- what could you get? I mean, you go in, what do you take?\nYou know, I mean, why? So I -- I -- th-that wasn\u2019t my thing. I mean, I wa -- it just -- I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: Were you talking with the American soldiers who liberated you?",
        "A: No, because they weren't -- th-they were stri -- it was strictly -- there was a war going. I mean,\nthey was going to the -- to take the next tow -- town.",
        "Q: So they kept moving?",
        "A: They kept moving. I mean, there was some left behind, okay, who -- the administration, but --\nbut that was it, you know. And as I said, basically how -- how we got to Hanover I cannot\nremember. That -- the reason, how they moved us, all I know is we got there.",
        "Q: And 1s there a point where you really felt finally free? Was that still at Salzwedel, or a --\nlater?",
        "A: You -- you feel free, but you have no place to g -- you don\u2019t belong, you have no place to go.\nWhat next? You were still -- you lived -- you still lived with 20 girls. You still -- your food was\nstill given to you. There wasn\u2019t -- really no normalcy. I mean, to -- you know, and you didn\u2019t\nknow when it\u2019s going to be and how it\u2019s going to be. To me it was strictly that I was trying to get\nback to Vienna. I couldn\u2019t, so I had to start in Linz, where I was.",
        "Q: When\u2019s the first time you felt a more normal life again?",
        "A: When I had a -- when I had a room. When I had a room to myself. And it -- you know, and\nthey -- si -- it -- si -- since there was occupation, it was still not -- it was a sti -- it still wasn\u2019t\nnormal.",

        "A: In Linz?",
        "Q: -- you were --",
        "A: Yeah, that was in Linz, because our association mostly was with -- it wasn\u2019t with the\npopulation because if you li -- if you believe it or not, you were still the Jew.

        "Q: Did you still feel some anti-Semitism at that time there?",
        "A: Oh yeah, of course. You go back you feel it now, you have it now. You know, I mean, the\nAustrians are -- they were victims, they di -- were not -- believe me, I mean, they were definitely\nvictims.

        "A: Yeah, we went -- but I -- I never settled there. You know, I visited Mariani, I stayed with\nMariani and I went back to Linz. And she was in -- she was in Vienna.

        "A: Oh yeah, that -- no, that -- you know, that was already -- that was already in 1945, okay, so\ndefinitely I mean, but nobody came back. In fact, my -- my father\u2019s two uncles -- two brothers\nweren\u2019t even back then, and they came back much, much later. In fact, they came back -- I mean,\nI was here already and I -- I found out from my cousin in Israel that her father and his brother\ncame back, but they were, at that point, they w -- I -- you know, it\u2019s so very difficult, when\nyou're young, everybody at a certain age is old. So I have no reference to think how old they\nwere. So --",

        "Q: I know we\u2019ve talked about your emotions throughout this period. What were your emotions\nlike when you realized your family members weren\u2019t coming back to Vienna?",
        "A: I was happy to see Mariani, but that was about -- I had no aba -- and gi -- at that poin -- you\nknow, I think the camp does something to you. And I had really no -- you know, you lived from -\n- from minute to minute, from hour to hour, so you were really not -- there was not this much\nemotion, you know, there was no -- you -- I mean, you did not -- you -- you -- you -- it wasn\u2019t a\npsychologically normal situation. And regardless of whatever, I suppose, subconsciously that\u2019s\nwhat happened.",
        "Q: So would you say you, unfortunately you weren't very surprised that your family members\ndidn't return to Vienna? Was that a shock for you at that time?",
        "A: Not a sho -- it -- it -- it was a -- it was -- it\u2019s not a shock, you can\u2019t say it\u2019s a shock, because it\nwas a -- a way of -- 1-it was an ex -- 1-it wasn\u2019t an expectation. You had to hope that they would\nreturn, but it was hope against hope, because that was not the situation.",
        "Q: It\u2019s like you had to prepare yourself for so long that -- mentally that they wouldn\u2019t return.",
        "A: Right, because I mean nobody knew that you\u2019re going to survive. You hoped you would\nsurvive. The last thing was we -- everybody will come back, and that\u2019s it. But when -- when you\nrealize the full -- the -- the com -- you know, what happened, you don\u2019t -- you -- you realize that\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s par -- that was part of the situation and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: When did it sink in for you actually, the magnitude of what had happened during the\nHolocaust?",

        "Q: Crematorium?",
        "A: -- the crematorium, when you saw the smoke and the smell, you knew what was going on, so\nyou were almost prepared for it, because it was -- you know, you -- there were people even in\ncamp that yo -- the underground worked. And this one was working here, and this one was\nworking there, and people were telling stories, so you had -- and -- and -- I see -- when you see\nthe smoke and the smell, you -- you real -- you realize. And then finally you also realize that\nwhen you go into the shower that you never know if you\u2019re going to come out or not. So that was\na -- you walk in, okay, you don\u2019t know what is coming. So this is a situation which 1s -- which\nnobody can comprehend.",
        "Q: Did you think very much about death during those days?",
        "A: No, because we -- be -- you gonna s -- you gonna survive because if you don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re\ngoing to survive, you\u2019re not -- you know, it\u2019s -- you can\u2019t -- you just wouldn\u2019t be able to\nfunction. I mean, you walked the -- you -- you had -- you had no control. You walked in. Is the\nwater going to come, or is the gas going to come? Everybody knew at that point because we\nwere there long enough to know. You walked out, you were lucky. Next time, that\u2019s it. So --",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: -- I wonder what the kids are going to say when they hear this.",
        "Q: I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s good that you\u2019ve been very open. I really appreciate that, and -- and\nI\u2019m sure your family will, too. But I wanted to ask you, did you ever re-establish contact with the\npeople -- any of the people who hid you in Vienna?",
        "A: I tried to. We -- when we went back -- no, I was in contact with the -- with the friends of my\nfather, I was in contact [indecipherable] for awhile. I\u2019m a terrible, terrible -- I hate to write\nletters. I think -- am I analyzing myself? It -- 1t\u2019s something -- a letter to me is a permanent thing,\nand I just hate to write letters. I really do. I\u2019m a talker, I\u2019m on the phone, I hate to write letters.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t like the permanency of the letter?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t like. I just don\u2019t like writing letters, and I --",
        "Q: And it doesn\u2019t matter what language? It\u2019s not just that -- writing in English or a second\nlanguage --",
        "A: No, no, no, has nothing to do with this, absolutely nothing to do with it. I -- I can labor over a\n-- a sympathy card, a get well card. Okay? I mean, it\u2019s the most idiotic thing there 1s.",
        "Q: So -- so you did have some kind of contact, but not -- not --",
        "A: Oh yes, I had contact with them, and I send them things and all. And then when we went to\nAustria, we stopped where the do -- where their daughter lived, and I rang her bell. It was\nlunchtime, but she never answered, so I never saw her.",
        "Q: Whose daughter?",
        "A: The friends of my parents. And th-they had a daughter who was married, and sum --\nSummering, that\u2019s a resort, and she lived there and she had a little store, I can\u2019t remember what it\nwas. And I know she was married there and she divorced, and sh -- but she stayed there, and I ca\n-- | found out where she lives, and I ca -- went to the house and I rang her bell and she never\nanswered the bell, so I walked away.",
        "Q: And did you ever hear of, or have contact with M-Ms. Pukas, who hid you?",
        "A: No, with her I had no contact at all, none at all. When we went back, we stay -- we stayed in a\nhotel around the corner where I was -- where we were hiding. In fact, the window looked down\non the place, but it -- they tore everything down, so it didn\u2019t look familiar at all. It -- 1t was the\nweirdest, weirdest -- and so then I wa -- when I realized where I was, I went there, and those -- I\ntried to see the people who lived in the -- in the building next door -- it was an apartment house\nnext door, out of bricks. And nobody was home, so I couldn\u2019t speak to anybody. But --",
        "Q: So then we get to the point where you get the news that you can go to the U.S..",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit more about the journey and arriving.",
        "A: Well, the journey was we was se -- I was sent to a camp in Munich, a displaced person camp\nwhere they gathered all the people.",
        "Q: Do you know the name of that?",
        "A: No. And there I made friend with a couple of people, and we got on the boat. And we came\nhere --",
        "Q: Do you know when you left? When you left -- you left Hamburg, right?",
        "A: I left Hamburg in -- it was in May. It took 10 days to come here. I think I came here on the 20\n-- no, I got my visa on the 27\". It was a -- I still ca -- I came here in May. I came here in May, so\nthe trip was 10 days. I arrived, and we arrived like this -- we came on a merchant marine. And it\nwas six 0\u2019clock in the morning, the sun was up, and ev -- there were a thousand people on that\nboat, and everybody went to the side of the Statue of Liberty. How we didn\u2019t tilt is a miracle.\nAnd we had a very interesting a -- episode on the pl -- on the -- on the boat coming here. They\nalso transported Germans, repa -- repatriates who were American citizens and decided to go back\nin the war to Germany. Well, one of the men appa -- for whatever reason, jumped off into the\npropeller. And -- course he must have been smithereens. But we had to circle, I don\u2019t know for\nhow many days, I think it was. Was a -- a -- the law that you -- they cannot leave. So I don\u2019t\nknow how m -- it was -- I think it was either two days, or -- it was a long time, I mean, that they\nhad to circle. Of course they couldn\u2019t find him. And I wonder what he did that he got scared\nbecause we were almost here. And then I arrived, and I got off the boat, and my two -- my\nmother\u2019s uncle, and my uncle missed me, so -- so they put me on a -- on a bus, and they brought\nme to the Ansonia on Broadway and what, 74? The old Ansonia, I think it is a -- it is like a -- an\napartment building now, it used to be a hotel. And I wait -- th-they put me the end. I had -- they\ncontacted my uncle because they were looking for me, and so they told them that I was at the\nAnsonia. And you know, by the time they came from the pier, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to hang\naround there, I was going to go look at the neighborhood. I mean, I came from a big city, I wasn't\n-- | mean, I wasn\u2019t a country bumpkin. And I\u2019m -- walk out, and I\u2019m going down to the river,\ngoing toward west end. Suddenly this lady, screaming and frantic. I mean, she was responsible\nfor me.",
        "Q: And how old were you at this time?",
        "A: I was 20. She is -- you know, she\u2019s where are you going, you know, I [indecipherable] you\ncan\u2019t do that. And she held me, and she wasn\u2019t going to let go of me for the rest -- and then\nfinally my uncle and my mother\u2019s uncle came and picked me up. That was my entry to the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: It does seem you have an adventurous spirit.",
        "A: Ah, yeah, I suppose so. You know, I was there, there was nothing for me to do. I wa -- I do\nthe -- I did spe -- I spoke --",
        "Q: Oh, you already knew English?",
        "A: Yes, I knew English, but I mean, not to the -- to the point that I could converse, you know? I\nmean, I knew enough to say that I -- don\u2019t worry about me, you know, I come from a big city.\nBut it was -- I mean, it was funny to me, it wasn\u2019t funny to he -- and --",
        "Q: Was -- was the whole journey coming to the U.S. exciting, or was there, you know --",
        "A: It was -- it was -- we -- my -- to us, I -- I mean, it was adventure. Everybody was seasick, but\na few people were -- fe -- few people, among me, and we weren\u2019t, so we ate. Th-That ship\ncarried enough butter for a 10 day journey. They -- the third day they ran out, because you know,\nthat was something we did not ha -- people didn\u2019t have. So I was introduced to peanut butter, I\nnever knew what peanut butter was. So -- yeah. Th-The journey over here was adventure.",
        "Q: And tell me, how was, just in general, broadly speaking, how was the adjustment living here\nas anew immigrant, learning more of the language, going to school --",
        "A: I -- I stayed with my mother\u2019s uncle, and I -- I worked -- I worked where they made -- they\ndon\u2019t do that any more -- they made things for curling your hair out of leather, you -- there was a\nmetal covered with leather and you rolled your hair. And we -- I did that, and I got a Social\nSecurity card, okay? And there was a number, so I tore it up because I wasn\u2019t going to be another\nnumber. No clue what it was. Just shake your head.",
        "Q: Well --",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s very interesting. I mean, you -- obviously, and that\u2019s something I wanted to ask you,\nyou know, how do you feel that the war time and the Holocaust affected you in the future. I\nmean, there can be countless ways, but are there some things that you could point to?",
        "A: No, Ic -- I really can\u2019t. I ca -- I can\u2019t judge that. I can\u2019t judge that. You can judge it.",
        "Q: Well, there are things that you\u2019re obviously aware of. For instance, that story to me says that -",
        "A: You\u2019re stupid --",
        "Q: -- because of your -- no, because of your experience at Auschwitz, you didn\u2019t want to be\nconsidered a number.",
        "A: Un-Until today, I can\u2019t remember my Social Security number. I don\u2019t want to. Okay? I t --",
        "Q: Are there other obvious things like that, that you see as sort of the impact of what you went\nthrough?",
        "A: Not rea -- no, not really. I mean, this 1s -- this is dumb. I -- it\u2019s almost like a dumb revolt,\nokay? Me -- I had no clue what the Social Security number is, I just -- I don\u2019t know, what do I\nneed it for? And that was it. That\u2019s when I told the lady that it\u2019s a free country, I can -- I can put\nmy numb -- my name down anyplace. So --",
        "Q: Did you feel free once you got to the U.S.?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Beca -- that -- you know, there was no -- y-you also have to remember I -- you --\nI had no -- he -- I wasn\u2019t a real teenager because I always lived with fear. Not -- not visible, but it\nwas always there. You can\u2019t do this, you can\u2019t do that. You have to be careful. So -- and then of\ncourse once you were marked, that was a whole different story, so you really couldn\u2019t. And for\nall intents and purposes I was a normal teenager. And so probably that had something -- so when\nI came here, I was free. And there were some Viennese people living across the street from my\nmother\u2019s uncle and she was just a few years -- a year or two older than me, and she took me\nunder her wing, and we -- you know, she knew people and we were just like other teenagers. We\nweren\u2019t teenagers any more at this point. She took me to Jones Beach. We went to Coney Island.\nI was an hour late in coming home and my uncle was standing on the street with his pocket\nwatch, you know. And I said to him -- and he was worried about me, and I said, don\u2019t worry, I\ncome from a big city. So I really -- I mean, once I was here, I felt a -- you know, I -- I had people\nto fall back on, and then I started -- I started to work as a trimmer in a -- in a millinery factory\nbecause I had a friend whose parents had a factory -- a hat factory in Vienna, and they were\nworking there, so they got me a job there and I worked there. And one day the boss came and he\nsaid to me to do -- to trim two hats. It was already after hour, we had to wait for her husband\nbecause he had to finish some job to go out. Anyway, he asked me to do two hats, and she helped\nme -- for to go to the post office for orders. Next thing you know, the sto -- the s -- the shops -- th\n-- not the shop steward, whoever is in charge of -- okay, came in and told me that I did this, that\nand the other, and I can\u2019t do that. And I looked at her and I said, \u201cWell why not, you know, I\nwasn\u2019t doing anything,\u201d I said. \u201cHe asked me because he wanted it to go out before the post\noffice closes.\u201d So she said to me, \u201cThat was not of your business.\u201d And from that point on, the\nunion and I don\u2019t work together. Because I co -- I -- I couldn\u2019t understand the logic of that whole\nthing. I mean, the order doesn\u2019t go out, you don\u2019t get -- don\u2019t get work, you sit there and twiddle\nyour thumbs. But that was the law.",
        "Q: How did you meet your husband? I think there\u2019s a -- a -- a charming story, right?",
        "A: Yeah. The couple -- you know, the people I\u2019m tal -- telling you about, the mother and father\nand her -- their daughter. They had a son who was married here and had family here, and I went -\n- I was going to Stuyvesant, okay, and I got lost in the crossover to take the west side train. And\nthere was a man coming down and I ask him how do I get to the west side train? And he had a\nvery heavy Irish accent, and as he is talking to me he 1s walking, and I had no clue what he was\nsaying. And Jack came along, and he addressed me in German and he said where I wanted to go.\nSo I told him where I wanted to go, so he starts telling me that his family, his grandfather -- oh,\nhis father came from a little town outside of Austria, close to the airport in Vienna. How do you\nmeet somebody from that little tow -- from that little village, okay? It got to be that man, okay? It\nhad to be the -- the brother of this woman. So -- so he want to -- a-and another thing, you have to\nremember, Americans couldn\u2019t do no wrong. Th -- and you\u2019d spoi -- and also you talked to\neverybody. I me -- because that is -- was the only way of -- there was no newspaper, there --\ncommunication. Did you -- you were there, did you ever meet somebody, so -- so he asked me if\nI wanted to go for ice cream, so I said sure. And a -- a -- continuously I\u2019m thinking that this is\nthis -- this im -- person, you know, because he was telling me about the town and the temple and\nthe this and the that. I said, ho-how would you meet any other person who comes from that little\ntow -- it\u2019s like a pin in a haystack in New York, okay? And I never gave it a thought that the guy\nwas living in Queens. But that doesn\u2019t mean anything, because he could be in Manhattan. So\nthat\u2019s how I met my husband.",
        "Q: And how long before you were married?",
        "A: December, six months.",
        "Q: That\u2019s nice.",
        "A: So, six months and 60 some odd years.",
        "Q: So, I have just a few more questions and I think we\u2019re -- we\u2019re almost done. So, I guess what\nI was trying to ask before -- I -- I -- Pll say it a slightly different way, see if something else might\ncome to mind. Just in terms of what the long term impact that you feel you can see of the war\nand the Holocaust on your -- perhaps on your decisions -- for instance, you were telling me about\nconsciously not wanting to dwell on things too much with your children. That was a conscious\ndecision --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- of yours. Are there other things, either in terms of, you know, your career, work, f --\nreligion, other family issues. Things that you feel that the Holocaust really affected you, and\naffected your decisions in those areas of your life?",
        "A: I th -- I think the only -- the only thing which affected me, I would say -- but I would have\nnever, ever changed my religion that -- although the question -- so maybe, you know, more --\nbeing more active, rather than a -- than m-more -- you know, than just saying yes, I\u2019m Jewish\nand I\u2019m going for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. But --",
        "Q: That because of what you went through you feel more connected?",
        "A: No, I felt that the children should -- not I. I had -- I had my -- I -- I was -- my Jewish\neducation so to say, or exposure. But no, for the children to know, and as I said, when they were\nold enough, they -- they learned, and that was -- always was important to me. But I didn\u2019t -- I --\nthey wa -- they -- I did not want them to -- to feel responsible for -- for what I -- what -- what ma\n-- what I went through, or what I experienced. And as I said, I did not -- De-Debbie went to\nIsrael, I remember for -- for -- after high school graduation, and there was one week where they\ndid nothing. They went -- I don\u2019t know if they went on a kibbutz or whatever, it was all\nHolocaust. And she called, and says, \u201cI\u2019m Holocausted out.\u201d So I said, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d You\nknow, tha -- it was too much, and she was already 18. So -- no, I really don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t really say\nthat -- not momentarily anyway, that -- I would have to think about it.",
        "Q: And the idea that you had to live with a certain type of fear or anxiety for so much of your\nyouth, when did you feel that you really broke free of -- of that -- of that situation?",
        "A: Th -- I -- I -- I si -- there is still a c -- a certain respect for auth-authority. I never forget I was\nhailed down by a policeman once who needed to go someplace and wanted me to drive him. And\nwhen he -- that -- I was here very short -- I mean, at -- at -- at -- was -- no, I d -- I didn't dri -- I\ndidn\u2019t drive for -- was -- didn\u2019t drive for a very long time.

        "A: Yes, yeah, right. I mean, at the moment if 1t wouldn\u2019t be for us, she wouldn\u2019t have anybody.\nBecause for some [indecipherable] whatever reason, she has a second cousin who has absolutely\nno interest or whatever, in her. And it\u2019s sad, you know?",
        "Q: How long have the two of you been friends now?",

I mean, we bo -- about sad, we don\u2019t have anything to talk\nabout. I mean, we laugh about things, okay, which happened, which come up. Sometimes they\u2019re\nrevelant to something and I will say, do you remember? You know? So it is not -- maybe there\u2019s\nsomething wrong with us.",
        "Q: Maybe that\u2019s the way you\u2019ve, you know, been strong and -- and held things together for so\nlong, you know?",
        "A: I -- I -- I don\u2019t know, I mean you can\u2019t -- you can\u2019t say it is because I was young, because\nMariani was older than I am. And then you meet people who were -- who just can\u2019t let go, for\nwhatever reason. But life goes on.",
        "Q: But when the two of you get together, you do reminisce, but often about the --",
        "A: No, no the -- I mean, you know, I me -- I mean there were times I used to call her every single\nday when she was still -- when she was not -- when she could see it, and she was alone, so I\nwould call her every single day, and talk to her, you know? And here and there we would, you\nknow, laugh about something. I mean, she will tell -- she will tell you when she bought me my\nfirst high heeled shoes and I couldn't walk in. So, you know, things like -- we had -- as I said, we\nwill say, you know, it\u2019s a miracle that ha -- all things said and done, you live a more or less\nnormal life. That\u2019s -- whatever the norm is.",

        "A: Yeah. I mean, if you don\u2019t have any -- if you\u2019re not -- 1f you don\u2019t have humor then you -- it\u2019s\n-- that is not -- you can\u2019t survive in any situation, you know? So that\u2019s it, right?",

        "A: No, just that I was very lucky that I was only in camp for 11 months, a-and maybe that is\nwhat helped me to survive, because you don\u2019t know what time would do to you. It\u2019d be much\nmore hopeless than -- than a short time.",

        "Q: And the way in which you say you don\u2019t want to dwell on the memories --",
        "A: I nev -- I never did, and I -- I don\u2019t think that I ever dwelled on a day to day basis what is\ngoing to be tomorrow. Whatever was going to be tomorrow, we face it tomorrow.",
        "Q: And have you continued that attitude toward life?",
        "A: More or less, yes, more or less. Because there is a be -- you know, to look into the future, you\nworry today and tomorrow something different. I mean, it\u2019s human nature, yes, we do worry. I\u2019m\nnot saying I\u2019m not worried about certain things and drive myself crazy over nothing. But most of\nthe time you were -- you -- you tried not to. Even if my children say I\u2019m neurotic.",

        "Q: What about your mother? How did she react?",
        "Q: And I guess that would be in your case, people who were willing to hide you.",
        "Q: So just to ge -- continue with where we were. I know we talked about a number of different\nthings and now I want to come back to the time when you were in hiding. So if you could just\nsort of summarize. When you started going into hiding -- also at that particular moment, what if\nanything do you remember about conversation -- conversations with your parents, you know,",

        "Q: Do you remember it being uncomfortable living there?",

        "Q: And so she was the owner, or she ran the laundry?",
        "Q: What do you remember of her personality, what type of person was she?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen. This is tape number two, side A. You were telling me about a story, an anecdote where\nyou and Marianne were getting a goose, I believe, for Christmas. Can you tell me again the\ndetails of the story?",
        "Q: Is this the kind of thing you were actually able to laugh about in the moment?",
        "Q: Were there other humorous anecdotes during your time 1n hiding?",
        "Q: And did you laugh at the time?",
        "Q: Why did he raise them and then --",
        "Q: When did your brother join you in hiding, cause he wasn't with you all the time before.",

        "Q: And was the woman, Mrs. or Ms. Pukas, was she involved at all in the food -- getting food for\nyou, or helping you to get food?",
        "Q: Did you ever feel hungry while you were in hiding?",
        "Q: Now, when you first left home and you first went into hiding, were there certain items that\nwere important to you that you could bring? Or did you have to leave pretty much everything at\nhome?",
        "Q: What\u2019s the age difference between you and Mariani?",
        "Q: And what did it feel like, was she a close friend, was she more like a mother substitute, or --",
        "Q: Familiar way --",
        "Q: Since you were separated from your parents, did you -- do you feel that you looked to her for\ncertain parenting sort of guidance?",
        "Q: What are some of the ways that even if it was not in the style of a sort of parental role, but\nsome of the ways that perhaps she helped take care of you during this time?",
        "Q: What about your education? You weren't going to school, so --",
        "Q: Anything you remember about your conversations?",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "Q: I think Marianne also mentioned when you\u2019 re hiding together with her, that while everybody\nduring the air raids went to the cellar, you would go to the attic. Is that what you remember?",
        "Q: So you were afraid of both the air raid and then being found?",
        "Q: So -- so now when you are in the hiding place in the -- 1n the wooden shack, I believe, that\u2019s\nbehind the laundry --",
        "Q: -- place, so what -- I just lost my train of thought -- when you were there -- do you know\napproximately how long you were in hiding there, and would you sometimes leave from there\nand come back and go to different hiding places in between?",
        "Q: And where was that?",
        "Q: So you left when you thought there was a better place to go to?",
        "Q: Cause you were worried about being caught at the laundry place?",
        "Q: And about how long in total would you say you were at the -- at this wooden shack?",
        "Q: Now, I think I heard, also from Marianne, some kind of story about the day when it was\nsupposed to be your brother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah.",
        "Q: And when was this and can you tell me the story?",
        "Q: But when did you learn about that?",
        "Q: The day of your brother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah, where were you that day when you got this news?",
        "Q: In the laundry place?",
        "Q: And -- and so he did have his Bar Mitzvah?",
        "Q: How did your brother take the news?",
        "Q: How did you take it? Was it somehow possible to be optimistic after -- after this?",
        "Q: And you were actively following the news about the war?",
        "Q: When is the last time that you spoke to or saw your parents? Excuse me.",
        "Q: So you were out on the streets often?",
        "Q: So you tried to enjoy life when you could?",
        "Q: Well, this makes me wonder was it easier to go out as a young woman?",
        "Q: Now you were aware of -- you said there\u2019s this underground sort of movement, you were\naware of many Jewish people staying there in hiding.",
        "Q: Where was -- do you remember the address or the general location of this laundry place\nwhere you hid?",
        "Q: When did you go?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want to tell them you\u2019re from there?",
        "Q: Now, I think we\u2019re getting to the point where --",
        "Q: -- you know, you have been -- where you\u2019re found out in your hiding place, but I\u2019m -- I was\njust curious in general, is there anything else you remember as far as anything you haven\u2019t\nalready shared, what would be the biggest challenges of this life that you had in hiding?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen. This is tape number two, side B. I think you wanted to say something? Did you want to --\nokay. So now I wanted to ask you, continuing where we left off, if you would tell me what\nhappened when you were discovered in the hiding place.",
        "Q: This is the place with Mrs. or Miss Pukas.",
        "Q: The -- the laundry. What happened?",
        "Q: A catheter?",
        "Q: And when was this?",
        "Q: But when?",
        "Q: I think she said it was --",
        "Q: -- June. Think it was close to that.",
        "Q: How do you think or what do you know about the way in which you were found in your\nhiding place? What -- what have you been able to understand how that happened that you were\ncaught?",
        "Q: It came as a total surprise at the time?",
        "Q: And you stayed in the jail for --",
        "Q: A month. And what were conditions like there? You were starting to explain.",
        "Q: But it was sort of relaxed conditions?",
        "Q: When is it that she stopped smoking? You\u2019re saying --",
        "Q: So you were able to bring a few items with you?",
        "Q: Now, you had about a month there --",
        "Q: -- and what were you thinking would happen next?",
        "Q: So you find it hard to believe that they didn\u2019t know that --",
        "Q: So you had no idea what was about to happen --",
        "Q: -- but then --",
        "Q: Describe the journey, how long and -- and when did you know?",
        "Q: And it was a comfortable ride?",
        "Q: But -- but you felt it was ominous?",
        "Q: You were with other Jewish prisoners?",
        "Q: So you\u2019re on this journey, it\u2019s not a very long one, but when do you first know that you\u2019re\narriving to Auschwitz? Tell me about that.",
        "Q: But he gave you breaks, he let you ta --",
        "Q: Was it very hard work? Very hard, manual labor?",
        "Q: Were you pretty strong at the time?",
        "Q: You remember little moments of human kindness.",
        "Q: You had no other sort of vegetables, or roughage, or --",
        "Q: Were you hungry a lot of the time?",
        "Q: In your mind.",

        "Q: And mostly about food, or other things, too?",
        "Q: Did you form friendships?",
        "Q: That region of -- of Germany, you mean?",
        "Q: Where is this?",
        "Q: In a -- a different camp?",
        "Q: Like a ledge --",
        "Q: Now, I want go back for a moment. Do you think you would recognize -- I have a map of\nAuschwitz -- of Birkenau, and I don\u2019t know if you would be able to point out any of the places\nwhere you remember being, or -- I know you said when you were first there, you were in a\ncertain area with Marianne. I don\u2019t know if any of this looks familiar to you.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "Q: Did you have other experiences like that, or see other --",
        "Q: Now you at first were with Marianne --",
        "Q: -- staying with her, and then what happened, you were separated?",
        "Q: And why was that, do you know?",
        "Q: When -- when you were with Marianne, or when you were still in Auschwitz but you were\nseparated from her, would you still have occasion to see her?",
        "Q: And how would you get to see one another, or --",
        "Q: And with Marianne you were able to spend time with her and -- and --",
        "Q: Do you think it was important for you to have someone like that -- her there, and --",
        "Q: She was scared to get it?",
        "Q: Was she scared to get it from you?",
        "Q: She told me some story about showering in the middle of the night, do you remember this?\nTaking cold showers in the middle of the night to stay --",

        "Q: Do you remember your number?",
        "Q: Can you tell me?",
        "Q: And would you mind telling me just this little story you mentioned when we weren\u2019t\nrecording, about describing or trying to tell young children, your children and perhaps your\ngrandchildren what this number on your arm is all about.",
        "Q: And you said there was something that came up because Marianne has a similar number.",
        "Q: Did you ha --",
        "Q: Did you have to answer those kind of que --",
        "Q: That\u2019s the same age you were when --",
        "Q: Now, when you saw Marianne\u2019s husband Otto going to this one side --",
        "Q: When -- when did you learn?",
        "Q: But -- but you knew otherwise pretty soon?",
        "Q: And is that smell one of your most dominant memories of --",
        "Q: And you think this did help you, this approach?",
        "Q: Did you ever at the time let your emotions get the better of you?",
        "Q: When did you learn what had happened to your brother?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know what had happened to him at Auschwitz?",
        "Q: And -- and what did happen to him?",
        "Q: At some point at Auschwitz you didn\u2019t see him any more, but you didn't know --",
        "Q: And how were you -- not that it\u2019s possible to console someone, but did you spend time with\nMarianne after she learned about her husband, and was it possible to --",
        "Q: The brain, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I think the brain, yes.",
        "Q: Were you very worried about being selected as well?",
        "Q: Were the living conditions, what were they like in your barracks where you were sleeping?",
        "Q: Was it very cramped and -- and --",
        "Q: Were you with other Jewish women also from Austria, or where were they from?",
        "Q: Now, tell me about how you learned about your parents? Did you learn something about their\nfate while you were in Auschwitz?",
        "Q: That\u2019s also after?",
        "Q: To Auschwitz?",
        "Q: And when did you learn about that finally?",
        "Q: So you never really knew for sure what had happened to them for many years?",
        "Q: So, there was this one person who gave you little breaks when you were working, but other\nthan that at Auschwitz, were you working very long hours? Was it very difficult work?",
        "Q: Did you ever get a day off?",
        "Q: Did you feel any connection any more to the religion you\u2019d grown up with, at that time?",
        "Q: I mean, did you pray at all while you were in au -- Auschwitz?",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t necessarily pray to God during that time?",
        "Q: Were there any -- was there any way in which you observed any of the Jewish holidays?",
        "Q: Marianne said that you know, you had be very resourceful, of course --",
        "Q: -- and even to learn to steal food. Did you see that, or --",
        "Q: Exchange?",
        "Q: Now, what was -- what was the situation with your health? Was it changing a lot while you\nwere at Auschwitz?",
        "Q: And now you\u2019re talking about --",
        "Q: And the name is?",
        "Q: So just to go back, so we\u2019re sort of finishing up when you were at Auschwitz, did you witness\nor have anything to do with any resistance activities there?",
        "Q: Do you think you saw these things and reacted emotionally, or do you think you were shutting\ndown your emotions a lot of the time?",
        "Q: Do you have any sense if most of the others around you were reacting similarly? Did you talk\nwith others about this sort of thing?",
        "Q: Do you find it at all difficult, for instance in this interview --",
        "Q: -- bringing back all the memories?",
        "Q: Do you feel hatred some of the time?",
        "Q: So, now when you leave Auschwitz, can you tell me -- you started to tell me before --",
        "Q: -- also tell me what happened at this point with Marianne. She did not go with you?",
        "Q: Was it a very nice reunion?",
        "Q: What\u2019s -- what\u2019s her name?",
        "Q: And -- and when was she with you?",
        "Q: Now when you -- so take me back to when you leave --",
        "Q: -- Auschwitz. When was this and tell me about this next journey.",
        "Q: All right, just to continue where we left off, you were telling me about tents that were put up.",
        "Q: And -- and where, exactly, is this?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen. This is tape number three, side B. Okay, continue -- you were telling me about a storm.",
        "Q: Now at Bergen-Belsen, were you telling me something about Anne Frank while you were\nthere?",
        "Q: That seems very resourceful.",
        "Q: What did you know about the war at this stage?",
        "Q: Did you remain optimistic during this time?",
        "Q: Was it only other women working at this camp?",
        "Q: How did they treat you?",
        "Q: But on a daily basis --",
        "Q: And that\u2019s considered a slave labor camp, right?",
        "Q: Do you receive reparations for having worked there? Or do you receive, you know, restitution\nmoney?",
        "Q: Now -- excuse me, I was reading -- I was reading in a survivor\u2019s memoir about Salzwedel --",
        "Q: -- and read an interesting story about the water faucets in the camp, and I was wondering if\nyou knew anything about this. She wrote that the water faucets in the camp were wired with\nbombs. Had you ever heard anything about that?",
        "Q: Was it difficult work?",
        "Q: And was it -- you said it was only women, was it also only Jewish women in this camp?",
        "Q: And what about routines like there was also appelle and roll call at this camp?",
        "Q: And now we get to the time of liberation, so tell me a little bit more. I know you -- also you\nalready mentioned people, the women, flooding the gate. But what else are your impressions?",
        "Q: Oh --",
        "Q: Rushing to the gate. What other first impressions do you have?",
        "Q: And did they stay there, or did they just walk free, and walk out?",
        "Q: Did a lot of eggs break?",
        "Q: How about you, how was your health?",
        "Q: And when you went out, that was the last time you saw that place, you just left? Or did you\ncome back?",
        "Q: Where wa -- where was this?",
        "Q: Now when was that and where did you leave from?",
        "Q: How did you find out a year later?",
        "Q: This was sort of a major health issue that kept following you around after the war.",
        "Q: Now, to go back, I mean how was your health in the immediate aftermath of being liberated?\nWere you able to rebound fairly quickly?",
        "Q: And at liberation, can you describe some part of the feeling, and also the feeling of others\naround you. Were people emotional? Did you feel emotional?",
        "Q: I read in this other survivor\u2019s memoir that in the town there were department stores, and that\nsome of the prisoners -- the women from Salzwedel, from the camp, were going into the town.",
        "Q: Did you see this, or part of --",
        "Q: Did you go as well?",
        "Q: Were you talking with the American soldiers who liberated you?",
        "Q: So they kept moving?",
        "Q: And 1s there a point where you really felt finally free? Was that still at Salzwedel, or a --\nlater?",
        "Q: When\u2019s the first time you felt a more normal life again?",
        "Q: That\u2019s in Linz?",
        "Q: Is that when you --",
        "Q: -- you were --",
        "Q: Did you still feel some anti-Semitism at that time there?",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re in Linz for awhile, and then you were telling me about -- it\u2019s the person there\nwho contacted --",
        "Q: -- the person in the U.S. --",
        "Q: -- your -- your family member. But tell me about the rest of your journey within Austria from\nLinz. Cause you went back to Vienna, is that right? When was that?",
        "Q: Did you look for family in Vienna?",
        "Q: When you visited Vienna like this, did you have any desire to return there and live there?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen. This is tape number four, side A. So you were saying about the idea of perhaps living in\nVienna again after the war?",
        "Q: I know we\u2019ve talked about your emotions throughout this period. What were your emotions\nlike when you realized your family members weren\u2019t coming back to Vienna?",
        "Q: So would you say you, unfortunately you weren't very surprised that your family members\ndidn't return to Vienna? Was that a shock for you at that time?",
        "Q: It\u2019s like you had to prepare yourself for so long that -- mentally that they wouldn\u2019t return.",
        "Q: When did it sink in for you actually, the magnitude of what had happened during the\nHolocaust?",
        "Q: Crematorium?",
        "Q: Did you think very much about death during those days?",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "Q: I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s good that you\u2019ve been very open. I really appreciate that, and -- and\nI\u2019m sure your family will, too. But I wanted to ask you, did you ever re-establish contact with the\npeople -- any of the people who hid you in Vienna?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t like the permanency of the letter?",
        "Q: And it doesn\u2019t matter what language? It\u2019s not just that -- writing in English or a second\nlanguage --",
        "Q: So -- so you did have some kind of contact, but not -- not --",
        "Q: Whose daughter?",
        "Q: And did you ever hear of, or have contact with M-Ms. Pukas, who hid you?",
        "Q: So then we get to the point where you get the news that you can go to the U.S..",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit more about the journey and arriving.",
        "Q: Do you know the name of that?",
        "Q: Do you know when you left? When you left -- you left Hamburg, right?",
        "Q: And how old were you at this time?",
        "Q: It does seem you have an adventurous spirit.",
        "Q: Oh, you already knew English?",
        "Q: Was -- was the whole journey coming to the U.S. exciting, or was there, you know --",
        "Q: And tell me, how was, just in general, broadly speaking, how was the adjustment living here\nas anew immigrant, learning more of the language, going to school --",
        "Q: Well --",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s very interesting. I mean, you -- obviously, and that\u2019s something I wanted to ask you,\nyou know, how do you feel that the war time and the Holocaust affected you in the future. I\nmean, there can be countless ways, but are there some things that you could point to?",
        "Q: Well, there are things that you\u2019re obviously aware of. For instance, that story to me says that -",
        "Q: -- because of your -- no, because of your experience at Auschwitz, you didn\u2019t want to be\nconsidered a number.",
        "Q: Are there other obvious things like that, that you see as sort of the impact of what you went\nthrough?",
        "Q: Did you feel free once you got to the U.S.?",
        "Q: How did you meet your husband? I think there\u2019s a -- a -- a charming story, right?",
        "Q: And how long before you were married?",
        "Q: That\u2019s nice.",
        "Q: So, I have just a few more questions and I think we\u2019re -- we\u2019re almost done. So, I guess what\nI was trying to ask before -- I -- I -- Pll say it a slightly different way, see if something else might\ncome to mind. Just in terms of what the long term impact that you feel you can see of the war\nand the Holocaust on your -- perhaps on your decisions -- for instance, you were telling me about\nconsciously not wanting to dwell on things too much with your children. That was a conscious\ndecision --",
        "Q: -- of yours. Are there other things, either in terms of, you know, your career, work, f --\nreligion, other family issues. Things that you feel that the Holocaust really affected you, and\naffected your decisions in those areas of your life?",
        "Q: That because of what you went through you feel more connected?",
        "Q: And the idea that you had to live with a certain type of fear or anxiety for so much of your\nyouth, when did you feel that you really broke free of -- of that -- of that situation?",
        "Q: And I believe your husband was not a survivor, he was born in the U.S.?",
        "Q: And if you would just tell me, just briefly about your friendship with Marianne? It has\ncontinued in this country, right?",
        "Q: How long have the two of you been friends now?",
        "Q: And when you spend time with her, do you -- the two of you reminisce about this time?",
        "Q: Maybe that\u2019s the way you\u2019ve, you know, been strong and -- and held things together for so\nlong, you know?",
        "Q: But when the two of you get together, you do reminisce, but often about the --",
        "Q: With a healthy does of humor, it sounds like.",
        "Q: I think that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all my questions. Do you have anything else you\u2019d like to share?",
        "Q: So I guess you would perhaps take the attitude that even though you got caught while you\nwere in hiding, you were fortunate to stay in hiding as long as you did?",
        "Q: I think I have one more question for you. This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum interview with Ann Green. This is tape number four, side B. Just wanted to\nask you if you ever have any dreams, or nightmares related to this time?",
        "Q: And what about during any of those years? During the war time and Auschwitz, and --",
        "Q: And the way in which you say you don\u2019t want to dwell on the memories --",
        "Q: And have you continued that attitude toward life?",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you for -- for agreeing to be interviewed. Very much appreciate that.\nAnd now this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann\nGreen."

I\nca -- really, it\u2019s very interesting that I cannot really remember, because I was very young. Was a\nnormal child, not interested in anything but myself. And -- so it\u2019s very difficult to say. I can\u2019t\nreally remember, you know, that it wa -- that something really would have impressed me, or\ninterest me.

It was just a normal apartment and a normal -- what you\nwould call an American -- equal in to an American life. Not -- not -- I -- I really don\u2019t know how\nto describe it to you. Just a very normal life, which abruptly ended, and we got notice that we\nwere going to be relocated, that\u2019s what the -- would be call -- and we knew when, and we were lo\n-- no, we were relocated in -- we -- into an apartment and we stayed there with another family\nand their daughter. It was really a storefront, an apart -- and a -- and a room, and a kitchen. And\nmy mother, father, my brother and I lived in the storefront, and this other couple, who were very\nelderly and their daughter lived in the back. And this is how we started our new life, so to say,\nuntil we got notice that we\u2019re going to be relocated, and at that point we all left. And my father\nhappened to have a friend who was not Jewish, and who was an illegal member of the party, and\nhe send him a postcard, and he said, if you need me, call me, I\u2019m there.

I mean, when you think about it\nnow, the situations were such, as I\u2019m recounting them I can\u2019t really believe it, because I\u2019m\ntelling it to you and I say, if people will listen to this, what will they think? So -- and then of\ncourse, when we got notice to leave, you know, that we were being picked up, or rounded up, or\nS -- we -- we left. And at one point we stayed, we -- we moved right in next door with Mariani\nand her husband, and when they came for us we could hear them through the wall, because they -\n- they came in and, you know, they were looking for us. And my brother had parakeets, h -- in\nthe storefront window. And those birds -- you know, they came in and they made a lot of noise,\nof course, and those parakeets started to screech, and whatever.

So -- it was an adjacent apartment, so --\nand then of course we had to leave because people in the building wouldn\u2019t -- knew us, and\npeople in the neighborhood knew us, so we really had to vacate and find another place to stay.\nAnd then we just started traveling from place to place, whoever would take us, we would stay\nwith, you know, whatever length of time we could. Because you had to be very careful, because\nif you stayed -- the law over there wa -- was or is that when you are -- I think it was a week, you\nhad to go to police, and report that you are living there.

I would\nget undressed under the cover, and then in the morning I would take all my clothes, put them\nunder the cover, warm them up and get dressed again. It was terribly cold there beca -- why?\nBecause they didn\u2019t heat their upstairs. And the -- and the interesting part was her father lived\nupstairs too.",
        "A: I think 14. I wa -- the anschluss was 13, I was 13.",
        "A: I mean it was -- it was a [indecipherable] -- how long -- yeah.",
        "A: 1938 I was 13.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, we went to Sunday school, went to Hebrew school. At one point I could really read, and\nI could write. In Europe, if you were Jewish, they didn't let you forget it. So you were\nConservative, because at that point there was no Reform. And that is it, you know, that\u2019s the\nextent of it.",
        "A: All of them, because we always got new clothes. That was a -- almost like a ritual. Not that\nwe didn\u2019t have anything to wear before, but -- but the holidays we wer -- we always got new\nclothes. And it took me awhile here not to buy anything new for the holidays.",
        "A: Yes, we had Seders which lasted forever. And I remember my grandmother being alive, and\nmy brother was little -- he was little and she wouldn\u2019t let him be fed in -- in the house because it\nwas Passover, Mother had to go to the neighbor to feed him. That ar -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s so weird how\nyou remember things. And so, remember changing the dishes and cleaning up and whatever. And\n-- which when -- you know, was -- is a pleasant memory, which the children really today don\u2019t\nhave, only if you\u2019re really Conservative, or Orthodox.",
        "A: No, no, no. We were what they would call assimilated Jews, you know [indecipherable] that -\n- that probably, I mean I don\u2019t know it was a problem or not. But European Jews as a -- as a rule,\nwere assimilated. He -- it -- it\u2019s only the population which made you understand that you are\nJewish.",
        "A: But they do the same thing here.",
        "A: Not -- how shall I say? After the anschluss is -- there was a teacher, she was really anti-\nSemitic and she would -- I can\u2019t really reme -- I remember she made a remark about the Jews in\nclass, that I remember. But I ca -- I wouldn\u2019t be able to remem -- remi -- remember what it was.\nAnd no, anti-Semitism in -- in Europe was -- how shall I say? Like here. It was there, you knew\nit. If you really would ha -- if you wanted to be killed, you would tell them that Jesus is a Jew. I\nmean, that was the worst thing you could have ever done, and nobody would ever do that, okay?\nBut you were always aware that you were Jewish, but for some reason, tha -- my attitude and my\nfamily\u2019s attitude was, they\u2019re ignorant people, and I\u2019m abo -- we are above it. And that\u2019s how\nyou survived. I mean, it wasn\u2019t as -- it -- anti-Semitism in Europe I think was more -- more open\nthan here. But whenever the church becomes powerful, then -- then it does not lead to good.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we had non-Jewish friends, I had non-Jewish friends. My father most certainly\nhad non-Jewish friends. And they would say, you\u2019d -- you -- you are not like the -- like other\nJews, you\u2019re a different Jew. I mean, that shows you their ignorance. And of course we did not |\n-- we didn\u2019t look Jewish. My mother had red hair, blue eyes, I had blue eyes. So, you know, we\nweren't -- we weren\u2019t looked upon as -- as the -- the typical portrait Jew. But most -- I mean,\nmost European Jews didn\u2019t look what they were supposed to look, or what they wanted them to\nlook. So that\u2019s really it.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: I do -- I di -- I think the whole thing is overshadowed by the -- by the rest of the -- my life.\nSo, you know, I went to school. I know that I would ep -- bring matzo to school. And I would go\nto school on Saturday and not write, okay. But otherwise, school was school, okay.",
        "A: No, no. Holidays, just like -- you know. Loved to go to si -- I loved to go because it was\nConservative and you had to be upstairs. And for the holidays, as a kid, you could\n[indecipherable] downstairs and of course when there was [indecipherable] you were outside,\nand you went out to play. And you know, it was really -- it is -- was the same type of life as a mi\n-- as a middle class family you lived here. I mean, there was really not that much difference. So\nit\u2019s very, you know, it\u2019s very -- it -- it\u2019s a very long time. So you really don\u2019t remember, or\nmaybe you choose not to, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Way -- there was no school.",
        "A: I think in -- well, there was no school from \u201941 on, because we went in -- you know, there was\nno school from 1941 on. So I basically had very little education. As I told my son once, I went to\nthe university of life. So that\u2019s that.",
        "A: You know, there was so -- there was so many other things going that going to school never\nreally -- I don\u2019t think it ent -- I can\u2019t say it never, but I don\u2019t think it ever entered my mind,\nbecause the -- you know, to survive was the most important thing.",
        "A: Right. Yeah, no the -- that you realized, I mean, you know, that you real -- you realized it and\nI didn\u2019t because at -- we were, you know, at that time we were still able to move around the city,\nthough we wore the emblem.",
        "A: Well, my mother was pulled out to go clean the streets, scrub the streets, I was with her. My\nfather had to go shovel snow, and at random th -- I think we started to wear the star in \u201939, and of\ncourse when we were hiding we had to take it off. And we -- you know, you mov -- at that time\nyou were still able to move around with your star, you know, able to cre -- come and go. Once\nyou took it off you just had to be careful not to meet anybody who knew you, and maybe would\nalert them that you\u2019re still around.",
        "A: No, no, because we moved out of the district, and it was real sheer chance that you don\u2019t meet\nsomebody. You had to be very careful, and you had to be very alert, and it was a -- a very, very\ndifficult, very -- very hard to relate, because basically, living here -- I mean being an American,\nor in any country, if you haven\u2019t experienced it, it\u2019s really not something one can understand. As\nI always say, if I say my shoe hurts, until yours hurts, you don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t really -- you\nknow, you say, oh yes. But it\u2019s very, very difficult because it was just a -- a -- something you\ncan\u2019t comprehend. And you just do the best you can.",
        "A: Well, fear is -- was the thing which was always with you, or maybe caution. I don\u2019t know if\nyou understand fear. Fear is only when you are exposed to it, you know, when you face it. But\nbeing -- you were always conscious and you always knew and you -- of course you were afraid\nthat you are being found out. So you don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t live with f -- I don\u2019t think\nyou live with fear, you live with the -- with the thought of hoping that it will -- 1t will be over\nsoon.",
        "A: Well, the stores were da -- you know, defaced, and they wrote Jew on it, and the stores were\nbeing taken over by people tha -- you know, the party gave the stores to -- to everybody whom\nthey thought was worthwhile being in the party, or whatever. And it -- it was just something you\ncan\u2019t -- y-you can\u2019t really retell because that\u2019s [indecipherable] store things happen, and you\ntook them -- that\u2019s the way it was, okay you -- as long as you were -- the drive to survive was to\nbe invisible. And th-that\u2019s all you really could do to survive, especially when you were hiding. I\nmean, if you walked around with the star, if somebody didn't like your face, they could do\nanything to you, whatever they wanted to, you were only a Jew. So you were expandable.",
        "A: Just hearing about it, because you weren't present. But I remember as the story goes, my\nmother came from Grodz, which is [indecipherable]. And they took the rabbi there, and they had\nhim -- they held him over the -- the river which goes through town, with a [indecipherable] you\nknow, 0-on the bridge, they held him there, just to scare him, they didn\u2019t throw him over. I mean,\nyou ni -- you\u2019re not -- you -- you\u2019re seeing something, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re hearing something which\nis really not -- which one can\u2019t comprehend, because they weren't human. It\u2019s like today, we\nhaven\u2019t learned. We really haven\u2019t learned. So --",
        "A: Not really, no. Because I -- when I was a teenager, sometimes I did things you wouldn\u2019t\nbelieve.",
        "A: Like what? I had -- I had a boyfriend who was -- who did not need to wear the star. I didn\u2019t\nwear it, I was already in hiding. We\u2019d go to the city, we\u2019d go like teenagers here, okay? At that\npoint I was 18 -- 17 -- 18. We\u2019d go to a -- we\u2019d go to a restaurant, we go -- you know. One day I\nwent to buy a birthday present for my mother, and I left in the morning and I came back in the\nlate afternoon. And I remember like today, at that time they had umbrellas, and they had a cu --\nthey were regular umbrellas like the little ones now, they had a [indecipherable] and a -- was a\nlea -- it was all of leather. When I came in my father took it and ch-chased me. Because, I mean,\nthink. There was no phone, there was no way, but you know, you\u2019re a teenager. What -- what is -\n- what is the problem, you know? You\u2019re having a good time.",
        "A: I think youth is. I -- I always said when I had children, I hope -- I have to remember what I\ndid when I was a child or a teenager, and that will help me survive. I\u2019m a survivor by nature.",
        "A: Well, I was a teenager. I was not -- I don\u2019t think I was any different than teenagers today. But\n-- and you -- you don\u2019t think what the consequences. I mean, if they would have caught me, they\nwould have caught my parents. I mean, a whole family, and an extended family would have\ngone. Never gave it a thought.",
        "A: Like what?",
        "A: [indecipherable] you -- you lived day by day. You -- you couldn\u2019t plan, because you don\u2019t --\nyou didn\u2019t know what is going to happen. At one point, when I stayed with Mariani, I had to\nleave during the day so I got a place to stay at during the day, I became the maid. And her hus --\nand they were very nice people, but her husband apparently wasn\u2019t too bright. One day he called\nand he said, this is the gover -- some government calling, and they know that he is -- he\u2019s hiding\nsomebody and they\u2019re going to come over and get me. Well, I cleared out of there so fast I must\nhave -- I must have run I don\u2019t know how many miles, just -- and that was in the inner city, and I\n-- we lived in the outskirts. And I never gi -- went back there. He thought it was a great joke,\nokay?",
        "A: Yeah, he was kidding. You know, he was -- he wanted to know if it -- and at th -- and th --\nyou couldn\u2019t walk a -- you had to be very careful. I couldn\u2019t use the vacuum cleaner because\neverybody knew they went to work in the morning, so there was nobody supposed to be in their\nhouse. So -- I mean, 1 -- totally stupid. You know, not -- thoughtless, and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "A: It just dissipated, it dissipated, you know, and that was it. That I understand. So -- and then he\n-- my father knew a lot of -- lot of people and he would a -- he was able to -- you know, there\nwas a lot of selling and buying, and -- and he knew a lot of -- he had a lot of non-Jewish friends,\nand that\u2019s what he did. You know, as mu -- as -- as well as he could. And that\u2019s how we\nsurvived, I suppose, to a certain degree.",
        "A: Yeah, they burned it down. They burned it down.",
        "A: No, no, no. The only temple which stayed in 1s -- was not destroyed, I think, was the -- I can\u2019t\nremember the name now, it just escaped me. The main synagogue in Vienna, in the first district,\nyou know? I think -- no, 1t wasn't central, central is here.",
        "A: Yeah, we would hear, and of course we also listened to the voice of America. And you know,\nthe grapevine, it -- 1t -- and the circles my father traveled in, there was always news, but you\nknow, you really -- it -- everything went so fast, and everything was so new, that people really\ndid not -- I mean, did not comprehend. I mean, we had people aba -- when we still lived in the\nstorefront, people would come to our house, they put coffee, for after dinner co -- after dinner --\nthe main meal in Europe was lunch. And they would come and have coffee and debate and talk\nand th -- you know, for naught. And, you know, so we are -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s something really you --\nyou -- you rethink, and you re -- even today when I think, or when I\u2019m talking to Mariani, the\ninteresting part about it is that we were able to lead a normal life, to the norm of norm. But -- so\nyou can\u2019t real -- you know, when I look back, it\u2019s -- you ju -- 1t just became -- you -- this 1s what\nyou were confronted with, and that\u2019s what you had to make the best of it.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, you tr -- you know, you had to, because otherwise you couldn\u2019t survive. You cou\n-- you know, you would -- you would just waste your -- your energy and strength, which I\nsuppose you subconsciously realized that you shouldn\u2019t do. Oh, I\u2019m so far away from you, I\u2019m\nSOITY.",
        "A: We --",
        "A: We knew that there was Theresienstadt, and -- but we really didn\u2019t know what it -- what it\nwas. My parents were deported. My parents were caught. How, when and where, I don\u2019t know,\nbut this friend I had who was Romanian, he did not have to wear a star, so he had more entry into\nplaces, and he found out that they were deported. He was supposed to meet my father, and\napparently didn\u2019t, because they caught them, and they went to Theresienstadt, and at one point\nyou could send food to Theresienstadt. If they got it, we never knew. But we could go to\ndifferent -- different districts, and mail whatever we could spare or get together, and mail it to\nthem. And then, of course, they stopped that. So I don\u2019t know if they ever received it or not.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah, but my father -- my father felt this not going to -- this is not going to last, I mean,\npeople would -- they -- because he had so many non-Jewish friends, he -- he never really\nunderstood either that it could last this long, or anybody could even contemplate anything like\nthat. So --",
        "A: Probably. Probably. I mean, my father felt, you know, why emigrate. And probably, when I\nthink about it now, he was in his early 50\u2019s, he had two young children, and a wife, and I --\nprobably was afraid, which is very possible. And as I said, really not understanding the -- the\npower. So, he -- we were going to -- I think 1t was Nicorag -- one of those South American\ncountries, and -- but it never materialized. It was always on the edge, you know, we were going\nto go in two weeks, okay? And then it dissipated. So we never really -- as I said, he -- it was not -\n- he -- he just didn\u2019t have his heart to go.",
        "A: You know, European wives are more -- we are going back 60 years, 70 years, so it\u2019s, you\nknow, whatever he felt. And Is -- I suppose she wasn\u2019t as keen to -- to relocate either. You\nknow, you heard -- and then, of course, it stopped, you know. America closed down, and -- I\nmean, th -- a lot of my -- my brother -- my father\u2019s brother went to Poland, okay, the one in\nHungary, who lived in Hungary, they lived under false papers. They had Christian papers, and\nthey came here, they were brought here by a priest. So, you know, not everybody -- the majority\nwas bad, but there were some very good people in between. So, you know, so people sa - peoples\nthe -- the people survived, only could survive in account of people who helped them.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, and they -- I mean, they -- they put their -- they -- they didn't all do it for\nlove. A lot of it was money, okay, but they really put themselves in danger at that -- if you were\nfound, you know, if your -- if they found you, or if somebody denounced you, so it\u2019s -- it was a\nvery -- it was very, very interesting. Like, if somebody today would come to you and say, can\nyou hide me? So, you -- you know, it\u2019s -- those people really put their own life at stake. So --\nright?\nthat you would see them frequently or try to, cause I know at this time you\u2019re separating from\nyour parents.",
        "A: Right. We went into hiding I think the end of \u201941, beginning of \u201942, and I would see my\nparents, I would come to see them, they would come to see me. Would bring food which they\npurchased on the black market. And we lived in different places, and we switched places, and\nreally I -- I traveled a lot, I traveled into -- I was at many different places because I was young,\nand you know, people could not keep me for any length of time. Certain places I could go out,\nother places I could never leave. There was a place in the inner city, in the old city where I\nstayed, and I was not be -- I wasn\u2019t able to go out, and it was -- it was a big -- very, very big\napartment with all very old antique furniture, and it was very scary to be there, especially when\nyou were alone and they always said, if somebody ever comes in here, I\u2019d be hiding behind one\nof those big dining room table legs. You -- you think of the dumbest things. And --",
        "A: No. Yeah, one. I had one very [indecipherable] and with another ca -- in a Jewish house. But\nthey were -- they did not have to wear a star at the time, and for whatever reason somebody came\ninto their apartment, some official, and I was in the bathroom, and I -- in the bathtub, and I\ngrabbed my robe, and I ran. I ran up the block, and I knew a doctor there, so I went there, and --\nand that was it. I mean ga -- you know, you -- you go -- get into situations where you don\u2019t think,\nyou just -- especially when you\u2019re -- you know, you\u2019re running. And you just take off and you\ndon\u2019t think. I mean, here I was running, if somebody would say, look, what she\u2019s doing here?\nSomebody could have picked up on it, and -- and that was it, it was -- the ma -- it\u2019s really -- the\nwhole thing was more luck than anything else. Whatever was supposed to be, that\u2019s the way it\nwas. But --",
        "A: Well, yes -- no, it wa -- it was serious, it was not -- 1t was not a game. I mean, this much I\nunderstood. But at the -- at the point of danger, I w -- I wa -- suppose I was not old enough, or\ndidn\u2019t comprehend that the f -- that fear drove you to move, drove you to run, and that\u2019s what I\ndid.",
        "A: At least 10 or 12. I -- you know, at least. Because certain places I stayed for awhile, other\nplaces it wasn't convenient to stay. And you know, people were frightened, and so I moved from\nplace to place. And somebody -- you know, there was an underground communication, you\nknow, somebody would say -- well, I know somebody who would -- you could stay with,\nbecause the people who did it knew somebody else, you know, their fre -- in their circle, so -- but\nit was very difficult. It was not easy. And sometimes when I went -- I think I was the one who\nmoved the most. And -- being a girl, and being 17 - 18, so I was the -- really the one who moved\nthe most. Sometimes I would stay with my parents. They were -- I mean, luckily enough, they\nwere always together. And then somebody would find a place where I would go and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Yeah, they were -- yeah, most of them were -- were -- got -- got money, most of them -- my\nmother always brought food. And -- but money wa -- there were a few where it was money, but\nmost of them did not. It was strictly doing it for the -- for the good of the people or whatever, or\ntheir conscience, or they -- or you know, you can\u2019t -- you don\u2019t know. It was -- it was a\ntremendous undertaking for them.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, they were all non-Jewish.",
        "A: Always very, ver -- I mean, you were always taken into the family, or most of the time taken\ninto the family. I -- I mean the longest I stayed [indecipherable] the longest [indecipherable] was\nI stayed with my father\u2019s friend, and I was -- I was just part of the family and that\u2019s it. But really,\nthe chances they took were im -- um -- you know, they had -- they had family whom I never\nknew if they knew or if they didn\u2019t know. I mean, you had to be pretty dense not to, you know,\nbut nobody ever said anything or did anything, you know, so -- I mean, eventually I had to leave,\nand then of course, I went th -- stayed with Mariani, and then we were caught.",
        "A: Her -- her name was Mariani -- Mariani Fierstein, okay, Brauer, and her husband\u2019s name was\nOtto Brauer. And I think it was -- I -- I was there for about a year, maybe less. That was a -- we\nstayed in th -- the place was a laundry and it wasn't the ha -- the house was a shack. It was a\nwooden shack, it had -- it had three bedrooms, and three -- one, two, three or four -- four so\ncalled bedrooms, okay, and a living room which was also a workplace where the ironing was\ndone, and the kitchen. And it had no cellar or anything, it was undergr -- it was a wooden shack.\nIt was just totally incredible when you think abou -- I mean, I\u2019m laughing now, but it -- to\ndescribe it 1s -- like a lean-to. And th-there was a hand laundry, you know, they had kettles there,\nand they boiled the laundry and they scrubbed the laundry, we did too. Just because we had\nnothing else to do. And we learned to iron on a flat board instead of an ironing board. I became a\ncur -- I could iron men\u2019s shirts perfect. And we ironed with an iron with a hot st -- stone in there,\nand it had no back. And of course you did other people\u2019s laundry, so we had to be careful that\nstone shouldn\u2019t slip out from the thing. And then we were -- we lived there, and we all -- we --\nthe facility was an outhouse and there was another -- there was another man there, hi -- there was\nsomething -- he was mentally ill. And he lived in a little -- also in this lean-to. And his thing was,\nhe was waiting -- he liked Mariani\u2019s bath water. He used to call it -- Mariani came there in the\nsummertime, when they moved in it was summertime. And he -- we would have four foot of\nsnow on the ground, and he would call her the summer lady. And we would give him the food\nwhich was left over, but he never ate that, he had it in cans, and he waited until it became moldy\nand then he ate it. I mean, the man was sick. Sometimes I wonder if he knew what was going on.\nI don\u2019t know.",
        "A: He was living in another little lean-to, and no heat, next to the -- next to the outhouse. It\u2019s\nincredible, isn\u2019t it?",

And they needed to vacate their\napartment because they were going to be relocated, so to say. And they came -- they -- so they\nbrought them to us. And as I said, they stayed in the kitchen in a -- up in a -- in a bunk bed. And\nas I said before, when the chimney sweep came, the super came, and said, you have to get up\nbecause he\u2019s coming to sweep.",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was long before, yes. That was before we even moved.",

        "A: She was not too bright, but a nice person and we have another incident where she -- there are\ncertain things she had to have, among them was a ti -- a goose for Christmas, and I think Mariani\ntold you about that, that we went, we finally got the goose, and you shou -- it was a tapestry bag\nwe put it in, and suddenly a door --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape two, Side A",
        "A: Well we picked up the goose, and it -- carried it in a -- a tapestry bag and apparently a dog\npicked up the scent and followed us until we got to the trolley. And got into the trolley, nobody\nnoticed that the dog is following us. I got home, I had a navy coat on -- I wore, and I had a navy\nsweater, and when I undressed, I was navy.

        "A: Yeah. After -- after it was all over, we laughed about it. I mean, we did not -- you know, wa --\nwe -- for some reason we had either durability or the -- I -- I -- I really don\u2019t know what it wa --\nthe drive to survive that we could make light of it. We -- we didn\u2019t dwell on it. We want --\nthough we were victims, we weren\u2019t the victims in our mind. And you know, we had th -- we had\nno -- it wasn\u2019t in our power to -- to survive, to -- to -- so we -- we did the best we could, and not\nto let us -- not to sink to their level.",
        "A: As I said, this man who was really mentally ill, used to love Mariani\u2019s bath water, and he\nbrushed his teeth with it. Apparently he liked the soap she used or whatever, because at -- what\nwe used as a -- to -- to bathe was one of those tin tubs from many, many years ago, even before\nmy time. And he would pass by and he\u2019d say, did she take her bath? Did she take her bath? You\nknow, this was in summertime, we used to be outside and he\u2019d say, did she take her bath? And\nthe minute she was -- she was ready to s -- throw the water out, here he was with his can wash --\nwaiting to wa -- to rinse his mouth. It was disgusting. I mean --",
        "A: Yeah, we laugh, of course. I mean, that was our entertainment, 1f you know what I mean. We\n-- We -- we -- we created our own entertainment. So my br -- my brother used to raise rabbits for\nfood, and he worked -- there was a shoemaker next door and he would work there, and they\nwould give him oats, and -- like oatmeal, and he would feed it to the rabbits. And then he -- but\nhe never -- he would never eat them, and he would take them to a neighbor and she would kill\nthem and skinned them and whatever else. But he would ta -- his portion he would feed to the\ncat, and the woman was incensed that he used to do that. But that was it.",
        "A: For foo -- he -- well he -- we ate them. We -- you know, domesticated rabbit tastes like\nchicken. He would -- that was our supplement of meat, but he would not eat them because he\nwas -- he was -- he fed them, he bred them, so he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t eat them.",
        "A: No, I -- I was away. He was always -- he was always with Marianne. So I came.",
        "A: Well, there was -- there was a lesbian [indecipherable] they were gard -- they -- professional\ngardeners, and they had greenhouses, and they would bring us vegetables, lettuce, and things like\nthat. And the food was bought in the black market. That was always avail -- you know, that was\navailable.",

        "A: Well, I pres -- I suppose, you know, whatever was being ab -- whatever was being purchased\nin the black market, whoever could bring it, and whoever could locate it. Because the\n[indecipherable] on -- you know, everybody else was on food stamps. So you purchased food\nstamps and then you could buy food, or you had people who grew food, and we had chickens\nalso, and they laid eggs. And ma -- Mariani became the farmer\u2019s wife, and she would go out and\nlook for the eggs, I mean, so when you think about it, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- as sad at it -- as it 1s, it\u2019s\nalmost -- you can\u2019t really comprehend it, it\u2019s just not something -- you look back and you say, I\nreally did that? And this was luxury yet.",
        "A: No, no. No, it was -- it -- it -- I well -- how shall I say? When I was with my father\u2019s friend I\nlived a very civilized life, and I mean it was civilized with Mariani too, and with -- with almost\neverybody else, I mean, I -- I moved around, I lived in many places, and it is interesting, some of\nthe people must have known. I lived in a place where she -- the woman owned a restaurant, a\nhotel and a coffee house, and the wine growers would come, you know, to f -- to si -- 1s -- and\nshe would entertain them. At 11 o\u2019clock at night she would go to bed and she would leave me\nthere with all those people until they were all ready to go home. And she had a -- she had a -- an\n-- she had a maid and she must have known, I mean, 1-it was just almost like impossible not to,\nbecause there I didn't go out, I stayed in -- in the apartment all the time, so -- I mean, I was in\nsituations where you -- looking back now I said, you know, I ca -- I can\u2019t comprehend them. So -\n- so to relate them, and make people say, that is not that\u2019s -- you know, it -- it doesn\u2019t make\nsense.",
        "A: Yeah, cl -- clothing. I brought -- you know, you brought as much clothing as you could carry.\nYou couldn't -- you couldn\u2019t carry a lot because you\u2019re moving in someplace, you -- you know,\nyour space was very limited. But you know, there are a few things you took and you also have to\nremember I was hiding from the beginning of \u201942 until \u00b044. There was winter, summer, so you\nreally had -- that was an additional thing you had to fend for. S-So as long -- you know, as long\nas my parents were around, they were -- they -- they took care, but thereafter it was really\nMariani and her husband.",

        "A: On a familiar basis. You\u2019re more -- I mean, I always would call her Mrs. Mariani, if -- you\nknow, all those years. And only when I -- when she came here, she became Mariani. You know,\nas -- as we got older -- I mean to her I\u2019m chil -- to her I\u2019m still the child, okay, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s very\nfunny now, but that\u2019s the way it is. So no, she was -- sh-she always -- there was always a certain\namount of respect, and that was it.",
        "A: No, I was re -- I was self sufficient, self reli -- not sufficient, self reliant, I didn't -- no I didn't,\nreally not. I mean, she told me when to get on and off, but otherwise -- I mean, we ha -- I -- it\u2019s\nvery difficult, I mean she -- she did not a-assume a parental type of a -- it wasn\u2019t that type of a\nrelationship. It was more like, you know, we all lived together. I mean, we slept together, you\ncan\u2019t get much closer. But there was still as -- a certain respect.",
        "A: Well, y -- you know, if I ne -- if I needed to -- I would ask her for anything, for -- there was\nreally no -- no -- for advice or anything, I mean, we just lived day by day. There was no -- you\nknow, there was nothing that you would say, what shall I do, or how shall I do. That never came\ninto question because there was no -- there was no way or no reason for anything like that.",
        "A: No, we -- I -- I -- no, we would -- she [indecipherable] her husband would -- we would do\nmath and we would read. And I was an insa -- I was an voracious reader, and we listened to the\nradio, and music, and talk, mostly talk.",
        "A: No, no, no. I mean, most of it was really political. I mean, we would listen to the -- to news,\nwe would listen to the Voice of America, you know, and they\u2019re bombing here, they\u2019re bombing\nthere and they are retreating because it is advantageous for the Germans, but we are winning.\nAnd, so it was really mostly we were waiting. We -- we would see the planes coming in and we\nwere delighted, you know. Bela -- it\u2019s because it was m -- really in an outer district. We see the -\n- wa -- American or British planes flying over, dropping bombs, and we were delighted. I mean,\nwhen I lived in the city 1t wasn\u2019t this much fun because everybody went into the basement where\nyou were -- I was alone in a big apartment house, and that was not fun.",
        "A: That was when I was hiding, you know, when one of the places, when the air raid sirens\ncame, everybody had to vacate their apartment and at one time I was hiding in the closet because\nthey were going from apartment to apartment to see if all the apartments are empty. And of\ncourse you never knew if you\u2019re -- this building is going to be bombed, th -- at that point you\nwere scared, but there was nothing you could do. You could just wait it out and hope for the best.",
        "A: No, th-that probably was when we were at this [indecipherable] house. No, I don\u2019t remember\nthat, because most -- as I said, that\u2019s the only time we had an attic. Otherwise, there was no attic.\nThat -- that -- the worst was the apartment buildings because here the apart -- the house was\ntotally still, there was nobody there, and that was it.",
        "A: [indecipherable] right. I mean we -- I mean, we knew what bombs can do, or maybe have\nseen destruction, and it was just the eeriest feeling to be in a -- in a building, the only person in a\nbuilding, so to say.

        "A: Right.",

        "A: Maybe a year in total. Yeah, maybe a year in total, may -- a year and a half, I really ti -- I\nhave no concept of time. Course it\u2019s 60 -- over 60 years, and I don\u2019t dwell on it. If you were a\nperson who dwells on it, it\u2019s a totally different story.

And we were waiting, you know, for\nmy parents to come and this friend of mine came and he said they were caught. And I cannot\nremember any more how -- somebody denounced them. Tha -- yes, somebody denounced them.\nSo -- and he came and he told us, and he was able -- he went to visit them in the jail when they\nwere in jail, and my parents told their interrogator that we went over the border to Hungary, so\nthey shouldn\u2019t be looking for us because they caught the parents, so they knew the children was\nthere, but my parents told them that we went -- we were sent to Hungary, and that\u2019s -- that was\nthat. And then they were transported to Theresienstadt.",

        "A: Well, he was 13. He was not very -- he was not very vocal. You know, he was a 13 year old\nboy who lived under very vicarious circumstances or conditions and so -- and as I said, he wasn\u2019t\nvery -- he -- he was not very vocal.",

        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. In fact, when we were caught, we were interrogated by the Gestapo, and so\nhe said, and you listened to the Voice of America, and the radio we had, we couldn\u2019t really listen\nto it, but we had a neighbor there, she was Jewish, he wasn\u2019t, and there was a -- the owner of the\nbuilding, her husband was Jewish, she wasn\u2019t, and she had two adult children, one -- one was a\nphysician and one was -- I don\u2019t know what she was. But they were -- they knew we were there,\nand they would listen or they would call Mariani and say -- and her husband, say to come and\nlisten to the Voice of America. So when this Gest -- when I was interrogated, he said to me,\n\u2018And I understand you listened to the Voice of America.\u201d And I said to him, \u201dNo,\u201d I said, \u201cwe\ncould never, ever listen with the radio we have,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you put your finger,\u201d I said -- there\nwas an opening in the back and, \u201cif you put your finger there, the voice would get -- the music\nwould get strong,\u201d I said, \u201cand if you took it away, it died.\u201d So he looked at me and he said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019re this stupid, or if you\u2019re playing.\u201d And I looked at him and I said, \u201cNo,\nthat\u2019s the way it was.\u201d And I was in there first, and then when Mariani came, I handed her my\ncoat, and I sa -- didn\u2019t say anything, you know, and that was it. But it would -- and then -- I mean\n-- [\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- how shall I say? We were able to laugh about it, you know? I mean, it was scary\nat the moment, but I co -- I couldn\u2019t really think of anything else, I mean, he accuses us of\nlistening, which was a very normal thing, I mean, he di -- he might not even have known, you n -\n- but with that radio, you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t if you would have wanted to. So --",
        "A: Bless you. Is -- probably a week before they were caught. You know, there was no telephone\n-- there was really only when my mother could come or I could go.

I mean, if you\nwould -- if you would be black, or you would be oriental, it\u2019s fine. But here we were. I had blue\neyes, she had blonde hair, blue eyes, very statuesque type of a per -- you know, appearance.\nNobody looked at us, we hoped. We had no papers. We just, you know, we just walked.",

        "A: We -- we tried to make the best what we had, you know, that\u2019s it. Like my brother never\nventured out, because he was almost six foot tall, and he couldn\u2019t go out because what is he\ndoing midday on the street, when everybody else is in the army, or -- or working? So what is he\ndoing at night out, he can\u2019t go out, so he never went out.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, because I mean we knew -- you know, we wouldn\u2019t travel the time when\npeople were working, we tried to travel with the crowd.

No, I wasn\u2019t, okay? And Austrians, when they -- I\nmean, it\u2019s stupid to say, are very nosy. And, you were a war bride? No. How come you speak\nsuch good -- you know. I learned it.",

So he -- they were making a movie and the policeman said to him, have you gone to\nMauthausen? And my husband said no. So he told him how to get there, but among other things\nhe also said he lived the ri -- the -- it\u2019s -- it was a country road, okay, and the trucks would go\npast there. There was -- you know, there was the road, and there was houses on one side of the\nstreet. And he said, you know, the trucks would go by, we didn\u2019t know that there was a camp\nthere, there were thi -- they were doing this. So that\u2019s the mentality of the -- of -- we didn\u2019t\nknow. I mean, we didn't want it, but we just waited for him, and we opened our arms when they\narrived.",

But they are probably better educated, and what 1s a -- a -- an\nAustrian? Austria was a mixture of Czechs, Poles, Yugoslavs, you know, I mean there\u2019s no such\na thing as a pure Austrian. They all came from the so -- I mean, it was the great Austrian under\nthe -- under the emperor. So there\u2019s no such a thing, so you have a mixture of -- of people. And\nas I said, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I was -- I\u2019m prejudiced, I suppose, and I look at them totally different.\nAnd so I can\u2019t really -- I\u2019m -- I can\u2019t have a unprejudiced opinion.",

        "A: Yeah, we were about with 15 other people. We were with 15 other people. We -- and there\nwas one -- there was one family who thought that they weren\u2019t Jewish, the -- they converted, but\nthey were with us, too. And the mother died, and I think Mariani took care of the girl, and I think\nthe father also survived. I don\u2019t know because I left -- I was lucky enough to be shipped out, so I\nwasn't there when Ausch -- wh-when Birkenau was liberated.",
        "A: Well, we arrived, and we were sele -- you know, there was selection, the separation of men\nand women. And in hindsight, of course, we -- after we were -- we -- after you -- the -- we talked\nto inmates, we found out what was going on. Before that you had no idea. We didn\u2019t. And\nMariani\u2019s husband was sent to one side, my brother went in the other side, and Mariani and I are\n-- were together. And we were together for a whi -- for a -- in fact, I wanted my brother to go\nwith Mariani\u2019s husband and they pushed him back. He went right into -- into selection. And\nMariani and I were in the block together for maybe four weeks or so, four or five weeks, and\nthen I worked that we -- I was sent to work in -- they tor -- I still don\u2019t know what they did with\nit. You tor -- you tore the clothing into strips, braided them, and that\u2019s it. Whatever they did with\nit, whatever they used it for, I never found out. And then I worked -- I built a road to the east, we\nwere transporting rocks and breaking the rocks, and there we had a guard who would let us sit in\nthe outhouse by the tower to take a re -- it was brutally hot, even in -- in September. No, th --\nOctober -- no, was towards -- 1t was hot. And he would let us go in one by one and when the\nsuper -- the guy who was supervising, him came -- he came on a horse, so he could see him, so\nhe would call whoever was in there out.

        "A: It was physical labor. I mean, people breaking -- you know, breaking stones and loading them\ninto lorries and moving the lorries, and dumping them in this -- 1n the -- in the road bed. And -- I\nmean, it was physical labor.",

Okay, that was not -- and I was there two -- I had\ndysentery, and in fact, that\u2019s where Mariani broke her nose, she came to visit me and she slipped,\nshe broke her nose. But fortunately I got out of there, and after I got out of there, I -- we did\nlandscaping for -- with pick and shovel. And they had -- also they had Russian prisoners there,\npr-prisoners of war, I suppose. And there was one of them, he used -- they had -- he must have\nbeen working in an orchard or something, and whenever we crossed, he would give me apples.

And -- and that\u2019s it. So it 1s really -- the -- the\nweird -- I think the weirdness about this all, that here we are, we are sitting here and we are\ntalking about it. Right? And we can laugh, as sad as it is, so --",
        "A: Yes and no, you know. I -- I had a -- a friend which -- she died of TB. We slept together -- so\n-- in the work camp. See, I was very lucky because I was only in Auschwitz from the end of June\nto October, and at that point they were looking for German citizens. Suddenly I became\n[indecipherable] German citizen. Was elevated. And they were looking for laborers, labor for a --\nfor a factory. And that\u2019s when we were shipped out, and then we were shi -- there were -- we -- it\nmust have been all the way up north, and -- and what is it called, they have -- they have the --\nright by the -- you know, the -- where the bogs are, what is it called?",

And they kept us there for while, and the horrible part there\nwas it was very damp, and it was very wet, and the only place -- th-the onl -- they built a latrine.\nAll they did was dig a hole, put -- took the bark off the trees and made a landing, so to say, and\nthen put a log across, and my biggest fear was to fall in, to slip because it was wet.

        "A: -- like a -- a platform, but it was all tree -- 1t was like an -- a -- a logs, but they had no bark on\nit, because if you had bark on it, you don\u2019t slip.

        "A: No. We were in block 13, and you know what the greatest -- the most horrible part about\nAuschwitz was, to me anyway, was that I could not comprehend -- now I understand, but then I\ncouldn\u2019t comprehend, the cru -- the cruelty of the -- of the Jewish people to -- you know, like the\nblockoma, okay? I walked -- when we were there, the first day, I went up to a young kid, she had\nher mother and her sister with her, she was younger than I am, beautiful, beautiful girl, Polish.\nAnd I ask her to -- the house -- the bunk was empty, if Mariani could go inside. It was brutally\nhot, and humid. She wouldn\u2019t let her go in, okay? And I said, if I ever come across her, I'll really\nkill her. I had such anger at her. I did come across her. What did she do? At -- we were li -- at the\nday we were liberated, she -- I s -- suddenly see her, what\u2019d she do? There was a German kid,\nand she knocked him off his bike and she took the bike. And I said, you know what? I wouldn\u2019t\neven dirty my hands on her. It was -- it was so -- I mean, I-I could not understand, you know,\nthat the -- the kapos and whatever, would -- I mean, she wasn't specially cruel, she was dumb,\nbecause she had entry to clothing and everything, and she would parade -- she was a kid -- sh -- I\n-- | remember one day she had a pink peignoir with feathers and slippers and a cigarette holder,\nand she would parade through the -- I mean, she was a kid.

        "A: No, no, she was the -- really, she was the only one. But a-as I said, when I was there, I\ncouldn\u2019t comprehend the cruelty. But that -- that was the method. That\u2019s what the -- that was ve-\nvery German type -- you know, that\u2019s -- that was their method of doing it, because that really\ngnawed in your ment -- on your mind. I mean, now I understand it, because they had to survive\nthemselves, okay? That was their way of surviving. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if I\nwould have been in the position.

That\u2019s -- you know -- because I didn\u2019t know what they were going to do to\nhim.

As I said, if you\ndon\u2019t laugh, you cry. When I -- when we first went -- got there, you know, we undressed, we\nwent into the shower, they cut your hair. They tattooed you and they gave you clothes. And you\nhave to remember we came from -- that we want to say normal life. We had normal clothes on\nand here I get whatever they gave me, I know what it was. It was a navy blue, straight dress. And\nit had a whatever on there.

And they took that as -- a-\nas that\u2019s what it was. And as they got older, and they heard and they learned and they never\nquestioned why I said that.

And whenever they\nask a question I would answer them, but I would never elaborate, because whatever they wanted\nto know they -- they were told, but let them digest it so to say and if they want to know ask more.\nAnd I -- I really feel that when they ask me to speak in the -- in the temple, I said, the children\nonly have to be 13 or 14, and -- and that\u2019s it.",

        "A: No, no the -- I mean, you know, I me -- I mean there were times I used to call her every single\nday when she was still -- when she was not -- when she could see it, and she was alone, so I\nwould call her every single day, and talk to her, you know? And here and there we would, you\nknow, laugh about something. I mean, she will tell -- she will tell you when she bought me my\nfirst high heeled shoes and I couldn't walk in. So, you know, things like -- we had -- as I said, we\nwill say, you know, it\u2019s a miracle that ha -- all things said and done, you live a more or less\nnormal life. That\u2019s -- whatever the norm is.",

        "A: I nev -- I never did, and I -- I don\u2019t think that I ever dwelled on a day to day basis what is\ngoing to be tomorrow. Whatever was going to be tomorrow, we face it tomorrow.",
        "A: More or less, yes, more or less. Because there is a be -- you know, to look into the future, you\nworry today and tomorrow something different. I mean, it\u2019s human nature, yes, we do worry. I\u2019m\nnot saying I\u2019m not worried about certain things and drive myself crazy over nothing.
