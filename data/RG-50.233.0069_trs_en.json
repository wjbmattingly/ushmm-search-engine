        "Lehner, Emmi\nRG 50.233*0069\nOne Audiotape\nRecorded July 9, 1992\nSide A\nInterviewer: I am Anthony Di Iorio. I am at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and today is\nJuly 9, 1992. Iam about to interview Mrs. Emmi Lehner of Miami, Florida about her recollections of life\nin Austria before the war and about the story of her sister, Helene Lebel. Okay, Emmi, could you begin by\ntelling us something about yourself and where you grew up and--.\nEmmi Lehner: | grew up in Vienna. In the third district.\nInterviewer: Third district.\nEmmi Lehner: In the Vorderezollamtstrasse. This is a very nice section there because the\nKriegsministerium is there and one arm of the Danube, a canal which is very pretty, very nice. I got\nmarried when I was very young to the owner of the Imperial Hotel, the son of the owner of the Imperial\nHotel and lived there for three and a half years until '38 when Hitler marched in. I was at the hotel and\nHitler was already in the Furstner Apartment, we called that on the second floor where always the royalty\nwould stay. It 1s a--was a royalty hotel. They asked us to leave, you know. When I was standing outside,\nthey asked me to--Mr. Hitler would come on the balcony and we should sing the Horst Wessel song\nwhich I didn't know. I didn't know anything about Hitler too much because in Vienna, we didn't know so\nmuch about it. Then they didn't let us go there. There was an SS man next to each person who stood in\nfront of the Imperial Hotel. It took approximately an hour and a half and then we left. I could not get in\nbecause they took the whole hotel over.\nInterviewer: This was in March, 1938?\nEmmi Lehner: 1938, yes. On the 13th of March, 1938. No, I think it was the 11th, correct. The 11th of\nMarch. When I was married, my sister was out of the hospital. She was six months in the Allgemeinen\nKrankenhaus at the Potzel Clinic.\nInterviewer: Six months, she was in which --?\nEmmi Lehner: In the Allgemeinen. It is the biggest--.\nInterviewer: General Hospital.\nEmmi Lehner: General Hospital, yes. She was there six months, first under Wagner Jauregg, then\nWagner died, during the time Helli was in the hospital. Wagner Jauregg is one--was one of the biggest\npsychiatrists in the world. Then Professor Potzel took over and Helene was there maybe three more\nmonths and then she was released.\nInterviewer: This was in 1934?\nEmmi Lehner: [n 1934.",
        "Interviewer: 1934. Was that the first time she was in the hospital?\nEmmi Lehner: That was the first time she was in the hospital. As a matter of fact, it was actually before\nthat because Helli and I, we went every Sunday to the old Danube to swim. That particular Sunday, Helli\nacted very strange. She said, you know, I hear constantly voices. She says, I'm going home. I said, I just\ncame here. I don't want to go home If you want to go home, go alone home. When I came home, that\nnight, there was a letter on the dining room table and it was addressed to my mother. I couldn't open it; I\nwaited until my mother came home. That letter she was not home. In that letter she said, I'm very much\nafraid you will be killed and I'm going to take a train. But she didn't say exactly where she's going. But\naround 12 o'clock at night, she came back. She was very restless and very strange. My mother called her\nsister and her sister was very friendly with a doctor who worked at the Allgemeinen Krankenhaus. She\ncalled and said what should I do? She said bring her in immediately. That was like a crisis center here.\nWhere you take people---like a--where you take people when they are, you know.\nInterviewer: Do you know when this was, this first time?\nEmmi Lehner: Helene was 19.\nInterviewer: Nineteen.\nEmmi Lehner: Born in'11.\nInterviewer: 1930.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, that's what it was. I was already with my husband, I wasn't married yet.\nInterviewer: You had a fiancee. Then?\nEmmi Lehner: Helli went in and was six months in the hospital. After the six months, she came out and\nwe decided to get married and Helli was at the wedding.\nInterviewer: So there was a four-year period from this first --?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, she went to Graz to my grandmother and went to the university. In Vienna, she went\nto the university and then she got a job during the time she went to the university she got a job ina\nlawyer's office.\nInterviewer: This is in Vienna?\nEmmi Lehner: In Vienna.\nInterviewer: So she went to Graz with your grandmother?\nEmmi Lehner: With grandmother and stayed there. I was already married. She was at the wedding. We\nhad a very, very large wedding, 400 guests.\nInterviewer: She was there for a long time, in Graz?\nEmmi Lehner: In Graz, well she was there, I would say seven or eight months. She came back and came\nto my house and smoked a lot. At that time, I didn't know anything about smoking. Helli smoked and\nHelli said to me, I'm going home now and bring you all your books, the schoolbooks. I said, no; don't\nbring me that because I don't want them here at the hotel. I lived at the hotel, the Imperial Hotel. I said no,\nno, don't bring it. She left. Then in the evening, my mother called and said Helli was taken to Steinhof.\nThere she was maybe--. In 1938, we decided to leave. We decided actually already in January to leave but",
        "we didn't leave and didn't leave, and then Hitler marched in. We left at that night when he marched in. We\nwanted to go to Hungary where we had very good friends but they did not let us go in there. The\nHungarians made it plain; we can't go back to Vienna. It was very exciting because there was the SS and\nthe SA. We were very lucky. One of the men, who belonged to the SS, my husband didn't know, was an\nemployee of the hotel. He recognized my husband and he made a cordon and said: It's Mr. Walter Lehner,\nits okay, let him go out. He didn't ask us where we wanted to go, we wanted to--. My mother was with us\nand we said we are going on vacation to Hungary, to Budapest. That man didn't think anything, was one\nof our detectives from the hotel, that he was already a Nazi. So we went back and my husband\nimmediately tried to get out because my husband was of the military age. Twenty-six or something like\nthat. We heard already that the Germans would start a war and he would be called up. They wanted to\ntake the Austrians first so he tried and went before I left. A month or so before I left, he went to\nSwitzerland. We had--the daughter of the hotel was owned by a friend of his father He went, left; and I,\non the 14th or 15th of July, I went to see Helli, my sister for the last time. I went to the Steinhof and didn't\nsay goodbye to her because I didn't want her to know that I'm leaving for good. But she had some kind of\npremonition. She was not bad; she was very good-behaved, very well and looked very good. I said\ngoodbye and she said, well, when do you think I see you again? I didn't answer that very much; I said\nvery soon and left. It was the last time I saw her. It was in '38.\nInterviewer: July of 1938?\nEmmi Lehner: July of 1938.\nInterviewer: How long had she been in Steinhof?\nEmmi Lehner: She was there for about--she came out in Christmas when I was already married. Just a\nsecond, can you hold that--- (interruption)\nInterviewer: Yes, I will. We were talking about you leaving in July, 1938 and you visited--.\nEmmi Lehner: On the 15th, on the 11th, 13th or so. I went to see her, to see Helli to say goodbye--in my\nown mind, but not to her.\nInterviewer: Right, right. And you said she looked good and she was well-behaved.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, she was very well-behaved. I don't know if you are familiar- all mental hospitals\nhave pavilions. In this pavilion, the people move around. For instance, if you are very bad, you go to\nanother pavilion. When you are very good, you can go in a pavilion where they have typewriters, sewing\nmachines, whatever you want to do, you can do there. They have their occupy the patients quite a bit, you\nknow. Only if they're good. So Helen was at that time--number one is very bad and number--up to\nnumbers--she was in number nine which is a very good one. But there were many times when I was there\nwhen she was not, when she was in number two. But this time she was in nine and I felt very good, that\nshe looked good, her hair is nicely done and she looked good. Then I--.\nInterviewer: How long--the question I had asked when the doorbell rang, was how long had she been at\nSteinhof?\nEmmi Lehner: Well, from--when she was nineteen, it started. She went first to the Allgemeinen\nKrankenhaus for six months. Then she came out and the next time she did not go to the Allgemeinen\nKrankenhausi she went directly to Steinhof. My mother took her but I was with her. We had the hotel car\nand we took her. She was very disturbed. She was very difficult.\nInterviewer: When would that have been?",
        "Emmi Lehner: That was in, I would say, '34. I was married already a year. In, '35.\nInterviewer: '35. so that's the first time she went to Steinhof?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes.\nInterviewer: Before that, it was the Allgemeine?\nEmmi Lehner: Allgemeinen Krankenhaus, yes. Potzel Clinic. It's called the Potzel Clinic which is the\npsychiatric department. Then Helli came out the same year for Christmas but she couldn't stay. She said\ntake me back. I can\u2019t stand the noise and I can\u2019t stand the lights, I can't stand the furniture. She did not\nwant to stay and that was the last time she was out. We had to take her back to Steinhof and then we\nvisited her. We had to restrict our visiting times. I went three times; my mother went three times, to see\nher sometimes four times. Then' 38 came along. That was a very tragic thing and I didn't think that\nanything would happen to Helli because she was in the hospital. When--the moment the war broke out, I\nhad no more opportunity. As long as there was no war, I was in England for two years, you know, we\ncould not immigrate to the United States right away. We were waiting for a quota number. We stayed in\nEngland with friends. I had always letter from Mother and Helli put always little notes in saying, hello\nEmmi, how is it? Like it in England? And I'm fine. Things like--. Very short notes. Then when the war\nbroke out, there was no communication until I went to the Red Cross. They were only very short note and\nall of a sudden I didn't hear anything from my parents, or from my sister, or anything. That went\napparently into '40 when they started to empty out the Steinhof, took all mental patients out and killed\nthem. But I didn't--my mother never wrote me that.\nInterviewer: She was in--.\nEmmi Lehner: The letter which I gave you. I found in my mother's desk, after my mother's death. She\nhad never sent me that letter, nor did she tell me anything. She said I cannot visit Helli, it is so far away.\nMy mother was at that time in Poznan.\nInterviewer: Poznan, I know.\nEmmi Lehner: She had no opportunity to go and visit Helli. But it happened very fast because in '40\nwhen the war broke out, they took them all away because they needed the Allgemeine, the Steinhof for\nthe soldiers. That's what my mother told me when she came to visit me the first time in America. She\nnever elaborated on Helli's death. You know, I was very much anti-German, always. Because I knew\nwhat Germany wanted from us. My mother knew that and she didn\u2019t\u2019 want to elaborate what these\nGermans all did. My father had a position in a German hospital in Poznan. She never elaborated on that.\nShe never said, I guess that Helli is still alive, did you hear from Helli? Until that letter came, that letter\nshe never mentioned to me. I found it in her desk when I came the first time to Vienna.\nInterviewer: So Helli was in Steinhof from early 1936 until she was transferred to Germany? She was\nnever released again?\nEmmi Lehner: Never released again. Apparently she had gotten worse. I really don't know. My mother\nnever talked about it very much but she knew how much 1|--. Helene and I were very, very close. We\nwere just like twins. She knew everything she would tell me which is negative, she would know that it\nwould hurt me very much. So I didn't hear it until when I went in 1971, I went to Vienna because my\nmother was very sick. Four weeks later she died. Then I cleared out the apartment and I found the letter.\nThe particulars what she had from Helli, her birth certificate and things like that.\nInterviewer: Now, I've seen one photograph of Helli and she's holding--?",
        "Emmi Lehner: Lydi, our dog.\nInterviewer: Liddy?\nEmmi Lehner: Lydi was our dog. L-y-d-i.\nInterviewer: L-y-d-i. And it looks like a terrier.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, she's a fox terrier. My father had a kennel. We had quite a bit of them and my father\nsold them. She was our dog. Helli's and my dog. She came from England, a female. She came from\nEngland, from one of my cousins and we loved her to death. Till she died.\nInterviewer: Yeah, so that was--?\nEmmi Lehner: Helli and I, we were every summer in Grimmenstein. This is a very famous lung\nsanatorium. My father was a business with the pol--, like a director. He had, himself, lung trouble and was\nnot supposed to be in vienna. So we went every summer for two months there. All the time we were off\nschool. Helli and I we had a wonderful time there. There was no sign that she would be mentally ill. That\nwas when we were maybe, I ten, and Helene, eleven. We were sixteen months apart. From that time on\nuntil I married, I was always in Grimmenstein with her. Then when she was nineteen, she got sick. That\nwas the first time she got sick.\nInterviewer: Did you just spend the summers there or--?\nEmmi Lehner: We spent the whole summer there. We could not stay in the lung sanatorium. We had to\nbe in a separate house with a Fraulein, you know. We had wonderful times; there was no sign that she\ncould ever be sick.\nInterviewer: The first sign was that --?\nHer birthday's in September. They said summer we were on the old Danube. Before we were supposed to\ngo to Grimmenstein. But it started when she was 19 years old, September 15, she was 19.\nInterviewer: So Lydi was your dog and --?\nEmmi Lehner: Was our dog, Helli and my dog. I loved--we loved--Helli too, loved the dog so much. She\nwas in Grimmenstein many times because, excuse me sir, leave me that form there please. I cannot sign it\nright now. Just a moment.\nInterviewer: And we were talking about Lydi was your dog and I was going to ask you, how long did\nyou have--when did you first get Lydi and how long did you have her?\nEmmi Lehner: When I was married one year, I married 1n '34. In '35 I told Helli when I visited her that\nLydi is now in Grimmenstein because she had an eczema which went all over her body. She was ten years\nold at that time. I was married already a year and I said to my husband, I'd like to go to Grimmenstein one\nmore time and say goodbye to Lydi because we heard about all the things which were happening that\nmaybe Germany will get into Austria, you know. I went up; I wanted to see her one more time. She was\nvery sick at that time and, I think, a few months later she died.\nInterviewer: Lydi died?\nEmmi Lehner: Not in our house, not in my mother's house, but in Grimmenstein. My father had a kennel\nthere which had a man and woman took care of her.",
        "Interviewer: The reason why I was asking that, was Helli especially attached to Lyd1?\nEmmi Lehner: Yeah. Helli always walked her. One day, this were the signs which come to my mind\nnow, that when Helli started--. You see, this type of sickness Helli had starts usually in puberty from girl-\nInterviewer: Thirteen years old?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, no, it didn't start that way. It started, I think, around when I was sixteen and Hell\nwas seventeen and a half. There were signs. Signs like she took Lydi for a walk to the inner city of\nVienna which is very crowded always. Lydi had to wear a muzzle because in Austria it was the rule; all\ndogs had to wear muzzles. She took him and then she went into a department store and left the dog\noutside. She was very well-trained. You didn't have to have her on a leash, you know. She was always\nwalking next to you. My father knew dogs very well and she was very well-trained. Helli went out\nanother side and forgot the dog. We were besides ourselves. I was already married at that time. But the\ndog came home and you know this is maybe half an hour walk from the inner city to the address where\nwe lived. She came by herself and the muzzle was on the side. Was not on her.\nInterviewer: She hadn't been arrested?\nEmmi Lehner: No, she was not arrested. She walked by herself home. Helli was naturally very happy\nthat she came. But Helli was always with the dog. I got married and I had my own dog. I bought my own\ndog, another wire-haired fox terrier.\nInterviewer: Yes. I was going to ask if there was any connection between Helli's worsening situation in\n'35 and the death of the dog?\nEmmi Lehner: Well, it was not really connected because she had the eczema, she had this very bad skin\nrash because she was plucked all the time. We trimmed her all the time, what she should look like. She\nwas a very beautiful dog. I don't think it had any connection with Helene, no. Helene started with like\nforgetting the dog. This is -you can do this but as a rule, you don't. Very little signs which started. When\nshe was at this lawyer's, when she took this job at the lawyer's office as part secretary and went to the\nuniversity, we had a--each of us had a ring from our father, a black pearl ring. Helli came home and called\nme. I was at the hotel and she called me for a moment and said, you know, I was so sad today, there was a\nlady washing the floor in the university. She's there, I gave her my ring. I nearly dropped dead because\nthis ring was the only thing we had from our father, our real father. I went to call my mother right away\nand said~ what happened? She said Helli is so strange. She goes out in the middle of the night, around\none 0' clock, two 0' clock, all of a sudden I hear the door go and Helli's gone. My mother was very\nconcerned. Young girls don't go out at night, you know. She took her clothes; she looked around; she\ncouldn't find her. Around two o'clock, she would come back. Then she walked at night. She went out--we\nhad a very large hallway from the entrance to the living room. Helli would walk up and down, up and\ndown. That's when my mother called her sister who had a friend in the Allgemeinen Krankenhaus, a\ndoctor. And she said you have to bring her in, we would like to test her and see her. From that time on,\nshe got worse and worse,. Then came that Sunday, when we were at the Danube and she disappeared and\nshe said I hear such voices. What are these voices around me? It was the beginning of her sickness. When\nwe talked to all the doctors, they thought it was schizophrenia.\nInterviewer: From that time on, schizophrenia?\nEmmi Lehner: At that time, let me tell you, knowing so much about mental hospitals because Peter had--\nthat really had no connections with Peter. Peter had a brain-damage when he was born.",
        "Interviewer: You're talking about your Peter?\nEmmi Lehner: My son, yes. Because many people think because Helli had that, that this is inherited; it is\nnot. It has nothing to do with Peter. We found out, my mother found out that when she was a year and a\nhalf old, she had a very--we went on a Danube trip on a Sunday. You know with a ship on the Danube.\nHelli got a high fever, a very high fever and was very, very sick. The doctors at that time knew very little\nabout mental illness. They know Freud and they know Wagner Jaurich studying the sicknesses in the\nmental patients. But they know not really as much as they do now, that there is some balance in the\nsituation in the brain, you know. They know so much more now than they did when Helli was sick. I\nreally don't know. They treated them very nice in the hospital, I have to say that. Because Helli was\nalways very clean, very neat. You could not go in the room where they slept. They had many people,\nthere. There were no single rooms or two-bed rooms like you have here. It was more like 10 or 12 people\nin a hall, they call it a hall, you know. When we went there, Helli would come out. You'd never go to the\nbedroom; you never saw her bed or anything like that. She came out and then there were little rooms\nwhere people were allowed to go with the patients, the patients who are behaving well. You know, there\nwere patients there who attacked their mothers and fathers and visitors. I was attacked once by a patient\nwho was just let out from the sleeping area. I wore a hat and she tore my hat off. I was scared to death but\nthen Helli came and Helli was always very good. She behaved very well.\nInterviewer: She would only be with female patients?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, yes. There were only--male and female were separated- separate pavilions.\nInterviewer: I thought we'd go back a little bit to the beginning. Mention that Helli was born in\nSeptember, 1911 and you were sixteen months younger?\nEmmi Lehner: Thirteen, 7th of March 1913.\nInterviewer: March 7, 1913 and you were the only two children?\nEmmi Lehner: Only two children, yes.\nInterviewer: Were you at that time, living in the third district or --?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, no. We lived at our grandmother. My mother became a widow when she was 21,\nwhen my father went to war and was shot in Russia. We lost our father.\nInterviewer: That was in 1914?\nEmmi Lehner: No, my father was--didn't go to war. My mother hided him. He didn't want to go to war.\nHe never wanted to shoot or do anything like this. He had no training in it. His father was a--had a most\nbeautiful store in Vienna of antique pictures like Van Gogh's and very, very famous painters. My father\nwas supposed to go to America to deliver a Van Gogh, I think it was, to the Vanderbilt\u2019s in America. He\nwas a gambler. My father was, unfortunately, not on good terms with his father because he was a gambler\nquite a bit, roulette, you know, casinos in France He lost that picture and came back. The war broke out\nand my mother did hide him for two years. In '14 the war broke out, in '16, they got him--they sent him on\nthe Russian front; and one month later he died, he was killed.\nInterviewer: So he was killed in 1916?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes. We were very young and my mother became a Red Cross nurse. During the war,\neverybody had to do something. She became a Red Cross nurse and met my stepfather as a patient. He",
        "was shot in the shoulder and lost a lot of blood. My mother was one of his nurses there. They fell in love\nand married when they were very young because my mother was around 21. She was 16 when she got my\nsister.\nInterviewer: Your stepfather was a patient in her hospital? He was a soldier?\nEmmi Lehner: He was a soldier, a regular soldier. Even so he had Matura, had very good schooling and\nshould have been an officer. But because he didn't answer the call of his duty right away, they made him\nas a regular soldier. One month later he was dead. So that was the beginning of a very hard time for us but\nwe were very lucky because my stepfather was wonderful. He was a very, very--he loved us; he was very\ngood to us. I would say he preferred me more than Helli. Helli always criticized him, you know, you're\nnot my father, don't tell me this. You're not my real father, things like that Helli would say. But he was\nvery good to us, all his life until he died.\nInterviewer: When did he marry your mother?\nEmmi Lehner: He married my mother in 1926.\nInterviewer: His name was--?\nEmmi Lehner: Artur Celebrini. Like A-B, C-e-l-e-b-r-i-n-1.\nInterviewer: That's an Italian name.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes. His father was from Fiume I think, and his mother was from Austria.\nInterviewer: Your mother, her name was also Emma. So you were named after your mother?\nEmmi Lehner: Emma? Helli and I, we had one godmother and her name was Melani. We have both our\nmiddle names are Melani. Helli was Melani Lebel, L-e-b-e-l and Emma--\nInterviewer: Melani, can you spell that please?\nEmmi Lehner: M-e-l-a-n-i1. Melani. The girl like in Gone With the Wind.\nInterviewer: So Helene Melani Lebel.\nEmmi Lehner: Helli, that's H-e-l-e-n-e. She was probably in when she was in the hospital under Lebel.\nYou know there's an accent sign on the last \"e\". That's why we say Lebel, and not Lebel.\nInterviewer: Yes, so there's an accent on the last \u2018e\u2019?\nEmmi Lehner: The last e, an accent sign on there.\nInterviewer: French style?\nEmmi Lehner: Yeah, well he came from French descent.\nInterviewer: Now what religion were--?\nEmmi Lehner: We were always Catholic.\nInterviewer: Catholic.\nEmmi Lehner: Always. When I married, I married-in the, what you call it, not in the Church because my\nhusband's father was Jewish, his mother was a Christian. I did not want to become Jewish or anything like",
        "that. I was seven years in a convent and they were--in Vienna. I just didn't want to change my religion. I\nwasn't a religious person but I didn't want to change it.\nInterviewer: You were baptized in the Catholic religion?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, I was baptized.\nInterviewer: Both you and Helli were raised as Catholics?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, as Catholics, we were in the convent together.\nInterviewer: Your mother was also Catholic?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, Catholic, my stepfather was Catholic too.\nInterviewer: Your stepfather was Catholic. What about your father?\nEmmi Lehner: My father was considered--in his birth certificate which I found in my mother's desk. He\nwas \u201cconfessionslos\u201d (without religion) since he was sixteen. He was from Jewish parents but\nconfessionslos.\nInterviewer: So he was of Jewish ancestry?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, absolutely.\nInterviewer: This is Alfred now.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, Alfred. I never met his mother. My grandmother I never met because they were\ndivorced, my grandfather and my grandmother. She went to Germany and I never met her.\nInterviewer: Would Lebel have been considered a Jewish name?\nEmmi Lehner: | think it would be, yes.\nInterviewer: So the people at the hospital would have known?\nEmmi Lehner: They would have known but I tell you frankly. I have a friend who was half-Jewish, half-\nGentile and nothing happened to them in Austria. I don't think they did anything to Helli because she was\nJewish, I really don't know.\nInterviewer: Even after the Nazis came in?\nEmmi Lehner: The Nazis decided all mental patients should be killed. They had not enough food, not\nenough shelter for them. Didn't want to use the hospitals for mentally sick people. You see that the bad\npart was that she was a lengthy there. There was no interruptions, that she was better, she could come out\nor things like that, you know. She was constantly there and decided probably that she was really mentally\nill.\nInterviewer: I remember although I don't know if it was from you or from Trudy, that she was supposed\nto be released?\nEmmi Lehner: That I don't know. Trudy knows more--. I'll tell you what happened. Trudy knows more\nabout my parents during the war because she was in Italy and my father, when he finally got out of jail, he\nwas arrested by the Russians and was a year in jail when my mother got him out. He went to Italy--he\nspoke fluent Italian and he went to Trudy, stayed with Trudy. Then my mother came from Austria to him.",
        "This period is very dark with me because there was a war on you know and we had--there was no\npossibility to talk lengthy with them, or see them or anything.\nInterviewer: Yes. The news that I heard was that they were told that she was better and that she would be\nreleased soon. Instead of being released, she was--the notice was that she was transferred to another\nhospital in Germany.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes and my mother really thought it was a hospital.\nInterviewer: In fact the name of the hospital was Niedernhart, which I think is in Bavaria.\nEmmi Lehner: My mother said it was very far from where she was when they were in Poznan. She said\nthere is no chance for me to travel there.\nInterviewer: Although they really sent her to Brandenburg which is near Berlin.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, that is what I heard. In one of my letters from the Red Cross that Hell is in\nBrandenburg. That's what my mother wrote. But I thought it was a hospital. I didn't know Germany.\nInterviewer: The reason I was asking, those questions about your father was that in July, 1940, the Nazis\nordered that all Jewish patients in mental hospitals, and in wards and in clinics and so forth, be removed\nand sent to be killed. That included Mischlinge.\nEmmi Lehner: | guess that's probably so.\nInterviewer: Yeah and I would think that they would have known--\nEmmi Lehner: I tell you frankly when my husband decided right away to leave because he had a Jewish\nfather and he was brought up in the Jewish religion. In the end when we left, we were remarried in a very\nlittle church in Grinzing somewhere. I really can't remember where that was because when he decided, he\ndoes not know yet, he goes to England or he goes to Australia. His sister went to Australia, my husband's\nsister. To Australia, you could not come in as a Jew; you had to be a Catholic. -- Lily, who was Jewish\ntoo and married- had a Jewish husband; they decided to become Catholics. My husband became a\nCatholic too but the reason before, he was a devout Jew actually, but the reason he became Catholic was\nonly for getting into some place. Then we decided to go to England. We had friends in England which we\nhad no money so we had to depend on our friends. But it is possible that what they said before and what\nthey do afterwards is entirely different, you know, and they probably did know that Helene was Jewish.\nInterviewer: The name, yeah. They didn't pay attention to religion. They looked at it as heredity, race--.\nEmmi Lehner: Probably and if I would have stayed, because in the beginning we wanted Walter to go by\nhimself, and then I come when he sees what he is going to do, if he is going to stay in England, or if he\ncan go to America or things like that. We didn't know that. We were very lucky, we had a very good\nfriend here in America who gave us the affidavit but you couldn't. You see the difference now here and\nnow everybody can come to America. I don't understand it. We had to wait two and a half years before\nour quota came through. In these two and a half years, we had no money; we were solely supported by\nfriends. Selling whatever jewelry I had to wait for the affidavit to come to America. Actually, you know,\nin America, my husband really got a job maybe after six weeks being in the United States. He got a job in\nNew Jersey but we wanted to go to Florida because my husband is a hotel man, you know, was a hotel\nman.\nInterviewer: When did you come to America?",
        "Emmi Lehner: In 1940, April, 1940.\nInterviewer: So right in the middle of the war?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, we were escorted by U-boats and planes on top and secret service which we didn't\nknow the name of the boat or anything. We were sent to Manchester. We went from London to\nManchester and from Manchester we were with secret police to the boat. It was very exciting, we were 14\ndays on the--we went from there to zigzag to Greenland. In Greenland we went back, it was a long, long\ntrip. The reason for that was because the English sent all their pictures from the galleries and the gold in\nthat particular boat. We were not escorted because we were Jewish immigrants. We were escorted\nbecause of the jewels and the gold and the pictures which were in the same boat where we were. Very bad\ntrip, we had to have gas masks, the whole thing all the time because we were chased by German U-boats.\nInterviewer: What could you say about growing up? Little girls?\nEmmi Lehner: Growing up in Austria--you see, I'm here now 51 years in the United States. I came in\nApril '40.\nInterviewer: Fifty-two.\nEmmi Lehner: Practically 52 years, yes. I can tell you I have been never so happy as being here in the\nUnited States. I love this country, I think Austria is a great and beautiful country to travel through but I\ncouldn\u2019t--. When I was back, I was back every second year to see my mother, you know, after the war,\nwhen my mother came back, when Peter was born. But for some reason, I felt always as a stranger there. I\ncan't understand Trudy. I cannot understand it--that she would prefer to stay there. I think Trudy would\nprefer to stay there because I can't imagine going twice a year to Austria.\nInterviewer: Well the latest word is that she's lonely and homesick. And wants to come back.\nEmmi Lehner: | can't believe this. Well, you know what she's homesick for? Trudy loves New York and\nshe loves the opera. Really this is her biggest thing. She goes to it two or three times to the opera. I don't\nknow what it is in Austria, what she sees there. I mean here in America where you have freedom and\nwhere you have everything. You know Austria is a very small country and very -- I didn't feel at home. I\nwas there three times after I left. I tell you frankly. I was always so glad to come back.\nInterviewer: Well you and your sister, you grew up--it must have been difficult because your father died\nand then it was a war going on?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes. We were really supported by the Americans after the war.\nInterviewer: This is after World War I?\nEmmi Lehner: After World War I, the Americans gave us food. Without these packages which my\nmother picked up every week, we wouldn't survive. It was so bad. My mother had to go with Trudy's\nmother and another sister to the country and give them their rings and whatever they had. The farmers had\neggs and chickens and things like that.\nInterviewer: Who took care of you and Helli when you were little girls?\nEmmi Lehner: Well, you know we had a pension, Helene and I had a pension after our father was killed\nin the war. We had a small pension which my mother really lived on until my father got a job in\nGrimmenstein where he was a Verwalter.",
        "Interviewer: He was your stepfather?\nEmmi Lehner: My stepfather. Then things were much better. We had a very beautiful home which was\nmy grandfather's home and we lived in a very good neighborhood.\nInterviewer: Grandfather Celebrini or--?\nEmmi Lehner: Grandfather Lebel. We had a very nice apartment. We had my mother's--I don't know\nhow she did it--I tell you frankly I thought it over what she had to do to survive. But when my father got a\njob, he had to stay away from Vienna. You know the cobblestone tiles where we had to walk horses and\nthings, the concrete splintered off. It was very bad for people with lung trouble. He had only one lung.\nOne lung was taken out and he was very, very sick. When I was seven or eight and Helene was nine or\nten, my father was maybe seven months in the hospital. He nearly died there of tuberculosis. Then he was\nsent to Grimmenstein, to a sanatorium there and there he got his job. His uncle was a doctor too. His\nfather was a doctor and he had very many friends in the medical center. We survived. When I was 14,\nthings were more normal. Since we lived in a very good neighborhood, we went to a good school. I went\nto Ursulinen, the Catholic school--.\nInterviewer: You went to a Catholic school?\nEmmi Lehner: | went to a Catholic school.\nInterviewer: And Helli?\nEmmi Lehner: Helli too.\nInterviewer: Catholic grade school?\nEmmi Lehner: Grade school. I was there until I was in the--what you would call--\nInterviewer: Junior high?\nEmmi Lehner: Junior high. Junior high I went to the center of the city, to a public school but a very good\npublic school. Because, you know, in Vienna things are very divided. For instance, working-class people\nlive in the tenth district and white-collar workers in the first and second, third districts. Second district is\ncompletely Jewish.\nInterviewer: Yes, the Leopold Stadt.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, the Leopold Stadt. Completely Jewish. It was still rather segregated there. The\nreason for that was mostly that many of the girls--these girls married Jewish men. These Jewish men\ncame either from Poland or Russia, there was a--\nInterviewer: Or Hungary?\nEmmi Lehner: Hungary or Czechoslovakia. There were so many mixed marriages here. The Jewish\npeople had, I don't know, made more money, I always thought they had more money than the other\npeople. We did not have anything--I belonged to a club. I played land hockey when I was 14. In that club,\nwere I don't know what, were regular people, I never asked a person what religion are you. You know,\nthat was not--we never spoke about it. I was not prepared in religion when I was 14 so I was seven years\nin a convent.\nInterviewer: A convent.",
        "Emmi Lehner: | hated that, going to church on Sunday. My mother never forced me to. So when Helli\nand I, we were both from religion, had many Jewish friends. From the club where I belonged to and they\nare saying that all these people, I heard they left Vienna after Hitler came. But they were all probably\nJewish or part-Jewish or whatever. We never really talked about this very much.\nInterviewer: Yeah. Did you have any--?\nEmmi Lehner: We found after Hitler that maybe 50% were for the Anschluss. I tell you frankly, my\nfather would say to me look if things will be much better when we are annexed to Germany. In our time,\nschools, first grade schools, junior high, you were always anti-German, why, I don't know. I wasn't\npolitically informed enough to know why Austria was so against Germany. I loved Vienna naturally and I\ndidn't want to get together with Germany. The Germans are really very different than we are. We speak\nmaybe the same language; also I cannot understand the Berliner. They speak a different German.\nInterviewer: But you and Helli attended grade school and junior high Catholic? And then afterwards--?\nEmmi Lehner: After that, we went to public school.\nInterviewer: The gymnasium?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, we went to gymnasium. I went only three years and then I switched to a--I was very\ngood in drawing--I went to Kunstgewerbeschule. This is where you learn drawing and things like--and\nanything to do with painting and handcrafts and things like that-. I went there and then I went to the hotel\nschool. One year at the hotel school; there's where I met my husband. Her father was the--. He was the ---\n--. When I married, I was the --. His father thought I should do something.\nSide B\nInterviewer: | just want to ask a little bit more about Helli's studies.\nEmmi Lehner: Well, Helli was an especially bright person.\nInterviewer: Yes.\nEmmi Lehner: Very, very bright. She was not good in school, but she was very good in geography,\nwhatever I wanted to know about homework and I didn't know what to do, I was not a good student, I\nwent--I asked Helli and Helli always knew. Helli was another one who went to the opera all the time. She\nloved opera. Naturally we could only afford stehplatz like Trudy did when she was a young girl. But we\nwere very close to Trudy and Otto, very close because we were (the children of) the two youngest sisters\nand they were always together. We went to Sommerfrische, vacation, outside of Vienna. Tante Melli was\nvery well-off. She married a very rich man, had a very good business. We were always together. We had\none Fraulein together, we were always together. Sometimes when we were little, we spent--. Trudy left,\nTrudy left for Italy. I think it was the year before.\nInterviewer: \u201837.\nEmmi Lehner: '37, yes. Then naturally everything broke apart.\nInterviewer: Now did Helli want to be anything in particular?\nEmmi Lehner: She wanted to be a lawyer.\nInterviewer: A lawyer.",
        "Emmi Lehner: That's why she was in a law office and went to the university to study law.\nInterviewer: So she finished gymnasium and then she attended the university. You said in Graz and in\nVienna?\nEmmi Lehner: In Vienna. In Graz, I understood that when she went with my step grandmother, she went\nto the university for lectures and things like that. She was always intellectual, I have to say that. But then,\nyou know, after I married and she started--she became sick.\nInterviewer: So she was a student until '35?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes.\nInterviewer: And she was a part-time legal secretary?\nEmmi Lehner: A legal secretary and she started there--the lawyer called my mother and said you know\nthere's something wrong with Helli. She sits all the time on the window and talks to the people outside.\nShe would go to the window and call people who walked by. He said if she doesn't change that very\nmuch, I don't think I can keep her. I think Helene came home and it really started with her. Because the\nday my mother took her when we were told to take her to the Allgemeine in the car from the hotel and I\ntook my mother and Helli and Tante Melli to the hospital, to the Allgemeinen Krankenhaus. There she\nwas six months, very bad. Very bad then--now this was really very bad. For Christmas we came with\nChristmas tree and presents and all that and she threw it out. She had a bad spell and she was very bad--\nhad to put her in restraints.\nInterviewer: This was after you had married?\nEmmi Lehner: I was already married. Everything was bad. Broke my heart because--.\nInterviewer: There was little you could do?\nEmmi Lehner: Very little I could do but one day I--really a few months before we decided to leave, I\nwent there and it was summer and Helli said, let me have your hat and gloves and bag. And she had a\ndress on; they allowed her to when she went out. She was outside the perimeter of the place where she\nlived. They allowed her to go into the park. They had a park and in the park there were always two nurses\nwho walked together and watched people who were on the outside. You couldn't walk away because there\nwas a gate. At the gate, you had to have a pass to get into the park and get out. Helli said all of a sudden,\ndon't I look nice. She looked beautiful. Had a hat on, gloves on, and my bag and she took my arm and\nsaid let's go out now. As we approached that gate, and the gate, two nurses were walking around right\nthere. She screamed and then she was very bad for a while, for a few weeks. But she wanted to get out.\nInterviewer: She never paid any attention to politics, did she?\nEmmi Lehner: Unfortunately, we all didn't. We should have but we didn't have television yet. We didn't\nread the newspapers. Young people were not interested. Those at the university did. The university\nstudents, as a rule, did.\nInterviewer: Yeah, that's why I asked, because she was a law student.\nEmmi Lehner: She was not. Helli was not political, not at all.\nInterviewer: Was she engaged at any time?",
        "Emmi Lehner: Yes, she was. She was engaged when she was 16 to a man who loved her very much but\nshe had somebody else in mind. This man was a drug addict and was killed on his motorcycle. This other\nman always wanted to visit her but my mother didn't want it to continue. She liked men very much, very\nfond of boys. She always warned me, you know. We were very close and she would always say, Emmi,\nnever go with any man, never do anything until you get married. Very religious in her way. When she was\nin the hospital, she became very religious. But she wasn't when she was normal.\nInterviewer: So she became religious in the hospital?\nEmmi Lehner: In the hospital. It was always stages, three weeks of this, three weeks of that.\nInterviewer: This would be Catholic religious?\nEmmi Lehner: Yes.\nInterviewer: Even though the hospital was not Catholic?\nEmmi Lehner: The hospital was not but it was a county hospital. I don't know what they were but they\nhad a chapel in there. You had to have a chapel. You know, like the Allgemeine, there's a chapel in the\ncompound but it doesn't need it. They ask you when you--whatever. But they do the same here. You know\nthat here all the time, you have to give your religion; they ask you what religion.\nInterviewer: And hers was given as Catholic?\nEmmi Lehner: Catholic, yes. You see when my mother remarried and he was a Catholic, there was no\nother way. We were not brought up\u2014my father was \u201cconfessionslos,\u201d he did not want to be any\ndenomination, you know. I mean, I can remember, I was little, I was so small when he died but --. I was\nglad that I have this Catholic religion, very good religion.\nInterviewer: Yes.\nEmmi Lehner: But that's the story. I think you're right when they find out she is partly Jewish, officially\nthey--. I don't know what happened to her officially. Officially in Vienna, that I can't tell you. Trudy was\naway and her mother was married to a Jew. So she wouldn't go back, it was March. She wouldn't go back\nfor anyone because she did not know what happened. She was too, she was Evangelisch. Trudy was not\nJewish she was Evangelisch because her stepmother was Evangelisch.\nInterviewer: Yes, she said that her father was Jewish, her mother was Catholic and they were brought up\nas Protestants.\nEmmi Lehner: As Protestants, yes, I know about Trudy and Otto. That was already so crazy in Europe,\nyou know. Once here, I'm living--, I don't know if you know Miami--.\nInterviewer: Never been there.\nEmmi Lehner: Well, you know if you would be here, there is--people are religious in this country, far\nmore than we were, ever, even now. They are going to church on Sunday, I don't but I--people around me,\nall around me neighbors and all that. They are going to church and the Jewish people are going to the\ntemple. You know when my husband was here, I go--went with him once a month to the temple. I don't\nknow nothing about Jewish religion but I mean I--my husband wanted to do this for his father. You know,\nvery fond of his father. He went every month to the temple. Had a very beautiful temple here, Second\nPlace in Miami. My husband always went there. There were- but here people are very religious, far, far\nmore religious than anybody I knew in Austria. Austria, you don't go to church much. Because there are",
        "so many Mischlinge there, an enormous amount. You know I understand now probably Trudy will tell\nyou that Vienna is overrun with foreigners. You could have Romania, Hungary, Poland. Everything is\ngood in Vienna. It is in one way good because business is very good. The hotels are all sold out. This is\napparently good. The dollar is very low and I'm very happy about that. As soon as I get my pension from\nthem. I found my husband had a pension from Vienna, through his father. I don't know what happened\nnow that I am--I don't think the churches are overrun in Vienna.\nInterviewer: No, no, only by tourists.\nEmmi Lehner: Only by tourists and they only want to look at it because they are old and they are\nbeautiful. Vienna is beautiful, there's nothing to say about it but I have no feeling toward it, not to--.\nInterviewer: And the other cities aren't bad. Graz. Salzburg--\nEmmi Lehner: Salzburg is beautiful, beautiful. You know, the first time after 25 years, after I was away\nfor 25 years, and I came to Vienna. My parents stayed in Graz because my mother's mother died there and\nshe left the apartment to them. I was there with the children and I tell you I was impressed. I had never\nseen Graz before. Very impressed, very nice. Salzburg is special nice but it's a tourist town. Graz is not a\ntourist town.\nInterviewer: No, which is one reason why I like it.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, have you been in Graz?\nInterviewer: Yes. I've been to --.\nEmmi Lehner: How come you didn't go to Vienna?\nInterviewer: I've been to Vienna. Oh, yeah, I've been to Vienna several times.\nEmmi Lehner: Did you see the Imperial Hotel?\nInterviewer: | can't say I've been inside, no.\nEmmi Lehner: You should have seen it inside because the staircase goes up and the pictures there--.\nInterviewer: I went to the Hofburg and the Schronbrunn and the Belvedere but--\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, very nice. I lived out there. We lived with my grandmother when I was very small,\nright after my father was killed, we lived there. My mother went back home and we lived and every day I\nwas- I loved animals, I used to go there every day when I was little at my grandmother's. I loved it, it's\nreally beautiful there. I have to say the outskirts of Vienna and all that, it's very beautiful. But it is not\nnow because of this--you know, there's a lot of foreigners walk around there, speak different languages.\nHard to- can't stand it.\nInterviewer: Well, in that way, it's a lot like New York.\nEmmi Lehner: But New York is still America. You know, it's--I don't know. I love New York myself. I\nlived there six months and I loved it but I wouldn't like to live there. I prefer to live here. You should\ncome one day to Miami and I take you around. It's beautiful.\nInterviewer: My brother lived there for a couple of years. He went to med school in Miami.",
        "Emmi Lehner: Yes, well I think it is very nice. It's very bad everywhere, you know, because of the crime\nand all that. I go to the big hospital where I have--Peter in now. I'm so scared to drive there, I can't tell\nyou because there are--when you cross northwest, northeast to northwest, all black and when they are\ngoing like you see on television, one of our anchorwoman, with a gentleman, was attacked.\nInterviewer: | didn't know that.\nEmmi Lehner: They broke the window and they were cut. They were in the middle and there were cars\nright, left back and front. They broke that window and hit them, hit her in the eye. She was very lucky\nthat she saved her eye but they took the purse. You see, people leave their purse on the other side. My car\ndoesn't have air-conditioning, I have to have it prepared. I have to have windows open, very little but it is\nso hot here in Miami; yesterday 96, I thought that I would die. The weather has changed greatly. We had\nso much rain before but apparently the pollution and all that is affecting the air right now. It is really hot\nhere, not the way to come here. Trudy was only here two days, unfortunately. I can't wait until she comes\nback.\nInterviewer: Well, in two weeks, three weeks.\nEmmi Lehner: We talk on the phone a lot.\nInterviewer: I just want to check now that I have the right spelling. Helli, H e-l-e-n-e and then Melani,\nthe middle name, Me-l-a-n-1 and then Lebel; there's an accent ---\nEmmi Lehner: L-e-b- and the last e-I--\nInterviewer: Accent grave, right?\nEmmi Lehner: People say always Lebel, you know. It is Lebel.\nInterviewer: Then Hellie is H-e-l-l-y.\nEmmi Lehner: No, no \"y\".\nInterviewer: No, no \"y\"?\nEmmi Lehner: H-e-l-e-n. Her name is Helen.\nInterviewer: No, I'm talking Hellie. When--\nEmmi Lehner: Oh, we call her--my nickname was Emmi and my real name is Emma.\nInterviewer: Right.\nEmmi Lehner: Helli was Helen like your name here, Helen. Same name but we Called her Helli. Called\nher H-e-I-]-1.\nInterviewer: \"1\"?\nEmmi Lehner: \"i\", not \"y\". Just like my Emmi is \"1\".\nInterviewer: Okay. Cause I had an envelope here and it said Helly Angelegenheit and it had a \"y\" on\nthere.\nEmmi Lehner: Yeah, then she misspelled it. Her birth certificate is Helene. Melani, we both have the\nsame middle name. Trudy's mother was called that name.",
        "Interviewer: Yes, and then, let's see. Photos, I have, as I said, we have the copy of Helli with Lydi.\nEmmi Lehner: Yes, I have the same thing.\nInterviewer: That's the photo that we'll use on the ID card.\nEmmi Lehner: The only other picture I have of Helli is at my wedding. She was at the wedding.\nInterviewer: A group shot?\nEmmi Lehner: A group shot. Helli is on there. She was just out six months when it started again.\nInterviewer: Okay, I thank you very much.\nEmmi Lehner: Thank you very much for taking the time and all that. I appreciate it very much. Thank\nyou so much and I hope I see you when I come to Washington.\nInterviewer: Yes, I look forward to it.\nEmmi Lehner: Okay.\nInterviewer: Goodbye and good luck.\nEmmi Lehner: Thank you.\nInterviewer: Bye.",
