        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski, conducted by Katie Davis, on September\nvideotaped interview, conducted with Stefan Czyzewski, April 8th, 1998. The United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for\nmaking this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Good morning.",
        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "Q: I wonder if we can begin with you just stating your name and telling us whether or\nnot you ever spelled it differently?",
        "A: Yes. My name is Stefan Czyzewski and I never spelled it differently, except for\nduration of 1941 to \u201845, I carried a different last name and I was a-at that time, I was\nStefan Grot, G-r-o-t. And reason for change, that none of us in the -- in my fighting\ngroup carried his own name. In most cases, we just had one word pseudonym --\npseudoname. In my case, I carried a full name, but my last name was different from\nthe original.",
        "Q: Before we get to your work in your fighting group in your resistance, during the\nwar, I\u2019ve heard that your father hid a Jewish family, or hid Jews and I wonder if you\ncan tell us that?",
        "A: Yes, we -- my father hid a friend, whose name was Ithzac Visipka and his two\nchildren. One was about eight, one was about 11, a boy and a girl. And the tragedy of\nmy father\u2019s life was that they were killed, very close to the end of the war. During one\nof the pacifications, Mr. Visipka just couldn\u2019t stand it, sitting in hiding, so he took off\nand ran and was caught in a field -- in open field by pacification squad, the German SS\ngroup and he was killed and his children were killed. And the bad part of it 1s, too, that\nthey were shot only once and wer -- they were dying for a long, long time. They\nrefused to shoot them second time. And of course, later on, they came and took my\nfather. Somebody apparently reported and my father, he had to dig a grave for them\nand bury them. And they also were going to shoot my father -- father, with them, but\nmy father was a foxy old man, so before he went there, he went into a closet, he pulled\nours -- out his Isen cross that the Germans gave him in the first World War, pinned it\nup on his jacket and dug the hole. After he buried this -- I mean, after he laid these\npeople in, he even put his jacket over their faces. And they said, \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\nSo he turned around and said, \u201cDo you want to kill a German hero?\u201d So they looked,\nand he had a -- his citation with him, in his pocket. They read the citation and said,\n\u201cOld man, you escaped this time. Don\u2019t let that happen again.\u201d And they let him go.",
        "Q: Can you tell us how your father came to hide them? What were the circumstances\nthat led to this? Did -- did they --",
        "A: Was very -- very simple. Everybody -- just about everybody I knew was hiding a\nJewish person or two or three. Just about everybody in our -- in our village -- in our\nvillage of 52 household, we had probably 20 or 30 Jewish people being hidden. Some\nsurvived, some did not. One person that we hid, did survive. She was a young Jewish\nwoman and she did survive. Later on she served in the Polish government. I don\u2019t -- I\nknow her name was Maria, but I don\u2019t re -- know her -- never knew her last name. She\nwas a friend of Mr. Jebbe, who was a tailor, who was also with us for some time, but\nhe was killed during one of the pacifications.",
        "Q: So this hiding occurred in Leshganorra, your village?",
        "A: Leshnagorra, yes.",
        "Q: Do you know when it began, the hiding of th-the father and the two children?",
        "A: It began in late 1941, when the ghettos were established. Mr. Visipka\u2019s wife\ndecided not to go in hiding. She decided to go to the ghe -- stay in ghetto and she even\ndecided to go to the Warsaw ghetto, where she perished, apparently. But Mr. Visipka\ndid not want to stay in ghetto, since he was used to roaming the villages. Before the\nwar, he carried bundle for his mother, Golda, who was a peddler and he knew\neverybody and everybody knew Mr. Visipka. So he thought that he would survive\namong the Polish people.",
        "Q: Do you know if he came to your father and asked him, or if your father offered?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think he ever asked. He came one night and father -- he -- we talk and he --\nfather and he talked and father found him a place to hide and when I came back from\nthe Middle East, in fall of 1941, I made Mr. Visipka a good hiding place. And he\nstayed there forever and a day.",
        "Q: So you made the hiding place? How did you do it, tell us?",
        "A: There was an big attic, huge, huge attic above the cow barn. And the attic was full\nof straw, bundles of straw. So, I made a little trap door in a ceiling of the barn and I\nmade a chamber among the straw above that trap door. It was nice and warm. It was\nstinky, of course, but who cared about stink at that time? And Mr. Visipka stayed\nthere, on and off. He would go places. He -- we would go to work in a field for some\nof the farmers who had so-called farms on outskirts. He could not work on our farm,\nbecause our farm was within a village and too many people would have seen him. So\nhe went to work for people who -- who were all alone somewhere on the side of -- on\nthe edge of the forest. And he would stay and work with them. Then they will come\nback, he will get -- bring some food. And of course, food was never short in our place,\nso he didn\u2019t have to worry about that.",
        "Q: Were you there when he was discovered and killed?",
        "A: No, I was not. I was with my fighting unit. But I heard story after I came back. My\nfather wouldn\u2019t talk, but some people talked.",
        "Q: You father wouldn\u2019t talk about it?",
        "A: No. He felt very bad about it. And we had a -- we had all kind of moments. Funny\nmoments, laughing moments, was horribly scared. We were worrying. There was one\nmoment -- we were notified by somebody who knew about the pacification squad\ncoming in, so we told Mr. Visipka, \u201cGet in and stay there and don\u2019t peek out.\u201d Well,\nMr. Visipka left his children. He couldn\u2019t stand it, he ran away. Later on he said, \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t want to be found and have all of you killed.\u201d So he came back next -- next day,\nwet, muddy, cold. And he said, \u201cNo panyan. I had three lucks. The first luck was the\nGerman didn\u2019t kill me. The second luck wa -- luck was, your dog didn\u2019t eat me.\u201d We\nhad a big, big dog. \u201cAnd the third luck was, I didn\u2019t drown in the mud.\u201d He ran into\nthe forest, just about 200 feet from our barn and hid in the mud there. He said, \u201cThe\nthird -- third luck was, I did not drown in the mud.\u201d",
        "Q: An-and -- and the woman, Maria, who stayed with you, was she staying at the same\ntime and where was she staying?",
        "A: She was staying just about the same time and even before and after. She did not\nstay with us permanently, but she would come and stay for a week or two and then she\nwould go her own way. We didn\u2019t want to know where she went and she didn\u2019t want\nto tell us where she went. She apparently had many places to stay. And after the war,\nshe worked for the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Minz, in the Polish government. And\nshe was twice, I think, instrumental in saving my father from the Communists.",
        "Q: What do you -- what do you know about that? Can you tell us anything about that?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know very much, because I wasn\u2019t there, but later on my sister brought me\nthere. They wanted my father to join the collective and he said, \u201cDamn you, forget it.\u201d\nSo, they had a local Communist who was forcing and encouraging everybody to join\nthe collective, give the farm away. So my father went and threaten him, so they ha-had\nhim arrested and beat him up and of course, Maria came and saved him. And a couple\nweeks later, somebody went out at night and shot up the house of the person who was\nforcing everybody into it, and I know who that was. My father was a [indecipherable]\nwas short-tempered. He has a gun, he had a machine gun. He could do almost\nanything, within reason.",
        "Q: Your father did that?",
        "A: Yes, of course. Of course, he was arrested immediately after that. But he was\nreleased and the police -- for their pains, the local militia almost got executed by the\nSoviet general.",
        "Q: Why did they almost get executed?",
        "A: Well, during the war, there was a dirty old -- dirty old, well, he was -- looked old,\nhe was in his probably late 20\u2019s or early 30\u2019s -- Russian hiding with us for man -- I\nmean, for weeks and months, at times. And my father spoke Russian very well,\nbecause he served in south imperial army, and they became friends, and that Ivan, as\nwe called him, came and went. After the war, we discovered that he led all the\nCommunist partisans in our territory and he was sa -- and he was a general in charge\nof an Russian pantzer division in a town of Minsk, which was about 10 - 15 miles\nfrom our farm. So, when my father was arrested second time, my sister went and tried\nto talk to the man in charge in Minsk. And of course, they wouldn\u2019t let her talk to him,\nbut eventually she prevailed. She just sat down and wouldn\u2019t move and talked to Ivan\nIvanovitch. I don\u2019t know if it was his real name or not. He came storming in, in an\narmy car with two soldiers and a -- and a driver and he came to the county village. He\ntook the police, put them against the wall and ta -- got my father out of jail and said,\n\u201cYanna, do you want to shoot those son of a bitches?\u201d And father said, \u201cOh, no, they\ndo their work. But they beat me up, so I want to hit them few times.\u201d So, he hit them\nfew times. And they were warned, they were told, \u201cIf you ever happen -- anything\nhappens to John ever, I\u20191l come and shoot you, you [indecipherable] and so and so.\u201d",
        "Q: So there was a lot going on at your house.",
        "A: Well, of course. We had a lively life.",
        "Q: I-It was -- it seems that it was a safe house for at least two Jewish families -- well,\none family, one woman, and then a Communist partisan, who happened to turn out to\nbe an important leader?",
        "A: Yes, it was. Of course, there were other people who came in and out, hiding. People\nfrom the Polish underground, some of my boys who were hurt, who were shot, stayed\nfor a few days, couple weeks. As you -- as I mentioned previously, I think my mother -\n- my mother, my grandmother, was a witch doctor. She had weeds, she -- she -- she\nhad herbs, she had all kind of stuff and she could cure almost anybody out of anything.\nShe couldn\u2019t grow legs or arms, but she could do almost anything else. So we had\nmany wounded partisans come and stay and hide.",
        "Q: So, if something happened in your fighting group and someone was injured, you\nwould e -- you might take them to your house or tell them how to get there?",
        "A: Yes, we did.",
        "Q: And then where would they actually stay, in the house?",
        "A: Oh, we had a small closet, we had a kind of a storeroom. Course we had a barn\nwith all kind of hid-hid-hiding places, they could stay there, too.",
        "Q: And the word never got around that this house of the Czyzewski\u2019s was a house\nwhere there were many partisans in and out and --",
        "A: Well, the wor --",
        "Q: Jews hiding and --",
        "A: -- the words got around and we had many visits from the Schultz Politsi, even\npeople from the Einsatzgruppen came to visit few times. They beat my father,\noccasionally. But never shot -- never killed him.",
        "Q: Did your father or your sisters ever talk about feeling afraid during this times?",
        "A: Yes, they were. They were shitty scared at times.",
        "Q: How did they tell you that?",
        "A: Oh yes, we\u2019re afraid, we shook. We cried, we yelled a lot wh-when they hit us. So\nthey just left us alone and went away.",
        "Q: Your sisters were hit, also?",
        "A: My sisters were hit also, especially my younger sister, who would te -- who would -\n- who was outspoken.",
        "Q: I'd like to turn now, to fill in some gaps, turn now to your training as a -- as an\nunderground fighter. And I\u2019m talking about the period -- the six month period where\nyou left Siberia and then you walked in to Iran. And I\u2019m wondering if we could talk a\nlittle bit about that. What did the camp actually look like when you finally got there?",
        "A: It was a tent city, close to Teheran, out in the desert. There was cold at night, there\nwas hot during the day. The hamsen blew occasionally. The sto -- sandstorm blew\noccasionally. And the British fished out a small group of people and since my whole\nlife practically went by seventeens, there were 17 young Polish boys and there was a\nBritish -- Commander Thompson, we called him. He went -- he ran the guts out of us.\nWe went on long marches, with heavy loads. We went infiltrate and exfiltrating from\nobjects -- military objects -- camps.",
        "Q: What do you mean by that, infiltrating?",
        "A: Sneaking in and sneaking out, without being caught.",
        "Q: For instance, how would he have you do that, in a training exercise?",
        "A: We would burrow under the wires. The camp had wi -- barbed wire round. We\nwould get in, we would steal things to te -- to s -- to tell that we were in. And the camp\nguards, who had put an especial -- they were receive special efforts that somebody 1s\ngoing to infiltrate here and we were caught couple times, but we were caught about twi\n-- two out of 10 times. Most of the time we were lucky to get in and get out without\nbeing caught.",
        "Q: So you would be outside the camp and you would have a mission to sneak in, steal\nsomething and sneak back out?",
        "A: Yes. And at times we just went in carrying nothing and times we came -- we went\nin carrying arms. At times we went in carrying heavy loads, in preparation for later\ntimes, when we had to carry explosives, things. And we went on long marches, we\nwent on a -- we took in a -- took part in a firefights. We took part in firefights being\nsurrounded by superior forces. And that really helped us later on, when I came back to\nPoland.",
        "Q: What -- what strategies were you learning in those exercises? What do you do when\nyou\u2019re surrounded by superior forces?",
        "A: You divide your group in two or three subgroups. And one groups opens heavy fire\nwhen the -- the other group proceeds ahead of it. Then this -- then the group that went\nahead of you opens heavy fire and you catch up with it. And then in -- both of you\nopen heavy fire in every direction when the third lit -- group comes to you. And for a\ntime we made efforts not to get surrounded by the Einsatzgruppen that we went to\nfight. Later on, when we -- when we received our good armament, especially after we\nbought whole lot of -- after we bought a whole lot of Schmizers from a German supply\nofficers, were so heavily armed, that the Germans had no chance with us, whatsoever.\nAs I mentioned in my previous interview, the 75 to 120 people in a German\nEinsatzgruppen would have four automatic weapons and rest would be manual rifles.\nMy group of 17 plus two, carried 27 Schmizers, because 10 of my boys did not trust\nthe damn German weapon, they wanted to have two. So, we had a su-surplus of it, so\neach of them carried two. And we had such a enormous firepower that he, on purpose\nwanted to be surrounded so we could get into fire -- a real firefight and get out of it\nand well, knock out more people than we normally would have.",
        "Q: In the training sessions though, what kind of ammunition were you firing? Was it\nlive or blank?",
        "A: We always used live ammunition. Work it -- were -- were wounded sometime, but\nit was realistic, we always used live ammunition. If you stuck your neck -- head too\nfar, you got hit. So you don\u2019t. You keep your head down.",
        "Q: Did anyone ever get killed in training?",
        "A: Yes. I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "Q: You mentioned that when you first got there, there was a period of indoctrination,\npsychological or philosophical. What -- what -- what were you learning in that period -",
        "A: Was it in --",
        "Q: -- from the British?",
        "A: -- 1n a Soviet camp, or in --",
        "Q: Not in the Soviet camp --",
        "A: -- in British.",
        "Q: -- in the British camp, when you were being indoctrinated to become an\nunderground fighter. What was the philosophy that you were being taught?",
        "A: Well the -- first of all, the British wanted to re-brainwash us after we had been\nbrainwashed by the Communists, which didn\u2019t take very long. And later on, we had\nBritish and we had Polish office -- political officers coming and talking to us, invoking\ngreat Polish patriotism, which was unnecessary. We were too patriotic as it was. As a\nmatter of fact, we were chauvinistic. But mostly it was the philosophy of hitting back,\nphilosophy of saving people. Philosophy of making the Europe free of the Nazi\nscourge.",
        "Q: And was there any talk in this indoctrination period of what -- of what else you\nwere fighting for? What was the end goal in terms of Poland?",
        "A: The end goal of -- was a free -- or free Poland. Independent, free Poland. It turned\notherwise, but we really wanted to fight for the free, independent Poland.",
        "Q: And wa -- was the training camp allied with any of the underground movements? In\nother words, you were training in -- in Iran. Were they telling you, we want you to\nconnect, when you get back to Poland, with one of these specific underground armies?",
        "A: It was suggested, but it was not told to. When we came back, the most powerful\ngroup was the ZWZ and we joined it for a time. Then, that was evolving into the home\narmy, the AK. And also in the NSZ, the nationals armed forces. So some of us -- some\nof us were given groups of fighters from either AK or NSZ and in my case, my\nsympathies were with -- were with NSZ and they gave me -- supplied me with some\nammunitions, some arms, some explosives and gave me 17 people, plus two. That was\nthat ti --",
        "Q: You were going to say, I think you were saying it was a right wing?",
        "A: It was a right wing Polish underground.",
        "Q: And I want to talk more about that, but I just want to get clear on one thing. When\nyou say that it was suggested that you make a connection to a certain group, what --\nwhat were your leaders in the British training camp? Which group were they guiding\nyou towards?",
        "A: The -- not the British, but the Polish political officers were guiding us toward the\npresent and the future home army, because the home army was under jurisdiction of\nthe Polish government in exile in Great Britain.",
        "Q: And how would they suggest? What would they say?",
        "A: Well, they would -- they would talk a lot about it. This is probably the best middle\nof the way group. They don\u2019t discriminate against anybody and they don\u2019t fight --\nfight any other group, they even tolerate the Socialist, Communists. And this is\nprobably the future of Poland, we will have to live with that, Soviet Russia. And this\nprobab -- this government probably will be the most likely to survive and continue.\nAnd we were told -- also told -- we were warned against my future, NSZ, those people\nhave no future because the Soviet Russia will never allow it -- them to exist. But, of\ncourse, if you are 17 and 18, you don\u2019t believe it, you are omnipotent.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning of Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Muse-Museum\ninterview with Stefan Czyzewski and this is tape number one, side B. If you could just\ntell us a little bit more about your personal allegiance to the underground group that --\nthat you chose, the NSZ?",
        "A: They just happens -- happened almost by happenstance. They were in ma -- ina\nneighborhood where I was. I was available, they were receptive. The AK, the army\nakaioba already had a group like mine from that neighborhood. They took one of my\nfriends who came with me, as a leader. And the NSZ people had better armament that\nthey could provide us with and also they were very much against the Soviet Union.\nThey hated the damn Communists. And of course, after spe -- having spent a year in a\nSoviet prison camp, I didn\u2019t like them much either. So, that was probably kind of a\ncombination of reasons why I did join the NSZ.",
        "Q: And as you\u2019ve described and y-y-you described them sometimes as right wing and\nin fact, in some cases, they were known for being very anti-Semitic. What were your\nthoughts about that?",
        "A: That was probably the only aspect that I didn\u2019t cherish. Also, in my very\nneighborhood, in my very group, we were not. As I previously mentioned, I had two\npeople in my group who survived the whole schmier. Out of the four, who are left out\nof the 20, two of them were Jewish boys. Isaac One and Isaac Two. And we had -- I\nhave known another probably half a dozen Jewish young men who were in a group.\nSome even were in a command. So even though the NSZ was at times quite anti-\nSemitic, everybody had a Jew he liked. And he wou -- whom he would protect and\nsave and wanted him to come and fight with him.",
        "Q: Tell us, how did the group express it\u2019s anti-Semitism, if in fact, sometimes Jews\nwere in the group? How was it expressed, the anti-Semitism?",
        "A: In most cases -- in my group, we never talked about it. We -- our talk was always\nhow to hit the da-damn -- damn Germans and hora and whit and how to be most\neffective. And my two Jewish boys had con -- had connection with people in a ghetto -\n- in neighboring ghettos 1n two or three towns and had some conva -- kind of a\nuncanny ability or foresight. If we wanted sometime to go one way, they would -- one\nof them would say, \u201cWalcheem, no we don\u2019t want to go that way, we want to go\naround.\u201d So we went around and we discovered later on if we went that way, we\nwould have gotten knocked out. So it was more on a personal level than on a\nideological level. They trusted you, you trusted them. And sometime you trusted them\nmore than you tru-trusted your -- your -- your own Polack in your group. It was mostly\npersonal and we hardly ever talked ideology during our fights, during our existence --\nthroughout our existence.",
        "Q: I want to go back a little bit, to the training camp. You have told us about how you\nlearned how to infiltrate. How did you learn how to -- for instance, to do certain acts of\nsabotage, how did you practice them? Perhaps derailing a train, if you could explain to\nus how they gave you that training?",
        "A: The sabotage part of it was probably the most extens-extensive and took the longest\ntime. They taught us techniques -- how to use old dynamite, which was the only\nexplosive that we could fi -- get in Poland for a long, long time. And how to build that\nplate -- carry and put metal plate on the -- under the explosives, under the rail. They\ntaught us, if they -- we did not have explosives, they tol -- they trained us how to\nloosen up a rail to detrain a train. But in most cases, the most effective would have\nbeen explosives. They told us how to use batteries and since we did not have good\nequipment, we -- you just hung up to two little wires in your hand. Your hand shook\nand you wondered if y -- if you are going to blow the damn thing on time or after the\ntrain went by, which sometime it happened. My commander was mad at me at ev --\nevery time I missed that thing, he wanted to court martial and we -- he threatened to\nput me against the wall and shoot me if I missed. But of course, later on he told me, \u201cI\nwould never shoot you, because you are useful. You are a good tool.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t\nknow if I was a good tool or not, but I tried my darnest. They told us how to attach\nexplosive to doors or to gates or to the brick wall. How to remove a brick from a brick\nwall, surrounding an object or how to dig out quickly, break out of a brick building\nand put explosives in it. And how to stretch the wire, how to use -- how to use fuse.\nHow long each fuse would burn -- how many feet per minute it would burn. How\nmany meters per a minute it would burn. How far you had to be from an objective if\nyou blow it up. Which side of the object you were blowing up, you were supposed to\nbe on, if possible. If it\u2019s not possible, how to hide, what to hide 1n, how to best hide.\nThe best pla -- best place to hide was to dig a foxhole. You didn\u2019t have time to dig the\nfoxhole, so you hi -- you were kind of in a halfway quandary and great excitement and\nbeing scared and being perplexed. And strange enough, I can\u2019t believe it, but most of\nthe times, perhaps seven out of 10, maybe eight, sometime nine out of 10, we were\nlucky and effective.",
        "Q: Were you often, when you did go through with an action and blow something up,\nwere you often within hearing distance of it?",
        "A: We were always within hearing distance. Sometime we were within -- within a\nharm distance of it, except that if you put yourself behind a big stone or in a small\nditch or behind another wall, you were not harmed. But sometime you were. I had\nbricks -- brick wall fall on me. The object was probably 200 feet from where I was,\nthat blown up and I was hiding behind a good brick wall that turned out not to be a\ngreat brick wall, because if fell apart and I got knocked out, practically.",
        "Q: You had said in your prior interview that the Polish and the British commanders\nchose you the best of the best. When they said you were ready, was it clear -- what did\nthey tell you and were they putting you, Stefan Czyzewski up as a commander that\nwhen you got into Poland, you would command a unit, was that clear?",
        "A: That was clear, but I don\u2019t think I mentioned it to [indecipherable] of the best.\nThose 17 of us, all of us were the best. And we ca -- we were sent back to Poland with\nan understanding that when we reached there, we are the only people who are trained\nand we automatically would assume command of small wet works groups.",
        "Q: That is what I meant --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: -- that the group was the best of the best.",
        "A: The groups a -- wa -- the -- was the best of the best.",
        "Q: So that you were, in essence, an elite group who had had more training than most,\nso that you could go back and then lead 17 other, smaller groups?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right. Yes, we -- we -- later on we did train some people in Poland, back\nin, especially after some of us got killed. We didn\u2019t want to run out of people who\nknew enough. But resources were skimpy. The territory was not always safe. So we\nhad a difficult time training more people in Poland in the system that the British\ndeveloped for us.",
        "Q: Now, I know you\u2019ve told us the story of how you got back into Poland and your\ncrossing water, and the boat. Did you have ins -- what were your instructions once you\ngot into Poland? Where were you supposed to go? How were you supposed to know\nwhere to be?",
        "A: We were told to disperse and since we -- individuals who are from a different part\nof a country were told they -- to go into your own territory where you know people,\nwhere people know you. Perhaps close to where your family is and search out\nunderground groups and join them and tell them who you are and what you can do.",
        "Q: So tell us how you did that when you got back near to -- to Leshnagorra, your\nhometown, how did you do that?",
        "A: Yes, I came to my hometown, I joined my family, I stayed with them and my\nfriends from the original -- original group, the OP, the defenders of Poland, which was\nalready incorporate into ZWZ, appro -- came to talk to me within probably two days\nafter I came back and say, \u201cHey, [indecipherable] want to rejoin?\u201d \u201cWell, tell me who\nand horah.\u201d So we had a few meetings with local people and then we went to meetings\nwith the so-called overall command and we identified -- I mean, I was the only one, I\nidentified myself and told them what I could do. And if they had any -- had a job for\nme, all right, if not I will find somebody to join me. And of course, they accepted me. I\nwent through interrogation. They, at that beginning did not trust me, but eventually we\ndeveloped affinity. And after I told them what I went through and identified places\nwhere I was and the training I went through, then they tested me. They gave me -- I\njoined a small fighting group who went on a few jobs. And I became an advisor to the\nyoung man who ran -- who led that group. And about -- within -- probably within two\nmonths, they gave me my own group and I became completely independent from\neverybody. I had supervision. I had a commander of the district to whom I reported\nand who collected information on what we did and who would provide us with places\nto hit. And that was on and on and on and on, until 1944.",
        "Q: What was your attitude when you first got back? You had all this training. Were\nyou very eager to get going right away and for people to recognize that you knew how\nto do this? What was your attitude about the process of being accepted?",
        "A: Yes. Well, first of all, I was cautious. I didn\u2019t know who was who and who might\nbe working for the Germans. After I discovered that nobody was working for the\nGermans, except those who openly were Bolstoitch people, a supervisor or those who\nran the county or those who collected taxes and those who collected food and items for\nthe Germans. Then I was eager to join whoever I could, to join to go and fight. I\nwanted to -- I mean, I was bragging about no end, I told 10 times more than I knew. I\nnever unlearned to exaggerate. I still don\u2019t know how not to exaggerate. So what I say,\nsometime, you should take with a big handful of salt, because 1t may be exaggeration.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about actually being back home. Wasn\u2019t it unusual for a -- a\nyoung Polish man to be home? In other words, wasn\u2019t it suspicious that you had been\naway and wouldn\u2019t that call attention to you, possibly as being an underground\nperson? I\u2019m wondering if you can explain the atmosphere to us. Could you, as a young\nPolish man, just walk around normally, or did it -- that raise questions for the\nGermans?",
        "A: Well, th-they --",
        "Q: And make you --",
        "A: -- they did not -- the Germans did not have a close supervision over a countryside.\nOurs was a small village, as I mentioned previously, 52 household, built along the --\none long street and everybody knew everybody and most of the people were very\npatriotic. There were some people there who were members of the home army. There\nwere some people who were members -- I mean, young boy -- young men who are\nmembers of the NSZ. We\u2019ve only had two people in our district, one from my village\nand one from a distant village, who were members of the AL, the Communist partisan\nunderground. Two, a whole two out of about 25,000.",
        "Q: So did you carry false documents? Did you have some sort of cover of what you\ndid?",
        "A: No, at that time -- at that time, I did not carry false documents. Before I came --\nbefore I came, every Polish person would receive a so-called cancarity -- a document\nwith your picture on it. You live here, you a farmer, you are this, you are that and if\nyou wa -- if you go anyplace, you had to carry this with you. So when I came back, a\nfriendly person in an administration, made the cancarta for me with a pre-date, so I\nwas just somebody who was here all the time, never left, never was any quar -- just a\nyoung peasant, living in a small village. Not exactly illiterate, but not exactly bright.\nAnd one who brags a lot and one who likes girls and goes to dances and go places and\nworks hard on the farm. And of course, shortly after that, somebody apparently was\nreporting and the German police would come and look for me and of course, they\nnever -- I was never in and they kept coming and pushing my father around. He said,\n\u201cWhen you came first time here, he got scared of you so badly, he just ran away, never\nshowed up again. I don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d So they would beat up my father slightly,\nnot badly. I mean, they didn\u2019t break his bones, but they would make him black and\nblue and let be at it. And that was the duration. I would come for a visit occasionally,\ntalk to my father and he would say a few things and he said, \u201cOkay, you can go back,\ngive them hell.\u201d That was -- kind of a -- became everyday life. Like a life ina\nconcentration camp -- in a death camp became everyday life -- normal everyday life,\nthat also became normal, everyday life.",
        "Q: Did you have a small bag of things that you always carried with you, since you\nwere on the move so much?",
        "A: Yes, I had a backpack. I carried my stuff with me.",
        "Q: And do you remember what was in that?",
        "A: One pair of underwear, one pair of socks. And of course I had my Schmizer with\nme. I also had a good American six shooter. I cherished it, because it was so\ndependable. In a short encount -- in a -- in a close encounter, that was the best.",
        "Q: Do you remember the make of the gun? The six shooter?",
        "A: Actually, it was a ru -- it was a Russian nagant, n-a-g-a-n-t, but it was built like an\nAmerican western six shooter.",
        "Q: So you had a German weapon and a Russian weapon.",
        "A: Russian weapon, I had the Russian nagant, and Russian nagant, you could bury it in\nthe mud, pull it out and it would not malfunction.",
        "Q: Do you remember it -- what else was in that knapsack -- the little rucksack?",
        "A: Well, I carried couple books to read and I -- well, I had a towel, I had a piece of\nsoap. I had a razor -- straight razor, which served as a razor and a couple times I used\nit on somebody else.",
        "Q: As a weapon\u2019?",
        "A: Of course, yes. I was in couple close encounters and I used my razor.",
        "Q: Do you want to tell us about that?",
        "A: Oh, I had it handy, I had it in my breast pocket. Had a little pocket sewed up in my\njacket and I had it always ready. Yes, the SS man that met me once on a dark street\nand tried to identify me and pulled out a gun.",
        "Q: Where was that?",
        "A: It was in Shedilsan, little town of Shedilsan, nearby -- oh, probably 30 miles from --\nfrom my -- my -- from my village.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your -- a little bit more about your commander?\nThis is B dad --",
        "A: The o -- dom -- Be Dom.",
        "Q: Be-Be Dom, the old oak.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How often did you see him?",
        "A: I would see him every six weeks, every eight weeks. Sometime every two weeks.\nAnd I would get a -- it was a grapevine, \u201cHey, you are supposed to see -- go the Be\nDom.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cWell, you go that place, or that farm or that village. Go to that\nhouse.\u201d I would go to that place and there would be somebody waiting for me. He\nsaid, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go home.\u201d So I would be taken to wherever he was, not the place\nwhere I was supposed to go first. And we\u2019d have a talk and I would hand in my report\nfor the last two or three, four weeks, five weeks. He would give me one or two or three\nassignments and he would alway say, \u201cIf possible. Do it if possible, but you better.\u201d",
        "Q: Di -- were they written reports that you gave in, or verbal?",
        "A: Verbal. I wo -- they would be written. I would read them several times and I could\neven carry them for a day, but I would -- to destroy them, I would eat them most of the\ntime.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit more about him -- be -- as a commander, sometimes hearing you\ntalk about him, he was very harsh on you. What was your feeling towards him, or you\njust --",
        "A: I felt toward him like my grandfather. He was very harsh, he was foul mouthed.\nOh, could he swear. He was almost as bad as a -- as a good Albanian. Good Albanian\ncan swear for 15 minutes and not repeat himself. Mr. Dom, I don\u2019t know how long he\ncould swear without repeating himself, but could he swear. And he would call me\nnames and he would call -- call me horrible names and he was threaten me with\nexecution every second time we met and then after we -- when we parted, he would\ngive me a hug and we both cry.",
        "Q: How long was he your commander\u2019?",
        "A: The duration. From the fall of 1941, until spring of 1944.",
        "Q: Did you ever meet him again?",
        "A: No. Never met him. Never knew who -- who he was. Never heard of him again.",
        "Q: Did you ask about him among friends?",
        "A: I asked about him. I asked about him. I don\u2019t know what happened to him, if he\nsurvived, if he didn\u2019t. By the way, he went on wet jobs, too.",
        "Q: He went on your jobs?",
        "A: No, he went --",
        "Q: Oh, went -- wet --",
        "A: -- he -- he went on --",
        "Q: -- wet works?",
        "A: On wet works, also. He was not supposed to. He was not supposed to, he was\ncalled on the carpet several times after he participated 1n -- in a -- 1n action.",
        "Q: Did he tell you why he did?",
        "A: [indecipherable] He said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be completely useless.\u201d",
        "Q: How many actions do you think you were involved in?",
        "A: I can\u2019t count.",
        "Q: It\u2019s that many?",
        "A: Some months, one a week. Sometime twice a week. Sometime once a month.\nSometime once every two months. I couldn\u2019t count. 45 - 50, maybe 60, maybe more.\nMost of it -- most of it I obliterated. Most of them. I recall almost everything, but most\nof my a -- most of our actions blend together and most of them I don\u2019t want to\nremember. They were bad.",
        "Q: Can you say what was bad about them?",
        "A: People mutilated, people wounded and screaming. People with their arms blown\noff. People with their legs blown off. People with belly wounds, spilling out. Some of\nmy people, some of the other people. One thing I know -- only remember, the -- my\nfriend, whom I carried --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Stefan Czyzewski. This is tape number two, side A.",
        "A: Yes, one person I remember -- I think I mentioned him previously. We were\nsurrounded, we were in a -- in a firefight and we were running and I did get hit. The\ntop of my head, I did get practically scalped and he was hit in a side of a head. And of\ncourse, I didn\u2019t know what happened to him, but I grabbed him and I ran with him. I\ndon\u2019t know how far it was, but it was a long distance. And he was about twice as\nheavy as I am -- as I was. And I carried him, his rucksack, his Schmizer. Then I\ndumped him and two of my boys came and I said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get him out of\nhere.\u201d We were out of the immediate danger. I said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s help him.\u201d Man\nsaid, \u201cForget it.\u201d His top of a head was blown off. That I remember quite vividly.",
        "Q: What had you been doing? What was the action that you were doing at that point?",
        "A: We were surrounded. We all -- we were surrounded almost on purpose. We just let\nourself be surrounded, we were trying our tactics with our new weapons. And it\nworked, except --",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: I don\u2019t. I think his name was Roman, but I couldn\u2019t be sure. He wasn\u2019t with us for a\nlong time. He replaced somebody who got killed and -- but he was good and he and I\nbecame friends.",
        "Q: Early on, when you first take your command, you talk -- you talked before about a\nperiod where you lost 11 men in two months and then you describe saying, \u201cLook,\nwe ve got to do some training if we want -- if we want to stop this.\u201d And then you did\ndo training and I\u2019m wondering if you could tell us about what did you do with those\nmen to get them in better shape?",
        "A: We did what we -- what was done to them in Persia, by the British. We went\nthrough all kind of eventualities, being surrounded. We called on a large group of the\nEnerzet and we -- they had places in forests -- camps in forests, so we would infiltrate\ninto the camps and exfiltrate. We would go and blow up objects. We would -- had a\nfirefight with them. Of course, live ammunition and we were lucky, nobody got shot.\nNobody got even scratched. And we would go -- go on forced marches at night. We\nwould walk 10 - 15 - 20 miles with a full pack, 75 pounds. After that, we became\nalmost invincible. We were not losing -- well, we were losing people, but maybe one\nevery two or three months. But not 11 1n two months.",
        "Q: What was your way of being with the -- the other troops that you commanded?\nHow did you get them to do the work they had to do, which was dangerous?",
        "A: Well really, I didn\u2019t command them. I was with them and I told them, \u201cIf you want\nto be effective, imitate me.\u201d And they tried to. I told them, \u201cI just -- either as good or\nas bad as the rest of you, but I know something that you don\u2019t. So, first of all, we will\ntrain,\u201d as we did. \u201cAnd second of all, watch what I am doing, because some things I\ncannot explain.\u201d Which -- some tried, some didn\u2019t. Some were lucky and survived.\nSome were not lucky and did not survive.",
        "Q: Where do you think you got the self-confidence and immense courage it took to do\nmany of these things?",
        "A: I got an e-enormous ego. My ego was 10 times bigger than I was. And regardless\nhow hopeless a time it was, it never was hopeless in my estimation. And I think that\ncourage and bravado is contagious. And courage and bravado -- bravado, that was --\nwe lived upon it for the duration those two and a half years.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about just how you took care of yourself. Where did you sleep?\nHow did you eat and bathe? When did you have time to do these things?",
        "A: Well, we were not as bad as the kirigas people in Siberia, who take a bath every six\nmonths if they have to or not. We did wash in rivers, in streams, in ponds. If we would\nstay in a farm on outskirts of a forest, we would take a hot bath. The family, they\nwould boil a lot of water and put them in a big wooden tub and one by one -- we did\nnot change water, forget it. If we got a big tub of hot water, all 17 of us would take a\nbath. And regardless how dirty the water is, you still can wash in it. We cooked on\nopen fire. We frequently would get a loaf of bread from a farmer here and there. We\nwould get a bottle of milk. Mostly we lived on bread and milk. We would get a good,\ncooked meal in somebody\u2019s farmhouse, maybe once or twice a week. We carried the\ndry bread in our backpacks. That\u2019s what I carried in my backpack, probably two\npounds of dry bread.",
        "Q: At the farmhouse they would feed 17 of you?",
        "A: They would feed 17 of us. Matter of fact, many times when we came to a\nfarmhouse -- when we wanted to visit the farmhouse, the farmer will kill a pig and we\nwould pig out.",
        "Q: Would you pay them or were they offering this as a manner of support?",
        "A: In most cases -- in all cases, they would not accept payment. Sometime we paid.\nMatter of fact, after we highjacked a German bank, we spread money all over the\ncountryside. And to some degree, that was our undoing. We had to move into a\ndifferent territory.",
        "Q: You left a trail.",
        "A: We left a trail. The German -- the Germans were wondering where tho-those marks\nare coming from that these people have in this neighborhood?",
        "Q: You talked about at one point you -- you got a break from your fighting unit and\nyou went somewhere to study psychological warfare, or you -- could you tell us more\nabout that? What -- where did you go and what were you learning?",
        "A: Ina -- there was a course given for Akar and also Enerzet in Warsaw, in apraga\ndistrict. It took about six -- six weeks, four days a week. There were professors from\nPolish -- Warsaw University. There were some propagandas from Polish underground.\nThere was one British man who spoke Polish and nobody could understand him. And\nthey talked a lot. It was mainly given for people who were employ -- I mean, who\nwere publishing Polish underground papers. But they also took some of us -- some of\nthe commanders of small groups in the countryside to go through this, so we would\nknow -- be more conversant what was really going on in Poland -- in the world -- in a -\n- in a war in the west, in a war on the eastern front. And how to act against Germans of\nthis kind and that kind. How to browbeat them, if you could --",
        "Q: There -- they actually had like a day where you talked about browbeating?",
        "A: Browbeating them. How to be --",
        "Q: How would you browbeat someone?",
        "A: -- how to be ornery to them and still don\u2019t get shot.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of the advice they gave you in that?",
        "A: Well, they gave us advices. You talk to a German and he runs the Poles and you tell\nhim, \u201cWhy do you run the Poles down? My grandfather was a German general and I\nam Polish now and a lot of us are de-descendants of a German people. So you watch\nout. A lot of Poles are just like you Germans, sometime even better.\u201d So some of them\nwould accept it. Some of them would rail against you, some of them wou -- might\neven hit you, but in most cases they would listen and said, \u201cUh-huh, yavolt, yavolt,\nyavolt.\u201d",
        "Q: And apparently you learned something about forgery during this time?",
        "A: Yes, I learned how to wash and how to make documents.",
        "Q: How to what?",
        "A: Wash the documents.",
        "Q: Wash the documents.",
        "A: Wash the documents. And how to remake them.",
        "Q: How -- how -- how do y -- can you tell us about that?",
        "A: You use chemicals to -- to get off -- especially if you write something and -- most\nof the documents made there were not typed, but were written in ink. And there was a\nchemical, you can wash the ink out nicely and you can dry it and use another chemical\nto neutralize 1t and then you can write again. Somebody\u2019s else names, somebody\u2019s else\ndata. And I do that after the war in Germany, for people who are escaping from\nPoland, who could not get admitted to the displaced person camp.",
        "Q: You helped make documents so they could get admitted?",
        "A: So they could get admitted into displaced person camps, so they would not be\nvagabonds, staying in -- I mean -- fa -- I mean trying and stealing and robbing and\ndoing things for themselves and getting, eventually, caught -- arrested and sent to jail.",
        "Q: You -- you said at one point in the previous interview, that when you got to the\ncamps, that you could almost describe that experience as mild, compared to your\nexperience in the underground, in terms of the danger and the intensity that you\nexperienced.",
        "A: Yes, the experience getting into the first camp, the Gross-Rosen camp --",
        "Q: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking, I\u2019m asking -- what I\u2019m -- I\u2019m saying 1s that -- you said\nthe camps were almost easy after being in the underground, that the underground was\nso dangerous and hard. And I\u2019m just wondering if -- if you couldn\u2019t say a little more\nabout that.",
        "A: Yes, it were -- in a camp you were not -- before you got to know what was really\ngoing on, you felt almost a relief, because my interrogation after arrest, was very\nintensive. I was badly mistreated. My last few weeks in Polish underground were very\nintense [indecipherable] very dangerous. So, first coming to the camp and getting\nshaved and getting washed and given a uniform and being little chased around,\noccasionally hit, but not badly, did not feel too bad. Eventually, you learned how\nhorrible it was, but it was later -- later on. The first impression was, was not exactly\nsummer camp and a bet -- but better than prison, because you did not sleep, 17 of you,\nin a two person cell, as I did in a prison before, during my interrogation and after my\nsentence. So, first 1t was almost a relief that you were in a place where you could\nalmost survive. Later on you learned otherwise.",
        "Q: What was so intense and difficult about the last few weeks of your underground\ntime?",
        "A: We were very active. We did get into several firefights. We blew up few objects\nthat mis-blew, either blew in our direction or else were mishandled. I was called on the\ncarpet couple of times and threatened with execution, because you messed up the job.\nCombination of all of it can get you down, occasionally. Even the -- I was not as\nrambunctious as I always was, during last few weeks.",
        "Q: Was that a real possibility? Did you feel that your commanders might execute you\nif you did something that they really --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- felt was wrong?",
        "A: Yes, executions happened. I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t think he would, but executions did\nhappen, not only for treason.",
        "Q: Simply for not executing an -- a job correctly sometimes?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Did you think that was a fair method of treatment?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think it was fair, but I thought was -- it was effective. Fairness --\nfairness has nothing to do with it, effectiveness did.",
        "Q: You said that sometimes after you would do an action that everyone\u2019s nerves were\nvery jangled and you needed to just go into the forest and be quiet for a day or two.\nWhat would you do? Where would you go and what would you do as a group to calm\ndown after a very intense action?",
        "A: Some people would be allowed to go and visit with friends and relatives. In most\ncases we just stayed at the group. We were so tightly knit. We would tell jokes, we\nwould get drunk. We would sleep a lot. If we had food, we would eat a lot, would pig\nout completely. Then we would drink again and after about a week or so, was good as\nnew.",
        "Q: Would you ever sing?",
        "A: Of course, oh, we sang a lot. We sang a lot. Polish patriotic song, bawdy songs, just\nabout anything. We even sang Lily Mar -- Lily Marlin. We even sang Soviet songs.\nWe would sing the Internationale.",
        "Q: And would you --",
        "A: You know, the Internationale has a very rousing melody and a -- and great words.",
        "Q: Can you tell us some of the names that you remember of these people that you\nfought with?",
        "A: I knew their pseudo-names. I did not -- well, I knew probably one or two or three\npeople who were from my neighborhood. I knew their first and last names, but in most\ncases, I would simply forget them. We would have our names -- occasionally the\nnames were changed and you would talk to one of them and said, \u201cWhat was your\nname again?\u201d So he would tell you. \u201cThat was your -- your name last week, what\u2019s\nyour name now?\u201d",
        "Q: When you went to relax, did you ever meet other underground groups and were\nthere ever women in any of the other groups, or in your group?",
        "A: Not in our neighborhood, there were no women. We very seldom met other\nunderground groups. Sometime we met with other underground groups to -- to -- to\nmake comparisons, to get information, to tell how to do things. How we do it, how we\n-- do you do it? Can we be more -- may we be more effective if we do it your way?\nMay you be more effective if you do -- do it our way? What are the similarity of\nobjects that we attack? What are the differences? How to approach them better? You\nknow, 40 minds are better than 20 minds. We would argue, we would tell them, \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know a thing. You do it my way, you will survive.\u201d He would tell -- they would\ntell you, \u201cYou don\u2019t know a thing, you do it our way. You lost two people, we didn\u2019t\nlose anybody.\u201d \u201cWell, of course you didn\u2019t lose anybody, because you didn\u2019t do\nanything.\u201d It was a constant bickering. Some of it was serious, some of -- most of it\nwas just jokingly doing things to relieve the tension.",
        "Q: And would this be a group that was part of the NSZ, the same as your overall\ngroup, or just any other?",
        "A: It would be, most of the time, the NSZ people. We would occasionally meet with\nthe Akar people, but only formally and sometime to exchange information. They\nwould frequently tell us -- tell us about certain objects that were too difficult for them.\nSometime we would tell them about certain object were too large for us. They had\nlarger groups -- they could form larger groups quickly, because they were more\nnumerous in this particular neighborhood, so they could form -- occasionally --\noccasionally, but very seldom, we would have a combined operation. But we never\nreally thought much of it, because our tactics were different from their tactics.",
        "Q: How were your tactics different?",
        "A: Our tactics frequently were just a direct attack. Their tactics was go from behind\nand hit and run. Our tactics were mostly, go out, hit and fight. Because if you hit and\nrun, you may wound somebody, you may scare somebody. If you attack and fight,\nwell, you probably will get few. Matter of fact, sometime you get quite a few. So that\nwas our tactics, constantly and my commander Be Dom alway said, \u201cHit fast, hit hard\nand if you have to run, run. But if you don\u2019t have to run, you better not. Stay and\nfight.\u201d",
        "Q: Where were you at the time that the government in exile called for the -- the\nWarsaw uprising by the underground?",
        "A: I was in a concentration camp, yes, by that time. It was in summer of 1944. It was\nmy one, two, three -- it was my fourth month. I was much affect -- I was in Vienna at\nthat time, in a sub-camp of Mauthausen, in Vienna, working in a Ostermunzowerverk,\nbuilding Tiger tanks.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about a friend you had, her -- her name was Nellie and apparently\nshe was a courier?",
        "A: Yes. She was a courier for the Akar and she was lucky. She spent four years\ncarrying stuff. Propaganda, explosives, ammunition. And she made it.",
        "Q: How did you know her?",
        "A: I met Nellie when she was about seven and I was 10. She came as a beautiful,\nyoung, city girl to have a vacation in a small, small village. And I was the peasant boy\nwho met a beautiful princess. And we stayed friends ever after. She would come every\nyear for about month and a half, two months. We would talk, we would go skinny-\ndipping. She would ride my horses and I would listen to her music. She played good\nviolin. When she was about eight, she played very good violin. And she spent her\nlifetime being a musician.",
        "Q: What part of the underground was she attached to?",
        "A: She was attached to the A-Akar -- to the home army.",
        "Q: And can you tell us about seeing her once you were back in Poland as now a -- a\nresistance fighter? When you were back, how did you see her again, or hear of her?",
        "A: Yeah, we met, we met. She was still coming for a vacation. She went -- she was\nstill in grade school. She -- as a matter of fact, she was just finishing grade school and\nshe immediately became a courier. Even when she was in school, she was a courier on\na small scale. Then she was going to underground middle school and we would meet\nin Warsaw when I was there, occasionally. She would occasionally come to our village\nand we were it. We thought we would never forget one another when we grown up\nand the war ends, we\u2019ll surely marry. We knew how many children we\u2019re going to\nhave and everything else. And I really should write to her presently, I know where she\nis. She married after the war, they had one son. Tragically, he died in his mid 30\u2019s.\nAnd both she and her husband played in a symphony orchestra all their lives. They\nretired just recently. Their son was a musician, too. He played in a symphony\norchestra. And at -- I heard -- I have it second or third hand from my first cousin, who\nstarted corresponding with her after I mentioned her once in a letter. And I should\nreally write to her and -- but, you know, it was so many times, so many years. We live\nour own lives. Hate to open the old wounds. But I really ought to write her. She was a\nbeautiful girl and a beautiful person. She had the greatest hair you ever saw. She had\nan enormous amount of hair. When she [indecipherable] she could sit on her hair.",
        "Q: What color?",
        "A: Dark brown.",
        "Q: What did you say to her when you found out that she was carrying documents for\nthe underground? What was your reaction?",
        "A: Well, I said, \u201cMore power to you, but be darn careful.\u201d And, we talked about\nthings. And I had misgivings. I had misgivings about my work, getting so many\nbystanders and so many people who are not real Nazis, killed, mutilated. And we\ntalked about it and she wrote me, saying that, \u201cDon\u2019t feel guilty, because I don\u2019t.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI carry stuff that blows up people and I don\u2019t feel guilty.\u201d\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: How did you eventually come to terms with that, or make peace with that part of\nwhat you did?",
        "A: For a long time, I did not. I had many, many sleepless nights. My conscience was\nreally upset that so many people who did not have to die, did. So many people who did\nnot have to be mutilated, did. Both on my side, on the -- on the other side. But\neventually, time heals. And I still feel somewhat guilty. I have twinges of conscience.\nBut I talked to people, I talked to a Catholic priest, even con -- in a concentration\ncamps and I had misgivings about it and he said, \u201cYou should just simply forget it. It\nwas a necessity.\u201d Oh, by the way, Nellie married a Jew. Nellie married a Jewish man --\nPolish Jewish man who survived a concentration camp, and lived happily ever after.",
        "Q: Did your faith in God play a part in you sort of making peace in yourself with --\nwith these things that were bothering you?",
        "A: Greatly. Mostly. Also, I have known many people, in Siberian camp, in the German\ndeath camp, even religious people who lost their faith, say, \u201cIf God existed, nothing as\nhorrible as this could happen.\u201d I had no problem, I never lost my faith. I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s my virtue, it\u2019s a grace. Never had any misgivings about the existence of God, or\nHis/Her direction of us. Recently I had a -- ordered for somebody a book called a\nLectionary, you know, gospels read during the mass? It was a Methodist Lectionary\nand the gospels, they made it into inclusive language and whenever it says God, it --\npersonal pronoun, it always says, He/She, He/She, He/She. It made me sick to read it.\nIt\u2019s awful, it completely disfigures it. We don\u2019t know what God is. He may -- He is not\nHe, He is not She, so He is -- I mean He -- It\u2019s a God. But to put something like this in\nthe Gospel, it\u2019s just outrageous, especially the first -- the first paragraph in the gospel\nof John, with about 11 personal pronouns. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m diverting.",
        "Q: That\u2019s funny. Did you ever do an action with Nellie?",
        "A: No, never did. She did not go in action. She carried stuff. And in most cases, that\nwas more dangerous than being in action. Carrying a suitcase of dynamite, you\nendanger not yourself, but everybody in that compartment. They found it, everybody\non spot would be executed. Oh, she -- many times when the train was crowded, she\nwould bring -- pack her two suitcases and go into a German compartment and she\nwould make the apologies, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I -- the -- so tired and so hot and so crowded\nthere, could I just sit on the floor here?\u201d They say, \u201cOh no, floor, come on, sit -- sit on\nthe [indecipherable] They would sit her on the seat, they would give her so --\nchocolate, they would give her some coffee to drink. They put her suitcases up in the\nrack and she would say, \u201cWatch out, watch out, there\u2019s some eggs in there.\u201d",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure you were in situations like that too, where you were right looking, staring\ninto the face of someone who, if they discovered you --",
        "A: Well, of course.",
        "Q: -- you would be in big trouble.",
        "A: Well, of course. Zillion of times. Sorry, I have to wipe my eyes now and then.",
        "Q: That\u2019s all right.",
        "A: My glaucoma makes my eyes -- eyes run and I have to live with from now on.\nNothing to it, actually. I can see, I can read. And my doctor said, \u201cI\u2019m going to keep\nyou -- I\u2019ll keep you seeing until the day you die.\u201d",
        "Q: That\u2019s important, because you love to read.",
        "A: Oh, I love to read. I read about 10 hours a day.",
        "Q: Go to the library and you get the books --",
        "A: Oh, of course.",
        "Q: -- every week.",
        "A: I work 1n a bookstore.",
        "Q: I know, I know.",
        "A: You will see my bookstore [indecipherable] go downtown.",
        "Q: Yeah, I want to see it, I do want to see it. You had an uncle who apparently, in an\nargument over food with a Communist, was murdered?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering if you could tell us that story?",
        "A: Yes, my Uncle Brunusnous was a soldtis, which was a head of a village. It was a\nelected office -- non-paying elected office, but if you got elected, you became a\nprominente -- you become a prominent person. And he had -- he was in the Akar and\nhe went with me on a few works -- he went with me on a few jobs. Also another\nperson -- a cousin of mine -- first cousin -- his nephew and my first cousin went on a\nwork with me. He had an encounter with a Communist. They didn\u2019t appreciate what\nhe was doing. And at one time the Communist group went on a robbery spee -- spree.\nAnd he investigated them. He did not report them to the German authorities, but they\ndidn\u2019t like it, so they came and shot and killed him. My father kind of tried to defend\nhim, so they beat hi -- my father was badly, badly beaten.",
        "Q: Your father was there when this happened?",
        "A: My father was approached then and tried to defend him. And there was -- they are\npushing one another and then one of them shot him twice. They killed a-another of my\nrelatives in a -- a second end of a village, who had two sons who were fighting against\nthe Communist underground, they killed him. And --",
        "Q: This -- the uncle who was killed was killed in your village, Leshganorra?",
        "A: Yes, in Leshnagorra.",
        "Q: Leshnagorra.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you know about when this happened?",
        "A: That was in -- in 1943 -- in fall of 1943.",
        "Q: And this was your father\u2019s brother?",
        "A: My father\u2019s brother. They live in the same house. One part was his, one part of my\nfather\u2019s.",
        "Q: So this was someone you knew very well?",
        "A: Yes. And of course, before he was killed, he took one of the -- arm of one of them,\nwith a hatchet. When he out -- went out at night, he always had a hatchet under his\nbelt. He had a big overcoat on and he knew that -- just before they shot him, he\nwhipped the ha-hatchet and took arm off one of those attackers.",
        "Q: So these Communists are Polish Communists?",
        "A: Polish Communists.",
        "Q: And -- and they\u2019re underground at this point, too?",
        "A: They were in the underground at point, too.",
        "Q: So what was the reaction of your father and of you?",
        "A: Well, those three people who killed my uncle did not survive more than about two\nmonths. They were killed, one by one, by my cousin, the son of the -- of my close\nrelative who also was killed. That young man was a poacher. He could tra -- track --\ntrace any animal to any place, any time. He was hunting birds with that 22, because\nshotgun was too expensive to use. So, one by one he traced them to place where they\nwere, he shot them, he brought the bodies to the German authorities, say, \u201cHere, one\nmore.\u201d Then a third one was very difficult. H-He shot the first two -- the Germans\nprovided him with a rifle, because he went and he said, \u201cMy father was killed, I know\nwho those people were. Those were the people who are robbing and killing and raping\nthis neighborhood. Give me a gun, I'll dispose of them.\u201d So they gave him manual\nrifle, one shot rifle. He killed the first one within next -- first two weeks, the one who\nhad arm -- well, he was atta -- I mean, 1t was comp -- not completely detached, but he\nwere -- had it bandaged. He killed a second one -- a second one next month and a third\none he had a hard time getting. So he went on a mission. He ate and slept in a hedge\nnearby where this person\u2019s wife lived. It was middle of a winter. He froze, he was hot,\nhe was cold, he was hungry. Eventually he came to visit his wife. So, he got out and\nshot him, put him on the sled, brought his body to the authorities.",
        "Q: So, in that specific incident, there was some cooperation with the Germans?",
        "A: Yes. It was the Polish blue police and there was one German policeman who was\nwith the Polish police. It was a cooperation with a -- kind of a anti-crime cooperation\nwith the Germans.",
        "Q: What was this cousin\u2019s name?",
        "A: His name was Marion Borudes and he developed bad habit. He was very poor man,\nhe had a beautiful, young wife and a little boy. He went robbing Jewish people who\nwere in hiding. And the two boys from the Polish underground came in one day and\nshot him dead. Matter of fact, he was coming from a county village to the -- to our\nvillage. He entered our village. There were two boys on bicycles, said, \u201cMarion?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Iam Marion.\u201d \u201cMarion Borudes?\u201d \u201cYes, Iam Marion Borudes.\u201d They whipped\nout pistols and shot him to pieces. They shot him about 17 times. They got in the\nbicycles -- they took his boots off, he had a beautiful cavalry boots and they took his\nboots off and ran. And two of his older brothers ran out with rifles and\n[indecipherable] village, they were like maybe five -- half a kilometer -- close to one\nkilometer away and they got in the France and they were shooting in them. So they\ndropped the boots and ran away. They didn\u2019t get hit.",
        "Q: How do you know they shot him for the stealing from the Jews in hiding? How was\nthat made clear?",
        "A: It was an execution -- underground court has a execution -- were notif -- people\nwere notified. Matter of fact, there was a document left on him for the -- they read hi --\nthey read him the sentence.",
        "Q: Well, I think I have covered what I wanted to cover about your time in the\nResistance and I\u2019m probably going to move on to the post war ins -- I thought we\ncould maybe take a break now.",
        "A: Okay, let\u2019s take a break.",
        "Q: An-And just -- but does it seem like we covered the --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: One last question about the training you received to become an underground\nfighter, and this is when you were still in Iran and it -- can you tell us about your\nfarewell party?",
        "A: Yes, at the end of our training, just before we were sent on a trip back, a local -- I\ndon\u2019t know if he was a nomad, but I know he had a beautiful tent in the desert, nearby\nour -- our camp. He apparently was a person of consequence, because he had a\nbeautiful tent, he had several wives and a lot of children and he had a party for us. And\nfor some reason or another -- I think because I was the smallest one -- so he gave me\nthe biggest two pillows to sit on and I must have become some kind of a prominent\nperson in his estimation, because his beau -- most beautiful wife was serving me and\nshe sa -- even sat next to me couple of times. And then, when the main course came, or\nthe most important course came, which was sheep eyes, it was a big dish of sheep\neyes, he handed them to me and he said, \u201cYou eat as many of those as you can.\u201d\nBecause that was an so-called honor dish. So I said, \u201cWell, I thank you very much for\nyour recognition, but I would like to share it with all of you, so you are the first one to\nshare with me.\u201d So he took one and ev -- I sent it around and everybody took one. By\nthe time it came back to me, there was only one eye left. So I put it in and I swallowed\nit, almost choked on it. And, you cannot chew a sheep\u2019s eye, just like a little billiard\nball. You swallow it And I did choke at the end, of course. Then, there was a cumis to\ndrink. And cumis is an Arabian and Persian drink that is made of 100 percent alcohol\nand mir -- milk. They put it in a leather bag, a man gets on a horse and he rides out of\na des -- in a desert -- in heat, whatever. And he rides a long distance there and a long\ndistance back and that thing gets way -- well shaken -- well mixed. Then they cool it\noff and you drink it. And is the smoothest drink you have ever drunk. And if yo -- and\nit\u2019s -- it goes in so neatly, but man, the katzenjammer you get. That was the worst\nhangover I ever had. After I drank the drink, I almost dropped. I sat for the rest of the\nparty, I didn\u2019t know where I was. I was sick all night. I was mo -- sick most of the next\nmorning and I forswore alcohol forever and a day. Well, of course, I didn\u2019t drink for at\nleast four weeks after that. That was the greatest party I ever went to and I don\u2019t\nremember much of it after the first drink.",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019d like to move into the post war period. Initially, you are -- recuperate in a\nsanitorium and then, can you tell us about when you\u2019re first taken to Wildeflecken?",
        "A: Wildeflecken, yes. To quickly go through it, from Gusensfite, those of us who were\nhalf dead, were immediately transported to Hokenfelds, which was in West Germany.\nIt was in early May, shortly after liberation. They stabilized us, we did get a little milk\nmixed with water and a gruel, kind of like a baby food, for some time. So I was in the\nfield hospital in Hokenfelds for a short time, then I was transported to Statishere\nHospital in Bamburg, West Germany, Bavaria. It was in June and I was there until\nOctober, 1945, with a bad case with tuberculosis and a bad case of starvation. By\nOctober --",
        "Q: At this point, when you\u2019re in the hospital for these various months, from June to\nOctober, what are you eating at this point?",
        "A: We were -- received very light hospital food, mostly soups. Very little bread, very,\nvery little meat. If there was a meat, it was a kind of almost like it was pre-digested.\nBy October I could sit, I could even walk. I could even walk to the bathroom all by\nmyself. I could go hide in a bathroom, lock my door and smoke. And sister will --\nsoon I would come and bang on the door and say, \u201cStefan, doshturb. Steve -- Stefan,\nyou are going to die. Don\u2019t smoke. Nicht rowken. You are not supposed to smoke.\u201d\nAnd I think I owe her my life, because she made me stop smoking and I never smoked\nsince. Anyway --",
        "Q: And this was --",
        "A: It was 1n a state hospital.",
        "Q: Her -- her name was?",
        "A: Sister Ursula. She is in my --",
        "Q: Sister Ursula?",
        "A: Ursula. She is in my previous -- in my previous interview. I even spell her name on\nthe form later on. Then I was sent to TB Sanitorium in Foreheim, which is also in\nBavaria. I was there from November \u201c45, to April, 1946, eating mostly dairy food. A\nlot of butter, lot of cream, lot of milk and white -- white bread. My stomach\nrecuperated completely. Actually, before I left -- before I left Bamburg Hospital, my\nlungs -- the liquid collecting in my lungs was pumped out of me and my stomach was\nalso pumped out. Don\u2019t ever let your stomach be pumped out, that\u2019s the most horrible\nfeeling you ever had. From Foreh-Foreheim Sanitorium, which, when it was liquidated\nin April of 1945, we were transported to Lohr, L-o-h-r, also in Bavaria. I was there for\nsh -- very short time in July, 1945 -- I\u2019m sorry, 1946. Then, I completely recovered\nand was transferred to displaced person camp in Ashafenberg. It was Eyager Casernin,\nformer German army camp, close to the city. I work part time as a kitchen help, part,\nlater on, as a accountant in kitchen accounting department. And then I becames a\nglorified long distance runner, between three local camps, delivering messages from\nthe camp authorities.",
        "Q: Literally running?",
        "A: Well, a bicycle -- bicycle, on foot. Later on, I traveled to ash -- to Swineferd on a\nmotorcycle. I had the best American motorbike you ever had, it was Harley Davidson,\n1941. Biggest ever, 407 -- 750 cc\u2019s, at that time it was the biggest. Now, the biggest\none is about three times as powerful. So, I was in Ashafenberg DP camp, from 1946,\nJuly, to sometime in 1947, or early 1948. In 1948, the camp was liquidated. The camp\nwas liquidated and you were sent to Wildeflecken. It was an e-enormous Polish DP\ncamp. It was also an army camp previously, where SS mountain troops were being\ntrained. There were a lot of skis, so we did a lot of skiing. I ran out in many trees going\ndown the hill. That time I worked as a -- beginning as a stenographer and for the\nduration, I worked as a detective in crime bureau and also part time, I worked with a\nAmerican army CIC with Captain Vulcanovsky.",
        "Q: Okay, good. I think that\u2019s a important summary and then there are a few places I\u2019d\nlike to revisit and s-spend a little more time on.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: If you can think back to the displaced person\u2019s camp that -- the one -- the second to\nthe last, where you were at from 1946 to \u201848.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, it is -- so it was in Ashafenberg, the Yagercaserra -- Yaggercaservna. Like --",
        "Q: Tell us what -- what that was like? What did it physically look like, and when you\nwere brought in, where were you settled?",
        "A: It was an army camp. There were brick buildings, three, four and five story high.\nThe rooms were small and each room would have a family or several single people. In\nmy room, there were two families. There was a husband and wife. There was a lady\nwith a child and I was the fifth person. We had bunk beds. We slept, we ate there. The\nfood was given in a camp kitchen. You went with a container and he brou -- you\nbrought your tea in the morning with a slice of bread and some margarine. You\nreceived a soup at noon and you received a soup at night, also with some tea. Many\npeople would be given some non -- unpaid service jobs. Matter of fact, everybody had\nto do some work on maybe half a day a week or a day every two weeks, to clean, to\nsweep, to dig, to shovel, to do whatever. Some people were employed full times; those\nwho worked in a kitchen, those who worked in a public works, those who served as a\ncamp police.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Stefan Czyzewsk1. This is tape number three, side A. B-Before we go a little\nfurther with that, 1t occurred to me, were you surprised that you were able to recover? I\nmean, your body, when you were in the sanitoriums or in the different hospitals, were\nyou worried that maybe you weren\u2019t going to --",
        "A: Yes, I was.",
        "Q: -- get your strength back?",
        "A: Yes, I was. I was so debilitated, I didn\u2019t think I would ever surprise -- ev-ever\nsurvive. When I did and became well, I was just flabbergasted. First of all, it was\nfreedom and second of all, I was healthy. I was very healthy. I could run, I could do\nthings. I could climb. I could just about -- li-like my previous time. I mean, my young\nage. I was small. Big kids beat on me. I could always hit somebody and run fast and\nnobody ever could catch up with me. And the thing -- and this condition came back\nafter I recuperated -- after I got out of the sanitorium.",
        "Q: Did you notice some things that didn\u2019t come back? You didn\u2019t quite get your full\nstrength back?",
        "A: Not really. I did not. I not. My hair grew up. My -- I had my teeth repaired; some of\nthem were knocked out. And matter of fact, I still have one bridge -- stationary bridge\nof steel teeth, that was made by the German doctor in 1947. I still have it.",
        "Q: What had happened to your hair?",
        "A: Well, our hairs were shaved, or clipped. And in the middle of a he -- from the front\nto the back, there was a inch and a half strip that\u2019s all shaved every week and they --\nwe used to call it Adolf Hitlerstrasser. If you escaped from a camp, people could\nrecognize it, you were an inmate.",
        "Q: When you were recovering, were there foods that you really wanted, but you\nweren\u2019t able to have?",
        "A: Yes, there was a lot of food that you really would have wanted, but you ate what\nyou were given. The food was scarce at that time and hospital food was kind of awful,\nbut it was nourishing. Sanitortum food was just great. There was a good, white bread.\nThere was a lot of butter and a lot and lot of milk and even little meat. And also, we\ndid get Red Cross packages. Each person received one every two or three weeks,\nwhich were greatly helpful. There was some little American sausages, little wieners\nthat were the most -- I can close my eyes and I can taste them, how great they were.\nAnd there was a chunk of chocolate. And I always was crazy for chocolate. I think I\nmentioned a previous interview that one time the packages came and the chocolate\nwas moldy. So I traded with everybody and I did get probably five, six, maybe even\n10 big chunks of chocolate, probably four or five ounces each and I ate myself sick.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t look in a -- chocolate in the face for next two months at least. But I\nwent back to it.",
        "Q: Do you still like chocolate?",
        "A: I\u2019m still -- I still like chocolate very much.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve heard a lot about these packages, particularly everyone mentions the chocolate.",
        "A: Well, of course. We were starved for chocolate. Chocolate was not available in\nEurope -- Europe that whole war time. Five, six, seven years. The Germans would sell\ntheir soul for a piece of chocolate. A lady would sell her daughter, I mean, a husband\nwould se -- would sell his wife for -- for a package of American cigarettes, or a chunk\nof chocolate.",
        "Q: And when exactly did you quit smoking?",
        "A: In 1945, in summer, in Bamberg shtateecha hospital. And Sister Ursula was it. She\nwas an old German nun -- nun, and she was very persistent and she watched me like a\nhawk. She made me smo -- stop smoking.",
        "Q: So it really was because she was hounding you about this?",
        "A: Yeah, she was hounding me. She -- she wi -- told me, \u201cYou will die if you smoke.\nYour lungs are so bad. You are full of liquid, you cannot breathe and you smoke? You\na stupid kid. Du fareek da kind.\u201d",
        "Q: When you were in the sanitorium and then the Di-Displaced Persons camp, how --\nwhat was your attitude towards food? Did you trust that food would be there or did\nyou find yourself wanting to take it back to your room for instance?",
        "A: In some -- some camps, you could take it to your room. You went and the -- in -- in\nWildeflecken, there were -- there were eating halls that you went and ate, especially\nfor the people who worked. Starting in Ashafenberg, later in Wildeflecken, I always\nhad a job. So those of us who worked had a special dining room. The food was not diff\n-- any different from the rest of the people\u2019s food, but the room was nicer and we ate\nthere. There even occasionally was a dessert. And I had two friends, Captain\nPsheckfass and Lieutenant Penjik. And whenever came to a dessert, Captain\nPshecktfass started talking about those horrible bodies being carried out of a gas\nchamber, to the crematorium, to the cooler room and so on and so forth. And Mr.\nPenjik, who\u2019d said, \u201cDisgusting.\u201d He would toss his fork and walk away and Mr. --\nand Captain Penjik, who\u2019d ate Mr. -- Captain Psheckfass would eat Mr. Penjik\u2019s\ndessert. Never failed, it always worked.",
        "Q: And you were sitting there laughing?",
        "A: And I was sitting, eating my own and laughing. Sometime before Mr. Psheckfass --\nCaptain Psheckfass grabbed Mr. Penjik\u2019s dessert, I grabbed it first.",
        "Q: What were dinner conversations like a-at that table? What were you talking about?\nWhat were people talking about when they weren\u2019t working at the camp\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, they were -- they were worrying about their relatives -- friends and relatives\nback in Poland. They were worrying what they are going to do. They were worrying if\nthey were maybe -- if they may be forced to repatriate back to Communist Poland.\nThey were discussing possibilities of emigration. At that time, all in 1945, six, even\nseven, nobody dreamed that he -- they would be able to go to America. America was\nkind of a seventh heaven somewhere way up there. Nobody thought they would ever\nbe able to reach it. So, many people started emigrating in 1948, to Belgium, to work in\nthe coal mines. To Great Britain to work in the coal mines. Later on, when emigration\nbecame available to Canada, many people -- many, many people went to Canada.\nThen eventually, U.S. legislation passed a special bill that allowed the refugees from\nDisplaced Person camp to come here outside of the quota. They still ha-had kind ofa\nquota and people from certain countries had easier time coming here than from others.\nAnd the Polish people especially, were given certain preference. So, a lot of Polish\nJewish people were coming to America and a lot of Poles were coming to America.\nAnd a lot of Russian, Ukrainian and White Russian people, falsify a doc -- their\ndocuments as if they were Polish citizens, and also came in here. So the conversations,\na lot of it was, \u201cCan I go to America? Can I go to Australia? Oh, can I go to Canada?\u201d\nBut everybody wanted to come to the seventh heaven, which was America.",
        "Q: Were you -- who else was in the camp? The way you just described it, 1t sounds\nlike there were other Poles? But who -- who made up the camp population?",
        "A: The Ashafenberg camp was a mixture of White Russians, few Russians, some\nUkrainians and Poles, but Poles constituted about 90 percent of the population in -- in\nour Ashafenberg camp. The other two camps in Ashafenberg, Displaced Person\ncamps, one was strictly Ukrainian and one was strictly Russian and -- and White\nRussian.",
        "Q: So, is that why you were sent there? To Ashafenberg?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Mm-hm.",
        "A: Wildeflecken was strictly a Polish camp. There were some Latvians and Estonians\nand a few, very few White Russians. But there were no Ukrainians and no Russian\nRussians. Probably Poles were there 90 -- probably 98 percent Polish people.",
        "Q: Now, when you were in Ashafenberg, it was \u201846, \u00b047, until early \u201848. This is a\npretty long time after the war has ended. How -- what were people\u2019s feelings about\nthat; that they had been li-living in Displaced Person\u2019s camps for so long?",
        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t have chance to get jobs in Germany. There was hunger, privation\nand no jobs to be had. Also, we were not allowed to apply for civilian jobs. So they\nwere kind of kept caged. If you wanted to go out, you had to have a permission --\nwritten permission to go out, with a hope of emigrating somewhere. Some Russian and\nsome White Russian people were forced to repatriate to their respective countries. And\nof course, we heard later on that all of them were dr -- went directly to si -- to Siberia.\nAnd Polish people, Czech people, Hungarian and Romanians and the Baltic countries,\npeople were not forced to repatriate, so they just waited. Sit -- sat, vegetated in\nGermany. Developed bad habits like not working, or drinking and waiting for the\nheaven to open somewhere. And eventually, most of us emigrated. Most of us came to\nUnited States, a lot went to Canada and Australia. Some to Great Britain, some to the\nlow countries to get the most menial jobs that nobody else wanted to take. I had a\nfriend who was a black market operator in Wildeflecken camp and when his half a day\na week assignment came, he never showed up. Or else he would pay somebody to go\nand do his shoveling or splitting the wood. Eventually, he was called to a camp\nadministrator who was -- who was American -- who was American lady. And he was\nquestioned and said mer -- she said, \u201cMr. So and so, I heard that you have not gone\nlast week and this week to -- to your assigned work. What is the matter with you?\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cLady, that\u2019s a lie. They are schmearing me. I have never went to wor --\nbegun to work. I have never yet did any work. I pay people to work for me.\u201d \u201cWell,\nhow can you afford it?\u201d \u201cWell, see, I\u2019m great black market operator. And I\u2019m lucky\nbecause I never get caught.\u201d So that wa -- she laughed and she let him go. By the way,\nthe administrator of Wildeflecken camp was Miss Catherine Hulme, H-u-l-m-e. And\nthere is a beautiful book written by her about the Wildeflecken camp. It was called,\n\u201cThe Wild Place.\u201d It was published in 1950\u2019s and I had had a copy and I loaned it to\nsomebody, never got it back. Has been out of print since about 1960\u2019s and I can\npresume that the museum might have a copy. If they don\u2019t, they should really search\nfor it and find it. She was a good writer, especially when she wrote about Mrs.\nCaptain. There was a tough underground captain, lady from Polish underground army,\nwho ran a block -- a barrack -- probably couple hundred former prostitutes. She put\nthem all on a -- on a s-straight and narrow. None of them ever did any trade in\nWildeflecken when -- when the Mrs. Captain was there. She was just like a god, like a\nblock as -- altester in a concentration camp. Watch out, don\u2019t cross Mrs. Captain. She\nwas an old lady, she was big, she was bowlegged. She -- when they had a parade, she\nwould walk ahead of her troops. She was a --",
        "Q: Her troops of former prostitutes?",
        "A: No, sh-she ran the group -- I mean, she supervised a group of former prostitutes.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay, right. But tho-those were her troops, right?",
        "A: Those were her troops.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: She had trained them, she had uniformed them and she d-dared them, \u201cAny of you\nto play your trade, you are going to be brained.\u201d And when they marched down the s --\ndown the street in a parade, you could -- I mean, you could just hold your stomach and\nlaugh because she was kind of biggish and she had very bowlegged legs and she had\nthe army boots on and she had very short army skirt. She was a sight.",
        "Q: Why do you think the author, the -- the former director of the camp called it the\nwild place?",
        "A: Because Wildeflecken means the wild place.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Yeah, Wildeflecken is the wild place in Germany.",
        "Q: Were there moments of real lightheartedness in the dis -- in Wildeflecken?",
        "A: Nine out of 10 hours were lighthearted. Everybody was drunk with freedom.\nEverybody was completely intoxicated with freedom. When you thought back what\nwas there before and what was then, it was just unbelievable. And when we talked or\nwhen I reflected occasionally, I saw myself in Gusensfie, getting off the train and\nwalking under the viaduct to the tunnel, to dig and work. And over the viaduct,\npassing trains would be going on and people standing in the windows, leaning out of\nthe windows, eating and drinking and billing -- being free. And saw those beautiful\nGerman, blonde girls leaning out and looking on them and you heart was so sick\nlooking at that freedom those people had and looking at yourself, that you were going\n-- may be killed today or tomorrow or starve to death or drowned tonight by a capo or\nha -- you head to -- was -- to -- bashed in that night by another capo. So then\nfrequently, when you later on thought about this and about what was then, after\nliberation, you just were completely intoxicated with that freedom.",
        "Q: Were people talking about what had happened to them? Is that something that\npeople had a need to go into detail about? Did you?",
        "A: A lot of people did. Lot of people shared. Some people couldn\u2019t. And many of us\nwere quite abnormal. We hoarded food. We picked up every scrap of everything on\nthe street. Even now, when I walk down the street and I see a penny, or a piece of\npaper, or an old shoelace, I pick it up. We just hoarded everything, because well, you\nnever know. Maybe tomorrow you are going to be hungry or maybe I want to tie my\nshoes and I wouldn\u2019t have anything to tie them with. And most of us kind of outgrew\nit and adjusted. At least, I hope I adjusted. I have some strange custom and habits and\nthoughts occasionally, but I don\u2019t rave and don\u2019t -- well, don\u2019t seem to be abnormal. I\nhad a wife who lives with me forever and she somehow stands me. But many of us\nbecame quite abnormal. I think I mentioned previously a father of a young girl I met\nhere, who came to talk to me about the life there and I discover later on that he was a\nJewish man. And I told her that she should ask him to tell her what happened to him.\nHe survived the whole war in a Polish forest with a group of partisans, or by -- and by\nhimself. He does not want to talk about it, not a word. He doesn\u2019t want to talk, so I ask\nher to wor -- \u201cWell, ask him to write it down.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to write.\u201d\n\u201cWell, ask him to write in Polish.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to write in Polish.\u201d \u201cWell,\nhow about Yiddish?\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to write it Yiddish.\u201d He\u2019s completely\nilliterate and he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. After all that time.",
        "Q: Can you tell us when and how you be -- you -- you became a stenographer for the\npolice and I believe this was in Wildeflecken.",
        "A: Yes, I took a st-steno course in Ashafenberg just before I left and just before I left, I\napplied for a steno job with the police or the camp administrator office. And my best\nfriend, Captain Psheckfass, who was a police commander there, he negated my\napplication. Then, when we were transferred to Wildeflecken --",
        "Q: Do you know why he did?",
        "A: He thought I was too foxy. He knew a little about my document washing, or else he\nhad heard a rumor about my document washing. He was afraid if I have access to\ndocuments, especially to the copies -- I mean, to the f -- blanks of documents, I may\nsneak some out. By -- when I -- when we moved to Wildeflecken, he tried to do the\nsame thing, but he was overruled by Captain Jaigiss, who was a liaison officer with the\nAmerican army. And Mr. Jaigiss made he -- me his personal stenographer and he put\nme into the investigation -- into crime office. Made me into a great detective, which I\nwasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: What did they know about your background, in terms of the war and the -- the --\nyour resistance?",
        "A: They knew that I was a former prisoner. They didn\u2019t know anything about my\nresistance work.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t tell them?",
        "A: I did not. Occasionally I mentioned that I did some work before I was arrested.\nEspecially, I -- well the -- they di -- \u201cYou got arrested, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWell, yes.\u201d \u201cDid\nyou steal a car? Did you steal a chicken?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, yes, something like that.\u201d But\nthere was no time to brag about that time. But later on, when they asked questions, I\nmentioned that I served in Polish underground. And especially in 1948, when I was in\nWildeflecken, a British man came -- missions were coming, visiting camps and British\nman came for a visit and I was in the office and he came in the office and we\nrecognized one another.",
        "Q: Where was he from?",
        "A: He was my trainer in Persia.",
        "Q: And his name was?",
        "A: Captain Thompson. Well, he were -- by that time he was Brigadier Thompson.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about that? Seeing him, talking to him?",
        "A: Oh, we had a short talk, then lunchtime he went to -- to our dining room and we sat\nand talked during the lunch time. And he said, \u201cWell, not much I can do for you, but I\nreread your reports just recently and your little group did as my -- as much damage as\nmy brigade -- OSS brigade did. So Ill do something.\u201d And he actually did. The Polish\nauthorities in Great Britain sent me a form to fill out and they wanted to give me\nPolish vertudtimilitary and I sent them a letter back, telling them what to put it in,\nwhere to stick it. Because, when we were fighting in Poland, they did not want to give\nany help to that part of underground that I was in. And later on they wanted to share in\nthe glory.",
        "Q: Who didn\u2019t want to give any help?",
        "A: The Polish government in exile in Great Britain. They helped only the Akar, the\nhome army. They did not -- did not want to help the NSZ, because we -- we were the -\n- well, kind of perhaps, according to them, chauvinistic group. They didn\u2019t want to\nhave much to do with us. They would accept our reports. They would accept our\nreports, especially my group and two other groups, they would accept the reports and\nsend -- and give them to the British authorities, but they would not help us.",
        "Q: What kind of help did you need that they didn\u2019t give?",
        "A: Plastic explosives. Some arms and ammunition, especially British sten guns. They\nwere very, very good, they were almost as good as the German schmizers. We did not\nget any -- get any out of them. We did get some occasionally, but it was buying,\nstealing, smuggling.",
        "Q: What other things did you and the Brigadier General --",
        "A: Thompson.",
        "Q: Thompson, speak of?",
        "A: Oh, we talked -- he talked about his brigade, working --sending un -- sending --\nflying people and dumping them in Germany behind the front lines and in occupied\nFrance. His brigade was fighting in Belgium. They would drop behind the German\nlines. And we talked about -- we talked about, especially about the V2 that my group\nfished out o-of Aboog River and the British sent a plane to ta -- to take it to Great\nBritain. The German flying bomb.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the B2?",
        "A: V2, yes.",
        "Q: And he -- he knew about what you had done?",
        "A: He knew that. He knew it must not -- 1t was my group who did it.",
        "Q: Did he recognize you right away when he walked in?",
        "A: Yes, he did. I recognized him, mainly. But I said, \u201cMan, you got bald.\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cYou don\u2019t have many hair, either.\u201d He was a big, big man, probably six foot\nfour or six foot five. And I reach about [indecipherable] just about to his -- to his hip.",
        "Q: And did you speak to him in English?",
        "A: No, we spoke German.",
        "Q: You spoke German?",
        "A: Yes. I knew -- I knew some English, but very -- we tri -- I tried to try my English\non him, but he said, \u201cOh, forget it. Let\u2019s pick German.\u201d And he knew little Polish, too.\nWe spoke German -- a gibberish of Polish and German. And I said, \u201cOh, Major\nThompson.\u201d He said, \u201cBrigadier Thompson for you.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat happened to you?\nHow do you get to be a Brigadier? You were just a Major. I don\u2019t th-think even you\nwere a Major, I think you were Captain.\u201d \u201cOh yes, yes, I was a Major.\u201d",
        "Q: But it was a good meeting?",
        "A: It was a good meeting, yes. Oh, he gave me si -- hi-his hat. He gave me his beret.",
        "Q: His beret?",
        "A: Yes. And I had it -- I wore it out completely. Then short -- shortly -- I mean, a few\nyears ago, I got one identical one.",
        "Q: What did he say when he gave it to you?",
        "A: \u201cI -- there\u2019s nothing I can give you. Why don\u2019t you have my hat at least?\u201d \u201cBut you\nare bald and your head when you -- you are going to be cold.\u201d \u201cNever mind, I got one\n-- I got another. I have a formal one in my baggage.\u201d\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Stefan Czyzewski. This is tape number three, side B. So tell us a little bit about\nyour job as a stenographer for the police department.",
        "A: The liaison officer would dictate to me and I would transcribe and he would --\nletters to his -- people like him in the various different camps. He was kind of a head\nman of all of them and he would receive letters and he -- then he would write a lot of\nmemos, which I would write -- write and transcribe, then put in a file. And later on,\nwhen he relinquished me to the police department, I would participate in -- 1n-\ninterrogation, when a few people were interrogating somebody, I would write it down\nand later transcribe. Then, when I interrogate -- later on, when I became detective, an\ninterrogator myself, I would write in the shorthand and later transcribe and make them\n-- I mean, ask them to sign, if they were willing. If they were not willing, they had to\nsign anyway. Little arm bending always helps. And later on, when I participating in\nsome interrogation of Germans by the CIC people, I would take short hand, later\ntranscribe it in Polish or German and somebody else would translate into English.",
        "Q: What kinds of police matters were being looked into in Wild-Wildeflecken?",
        "A: Thefts, robberies. Occasionally a murder. Then, there was a lot of medical malpra-\nmalpractice, people who were killed in abortions. Some suicides at the -- there was\nthose ber -- bring -- that were suspected of -- as -- as murders. There was one some --\nthere was some fathers who abused their daughters sexually, and such.",
        "Q: So you would be asked to come in and take notes during an interrogation?",
        "A: I would have police bring that person to the office and I would interrogate them and\nwrite 1t down and then talk to them again and ask them if they were willing to sign\nwhatever they told me. And in most cases, they were willing to sign.",
        "Q: Were you interviewing witnesses?",
        "A: Inter -- witnesses and perpetrators.",
        "Q: And perpetrators?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how long did you do this for?",
        "A: Well, *48, \u201849.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And can you tell us a little bit about how -- how you made the\ntransition from initially being sort of on the sidelines of events to actually being the\nperson to do the interrogating? How did that happen?",
        "A: We had a -- we had a criminal judge who ran the department and we would -- each\nday, at the end of the day, we would be given an hour lecture on procedures and ways\nand -- and means. So, after a few months of that, most of us became quite adept\ninterrogators and detectives. Went in the field work, had a shoot out occasionally with\nsome people who were robbing and stealing.",
        "Q: In the camp?",
        "A: Outside of camp. People from camp -- young men from camp would go into\nGerman countryside and rob and steal.",
        "Q: What -- how did you feel about the work? I mean --",
        "A: Well, sometimes it was kind of difficult to go against your own and for the\nGermans, but this wa-was not the war any more. That was freedom, that was a free\ncountry and a perpetrator is a perpetrator and consequently, you -- you don\u2019t feel\nguilty about sending them to jail. Also, very few of them went to jail. Many of them\nwere kept in a -- in a camp jail for a few weeks, few months, but they were not sent to\nGerman prisons. And there were some very humorous things occasionally, like for\ninstance, a group of boys went and they stole a cow. And they made the cow walk to\nthe fifth floor, into the attic. They slaughtered it and were selling the meat. Somebody\nreported them and of course, I was assigned to it. I grabbed three policemen and we\nwent up and we looked and we searched the whole block, we couldn\u2019t find 1t. Then we\nwent with an attic -- in the attic and sure, there was a whole lot of meat still left, a lot\nof bones. \u201cHow did you get the cow up here?\u201d \u201cWell, she walked up the steps.\u201d And\nlater on, when I interrogated that [indecipherable] perpetrators, said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t\nsee the cow. The cow just came to a block, walked up the steps. I couldn\u2019t make her go\ndown, so I had to kill her. And why waste all that good meat after I killed her? I got to\ndo something. I couldn\u2019t eat it all -- all by myself, so I had to sell some.\u201d We heard\nmany tall stories. And that was the tallest story ever.",
        "Q: Wh-What happened to him?",
        "A: He -- He got two -- two weeks in -- 1n camp prison, but he was released second day\nand made hard labor, chopping wood in the wood barn.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit more about making that transition from being in the war\ntime, to actually then going against your own, as you said, or actually working with\nthe Germans? How did you make that transition in your mind?",
        "A: Well, we actually, we never worked with the Germans. It was within the camp,\nworking with the old people, the administration of the camp was Polish. The police\nwas Polish. The hospital doctors, medical people were Polish. So, you kind of worked\nagainst the element -- disruptive element in a camp that rest of the people did not\napprove of. Thiefs and robbers and there were a whole lot of -- well, quite a few cases\nof fathers abusing their daughters. Quite a few. Quite, quite a few.",
        "Q: How would you hear about those?",
        "A: Well, felt horrible. Matter of fact --",
        "Q: How --",
        "A: Oh, how you heard --",
        "Q: How did you hear about them?",
        "A: People tell stories. In a close community, people know everybody\u2019s else\u2019s sins.\nSomebody would get mad with that person, report him and you went and called him in\nand if he didn\u2019t want to come, you sent a uniformed policeman to bring him in. You\ntalk to him, question him. Eventually, he would -- people have need to confess in\nmany cases. Many of them would confess.",
        "Q: Is that something that in a small village in Poland, people would have reported on?",
        "A: They -- They might --",
        "Q: A -- an abuse of a -- of a daughter?",
        "A: They might have, but I had never -- never heard of an incident. Never heard of an\nincident back -- it must have existed, because in any community, things like this do\nexist. But, it was never reported, 1t was never disclosed. I never heard of tt.",
        "Q: So what would happen in a case like that?",
        "A: Well, he would get a jail sentence. In some cases, they would be se -- he would be\nsent to a German prison. There was one father that I had a case of, he was sent to a\nGerman prison for five years, but they let him out after one year. Matter of fact, his\ndaughter came to America. I think is still living in Minneapolis, was a beautiful girl.\nMarried somebody here, wer -- lived happily ever after.",
        "Q: Were there trials or was it decided more amongst the police?",
        "A: It was a trial. The camp administrator was a judge. There would be attorneys\nappointed or else, well, just called on, and there were some attorneys in the camp.\nThey were -- would be my old chief -- or chief [indecipherable] instructor in the\ninvestigation department, he would -- he would be a prosecutor. He was a trained,\nPolish, pre-war prosecutor. Good, old man.",
        "Q: Wh-Who was this?",
        "A: A goo -- a -- he wa -- I mean, he was a go-good old man.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was Mr. Clem Camage. And he talked blue streak and he made a lot of\nsense always. And he -- God, he was old, I don\u2019t know how old he was, 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s,\n70\u2019s. He was old and he was so proud because he lived with a pretty, young girl and he\nmade her a baby. Well, those were times, you know, everybody lived with everybody.\nA lot of men had wives back in Poland, they didn\u2019t intend to go back, so they hitched\nup with somebody, sometime they did get married, sometime they did not. And they\nlived happily ever after, or for a short while, anyway.",
        "Q: How many cases did you come across of father - daughter sexual abuse?",
        "A: Well, I rememb -- I could recall about s-seven during two years, but personally I\nhad only one case. Mr. Psheckfass, who was by that time -- Mr. -- I mean Captain\nPsheckfass there, commander of the police in Wildeflecken said, \u201cYou are too young,\nyou shouldn\u2019t ca -- take cases like this.\u201d",
        "Q: Can you tell us a bit about how you had an opportunity to become a detective?",
        "A: Mm-hm. It cas -- kind of happen almost by it\u2019s own violition. It -- they had a group\nof detectives, some were trained, some untrained. So, then Mr. Clem Camage looked\nonce and he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to my lectures? Why don\u2019t you stay after\nwork to my lectures?\u201d I stayed a few times and I listened. And he said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you\nlike to work as an investigator?\u201d I said, \u201cWell gee, sounds interesting.\u201d So I kind of\ndrifted into it. And then especially, shortly after I drifted into it, the CIC people came\nand talked to me, asked me if I would like to work part time for them.",
        "Q: This is the United States counterintelligent corps?",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: How -- can you tell us about that meeting, the first time you met those people?",
        "A: They cames frequently to the camp and whenever they came, they came to the\npolice office -- offices and walked around and talked to various people. They had\nsome business occasionally. Sometime they had no business, just came socially and\none time Captain Vulcanovsky came to my room to -- well, they were -- my room, it\nwere three of us in that room, three detectives and I was questioning somebody. So I\nstopped and he said, \u201cNevermind, nevermind, I\u2019Il just sit here, keep talking.\u201d So I kept\ntalking and then after I had that person sign his testimony -- I think 1t was a witness --\nand leave, and said, \u201cWould you like to work for us?\u201d \u201cDoing what?\u201d \u201cWell, you\nknow, catching the German criminals -- Nazi criminals and questioning them, would\nyou like to help us?\u201d \u201cOf course, but only part time, cause I\u2019m working full time here,\nI get paid here.\u201d \u201cOkay, Pll call on you.\u201d So, every fi -- week, every two weeks, they\nwould take me away for a day or two. I would get the permission from Mr. -- Captain\nPsheckfass to go. And sometime was on -- sneaking to East Germany and bringing\nback somebody or another. Sometime it was interrogation. Some of the -- who were\nquestioned, were of Polish German -- so Polish descent, so they gave me those\nespecially to -- to question. So I would spend five, eight, 10 - 15, up to about 20 hours\ntalking to them and, \u201cWell, you know, your method works.\u201d \u201cOf course it does.\u201d Give\nthem lot of water or coffee. Don\u2019t let him go to the bathroom for the duration. Let --\nlet him do what he has to do right where he sits, he will tell you everything.",
        "Q: That was your method?",
        "A: That was my method.",
        "Q: And where had you learned that?",
        "A: Well, two guesses. Gestapo. Cause the Gestapo beat me, too. We were not allowed\nto touch those people. Don\u2019t let him sleep for a couple days, then I\u2019ll come and talk to\nhim. Take his belt off, whenever he gets up, his pants fall down.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about going into East Germany and bringing someone back? How -\n- How did you know who to bring back and how did you do it? Did you have a\nweapon with you? How did that work?",
        "A: Yes, w-we -- we went -- went in armed. We\u2019d normally drive to the border at\nnightfall and walk across. And they knew who they were looking for. They had\nintelligence in East Germany. Sometime they would legally drive into East Germany\nand bring somebody across. Or go and talk to that person and tell him that, \u201cYou will\nbe taken to West Germany, do you want to go willingly?\u201d Many of them went\nwillingly, because by that time, life in East Germany was bad. In West Germany was\nwor -- bad, but better. And some who didn\u2019t want to go, were kind of encouraged to\ngo. Hom -- some who refused to go, next day somebody would be sent to shoot them.",
        "Q: How did that work?",
        "A: Well, I -- I was not asked to go and shoot. Anyway, I heard -- if it was true or not,\nbut I heard that. Captain Vulcanovsky would come in, \u201cOh, that so and so that we\nwent to talk didn\u2019t want to come.\u201d And I say, \u201cYeah, I remember him.\u201d \u201cWell, you can\nsay a prayer for him.\u201d",
        "Q: And who were -- who were these people mostly? What -- what were they wanted\nfor?",
        "A: They were SS guards, they were co -- gareekt -- court judges. You know, they had\nNa-Nazis appoin-appointed volk gareekt judges -- anybody, picked them up to -- to\ngive death sentences. Anybody who comes, death sentence, death sentence or\nconcentration camp, whatever. They were just local, rabid Nazis who judged people\nfor almost anything, any little trespass. If you were foreign worker, you -- they would\nsent you to concentration camp or have you hunged. If you went to -- slept -- if a\nGerman woman encouraged young Polish or Russian boy to sleep with her, it was\nfound out, death sentence immediately. Took him out and hunged him on the nearest\ntree. But it had to be cour-court case in a gareekt loytemp people -- people would mete\nout death sentences. So, many of those were apprehended and information on them\ncollected. And some of them were de-Nazified, th-they were interrogated and found\nthat they were not really great perpetrators, they were just mitlowfers or kind of\nhelpers uppers, but not really criminals, and let out. And all of them were glad to stay\nin West Germany. But some were sent to prisons, went through court system.",
        "Q: And tell us a little bit about the experience of sitting across from some of these\npeople who were SS guards or -- or judges, who\u2019d had a part in the violence and\noppression that you experienced, what was it like to sit across from them and ask them\nquestions?",
        "A: Well you -- you tried to question this person as a person, but you felt about him like\na vermin. In my case, I knew what happened -- what was done to me by mine\ninterrogator and two or three of his henchmen, who beat the biyesus out of me. And\nyou -- you could see that those people might have done, so you question them and\nquestion them and question them and if there were any witnesses, you questioned the\nwitnesses and you confronted them with the witnesses and you felt like bashing their\nheads in, but of course, you were not allowed to touch them, so you kept them for 18\nhours talking and you give them a lot to drink and, \u201cI want to go to the bathroom.\u201d\n\u201cForget it. You go to the bathroom when I tell you to go to the bathroom.\u201d It didn\u2019t\nfeel so great. You didn\u2019t feel good humiliating them, but you felt like doing it. You felt\nlike that was your duty to -- to really find out if he is innocent or if he really was guilty\nand if turned out that he really couldn\u2019t prove anything against him, that you felt bad\nbecause you mistreated the person. You made him wet his pants many times when he\nsat in the front of you.",
        "Q: Was it something that you wanted to continue doing?",
        "A: An -- I did not want to do it again, ever, in my life. But at that time, I was interested\nin it. I wanted to do it and mainly I wanted to help, to weed out those who were real\nhenchmen, murderers, criminals, who would -- who should not be fr -- walking free.\nBut, of course, the sentences they received were just nothing. Four years, five years,\n10 years. He would serve 12 months and would be released in a good behavior. It was\njust -- I mean, it was almost -- almost a joke. But, we thought, well, at least something,\nat least -- at least something. There\u2019s going -- going to be a black mark on his\ndocuments and he would not be allowed to perform within the population. For\ninstance, getting -- be-becoming important person, or -- or getting a job. Forget it.\nEvery one of them got a good job later on. They helped one another. One did get in, he\npulled all 10 of them in. There were a lot of German police in the German army --\nWest German army. There were a lot in -- in -- in -- in intelligence, a lot of former\nperpetrators were with Gellen in -- outside of Frankfort, helping Americans against the\nSoviets.",
        "Q: How did this affect or shape your idea of justice after the war?",
        "A: I was quite skeptical. First I thought we are performing great service and kind of\nmaking them pay. Later on, it became a big joke and you became skeptical. But things\nof the world are as they are. It is next to impossible to punish somebody for crimes --\ncruelty, or else whatever they did. It was next impossible of punishing them, except\nsending them to the holy inquisition. Putting them in a wheel to stretch their arms,\nbreak their joints and so on and so forth. And of course, nobody was allowed to do\nthat. There was one American, Captain Bollack, he was from Hammtrack, Michigan.\nHe would get occasionally short tempered and he would hit wildly. But after one or\ntwo times, I didn\u2019t want to be with him any more and when he -- when I interrogated\nsomebody, I ask him, \u201cPlease, Captain Bollack, don\u2019t come.\u201d Because he would hit.",
        "Q: Was -- how did you come to a decision that you didn\u2019t want to hit? Because\ncertainly, in your first interview, you told the story about coming across your German\ninterrogator, and you could have hit him.",
        "A: I could have, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Ho-How did you come to that decision, if you could talk a bit about that?",
        "A: Well, I cou -- looked at him -- him, I looked at myself. He was a big, strong man. I\nwas a little, tiny sprout. And him mistreated me as he -- as he did, I said, \u201cDo -- Do I\nwant to be like you were? I don\u2019t.\u201d So, when I questioned him, he said, \u201cWell, I was\ndoing my job.\u201d \u201cDid you have to do what you did to me?\u201d \u201cWell, I was doing my job.\u201d\nSo, he say, \u201cIf you have to do your job, you can do it to me anything you want to.\u201d\nYeah, he was quite resigned by then.",
        "Q: This was Hans Christian.",
        "A: Yes, Hans Christian [indecipherable] name Mr. Meyer, or whatever he called\nhimself. I don\u2019t even know if his na -- real name was Hans Christian, but I did find his\ntranscript of his Ph.D. degree at the -- at the Heidelberg University. He had a Ph.D. in\ncriminal justice and Ph.D. in Christian theology.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s see. So how long did you do the work for the counterintelligence corps?",
        "A: From 1940 -- early \u201848 through 1949, until I left in September for America. About -\n- almost two years. Maybe little less than two years, maybe a little more then two\nyears.",
        "Q: I want to ask you something about the camp and people\u2019s sexual behavior, really.\nYou had mentioned the -- the former prostitutes, but that they were under control.",
        "A: Oh, were they ever.",
        "Q: And then you mentioned that people were living together and then you mentioned\nthe fathers abusing the daughters. And I guess what I\u2019d like you to talk a little bit\nabout 1s, what was the atmosphere generally? People\u2019s sexual behavior in the camps?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t any worse than it was in a -- in normal, general population. At the\nbeginning maybe it was little worse, because there were a lot of young, unattached\npeople who paired on and paired off, but the influence of the Catholic church was very\nstrong in the camp. There were priests, there were chapels, there were churches. And\npeople went to Confession, people went to Communion. People went to Mass. Hardly\nanybody ever missed a Mass, except some hooligans who thought the -- there was few\nconcentration -- former concentration camp inmates who lost belief in God, because\nthey said, \u201cIf something like this happened, God does not exist.\u201d But very, very few,\nso it wasn\u2019t much worse than anywhere else. And, since li -- people lived in such a\nclose proximity, you know, five, six, seven, well, the room I was in was smaller than\nthis room. One room, there were five of us living in 1t. Some-Sometime 11 people\nlived in a room -- room of this size. Everybody knew everything about everybody else.\nSo, if something happens, well, watch out, you get deported and a priest would come\nto talk to you and say, \u201cYou inferial so and so, you better not do it.\u201d Well, some\npeople lived together and it was -- that was kind of almost semi-accepted. They are\nlonely, they have nobody else, they have somebody to take care of them. And many\npeople who were supposed to be leaders or else people to give good example, or\npeople to enforce the proper behavior, did not behave properly themselves. Like my\nimmediate superior of a investigation department, a judge Clem Camage, he lived with\na pretty, young girl and they had a baby and he was so damn proud of that baby.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Stefan Czyzewski. This is tape number four, side A. Did you live with anybody?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. Sorry to say. I was extremely fond of many girls. I fell in love with a\nFrench doctor -- lady doctor, who was my doctor. Beautiful, young girl who just got\nout of medical school. She volunteered to go and she was in Forheim sanitorium, she\nwas my doctor. We became very friendly, she -- we went on a trip, she me --\nrequisitioned a Jeep. We went to see her family, stayed for a week, 10 days in\nVersailles, outside of Paris, saw the sights, came back. When I went to a different\nsanitorium, well, she came to see me a few times, but nothing developed. And, I don\u2019t\nknow. All my childhood, I always was very fond of girls, just extremely fond of girls.\nI always had three steady ones and maybe two extra. After the war, I was, for a long --\nsome time, very friendly with a Russian girl, then I was quite friendly with the Italian\ngirl. Then, when I came to Wildeflecken, a lady secretary in the next office, said,\n\u201cBanya Stefanya, why don\u2019t you come and visit us?\u201d \u201cWell, P\u2019Il be glad to visit you,\nbut why should I come and visit you?\u201d \u201cWell, I have a beautiful daughter.\u201d \u201cOh, when\ndo I come?\u201d So, of course it was -- it -- Good Friday came and she said, \u201cWell, why\ndon\u2019t you come tomorrow\u201d? Have a light lunch after work, we leave at noon. And so\nwe can go to visit the -- the tomb,\u201d you know, we\u2019re going into the church and -- and\npraying in the front of the effigy of -- of Christ. \u201cWe can have lunch and you -- you\nand Hanka can -- Hanka can go and visit the tombs.\u201d So I went and visit the -- I had a\nli-light lunch and I went with Hanka to -- to visit the ...",
        "Q: I guess -- I want to ask this. I -- I\u2019ve read about the camps and in some cases,\npeople are really just sitting and waiting. However, speaking to you, you are so\nengaged with your life, the immediate life that\u2019s around you. You\u2019re working and\nyou're -- you\u2019re being promoted from a stenographer to a detective. How did you feel\nat that time about your life and what -- what was ma -- what you were maybe going to\nend up doing?",
        "A: I felt very lucky to be able what I did. And apparently, people who -- people who\nhelped me apparently thought that I was worth a little. Also, it will probably seem\npathetic, because those two people who helped me the most, spent time in a\nconcentration camp also, or else a prisoner\u2019s of war camp and those two people,\nCaptain Psheckfass and Mr. Shimienski, who was a camp commander -- police\ncommander in Ashafenberg and also worked in a policer in Wildeflecken, was very\nsympathetic and very helpful. Later on, when I got to know Lieutenant Penjik, he also\nhelped me survive in the -- in the police department. He was one of the dignitaries\nthere who did not very much, but was a very elegant person, a well-spoken person.\nThe drinkit -- drinkest person I ever met and we were very close friends and they\nalways thought, \u201cThat little boy, I got to help him.\u201d And they did. So I felt very\nfortunate and I tried to do my best whe -- in whatever I did and in most cases,\napparently succeeded because I was never canned. I was never fired. I was called on\nthe carpet from time to time and told what should not be done and what should be\ndone, but never was really punished, as my document states. He is going to United\nStates and he was never punished, except before.",
        "Q: When you look back at your time, particularly as in the underground, how do you\naccount for your choices? Your choices which were almost instinctively to fight and\nresist, versus just obeying the Germans or trying to wait it out. How do you account\nfor those choices you made?",
        "A: Well, I thought that -- I thought it was inborn, because all my forefathers were\nfighters and active. I had a grand-grand-grandfather who fought the Soviet -- the\nSoviet -- the Russian Souse regime and ended in say -- with a death sentence and later\non was commuted to 25 years in Siberia. I had people who fought with the Polish\nlegion during Napoleonic wars. I had forefathers who had served in diplomatic service\nand were active. I had my father, who wore -- fought in the first World War on three\nfronts. He fought with the Russians against the Prussians and with the Prussians\nagainst the French, with the -- with the French and Polish against the Germans. So I\nguess, if it wasn\u2019t inborn, at least I could think back about it and act accordingly.\nDidn\u2019t want to be bystander. And of course, my ego was enormous. I knew I could do\nalmost anything, and went and most of the time I didn\u2019t, sometime I did.",
        "Q: An-And if you could talk a little bit about the Polish culture in terms of how to\nreact to authority. A German survivor -- I read that she said as a German, she just --\njust obeyed when they -- when the SS told her to do something, she did it and she --\nshe went to camp and she never considered saying no. What about the Polish culture\nand -- and within your own family, what kind of things were you taught?",
        "A: Polish people in the first place, are very contrary. Also very disputatious. You\nwould say -- have four Poles dis-discussing certain set of ideas. They would have\nseven ideas and nobody gives. Consequently, when we get hit, we hit back hard.\nPoland, in history, was overran many times by neighbors who were 10 times more\npowerful. Poland was divided and subdivided by three neighbors who were -- each one\nwas three times as big as Poland and being under occupation of Prussia, Austria and\nRussia, Poland had, oh my God, probably half a dozen really heavy uprisings and\nprobably dozen and a half of smaller uprisings. They were being killed, they were\nbeing hung, they were drowned, they were sent to Siberia. They were -- spent time in\nMagdaburg -- German citadel prison. Polish -- creator of Polish state, after first World\nWar, Marshall Pisoutski spent couple years in a German prison in Madgaburg. So, we\nkind of thought that we are the fighting people and we tried to prove it. Most of the\ntime we did not succeed, at times we did. That was probably kind of loyalty to -- to\nyour state, loyalty to your nation, especially, and acting upon it. And probably most of\nthe -- most of it is that we are qu -- we were quite foolhardy. When I corresponded\nwith my first cousin, who spent about 10 years in a Communist prison -- after she was\nreleased, we wrote to each other before she died. I said, \u201cWell gee, why didn\u2019t you go\nout and fight [indecipherable] And she said, \u201cWe have grown now. We want to\nconduct ourself properly, we want to go by vote, we want to go and work hard and\nperhaps we will succeed. We must have grown.\u201d Well, when I knew Poland and when\nI knew myself and my se -- environment during the war and before the war, looks like\nwe have not grown yet, we just went and hid and fight -- and fought.",
        "Q: I want you to think back to the point when you were 1n the dis -- in -- in\nWildeflecken and when you found out -- no, let me ask you this first, why did you\nwant to emigrate to the United States?",
        "A: For the simple reason that, as I mentioned before, that was a seventh heaven. And\neverybody wanted to go to America. And I had had friends -- close friends and the\nwite of the family worked for the emigration office to America and he hel -- she\nhelped to put me on the list. And eventually my name came, my number came, I was\ncalled in and was asked to collect documentation and went through the doctors and --\nand all kind of commissions, question this and question that, went through the\nconsulate. Especially I had a hard time with a doctor or else I didn\u2019t have a hard time\nwith a doctor, but Captain Vulcanovsky said, \u201cWell, you have -- your lungs are\nscarred. You'll never go to America. Come on, let\u2019s have your documents.\u201d So he took\nmy little card with the x-ray on it and he said, \u201cHere, stick this one on.\u201d \u201cWhat 1s\nthat?\u201d \u201cThis is my x-ray, I never had any problem with lungs.\u201d That was it, I came\nunder false pretenses. I came here as a former tuberculosis patient, almost dying there\nand I haven\u2019t been sick a day since I came here.",
        "Q: But your captain put his picture?",
        "A: His -- His x-ray --",
        "Q: Instead of yours?",
        "A: Instead of mine. Even though they still -- there was still that little typed line that I\ncould not -- I could not launder. It says, \u201cPleveredes maxudatevair.\u201d So then doctor --\nAmerican doctor looks and say, \u201cYou had the Pleveredes maxudatevair here. How\ncome your lungs are so clear?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, it cleared up.\u201d And he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I\nunderstood the okay. He spoke to the interpreter and my English was kind of a little --",
        "Q: So without that clear x-ray, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to come?",
        "A: Possibly not.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I may -- there might have been special -- certain consideration, because the CIC\npeople said, \u201cIf any problems you have, just call us and we\u2019ll come and round those\nbureaucrats down.\u201d But possibly I could [indecipherable]. Americans at that time were\ndeathly afraid of tuberculosis.",
        "Q: Who paid for you to come?",
        "A: Government funds paid for the crossing of the ocean. We came on a troop ship.\nTroop ship that normally took about 400 people, had 17 people -- hundred people on\nboard. Were kind of --",
        "Q: 1700?",
        "A: 1700. And our trip from New York to Saint Paul, Minneapolis was paid by U.S.\nCatholic Conference. Later, I repaid them. Later, I called on the -- on the Immigration\nDepartment and ask me -- asked if I could repay the trip -- the trip across the ocean,\nthey said, \u201cForget it. U.S. governor paid for it, you are going to pay in taxes.\u201d So when\nI worked the first three months in that year and I never had anybody do my tax return,\nI did it myself. I did it with a dictionary and things and I put a wrong word there on the\nfirst tax return. There was a clause that said, \u201cDo you owe any taxes for the previous\nyears?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d I was getting official letters for months and years. \u201cWe have\nsearched and we cannot find that you owe any taxes, can you enlighten us?\u201d It finally\ndawned upon me what I did and I wrote a great letter of pol -- of apology. I said I was\na greenhorn, I did it all by myself and I made a mistake. Because, you know, working\nonly three months in that year, I got all my taxes back. But I made a mistake that I owe\ntaxes for the previous years.",

        "A: Yeah, it started from Bremenhoffen in Germany. Oh, I\u2019m sorry, started in Hamburg\nAltoona. We were going to Bremenhoffen, but we did not, we can -- started from\nAltoona and it came to New York and docked just close to the Statue of Liberty, I had\nsome pictures made of it in a -- ina kind of a hazy light. And were processed right in\nthe dock and local Polish committee people took us to the train, we had train tickets. I\nwent on a train and got to Chicago. From Chicago --",
        "Q: Oh, I want to ask -- do you remember co-coming in to -- do you remember New\nYork coming into sight and the Statue of Liberty?",

Oh, how tall it 1s, how big it is.\u201d But we docked quite a\ndistance from it, that -- the -- I can\u2019t remember what dock it was. But we surely saw\nthe Statue of Liberty.

        "A: Oh, the noise. A lot of people, traffic. Oh my God, the traffic. When we -- I think\nthere was a old Polish committee lady who took three of us and I don\u2019t even know\nwhich train depot we went to, but oh, the traffic, we were just ogling the traffic and all\nthe -- all of the people on the sidewalks and all those buildings and all this\ncrowdedness. But especially all those cars and everybody drives at a breakneck speed\nand everybody honks their horn. It was just flabbergasting.",
        "Q: So someone met you, took you to the train station and put you right on the train?",
        "A: Put on the train with a ticket and -- and a tag saying that if -- \u201cThis person speaks\nno English, if you can help him, please do.\u201d So of course, pretty soon a pretty, young\nwoman came and sat next to me and she spoke little German. Asked me who I was and\nwhat I was and we talked blue streak all way to Chicago. And then I had a stay over in\nChicago, about two hours, so she took -- we -- she was from Hammtrack, Michigan, I -\n- She -- I think. She was changing the trains, too. So, she went -- I -- we went out, she\nbought me a lunch. We went walking around and we took a train -- se -- se -- streetcar\nand we went to a certain direction, came back a different direction. And then she put\nme back on the train and that was it. I even have a picture of her somewhere.",
        "Q: She sort of took you on a mini sightseeing trip?",
        "A: She took me on a mini sightseeing. It was plump, young lady. And I said, \u201cWell,\ngee, are all American people fat? Look at that beautiful, fat lady.\u201d And the boys who\nwere with me were so jealous. \u201cGee, why couldn\u2019t she pick me up? It\u2019s you, you are\nnothing. I\u2019m a good looking, tall, blonde man, why does she have to pick on you?\u201d",
        "Q: Was there a point, or at what point in the trip -- perhaps it was when you were\ngetting on the boat, or you were on the ship coming across the ocean, or somewhere\nelse where you -- it began to sink in that you really were coming to the United States,\nembarking on a new life?",
        "Q: Well, I -- it didn\u2019t come to me until I landed in New York. Say, \u201cOh my God, what\nI\u2019m going to do this busy country?\u201d Before, it was just like a dream, you know, taking\noff and going somewhere, like flying, you know, bird flying. And I looked and I was\nso lucky because I didn\u2019t get seasick. I ate myself sick couple times -- ate myself sick.\nBut I wasn\u2019t seasick. Everybody was not able to eat and they\u2019re going over -- over the\nside and doing things and I even got a job. I became a typist. There was a Polish paper\nbeing published on the ship. So I typed the art -- somebody dictated, I took shorthand,\nI typed the copy of it and then corrected it and pretty soon there came a little two page\npaper for the Polish people.",

So we came to Saint Paul and there were Polish people from the Polish\nAmerican club. And there was an attorney, Mr. Nahourski, who came also that day.\nAnd one of the Polish people walked me to a barber shop downtown, where my\nsponsor was a barber. It was old Mr. Proekopovich who was my sponsor. He was\nasked -- people were asked by the U.S. Catholic Conference to sponsor certain people.\nSo he and his wife signed up [indecipherable] want a young man to stay with them and\nthey would provide you with room and board until you found a job. And so I went on\na streetcar with Mr. Proekopovich -- no, I\u2019m sorry, he had an old, beaten up jalopy.\nGod, was about 20 years old, was falling apart, but he was so proud of his own\nautomobile -- driving.

        "A: We just wondered who we meet, who we are going to stay with. The trepidation of\n-- of -- of not knowing the language too well. Also, I could write and read English\nquite well by then, but before I left, my British girl teacher said, \u201cWell, you are going\nto America. Those people haven\u2019t spoken English for last couple hundred years. You\nwill have a hard time with them.\u201d I did, for about six months. We swallow a lot of\nsuffixes, we don\u2019t enunciate properly. We -- We garble sentences, according to the\nBritish. It took about six months to adjust to American English. I still spoke broken\nEnglish when I met Sylvia. Every -- every -- every pot I used to call jar. Frying pan\nand -- and -- and a cooking pot, everything was jar as far I was -- I was concerned.",
        "Q: What was your first room like with your sponsor -- your sponsors?",
        "A: Well, the lady of the house had a big supper waiting and well, I wasn\u2019t very\nhungry. Also, I hardly ate anything on the train. I was given five dollars in New York\nand I brought the five dollars to Saint Paul. The American lady bought me a little\nlunch and she bought me a sandwich on the train and the little lunch -- I think it was a\nhamburger that we ate in Chicago. And the lady of the house made a big supper. Was a\nmeat roast and a lot of potatoes. And they had big, black olives. And I was sure those\nwere plums, so I took quite a few. And I can\u2019t stand olives. At that time I didn\u2019t know\nwhat olives were. I still can\u2019t stand olives. And I choked in and ate those three, huge,\nblack olives. I just didn\u2019t dare to put them back. So I choked them in. I almost felt -- I\nfelt sick after eating those -- those -- those big plums.",
        "Q: What did they tell you about the country that you had just arrived in? What kind of\nadvice did they give you?",
        "A: Well, they told me all kind of things. \u201cWell, you will be a greenhorn here for a long\ntime. People call people like you greenhorn.\u201d \u201cWhat is greenhorn?\u201d \u201cWell, you know,\njerno nerogie, young bullock with -- with green horns. And they will call you names,\nthey will call you Polack, they will call you this, they will call you that. But lo -- don\u2019t\nlet it worry you. Most of them are quite stupid people.\u201d",
        "Q: They said that?",
        "A: They said that, yes. Like, \u201cMost people are stupid. Those who will call you names\nare stupid people, so don\u2019t pay attention to them. The people who know, won\u2019t bother\nyou.\u201d",
        "Q: And can you tell us about what you did then?",
        "A: Well I -- I was in with them for about three, four days and I cleaned up and washed\nup the whole basement. It was just reconverted from coal to oil heat. And I\nwhitewashed it and I washed and took all the rust off the old car and repainted and\nrepolished it. It was gleaming like a -- like a newly born baby. And I mow the grass\nand I made my 50 -- first 50 cents. Next door lady was cleaning a house. I went, help\nher clean it up and I took her carpets out and put them on a fence and beat the carpets\nand I made whole 50 cents, big 50 cents piece. And my neighbor was a post --\nmailman. And he was making the lordly sum of 50 dollars a week. And I said, \u201cOh my\nGod, if I ever make 50 dollars a week in America, I will never want any more.\u201d Ha.\nAnd then, about a week later, I met -- well, few days later I went to Polish American\nclub and made -- make -- made-- met some local people. There was one person who\nsaid, \u201cWell, I'll take you with me. Come tomorrow morning.\u201d So he took me to his\nfactory. It was a cabinet shop. It was a casket company. He said, \u201cErnie, the man who\nowns it and runs it, is an old Deutschman, so I\u2019Il let you talk to him.\u201d So I went and\nspoke to Ernie, who was a Mr. Rife, a very dignified old gentleman. And he asked me\nif I spoke German. \u201cSelps forshtanley, I speak Deutsch, I speak Deutsch.\u201d So we\ntalked. He said, \u201cWell, actually, I don\u2019t have a job here for you, but you just come, I\u2019ll\ngive you a job.\u201d [indecipherable] workers having do a certain kind of work here,\nwhich it was -- I sta -- \u201cJust come to me every noon on your lunch hour and we\u2019 Il talk\nGerman.\u201d So, we went every hou -- every lunch I went to his office, which was like a\nmuseum and we talk German and pretty soon I -- they found me something to do and I\nstayed there until the place closed, which was about a year later. He employed people\n-- some of his people in their -- in their 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, who slept most of the time,\ndidn\u2019t produce very much. So, the place got broke.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",

        "A: So Mr. Rife, after he closed the place, he kept the superintendent there, and me for\nabout six more months, liquidating the place. We were cleaning up, taking stuff out.\nHe had in his office a Indian and first American artifacts, probably more than the\nScience Museum had in Minnesota. So he donated most of the stuff there and some of\nit he took to his ranch that he had in Wisconsin, or to his big home in north Saint Paul.\nAnd eventually he had to let me go and gave me a memento or two. So that was my\nfirst job.",
        "Q: And then what did you do? Did you [indecipherable |",
        "A: And then --",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: I was in my mid-twenties that time. 25 - 26? Then I found a job, I became a gandy\ndancer on a railroad. I worked there for almost a -- about a year.",
        "Q: Remind us what a gandy dancer does?",
        "A: Gandy dancer is the person who fixes up the track when you lay a new tie under the\nrail, it is loose. So you keep pouring crushed rock and keep -- and you put your heavy\nshovel among the crushed rock and you hold it up or top with your hands -- the top of\nthe shovel. And you put your foot on the shovel down below and press on it and you\nrock back and forth, back and forth, pushing the stone under the tie, so eventually the\ntie becomes tight against the rail. So people doing this kind of work were called gandy\ndancers. I was a gandy dancer on a railroad section for almost a year.",
        "Q: Did you like that work?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t dislike it. It was healthy, it was outdoors. Although, when Minnesota\nwinter came, it was a little oppressive. When I was coming to Minnesota, I thought it\nwas wine country, because Minnesota in the same parallel that is Matz in France,\nwhich is a wine -- wine -- Champagne country. When I came here, I found Minnesota\nto be identical to Poland. Same summer, same winter except in Minnesota, winter is\nmonth and a half longer.",
        "Q: How did you feel? Did -- were you making friends or did you feel isolated at all in\nthose first two years?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t feel isolated at all, because all the newcomers are going once a ni --\nweek -- a night -- one night a week to the International Institute, which is in -- well,\nit\u2019s kind of all over the United States, who teaches English to foreign born and helps\nthem to gain citizenship if they\u2019re interested. So then I met a lot of Polish Ukrainian\nRussian boys and girls who came almost the same time or just about that time. Many\nof them bought cars, so we would go get into cars and we would go to the park and\nplay tennis and go swimming and go girls -- girls chasing and do all kind of guy stuff.",
        "Q: And how did people in the city treat you? Americans 1n general? You were\nsomeone who didn\u2019t speak English fluently at this point. Did you ever feel unwanted?",
        "A: Not really. No, sometime I felt intimidated. But I haven\u2019t met anybody who would\nmisstate me. My boss at work in the casket company would call me, \u201cHey you,\ngreenhorn, come on here. Do this and do that.\u201d But he was kind of a tough fellow, but\nhe was goodhearted. Next hour, he would come and give me half of his sandwich and\nsay, \u201cCome on, hide over there and eat it, because you look hungry and you so skinny.\nWhy don\u2019t you eat some more?\u201d And I never felt mistreated by anybody. Later on,\nwhen I developed -- learned my halfway decent English and did get my present job, I\nfelt, you know, good about myself, because there were people who did not have as\ngood a job as I had, even though I was always paid poorly and still am. But I did not\nmake here to make fortune. I came here to gain freedom. I wake up in the morning and\nI think about it, I say, \u201cMan, I feel so free.\u201d\u201d Which I do. And say a prayer.",
        "Q: How often d-do you have a flashback to the war and to the time that you didn\u2019t\nhave your freedom?",
        "A: Occasionally, but very seldom. Occasionally when I -- I do go and give talks to\nschools -- high schools, colleges and places -- groups of people, I\u2019Il talk about the\nHolocaust -- about the war time, and so on. I have flashes occasionally after that, and\nthat -- until we met last time in May, whenever I went to give a talk, I had some\nsleepless nights after that, you know, the things were coming back. But when we\ntalked for six and a half or seven hours last May, I said, \u201cOh my God, I won\u2019t be able\nto sleep for next two weeks.\u201d You know, I slept like a log. It must have been\ntherapeutic. And things hardly ever flash back. Occasionally -- occasionally, I think\nabout people who were worthy of survival, worthy of a good life, but did not make it.\nA lot of them. There were a lot of people who were better than I and they were worthy\npeople, educated people, great people even. They couldn\u2019t make it. I frequently think\nof those people and frequently say a prayer for them.",
        "Q: Are the feelings guilt feelings that you made it?",
        "A: At times I feel guilty. At times I feel [indecipherable]. I should have helped that\none, that time, I should have helped this one, this time. Was I able to help him?

        "Q: But when you said you wake up and you think about freedom, that is something\nthat you think of every day, but that is not necessarily in relation to your lack of\nfreedom, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re aware of having freedom when you wake up now?",
        "A: Very much so, yes. I felt a [indecipherable] of it after first day when the Americans\ncame. It was the most exhilarating experience you ever could have had.",
        "Q: And you couldn\u2019t even get out of bed?",
        "A: Yes. I remember it so vividly. Americans came in [indecipherable] Americans\n[indecipherable]. There was somebody who spoke Polish, he said, \u201cYou fellows just\ncome and walk it off and come on out. We have some good food for you.\u201d And a few\ncame and a few of us just didn\u2019t and he came to me, he said, \u201cOkay, come on, get off.\u201d\nI said, \u201cI can\u2019t move, I -- I can\u2019t sit even.\u201d \u201cStand [indecipherable] up.\u201d Said, \u201cOh my\nGod, [indecipherable] that bad?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not so great. I\u2019m glad that you\npeople came.

So he took me directly to the [indecipherable]\nbarrack [indecipherable] hospital and some people came and washed me.\n[indecipherable] me and gave me a [indecipherable] nightshirt. And I don\u2019t know, for\nabout two days I was oblivious. I don\u2019t know what happened. I -- I didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] dead, if I was sleeping, if -- if -- 1f whatever. I don\u2019t think I ate for the\nfirst two days. And they came, three, four, five times a day with that little cup of --\nkind of like a thin [indecipherable] soup. And we drank and ate it.

        "A: I applied for it. You -- you fill out citi -- certificate of intention or document of\nintention. So I filled it out almost immediately after I came here and three years later, I\ndid get my citizenship. The place where I went to improve my English, which was the\nInternational Institute, had a special citizenship course, which I took and went through\nexamination. And eventually the great day came.

        "Q: Has there been a point over the years where you have considered returning to\nPoland?",
        "A: It never was. I have not even gone back for a visit. When the Communists ruled, I\ndid not want to go back, because supposedly I was being look -- looked for. And my\nfriend and neighbor, who I mentioned previously, whose name was Stefan Voiteewa,\nbecame prosecutor general of the Pol-Polish armed forces and he arrested many of the\npeople from my part of Polish underground. And rumor had it -- which is supposedly\ntrue, that he had [indecipherable] them -- taken out and shot, without trial. There was a\ngood encouragement of not going back.",
        "Q: Do you know where he is now?",
        "A: He kicked the bucket a year ago. So if I ever go back to Poland, Pll go and spit on\nhis grave. Even though I kind of forgave him for what he did, but he was an evil\nperson and he was part of it. He had the same name as the present Pope and his mother\nand his family were chauvinistic Catholics. When the first of May came, the Socialist\nholiday, his mother would collect apron full of stones and he will -- she will go, oh\nlike early in the morning, at three a.m. or so, to a house of one Socialist family in the\nvillage. She would go around and she would break as many windows as she could. She\nwas never caught, she was never punished, but everybody knew it was she who did it.\nAnd he, of course, didn\u2019t want to join the underground. He always was on a\nperryferry. As soon as the Soviets came, he joined. He fought in with the Polish\nCommunist army, as far as Berlin. He was sent to be trained in Moscow and Ouro in\nSoviet Russia. He came back and was still in the Polish army and advanced as far -- in\n1975, he became a general and he became a prosecutor in the Polish army, prosecutor.",

When she was ready to retire, she could either rent out the farm, which was\nimpossible to survive on, or else she had to give it back to the government in lieu of a\nsmall pension. That\u2019s what she did. She sold the house and the lot and the house was\non, to a neighbor, for very little money -- neighbor who always helped her. And she\nmoved to a nearby town and lived with her son on a -- on a pension. She lives there\npresently. So the farm was lost. And a farm in Poland before the war, was like a\nsacrament, you never parted with it. That was your inheritance. You ne -- you -- piece\nof land you killed for.

I work only 43 hours a week and don\u2019t\nreally want to take a lot of time to go. As somebody said, you cannot come home\nagain. And it would be kind of difficult to go home again. Especially all those people\nthat I knew would be old, decrepit people and I\u2019m the only one young among them.\nAnd all those pretty girls that I knew are old decrepit women. One of them that I ran\naround with for quite some time, whose name was Helena, when I ask my sister\nEleanor how Helena is, she said, \u201cHelena is old and ugly and she weighs 250 pounds.\nOne of her legs is bigger than you are. You don\u2019t want to see Helena.\u201d And Helena\nwas beautiful, plumped, little girl that I had so much fun with.

And when I started working there, for about\ntwo or three years, I worked in a stockroom, shifting stuff. Candles, wine, God knows\nwhat else. But I always wanted to work in the bookstore. Eventually I did and very\nsoon after I started working here, the manager died and his assistant became a\nmanager. About two or three years later, the assistant mana -- the manager -- new\nmanager, retired on disability and I became it. I been staying -- being it ever since.",
        "Q: And the name?",
        "A: I love books, I love reading. I like the people I work with. I really like the people\nthat I serve. There\u2019s a lot of r -- book reading people that I serve and I still spend about\neight or 10 hours a day reading. I take tel -- a lot of telephone calls. We have a\ntelephone system that covers the whole country. We have 800 number and a lot of\ncalls come specially to me and I fli -- field most of the calls and transfer to somebody\nelse if necessary. I buy a lot of books, I sell some books, and I read a lot -- I sit at my\ndesk most of the day and read. And if my boss complains, I said, \u201cIf I stop reading, I\nam no good as a bookman any more, so you better let me be.\u201d And he said -- he said,\n\u201cOf course [Il let you be.\u201d",
        "Q: When did you discover this passion for books? When did this emerge?",
        "A: Just about en -- when I was three. My mother was a frustrated schoolteacher, as I\npreviously mentioned. She was fired when she had her first baby. Back in Poland, if\nyou had a baby, you were married, forget it. By time I was three, she taught me how to\nread and I have never stopped.",
        "Q: We had just talked a moment ago about you becoming an American citizen. Why\ndid you want to become one?",
        "A: The ideas of America -- the idea of American freedom, the idea of opportunity and\nfreedom for all was extremely appealing to me. And of course, being a bug for history,\nI knew that two great Polish people came and fought for America. And when I spent\ntime fighting Nazis, I didn\u2019t think that I was fighting for my own country only, but for\neverybody else who was subjugated by them, including the Americans, who fi -- who\nwas fight -- who were fighting elsewhere. So, the idea of America was just a\ncompletely ideal place and ideology that appealed greatly to me. May we shut it off for\nawhile?",
        "Q: I have to ask you this. Tell us about your wife, how you met her, where?",
        "A: Well, I had a friend who had a girlfriend and the girlfriend knew Sylvia. And we\nwent on a date one time and then we -- Sylvia read books and I read books. Sylvia\nplayed good music and had a beautiful voice and I always appreciated music and a\ngood voice. And eventually she talked me into getting married. No, no, I talked her\ninto getting -- into -- into marrying me. I wonder what she saw in me, but she got\napparently infatuated and then st -- we stuck together forever and ever. She is the best\ngirl I ever met. Course I wouldn\u2019t dare to say anything else, seeing that she is here, but\nshe really is.",
        "Q: When did you get married?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: When did you get married?",
        "A: In August, 1940 -- 1954. I was going to say \u00b044.",
        "Q: And tell us about your son.",
        "A: While we wanted several children and we were told that you most likely will not\nhave any. But eventually we had a son. He was the feeblest little thing you ever saw.\nHe was premature. He was in isolette for several weeks, being rocked back and forth,\nbecause -- to breathe, because his lungs were collapsed. And now he is big, he is\nheavy, he is fat and he\u2019s a darn good musician.",
        "Q: His name?",
        "A: His name 1s Paul, of course. So, his musical name is Paul Raymond, because\nnobody can pronounce Czyzewski. His middle name is Raymond and that was also his\ngrandfather\u2019s name. So, when he had a band, first band and a second band and a third\nband, he always was Paul Raymond.",
        "Q: Have you told him about your experiences in the underground and in the war?",
        "A: Little. Little. He -- I don\u2019t know, he may be slightly interested now, but he\npreviously was not interested. And I never made an effort to teach him Polish. When\nhe was small, he knew few phrases in Polish, but since we speak only English at home,\nbeing th -- see, being that Sylvia is Yankee, we didn\u2019t indulge much in Polish and he\ndid not learn it. Now, he is somewhat interested. It was kind of interesting last year. He\nbrought a form from Internal Revenue Service. Did any -- did your parents or any of\nyour relatives spend time in a war zone? So he was laughing it and I was laughing it\nand Paul -- they want me to fill 1t out. So he said, \u201cSure, if you were in war zone, fill it\nout.\u201d And you know, if you were in American army, you were 1n a war zone for a few\nd -- five days, a week or two, then you were pulled back and you were put in again. So\nhe said, \u201cWell, gee, how long were you in forz -- in war zone?\u201d I said, \u201cTwo and a half\nyears.\u201d \u201cTwo and a half years? Nobody could make it for two and a half years.\u201d I said,\n\u201cWell, some of us did, some of us didn\u2019t.\u201d So I wrote on that form, two and a half\nyears in a war zone. And I wrote where, at that territory and then fighting whom and\nso on and so forth. And I send it back and never heard from the -- from them again.",
        "Q: Did that spark his interest?",
        "A: Somewhat, yes. Occasionally, now, when I t-talk about it, he -- he listens and when\nwe did get those videos, he said, \u201cWell, gee, someday maybe I wi -- I should watch it,\nI should listen to it.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy? You get bored to death.\u201d",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about your work with the Mung refugees. You, yourself, of\ncourse, were a refugee at one point.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: A-And -- and you and your wife work with them.",
        "A: Well, I did very little of that work, because I had a full time job at all times and\ndoing something else. But Sylvia was working as an instructor in a program, English\nfor foreign born. So she took her -- went to one parish and took individual Mung\npeople and Indochinese people out of the classes and tutor -- tutored them. Yeah,\nVietnamese refugees. And later on, we befriended --",
        "Q: It was not Mung, it was Vietnamese?",
        "A: Vietnamese first.\nA2: It was the whole thing.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: First. And then Sylvia had quite a few Mung people that she tutored -- went to their\nhomes and helped them. And from time to time, or quite a few times, we would invite\ngroup of Mung people to have picnic with us here. And it was kind of interesting. We\ninvite 15 Mung people and maybe five or six would show up. But also, 47 may show\nup. So one time, we had invited about 15 and I think we had about 40 - some. Kids\nrunning all over and they were so well behaved. I mean, you could -- I mean,\nneighbors didn\u2019t complain, nobody di -- did anything. We had games and we had a lot\nof food and the kids went in the backyard and watched the ducks and did all kind of\nthings. And we still meet some of the -- those Mungs. We are out of touch with them\npresently, but occasionally meet some of them, especially when we go to a vegetable\nmarket. There was a beautiful, little Mung girl that Sylvia was friends with her mother\nand her family. We see her occasionally selling vegetable and we say hello and chat.\nAnd then, just about every ti -- well, not every time, but when Sylvia went to tutor\nthem, they would have some little thing -- little Mung thing made and there was an\nolder man, whose name wa -- name was M-Mr. Washan. He said, \u201cSylvia, here\u2019s a\nfree gift for you.\u201d So, she would get a little trinket or little embroidery square or one\ntime she did get a large embroidery kind of a picture, made by -- as the Mung people\nmake.",
        "Q: Did you sponsor a family? I don\u2019t know if it was Mung or Vietnamese or Filipino?",
        "A: Yes, we -- my -- our parish spons-sponsored two Vietnamese boys about 20 years\nago. And then when parish tried to divest them -- itself over -- [indecipherable] we\ntook them in and they stayed with us for some time. The young -- we found them jobs\nand the older one became independent quickly and moved out. The younger one went\nto a local Catholic college and graduated. And he kind of stayed on and off with us,\nfor about four or five years. Eventually, he became independent. Three years? Okay,\nthree years. Became independent, has a new jo -- great job, has a fat American wife\nand three kids. Has a big home and lives next door to us. His name is Vonsan and we\nsee him every day, we say hello every day and we visit back and forth frequently. And\nlater on, we sponsored two of his brothers, who father sent out, they became boat\npeople. Ended somewhere in Indonesia or somewhere and we sponsored those two.\nThey came, stayed with us short time, but most of the time did not, because the --\nVonsan became independent, had an apartment. So we, of course, we visited a lot back\nand forth and those two boys are too married -- also married, have children and\nfamilies and jobs. And we sometime visit with them, sometime see them. And there\nwas a large group of Vietnamese boys who used to come to Milos or for a visit and\nthey still occasionally come and see us. Even bring us little gifts, especially after 15\nyears, just about every one gave him a clo -- I -- gave us a clock. I have several funny\nlooking clocks around. Gar-Garish things with butterflies and -- and crazy things in\nthem. Holy -- Holy statues in them.",
        "Q: Why was that important for you personally to do, the sponsoring of the refugees?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. Sylvia is very good person and she is very sympathetic to\npeople. And seeing that I was a refugee at one time, we kind of did little sponsoring.\nAnd also, our parish -- our Catholic parish sponsored many, many Laotian,\nVietnamese and Mung families. And for a long time, we were, and then I was on a\ncommittee that worked with them, finding them jobs and places to live and collecting\nclothing and -- and furniture and things. Presently, we are not doing much, or hardly\nany of it, because I\u2019m old and Sylvia is catching up with me. I\u2019m ancient and she --\nshe 1s getting old, too. She is not nearly as old as Iam. Many, many years younger.",
        "Q: When you speak with Americans about the war, or the concentration camps, or the\nHolocaust, what do you find? I mean, what do you find people know or think about it?",
        "A: Well, people find it unbelievable. People are, at times, shocked. But, mostly, people\nthat I talk to about it, is people that I go to give talk about it, like in school or college\nor -- or group of people that are interested. So then, they ask many questions and I\nanswer the questions and sometime elaborate, sometime I hard -- hide a lot of stuff,\nbecause they would be too shocking for people. And most American people, sus --\nespecially young people, are completely uninformed and know very little about it.\nEven adults did not know much about it at that time, or did not pay attention toward\nthe end of time, when the news drifted in here about the atrocities, about American\narmy freeing a lot of dead people in a concentratio -- in death camps. Many people did\nnot batay -- pay attention to it.",
        "Q: Does it surprise you that people don\u2019t know the history?",
        "A: No, it does not. Apparently schools don\u2019t teach mut -- much about it. Also, I note it\nwas the last two or three years, all of ca -- all of a sudden, just about every school had\na -- a Short course on the Holocaust and a short course on the second World War. And\nthat\u2019s mostly the pla -- those other places that invite me to come and talk to them about\nit. So that is somewhat gratifying. But, for a long time, people were very uninformed\nabout. Also, throughout all the time previously, and now, very well educated people,\nlike for instance, college professors, tried to disprove that the Holocaust ever existed.\nThere\u2019s a group of professor that\u2019s UCLA, who are very vocal about it, telling\neverybody who wants to listen and everybody who doesn\u2019t want to listen that\nHolocaust never existed, that was just a concoction made by certain groups of people,\ntrying to influence us this way or that way.",
        "Q: And -- And how does that effect you?",
        "A: Well, if I had them nearby, I would feel like bashing their heads in, or telling them\noff and since I have never met one who would voice that kind of opinion, I do feel\nupset. But we have people who are stupid, we have people who are prejudiced. We\nhave pe-people who are hateful and also people who are uninformed or misinformed.",
        "Q: I guess this is my last question, which is what do you think you carry with you\nfrom the experience, especially of resisting and in the camps? Ho-How did it shape\nyou and the rest of your life?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m somewhat satisfied that what I did was not in vain. Also, I grieve greatly\nover those who -- who perished and I\u2019m very grateful for having been able to survive\nand I frequently pray about it. And if it did me -- if it made me a better person or not, I\ndon\u2019t know. As I previously mentioned, I have never lost my faith and in most\ncircumstances, I am trying to be halfway good Christian. And at times I\u2019m not satisfied\nwith it, but I have to be.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to say?",
        "A: No, I think we talked blue streak, forever and a day and I really don\u2019t know what\nelse I could add that would except -- I add to it, except that I\u2019m really glad I survived. I\nam so grateful being able to live in a good, free country that with all it\u2019s mishaps as --\nand -- and thing that happen that are not great and not savory, still is a great, free\ncountry that lives up to it\u2019s ideals.",

        "Q: I wonder if we can begin with you just stating your name and telling us whether or\nnot you ever spelled it differently?",
        "Q: Before we get to your work in your fighting group in your resistance, during the\nwar, I\u2019ve heard that your father hid a Jewish family, or hid Jews and I wonder if you\ncan tell us that?",
        "Q: Can you tell us how your father came to hide them? What were the circumstances\nthat led to this? Did -- did they --",
        "Q: So this hiding occurred in Leshganorra, your village?",
        "Q: Do you know when it began, the hiding of th-the father and the two children?",
        "Q: Do you know if he came to your father and asked him, or if your father offered?",
        "Q: So you made the hiding place? How did you do it, tell us?",
        "Q: Were you there when he was discovered and killed?",
        "Q: You father wouldn\u2019t talk about it?",
        "Q: An-and -- and the woman, Maria, who stayed with you, was she staying at the same\ntime and where was she staying?",
        "Q: What do you -- what do you know about that? Can you tell us anything about that?",
        "Q: Your father did that?",
        "Q: Why did they almost get executed?",
        "Q: So there was a lot going on at your house.",
        "Q: I-It was -- it seems that it was a safe house for at least two Jewish families -- well,\none family, one woman, and then a Communist partisan, who happened to turn out to\nbe an important leader?",
        "Q: So, if something happened in your fighting group and someone was injured, you\nwould e -- you might take them to your house or tell them how to get there?",
        "Q: And then where would they actually stay, in the house?",
        "Q: And the word never got around that this house of the Czyzewski\u2019s was a house\nwhere there were many partisans in and out and --",
        "Q: Jews hiding and --",
        "Q: Did your father or your sisters ever talk about feeling afraid during this times?",
        "Q: How did they tell you that?",
        "Q: Your sisters were hit, also?",
        "Q: I'd like to turn now, to fill in some gaps, turn now to your training as a -- as an\nunderground fighter. And I\u2019m talking about the period -- the six month period where\nyou left Siberia and then you walked in to Iran. And I\u2019m wondering if we could talk a\nlittle bit about that. What did the camp actually look like when you finally got there?",
        "Q: What do you mean by that, infiltrating?",
        "Q: For instance, how would he have you do that, in a training exercise?",
        "Q: So you would be outside the camp and you would have a mission to sneak in, steal\nsomething and sneak back out?",
        "Q: What -- what strategies were you learning in those exercises? What do you do when\nyou\u2019re surrounded by superior forces?",
        "Q: In the training sessions though, what kind of ammunition were you firing? Was it\nlive or blank?",
        "Q: Did anyone ever get killed in training?",
        "Q: You mentioned that when you first got there, there was a period of indoctrination,\npsychological or philosophical. What -- what -- what were you learning in that period -",
        "Q: -- from the British?",
        "Q: Not in the Soviet camp --",
        "Q: -- in the British camp, when you were being indoctrinated to become an\nunderground fighter. What was the philosophy that you were being taught?",
        "Q: And was there any talk in this indoctrination period of what -- of what else you\nwere fighting for? What was the end goal in terms of Poland?",
        "Q: And wa -- was the training camp allied with any of the underground movements? In\nother words, you were training in -- in Iran. Were they telling you, we want you to\nconnect, when you get back to Poland, with one of these specific underground armies?",
        "Q: You were going to say, I think you were saying it was a right wing?",
        "Q: And I want to talk more about that, but I just want to get clear on one thing. When\nyou say that it was suggested that you make a connection to a certain group, what --\nwhat were your leaders in the British training camp? Which group were they guiding\nyou towards?",
        "Q: And how would they suggest? What would they say?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Muse-Museum\ninterview with Stefan Czyzewski and this is tape number one, side B. If you could just\ntell us a little bit more about your personal allegiance to the underground group that --\nthat you chose, the NSZ?",
        "Q: And as you\u2019ve described and y-y-you described them sometimes as right wing and\nin fact, in some cases, they were known for being very anti-Semitic. What were your\nthoughts about that?",
        "Q: Tell us, how did the group express it\u2019s anti-Semitism, if in fact, sometimes Jews\nwere in the group? How was it expressed, the anti-Semitism?",
        "Q: I want to go back a little bit, to the training camp. You have told us about how you\nlearned how to infiltrate. How did you learn how to -- for instance, to do certain acts of\nsabotage, how did you practice them? Perhaps derailing a train, if you could explain to\nus how they gave you that training?",
        "Q: Were you often, when you did go through with an action and blow something up,\nwere you often within hearing distance of it?",
        "Q: You had said in your prior interview that the Polish and the British commanders\nchose you the best of the best. When they said you were ready, was it clear -- what did\nthey tell you and were they putting you, Stefan Czyzewski up as a commander that\nwhen you got into Poland, you would command a unit, was that clear?",
        "Q: That is what I meant --",
        "Q: -- that the group was the best of the best.",
        "Q: So that you were, in essence, an elite group who had had more training than most,\nso that you could go back and then lead 17 other, smaller groups?",
        "Q: Now, I know you\u2019ve told us the story of how you got back into Poland and your\ncrossing water, and the boat. Did you have ins -- what were your instructions once you\ngot into Poland? Where were you supposed to go? How were you supposed to know\nwhere to be?",
        "Q: So tell us how you did that when you got back near to -- to Leshnagorra, your\nhometown, how did you do that?",
        "Q: What was your attitude when you first got back? You had all this training. Were\nyou very eager to get going right away and for people to recognize that you knew how\nto do this? What was your attitude about the process of being accepted?",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about actually being back home. Wasn\u2019t it unusual for a -- a\nyoung Polish man to be home? In other words, wasn\u2019t it suspicious that you had been\naway and wouldn\u2019t that call attention to you, possibly as being an underground\nperson? I\u2019m wondering if you can explain the atmosphere to us. Could you, as a young\nPolish man, just walk around normally, or did it -- that raise questions for the\nGermans?",
        "Q: And make you --",
        "Q: So did you carry false documents? Did you have some sort of cover of what you\ndid?",
        "Q: Did you have a small bag of things that you always carried with you, since you\nwere on the move so much?",
        "Q: And do you remember what was in that?",
        "Q: Do you remember the make of the gun? The six shooter?",
        "Q: So you had a German weapon and a Russian weapon.",

        "Q: How long was he your commander\u2019?",
        "Q: Did you ever meet him again?",
        "Q: Did you ask about him among friends?",

        "Q: Oh, went -- wet --",
        "Q: -- wet works?",
        "Q: Did he tell you why he did?",
        "Q: How many actions do you think you were involved in?",
        "Q: It\u2019s that many?",

        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "Q: Early on, when you first take your command, you talk -- you talked before about a\nperiod where you lost 11 men in two months and then you describe saying, \u201cLook,\nwe ve got to do some training if we want -- if we want to stop this.\u201d And then you did\ndo training and I\u2019m wondering if you could tell us about what did you do with those\nmen to get them in better shape?",
        "Q: What was your way of being with the -- the other troops that you commanded?\nHow did you get them to do the work they had to do, which was dangerous?",
        "Q: Where do you think you got the self-confidence and immense courage it took to do\nmany of these things?",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about just how you took care of yourself. Where did you sleep?\nHow did you eat and bathe? When did you have time to do these things?",
        "Q: At the farmhouse they would feed 17 of you?",
        "Q: Would you pay them or were they offering this as a manner of support?",
        "Q: You left a trail.",
        "Q: You talked about at one point you -- you got a break from your fighting unit and\nyou went somewhere to study psychological warfare, or you -- could you tell us more\nabout that? What -- where did you go and what were you learning?",
        "Q: There -- they actually had like a day where you talked about browbeating?",
        "Q: How would you browbeat someone?",
        "Q: Do you remember any of the advice they gave you in that?",
        "Q: And apparently you learned something about forgery during this time?",
        "Q: How to what?",
        "Q: Wash the documents.",
        "Q: How -- how -- how do y -- can you tell us about that?",
        "Q: You helped make documents so they could get admitted?",
        "Q: You -- you said at one point in the previous interview, that when you got to the\ncamps, that you could almost describe that experience as mild, compared to your\nexperience in the underground, in terms of the danger and the intensity that you\nexperienced.",
        "Q: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking, I\u2019m asking -- what I\u2019m -- I\u2019m saying 1s that -- you said\nthe camps were almost easy after being in the underground, that the underground was\nso dangerous and hard.

A German survivor -- I read that she said as a German, she just --\njust obeyed when they -- when the SS told her to do something, she did it and she --\nshe went to camp and she never considered saying no.

And I looked and I was\nso lucky because I didn\u2019t get seasick. I ate myself sick couple times -- ate myself sick.\nBut I wasn\u2019t seasick. Everybody was not able to eat and they\u2019re going over -- over the\nside and doing things and I even got a job. I became a typist. There was a Polish paper\nbeing published on the ship.

My name is Stefan Czyzewski and I never spelled it differently, except for\nduration of 1941 to \u201845, I carried a different last name and I was a-at that time, I was\nStefan Grot, G-r-o-t. And reason for change, that none of us in the -- in my fighting\ngroup carried his own name. In most cases, we just had one word pseudonym --\npseudoname. In my case, I carried a full name, but my last name was different from\nthe original.",
        "A: Yes, we -- my father hid a friend, whose name was Ithzac Visipka and his two\nchildren. One was about eight, one was about 11, a boy and a girl. And the tragedy of\nmy father\u2019s life was that they were killed, very close to the end of the war. During one\nof the pacifications, Mr. Visipka just couldn\u2019t stand it, sitting in hiding, so he took off\nand ran and was caught in a field -- in open field by pacification squad, the German SS\ngroup and he was killed and his children were killed. And the bad part of it 1s, too, that\nthey were shot only once and wer -- they were dying for a long, long time. They\nrefused to shoot them second time. And of course, later on, they came and took my\nfather. Somebody apparently reported and my father, he had to dig a grave for them\nand bury them. And they also were going to shoot my father -- father, with them, but\nmy father was a foxy old man, so before he went there, he went into a closet, he pulled\nours -- out his Isen cross that the Germans gave him in the first World War, pinned it\nup on his jacket and dug the hole. After he buried this -- I mean, after he laid these\npeople in, he even put his jacket over their faces. And they said, \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\nSo he turned around and said, \u201cDo you want to kill a German hero?\u201d So they looked,\nand he had a -- his citation with him, in his pocket. They read the citation and said,\n\u201cOld man, you escaped this time. Don\u2019t let that happen again.\u201d And they let him go.",
        "A: Was very -- very simple. Everybody -- just about everybody I knew was hiding a\nJewish person or two or three. Just about everybody in our -- in our village -- in our\nvillage of 52 household, we had probably 20 or 30 Jewish people being hidden. Some\nsurvived, some did not. One person that we hid, did survive. She was a young Jewish\nwoman and she did survive. Later on she served in the Polish government. I don\u2019t -- I\nknow her name was Maria, but I don\u2019t re -- know her -- never knew her last name.

She decided to go to the ghe -- stay in ghetto and she even\ndecided to go to the Warsaw ghetto, where she perished, apparently. But Mr. Visipka\ndid not want to stay in ghetto, since he was used to roaming the villages. Before the\nwar, he carried bundle for his mother, Golda, who was a peddler and he knew\neverybody and everybody knew Mr. Visipka. So he thought that he would survive\namong the Polish people.",

He came one night and father -- he -- we talk and he --\nfather and he talked and father found him a place to hide and when I came back from\nthe Middle East, in fall of 1941, I made Mr. Visipka a good hiding place.

So, I made a little trap door in a ceiling of the barn and I\nmade a chamber among the straw above that trap door. It was nice and warm. It was\nstinky, of course, but who cared about stink at that time? And Mr. Visipka stayed\nthere, on and off. He would go places. He -- we would go to work in a field for some\nof the farmers who had so-called farms on outskirts. He could not work on our farm,\nbecause our farm was within a village and too many people would have seen him. So\nhe went to work for people who -- who were all alone somewhere on the side of -- on\nthe edge of the forest. And he would stay and work with them. Then they will come\nback, he will get -- bring some food. And of course, food was never short in our place,\nso he didn\u2019t have to worry about that.",
        "A: No, I was not. I was with my fighting unit. But I heard story after I came back. My\nfather wouldn\u2019t talk, but some people talked.",
        "A: No. He felt very bad about it. And we had a -- we had all kind of moments. Funny\nmoments, laughing moments, was horribly scared. We were worrying. There was one\nmoment -- we were notified by somebody who knew about the pacification squad\ncoming in, so we told Mr. Visipka, \u201cGet in and stay there and don\u2019t peek out.\u201d Well,\nMr. Visipka left his children. He couldn\u2019t stand it, he ran away. Later on he said, \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t want to be found and have all of you killed.\u201d So he came back next -- next day,\nwet, muddy, cold. And he said, \u201cNo panyan. I had three lucks. The first luck was the\nGerman didn\u2019t kill me. The second luck wa -- luck was, your dog didn\u2019t eat me.\u201d We\nhad a big, big dog. \u201cAnd the third luck was, I didn\u2019t drown in the mud.\u201d He ran into\nthe forest, just about 200 feet from our barn and hid in the mud there. He said, \u201cThe\nthird -- third luck was, I did not drown in the mud.\u201d",
        "A: She was staying just about the same time and even before and after. She did not\nstay with us permanently, but she would come and stay for a week or two and then she\nwould go her own way. We didn\u2019t want to know where she went and she didn\u2019t want\nto tell us where she went. She apparently had many places to stay. And after the war,\nshe worked for the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Minz, in the Polish government. And\nshe was twice, I think, instrumental in saving my father from the Communists.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know very much, because I wasn\u2019t there, but later on my sister brought me\nthere. They wanted my father to join the collective and he said, \u201cDamn you, forget it.\u201d\nSo, they had a local Communist who was forcing and encouraging everybody to join\nthe collective, give the farm away. So my father went and threaten him, so they ha-had\nhim arrested and beat him up and of course, Maria came and saved him. And a couple\nweeks later, somebody went out at night and shot up the house of the person who was\nforcing everybody into it, and I know who that was. My father was a [indecipherable]\nwas short-tempered. He has a gun, he had a machine gun. He could do almost\nanything, within reason.",
        "A: Yes, of course. Of course, he was arrested immediately after that. But he was\nreleased and the police -- for their pains, the local militia almost got executed by the\nSoviet general.",
        "A: Well, during the war, there was a dirty old -- dirty old, well, he was -- looked old,\nhe was in his probably late 20\u2019s or early 30\u2019s -- Russian hiding with us for man -- I\nmean, for weeks and months, at times. And my father spoke Russian very well,\nbecause he served in south imperial army, and they became friends, and that Ivan, as\nwe called him, came and went. After the war, we discovered that he led all the\nCommunist partisans in our territory and he was sa -- and he was a general in charge\nof an Russian pantzer division in a town of Minsk, which was about 10 - 15 miles\nfrom our farm. So, when my father was arrested second time, my sister went and tried\nto talk to the man in charge in Minsk. And of course, they wouldn\u2019t let her talk to him,\nbut eventually she prevailed. She just sat down and wouldn\u2019t move and talked to Ivan\nIvanovitch. I don\u2019t know if it was his real name or not. He came storming in, in an\narmy car with two soldiers and a -- and a driver and he came to the county village. He\ntook the police, put them against the wall and ta -- got my father out of jail and said,\n\u201cYanna, do you want to shoot those son of a bitches?\u201d And father said, \u201cOh, no, they\ndo their work. But they beat me up, so I want to hit them few times.\u201d So, he hit them\nfew times. And they were warned, they were told, \u201cIf you ever happen -- anything\nhappens to John ever, I\u20191l come and shoot you, you [indecipherable] and so and so.\u201d",
        "A: Well, of course. We had a lively life.",
        "A: Yes, it was. Of course, there were other people who came in and out, hiding. People\nfrom the Polish underground, some of my boys who were hurt, who were shot, stayed\nfor a few days, couple weeks. As you -- as I mentioned previously, I think my mother -\n- my mother, my grandmother, was a witch doctor. She had weeds, she -- she -- she\nhad herbs, she had all kind of stuff and she could cure almost anybody out of anything.\nShe couldn\u2019t grow legs or arms, but she could do almost anything else. So we had\nmany wounded partisans come and stay and hide.",
        "A: Yes, we did.",
        "A: Oh, we had a small closet, we had a kind of a storeroom. Course we had a barn\nwith all kind of hid-hid-hiding places, they could stay there, too.",
        "A: Well, the wor --",
        "A: -- the words got around and we had many visits from the Schultz Politsi, even\npeople from the Einsatzgruppen came to visit few times. They beat my father,\noccasionally. But never shot -- never killed him.",
        "A: Yes, they were. They were shitty scared at times.",
        "A: Oh yes, we\u2019re afraid, we shook. We cried, we yelled a lot wh-when they hit us. So\nthey just left us alone and went away.",
        "A: My sisters were hit also, especially my younger sister, who would te -- who would -\n- who was outspoken.",
        "A: It was a tent city, close to Teheran, out in the desert. There was cold at night, there\nwas hot during the day. The hamsen blew occasionally. The sto -- sandstorm blew\noccasionally. And the British fished out a small group of people and since my whole\nlife practically went by seventeens, there were 17 young Polish boys and there was a\nBritish -- Commander Thompson, we called him. He went -- he ran the guts out of us.\nWe went on long marches, with heavy loads. We went infiltrate and exfiltrating from\nobjects -- military objects -- camps.",
        "A: Sneaking in and sneaking out, without being caught.",
        "A: We would burrow under the wires. The camp had wi -- barbed wire round. We\nwould get in, we would steal things to te -- to s -- to tell that we were in. And the camp\nguards, who had put an especial -- they were receive special efforts that somebody 1s\ngoing to infiltrate here and we were caught couple times, but we were caught about twi\n-- two out of 10 times. Most of the time we were lucky to get in and get out without\nbeing caught.",
        "A: Yes. And at times we just went in carrying nothing and times we came -- we went\nin carrying arms. At times we went in carrying heavy loads, in preparation for later\ntimes, when we had to carry explosives, things. And we went on long marches, we\nwent on a -- we took in a -- took part in a firefights. We took part in firefights being\nsurrounded by superior forces. And that really helped us later on, when I came back to\nPoland.",
        "A: You divide your group in two or three subgroups. And one groups opens heavy fire\nwhen the -- the other group proceeds ahead of it. Then this -- then the group that went\nahead of you opens heavy fire and you catch up with it. And then in -- both of you\nopen heavy fire in every direction when the third lit -- group comes to you. And for a\ntime we made efforts not to get surrounded by the Einsatzgruppen that we went to\nfight. Later on, when we -- when we received our good armament, especially after we\nbought whole lot of -- after we bought a whole lot of Schmizers from a German supply\nofficers, were so heavily armed, that the Germans had no chance with us, whatsoever.\nAs I mentioned in my previous interview, the 75 to 120 people in a German\nEinsatzgruppen would have four automatic weapons and rest would be manual rifles.\nMy group of 17 plus two, carried 27 Schmizers, because 10 of my boys did not trust\nthe damn German weapon, they wanted to have two. So, we had a su-surplus of it, so\neach of them carried two. And we had such a enormous firepower that he, on purpose\nwanted to be surrounded so we could get into fire -- a real firefight and get out of it\nand well, knock out more people than we normally would have.",
        "A: We always used live ammunition. Work it -- were -- were wounded sometime, but\nit was realistic, we always used live ammunition. If you stuck your neck -- head too\nfar, you got hit. So you don\u2019t. You keep your head down.",
        "A: Yes. I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "A: Was it in --",
        "A: -- 1n a Soviet camp, or in --",
        "A: -- in British.",
        "A: Well the -- first of all, the British wanted to re-brainwash us after we had been\nbrainwashed by the Communists, which didn\u2019t take very long. And later on, we had\nBritish and we had Polish office -- political officers coming and talking to us, invoking\ngreat Polish patriotism, which was unnecessary. We were too patriotic as it was. As a\nmatter of fact, we were chauvinistic. But mostly it was the philosophy of hitting back,\nphilosophy of saving people. Philosophy of making the Europe free of the Nazi\nscourge.",
        "A: The end goal of -- was a free -- or free Poland. Independent, free Poland. It turned\notherwise, but we really wanted to fight for the free, independent Poland.",
        "A: It was suggested, but it was not told to. When we came back, the most powerful\ngroup was the ZWZ and we joined it for a time. Then, that was evolving into the home\narmy, the AK. And also in the NSZ, the nationals armed forces. So some of us -- some\nof us were given groups of fighters from either AK or NSZ and in my case, my\nsympathies were with -- were with NSZ and they gave me -- supplied me with some\nammunitions, some arms, some explosives and gave me 17 people, plus two. That was\nthat ti --",
        "A: It was a right wing Polish underground.",
        "A: The -- not the British, but the Polish political officers were guiding us toward the\npresent and the future home army, because the home army was under jurisdiction of\nthe Polish government in exile in Great Britain.",
        "A: Well, they would -- they would talk a lot about it. This is probably the best middle\nof the way group. They don\u2019t discriminate against anybody and they don\u2019t fight --\nfight any other group, they even tolerate the Socialist, Communists. And this is\nprobably the future of Poland, we will have to live with that, Soviet Russia. And this\nprobab -- this government probably will be the most likely to survive and continue.\nAnd we were told -- also told -- we were warned against my future, NSZ, those people\nhave no future because the Soviet Russia will never allow it -- them to exist. But, of\ncourse, if you are 17 and 18, you don\u2019t believe it, you are omnipotent.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning of Tape One, Side B",
        "A: They just happens -- happened almost by happenstance. They were in ma -- ina\nneighborhood where I was. I was available, they were receptive. The AK, the army\nakaioba already had a group like mine from that neighborhood. They took one of my\nfriends who came with me, as a leader. And the NSZ people had better armament that\nthey could provide us with and also they were very much against the Soviet Union.\nThey hated the damn Communists. And of course, after spe -- having spent a year in a\nSoviet prison camp, I didn\u2019t like them much either. So, that was probably kind of a\ncombination of reasons why I did join the NSZ.",
        "A: That was probably the only aspect that I didn\u2019t cherish. Also, in my very\nneighborhood, in my very group, we were not. As I previously mentioned, I had two\npeople in my group who survived the whole schmier. Out of the four, who are left out\nof the 20, two of them were Jewish boys. Isaac One and Isaac Two. And we had -- I\nhave known another probably half a dozen Jewish young men who were in a group.\nSome even were in a command. So even though the NSZ was at times quite anti-\nSemitic, everybody had a Jew he liked. And he wou -- whom he would protect and\nsave and wanted him to come and fight with him.",
        "A: In most cases -- in my group, we never talked about it. We -- our talk was always\nhow to hit the da-damn -- damn Germans and hora and whit and how to be most\neffective. And my two Jewish boys had con -- had connection with people in a ghetto -\n- in neighboring ghettos 1n two or three towns and had some conva -- kind of a\nuncanny ability or foresight. If we wanted sometime to go one way, they would -- one\nof them would say, \u201cWalcheem, no we don\u2019t want to go that way, we want to go\naround.\u201d So we went around and we discovered later on if we went that way, we\nwould have gotten knocked out. So it was more on a personal level than on a\nideological level. They trusted you, you trusted them. And sometime you trusted them\nmore than you tru-trusted your -- your -- your own Polack in your group. It was mostly\npersonal and we hardly ever talked ideology during our fights, during our existence --\nthroughout our existence.",
        "A: The sabotage part of it was probably the most extens-extensive and took the longest\ntime. They taught us techniques -- how to use old dynamite, which was the only\nexplosive that we could fi -- get in Poland for a long, long time. And how to build that\nplate -- carry and put metal plate on the -- under the explosives, under the rail. They\ntaught us, if they -- we did not have explosives, they tol -- they trained us how to\nloosen up a rail to detrain a train. But in most cases, the most effective would have\nbeen explosives. They told us how to use batteries and since we did not have good\nequipment, we -- you just hung up to two little wires in your hand. Your hand shook\nand you wondered if y -- if you are going to blow the damn thing on time or after the\ntrain went by, which sometime it happened. My commander was mad at me at ev --\nevery time I missed that thing, he wanted to court martial and we -- he threatened to\nput me against the wall and shoot me if I missed. But of course, later on he told me, \u201cI\nwould never shoot you, because you are useful. You are a good tool.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t\nknow if I was a good tool or not, but I tried my darnest. They told us how to attach\nexplosive to doors or to gates or to the brick wall. How to remove a brick from a brick\nwall, surrounding an object or how to dig out quickly, break out of a brick building\nand put explosives in it. And how to stretch the wire, how to use -- how to use fuse.\nHow long each fuse would burn -- how many feet per minute it would burn. How\nmany meters per a minute it would burn. How far you had to be from an objective if\nyou blow it up. Which side of the object you were blowing up, you were supposed to\nbe on, if possible. If it\u2019s not possible, how to hide, what to hide 1n, how to best hide.\nThe best pla -- best place to hide was to dig a foxhole. You didn\u2019t have time to dig the\nfoxhole, so you hi -- you were kind of in a halfway quandary and great excitement and\nbeing scared and being perplexed. And strange enough, I can\u2019t believe it, but most of\nthe times, perhaps seven out of 10, maybe eight, sometime nine out of 10, we were\nlucky and effective.",
        "A: We were always within hearing distance. Sometime we were within -- within a\nharm distance of it, except that if you put yourself behind a big stone or in a small\nditch or behind another wall, you were not harmed. But sometime you were. I had\nbricks -- brick wall fall on me. The object was probably 200 feet from where I was,\nthat blown up and I was hiding behind a good brick wall that turned out not to be a\ngreat brick wall, because if fell apart and I got knocked out, practically.",
        "A: That was clear, but I don\u2019t think I mentioned it to [indecipherable] of the best.\nThose 17 of us, all of us were the best. And we ca -- we were sent back to Poland with\nan understanding that when we reached there, we are the only people who are trained\nand we automatically would assume command of small wet works groups.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: The groups a -- wa -- the -- was the best of the best.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right. Yes, we -- we -- later on we did train some people in Poland, back\nin, especially after some of us got killed. We didn\u2019t want to run out of people who\nknew enough. But resources were skimpy. The territory was not always safe. So we\nhad a difficult time training more people in Poland in the system that the British\ndeveloped for us.",
        "A: We were told to disperse and since we -- individuals who are from a different part\nof a country were told they -- to go into your own territory where you know people,\nwhere people know you. Perhaps close to where your family is and search out\nunderground groups and join them and tell them who you are and what you can do.",
        "A: Yes, I came to my hometown, I joined my family, I stayed with them and my\nfriends from the original -- original group, the OP, the defenders of Poland, which was\nalready incorporate into ZWZ, appro -- came to talk to me within probably two days\nafter I came back and say, \u201cHey, [indecipherable] want to rejoin?\u201d \u201cWell, tell me who\nand horah.\u201d So we had a few meetings with local people and then we went to meetings\nwith the so-called overall command and we identified -- I mean, I was the only one, I\nidentified myself and told them what I could do. And if they had any -- had a job for\nme, all right, if not I will find somebody to join me. And of course, they accepted me. I\nwent through interrogation. They, at that beginning did not trust me, but eventually we\ndeveloped affinity. And after I told them what I went through and identified places\nwhere I was and the training I went through, then they tested me. They gave me -- I\njoined a small fighting group who went on a few jobs. And I became an advisor to the\nyoung man who ran -- who led that group. And about -- within -- probably within two\nmonths, they gave me my own group and I became completely independent from\neverybody. I had supervision. I had a commander of the district to whom I reported\nand who collected information on what we did and who would provide us with places\nto hit. And that was on and on and on and on, until 1944.",
        "A: Yes. Well, first of all, I was cautious. I didn\u2019t know who was who and who might\nbe working for the Germans. After I discovered that nobody was working for the\nGermans, except those who openly were Bolstoitch people, a supervisor or those who\nran the county or those who collected taxes and those who collected food and items for\nthe Germans. Then I was eager to join whoever I could, to join to go and fight. I\nwanted to -- I mean, I was bragging about no end, I told 10 times more than I knew. I\nnever unlearned to exaggerate. I still don\u2019t know how not to exaggerate. So what I say,\nsometime, you should take with a big handful of salt, because 1t may be exaggeration.",
        "A: Well, th-they --",
        "A: -- they did not -- the Germans did not have a close supervision over a countryside.\nOurs was a small village, as I mentioned previously, 52 household, built along the --\none long street and everybody knew everybody and most of the people were very\npatriotic. There were some people there who were members of the home army. There\nwere some people who were members -- I mean, young boy -- young men who are\nmembers of the NSZ. We\u2019ve only had two people in our district, one from my village\nand one from a distant village, who were members of the AL, the Communist partisan\nunderground. Two, a whole two out of about 25,000.",
        "A: No, at that time -- at that time, I did not carry false documents. Before I came --\nbefore I came, every Polish person would receive a so-called cancarity -- a document\nwith your picture on it. You live here, you a farmer, you are this, you are that and if\nyou wa -- if you go anyplace, you had to carry this with you. So when I came back, a\nfriendly person in an administration, made the cancarta for me with a pre-date, so I\nwas just somebody who was here all the time, never left, never was any quar -- just a\nyoung peasant, living in a small village. Not exactly illiterate, but not exactly bright.\nAnd one who brags a lot and one who likes girls and goes to dances and go places and\nworks hard on the farm. And of course, shortly after that, somebody apparently was\nreporting and the German police would come and look for me and of course, they\nnever -- I was never in and they kept coming and pushing my father around. He said,\n\u201cWhen you came first time here, he got scared of you so badly, he just ran away, never\nshowed up again. I don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d So they would beat up my father slightly,\nnot badly. I mean, they didn\u2019t break his bones, but they would make him black and\nblue and let be at it. And that was the duration. I would come for a visit occasionally,\ntalk to my father and he would say a few things and he said, \u201cOkay, you can go back,\ngive them hell.\u201d That was -- kind of a -- became everyday life. Like a life ina\nconcentration camp -- in a death camp became everyday life -- normal everyday life,\nthat also became normal, everyday life.",
        "A: Yes, I had a backpack. I carried my stuff with me.",
        "A: One pair of underwear, one pair of socks. And of course I had my Schmizer with\nme. I also had a good American six shooter. I cherished it, because it was so\ndependable. In a short encount -- in a -- in a close encounter, that was the best.",
        "A: Actually, it was a ru -- it was a Russian nagant, n-a-g-a-n-t, but it was built like an\nAmerican western six shooter.",
        "A: Russian weapon, I had the Russian nagant, and Russian nagant, you could bury it in\nthe mud, pull it out and it would not malfunction.",
        "A: Well, I carried couple books to read and I -- well, I had a towel, I had a piece of\nsoap. I had a razor -- straight razor, which served as a razor and a couple times I used\nit on somebody else.",

Go to that\nhouse.\u201d I would go to that place and there would be somebody waiting for me.

And we\u2019d have a talk and I would hand in my report\nfor the last two or three, four weeks, five weeks.

Then I\ndumped him and two of my boys came and I said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get him out of\nhere.\u201d We were out of the immediate danger. I said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s help him.\u201d Man\nsaid, \u201cForget it.\u201d His top of a head was blown off. That I remember quite vividly.",
        "A: We were surrounded. We all -- we were surrounded almost on purpose. We just let\nourself be surrounded, we were trying our tactics with our new weapons. And it\nworked, except --",
        "A: I don\u2019t. I think his name was Roman, but I couldn\u2019t be sure. He wasn\u2019t with us for a\nlong time. He replaced somebody who got killed and -- but he was good and he and I\nbecame friends.",
        "A: We did what we -- what was done to them in Persia, by the British. We went\nthrough all kind of eventualities, being surrounded. We called on a large group of the\nEnerzet and we -- they had places in forests -- camps in forests, so we would infiltrate\ninto the camps and exfiltrate. We would go and blow up objects. We would -- had a\nfirefight with them. Of course, live ammunition and we were lucky, nobody got shot.\nNobody got even scratched. And we would go -- go on forced marches at night. We\nwould walk 10 - 15 - 20 miles with a full pack, 75 pounds. After that, we became\nalmost invincible. We were not losing -- well, we were losing people, but maybe one\nevery two or three months. But not 11 1n two months.",
        "A: Well really, I didn\u2019t command them. I was with them and I told them, \u201cIf you want\nto be effective, imitate me.\u201d And they tried to. I told them, \u201cI just -- either as good or\nas bad as the rest of you, but I know something that you don\u2019t. So, first of all, we will\ntrain,\u201d as we did. \u201cAnd second of all, watch what I am doing, because some things I\ncannot explain.\u201d Which -- some tried, some didn\u2019t. Some were lucky and survived.\nSome were not lucky and did not survive.",
        "A: I got an e-enormous ego. My ego was 10 times bigger than I was. And regardless\nhow hopeless a time it was, it never was hopeless in my estimation. And I think that\ncourage and bravado is contagious. And courage and bravado -- bravado, that was --\nwe lived upon it for the duration those two and a half years.",
        "A: Well, we were not as bad as the kirigas people in Siberia, who take a bath every six\nmonths if they have to or not. We did wash in rivers, in streams, in ponds. If we would\nstay in a farm on outskirts of a forest, we would take a hot bath. The family, they\nwould boil a lot of water and put them in a big wooden tub and one by one -- we did\nnot change water, forget it. If we got a big tub of hot water, all 17 of us would take a\nbath. And regardless how dirty the water is, you still can wash in it. We cooked on\nopen fire. We frequently would get a loaf of bread from a farmer here and there. We\nwould get a bottle of milk. Mostly we lived on bread and milk. We would get a good,\ncooked meal in somebody\u2019s farmhouse, maybe once or twice a week. We carried the\ndry bread in our backpacks. That\u2019s what I carried in my backpack, probably two\npounds of dry bread.",
        "A: They would feed 17 of us. Matter of fact, many times when we came to a\nfarmhouse -- when we wanted to visit the farmhouse, the farmer will kill a pig and we\nwould pig out.",
        "A: In most cases -- in all cases, they would not accept payment. Sometime we paid.\nMatter of fact, after we highjacked a German bank, we spread money all over the\ncountryside. And to some degree, that was our undoing. We had to move into a\ndifferent territory.",
        "A: We left a trail. The German -- the Germans were wondering where tho-those marks\nare coming from that these people have in this neighborhood?",
        "A: Ina -- there was a course given for Akar and also Enerzet in Warsaw, in apraga\ndistrict. It took about six -- six weeks, four days a week. There were professors from\nPolish -- Warsaw University. There were some propagandas from Polish underground.\nThere was one British man who spoke Polish and nobody could understand him. And\nthey talked a lot. It was mainly given for people who were employ -- I mean, who\nwere publishing Polish underground papers. But they also took some of us -- some of\nthe commanders of small groups in the countryside to go through this, so we would\nknow -- be more conversant what was really going on in Poland -- in the world -- in a -\n- in a war in the west, in a war on the eastern front. And how to act against Germans of\nthis kind and that kind. How to browbeat them, if you could --",
        "A: Browbeating them. How to be --",
        "A: -- how to be ornery to them and still don\u2019t get shot.",
        "A: Well, they gave us advices. You talk to a German and he runs the Poles and you tell\nhim, \u201cWhy do you run the Poles down? My grandfather was a German general and I\nam Polish now and a lot of us are de-descendants of a German people. So you watch\nout. A lot of Poles are just like you Germans, sometime even better.\u201d So some of them\nwould accept it. Some of them would rail against you, some of them wou -- might\neven hit you, but in most cases they would listen and said, \u201cUh-huh, yavolt, yavolt,\nyavolt.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, I learned how to wash and how to make documents.",
        "A: Wash the documents.",
        "A: Wash the documents. And how to remake them.",
        "A: You use chemicals to -- to get off -- especially if you write something and -- most\nof the documents made there were not typed, but were written in ink. And there was a\nchemical, you can wash the ink out nicely and you can dry it and use another chemical\nto neutralize 1t and then you can write again. Somebody\u2019s else names, somebody\u2019s else\ndata. And I do that after the war in Germany, for people who are escaping from\nPoland, who could not get admitted to the displaced person camp.",
        "A: So they could get admitted into displaced person camps, so they would not be\nvagabonds, staying in -- I mean -- fa -- I mean trying and stealing and robbing and\ndoing things for themselves and getting, eventually, caught -- arrested and sent to jail.",
        "A: Yes, the experience getting into the first camp, the Gross-Rosen camp --",
        "A: Yes, it were -- in a camp you were not -- before you got to know what was really\ngoing on, you felt almost a relief, because my interrogation after arrest, was very\nintensive. I was badly mistreated. My last few weeks in Polish underground were very\nintense [indecipherable] very dangerous. So, first coming to the camp and getting\nshaved and getting washed and given a uniform and being little chased around,\noccasionally hit, but not badly, did not feel too bad. Eventually, you learned how\nhorrible it was, but it was later -- later on. The first impression was, was not exactly\nsummer camp and a bet -- but better than prison, because you did not sleep, 17 of you,\nin a two person cell, as I did in a prison before, during my interrogation and after my\nsentence. So, first 1t was almost a relief that you were in a place where you could\nalmost survive. Later on you learned otherwise.",
        "A: We were very active. We did get into several firefights. We blew up few objects\nthat mis-blew, either blew in our direction or else were mishandled. I was called on the\ncarpet couple of times and threatened with execution, because you messed up the job.\nCombination of all of it can get you down, occasionally. Even the -- I was not as\nrambunctious as I always was, during last few weeks.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, executions happened. I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t think he would, but executions did\nhappen, not only for treason.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think it was fair, but I thought was -- it was effective. Fairness --\nfairness has nothing to do with it, effectiveness did.\nWhat would you do? Where would you go and what would you do as a group to calm\ndown after a very intense action?",
        "A: Some people would be allowed to go and visit with friends and relatives. In most\ncases we just stayed at the group. We were so tightly knit. We would tell jokes, we\nwould get drunk. We would sleep a lot. If we had food, we would eat a lot, would pig\nout completely. Then we would drink again and after about a week or so, was good as\nnew.",
        "A: Of course, oh, we sang a lot. We sang a lot. Polish patriotic song, bawdy songs, just\nabout anything. We even sang Lily Mar -- Lily Marlin. We even sang Soviet songs.\nWe would sing the Internationale.",
        "A: You know, the Internationale has a very rousing melody and a -- and great words.",
        "A: I knew their pseudo-names. I did not -- well, I knew probably one or two or three\npeople who were from my neighborhood. I knew their first and last names, but in most\ncases, I would simply forget them. We would have our names -- occasionally the\nnames were changed and you would talk to one of them and said, \u201cWhat was your\nname again?\u201d So he would tell you. \u201cThat was your -- your name last week, what\u2019s\nyour name now?\u201d",
        "A: Not in our neighborhood, there were no women. We very seldom met other\nunderground groups. Sometime we met with other underground groups to -- to -- to\nmake comparisons, to get information, to tell how to do things. How we do it, how we\n-- do you do it? Can we be more -- may we be more effective if we do it your way?\nMay you be more effective if you do -- do it our way? What are the similarity of\nobjects that we attack? What are the differences? How to approach them better? You\nknow, 40 minds are better than 20 minds. We would argue, we would tell them, \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know a thing. You do it my way, you will survive.\u201d He would tell -- they would\ntell you, \u201cYou don\u2019t know a thing, you do it our way. You lost two people, we didn\u2019t\nlose anybody.\u201d \u201cWell, of course you didn\u2019t lose anybody, because you didn\u2019t do\nanything.\u201d It was a constant bickering. Some of it was serious, some of -- most of it\nwas just jokingly doing things to relieve the tension.",
        "A: It would be, most of the time, the NSZ people. We would occasionally meet with\nthe Akar people, but only formally and sometime to exchange information. They\nwould frequently tell us -- tell us about certain objects that were too difficult for them.\nSometime we would tell them about certain object were too large for us. They had\nlarger groups -- they could form larger groups quickly, because they were more\nnumerous in this particular neighborhood, so they could form -- occasionally --\noccasionally, but very seldom, we would have a combined operation. But we never\nreally thought much of it, because our tactics were different from their tactics.",
        "A: Our tactics frequently were just a direct attack. Their tactics was go from behind\nand hit and run. Our tactics were mostly, go out, hit and fight. Because if you hit and\nrun, you may wound somebody, you may scare somebody. If you attack and fight,\nwell, you probably will get few. Matter of fact, sometime you get quite a few. So that\nwas our tactics, constantly and my commander Be Dom alway said, \u201cHit fast, hit hard\nand if you have to run, run. But if you don\u2019t have to run, you better not. Stay and\nfight.\u201d",
        "A: I was in a concentration camp, yes, by that time. It was in summer of 1944. It was\nmy one, two, three -- it was my fourth month. I was much affect -- I was in Vienna at\nthat time, in a sub-camp of Mauthausen, in Vienna, working in a Ostermunzowerverk,\nbuilding Tiger tanks.",

And I was the peasant boy\nwho met a beautiful princess. And we stayed friends ever after. She would come every\nyear for about month and a half, two months. We would talk, we would go skinny-\ndipping. She would ride my horses and I would listen to her music. She played good\nviolin. When she was about eight, she played very good violin. And she spent her\nlifetime being a musician.",

        "A: Yeah, we met, we met. She was still coming for a vacation. She went -- she was\nstill in grade school. She -- as a matter of fact, she was just finishing grade school and\nshe immediately became a courier. Even when she was in school, she was a courier on\na small scale. Then she was going to underground middle school and we would meet\nin Warsaw when I was there, occasionally. She would occasionally come to our village\nand we were it. We thought we would never forget one another when we grown up\nand the war ends, we\u2019ll surely marry. We knew how many children we\u2019re going to\nhave and everything else. And I really should write to her presently, I know where she\nis. She married after the war, they had one son. Tragically, he died in his mid 30\u2019s.\nAnd both she and her husband played in a symphony orchestra all their lives. They\nretired just recently. Their son was a musician, too. He played in a symphony\norchestra. And at -- I heard -- I have it second or third hand from my first cousin, who\nstarted corresponding with her after I mentioned her once in a letter. And I should\nreally write to her and -- but, you know, it was so many times, so many years. We live\nour own lives. Hate to open the old wounds. But I really ought to write her. She was a\nbeautiful girl and a beautiful person. She had the greatest hair you ever saw. She had\nan enormous amount of hair. When she [indecipherable] she could sit on her hair.",

        "A: Well, I said, \u201cMore power to you, but be darn careful.\u201d And, we talked about\nthings. And I had misgivings. I had misgivings about my work, getting so many\nbystanders and so many people who are not real Nazis, killed, mutilated. And we\ntalked about it and she wrote me, saying that, \u201cDon\u2019t feel guilty, because I don\u2019t.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI carry stuff that blows up people and I don\u2019t feel guilty.\u201d\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

So many people who did\nnot have to be mutilated, did. Both on my side, on the -- on the other side. But\neventually, time heals. And I still feel somewhat guilty. I have twinges of conscience.\nBut I talked to people, I talked to a Catholic priest, even con -- in a concentration\ncamps and I had misgivings about it and he said, \u201cYou should just simply forget it. It\nwas a necessity.\u201d Oh, by the way, Nellie married a Jew. Nellie married a Jewish man --\nPolish Jewish man who survived a concentration camp, and lived happily ever after.",
        "A: Greatly. Mostly. Also, I have known many people, in Siberian camp, in the German\ndeath camp, even religious people who lost their faith, say, \u201cIf God existed, nothing as\nhorrible as this could happen.\u201d I had no problem, I never lost my faith. I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s my virtue, it\u2019s a grace. Never had any misgivings about the existence of God, or\nHis/Her direction of us. Recently I had a -- ordered for somebody a book called a\nLectionary, you know, gospels read during the mass? It was a Methodist Lectionary\nand the gospels, they made it into inclusive language and whenever it says God, it --\npersonal pronoun, it always says, He/She, He/She, He/She. It made me sick to read it.\nIt\u2019s awful, it completely disfigures it. We don\u2019t know what God is. He may -- He is not\nHe, He is not She, so He is -- I mean He -- It\u2019s a God. But to put something like this in\nthe Gospel, it\u2019s just outrageous, especially the first -- the first paragraph in the gospel\nof John, with about 11 personal pronouns.

Oh, she -- many times when the train was crowded, she\nwould bring -- pack her two suitcases and go into a German compartment and she\nwould make the apologies, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I -- the -- so tired and so hot and so crowded\nthere, could I just sit on the floor here?\u201d They say, \u201cOh no, floor, come on, sit -- sit on\nthe [indecipherable] They would sit her on the seat, they would give her so --\nchocolate, they would give her some coffee to drink.

He could tra -- track --\ntrace any animal to any place, any time. He was hunting birds with that 22, because\nshotgun was too expensive to use. So, one by one he traced them to place where they\nwere, he shot them, he brought the bodies to the German authorities, say, \u201cHere, one\nmore.\u201d Then a third one was very difficult.

He apparently was a person of consequence, because he had a\nbeautiful tent, he had several wives and a lot of children and he had a party for us. And\nfor some reason or another -- I think because I was the smallest one -- so he gave me\nthe biggest two pillows to sit on and I must have become some kind of a prominent\nperson in his estimation, because his beau -- most beautiful wife was serving me and\nshe sa -- even sat next to me couple of times. And then, when the main course came, or\nthe most important course came, which was sheep eyes, it was a big dish of sheep\neyes, he handed them to me and he said, \u201cYou eat as many of those as you can.\u201d\nBecause that was an so-called honor dish. So I said, \u201cWell, I thank you very much for\nyour recognition, but I would like to share it with all of you, so you are the first one to\nshare with me.\u201d So he took one and ev -- I sent it around and everybody took one. By\nthe time it came back to me, there was only one eye left. So I put it in and I swallowed\nit, almost choked on it. And, you cannot chew a sheep\u2019s eye, just like a little billiard\nball. You swallow it And I did choke at the end, of course. Then, there was a cumis to\ndrink. And cumis is an Arabian and Persian drink that is made of 100 percent alcohol\nand mir -- milk. They put it in a leather bag, a man gets on a horse and he rides out of\na des -- in a desert -- in heat, whatever. And he rides a long distance there and a long\ndistance back and that thing gets way -- well shaken -- well mixed. Then they cool it\noff and you drink it. And is the smoothest drink you have ever drunk. And if yo -- and\nit\u2019s -- it goes in so neatly, but man, the katzenjammer you get. That was the worst\nhangover I ever had. After I drank the drink, I almost dropped. I sat for the rest of the\nparty, I didn\u2019t know where I was. I was sick all night. I was mo -- sick most of the next\nmorning and I forswore alcohol forever and a day. Well, of course, I didn\u2019t drink for at\nleast four weeks after that.

        "A: Ursula. She is in my previous -- in my previous interview. I even spell her name on\nthe form later on. Then I was sent to TB Sanitorium in Foreheim, which is also in\nBavaria. I was there from November \u201c45, to April, 1946, eating mostly dairy food. A\nlot of butter, lot of cream, lot of milk and white -- white bread. My stomach\nrecuperated completely. Actually, before I left -- before I left Bamburg Hospital, my\nlungs -- the liquid collecting in my lungs was pumped out of me and my stomach was\nalso pumped out. Don\u2019t ever let your stomach be pumped out, that\u2019s the most horrible\nfeeling you ever had. From Foreh-Foreheim Sanitorium, which, when it was liquidated\nin April of 1945, we were transported to Lohr, L-o-h-r, also in Bavaria. I was there for\nsh -- very short time in July, 1945 -- I\u2019m sorry, 1946. Then, I completely recovered\nand was transferred to displaced person camp in Ashafenberg. It was Eyager Casernin,\nformer German army camp, close to the city. I work part time as a kitchen help, part,\nlater on, as a accountant in kitchen accounting department. And then I becames a\nglorified long distance runner, between three local camps, delivering messages from\nthe camp authorities.",
        "A: Well, a bicycle -- bicycle, on foot. Later on, I traveled to ash -- to Swineferd on a\nmotorcycle. I had the best American motorbike you ever had, it was Harley Davidson,\n1941. Biggest ever, 407 -- 750 cc\u2019s, at that time it was the biggest. Now, the biggest\none is about three times as powerful. So, I was in Ashafenberg DP camp, from 1946,\nJuly, to sometime in 1947, or early 1948. In 1948, the camp was liquidated. The camp\nwas liquidated and you were sent to Wildeflecken. It was an e-enormous Polish DP\ncamp. It was also an army camp previously, where SS mountain troops were being\ntrained. There were a lot of skis, so we did a lot of skiing. I ran out in many trees going\ndown the hill. That time I worked as a -- beginning as a stenographer and for the\nduration, I worked as a detective in crime bureau and also part time, I worked with a\nAmerican army CIC with Captain Vulcanovsky.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, it is -- so it was in Ashafenberg, the Yagercaserra -- Yaggercaservna. Like --",
        "A: It was an army camp. There were brick buildings, three, four and five story high.\nThe rooms were small and each room would have a family or several single people. In\nmy room, there were two families. There was a husband and wife. There was a lady\nwith a child and I was the fifth person. We had bunk beds. We slept, we ate there. The\nfood was given in a camp kitchen. You went with a container and he brou -- you\nbrought your tea in the morning with a slice of bread and some margarine. You\nreceived a soup at noon and you received a soup at night, also with some tea. Many\npeople would be given some non -- unpaid service jobs. Matter of fact, everybody had\nto do some work on maybe half a day a week or a day every two weeks, to clean, to\nsweep, to dig, to shovel, to do whatever. Some people were employed full times; those\nwho worked in a kitchen, those who worked in a public works, those who served as a\ncamp police.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Yes, I was.",
        "A: Yes, I was. I was so debilitated, I didn\u2019t think I would ever surprise -- ev-ever\nsurvive. When I did and became well, I was just flabbergasted. First of all, it was\nfreedom and second of all, I was healthy. I was very healthy. I could run, I could do\nthings. I could climb. I could just about -- li-like my previous time. I mean, my young\nage. I was small. Big kids beat on me. I could always hit somebody and run fast and\nnobody ever could catch up with me. And the thing -- and this condition came back\nafter I recuperated -- after I got out of the sanitorium.",
        "A: Not really. I did not. I not. My hair grew up. My -- I had my teeth repaired; some of\nthem were knocked out. And matter of fact, I still have one bridge -- stationary bridge\nof steel teeth, that was made by the German doctor in 1947. I still have it.",
        "A: Well, our hairs were shaved, or clipped. And in the middle of a he -- from the front\nto the back, there was a inch and a half strip that\u2019s all shaved every week and they --\nwe used to call it Adolf Hitlerstrasser. If you escaped from a camp, people could\nrecognize it, you were an inmate.",
        "A: Yes, there was a lot of food that you really would have wanted, but you ate what\nyou were given. The food was scarce at that time and hospital food was kind of awful,\nbut it was nourishing. Sanitortum food was just great. There was a good, white bread.\nThere was a lot of butter and a lot and lot of milk and even little meat. And also, we\ndid get Red Cross packages. Each person received one every two or three weeks,\nwhich were greatly helpful. There was some little American sausages, little wieners\nthat were the most -- I can close my eyes and I can taste them, how great they were.\nAnd there was a chunk of chocolate. And I always was crazy for chocolate. I think I\nmentioned a previous interview that one time the packages came and the chocolate\nwas moldy. So I traded with everybody and I did get probably five, six, maybe even\n10 big chunks of chocolate, probably four or five ounces each and I ate myself sick.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t look in a -- chocolate in the face for next two months at least. But I\nwent back to it.",
        "A: I\u2019m still -- I still like chocolate very much.",
        "A: Well, of course. We were starved for chocolate. Chocolate was not available in\nEurope -- Europe that whole war time. Five, six, seven years. The Germans would sell\ntheir soul for a piece of chocolate. A lady would sell her daughter, I mean, a husband\nwould se -- would sell his wife for -- for a package of American cigarettes, or a chunk\nof chocolate.",
        "A: In 1945, in summer, in Bamberg shtateecha hospital. And Sister Ursula was it. She\nwas an old German nun -- nun, and she was very persistent and she watched me like a\nhawk. She made me smo -- stop smoking.",
        "A: Yeah, she was hounding me. She -- she wi -- told me, \u201cYou will die if you smoke.\nYour lungs are so bad. You are full of liquid, you cannot breathe and you smoke? You\na stupid kid. Du fareek da kind.\u201d",
        "A: In some -- some camps, you could take it to your room. You went and the -- in -- in\nWildeflecken, there were -- there were eating halls that you went and ate, especially\nfor the people who worked. Starting in Ashafenberg, later in Wildeflecken, I always\nhad a job. So those of us who worked had a special dining room. The food was not diff\n-- any different from the rest of the people\u2019s food, but the room was nicer and we ate\nthere. There even occasionally was a dessert. And I had two friends, Captain\nPsheckfass and Lieutenant Penjik. And whenever came to a dessert, Captain\nPshecktfass started talking about those horrible bodies being carried out of a gas\nchamber, to the crematorium, to the cooler room and so on and so forth. And Mr.\nPenjik, who\u2019d said, \u201cDisgusting.\u201d He would toss his fork and walk away and Mr. --\nand Captain Penjik, who\u2019d ate Mr. -- Captain Psheckfass would eat Mr. Penjik\u2019s\ndessert. Never failed, it always worked.",
        "A: And I was sitting, eating my own and laughing. Sometime before Mr. Psheckfass --\nCaptain Psheckfass grabbed Mr. Penjik\u2019s dessert, I grabbed it first.",
        "A: Well, they were -- they were worrying about their relatives -- friends and relatives\nback in Poland. They were worrying what they are going to do. They were worrying if\nthey were maybe -- if they may be forced to repatriate back to Communist Poland.\nThey were discussing possibilities of emigration. At that time, all in 1945, six, even\nseven, nobody dreamed that he -- they would be able to go to America. America was\nkind of a seventh heaven somewhere way up there. Nobody thought they would ever\nbe able to reach it. So, many people started emigrating in 1948, to Belgium, to work in\nthe coal mines. To Great Britain to work in the coal mines. Later on, when emigration\nbecame available to Canada, many people -- many, many people went to Canada.\nThen eventually, U.S. legislation passed a special bill that allowed the refugees from\nDisplaced Person camp to come here outside of the quota. They still ha-had kind ofa\nquota and people from certain countries had easier time coming here than from others.\nAnd the Polish people especially, were given certain preference. So, a lot of Polish\nJewish people were coming to America and a lot of Poles were coming to America.\nAnd a lot of Russian, Ukrainian and White Russian people, falsify a doc -- their\ndocuments as if they were Polish citizens, and also came in here. So the conversations,\na lot of it was, \u201cCan I go to America? Can I go to Australia? Oh, can I go to Canada?\u201d\nBut everybody wanted to come to the seventh heaven, which was America.",
        "A: The Ashafenberg camp was a mixture of White Russians, few Russians, some\nUkrainians and Poles, but Poles constituted about 90 percent of the population in -- in\nour Ashafenberg camp. The other two camps in Ashafenberg, Displaced Person\ncamps, one was strictly Ukrainian and one was strictly Russian and -- and White\nRussian.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Wildeflecken was strictly a Polish camp. There were some Latvians and Estonians\nand a few, very few White Russians. But there were no Ukrainians and no Russian\nRussians. Probably Poles were there 90 -- probably 98 percent Polish people.",
        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t have chance to get jobs in Germany. There was hunger, privation\nand no jobs to be had. Also, we were not allowed to apply for civilian jobs. So they\nwere kind of kept caged. If you wanted to go out, you had to have a permission --\nwritten permission to go out, with a hope of emigrating somewhere. Some Russian and\nsome White Russian people were forced to repatriate to their respective countries. And\nof course, we heard later on that all of them were dr -- went directly to si -- to Siberia.\nAnd Polish people, Czech people, Hungarian and Romanians and the Baltic countries,\npeople were not forced to repatriate, so they just waited. Sit -- sat, vegetated in\nGermany. Developed bad habits like not working, or drinking and waiting for the\nheaven to open somewhere. And eventually, most of us emigrated. Most of us came to\nUnited States, a lot went to Canada and Australia. Some to Great Britain, some to the\nlow countries to get the most menial jobs that nobody else wanted to take. I had a\nfriend who was a black market operator in Wildeflecken camp and when his half a day\na week assignment came, he never showed up. Or else he would pay somebody to go\nand do his shoveling or splitting the wood. Eventually, he was called to a camp\nadministrator who was -- who was American -- who was American lady. And he was\nquestioned and said mer -- she said, \u201cMr. So and so, I heard that you have not gone\nlast week and this week to -- to your assigned work. What is the matter with you?\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cLady, that\u2019s a lie. They are schmearing me. I have never went to wor --\nbegun to work. I have never yet did any work. I pay people to work for me.\u201d \u201cWell,\nhow can you afford it?\u201d \u201cWell, see, I\u2019m great black market operator. And I\u2019m lucky\nbecause I never get caught.\u201d So that wa -- she laughed and she let him go. By the way,\nthe administrator of Wildeflecken camp was Miss Catherine Hulme, H-u-l-m-e. And\nthere is a beautiful book written by her about the Wildeflecken camp. It was called,\n\u201cThe Wild Place.\u201d It was published in 1950\u2019s and I had had a copy and I loaned it to\nsomebody, never got it back. Has been out of print since about 1960\u2019s and I can\npresume that the museum might have a copy. If they don\u2019t, they should really search\nfor it and find it. She was a good writer, especially when she wrote about Mrs.\nCaptain. There was a tough underground captain, lady from Polish underground army,\nwho ran a block -- a barrack -- probably couple hundred former prostitutes. She put\nthem all on a -- on a s-straight and narrow. None of them ever did any trade in\nWildeflecken when -- when the Mrs. Captain was there. She was just like a god, like a\nblock as -- altester in a concentration camp. Watch out, don\u2019t cross Mrs. Captain. She\nwas an old lady, she was big, she was bowlegged. She -- when they had a parade, she\nwould walk ahead of her troops. She was a --",
        "A: No, sh-she ran the group -- I mean, she supervised a group of former prostitutes.",
        "A: Those were her troops.",
        "A: She had trained them, she had uniformed them and she d-dared them, \u201cAny of you\nto play your trade, you are going to be brained.\u201d And when they marched down the s --\ndown the street in a parade, you could -- I mean, you could just hold your stomach and\nlaugh because she was kind of biggish and she had very bowlegged legs and she had\nthe army boots on and she had very short army skirt. She was a sight.",
        "A: Because Wildeflecken means the wild place.",
        "A: Yeah, Wildeflecken is the wild place in Germany.",
        "A: Nine out of 10 hours were lighthearted. Everybody was drunk with freedom.\nEverybody was completely intoxicated with freedom. When you thought back what\nwas there before and what was then, it was just unbelievable. And when we talked or\nwhen I reflected occasionally, I saw myself in Gusensfie, getting off the train and\nwalking under the viaduct to the tunnel, to dig and work. And over the viaduct,\npassing trains would be going on and people standing in the windows, leaning out of\nthe windows, eating and drinking and billing -- being free. And saw those beautiful\nGerman, blonde girls leaning out and looking on them and you heart was so sick\nlooking at that freedom those people had and looking at yourself, that you were going\n-- may be killed today or tomorrow or starve to death or drowned tonight by a capo or\nha -- you head to -- was -- to -- bashed in that night by another capo. So then\nfrequently, when you later on thought about this and about what was then, after\nliberation, you just were completely intoxicated with that freedom.",
        "A: A lot of people did. Lot of people shared. Some people couldn\u2019t. And many of us\nwere quite abnormal. We hoarded food. We picked up every scrap of everything on\nthe street. Even now, when I walk down the street and I see a penny, or a piece of\npaper, or an old shoelace, I pick it up. We just hoarded everything, because well, you\nnever know. Maybe tomorrow you are going to be hungry or maybe I want to tie my\nshoes and I wouldn\u2019t have anything to tie them with. And most of us kind of outgrew\nit and adjusted. At least, I hope I adjusted. I have some strange custom and habits and\nthoughts occasionally, but I don\u2019t rave and don\u2019t -- well, don\u2019t seem to be abnormal. I\nhad a wife who lives with me forever and she somehow stands me. But many of us\nbecame quite abnormal. I think I mentioned previously a father of a young girl I met\nhere, who came to talk to me about the life there and I discover later on that he was a\nJewish man. And I told her that she should ask him to tell her what happened to him.\nHe survived the whole war in a Polish forest with a group of partisans, or by -- and by\nhimself. He does not want to talk about it, not a word. He doesn\u2019t want to talk, so I ask\nher to wor -- \u201cWell, ask him to write it down.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to write.\u201d\n\u201cWell, ask him to write in Polish.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to write in Polish.\u201d \u201cWell,\nhow about Yiddish?\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to write it Yiddish.\u201d He\u2019s completely\nilliterate and he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. After all that time.",
        "A: Yes, I took a st-steno course in Ashafenberg just before I left and just before I left, I\napplied for a steno job with the police or the camp administrator office. And my best\nfriend, Captain Psheckfass, who was a police commander there, he negated my\napplication. Then, when we were transferred to Wildeflecken --",
        "A: He thought I was too foxy. He knew a little about my document washing, or else he\nhad heard a rumor about my document washing. He was afraid if I have access to\ndocuments, especially to the copies -- I mean, to the f -- blanks of documents, I may\nsneak some out. By -- when I -- when we moved to Wildeflecken, he tried to do the\nsame thing, but he was overruled by Captain Jaigiss, who was a liaison officer with the\nAmerican army. And Mr. Jaigiss made he -- me his personal stenographer and he put\nme into the investigation -- into crime office. Made me into a great detective, which I\nwasn\u2019t.",
        "A: They knew that I was a former prisoner. They didn\u2019t know anything about my\nresistance work.",
        "A: I did not. Occasionally I mentioned that I did some work before I was arrested.\nEspecially, I -- well the -- they di -- \u201cYou got arrested, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWell, yes.\u201d \u201cDid\nyou steal a car? Did you steal a chicken?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, yes, something like that.\u201d But\nthere was no time to brag about that time. But later on, when they asked questions, I\nmentioned that I served in Polish underground. And especially in 1948, when I was in\nWildeflecken, a British man came -- missions were coming, visiting camps and British\nman came for a visit and I was in the office and he came in the office and we\nrecognized one another.",

And he said, \u201cWell, not much I can do for you, but I\nreread your reports just recently and your little group did as my -- as much damage as\nmy brigade -- OSS brigade did. So Ill do something.\u201d And he actually did. The Polish\nauthorities in Great Britain sent me a form to fill out and they wanted to give me\nPolish vertudtimilitary and I sent them a letter back, telling them what to put it in,\nwhere to stick it. Because, when we were fighting in Poland, they did not want to give\nany help to that part of underground that I was in. And later on they wanted to share in\nthe glory.",
        "A: The Polish government in exile in Great Britain. They helped only the Akar, the\nhome army. They did not -- did not want to help the NSZ, because we -- we were the -\n- well, kind of perhaps, according to them, chauvinistic group. They didn\u2019t want to\nhave much to do with us. They would accept our reports. They would accept our\nreports, especially my group and two other groups, they would accept the reports and\nsend -- and give them to the British authorities, but they would not help us.",
        "A: Plastic explosives. Some arms and ammunition, especially British sten guns. They\nwere very, very good, they were almost as good as the German schmizers. We did not\nget any -- get any out of them. We did get some occasionally, but it was buying,\nstealing, smuggling.",

        "A: Well, sometimes it was kind of difficult to go against your own and for the\nGermans, but this wa-was not the war any more. That was freedom, that was a free\ncountry and a perpetrator is a perpetrator and consequently, you -- you don\u2019t feel\nguilty about sending them to jail. Also, very few of them went to jail. Many of them\nwere kept in a -- in a camp jail for a few weeks, few months, but they were not sent to\nGerman prisons. And there were some very humorous things occasionally, like for\ninstance, a group of boys went and they stole a cow. And they made the cow walk to\nthe fifth floor, into the attic. They slaughtered it and were selling the meat. Somebody\nreported them and of course, I was assigned to it. I grabbed three policemen and we\nwent up and we looked and we searched the whole block, we couldn\u2019t find 1t.

And he said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you\nlike to work as an investigator?\u201d I said, \u201cWell gee, sounds interesting.\u201d So I kind of\ndrifted into it. And then especially, shortly after I drifted into it, the CIC people came\nand talked to me, asked me if I would like to work part time for them.",

So I\nstopped and he said, \u201cNevermind, nevermind, I\u2019Il just sit here, keep talking.\u201d So I kept\ntalking and then after I had that person sign his testimony -- I think 1t was a witness --\nand leave, and said, \u201cWould you like to work for us?\u201d \u201cDoing what?\u201d \u201cWell, you\nknow, catching the German criminals -- Nazi criminals and questioning them, would\nyou like to help us?\u201d \u201cOf course, but only part time, cause I\u2019m working full time here,\nI get paid here.\u201d \u201cOkay, Pll call on you.\u201d So, every fi -- week, every two weeks, they\nwould take me away for a day or two.

Some of the -- who were\nquestioned, were of Polish German -- so Polish descent, so they gave me those\nespecially to -- to question. So I would spend five, eight, 10 - 15, up to about 20 hours\ntalking to them and, \u201cWell, you know, your method works.\u201d \u201cOf course it does.\u201d Give\nthem lot of water or coffee.

Or go and talk to that person and tell him that, \u201cYou will\nbe taken to West Germany, do you want to go willingly?\u201d Many of them went\nwillingly, because by that time, life in East Germany was bad.

        "A: Well you -- you tried to question this person as a person, but you felt about him like\na vermin. In my case, I knew what happened -- what was done to me by mine\ninterrogator and two or three of his henchmen, who beat the biyesus out of me. And\nyou -- you could see that those people might have done, so you question them and\nquestion them and question them and if there were any witnesses, you questioned the\nwitnesses and you confronted them with the witnesses and you felt like bashing their\nheads in, but of course, you were not allowed to touch them, so you kept them for 18\nhours talking and you give them a lot to drink and, \u201cI want to go to the bathroom.\u201d\n\u201cForget it. You go to the bathroom when I tell you to go to the bathroom.\u201d It didn\u2019t\nfeel so great. You didn\u2019t feel good humiliating them, but you felt like doing it. You felt\nlike that was your duty to -- to really find out if he is innocent or if he really was guilty\nand if turned out that he really couldn\u2019t prove anything against him, that you felt bad\nbecause you mistreated the person.

It was next impossible of punishing them, except\nsending them to the holy inquisition. Putting them in a wheel to stretch their arms,\nbreak their joints and so on and so forth. And of course, nobody was allowed to do\nthat. There was one American, Captain Bollack, he was from Hammtrack, Michigan.\nHe would get occasionally short tempered and he would hit wildly.

        "A: It wasn\u2019t any worse than it was in a -- in normal, general population. At the\nbeginning maybe it was little worse, because there were a lot of young, unattached\npeople who paired on and paired off, but the influence of the Catholic church was very\nstrong in the camp. There were priests, there were chapels, there were churches. And\npeople went to Confession, people went to Communion. People went to Mass. Hardly\nanybody ever missed a Mass, except some hooligans who thought the -- there was few\nconcentration -- former concentration camp inmates who lost belief in God, because\nthey said, \u201cIf something like this happened, God does not exist.\u201d But very, very few,\nso it wasn\u2019t much worse than anywhere else. And, since li -- people lived in such a\nclose proximity, you know, five, six, seven, well, the room I was in was smaller than\nthis room. One room, there were five of us living in 1t.

Everybody knew everything about everybody else.\nSo, if something happens, well, watch out, you get deported and a priest would come\nto talk to you and say, \u201cYou inferial so and so, you better not do it.\u201d Well, some\npeople lived together and it was -- that was kind of almost semi-accepted. They are\nlonely, they have nobody else, they have somebody to take care of them. And many\npeople who were supposed to be leaders or else people to give good example, or\npeople to enforce the proper behavior, did not behave properly themselves.

Beautiful, young girl who just got\nout of medical school. She volunteered to go and she was in Forheim sanitorium, she\nwas my doctor. We became very friendly, she -- we went on a trip, she me --\nrequisitioned a Jeep. We went to see her family, stayed for a week, 10 days in\nVersailles, outside of Paris, saw the sights, came back. When I went to a different\nsanitorium, well, she came to see me a few times, but nothing developed. And, I don\u2019t\nknow. All my childhood, I always was very fond of girls, just extremely fond of girls.\nI always had three steady ones and maybe two extra. After the war, I was, for a long --\nsome time, very friendly with a Russian girl, then I was quite friendly with the Italian\ngirl. Then, when I came to Wildeflecken, a lady secretary in the next office, said,\n\u201cBanya Stefanya, why don\u2019t you come and visit us?\u201d \u201cWell, P\u2019Il be glad to visit you,\nbut why should I come and visit you?\u201d \u201cWell, I have a beautiful daughter.\u201d \u201cOh, when\ndo I come?\u201d So, of course it was -- it -- Good Friday came and she said, \u201cWell, why\ndon\u2019t you come tomorrow\u201d?

        "A: I felt very lucky to be able what I did. And apparently, people who -- people who\nhelped me apparently thought that I was worth a little.

I had people who fought with the Polish\nlegion during Napoleonic wars. I had forefathers who had served in diplomatic service\nand were active. I had my father, who wore -- fought in the first World War on three\nfronts. He fought with the Russians against the Prussians and with the Prussians\nagainst the French, with the -- with the French and Polish against the Germans. So I\nguess, if it wasn\u2019t inborn, at least I could think back about it and act accordingly.\nDidn\u2019t want to be bystander. And of course, my ego was enormous.

        "A: Polish people in the first place, are very contrary. Also very disputatious. You\nwould say -- have four Poles dis-discussing certain set of ideas. They would have\nseven ideas and nobody gives. Consequently, when we get hit, we hit back hard.\nPoland, in history, was overran many times by neighbors who were 10 times more\npowerful. Poland was divided and subdivided by three neighbors who were -- each one\nwas three times as big as Poland and being under occupation of Prussia, Austria and\nRussia, Poland had, oh my God, probably half a dozen really heavy uprisings and\nprobably dozen and a half of smaller uprisings. They were being killed, they were\nbeing hung, they were drowned, they were sent to Siberia. They were -- spent time in\nMagdaburg -- German citadel prison. Polish -- creator of Polish state, after first World\nWar, Marshall Pisoutski spent couple years in a German prison in Madgaburg. So, we\nkind of thought that we are the fighting people and we tried to prove it. Most of the\ntime we did not succeed, at times we did. That was probably kind of loyalty to -- to\nyour state, loyalty to your nation, especially, and acting upon it. And probably most of\nthe -- most of it is that we are qu -- we were quite foolhardy. When I corresponded\nwith my first cousin, who spent about 10 years in a Communist prison -- after she was\nreleased, we wrote to each other before she died. I said, \u201cWell gee, why didn\u2019t you go\nout and fight [indecipherable] And she said, \u201cWe have grown now.

Also, I could write and read English\nquite well by then, but before I left, my British girl teacher said, \u201cWell, you are going\nto America. Those people haven\u2019t spoken English for last couple hundred years. You\nwill have a hard time with them.\u201d I did, for about six months. We swallow a lot of\nsuffixes, we don\u2019t enunciate properly. We -- We garble sentences, according to the\nBritish. It took about six months to adjust to American English.

And the lady of the house made a big supper. Was a\nmeat roast and a lot of potatoes. And they had big, black olives. And I was sure those\nwere plums, so I took quite a few. And I can\u2019t stand olives. At that time I didn\u2019t know\nwhat olives were. I still can\u2019t stand olives. And I choked in and ate those three, huge,\nblack olives. I just didn\u2019t dare to put them back. So I choked them in. I almost felt -- I\nfelt sick after eating those -- those -- those big plums.",

And I mow the grass\nand I made my 50 -- first 50 cents. Next door lady was cleaning a house. I went, help\nher clean it up and I took her carpets out and put them on a fence and beat the carpets\nand I made whole 50 cents, big 50 cents piece. And my neighbor was a post --\nmailman. And he was making the lordly sum of 50 dollars a week. And I said, \u201cOh my\nGod, if I ever make 50 dollars a week in America, I will never want any more.\u201d Ha.\nAnd then, about a week later, I met -- well, few days later I went to Polish American\nclub and made -- make -- made-- met some local people. There was one person who\nsaid, \u201cWell, I'll take you with me. Come tomorrow morning.\u201d So he took me to his\nfactory. It was a cabinet shop. It was a casket company. He said, \u201cErnie, the man who\nowns it and runs it, is an old Deutschman, so I\u2019Il let you talk to him.\u201d So I went and\nspoke to Ernie, who was a Mr. Rife, a very dignified old gentleman.

He employed people\n-- some of his people in their -- in their 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, who slept most of the time,\ndidn\u2019t produce very much. So, the place got broke.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: So Mr. Rife, after he closed the place, he kept the superintendent there, and me for\nabout six more months, liquidating the place. We were cleaning up, taking stuff out.\nHe had in his office a Indian and first American artifacts, probably more than the\nScience Museum had in Minnesota. So he donated most of the stuff there and some of\nit he took to his ranch that he had in Wisconsin, or to his big home in north Saint Paul.\nAnd eventually he had to let me go and gave me a memento or two. So that was my\nfirst job.",
        "A: And then --",

        "A: Gandy dancer is the person who fixes up the track when you lay a new tie under the\nrail, it is loose. So you keep pouring crushed rock and keep -- and you put your heavy\nshovel among the crushed rock and you hold it up or top with your hands -- the top of\nthe shovel. And you put your foot on the shovel down below and press on it and you\nrock back and forth, back and forth, pushing the stone under the tie, so eventually the\ntie becomes tight against the rail. So people doing this kind of work were called gandy\ndancers. I was a gandy dancer on a railroad section for almost a year.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t dislike it. It was healthy, it was outdoors. Although, when Minnesota\nwinter came, it was a little oppressive. When I was coming to Minnesota, I thought it\nwas wine country, because Minnesota in the same parallel that is Matz in France,\nwhich is a wine -- wine -- Champagne country. When I came here, I found Minnesota\nto be identical to Poland. Same summer, same winter except in Minnesota, winter is\nmonth and a half longer.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t feel isolated at all, because all the newcomers are going once a ni --\nweek -- a night -- one night a week to the International Institute, which is in -- well,\nit\u2019s kind of all over the United States, who teaches English to foreign born and helps\nthem to gain citizenship if they\u2019re interested. So then I met a lot of Polish Ukrainian\nRussian boys and girls who came almost the same time or just about that time. Many\nof them bought cars, so we would go get into cars and we would go to the park and\nplay tennis and go swimming and go girls -- girls chasing and do all kind of guy stuff.",
        "A: Not really. No, sometime I felt intimidated. But I haven\u2019t met anybody who would\nmisstate me. My boss at work in the casket company would call me, \u201cHey you,\ngreenhorn, come on here. Do this and do that.\u201d But he was kind of a tough fellow, but\nhe was goodhearted. Next hour, he would come and give me half of his sandwich and\nsay, \u201cCome on, hide over there and eat it, because you look hungry and you so skinny.\nWhy don\u2019t you eat some more?\u201d And I never felt mistreated by anybody. Later on,\nwhen I developed -- learned my halfway decent English and did get my present job, I\nfelt, you know, good about myself, because there were people who did not have as\ngood a job as I had, even though I was always paid poorly and still am. But I did not\nmake here to make fortune. I came here to gain freedom. I wake up in the morning and\nI think about it, I say, \u201cMan, I feel so free.\u201d\u201d Which I do. And say a prayer.",
        "A: Occasionally, but very seldom. Occasionally when I -- I do go and give talks to\nschools -- high schools, colleges and places -- groups of people, I\u2019Il talk about the\nHolocaust -- about the war time, and so on. I have flashes occasionally after that, and\nthat -- until we met last time in May, whenever I went to give a talk, I had some\nsleepless nights after that, you know, the things were coming back. But when we\ntalked for six and a half or seven hours last May, I said, \u201cOh my God, I won\u2019t be able\nto sleep for next two weeks.\u201d You know, I slept like a log. It must have been\ntherapeutic. And things hardly ever flash back. Occasionally -- occasionally, I think\nabout people who were worthy of survival, worthy of a good life, but did not make it.\nA lot of them.

We\ninvite 15 Mung people and maybe five or six would show up. But also, 47 may show\nup. So one time, we had invited about 15 and I think we had about 40 - some. Kids\nrunning all over and they were so well behaved. I mean, you could -- I mean,\nneighbors didn\u2019t complain, nobody di -- did anything. We had games and we had a lot\nof food and the kids went in the backyard and watched the ducks and did all kind of\nthings. And we still meet some of the -- those Mungs.

And\nthat\u2019s mostly the pla -- those other places that invite me to come and talk to them about\nit. So that is somewhat gratifying. But, for a long time, people were very uninformed\nabout. Also, throughout all the time previously, and now, very well educated people,\nlike for instance, college professors, tried to disprove that the Holocaust ever existed.\nThere\u2019s a group of professor that\u2019s UCLA, who are very vocal about it, telling\neverybody who wants to listen and everybody who doesn\u2019t want to listen that\nHolocaust never existed, that was just a concoction made by certain groups of people,\ntrying to influence us this way or that way.",
        "A: Well, if I had them nearby, I would feel like bashing their heads in, or telling them\noff and since I have never met one who would voice that kind of opinion, I do feel\nupset. But we have people who are stupid, we have people who are prejudiced. We\nhave pe-people who are hateful and also people who are uninformed or misinformed.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m somewhat satisfied that what I did was not in vain. Also, I grieve greatly\nover those who -- who perished and I\u2019m very grateful for having been able to survive\nand I frequently pray about it. And if it did me -- if it made me a better person or not, I\ndon\u2019t know. As I previously mentioned, I have never lost my faith and in most\ncircumstances, I am trying to be halfway good Christian. And at times I\u2019m not satisfied\nwith it, but I have to be.",
        "A: No, I think we talked blue streak, forever and a day and I really don\u2019t know what\nelse I could add that would except -- I add to it, except that I\u2019m really glad I survived. I\nam so grateful being able to live in a good, free country that with all it\u2019s mishaps as --\nand -- and thing that happen that are not great and not savory, still is a great, free\ncountry that lives up to it\u2019s ideals.",
