        "A: My name is Regina Gelb, born Laks, in Starachowice, Poland, December 16th, 1929.",
        "Q: And you can look at me, rather than right into the lens? Okay?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: We're really going to start where you want. You said you didn't have any particular vivid\nmemories of when you first arrived in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Well, you wanted to talk about Auschwitz? I will just add perhaps, I arrived in Auschwitz\nfrom a labor camp in Starachowice.",
        "A: I am the youngest of three sisters. My older sister Anna\u2019, my second sister Chris, and I were\nin the same wagon coming from the work camp in Starachowice, while our father was in an\nadjacent wagon with the men, also out of the camp in Starachowice. Mother was no longer\nwith us, because she was taken away two years prior while the town, Starachowice, was\nbeing cleared of Jews. When we arrived in Auschwitz, our basic existence consisted of\npractically the same route so to say, as those other people who had arrived from\nStarachowice camp. Namely, we were tattooed right at the station. We were fortunate\nenough to stand in line so as to get consecutive numbers. My older sister received the first,\nmy middle sister the next, and I received the third. Because we then realized, that if we are to\nbe given numbers, we will probably be referred to as numbers from now on. And every time\na number is called, we might be lucky to have it called in sequence and remain together.\nAuschwitz basically was the same as I said for the women, the same experience. We were in\nquarantine for a month. We were doing work that was no work. It was just carrying a rock\nfrom one end of the camp to the next, and back, just in order to exhaust us. The food was\nawful, it was meager. We stood on roll call.\nAll the things that were happening to the Starachowice group of women was happening to\nus. In October 1942, October 27th to be precise, there was a general round up of everybody\nin town. The Germans came around knocking heavily on the doors, \u201calle raus\u2019,\u201d and we\nwere supposed to go to the square. Mother was in the house at the time with my father and I.\nMy two older sisters were not in the house at the time, because they secured a job in one of\nthe brick factories in town. And they were working on the night shift. Therefore they were\nkept over. Nobody was let out of the factories in Starachowice for the selection. Only people\n' Anna Wilson\n; Everybody out (German)\nwho remained in the houses were chased out. I remember that I was a very, very skinny kid,\nand tall, but very slim. And my mother made me \u2014 she made me heavier, and she put breasts\non me out of some rags, and she gave me rouge to make me look older and more mature.\nAnd I remember we did put on more clothing then necessary, even though that was \u2014 that\nwas October, and it was still rather warm. Because we really didn't know where we were\ngoing. And when we came \u2014 we were driven, there were already a lot of auxiliary German\npolice, and the Latvians \u2014 who were helping out, and the Ukrainians \u2014 who were helping out\nat that particular time of the round up. And I do remember seeing horrible things on the way\nto the market place where the selection was to take place. They would grab children, and\nsmash them against walls. And people who couldn't move fast enough were beaten\nmercilessly. And when we finally reached the market place where the selection was to begin,\nmy mother noticed a lady who was an older lady, who was \u2014 she was very friendly with.\nAnd she was sort of helping her out. The lady's name was Kazimierska, Mrs. Kazimierska.\nAnd she was elderly, and couldn't walk too well, and mother took her by the arm and stood\nwith her. My father of course was pointed to the group where the men were. And I was\npointed \u2014 I was near my mother. But mother was pointed with Mrs. Kazimierska 1n this other\ngroup, and I was pointed in another group. Obviously, I had no idea who was in which\ngroup. Soon enough we were put in a formation, and made to walk.\nAnd we walked -- I was of course walking with the women. And we came to a camp called\nStrzelnica, that was within the premises of the Starachowice area, where the Nazis were\nestablishing a work camp for slave labor. Because in that town there was a munitions factory\nrun by the Germans for which they needed forced labor. When we arrived in Strzelnica, in\nthat camp Strzelnica I soon discovered that mother was not there. Only father was there.\nBecause we were grouped men and women separately. I had no idea where my two sisters\nwere, but I did know that if they are \"gainfully,\" quote unquote, \"occupied\", they would be\nsaved. Well, we subsequently found out \u2014 and when I mean subsequently, I mean many\nyears later after the war \u2014 that the selection that took place in Starachowice was destined for\nTreblinka, and that is where my mother perished. Very soon my two sisters were sent to\nanother camp within the Starachowice area, and that camp was called Majowka. And now,\nthe Nazis were running two separate camps. One was Majowka, and one was Strzelnica.\nMost people were employed in the munitions factory. The highest echelon of the camp were\nthe Germans, and everybody else taking care of us were the Ukrainians. They were the\nguards, they were the people who conducted the convoys going to work, and from work.\nAnd they were brutal, absolutely brutal. Well, I don't quite remember how long the camp\nStrzelnica existed. I do know that the typhus \u2014 a terrible typhus epidemic broke out, that I\nhad typhus. But I do remember subsequently these two camps were joined. And this is where\nI got reunited with my two sisters and my father. And from that point on, until late in July of\n1944, where the entire single Majowka camp was resettled in a smaller camp which was\nadjacent to a railroad track. We were together, meaning the women, on the women's side, but\nwe were able to see our father. And personally, I was terribly dependent on my sisters,\nbecause I absolutely and truly had no initiative and I had no idea of how to behave in those\ncircumstances, or what to behave. I truly gave myself up to their care, and they became my\nsurrogate mother in really more than one way.\nFrom that last camp, which did not really last too long, we were loaded on to the trains that\nwere brought there and shipped to Auschwitz. We arrived in Auschwitz on that railroad\nstation in Auschwitz. It was either the end of July, or very early August of 1944. As we were\nbeing unloaded we realized when we stood on the platform, our train was adjacent to the\nmen's train in which my father was. And we still saw our father on that railroad platform and\nhe saw us. And that was as I said, probably the beginning of August. We never saw our\nfather again after that. And we found out after the war from people \u2014 we never saw our father\nagain after that.\n[Pause in proceedings |",
        "Q: Can you go back a couple sentences? You got off the train.",
        "A: We got off the train, and our wagon happened to be adjacent to the wagon in which the men\ntraveled. So, when we were discharged from the train onto the platform, we did notice our\nfather in that group of men who descended from the adjacent train, and that was the last time\nwe saw our father. He was taken into Auschwitz with the men, we went with the women.\nAnd after the war we found out that father totally lost his \u2014 you have to answer?",
        "Q: Just wait.",
        "A: It's all in a days work. I'm sorry.\n[Technical conversation |",
        "Q: Okay. Let's just go from what you learned about your father after the war. What happened to\nhim?\n[Technical conversation |",
        "Q: You remember the tapes of the apple?",
        "A: You know the most amazing thing to me 1s, I am very particular about cleanliness of food. I\ndon't even eat in restaurants, unless I come in and smell the place, and look it over. And of\ncourse the apple, that was the apple \u2014 I hadn't seen an apple I'm sure for a few years. And this\nwas the absolute find. And I always say to myself, \u201cHow was it that I ate that core, that\nleftover core without thinking: Who ate it? Who threw it away? Who spat on it? What dog\nmade on it?\u201d",
        "Q: It\u2019s called \u201cstarvation.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, well\u2014\n[Pause in proceedings |",
        "A: The job for which we were picked was in Brzezinka within the confines of Auschwitz in a\nself-contained unit called Effektenkammer\u2019. That unit consisted of a warehouse, which kept\nin very specifically assigned bags, numbered bags, the personal belongings of the political\nprisoners \u2014 non-Jewish, political prisoners \u2014 who were imprisoned in Auschwitz. We were to\nguard it with our lives almost, because there wasn't ever anything to be missed, or mislaid.\nThere was to be no pin transferred from one place to another. Those were bags that were\nhung up on racks with numbers. And whenever a political prisoner perished, his personal\nbelongings were packed 1n a box. We were taught how to package it, and mail it out. This\njob was absolutely a godsend. In the first place, we were a totally self contained unit,\nseparated from everything else by barbed wire. We lived indoors and worked indoors. We\ndid not have to go to the marshes anymore. We had a kitchen that cooked whatever meager\nprovisions there were, but at least 1t wasn't the same kind of starvation diet that was\nprevailing at the camp proper. And the unit was run basically by Polish women, Christian\nwomen. And apparently the 30 women who were dismissed from this job, who were\nreplaced, because there was some contact with them and the Polish underground. So\nactually, somebody's misfortune turned out to be our great, great fortune, because for the\nduration of the stay in Auschwitz \u2014 we're now talking about November or December, very\nbitter cold \u2014 we were spared going to the marshes and standing in the cold water.\nAnd meanwhile of course, January rolled around, and Auschwitz was being evacuated, and\nwe with it. Luckily enough, we were dressed not 1n rags, but we had clothing on us that\ncould keep us warm. And we were then driven on a march toward trains, that were\nsomewhere. There were stations somewhere, but I really don't know. Because at that point\nmuch as I was trying to be very independent, not to be a burden to my sisters, I always knew\nthey were really looking out for my benefit. But right here, I just could not overcome my\nphysical person. Meaning we were marched without stopping, and without sleeping, in the\nsnow. And I completely and totally separated myself in sleep, from the reality, the prevailing\nreality, the march. And my sisters to this day tell me, and I know it for a fact, I never would\n* Personal effects chamber (German); warehouse for confiscated belongings of prisoners.\nhave survived if they had not pulled me through that march. I think that lasted for almost a\nweek. It was day and night. And I remembered the hallucination, that is the only thing that I\nreally remember. There was a white road, and there were trees on both ends, both sides of\nthe road. And it seemed to me like I was in an enclosure, because it was white and dark. And\nthat I was in some kind of an enclosure, that was a total fantasy. But I actually lived that\nfantasy. And as a matter of fact, after a number of hours \u2014 I don't know how many \u2014 when\nwe stopped, everybody was told to relieve themselves right where they stood. And my sisters\ntold me to relieve myself, and I absolutely couldn't. Because you see I was in that other\nreality. And it just did not \u2014 did not yet match up with my physical person. So, that what\nactually happened was, as Chris my sister told me, I slept through that march. And we would\njust fall by the wayside, and stop at barns or whatever it was. Anyway, we finally reached\nthat particular station, or whatever it was, a siding, I couldn't tell. But the trains that we were\nloaded on were cattle trains, but they were open. I forgot the name, I think they are called\ncoal trains, you know. And they were sort of benches on them or on the ground.\n[Telephone rings]\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: And Chris was telling me it was like an overnight type of stop, and they found me. And that I\nremembered. Well, the march from Auschwitz in the middle of January or thereabouts, going\nwest, which was the evacuation of Auschwitz was a horrendous experience for me\npersonally, I fell asleep during it. And I survived only because I was pulled by my two\nsisters, who insisted that I walk. That I sit down when we're told to sit down. Who directed\nmy physical motions as needed. Just so that I would make it through. And actually I do\nremember the hallucinations that I had at that time, where reality was \u2014 the present reality\nwas fiction, and my imaginary reality was the reality according to what which I acted. Be\nthat as it may, that was a horrendously difficult trip because of the winter snow. They were\nkilling people right along the way if you did not march in line, if you sat down for a minute.\nPeople just falling like flies. And we finally made it, whether it was to a railroad siding or a\nstation, I don't know. But there were these cars.",
        "Q: You got hit once, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: I got hit once during the march when we were for the night somewhere or other, they were \u2014\nwe were chased into a huge barn, and everybody was supposed to get in and sleep. At any\nrate, I didn't move fast enough, and I was hit right on the face \u2014 whether it was with the butt\nof the rifle, or with a shoe, or whatever it was \u2014 and I fell down, since I was asleep anyhow. I\njust fell down, and I never moved. And the next thing when I woke up, and the commotion\nstarted, I found myself at the very edge of that big enclosure where as everybody else was\ninside. And I realized that I'm alone. And I had the presence of mind to pick myself up and\nstand at the door, and see who was exiting. And I found my two sisters that way. And of\ncourse I imagined that perhaps my hallucinations lessened because of that short sleep.\nHowever, we did make it to that string of open cars in which we were seated. And the\nfortunate thing that happened was, the snow started falling. And because the car was open,\nwe were covered with the snow. And you know, in every misfortune, there is a good fortune.\nWhile it was cold, we were huddled with a mass of humanity, with women obviously. But\nwe had moisture to drink. We would scrape the snow off the faces, and off the coats, and off\nthe clothes, and eat it. And Chris even reminded me, that we took with us a bit of sugar from\nour last station in Auschwitz and we mixed the sugar together with the snow, and that\nsustained us until we arrived.\nWe did not know where we were going. The train pulled up, we were all covered with snow,\nand there was this big sign that said Ravensbrtick. We never heard of it, at least I didn't. We\nwere unloaded right there on to the snow. Not the platform, but 1t was sort of a snow area,\nand there was no place to go. And we were told to stay there right on the snow. Apparently\nby that time, all the other camps were being emptied, and people were being collected inside\nGermany. And Ravensbrick completely overflowing with humanity, for which they had no\nplace for all these people that were coming in. So, we were held in that area which must have\nbeen some kind of grassy knoll, but this was now covered with snow. And I do remember\nwhen we were finally taken into a tent, when we left, the whole white area was covered with\nfeces and urine of course, because we sat there and people had to relieve themselves. And we\ncame into a huge tent with free standing \u2014 free standing bunks to stay on. It was absolutely\nthe worst, most disorganized of all the German camps that we have seen up to that point,\nbecause there was just too impossible to accommodate all that humanity. Life in\nRavensbrick was absolute hell. There was no work to go to, there was just counting in and\nout, counting and sitting around, and being squashed by people. Finally, they said that there\nmight be transports going out. And as I said before, I had very little to do with my own\nsurvival. But my sisters decided that whatever happened, \u201cIf there is a transport, we've got to\nget on it. Wherever it's going it doesn't matter, because nothing could be worse than this\nparticular situation, which is beyond description.\u201d And so, these trucks came up, and we got\nloaded on. And I don't remember how long we drove, but I guess 1t was quite a number of\nhours because when we arrived we were unloaded in another camp, and that name of the\nplace was Retzow. And that was a totally empty camp. There was nobody there, and they\ntook, I don't remember how many, it was not as big as Auschwitz or Ravensbrick, it was a\nsmall camp.\nAnd because we were among the first to alight from the trucks we were lined up and we\nwere given jobs. And the SS women who were supervising that camp, these camp women\nhad their own lodgings there. We were lucky enough, I got a job as a maid for one of the SS\nwomen to clean her room. My sister from Canada, Anna, was assigned to an office, to clean\nan office. And Chris, I forgot what kind of job she got. But she reminded me of it. That the\nwoman for whom I cleaned her place \u2014 this German woman \u2014 took a liking to me. And she\ndecided she was going to be good to me, and leave me the crust of her bread on a piece of\npaper because she wouldn't come near. She kept leaving it on the table, and the crust of her\nbread on a piece of paper, because she wouldn't come near. And she kept leaving it on the\ntable the crust of bread and going. And one day she asked me if I'm getting the crust of\nbread. And I said, \u201cYes, but I'm sharing it with my sister because she doesn't have a good job\nand could she get a job indoors?\u201d And Chris was assigned to the kitchen. And subsequently,\nbecause they were so unwilling to be mixing in with prisoners, they housed us underneath\nthe office, so that we would not be mixed with the population of the camp, however big or\nsmall it was, for the reason that we wouldn't be bringing lice, or whatever, we would be\nclean to serve them. And this is now April. And I distinctly remember that I found out that\nPresident Roosevelt died. Truly, I just knew that President Roosevelt was some great,\nwonderful president somewhere in America. But somehow one of the prisoners heard on a\nradio or whatever it was, that president Roosevelt died, so I think he died in early April.\nSoon after, the bombing started, the allies were bombing that Retzow camp, because this\ncamp was basically located near some kind of an airfield, or Air Force whatever. And the\nwomen who were brought after us in the trucks that followed were assigned to digging\nditches for anti-aircraft, you see. And so it happened that the bombs were falling ever more\nthicker, and all of a sudden we were told to pack up for the German women, because we\nwere going to leave this camp. Not knowing which way or however. But we had to line up\nagain. Again in formation, except that this time those of us who worked as maids had to\ncarry the belongings of the SS women, because they were also evacuating.\nAnd I remember distinctly, we walked not very long, until we got to a big highway. And\nthere was this most incredible thing. First of all we were handed rations of food from the Red\nCross. It was \u2014 we don't know how, there was Swedish Red Cross was handing out rations.\nAnd these German women were grabbing all the cigarettes, and grabbed all the cigarettes\nand packed them in their own bags. But we had rations. I remember distinctly my first\nsardines came in a can in those rations. As soon as we found ourself on the main highway,\nthere was a totally new \u2014 a new situation for which we were not prepared. Because we really\ndid not know the progress of the war. We were in the eye of the storm, but we never knew\nwhat was happening, of who was winning or losing the war, or how the war was progressing.\nWe just knew the misery of people dying constantly. And we finally knew that President\nRoosevelt had died, but was neither here nor there. Because that did not reflect on our\npersonal reality. We found ourself on that highway, which had civilians, it had cows, it had\nhorses, it had German tanks, it had soldiers in uniform, out of formation. It had soldiers in\nuniform in formation. It had \u2014 it had Polish Christian workers who were working forced\nlabor on German farms during the war, who were also mixed into this mix. And us walking\nwith painted, heavily painted white \u201cX's\u201d. It was a white enamel type paint that they painted\nour clothes. An \u201cX\u201d\u2019 in the front, and an \u201cX\u201d\u2019 in the back, right through my coat. In fact, I had\nthe coat after the war. And when we came back to Poland, I had it redone. It was fantastic\nmaterial, but it had that horrible cross. But anyhow\u2014",
        "Q: What was the cross for? Was it to identify you as\u2014",
        "A: AS a prisoner, yes.\n[Technical conversation |",
        "Q: Did you get anything to eat in Ravensbrtick? Was there food there?",
        "A: Oh, practically nothing. Practically nothing, because it was totally disorganized, you see.\nYou didn't eat in Auschwitz, but you had that water, or watery coffee, or whatever.",
        "Q: You Just told me \u2014 I'm sorry, you were saying in Auschwitz at least what?",
        "A: Well, in Auschwitz though the food was meager, less than meager, it was doled out with a\nsystem. In other words, whatever watery coffee you got in the morning, it was there at all\ntimes. And the same whatever, horrible stuff they gave you that was soup. It was not soup, it\nwas sand and some piece of turnip for a caldron of soup. That was at least what you expected\nto get, and you got. In Ravensbriick, because of the total inhuman influx of people for which\nthey were not prepared, or perhaps they didn't want to plan, or as I said, I did not know the\nrealities of the war to account for that. It was just total hell, disorganized hell. This 1s why we\nreally volunteered for that trip to Retzow, which we didn't know where they was taking us.\nEvery selection was another selection. Every transport could have, as I said, ended in death.\nBut we were desperate enough, and not so much my plans, but my sisters', they made the\nplans, and they decided \u201cbetter out than in for staying.\u201d So when we went to Retzow, we had\nthese indoor jobs, and we didn't freeze anymore. And we sort of recouped our strength to the\npoint again, where we are able to withstand whatever horror was going to come our way.\nAnd when we were driven onto the road when the camp \u2014 the bombing increased, Allied\nbombs increased. And of course maybe someday I'll tell you the reaction to bombing of\npeople in our unit, where different people reacting to bombing all of the time. One was\nwashing herself all the time. One was rubbing her hands. Anyhow \u2014 but that is another story.\nThat is sort of like a vignette that probably -.",
        "Q: No, tell us the story.",
        "A: It's very interesting, because we lived under where we worked, where we served the German\nwomen. We lived under this barrack 1n sort of like a cellar. And every time the bombs started\nfalling, and we somehow had a feeling that things are going to end very soon. And some\npeople, some of the women were petrified, they won't make it.\nOne of them had an obsessive \u2014 completely obsessive kind of a behavior. She would grab a\nbucket of water, and she kept washing herself. It was absolutely unbelievable. And whatever\nmade her do it, and of course some people sat in corners and prayed, and some people sang.\nSome people were singing songs. Some people were having hysterics, because the bombs\nwere So very, very near. And I guess we were affected by it, never thinking that the Germans\nwere probably more scared than we were, because we had by now gone through living hell,\nand this was just one more thing that was in the scheme of things, wasn't such a tremendous\n\u2014 you know, it's not a tremendous problem. It was only bombs, you know, from which you\ndie either way. It isn't starvation, or death, or all this dirt and being eaten by lice and\nbedbugs. This is not the same category. And indeed \u2014 they were indeed scared, because very,\nvery soon after we were evacuated, and found ourselves on the road. Before that as I\nmentioned, we were given Swedish Red Cross rations, and we found ourselves on the road\nwith all that population, with the mix of humanity, of cars, and cattle, and horses, and tanks,\nand Germans, and Poles, and workers, and POWs, and us being marked with a white enamel\ncross on our clothes. Not a cross, it was an \u201cX\u201d rather on both ends. Well, at one point the\nroads were so packed, that the women who were guarding us said we have to sit down,\nbecause there is no way to move. We sat at the roadside.\nAnd meanwhile, they got over to the side to talk with other SS women who were guarding\nother groups. And one of the women, of the girls who served as a maid as I did, who carried\nthe rucksack for the German women said, \"Hey, I speak German very well.\u201d\u2019 She was\nblonde. I think she must have been 20 or 21. A mature girl. She said, \"After all I am blonde,\nand I speak German very well. Why couldn't I impersonate her?\" And the group around her,\nwe were 12 of us around her including her, decided, \u201cYes, in this madness of this mix, how\ncould you tell, except that we had our clothes that was marked?\u201d You see, if we were just in\nregular clothes, we could have mixed as the population, the civilian population. And she\ntook out from the German woman's bag her cape. And they used to wear like a garrison cap,\nyou know, one of those German hats. She put that on, and she said, \"You know what we're\ngoing to do, we're going to detach ourself. I will be your guard. If we're found out, I will say\nwe just got lost in this melee, and I was trying to protect these prisoners, and we just got stuff\nmixed up.\u201d And we slowly slid down like it was like an embankment, 12 of us with this\nHalina. Her name was Halina. I have no idea what her last name was. Perhaps I knew and\nforgot, but her name was Halina. She was a Polish Jewish girl. There were Russian girls, and\nPolish girls, because this was really such along way out of Auschwitz, and out of all these\nselections, that the group was extremely mixed. Anyhow, we slid down that embankment,\nand went into the field. And anyway, the night came, so we decided to stay over and see\nwhat happened. Anyhow, next morning we got up, and we saw some men working in the\nfields nearby.\nAnd we were going that way, not knowing which way, east, west, south, or north. It was just\naway from that road that was now still choked up with all that, and we didn't know where it\nwas going, or what was happening. These men in the field were \u2014 excuse me, Polish POWs,\nChristians who were working on the German farms. And as soon as we got to them, they\ndiscovered that we speak Polish very well, and some of us were Polish Christians, and Polish\nJews, and there was a mixture. And they said, \u201cYou know, there's a house, sort of like a little\nvilla up there. You go there, and tell this woman \u2014 there's a German woman, a servant \u2014 that\nwe sent you and she had to feed you.\u201d And we came in, and sure enough the house was\ndeserted by the owners. But there was this old woman, I don't know how old she was, but\nthere was this woman \u2014 German servant \u2014 and she fed us. And we were just absolutely\nbeside ourself with the surprise of it all. And it was this miracle. Of course we didn't know\nwhat danger faced us. Because we didn't know whether the war ended. This is now the end\nof April. We did not know, this is end of April, 1945. Because we were in Retzow about two\nmonths. So, coming out of Auschwitz in January, into Ravensbrick for two weeks, into\nRetzow you see. So, we are in Ravensbriick about two weeks, and Retzow for about two\nmonths, because now it was the end of April 1944.",
        "Q: '45?",
        "A: Yes, 1945. Excuse me, 1945. We had no idea what was really happening, except all of a\nsudden we noticed Russian uniforms around, and Russian tanks. And not in any victorious\nfashion as you would imagine sometime, \u201cHow am I going to be liberated? Will there be\nflags flying?\u201d It wasn't anything like that. It was the melee of things, and people, and then\nthese Russians. And the following day, or maybe two days later, they came up to that farm \u2014\nthat was rather really like a villa, 1t wasn't an ordinary farm \u2014 and they said, \u201cOh, well that's\ngreat. Here's these women, and they speak Russian, and they speak Polish.\u201d\u2019 And they said,\n\u201cWe're going to be coming back in two days, you're going to work for us.\u201d\u201d Meanwhile, the\nword got around they were raping the women. The Russians girls told us. And as soon as\nthey left, we packed up and we left. We left that so called \u201cparadise.\u201d We were finding out\nnow that the war was coming to an end. But things were very disorderly, and nobody knew\nwhich end was up, and which way was \u2014 which way you should head. We sort of traveled\nwith some of the original 12 women but we scattered, because not everyone had the same\nidea. We knew that our parents did not survive, but my mother came from a very large\nfamily. There were nine children, meaning with families \u2014 nine families. And there was my\nfather's big family, and we were hoping we could get back to Poland as fast as we can. We\nwould at least be able to find people who survived, because my grandmother did not live in\nour hometown you know.\nSo that we decided to go to Poland. So, that the march started again, because we were way\ninside Germany. I think rather very near Hamburg is where Retzow was. Northern Germany,\nthe area generally known as Mecklenburg. So that we had to make our way from\nMecklenburg back east to Poland. So we walked as far as a place that was than called in\nGermany, Schneidemuhl, now it's called as Pila, 1t was in Poland, now it's in Polish territory.\nSo, we were finally able to board a train that was going east. We got on the train. Two\nstations later we were bumped off the train, because soldiers were coming, and they had\npreference. So by the time we got to the Polish town of Bydgoszcz, we must have been in\nand out of trains, waiting to be off one, and on one. And of course we had no idea where we\nwere going. But as long as we were going east, it was in the direction of home. And we were\nplanning on getting back, and see what was happening. Soon, very soon, on one of the trains\nwhen we were finally seated on a train, a gentlemen in uniform came over and he heard us\nspeak Polish. Whether he was a Polish Jew or Russian Jew, I don't know. But he was Jewish,\nin uniform. He said, \u201cI overheard you talk, and say you're going back to Poland. I must tell\nyou one thing. Where do you come from?\u201d We said \u201cStarachowice.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cYou must not\ngo to back to any small town. You will not survive if you do that. What you have to do 1s go\nto any big city. You go to Warsaw, you go to Krakow, or you go to L\u00e9dz.\u201d And we said,\n\u201cHow we going to go to these places where we don't really know the place, and we certainly\ndon't know who is going to be there?\u201d He said, \u201cThis you must do.\u201d But he said he had a\nsister that...\n[Technical conversation |",
        "Q: Did any of you ask the man?",
        "A: Well, the man told us that it's dangerous. The situation is unsettled. This is now early May,\n1945. The war was officially over. But things were in great flux because the armies were\nmoving east and west, west and east. And the population shifts during the war as you know,\nwere such that there was just masses of humanity going from hither to yon and back.\nBecause people were resettled, and uprooted, and whatever else. So, he said that would be\none thing. Another thing, that small towns if you come back, and you might have been a\nperson of means, and had property, that might get in your way. Because you would be\nsuspected of coming to claim your property. If it was real property, or houses, or whatever.\nAnd we said, \u201cWhat are we going to do? We don't know anybody.\u201d He said \u201cNo, you will go\nto Lodz. If you want to go to L\u00e9dz, my sister lives there.\u201d He said he had a sister, and he's\ngoing to give us her address. But basically now, the three big centers had Jewish\norganizations registering people. And it was most important for us to put our name in those\nregistries, and go there and find out -- day after day -- to find out who else signed in.\nBecause that was the way \u2014 you see the Red Cross was handling some of it. But the masses\nof uprooted humanity was such that the Jewish Agency\u2019 set out its own \u2014 its own well\nbureau, its own office to register the returning Jews from the camps. We got to the sister's\nhouse. Sure enough, it was in the evening, her house was packed. People were there like\nherrings, laid out on the floor. Because whoever came back ended up there, and we stayed in\nthat apartment on the stairwell. I remember, even Chris reminded me of it too. We talked\nabout it, we laughed, because that was a real great welcome. We had absolutely no idea\nwhere we were. And it was packed, but people said \u201cWelcome, stay.\u201d\u2019 And they pointed us in\nthe right direction, the Jewish Agency. I think it was the Joint Distribution Committee\u2019, or\nwhatever, the Jewish Agency, or international agency. We signed up, and we went.\nEveryday we were given rations, and you know, provisions to sustain ourselves.\nAnd whether we found it on our own, or they somehow assigned to us a hovel, that was the\nmost incredible place. It was nothing, but it was a roof over our heads. The walls were falling\nin, and it was horrendous. However, we were very lucky to discover that Uncle Alexander\nsurvived. Uncle Alexander was my father's brother. We came from Starachowice, and he\ncame from Radom. His name was Alexander Laks. And Uncle Alexander came to Lodz at\nthe same time we did. So, we were reunited with uncle Alexander, and we formed a\nhousehold. And soon enough Chana came to Lodz, and she joined us, and she was part of the\nhousehold. She became the fourth sister, Chana Tencer, so we formed this provisional\nhousehold. And we did not discover \u2014 we did not find anybody else coming back however,\nuntil Alexander's wife survived in Sweden. She was taken by the Swedish Red Cross out of\none of these camps, because she was also in Auschwitz. So Uncle Alexander stayed with us,\nand went back to Radom. He had property and he was able to secure some funds, and we\nlived with him, and started struggling, and finding jobs and such. Subsequently in Lodz, I\nwent to school. My sisters went to work. They also went to \u2014 paid a visit to Starachowice\nand came back very quickly, because they were threatened also that they were going to be\nkilled if they stayed around. So, that really was the end of our connection to Starachowice.\nWe stayed in Lodz.",
        "Q: Your Uncle Alexander was the only one of the nine brothers and sisters -",
        "A: No. Mother's family was not Laks, mother's family was Tenenblum(ph). My mother's family\nwas a larger family. Uncle Alexander was my father's brother, and my father had two other\nsisters about whom we didn't know anything. One of the daughters of the sister survived in\n* Jewish Agency for Palestine; branch of the World Zionist Organization whose aim is to assist\nand encourage Jews to foster development and settlement of Israel.\n> American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee; Jewish American relief organization founded\nin 1914.\nIsrael, her name is Andzia\u00b0. But my mother had a very big family and nobody survived. And\nwe did find out later she lived in Ostrowiec. And we found out from people that lived in\nOstrowiec, that she taken when Ostrowiec was being cleared of Jews. And my mother's\nyoungest sister, the pharmacist who worked in Lomza. Right before the war she got in a\npharmacy a job in Lomza after she graduated from the University. We never heard of her.\nNobody heard of her, because Lomza was northeast, and that was somehow annexed to\nRussia. And then the Germans came, and the Russians came, and it was back and forth. And\nLomza also had these Jews shipped out to Belzec, I think. But we don't know whether this\nyounger sister of my mothers ever survived the selection. So, Uncle Alexander in our life at\nthat point was the only surviving relative. When my sisters went back, as I said, to\nStarachowice they were threatened, and something terrible already had happened in town\nthat same night when they were there. Two women with children who returned from\nAuschwitz, six and eight year old children, and two women \u2014 they were killed in\nStarachowice that same night my sister came. And of course I did not go. I stayed with Uncle\nAlexander in Lodz. And they went. Of course they did not come back with anything except\nfor some personal gifts that my mother's very dear, dear friend who kept a few mementos,\nwho never even thought she should take things, you know, to hide for us. My two sisters\nwent to her house, and she smuggled them out in the last minute onto the train to get out. So\nthat was the end of our going back. You know, you can't go home again, in more ways than\none. And that was certainly brought home to us at that point, and we stayed on in Lodz, and\nwe eventually went to Berlin, and ended up in the United States. But again, I would like to\nadd at this point, that I have mentioned it before. Not that I was a coward as a child. But I\nhad nothing to do with my own survival you see. It was either chance, or 1t was my mother's\nwonderful wishes for her children to survive. Or whether it was my sisters' efforts to keep us\ngoing, or whether it was the support we gave each other. However it was I survived, it was it\nwas none of my doing. It was the, the merest chance. And the most miraculous thing of that,\nhaving survived all of that, I sort of made peace with my background in the sense that I have\nlearned going through life that people have other horrible life experiences, people who have\nnever suffered in camps. And because I was able to make a life for myself, and still be\neducated in this country, and still be a child in this country, because I still went to summer\ncamp here, I went to high school. I went to college. I graduated from, from college.\nI was working. I was taught Polish at the University. I married an, an American. I have a\nwonderful husband. We've been married for 38 years, and we have two grown sons. The\nhouse was never oriented around anything that was part of my past, in the sense that I still\nhave very close ties to my friends. And always my dearest friends are the oldest friends from\nthese times. I've never denied the Holocaust. I have never ever removed my numbers, though\nI was absolutely almost forced to remove it by some people I knew. And he was a plastic\nsurgeon. In fact my first job in America was as a governess, for a family who went in the\ncountry for \u2014 and he was a plastic surgeon, and he kept telling me, \u201cI will not charge you.\u201d\n\u00b0 Andzia Ptasznik\nOf course those were my childhood days, and really, I was absolutely green about\neverything. And he said, \u201cI won't charge you. I will do a beautiful job for you, and I remove\nyour numbers.\u201d And I said, \u201cAbsolutely not, because that is like brown eyes, is a part of my\nperson, so is this number. It is an indelible thing.\u201d I live with it. I don't regret not having\nremoved it. I cannot say I'm proud of how I survived, or what I survived. It was just part of a\nlife, but perhaps I was young enough to still catch that little bit of \u2014 because my youth was\nlost in Poland you see. And because I was able to recapture some of that childhood in\nAmerica, it somehow made me feel that this is really the life that counts, even though I lost\nmy parents. You know, and it was a terrible loss. So that I don't dwell on it. I talk about it\nfreely as you could see.\nNot that I've rationalized it. I've just analyzed it, and said that, \u201cIf you are going to go\nthrough life once, and if you are going to live with your daily cares and your daily\nexpectations, why dwell on something that was too horrible to even ever recount? Because\nmost of it sounds likes fiction anyhow.\u201d You know that after the war, I had a double set of\nteeth.",
        "Q: How do you mean you had a double set of teeth?",
        "A: My baby teeth never fell out \u2014 and I still had -and my new teeth came in. Because I was\nundernourished, and my development wasn't \u2014 I was a starved child after the war, after all\nwas said and done. I was tall, but skinny, totally underdeveloped. Totally flat, like a board.\nAnd two rows of teeth. And when I went to a dentist in Berlin, he sat me down in the chair,\nand he pulled 12 teeth with his hand. You know, one by one. Because they were really ready\nto come out. But you know, they were \u2014 my physical person, so to say, hadn't yet caught up.",
        "Q: You were 15\u201d",
        "A: Yes. I had baby teeth. And 12 teeth in one setting. And it wasn't even pulling with anything\nbut his bare hand. But of course that's another story. And than of course everything changed.\nAnd I have been back to Poland twice. Once with my husband on a tour, and another one on\nan interpreting job. And I find that I can face it rationally, and think about it rationally. And\nrealize how it fits in the scheme of things of a human life, and I've made peace with it so to\nSay.",
        "Q: You can rationalize?",
        "A: Can I rationalize?",
        "Q: You can rationalize?",
        "A: I can, because this is also the nature of your mentality. I am by nature optimistic and\noutgoing. So, that 1t would not be true to my type to be spending my life regretting what\nhappened, or what didn't happen, or what I went through, or I didn't. I certainly learned a lot\nfrom the experiences, even though they're too horrible to recount. Because human kindness\nin all that horror was also a very great part of my survival. There were people who were\nalways taking pity on me, and I don't know why. It was not only my sisters, but also the\ngoodness of other people helped me through. You know, people would give me a potato, or\nsomething. I don't know if I was such a sorry sight, or whatever. But I survived thanks to\nhuman kindness, and the real great help of my two sisters. Is there anything else that you\nwould like me to elaborate on?",
        "Q: And you're not angry? You're not angry about your parents, how they died?",
        "A: Well, I am not just angry how my parents died.",
        "Q: And how a whole culture died?",
        "A: I am angry what happened to the Jewish people. What horror happened, what unspeakable\nhorror that could not even be described. That could not even be comprehended. That\ngenocide on that scale, that is most unprecedented. My parents were dearest to me indeed,\nbut the thousands and thousands of others. My big extended family they were tremendous\nfamily, and they were such lovely people, and they were such educated people. And I grieve\nfor my parents, indeed I did. And I was wonderful \u2014 terribly attached to my parents. I was\nthe youngest, and rather spoiled, and was very attached to my parents.\nBut as you read history, and study the whole \u2014 the whole scene that has unfolded in the\nsecond war that was never even contemplated, or one step from the next, was the more\nhorrible step from the next. And you never knew who the horror came from, or where the\ngoodness came from, you see. And yet, the other people were not treated the way we were.\nYou see, when I always think of those pillows airing in the windows, where there was real\nnormal life, when we were at the edge of total destruction. And the fact that you had to\nwitness the most animalistic traits of human nature that you would never suspect people\ndisplayed. Because anybody, there were people who felt that they could trample you to death\nif they could grab that one leftover potato, you see. That was on the one hand. You saw the\nbasest nature of the human person at its worst, and than you also saw the most wonderful\nqualities of people; of devotion, and people who shielded you, who cared about you, and\nwho consoled you. And after all, I was a child and I needed a lot of consolation, and a lot of\ngood deeds to push me through, aside from my sisters, who weren\u2019t in such wonderful shape\nthemselves to do it, but they did it. When you assess the \u2014 it was a trauma. But when you\nassess the whole problem, the whole experience of a huma\u2014 of 6,000,000 people you see,\nand than you fit yourself, that one single person who was really a child into that framework,\nit boggles the mind, you see. Therefore, if I chose to contemplate or live that past, I probably\nwould have been a burden forever after. And my only and one desire after we were liberated\nwas to never ever be a burden to anybody. That was one thing, because I realized then I was\nan orphan. And although I was pulled through by my sisters, of course it didn't happen,\nbecause when Miles married Chris, I became another \u2014 a charge of his you see. So, even\nthough I was really always being considered a child, when I came to America I came with a\nchildren\u2019s group, with Miles and Chris, but as a child. All this is fine. But you see again\nhaving that optimistic nature, I felt that grieving over my own past would not get any me\nanywhere. Beside, I had not lived. I had not lived. When I was given a chance to live in\nAmerica, to go to high school, to go to college. Having that wonderful experience to go out\nof town in college, it was \u2014 I just fell in with it. This was just the most wonderful thing I\ncould ever dream about. I guess \u2014 am I angry? I can't tell you whether I'm angry. I grieve\nabout it, and I think about it. But it can't be brought back. But I hope it's going to be forever\nremembered, and prevented from happening again. So that is my only hope. If our\nexperience could teach the world anything at all about human nature, and about how people\ncan be \u2014 how people can actually \u2014 the bestiality of one man to another, if people could just\nlearn that, than my experience was worth it.\nTo have survived to show the world how such a thing could happen, so that it does not\nhappen again. Because if we don't learn from this particular experience, it will probably\nhappen again. It's something to work on, not just to think about. You know, to work on for a\nbetter world. But at this point it doesn't look like it, but who knows.",

        "Q: So there were two incidents that you remember particularly clearly about Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Those were during that particular march from the camp proper to the marshes,\nwhere we were to clear the marshes and the underbrush alongside the river. And because that\nwas a rather lengthy march, in formation with guards guarding us, we did pass quite a\nnumber private dwellings along the way, because we were basically outside of camp.\nWhereas, whether these dwellings were for Germans who were taking care of the camp,\nwhether these were Polish people who occupied it, I don\u2019t know. However, they really were\nprivate homes and on one of the marches I notices pillows airing in the windows. And that\nreally was a very painful moment, because in normal conditions in Poland everybody was\nairing pillows. That was just the thing to do if you lived normal life. And it brought to mind,\nthat here we were in this situation -- having been separated from our parents, forever\nprobably, and being left alone, not knowing of our future, working under most horrendous\nconditions -- and here are people who are still living a normal life, airing their pillows, even\nin such close proximity to the camp where all these horrible things are happening. And\nsomehow or other, that particular scene reminded my mind, because you know how you\nsometimes remain with a picture in your mind, well that was the observation that struck me\nat that time and remained for me ever after. And a similar incident, from that particular walk\n-- march rather, from the camp proper to the marshes and back, which we did everyday while\nwe were working on that, on that job -- is that one day, whether we were going or coming\nback I don\u2019t remember, but I did notice an eaten apple of a core on the ground as we were\npassing. I bent down and picked it up and quickly ate it. And I was myself amazed that I\nhave done it. That I was \u2014 the hunger that overpowered the even second thought, \u201cShould I\npick up this core?\u201d Because after all 1t was on the road and it could have been thrown away\nby some sick person, and it could have been the, the \u2014 god only knows, dogs could have\nbeen over it and whatever. It absolutely never entered my mind. There was this little bit of\napple left on the core and this is what I grabbed and ate.\nAnd I have very often come back to that, to that \u2014 apple core picture, that picture you know,\neven in this day when you are always concerned about hygiene and \u201cunder what\ncircumstances would you do such and such, and not do such and such?\u201d Well that is the\nanswer; I did it without any second thought and that was of course probably the only apple\nI\u2019ve tasted in more than two years at that point and that was \u2014 there was at least the taste of\nthe apple of the real thing, of that real life that of course I was separate from. So these two\nincidents remain very clearly in my mind from this particular work detail in Auschwitz.\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: Many times when I go back to these specific memories, to these specific pictures in my mind\nI always wonder \u201cLiving a world of plenty in America where things are discarded constantly\nand I go back to that episode of that core of an apple, of what that could do to a starving\nperson \u2014 where of course in hindsight and looking from another perspective in a totally\ndifferent age I look at it now I am really most impressed of how life can change your\napproach to things. How life can absolutely move you into another dimension to make you\naware of values of certain things even such as an eaten apple core, which of course today\nyou would not ever consider anything but garbage. Because people though away more things\nthat are not garbage in today\u2019s society that we ever dreamt of.\n"

        "A: My name is Regina Gelb, born Laks, in Starachowice, Poland, December 16th, 1929.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Well, you wanted to talk about Auschwitz? I will just add perhaps, I arrived in Auschwitz\nfrom a labor camp in Starachowice.",
        "A: I am the youngest of three sisters. My older sister Anna\u2019, my second sister Chris, and I were\nin the same wagon coming from the work camp in Starachowice, while our father was in an\nadjacent wagon with the men, also out of the camp in Starachowice. Mother was no longer\nwith us, because she was taken away two years prior while the town, Starachowice, was\nbeing cleared of Jews. When we arrived in Auschwitz, our basic existence consisted of\npractically the same route so to say, as those other people who had arrived from\nStarachowice camp. Namely, we were tattooed right at the station. We were fortunate\nenough to stand in line so as to get consecutive numbers. My older sister received the first,\nmy middle sister the next, and I received the third. Because we then realized, that if we are to\nbe given numbers, we will probably be referred to as numbers from now on. And every time\na number is called, we might be lucky to have it called in sequence and remain together.\nAuschwitz basically was the same as I said for the women, the same experience. We were in\nquarantine for a month. We were doing work that was no work. It was just carrying a rock\nfrom one end of the camp to the next, and back, just in order to exhaust us. The food was\nawful, it was meager. We stood on roll call.\nAll the things that were happening to the Starachowice group of women was happening to\nus. In October 1942, October 27th to be precise, there was a general round up of everybody\nin town. The Germans came around knocking heavily on the doors, \u201calle raus\u2019,\u201d and we\nwere supposed to go to the square. Mother was in the house at the time with my father and I.\nMy two older sisters were not in the house at the time, because they secured a job in one of\nthe brick factories in town. And they were working on the night shift. Therefore they were\nkept over. Nobody was let out of the factories in Starachowice for the selection. Only people\n' Anna Wilson\n; Everybody out (German)\nwho remained in the houses were chased out. I remember that I was a very, very skinny kid,\nand tall, but very slim. And my mother made me \u2014 she made me heavier, and she put breasts\non me out of some rags, and she gave me rouge to make me look older and more mature.\nAnd I remember we did put on more clothing then necessary, even though that was \u2014 that\nwas October, and it was still rather warm. Because we really didn't know where we were\ngoing. And when we came \u2014 we were driven, there were already a lot of auxiliary German\npolice, and the Latvians \u2014 who were helping out, and the Ukrainians \u2014 who were helping out\nat that particular time of the round up. And I do remember seeing horrible things on the way\nto the market place where the selection was to take place. They would grab children, and\nsmash them against walls. And people who couldn't move fast enough were beaten\nmercilessly. And when we finally reached the market place where the selection was to begin,\nmy mother noticed a lady who was an older lady, who was \u2014 she was very friendly with.\nAnd she was sort of helping her out. The lady's name was Kazimierska, Mrs. Kazimierska.\nAnd she was elderly, and couldn't walk too well, and mother took her by the arm and stood\nwith her. My father of course was pointed to the group where the men were. And I was\npointed \u2014 I was near my mother. But mother was pointed with Mrs. Kazimierska 1n this other\ngroup, and I was pointed in another group. Obviously, I had no idea who was in which\ngroup. Soon enough we were put in a formation, and made to walk.\nAnd we walked -- I was of course walking with the women. And we came to a camp called\nStrzelnica, that was within the premises of the Starachowice area, where the Nazis were\nestablishing a work camp for slave labor. Because in that town there was a munitions factory\nrun by the Germans for which they needed forced labor. When we arrived in Strzelnica, in\nthat camp Strzelnica I soon discovered that mother was not there. Only father was there.\nBecause we were grouped men and women separately. I had no idea where my two sisters\nwere, but I did know that if they are \"gainfully,\" quote unquote, \"occupied\", they would be\nsaved. Well, we subsequently found out \u2014 and when I mean subsequently, I mean many\nyears later after the war \u2014 that the selection that took place in Starachowice was destined for\nTreblinka, and that is where my mother perished. Very soon my two sisters were sent to\nanother camp within the Starachowice area, and that camp was called Majowka. And now,\nthe Nazis were running two separate camps. One was Majowka, and one was Strzelnica.\nMost people were employed in the munitions factory. The highest echelon of the camp were\nthe Germans, and everybody else taking care of us were the Ukrainians. They were the\nguards, they were the people who conducted the convoys going to work, and from work.\nAnd they were brutal, absolutely brutal. Well, I don't quite remember how long the camp\nStrzelnica existed. I do know that the typhus \u2014 a terrible typhus epidemic broke out, that I\nhad typhus. But I do remember subsequently these two camps were joined. And this is where\nI got reunited with my two sisters and my father. And from that point on, until late in July of\n1944, where the entire single Majowka camp was resettled in a smaller camp which was\nadjacent to a railroad track. We were together, meaning the women, on the women's side, but\nwe were able to see our father. And personally, I was terribly dependent on my sisters,\nbecause I absolutely and truly had no initiative and I had no idea of how to behave in those\ncircumstances, or what to behave. I truly gave myself up to their care, and they became my\nsurrogate mother in really more than one way.\nFrom that last camp, which did not really last too long, we were loaded on to the trains that\nwere brought there and shipped to Auschwitz. We arrived in Auschwitz on that railroad\nstation in Auschwitz. It was either the end of July, or very early August of 1944. As we were\nbeing unloaded we realized when we stood on the platform, our train was adjacent to the\nmen's train in which my father was. And we still saw our father on that railroad platform and\nhe saw us. And that was as I said, probably the beginning of August. We never saw our\nfather again after that. And we found out after the war from people \u2014 we never saw our father\nagain after that.\n[Pause in proceedings |",
        "A: We got off the train, and our wagon happened to be adjacent to the wagon in which the men\ntraveled. So, when we were discharged from the train onto the platform, we did notice our\nfather in that group of men who descended from the adjacent train, and that was the last time\nwe saw our father. He was taken into Auschwitz with the men, we went with the women.\nAnd after the war we found out that father totally lost his \u2014 you have to answer?",
        "A: It's all in a days work. I'm sorry.\n[Technical conversation |\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: You know the most amazing thing to me 1s, I am very particular about cleanliness of food. I\ndon't even eat in restaurants, unless I come in and smell the place, and look it over. And of\ncourse the apple, that was the apple \u2014 I hadn't seen an apple I'm sure for a few years. And this\nwas the absolute find. And I always say to myself, \u201cHow was it that I ate that core, that\nleftover core without thinking: Who ate it? Who threw it away? Who spat on it? What dog\nmade on it?\u201d",
        "A: Yes, well\u2014\n[Pause in proceedings |",
        "A: The job for which we were picked was in Brzezinka within the confines of Auschwitz in a\nself-contained unit called Effektenkammer\u2019. That unit consisted of a warehouse, which kept\nin very specifically assigned bags, numbered bags, the personal belongings of the political\nprisoners \u2014 non-Jewish, political prisoners \u2014 who were imprisoned in Auschwitz. We were to\nguard it with our lives almost, because there wasn't ever anything to be missed, or mislaid.\nThere was to be no pin transferred from one place to another. Those were bags that were\nhung up on racks with numbers. And whenever a political prisoner perished, his personal\nbelongings were packed 1n a box. We were taught how to package it, and mail it out. This\njob was absolutely a godsend. In the first place, we were a totally self contained unit,\nseparated from everything else by barbed wire. We lived indoors and worked indoors. We\ndid not have to go to the marshes anymore. We had a kitchen that cooked whatever meager\nprovisions there were, but at least 1t wasn't the same kind of starvation diet that was\nprevailing at the camp proper. And the unit was run basically by Polish women, Christian\nwomen. And apparently the 30 women who were dismissed from this job, who were\nreplaced, because there was some contact with them and the Polish underground. So\nactually, somebody's misfortune turned out to be our great, great fortune, because for the\nduration of the stay in Auschwitz \u2014 we're now talking about November or December, very\nbitter cold \u2014 we were spared going to the marshes and standing in the cold water.\nAnd meanwhile of course, January rolled around, and Auschwitz was being evacuated, and\nwe with it. Luckily enough, we were dressed not 1n rags, but we had clothing on us that\ncould keep us warm. And we were then driven on a march toward trains, that were\nsomewhere. There were stations somewhere, but I really don't know. Because at that point\nmuch as I was trying to be very independent, not to be a burden to my sisters, I always knew\nthey were really looking out for my benefit. But right here, I just could not overcome my\nphysical person. Meaning we were marched without stopping, and without sleeping, in the\nsnow. And I completely and totally separated myself in sleep, from the reality, the prevailing\nreality, the march. And my sisters to this day tell me, and I know it for a fact, I never would\n* Personal effects chamber (German); warehouse for confiscated belongings of prisoners.\nhave survived if they had not pulled me through that march. I think that lasted for almost a\nweek. It was day and night. And I remembered the hallucination, that is the only thing that I\nreally remember. There was a white road, and there were trees on both ends, both sides of\nthe road. And it seemed to me like I was in an enclosure, because it was white and dark. And\nthat I was in some kind of an enclosure, that was a total fantasy. But I actually lived that\nfantasy. And as a matter of fact, after a number of hours \u2014 I don't know how many \u2014 when\nwe stopped, everybody was told to relieve themselves right where they stood. And my sisters\ntold me to relieve myself, and I absolutely couldn't. Because you see I was in that other\nreality. And it just did not \u2014 did not yet match up with my physical person. So, that what\nactually happened was, as Chris my sister told me, I slept through that march. And we would\njust fall by the wayside, and stop at barns or whatever it was. Anyway, we finally reached\nthat particular station, or whatever it was, a siding, I couldn't tell. But the trains that we were\nloaded on were cattle trains, but they were open. I forgot the name, I think they are called\ncoal trains, you know. And they were sort of benches on them or on the ground.\n[Telephone rings]\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: And Chris was telling me it was like an overnight type of stop, and they found me. And that I\nremembered. Well, the march from Auschwitz in the middle of January or thereabouts, going\nwest, which was the evacuation of Auschwitz was a horrendous experience for me\npersonally, I fell asleep during it. And I survived only because I was pulled by my two\nsisters, who insisted that I walk. That I sit down when we're told to sit down. Who directed\nmy physical motions as needed. Just so that I would make it through. And actually I do\nremember the hallucinations that I had at that time, where reality was \u2014 the present reality\nwas fiction, and my imaginary reality was the reality according to what which I acted. Be\nthat as it may, that was a horrendously difficult trip because of the winter snow. They were\nkilling people right along the way if you did not march in line, if you sat down for a minute.\nPeople just falling like flies. And we finally made it, whether it was to a railroad siding or a\nstation, I don't know. But there were these cars.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I got hit once during the march when we were for the night somewhere or other, they were \u2014\nwe were chased into a huge barn, and everybody was supposed to get in and sleep. At any\nrate, I didn't move fast enough, and I was hit right on the face \u2014 whether it was with the butt\nof the rifle, or with a shoe, or whatever it was \u2014 and I fell down, since I was asleep anyhow. I\njust fell down, and I never moved. And the next thing when I woke up, and the commotion\nstarted, I found myself at the very edge of that big enclosure where as everybody else was\ninside. And I realized that I'm alone. And I had the presence of mind to pick myself up and\nstand at the door, and see who was exiting. And I found my two sisters that way. And of\ncourse I imagined that perhaps my hallucinations lessened because of that short sleep.\nHowever, we did make it to that string of open cars in which we were seated. And the\nfortunate thing that happened was, the snow started falling. And because the car was open,\nwe were covered with the snow. And you know, in every misfortune, there is a good fortune.\nWhile it was cold, we were huddled with a mass of humanity, with women obviously. But\nwe had moisture to drink. We would scrape the snow off the faces, and off the coats, and off\nthe clothes, and eat it. And Chris even reminded me, that we took with us a bit of sugar from\nour last station in Auschwitz and we mixed the sugar together with the snow, and that\nsustained us until we arrived.\nWe did not know where we were going. The train pulled up, we were all covered with snow,\nand there was this big sign that said Ravensbrtick. We never heard of it, at least I didn't. We\nwere unloaded right there on to the snow. Not the platform, but 1t was sort of a snow area,\nand there was no place to go. And we were told to stay there right on the snow. Apparently\nby that time, all the other camps were being emptied, and people were being collected inside\nGermany. And Ravensbrick completely overflowing with humanity, for which they had no\nplace for all these people that were coming in. So, we were held in that area which must have\nbeen some kind of grassy knoll, but this was now covered with snow. And I do remember\nwhen we were finally taken into a tent, when we left, the whole white area was covered with\nfeces and urine of course, because we sat there and people had to relieve themselves. And we\ncame into a huge tent with free standing \u2014 free standing bunks to stay on. It was absolutely\nthe worst, most disorganized of all the German camps that we have seen up to that point,\nbecause there was just too impossible to accommodate all that humanity. Life in\nRavensbrick was absolute hell. There was no work to go to, there was just counting in and\nout, counting and sitting around, and being squashed by people. Finally, they said that there\nmight be transports going out. And as I said before, I had very little to do with my own\nsurvival. But my sisters decided that whatever happened, \u201cIf there is a transport, we've got to\nget on it. Wherever it's going it doesn't matter, because nothing could be worse than this\nparticular situation, which is beyond description.\u201d And so, these trucks came up, and we got\nloaded on. And I don't remember how long we drove, but I guess 1t was quite a number of\nhours because when we arrived we were unloaded in another camp, and that name of the\nplace was Retzow. And that was a totally empty camp. There was nobody there, and they\ntook, I don't remember how many, it was not as big as Auschwitz or Ravensbrick, it was a\nsmall camp.\nAnd because we were among the first to alight from the trucks we were lined up and we\nwere given jobs. And the SS women who were supervising that camp, these camp women\nhad their own lodgings there. We were lucky enough, I got a job as a maid for one of the SS\nwomen to clean her room. My sister from Canada, Anna, was assigned to an office, to clean\nan office. And Chris, I forgot what kind of job she got. But she reminded me of it. That the\nwoman for whom I cleaned her place \u2014 this German woman \u2014 took a liking to me. And she\ndecided she was going to be good to me, and leave me the crust of her bread on a piece of\npaper because she wouldn't come near. She kept leaving it on the table, and the crust of her\nbread on a piece of paper, because she wouldn't come near. And she kept leaving it on the\ntable the crust of bread and going. And one day she asked me if I'm getting the crust of\nbread. And I said, \u201cYes, but I'm sharing it with my sister because she doesn't have a good job\nand could she get a job indoors?\u201d And Chris was assigned to the kitchen. And subsequently,\nbecause they were so unwilling to be mixing in with prisoners, they housed us underneath\nthe office, so that we would not be mixed with the population of the camp, however big or\nsmall it was, for the reason that we wouldn't be bringing lice, or whatever, we would be\nclean to serve them. And this is now April. And I distinctly remember that I found out that\nPresident Roosevelt died. Truly, I just knew that President Roosevelt was some great,\nwonderful president somewhere in America. But somehow one of the prisoners heard on a\nradio or whatever it was, that president Roosevelt died, so I think he died in early April.\nSoon after, the bombing started, the allies were bombing that Retzow camp, because this\ncamp was basically located near some kind of an airfield, or Air Force whatever. And the\nwomen who were brought after us in the trucks that followed were assigned to digging\nditches for anti-aircraft, you see. And so it happened that the bombs were falling ever more\nthicker, and all of a sudden we were told to pack up for the German women, because we\nwere going to leave this camp. Not knowing which way or however. But we had to line up\nagain. Again in formation, except that this time those of us who worked as maids had to\ncarry the belongings of the SS women, because they were also evacuating.\nAnd I remember distinctly, we walked not very long, until we got to a big highway. And\nthere was this most incredible thing. First of all we were handed rations of food from the Red\nCross. It was \u2014 we don't know how, there was Swedish Red Cross was handing out rations.\nAnd these German women were grabbing all the cigarettes, and grabbed all the cigarettes\nand packed them in their own bags. But we had rations. I remember distinctly my first\nsardines came in a can in those rations. As soon as we found ourself on the main highway,\nthere was a totally new \u2014 a new situation for which we were not prepared. Because we really\ndid not know the progress of the war. We were in the eye of the storm, but we never knew\nwhat was happening, of who was winning or losing the war, or how the war was progressing.\nWe just knew the misery of people dying constantly. And we finally knew that President\nRoosevelt had died, but was neither here nor there. Because that did not reflect on our\npersonal reality. We found ourself on that highway, which had civilians, it had cows, it had\nhorses, it had German tanks, it had soldiers in uniform, out of formation. It had soldiers in\nuniform in formation. It had \u2014 it had Polish Christian workers who were working forced\nlabor on German farms during the war, who were also mixed into this mix. And us walking\nwith painted, heavily painted white \u201cX's\u201d. It was a white enamel type paint that they painted\nour clothes. An \u201cX\u201d\u2019 in the front, and an \u201cX\u201d\u2019 in the back, right through my coat. In fact, I had\nthe coat after the war. And when we came back to Poland, I had it redone. It was fantastic\nmaterial, but it had that horrible cross. But anyhow\u2014",
        "A: AS a prisoner, yes.\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: Oh, practically nothing. Practically nothing, because it was totally disorganized, you see.\nYou didn't eat in Auschwitz, but you had that water, or watery coffee, or whatever.",
        "A: Well, in Auschwitz though the food was meager, less than meager, it was doled out with a\nsystem. In other words, whatever watery coffee you got in the morning, it was there at all\ntimes. And the same whatever, horrible stuff they gave you that was soup. It was not soup, it\nwas sand and some piece of turnip for a caldron of soup. That was at least what you expected\nto get, and you got. In Ravensbriick, because of the total inhuman influx of people for which\nthey were not prepared, or perhaps they didn't want to plan, or as I said, I did not know the\nrealities of the war to account for that. It was just total hell, disorganized hell. This 1s why we\nreally volunteered for that trip to Retzow, which we didn't know where they was taking us.\nEvery selection was another selection. Every transport could have, as I said, ended in death.\nBut we were desperate enough, and not so much my plans, but my sisters', they made the\nplans, and they decided \u201cbetter out than in for staying.\u201d So when we went to Retzow, we had\nthese indoor jobs, and we didn't freeze anymore. And we sort of recouped our strength to the\npoint again, where we are able to withstand whatever horror was going to come our way.\nAnd when we were driven onto the road when the camp \u2014 the bombing increased, Allied\nbombs increased. And of course maybe someday I'll tell you the reaction to bombing of\npeople in our unit, where different people reacting to bombing all of the time. One was\nwashing herself all the time. One was rubbing her hands. Anyhow \u2014 but that is another story.\nThat is sort of like a vignette that probably -.",
        "A: It's very interesting, because we lived under where we worked, where we served the German\nwomen. We lived under this barrack 1n sort of like a cellar. And every time the bombs started\nfalling, and we somehow had a feeling that things are going to end very soon. And some\npeople, some of the women were petrified, they won't make it.\nOne of them had an obsessive \u2014 completely obsessive kind of a behavior. She would grab a\nbucket of water, and she kept washing herself. It was absolutely unbelievable. And whatever\nmade her do it, and of course some people sat in corners and prayed, and some people sang.\nSome people were singing songs. Some people were having hysterics, because the bombs\nwere So very, very near. And I guess we were affected by it, never thinking that the Germans\nwere probably more scared than we were, because we had by now gone through living hell,\nand this was just one more thing that was in the scheme of things, wasn't such a tremendous\n\u2014 you know, it's not a tremendous problem. It was only bombs, you know, from which you\ndie either way. It isn't starvation, or death, or all this dirt and being eaten by lice and\nbedbugs. This is not the same category. And indeed \u2014 they were indeed scared, because very,\nvery soon after we were evacuated, and found ourselves on the road. Before that as I\nmentioned, we were given Swedish Red Cross rations, and we found ourselves on the road\nwith all that population, with the mix of humanity, of cars, and cattle, and horses, and tanks,\nand Germans, and Poles, and workers, and POWs, and us being marked with a white enamel\ncross on our clothes. Not a cross, it was an \u201cX\u201d rather on both ends. Well, at one point the\nroads were so packed, that the women who were guarding us said we have to sit down,\nbecause there is no way to move. We sat at the roadside.\nAnd meanwhile, they got over to the side to talk with other SS women who were guarding\nother groups. And one of the women, of the girls who served as a maid as I did, who carried\nthe rucksack for the German women said, \"Hey, I speak German very well.\u201d\u2019 She was\nblonde. I think she must have been 20 or 21. A mature girl. She said, \"After all I am blonde,\nand I speak German very well. Why couldn't I impersonate her?\" And the group around her,\nwe were 12 of us around her including her, decided, \u201cYes, in this madness of this mix, how\ncould you tell, except that we had our clothes that was marked?\u201d You see, if we were just in\nregular clothes, we could have mixed as the population, the civilian population. And she\ntook out from the German woman's bag her cape. And they used to wear like a garrison cap,\nyou know, one of those German hats. She put that on, and she said, \"You know what we're\ngoing to do, we're going to detach ourself. I will be your guard. If we're found out, I will say\nwe just got lost in this melee, and I was trying to protect these prisoners, and we just got stuff\nmixed up.\u201d And we slowly slid down like it was like an embankment, 12 of us with this\nHalina. Her name was Halina. I have no idea what her last name was. Perhaps I knew and\nforgot, but her name was Halina. She was a Polish Jewish girl. There were Russian girls, and\nPolish girls, because this was really such along way out of Auschwitz, and out of all these\nselections, that the group was extremely mixed. Anyhow, we slid down that embankment,\nand went into the field. And anyway, the night came, so we decided to stay over and see\nwhat happened. Anyhow, next morning we got up, and we saw some men working in the\nfields nearby.\nAnd we were going that way, not knowing which way, east, west, south, or north. It was just\naway from that road that was now still choked up with all that, and we didn't know where it\nwas going, or what was happening. These men in the field were \u2014 excuse me, Polish POWs,\nChristians who were working on the German farms. And as soon as we got to them, they\ndiscovered that we speak Polish very well, and some of us were Polish Christians, and Polish\nJews, and there was a mixture. And they said, \u201cYou know, there's a house, sort of like a little\nvilla up there. You go there, and tell this woman \u2014 there's a German woman, a servant \u2014 that\nwe sent you and she had to feed you.\u201d And we came in, and sure enough the house was\ndeserted by the owners. But there was this old woman, I don't know how old she was, but\nthere was this woman \u2014 German servant \u2014 and she fed us. And we were just absolutely\nbeside ourself with the surprise of it all. And it was this miracle. Of course we didn't know\nwhat danger faced us. Because we didn't know whether the war ended. This is now the end\nof April. We did not know, this is end of April, 1945. Because we were in Retzow about two\nmonths. So, coming out of Auschwitz in January, into Ravensbrick for two weeks, into\nRetzow you see. So, we are in Ravensbriick about two weeks, and Retzow for about two\nmonths, because now it was the end of April 1944.",
        "A: Yes, 1945. Excuse me, 1945. We had no idea what was really happening, except all of a\nsudden we noticed Russian uniforms around, and Russian tanks. And not in any victorious\nfashion as you would imagine sometime, \u201cHow am I going to be liberated? Will there be\nflags flying?\u201d It wasn't anything like that. It was the melee of things, and people, and then\nthese Russians. And the following day, or maybe two days later, they came up to that farm \u2014\nthat was rather really like a villa, 1t wasn't an ordinary farm \u2014 and they said, \u201cOh, well that's\ngreat. Here's these women, and they speak Russian, and they speak Polish.\u201d\u2019 And they said,\n\u201cWe're going to be coming back in two days, you're going to work for us.\u201d\u201d Meanwhile, the\nword got around they were raping the women. The Russians girls told us. And as soon as\nthey left, we packed up and we left. We left that so called \u201cparadise.\u201d We were finding out\nnow that the war was coming to an end. But things were very disorderly, and nobody knew\nwhich end was up, and which way was \u2014 which way you should head. We sort of traveled\nwith some of the original 12 women but we scattered, because not everyone had the same\nidea. We knew that our parents did not survive, but my mother came from a very large\nfamily. There were nine children, meaning with families \u2014 nine families. And there was my\nfather's big family, and we were hoping we could get back to Poland as fast as we can. We\nwould at least be able to find people who survived, because my grandmother did not live in\nour hometown you know.\nSo that we decided to go to Poland. So, that the march started again, because we were way\ninside Germany. I think rather very near Hamburg is where Retzow was. Northern Germany,\nthe area generally known as Mecklenburg. So that we had to make our way from\nMecklenburg back east to Poland. So we walked as far as a place that was than called in\nGermany, Schneidemuhl, now it's called as Pila, 1t was in Poland, now it's in Polish territory.\nSo, we were finally able to board a train that was going east. We got on the train. Two\nstations later we were bumped off the train, because soldiers were coming, and they had\npreference. So by the time we got to the Polish town of Bydgoszcz, we must have been in\nand out of trains, waiting to be off one, and on one. And of course we had no idea where we\nwere going. But as long as we were going east, it was in the direction of home. And we were\nplanning on getting back, and see what was happening. Soon, very soon, on one of the trains\nwhen we were finally seated on a train, a gentlemen in uniform came over and he heard us\nspeak Polish. Whether he was a Polish Jew or Russian Jew, I don't know. But he was Jewish,\nin uniform. He said, \u201cI overheard you talk, and say you're going back to Poland. I must tell\nyou one thing. Where do you come from?\u201d We said \u201cStarachowice.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cYou must not\ngo to back to any small town. You will not survive if you do that. What you have to do 1s go\nto any big city. You go to Warsaw, you go to Krakow, or you go to L\u00e9dz.\u201d And we said,\n\u201cHow we going to go to these places where we don't really know the place, and we certainly\ndon't know who is going to be there?\u201d He said, \u201cThis you must do.\u201d But he said he had a\nsister that...\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: Well, the man told us that it's dangerous. The situation is unsettled. This is now early May,\n1945. The war was officially over. But things were in great flux because the armies were\nmoving east and west, west and east. And the population shifts during the war as you know,\nwere such that there was just masses of humanity going from hither to yon and back.\nBecause people were resettled, and uprooted, and whatever else. So, he said that would be\none thing. Another thing, that small towns if you come back, and you might have been a\nperson of means, and had property, that might get in your way. Because you would be\nsuspected of coming to claim your property. If it was real property, or houses, or whatever.\nAnd we said, \u201cWhat are we going to do? We don't know anybody.\u201d He said \u201cNo, you will go\nto Lodz. If you want to go to L\u00e9dz, my sister lives there.\u201d He said he had a sister, and he's\ngoing to give us her address. But basically now, the three big centers had Jewish\norganizations registering people. And it was most important for us to put our name in those\nregistries, and go there and find out -- day after day -- to find out who else signed in.\nBecause that was the way \u2014 you see the Red Cross was handling some of it. But the masses\nof uprooted humanity was such that the Jewish Agency\u2019 set out its own \u2014 its own well\nbureau, its own office to register the returning Jews from the camps. We got to the sister's\nhouse. Sure enough, it was in the evening, her house was packed. People were there like\nherrings, laid out on the floor. Because whoever came back ended up there, and we stayed in\nthat apartment on the stairwell. I remember, even Chris reminded me of it too. We talked\nabout it, we laughed, because that was a real great welcome. We had absolutely no idea\nwhere we were. And it was packed, but people said \u201cWelcome, stay.\u201d\u2019 And they pointed us in\nthe right direction, the Jewish Agency. I think it was the Joint Distribution Committee\u2019, or\nwhatever, the Jewish Agency, or international agency. We signed up, and we went.\nEveryday we were given rations, and you know, provisions to sustain ourselves.\nAnd whether we found it on our own, or they somehow assigned to us a hovel, that was the\nmost incredible place. It was nothing, but it was a roof over our heads. The walls were falling\nin, and it was horrendous. However, we were very lucky to discover that Uncle Alexander\nsurvived. Uncle Alexander was my father's brother. We came from Starachowice, and he\ncame from Radom. His name was Alexander Laks. And Uncle Alexander came to Lodz at\nthe same time we did. So, we were reunited with uncle Alexander, and we formed a\nhousehold. And soon enough Chana came to Lodz, and she joined us, and she was part of the\nhousehold. She became the fourth sister, Chana Tencer, so we formed this provisional\nhousehold. And we did not discover \u2014 we did not find anybody else coming back however,\nuntil Alexander's wife survived in Sweden. She was taken by the Swedish Red Cross out of\none of these camps, because she was also in Auschwitz. So Uncle Alexander stayed with us,\nand went back to Radom. He had property and he was able to secure some funds, and we\nlived with him, and started struggling, and finding jobs and such. Subsequently in Lodz, I\nwent to school. My sisters went to work. They also went to \u2014 paid a visit to Starachowice\nand came back very quickly, because they were threatened also that they were going to be\nkilled if they stayed around. So, that really was the end of our connection to Starachowice.\nWe stayed in Lodz.",
        "A: No. Mother's family was not Laks, mother's family was Tenenblum(ph). My mother's family\nwas a larger family. Uncle Alexander was my father's brother, and my father had two other\nsisters about whom we didn't know anything. One of the daughters of the sister survived in\n* Jewish Agency for Palestine; branch of the World Zionist Organization whose aim is to assist\nand encourage Jews to foster development and settlement of Israel.\n> American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee; Jewish American relief organization founded\nin 1914.\nIsrael, her name is Andzia\u00b0. But my mother had a very big family and nobody survived. And\nwe did find out later she lived in Ostrowiec. And we found out from people that lived in\nOstrowiec, that she taken when Ostrowiec was being cleared of Jews. And my mother's\nyoungest sister, the pharmacist who worked in Lomza. Right before the war she got in a\npharmacy a job in Lomza after she graduated from the University. We never heard of her.\nNobody heard of her, because Lomza was northeast, and that was somehow annexed to\nRussia. And then the Germans came, and the Russians came, and it was back and forth. And\nLomza also had these Jews shipped out to Belzec, I think. But we don't know whether this\nyounger sister of my mothers ever survived the selection. So, Uncle Alexander in our life at\nthat point was the only surviving relative. When my sisters went back, as I said, to\nStarachowice they were threatened, and something terrible already had happened in town\nthat same night when they were there. Two women with children who returned from\nAuschwitz, six and eight year old children, and two women \u2014 they were killed in\nStarachowice that same night my sister came. And of course I did not go. I stayed with Uncle\nAlexander in Lodz. And they went. Of course they did not come back with anything except\nfor some personal gifts that my mother's very dear, dear friend who kept a few mementos,\nwho never even thought she should take things, you know, to hide for us. My two sisters\nwent to her house, and she smuggled them out in the last minute onto the train to get out. So\nthat was the end of our going back. You know, you can't go home again, in more ways than\none. And that was certainly brought home to us at that point, and we stayed on in Lodz, and\nwe eventually went to Berlin, and ended up in the United States. But again, I would like to\nadd at this point, that I have mentioned it before. Not that I was a coward as a child. But I\nhad nothing to do with my own survival you see. It was either chance, or 1t was my mother's\nwonderful wishes for her children to survive. Or whether it was my sisters' efforts to keep us\ngoing, or whether it was the support we gave each other. However it was I survived, it was it\nwas none of my doing. It was the, the merest chance. And the most miraculous thing of that,\nhaving survived all of that, I sort of made peace with my background in the sense that I have\nlearned going through life that people have other horrible life experiences, people who have\nnever suffered in camps. And because I was able to make a life for myself, and still be\neducated in this country, and still be a child in this country, because I still went to summer\ncamp here, I went to high school. I went to college. I graduated from, from college.\nI was working. I was taught Polish at the University. I married an, an American. I have a\nwonderful husband. We've been married for 38 years, and we have two grown sons. The\nhouse was never oriented around anything that was part of my past, in the sense that I still\nhave very close ties to my friends. And always my dearest friends are the oldest friends from\nthese times. I've never denied the Holocaust. I have never ever removed my numbers, though\nI was absolutely almost forced to remove it by some people I knew. And he was a plastic\nsurgeon. In fact my first job in America was as a governess, for a family who went in the\ncountry for \u2014 and he was a plastic surgeon, and he kept telling me, \u201cI will not charge you.\u201d\n\u00b0 Andzia Ptasznik\nOf course those were my childhood days, and really, I was absolutely green about\neverything. And he said, \u201cI won't charge you. I will do a beautiful job for you, and I remove\nyour numbers.\u201d And I said, \u201cAbsolutely not, because that is like brown eyes, is a part of my\nperson, so is this number. It is an indelible thing.\u201d I live with it. I don't regret not having\nremoved it. I cannot say I'm proud of how I survived, or what I survived. It was just part of a\nlife, but perhaps I was young enough to still catch that little bit of \u2014 because my youth was\nlost in Poland you see. And because I was able to recapture some of that childhood in\nAmerica, it somehow made me feel that this is really the life that counts, even though I lost\nmy parents. You know, and it was a terrible loss. So that I don't dwell on it. I talk about it\nfreely as you could see.\nNot that I've rationalized it. I've just analyzed it, and said that, \u201cIf you are going to go\nthrough life once, and if you are going to live with your daily cares and your daily\nexpectations, why dwell on something that was too horrible to even ever recount? Because\nmost of it sounds likes fiction anyhow.\u201d You know that after the war, I had a double set of\nteeth.",
        "A: My baby teeth never fell out \u2014 and I still had -and my new teeth came in. Because I was\nundernourished, and my development wasn't \u2014 I was a starved child after the war, after all\nwas said and done. I was tall, but skinny, totally underdeveloped. Totally flat, like a board.\nAnd two rows of teeth. And when I went to a dentist in Berlin, he sat me down in the chair,\nand he pulled 12 teeth with his hand. You know, one by one. Because they were really ready\nto come out. But you know, they were \u2014 my physical person, so to say, hadn't yet caught up.",
        "A: Yes. I had baby teeth. And 12 teeth in one setting. And it wasn't even pulling with anything\nbut his bare hand. But of course that's another story. And than of course everything changed.\nAnd I have been back to Poland twice. Once with my husband on a tour, and another one on\nan interpreting job. And I find that I can face it rationally, and think about it rationally. And\nrealize how it fits in the scheme of things of a human life, and I've made peace with it so to\nSay.",
        "A: Can I rationalize?",
        "A: I can, because this is also the nature of your mentality. I am by nature optimistic and\noutgoing. So, that 1t would not be true to my type to be spending my life regretting what\nhappened, or what didn't happen, or what I went through, or I didn't. I certainly learned a lot\nfrom the experiences, even though they're too horrible to recount. Because human kindness\nin all that horror was also a very great part of my survival. There were people who were\nalways taking pity on me, and I don't know why. It was not only my sisters, but also the\ngoodness of other people helped me through. You know, people would give me a potato, or\nsomething. I don't know if I was such a sorry sight, or whatever. But I survived thanks to\nhuman kindness, and the real great help of my two sisters. Is there anything else that you\nwould like me to elaborate on?",
        "A: Well, I am not just angry how my parents died.",
        "A: I am angry what happened to the Jewish people. What horror happened, what unspeakable\nhorror that could not even be described. That could not even be comprehended. That\ngenocide on that scale, that is most unprecedented. My parents were dearest to me indeed,\nbut the thousands and thousands of others. My big extended family they were tremendous\nfamily, and they were such lovely people, and they were such educated people. And I grieve\nfor my parents, indeed I did. And I was wonderful \u2014 terribly attached to my parents. I was\nthe youngest, and rather spoiled, and was very attached to my parents.\nBut as you read history, and study the whole \u2014 the whole scene that has unfolded in the\nsecond war that was never even contemplated, or one step from the next, was the more\nhorrible step from the next. And you never knew who the horror came from, or where the\ngoodness came from, you see. And yet, the other people were not treated the way we were.\nYou see, when I always think of those pillows airing in the windows, where there was real\nnormal life, when we were at the edge of total destruction. And the fact that you had to\nwitness the most animalistic traits of human nature that you would never suspect people\ndisplayed. Because anybody, there were people who felt that they could trample you to death\nif they could grab that one leftover potato, you see. That was on the one hand. You saw the\nbasest nature of the human person at its worst, and than you also saw the most wonderful\nqualities of people; of devotion, and people who shielded you, who cared about you, and\nwho consoled you. And after all, I was a child and I needed a lot of consolation, and a lot of\ngood deeds to push me through, aside from my sisters, who weren\u2019t in such wonderful shape\nthemselves to do it, but they did it. When you assess the \u2014 it was a trauma. But when you\nassess the whole problem, the whole experience of a huma\u2014 of 6,000,000 people you see,\nand than you fit yourself, that one single person who was really a child into that framework,\nit boggles the mind, you see. Therefore, if I chose to contemplate or live that past, I probably\nwould have been a burden forever after. And my only and one desire after we were liberated\nwas to never ever be a burden to anybody. That was one thing, because I realized then I was\nan orphan. And although I was pulled through by my sisters, of course it didn't happen,\nbecause when Miles married Chris, I became another \u2014 a charge of his you see. So, even\nthough I was really always being considered a child, when I came to America I came with a\nchildren\u2019s group, with Miles and Chris, but as a child. All this is fine. But you see again\nhaving that optimistic nature, I felt that grieving over my own past would not get any me\nanywhere. Beside, I had not lived. I had not lived. When I was given a chance to live in\nAmerica, to go to high school, to go to college. Having that wonderful experience to go out\nof town in college, it was \u2014 I just fell in with it. This was just the most wonderful thing I\ncould ever dream about. I guess \u2014 am I angry? I can't tell you whether I'm angry. I grieve\nabout it, and I think about it. But it can't be brought back. But I hope it's going to be forever\nremembered, and prevented from happening again. So that is my only hope. If our\nexperience could teach the world anything at all about human nature, and about how people\ncan be \u2014 how people can actually \u2014 the bestiality of one man to another, if people could just\nlearn that, than my experience was worth it.\nTo have survived to show the world how such a thing could happen, so that it does not\nhappen again. Because if we don't learn from this particular experience, it will probably\nhappen again. It's something to work on, not just to think about. You know, to work on for a\nbetter world. But at this point it doesn't look like it, but who knows.",
        "A: Thank you.\n[Technical conversation |\n[Interviewee shows tattoo]\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: Thank you.\n[Break in recording |\n",
        "A: Yes, yes. Those were during that particular march from the camp proper to the marshes,\nwhere we were to clear the marshes and the underbrush alongside the river. And because that\nwas a rather lengthy march, in formation with guards guarding us, we did pass quite a\nnumber private dwellings along the way, because we were basically outside of camp.\nWhereas, whether these dwellings were for Germans who were taking care of the camp,\nwhether these were Polish people who occupied it, I don\u2019t know. However, they really were\nprivate homes and on one of the marches I notices pillows airing in the windows. And that\nreally was a very painful moment, because in normal conditions in Poland everybody was\nairing pillows. That was just the thing to do if you lived normal life. And it brought to mind,\nthat here we were in this situation -- having been separated from our parents, forever\nprobably, and being left alone, not knowing of our future, working under most horrendous\nconditions -- and here are people who are still living a normal life, airing their pillows, even\nin such close proximity to the camp where all these horrible things are happening. And\nsomehow or other, that particular scene reminded my mind, because you know how you\nsometimes remain with a picture in your mind, well that was the observation that struck me\nat that time and remained for me ever after. And a similar incident, from that particular walk\n-- march rather, from the camp proper to the marshes and back, which we did everyday while\nwe were working on that, on that job -- is that one day, whether we were going or coming\nback I don\u2019t remember, but I did notice an eaten apple of a core on the ground as we were\npassing. I bent down and picked it up and quickly ate it. And I was myself amazed that I\nhave done it. That I was \u2014 the hunger that overpowered the even second thought, \u201cShould I\npick up this core?\u201d Because after all 1t was on the road and it could have been thrown away\nby some sick person, and it could have been the, the \u2014 god only knows, dogs could have\nbeen over it and whatever. It absolutely never entered my mind. There was this little bit of\napple left on the core and this is what I grabbed and ate.\nAnd I have very often come back to that, to that \u2014 apple core picture, that picture you know,\neven in this day when you are always concerned about hygiene and \u201cunder what\ncircumstances would you do such and such, and not do such and such?\u201d Well that is the\nanswer; I did it without any second thought and that was of course probably the only apple\nI\u2019ve tasted in more than two years at that point and that was \u2014 there was at least the taste of\nthe apple of the real thing, of that real life that of course I was separate from. So these two\nincidents remain very clearly in my mind from this particular work detail in Auschwitz.\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: Many times when I go back to these specific memories, to these specific pictures in my mind\nI always wonder \u201cLiving a world of plenty in America where things are discarded constantly\nand I go back to that episode of that core of an apple, of what that could do to a starving\nperson \u2014 where of course in hindsight and looking from another perspective in a totally\ndifferent age I look at it now I am really most impressed of how life can change your\napproach to things. How life can absolutely move you into another dimension to make you\naware of values of certain things even such as an eaten apple core, which of course today\nyou would not ever consider anything but garbage. Because people though away more things\nthat are not garbage in today\u2019s society that we ever dreamt of.\n"
