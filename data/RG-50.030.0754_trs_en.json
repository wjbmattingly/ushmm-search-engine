And he had to have an\noperation. I don\u2019t know exactly what they did, I guess just maybe drained the \u2014 the\n\u2014 the sore that he had that was infected.

But I think I remember \u2014 think that I\u2014 when I was three \u2014 se \u2014 three or\nfour years old. We had, I think \u2014 this, don\u2019t forget was \u2014 I was born in \u201924, so we\nhad a\u2014 our \u2014 our childhood were really quite happy. My parents were well off.

        "Q: \u2014 meeting room.",
        "A: \u2014 which was very large, and a dining room. Something called a\n[indecipherable], which was really a place where my parents got dressed in their \u2014\noff their bedroom. And master bedroom, and I think two \u2014 two other bedrooms, and\nJune 21, 2014\nmy brother and I usually shared a bedroom. I think the other bedroom was made\ninto a study or something.",
        "Q: And wha \u2014",
        "A: But it was very large and it was very beautiful and we had a balcony, and was a\nquiet street.",
        "Q: It sounds like a 19\" century kind of building.",
        "A: Yes, it \u2014 it\u2014 I mean \u2014 and \u2014 and my grandfather owned that apartment building,\nso my dad and my uncle owned \u2014 owned the whole thing eventually. And it was qui\n\u2014anice place for the children to play, ride their tricycles and bicycles and \u2014",
        "Q: Where would you do that? In the courtyard? Was there a courtyard?",
        "A: Or even on the street, because there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of traffic. So this was my\nearly childhood and the next major thing I remember, and we can go back if\nsomething comes up from a question, was when I was about six, seven years old, I\ndeveloped on my left eye, I believe it was, a \u2014 what looked like a \u2014 a serious\ninfection or some inflammation, where I had a drooping li-lid, and it looked very\nangry. And my parents took me to an eye doctor in Wiesbaden, of all \u2014 of all\nnames, Dr. Goering.",

        "A: He was a cousin or something of the field marshal.\nJune 21, 2014",

        "Q: Tuberculosis of the eye.",
        "A: And my parents got \u2014 yeah, I don\u2019t even know if that exists.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But my parents got scared enough so they sent me for the entire \u2014 when I was\nabout seven years old, for the entire winter to a kinderheim, which I guess\ntranslates best to a chi-children\u2019s camp \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 in Samaden(ph), Switzerland, a village right outside of Saint Moritz.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s not bad.",
        "A: No, it isn\u2019t bad except I was so homesick I couldn\u2019t enjoy it.",
        "Q: Of course, of course.",
        "A: That time I think I was even without my brother, and I was there from before\nChristmas til after Easter, and I just cried myself to sleep many nights. Didn\u2019t really\nappreciate, as I did la-later on, as I will tell you in a minute. So I was there for a\nvery long time, the idea was that the mountain air is good for TB. And the\nfollowing year they send me back again, I think also for most of the winter, to\nanother \u2014 but this one \u2014 this \u2014 this one time was a much more pleasant, Jewish\nJune 21, 2014\nkinderheim in Celerina, which is the town between Samadan(ph), or\nSamadan(ph), and Saint Moritz. And that time I had my brother with me, an-and I\nwas a little older and I had a very good time, and I learned how to ski. I mean, I\nlearned the rudimentary \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 aspects of it, snowplows and \u2014 and m-my dad came to visit, and show you how\nbrothers can differ, I said \u2014 I ju \u2014I was starting to run into his arms because I was\nso happy to see him, and my brother said, no, first we\u2019re gonna finish the sled ride\ndown the mountain [indecipherable]. But we had a wonderful time \u2014",
        "Q: Kids are like that.",
        "A: \u2014 seeing him, we still enjoyed seeing him.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and that was actually a very interesting \u2014",
        "Q: So this was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 experience.",
        "Q: Were you very close to your brother from the very beginning?",
        "A: Oh yes, we \u2014 you know, we had our fights, as most children, especially that\nclose, two boys do. But we were always very close, we \u2014 we ch \u2014 shared a bedroom\nand we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t go to sleep without saying [speaks German]\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s sweet, that really is.",
        "A: Right. So, and then I really became very interested in winter sports, and I \u2014 my\ndad, and then following when \u2014 as I became a little older, like 10 - 11, my dad to-\ntook me with him. My par \u2014 my parents took separate vacations. I haven\u2019t told you\nmuch about the business \u2014",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: \u2014 but \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019d like to know about ma \u2014",
        "A: \u2014my mother enjoyed working in the business. So she was basically office\nmanager, bookkeeper, accountant, whatever, and in-in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in \u2014 1n the\n[indecipherable] which was in our building, so she didn\u2019t have to go anywhere.\nBut they didn\u2019t take vacation together, somebody had to be there for the business,\nso they \u2014 my mother went with his sister, my dad went pretty much by himself, but\nmet some people he knew that came every year in Saint Moritz.",
        "Q: Oh, so is that \u2014 was that \u2014",
        "A: So at that time it wasn\u2019t quite as \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 as fa \u2014 posh as it is now, but it was still a beautiful resort, and he took me with\nhim for \u2014 from \u2014 I guess from the time \u2014 from what, 11 to 13. Thirteen was in 1937,\nJune 21, 2014\nand it was the last time we were able to go to Switzerland. Now, my dad waited a\nlong time, and I\u2019|l explain that, to emigrate, and Pll explain that \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 very carefully. But he clearly knew it was coming, because one of the reasons\nfor going on all these vacations was that \u2014 to smuggle money out of Germany.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: Absolutely, he started that very early. He would go to Switzerland \u2014 first of all,\nyou had \u2014 the Germans gave you a certain amount of foreign money, they allowed\nyou a certain amount of money to change to \u2014 so let\u2019s say in the case of Swiss\nfrancs, or Dutch guilder, you had a couple of thousand dollars, whatever it was, he\nwould live in a little cheaper hotel, save some money, put it in a bank in\nSwitzerland or Holland, Belgium, wherever we went. He also took along a\n[indecipherable] or contacts, and sold it there. In addition, I found out later they\nbought a row house in Philadelphia. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did they? Even before coming here?",
        "A: They really in \u2014 in the fi \u2014 the idea that we may go there, and we \u2014 or go to the\nUnited States. And so they \u2014 they were really quite foresighted in that sense.",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s true, it\u2019s true, because many people \u2014",
        "A: Right.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: \u2014 didn\u2019t know where to go, or how.",
        "A: Yeah, but he didn\u2019t even apply for a \u2014 for a visa, but Ill explain that in a minute.\nSo my mother was made \u2014 mainly in the business, so she hired a both some \u2014 some\nhelp in the kitchen, and you know, like a \u2014 a maid \u2014 a maid.",
        "Q: You anticipated one of my questions, yes.",
        "A: But she also, from time to time hired a nursemaid for \u2014 for the two boys.",
        "Q: Okay. That\u2019s one thing I wanted to ask, is whether she had any help in the house.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 since she ur \u2014 worked quite a bit. She almost always had a maid, as long as we\nwere allowed to have them. And from time to time quite often had also, at least on\nweekends, a nursemaid for us.",
        "Q: So were these people \u2014 were they \u2014 did they change a lot, or did you have people\ncome help her and \u2014 and th-that became part of the family? What kind of relation\ndid you have with this \u2014",
        "A: I-In the beginning, yeah. Early on, as they were there quite a long time and \u2014 and\nbecame sort of a part of the family, I mean, really \u2014 even had Christmas trees for the\nmaids, which we enjoyed too, at Christmastime. Later on, of course, these things\nchanged a lot. When the Nuremberg laws came out, we had to have a maid over\nJune 21, 2014\nsay 55 years old, and wa \u2014 while the lady was very nice, we never became that\nclose. But I had, I-I remember, at least one young woman that took care of us on\nweekends when we were already a little older, when I was maybe 10 or 11, and my\nbrother was a year and a half younger, whom I had a terrible crush on. She was\nvery, very pretty. And so the reason my par \u2014 well, first of all, let me say something\nabout the times.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: We \u2014 it was \u2014 as soon as the Nazis came to power, things did change pretty\nquickly.",
        "Q: How? How did \u2014 did it \u2014 how did it affect your life? I mean, the \u2014 your family\u2019s\nlife, not just yours.",
        "A: Actually, you know, clearly not as much as it did later on, but very quickly we\ncouldn\u2019t go to our swimming pool, our favorite swimming pool. We couldn\u2019t go \u2014\nmy \u2014 my dad belonged to a luft bad \u2014",
        "Q: So, a luft bad.",
        "A: \u2014 which was basically the German equivalent of an all male nudist colony. They\nwent there to walk around in the nude and take sun baths in the nude.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they couldn\u2019t over \u2014 over there. There were \u2014 were signs [speaks German]\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Jews are not allowed, yeah, not allowed in \u2014 not \u2014",
        "A: All over, yeah, also some of the mu \u2014 movie theaters and theaters.",
        "Q: And that was pretty soon after the \u2014",
        "A: Even some park benches, I don\u2019t remember for sure whether \u2014 if that was the\ncase in Wiesbaden. But, I mean, those things became evident.",
        "Q: So, that soon after \u201933? I mean, soon \u2014",
        "A: Very soon, I would say \u2014",
        "Q: So you were nine years old \u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u00b034- 735.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And they made it more and more difficult for my dad to operate his business. He\nhad al \u2014a-\u2014an [indecipherable] and wholesale grain business. He \u2014 he bought and\nsold, and he he had a \u2014 a \u2014 what do you call it, a \u2014",
        "Q: A tire, a towel, a si \u2014 excuse me, a silo?",
        "A: Not exact silo, a\u2014 a warehouse with a thing where you \u2014 where you can put \u2014\nput \u2014 put the grain through into sacks and all \u2014 and all sorts of \u2014 even, I think, some\nmilling. And this warehouse was taken away from him, and what we found out later\nis, it became a \u2014 an arms depot \u2014",
        "Q: Really?\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 for the Nazis. And my dad went and took a picture of that warehouse, not\nknowing it was an arms depot, I don\u2019t think he knew, and was immediately hauled\nin by the Gestapo, and questioned and told he was not allowed to take pictures at\nthis.

And my parents wanted to send me to the\norangienstrasse(ph) gymnasium, I forget, they had a form real gymnasium,\nsomething like that, and they couldn\u2019t get in. But I got into the Gutenberg\ngymnasium, which was a humanistisch gymnasium and a real gymnasium. About\nthe only difference between the humanistic part and the \u2014 and the real part was that\nin humanistic part you took Greek as a second, after Latin \u2014 after Latin and French,\nthen Greek, and the other one you took Latin, French and then English. And I went\nJune 21, 2014\nto the real part of it, and well, only about, I would say six Jewish boys \u2014 this was an\nall boys\u2019 school, and I believe there may have been a girl \u2014 separate girl gymnasium\nas well, six or seven Jewish kids among about 300 students.",

        "Q: Some kids \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 agress \u2014 aggressive. And one year we even ma \u2014 Warren and I ha-had to\nactually fight them off.

        "Q: With the hired help, th-the people who came to help your mother in the \u2014 in the\nhome, either take care of you or in the kitchen on the weekends. Did those relations\nchange? You said that the Nuremberg laws came, and so you couldn\u2019t hire\nsomebody who was younger than 55. But did the attitude of the people who were\nhired, did that change?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I mean, it \u2014 not that I was aware of. They were all \u2014 I mean, they \u2014\nfirst of all, even if they did, 1t didn\u2019t show it, because they want \u2014 they wanted their\njobs.",

        "A: I think there was some conversation about that they were very worried that\nHitler might come to power.

I mean, they had a huge library, they read all\nthe classics, Schiller, Goethe \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My dad had read \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and so he knew what Hitler was saying about\nthe Jews, and was worried that he meant it. And so, they were concerned, I mean,\nno question about it. And \u2014 but that was about the extent of it.",
        "Q: Did they wo \u2014 di \u2014 did they ever have conversations with you and your brother\nabout life outside, about being careful, about possibly being attacked, or pi \u2014 ki \u2014\nhow kids \u2014 how you should react if kids call you names or things?",
        "A: Not that much. I mean, it didn\u2019t happen that often, and I \u2014 it may have been\ndiscussed, but I don\u2019t have any \u2014 any real good recollections that I can give you.",
        "Q: Okay. Would your family \u2014\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: But I think they were a little concerned about my being 1n a \u2014 in a school with so\nfew Jewish children. And of course, I noticed the discrimination not from the\nchildren, but from the higher ups, immediate \u2014 very, very \u2014 very quickly. I was a\npretty good soccer player, and was what you would call now a striker. And together\nwith the center, whose name was Krempel(ph), I happen to remember his name, we\nscored a lot of goals. And one day my \u2014 the coach came to me and said, you can no\nlonger play on the line, I\u2019m gonna put you in the goal, because you\u2019re not going to\nbe playing in the interschool game, because you\u2019re Jewish. And then I played goal\nfor a while, and then I was out altogether. And the other time I was very\nuncomfortable is, they taught religion in school. So couple times I went along with\n\u2014 for \u2014 with the Catholic class, because I\u2019d \u2014 I was embarrassed to drop out. And\nthen th-the \u2014 our synagogue, the [indecipherable] in German it\u2019s called liberale\nGemeinde, a liberal exa \u2014 which is what \u2014 here \u2014 here would be called\nConservative. We were members of that, and the religion teacher, also the cantor, is\nHerr Kappel(ph) would come to the high school, to the gymnasium and with the\ntwo or three of us, would have a master key, and look for an empty classroom, and\ngive us religious classes. So that was a little uncomfortable being different from the\nrest of the \u2014 the kids.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Were the classes at the \u2014 I mean, was it very visible and \u2014 and obvious when you\nwould go for those religion classes, or were they held at the same time as \u2014",
        "A: They were held at the same time and it was probably not that obvious, but I fel \u2014\nI wa self-conscious about it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And probably other kids were too.",

        "A: But \u2014 and then I \u2014 I also did some track in \u2014 in gym and \u2014 and so forth, and\nrunning, and I was pretty good at that. I really worked hard at athletics, cause I felt I\nwould be better \u2014 better off if I\u2019m strong and \u2014 and athletic than if I were a weakling\nand bookish and \u2014",

        "A: Also, the area [speaks German here]. This was a very conservative Jewish\ngroup that were proud of the fact that they, or relatives had been front line soldiers\nJune 21, 2014\nin the first World War. And they ran this shi \u2014 this sports organization, where we\ndid a lot of athletics ranging from Ping Pong to soccer to handball. I don\u2019t know the\n\u2014 you know the German handball.

        "Q: A sense of community.",

        "Q: How did the teachers behave?",
        "A: The teachers in general were very good to us, surprisingly. I mean, I had some\nvery courageous teachers. In \u2014 in the Hebbleschule(ph) I had a mi \u2014 a \u2014 had\nCantrow, c-a-n-t-r-o-w, who was an extremely fine human being. When I went\nback to Wiesbaden as an adult American, he had passed away. But his wife knew\nme. I cannot understand that. She knew immediately who I was. So apparently he\ntook a special interest in us Jewish kids because of what was happening, or\nbeginning to happen. And then I pa \u2014 went to this gymnasium in ray \u2014 the\nJune 21, 2014\nGutenberg gymnasium. And there too, I had a history professor, or teacher\n[indecipherable] Herr Wesling(ph) who lived in our apartment house and was\nobviously very anti-Nazi, and every time he had a cold and was out for a day, I\nthought he was in a concentration camp, because he spoke up with incredible\ncourage.",
        "Q: What are \u2014 what he \u2014 what are the things that he would say?",
        "A: He would say nasty things about the Nazis and about the axis, and made fun of\nthe fact that the Japanese are not Aryans. He would \u2014 you know, you had to say heil\nHitler at the beginning of every class. He would [indecipherable]. Whereas some\nof the others would stand straight and make sure that nobody\u2019s moving and then \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 stick out their arm.",
        "Q: Did you have to do that too?",
        "A: I never knew what to do. I f\u2014 I mean, I was damned if I did and damned if I \u2014 if\nI didn\u2019t, so I usually di-did, because I didn\u2019t know which was \u2014",

        "A: It was a \u2014 it was very \u2014 this was very difficult for \u2014 luckily nobody said\nanything, but I was worried that somebody would say, how come you, Jewboy, do\nthis, you know [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Were there any teachers who were not particularly sympathetic?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there were, but I didn\u2019t have any myself.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But of course we\u2019re \u2014 what did happen at that time, and it\u2019s all \u2014 totally su \u2014\ntotally su-surprising now to anybody I tell it to, 1s that pe \u2014 that kids got hit,\nsometimes for really stupid reasons. I was actually a pretty hi \u2014 well \u2014 well behaved\nchild, but I got hit with a bamboo stick on my rear end because of bad handwriting.\nIf \u2014 if my essay or whatever, composition was written in bad handwriting, it w \u2014 I\nwould get a\u2014 an \u2014 a grade \u2014 sometimes a good grade, but it was in red. And if it\nwas in red, they had to come up and bend over and get two or three s \u2014 strokes with\na bamboo stick. I mean, ridiculous.",

        "Q: I want to go back a little bit, circle back and ask something I didn\u2019t before. And\nthat is, I'd like you to tell me a little bit about your parents\u2019 personalities. Your\nfather\u2019s personality, his \u2014 whether he was open or gregarious, or more reti \u2014\nreticent, or whatever.",
        "A: Okay, my \u2014 my father was extremely gre-gregarious and outgoing.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: He had a wonderful personality, and that\u2019s why he was a very good salesman,\nJune 21, 2014\nand was able to start a totally different business in this country and do well. He was\nin the lighting business when he came over here, which he knew nothing about. But\nhe had such a great personality that everybody liked him and bought from him. And\nhe \u2014 he was very outgoing and very \u2014 loved people. My mother was more \u2014 also had\na very nice personality, but she was much more reserved \u2014 while he was around\nespecially, she kind of took the background, as was customary in German society.\nAnd once he passed away, she just kind of came out of her shell and became much\nmore outgoing and more enterprising, and \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s already here, in the United States?",
        "A: That was already here in the United States.",

        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a hard question to answer. I think they had very good values, as I\nmentioned before, they don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t have a lot of formal education, but they really\nacted as though they were highly educated people. They read a lot, th \u2014 education\nwas a number one issue. And especially for my dad, vacations were very important.\nHe felt that was a very important part of life, and also he had so-some health\nproblems. Lot of lower back pain, high blood pressure and so he felt he needed a\nvacation also for health reasons, but he loved vacations; whether it was skiing or\nwhether it was in the summer, hiking, he loved go \u2014 an-and I kind of inhe \u2014\ninherited that.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s a good thing, because you know, here in our society, people say we\ndon\u2019t have enough balance in our lives.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. We\u2019ve always, my family, Irene and I and our kids have\nalways had wonderful vacations together. Of course now it\u2019s \u2014 becomes much more\ndifficult to go as a family, but we still try to \u2014 to travel when we can.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: My parents were very, very attached to their parents and very family oriented.\nThat\u2019s another ver \u2014 very important value. And my grandfather said point blank, we\nwere born here, we\u2019re gonna die here, we\u2019re not going anywhere.",

Now, as I mentioned, my\ndad was fa-farsighted enough to [indecipherable] money, to \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, to \u2014 to\nmove out money to other countries to have something when he left. But he also, in\n1936, made a orientierungsreise, an orientation trip to the United States.",

        "A: And a lovely lady \u2014 we were \u2014 our lives were really saved by the fact that my\ngrandmother\u2019s brother had enough sense to leave Germany in the late 19 hund \u2014\n1800s, move to the United States, and this was his daughter, who \u2014 a very\ngenerous, lovely lady who gave affidavits to something like 15 relatives. And you\nknow, if any of them had been bad apples, she could have been in serious trouble.\nShe was well-off, she had no children and [indecipherable] husband, and she had\ngood \u2014 good positions. And she was well-off, but she was not really wealthy, and so\nthis 1s an hero \u2014 courageous thing to do. But my dad came over here and then came\nback and we still didn\u2019t leave. That was like two years before we actually left. And\nfinally in \u2014 round that time \u2014 and I was like 12 years old, and my moth \u2014 and you \u2014\nyou \u2014 you \u2014 you get \u2014 you mature fast under these circumstance, and my mother\nJune 21, 2014\nand I sat my dad down and said look, Papa, why don\u2019t you apply for a visa, you\nhave \u2014 you have also an affidavit. You can always let it \u2014",

        "A: Expire.",
        "Q: Sure.",

        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 in Cleveland, who still survives, Marian. So, one other thing that I didn\u2019t\nmention, and maybe I should, my \u2014 I told you my paternal grandparents lived in nav\n\u2014 in the little town of Gensingen \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",

But my parents finally found a si \u2014 a \u2014 an apartment on a\nvery same street, Rudis(ph) Hammerstrasse fitinf. We were 14, and it \u2014 they were\nfive, and they moved my paternal grandparents to Wiesbaden.",
        "Q: So that had been happening to their house as well?",
        "A: Yes, it did, it did. And the \u2014 that\u2019s finally what scared my dad enough to \u2014\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: To move them.",
        "A: \u2014 to insist that they move.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then they lived across the street from us, practically, and that, of course,\nvery, very pleasant for us children to visit.

        "Q: So, when \u2014 when people were talking of leaving, was it a sense of a temporary\nmove, or was this a se \u2014 that is, we\u2019ll move until that Hitler, you know, that \u2014 that\nfool Hitler gets, well, voted out of office, and then we\u2019ll come back. Or was it a\nsense of, we\u2019re really leaving, and we\u2019re not coming back\u2019?",
        "A: When \u2014 when we were still in Germany \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 when we still in Wiesbaden, I think there was a sense \u2014 although I think it was\na rationalization that it might be temporary, but became more and more evident that\nit wasn\u2019t so temp \u2014 temporary and that it was extremely dangerous, although\nnobody thought about a \u2014 a systematic killing. I\u2019m \u2014 if anybody says that, I don\u2019t\nbelieve it. I mean, it just simply not something that people imagined, and in ik \u2014 so-\nJune 21, 2014\ncalled civilized country. But once we\u2019re ready to go, and by that time, I \u2014 we had\nsome experiences which I haven\u2019t come around to yet.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I think we knew it was permanent, absolutely.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s a very important \u2014",
        "A: It certainly was permanent to me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, I didn\u2019t expect that we would come back, except to visit maybe.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But we \u2014 so let me tell you a little bit about our \u2014",
        "Q: Right, tell me about that.",
        "A: \u2014 the time when we \u2014 so we, as I mentioned, I was still in the gymnasium on\nNovember 10\", the day after Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My \u2014I wa- we were lucky, nobody came and \u2014 in-into our apartment. That\u2019s\nthe advantage of a bigger city, there\u2019s so many of us, and in \u2014 in apartment houses\nwhere the \u2014 you\u2019re not quite sure where people live and \u2014 I mean, people did get,\nsome of \u2014 but it was a little bit safer than in a smaller town. But my grandmother\nJune 21, 2014\nand my grandfather \u2014 well, by that time my grandfather was dead. My grandmother\nin Bingen \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 she had all her \u2014 her glasses and gristal \u2014 crystal-wear and dishes destroyed.\nTh-They had a real attack on her house. And \u2014 so we didn\u2019t have that, but the\nfollowing morning, when I was in school, one of my classmates said, Eric, did you\nknow the synagogue\u2019s on fire? I said, what? I did \u2014 I didn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s \u2014 first of\nall, it\u2019s a berg \u2014 huge stone structure, I didn\u2019t even think it would burn.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I thought he was \u2014",
        "Q: Pulling your leg.",
        "A: \u2014 crazy, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, then I discovered, when \u2014 when school was over, my mother was at the door\npicking me up. My dad\u2019s ca \u2014 had the \u2014 the car there, and my mother said, come\nwith me. I \u2014 of course, I was upset that a big boy of 14 years old we \u2014 picked up\nfrom school, and I had no idea what was going on, and \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 and so I went to the car. And it turns out my dad didn\u2019t want to go home\nbecause he had heard of friends being picked up by the Gestapo and put in\nconcentration camps that day. They picked up many, many able-bodied Jewish men.\nThey did \u2014 they left the women and children still alone at that time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But the men were picked up and put in concentration camps.",
        "Q: What I want to \u2014 excuse me, I know you have a train of thought, but it \u2014I\u2014I\nwant to ask you before, did you know of people disappearing before Kristallnacht,\nof somebody being arrested \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely. I mean, people were arrested for all kinds of things. We had,\nfor instance, a friend who \u2014 who was arrested and put in concentration camp for\nrassenschande, which is, he was dating \u2014 he was supposed to be dating a Christian\nwoman, or maybe he was married to a Christian woman, I don\u2019t recall. You know,\nthis was a \u2014 a doctor friend, if I remember correctly, who was put in a concentration\ncamp because he was seen with a Christian woman. Now, they finally let him go,\nbut he was pretty emaciated, and ill when he got out. Now absolutely, there were\npeople arrested for all kinds of reasons, or \u2014 or drummed up reasons. And some\nwere let go, and some were not so fortunate. So the question of ca \u2014 disappearing to\nc \u2014 to concentration camps, that was already going around for quite a while.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "A: Fortunately in our town, we didn\u2019t see too many people just kind of beaten up or\n\u2014 or shot in the street. That went on in some cities.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t s \u2014",
        "A: Although on KristallInacht I understand that happened, although I didn\u2019t see it.",
        "Q: So tell me, where were you and your family on Kristallnacht? How did \u2014 how \u2014",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s it, I mean I\u2014 my mother picked me up in school \u2014 I mean, not\nduring the night, I \u2014 during the next day, the 10\" of November.",
        "Q: Yes, well, that night \u2014 that night is what I\u2019m asking.",
        "A: That night we were in our apartment, nobody bothered us. We were lucky, we\nwere not one of the ones that were \u2014",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t hear people in the streets?",
        "A: \u2014 attacked in the pogrom.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t hear people in the streets?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know anything that was going on until I was picked up from\nschool by my \u2014 by my parents.",
        "Q: By your mother.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: And then we drove around Wiesbaden because my dad was afraid to go home,\nhe thought he would be picked up.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Finally, my mother and I said this \u2014 you can\u2019t keep doing this, because th-they\nprobably know your license plate, the Gestapo. So we hit upon the idea, and \u2014",
        "Q: Where was your brother \u2014 excuse me.",
        "A: My brother? That\u2019s a good question. I think \u2014 he went to a Jewish school \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and he may have been in school that day. I don\u2019t remember. Him \u2014 he \u2014 you\ncan ask him.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I\u2014I really don\u2019t remember wa \u2014 he wa \u2014 he wasn\u2019t in the car, that I do\nremember.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We had [indecipherable] a very good friend of ours, Mr. Fritz\nSteckelmacher(ph) was a British citizen. He had worked in a bri \u2014 he was a banker\nfor Deutsche Bank, but he had worked for several years, much earlier I think, just\nafter World War I or something, in England, and long enough to be \u2014 to get British\nJune 21, 2014\ncitizenship. And we felt that the Germans were still legalistic enough to maybe\nleave a British citizen \u2014",
        "Q: Alone.",
        "A: \u2014 alone. At least not to search him in \u2014 without a warrant.",
        "Q: Was he Jewish?",
        "A: He is Jewish.",
        "Q: He was Jewish, okay.",
        "A: And hif \u2014 his father was a famous rabbi and writer \u2014 author in Mannheim.\nAnyway, the \u2014 my dad hid out at a \u2014 of course first, oh, he doesn\u2019t want to make\nany kind of umstande mache.",

But he hid out in his house for about four or five days.\nAt that point, he did not fail \u2014 feel very comfortable there. I mean, he was worried\nthat somebody would come. And we got this lovely lady, Miss Schraeder(ph) from\nAmsterdam. Blonde, Aryan looking. The wife of the com \u2014 police commissioner of\nAmsterdam, who was his friend from Saint Moritz, who came to Wiesbaden,\nstayed with us a couple of days, and then took him to the train station, chattering\nloudly in Dutch. And she got on the train, kissed him goodbye and then he jumped\nJune 21, 2014\non, and she jumped off, because they were arresting Jews at the train station that\ntime.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And he managed to get across the border to \u2014 to Amsterdam and to \u2014 to\nHolland. And a day after he got there, the Gestapo came to the house, two as \u2014 two\nor three people, searched the house from top to bottom.",

They stole the\nJune 21, 2014\ntypewriters out of the office, too-took whatever wasn\u2019t attached. Told my mother,\nyou have a month to pack up what you want to take, and get you and your children\nout of here. And since we had the americ \u2014 they \u2014 since we had the American visa,\nthey\u2019re willing to just let us go. And at that time, the-these things are so gradual, so",
        "Q: Incremental, in some ways.",
        "A: Right, a-at that \u2014 at that time they left women and children alone.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That didn\u2019t last long. So basically we \u2014 that was on the 12\" or the 13\" of\nNovember, and we left about the 10\" of December for \u2014 for Holland, reunited with\nour dad. And took the boat S-Statendam, in the Holland America line \u2014",
        "Q: Before \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to America.",
        "Q: Okay, before we get to that, when you left Germany, did you leave all your\nbelongings?",
        "A: We left everything except a lift van full of some furniture.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And some clothes. But all money had to be left. They give you like a hundred\ndollars or something, I don\u2019t know, you can take with you.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: So whatever \u2014 whatever liquid assets you had in Germany, you lost.",
        "A: We lost.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s why my parents took first class tickets on the boat. They couldn\u2019t \u2014 they\ncouldn\u2019t use the money anyway.",
        "Q: Yeah. Had they bought those tickets before?",
        "A: They bought the tickets earlier.",

        "A: I mean, my mother bought them when \u2014 when she knew that they were \u2014 that we\nwere going to live.",

        "Q: Travel agency?",
        "A: \u2014 travel agency, and luckily he had \u2014 had them 1n a safe, and he still had our\ntickets, but my mother was plenty worried that they were gone.",
        "Q: I can imagine. All right, the point is I can\u2019t imagine, but \u2014 but wou \u2014 di \u2014 one\nquestion I wanted to make sure; did you live in a mixed neighborhood? That is \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Okay, so it wasn\u2019t just known as a Juidisches [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, not at all \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 or something like that?",
        "A: \u2014 not at all.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was a very mixed neighborhood.",
        "Q: Okay, so that \u2014",
        "A: I mean, most of the people in our building that ow \u2014 my dad owned, were not\nJewish. There were very few Jews. In fact, I don\u2019t remember any.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No \u2014 yes, the ti\u2014 Hannah Natan(ph), a friend of ours called Nathan, not \u2014 not\nrelated to our Nathan, and she was married to Herr Forte(ph) and they lived in our\nbuilding. I think they\u2019re the only Jewish family that I remember living in our house.",
        "Q: And so that means that the con \u2014 the real estate, had that already been\nconfiscated, the building itself, or is it \u2014 you lost that when you left?",
        "A: Lost that when we left. My father lost \u2014 lost another \u2014 I think another \u2014 wa \u2014\nsomething called [speaks German], which is some kind of mill and \u2014 and\nwarehouse, and he lost the apartment building, and later on got some restitution. But\nthat\u2019s another story that\u2019s \u2014\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t get a whole lot because it turned out that \u2014 they claimed that there was\na \u2014 what are these insects that eat wood?",
        "Q: Termites.",
        "A: Yeah, termites, which were not true, and there were all kinds of things said about\nthat house, so he got the very minimal amount for it, but he got something for it.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the apartment house?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, it had been made of wood?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Was it built from wood?",
        "A: Not really, not really. The whole thing was nonsense.",
        "Q: Yeah. So le-le-let\u2019s go \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re jumping a bit, but let\u2019s go to that \u2014 that\nsection. We\u2019re talking now after the war. When did \u2014 when \u2014 what was the process\nof trying to get some sort of restitu \u2014 you know, recompense?",
        "A: That dragged out oda \u2014 over years.",
        "Q: When did it start? When did \u2014 when did he find in \u2014",
        "A: Probably in the 50s.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: And I really don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t have a really good sense of the years. But my\nparents, as I said, got some restitution for the apartment house they shared with my\naunt and uncle. And I think for some other things. I wanted to get \u2014 get restitution\nfor interruption of education. Now, I didn\u2019t have a lot of interruption, but I did have\ninterruption.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And most of my friends, including my brother, got the restitution. It was like a\nthousand marks or 2,000 marks. And I got a letter from Wiesbaden saying I should\nbe grateful that I was Jewish, otherwise I would end up in the German army, and\nwho knows where I would be. And besides, I have a PhD degree. What am I\ncomplaining about?",
        "Q: Oh my God.",
        "A: So I went to court, and lost. And once you lose in the local court, you have to go\nto a court of appeals, where you have to pay a percentage, or a \u2014 actually have to\npay a\u2014 nota percentage, you have to pay a fee to the lawyer, and even the lawyer\nsaid, don\u2019t gamble 20 percent of what you might get, for the fact that you might get,\nbecause you might not get it. And so we gave it up. And then when \u2014 when \u2014 when\nthe people who got the restitution for the interruption of education got a second\nround \u2014 of course, I didn\u2019t get the second round, because I didn\u2019t get the first round.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that wasn\u2019t too serious because it really wasn\u2019t a huge amount of money.",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s the point of the thing, however.",
        "A: But the point is that \u2014 that whole premise that I should be \u2014",
        "Q: Grateful.",
        "A: \u2014 write a thank you note to Hitler or something because I wasn\u2019t drafted into the\nGerman army, were sort of ridiculous, but the re \u2014",
        "Q: I can\u2019t imagine you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the courts held that.",
        "Q: Yeah. I can\u2019t imagine that somebody would have had the audacity in the postwar\nyears to write that.",
        "A: Well, you know \u2014 what apparently happened is that the Wiesbaden court, or \u2014 or\n_or\u2014",
        "Q: Authority?",
        "A: \u2014 government \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 was very generous for a while, and suddenly realized they were being too\ngenerous and they kind of had a backlash and g-got \u2014 got the other way. But the fact\nthat the judges would write a stupid thing like that, 1-1s really hard to understand.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: And this took place th \u2014 in which decade? When, you know, that process\nhappened, where you got rejected for your restitution claim?",
        "A: That whi \u2014 whi \u2014 while I was in \u2014 already \u2014 I already had, I think finished my\neducation here, and had a PhD in chemistry. So I had a good education, but I s \u2014 I\nsaid anything, which was true, that I had thought about going to medical school, and\nthat I couldn\u2019t do, and well, I mean, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t do because of a change in\ncountry, and they didn\u2019t pay any attention to that.",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: Especially since, I think, a PhD in \u2014 in Germany the PhD is considered somewa\n\u2014 somewhat higher than a \u2014 than an MD.",
        "Q: I know, I know, it\u2019s that, Herr doctor, doctor.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: System.",
        "A: And Frau doctor.",
        "Q: Frau doctor, yeah, exactly. So this must have been in the 60s or 70s.",
        "A: Ah, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Ah, yes, yeah, 60s, I think.",
        "Q: It must have been a \u2014\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: It may have started a little earlier, but I \u2014 I can\u2019t be sure.",
        "Q: Yeah. The \u2014 the Dutch lady who came to kind of escort your father out of\ndanger, when you said goodbye to him, was that something that you remember, or\nwas it, oh, we'll see you soon in Amsterdam?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t go to the \u2014 to the station with him.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I mean, we said goodbye at home \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 but I\u2014 we felt pretty confident that we would be reunited pretty soon.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Since we had this one month \u2014 well, at that time we didn\u2019t know that, but I don\u2019t\nremember be-being too upset.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. And \u2014 and wh-what\u2019s more, you had both affidavits and visas,\nwhich a lot of other people did not have.",
        "A: Oh my goodness. In fact, at that time, and \u2014 D-Dutch did not leave \u2014 let Jewish\npeople without visas to go somewhere else into the country. He would not have\nbeen able to get in.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So tell me a little bit about the trip when you left your home. Do you\nremember what it was like to close the door for the last time?\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: I\u2014I remember being excited about traveling and probably not so upset about\nleaving \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014my home, because of all the \u2014 what wa \u2014 that was going on, and looking\nforward to seeing my dad, and looking forward to having a boat trip, and there was\nso much going on.",
        "Q: Did you by train or by car to Amsterdam?",
        "A: I think we went by train. Yeah, oh yeah, definitely went by train. My mother\ndidn\u2019t have her license, didn\u2019t drive.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In fact, my dad didn\u2019t have a license until probably in the mid se \u2014 se \u2014 or late\n30s, because he had a chauffeur for a good deal of his adult life, until he couldn\u2019t\neither afford, or have it any more, and then he finally learned how to drive.",
        "Q: What kind of car was it?",
        "A: He \u2014 he drove a number of cars, he drove an Audi, he drove Mercedes Benz and\nhe drove, I think, an Adler, which was a car that hadn't exist in a long time. I had a\nAdler bicycle, with three gears.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: At that time, that was huge.",
        "Q: Oh yeah. So the car that was confiscated, which one \u2014 which one of those \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I think it was a Mercedes Benz, but I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Okay. The time when you were driving around, when your mother picked you up\nfrom school, and your father didn\u2019t want to go \u2014",
        "A: No, no, my father wa \u2014 picked \u2014 picked \u2014 I mean, my father drove, my da \u2014 my \u2014\nmy mother \u2014",
        "Q: Okay \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 my mother never drove, actually, she \u2014 she got a license in this country, but\nshe used it for cashing checks. She never \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. So I mean \u2014 I misspoke. What I meant is, you were picked up from school\nby your mom, but your father was driving around in the car.",
        "A: Yeah, he was sitting in the car.",
        "Q: Right.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: Right. He was \u2014",
        "Q: What did you see in the streets? This 1s what I\u2019m saying. If you were driving\naround Wiesbaden, did you see damage in the streets?",

        "A: So I didn\u2019t know about the fire until I \u2014 until much later \u2014 I mean, I knew it was\n\u2014 that it had burned, but I didn\u2019t see it.",
        "Q: Yeah. In the month that you were there, after your father had gone, did you have\ncontact with other people from the community, and discussions with them, or were\nyou able to gauge \u2014",
        "A: Certainly with our relatives, I think we had discussion. I don\u2019t remember what\nfriends we had discussions with. I mean, many of our friends had left, too.",

And we,\nbeing December, we got into lots of storms, and I remember distinctly we were \u2014\nthere was an SOS apparently from the Queen Mary. And so we were supposed to\ngo to their aid. By the time we got close to the Queen Mary, everything had been\ntaken care of and they were okay. But it was so stormy that most people in the boat\nwere So seasick that they didn\u2019t eat.

        "Q: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s interesting with \u201cSnow White,\u201d because there have been other\npeople that I\u2019ve spoken with who recall seeing \u201cSnow White\u201d in the theaters in\nEurope before the war.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It came out in the late 30s, and \u2014 and that makes sense.",
        "A: It\u2019s funny, in th \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the theaters in Wiesbaden, I saw \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\nsaw any American picture. I think they were all German pictures that I saw, pretty\nmuch.",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and I thought I\u2019d asked them all. No. I didn\u2019t ask you about the news and the\npropaganda. How much new \u2014 what newspapers did you read, and did you listen to\nthe radio, and how \u2014 what was \u2014 what was going on, what kind of information\nwould you get?",
        "A: Well, I can answer it this way, we \u2014 we were at the Wiesbadener Tagblatt, that\nthing, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine [indecipherable]. We listened to the radio,\nand we tried to get British stations, which wasn\u2019t always successful and I\u2019m not\nsure that we cou \u2014 wouldn\u2019t have been in trouble if it \u2014 we\u2019d a been caught. And the\nJune 21, 2014\nthing was very upsetting is the \u2014 the \u2014 \u201cDer Stiirmer,\u201d the anti-Semitic newspaper\nwas in boxes all over the \u2014 the streets of Wiesbaden, people standing in front of it,\nreading about those horrible creatures, the Jews, and all the misery they brought to\nGermany.

And I know, even I was\nonly 12 years old, 1t was 1936, I was extremely upset. I knew enough to know that\nthat couldn\u2019t be good.

        "A: No, I mean, he was really very popular with German kids of that time.",
        "Q: Yeah. So, okay, so we talked a little bit about the overall media situation, and the\nnewspapers that you mentioned, Frankfurter Allgemeine and Wiesbadener\nTagblatt, were they more or less news oriented, or did politics and propaganda end\nup in their pages as well?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have a clear recollection of that.",
        "Q: Okay.",

And \u2014 and no, I wou\n\u2014 it definitely was a culture shock. And di \u2014 in general it was a very good\nexperience. My high school had a maybe \u2014 at that time maybe 20 percent Jewish\nstudent population. And there was a little bit of cliquishness tha \u2014 there.

        "Q: Sure, coming back to America, and you regre \u2014 and you\u2019re drafted. So you\nfinish in two and a half years and that means 1944 or \u201945 now?",
        "A: Nineteen \u2014 I graduated in the summer of 1944.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Okay, so the war\u2019s still on.",
        "A: And when I wanted to go back to is that summer of 1944, early summer, my\nbrother came to me and said, there\u2019s a weekend at Camp Wise(ph), which was a\ncamp, I guess at that time largely Jewish children, who paid according to their\nability to pay. Was a \u2014 was actually organized or \u2014 and the money was given by this\nSam Wise(ph) who was the \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 millionaire with whom my friend Henry Stern(ph) was living.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And why don\u2019t you come \u2014 they\u2019re having a weekend to train people to be\ncounselors, and then if you want to, you can go up there for two weeks as a\ncounselor, or [indecipherable] m-more, if you want. I said no, I\u2019m not interested.\nUnbeknownst to me, Irene went exactly through the same process, her girlfriend\nwanted to take her that weekend and she di \u2014 wasn\u2019t interested. Finally both of us\ngave in \u2014 she to her friend Esther, and I to my brother Walter, and we went to \u2014 to\nthat weekend where the staff was training the counselors. And I was in a taxi from\nthe train to the camp, sitting in the back with a young woman I have never met on\nmy lap, cause we were so many people. And all of a sudden, this very beautiful\nyoung girl got into the front seat next to my brother. I take one look at her and I \u2014 I\nJune 21, 2014\nsaid to myself, I \u2014 I want to get to know her better. And that turned out to be Irene\nRannis(ph). And when I got out \u2014 out of the ca-cab, I ta-talked to her and we\nlooked at each other and that was it.",
        "Q: That was it. You were how old?",
        "A: I was 20, a-and she was 19. And she was engaged to somebody else, but we fell\nfor each other immediately, and didn\u2019t eat anything that whole week, we kept\nstaring at each other and being together, and \u2014 and the rest is history. We\u2019re now\nmarried almost 67 years.",
        "Q: Congratulations.",
        "A: Thank you very much.",
        "Q: Congratulations to you both.",

        "A: And my retirement.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So \u2014",
        "A: So, we ha-had a very good weekend \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and then we dated, then I went in the army.",
        "Q: What was your \u2014",
        "A: And we wrote each other every day, and when I came home, I went to graduate\nschool the University of Chicago in organic chemistry.",
        "Q: When you were drafted in the army, how long were \u2014 was your military service,\nand what did it comprise?",
        "A: I was only \u2014 I was very lucky. I went into the army in 19 \u2014 in September \u201944, and\nwas sent immediately to infantry basic training in Alabama. I forget, Fort\nMcClellan, I think. And I had a really rough basic training. They put me in heavy\nweapons, which means artillery, and it was a very rough basic training, I mean, but\nwe did other \u2014 we shot rifles, we did bayonet training and the whole bit. And we\nwere spec \u2014 I found out later we were supposed to be sent \u2014 1n fact, our \u2014 the \u2014 our\nwhole troop was sent to the Battle of the Bulge. But they pulled me out because I\nhad a college degree. I mean, I really had a lucky life. Because I had the degree in\nscience \u2014 engineering, they pulled me out and sent me to Ohio State University,\nJune 21, 2014\nwhich was very convenient because my girlfriend lived in Cleveland, and I was in\nColumbus, which wasn\u2019t too bad. So we actually dated on weekends, I either went\nto Cleveland or she came to Columbus \u2014 you came to Columbus once. And then I\nfound out later I was supposed \u2014 I [indecipherable] enter, because they wanted to\nsend me to either Oak Ridge or Los Alamos to work on the atomic bomb.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know that then. I knew they were going to send me to one of these\nplaces, but I didn\u2019t know for what. But when they found out, even though I had\nbeen naturalized in the army as an American citizen during my basic training, they\nwouldn\u2019t send me because I was still considered an enemy alien, even though I was\na citizen and a Jew. And I said, well \u2014 I\u2014 Is \u2014I asked them later, why didn\u2019t you\ntry to find out more about me? He says, no, we didn\u2019t have money or time to\ninvestigate, so we just won\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t take you. So they sent me basically, to\nanother basic training, which was in combat engineers, and that was almost worse\nthan infantry because you had to f-fire rifles while you were building houses.",
        "Q: Oh good God.",
        "A: Or bridges.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: And I got a little fed up with that. I mean, I was very patriotic, but I \u2014 that was a\nbit much, and so I went to what was called classification and looked to see whether\nI could do something more useful. And they actually sent me to Rhode Island,\nwhere I was asked to teach English to German PWs.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. These were so called specially picked reliab \u2014 quote, reliable PWs,\nalthough some of them were as high as colonels, so I\u2019m not sure how reliable they\nwere, how anti-Nazi they were, but I taught a Berlitz type English, which was very\ninteresting because one \u2014 two of my friends, one was from Brooklyn and one was\nfrom the south, they didn\u2019t take \u2014 they didn\u2019t speak a \u2014 a general \u2014 general enough\nEnglish \u2014 Midwestern enough English, they took me. So my \u2014 my \u2014 my accent was\nalready pretty good, but it was fun to do, and I did that \u2014",
        "Q: What ki \u2014 well, you said POWs?",
        "A: Yes, they were ger \u2014",
        "Q: So POW - so, did you speak with them, did you talk to them?",
        "A: I\u2014I didn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t allowed to tell them that I spoke German, because the-they\nwanted them to have the entire class conducted in English and nobody lapse into\nGerman. So they didn\u2019t know I was German. I overheard a few things.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s one of the thi \u2014 yeah.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know I could understand. So I was there about a year or so, I think,\nand then they shipped me to another POW camp in Virginia, where I taught \u2014 they\nhad several very distinguished lecturers on American democracy and the two party\nsystem, and you know, the whole American \u2014",
        "Q: The whole nine yards.",
        "A: \u2014 politics and history and civics.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I was one of the discussion leaders, as a \u2014 after that lecture, we would ha \u2014\nbreak up into smaller groups, and ha \u2014 and we would lead \u2014 and those I did in\nEnglish, because they really didn\u2019t understand enough German to conduct that in\nGerman. So they \u2014 I was allowed speak English with them, because they were \u2014\npresumably knew some ger \u2014 I wasn\u2019t teaching English at that point, I was leading\ndiscussions on American democracy and things like that.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of those discussions and how they would \u2014",
        "A: No, not much.",
        "Q: No. Okay.",
        "A: I remember the professors who gave lectures. They had one called Homer\nSmith \u2014 not Homer Smith, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t remember his first name. I think from\nNorthwestern, who was a very distinguished philosopher. And also a \u2014 a Professor\nJune 21, 2014\nJones, who\u2019s also, I think, University of Chicago, somewhere. Also a very\ndistinguished philosopher, and they gave many of the lectures. By the way the \u2014 my\nboss, my o \u2014 ca \u2014 officer in the first camp where I taught English was Henry Lee\nSmith, I think that was the name, who had a program on the radio where he would\nguess where people were born and where they were brought up. He was a \u2014 like a\nlinguist who didn\u2019t speak too many languages, but he \u2014 incredible at knowing\naccents and learning accent and knowing how to distinguish accents. So he would\nsay, oh you were born in New York, but you grew up in Pennsylvania and you \u2014",
        "Q: Oh my gosh, yeah.",
        "A: And I never heard too many of them, but he was on the radio for \u2014 for a very\nlong time, and very nice guy, he was my \u2014 my \u2014",
        "Q: Well, what are some of the things that you overheard in that first POW camp?",
        "A: Tell you the truth, I don\u2019t remember very much. I \u2014 the only \u2014 the only little\nthing I remember was when I was in \u2014 in\u2014I\u2014TI don\u2019t think I heard any real anti-\nSemitic remarks or anything like that, but when I was in Virginia, I accidently yers\n\u2014 used to work meshugah. Do you know the word, that Yiddish word meshugah?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I said to them, anybody know what that means? And somebody raised their\nhand and said, that\u2019s Berlin dialect for verrtickt. Berlin dialect.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, there were some Yiddish words that had gone totally into the German\nlanguage. Schmirastand(ph). The Hitler youth said schmirastand(ph) for \u2014 for\nstanding guard.",
        "Q: Schmirastand.",
        "A: Yes. And the Nazis like the Konidra(ph) tune so much that they played it on the\nradio and called it a Chinese melody or something like that.",
        "Q: The crazy things.",
        "A: But \u2014I don\u2019t remember too many details, but what \u2014 one of the prisoners was a \u2014\nan artist and he painted my portrait. Somebody in my family has it. I think one of\nmy kids.",
        "Q: Well, what was the \u2014 what \u2014 what was the \u2014 did they know by that point \u2014 in the\nsecond camp, did they know that you were German?",
        "A: The ones in Virginia knew because they knew I \u2014 they \u2014 I mean, they asked me\nhow come you speak German so well, I couldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 really deny it. And actually, one of these people came to me one day and told\nme about the ho \u2014 Holocaust, and I didn\u2019t believe him. I said ha \u2014 where da \u2014 people\nJune 21, 2014\ndon\u2019t do things like that, to \u2014 killing \u2014 killing millions of people systematically. I\nmean, I di \u2014 I literally did not believe it.",
        "Q: This is so ironic. An \u2014 a German POW ~- prisoner, comes to you and tells you\nabout the Holocaust taking place.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And y \u2014 and that \u2014",
        "A: Not only that, almost every one of these PWs managed to find a Jewish anc-\nancestor in his family. They were all \u2014 at that time they wanted to be \u2014 they wanted\nto be anti-Hitler. And some of them, I\u2019m sure were all their lives. I mean, there\nwere \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 in fact, in th \u2014 in the first group, where they really wanted to get them ready for\n\u2014 for u \u2014 for u \u2014 for use in military \u2014 in \u2014 1n go \u2014 in govering \u2014 governing Germany,\nthere were some very liberal people. The trouble was they didn\u2019t always get very far\nbecause if they were social democrats, the ger \u2014 Americans unfortunately se \u2014\nthough they were communists.",
        "Q: Communists.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: But, 1t was a very \u2014 it\u2019s somewhat very interesting experience, it\u2019s there,\nabsolutely. The \u2014 no, I mean, was totally shocked and I really \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 which\nbrings me back to Germany for a \u2014 for a minute, if you don\u2019t mind.",
        "Q: Okay. Oh, this is exactly what I \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: What I \u2014 I\u2019m say da \u2014 but not when I was there, but actually when I was visiting.\nWe were invited back to germ \u2014 to Wiesbaden. You know, they invited \u2014 most of\nthe cities invited their former surviving Jewish citizens back to visit. And we were\ninvited, my wife and I and my brother and his wife were invited back to\nWiesbaden.",
        "Q: Can you count \u2014 tell me a year?",
        "A: I believe in the \u2014 in the middle of late thir \u2014 90s.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I went to \u2014 as I mentioned, I think, earlier, I went to speak to the\nGutenberg gymnasium where I had gone to school. And the kids were very\ninterested, and I spoke in German, which I was fortunate to be able to do. And the\nprofessor was a friend of mine, whom I had met \u2014 previously had come to our house\nwith his wife, stayed with us a few days. I believe that was before \u2014 or after, I\u2019m not\nsure. But anyway, the \u2014 he mentioned to me that he had a so \u2014 given them a list of\nbooks to read. And the kids were about for \u2014 15 or 16, picked a book on Holocaust,\nJune 21, 2014\ncalled [speaks German]. It was by a German boy, non-Jewish boy called\nFriedisch(ph) \u2014 I believe it was Friedisch(ph). I think he was the \u2014 the Gentile boy,\nwho lived in the same apartment building with a family that had a Jewish boy his\nage, and they became very, very close friends. I read that book in one night, it was\nan incredible book. And it gave the \u2014 the Jewish situation in Germany from the\npoint of view of this Christian boy with \u2014 who had this close Jewish friend. And the\none scene I remember so vividly, is the Christian dad talking with the Jewish dad\nand saying, why don\u2019t you get out of here? Y-You see that they\u2019re not very nice to\nyou and that it could get worse \u2014",
        "Q: Worse.",
        "A: \u2014 and more dangerous, and leave. Take your family with you. And the Jewish\ndad said look, if this were the Middle Ages, and I would have to fear for my life, I\nwould leave tomorrow. But this is Germany in the 20\" century, a civilized country.\nI don\u2019t have to fear for my life, and eventually Hitler will be gone and things will\nbe normal again. This was such a common \u2014",
        "Q: Refrain.",
        "A: \u2014 frame of mind for \u2014 for Jewish people. Whether they believed it or not, they\ncertainly rationalized that \u2014 that they would \u2014 nobody would harm them physically,\nbecause it was a civilized country. And to some extent my parents, I\u2019m sure used\nJune 21, 2014\nthat argument as well. But it was really strike \u2014 and we discussed that book when I\nspoke to the class, and of course they asked me questions about my experiences.",
        "Q: Was there anything that they said in those discussions that also stay with you?",
        "A: One thing stayed with me is that I really couldn\u2019t answer very well, and when a \u2014\na boy said, we\u2019re paying restitution to our former Jewish citizens, who were clearly\nbadly hurt. But why should we, the third generation, who had nothing to do with\nthis, why should we \u2014 should we pay this? And I didn\u2019t have a good answer. I don\u2019t\nremember what I said. You can argue this both ways, you could say look, your gra \u2014\nyour grandparents did this, and so our \u2014 some of your grandparents, and so you\u2019re\nstill paying for what they did, just as \u2014 as in this country some people are\nadvocating restitution for the slaves. And we\u2019re certainly not responsible for\nslavery. And some argue that they\u2019re really not guilty. They \u2014 they weren\u2019t born.\nSomething that\u2019s very difficult to \u2014",
        "Q: For you to come down on one side or the other?",
        "A: Right. Exactly, exactly.",
        "Q: Well, tell me a little bit about \u2014 I mean, where \u2014 again, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re skipping\ncertain topics, but this sounds like an appropriate moment to ask, so what are your\nfeelings about Germany? Many people who left never went back, never have any\ncontacts, never engaged \u2014\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: And I know many.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I understand perfectly. And especially when if you were in a concentration\ncamp, or you were close to being gassed, or you have relatives that were murdered,\nI could totally understand. But having not had these horrible experiences, I would \u2014\ndidn\u2019t feel quite that strongly, but it took me a very long time to want to go back.",
        "Q: Did it really?",
        "A: It did. When we finally were invited back, I think that was the first time we went\nto Germany. No, we were there once before. I was on a sabbatical in Paris, and I\ntook my family to Wiesbaden to see where I grew up.",
        "Q: But that would have been [indecipherable]",
        "A: We were very uncomfortable, because we didn\u2019t know anybody, and the kids\neven were uncomfortable, and so we stayed about a day or two days and drove to\nBasel and went to Switzerland. Well, when I was invited back, it was already the\nthird generation. The second generation was terrible. In other words, the people\nwho were the children of the people who did some of these things, were t \u2014 didn\u2019t\nwant to talk about it. They were embarrassed, they were ashamed, and they\nwouldn\u2019t bring it up in school. The Holocaust simply wasn\u2019t discussed. And we, of\ncourse, resented that.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But the third generation was totally different. They wanted to know the answers,\nthey wanted to ask questions, they wanted to know what happened. How \u2014 how\nwere their families involved and not involved. So that was something that made me\nfeel that it\u2019s time to forgive these chil \u2014 these children who \u2014 who had really\nbasically nothing to do with it. They might be in \u2014 I might have parents who anti-\nSemitic \u2014 who brainwashed them, that I can\u2019t \u2014 but I can\u2019t exclude that in any\ncountry.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I felt that this generation deserved at least a little bit more of an \u2014 of a\nrapprochement than the previous generations. And that\u2019s why I was willing to go\nthere, and went back for scientific purposes. In other words, for visiting fellow\nscientists in Germany, for going to ger \u2014 meetings in Germany. In fact, my first\nvisit to Berlin was for a scientific meeting, maybe 10 years ago or something, first\ntime [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah, it sounds like when this happened, as this developed, it was pretty late.\nThat is, it\u2019s decades after you\u2019ve left.",
        "A: Oh yes, it was \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s not \u2014\n100\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was in the 90s that that happened.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m quite sure. So it was like si \u2014 60 years in the \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Fifty or 60 years after I left. Yes, because by that time the people who \u2014 who\npurp \u2014 perpetrated all this were e1-either dead or extremely old.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The second generation was also getting older and the third generation really was\nmaking an attempt to know and to make up for what happened.",
        "Q: When you talk about the second generation, 1s that what you experienced when\nyou went back to Germany? That first time was a family visit.",
        "A: Actually, not directly, too much.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I mean, I\u2014 we went to \u2014 I was at a laundry mat, I think and told the people that I\n\u2014 they asked why \u2014 why I spoke German so well, and she told them I was born\nthere. And she basically said, why did he come back? I \u2014 if I were \u2014 if I were a Jew\nI wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t come back, I mean, after what happened. Something like\nthat. And so we actually got people who were decent and didn\u2019t have a direct\nexperience, I heard a lot of things where people went to school and \u2014 and \u2014 friends\n101June 21, 2014\nof ours, who said their parent were basically Nazis.

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Her parents were real Nazis and left and fled to South America, and at home\nshe couldn\u2019t open her mouth, because her parents were so pro-Hitler and anti-\nJewish and everything else.

They built a\nJewish museum [speaks German] and they collect documents from, and invite \u2014\nthey were in \u2014 they were also involved in our invitation to Wiesbaden and I gave\nthem actually my mother\u2019s passport, and a few of the documents that I had left from\n\u2014 from Germany, and they set up a museum. And they had \u2014 constantly doing work\nto recognize people who hi-hid Jews, people who did heroic things, and Jews who \u2014\nwho perished. And they have stolpersteine, have you ever have stolpersteine?",
        "Q: No.",

        "A: In Wiesbaden and in many cities for people who perished, and have a pla\u2014a-\u2014a\n\u2014 a monument where the da \u2014 where the synagogue used to stand, and things like\nthat, all done by this group, none of whom \u2014 maybe one was Jewish, but most of\n103June 21, 2014\nthem were not. And they\u2019re still very active. And then I mentioned, I think earlier,\nin Limburg they have a group co \u2014 a Christian \u2014 a Christian Jewish \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 society, that works together. And I was very impressed with these people. And\nI can tell you, only one instance that really impressed me enormously. They\npersuaded the mayor of Wiesbaden, and the governance of Wiesbaden to change\nthe name of this street, which had some nondescript name, Kurnigstrasse(ph) or \u2014",
        "Q: Something like that, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 to the Gebruder(ph) or the Geshvista(ph) I don\u2019t remember the name,\nStoltz(ph), something like that, a Jewish brother and sister. And underneath it says,\nermordet \u2014 murdered on July so and so, 1942. And the street has that on it in \u2014 in\npermanence.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I thought that was an extremely courageous and very decent thing to do, is\nto actually have a street named after two Jew-Jewish children who were murdered\nin the Holocaust. And they did \u2014",
        "Q: Maybe they lived on that street?",

        "A: Yeah, I think they picked the street cause it didn\u2019t have a particularly important\nname, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. But that was \u2014 and the ceremony that we were\nat when this was done, I mean, the mayor was there, th-the members of the c \u2014 city\ncouncil, whatever and all kinds of \u2014 of somebody \u2014 I think somebody from the\ngovernment of hess \u2014 Hessen was there, and it was really a big deal.

        "A: Exactly, absolutely. I mean, I still have some feelings, obviously, that that could\nhappen in a co \u2014 1n a country as quote civilized as Germany, that produced the\nBeethoven, that produced the Einstein, that produced people like that, and that that\ncould happen is still incredible to me. And when there\u2019s a sports contest, I often\nroot against Germany. It\u2019s just something, and I \u2014 while I buy German \u2014 some\n105June 21, 2014\nGerman product \u2014 I \u2014 I can\u2019t get myself to buy a German car, even though they\u2019 re\nvery good. And so there\u2019s still some of these prejudices left, and I\u2019m \u2014 it\u2019s not\nsurprising. But I can see when people have direct loved ones that perished, and \u2014\nare going to be much more anti than somebody like me, who was fortunate enough\nnot to have any close friends or relatives that perished in the Holocaust.",

        "A: \u2014 acceptance. And the-they discharged me. And I went to the University chica \u2014\nChicago and took a master\u2019s and PhD degree in organic chemistry. Now this 1s\nvery interesting. I didn\u2019t take any biology courses, but I audited biochemistry. And I\ncame to the realization that while I enjoyed organic chemistry to a degree, I didn\u2019t\nenjoy reading the literature. I mean, I would look at the Journal Organic Chemistry\nand it would say, a new synthesis in the anthraquinone series. And I said, who\ncares? But when I learned something about biochemistry, and at that time was the\ntime when it \u2014 what was called [indecipherable] very, very much in the research\narea. In other words, how the body metabolizes food to create energy, to create\ngrowth. And that was so exciting, and I made up my mind right then and then, as I\nwas a graduate student, that I wanted to get into biochemistry. And when I finished\nmy PhD thesis, which was a strictly organic chemistry thesis, with a prof \u2014 very\n108June 21, 2014\nfamous professor called Professor Morris Kharasch, who almost got the Nobel\nPrize because he \u2014 he developed a new \u2014 brand new field in organic chemistry, the\nfield of \u2014 of free radicals in solution. When I received my \u2014 finally received my\ndegree, and I was in graduate school almost five years, that was because he was\nvery demanding, and the \u2014 there wasn\u2019t this \u2014 a closed project, 1t wasn\u2019t finish \u2014\nfinished, he would \u2014 he would say now finish this, okay, Pll give you another\nproject. But I mean, eventually got out and di-did fine. I actually applied for a\nfellowship. At that time the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Polio\nFoundation, gave a fellowship specifically for people who were in the hard sciences\nlike physics and chemistry and wanted to get into biology. And so I took a\u2014I-\u2014I-I\nge \u2014I got this, and it was \u2014 I was one of the winners, and I took a postdoctoral\nfellowship for two years at Columbia, and at that time Irene and I \u2014 and I haven\u2019t\nsaid anything about my family life, but I will \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 at least briefly \u2014 decided we\u2019re going to go to New York, but we\u2019ll be there for\ntwo years and then we\u2019ll move to a nice, small college town, where I can walk or\nbicycle to work.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Where I worked on a \u2014 on a project on muscular dystrophy. It actually was a\nproject on vitamin E metabolism because the only model of muscular dystrophy\nthat was known at the time were rabbits that got flabby muscles by not eating\nenough vitamin E, having a vitamin E deficiency. And we made some interesting\ndiscoveries in that area. But I didn\u2019t stay in there. What happened was I \u2014 my boss,\nDr. Millrat(ph) was the medical director of the muscular dystrophy foundation of\nAmerica, and they built him \u2014 Cornell built him an institute for muscle disease.\nAnd of course, as usual, not ready when it was supposed to be ready, so I took a sort\nof sabbatical at NYU in a friend\u2019s lab, Werner Maas(ph), also a German refugee.\nAnd spent a year there. And during the year, Professor Louis Thomas \u2014 you may\nhave heard his name, I don\u2019t know. He was not only an outstanding scientist and\nphysician, he was author of a number of books. Li\u2014 \u201cThe Lives of the Cell,\u201d An\nevening with \u2014 with \u2014 with Moller(ph), I think, a medicine [indecipherable] signs\n110June 21, 2014\nwere \u2014 by the way, I have a paragraph that he wrote about me to his \u2014 that sort of\nautobiographical book. Anyway, Louis Thomas approached me about coming to\nNYU and gave me a very nice position as assistant professor at NYU in department\nof medicine. He wanted me strictly \u2014 I mean, \u2019'm \u2014 I\u2019m a PhD, I\u2019m not an MD, so\nthe only thing I could do was research, and I got a teaching appointment in \u2014 at that\ntime spa \u2014 microbiology, cause that\u2019s where my \u2014 that\u2019s where I was with Werner\nMaas(ph). So I had an appointment for \u2014 do research in medicine, and \u2014 and \u2014 and a\nteaching appointment in microbiology. And after I was there a fairly short period,\nmaybe a year, I\u2014 my \u2014 my boss, Dr. Thomas came to me and said, the city of New\nYork is setting up a \u2014 something called the Research Council of New York. And\none of the purposes, the main purpose of this organization is to give what they call\ncareer awards to young, promising scientists to keep them in the city. I\u2019d like for\nyou to apply, and if you do that, I\u2019d like you to think about maybe \u2014 even though I\ndon\u2019t want you to give up what you\u2019re doing if you\u2019re so interested in it. But I'd\nlike you to think about something you could do that might interest a city, that might\nmake it easier for you to get the fellowship, the research career award. To make a\nlong story short, I chose drug addiction as something would interest a city.",

I edit \u2014\nI audited some courses at Columbia when I was post-doc, and I order \u2014 audited\nsome more at NYU, and I read. It wasn\u2019t easy, but it was fun. And I got the\nfellowship, obviously. I had it for 15 years, I didn\u2019t lose it, I\u2014 we lost the research\ncouncil, it went belly up. The city decided it didn\u2019t have the money \u2014",

        "Q: But you were si\u2014 you \u2014 but you were at NYU, so NYU \u2014",
        "A: I was at NYU, in fact about 20 or 30 professors at NYU had \u2014 had these, and\nequal number at Columbia and quite a number at Cornell, and Albert Einstein,\neverywhere. So they gave out \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many, but they gave out a \u2014\nmaybe a hundred a year or something. And we had annual meetings where we\nreported our results. And then they went belly up, and I had to put at least part of\nmy salary on my grant. But I\u2014 I stayed at NYU the rest of my career. I had a couple\nof possibilities of becoming chairman, but I didn\u2019t go. And I \u2014 what I accomplished\nwas I published about 270 papers, basically in the area of opiate \u2014 opiate research,\n112June 21, 2014\nhow does the brain react to opiate, what do \u2014 what do they do when they get there.\nAnd the major be \u2014 discovery we made was discover the so-called opiate rezept \u2014\nreceptors 1n the brain.",

        "Q: The high?",
        "A: The highs, the lows an-and you know, the dysphoria in some cases. The pain\nrelief. All the things they do, they do many things. The respiratory depression,\nwhich kills you within \u2014 when you get \u2014 when you have an overdose. All these can\nonly be done \u2014 can only happen if the drug binds to the opiate receptors, to these\nprotein molecules.",

So 1-1t\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s been a very, very, very\ngratifying to ha \u2014 be recognized by one\u2019s peers. My \u2014 my medical school has also\nbeen very generous. In 2005 they did an all-day symposium in my honor. Oh, by the\nway, in 1997, I believe, a journal called Neurochemical Research did a \u2014 a whole\nvolume in my honor, with my picture with an article by a colleague, Dr. Huda(ph)\nAkeel(ph), a Syrian born, lovely lady with the University of Michigan, who wrote\nan article about why I deserved the honor.

Didn\u2019t really\nappreciate, as I did la-later on, as I will tell you in a minute. So I was there for a\nvery long time, the idea was that the mountain air is good for TB. And the\nfollowing year they send me back again, I think also for most of the winter, to\nanother \u2014 but this one \u2014 this \u2014 this one time was a much more pleasant, Jewish\nJune 21, 2014\nkinderheim in Celerina, which is the town between Samadan(ph), or\nSamadan(ph), and Saint Moritz. And that time I had my brother with me, an-and I\nwas a little older and I had a very good time, and I learned how to ski. I mean, I\nlearned the rudimentary \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 aspects of it, snowplows and \u2014 and m-my dad came to visit, and show you how\nbrothers can differ, I said \u2014 I ju \u2014I was starting to run into his arms because I was\nso happy to see him, and my brother said, no, first we\u2019re gonna finish the sled ride\ndown the mountain [indecipherable]. But we had a wonderful time \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 seeing him, we still enjoyed seeing him.",
        "A: And \u2014 and that was actually a very interesting \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 experience.",
        "A: Oh yes, we \u2014 you know, we had our fights, as most children, especially that\nclose, two boys do. But we were always very close, we \u2014 we ch \u2014 shared a bedroom\nand we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t go to sleep without saying [speaks German]\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: Right. So, and then I really became very interested in winter sports, and I \u2014 my\ndad, and then following when \u2014 as I became a little older, like 10 - 11, my dad to-\ntook me with him. My par \u2014 my parents took separate vacations. I haven\u2019t told you\nmuch about the business \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014my mother enjoyed working in the business. So she was basically office\nmanager, bookkeeper, accountant, whatever, and in-in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in \u2014 1n the\n[indecipherable] which was in our building, so she didn\u2019t have to go anywhere.\nBut they didn\u2019t take vacation together, somebody had to be there for the business,\nso they \u2014 my mother went with his sister, my dad went pretty much by himself, but\nmet some people he knew that came every year in Saint Moritz.",
        "A: So at that time it wasn\u2019t quite as \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 as fa \u2014 posh as it is now, but it was still a beautiful resort, and he took me with\nhim for \u2014 from \u2014 I guess from the time \u2014 from what, 11 to 13. Thirteen was in 1937,\nJune 21, 2014\nand it was the last time we were able to go to Switzerland. Now, my dad waited a\nlong time, and I\u2019|l explain that, to emigrate, and Pll explain that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 very carefully. But he clearly knew it was coming, because one of the reasons\nfor going on all these vacations was that \u2014 to smuggle money out of Germany.",
        "A: Absolutely, he started that very early. He would go to Switzerland \u2014 first of all,\nyou had \u2014 the Germans gave you a certain amount of foreign money, they allowed\nyou a certain amount of money to change to \u2014 so let\u2019s say in the case of Swiss\nfrancs, or Dutch guilder, you had a couple of thousand dollars, whatever it was, he\nwould live in a little cheaper hotel, save some money, put it in a bank in\nSwitzerland or Holland, Belgium, wherever we went. He also took along a\n[indecipherable] or contacts, and sold it there. In addition, I found out later they\nbought a row house in Philadelphia. So \u2014",
        "A: They really in \u2014 in the fi \u2014 the idea that we may go there, and we \u2014 or go to the\nUnited States. And so they \u2014 they were really quite foresighted in that sense.",
        "A: Right.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: Yeah, but he didn\u2019t even apply for a \u2014 for a visa, but Ill explain that in a minute.\nSo my mother was made \u2014 mainly in the business, so she hired a both some \u2014 some\nhelp in the kitchen, and you know, like a \u2014 a maid \u2014 a maid.",
        "A: But she also, from time to time hired a nursemaid for \u2014 for the two boys.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 since she ur \u2014 worked quite a bit. She almost always had a maid, as long as we\nwere allowed to have them. And from time to time quite often had also, at least on\nweekends, a nursemaid for us.",
        "A: I-In the beginning, yeah. Early on, as they were there quite a long time and \u2014 and\nbecame sort of a part of the family, I mean, really \u2014 even had Christmas trees for the\nmaids, which we enjoyed too, at Christmastime. Later on, of course, these things\nchanged a lot. When the Nuremberg laws came out, we had to have a maid over\nJune 21, 2014\nsay 55 years old, and wa \u2014 while the lady was very nice, we never became that\nclose. But I had, I-I remember, at least one young woman that took care of us on\nweekends when we were already a little older, when I was maybe 10 or 11, and my\nbrother was a year and a half younger, whom I had a terrible crush on. She was\nvery, very pretty. And so the reason my par \u2014 well, first of all, let me say something\nabout the times.",
        "A: We \u2014 it was \u2014 as soon as the Nazis came to power, things did change pretty\nquickly.",
        "A: Actually, you know, clearly not as much as it did later on, but very quickly we\ncouldn\u2019t go to our swimming pool, our favorite swimming pool. We couldn\u2019t go \u2014\nmy \u2014 my dad belonged to a luft bad \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 which was basically the German equivalent of an all male nudist colony. They\nwent there to walk around in the nude and take sun baths in the nude.",
        "A: And they couldn\u2019t over \u2014 over there. There were \u2014 were signs [speaks German]\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: All over, yeah, also some of the mu \u2014 movie theaters and theaters.",
        "A: Even some park benches, I don\u2019t remember for sure whether \u2014 if that was the\ncase in Wiesbaden. But, I mean, those things became evident.",
        "A: Very soon, I would say \u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u00b034- 735.",
        "A: And they made it more and more difficult for my dad to operate his business. He\nhad al \u2014a-\u2014an [indecipherable] and wholesale grain business. He \u2014 he bought and\nsold, and he he had a \u2014 a \u2014 what do you call it, a \u2014",
        "A: Not exact silo, a\u2014 a warehouse with a thing where you \u2014 where you can put \u2014\nput \u2014 put the grain through into sacks and all \u2014 and all sorts of \u2014 even, I think, some\nmilling. And this warehouse was taken away from him, and what we found out later\nis, it became a \u2014 an arms depot \u2014\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 for the Nazis. And my dad went and took a picture of that warehouse, not\nknowing it was an arms depot, I don\u2019t think he knew, and was immediately hauled\nin by the Gestapo, and questioned and told he was not allowed to take pictures at\nthis. But they let him go that time.",
        "A: Yes, that was probably about \u00b036 - \u201937. Between \u00b036 - \u00b037, I don\u2019t remember\nexactly what year. And then, of course, it became more and more difficult for him\nto do any business. Luckily, he had savings, so he was able to live from about \u00b036 to\n\u2014 until the end of \u201938, when we emigrated to United States \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and had enough left over for us to live a few months before he started to work\nthere. But things got more and more difficult. If \u2014 if a Jewish had wanted to go to a\ngymnasium, there was a quota. And my parents wanted to send me to the\norangienstrasse(ph) gymnasium, I forget, they had a form real gymnasium,\nsomething like that, and they couldn\u2019t get in. But I got into the Gutenberg\ngymnasium, which was a humanistisch gymnasium and a real gymnasium. About\nthe only difference between the humanistic part and the \u2014 and the real part was that\nin humanistic part you took Greek as a second, after Latin \u2014 after Latin and French,\nthen Greek, and the other one you took Latin, French and then English. And I went\nJune 21, 2014\nto the real part of it, and well, only about, I would say six Jewish boys \u2014 this was an\nall boys\u2019 school, and I believe there may have been a girl \u2014 separate girl gymnasium\nas well, six or seven Jewish kids among about 300 students.",
        "A: And I had one very good friend, whom I already had as a friend in the\nVolksschule, whose name I would give you. His name was Vanna(ph) Kahn(ph);\nbecame Warren Kahn(ph) in the United States, and he now retired in Sarasota,\nFlorida, and we still see each other occasionally, as I age.",
        "A: Jewish \u2014 Jewish as well.",
        "A: I did, and I\u2019m \u2014 the one I remember most vividly 1s a \u2014 a boy with the typically\nGerman name of Karl Heinz Mueller(ph).",
        "A: I can\u2019t be get mi \u2014 more German than that.",
        "A: And he used to come to my house, I used to come to his house, played together,\nenjoyed each other, until one day he came to my house and said, Eric, my dad is an\nopera singer, he works for the Startz(ph) Oper, which is a government \u2014\nJune 21, 2014",

I absolutely don\u2019t want to be responsible\nfor that. And I\u2019ve never seen him since, and I have no idea whether he alive or dead.\nI totally lost track.",
        "A: Must have been 12 or 13, because we left when I was 14 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and it happened a little before we left, so it \u2014 probably 13.",
        "A: I was very upset.",
        "A: Very upset. I mean, I wasn\u2019t shocked because I had a feeling this was gonna\ncome. But I was very sad. He wa \u2014 we were very close. But also, around that time, I\nwi\u2014 we'd w \u2014 be walking down the street and \u2014 and people would yell dirty Jew.\n[speaks German] and things like that.

        "A: \u2014 and attacking. And if they di \u2014 the eye \u2014 it\u2019s interesting, the people who knew\nme in high school, in the gymnasium, were very nice to me all year long, except on\none day. One day a year they were \u2014 th-they had to put on the uniform to come to\nschool. It was called Hitlerjugend Werbewoche.",
        "A: It means \u2014",
        "A: Hitlerjugend is the Hitler youth \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 werbewoche means recruiting week, exactly.",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing to recruit, because every German boy who was not Jewish, had\nto belong.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: But they came to \u2014 they \u2014 they propagandized the Hitler youth by coming to\nschool in the uniform, and they were suddenly, totally changed. And they were n-\nnot very nice, and sometimes quite \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 agress \u2014 aggressive. And one year we even ma \u2014 Warren and I ha-had to\nactually fight them off. We stood back to back so we couldn\u2019t be attacked from the\nback and \u2014 and punched, until a very nice gentleman with a cane came along and\nshooed \u2014 shooed these guys away. We were very lucky \u2014",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: No, no, this was out on the street, yeah. This is near the school.",
        "A: No \u2014 well, a couple of them may have been, yes. I don\u2019t remember exactly.",
        "A: There all in uniform \u2014 in Hitler you \u2014 youth un-un-uniform.",

        "A: With?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I mean, it \u2014 not that I was aware of. They were all \u2014 I mean, they \u2014\nfirst of all, even if they did, 1t didn\u2019t show it, because they want \u2014 they wanted their\njobs.",
        "A: So I\u2014I really can\u2019t answer that question.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: I think there was some conversation about that they were very worried that\nHitler might come to power. And I \u2014 my dad had read \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d And I\u2019d like\nto take that occasion to say that my parents didn\u2019t have a lot of formal education,\nbut they were amazingly intellectual. I mean, they had a huge library, they read all\nthe classics, Schiller, Goethe \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Lessing. And they \u2014 they were very b \u2014 very mu \u2014 very much interested in\neducation and in reading.",
        "A: My dad had read \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and so he knew what Hitler was saying about\nthe Jews, and was worried that he meant it. And so, they were concerned, I mean,\nno question about it. And \u2014 but that was about the extent of it.",
        "A: Not that much. I mean, it didn\u2019t happen that often, and I \u2014 it may have been\ndiscussed, but I don\u2019t have any \u2014 any real good recollections that I can give you.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: But I think they were a little concerned about my being 1n a \u2014 in a school with so\nfew Jewish children. And of course, I noticed the discrimination not from the\nchildren, but from the higher ups, immediate \u2014 very, very \u2014 very quickly. I was a\npretty good soccer player, and was what you would call now a striker. And together\nwith the center, whose name was Krempel(ph), I happen to remember his name, we\nscored a lot of goals. And one day my \u2014 the coach came to me and said, you can no\nlonger play on the line, I\u2019m gonna put you in the goal, because you\u2019re not going to\nbe playing in the interschool game, because you\u2019re Jewish. And then I played goal\nfor a while, and then I was out altogether. And the other time I was very\nuncomfortable is, they taught religion in school. So couple times I went along with\n\u2014 for \u2014 with the Catholic class, because I\u2019d \u2014 I was embarrassed to drop out. And\nthen th-the \u2014 our synagogue, the [indecipherable] in German it\u2019s called liberale\nGemeinde, a liberal exa \u2014 which is what \u2014 here \u2014 here would be called\nConservative. We were members of that, and the religion teacher, also the cantor, is\nHerr Kappel(ph) would come to the high school, to the gymnasium and with the\ntwo or three of us, would have a master key, and look for an empty classroom, and\ngive us religious classes. So that was a little uncomfortable being different from the\nrest of the \u2014 the kids.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: They were held at the same time and it was probably not that obvious, but I fel \u2014\nI wa self-conscious about it.",
        "A: And probably other kids were too.",
        "A: But \u2014 and then I \u2014 I also did some track in \u2014 in gym and \u2014 and so forth, and\nrunning, and I was pretty good at that. I really worked hard at athletics, cause I felt I\nwould be better \u2014 better off if I\u2019m strong and \u2014 and athletic than if I were a weakling\nand bookish and \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 right, exactly.",
        "A: We belonged to a \u2014 since we couldn\u2019t belong to the \u2014 to the re-regular ones,\nthere was a Jewish athletic group called Schild Wiesbaden.",
        "A: Also, the area [speaks German here]. This was a very conservative Jewish\ngroup that were proud of the fact that they, or relatives had been front line soldiers\nJune 21, 2014\nin the first World War. And they ran this shi \u2014 this sports organization, where we\ndid a lot of athletics ranging from Ping Pong to soccer to handball. I don\u2019t know the\n\u2014 you know the German handball. It\u2019s like soccer except you \u2014 you dribble the ball\nand throw it at the goal.",
        "A: And we \u2014 that was a great activity that most of us enjoyed very much. The\nGermans also had called \u2014 had something called an alliystoms(ph) medalia(ph),\nwhere you \u2014 you have to \u2014 it\u2019s like a decathlon or something. You have to do \u2014\nswim certain distance in certain time, you have ride your bike, you have to do all\nkinds of \u2014",
        "A: Measure \u2014 measureable things that have certain minimum you have to do, and if\nyou do them all, then you get a medal. And when the Jews couldn\u2019t get that, so we\nhad our own. Exactly with exactly the same metrics.",
        "A: Yes.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t matter wi \u2014 di \u2014 in fact, those people were probably the ones that are most\nlikely to die because they thought they \u2014 they don\u2019t mean us. We\u2019re the \u2014 we\u2019re the\npatriotic Germans.",
        "A: Happened to be of Jewish faith, but they were totally wrong. And of course,\npeople who were only part Jewish were also very insecure, cause they had no\nbelonging. My parents were never very religious, but when Hitler came, they\nbecame \u2014 I should say, I don\u2019t know whether to say more religious, but more\nbelonging. In other words, they went to the synagogue more and wanted to be part\nof the congregation. They felt a need for this, because of the persecution.",
        "A: Yes. A sense of community, exactly, because of the persecution there. They had\nthat basis, and I think that was very helpful, and it was people who were \u2014 didn\u2019t\nhave that who committed suicide, and who \u2014 who were very depressed, and \u2014 and\nhad real problems.",
        "A: Not that [indecipherable]\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yes, we knew some families who were mixed, and \u2014 but I don\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t\nremember any names, but my parents had friends who were one \u2014 one party was not\nJewish. And \u2014 and of course, people who were part Jewish, who had one Jewish\nparents, w-we knew some. My par \u2014 most \u2014 as I remember, my \u2014 most of my\nparents\u2019 friends were Jewish. I think they may have had some \u2014 well, they certainly\nhad some \u2014 some Gentile friends on vacation in \u2014 in ca \u2014 Saint Moritz, all his\nfriends were non-Jewish, and \u2014 most of them, most of them.",
        "A: No, just \u2014 or \u2014 in \u2014 in Switzerland?",
        "A: They were people that you just met at the hotel.",
        "A: Yeah, there was a Dutch lady that I may come back to, because she helped him\nget out of Germany \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that he met every winter. There were a family, Zimmerman, who were not\nJewish, but that\u2019s a name that can be either. There was a \u2014 there was a family from\nItaly, I believe they were Jewish, but they \u2014 they \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the name. But\nthey \u2014 they made a lot of friends there, or my dad did and my \u2014 as I said, my mother\nwent with her sisters. I don\u2019t \u2014 and I was never with her, so I don\u2019t know what kind\nof friends they made there. But my father had many friends there, you know\n[indecipherable]. And when I went with him, I went through my religious stage. I\nwas 12 years old and wanted to be a rabbi.",
        "A: And so I made a move to the Jewish kosher hotel, called the Hotel Edelweiss in\nSaint Moritz-Bad. And we had a very good time there, and that\u2019s where I really\nlearned how to ski. We took some more lessons. My dad and I skied together and I\ntook some lessons. Learned to Christie into the hill, and it became a real passion\nwith me, although I never skied again from the time we left Germany, twel \u2014 until\n\u2014 from ni-nine \u2014 from 1938 to 1955.",
        "A: So the best years of my life in hi \u2014 you know, college \u2014 high school and college,\ngraduate school, I did not ski, no-not really. So we took it up again when my oldest\nson was five years old.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: And we began again, and of course I had the liking of it and the \u2014 and no fear of\nit, so 1t \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 and then since then we\u2019ve been skiing some every winter until about three\nyears ago when I more or less gave it up.",

        "A: But I didn\u2019t have a problem. At least I can\u2019t remember any problem.",
        "A: Oh yes, right, right.",

        "A: The teachers in general were very good to us, surprisingly. I mean, I had some\nvery courageous teachers. In \u2014 in the Hebbleschule(ph) I had a mi \u2014 a \u2014 had\nCantrow, c-a-n-t-r-o-w, who was an extremely fine human being. When I went\nback to Wiesbaden as an adult American, he had passed away. But his wife knew\nme. I cannot understand that. She knew immediately who I was. So apparently he\ntook a special interest in us Jewish kids because of what was happening, or\nbeginning to happen. And then I pa \u2014 went to this gymnasium in ray \u2014 the\nJune 21, 2014\nGutenberg gymnasium. And there too, I had a history professor, or teacher\n[indecipherable] Herr Wesling(ph) who lived in our apartment house and was\nobviously very anti-Nazi, and every time he had a cold and was out for a day, I\nthought he was in a concentration camp, because he spoke up with incredible\ncourage.",

I was actually a pretty hi \u2014 well \u2014 well behaved\nchild, but I got hit with a bamboo stick on my rear end because of bad handwriting.\nIf \u2014 if my essay or whatever, composition was written in bad handwriting, it w \u2014 I\nwould get a\u2014 an \u2014 a grade \u2014 sometimes a good grade, but it was in red.

He was\nin the lighting business when he came over here, which he knew nothing about. But\nhe had such a great personality that everybody liked him and bought from him. And\nhe \u2014 he was very outgoing and very \u2014 loved people. My mother was more \u2014 also had\na very nice personality, but she was much more reserved \u2014 while he was around\nespecially, she kind of took the background, as was customary in German society.\nAnd once he passed away, she just kind of came out of her shell and became much\nmore outgoing and more enterprising, and \u2014",
        "A: That was already here in the United States.",

        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a hard question to answer. I think they had very good values, as I\nmentioned before, they don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t have a lot of formal education, but they really\nacted as though they were highly educated people. They read a lot, th \u2014 education\nwas a number one issue. And especially for my dad, vacations were very important.\nHe felt that was a very important part of life, and also he had so-some health\nproblems. Lot of lower back pain, high blood pressure and so he felt he needed a\nvacation also for health reasons, but he loved vacations; whether it was skiing or\nwhether it was in the summer, hiking, he loved go \u2014 an-and I kind of inhe \u2014\ninherited that.",

        "A: \u2014 than personal experience.",
        "A: Yes, I would \u2014 I would say that. They were \u2014 they were optimistic people and\nthat\u2019s why I wanted to come back to it, why did we leave so late?",
        "A: My parents were very, very attached to their parents and very family oriented.\nThat\u2019s another ver \u2014 very important value. And my grandfather said point blank, we\nwere born here, we\u2019re gonna die here, we\u2019re not going anywhere.",
        "A: Both of them.",
        "A: Both of them. And they were not gonna leave them. Now, as I mentioned, my\ndad was fa-farsighted enough to [indecipherable] money, to \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, to \u2014 to\nmove out money to other countries to have something when he left. But he also, in\n1936, made a orientierungsreise, an orientation trip to the United States.\nJune 21, 2014",

And you\nknow, if any of them had been bad apples, she could have been in serious trouble.\nShe was well-off, she had no children and [indecipherable] husband, and she had\ngood \u2014 good positions. And she was well-off, but she was not really wealthy, and so\nthis 1s an hero \u2014 courageous thing to do. But my dad came over here and then came\nback and we still didn\u2019t leave. That was like two years before we actually left. And\nfinally in \u2014 round that time \u2014 and I was like 12 years old, and my moth \u2014 and you \u2014\nyou \u2014 you \u2014 you get \u2014 you mature fast under these circumstance, and my mother\nJune 21, 2014\nand I sat my dad down and said look, Papa, why don\u2019t you apply for a visa, you\nhave \u2014 you have also an affidavit. You can always let it \u2014",
        "A: Expire.",

I\u2019m \u2014 if anybody says that, I don\u2019t\nbelieve it. I mean, it just simply not something that people imagined, and in ik \u2014 so-\nJune 21, 2014\ncalled civilized country. But once we\u2019re ready to go, and by that time, I \u2014 we had\nsome experiences which I haven\u2019t come around to yet.",

        "A: I mean, I didn\u2019t expect that we would come back, except to visit maybe.",
        "A: But we \u2014 so let me tell you a little bit about our \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the time when we \u2014 so we, as I mentioned, I was still in the gymnasium on\nNovember 10\", the day after Kristallnacht.",
        "A: My \u2014I wa- we were lucky, nobody came and \u2014 in-into our apartment. That\u2019s\nthe advantage of a bigger city, there\u2019s so many of us, and in \u2014 in apartment houses\nwhere the \u2014 you\u2019re not quite sure where people live and \u2014 I mean, people did get,\nsome of \u2014 but it was a little bit safer than in a smaller town.

I did \u2014 I didn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s \u2014 first of\nall, it\u2019s a berg \u2014 huge stone structure, I didn\u2019t even think it would burn.",
        "A: And I thought he was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 crazy, you know?",
        "A: So, then I discovered, when \u2014 when school was over, my mother was at the door\npicking me up. My dad\u2019s ca \u2014 had the \u2014 the car there, and my mother said, come\nwith me. I \u2014 of course, I was upset that a big boy of 14 years old we \u2014 picked up\nfrom school, and I had no idea what was going on, and \u2014\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 and so I went to the car. And it turns out my dad didn\u2019t want to go home\nbecause he had heard of friends being picked up by the Gestapo and put in\nconcentration camps that day. They picked up many, many able-bodied Jewish men.\nThey did \u2014 they left the women and children still alone at that time.",
        "A: But the men were picked up and put in concentration camps.",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely. I mean, people were arrested for all kinds of things. We had,\nfor instance, a friend who \u2014 who was arrested and put in concentration camp for\nrassenschande, which is, he was dating \u2014 he was supposed to be dating a Christian\nwoman, or maybe he was married to a Christian woman, I don\u2019t recall. You know,\nthis was a \u2014 a doctor friend, if I remember correctly, who was put in a concentration\ncamp because he was seen with a Christian woman. Now, they finally let him go,\nbut he was pretty emaciated, and ill when he got out. Now absolutely, there were\npeople arrested for all kinds of reasons, or \u2014 or drummed up reasons. And some\nwere let go, and some were not so fortunate. So the question of ca \u2014 disappearing to\nc \u2014 to concentration camps, that was already going around for quite a while.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: Fortunately in our town, we didn\u2019t see too many people just kind of beaten up or\n\u2014 or shot in the street. That went on in some cities.",
        "A: Although on KristallInacht I understand that happened, although I didn\u2019t see it.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s it, I mean I\u2014 my mother picked me up in school \u2014 I mean, not\nduring the night, I \u2014 during the next day, the 10\" of November.",
        "A: That night we were in our apartment, nobody bothered us. We were lucky, we\nwere not one of the ones that were \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 attacked in the pogrom.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know anything that was going on until I was picked up from\nschool by my \u2014 by my parents.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And then we drove around Wiesbaden because my dad was afraid to go home,\nhe thought he would be picked up.",
        "A: Finally, my mother and I said this \u2014 you can\u2019t keep doing this, because th-they\nprobably know your license plate, the Gestapo. So we hit upon the idea, and \u2014",
        "A: My brother? That\u2019s a good question. I think \u2014 he went to a Jewish school \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and he may have been in school that day. I don\u2019t remember. Him \u2014 he \u2014 you\ncan ask him.",

And we felt that the Germans were still legalistic enough to maybe\nleave a British citizen \u2014",

        "A: He is Jewish.",

        "A: But he hid out at his house, and he had dogs, and the dog could give him away\ntoo, that \u2014 another problem. But he hid out in his house for about four or five days.\nAt that point, he did not fail \u2014 feel very comfortable there. I mean, he was worried\nthat somebody would come.

The wife of the com \u2014 police commissioner of\nAmsterdam, who was his friend from Saint Moritz, who came to Wiesbaden,\nstayed with us a couple of days, and then took him to the train station, chattering\nloudly in Dutch. And she got on the train, kissed him goodbye and then he jumped\nJune 21, 2014\non, and she jumped off, because they were arresting Jews at the train station that\ntime.",
        "A: And he managed to get across the border to \u2014 to Amsterdam and to \u2014 to\nHolland. And a day after he got there, the Gestapo came to the house, two as \u2014 two\nor three people, searched the house from top to bottom.",
        "A: And my \u2014 we were home. My mother actually locked my brother and me into the\nbedroom because there were \u2014 she was worried were close enough to puberty to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 count as men. And my mother at that time had incredible courage. I mean, she\nreally talked \u2014 one guy came at 11 o\u2019clock at night, and she\u2019s, what kind of business\nis it, come to woman who\u2019s alone at 11 o\u2019clock at night.",
        "A: And \u2014 and had the guy apologizing. But basically they \u2014 they searched the\nhouse, and finally she said, why don\u2019t you call the telephone [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 telephone office, and you'll fi \u2014 you\u2019 ll see that he ki\u2014 he called me, and he is\nin Amsterdam. And finally they did that. And they stole the car. They stole the\nJune 21, 2014\ntypewriters out of the office, too-took whatever wasn\u2019t attached. Told my mother,\nyou have a month to pack up what you want to take, and get you and your children\nout of here. And since we had the americ \u2014 they \u2014 since we had the American visa,\nthey\u2019re willing to just let us go. And at that time, the-these things are so gradual, so",
        "A: Right, a-at that \u2014 at that time they left women and children alone.",
        "A: That didn\u2019t last long. So basically we \u2014 that was on the 12\" or the 13\" of\nNovember, and we left about the 10\" of December for \u2014 for Holland, reunited with\nour dad. And took the boat S-Statendam, in the Holland America line \u2014",

I believe that was before \u2014 or after, I\u2019m not\nsure. But anyway, the \u2014 he mentioned to me that he had a so \u2014 given them a list of\nbooks to read.

I think he was the \u2014 the Gentile boy,\nwho lived in the same apartment building with a family that had a Jewish boy his\nage, and they became very, very close friends. I read that book in one night, it was\nan incredible book. And it gave the \u2014 the Jewish situation in Germany from the\npoint of view of this Christian boy with \u2014 who had this close Jewish friend. And the\none scene I remember so vividly, is the Christian dad talking with the Jewish dad\nand saying, why don\u2019t you get out of here?

        "A: \u2014 frame of mind for \u2014 for Jewish people. Whether they believed it or not, they\ncertainly rationalized that \u2014 that they would \u2014 nobody would harm them physically,\nbecause it was a civilized country. And to some extent my parents, I\u2019m sure used\nJune 21, 2014\nthat argument as well. But it was really strike \u2014 and we discussed that book when I\nspoke to the class, and of course they asked me questions about my experiences.",
        "A: One thing stayed with me is that I really couldn\u2019t answer very well, and when a \u2014\na boy said, we\u2019re paying restitution to our former Jewish citizens, who were clearly\nbadly hurt. But why should we, the third generation, who had nothing to do with\nthis, why should we \u2014 should we pay this? And I didn\u2019t have a good answer. I don\u2019t\nremember what I said. You can argue this both ways, you could say look, your gra \u2014\nyour grandparents did this, and so our \u2014 some of your grandparents, and so you\u2019re\nstill paying for what they did, just as \u2014 as in this country some people are\nadvocating restitution for the slaves. And we\u2019re certainly not responsible for\nslavery. And some argue that they\u2019re really not guilty. They \u2014 they weren\u2019t born.\nSomething that\u2019s very difficult to \u2014",

        "A: And I understand perfectly. And especially when if you were in a concentration\ncamp, or you were close to being gassed, or you have relatives that were murdered,\nI could totally understand. But having not had these horrible experiences, I would \u2014\ndidn\u2019t feel quite that strongly, but it took me a very long time to want to go back.",
        "A: It did. When we finally were invited back, I think that was the first time we went\nto Germany. No, we were there once before. I was on a sabbatical in Paris, and I\ntook my family to Wiesbaden to see where I grew up.",
        "A: We were very uncomfortable, because we didn\u2019t know anybody, and the kids\neven were uncomfortable, and so we stayed about a day or two days and drove to\nBasel and went to Switzerland. Well, when I was invited back, it was already the\nthird generation. The second generation was terrible. In other words, the people\nwho were the children of the people who did some of these things, were t \u2014 didn\u2019t\nwant to talk about it. They were embarrassed, they were ashamed, and they\nwouldn\u2019t bring it up in school. The Holocaust simply wasn\u2019t discussed. And we, of\ncourse, resented that.\nJune 21, 2014",
        "A: But the third generation was totally different. They wanted to know the answers,\nthey wanted to ask questions, they wanted to know what happened. How \u2014 how\nwere their families involved and not involved. So that was something that made me\nfeel that it\u2019s time to forgive these chil \u2014 these children who \u2014 who had really\nbasically nothing to do with it. They might be in \u2014 I might have parents who anti-\nSemitic \u2014 who brainwashed them, that I can\u2019t \u2014 but I can\u2019t exclude that in any\ncountry.",
        "A: But I felt that this generation deserved at least a little bit more of an \u2014 of a\nrapprochement than the previous generations. And that\u2019s why I was willing to go\nthere, and went back for scientific purposes. In other words, for visiting fellow\nscientists in Germany, for going to ger \u2014 meetings in Germany. In fact, my first\nvisit to Berlin was for a scientific meeting, maybe 10 years ago or something, first\ntime [indecipherable]",

Now this 1s\nvery interesting. I didn\u2019t take any biology courses, but I audited biochemistry. And I\ncame to the realization that while I enjoyed organic chemistry to a degree, I didn\u2019t\nenjoy reading the literature. I mean, I would look at the Journal Organic Chemistry\nand it would say, a new synthesis in the anthraquinone series. And I said, who\ncares?

In other words, how the body metabolizes food to create energy, to create\ngrowth. And that was so exciting, and I made up my mind right then and then, as I\nwas a graduate student, that I wanted to get into biochemistry. And when I finished\nmy PhD thesis, which was a strictly organic chemistry thesis, with a prof \u2014 very\n108June 21, 2014\nfamous professor called Professor Morris Kharasch, who almost got the Nobel\nPrize because he \u2014 he developed a new \u2014 brand new field in organic chemistry, the\nfield of \u2014 of free radicals in solution. When I received my \u2014 finally received my\ndegree, and I was in graduate school almost five years, that was because he was\nvery demanding, and the \u2014 there wasn\u2019t this \u2014 a closed project, 1t wasn\u2019t finish \u2014\nfinished, he would \u2014 he would say now finish this, okay, Pll give you another\nproject. But I mean, eventually got out and di-did fine. I actually applied for a\nfellowship. At that time the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Polio\nFoundation, gave a fellowship specifically for people who were in the hard sciences\nlike physics and chemistry and wanted to get into biology. And so I took a\u2014I-\u2014I-I\nge \u2014I got this, and it was \u2014 I was one of the winners, and I took a postdoctoral\nfellowship for two years at Columbia, and at that time Irene and I \u2014 and I haven\u2019t\nsaid anything about my family life, but I will \u2014",

And after I was there a fairly short period,\nmaybe a year, I\u2014 my \u2014 my boss, Dr. Thomas came to me and said, the city of New\nYork is setting up a \u2014 something called the Research Council of New York.

        "A: \u2014 [indecipherable] in Cleveland, my parents doing well enough set up a new\nexistence, a new decent income in the United States, being able to send my brother\nand me to college. My brother became a \u2014 a \u2014 a meta \u2014 metallurgy [indecipherable]\nand start his own smelting business and did very nicely, melt \u2014 smelting old\nautomobile \u2014 well, you\u2019ll hear from him \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 personally, but he \u2014 smelting old \u2014 melting old grills from cars and various\nthings that have a lot of zinc in them, and then producing virgin zinc for \u2014 as \u2014 as\ngood as anything you get from actual zinc ore. And he did very nicely, and he\u2019s\nbeen long retired, and we try to get together as often as possible, though. He\u2019s in\nPhiladelphia, it\u2019s not that far, but somehow [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, exactly.\n122June 21, 2014",
        "A: Let\u2019s have a short pause and then let me think.",
        "A: Do you have any ideas?\n123June 21, 2014",
        "A: No. I mean, I consider myself as a very positive, cultural Jew, a-and ethnic Jew.\nI\u2019m very proud of anything that the Jewish community does that I like, whether it\u2019s\nsports or science or medicine or anything. And I \u2014 I \u2014 I like to belong to a Jewish\ncongregation because it gives me a feeling of belonging. As for a belief in God, I\u2019m\nafraid that\u2019s gone. I wish I did. It would make life much easier, would make dying\nmuch easier.",
        "A: But I can\u2019t believe in it personally. I mean, I \u2014 I can believe in a\u2014 in a\u2014 some\nkind of super power. I cannot believe in a personal God that would answer que \u2014\nprayers or punish you or reward you. Simply, the evidence is not there. So \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said this, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 this is how I feel. So then that \u2014 that idea. And then of course, I got excited\nabout science, so that kind of went by the wayside.",
        "A: Well, yes, I \u2014 they\u2019ve been, of course, received very well. I mean, we \u2014\npublishing 250 - 300 papers doesn\u2019t go unnoticed.\n124June 21, 2014",
        "A: And many of them were ve \u2014 were very good, and very useful. And they led to\nsome rewards. I not \u2014 I\u2019m only going to give you two or three that are \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 remarkable. One is that \u2014 and one of my favorites was that I got an honorary\ndoctorate from the University of Paris and the Sorbonne.",
        "A: Not only was that a very nice honor, but it was also a very nice occasion. And\nma \u2014 my wife, my son \u2014 oldest son, and my mother, and my brother and my sister-\nin-law were all at \u2014 in Paris for the occasion, and we had a wonderful time. And as\nsoon as we\u2019re finished with the wonderful time in Paris, and an extremely moving\nceremony with a chamber music group playing music, and with a \u2014 walking in with\nthe \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the academic garments and with my \u2014 my godfather, mon parrain making a\nspeech as to why I deserve it, there were six others, all in different fields:\nphilosopher, mathematician, biologist and s \u2014 and so forth. And I have lovely\npictures of them. As soon as we got f-finished with all this and sent all the relatives\nhome, except my brother and \u2014 I think my brother and sister-in-law, of course my\n125June 21, 2014\nson \u2014 my \u2014 well, we sent my mother home. We went to s Zermatt, Switzerland,\nour fave \u2014 our favorite ski place.",
        "A: \u2014 and we skied.",
        "A: Well, we did that from the early seven \u2014 70s to about 2010. Almost \u2014 almost\nevery winter.",
        "A: And the \u2014 then I got a very nice prize from the New York Academy of Science,\nand I don\u2019t recall the \u2014 it was the name of two brothers and it was distinguished in\nthe way that it was given by New York Academy of Sciences, and the fact that, I\nthink foreign people before me had won the Nobel prize. So it was given to some\npretty good people.",
        "A: And I got an award from the nation\u2019s drug abuse as one of their outstanding\nresearchers, called the \u2014 oh, I\u2019m blocking out the name.",
        "A: People who \u2014 who make discoveries, I \u2014 and I got a number of other awards and\nname lectures, in other words, lectures in high memory of people who had died, in\n126June 21, 2014\nhonor of people who were being honored. So 1-1t\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s been a very, very, very\ngratifying to ha \u2014 be recognized by one\u2019s peers. My \u2014 my medical school has also\nbeen very generous. In 2005 they did an all-day symposium in my honor. Oh, by the\nway, in 1997, I believe, a journal called Neurochemical Research did a \u2014 a whole\nvolume in my honor, with my picture with an article by a colleague, Dr. Huda(ph)\nAkeel(ph), a Syrian born, lovely lady with the University of Michigan, who wrote\nan article about why I deserved the honor. And in the \u2014 the s-symposium at my\nuniversity was \u2014 all day symposium with very outstanding people lecturing and\nsaying nice things about me. And then about two or thr \u2014 three or four years ago,\nthe medical school set up a annual lecture, called the Eric Simon lecture. And so\nfar, thank goodness, it\u2019s not in memorial, it\u2019s in my honor. But hopefully it\u2019Il be\ncontinued.",
        "A: Final thoughts?",
        "A: No, I just think that compared to so many of my friends and so many of my\nfellow Jews, I\u2019ve been extremely lucky and some of what I\u2019ve told you may be\nalmost \u2014 not seem very \u2014 very, very important compared to what all these people\n127June 21, 2014\nwent through. I guess these are my own [indecipherable] for not having been\nmurdered or having been hurt in a serious way, as have the others coming out. But I\nthink these experiences are still important to remember how life was in Germany,\nand here, for that matter, during the \u2014 during that \u2014 that period.",
        "A: No, I \u2014 that\u2019s for sure.",
