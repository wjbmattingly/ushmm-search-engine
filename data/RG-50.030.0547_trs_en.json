We had a nice\n\u2014I was dressed very nicely, everything was fine. So when I saw the pictures, and\nthey were still alive, and I just looked at the picture, oh how nice. But I never asked\nany questions. I was \u2014 I was a child, I just did what had to be done and I listened.\nAnd when the time came that I had to go into hiding, I don\u2019t know if I asked why,\nbut they always \u2014 I think they just gave a story, well, you\u2019re gonna stay with \u2014\nshould I say the name? Yeah, not yet.",

        "Q: So, what you learn about the \u2014 the background to going into hiding 1s everything\nfrom what is to \u2014 had been told to you later, okay, is that correct, yeah?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s correct, that\u2019s correct.",

        "Q: Do you remember that date? I mean, di \u2014 not the date, do you remember being\ntold this, at the time?",
        "A: I\u2014 yes, tha-that\u2019s when they took me to these people that they knew prior and\narranged, made this arrangement that I would go be living with them. They had no\nchildren of their own, and \u2014 and they, like I said, would be coming back to take me\nhome.",
        "Q: And you remembered being brought there, and \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, and I remember crying after them leaving, and they were crying and \u2014\nand I ran after them. And the people that I stayed with, which I wound up calling\nTante and Omaya(ph) are holding onto me and not letting me run too far, but yes, I\nremember that like yesterday.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Those are the memories I \u2014I really have so strongly.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s not surprising, in a \u2014 1n a way, because for a child it\u2019s so traumatic,\nwhen you already know who your mother and your father is \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then \u2014 and that \u2014 you\u2019ve never known what it\u2019s like to not have them.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. No, we always seemed to have \u2014 I must have had a very good\nlife because there\u2019s nothing traumatic for me to \u2014 to remember. And it\u2019s like\nchildren \u2014 like my own children, they don\u2019t remember that time either.",

        "Q: \u2014 what kind of impressions you had. And then filling in some of the facts of what\nyou learned later.",
        "A: Okay, okay. The people that I was staying with was \u2014 I called her was Tanta\nRowter(ph), that was her last name, a real Dutch name because sh \u2014 actually, she\nwas German, but she had lived there for a long time and married this Dutch man\ncalled Yap(ph) Rowter(ph). And they were \u2014 had no children.",
        "Q: Were they older people?",
        "A: To \u20141n my eyes, they were older, and they probably were in their maybe late\n30s, early 40s. They were old people, because my parents were so much younger.\nCause my father \u2014 my mother was born in 1912, 1912, and my mother was born in\n1911. So in 1942 \u2014 well, maybe they were more or less the same age. But \u2014 so I st \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008\nI \u2014I lived with them, I was to be their niece, and I had to live their way, their last\nname, their religion, which was \u2014 they didn\u2019t really have much of religion, but there\nwas Protestant. And I was going to be raised Catholic.",
        "Q: They were Protestant and you were going to be raised Catholic?",
        "A: Because they had a \u2014 a\u2014 a maid, a young girl, 18 or 19, she came every day.\nAnd she\u2019s the one who taught me the Catholic-ism type of thing. And because that\nway I could go to the church and with \u2014 and go to school with the nuns. So \u2014",
        "Q: And what wi \u2014 did you have another name?",
        "A: Rowter(ph), Paula Rowter(ph).",
        "Q: Pa\u2014 so you si \u2014 made \u2014",

        "Q: Age five, okay.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And I did the catechis \u2014 I \u2014 you know, I do remember this church\nand the nuns and the water that\u2019s on the side, and \u2014 and I ha \u2014 I was so excited, this\nmaid who was there, she gave me a rosary. Oh, and that was such a personal thing\nthat was mine, you know. I don\u2019t know if I knew that I had been, or was Jewish. I\ndon\u2019t know because I never dealt with that until afterwards.",
        "Q: Well, what was the maid\u2019s name? What was she like? You don\u2019t remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember her name. It was a real Dutch name. And she was very nice,\nshe helped me a lot and \u2014 and \u2014 and when I was living there with the tante, I was\nnormal. I had a normal life. I guess I forgot about my parents, you know.",
        "Q: Well, I wanted to ask you that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you have any nightmares, did you cry for Momma, or \u2014 or \u2014 or Father?",
        "A: I don\u2019t seem to remember that. But if I really think deeply and go back a lot, that\nI mu \u2014 I think I must have done that in the first few days, because my tante gave me\na doll with a little carriage to, you know, keep me happy and to just divert my\nattention. And I think, you know, when I really go deep now that I\u2019m talking to you\nabout that, about my own past feelings and all that, I can see the carriage and I can\nsee the doll. And also I can see her kitchen.",
        "Q: What did it look like?\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Was a big kitchen, a real bare room with a big, black stove. And she would be\ncooking with the maid, who would be helping. I was also with the maid now,\nhelping her clean rooms. See, the people, they ran a boarding house, so they \u2014 it was\na big house, and they had lots of rooms and the maid would work in the rooms, or\nclean the bed and the bathroom, and I would be helping her, becau \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s a na \u2014 I-I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but it\u2019s a bit unusual. I mean, the first thing\nthat strikes me is, oh my goodness, hiding a child in plain sight, because if you have\na boarding house, you have a lot of people coming through.",
        "A: Yeah, but I was dur \u2014 her niece from \u2014 wherever that niece came from, where\nmy tante was German, but I didn\u2019t speak German, I spoke Dutch. So, the niece was\neither from the husband\u2019s side, my Oma, cause he was perfectly Dutch, he was all\nDutch. And I don\u2019t know whose niece I was, but she always said I\u2019m her niece. And\nlike I said, I did go to school for a little bit, and I had a first communion, whatever\nthat age was, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Seven \u2014 well, usually it\u2019s age seven, but it could be earlier.",
        "A: It had to be earlier, cause I was not allowed \u2014 the first few months I was out,\nthey had children next door, the neighbor had children, a little boy and a girl, and I\nwould play with them. And they had a, like a \u2014 they built a\u2014 where you go hide\nwhen the bombs come.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: A shelter.",
        "A: A shelter, a shelter. And I would play with these children a few times, and then\nthey start to ask questions of me. I was not blonde and blue-eyed, you know, I was\ndark haired. And they would say, are you Jewish? And I would ask my tante, what\ndoes that mean, am I Jewish? She says, now you can never go outside any longer,\nbecause the parents of those children \u2014",
        "Q: Were curious.",
        "A: \u2014 were \u2014 by talking. They also had that big shelter, which they dug down and\nthat\u2019s all sand, you know, like a \u2014 like a little [indecipherable] like a little\nmountain. And Tante had asked the parents if we could go in there if it needed, for\nthe bombs, and they said no. They said no. So they were very anti.",
        "Q: So, did you \u2014 when you \u2014 when you asked Tante, what does this mean, and I\nJewish \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and she said, you can\u2019t go out there any more, did she also answer that you\nwere Jewish, or did she tell you anything?",
        "A: No, no, no, she never told me that I was Jewish. She says, you just cannot play\nwith, those are not nice children, you cannot play with them. Okay, I\u2019m a nice little\ngirl and I listen. And she said, you cannot go outside any more, and I didn't ask. I\nNovember 10, 2008\nwas content in the house. And between her, she was very sweet to me, and my\nuncle, who was very nice, he \u2014 they had no children, they enjoyed \u2014 I would \u2014 I was\nallowed to go in the garden with my oma, cause he was growing vegetables. I\nremember that, and I was going with the maid to help clean the house, and I played\nwith my doll. That\u2019s what I called, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, hang on a second, so you stayed home and you\u2019d play with your dolls?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Or go out \u2014 was their garden visible to the other family, or was it walled?",
        "A: Yes, because there\u2019s no walls. In Europe there\u2019s no walls, at least in Holland at\nthat time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, they had a \u2014 a dirt area somewhere, I don\u2019t know, because the back of their\nhouse had like a water, a little \u2014 not a river, but something that flowed, with\nbeautiful Weeping Willows.",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",
        "A: I'll never forget the Weeping Willows, it was just so pretty. Her front yard had\nlike a little fence full of roses. And the house was a very nice house, I \u2014 I \u2014 when I\nwent back in 1985, I found it and I \u2014 but anyway, that\u2019s another story.",
        "Q: We'll get there.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: We'll get there. And you don\u2019t remember feeling that somebody \u2014 something\nwas taken from you that you couldn\u2019t play with the children any more, you just\naccepted it and \u2014 and went on?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you continue going to school, to the Catholic school?",
        "A: No, at that time I couldn\u2019t do anything any more.",
        "Q: Because of this?",
        "A: Because of this. I \u2014",
        "Q: So they kept you in the house. However, during the few months that you had\nbeen there they had gotten you \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 they had gotten you to take first communion? That\u2019s a huge thing.",
        "A: That\u2019s a huge thing 1s right, but I could not go outside any more after those\nchildren. Maybe it was a little longer period than what I\u2019m remembering, because I\nremember going to the nuns, and I think the nun knew who I was. But they were\nvery nice, very sweet, but I remember doing that, and then I remember I couldn\u2019t do\nanything any more, I had to stay inside. And it got heavier, I think, when the\nGermans got more prominent there.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: And did they become more prominent there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did this take \u2014 how did this unfold?",
        "A: My \u2014 because of my tante and omaya(ph) having this big house \u2014 excuse me \u2014\nthe \u2014 they had to take in an SS officer. He had to live in because they had the room.\nAnd that\u2019s how heavy it got when he is there and I\u2019m there.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 were \u2014 do you have memories of him?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did he look like?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have a face.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Just a uniform. Ugly black, horrible black, black uniform with big, black boots.\nThose uniform and the boots are with me 24/7 if I allow it to come out.",
        "Q: Scary.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know his face. Very scary, cause I\u2019m in the house there with people and\nso on, and now we have this guy there. I sit on his lap, he puts me on his lap, I talk\nto him like a soldier.",
        "Q: So you remember doing that?",
        "A: Oh yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: And do you remember being scared while you were on the lap?",
        "A: On and off. I kind of got to know him, you know, he was there fo \u2014 seemed to\nme for a long time. Til the end. He was there until the end.",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t remember his face?",
        "A: No, I have no vision of his face. I-I either didn\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t want to remember it \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, because to me the \u2014 the uniform 1s all I know, is the uniform.",
        "Q: And did you \u2014 did your \u2014 did he seem \u2014 why was he scary to you? I mean \u2014",
        "A: Because I have never seen a person with a uniform like that. I mean, that\u2019s a\nhorrible thing, I \u2014 I am young, and I was \u2014 lived in a nice area at home, there was no\nuniforms. Tante didn\u2019t have any uniforms. The people that lived there were no\nuniforms. And then comes this guy with the \u2014 the boots, you know, and it click-\nclacked the way it \u2014 that was \u2014",
        "Q: And nobody told you that this 1s someone to take \u2014 this is someone to be careful\naround?",
        "A: No, they wanted me to be just casual, because I\u2019m \u2014 you know, and I was taught,\nand being me, I was told never say what your real last name 1s, and just I\u2019m your\ntante and I\u2019m your oma, you\u2019re just living here with \u2014 with me. And that \u2014 that was\nit. He did have other ones, other soldiers came to the house. When that happened,\nNovember 10, 2008\nwhen other SS officers came to the house, I had to go to the basement. I wasn\u2019t\nallowed to be around, because \u2014",
        "Q: It could be for many reasons, I mean, 1-if a child \u2014",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: \u2014 1s told that it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re in mortal danger, it means we\nhave too many people in the house, children have to go upstairs. Was that kind of\nthe \u2014 or downstairs \u2014",
        "A: Some \u2014 yeah, downstairs. Just something, you know, there\u2019s too much, and that\nthey\u2019re talking and all that, and you\u2019ll just be in their way. So I had to go in the\nbasement, and I took my dolly and my \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 I forgot the name of it now \u2014\nthe rosacal \u2014 what do you call \u2014",
        "Q: The rosary.",
        "A: Rosary, yes, that was always with me. The rosary was my savior. I was taught\nthat that\u2019s my savior. Whenever there\u2019s something bad, I need to pray with this\nrosary.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you learn prayers?",
        "A: I learned prayers, I don\u2019t remember them, cause right the war was over, I did\naway with all that, and I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: But you learned them at the time.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: But I remember having them in my hand, and knowing how to inter \u2014 interlink\nthem in my fingers, and making the cross, and had my little dolly. And that was it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And how long did you live at the fa \u2014 with the family?",
        "A: Two and a half years.",
        "Q: Did you ever see your real parents during that time?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: That\u2019s amazing, that \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: \u2014I didn\u2019t see them, I didn't \u2014 I might have asked my tante a few times, and after\nthat I became so much like a child, well, now you\u2019re living with somebody else.\nThis is your life now. This is how you have to survive, and this 1s \u2014 this 1s it.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself?",
        "A: As very timid at that time. Not today, but at that time. And always listening to\nwhat I was told.",
        "Q: A good girl.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: A very good girl, yes, and I s \u2014 good girl. Had the big bow in my hair, you know,\nall that.",
        "Q: And did photo \u2014",
        "A: And whatever they did for me \u2014 told me to do, I would do, go with him \u2014 Tante,\ngo with Omaya(ph) now and this and that. Or go with \u2014 now I wish I remember the\nname of that cleaning lady \u2014 that mai-maid, or whatever they called her. Yeah, I\nwas. I\u2019m getting emotional. I have \u2014 I have not been emotional about this, because\nI\u2019m emotional about something else.",
        "Q: What about this brings it up?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, about the way I was when I was a little girl, that\u2019s all I remember.\nAnd maybe cause I miss \u2014 miss the people I lived with. They were \u2014 they were nice.\nAnd you know, when you talk about every little detail, brings back memories, and\nmy state of my \u2014 my being at the moment is very touchy because I lost my husband\nseven months ago, and \u2014",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: \u2014I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m more emotional than I usually am.",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019re also talking about losses. And so, we\u2019re starting from the beginning\nwhere there are attachments, and then there are losses.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: You know, and that\u2019s the \u2014 when you\u2019re a child \u2014 I remember growing up \u2014 you\nknow, one of our roles is to talk as little as possible, but you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 it\ncreates a frustration.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because when you have somebody telling you things, you want to say oh yes,\nand this reminds me of this. Well, let me share with you what this reminds me of. I\nremember growing up and hearing how much parents love children, you know. I\ngrew up in \u2014 ina family where I was loved, and hearing about parents love children.\nAnd when I had my own child, this revelation happened, that when I would walk in\nthe room, her face lit up. When I\u2019d come home from work, she would jump up and\ndown in her crib. And I realized, it\u2019s a two way street.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That ch \u2014 that love that that child is giving me 1s real, and I feel it and it\nenergizes me, and it is amazing and it is pure. And there\u2019s no farce to it whatsoever,\nit is genuine.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And so when I hear you speak about the people that you were living with, I\nimagine a little girl who\u2019s a good child, who does as she\u2019s told, who has this\ninherent trust that she is being protected by good forces.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Exactly. And now, that\u2019s exactly the feeling that it is and that\u2019s bringing tears to\nmy eyes because I can\u2019t imagine that \u2014 that all that happened. But you know, I\nremember so much of that period, and so much of afterwards, too. But I think it\u2019s a\nlittle bit because of my \u2014",
        "Q: Also you\u2019re going through another loss.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Huge loss.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. My sympathy to you.",
        "A: Oh, thank you.",
        "Q: Yeah. Are there any other memories that you can come to mi \u2014 that come to\nmind whe \u2014 through that time that you were with this \u2014 with Tante Rowter(ph),\nand Oma Riap(ph)? Any other people in the boarding house besides the \u2014 the black\nsuited SS man?",
        "A: Yeah, there was a \u2014 there was a man there and there was a woman there. I don\u2019t\nknow their names, but I remember, vaguely, their faces. See, I remember their\nfaces, I remember this girl, the maid, her face, but not this SS officer\u2019s face. So \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: That\u2019s really uncanny, yeah.",
        "A: So maybe inside of me I knew it was danger, because this man with boots and a\nuniform, that would represent to any child \u2014",
        "Q: Scary.",
        "A: Scary, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: But \u2014 and for you in particular, really scary.",
        "A: Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re ready for the end of it, because of\nsomething that \u2014 that he did at the end, how \u2014",
        "Q: Well, tell u \u2014 tell us.",
        "A: \u2014 when the war ended. Well, during the war, I \u2014 I\u2014 with the bombing, two doors\ndown, there was another shelter there, and those people let us in because we did\nhave the bombing scares, and we were in the shelter, and all of us, the people th \u2014",
        "Q: Were these allied bombers?",
        "A: No \u2014 ye\u2014 yes. Well no, I don\u2019t know. No, I think there\u2019s \u2014 German? I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That part I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 all I know is bombs.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And we all went in there and I remember in that shelter, I prayed like anything,\nbecause the girl was with me and I went \u2014 boy, I went to town and prayed and\nprayed and prayed that we wouldn't get hurt.",
        "Q: With the prayers from the rosary?",
        "A: Yeah, with the rosary and the whole thing. Yes, I remember that. I remember the\nshelter cause they had like shelves of beds, you know, in there in case we had to\nStay.",
        "Q: A big shelter, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, a big shelter. And when it was over, the raid was over, the house next door\nto Tante, that got bombed, but we did not, our house was saved. So, I \u2014 all that\npraying I did helped our house.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure of it.",
        "A: Yeah. So, when they ended the war, the two and a half years have gone \u2014 well,\nno \u2014 yeah, it must have been at that time, he \u2014 he had to leave, of course. And when\nhe left, we stood at the front door, and that\u2019s another vision I have, just right now.\nMy tante is here, I\u2019m over here, he is outside facing me, and he\u2019s looking right at\nme. And his finger comes up, and he says, Paula, now you can go free. Now, he\u2019s\nspeaking German, and my tante knows German. And I\u2019m standing there and he\nNovember 10, 2008\nsays, you can go free. After he leaves, tante looks at me, because now I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m\nseven, and she says, he knew. He knew. Now I know that I\u2019m Jewish because I\u2019m\nseve \u2014 I\u2019m older, maybe they told me, or \u2014 and then she says, he knew that you\nwere here hiding, or something, another word that she said. And that\u2019s what he said,\nsO \u2014",
        "Q: And you remember him saying this?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, I remember him standing there, I don\u2019t see a face, I see\nthat uniform and that finger coming right at me, pointing. He says, Paula, you can\ngo free. So this guy either had a heart, either he has his own child, cause I did sit on\nhis lap, and he didn't turn me or them or anybody in this whole household in.",
        "Q: Who knows, maybe he was the protector of them.",
        "A: And then I thought maybe all my praying worked.",
        "Q: There would be people who will say, absolutely.",
        "A: Yeah. I [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Because such things are mir \u2014 such things are miracles.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: You know. And when you \u2014 when y \u2014 when you heard that, did you have a\ncertain feeling? Did you freeze, did you kind of go numb? Do you remember, like,\nwhat feeling unmasks \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Well, I remember I couldn\u2019t understand, I didn\u2019t quite comprehend what all that\nmeant. So, I\u2019m sure I talked to Tante about that and I think what she said is now,\npretty soon, Mommy and Daddy are gonna come \u2014",
        "Q: To get you.",
        "A: \u2014 to get you, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So, she must have known they\u2019re still alive.",
        "A: She must have, because she knew that they were coming at a certain day. So,\neither they were able to, through their hiding place \u2014 places, they had several hiding\nplaces \u2014 my father had a fight with a German soldier on top \u2014 on the roof.",
        "Q: Oh my. We can get to that story.",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah, okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But they must have known how to get in touch with each other, one way or the\nother, to say this and this date, you know, they\u2019re gonna come and get you. But I\nremember in the house, when it became close to the liberation time, we went \u2014 it\nwas e \u2014 nighttime I\u2019m not \u2014 evening time, it was very dark out, and we went up on\nthe \u2014 they had little windows up in the attic, and I guess they heard on the news or\nsomething that the liberators were coming. And they were going to come by\nparachute out of the plane in Sun, s-u-n, that\u2019s a name of a little town near\nNovember 10, 2008\nEindhoven. So we all went up there, I remember that, looking out the window and\nthere\u2019s all these white parachutes, one after another, after another, after another, and\nwe were so happy to see that, cause they were going to liberate us, and \u2014 and if you\nwatch the movie, the \u2014 \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 with the Battle of the Bulge and all that, and they talk about Eindhoven and\nthey talk about the parachutes coming down. So when I see that movie and \u2014 and\nwait for that particular scene, it just all comes right back and there\u2019s just such a\ngreat feeling.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "A: America, och, America, then the soldiers walking down the street and the\nEnglish ones, the Americans and they give you the chocolate and \u2014 and they\u2019re\nwearing nice uniforms, not this ugly, terrible black uniform and oh \u2014 that \u2014\nwhenever I would see soldiers, you know, walking around and all that, I just felt oh,\nthey\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re my savior. They\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re wonderful, wonderful\npeople, you know, you can trust them. You couldn\u2019t trust the ugly ones.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. So \u2014",
        "Q: So when did your parents come?\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Well, they came, it was 1945.",
        "Q: Do you remember the \u2014",
        "A: They did not come when Holland was liberated in \u201944. We weren\u2019t always \u2014 I\nthink, not sure that we were free s \u2014 until the war actually was over. And when\nTante says, now we\u2019re gonna go outside and wait for them on the street. And the\ntime came, there they were. A lot of people walking around now and all that, and\nthey came down the street, and I ran to them, I knew them. And they ran to me and\nthat was \u2014",
        "Q: Oh God.",
        "A: \u2014 just a \u2014 yeah, they made it and I made it and that was a great feeling, very\nhealthy.",
        "Q: Did you feel \u2014 when you saw them again, yes, I know you?",
        "A: Mm-hm, oh yeah, absolutely. And they had said they will come back, and they\ndid. And that was \u2014 I must say, they stayed a few days at Tante\u2019s house until they\ncould find a place for us to move into. But that was the last time that I was their\nlittle girl. The feeling of parents and children. Because either what they went\nthrough \u2014 never talked about what they went through, except that only \u2014 later on\nthey talked about it in \u2014 in \u2014 when we were here in America, my father would say a\nfew things, and told me what happened to him. But at that time they had to find the\nNovember 10, 2008\nplace, they had to go back and make a living, and there was no closeness. The\ncloseness was gone. I hav \u2014 was so close with Tanta and Omaya(ph), I didn\u2019t have\nthat closeness with them, either because the two and a half years of separation, and I\nam now a little more grown and loved the way I ha \u2014 was being treated for those\ntwo and a half years. Now I\u2019m with my parents, who have nothing, and they can\u2019t\ngive all that feeling any more. And from then on in, life got hard, life was tough,\nversus the two and a half years that I had to endure the basement and all that. But \u2014",
        "Q: In what ways was it tough? How was it tough?",
        "A: It was tough because they were so much in their own, with their own problems\nthat they had, and not knowing how to really deal with me, to \u2014 in other words, to\npick up from the day that they, you know, left me, until the day I\u2014 I\u2014 we \u2014 we were\ntogether. The \u2014 the feelings just was okay, we have to eat now, we have to do this\nnow and you have to go to school now and \u2014 but nothing \u2014 I don\u2019t remember any,\nyou know \u2014",
        "Q: Warmth.",
        "A: \u2014 all of that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. And then my mother got pregnant, so now I have a little brother.",
        "Q: Before we do that \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: When you moved away from ta \u2014 did you \u2014 did you move \u2014 then they stayed\nwith Tante and Omaya(ph) for a few days, and then you moved away with them.\nDid you go \u2014 did you move far?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a \u2014 yes, from \u2014 well, in Eindhoven, you know, nothing 1s far like it is\nhere, but still, yeah it was a different area, trying to find where they could somehow\n\u2014 home \u2014 they had homes with upstairs and downstairs and \u2014 or even three times up.\nThis family was willing to ta \u2014 give us part of a \u2014a floor, and I\u2019m sure my father\nhad to pay. And how all that worked I have no idea, it never was discussed about\nmoney and nothing \u2014 and I feel bad that I didn\u2019t ask later on, you know, these things\nand what can I say?",
        "Q: But that means like, when you were \u2014 I \u2014 I guess what I\u2019m asking an-and I\u2019m\nwondering, is that when you\u2019d have, let\u2019s say, a lonely moment and you\u2019re with\nyour parents, did you have the ability and possibility to go back to Tante and spend\nthe afternoon?",
        "A: I could have, but it was a long walk. I didn\u2019t have a bike yet, so that was a long\nwalk. That\u2019s another thing. Yeah, then we moved somewhere else, I\u2019Il tell you.",
        "Q: Okay.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: No, at this \u2014 this place is just \u2014 this was called Willem de Zwijgerstraat. My\nhusband Bernie and I went there, I know exactly the window and everything. No, it\nwas like a bad area of town.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But, it was not far from the street that we had lived in prior to the war,\nNassaustraat.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And this is Willem de Zwijgerstraat, you can see from Nassaustraat the place\nthat we wound up living after the war. So that, from there wasn\u2019t \u2014 you know, that\nwas in the same area. So I think maybe that\u2019s why my parents wound up in that\narea, cause they knew \u2014 and where my tante lived, there was a little nicer area. It\nwas separate houses. This was like all low houses and it was a different area.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014 but did you see them then, afterwards? Did you go visit them?",
        "A: I saw them. We did not stay long in this particular place, cause it was a bad \u2014\nneighbors and a\u2014 we didn\u2019t. So my father found this other house called binnin \u2014 in\nthe Binnaeusstraat, which was close to Tante\u2019s house.",
        "Q: And one of the \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: And then \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm?",
        "A:\u2014I could go, and I walked very often to Tante\u2019s house.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you didn't have a total cutoff?",
        "A: No, my parents played bridge with them. So, I don\u2019t know if they knew them\nbefore the war, or if they became friends after the war. That I don\u2019t know, but they\nspend New Year\u2019s together, they played bridge at their house or our house.",
        "Q: So, there was \u2014 and they got along well, then?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: See, some other people have said that sometimes there was some tension\nbetween the people wh-who saved or hid the children, and the parents who returned.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Either because one was \u2014 the parents were unsure \u2014",
        "A: Unsure.",
        "Q: \u2014 and the \u2014 or the people didn\u2019t want to let go, or \u2014 or whatever. And you didn\u2019t\nhave that.",
        "A: Yeah, I can understand that, not \u2014 not \u2014 not that I know of, because they knew\neach other and they \u2014 like I said, they got together, played bridge, I remember.\nThat\u2019s when we lived \u2014 yeah, in Binnaeusstraat, I\u2019m pretty sure. Or was it \u2014 I\nNovember 10, 2008\ndon\u2019t know which house it was in. No, I was older, it had to be Binnaeusstraat.\nThey would pull up the rug. My uncle was there, Omaya(ph), Tante and my\nparents, listening to the radio, putting up music, and they danced.",
        "Q: How nice.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how I learned \u2014 my Omaya(ph) taught me how to dance, me standing\non his feet, and I learned how to dance the foxtrot, and the English waltz. And I\u2019m\nnow \u2014 oh, I\u2019m eight or nine or 10 or something like that, yeah.",
        "Q: After the war.",
        "A: After the war. That was nice, but then it also \u2014 that was a nice day or something,\nbut the regular days, going to school was not nice, because I was the only Jewish\ngirl, and everybody made fun of me, you know.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yeah. So the years after were not \u2014",
        "Q: So why did they \u2014 I mean, da \u2014 Holland has such a reputation \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 of being open and tolerant, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, there were a lot of them that weren\u2019t.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: There\u2019s a lot of them that weren\u2019t. There were a lot of people who got turned in\nby \u2014 we were very, very fortunate. And \u2014 and Tante dealt with it very good.",
        "Q: What was it like in school, what were the kids saying? Do you have memories of\nthat?",
        "A: Well, they wouldn\u2019t talk to me because I looked different for some reason, I\ndon\u2019t know. And they weren\u2019t \u2014 especially the boys, they were nasty, yeah. Some of\nthe girls were okay. I have a book, they call it a poetsy(ph), it\u2019s \u2014 you ges \u2014 it\u2019s like\na poem book that all \u2014 everybody in school would get that, with little paste things,\nstick-ums that you put in there and then you write a little poem of the person that \u2014\nyou know, like you do at high school here \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 they \u2014 they write \u2014",
        "Q: Autograph books and things.",
        "A: \u2014 something like that. And I do have that book with \u2014 there were two girls that\nlived around the corner in Willem de Zwijgerstraat when I first started school. Her\nname \u2014 one was Anika(ph), and there was a little redhead, ri-wi \u2014 Rita, I think her\nname was, something like that. And they wrote in my book. But I would never want\n\u2014 went to their house, I couldn\u2019t associate with them, so only at school.",
        "Q: Sounds like a lonely chil \u2014 a lonely time.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, I was very much by myself, very much. And then when my brother\nand sister came along, I had to take care of them. Now, we\u2019re nine and 11 years\ndifference. And if I wanted to go outside and did play with the marbles, you know,\nthe little children\u2019s play, I had to take my brother with me. I was always like a\ncaretaker of them, and I had to help. I never had a time, you know, by ourselves.\nLater on, we got a little older, the Jewish area built up a little bit, and there was a\nyouth group area, and that\u2019s where I met this girl named Frieda. And a lot of the\nDutch people know her too, and she knows a lot of people. And we\u2019ve been in\ntouch ever since, together. But the only nice time I had with a girlfriend, and that\nwas her, because she was Jewish, and she lived quite far away, but I had a bike\nthen, and we\u2019d bike to her. And she had little cooking utensils and we would cook\napplesauce from scratch. That was a big thing.",
        "Q: Sounds like fun.",
        "A: Yeah, it was fun, but then, that was a day of having a nice day, but the rest of the\ntime, this \u2014 in Willem de Zwijgerstraat, the house that we were in was right on the\ncorner and there was train tracks right next to it. And several times the train would\nstop, and it was loaded with coal. So I had to go and get a \u2014 a pail and\n[indecipherable] and climb up in the train \u2014 and everybody else did that, mostly\nguys \u2014 and I had to climb up there and steal the coal, so we would have coal in the\nNovember 10, 2008\nhouse. Now, the train must have stopped there maybe for a purpose, I don\u2019t know,\nbut \u2014",
        "Q: No, not fun. Not fun.",
        "A: \u2014I was [indecipherable]. Not fun. I didn\u2019t have a teenage years. There was\nnothing about me, you know. Very, very little.",
        "Q: Were y \u2014 did you get on with your parents in a different way, or was there\ndistance, they were too busy, or \u2014 tell us \u2014 tell me a little bit about how \u2014 how that\nwent, how that evolved.",
        "A: You know something, I don\u2019t know any details, but I remember my two and a\nhalf years with Tante. My \u2014 the rest of my years before I came here 1s mostly what\nI remember ome \u2014 you know, ask my mother, I want to go after school, go and play\nwith them. No, you have to do this, and you have to take care of your brother and\nyou have to take care of your sister. Or you have to help me, and you have to do this\nand you have to do that. That\u2019s all I remember.",
        "Q: No fun.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember no closeness, where my mother say, oh let\u2019s go shopping, just\nyou and I, let\u2019s go, you know. No, because my father was gone basically seven days\na week, earning a living, trying to earn a living by selling his socks and so on, on\nNovember 10, 2008\nthe mart, different cities. On the weekend, on Saturdays, I would have to go with\nhim, because you have to unpack the pack.",
        "Q: So you weren't religious? It wasn\u2019t if \u2014",
        "A: No, no, there was no religion. She never benched th-the light, the candles \u2014",
        "Q: What does that mean? Ah-hah, she didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] no. I\u2019ve never done it either. I do remember going to a temple,\nI do. Another thing is I remember I was being taught by a rabbi to read Hebrew.\nAnd that\u2019s when we moved to Binnaeusstraat. I was a little older, and I remember\ngoing to the temple once. But no, nothing for holidays, except Friday night we had\nchicken soup, you know, and Paula gets the \u2014 the \u2014 I got a\u2014 a polka \u2014a leg anda\nneck, that\u2019s what I got. But see, my wardrobe consists of two of this and two of that,\nand that was it. Little skirt and a little top, I don\u2019t remember my mother taking me\nshopping or anyth \u2014 I don\u2019t remember any of that.",
        "Q: How sad.",
        "A: Because the other part overtook that, always having to take care of them, that I\njust was \u2014",
        "Q: You were gone. You weren\u2019t there.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I was just there to be \u2014 for that purpose. I didn\u2019t have that closeness\nbeing the daughter, the first daughter, you know. And that\u2019s \u2014 could very well be\nbecause of what my parents went through, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Did they \u2014 when di \u2014 did they ever talk to you about any of it?",
        "A: No. No. Oh, you don\u2019t know, and you don\u2019t need to know, or you don\u2019t\nremember anything, you were too young, and \u2014 nothing. So either they were\nprotecting me, I don\u2019t know why, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: A lot of people thi \u2014 a lot of people \u2014 I \u2014 I think that this is something that comes\nup a lot in \u2014 in future relations after some traumatic event. A-And it\u2019s more than\ntrauma. I mean, it is \u2014 1t is when people have been subjected to humiliations. When\npeople have been stretched to their limit, they think that \u2014 that if they don\u2019t say\nsomething, they can keep that kind of vulnerability from the children \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and maybe their children will be protected from it. But then another hole\ndevelops, you know?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: In that child, or in the relationship, that there\u2019s a silence there.",
        "A: Right.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: And \u2014 and it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard, I think, to know when 1s the rent \u2014 when is the\nright time? Am I damaging my child if I say something? Am I going to lose it if I\nsay something?",
        "A: Right, right. So, I know that all the time I lived in Holland, I would never say\nthat I was Jewish, I would never talk to anybody about it. I tried to assimilate or be\nlike everybody else, but yet, I knew I was different, because there the fi \u2014 the girls\nat school, their \u2014 their way of doing things, the way the ate, the way they \u2014 their\nbehavior was so different than mine. I had uns \u2014 not really n \u2014 realizing it, I had this\nstuff on my shoulder of what happened to me, and I could not talk about that. So, I\nalways was different, and that took me a long, long, long time to get out of it. The\nonly time I could \u2014 finally got out of it is when I joined the survivor, the child\nsurvivors\u2019 group.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Before that \u2014 a very long time. Not until the early 90s.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: Yes. I would not talk, I worked and I \u2014 and \u2014 and people find out, oh, you\u2019re \u2014\nyou\u2019re from Holland. Yes. Were you there during the war? Yes. Well, what\nhappened? Nothing. You know. How I'd never wear a Jewish star, I \u2014 I have o \u2014 I\nhave them, but I wouldn't wear them. I\u2019d \u2014 never the identification that I\u2019m Jewish.\nNovember 10, 2008\nAnd that only \u2014 even in America, you know, at the beginning, I wouldn\u2019t say that I\nwas \u2014 not Jewish, but in hiding.",
        "Q: Take me up to the point where you\u2019re already an adult \u2014 I mean, if there 1s more\nt-to add to, teenage years or other events that you want to remember, or something\nsignificant about your parents and \u2014 and \u2014 and what happened during the war years,\nfine \u2014",
        "A: No, I just \u2014 I think I \u2014 I kind of talked about that, because they wound up being\nfriends and they s \u2014 you know, played cards together and \u2014 and \u2014 well, we just had a\nvery simple life, nothing exciting, it was just surviving life.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that was it.",
        "Q: And you came to the United States in 19 seven \u2014",
        "A: \u00b050\u2014\u201953.",
        "Q: Oh, in 1953?",
        "A: \u00b053, with my parents.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, I see.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, you left Holland fairly early on?",
        "A: Yes, I was 15.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. So then my Uncle Ted, who had gotten here somehow \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 from New York, he wound up in California, and he sponsored my father, for\nus to come. And so we came in *53. We took the \u2014 the \u2014 my father came in 1952, he",
        "Q: To set the \u2014 s-see \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: To see [indecipherable] yeah, to see how it\u2019s gonna work.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then my parents, my mother had to sell the furniture they had. I don\u2019t know\nhow they got all this furniture back after the war, or I don\u2019t know anything about\nthat. So we came on the \u2014 we first went to Paris, her family lived in Paris, so, to\nsay goodbye. And \u2014 oh, during the \u2014 before that, when I was younger, my mother\nsent me to Paris to live \u2014 to visit my grandparents. Now, my grandparents spoke\nFrench and Yiddish, I spoke Dutch. I understand Yiddish, but I can\u2019t speak Yiddish.",
        "Q: When you were a baby, was it \u2014 did they speak to you in Dutch, your parents, or\nin Yiddish. Before the war. Do you know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You just know that you spoke Dutch.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I know I spoke Dutch and I could understand Yiddish, from hearing it from\nthem, I suppose. So I \u2014 I did spend a week in Paris with my gram \u2014 grandparents,\nand we couldn\u2019t really communicate. So we went \u2014 before we left to come to\nAmerica, we went to Paris and \u2014 to say goodbye, and board the fle de France ship.\nAnd we took the ship across; took about seven days I believe. And me with motion\nsickness, that didn't work too well, but \u2014 so we got to New York. My mother\u2019s\ngirlfriend from Europe, who lived now in New York, picked us up and we stayed\nfor one day and then we caught the train to go to California.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And we were on a train and with my little brother and my little sister and me, so\nI had to deal with that. And then we come to Los Angeles, and my uncle and my\nfather pick us up, and they drive us to this \u2014 the mountains, which is unbelievable to\nsee, huge. It was very scary, because Holland, you know, is flat. So the drive \u2014 we\ncome to this area where my uncle had a quote, a ranch, he ca \u2014 which he called the\nBar Mitzvah ranch. He had a cow, skinny than anything, and several animals, and\nNovember 10, 2008\nchickens, and that was the ranch. So we come now there, and my father had a trailer\nthere, small trailer that he was living in, and now there\u2019s four of us. No \u2014 yeah, four\nof us coming and \u2014 in that trailer.",
        "Q: In the trailer.",
        "A: Of course there\u2019s no room. Paula wound up living in the house. I had a room\nthat my Tante Ted\u2019s wife, Clair, and she took me under her wing. She told me, you\ngotta get a haircut, you gotta take off these little gold earrings, they\u2019re childish and\nyou gotta grow up now. Okay. So, ti \u2014 they sent us to school, I went into the eighth\ngrade just for a few months, cause we came in March of 53. And I went to this\neighth grades class, where they assigned one of the pupils that sit next to me, to\nkind of teach me what\u2019s going on. Now, I had some English, a little knowledge,\ncause at school in Holland, the \u2014 the high school there, you learn all these\nlanguages. I learned Dutch \u2014 of course, Dutch; English; French and German. Which\nI hated. So \u2014 so, come September, we\u2019re moving now to this town called\nLancaster, California and my father now has a chicken ranch, 20,000 chickens.",
        "A: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Q: Tiny baby chicks, and he\u2019s raising chickens. That becomes his livelihood in the\nStates, where he was more of a businessman.",
        "Q: Poultry farmer.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah. And he buys this property with a house, one bedroom. And now, you\nknow, the five of us. So, my brother, sister are small and they live \u2014 they sleep on a\ncouch that makes into a bed. That house had like a little outhouse, not a bath, but an\nouthouse there, just a \u2014 a little room, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m at. There\u2019s no heat,\nno air conditioning. They did have some light that they hooked up from the laundry\nroom, which was next to the garage. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m now. I have no \u2014 I have\nnothing of me, I\u2019m just always being outcast, you know. Okay, Paula, you do this\nPaula, that, and \u2014 and I had to work in the chicken house before school.",
        "Q: The minute you \u2014 yeah, the minute you said to \u2014 you said to me he was a poultry\nfarmer, I thought, oh my gosh, that\u2019s labor intensive.",
        "A: Yes. And everyday before school, after school, seven days a week, I had to help\nfeed the chickens.",
        "Q: I would have thought, I can\u2019t wait to get away from here.",
        "A: And it was all manual. Eventually he wound up getting automatic feeders and\nautomatic water, but not while I was there. And \u2014 and my little brother, who\u2019s six,\nhe also had to start helping. And the school, we had to go by bus to school, and I\nhad never the opportunity to go with some of the friends, or girls at the school, to go\nto a movie, or visiting them, or spending time with \u2014",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. When I was in Holland \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have fights with your parents, or were you so quiet you just kind of gave\nup?",
        "A: I didn't fight, because it didn\u2019t lead to anything, I still have to do what I \u2014 what I\nhad to do. I told them I didn\u2019t like it, but I had to help support, you know, the\nlivelihood. I also, across the street, there was a family there that had no children,\nand she needed somebody to clean the house. So, besides doing the chickens and all\nthat, I went there, but I loved it, because it was an American house. She had a piano,\nand I was able to do a little piano. And I, for lunch she would make me a sandwich\non this nice bread, and I got to drink a Coke. And so, I enjoyed that, that was my\nenjoyment. Yeah, I\u2019m a teenager. She\u2019d be doing so many other things, and this 1s\nwhat I was doing. So I was really kept back and I became a late bloomer.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: No, no. I\u2014I got married right after high school.",
        "Q: To Bernie? How\u2019d you meet?\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Lancaster had the beginning of a temple in \u2014 in a house. And we did go to that,\nbecause we got to meet people there, you have a congregation. There\u2019s a woman\nthere, when she saw a new girl in the group, there was a \u2014 I think there was one \u2014\none boy there, Matt was his name, who went to high school, and I went to high\nschool there and she was going to try and fix me up. You know, in those days, you\ngot married very early. So she was trying to fix me up and she found Bernie. Shall I\ntalk about how he got to Lancaster? He was new y \u2014 he comes from New York,\nthe Bronx. He comes from a \u2014 a six kids family. And he came to visit his brother,\nwho lived in Lancaster and worked at Edwards Air Force base, Lou. And he\ncame in November of 54, got off the plane, dressed with the \u2014 it was so cold in\nNew York and he comes to California, his brother picks him up in shorts and\nsandal and hawa \u2014 a shirt, a Hawaiian shirt. He turns and he tells him \u2014 and he calls\nhis mother when he got settled, I\u2019m never coming back to New York, cause this is\nwonderful. Anyway, he gets a job in haberdashery, in men\u2019s clothing, and this lady,\nBelle Miska(ph) found him at the store, at \u2014 Herman\u2019s was the name of the store,\nand she s-says, oh, I have a girl for you.

Now, he had a billy club, and I don\u2019t know if the soldier\nhad a gun or not, because there was no shooting involved, but there was fighting,\nand the soldier hit my father on the nose with the billy club, and it was bleeding\nNovember 10, 2008\nvery heavily.

And I said, well, I\u2019m busy with the kids, I\u2019m doing the wash and I have\nto go grocery shopping, all this and that. I said, why doesn\u2019t she come here and visit\nme? Well, she has one of the babies, they\u2019re sleeping, the babies are sleeping. I said,\nNovember 10, 2008\nso? You have the baby in the carriage or wherever you traveled, you know. What\ndifference does that make? My mother would always stand up for my younger\nsister. And there was never any \u2014 any close \u2014 a real closeness, there was not.",

        "Q: She figured it out.",
        "A: She figured out, and she didn\u2019t work in the chicken house. So that only left my\nbrother, after I left. And we would ask, well nor \u2014 my brother\u2019s named Norman \u2014\nfor him to come and spend the day with us, and my father would always say no, he\nstays here with the chickens and those five acres, that\u2019s what the property was he\nhad, this is the place for him.",

        "Q: Did you maintain ties [coughing] oh, bless you, hang on. Did you maintain\ncontact with Tante Rowter(ph) and Omaya(ph)?",
        "A: When I came to this country, we kept writing letters. Cause before we left, you\nknow, I did say goodbye, and I think we cried. She \u2014 she re \u2014 she really cared for\nme. And so then we were in touch with letters. I could never afford to go back to\nHolland until \u2014 not until 1985. She passed away. I would get the letter with the\nblack border. First Omaya(ph) passed away, in the early 60s. And then Tante\npassed away July 31, 1975, which is the same day my mother passed away.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Double whammy, yes. I had made an afghan, I crocheted an afghan and sent that\nto my tante. And she s-started to get ill.

        "A: I don\u2019t know, cause I never knew the family.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: I never found out anything. If my tante wrote something in the letter, I don\u2019t\nknow where they\u2019re at, or where it was. And in 1985, when we were able to come \u2014\ngo back, Bernie and I went \u2014 wanted to go to Holland, we stayed \u2014 we stayed in a \u2014\nin a hotel in Heeze, which is outside of Eindhoven, and I said, okay Bernie, I n \u2014 I\nknow exactly where to go to the house. My girlfriend Trix(ph) from school, I\u2019ve\nalways been in touch with her, she\u2019s not Jewish \u2014 and we always corresponded. So\nthey came to the hotel, and I told him how to go to the house in Huidenstraat also,\nbut then Trix(ph), I think, knew where that was. But Bernie and I had done that\nfirst. And I could tell him, you take this street and that street, I don\u2019t know how I\ndid that, but anyway, we got to the house in 85, and my \u2014 my friend says, Trix(ph)\nsays, oh, why don\u2019t you get out and ring the bell? Well, I was frozen in my seat, I\ncould not get out of my \u2014 the car. I started to cry and I said, but if I ring the bell, it\u2019s\n\u2014 Tante isn\u2019t there. There\u2019s other people living there. I don\u2019t want to see the way\nNovember 10, 2008\nthe house 1s for them. I want to remember the hou \u2014 how the hou \u2014 how the house\nwas for me, with Tante. So I never did go in there.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. But, there were the roses outside in the front, and then we drove, cause it\u2019s\nnext to a\u2014a plane, we drove around there and got to the back of the house with that\nwater and the Weeping Willows and all that, and it just phew, floods, you know,\ncomes back of memories. And that \u2014 that \u2014 that was good, that \u2014 I needed to do that.\nBut there was nobody else there that I knew, yeah.",
        "Q: And in 1991 you say, the first time you felt like you could have that burden lifted\nfrom you, is when \u2014 or put words to things, was when you joined the child\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "A: Yeah, I joined it early 90s, I don\u2019t exactly \u2014 was it \u2019\u00b092, I\u2014 I don\u2019t quite\nremember the year, but I know it was in the very early 90s.",
        "Q: What happened when you joined?",
        "A: When I joined that group, and they had group workshops or whatever you call\nthem, and I got there and I see all these people who have gone through s \u2014 this type\nof, you know, either in camps or hiding, I was just overwhelmed, I was just shocked\nthat there\u2019s so many people. I didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And it wasn\u2019t just you?\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah. And then I \u2014 it \u2014 the person who held that workshop was Daisy Miller. I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar, but she\u2019s \u2014 she did the whole \u2014 the conference here,\npart of it. But she was so good and she\u2019s \u2014 people are sitting there and they\u2019re\ntalking about what happened. And I don\u2019t know if I spoke the first time that I went\nor not, because I was just overwhelmed. I know Bernie stayed outside, he said he\ndidn\u2019t want to go in, so he stayed outside. And \u2014 and maybe I did say, you know,\nI\u2019m \u2014I was \u2014 they must have asked where I\u2019m from, and I said from Holland. But\nmost people were from Amsterdam, not Eindhoven, no, I haven\u2019t found anybody,\nexcept my friend Frieda. It was just unbelievable, and people were talking and all\nthat. And it just \u2014 I thought, wow. So I went often, whenever they had the meetings,\nand I started to talk. And it felt so good. It felt so good to do that, that I was getting\na little courage.

        "Q: Do they ask you now?",
        "A: No. I have talked and told them, my grandkids and everybody, they know. But\nthey never come to me and say, you want to talk, or ask questions. They don\u2019t. They\nNovember 10, 2008\nall feel \u2014 when you go to these groups, sometimes the subject is, are your children,\nor do your children feel that they are hindered or something, because of the mo \u2014\npar \u2014 the mother\u2019s background, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 going through the Holocaust? And I thought to myself, no. They\u2019 ve never\ntalked about it, never said, oh, because you did this, that\u2019s why you\u2019re the way you\nare, and something. So when I came home I asked them. I called them and I asked\nthem that particular question. And their response was, what are you talking about,\nMom? What? There\u2019s nothing there because of you. No, you were always okay, that\n\u2014 but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m very confused.",

        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Right.",

        "A: Not necessarily. Well, the one thing that I know when I got married with Bernie,\nwhen I was 18, he comes \u2014 well, he is, and I guess he comes from very strong\nparents who came from Russia. And growing up in New York, you have a different\nway of growing up than I did, of course, but he always told me that I should become\nmore independent and be strong. And he \u2014 he really had influenced me for that, and\nit helped. He never said, oh, you don\u2019t need to go to these meetings, that doesn\u2019t\ngonna help you, you know, and he was always there, and wanted me to do what I\nneeded to do. And he was my support, so \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",

And he really made my life full and \u2014 and complete and \u2014 and\nwith no hang-ups. And I \u2014I\u2014 I\u2019m very, very blessed for that, because he \u2014 he made\nme stronger, and he made me appreciate everything and it was just \u2014 he was the\nright guy for me. I didn't have mut \u2014 much \u2014 much experience of dating other guys\nin \u2014 in Lancaster, but the ones that I dated were all flakes.

I\ngrew up in \u2014 ina family where I was loved, and hearing about parents love children.\nAnd when I had my own child, this revelation happened, that when I would walk in\nthe room, her face lit up.

        "A: Slocky(ph). Five slocky(ph) to give to where they were renting a house. And\nthey needed si \u2014 they were very, very poor. And by being very, very poor is why he\nsent his sons away. So, actually from 1920 on, \u201928 on, my father never saw his\nparents and the parents never saw their children.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Have a better life, exactly, exactly. And \u2014 and then my father just found his \u2014",
        "A: Okay. So, my father, I had that picture at home of him getting off the train\nstation, I \u2014 either Germany or wherever it\u2019s at. So he settled in Holland, in\nEindhoven. Somehow became eind \u2014 Eindhoven. And I \u2014 like I said, I believe that\nmy mother\u2019s parents came to Holland, and that\u2019s how my parents met each other.\nMy mother\u2019s father was a \u2014 a le \u2014 dealing in leather goods. And then they wound up\nback in France, and like I said, my mother had five \u2014 family of five. She had one\nsister and three brothers. Three, four, five, yeah. Okay, and \u2014",
        "A: Now what do I say \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: One of them \u2014 the younger one did. Ther \u2014 they were two years apart. The older\nbrother, Ted, he \u2014 I don\u2019t know too much about him, how he wound up in America,\nbut he hid on a ship or something like \u2014 as a cook.",
        "A: A stowaway, yeah. And that\u2019s how he came to America. And \u2014 and he\u2019s the one\nwho wound up sponsoring us. So, I have a picture, and it must have been before he\nwound up in America, when I\u2019m a \u2014 a baby, and my parents are taking me \u2014 my\nfather had a Ford, a car, and it must have been 1930 \u2014 probably 30 \u2014 late thes \u2014 37\nor \u00b038, and they put me in the back of the car, like a little hammock. I mean, very\nsafe. And I was \u2014 that\u2019s how they traveled to Paris. And I have a picture of my\nUncle Ted and my parents and me in Paris. And that\u2019s where my mother\u2019s family\nwas, so they traveled to \u2014 to visit them.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yes, yes. I don\u2019t know what he was doing, I \u2014 that part, I have no idea. I also\nhave a picture of a very nice, low house, because they\u2019re all connected. And the\nway my mother was dressed, overall, they were doing very nicely, apparently. My\nfather later on, and maybe that\u2019s what he did early on, was in the hosiery and socks\nand so on.",
        "A: Before \u2014 no, no, I do not know. Never talked about it. And the problem is, I\nnever asked questions. You know, children, we didn't ask questions. We had a nice\n\u2014I was dressed very nicely, everything was fine. So when I saw the pictures, and\nthey were still alive, and I just looked at the picture, oh how nice. But I never asked\nany questions. I was \u2014 I was a child, I just did what had to be done and I listened.\nAnd when the time came that I had to go into hiding, I don\u2019t know if I asked why,\nbut they always \u2014 I think they just gave a story, well, you\u2019re gonna stay with \u2014\nshould I say the name? Yeah, not yet.",
        "A: My earliest memories, actual, physical memories are from the hiding time.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: No, only what I see on a picture, but nothing, nothing. My hiding life is \u2014",
        "A: Four and a half.",
        "A: Yeah, cause this is the time, that picture that I showed you, just a little after that\nis July 1942, we had to go into hiding.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s correct, that\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: No, well, my mother.",
        "A: Yes. She said that I had to go and live with these people and they were going to\nlive with some other pe \u2014 they were gonna go away, not live, going away to \u2014 to be\nNovember 10, 2008\nwith these people, but theyll come back to see me, and we\u2019ll all be together again.\nAnd that\u2019s a time that \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014 yes, tha-that\u2019s when they took me to these people that they knew prior and\narranged, made this arrangement that I would go be living with them. They had no\nchildren of their own, and \u2014 and they, like I said, would be coming back to take me\nhome.",
        "A: Oh yes, and I remember crying after them leaving, and they were crying and \u2014\nand I ran after them. And the people that I stayed with, which I wound up calling\nTante and Omaya(ph) are holding onto me and not letting me run too far, but yes, I\nremember that like yesterday.",
        "A: Those are the memories I \u2014I really have so strongly.",
        "A: Yes.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. No, we always seemed to have \u2014 I must have had a very good\nlife because there\u2019s nothing traumatic for me to \u2014 to remember. And it\u2019s like\nchildren \u2014 like my own children, they don\u2019t remember that time either.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay, okay. The people that I was staying with was \u2014 I called her was Tanta\nRowter(ph), that was her last name, a real Dutch name because sh \u2014 actually, she\nwas German, but she had lived there for a long time and married this Dutch man\ncalled Yap(ph) Rowter(ph). And they were \u2014 had no children.",
        "A: To \u20141n my eyes, they were older, and they probably were in their maybe late\n30s, early 40s. They were old people, because my parents were so much younger.\nCause my father \u2014 my mother was born in 1912, 1912, and my mother was born in\n1911. So in 1942 \u2014 well, maybe they were more or less the same age. But \u2014 so I st \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008\nI \u2014I lived with them, I was to be their niece, and I had to live their way, their last\nname, their religion, which was \u2014 they didn\u2019t really have much of religion, but there\nwas Protestant. And I was going to be raised Catholic.",
        "A: Because they had a \u2014 a\u2014 a maid, a young girl, 18 or 19, she came every day.\nAnd she\u2019s the one who taught me the Catholic-ism type of thing. And because that\nway I could go to the church and with \u2014 and go to school with the nuns. So \u2014",
        "A: Rowter(ph), Paula Rowter(ph).",
        "A: Just as Paula \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Rowter(ph), yeah.",
        "A: And that was my name, and I went to school for about three months.",
        "A: Well, now it\u2019s five.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And I did the catechis \u2014 I \u2014 you know, I do remember this church\nand the nuns and the water that\u2019s on the side, and \u2014 and I ha \u2014 I was so excited, this\nmaid who was there, she gave me a rosary. Oh, and that was such a personal thing\nthat was mine, you know. I don\u2019t know if I knew that I had been, or was Jewish. I\ndon\u2019t know because I never dealt with that until afterwards.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember her name. It was a real Dutch name. And she was very nice,\nshe helped me a lot and \u2014 and \u2014 and when I was living there with the tante, I was\nnormal. I had a normal life. I guess I forgot about my parents, you know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t seem to remember that. But if I really think deeply and go back a lot, that\nI mu \u2014 I think I must have done that in the first few days, because my tante gave me\na doll with a little carriage to, you know, keep me happy and to just divert my\nattention. And I think, you know, when I really go deep now that I\u2019m talking to you\nabout that, about my own past feelings and all that, I can see the carriage and I can\nsee the doll. And also I can see her kitchen.",
        "A: Was a big kitchen, a real bare room with a big, black stove. And she would be\ncooking with the maid, who would be helping. I was also with the maid now,\nhelping her clean rooms. See, the people, they ran a boarding house, so they \u2014 it was\na big house, and they had lots of rooms and the maid would work in the rooms, or\nclean the bed and the bathroom, and I would be helping her, becau \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, but I was dur \u2014 her niece from \u2014 wherever that niece came from, where\nmy tante was German, but I didn\u2019t speak German, I spoke Dutch. So, the niece was\neither from the husband\u2019s side, my Oma, cause he was perfectly Dutch, he was all\nDutch. And I don\u2019t know whose niece I was, but she always said I\u2019m her niece. And\nlike I said, I did go to school for a little bit, and I had a first communion, whatever\nthat age was, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: It had to be earlier, cause I was not allowed \u2014 the first few months I was out,\nthey had children next door, the neighbor had children, a little boy and a girl, and I\nwould play with them. And they had a, like a \u2014 they built a\u2014 where you go hide\nwhen the bombs come.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: A shelter, a shelter. And I would play with these children a few times, and then\nthey start to ask questions of me. I was not blonde and blue-eyed, you know, I was\ndark haired. And they would say, are you Jewish? And I would ask my tante, what\ndoes that mean, am I Jewish? She says, now you can never go outside any longer,\nbecause the parents of those children \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 were \u2014 by talking. They also had that big shelter, which they dug down and\nthat\u2019s all sand, you know, like a \u2014 like a little [indecipherable] like a little\nmountain. And Tante had asked the parents if we could go in there if it needed, for\nthe bombs, and they said no. They said no. So they were very anti.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, no, she never told me that I was Jewish. She says, you just cannot play\nwith, those are not nice children, you cannot play with them. Okay, I\u2019m a nice little\ngirl and I listen. And she said, you cannot go outside any more, and I didn't ask. I\nNovember 10, 2008\nwas content in the house. And between her, she was very sweet to me, and my\nuncle, who was very nice, he \u2014 they had no children, they enjoyed \u2014 I would \u2014 I was\nallowed to go in the garden with my oma, cause he was growing vegetables. I\nremember that, and I was going with the maid to help clean the house, and I played\nwith my doll. That\u2019s what I called, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, because there\u2019s no walls. In Europe there\u2019s no walls, at least in Holland at\nthat time.",
        "A: No, they had a \u2014 a dirt area somewhere, I don\u2019t know, because the back of their\nhouse had like a water, a little \u2014 not a river, but something that flowed, with\nbeautiful Weeping Willows.",
        "A: I'll never forget the Weeping Willows, it was just so pretty. Her front yard had\nlike a little fence full of roses. And the house was a very nice house, I \u2014 I \u2014 when I\nwent back in 1985, I found it and I \u2014 but anyway, that\u2019s another story.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, at that time I couldn\u2019t do anything any more.",
        "A: Because of this. I \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s a huge thing 1s right, but I could not go outside any more after those\nchildren. Maybe it was a little longer period than what I\u2019m remembering, because I\nremember going to the nuns, and I think the nun knew who I was. But they were\nvery nice, very sweet, but I remember doing that, and then I remember I couldn\u2019t do\nanything any more, I had to stay inside. And it got heavier, I think, when the\nGermans got more prominent there.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My \u2014 because of my tante and omaya(ph) having this big house \u2014 excuse me \u2014\nthe \u2014 they had to take in an SS officer. He had to live in because they had the room.\nAnd that\u2019s how heavy it got when he is there and I\u2019m there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have a face.",
        "A: Just a uniform. Ugly black, horrible black, black uniform with big, black boots.\nThose uniform and the boots are with me 24/7 if I allow it to come out.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know his face. Very scary, cause I\u2019m in the house there with people and\nso on, and now we have this guy there. I sit on his lap, he puts me on his lap, I talk\nto him like a soldier.",
        "A: Oh yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: On and off. I kind of got to know him, you know, he was there fo \u2014 seemed to\nme for a long time. Til the end. He was there until the end.",
        "A: No, I have no vision of his face. I-I either didn\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t want to remember it \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, because to me the \u2014 the uniform 1s all I know, is the uniform.",
        "A: Because I have never seen a person with a uniform like that. I mean, that\u2019s a\nhorrible thing, I \u2014 I am young, and I was \u2014 lived in a nice area at home, there was no\nuniforms. Tante didn\u2019t have any uniforms. The people that lived there were no\nuniforms. And then comes this guy with the \u2014 the boots, you know, and it click-\nclacked the way it \u2014 that was \u2014",
        "A: No, they wanted me to be just casual, because I\u2019m \u2014 you know, and I was taught,\nand being me, I was told never say what your real last name 1s, and just I\u2019m your\ntante and I\u2019m your oma, you\u2019re just living here with \u2014 with me. And that \u2014 that was\nit. He did have other ones, other soldiers came to the house. When that happened,\nNovember 10, 2008\nwhen other SS officers came to the house, I had to go to the basement. I wasn\u2019t\nallowed to be around, because \u2014",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Some \u2014 yeah, downstairs. Just something, you know, there\u2019s too much, and that\nthey\u2019re talking and all that, and you\u2019ll just be in their way. So I had to go in the\nbasement, and I took my dolly and my \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 I forgot the name of it now \u2014\nthe rosacal \u2014 what do you call \u2014",
        "A: Rosary, yes, that was always with me. The rosary was my savior. I was taught\nthat that\u2019s my savior. Whenever there\u2019s something bad, I need to pray with this\nrosary.",
        "A: I learned prayers, I don\u2019t remember them, cause right the war was over, I did\naway with all that, and I don\u2019t remember that.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: But I remember having them in my hand, and knowing how to inter \u2014 interlink\nthem in my fingers, and making the cross, and had my little dolly. And that was it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Two and a half years.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: That\u2019s amazing, that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I didn\u2019t see them, I didn't \u2014 I might have asked my tante a few times, and after\nthat I became so much like a child, well, now you\u2019re living with somebody else.\nThis is your life now. This is how you have to survive, and this 1s \u2014 this 1s it.",
        "A: As very timid at that time. Not today, but at that time. And always listening to\nwhat I was told.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: A very good girl, yes, and I s \u2014 good girl. Had the big bow in my hair, you know,\nall that.",
        "A: And whatever they did for me \u2014 told me to do, I would do, go with him \u2014 Tante,\ngo with Omaya(ph) now and this and that. Or go with \u2014 now I wish I remember the\nname of that cleaning lady \u2014 that mai-maid, or whatever they called her. Yeah, I\nwas. I\u2019m getting emotional. I have \u2014 I have not been emotional about this, because\nI\u2019m emotional about something else.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, about the way I was when I was a little girl, that\u2019s all I remember.\nAnd maybe cause I miss \u2014 miss the people I lived with. They were \u2014 they were nice.\nAnd you know, when you talk about every little detail, brings back memories, and\nmy state of my \u2014 my being at the moment is very touchy because I lost my husband\nseven months ago, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m more emotional than I usually am.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Exactly. And now, that\u2019s exactly the feeling that it is and that\u2019s bringing tears to\nmy eyes because I can\u2019t imagine that \u2014 that all that happened. But you know, I\nremember so much of that period, and so much of afterwards, too. But I think it\u2019s a\nlittle bit because of my \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, thank you.",
        "A: Yeah, there was a \u2014 there was a man there and there was a woman there. I don\u2019t\nknow their names, but I remember, vaguely, their faces. See, I remember their\nfaces, I remember this girl, the maid, her face, but not this SS officer\u2019s face. So \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: So maybe inside of me I knew it was danger, because this man with boots and a\nuniform, that would represent to any child \u2014",
        "A: Scary, yes.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re ready for the end of it, because of\nsomething that \u2014 that he did at the end, how \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 when the war ended. Well, during the war, I \u2014 I\u2014 with the bombing, two doors\ndown, there was another shelter there, and those people let us in because we did\nhave the bombing scares, and we were in the shelter, and all of us, the people th \u2014",
        "A: No \u2014 ye\u2014 yes. Well no, I don\u2019t know. No, I think there\u2019s \u2014 German? I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: That part I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 all I know is bombs.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: And we all went in there and I remember in that shelter, I prayed like anything,\nbecause the girl was with me and I went \u2014 boy, I went to town and prayed and\nprayed and prayed that we wouldn't get hurt.",
        "A: Yeah, with the rosary and the whole thing. Yes, I remember that. I remember the\nshelter cause they had like shelves of beds, you know, in there in case we had to\nStay.",
        "A: Yes, a big shelter. And when it was over, the raid was over, the house next door\nto Tante, that got bombed, but we did not, our house was saved. So, I \u2014 all that\npraying I did helped our house.",
        "A: Yeah. So, when they ended the war, the two and a half years have gone \u2014 well,\nno \u2014 yeah, it must have been at that time, he \u2014 he had to leave, of course. And when\nhe left, we stood at the front door, and that\u2019s another vision I have, just right now.\nMy tante is here, I\u2019m over here, he is outside facing me, and he\u2019s looking right at\nme. And his finger comes up, and he says, Paula, now you can go free. Now, he\u2019s\nspeaking German, and my tante knows German. And I\u2019m standing there and he\nNovember 10, 2008\nsays, you can go free. After he leaves, tante looks at me, because now I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m\nseven, and she says, he knew. He knew. Now I know that I\u2019m Jewish because I\u2019m\nseve \u2014 I\u2019m older, maybe they told me, or \u2014 and then she says, he knew that you\nwere here hiding, or something, another word that she said. And that\u2019s what he said,\nsO \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, I remember him standing there, I don\u2019t see a face, I see\nthat uniform and that finger coming right at me, pointing. He says, Paula, you can\ngo free. So this guy either had a heart, either he has his own child, cause I did sit on\nhis lap, and he didn't turn me or them or anybody in this whole household in.",
        "A: And then I thought maybe all my praying worked.",
        "A: Yeah. I [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right, right.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Well, I remember I couldn\u2019t understand, I didn\u2019t quite comprehend what all that\nmeant. So, I\u2019m sure I talked to Tante about that and I think what she said is now,\npretty soon, Mommy and Daddy are gonna come \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to get you, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "A: She must have, because she knew that they were coming at a certain day. So,\neither they were able to, through their hiding place \u2014 places, they had several hiding\nplaces \u2014 my father had a fight with a German soldier on top \u2014 on the roof.",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah, okay.",
        "A: But they must have known how to get in touch with each other, one way or the\nother, to say this and this date, you know, they\u2019re gonna come and get you. But I\nremember in the house, when it became close to the liberation time, we went \u2014 it\nwas e \u2014 nighttime I\u2019m not \u2014 evening time, it was very dark out, and we went up on\nthe \u2014 they had little windows up in the attic, and I guess they heard on the news or\nsomething that the liberators were coming. And they were going to come by\nparachute out of the plane in Sun, s-u-n, that\u2019s a name of a little town near\nNovember 10, 2008\nEindhoven. So we all went up there, I remember that, looking out the window and\nthere\u2019s all these white parachutes, one after another, after another, after another, and\nwe were so happy to see that, cause they were going to liberate us, and \u2014 and if you\nwatch the movie, the \u2014 \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 with the Battle of the Bulge and all that, and they talk about Eindhoven and\nthey talk about the parachutes coming down. So when I see that movie and \u2014 and\nwait for that particular scene, it just all comes right back and there\u2019s just such a\ngreat feeling.",
        "A: America, och, America, then the soldiers walking down the street and the\nEnglish ones, the Americans and they give you the chocolate and \u2014 and they\u2019re\nwearing nice uniforms, not this ugly, terrible black uniform and oh \u2014 that \u2014\nwhenever I would see soldiers, you know, walking around and all that, I just felt oh,\nthey\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re my savior. They\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re wonderful, wonderful\npeople, you know, you can trust them. You couldn\u2019t trust the ugly ones.",
        "A: No. So \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Well, they came, it was 1945.",
        "A: They did not come when Holland was liberated in \u201944. We weren\u2019t always \u2014 I\nthink, not sure that we were free s \u2014 until the war actually was over. And when\nTante says, now we\u2019re gonna go outside and wait for them on the street. And the\ntime came, there they were. A lot of people walking around now and all that, and\nthey came down the street, and I ran to them, I knew them. And they ran to me and\nthat was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 just a \u2014 yeah, they made it and I made it and that was a great feeling, very\nhealthy.",
        "A: Mm-hm, oh yeah, absolutely. And they had said they will come back, and they\ndid. And that was \u2014 I must say, they stayed a few days at Tante\u2019s house until they\ncould find a place for us to move into. But that was the last time that I was their\nlittle girl. The feeling of parents and children. Because either what they went\nthrough \u2014 never talked about what they went through, except that only \u2014 later on\nthey talked about it in \u2014 in \u2014 when we were here in America, my father would say a\nfew things, and told me what happened to him. But at that time they had to find the\nNovember 10, 2008\nplace, they had to go back and make a living, and there was no closeness. The\ncloseness was gone. I hav \u2014 was so close with Tanta and Omaya(ph), I didn\u2019t have\nthat closeness with them, either because the two and a half years of separation, and I\nam now a little more grown and loved the way I ha \u2014 was being treated for those\ntwo and a half years. Now I\u2019m with my parents, who have nothing, and they can\u2019t\ngive all that feeling any more. And from then on in, life got hard, life was tough,\nversus the two and a half years that I had to endure the basement and all that. But \u2014",
        "A: It was tough because they were so much in their own, with their own problems\nthat they had, and not knowing how to really deal with me, to \u2014 in other words, to\npick up from the day that they, you know, left me, until the day I\u2014 I\u2014 we \u2014 we were\ntogether. The \u2014 the feelings just was okay, we have to eat now, we have to do this\nnow and you have to go to school now and \u2014 but nothing \u2014 I don\u2019t remember any,\nyou know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 all of that.",
        "A: Yes. And then my mother got pregnant, so now I have a little brother.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a \u2014 yes, from \u2014 well, in Eindhoven, you know, nothing 1s far like it is\nhere, but still, yeah it was a different area, trying to find where they could somehow\n\u2014 home \u2014 they had homes with upstairs and downstairs and \u2014 or even three times up.\nThis family was willing to ta \u2014 give us part of a \u2014a floor, and I\u2019m sure my father\nhad to pay. And how all that worked I have no idea, it never was discussed about\nmoney and nothing \u2014 and I feel bad that I didn\u2019t ask later on, you know, these things\nand what can I say?",
        "A: I could have, but it was a long walk. I didn\u2019t have a bike yet, so that was a long\nwalk. That\u2019s another thing. Yeah, then we moved somewhere else, I\u2019Il tell you.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: No, at this \u2014 this place is just \u2014 this was called Willem de Zwijgerstraat. My\nhusband Bernie and I went there, I know exactly the window and everything. No, it\nwas like a bad area of town.",
        "A: But, it was not far from the street that we had lived in prior to the war,\nNassaustraat.",
        "A: And this is Willem de Zwijgerstraat, you can see from Nassaustraat the place\nthat we wound up living after the war. So that, from there wasn\u2019t \u2014 you know, that\nwas in the same area. So I think maybe that\u2019s why my parents wound up in that\narea, cause they knew \u2014 and where my tante lived, there was a little nicer area. It\nwas separate houses. This was like all low houses and it was a different area.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I saw them. We did not stay long in this particular place, cause it was a bad \u2014\nneighbors and a\u2014 we didn\u2019t. So my father found this other house called binnin \u2014 in\nthe Binnaeusstraat, which was close to Tante\u2019s house.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: And then \u2014",
        "A:\u2014I could go, and I walked very often to Tante\u2019s house.",
        "A: No, my parents played bridge with them. So, I don\u2019t know if they knew them\nbefore the war, or if they became friends after the war. That I don\u2019t know, but they\nspend New Year\u2019s together, they played bridge at their house or our house.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Unsure.",
        "A: Yeah, I can understand that, not \u2014 not \u2014 not that I know of, because they knew\neach other and they \u2014 like I said, they got together, played bridge, I remember.\nThat\u2019s when we lived \u2014 yeah, in Binnaeusstraat, I\u2019m pretty sure. Or was it \u2014 I\nNovember 10, 2008\ndon\u2019t know which house it was in. No, I was older, it had to be Binnaeusstraat.\nThey would pull up the rug. My uncle was there, Omaya(ph), Tante and my\nparents, listening to the radio, putting up music, and they danced.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how I learned \u2014 my Omaya(ph) taught me how to dance, me standing\non his feet, and I learned how to dance the foxtrot, and the English waltz. And I\u2019m\nnow \u2014 oh, I\u2019m eight or nine or 10 or something like that, yeah.",
        "A: After the war. That was nice, but then it also \u2014 that was a nice day or something,\nbut the regular days, going to school was not nice, because I was the only Jewish\ngirl, and everybody made fun of me, you know.",
        "A: Oh yeah. So the years after were not \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, there were a lot of them that weren\u2019t.",
        "A: There\u2019s a lot of them that weren\u2019t. There were a lot of people who got turned in\nby \u2014 we were very, very fortunate. And \u2014 and Tante dealt with it very good.",
        "A: Well, they wouldn\u2019t talk to me because I looked different for some reason, I\ndon\u2019t know. And they weren\u2019t \u2014 especially the boys, they were nasty, yeah. Some of\nthe girls were okay. I have a book, they call it a poetsy(ph), it\u2019s \u2014 you ges \u2014 it\u2019s like\na poem book that all \u2014 everybody in school would get that, with little paste things,\nstick-ums that you put in there and then you write a little poem of the person that \u2014\nyou know, like you do at high school here \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they \u2014 they write \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 something like that. And I do have that book with \u2014 there were two girls that\nlived around the corner in Willem de Zwijgerstraat when I first started school. Her\nname \u2014 one was Anika(ph), and there was a little redhead, ri-wi \u2014 Rita, I think her\nname was, something like that. And they wrote in my book. But I would never want\n\u2014 went to their house, I couldn\u2019t associate with them, so only at school.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, I was very much by myself, very much. And then when my brother\nand sister came along, I had to take care of them. Now, we\u2019re nine and 11 years\ndifference. And if I wanted to go outside and did play with the marbles, you know,\nthe little children\u2019s play, I had to take my brother with me. I was always like a\ncaretaker of them, and I had to help. I never had a time, you know, by ourselves.\nLater on, we got a little older, the Jewish area built up a little bit, and there was a\nyouth group area, and that\u2019s where I met this girl named Frieda. And a lot of the\nDutch people know her too, and she knows a lot of people. And we\u2019ve been in\ntouch ever since, together. But the only nice time I had with a girlfriend, and that\nwas her, because she was Jewish, and she lived quite far away, but I had a bike\nthen, and we\u2019d bike to her. And she had little cooking utensils and we would cook\napplesauce from scratch. That was a big thing.",
        "A: Yeah, it was fun, but then, that was a day of having a nice day, but the rest of the\ntime, this \u2014 in Willem de Zwijgerstraat, the house that we were in was right on the\ncorner and there was train tracks right next to it. And several times the train would\nstop, and it was loaded with coal. So I had to go and get a \u2014 a pail and\n[indecipherable] and climb up in the train \u2014 and everybody else did that, mostly\nguys \u2014 and I had to climb up there and steal the coal, so we would have coal in the\nNovember 10, 2008\nhouse. Now, the train must have stopped there maybe for a purpose, I don\u2019t know,\nbut \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I was [indecipherable]. Not fun. I didn\u2019t have a teenage years. There was\nnothing about me, you know. Very, very little.",
        "A: You know something, I don\u2019t know any details, but I remember my two and a\nhalf years with Tante. My \u2014 the rest of my years before I came here 1s mostly what\nI remember ome \u2014 you know, ask my mother, I want to go after school, go and play\nwith them. No, you have to do this, and you have to take care of your brother and\nyou have to take care of your sister. Or you have to help me, and you have to do this\nand you have to do that. That\u2019s all I remember.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember no closeness, where my mother say, oh let\u2019s go shopping, just\nyou and I, let\u2019s go, you know. No, because my father was gone basically seven days\na week, earning a living, trying to earn a living by selling his socks and so on, on\nNovember 10, 2008\nthe mart, different cities. On the weekend, on Saturdays, I would have to go with\nhim, because you have to unpack the pack.",
        "A: No, no, there was no religion. She never benched th-the light, the candles \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] no. I\u2019ve never done it either. I do remember going to a temple,\nI do. Another thing is I remember I was being taught by a rabbi to read Hebrew.\nAnd that\u2019s when we moved to Binnaeusstraat. I was a little older, and I remember\ngoing to the temple once. But no, nothing for holidays, except Friday night we had\nchicken soup, you know, and Paula gets the \u2014 the \u2014 I got a\u2014 a polka \u2014a leg anda\nneck, that\u2019s what I got. But see, my wardrobe consists of two of this and two of that,\nand that was it. Little skirt and a little top, I don\u2019t remember my mother taking me\nshopping or anyth \u2014 I don\u2019t remember any of that.",
        "A: Because the other part overtook that, always having to take care of them, that I\njust was \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I was just there to be \u2014 for that purpose. I didn\u2019t have that closeness\nbeing the daughter, the first daughter, you know. And that\u2019s \u2014 could very well be\nbecause of what my parents went through, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s it.",
        "A: No. No. Oh, you don\u2019t know, and you don\u2019t need to know, or you don\u2019t\nremember anything, you were too young, and \u2014 nothing. So either they were\nprotecting me, I don\u2019t know why, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Right.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Right, right. So, I know that all the time I lived in Holland, I would never say\nthat I was Jewish, I would never talk to anybody about it. I tried to assimilate or be\nlike everybody else, but yet, I knew I was different, because there the fi \u2014 the girls\nat school, their \u2014 their way of doing things, the way the ate, the way they \u2014 their\nbehavior was so different than mine. I had uns \u2014 not really n \u2014 realizing it, I had this\nstuff on my shoulder of what happened to me, and I could not talk about that. So, I\nalways was different, and that took me a long, long, long time to get out of it. The\nonly time I could \u2014 finally got out of it is when I joined the survivor, the child\nsurvivors\u2019 group.",
        "A: Before that \u2014 a very long time. Not until the early 90s.",
        "A: Yes. I would not talk, I worked and I \u2014 and \u2014 and people find out, oh, you\u2019re \u2014\nyou\u2019re from Holland. Yes. Were you there during the war? Yes. Well, what\nhappened? Nothing. You know. How I'd never wear a Jewish star, I \u2014 I have o \u2014 I\nhave them, but I wouldn't wear them. I\u2019d \u2014 never the identification that I\u2019m Jewish.\nNovember 10, 2008\nAnd that only \u2014 even in America, you know, at the beginning, I wouldn\u2019t say that I\nwas \u2014 not Jewish, but in hiding.",
        "A: No, I just \u2014 I think I \u2014 I kind of talked about that, because they wound up being\nfriends and they s \u2014 you know, played cards together and \u2014 and \u2014 well, we just had a\nvery simple life, nothing exciting, it was just surviving life.",
        "A: And that was it.",
        "A: \u00b050\u2014\u201953.",
        "A: \u00b053, with my parents.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I was 15.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah. So then my Uncle Ted, who had gotten here somehow \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 from New York, he wound up in California, and he sponsored my father, for\nus to come. And so we came in *53. We took the \u2014 the \u2014 my father came in 1952, he",
        "A: To see [indecipherable] yeah, to see how it\u2019s gonna work.",
        "A: And then my parents, my mother had to sell the furniture they had. I don\u2019t know\nhow they got all this furniture back after the war, or I don\u2019t know anything about\nthat. So we came on the \u2014 we first went to Paris, her family lived in Paris, so, to\nsay goodbye. And \u2014 oh, during the \u2014 before that, when I was younger, my mother\nsent me to Paris to live \u2014 to visit my grandparents. Now, my grandparents spoke\nFrench and Yiddish, I spoke Dutch. I understand Yiddish, but I can\u2019t speak Yiddish.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: I know I spoke Dutch and I could understand Yiddish, from hearing it from\nthem, I suppose. So I \u2014 I did spend a week in Paris with my gram \u2014 grandparents,\nand we couldn\u2019t really communicate. So we went \u2014 before we left to come to\nAmerica, we went to Paris and \u2014 to say goodbye, and board the fle de France ship.\nAnd we took the ship across; took about seven days I believe. And me with motion\nsickness, that didn't work too well, but \u2014 so we got to New York. My mother\u2019s\ngirlfriend from Europe, who lived now in New York, picked us up and we stayed\nfor one day and then we caught the train to go to California.",
        "A: And we were on a train and with my little brother and my little sister and me, so\nI had to deal with that. And then we come to Los Angeles, and my uncle and my\nfather pick us up, and they drive us to this \u2014 the mountains, which is unbelievable to\nsee, huge. It was very scary, because Holland, you know, is flat. So the drive \u2014 we\ncome to this area where my uncle had a quote, a ranch, he ca \u2014 which he called the\nBar Mitzvah ranch. He had a cow, skinny than anything, and several animals, and\nNovember 10, 2008\nchickens, and that was the ranch. So we come now there, and my father had a trailer\nthere, small trailer that he was living in, and now there\u2019s four of us. No \u2014 yeah, four\nof us coming and \u2014 in that trailer.",
        "A: Of course there\u2019s no room. Paula wound up living in the house. I had a room\nthat my Tante Ted\u2019s wife, Clair, and she took me under her wing. She told me, you\ngotta get a haircut, you gotta take off these little gold earrings, they\u2019re childish and\nyou gotta grow up now. Okay. So, ti \u2014 they sent us to school, I went into the eighth\ngrade just for a few months, cause we came in March of 53. And I went to this\neighth grades class, where they assigned one of the pupils that sit next to me, to\nkind of teach me what\u2019s going on. Now, I had some English, a little knowledge,\ncause at school in Holland, the \u2014 the high school there, you learn all these\nlanguages. I learned Dutch \u2014 of course, Dutch; English; French and German. Which\nI hated. So \u2014 so, come September, we\u2019re moving now to this town called\nLancaster, California and my father now has a chicken ranch, 20,000 chickens.",
        "A: Oh, my gosh.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah. And he buys this property with a house, one bedroom. And now, you\nknow, the five of us. So, my brother, sister are small and they live \u2014 they sleep on a\ncouch that makes into a bed. That house had like a little outhouse, not a bath, but an\nouthouse there, just a \u2014 a little room, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m at. There\u2019s no heat,\nno air conditioning. They did have some light that they hooked up from the laundry\nroom, which was next to the garage. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m now. I have no \u2014 I have\nnothing of me, I\u2019m just always being outcast, you know. Okay, Paula, you do this\nPaula, that, and \u2014 and I had to work in the chicken house before school.",
        "A: Yes. And everyday before school, after school, seven days a week, I had to help\nfeed the chickens.",
        "A: And it was all manual. Eventually he wound up getting automatic feeders and\nautomatic water, but not while I was there. And \u2014 and my little brother, who\u2019s six,\nhe also had to start helping. And the school, we had to go by bus to school, and I\nhad never the opportunity to go with some of the friends, or girls at the school, to go\nto a movie, or visiting them, or spending time with \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 girls, being a teenager.",
        "A: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. When I was in Holland \u2014",
        "A: I didn't fight, because it didn\u2019t lead to anything, I still have to do what I \u2014 what I\nhad to do. I told them I didn\u2019t like it, but I had to help support, you know, the\nlivelihood. I also, across the street, there was a family there that had no children,\nand she needed somebody to clean the house. So, besides doing the chickens and all\nthat, I went there, but I loved it, because it was an American house. She had a piano,\nand I was able to do a little piano. And I, for lunch she would make me a sandwich\non this nice bread, and I got to drink a Coke. And so, I enjoyed that, that was my\nenjoyment. Yeah, I\u2019m a teenager. She\u2019d be doing so many other things, and this 1s\nwhat I was doing. So I was really kept back and I became a late bloomer.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no. I\u2014I got married right after high school.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Lancaster had the beginning of a temple in \u2014 in a house. And we did go to that,\nbecause we got to meet people there, you have a congregation. There\u2019s a woman\nthere, when she saw a new girl in the group, there was a \u2014 I think there was one \u2014\none boy there, Matt was his name, who went to high school, and I went to high\nschool there and she was going to try and fix me up. You know, in those days, you\ngot married very early. So she was trying to fix me up and she found Bernie. Shall I\ntalk about how he got to Lancaster? He was new y \u2014 he comes from New York,\nthe Bronx. He comes from a \u2014 a six kids family. And he came to visit his brother,\nwho lived in Lancaster and worked at Edwards Air Force base, Lou. And he\ncame in November of 54, got off the plane, dressed with the \u2014 it was so cold in\nNew York and he comes to California, his brother picks him up in shorts and\nsandal and hawa \u2014 a shirt, a Hawaiian shirt. He turns and he tells him \u2014 and he calls\nhis mother when he got settled, I\u2019m never coming back to New York, cause this is\nwonderful. Anyway, he gets a job in haberdashery, in men\u2019s clothing, and this lady,\nBelle Miska(ph) found him at the store, at \u2014 Herman\u2019s was the name of the store,\nand she s-says, oh, I have a girl for you. And he was 24, and now I\u2019m 17. So, she\nwound up at \u2014 in a\u2014 a meeting for her \u2014 for me and him, and so that\u2019s how we met.\nAnd I invited him to my graduation and he took me out, I had my first shrimp\ndinner. And I\u2019m 17, and I\u2019m still a little unaware of anything, I don\u2019t know a thing\nNovember 10, 2008\nthat\u2019s going on in life, I\u2019m so uck. But I got \u2014 we got engaged on my birthday in\nSeptember, and we got married in December.",
        "A: So, it was a six months togetherness, and he would come and visit us every\nSunday in the afternoon and \u2014 anyway, so I got out of that house. I could not deal\nwith it. It was either that, my Aunt Clair, who had moved away from the Bar\nMitzvah ranch to the San Fernando Valley, I was gonna go live with her and go to\ncollege, one \u2014 one way or the other. So that\u2019s how I met Bernie. And I had a whole\nnew life, and it\u2019s \u2014 then it was good, and it was good for 52 years.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Three sons.",
        "A: Martin, Danny and Joel, and I have two grandsons from Danny, and their\nnames are Aaron and Kevin, and they are now 18 and 20.",
        "A: Well, yeah, see, I got married so young, and \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: \u2014 and wanted to have a family.",
        "A: In Lancaster, later on in years, when \u2014 of course when I was married, and we\nwould visit, and somehow it\u2019s \u2014 we talked a little bit. I started to ask some questions\nof them. My mother would never talk about it.",
        "A: Yes, they were together, so I think she let him, if he did talk, you know. And he\nwould mention some names of where they were, but they went to different houses,\nbecause they got turned in. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, several times. And they ran acro \u2014 from ups \u2014 from the attic, cause they\nwere in the attics, they climbed out the window, on the roof, and ran to other\nhouses, to get back down, out in the street.",
        "A: So \u2014 yes, on one of them he told my mother to keep on running, and he wound\nup fighting with a soldier. Now, he had a billy club, and I don\u2019t know if the soldier\nhad a gun or not, because there was no shooting involved, but there was fighting,\nand the soldier hit my father on the nose with the billy club, and it was bleeding\nNovember 10, 2008\nvery heavily. And somehow, with however it went, he got away from that soldier.\nAnd were \u2014 and then they wound up at other places, but I don\u2019t know anything else.",
        "A: Of their \u2014 no, no, I have no information. And that\u2019s all he ever talked about. He\nonly talked about his heroism of fighting that soldier. But otherwise, I \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow anything else. And that\u2019s all he talked about, you know, that particular scene,\nover and over and over.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes. Even when my brother and si-sister were older, and my sister would come\nand visit my mother with her children or so on, my mother would call me and say\noh \u2014 my sister\u2019s name is Helen \u2014 Helen is here today. Now, I have three sons and \u2014\nand I\u2019m working full time. I said, oh, that\u2019s nice. And my mother would say \u2014 see,\nthat\u2019s just the conversation I remem \u2014 remember \u2014 she would say, why don\u2019t you\ncome over? And I said, well, I\u2019m busy with the kids, I\u2019m doing the wash and I have\nto go grocery shopping, all this and that. I said, why doesn\u2019t she come here and visit\nme? Well, she has one of the babies, they\u2019re sleeping, the babies are sleeping. I said,\nNovember 10, 2008\nso? You have the baby in the carriage or wherever you traveled, you know. What\ndifference does that make? My mother would always stand up for my younger\nsister. And there was never any \u2014 any close \u2014 a real closeness, there was not.",
        "A: With my brother, he had a very rough time. He had a very bad time when he was\nyoung, he had no life either. He became a stutterer.",
        "A: And he worked in the chicken ranch, how \u2014 whatever. My husband and I, Bernie\nand I would, if we would go for the day to the beach \u2014 I loved the ocean, we would\ngo to the beach, we would ask Helen, my younger sister to come along, and she\nwould come along. She did not have to work in the chicken house, she pretended\nthat she would faint. So, she\u2019s the baby \u2014",
        "A: She figured out, and she didn\u2019t work in the chicken house. So that only left my\nbrother, after I left. And we would ask, well nor \u2014 my brother\u2019s named Norman \u2014\nfor him to come and spend the day with us, and my father would always say no, he\nstays here with the chickens and those five acres, that\u2019s what the property was he\nhad, this is the place for him.",
        "A: Yes, he \u2014 he had a very \u2014 he joined the \u2014 the army right away when he was old\nenough, and \u2014 and he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s always had a problem. Also very slow, and not\nworldly, you know. That was \u2014 that was rough, yeah.",
        "A: When I came to this country, we kept writing letters. Cause before we left, you\nknow, I did say goodbye, and I think we cried. She \u2014 she re \u2014 she really cared for\nme. And so then we were in touch with letters. I could never afford to go back to\nHolland until \u2014 not until 1985. She passed away. I would get the letter with the\nblack border. First Omaya(ph) passed away, in the early 60s. And then Tante\npassed away July 31, 1975, which is the same day my mother passed away.",
        "A: Double whammy, yes. I had made an afghan, I crocheted an afghan and sent that\nto my tante. And she s-started to get ill. And then, after the funeral, whenever that,\nthen I got this letter showing her \u2014 that she died and \u2014 the same day as my mother\npassed away. So that was \u2014",
        "A: That was hard, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s very hard.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t have children.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, cause I never knew the family.",
        "A: I never found out anything. If my tante wrote something in the letter, I don\u2019t\nknow where they\u2019re at, or where it was. And in 1985, when we were able to come \u2014\ngo back, Bernie and I went \u2014 wanted to go to Holland, we stayed \u2014 we stayed in a \u2014\nin a hotel in Heeze, which is outside of Eindhoven, and I said, okay Bernie, I n \u2014 I\nknow exactly where to go to the house. My girlfriend Trix(ph) from school, I\u2019ve\nalways been in touch with her, she\u2019s not Jewish \u2014 and we always corresponded. So\nthey came to the hotel, and I told him how to go to the house in Huidenstraat also,\nbut then Trix(ph), I think, knew where that was. But Bernie and I had done that\nfirst. And I could tell him, you take this street and that street, I don\u2019t know how I\ndid that, but anyway, we got to the house in 85, and my \u2014 my friend says, Trix(ph)\nsays, oh, why don\u2019t you get out and ring the bell? Well, I was frozen in my seat, I\ncould not get out of my \u2014 the car. I started to cry and I said, but if I ring the bell, it\u2019s\n\u2014 Tante isn\u2019t there. There\u2019s other people living there. I don\u2019t want to see the way\nNovember 10, 2008\nthe house 1s for them. I want to remember the hou \u2014 how the hou \u2014 how the house\nwas for me, with Tante. So I never did go in there.",
        "A: No. But, there were the roses outside in the front, and then we drove, cause it\u2019s\nnext to a\u2014a plane, we drove around there and got to the back of the house with that\nwater and the Weeping Willows and all that, and it just phew, floods, you know,\ncomes back of memories. And that \u2014 that \u2014 that was good, that \u2014 I needed to do that.\nBut there was nobody else there that I knew, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I joined it early 90s, I don\u2019t exactly \u2014 was it \u2019\u00b092, I\u2014 I don\u2019t quite\nremember the year, but I know it was in the very early 90s.",
        "A: When I joined that group, and they had group workshops or whatever you call\nthem, and I got there and I see all these people who have gone through s \u2014 this type\nof, you know, either in camps or hiding, I was just overwhelmed, I was just shocked\nthat there\u2019s so many people. I didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah. And then I \u2014 it \u2014 the person who held that workshop was Daisy Miller. I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar, but she\u2019s \u2014 she did the whole \u2014 the conference here,\npart of it. But she was so good and she\u2019s \u2014 people are sitting there and they\u2019re\ntalking about what happened. And I don\u2019t know if I spoke the first time that I went\nor not, because I was just overwhelmed. I know Bernie stayed outside, he said he\ndidn\u2019t want to go in, so he stayed outside. And \u2014 and maybe I did say, you know,\nI\u2019m \u2014I was \u2014 they must have asked where I\u2019m from, and I said from Holland. But\nmost people were from Amsterdam, not Eindhoven, no, I haven\u2019t found anybody,\nexcept my friend Frieda. It was just unbelievable, and people were talking and all\nthat. And it just \u2014 I thought, wow. So I went often, whenever they had the meetings,\nand I started to talk. And it felt so good. It felt so good to do that, that I was getting\na little courage. And I started to f \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I started to find out a little bit about me, you know. Yeah.",
        "A: No. I really \u2014 I \u2014I didn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "A: No. I have talked and told them, my grandkids and everybody, they know. But\nthey never come to me and say, you want to talk, or ask questions. They don\u2019t. They\nNovember 10, 2008\nall feel \u2014 when you go to these groups, sometimes the subject is, are your children,\nor do your children feel that they are hindered or something, because of the mo \u2014\npar \u2014 the mother\u2019s background, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 going through the Holocaust? And I thought to myself, no. They\u2019 ve never\ntalked about it, never said, oh, because you did this, that\u2019s why you\u2019re the way you\nare, and something. So when I came home I asked them. I called them and I asked\nthem that particular question. And their response was, what are you talking about,\nMom? What? There\u2019s nothing there because of you. No, you were always okay, that\n\u2014 but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m very confused.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, no. But \u2014",
        "A: I asked them \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I asked, because I also heard so many people tell me that their children, even\ngrown up now, have a real, severe problem, so many of them have to have therapy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Not necessarily. Well, the one thing that I know when I got married with Bernie,\nwhen I was 18, he comes \u2014 well, he is, and I guess he comes from very strong\nparents who came from Russia. And growing up in New York, you have a different\nway of growing up than I did, of course, but he always told me that I should become\nmore independent and be strong. And he \u2014 he really had influenced me for that, and\nit helped. He never said, oh, you don\u2019t need to go to these meetings, that doesn\u2019t\ngonna help you, you know, and he was always there, and wanted me to do what I\nneeded to do. And he was my support, so \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah, he did. He did. I loved him very much. He was a wonderful guy. He was a\ngood father, very good husband. He was \u2014 I have a picture here of him and me for\nour 50\" anniversary. And he really made my life full and \u2014 and complete and \u2014 and\nwith no hang-ups. And I \u2014I\u2014 I\u2019m very, very blessed for that, because he \u2014 he made\nme stronger, and he made me appreciate everything and it was just \u2014 he was the\nright guy for me. I didn't have mut \u2014 much \u2014 much experience of dating other guys\nin \u2014 in Lancaster, but the ones that I dated were all flakes. And then here comes\nthis strong guy, and he had a nice brother, and very \u2014 that was a very, very good\nlife, yes. So I miss him.",
        "A: Yeah, I know, I know.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s mostly now because of Bernie not being with me\nany more, I have to be myself and \u2014 and find out who I am on my own, and I have\nthe support of my sons, and of dear friends, even Holocaust friends that I have\nacquired through the groups, and we\u2019re close, we go to movies and keep 1s \u2014\nourselves busy. Basically, I think, having gone into this whole \u2014 my whole past\nNovember 10, 2008\nhistory, has been so good to be able to unload it. Even though I\u2019ve done at the\nmeetings and so on, but on a one to one basis, I\u2019ve never done that, and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you are wonderful, you really brought it out to me and \u2014 and it\u2019s been very,\nvery \u2014 very good \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 emotional, it \u2014 very good.",
        "A: Yes.",
