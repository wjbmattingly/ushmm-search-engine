You\nknow, we were very Italian, and we decide to stay and make the best of it, never\nthinking that, you know, the wars would come.

So we knew that they would come, but we\ndidn't know what would happen at that point. So that night, you know, I called my\nmother and my father, and it was too far away to walk then. There was no\ntransportation at that point; there were only, you know, Germans going out, you know,\nlike a war in the city, impossible to walk. So I called my mother and my father, and I\nsay, \"What should I do?\" Do you think you should try to go to your sister, maybe you\nwould stay; you know, they live in an apartment, should be safe. So I went there, and I\nasked if I could stay, you know, at least overnight because maybe during the night, they\nwould decide what to do, you know, the -- if -- stay in Rome and -- you know, and fight\nor just go through. We didn't know. But I was not wanted there. They said that they\ndidn't have enough food and it would be very dangerous, you know, I was young and\nattractive, maybe, you know, some Germans would come in the house and follow me.\nSo it was near the curfew; it was 6:00, and I had to go out, much regret of my sister, but\nthere was nothing I could do about. And so I went, and that was a very terrible\nexperience because that was the end of the war; you know, you could see the defeat in\nthe soldiers' face. They were drunk; they were bleeding all over. You know, and I run,\nyou know. I stopped somebody, and I said, \"Please take me.\" You know, where I say\nplease, please don't bother me, just to reach my house. I have to do it by myself. And\nfinally, you know, I reached the convent, and I collapsed on the ground, but the nuns\ncame out, you know, and they took me inside. And I decide that I didn't want to sleep\nalone, so I had these two very dear friends; they were two old Jewish lady, and they\nwere so nice to me. And they say stay in our room, and I stayed and I spent the night\nthere. And, finally, you know, when I woke up in the morning, I could not believe it\nthat when we look out the window, we saw soldiers that they didn't look like Germans;\nin fact, they were the Americans. And then the joy exploded, you know. We ran out,\nand I was very lucky.",

So I had to follow him; it was too much for me to continue. So that influenced a\nlot because, you know, my education. Besides that, you know, I had -- I became more\nreligious, I would say, ever. You know, I don't go much to synagogue or things like\nthat, but my feelings are so deep now, I feel that I've been so honored to talk about what\nhappened to me because I have nightmares, still have nightmares, you know, of what\nhappened to -- especially to my cousin Julia who, you know, died with a husband and\ntwo small children, Carla and Needa (ph); they were only five and three years old. And\nI constantly pray for them, you know. And this kept me, you know, in my faith. All\nsisters tried to convert me; I would never, never, never, never, never. And that's very\nimportant to me. My family now, they're all married. My young one is married to a\nKorean, but he got married in the Jewish faith. My other son is married to an Irish, but\nhe has kept his faith. My other sons, you know, he kept his faith. And also if we don't\nshow, I hope that I have, you know, taught this to my children that, you know, how\nimportant it is. I don't care what's, you know, they're outside going to synagogue or\nserving, what the faith will be, and that's very important. Also, you know, I appreciate\nthe fact that this brought me to live in this country. I go often to Italy, but I could not\nlive there anymore. I feel that this country gives the opportunity, you know, to keep\nyour faith, to work. I didn't have any education, but I was able always to support\nmyself. My husband didn't leave me rich, but I was able, you know, to have all my\nchildren have their degree and their professions. And I could never have accomplished\nif I had stayed in Italy. I myself, you know, I decided office work wasn't for me, and I\ntook care of my catering and my chef work, and I been very successful. So thank God\nfor America.",

That wasn't the way to do it. We should have been active. And when they say\nnow in Israel, you know, they are too -- you know, too war-minded, things like that, I\napprove because, you know, we have to defend ourselves.

        "Q: Is there anything else you would like to share, any thoughts, any feelings you would\nlike to share?",

        "A: Well, yes, but we decide, you know, to stay in our faith; we didn't want to do\nanything of baptize or things like that. And we didn't want to leave our country. You\nknow, we were very Italian, and we decide to stay and make the best of it, never\nthinking that, you know, the wars would come. But then Jews from other countries\nstarted to come, and they used to go to our synagogue. And, in fact, one day they rang\nour bell, you know, and I opened the door, and I was very scared because this person\nbecame, you know, very nasty toward me, say that he needed help badly and that we\nwere blind not to see the danger, that we would go through the same thing. And so I\ntold my mother and my father, and they say, you know, we're giving our help to the\nsynagogue, and these people probably are exaggerating.",

And so they used to tell us a\nstory what was happening in a way.",

And we had Jewish teachers, you know; they also had to leave the university, so\nthey became our teachers. They were very skilled, and it was a very positive experience\nfor me. But then unfortunately I had to leave it because, you know, we had to hide so\nthere was --",
        "A: Only one year.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hmm.",
        "A: It was a very, very happy experience for us. We finally found, you know, our\nfriends -- Jewish friends. We had parties in the afternoon, you know, and were just\nenjoying being together.",

After they got these relation of Badoglio\nand the king and -- And so they ask for -- you know, for gold.",
        "A: The Jewish community telling us, you know, that if we would give 50 kilograms of\ngold, they will leave the Roman Jews alone, you know, and we would continue our\nlives. And so 1n 36 hours we were able to collect the 50 kilograms of gold. It was said\nthat the Pope, you know, Pacelli, had help us to fill, you know, the difference, you\nknow, but it wasn't true. We were able to do it all by ourselves. And -- but\nunfortunately, you know, they --",

        "A: Ofcourse. But we were trying, you know, to save our lives, you know. We started\nwith our lives; we had to do what they told us to do. There was no choice, so we had to\ndo it. And -- but then, you know, they went to the synagogue and actually went to the\nsynagogue, and evidently they got all our names, and they never kept their promise\nbecause on October 16th, that's -- you know, they came in each house.",

And in the morning 6:00 they\nwent all over the section of Rome called Trastevere with machine guns and -- Excuse\nme fora moment. This, you know, remembering makes me -- And we woke up, and our\nneighbor, such a nice person, she came to our door, she say, \"Run, run because the\nNazis, the SS are downstairs, and they're getting all the Jewish families, and I don't\nknow what they're going to do with them.\" So we never had the chance to get dressed;\nwe just ran out of the house. And we saw, saw the soldiers right at the corner of our\nbuilding, but we ran. We ran away and --",
        "A: I wish I brought the picture with me. But it was, you know, like a apartment house.\nAnd there were about, I would say, three or four more Jewish family. And fortunately\nthey didn't come up. I don't know why; maybe they didn't have our address or what, but\nthey just stopped right in front of our house.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And -- no. My father -- My father realized, you know, that it was dangerous for the\nmen to be in the house because they were collecting men to bring them to the war zone\nfor labor.",

        "A: So my mother took the telephone, and she thought of calling, you know, our cousin\nbecause she had told us that she would go back home. She was hiding, and she had\ndecided to go back home because the children didn't like the hotel where she was\nstaying.

I just -- I\ntried to get in touch with other of my relatives, cousins, to see where they stayed. In\nfact, I found my cousin, they were staying in a convent. So she says sleep over, you\nknow, here for tonight and then see what happens tomorrow and --",
        "A: With my parents? Yes, I could go --",
        "A: Yes, I could go there whenever I wanted, but I couldn't sleep, you know, was\nimpossible because other people -- you know, other nurse or doctors would come during\nthe night, they would, you know, find it unusual that, you know, there would be three in\na room, so I could not stay.",

        "A: Yeah. No. No. In fact, all my relatives, after we found each other, they used to tell\nme \"Could you go to my house, you know, and get me this and get me that?\" And I\nwould go and not realizing, you know, how dangerous it was because nobody would\nthink that I was Jewish.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: No, I didn't, but I needed an identification because they used to stop you in the street\nand ask you for identification. So somebody told me to go to this convent which is in the\ncenter of Rome near Piazza di Spagna. And I went there, and I met this Father Filippo;\nthat's all I remember about him, but he was very nice --",
        "A: I don't know. It's the Dominican priest, but I don't know; I don't remember the\nname. Yes. And he gave me this identification. He took my identification practically,\nand he changed the name from Funaro with an \"n\" to Fumaro with an \"m.\"",
        "A: Because Funaro 1s a very Jewish name, but Funaro could puzzle other people, you\nknow, not knowing that it had been changed so -- I don't know how safe could that be\nbut --",

And he\ncalled up one of his friend who was an architect, and he didn't have to explain much; he\nunderstood right away. And he said that he would, you know, find a place for us. They\nhad just built this place near the University of Rome for women coming out of town,\nyou know, and attending the universities. And there was brand-new building still there.\nI don't know if you've ever been in Rome --",

        "A: No, it wasn't safe because, you know, they put posters all over Rome that, you know,\nwhoever would shelter Jews would be sentenced, so --",

You know, during the occupation of the Americans some of the Italian\nFascists, you know, ran north -- or antiFascists, I should say, ran north. And so we had\nto give the apartment, you know, to them, because the way they continue the war, the\nraids, they couldn't live in Naples or in other country of the south. So our apartment\nwas occupied by this family, but our neighbor took everything, you know, our clothes\nand our valuables --",

And I\nhad already a boyfriend, so I used to go to see him if I could. And then I got into -- you\nknow, get in touch with some of the partisans; already, you know, they were formed. So\nI belonged to some kind of organization that was called a Christian, you know, for\nfreedom, something like that. And we used to ask each other, bring news from one\nplace to another and see that everybody would be sheltered, they would need food,\nthings like that.",

And also the Allied had\nlanded in Anzio, so we could hear the war advancing very closely. And we wished they\nwould come already, but I mean, while we didn't know our destiny, we didn't know if\nthey would go -- if they would keep their promise that Rome was open city or not.\nWould they destroy it? We didn't know. We didn't know what was expect. And that\nwas very scary, you know. And also we had two very bad air raids. I lived in the\nsection of Rome called San Lorenzo near the Catholic and Jewish cemetery. And seems\nlike the Germans were hiding, you know, their supplies in there. So we had two very\nbad air raids and --",

So\nevery night they used to knock at our door, is your sister feeling all right? Do you think\nshe's going to have a baby? And what. My sister said, \"I don't know what to do. Where\nshould I go?\" Well, finally my brother-in-law's family, they decide to rent an apartment\nin a very nice section of Rome with false names, making believe they also were refugees\nfrom the south.

        "A: Well, the next experience was the expectation, you know; we were hoping that the\nwar would advance, you know. But meanwhile, the partisans were getting, you know,\nvery organized in Rome. So that's when it happened, the very bad incident of Viera\nThela (ph). The partisans killed 32 Germans, SS Germans and in the reprisal, the\nGermans decided to kill 320. Yes, there were many Jews that had been, you know,\ntaken in the street, from the street, because we also had Jewish spies; you know, that\nwould point out, you know, who was Jews.",

        "A: Yes. And we didn't know what happened to him, you know. We didn't know, you\nknow. We got in touch with his brother or the sister, what happened, he has\ndisappeared. Where is he? We know that he's in jail; maybe he's in the atasse (ph).\nYou know, the atasse is where they interrogate the Jews where they did terrible things to\nthem.

So we knew that they would come, but we\ndidn't know what would happen at that point. So that night, you know, I called my\nmother and my father, and it was too far away to walk then. There was no\ntransportation at that point; there were only, you know, Germans going out, you know,\nlike a war in the city, impossible to walk. So I called my mother and my father, and I\nsay, \"What should I do?\" Do you think you should try to go to your sister, maybe you\nwould stay; you know, they live in an apartment, should be safe. So I went there, and I\nasked if I could stay, you know, at least overnight because maybe during the night, they\nwould decide what to do, you know, the -- if -- stay in Rome and -- you know, and fight\nor just go through. We didn't know. But I was not wanted there. They said that they\ndidn't have enough food and it would be very dangerous, you know, I was young and\nattractive, maybe, you know, some Germans would come in the house and follow me.\nSo it was near the curfew; it was 6:00, and I had to go out, much regret of my sister, but\nthere was nothing I could do about. And so I went, and that was a very terrible\nexperience because that was the end of the war; you know, you could see the defeat in\nthe soldiers' face. They were drunk; they were bleeding all over. You know, and I run,\nyou know. I stopped somebody, and I said, \"Please take me.\" You know, where I say\nplease, please don't bother me, just to reach my house. I have to do it by myself. And\nfinally, you know, I reached the convent, and I collapsed on the ground, but the nuns\ncame out, you know, and they took me inside. And I decide that I didn't want to sleep\nalone, so I had these two very dear friends; they were two old Jewish lady, and they\nwere so nice to me. And they say stay in our room, and I stayed and I spent the night\nthere. And, finally, you know, when I woke up in the morning, I could not believe it\nthat when we look out the window, we saw soldiers that they didn't look like Germans;\nin fact, they were the Americans. And then the joy exploded, you know. We ran out,\nand I was very lucky.",

        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Oh, we hugged and kissed and, of course, you know, the usual scenes you can see in\nthe movies, give them chewing gum and chocolate. But after we moved back to our\napartment, we were very fortunate to have the assistance of some soldiers from New\nZealand, New Zealand, who brought, you know, us lots of food from one of my father's\nclients from south Italy. So we heard, you know, that we had been starving, and they\nbrought cases of food. They were really very, very nice to us.",
        "A: No. No, I still didn't feel like I wanted to go back, you know; it was like, you know,\nit didn't belong to me anymore. I just, you know, had bad feelings, but finally, you\nknow --",
        "A: For a little bit, yes.",
        "A: Yes. We took care of the apartment, cleaned and everything. then we finally got\nback, and my father was able slowly to start his business. Then we started to find out all\nthe bad news, of course, you know, but also the good news because our friends, you\nknow, the one that had, you know, gone to other country, you know, especially to\nAmerica, they started to come back, you know. And that's how I met for the second\ntime my husband. He had left, you know, Italy in 1939. So we found each other again,\nand we were able to get married, yes.",
        "A: In 1947.",
        "A: No, I didn't. I was supposed to get married. You know, I had been, you know,\nengaged, but my boyfriend decide --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, to somebody else. I was engaged to my boyfriend that I had during the war, yes.\nAnd -- But he became volunteer. He went; you know, he followed the Allied troops,\nand he went north. So when he came back, you know, I left him and --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: The Jewish family, girls are not supposed to work which was very terrible for me. I\nlost my husband when I was very young, and I didn't learn much.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, a beautiful ceremony, yes, yes, in the temple, and our families were very\nhappy. And then I left with my husband. In one month. He came in August; in\nSeptember I got married. Then we went to live California.",
        "A: Yes, and I --",
        "A: '47.",
        "A: Yes. And I had three children in a year and a half, yes, I had twins.",
        "A: No. Then I went back to Italy. And then I went to New York where I lived 21\nyears.",
        "A: No, just to be with my mother, yes, for two years, yes.",
        "A: No, we never went back to California until recently. Yes. We went to New York.\nWe lived there 21 years; we had a very nice restaurant in New York.",
        "A: It totally changed my life.",
        "A: Well, first of all, I told you about the school that, you know, I feel the lack, you\nknow, of education. I wish I could have continue which I did. Later on I went to\nQueens College, and I continue. My brother-in-law is the head of the Department --\nItalian Department, Queens College. Maybe you have read his book, Sergio Pacifici.\nHe has written many literature books, so he -- after my husband died, he advised me to\ncontinue college to be able to teach Italian. But unfortunately, I was unable. I had four\nchildren, you know, and lost -- already engaged, you know, and there were in university.\nAnd I had a very little one; after 14 years, I had a little boy, Robert, who is now 30 years\nold. So I had to follow him; it was too much for me to continue. So that influenced a\nlot because, you know, my education. Besides that, you know, I had -- I became more\nreligious, I would say, ever. You know, I don't go much to synagogue or things like\nthat, but my feelings are so deep now, I feel that I've been so honored to talk about what\nhappened to me because I have nightmares, still have nightmares, you know, of what\nhappened to -- especially to my cousin Julia who, you know, died with a husband and\ntwo small children, Carla and Needa (ph); they were only five and three years old. And\nI constantly pray for them, you know. And this kept me, you know, in my faith. All\nsisters tried to convert me; I would never, never, never, never, never. And that's very\nimportant to me. My family now, they're all married. My young one is married to a\nKorean, but he got married in the Jewish faith. My other son is married to an Irish, but\nhe has kept his faith. My other sons, you know, he kept his faith. And also if we don't\nshow, I hope that I have, you know, taught this to my children that, you know, how\nimportant it is. I don't care what's, you know, they're outside going to synagogue or\nserving, what the faith will be, and that's very important. Also, you know, I appreciate\nthe fact that this brought me to live in this country. I go often to Italy, but I could not\nlive there anymore. I feel that this country gives the opportunity, you know, to keep\nyour faith, to work. I didn't have any education, but I was able always to support\nmyself. My husband didn't leave me rich, but I was able, you know, to have all my\nchildren have their degree and their professions. And I could never have accomplished\nif I had stayed in Italy. I myself, you know, I decided office work wasn't for me, and I\ntook care of my catering and my chef work, and I been very successful. So thank God\nfor America.",
        "A: More what?",
        "A: No. Never. Why should I? Should I? I don't know. No. I never asked for it.",
        "A: Yes. This is now lately especially it is like an obsession to me. I have to publish\nsomething about it, and I want to -- you know, my children, my grandchildren to know.",
        "A: Because they have not been, you know, so unaware what's going on in this world.\nThey have to be prepared. We were not. They came with gun, and we just went, like\nsheep. That wasn't the way to do it. We should have been active. And when they say\nnow in Israel, you know, they are too -- you know, too war-minded, things like that, I\napprove because, you know, we have to defend ourselves. We were -- You know, we\njust went; we were too innocent about it, so I want my children to be very aware of this.",
        "A: I say to friends I'm never ashamed to say I'm Jew. Sometimes I'm to lose the\nfriendship, I don't care. Yes, first thing I say I am Jew and I am, you know -- I'm very\nproud of it.",
        "A: Well, one thing, you know, I experience here they think that in Italy when --\neverybody says, \"You, you're Italian, you're Jewish? How is this possible?\" Yes, there\nwere Jews in Italy, and we went through exactly what everybody else in Germany and\nPoland that they -- you know. They were very brave, and there were very many\nimportant people; their culture was, you know, high, extended and the world should\nknow, yes, there were Jews in Italy. That's very important.",
        "A: I think that I'm very lucky to be here. It's like a dream, and it's like a miracle. I\nnever thought -- You know, I was right in the States, and I would say oh, I wish I could\ngo to the -- you know, and tell somebody about it, but I never would thought would\ncome, so I'm very grateful to Louisa that took me here.",
        "A: Thank you.\n"
