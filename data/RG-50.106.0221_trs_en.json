        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And I think alongside, the other side of the pier, was the Normandy, that had been \u2014\n\u2014 that had a fire or something. You've heard about that.",
        "Q: I've heard about the Normandy, yeah.",
        "A: And it \u2014\u2014 it was on its side at the time. It was still \u2014\u2014\u2014 I think still there when we\nwere there.",

        "A: Right. In fact, I'm going to give you an article to read. The New York Times obituary\nof Monday, August 16th, 1943, has an obituary for my grandfather, and here's the\nheadline: Abraham Pinkofsky dies at age of 104. One of 13 grandsons in war cited;\nthree other lose lives. And it tells about, there were nine \u2014\u2014 I think nine grandsons of\nhis were in the American military service.",
        "Q: Oh, my. Oh, my.",
        "A: Of which, all of us came back.",
        "Q: Wonderful.",
        "A: None of us, I think, were wounded. Three of them \u2014\u2014\u2014 the paper only mentions the\ngrandsons who were officers. One was Captain David Weiss (ph). At that time, my\ngrandfather's death, he was a chief surgeon at Fort Totten, Queens. In fact, he told me\nthat was the best year of his life, when he was there, because he had a beautiful home,\nright, at a beautiful area. It's a peninsula on there \u2014\u2014 where the East River joins the\nLong Island Sound. Another son had been an infantry captain, another grandson. And\nthey took him out of the infantry, and he never went overseas. He was assigned to, I\nthink, Camp Detrick, in Frederick, Maryland.",
        "Q: Fort Detrick. Fort Detrick.",
        "A: Yeah. It became Fort Detrick",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And the reason they took him out of the infantry was, he had a doctorate in\nbacteriology.",
        "Q: Yeah, right. Right.",
        "A: And he did research on biological warfare. In fact, I think he came down with anthrax\nhimself.",
        "Q: Oh, my gosh.",
        "A: But he survived. They were working with the bug.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Right.",
        "A: And another one, doesn't say where he was.",
        "Q: Where \u2014\u2014 let's go back to your story now. So, you took the Queen Elizabeth over.",
        "A: Right. With 20,000 other men.",
        "Q: Twenty thousand.",
        "A: You couldn't imagine how crowded it was.",
        "Q: Yeah. And where did you land?",
        "A: We landed in \u2014\u2014 I think it's called Gourock, the Port of Glasgow.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Is that correct?",
        "Q: I don't know.",
        "A: I don't know names. And we were welcomed \u2014\u2014",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 as we landed in the morning by a parade of a band of men in kilts playing\nbagpipes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was our greeting to Great Britain.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And as we paraded off, we march to the train and that took us to England.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it was a full day trip down to a place \u2014\u2014 I don't know what \u2014\u2014 where they\nstopped, but I know wherever we stopped, I had gotten sick on the train. I got land sick.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And the fellows helped me off onto a truck, and we went to a camp at a place called\nWotton\u2014under\u2014Edge.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't think you've ever heard of it.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But a very famous man came from there. Wyecliffe. You ever hear of Wyecliffe?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Wyecliffe translated the Bible to English.",
        "Q: Right. Into English, right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You're talking about April '44, right?",
        "A: April '44.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I think it took us about eight days to get there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now, the Queen Elizabeth normally would make England in about four days and five\nhours, but it took a wandering course.",
        "Q: Yes. I would imagine.",
        "A: Every trip was different.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And the ship changed course every six minutes. But the last night, as we were\napproaching the coast of England, up at Scotland, 1t was changing course every minute or\ntwo.",
        "Q: Oh, my. Oh, my.",
        "A: And people were falling out of the bunks. It was just keeling. Unbelievable. But they\ngot us there safely.",
        "Q: Yes, right. Right. So, then you were in Wyecliffe. And then what?",
        "A: We were there maybe about a week, and we went to another town, at \u2014\u2014- called\nClevedon, on the coast.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: A beautiful town. And from there, you could see Wales.",
        "Q: And now this is still before D\u2014Day; right?",
        "A: This is before D\u2014Day. In fact, that's where we were preparing for D\u2014Day.",
        "Q: And how much did you know?",
        "A: We didn't know too much.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: But \u2014\u2014",
        "Q: And you are still doing your radio work?",
        "A: Oh, yes. But we didn't know too much. We did our work, and that's all.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then we went to \u2014\u2014 from there, we're there maybe two or three weeks, we went\nto a place called Pittsfield, about 20 miles north of Bristol.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Okay.",
        "A: And we were in a camp there with \u2014\u2014 I think there was a \u2014\u2014 a PX company that\nran PXs, and also a camouflage engineer battalion. And that's where we had our last\npreparation for the invasion.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And one of the days just before the invasion \u2014\u2014 in fact, maybe a couple weeks\nbefore the invasion, we would \u2014\u2014 went training on every weapon we had in the\ncompany.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: You fired every weapon. Machine guns and rifles and submachine guns and\npistols. And suddenly, a couple of groups of men from my section were taken out.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: We didn't know where they went.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And they \u2014\u2014 and also one group that went, went with the radio truck.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: On a two\u2014and\u2014a\u2014half\u2014ton truck. It was what \u2014\u2014 a doghouse. I don't know if\nyou've ever seen them. And it was a radio, and then these were groups that were landed.\nOne of the groups in my section, we learned later, operated General Bradley's\ncommunication.",
        "Q: Oh, my. Were you in one of those groups?",
        "A: Well, I wasn't in that group.",
        "Q: No, I know. But \u2014\u2014",
        "A: They were \u2014\u2014 came from my group.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: But we had no choice. They took some men, and they left.",
        "Q: Right. Right. So, what did you do then?",
        "A: So \u2014\u2014 well, I remained in the company.",
        "Q: Right. And then?",
        "A: And those groups landed on, I think D Plus One.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: The second day.",
        "Q: Second day. Okay.",
        "A: The ones with the radios for \u2014\u2014",

        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And they were \u2014\u2014 that was \u2014\u2014\u2014 the name of their radio station was Jig Easy Sugar\nQueen, JESQ. They reported, I think, from D Plus Two on.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I didn't want to drive it because it had about six or seven forward speeds. And I\nhad never driven one. I wouldn't be accustomed. It would be ridiculous \u2014\u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 to founder around and try to figure out what to do when you're landing at a\nbeach.",

        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Which they took in the first day.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The rangers took that. We drove up the hill and stayed overnight up on top of the hill.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And then we went to a place called Colombieres.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Colombieres is on the road to Sainte\u2014Mere\u2014Eglise.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Right.",
        "A: Have you ever been there?",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Have you ever heard of Colombieres?",
        "Q: I don't think so.",
        "A: C\u2014o\u2014l\u2014o\u2014m\u2014b\u2014i\u2014e\u20141r\u2014 (sic). That was where Ist Army headQ:uarters\nwere. And we were at the Chateau De Colombieres, outside the town.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Our company was at the chateau. Most of the men lived in the field around it, and the\nofficers lived in the chateau.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And it had a moat around. It was an old chateau.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I operated a radio there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: | \u2014\u2014 that time, I was with the transmitting section of the trailer. We had one\ntransmitting \u2014\u2014 one big trailer with a transmitter, one\u2014kilowatt transmitter.",
        "Q: Did you have any mixing with the civilians or any refugees at that time?",
        "A: No. We didn't see any refugees. This was a French area. We saw French people.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: And we spoke to them.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And some of the fellows would go out and take a water can, and buy \u2014\u2014\u2014 they would\nbuy calvados from the farmers.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Do you know what calvados is?",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: But that stuff that they bought was liQ:uid fire.",
        "Q: I can imagine.",
        "A: It wasn't aged or anything.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I tried it once, and I spat it right out. I never touched it again.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "A: Well, we were there, maybe \u2014\u2014 well, trying to think. Well, while we were there, I\nwas grabbed to go to ammunition supplies going to 128. And I always used to wonder,\nwhat does 128 mean? And I finally figured it out. It was the ammunition supply point\none of the 28th Infantry Division, which was in Normandy.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And I was put in the \u2014\u2014 they had me in a tent, to take care of the shells \u2014\u2014",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 that would be used for firing leaflets.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Actually, they were shells with smoke canisters in them. They'd take out the smoke\ncanister and put in a roll of leaflets.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And I was right there in that \u2014\u2014\u2014 they gave me a pyramidal tent to sleep in above the\nground with a cot. And at night, the German planes would come over. We used to call\nthem Bed Check Charlie. And I noticed, here I am, and if any bomb comes down close\nby, I'm right near the shells, I don't stand a chance.",
        "Q: Yeah. Right. Right.",
        "A: So, I noticed where the headquarters of the camp were. That was in another\nfield. And the men had dug slit trenches, about three, four feet deep, and they have\nempty ammunition cases across the slit trench, and they cover the ammunition cases with\nthe earth that they had shoveled up as a protection.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, after a few days being in the \u2014\u2014 in the pyramidal tent, and sometimes fellows\nwere drunk going past and shooting like wild, I said, \"Eh, I am going to go dig myself a\nslit trench.\"",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Where the headquarters of the company is.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That way, I'm not right next to the ammunition.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I was there maybe about a week.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And then I went back to the company.",
        "Q: And from there, where did you go?",
        "A: From there, when we broke out of Normandy \u2014\u2014\u2014 the day before we broke out, the\nplanes were coming over in droves, without stopping, dropping bombs at the Germans in\nthe Saint\u2014Lo area.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And they broke through Saint\u2014Lo. And I drove to Saint\u2014Lo maybe the day after it\nwas taken.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And the fields were full of dead cows. Unbelievable.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And in Saint\u2014Lo \u2014\u2014\u2014 there was a church in Saint\u2014Lo.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well\u2014known church.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And right 1n the field in front of the church was a dead German. See, when an\nAmerican was killed, his body was immediately removed.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The Germans, they waited 'til they got enough Germans to collect them.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Prisoners. In fact, when I was at that field where I was next to the shells, at the end of\nthe field, there was dead German bodies all over the place that hadn't been picked\nup. And at night, I learned what the stench, smell of death is.",
        "Q: Oh, dear. Yeah.",
        "A: It permeated my clothes. It was horrible. But I wouldn't go near them. I saw them,\nand I never went there again.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Some fellows came with a truck from my company, and there were looking for\nloot. And they went to the bodies, and they picked up things, you know, food and stuff\nlike that. And then they were sick.",
        "Q: Yeah. Right.",
        "A: Stupid.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I was there. And then I went back to the company.",
        "Q: And then from Saint\u2014Lo, where did you go?",
        "A: Then we went, my section, were ordered in to a place beyond \u2014\u2014 in Brittany.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We drove past Rennes, which is the capital of Brittany, to a village called Thourie \u2014\n\u2014 Thourie. And there there had been a tremendous radio station.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: 5,500\u2014kilowatt station. And the building had been bombed by our planes. It was\nrecords. But still you could get up to the roof. And there were bombs all around. And\nwhat the Germans didn't do to damage the transmitter, they did before we got there.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But we had two \u2014\u2014 civilian engineers, Mr. Morry Peace (ph), of CBS, and Mr.\nDarcy (ph), of BBC.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: They were working on repairing it, the transmitter. I understand they did get it fixed\nafter a while.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: But I was sent \u2014\u2014 then I was taken off the transmission group \u2014\u2014",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 and sent in the studio trailer, to Rennes, in Brittany, in the capital. And I was\nthere for a number of weeks.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: With a boy by the name \u2014\u2014 fellow by the name of Dizzy Hemick (ph), who was a\nT52, but he was the best radioman in the company, and a French\u2014speaking fellow by the\nnamed of Jenot (ph). {coughing} Excuse me a minute.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: And we took \u2014\u2014- the studio unit had two tremendous record players. We had 26\u2014\ninch\u2014diameter records at \u2014\u2014\u2014 with music, French music, concert music, et cetera, that\nwe played. And we broadcast different people, French people came in. And one of the\nmen who broadcast from our unit was General Koenig, who was the commander of the\nFrench Army's fighting. And one day, we set up at the cathedral and church a broadcast\nfor General de Gaulle.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Koenig shook our hands; General de Gaulle didn't even acknowledge anything that we\nwere doing work for him.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. You actually saw him?",
        "A: I was next to him. We set up the broadcast.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: He didn't even thank us.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: In fact, he was like the man below God, maybe even above God, who knows.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I was there for a number of weeks.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. And then where did you go?",
        "A: Then, Jenot and I \u2014\u2014 in fact, we had a civilian with us who worked us with, two\ncivilians, Sheftel, man by the name of Sheftel, who later became \u2014\u2014\u2014 he was from a very\nwealthy family in New York, who became \u2014\u2014 who Scholastic Magazine. You ever\nhear of Scholastic?",
        "Q: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Anda Mr. Sullivan from BBC. And we did broadcasting there.",
        "Q: Where was this?",
        "A: From Rennes.",
        "Q: Oh, okay. You're still there.",
        "A: And we were hooked up through the transmitter \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 by wire.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Where it went to the transmitter at Thourie and was broadcast. It was Radio\nBretagne.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: I was there a number of weeks. And then Jenot and I were ordered back to the\ncompany.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Which, at that time, Paris had now been taken, had just been taken.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: It was at an old fort alongside the Versailles, across from Versailles, which I got to\nafter the war. And we were there a little time, not too long, before we were sent out to\nVerdun, the battlefield.",
        "Q: Oh, my. Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: The old World War I battlefield.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And when you drove through the country in that area, farm area, we used to say, you\ncould tell the success of the farmer by the \u2014\u2014 by the size of the manure pile in front of\nhis house.",
        "Q: Right. Right.",
        "A: I don't know if you've ever been there.",
        "Q: Did you see any \u2014\u2014 again, any refugees at all? Did you come across any of them?",
        "A: No, not at that time.",
        "Q: Not at that time.",
        "A: Not at that time.",
        "Q: Okay. So, moving along, where did you then go?",
        "A: From then, I was at Verdun for a while.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then I was assigned to another unit with a two\u2014and\u2014a\u2014half\u2014ton truck and\nthat radio broadcasting doghouse.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: The BB radio operator of that. And we were sent to \u2014\u2014 oh, I had another experience\nbefore that. I'll tell you. One time, while I was at Verdun, they wanted to send some\nleaflets to the Ist Army unit at the Spa in Belgium. And I was driving. So I drove a\nthree\u2014Quarter\u2014ton truck with leaflets. And it was right close to the front. And I drove\nup, and at one point, I skidded off the road. I think above Longwy, before a lawn, and I\njust took \u2014\u2014 I had a winch on the truck, and I just put it around the tree, a tree, and\npulled myself out, and got out to the road, and continued.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And I went past Bastogne.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And as I came to the top of the hill, suddenly there was a mud slick on the load, and I\nspun around. And my truck landed up against a tree, but, fortunately, the spare tire, spare\nwheel, was on the driver's side, and my truck was disabled, but I was all right, and I got\nsomeone to \u2014\u2014 a truck driver to pull me into Bastogne, this is before the Battle of\nBastogne. And I went to a place, and I called up my company, and they came and got me\nin a day.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But that was my experience there. After that, I was sent to the 9th Army with\nLieutenant Balthour (ph), Raymond Wilson, and Mike Arob (ph). Mike Arob was the\ntruck driver, the two\u2014and\u2014a\u2014half\u2014ton truck driver. And \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "Q: And where did you go?",
        "A: We went to \u2014\u2014 to \u2014\u2014 to Maastricht. On the way Maastricht, it was uneventful\nuntil we got near Liege, maybe about 20 or so miles from Liege we saw light lighting up\nthe entire sky. We didn't know what it was. We had heard what it was, but as we got to\n\u2014 closer to Liege, which is a major crossroads 1n the city, we noticed something\nodd: Girls passing us wouldn't wave to us and wouldn't smile. Well, we learned when\nwe got to Liege what it was all about. We got into Liege and suddenly buzz bombs, V\u2014\nls, were dropping all around.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And we were looking for a bridge to get across in the River Meuse in Belgium, and in\nFrance, it's called the River Meuse. We finally found a bridge to get across, and we went\nup to Maastricht, and that was it.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And at Maastricht, for a number of days, we lived in the building where the reporters\nlived and the sensors lived. We slept in the halls, the enlisted men. And then they sent us\nup to \u2014\u2014 up to \u2014\u2014 on top of a hill, in the village called Bamalyn (ph), top of the hill,\nthere was a hotel, and I think the 4th Mobile Radio Broadcasting Company was\nthere. And we operated a transmitter. The reporters would come up from \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "Q: And, again, you didn't see any refugees yet.",
        "A: No, we didn't see any refugees, not there.",
        "Q: And then from there, where did you go?",
        "A: We didn't see refugees until we went into Germany.",
        "Q: Let's get to that then.",
        "A: After crossing into Germany, we saw refugees all around.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I remember one city we were in, the last town we were in before we got to Die Alb,\nwhere we stopped, this place, people were breaking into stores, and the German people\nstopped us. Police started to beat them up, and we stopped them.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: We stopped them. And that was about it.",
        "Q: Did you talk to any of the refugees?",
        "A: Not really. Didn't have a chance.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Yeah. And so, then, where were you in Germany\u201d?",
        "A: In Germany\u201d",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: At first \u2014\u2014 well, we were near Die Alb for quite a while.",
        "Q: Right, um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And then we were ordered, my unit, the broadcasting unit, we were ordered to\nBremen, and there we broadcast reporters from Bremen. The war was over by then. The\nwar ended on May 8th.",
        "Q: So, this is after May 8th?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And had you gone by any camps? Had you gone past any camps when you were \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Well, I had an opportunity to go to Bergen Belsen, and I didn't want to see it.",
        "Q: Because\u201d?",
        "A: I didn't want to see the ugliness.",
        "Q: Okay. But you were, by that time, well aware of what had happened.",
        "A: I was well aware what happened.",
        "Q: To the Jews and others. Yeah. Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And that was it.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Basically, until \u2014\u2014\u2014 let me see \u2014\u2014 oh, when I was in the \u2014\u2014 something\nelse. When I was in Rennes, we had a fellow, another man working with us, a language\nman, Irving Barrinson (ph). And he \u2014\u2014 we went with him once to a Dr. Loucarlay\n(ph), in the village of Quintin, Q\u2014u\u2014i\u2014n\u2014t\u2014i\u2014n. Irving Barrinson had been a\nteacher in New York, French teacher, and before the war, he had studied at the Le Se\n(ph). And he knew the son of this Dr. Loucarlay, and he wanted to visit him.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And we visited him, Dr. Loucarlay, we visited. And Dr. Loucarlay's son had been\ntaken by the Germans. He didn't know what had happened to him exactly. No one\nknew. And we went \u2014\u2014 and this trip, too, we were invited to a liberation banQ:uet for\nBrittany. And it was the biggest meal I ever had.",
        "Q: What was your feeling when you heard the war was over?",
        "A: Oh, well, I knew it was over, ending as we moved across.",
        "Q: But, emotionally, what were your thoughts?",
        "A: I was very happy. I was interviewed twice. Once by Lieutenant Fuller \u2014\u2014 I think he\nlater became an officer in my company \u2014\u2014 on a wire recorder, and the second time,\nafter the war was ended, by Bill Downs.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Of CBS.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He wanted to get \u2014\u2014 I was the GI that he chose to interview.",
        "Q: Because were you Jewish?",
        "A: No. Because of the \u2014\u2014\u2014 they wanted to interview me on the US, on the end of the\nwar.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Nothing because I was Jewish.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "A: And that's it.",
        "Q: So, then you stayed in Europe for how long?",
        "A: I stayed in Europe \u2014\u2014 well, after we were in Bremen maybe two or three weeks, and\nwe were ordered to company to the headQ:uarter at Wiesbaden. And then, at Wiesbaden,\nI did notice one thing that was Jewish. I used to go \u2014\u2014 to where I used to go to get a\nbath, a bath house, attached to a Jewish cemetery, the Jewish cemetery of\nWiesbaden. And there were signs in it forbidding anyone from entering it.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Put up by the Army. But I didn't see any Jewish people there.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Did you talk to any Jewish refugees at all while you were there?",
        "A: No, not really.",
        "Q: Not really. Okay. And so then you came back to the United States when?",
        "A: I came back to the United States in November.",
        "Q: Of '45.",
        "A: Of '45.",
        "Q: Okay. And before I ask you some questions about your thoughts, just tell me, when\nyou came back, you went back to school, and then \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Well, I got a job teaching almost immediately.",
        "Q: Okay. And then?",
        "A: And I also went back to school to get my degree.",

        "A: I wrote up my master's paper.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And I met my wife, and we married.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And I had all the courses for a Ph.D. In fact, the head of the department of history of\nColumbia University spoke to me, he says, \"Phil, you have to take a year off from work\nand knock out your Ph.D.\"",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: In fact, I had had him as a teacher at City College.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",

        "Q: Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: Because I didn't have the time, and I had children.",
        "Q: Yeah. Right. Right. Can we now talk a little bit about what your thoughts are? First\nof all, how you feel about Germany today?",
        "A: You mean today\u201d?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I wouldn't go back to Germany, when I went to Europe of number of times since the\nwar, because of what they had been done to the Jews.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Um\u2014hum.",
        "A: And, now, I'm rather sorry that I didn't go back.",
        "Q: Um\u2014hum. Um\u2014hum. Because?",
        "A: Well, you know, there is a Jewish community in Germany again.",

        "A: And from there, at the end of training \u2014\u2014 I think it was in June, it was a three\u2014\nmonth training period.",
        "A: February, March, April, May \u2014\u2014 I think the beginning of June, a group of us, a train\nload of us, was sent to Camp Pendleton, Virginia.",
        "A: Which is just south of Virginia Beach.",
        "A: And were assigned to the 111th Infantry.",
        "A: Which had been a Pennsylvania National Guard regiment.",
        "A: And it was a combat team, stretched out along the coast.",
        "A: Well, it's twenty miles below Salisbury, Maryland.",
        "A: And they protected the area around Ocean City and Chincoteague.",
        "A: Yeah. It was the Coast Defense Team on combat duty.",
        "A: We didn't combat, but we were armed to the tee, in case something happened along\nthe coast.",
        "A: And another company was at \u2014\u2014- company was kept at \u2014\u2014 at a place six miles\nabove Cape Charles.",
        "A: Place called Oyster, Virginia.",
        "A: I was at \u2014\u2014 first, I was in the heavy weapons company. I was in the machine gun\nplatoon, heavy machine gun platoon.",
        "A: And I was in it for about three or four months.",
        "A: To do reading.",
        "A: And he liked me very much, and he gave it to me. and then he was assigned to form a\ncannon company, and he wanted me to be his company clerk.",
        "A: In fact, while I was in the company, he looked at my record, and he had me give his\norientation lectures that were historical, usually.",
        "A: At the first radio school I went to was mechanics radio school in Washington D.C.",
        "A: And that was three months. And it was really a good deal.",
        "A: Because some of the fellows went out to Kansas and some went to Altoona,\nPennsylvania. And Washington D.C. was easy to get to New York on the railroad.",
        "A: So, I was lucky there.",
        "A: I came back to the company, and I was a radioman.",
        "A: To operate the radio in a command car.",
        "A: And that was a good deal because we were our own bosses.",
        "A: And we had a command car, and we drove around many times. We had free\ntime. We had to charge the battery. And it was free \u2014\u2014 we were our own bosses.",
        "A: And then my regiment was alerted. And they took some of us \u2014\u2014 we had no choice\nin it \u2014\u2014 sending \u2014\u2014 some of us were taken and sent to Fort Monroe, to the\nChesapeake Bay sector signal operations \u2014\u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 unit.",
        "A: And from there, three of us went to the outfit that replaced the 111th Infantry, 101st\nCavalry of New York. And it was at Camp Ashby, or Thalia, it's original name.",
        "A: And I did radio operating there \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 for a number of months, I think.",
        "A: From \u2014\u2014 trying to think, I think for about three or four months.",
        "A: And then, this group, three fellows \u2014\u2014\u2014 another radioman and I and one wireman \u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 suddenly got orders to report to Camp Ritchie, Maryland.",
        "A: We didn't know anything about Camp Ritchie. We didn't know what it was.",
        "A: We were put on the night boat from \u2014\u2014\u2014 from \u2014\u2014 from Little Creek \u2014\u2014\u2014 or rather,\nthe night boat used to stop right near \u2014\u2014 right at Fort Monroe, actually.",
        "A: The night boat from Norfolk to Baltimore. And we went \u2014\u2014 took us a couple of\ndays to get to Camp Ritchie.",
        "A: And there, I was assigned to the radio platoon or \u2014\u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 technical platoon of the 2nd Mobile Radio Broadcasting Company.",
        "A: Never heard of Camp Ritchie before.",
        "A: In fact, one of the fellows was a fellow by the name of Rudy Brooks.",
        "A: He was a radioman. And another \u2014\u2014 the other fellow, I think his name was Griffin.",
        "A: Those two weren't.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. It was mainly made up of refugees from Germany.",
        "A: We had the propaganda platoon, and that was made up of the people mainly from\nGermany.",
        "A: Language people.",
        "A: Well, originally.",
        "A: A number of them were refugees. For example, Steven Heym was there. Ever heard\nthat name?",
        "A: He \u2014\u2014 there was \u2014\u2014 before World War II or during it, there was a movie by the\nname of Escape, and he had written the book.",
        "A: And after World War II, he wrote another book called Crusaders.",
        "A: It's about the company.",
        "A: And unfortunately for him, after the war ended, he went to the eastern zone of Berlin,\nmaybe he was sympathetic with the new movement. He thought it would bring wonders\nto Germany.",
        "A: Yeah. And I understand that later on he had trouble with the dictatorial setup.",
        "A: And I think he may have committed suicide.",
        "A: I'm not sure.",
        "A: We spoke to them, yes.",
        "A: Well, actually, many of them were hoi polloi. They looked down upon the technical\npeople.",
        "A: The radiomen and the printers and all that. We had \u2014\u2014 in the technical platoon, we\nhad a printing unit in the truck. We had repair trucks. And then we had broadcasting\ntrucks.",
        "A: Radio operated trucks.",
        "A: Not really. I knew what was happening. We knew what was happening.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Some were very nice, and some thought they were in another world by themselves.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, they spoke English. Most of them spoke English well. There was one who\nspoke a number of languages, and fellows used to joke about him.",
        "A: He used to say, \"I speak 11 languages, English the best.\"",
        "A: We were there maybe \u2014\u2014 not even a month when they divided the company. They\ntook a group out of the company to form the 3rd Mobile Radio Broadcast. They were the\ncadre from 3rd Mobile Radio Broadcasting Company. I remained with 2nd. And we\nwent up to Camp Sharp at Gettysburg. It's right on \u2014\u2014 it was right on the battlefield.",
        "A: In fact, Camp Sharp had originally been commanded, during World War I, by\nEisenhower.",
        "A: And after the war, you know, he moved to Gettysburg.",
        "A: In fact, someone else interviewed me who was interested in it.",
        "A: Did you hear of Beverly Eddy?",
        "A: My name was given to her.",
        "A: And she interviewed me, too.",
        "A: And I think she was a professor, I think of German. And she was at Dickinson\nCollege.",
        "A: And she's writing a book, I think, about Camp Sharp.",
        "A: I was doing my radio work, and that was where we prepared to go overseas.",
        "A: And we weren't there very long, maybe a month, month and a half.",
        "A: 1944.",
        "A: This is 1944.",
        "A: In 1944, too. I went there February 19th, '44.",
        "A: We maybe stayed at Ritchie for about three weeks.",
        "A: And then we went to Camp Sharp.",
        "A: The 2nd Mobile. We used to call \u2014\u2014\u2014 Camp Ritchie was very beautiful.",
        "A: It was very close to where the presidents go.",
        "A: You know, Camp David.",
        "A: It was at one time called Shangri\u2014La.",
        "A: Roosevelt used to go there.",
        "A: And the mountains are beautiful right there.",
        "A: And Camp Ritchie, there's a lake right in the camp.",
        "A: And they used to call it Camp Ritchie by the Lake. Beautiful location.",
        "A: I knew I was going to Europe, and from there we went to \u2014\u2014\u2014 from Camp Sharp, we\nwent back to Camp Ritchie.",
        "A: To stay a few days.",
        "A: And then we took the train from there to \u2014\u2014 to Camp Shanks, which 1s 1n, I think,\nRockland County, New York.",
        "A: There was a big camp, and that was the camp \u2014\u2014\u2014 one of the camps from which they\nsent troops to Europe.",
        "A: The other one being Camp Upton, in Long Island.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yep. We went on the Queen Elizabeth.",
        "A: Yes. We went on \u2014\u2014 I think we got on the ship that was March 30th \u2014\u2014 how\nmany days in March? Thirty or 31?",
        "A: Maybe March 30 or 31, I don't remember the date.",
        "A: We went down by train, from Camp Ritchie, down along \u2014\u2014 they had the west shore\nline of the New York central railroad at that time.",
        "A: To the docks in New Jersey and took a ferry across to the Queen Elizabeth.",
        "A: They had to set up a ferry at the pier.",
        "A: And I think alongside, the other side of the pier, was the Normandy, that had been \u2014\n\u2014 that had a fire or something. You've heard about that.",
        "A: And it \u2014\u2014 it was on its side at the time. It was still \u2014\u2014\u2014 I think still there when we\nwere there.",
        "A: Oh, we knew that.",
        "A: I was always aware of that.",
        "A: Right. In fact, I'm going to give you an article to read. The New York Times obituary\nof Monday, August 16th, 1943, has an obituary for my grandfather, and here's the\nheadline: Abraham Pinkofsky dies at age of 104. One of 13 grandsons in war cited;\nthree other lose lives. And it tells about, there were nine \u2014\u2014 I think nine grandsons of\nhis were in the American military service.",
        "A: Of which, all of us came back.",
        "A: None of us, I think, were wounded. Three of them \u2014\u2014\u2014 the paper only mentions the\ngrandsons who were officers. One was Captain David Weiss (ph). At that time, my\ngrandfather's death, he was a chief surgeon at Fort Totten, Queens. In fact, he told me\nthat was the best year of his life, when he was there, because he had a beautiful home,\nright, at a beautiful area. It's a peninsula on there \u2014\u2014 where the East River joins the\nLong Island Sound. Another son had been an infantry captain, another grandson. And\nthey took him out of the infantry, and he never went overseas. He was assigned to, I\nthink, Camp Detrick, in Frederick, Maryland.",
        "A: Yeah. It became Fort Detrick",
        "A: And the reason they took him out of the infantry was, he had a doctorate in\nbacteriology.",
        "A: And he did research on biological warfare. In fact, I think he came down with anthrax\nhimself.",
        "A: But he survived. They were working with the bug.",
        "A: And another one, doesn't say where he was.",
        "A: Right. With 20,000 other men.",
        "A: You couldn't imagine how crowded it was.",
        "A: We landed in \u2014\u2014 I think it's called Gourock, the Port of Glasgow.",
        "A: Is that correct?",
        "A: I don't know names. And we were welcomed \u2014\u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 as we landed in the morning by a parade of a band of men in kilts playing\nbagpipes.",
        "A: That was our greeting to Great Britain.",
        "A: And as we paraded off, we march to the train and that took us to England.",
        "A: And it was a full day trip down to a place \u2014\u2014 I don't know what \u2014\u2014 where they\nstopped, but I know wherever we stopped, I had gotten sick on the train. I got land sick.",
        "A: And the fellows helped me off onto a truck, and we went to a camp at a place called\nWotton\u2014under\u2014Edge.",
        "A: I don't think you've ever heard of it.",
        "A: But a very famous man came from there. Wyecliffe. You ever hear of Wyecliffe?",
        "A: Wyecliffe translated the Bible to English.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: April '44.",
        "A: I think it took us about eight days to get there.",
        "A: Now, the Queen Elizabeth normally would make England in about four days and five\nhours, but it took a wandering course.",
        "A: Every trip was different.",
        "A: And the ship changed course every six minutes. But the last night, as we were\napproaching the coast of England, up at Scotland, 1t was changing course every minute or\ntwo.",
        "A: And people were falling out of the bunks. It was just keeling. Unbelievable. But they\ngot us there safely.",
        "A: We were there maybe about a week, and we went to another town, at \u2014\u2014- called\nClevedon, on the coast.",
        "A: A beautiful town. And from there, you could see Wales.",
        "A: This is before D\u2014Day. In fact, that's where we were preparing for D\u2014Day.",
        "A: We didn't know too much.",
        "A: But \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Oh, yes. But we didn't know too much. We did our work, and that's all.",
        "A: And then we went to \u2014\u2014 from there, we're there maybe two or three weeks, we went\nto a place called Pittsfield, about 20 miles north of Bristol.",
        "A: And we were in a camp there with \u2014\u2014 I think there was a \u2014\u2014 a PX company that\nran PXs, and also a camouflage engineer battalion. And that's where we had our last\npreparation for the invasion.",
        "A: And one of the days just before the invasion \u2014\u2014 in fact, maybe a couple weeks\nbefore the invasion, we would \u2014\u2014 went training on every weapon we had in the\ncompany.",
        "A: You fired every weapon. Machine guns and rifles and submachine guns and\npistols. And suddenly, a couple of groups of men from my section were taken out.",
        "A: We didn't know where they went.",
        "A: And they \u2014\u2014 and also one group that went, went with the radio truck.",
        "A: On a two\u2014and\u2014a\u2014half\u2014ton truck. It was what \u2014\u2014 a doghouse. I don't know if\nyou've ever seen them. And it was a radio, and then these were groups that were landed.\nOne of the groups in my section, we learned later, operated General Bradley's\ncommunication.",
        "A: Well, I wasn't in that group.",
        "A: They were \u2014\u2014 came from my group.",
        "A: But we had no choice. They took some men, and they left.",
        "A: So \u2014\u2014 well, I remained in the company.",
        "A: And those groups landed on, I think D Plus One.",
        "A: The second day.",
        "A: The ones with the radios for \u2014\u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 General Bradley and also \u2014\u2014 one truck reported war correspondents.",
        "A: And they were \u2014\u2014 that was \u2014\u2014\u2014 the name of their radio station was Jig Easy Sugar\nQueen, JESQ. They reported, I think, from D Plus Two on.",
        "A: And I remained with another unit, which was a bigger broadcast unit than that one.",
        "A: Had \u2014\u2014 it had two trailers. And I could drive a small truck. I had never driven a big\ntruck. Before we landed, we were on a troop ship, and LST, Landing Ship, Tank.",
        "A: No. This is \u2014\u2014 actually, this is D Plus 20.",
        "A: We were supposed to go in much before, but there was a big storm.",
        "A: Twenty days.",
        "A: When the rest of the company went there.",
        "A: And the company commander asked me to drive the trailer truck. And I said, \"Look,\nI've never driven one of these. If you order me to, I'll try.\"",
        "A: But I didn't want to drive it because it had about six or seven forward speeds. And I\nhad never driven one. I wouldn't be accustomed. It would be ridiculous \u2014\u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 to founder around and try to figure out what to do when you're landing at a\nbeach.",
        "A: So, he had another fellow do it.",
        "A: Right. And that day, we \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Omaha.",
        "A: There were still explosions on the beach taking place.",
        "A: Mines.",
        "A: And we drove up the hill that they had to take.",
        "A: Which they took in the first day.",
        "A: The rangers took that. We drove up the hill and stayed overnight up on top of the hill.",
        "A: And then we went to a place called Colombieres.",
        "A: Colombieres is on the road to Sainte\u2014Mere\u2014Eglise.",
        "A: Have you ever been there?",
        "A: Have you ever heard of Colombieres?",
        "A: Our company was at the chateau. Most of the men lived in the field around it, and the\nofficers lived in the chateau.",
        "A: And it had a moat around. It was an old chateau.",
        "A: And I operated a radio there.",
        "A: | \u2014\u2014 that time, I was with the transmitting section of the trailer. We had one\ntransmitting \u2014\u2014 one big trailer with a transmitter, one\u2014kilowatt transmitter.",
        "A: No. We didn't see any refugees. This was a French area. We saw French people.",
        "A: And we spoke to them.",
        "A: And some of the fellows would go out and take a water can, and buy \u2014\u2014\u2014 they would\nbuy calvados from the farmers.",
        "A: Do you know what calvados is?",
        "A: It wasn't aged or anything.",
        "A: I tried it once, and I spat it right out. I never touched it again.",
        "A: Well, we were there, maybe \u2014\u2014 well, trying to think. Well, while we were there, I\nwas grabbed to go to ammunition supplies going to 128. And I always used to wonder,\nwhat does 128 mean? And I finally figured it out. It was the ammunition supply point\none of the 28th Infantry Division, which was in Normandy.",
        "A: And I was put in the \u2014\u2014 they had me in a tent, to take care of the shells \u2014\u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 that would be used for firing leaflets.",
        "A: Actually, they were shells with smoke canisters in them. They'd take out the smoke\ncanister and put in a roll of leaflets.",
        "A: And I was right there in that \u2014\u2014\u2014 they gave me a pyramidal tent to sleep in above the\nground with a cot. And at night, the German planes would come over. We used to call\nthem Bed Check Charlie. And I noticed, here I am, and if any bomb comes down close\nby, I'm right near the shells, I don't stand a chance.",
        "A: So, I noticed where the headquarters of the camp were. That was in another\nfield. And the men had dug slit trenches, about three, four feet deep, and they have\nempty ammunition cases across the slit trench, and they cover the ammunition cases with\nthe earth that they had shoveled up as a protection.",
        "A: So, after a few days being in the \u2014\u2014 in the pyramidal tent, and sometimes fellows\nwere drunk going past and shooting like wild, I said, \"Eh, I am going to go dig myself a\nslit trench.\"",
        "A: Where the headquarters of the company is.",
        "A: That way, I'm not right next to the ammunition.",
        "A: And I was there maybe about a week.",
        "A: And then I went back to the company.",
        "A: From there, when we broke out of Normandy \u2014\u2014\u2014 the day before we broke out, the\nplanes were coming over in droves, without stopping, dropping bombs at the Germans in\nthe Saint\u2014Lo area.",
        "A: And they broke through Saint\u2014Lo. And I drove to Saint\u2014Lo maybe the day after it\nwas taken.",
        "A: And the fields were full of dead cows. Unbelievable.",
        "A: And in Saint\u2014Lo \u2014\u2014\u2014 there was a church in Saint\u2014Lo.",
        "A: Well\u2014known church.",
        "A: And right 1n the field in front of the church was a dead German. See, when an\nAmerican was killed, his body was immediately removed.",
        "A: The Germans, they waited 'til they got enough Germans to collect them.",
        "A: Prisoners. In fact, when I was at that field where I was next to the shells, at the end of\nthe field, there was dead German bodies all over the place that hadn't been picked\nup. And at night, I learned what the stench, smell of death is.",
        "A: It permeated my clothes. It was horrible. But I wouldn't go near them. I saw them,\nand I never went there again.",
        "A: Some fellows came with a truck from my company, and there were looking for\nloot. And they went to the bodies, and they picked up things, you know, food and stuff\nlike that. And then they were sick.",
        "A: Stupid.",
        "A: But I was there. And then I went back to the company.",
        "A: Then we went, my section, were ordered in to a place beyond \u2014\u2014 in Brittany.",
        "A: We drove past Rennes, which is the capital of Brittany, to a village called Thourie \u2014\n\u2014 Thourie. And there there had been a tremendous radio station.",
        "A: 5,500\u2014kilowatt station. And the building had been bombed by our planes. It was\nrecords. But still you could get up to the roof. And there were bombs all around. And\nwhat the Germans didn't do to damage the transmitter, they did before we got there.",
        "A: But we had two \u2014\u2014 civilian engineers, Mr. Morry Peace (ph), of CBS, and Mr.\nDarcy (ph), of BBC.",
        "A: They were working on repairing it, the transmitter. I understand they did get it fixed\nafter a while.",
        "A: But I was sent \u2014\u2014 then I was taken off the transmission group \u2014\u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 and sent in the studio trailer, to Rennes, in Brittany, in the capital. And I was\nthere for a number of weeks.",

        "A: And we took \u2014\u2014- the studio unit had two tremendous record players. We had 26\u2014\ninch\u2014diameter records at \u2014\u2014\u2014 with music, French music, concert music, et cetera, that\nwe played. And we broadcast different people, French people came in. And one of the\nmen who broadcast from our unit was General Koenig, who was the commander of the\nFrench Army's fighting. And one day, we set up at the cathedral and church a broadcast\nfor General de Gaulle.",
        "A: Koenig shook our hands; General de Gaulle didn't even acknowledge anything that we\nwere doing work for him.",
        "A: I was next to him. We set up the broadcast.",
        "A: He didn't even thank us.",
        "A: In fact, he was like the man below God, maybe even above God, who knows.",
        "A: And I was there for a number of weeks.",
        "A: Then, Jenot and I \u2014\u2014 in fact, we had a civilian with us who worked us with, two\ncivilians, Sheftel, man by the name of Sheftel, who later became \u2014\u2014\u2014 he was from a very\nwealthy family in New York, who became \u2014\u2014 who Scholastic Magazine. You ever\nhear of Scholastic?",
        "A: Anda Mr. Sullivan from BBC. And we did broadcasting there.",
        "A: From Rennes.",
        "A: And we were hooked up through the transmitter \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "A: \u2014\u2014 by wire.",
        "A: Where it went to the transmitter at Thourie and was broadcast. It was Radio\nBretagne.",
        "A: I was there a number of weeks. And then Jenot and I were ordered back to the\ncompany.",
        "A: Which, at that time, Paris had now been taken, had just been taken.",
        "A: It was at an old fort alongside the Versailles, across from Versailles, which I got to\nafter the war. And we were there a little time, not too long, before we were sent out to\nVerdun, the battlefield.",
        "A: The old World War I battlefield.",
        "A: And when you drove through the country in that area, farm area, we used to say, you\ncould tell the success of the farmer by the \u2014\u2014 by the size of the manure pile in front of\nhis house.",
        "A: I don't know if you've ever been there.",
        "A: No, not at that time.",
        "A: Not at that time.",
        "A: From then, I was at Verdun for a while.",
        "A: And then I was assigned to another unit with a two\u2014and\u2014a\u2014half\u2014ton truck and\nthat radio broadcasting doghouse.",
        "A: The BB radio operator of that. And we were sent to \u2014\u2014 oh, I had another experience\nbefore that. I'll tell you. One time, while I was at Verdun, they wanted to send some\nleaflets to the Ist Army unit at the Spa in Belgium. And I was driving. So I drove a\nthree\u2014Quarter\u2014ton truck with leaflets. And it was right close to the front. And I drove\nup, and at one point, I skidded off the road. I think above Longwy, before a lawn, and I\njust took \u2014\u2014 I had a winch on the truck, and I just put it around the tree, a tree, and\npulled myself out, and got out to the road, and continued.",
        "A: And I went past Bastogne.",
        "A: And as I came to the top of the hill, suddenly there was a mud slick on the load, and I\nspun around. And my truck landed up against a tree, but, fortunately, the spare tire, spare\nwheel, was on the driver's side, and my truck was disabled, but I was all right, and I got\nsomeone to \u2014\u2014 a truck driver to pull me into Bastogne, this is before the Battle of\nBastogne. And I went to a place, and I called up my company, and they came and got me\nin a day.",
        "A: But that was my experience there. After that, I was sent to the 9th Army with\nLieutenant Balthour (ph), Raymond Wilson, and Mike Arob (ph). Mike Arob was the\ntruck driver, the two\u2014and\u2014a\u2014half\u2014ton truck driver. And \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "A: We went to \u2014\u2014 to \u2014\u2014 to Maastricht. On the way Maastricht, it was uneventful\nuntil we got near Liege, maybe about 20 or so miles from Liege we saw light lighting up\nthe entire sky. We didn't know what it was. We had heard what it was, but as we got to\n\u2014 closer to Liege, which is a major crossroads 1n the city, we noticed something\nodd: Girls passing us wouldn't wave to us and wouldn't smile. Well, we learned when\nwe got to Liege what it was all about. We got into Liege and suddenly buzz bombs, V\u2014\nls, were dropping all around.",
        "A: And we were looking for a bridge to get across in the River Meuse in Belgium, and in\nFrance, it's called the River Meuse. We finally found a bridge to get across, and we went\nup to Maastricht, and that was it.",
        "A: And at Maastricht, for a number of days, we lived in the building where the reporters\nlived and the sensors lived. We slept in the halls, the enlisted men. And then they sent us\nup to \u2014\u2014 up to \u2014\u2014 on top of a hill, in the village called Bamalyn (ph), top of the hill,\nthere was a hotel, and I think the 4th Mobile Radio Broadcasting Company was\nthere. And we operated a transmitter. The reporters would come up from \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "A: No, we didn't see any refugees, not there.",
        "A: We didn't see refugees until we went into Germany.",
        "A: After crossing into Germany, we saw refugees all around.",
        "A: I remember one city we were in, the last town we were in before we got to Die Alb,\nwhere we stopped, this place, people were breaking into stores, and the German people\nstopped us. Police started to beat them up, and we stopped them.",
        "A: We stopped them. And that was about it.",
        "A: Not really. Didn't have a chance.",
        "A: In Germany\u201d",

        "A: I was well aware what happened.",
        "A: And that was it.",
        "A: Basically, until \u2014\u2014\u2014 let me see \u2014\u2014 oh, when I was in the \u2014\u2014 something\nelse. When I was in Rennes, we had a fellow, another man working with us, a language\nman, Irving Barrinson (ph). And he \u2014\u2014 we went with him once to a Dr. Loucarlay\n(ph), in the village of Quintin, Q\u2014u\u2014i\u2014n\u2014t\u2014i\u2014n. Irving Barrinson had been a\nteacher in New York, French teacher, and before the war, he had studied at the Le Se\n(ph). And he knew the son of this Dr. Loucarlay, and he wanted to visit him.",
        "A: Oh, well, I knew it was over, ending as we moved across.",
        "A: I was very happy. I was interviewed twice. Once by Lieutenant Fuller \u2014\u2014 I think he\nlater became an officer in my company \u2014\u2014 on a wire recorder, and the second time,\nafter the war was ended, by Bill Downs.",
        "A: Of CBS.",
        "A: He wanted to get \u2014\u2014 I was the GI that he chose to interview.",
