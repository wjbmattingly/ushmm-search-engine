My father was a\nphysician, he was a Zionist, and he didn\u2019t look Jewish. And he had good pair \u2014\nrelation with patient. Interesting enough, my \u2014 the patient always talked to the \u2014 to\nthe \u2014 the doctors, and they told my father that Hitler is building tanks and preparing\nMarch 1, 2010\nfor war. And he make a statement and everyone thought that he is crazy, that he say\nthat Hitler is going to gas the Jews.",

And in 1933\nthey took a ship and went to Palestine to see if you can live there. And then he saw\nthat\u2019s not so terrible, and that\u2019s when he start making preparation. But the t-turning\npoint was that one day, I believe in 1935, Hitler decided Jewish phi-physician\ncannot have any more non-Jewish patient. And my father was a doctor like\n[indecipherable] where he lost a lot of his business. So that was a turning point,\nand he say, it\u2019s time to go.",

        "A: Well, doctors in Germany, they didn\u2019t wa \u2014 didn\u2019t make that kind of money like\nthey do in the United States. But we had a very nice apartment, and he had a office\nnear the harbor, because his specialty was venereal disease.",

        "A: And \u2014 yeah, and so he had to have all those sailor, which had syphilis. In those\ndays there was no penicillin to cure them. So they suffer and 1t was a booming\nbusiness, so to speak.\nMarch 1, 2010",

He say, how can I go\nback as a \u2014 as a physician, and th \u2014 my patient can be one of the [indecipherable]",

But I couldn\u2019t understand,\nhow can you go through hell, and come to Germany, and get treatment here? I\ncouldn\u2019t not under \u2014 understand it. And then also we met one Gentile from\nHamburg. And he said, oh, this building 1s caput, this one 1s caput.

        "A: It\u2019s a\u2014 now today you have only new generation, you know, so \u2014 but interesting,\nthe guy in the \u2014 in the bus, which I mention, his \u2014 his grandfather was a Nazi. And\nhe was very, very interesting about the Holocaust and what they did. And he really\n\u2014 that\u2019s why he had this job to translate, because he really wanted to have\n[indecipherable] Holocaust survivor, because he was inside, very, very disturb\nabout it.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And you say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah [indecipherable]. But I told him that. And\ninteresting, I says, the Nazi, they didn\u2019t like to hear the word Nazi. They said\nsociale \u2014 they \u2014 the Nazi didn\u2019t \u2014 Nazi \u2014",
