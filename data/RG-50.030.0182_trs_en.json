        "Q: Could you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name 1s David Pollack.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: In Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, in 1922.",
        "Q: Tell me something about your parents and the town in which you grew up please.",
        "A: My father came to Canada in 1913 from Russia. He was an indentured worker. Someone\npaid his fare across and he worked off this fee and then had a few hundred dollars and asked\nthe man who had brought him over to find a place in Canada where with $300 he could buy\na business building, room overhead where he could live and enough money left: over to\nbring in his fianc\u00e9e. They only place in Canada where that would qualify was a little village\ncalled Kenistino (ph), Saskatchewan, a village of 400 people then and I think 400 people\nnow, where there happened to be a store with a room overhead and the whole thing including\nmy mother's air fare, air fare - sea fare, was less than $300. So my brother and sister and I\nwere born and brought up in this little hamlet in northern Saskatchewan.",
        "Q: What was it like growing up in that town?",
        "A: It was very healthy. It was a simple childhood. You, you were concerned with the weather\nand wheat and trying to, my father trying to sell the merchandise that in his little tiny store.\nMost of it wasn't actually sold. Most of it was bartered because money was rare in the 30's\nwhen I remember the store. The farmers would bring in butter and eggs and cheese and furs\nand and roots so they would dig up herbs. I remember one called seneca root (ph) which you\ncould make into some kind of over-the counter drug, and my father would look at these\nthings and say they're worth such and so and then that person would take the groceries and\nmy father would send these things then on to Prince Albert which was then a city we would\ncall it of five thousand, and so the family survived and my brother and I were sent to\nUniversity of Saskatchewan and my sister when she graduated from grade 12 was sent to\nNew York to my mother's sister so that she could marry a nice Jewish boy, of which there\nwere none in Kenistino. We were the only Jewish family there.",
        "Q: What was it like to be the only Jewish family?",
        "A: Since I didn't, since I didn't know anything else it seemed perfectly normal. Everybody was\nthe only family there the only Ukrainian, the only Slavic, the only whatever. People had to\nget along. There was no fire system. There was no police system. There was a municipal\ndoctor, which meant he had an enormous territory to travel so it wasn't wise to have, to\nrevive old world animosities of religion, race, color or creed. People of course couldn't\neliminate their prejudices, but everyone tried to get along, and so while my father would tell\nme you are Jewish and you must behave and not do things that will not be right, I didn't\nreally know what that meant until I left Kenistino at age 17 to go to the University of\nSaskatchewan, which was in a city called Saskatoon, and I really have not encountered anti-\nSemitism in my life. I can't say I've never because it's impossible not to encounter, but it's\nbeen minimal, perhaps because I don't think in those terms. I guess because of my childhood,\nso I knew I was Jewish but I didn\u2019t really know what that meant and it didn't trouble me.\nAnd certainly doesn't trouble me today.\n01:04",
        "Q: You went to University. Was that: a radical change for you?",
        "A: Yes. It was a big change because this little village, Kenistino, had minimal infrastructure. It\nhad no running water. It had outdoor outhouses and in twenty below and thirty below and\nforty below, the typical prairie winters, something that I I'm glad I don't have to do to this\nday. Electricity came into Kenistino when I was in junior high. Before that we studied with\ncoal oil lamps and we, with little felt wicks, and there were no such a thing as television of\ncourse. The radios were poor. We had no newspaper. So University was an amazing change\nas the studies let alone the city of Saskatoon was a major change for me. So I spent two years\nthere and then I enlisted at age 19, just going on 20, because everybody was doing that and it\nwas, as we now would call it, 1t was a good war and of course Hitler was something that the\nthe Jewish people would talk about a lot in the prairies. I might just say a word about the\nJewish community. Since Saskatchewan is a very large province, peopled, dotted with tiny\nhamlets and towns and villages, the Jewish people would meet once a year for the high\nholidays in one village or another, by some pre-arranged system and hold the services\nwithout a rabbi but with a local cantor. And they would pray and then they'd meet in the one\nJewish woman's house\nand they'd eat and the men would talk politics and talk about Zionism and play cards and go\nhome. So although each village had one or perhaps two Jewish families, they retained a\nsense of being Jewish without having Cheders or anything. I was bar mitzvahed but it was\nrather odd. My father sent me to another village twenty-five miles away every Friday night\nto memorize my bar mitzvah ceremony. I didn't know what I was saying but I said it. My dad\nand mother cried copiously and everybody was happy and so there there was a sense of\nJewishness but it was an arms-length sense.",
        "Q: OK. You enlisted in the army when? In what year?",
        "A: I enlisted in the Air Force in 1942. I was then 20. I enlisted when I was 19 but I didn't\nactually enter until I was 20. And I spent the first year and a half in Canada. I enlisted in Air\nCrew but I washed out because I wore glasses and my coordination with a helmet on wasn't\ngood, and at that time in the early 40's, if you enlisted in Air Crew and then couldn't make it\nfor reasons of of such a nature, you were given the first option to enter this new and secret\nworld of radar. The reason was that you could advance more rapidly and it was a little bit\nmore exciting than being ground crew and just repairing air planes and doing ground duties.\nSo I was allowed, I was offered the course in basic radar and I liked it very much. My mind\nworks along lines of mathematics and I was commissioned after my eight months of of study\nand sent to an island off the west coast of Canada at the southern point of the Queen\nCharlottes. There's there's an island about the size of a city block on which the Canadian's\nauthority, military authorities, had put a radar station. From Alaska to Baca (ph), California,\nthe Canadians and Americans had interlocking circles such that the Japanese ships,\nsubmarines, and aircraft, 1f they came towards the coast, would be spotted by this radar\nsystem.\nAnd the one I was sent to was part of this interlocking grid of radar networks. And I was the\njunior of two officers. I was what is called a pilot officer. It's equivalent in the Army to 2nd\nLieutenant, and the commanding officer who was a flying officer of Ist Lieutenant's rank,\nand I were, constructed and put into operation this radar system. We had 40 young\nCanadians absolutely isolated from civilization in a rock in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\nNo women, no movies, no liquor, no nothing. Just a radar station. It wasn't, 1t wasn't exactly\nwhat I thought a war would be. Nothing every happened. The Japanese didn't come so it was\nboring and yet we we were supposed to keep these 40 young men up to operational\nefficiency at all times, when their thoughts were on other things -wine, women and song - I\nknow because I had to, I had to what is the word - read their mail to make sure that they\ndidn't pass on any secrets, but they didn't talk about radar. They talked about other more\nbasic things. Anyhow, after six months I thought you know this is ridiculous and I\nvolunteered to go overseas and so I arrived overseas and spent about a year in England\nbefore D Day. My work in England was mostly on radar-controlled anti-aircraft. We were\ntrying to shoot down the buzz bombs or the V-I bombs by radar and also of course when the\nGerman bombers would come over. And also I spent six months in the North\n01:10\nSea out of Yarmouth on what were called HSL's - high speed launches. The RAF and the\nAmerican Air Force, the Canadians were always part of the RAF or attached to the RAF,\nwould go out to bomb in the morning and afternoon and come back and there would be these\nfights over the North Sea and when one of our air craft was shot down, if someone in our\nbomber could get a fix, a coordinational fix back to the intelligence headquarters in London,\nthat person would look on a big map and see where we were anchored in our launches, and\nthen send a a message by radio - there's an aircraft down or going down in your quadrant. try\nand find it. And if it was daylight the skipper with his binoculars would would go towards\nwhere he thought the bomber might be. If it became dusk and we were getting close then it\nwould be my job to turn on the radar which had a very high frequency low scan so that we\ncould we could see into the water's edge and the job was to find these aircraft and pick up the\npilots which were very rare vintage because they were very rare commodity. They were\nbeing shot down so quickly by the Luftwaffe (ph). So for about a year I was in England\ndoing these things on the land with buzz bombs, shooting down buzz bombs, or on the sea\ntrying to find aircraft and and pilots in their lifeboats with my radar. And that was my job\nuntil D Day when - dates are a little fuzzy now in my mind - but I would say perhaps a week\nor ten days after D Day, I was asked, or not asked, I was told to go across the channel with a\nmobile radar unit to set up a mobile transmitting station as close as possible to Berlin. The\nreasoning was as follows. Radar was very primitive 45 years ago. Instead of having chips\nand the little tiny things we have today, they had huge what used to call them bottles, big\ntubes, glass tubes, and great big power packs. I mean you'd need a room this size to power\nthe transmitters in those days because they were so primitive. So inefficient. That being the\ncase the closer the radar unit was to the aircraft that they were sending their impulses to the\nmore accurate they'd be. I guess I should just explain that word impulse.",
        "Q: That's OK. I mean here we ...",
        "A: Well but it might explain what I was doing. The Americans were bombing Germany by\ndaylight with a bombsight called Norden (ph). You actually looked down and the\nbombardier controlled the airplane in the run in over the target. You looked at the target and\ntwiddled knobs and you controlled the projectory of the airplane. So the Americans would\nbomb Germany in daytime. The British and the Canadian and the Polish attached and the\n01:14:\nAustralians and the New Zeelanders attached to the RAF bombed at night. And the way they\ncould see see in quote marks the target was as follows. The heavy bombers the Blenheims\n(ph) and the Wellingtons the big bombers carrying the bombs would go out in units of I\nthink it was ten or twenty. And in between waves of the heavy bombers would one or two\naircraft that were called mosquitoes. They were made out of plywood and they flew at thirty\nthousand feet at three hundred miles an hour. They had no bombs. They had a radar set that\nyou could see and hear and from the ground we would control that navigator in the mosquito\nsuch that when he came Over for example the suburb of Berlin, we'd press a button,\nknowing~ where he was on our screen on the ground in England. He could hear and see\nwhat the signals we were, the impulses we were sending to him, and the bomb was dropped -\nnot a bomb - a thermite (ph) bomb was dropped from the mosquito on a parachute, and that~\nthermite bomb was brilliant, would, would stop \"x\" thousand feet above the ground and\nremain suspended in the air and then five minutes later this wave of ten or twenty bombers\nwould come over and bomb the thermite flare. So you had had what was called twenty-four\nhour service. The Americans bombing in day, the British bombing at night, and the radar\ncontrolling the British night bombing. And the farther you were from the aircraft that you\nwere sending the impulses to, the weaker were the impulses and the more likely you'd get\ndistortions on the screen or in the headset. So that's why they sent our mobile teams across\nthe channel after D-Day to get closer and closer to Berlin so that we could guide the night\nbombers from England on to Berlin while the Russians were coming in from the other side.\nSo I was sent with this mobile radar unit. I think we were twenty or thirty or forty people,\nwith the with the radar equipment, and we set course towards Berlin - I don't remember the\ncities. I remember Aachen - A - A- C- H- E- N. [remember Dueren (ph). I remember\nWeimar and I certainly remember Mons (ph) in Belgium where we bivouacked. And we\nwere on our way to I don't know where, when an American came towards us on a motor\ncycle, an MP I 10 guess, and I was in the lead jeep with my flight sergeant. I was all of 23\nthen. 1945. And I guess my sergeant was the same age, and this American comes up side and\nhe said you guys ever seen a concentration camp? I had heard the phrase, but I thought being\nrather ideologically simplistic - I was from the prairies. I had had two years at University and\nthen I was in the service, so I really hadn't thought about such things. I'd read whatever\nnewspapers I was given, but I thought that they were our propaganda system and their\npropaganda system, and we had stories about camps and tortures and so forth, but I hadn't\nreally given much thought. I said to the sergeant, let's see what he means by this phrase. And\nthe American said its \"x\" kilometers down the road. It's called Buchenwald. And that's how I\ncame to enter Buchenwald I think a day or half, a day or two days after it was liberated by, if\nmy memory's correct, the American 3rd Army, I think. But that's how I came to\nBuchenwald.",
        "Q: Tell me your impressions as you walked through the gates? What did you see?",
        "A: Well, there were inmates milling around. There were some soldiers. The inmates, there was a\ntriage system under way. Those who clearly were beyond any hope, or those who were dead or\nthose who were clearly beyond any hope, were, were in one part of the camp. Those that\nseemed quite in decent health, in good health, were being sent out as quickly as they could get\ntrucks to take them out And in the remainder were, were there with doctors coming in 1:0 to\nlook at them and see what they could do. I saw the piles of, of dead bodies. They were stacked\nin the way you stack beer bottles in the in the refrigerator. You know, you put the head and then\nthe bottom of the bottle, and then the front of the bottle and the rear of the bottle so that you can,\nthey'll sl.ack without rolling over. They were stacked with legs spread apart and heads put in so\nthat you could get bodies, a large number of bodies in a pile. There was a furnace with one of\nthe doors open and the remains of a body in it. There were scaffolding and piles of bones and of\ncourse the inmates themselves. I went into one building where a number of men were lying on\nlhe ground, on the floor of this building, which was very dirty with excrement. I was then\nsmoking and I had this sweet capprel (ph) cigarettes which was a British cigarette in hard paper\ncover with silver foil, and I was smoking cigarette after cigarette because the smell was, the\nstench was very strong, and one of the inmates who was lying on the ground signaled for ;I\ncigarette and I had three left and I sort of tossed them and I didn't want to get too close because I\ndidn't know about typhus or I, I didn't know about the medical side of things, and they took out\nthe three cigarettes and divided them and then they began to have a little jostling for the silver\nfoil. I guess 1t represented something of value after years of no value. It was a very, very\ndisturbing sight to, to see them wanting this little piece of paper just because 1t seemed to have\nsome value, monetary value Anyhow they would make V signs to us, and they smiled, those\nwho had strength. They, I took photographs. I took a number of photographs, which I've given\nto the Holocaust Memorial Museum, of the furnace, of the scaffolding where they would hang\npeople, of the bones, of the people stacked on the ground and being carted away in some kind of\ntruck or horse-driven carriage. I don't remember which. I remember that the men's thighs were\nso thin that you could almost put~ my hand around it, it was just bone there. The flesh had\nliterally melted away. You could put your hand around the tops of their arms. Their faces were\nthis wax, this yellow waxy face. The skin W21S drawn so tightly around the skulls that they\nalmost just: looked like, like skulls with tissue paper around them. It was a very shocking sight.\nparticularly my sergeant threw up. I didn't throw up. I guess it was because it came as such an\namazing blow you might say. I, I repeat I was ideologically very simplistic. I had never thought\nabout such things happening. They hadn't entered my my mind in Saskatchewan and in the early\nyears of the my war time activity which were very occupied with technical problems and then\ndrinking beer and going out with women. I didn't I didn't think about ideology and philosophies\nof government and the racial thesis and things like that. So it was very, it was like somebody\nhad struck me, but I, I, I wasn't as physically upset as my driver who wasn't Jewish and I guess\nit wasn't until the next day when the enormity of the thing came to me. I had a little diary that\nperiodically I'd enter things, and I entered a couple of pages, which I think I've also given to the\nMemorial li...library. But clearly it was a very mammoth and, and disturbing event to a young,\nyoung kid. A young greenhorn you might say. Greenhorn for that kind of, of thing.",
        "Q: What did you do in the camp?",
        "A: Well, I, I had to go on. I wasn't a flea agent. I had my orders to be at such and such a point at such\nand such a time, but I wanted to do something and since I only spoke English I found a prisoner\nwho spoke many languages and I said in the RCAF, Royal Canadian Air Force, attached to the\nRAF, the British Royal Air Force, officers have the right to send a little blue V mail, air gram\nletters, and when we sent them they'd go by air to where ever. Enlisted men might go by air or\nmight not go by air depending upon space, so that was a privilege that British officers had. So I\nsaid to this inmate who spoke many languages, look, I can't remain here long, and yet I'd like to\ndo something. If you will find some prisoners, some inmates who have friends or relatives around\nthe world, if you will give me the inmate's name and his friend or relative's name and address, I'll\nsend a little one paragraph, two sentence letter saying I have seen your friend or relative. He will\nsoon be at a displaced persons camp in such and such. Send him money or passports or food or\nclothing as soon as possible. That inmate lined up a number of people. I don't know how many\nbecause I did this twice, once at Buchenwald and once a week later at a DP camp that I\nsubsequently passed. And I would say I wrote between one and two dozen letters -I'm not sure on\nthe number all over the world, to Turkey, to what was then Palestine, now Israel, to England,\nseveral to the United States, one to Canada which I'll mention in a moment, simply saying I have\nseen your friend or relative names so forth. Send help to him care of DP camp - I've forgotten the\nname of the DP camp where I was told they would go - it was in Belgium as quickly as possible.\nAnd then in each case I put, my address is Flying Officer D. H. Pollack, C29272 - that was my\nnumber - RCAF overseas. You can reach me at that address. I would be interested in knowing\nwhether you have reached your friend or relative. So the whole letter was one paragraph with a\nlittle footnote. And away those letters went. And two weeks later some more went from this DP\ncamp that I visited. Some years later - I kept the names and addresses of some of them, and 25\nyears later I came across a folder with these, with some of them - oh no, I think, I'm sorry - my\nmind now is getting clear - some of them replied to me. And I kept those in a folder. That's it.\nAnd they simply said in varying degrees of, of excitement I received your note. I did contact my\nfriend or relative. Thank you very much. In varying degrees of, of, of enthusiasm and warmth and\nemotion. And I didn't do any...you know, what would one do. I, I did what I could and I and I\ndidn't I didn't want to intrude on people's lives, but twenty-five years later I came across 1 :his\nfolder and decided to write to two or three of them to say I've just found your letter to me of 1945.\nIt's now 1960 whatever, '63, '68. I'm curious to know whether the person that you told ME you\nhad located is doing all right. Something like that. And I got two or three very fascinating letters.\nOne if you'd like I'll tell you about. Evidently one of the persons, who couldn't speak English,\nsaid I have a relative in Windsor, Ontario, but I don't know his or her address. His name was\nEisenberg (ph), I now find. I wrote to the Chief of Police in Windsor, Ontario, saying I have met\na prisoner in whether it was Buchenwald or the DP camp I've forgotten. He or she, he needs help\nimmediately and doesn't know his relative's address. Could you try to locate a mister, I think it\nwas Hiam Eisenberg (ph). The constable or the Mounties, I don't know who, put a little note in\nthe Windsor newspaper and through that newspaper note, they located the relative who got in\ntouch with Mr. Eisenberg in Europe and they wrote to me from Windsor saying thank you.\nWe've, we've seen your letter from the Chief Constable of Windsor and we have made contact\nand bless you and, and that was that. Many years later I decided to write and see whether Mr.\nEisenberg was still in Windsor and low and behold, he replied, saying I have never forgotten you\nbecause first of all you were an Ally, secondly you were an officer, thirdly you were Jewish, and\nfor me this was, this was momentous. And I'm now in Windsor and I opened a little air\nconditioning store and I married in Europe and I have three Canadian children and we're doing\nwell and we're very happy. When the Holocaust Memorial Museum found out about the\nphotographs that I had taken at Buchenwald, they asked if I had other mementoes additional to\nthe photographs. And I took out these letters and sent them; including Mr. Eisenberg's and then I\nthought I should tell him I've done this, because after all 1t was a letter to me. He said of course\nyou can send them to the Museum. Then he wrote me a second letter, which I've also given to the\nMuseum saying I must tell you of an odd occurrence in Buchenwald he said. I was handy with...1\nwas working in a some kind of foundry. My number was, and he mentions his six digit number in\nthe letter, but he said when I forged the new one I put the letter P, capital P, in front of it because\nI had noticed that prisoners who had a P in front of their number were less likely to be killed than\nthose who didn't. He said I wasn't killed, and to this day I think Lt had to do with the letter P\nwhich I think meant either political or Polish. I received that letter, sent it on to the Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, and ten days ago driving from Ottawa to Washington, my wife and I get\nthese reading tapes - you put them in your car and a book 1s read to you - and this particular book\nwas about a woman who had been in Auschwitz, Dachau and a third concentration camp. And\nshe mentioned the letter P as meaning political or Polish and being sort of a talisman (ph) so what\nEisenberg had suspected as a thesis in fact was correct and so his life presumably was changed by\nthis, this quirk of fate. I called the Holocaust Memorial Museum to say I was sending them this\nfascinating letter and suggested that they write to Mr. Eisenberg to get that little ID with the letter\nP on it. On such minuscule quirks one's life depends. It's really sort of mind boggling. (Pause)\nWell, I have received letters from people in London and Turkey and in Israel. I have a beautiful\nletter from someone in Israel - two, two letters from what is now Israel, one from New Jersey,\none from the Bronx. Several from England. And I've kept them. And I think they're now all in the\ncustody of the Museum and that was the little contribution that a, that a young kid was able to\nmake to, to this Holocaust.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about the letter from Israel?",
        "A: I wonder if I could read it. I have it here. it really is a touching letter. (Sure) it goes into much\nmore detail than, than Mr. Eisenberg's about broader issues. I, I hope I can locate it. , I know I\nhave it here and it is very (pause) it is very graphic. Dear Mr. Pollack. This is from Hiam\nGrossman (ph), 48 Street, Tel Aviv. Dear Mr. Pollack. I thank you very much indeed for your\nkind letter of July 31, and I hasten to answer it as I was extremely pleased lo hear from you\nagain. I had written him in the late 50's. My sister-in-law, Mrs. Sarah , was saved from Nazi\ncaptivation after she had been thrown into the extermination railway whence the American\nliberators extracted her. In September '45 she arrived tn Israel and thanks to good medical care\nand substantial nourishment, she slowly recovered from those terrible impressions. By chance I\nlearned of the address of her son and his family whom my sister-in-law met unexpectedly for\nthe first time at the Palestine Office in Paris. Together they went to Israel where they are now\nliving in Haifa. The son is a government official and his nice little daughter Ruth is now seven\nand goes to school, So Ruth now is 25 years, later, so she's in her mid-30's. She 1s the only\nmember of the family upon whom the dreadful past did not leave any trace. My sister-in-law,\ndespite her unusual vitality and her strong desire to enjoy life, cannot forget the past and\nreconcile herself\u2019 to the loss of her dear ones. Naturally we try hard to make the last years of her\nlife pleasant and we actually often wonder where these people found the physical and the\nemotional strength to survive the sufferings they have had to undergo. Obviously only the help\nof people like yourself has encouraged them to go on and to have faith in the future. It is said in\nthe Torah, in quote marks, \"Anyone who saves a single soul, has saved the world as a whole.\"\nAnd you may be justly proud to be one of those. I am very glad that you have afforded me this\nopportunity of thanking you from the bottom of my heart in my own name and in the name of\nmy entire family for all you have done to save my sister-in-law's life to whom I am forwarding\nthis letter, your letter, so that she can write to you also. I did not get a letter from her. I was glad\nto learn that you got married in the meantime and I am wishing you and Mrs. Pollack much luck\nand happiness. It would be extremely nice to meet you both personally. You probably know that\nour small country attracts many visitors from all four corners of the globe and perhaps you will\nalso consider once to spend a short leave here. Wouldn't that have beer interesting? It is\nneedless to say we would be only too pleased to offer you hospitality. I hope to hear from you\nagain. For us the war was not terminated when the 2nd World War ended and my own grandson\nwho was seventeen was among the first victims of the war of liberation. But we feel that the\nsacrifices were not in vain, as after 2000 years of dispersal, we gained our homeland. It 1s our\nhope that our children will be granted a better world than this of today. Who would have\nbelieved in 1945 that today the Germans are again allowed to sit in the family of nations as\namong equals. With the very best wishes and greetings for yourself and Mrs. Pollack, I am very\ntruly yours, Hiam Grossman. I mean this is an example of another letter which was if have it\nhere these are copies - that that the originals here all gone to, to your library, to your Museum\nbut one here - no I don't have it. From, from (pause) Mrs. Cutler 1n, in the United States, but I, I\ndon't have it handy. Oh, oh here 1s the 1945 letter, August, so that's, that's the first one - that the\nnext on~ was some :20 twenty years later. Dear Mr. Pollack. Words fail] me to thank you for\nyour very kind letter of 17th just recetved. In the meantime we have received several letters\nfrom my sister-in-law, Mrs. Sarah as well as a cable giving us her address as quote, \"Displaced\nPersons Center, M , Belgium,\" dated 19 July '45, but as it was impossible to communicate with\nher at the above address, we sent her a cable to the quote \"Palestine Office\" unquote, in\nBrussels. So that's, that's their reply to my air gram. (Pause) Well, this is an illustration.",
        "Q: What happened, this communication obviously this has gone on for all these many years. Let us\ngo back a little and ask what happened to Flying Officer Pollack at the end of the war?",
        "A: Well, I came back from the service in 1945 and finished my final work on a Bachelor. I had, had\ntwo years when I enlisted and I took another year and a half and got a bachelor's degree from the\nUniversity of Saskatchewan, and then was given a scholarship to study at the University of\nChicago in the United States where I took my Master's and all of my Ph.D. excepting the thesis,\nand then was offered a, a, a job with the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction\nDevelopment here in Washington, and worked there for a couple of year; and then joined the\nUnited Nations Secretariat and had a thirty year career in Washington, in New York City, in\nMexico City, in Santiago, Chile, and in Geneva. Then I came back thirty years later. I married\nwhen I got the U.N. job, had three children and on taking early retirement in 1980, returned to\nOttawa, which was my wife's home, and I've been a professor at Carlton University in the School\nof International Affairs ever since.",
        "Q: What effect has all of this had on you do you think? The experience in Buchenwald, certainly\nthe correspondence afterwards.",
        "A: Well, the initial effect was very powerful, very raw and very emotional to a young kid, but I\nthink the effect on me, an odd way to put it is sort of been an intellectual one. I, all my career\nboth in the United Nations and teaching has been on how do systems work. What are ideologies\nof political systems and economic systems and how do they, how do you make them work, and\nthe fact that the Nazis were able to design a philosophy and make it work so efficiently, there\nwas based on extermination and torture and hatred and killing and superiority and inferiority of,\nof, of racial theories, the, the, the intellectual concept has stayed with me - how, how horrible it\nis and how easy it is to evolve systems that have such a blasphemous ideology and can be so\nefficiently run. This has stayed with me, so remember that my childhood was not that of a\nJewish person, that is to say we were the only Jewish family and while I knew I was Jewish I\ndidn't feel it sort of in through my chicken soup that Jewish children in a in a Jewish community\nwould feel. I knew I was Jewish but I didn't know anything whatnot. So that Buchenwald had\nthis first effect which was very raw as I say and it upset me. It just physically upset me, but\nafterwards it made me just aware of the horrors of being able to design and implement systems\nbased on, on such a concept of human life and immorality and fear and hatred and finally this,\nthis is what stays with me that Buchenwald proved that you can do it. Do it well, from that point\nof view. As a matter of fact, not; don't I don't use such emotional words when I'm teaching, but I\ndo tell students in my first class in the sessions when I teach development, the word\ndevelopment has been my life. And I say you know I, I do remember one thing. When I was a\nkid your age I say to the students, I'm, I'm fascinated how easy it was even for the Allies to take\nyoung people and put them in the same uniform, same haircut, same kind of shoes, same tie,\nand get them in a disciplined way to destroy, not with these horrible overtones of Nazis, but you\ncan bring young people together to be disciplined to destroy. It's not hard. It's not hard to teach\npeople to enjoy cutting down a big tree. But how difficult it 1s to get people to join voluntarily\nto build and to develop it, to plant trees. That thought has stayed in my mind all my life. Just\nthat the Nazis carried it to a blasphemous and obscene result, but it is so easy to take young\npeople and have them do things together in a tightly organized way, even though they, they\nwant to be different. This has always been a big , a big paradox in my mind that it's easy\nto do to do that, so Buchenwald just made me think very deeply about this paradox of\ncivilization. How we can be Dr. Jekeyl's one moment and Mr. Hyde's the next. I may just on a\nsomewhat lighter note, if you don't mind, I'd like to tell you the story of the camera that took the\npictures that that I've been talking about. in my childhood in Saskatchewan, it was quite\ncommon for teenagers to be given a rifle because we shot game, small game We would shoot\ncrows because they would eat wheat, and we\u2019d shoot gophers and bush rabbits because they'd\neat wheat. So kids had a rifle, and I had a 22, and nobody thought about it. But when I was\ncommissioned and went overseas the British gave officers in Europe, when we went across the\nchannel, gave officers side arms. We were gentlemen. We had side arms. And enlisted men,\nmen had these big rifles, 303's. On our way to as close as we could get to Weimar before\ncoming to this incident with Buchenwald, we spent a night at one of the many German guest\nhouses on the edge of the, the Black Forest. And there were these little round buildings where\npeople would rest their arms and shoot at I don't know what, game of some kind. So I asked my\nFlight Sergeant if after dinner he would come with me and help me regain my use of a of a\npowerful rifle. Because I said you know if there are Germans hiding in the which we were told\nthere were. It was the end of the war and many Germans had taken refuge, refuge in this big\nforest, being fed and protected by the civilians. If there are Germans there and if for some\nreason they decide to shoot at us, my little side arm, my little popgun, wouldn't be worth\nanything at ten yards. So I'd just like to practice again with a, with your 303, which 1s a big rifle.\nI think it was a Lee Enfield (ph). So he said OK, and after dinner we went out. It was six o'clock\nor seven o'clock. It was good light, and I took this big rifle. They, they have a recoil so you push\nthem up against your shoulder ad I put my elbow on the little window and he said you see that\ntree down there - I guess it was ten yards or whatever - see if you can hit it. So I aimed and\npressed the trigger twice, and whap, whap this these bullets - I, I hit the tree, and I turned to him\nyou know with great pride saying you know, that just shows you I hadn't forgotten. And out\nfrom behind the tree come two German officers, who had been hiding. They didn't know we\nwere there. We didn't know they were there. But they thought that we'd seen them and were\nshooting at them, and came towards us and one pulls off a dagger or a little short sword and\nhands it to the Flight Sergeant saying something in German which we assume was don't, here,\nthis is a bribe, and the other takes a little icon camera off his neck and hands it to me. Then we\ndidn't know what to do with these two guys, so we phoned and an American military policeman\ncame and took them away with great joy and I ended up with a camera. And I got film and I\nthink it's sort of fitting retribution that the pictures that I took and which are now with your\nMuseum were taken with a liberated German camera although it was humorous tn the, after the\nevent, but this, this was the way I, I got a camera to take the pictures that I did.",
        "Q: Is there anything you want to add, anything that comes back to you ?",
        "A: No, I don't think so. I hear in Canada and in the United States people saying it never happened.\nThe Holocaust never happened. The concentration camps never happened and I know they\nhappened, because I was in them albeit only for a few hours. I'm coming to the latter stages of\nmy career and life and I have been involved with development I think perhaps as, well come to\nthink of it maybe as a psychological antidote to destruction. Maybe if you think about these\nthings and you're in very formative years you've spent three or four years destroying things and\nseeing such things as Buchenwald, you, you want to build you know. You feel a compulsion to\ndevelop things, not to knock them down. The war and Buchenwald stay in my mind because I'm\nan economist and I work on the link between economic growth and social equilibrium and\npolitical stability and I wonder whether we can maintain a world in which these kinds of\noccurrences, the war and the the Buchenwalds, won't happen again. So I think that it's admirable\nthat your Holocaust Memorial Library will be a place where young people and not young\npeople can see and hear and read these things and not, not for not for emotional reasons. I've\ntried not to be emotional today. I, I haven't used my folders or my letters. As a matter of fact\nnobody even knew they existed until Hiam Bookbinder found out about them from, from one of\nthe few people who ever saw them. So my reason for being so happy to give what I have and\ntell what I have to the Museum is not an emotional reason, to arouse emotions and passions but\nto have people think about these things so they won't happen again.",
        "Q: Fair enough. Before we break I realize there's one question we didn't ask you, and that is can\nyou go back a minute to the DP camp that you were in and do you, will you tell us what you\nremember about it?",
        "A: It's less clear in my mind than Buchenwald, and I think it was briefer. What I would suggest is I\ndo believe that Mr. Eisenberg was in the DP camp because when he wrote in one letter, he, he\nrefers to me taking out my little book in the, and I think he said in the, in Belgium. So if you\nhave a chance to write to him or interview him, probably he would be better equipped to tell\nyou. I really don't remember. You know it's 1945 is what - good Lord, 45 years ago, and lots of\nother thoughts have come into my mind since then. But whoever was there it was clearly in\nreasonably good health, so that the thing wasn't so tragic. There wasn't so much pathos as there\nwas in Buchenwald where the triage system was so stark; in the these three groups of people.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: You're welcome.\nPAUSE - TECHNICNICAL CONVERSATION\nWell this was one of the furnaces. it was out of course, although I vaguely recollect seeing\nsome embers, but I may be wrong. There's a body or bones - more seen in one side than the\nother. I did all of this very hurriedly so I am afraid I don\u2019t remember more than that.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nWell these piles of bones were in various parts o~ the camp. They were also piles of shoes\nand belts and things. Someone said they'd seen teeth. But I didn't see teeth, but I, I did see\nthis pile of just bones.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nI don't know how many bodies are underneath what you are seeing there. I, I assume now\nthat there must be three or four layers and I don't know whether that's a truck or s horse 28\npulled wagon, but they were just taking the bodies away obviously as quickly as they could\nso that there wouldn't be gangrene or whatever medical problems would last (ph), but they\nwere just carted away as quickly as, as they could get Something to put them in. Just like as I\nsaid, piles of beer bottles.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nI don't know who put the wreath up. I assume it ~as some one from the U.S. Army. Could\nhave been a civilian but I don't know. The thing that is so horrible is the emaciation of the legs\nand arms and waists and of course the fact the faces all begin to look exactly alike. They just\nall look like skulls. The skin is drawn so tightly there's no fat or flesh anymore. They're just,\nthey're just gone. They just evaporated. They're just tossed there. And you'll see how they're\npiled on top of each other so as to get the maximum number in a short, in a minimum amount\nof space. A really macabre sight. I - and it was all over the place too. Were not just there but\nall over the place.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nWell, it's 45 years ago and as I mentioned I was just 23 years old, but they all looked so\npathetic. There were just piles and piles and even the clothing - you see the striped pajamas -\nthat they didn't all have that typical garb. They all looked so sad. They were these, you\ncouldn't, they weren't human beings. They, they didn't look like people. They just looked like\nstacks of waxy things, and they just were, just rows of them.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nI think I had in the photographs somewhere the - I should have mentioned this and I\ndidn't - the lamp.\nEnd of Tape #1\nConclusion of Interview\n"

    "answers": [
        "A: My name 1s David Pollack.",
        "A: In Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, in 1922.",
        "A: My father came to Canada in 1913 from Russia. He was an indentured worker. Someone\npaid his fare across and he worked off this fee and then had a few hundred dollars and asked\nthe man who had brought him over to find a place in Canada where with $300 he could buy\na business building, room overhead where he could live and enough money left: over to\nbring in his fianc\u00e9e. They only place in Canada where that would qualify was a little village\ncalled Kenistino (ph), Saskatchewan, a village of 400 people then and I think 400 people\nnow, where there happened to be a store with a room overhead and the whole thing including\nmy mother's air fare, air fare - sea fare, was less than $300. So my brother and sister and I\nwere born and brought up in this little hamlet in northern Saskatchewan.",
        "A: It was very healthy. It was a simple childhood. You, you were concerned with the weather\nand wheat and trying to, my father trying to sell the merchandise that in his little tiny store.\nMost of it wasn't actually sold. Most of it was bartered because money was rare in the 30's\nwhen I remember the store. The farmers would bring in butter and eggs and cheese and furs\nand and roots so they would dig up herbs. I remember one called seneca root (ph) which you\ncould make into some kind of over-the counter drug, and my father would look at these\nthings and say they're worth such and so and then that person would take the groceries and\nmy father would send these things then on to Prince Albert which was then a city we would\ncall it of five thousand, and so the family survived and my brother and I were sent to\nUniversity of Saskatchewan and my sister when she graduated from grade 12 was sent to\nNew York to my mother's sister so that she could marry a nice Jewish boy, of which there\nwere none in Kenistino. We were the only Jewish family there.",
        "A: Since I didn't, since I didn't know anything else it seemed perfectly normal. Everybody was\nthe only family there the only Ukrainian, the only Slavic, the only whatever. People had to\nget along. There was no fire system. There was no police system. There was a municipal\ndoctor, which meant he had an enormous territory to travel so it wasn't wise to have, to\nrevive old world animosities of religion, race, color or creed. People of course couldn't\neliminate their prejudices, but everyone tried to get along, and so while my father would tell\nme you are Jewish and you must behave and not do things that will not be right, I didn't\nreally know what that meant until I left Kenistino at age 17 to go to the University of\nSaskatchewan, which was in a city called Saskatoon, and I really have not encountered anti-\nSemitism in my life. I can't say I've never because it's impossible not to encounter, but it's\nbeen minimal, perhaps because I don't think in those terms. I guess because of my childhood,\nso I knew I was Jewish but I didn\u2019t really know what that meant and it didn't trouble me.\nAnd certainly doesn't trouble me today.\n01:04",
        "A: Yes. It was a big change because this little village, Kenistino, had minimal infrastructure. It\nhad no running water. It had outdoor outhouses and in twenty below and thirty below and\nforty below, the typical prairie winters, something that I I'm glad I don't have to do to this\nday. Electricity came into Kenistino when I was in junior high. Before that we studied with\ncoal oil lamps and we, with little felt wicks, and there were no such a thing as television of\ncourse. The radios were poor. We had no newspaper. So University was an amazing change\nas the studies let alone the city of Saskatoon was a major change for me. So I spent two years\nthere and then I enlisted at age 19, just going on 20, because everybody was doing that and it\nwas, as we now would call it, 1t was a good war and of course Hitler was something that the\nthe Jewish people would talk about a lot in the prairies. I might just say a word about the\nJewish community. Since Saskatchewan is a very large province, peopled, dotted with tiny\nhamlets and towns and villages, the Jewish people would meet once a year for the high\nholidays in one village or another, by some pre-arranged system and hold the services\nwithout a rabbi but with a local cantor. And they would pray and then they'd meet in the one\nJewish woman's house\nand they'd eat and the men would talk politics and talk about Zionism and play cards and go\nhome. So although each village had one or perhaps two Jewish families, they retained a\nsense of being Jewish without having Cheders or anything. I was bar mitzvahed but it was\nrather odd. My father sent me to another village twenty-five miles away every Friday night\nto memorize my bar mitzvah ceremony. I didn't know what I was saying but I said it. My dad\nand mother cried copiously and everybody was happy and so there there was a sense of\nJewishness but it was an arms-length sense.",
        "A: I enlisted in the Air Force in 1942. I was then 20. I enlisted when I was 19 but I didn't\nactually enter until I was 20. And I spent the first year and a half in Canada. I enlisted in Air\nCrew but I washed out because I wore glasses and my coordination with a helmet on wasn't\ngood, and at that time in the early 40's, if you enlisted in Air Crew and then couldn't make it\nfor reasons of of such a nature, you were given the first option to enter this new and secret\nworld of radar. The reason was that you could advance more rapidly and it was a little bit\nmore exciting than being ground crew and just repairing air planes and doing ground duties.\nSo I was allowed, I was offered the course in basic radar and I liked it very much. My mind\nworks along lines of mathematics and I was commissioned after my eight months of of study\nand sent to an island off the west coast of Canada at the southern point of the Queen\nCharlottes. There's there's an island about the size of a city block on which the Canadian's\nauthority, military authorities, had put a radar station. From Alaska to Baca (ph), California,\nthe Canadians and Americans had interlocking circles such that the Japanese ships,\nsubmarines, and aircraft, 1f they came towards the coast, would be spotted by this radar\nsystem.\nAnd the one I was sent to was part of this interlocking grid of radar networks. And I was the\njunior of two officers. I was what is called a pilot officer. It's equivalent in the Army to 2nd\nLieutenant, and the commanding officer who was a flying officer of Ist Lieutenant's rank,\nand I were, constructed and put into operation this radar system. We had 40 young\nCanadians absolutely isolated from civilization in a rock in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\nNo women, no movies, no liquor, no nothing. Just a radar station. It wasn't, 1t wasn't exactly\nwhat I thought a war would be. Nothing every happened. The Japanese didn't come so it was\nboring and yet we we were supposed to keep these 40 young men up to operational\nefficiency at all times, when their thoughts were on other things -wine, women and song - I\nknow because I had to, I had to what is the word - read their mail to make sure that they\ndidn't pass on any secrets, but they didn't talk about radar. They talked about other more\nbasic things. Anyhow, after six months I thought you know this is ridiculous and I\nvolunteered to go overseas and so I arrived overseas and spent about a year in England\nbefore D Day. My work in England was mostly on radar-controlled anti-aircraft. We were\ntrying to shoot down the buzz bombs or the V-I bombs by radar and also of course when the\nGerman bombers would come over. And also I spent six months in the North\n01:10\nSea out of Yarmouth on what were called HSL's - high speed launches. The RAF and the\nAmerican Air Force, the Canadians were always part of the RAF or attached to the RAF,\nwould go out to bomb in the morning and afternoon and come back and there would be these\nfights over the North Sea and when one of our air craft was shot down, if someone in our\nbomber could get a fix, a coordinational fix back to the intelligence headquarters in London,\nthat person would look on a big map and see where we were anchored in our launches, and\nthen send a a message by radio - there's an aircraft down or going down in your quadrant. try\nand find it. And if it was daylight the skipper with his binoculars would would go towards\nwhere he thought the bomber might be. If it became dusk and we were getting close then it\nwould be my job to turn on the radar which had a very high frequency low scan so that we\ncould we could see into the water's edge and the job was to find these aircraft and pick up the\npilots which were very rare vintage because they were very rare commodity. They were\nbeing shot down so quickly by the Luftwaffe (ph). So for about a year I was in England\ndoing these things on the land with buzz bombs, shooting down buzz bombs, or on the sea\ntrying to find aircraft and and pilots in their lifeboats with my radar. And that was my job\nuntil D Day when - dates are a little fuzzy now in my mind - but I would say perhaps a week\nor ten days after D Day, I was asked, or not asked, I was told to go across the channel with a\nmobile radar unit to set up a mobile transmitting station as close as possible to Berlin. The\nreasoning was as follows. Radar was very primitive 45 years ago. Instead of having chips\nand the little tiny things we have today, they had huge what used to call them bottles, big\ntubes, glass tubes, and great big power packs. I mean you'd need a room this size to power\nthe transmitters in those days because they were so primitive. So inefficient. That being the\ncase the closer the radar unit was to the aircraft that they were sending their impulses to the\nmore accurate they'd be. I guess I should just explain that word impulse.",
        "A: Well but it might explain what I was doing. The Americans were bombing Germany by\ndaylight with a bombsight called Norden (ph). You actually looked down and the\nbombardier controlled the airplane in the run in over the target. You looked at the target and\ntwiddled knobs and you controlled the projectory of the airplane. So the Americans would\nbomb Germany in daytime. The British and the Canadian and the Polish attached and the\n01:14:\nAustralians and the New Zeelanders attached to the RAF bombed at night. And the way they\ncould see see in quote marks the target was as follows. The heavy bombers the Blenheims\n(ph) and the Wellingtons the big bombers carrying the bombs would go out in units of I\nthink it was ten or twenty. And in between waves of the heavy bombers would one or two\naircraft that were called mosquitoes. They were made out of plywood and they flew at thirty\nthousand feet at three hundred miles an hour. They had no bombs. They had a radar set that\nyou could see and hear and from the ground we would control that navigator in the mosquito\nsuch that when he came Over for example the suburb of Berlin, we'd press a button,\nknowing~ where he was on our screen on the ground in England. He could hear and see\nwhat the signals we were, the impulses we were sending to him, and the bomb was dropped -\nnot a bomb - a thermite (ph) bomb was dropped from the mosquito on a parachute, and that~\nthermite bomb was brilliant, would, would stop \"x\" thousand feet above the ground and\nremain suspended in the air and then five minutes later this wave of ten or twenty bombers\nwould come over and bomb the thermite flare. So you had had what was called twenty-four\nhour service. The Americans bombing in day, the British bombing at night, and the radar\ncontrolling the British night bombing. And the farther you were from the aircraft that you\nwere sending the impulses to, the weaker were the impulses and the more likely you'd get\ndistortions on the screen or in the headset. So that's why they sent our mobile teams across\nthe channel after D-Day to get closer and closer to Berlin so that we could guide the night\nbombers from England on to Berlin while the Russians were coming in from the other side.\nSo I was sent with this mobile radar unit. I think we were twenty or thirty or forty people,\nwith the with the radar equipment, and we set course towards Berlin - I don't remember the\ncities. I remember Aachen - A - A- C- H- E- N. [remember Dueren (ph). I remember\nWeimar and I certainly remember Mons (ph) in Belgium where we bivouacked. And we\nwere on our way to I don't know where, when an American came towards us on a motor\ncycle, an MP I 10 guess, and I was in the lead jeep with my flight sergeant. I was all of 23\nthen. 1945. And I guess my sergeant was the same age, and this American comes up side and\nhe said you guys ever seen a concentration camp? I had heard the phrase, but I thought being\nrather ideologically simplistic - I was from the prairies. I had had two years at University and\nthen I was in the service, so I really hadn't thought about such things. I'd read whatever\nnewspapers I was given, but I thought that they were our propaganda system and their\npropaganda system, and we had stories about camps and tortures and so forth, but I hadn't\nreally given much thought. I said to the sergeant, let's see what he means by this phrase. And\nthe American said its \"x\" kilometers down the road. It's called Buchenwald. And that's how I\ncame to enter Buchenwald I think a day or half, a day or two days after it was liberated by, if\nmy memory's correct, the American 3rd Army, I think. But that's how I came to\nBuchenwald.",
        "A: Well, there were inmates milling around. There were some soldiers. The inmates, there was a\ntriage system under way. Those who clearly were beyond any hope, or those who were dead or\nthose who were clearly beyond any hope, were, were in one part of the camp. Those that\nseemed quite in decent health, in good health, were being sent out as quickly as they could get\ntrucks to take them out And in the remainder were, were there with doctors coming in 1:0 to\nlook at them and see what they could do. I saw the piles of, of dead bodies. They were stacked\nin the way you stack beer bottles in the in the refrigerator. You know, you put the head and then\nthe bottom of the bottle, and then the front of the bottle and the rear of the bottle so that you can,\nthey'll sl.ack without rolling over. They were stacked with legs spread apart and heads put in so\nthat you could get bodies, a large number of bodies in a pile. There was a furnace with one of\nthe doors open and the remains of a body in it. There were scaffolding and piles of bones and of\ncourse the inmates themselves. I went into one building where a number of men were lying on\nlhe ground, on the floor of this building, which was very dirty with excrement. I was then\nsmoking and I had this sweet capprel (ph) cigarettes which was a British cigarette in hard paper\ncover with silver foil, and I was smoking cigarette after cigarette because the smell was, the\nstench was very strong, and one of the inmates who was lying on the ground signaled for ;I\ncigarette and I had three left and I sort of tossed them and I didn't want to get too close because I\ndidn't know about typhus or I, I didn't know about the medical side of things, and they took out\nthe three cigarettes and divided them and then they began to have a little jostling for the silver\nfoil. I guess 1t represented something of value after years of no value. It was a very, very\ndisturbing sight to, to see them wanting this little piece of paper just because 1t seemed to have\nsome value, monetary value Anyhow they would make V signs to us, and they smiled, those\nwho had strength. They, I took photographs. I took a number of photographs, which I've given\nto the Holocaust Memorial Museum, of the furnace, of the scaffolding where they would hang\npeople, of the bones, of the people stacked on the ground and being carted away in some kind of\ntruck or horse-driven carriage. I don't remember which. I remember that the men's thighs were\nso thin that you could almost put~ my hand around it, it was just bone there. The flesh had\nliterally melted away. You could put your hand around the tops of their arms. Their faces were\nthis wax, this yellow waxy face. The skin W21S drawn so tightly around the skulls that they\nalmost just: looked like, like skulls with tissue paper around them. It was a very shocking sight.\nparticularly my sergeant threw up. I didn't throw up. I guess it was because it came as such an\namazing blow you might say. I, I repeat I was ideologically very simplistic. I had never thought\nabout such things happening. They hadn't entered my my mind in Saskatchewan and in the early\nyears of the my war time activity which were very occupied with technical problems and then\ndrinking beer and going out with women. I didn't I didn't think about ideology and philosophies\nof government and the racial thesis and things like that. So it was very, it was like somebody\nhad struck me, but I, I, I wasn't as physically upset as my driver who wasn't Jewish and I guess\nit wasn't until the next day when the enormity of the thing came to me. I had a little diary that\nperiodically I'd enter things, and I entered a couple of pages, which I think I've also given to the\nMemorial li...library. But clearly it was a very mammoth and, and disturbing event to a young,\nyoung kid. A young greenhorn you might say. Greenhorn for that kind of, of thing.",
        "A: Well, I, I had to go on. I wasn't a flea agent. I had my orders to be at such and such a point at such\nand such a time, but I wanted to do something and since I only spoke English I found a prisoner\nwho spoke many languages and I said in the RCAF, Royal Canadian Air Force, attached to the\nRAF, the British Royal Air Force, officers have the right to send a little blue V mail, air gram\nletters, and when we sent them they'd go by air to where ever. Enlisted men might go by air or\nmight not go by air depending upon space, so that was a privilege that British officers had. So I\nsaid to this inmate who spoke many languages, look, I can't remain here long, and yet I'd like to\ndo something. If you will find some prisoners, some inmates who have friends or relatives around\nthe world, if you will give me the inmate's name and his friend or relative's name and address, I'll\nsend a little one paragraph, two sentence letter saying I have seen your friend or relative. He will\nsoon be at a displaced persons camp in such and such. Send him money or passports or food or\nclothing as soon as possible. That inmate lined up a number of people. I don't know how many\nbecause I did this twice, once at Buchenwald and once a week later at a DP camp that I\nsubsequently passed. And I would say I wrote between one and two dozen letters -I'm not sure on\nthe number all over the world, to Turkey, to what was then Palestine, now Israel, to England,\nseveral to the United States, one to Canada which I'll mention in a moment, simply saying I have\nseen your friend or relative names so forth. Send help to him care of DP camp - I've forgotten the\nname of the DP camp where I was told they would go - it was in Belgium as quickly as possible.\nAnd then in each case I put, my address is Flying Officer D. H. Pollack, C29272 - that was my\nnumber - RCAF overseas. You can reach me at that address. I would be interested in knowing\nwhether you have reached your friend or relative. So the whole letter was one paragraph with a\nlittle footnote. And away those letters went. And two weeks later some more went from this DP\ncamp that I visited. Some years later - I kept the names and addresses of some of them, and 25\nyears later I came across a folder with these, with some of them - oh no, I think, I'm sorry - my\nmind now is getting clear - some of them replied to me. And I kept those in a folder. That's it.\nAnd they simply said in varying degrees of, of excitement I received your note. I did contact my\nfriend or relative. Thank you very much. In varying degrees of, of, of enthusiasm and warmth and\nemotion. And I didn't do any...you know, what would one do. I, I did what I could and I and I\ndidn't I didn't want to intrude on people's lives, but twenty-five years later I came across 1 :his\nfolder and decided to write to two or three of them to say I've just found your letter to me of 1945.\nIt's now 1960 whatever, '63, '68. I'm curious to know whether the person that you told ME you\nhad located is doing all right. Something like that. And I got two or three very fascinating letters.\nOne if you'd like I'll tell you about. Evidently one of the persons, who couldn't speak English,\nsaid I have a relative in Windsor, Ontario, but I don't know his or her address. His name was\nEisenberg (ph), I now find. I wrote to the Chief of Police in Windsor, Ontario, saying I have met\na prisoner in whether it was Buchenwald or the DP camp I've forgotten. He or she, he needs help\nimmediately and doesn't know his relative's address. Could you try to locate a mister, I think it\nwas Hiam Eisenberg (ph). The constable or the Mounties, I don't know who, put a little note in\nthe Windsor newspaper and through that newspaper note, they located the relative who got in\ntouch with Mr. Eisenberg in Europe and they wrote to me from Windsor saying thank you.\nWe've, we've seen your letter from the Chief Constable of Windsor and we have made contact\nand bless you and, and that was that. Many years later I decided to write and see whether Mr.\nEisenberg was still in Windsor and low and behold, he replied, saying I have never forgotten you\nbecause first of all you were an Ally, secondly you were an officer, thirdly you were Jewish, and\nfor me this was, this was momentous. And I'm now in Windsor and I opened a little air\nconditioning store and I married in Europe and I have three Canadian children and we're doing\nwell and we're very happy. When the Holocaust Memorial Museum found out about the\nphotographs that I had taken at Buchenwald, they asked if I had other mementoes additional to\nthe photographs. And I took out these letters and sent them; including Mr. Eisenberg's and then I\nthought I should tell him I've done this, because after all 1t was a letter to me. He said of course\nyou can send them to the Museum. Then he wrote me a second letter, which I've also given to the\nMuseum saying I must tell you of an odd occurrence in Buchenwald he said. I was handy with...1\nwas working in a some kind of foundry. My number was, and he mentions his six digit number in\nthe letter, but he said when I forged the new one I put the letter P, capital P, in front of it because\nI had noticed that prisoners who had a P in front of their number were less likely to be killed than\nthose who didn't. He said I wasn't killed, and to this day I think Lt had to do with the letter P\nwhich I think meant either political or Polish. I received that letter, sent it on to the Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, and ten days ago driving from Ottawa to Washington, my wife and I get\nthese reading tapes - you put them in your car and a book 1s read to you - and this particular book\nwas about a woman who had been in Auschwitz, Dachau and a third concentration camp. And\nshe mentioned the letter P as meaning political or Polish and being sort of a talisman (ph) so what\nEisenberg had suspected as a thesis in fact was correct and so his life presumably was changed by\nthis, this quirk of fate. I called the Holocaust Memorial Museum to say I was sending them this\nfascinating letter and suggested that they write to Mr. Eisenberg to get that little ID with the letter\nP on it. On such minuscule quirks one's life depends. It's really sort of mind boggling. (Pause)\nWell, I have received letters from people in London and Turkey and in Israel. I have a beautiful\nletter from someone in Israel - two, two letters from what is now Israel, one from New Jersey,\none from the Bronx. Several from England. And I've kept them. And I think they're now all in the\ncustody of the Museum and that was the little contribution that a, that a young kid was able to\nmake to, to this Holocaust.",
        "A: I wonder if I could read it. I have it here. it really is a touching letter. (Sure) it goes into much\nmore detail than, than Mr. Eisenberg's about broader issues. I, I hope I can locate it. , I know I\nhave it here and it is very (pause) it is very graphic. Dear Mr. Pollack. This is from Hiam\nGrossman (ph), 48 Street, Tel Aviv. Dear Mr. Pollack. I thank you very much indeed for your\nkind letter of July 31, and I hasten to answer it as I was extremely pleased lo hear from you\nagain. I had written him in the late 50's. My sister-in-law, Mrs. Sarah , was saved from Nazi\ncaptivation after she had been thrown into the extermination railway whence the American\nliberators extracted her. In September '45 she arrived tn Israel and thanks to good medical care\nand substantial nourishment, she slowly recovered from those terrible impressions. By chance I\nlearned of the address of her son and his family whom my sister-in-law met unexpectedly for\nthe first time at the Palestine Office in Paris. Together they went to Israel where they are now\nliving in Haifa. The son is a government official and his nice little daughter Ruth is now seven\nand goes to school, So Ruth now is 25 years, later, so she's in her mid-30's. She 1s the only\nmember of the family upon whom the dreadful past did not leave any trace. My sister-in-law,\ndespite her unusual vitality and her strong desire to enjoy life, cannot forget the past and\nreconcile herself\u2019 to the loss of her dear ones. Naturally we try hard to make the last years of her\nlife pleasant and we actually often wonder where these people found the physical and the\nemotional strength to survive the sufferings they have had to undergo. Obviously only the help\nof people like yourself has encouraged them to go on and to have faith in the future. It is said in\nthe Torah, in quote marks, \"Anyone who saves a single soul, has saved the world as a whole.\"\nAnd you may be justly proud to be one of those. I am very glad that you have afforded me this\nopportunity of thanking you from the bottom of my heart in my own name and in the name of\nmy entire family for all you have done to save my sister-in-law's life to whom I am forwarding\nthis letter, your letter, so that she can write to you also. I did not get a letter from her. I was glad\nto learn that you got married in the meantime and I am wishing you and Mrs. Pollack much luck\nand happiness. It would be extremely nice to meet you both personally. You probably know that\nour small country attracts many visitors from all four corners of the globe and perhaps you will\nalso consider once to spend a short leave here. Wouldn't that have beer interesting? It is\nneedless to say we would be only too pleased to offer you hospitality. I hope to hear from you\nagain. For us the war was not terminated when the 2nd World War ended and my own grandson\nwho was seventeen was among the first victims of the war of liberation. But we feel that the\nsacrifices were not in vain, as after 2000 years of dispersal, we gained our homeland. It 1s our\nhope that our children will be granted a better world than this of today. Who would have\nbelieved in 1945 that today the Germans are again allowed to sit in the family of nations as\namong equals. With the very best wishes and greetings for yourself and Mrs. Pollack, I am very\ntruly yours, Hiam Grossman. I mean this is an example of another letter which was if have it\nhere these are copies - that that the originals here all gone to, to your library, to your Museum\nbut one here - no I don't have it. From, from (pause) Mrs. Cutler 1n, in the United States, but I, I\ndon't have it handy. Oh, oh here 1s the 1945 letter, August, so that's, that's the first one - that the\nnext on~ was some :20 twenty years later. Dear Mr. Pollack. Words fail] me to thank you for\nyour very kind letter of 17th just recetved. In the meantime we have received several letters\nfrom my sister-in-law, Mrs. Sarah as well as a cable giving us her address as quote, \"Displaced\nPersons Center, M , Belgium,\" dated 19 July '45, but as it was impossible to communicate with\nher at the above address, we sent her a cable to the quote \"Palestine Office\" unquote, in\nBrussels. So that's, that's their reply to my air gram. (Pause) Well, this is an illustration.",
        "A: Well, I came back from the service in 1945 and finished my final work on a Bachelor. I had, had\ntwo years when I enlisted and I took another year and a half and got a bachelor's degree from the\nUniversity of Saskatchewan, and then was given a scholarship to study at the University of\nChicago in the United States where I took my Master's and all of my Ph.D. excepting the thesis,\nand then was offered a, a, a job with the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction\nDevelopment here in Washington, and worked there for a couple of year; and then joined the\nUnited Nations Secretariat and had a thirty year career in Washington, in New York City, in\nMexico City, in Santiago, Chile, and in Geneva. Then I came back thirty years later. I married\nwhen I got the U.N. job, had three children and on taking early retirement in 1980, returned to\nOttawa, which was my wife's home, and I've been a professor at Carlton University in the School\nof International Affairs ever since.",
        "A: Well, the initial effect was very powerful, very raw and very emotional to a young kid, but I\nthink the effect on me, an odd way to put it is sort of been an intellectual one. I, all my career\nboth in the United Nations and teaching has been on how do systems work. What are ideologies\nof political systems and economic systems and how do they, how do you make them work, and\nthe fact that the Nazis were able to design a philosophy and make it work so efficiently, there\nwas based on extermination and torture and hatred and killing and superiority and inferiority of,\nof, of racial theories, the, the, the intellectual concept has stayed with me - how, how horrible it\nis and how easy it is to evolve systems that have such a blasphemous ideology and can be so\nefficiently run. This has stayed with me, so remember that my childhood was not that of a\nJewish person, that is to say we were the only Jewish family and while I knew I was Jewish I\ndidn't feel it sort of in through my chicken soup that Jewish children in a in a Jewish community\nwould feel. I knew I was Jewish but I didn't know anything whatnot. So that Buchenwald had\nthis first effect which was very raw as I say and it upset me. It just physically upset me, but\nafterwards it made me just aware of the horrors of being able to design and implement systems\nbased on, on such a concept of human life and immorality and fear and hatred and finally this,\nthis is what stays with me that Buchenwald proved that you can do it. Do it well, from that point\nof view. As a matter of fact, not; don't I don't use such emotional words when I'm teaching, but I\ndo tell students in my first class in the sessions when I teach development, the word\ndevelopment has been my life. And I say you know I, I do remember one thing. When I was a\nkid your age I say to the students, I'm, I'm fascinated how easy it was even for the Allies to take\nyoung people and put them in the same uniform, same haircut, same kind of shoes, same tie,\nand get them in a disciplined way to destroy, not with these horrible overtones of Nazis, but you\ncan bring young people together to be disciplined to destroy. It's not hard. It's not hard to teach\npeople to enjoy cutting down a big tree. But how difficult it 1s to get people to join voluntarily\nto build and to develop it, to plant trees. That thought has stayed in my mind all my life. Just\nthat the Nazis carried it to a blasphemous and obscene result, but it is so easy to take young\npeople and have them do things together in a tightly organized way, even though they, they\nwant to be different. This has always been a big , a big paradox in my mind that it's easy\nto do to do that, so Buchenwald just made me think very deeply about this paradox of\ncivilization. How we can be Dr. Jekeyl's one moment and Mr. Hyde's the next. I may just on a\nsomewhat lighter note, if you don't mind, I'd like to tell you the story of the camera that took the\npictures that that I've been talking about. in my childhood in Saskatchewan, it was quite\ncommon for teenagers to be given a rifle because we shot game, small game We would shoot\ncrows because they would eat wheat, and we\u2019d shoot gophers and bush rabbits because they'd\neat wheat. So kids had a rifle, and I had a 22, and nobody thought about it. But when I was\ncommissioned and went overseas the British gave officers in Europe, when we went across the\nchannel, gave officers side arms. We were gentlemen. We had side arms. And enlisted men,\nmen had these big rifles, 303's. On our way to as close as we could get to Weimar before\ncoming to this incident with Buchenwald, we spent a night at one of the many German guest\nhouses on the edge of the, the Black Forest. And there were these little round buildings where\npeople would rest their arms and shoot at I don't know what, game of some kind. So I asked my\nFlight Sergeant if after dinner he would come with me and help me regain my use of a of a\npowerful rifle. Because I said you know if there are Germans hiding in the which we were told\nthere were. It was the end of the war and many Germans had taken refuge, refuge in this big\nforest, being fed and protected by the civilians. If there are Germans there and if for some\nreason they decide to shoot at us, my little side arm, my little popgun, wouldn't be worth\nanything at ten yards. So I'd just like to practice again with a, with your 303, which 1s a big rifle.\nI think it was a Lee Enfield (ph). So he said OK, and after dinner we went out. It was six o'clock\nor seven o'clock. It was good light, and I took this big rifle. They, they have a recoil so you push\nthem up against your shoulder ad I put my elbow on the little window and he said you see that\ntree down there - I guess it was ten yards or whatever - see if you can hit it. So I aimed and\npressed the trigger twice, and whap, whap this these bullets - I, I hit the tree, and I turned to him\nyou know with great pride saying you know, that just shows you I hadn't forgotten. And out\nfrom behind the tree come two German officers, who had been hiding. They didn't know we\nwere there. We didn't know they were there. But they thought that we'd seen them and were\nshooting at them, and came towards us and one pulls off a dagger or a little short sword and\nhands it to the Flight Sergeant saying something in German which we assume was don't, here,\nthis is a bribe, and the other takes a little icon camera off his neck and hands it to me. Then we\ndidn't know what to do with these two guys, so we phoned and an American military policeman\ncame and took them away with great joy and I ended up with a camera. And I got film and I\nthink it's sort of fitting retribution that the pictures that I took and which are now with your\nMuseum were taken with a liberated German camera although it was humorous tn the, after the\nevent, but this, this was the way I, I got a camera to take the pictures that I did.",
        "A: No, I don't think so. I hear in Canada and in the United States people saying it never happened.\nThe Holocaust never happened. The concentration camps never happened and I know they\nhappened, because I was in them albeit only for a few hours. I'm coming to the latter stages of\nmy career and life and I have been involved with development I think perhaps as, well come to\nthink of it maybe as a psychological antidote to destruction. Maybe if you think about these\nthings and you're in very formative years you've spent three or four years destroying things and\nseeing such things as Buchenwald, you, you want to build you know. You feel a compulsion to\ndevelop things, not to knock them down. The war and Buchenwald stay in my mind because I'm\nan economist and I work on the link between economic growth and social equilibrium and\npolitical stability and I wonder whether we can maintain a world in which these kinds of\noccurrences, the war and the the Buchenwalds, won't happen again. So I think that it's admirable\nthat your Holocaust Memorial Library will be a place where young people and not young\npeople can see and hear and read these things and not, not for not for emotional reasons. I've\ntried not to be emotional today. I, I haven't used my folders or my letters. As a matter of fact\nnobody even knew they existed until Hiam Bookbinder found out about them from, from one of\nthe few people who ever saw them. So my reason for being so happy to give what I have and\ntell what I have to the Museum is not an emotional reason, to arouse emotions and passions but\nto have people think about these things so they won't happen again.",
        "A: It's less clear in my mind than Buchenwald, and I think it was briefer. What I would suggest is I\ndo believe that Mr. Eisenberg was in the DP camp because when he wrote in one letter, he, he\nrefers to me taking out my little book in the, and I think he said in the, in Belgium. So if you\nhave a chance to write to him or interview him, probably he would be better equipped to tell\nyou. I really don't remember. You know it's 1945 is what - good Lord, 45 years ago, and lots of\nother thoughts have come into my mind since then. But whoever was there it was clearly in\nreasonably good health, so that the thing wasn't so tragic. There wasn't so much pathos as there\nwas in Buchenwald where the triage system was so stark; in the these three groups of people.",
        "A: You're welcome.\nPAUSE - TECHNICNICAL CONVERSATION\nWell this was one of the furnaces. it was out of course, although I vaguely recollect seeing\nsome embers, but I may be wrong. There's a body or bones - more seen in one side than the\nother. I did all of this very hurriedly so I am afraid I don\u2019t remember more than that.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nWell these piles of bones were in various parts o~ the camp. They were also piles of shoes\nand belts and things. Someone said they'd seen teeth. But I didn't see teeth, but I, I did see\nthis pile of just bones.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nI don't know how many bodies are underneath what you are seeing there. I, I assume now\nthat there must be three or four layers and I don't know whether that's a truck or s horse 28\npulled wagon, but they were just taking the bodies away obviously as quickly as they could\nso that there wouldn't be gangrene or whatever medical problems would last (ph), but they\nwere just carted away as quickly as, as they could get Something to put them in. Just like as I\nsaid, piles of beer bottles.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nI don't know who put the wreath up. I assume it ~as some one from the U.S. Army. Could\nhave been a civilian but I don't know. The thing that is so horrible is the emaciation of the legs\nand arms and waists and of course the fact the faces all begin to look exactly alike. They just\nall look like skulls. The skin is drawn so tightly there's no fat or flesh anymore. They're just,\nthey're just gone. They just evaporated. They're just tossed there. And you'll see how they're\npiled on top of each other so as to get the maximum number in a short, in a minimum amount\nof space. A really macabre sight. I - and it was all over the place too. Were not just there but\nall over the place.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nWell, it's 45 years ago and as I mentioned I was just 23 years old, but they all looked so\npathetic. There were just piles and piles and even the clothing - you see the striped pajamas -\nthat they didn't all have that typical garb. They all looked so sad. They were these, you\ncouldn't, they weren't human beings. They, they didn't look like people. They just looked like\nstacks of waxy things, and they just were, just rows of them.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nI think I had in the photographs somewhere the - I should have mentioned this and I\ndidn't - the lamp.\nEnd of Tape #1\nConclusion of Interview\n"
