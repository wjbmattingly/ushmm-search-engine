Tell everyone that we are your parents, and this is just the way that\nyou can survive.

It was -- they came like suddenly from the\nsky as paratroopers. They put the paratroopers to take this place from the Russians during\nthe war. And, you know, half a year, they forced leave this place. Half a year. So they\noccupied this place like half a year. But from thi -- I believe it was more than half a year\nwhen I first saw my mom, because when she came, I did not recognize her. She was\nalive, and because she was -- she looked like Russian, so with this name like Vera, so she\nsurvive. When she survived, she start looking for me. She start ask one, another one, you\nknow? And finally she find the family where I was. And this family tell to them, \u201cListen,\nyou know if your fa -- if your husband will come. You don\u2019t know how you can survive,\nokay?

Maybe they s -- in some ways they believe maybe\nit\u2019s not my mom also, but they was not happy to give me back. It was a sad day. And --\nbut I believe it was about -- about a year, maybe like -- that I stay in this family. So ina\ncouple months my mom came back. And she ch -- she change her dress. She came in the\nsame dress that she left, and she make her hair in the same way. And I took a look on her,\nand I said, \u201cMy mom came to pick me up.\u201d So I came to kiss her, and she asks I want to\nst -- with their permission that I have to stay additional month, she has to prepare somethi\n-- somewheres to take me.",

        "Q: Were you ever sympathetic to the Communists?",
        "A: Well I -- I was never sympathetic to them, because the -- the question is that their\npromise was totally not what they actually did the people. Let\u2019s say they said that you\nhave right for speech, you have freedom -- I don\u2019t know, a lot of freedom actually, when\nit comes to realize these rights, you don\u2019t have them. So -- and the question is, they did\nnot left anything for you, let\u2019s say, to think about, or to tell them let\u2019s -- let\u2019s to improve\nsomething, let\u2019s do something in different ways. So --",
        "Q: And at what -- what age did you become -- did you realize this? At a young age?",
        "A: Yeah, I realize it at -- at very young age, and the question was just what you have to do,\nyou have to start to be like [indecipherable] resistant to this, or you have to find some\nway -- ways how to in future support your family, and things like this, and do anything\nagainst, let\u2019s say, your family. So that is why you stay, that\u2019s it. But what -- what -- about\ncriticism, what is doing, the government, what they doing wrong, it was always in\nconversation in our house. So that is why when I -- when we -- when I got married, and\nwe went -- got a son, so we decided that our son\u2019s life could not be here, because he grow\nup in the situations that he cannot -- he cannot accept it. And well, when we got married -\n- so my wife, she -- much earlier than me she realized that for us is no room here, and we\nhave to leave this country and find something else. And -- well, why I was not very\nsupport -- why I did not support where he decided, because I said, \u201cListen,\n[indecipherable] what we have now because I am working with a com -- with the\ncompany that they can tell me there are no secrets, we will be -- we will stuck between\nleave this one and don\u2019t have anything else, and just don\u2019t let us go. So this is why I let --\nI cannot do it right now.\u201d",
        "Q: So you were working for a --",
        "A: Well, I worked --",
        "Q: You were -- you were working with some other company so that you knew government\nsecrets?",
        "A: Well, they said yes, but the branch where I was, I did not have any secrets.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And later -- later, when they decided, when they open a little bit mind, they let leave the\ncountry people who really knew much more secrets, and they did not said that you\ncannot. This is -- was just a plan, was a government plan, the plan with the government\nlevel. Because as I said, it\u2019s for the history no one can explain that when they decided\nthat they would like -- they let Jewish people to leave the country, they have to found an\nexcuse, why Jewish? Why they don\u2019t let Russian --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- or Ukrainian, or someone else. So they make up that they g -- they support the fa --\nunited family, as a --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, the family was -- and it was licenned. They put a paper there, they miss her\n[indecipherable], they have not see her from the year 1930 -- 1913, they never know her,\nthey nev -- ni -- like next time they m-ma -- make their decision a different way, they said\nall sister is not a relative, something else is not a relative. And as a -- as -- as you know it\nwas situation when they -- the way how they explain to the rest of the people that they\nwant leave, let them go, because this is to Israel. Jewish people, they unite with someone.\nThis is why old people that they won\u2019t -- don\u2019t like them, so they -- officially they put\nsome documents, and they let them go to Israel.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was like -- I think it\u2019s -- even Solzhenitsyn they sent it like this, sent him to Israel in\ntheir time. But -- and that is why maybe -- maybe, if I decided that we have to do it,\nmaybe I -- we got this -- I am not sure they will let us go, but I will -- I spent about 18\nyears on this factory -- on this enterprise, and -- because from this enterprise when -- wh-\nwhen we -- they did not even take your documents when they see where you worked. It\nwas none, but it was excuse for them. So when I left it on the next month, I got another\nenterprise. It is no with military connection, so we -- we start over from this point. And --\nbu -- it was the year 1979, and we believe that because it was like Olympic game in\nMoscow, maybe they -- they a little bit open the door, and maybe we will be lucky to go\nthrough this door. And well, they said no. They said no, no, no, no, no. Some people they\nmanaged, I don\u2019t know how they gave under table money to someone, they -- everything\nwas corrupt, so maybe they find the way. But we did not -- we was unable to do it. But\nwhat we said, so it was like a legal situation, was you can do like you are on the level, not\n-- not fighting. Cause the government, every six months you can to send documents that\nyou apply -- that you did not change your mind, you still apply. And they send you a\npostcard they know. Th -- they did -- the -- a division of visas permission, they said you\ncannot go, no, your -- your request is denied, your request is denied. And it -- as I said, it\nwas when we start -- our problem was that when we start first time to do it, our son was\nabout two year old. No, not two -- yeah, two year old when we start first time there.\nWhen he went to the final stage, he almost finish college, and even in this situation, when\nthey play games, a open society, blah, blah, blah, they did unbelievable thing because\nthey played games and said, you know, mom can go, you cannot go. Later they said you\ncan go but your son cannot go. And in this time, the chief -- the chief of this department,\nhe gave interview to some foreign newspapers and he said, \u201cEveryone who want go, we\nlet them go. We don\u2019t keep anyone. There\u2019s no one want to go.\u201d And I came to him, to\nhis office with this newspaper, and I said, \u201cLet me ask you a que,\u201d -- it -- in Moscow his\nwas very, very, very hi -- high level guy, and it\u2019s -- you know, you never know what\nhappen to you when you come back from this -- from this office, because he was very\npowerful. So I came to him with this newspaper, I said, \u201cMay I ask you a question\nplease? What does it means? This is an interview that you gave to this reporter. He did\nnot understand you right? Or it\u2019s a -- a -- a mistake in newspaper?\u201d And he said to me,\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201che understand me right, but we make a decision, not he.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cYour son, we cannot let your son go.\u201d And it was a sp-specific system in -- in Russia\nthat everyone -- every man, he has a gi -- duty to serve three years in the military. After\nmilitary it\u2019s -- besides there\u2019s a -- the life in the military, it\u2019s more than in prison. But\nafter military they said to you, you cannot go because you know secrets, you was in\nmilitary. And no one knows what kind of secrets and how long it lasts to keep you\nbecause you was in military. And my son said to me, \u201cListen, I better die than I go to this\nmilitary.\u201d And with these words, with understanding this, we have to go to this guy a few\ntimes, it was very, very difficult. And finally, as I said, when we were -- when the wind\nwas a little bit warmer, and they let him go, and later we left, and in Italy, when he came\nto Italy, he decided he would like to help young Jewish kids to go to Judaism. So he got a\n[indecipherable] like this, he listened to -- they got like -- a rabbi came to Italy, and they\ntried to introduce to the culture, to the tradition the ju -- Judaism. And everyone was on\nthe beach because it was months, we are not working, you got food, and they make a\ndecision when -- when sk -- they scheduled to bring you to United States, and he was\nbusy with kids, wi -- wi -- because he said that this 1s what he has to do. And when we\ncame here, so very soon he said that we don\u2019t -- we -- we not the right life -- the right life,\nthis is a philosophy. And he changed his life, he become religion.",
        "Q: Religious person, yeah.",
        "A: Very religious.",
        "Q: So you, even though you tried -- you started later, really for almost 20 years you were\ntrying to leave --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- or thinking that -- so 1s it -- must be very difficult to live under those circumstances.",
        "A: Yes, yes, because as I said, they -- 1t is become a common -- let\u2019s say what, like refusniks\n-- refusniks, except the person whom they refuse give a permission to leave. So -- and as\nI said, diff -- different pe -- different category of people, they -- or by their belief or by\nsome circumstances, they did i -- they take different actions to this, you know, they got\nsome of them, they -- every month they go -- went to demonstration, and to the Moscow,\nor to foreign people. Most -- a lot of them, they put them 1n prison, they -- they make up -\n- a lot guilt about this, like rape, like drugs, like things like this. But we was like on the\nlevel that they said okay, you can -- you can -- every six months you can just send us a\nrequest, and we will refuse. But it was a -- a -- a mark that you are -- belong also to this\ncategory.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And -- I don\u2019t -- they -- every be -- maybe, I don\u2019t know, month or two months we got\nsomeone from the police, or from the KGB, he was -- had a police uniform. And he said -\n- he make up a -- a -- any kind of excuse to come to check what we are doing, run, or --\nor [indecipherable] like this. And -- and he reported from our phone, that , \u201cI\u2019m here now\nchecking this family, everything looks -- looks not bad.\u201d And once time he came to us\nand he said -- I said, \u201cWhy did you come to me?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, we got a letter that\nyour neighbor is drunk.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, why you did not go to this member -- to this -- my\nneighbor? He drunk, go to his apartment, why you came to me?\u201d \u201cNo, I would like to\nknow if you know something about it.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, just write that you don\u2019t know about it.\u201d I said, \u201cLook, how it help you? What is\nthe reason?\u201d But they mi -- make up everything, and the problem was when I -- my\nsecond job when I -- it was not a manager position, but sometimes I have taught them the\ndirector\u2019s meetings, because I was in charge for supplies, some important things to the\nfactory. And it was -- sometimes is not your fault but you cannot manage it because it\u2019s --\nit was like a circle. To have the supplies you have to give them something that you are\nunable to give them, some material and you don\u2019t have it. And the -- the director said to -\n- on this meeting, listen, if I will not have these supplies, I will call KGB that you did it\non purpose, you don\u2019t want me to do this production and this one ki -- the government\nwant me to do. And I believe they will make you bah bah bah, like this. And that every\nday was like this, and especially you can understand when our son was in Moscow, and\nwhen we still try to let him go, one days we came to -- to this chief, this department, and\nwe ask him, \u201cLook, what is your logical? Is -- from such and such here, we tried to go all\ntogether. So now what -- how is the family united? If you said -- you advise them to go\nand bring him invitation, later he will have relatives here, and we -- he will have\npermission, what is the [indecipherable]? What is the -- what is the logic?\u201d And he said to\nme, \u201cListen, the students are very patriotic people, so we cannot guarantee he will be safe\nin ma -- in Moscow.\u201d This is -- was the life.",
        "Q: When -- when you switched jobs, you left your job?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And they knew that you are refusnik. Somebody knew.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The next job you had you were not earning as much money as you were the first time,\nright?",
        "A: Yeah, I got maybe half what I got before. And the -- the guy who interview me said,\n\u201cListen, when you move from this place to our place, it means you keep in mind\nsomething. Tell me right away. You know, if you go somewhere, I will have a problem\nwith the -- it will be problem for me. So in order to give you permission or not, I have to\nknow -- tell me right away what you going to do.\u201d And I said to him, \u201cWell, I am telling\nyou right -- right away that I did not change my mind, but because they said that I cannot\nleave country because I used to work on this military, I don\u2019t know how long they will\nkeep me here. Do you know what will happen to you in three years? You don\u2019t know.\u201d\nSo -- and you don\u2019t know what people it\u2019s around in your department, you know what in\ntheir mind. They can make a decision tomorrow. So this job was not very, very -- let\u2019s\nsay presti -- with a prestige, with a lot money, and it was difficult, if need some special\nskills, and someone recommend me to this job. So he said okay. He -- he closed his eyes.\n[indecipherable] did that because when you go from the place where I work bef-before,\nthis place was famous place, with a li -- benefits, with a lot opportunities for -- just for\nbenefits, not about salary, but benefits was really much higher than any other company\nhave. So they understand what you keep in mind, or you fired because you did something\nwrong, against them, and you just manage they -- they don\u2019t put that they fire, or not. In\nUnited States when you find the -- try to get a job you put your resum\u00e9. In Russia you got\na -- like a certificate, your certificate. Every job that you go they put a seal here, and they\nput the reason why you left this job. So -- and if they put the reason that they fire you\nbecause you are bad worker, or you late, or you drunk, or something like this, so later on\nit\u2019]l na -- no one when -- will take you, and this 1 -- was the requirement, you have to\nshow them the certificate. Without this certificate, no one talk to you.",
        "Q: So what was on your certificate when you left this other place?",
        "A: Nothing, that I decide by myself, and that is it.",
        "Q: Nothing. And were you doing mechanical engineering at this place? That\u2019s what you\nstudied in college.",
        "A: It was close, it was -- it was --",
        "Q: Close?",
        "A: -- it was a mechanical engineering field. I have to explain my boss in my company why I\ndecided to leave. So I cannot tell -- I could not tell him that I want to go to abroad --",
        "Q: No, no.",
        "A: -- I just tell him that I have relatives, and -- and we in contact with them in the United\nStates. So I gave then information that he knows all -- or -- or -- if not he, but special\ndepartment knows it already.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that is why I said I would like to leave this place, and I will go. And he said, \u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, stay, I will manage it.\u201d He said, \u201cA couple bottle with vodka, everything will be\nokay, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Because my position in my previous job, it was not very, very big\nlevel, but I was like assistant to our big boss. He was a chief in quality control\nproduction, and it was a factory about 5,000 people. And my job was like statistical job,\nto prepare him for the meetings, for -- for reports, for something like this. So he was very\ncomfortable with me because I tell him what his action, how this [indecipherable] should\nbe, what he has to mention. And he doesn\u2019t -- he did not want me actually, to leave. He\ndid not want me to leave. And he said well, one -- one Jew -- one Jew, he can keep one\nJew. I was just one, no one else. It was like under the percentage. And but this what --\nhow I explain him, I said, \u201cWell, I am going to leave.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, stay with us, blah,\nblah, blah.\u201d I said no, because from this enterprise, I never leave.",
        "Q: You never go, yeah.",
        "A: So I left, and I came to another one and they [indecipherable] they remind me very often\nwhere I come from, and what I keep in mind, because they knew that my papers every\ntime, when I -- and the last time -- not -- it was not last time, before this -- before this\ntime, I fill out the papers again, and -- and the director of this, he was a Jewish guy, and --\nbut he got a Russian name, he -- by documents he was Russian. So he said to me, \u201cListen,\nbecause you put this documents that you want in U.S., I have to transfer you from this\nengineering job to ship -- to like shipping receiving, something like load and loud\n[indecipherable]or something.\u201d I said, \u201cWell if you feel that it\u2019s constitution, you can do\nit. \u2019'm not going to put you any -- any request about this.\u201d Well, and he decided okay, let\nhim stay like this. And this -- well, I stay like this. But as I said, all pe -- a lot people who\nare brought for fight, who f -- f -- to give us this opportunity, they help because this one -\n- one -- wa -- one [indecipherable] did not come back to self. So -- well, [indecipherable]\nGorbachov came, and he got an idea that let\u2019s say let\u2019s have better relationship with --\nwith the west, with something else, but all people who fight hard, work hard to bring this\nday, to let us go, they -- peop -- we remember [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Do you think that a lot of people who were in the Soviet Union would have left if they\nhad the chance, whether they were Jewish or not Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah, I's -- I seeing personally, if they -- they was not so stupid, if they decided what is\nthe deal. If they want to go, let them go, let them go. What -- what happened? Everyone\nwho want go, let them go. A lot people may be going to do so, but I think that\u2019s not -- a\nlot people --",
        "Q: Would have stayed.",
        "A: -- will later -- will go back. Why? Because, you know, it\u2019s -- to grow up in this society,\nand find your place in new society, is not easy --",
        "Q: Is very -- yeah.",
        "A: -- it\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s totally different, you have to f -- you have to know exactly what you\nwant to do, and why you leave this country. If you would like to leave this country just\nbecause you can have here [indecipherable] jeans, or I don\u2019t know, or cheese every day,\nor something like this, very soon maybe you miss it, and you like to go back, because you\nremember some not bad things in your previous life, somethings. Department --\napartment, education system, something like this. But the problem was th -- the -- that\nthey did not let them go, and the problem was true because they did not o -- they di-did\nnot honor your right to exercise your roots, you religion.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And this is the problem. And what I want for -- what I just -- I don\u2019t know, if you goes to\nthe -- I -- I want just mention one thing, that when I came here, so my first job was also\nwe have to find something to live, so I start to working for shipping receiving. And 1n the\n-- in the store -- in store, 1s it -- they sell some equipment for the kitchen. And my first\nboss -- fir -- fir -- first supervisor -- wa -- was first supervisor, I\u2019m sorry, he was\nAmerican African guy, who grow up in tradition with people who remember -- in this\ntime the movement start in 60\u2019s, and you know --",
        "Q: In civil rights.",
        "A: -- civil rights, and he remembered his family was very, very in -- in this movement. And\nhe was actually this very gift -- gifted guy. He was smart, he listened, he was li -- good\nvery listener and -- and I said, \u201cI would like to know actually, when you go to school,\nthese people -- people in your country, they -- they know what is the advantage to live in\nAmerica. Why people from around the world actually try -- want to come to here and stay\nhere?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no one -- I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember even one lesson that my\nteacher told me what is the advantage, what we have here.\u201d If you don\u2019t have -- if you\ndon\u2019t teach them what is the advantage, so -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- is not the best things\nto do because they -- they don\u2019t value what they have. This is the --",
        "Q: So did you tell him?",
        "A: Yeah, I told him, I told him -- well, I told him a ver -- very simple story. I said to him --\nyou know, when it -- I remember this time when it was little bit idea that we had to bring\nAmerican experience to the Russian. It was some government decision, it was time. In\nthis time -- and I remember that one -- once -- one -- he was the guy, his was\n[indecipherable] that he came from very rich sugar production family before revolution\n[indecipherable] was here. So he came to -- and they invite him to introduce some people\n[indecipherable] to the American life, to the style, and he said, \u201cIf you will tell American\nthat,\u201d -- Russian has this word like [indecipherable] or president, they call 1t prepeeska.\nOh stop, forgot about [indecipherable] that your lifestyle is good, because American\ncannot understand what is it. It\u2019s like [indecipherable] even accept it. So -- and I explain\nto him what -- what we got, and we -- how -- what we -- wh-what is the salary, what you\ncan do, and how it works, and what does it mean the freedom, and what does it mean the\nspeech and everything.

I did not cry, I did not ask\nwhy. I did not cry that I want go to my mom. She said me that we have to do it, I said\nokay, we have to do it.

        "A: Yes, h-he got a motorcycle with this -- with carriage.",
        "A: So he put me on the carriage, he put me in this motorcycle, and he brought me to one\nplace. To be honest with you, I am not sure it was a synagogue, or a -- previous synag --\nor it was something -- what kind of place was it, but it was about hundred people inside.\nOvery -- everyone was part of the family. They collect them from different places, they\nbrought them all them together, they assembled them together. So -- and I was just by\nmyself. And --",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?\nQ2?: It\u2019s his watch.\nQ2: It\u2019s the watch that -- yeah --",

        "A: I -- to be honest with, it -- member -- I tried to understand, it looks like it was a small --\nnot big synagogue.",
        "A: Because I don\u2019t remember any church let\u2019s say equipment like crisis or something like\nthis. It looks like -- seems to me that it was a synagogue.",
        "A: And my wife said me, \u201cWhere they got synagogue in Beshbagir?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, if\nthey got hundred people to bring them together -- or more than hundred, maybe they\ngot,\u201d -- anyway it was -- it was in service, or it was --",
        "A: -- previous synagogue.",

        "A: It\u2019s their philosophy, she got -- well, you know, when Germans came, so they came there\nlet\u2019s say [indecipherable] they -- they believe that 1s forever. If she knew that is for a half\na year maybe her behavior will be di --",
        "A: -- was be different, but she believed that is forever. So that is why she said well -- no one\nforce her, teln her this Jewish guy, but she has to explain him where she got this guy --\nwhere she got me. And as a Jewish boy, maybe I got something that if they will take a\nlook at this, they will found that I am a Jewish.",
        "A: So -- and so they brought me to this place. No one gave us food, no one, but because it\nwas families, they got something with them. And I remember me that I go -- I am alone,\nno one else, four year boy, no one else. So and I took a look one family, another family. I\ntook a look one family they -- I remember they eat things like bread with honey. So I\ntook a look on him, he said, \u201cMaybe -- wh-where is your Mom?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have my\nMom here, by [indecipherable] self.\u201d He start crying, and sa -- it was a -- a Jewish man\nwith a build -- I -- I don\u2019t know his name, what -- I don\u2019t know how he looks like, his\nglasses. So -- and he -- he gave me a piece of bread with honey and said, \u201cTake it,\nplease.\u201d And he is crying, and I said, \u201cWhy he is crying?\u201d I did not understand what they\ngoing to do here. I don\u2019t understand why all these peoples here, I even don\u2019t understand\nwhy this guy brought me here. Well, I understand maybe she doesn\u2019t want me stay with\nher, she gave me someone else, and that is it. And it was like, you know, like a sign, I\ndon\u2019t know, that I said to them, \u201cI want to go to make pee-pee.\u201d And the guy who was in\n-- on the door, he said [indecipherable] 1t was a fence around, it was not just -- he said,\n\u201cOkay, you can go.\u201d So when I came and wi -- to make a pee-pee it was like a wooden\ncabin with something in the floor.",
        "A: Yeah, outside, but you can make a pee-pee. So I came to this place, and another guy. I\nlook at him, and he worked with horses. He clean a ho -- a horse. He look at me, he look\non this door, he looked at -- I came along from this place, and he came to me, and he said,\n\u201cListen, all these people will be killed. And I will try to save you. Don\u2019t say a word. I\nwill bring you a carriage, and I will bring you to a safe place.\u201d S -- and he -- he work --\nhe work like with them, but it was -- he was like part on something like underground or\nsomething like this. So he put me in this carriage, and he brought me -- it was about, in\nmy understanding, at least 30 minutes, 40 minutes drive on this place. And he reveals a\nbig, big forest, and he said, \u201cStay here. I be back.\u201d\u201d And what I remember, it was very,\nvery, very ti -- this was real time, and I start to worry, because he did not come back, and\nI don\u2019t know where to go from here. And it was a forest, and just me and the -- and the\nhorse. So I don\u2019t know what I have to do, where I had to go, so --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He left the horse with me, and said stay here. He put this horse around the tree, and said\nstay with me.",
        "A: So he came somewhere. It looks like he came to get some orders, or some direction what\nhe has to do. And he came [indecipherable] that he save one guy. I don\u2019t know if he told\nthem that he\u2019s Jewish or not Jewish, maybe [indecipherable] and he said what -- what is\nnext I can do. So a -- now he came back. He brought -- he put me -- he -- we continue our\n-- this journey, so we came to one place in different town. And we ca -- he came to the\nwoman, the woman was pregnant and she got four kids. And he said, this kid I brought\nyou, this kid has to stay in your house for a couple days, and we will find for him a place.\nShe start crying, she said, \u201cTake him away, I don\u2019t want him because I have three and I\nexpect another one, and it\u2019s very dangerous for me and for my family. I don\u2019t want him,\ntake him away.\u201d Because I understand for Germans is [indecipherable] said, \u201cDon\u2019t\nworry. We will find place for him.\u201d So they put me under the bed, and they put\nwatermelons around me. They cover me --",
        "A: Watermelons. It was time -- it was like the end of the autumn, it was about maybe\nAugust, the end of the August, September, so they put a lot out, and they said, \u201cYou have\nto stay here, don\u2019t go, and don\u2019t cry. But you have to stay here unless we will call you.\nDon\u2019t go away, stay here.\u201d And it was about maybe two days when I was in this position.\nSo later someone came, and the -- it was almost --",
        "A: Yeah, I remember like now, I remember y -- ow --",
        "A: -- I remembering how this bed was covered with something like -- like gray cover, and it\nwas a long one, so when someone come in, and they would like to take a look, they open\nit and they see just watermelon [indecipherable]. So they did not search. I remem-\nremember that one guy came and said, \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d And she said, \u201cNothing.\u201d So\nhe -- he open it. I remember the -- how -- he open it, because I see -- I saw that something\n-- light came to me, but I says I was told.",

So -- and this [indecipherable]\nme, and later they found the couple, and as I remember it was a Polish couple, they were\nnot young, but they were -- they was without children, childre -- childrenless -- how\u2019s it\ngo?",
        "A: Childless.",
        "A: So and they look at -- at me, and they said well they -- they understand that action 1s not -\n- it\u2019s not safe to have a child, because rumors can be around. But because they did not\nhave kids, they decided that they want me to be in their family, because as this guy said,\nher mom is died, no one [indecipherable] he did not tell that Mom around, she will pick\nhim up. And --",
        "A: Well I -- yeah, sh-she ask me, \u201cWell, where\u2019s your mom?\u201d I telled her then that my mom,\nshe went, and I don\u2019t know where sh-she\u2019s --",

Tell everyone that we are your parents, and this is just the way that\nyou can survive. Because if not, they going to kill you, and they going to kill us.\u201d And\nwhen I was in this family, as I remember, it was long enough, because when -- when the\nGermans was in this place about a half a year. It was -- they came like suddenly from the\nsky as paratroopers. They put the paratroopers to take this place from the Russians during\nthe war. And, you know, half a year, they forced leave this place. Half a year. So they\noccupied this place like half a year. But from thi -- I believe it was more than half a year\nwhen I first saw my mom, because when she came, I did not recognize her. She was\nalive, and because she was -- she looked like Russian, so with this name like Vera, so she\nsurvive. When she survived, she start looking for me. She start ask one, another one, you\nknow? And finally she find the family where I was. And this family tell to them, \u201cListen,\nyou know if your fa -- if your husband will come. You don\u2019t know how you can survive,\nokay? And you are actually, you are not old woman, you can have kids more if your\nhusband will come or not, you will have in your family. Let him stay with us. We will\nlike him so mu -- much, and he fa -- he forget about you.\u201d He forget his mom. And Mom\n-- Mom came to me, and someone called me. I remember the face of this woman that I\nlive in the family. She was very, very like sa -- a very -- very worry about this moment.\nAnd she said, \u201cDo you know this woman?\u201d And I came, look at her, I said, \u201cNo. It\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know this woman, she just came to take me. I don\u2019t want go from here. I\ndon\u2019t want go anywhere from here.\u201d And as I told you, she -- he doesn\u2019t remember you.\nAnd it was time that -- actually 1t was for Mom was difficult even to prove that I am her\nson, because no documents, nothing. Maybe they s -- in some ways they believe maybe\nit\u2019s not my mom also, but they was not happy to give me back. It was a sad day. And --\nbut I believe it was about -- about a year, maybe like -- that I stay in this family. So ina\ncouple months my mom came back. And she ch -- she change her dress. She came in the\nsame dress that she left, and she make her hair in the same way. And I took a look on her,\nand I said, \u201cMy mom came to pick me up.\u201d So I came to kiss her, and she asks I want to\nst -- with their permission that I have to stay additional month, she has to prepare somethi\n-- somewheres to take me.",

        "A: Yeah, I realize it at -- at very young age, and the question was just what you have to do,\nyou have to start to be like [indecipherable] resistant to this, or you have to find some\nway -- ways how to in future support your family, and things like this, and do anything\nagainst, let\u2019s say, your family. So that is why you stay, that\u2019s it. But what -- what -- about\ncriticism, what is doing, the government, what they doing wrong, it was always in\nconversation in our house. So that is why when I -- when we -- when I got married, and\nwe went -- got a son, so we decided that our son\u2019s life could not be here, because he grow\nup in the situations that he cannot -- he cannot accept it.

        "A: Well, I worked --",
        "A: Well, they said yes, but the branch where I was, I did not have any secrets.",
        "A: And later -- later, when they decided, when they open a little bit mind, they let leave the\ncountry people who really knew much more secrets, and they did not said that you\ncannot. This is -- was just a plan, was a government plan, the plan with the government\nlevel. Because as I said, it\u2019s for the history no one can explain that when they decided\nthat they would like -- they let Jewish people to leave the country, they have to found an\nexcuse, why Jewish? Why they don\u2019t let Russian --",
        "A: -- or Ukrainian, or someone else. So they make up that they g -- they support the fa --\nunited family, as a --",

They put a paper there, they miss her\n[indecipherable], they have not see her from the year 1930 -- 1913, they never know her,\nthey nev -- ni -- like next time they m-ma -- make their decision a different way, they said\nall sister is not a relative, something else is not a relative. And as a -- as -- as you know it\nwas situation when they -- the way how they explain to the rest of the people that they\nwant leave, let them go, because this is to Israel. Jewish people, they unite with someone.\nThis is why old people that they won\u2019t -- don\u2019t like them, so they -- officially they put\nsome documents, and they let them go to Israel.",
        "A: It was like -- I think it\u2019s -- even Solzhenitsyn they sent it like this, sent him to Israel in\ntheir time. But -- and that is why maybe -- maybe, if I decided that we have to do it,\nmaybe I -- we got this -- I am not sure they will let us go, but I will -- I spent about 18\nyears on this factory -- on this enterprise, and -- because from this enterprise when -- wh-\nwhen we -- they did not even take your documents when they see where you worked. It\nwas none, but it was excuse for them. So when I left it on the next month, I got another\nenterprise. It is no with military connection, so we -- we start over from this point. And --\nbu -- it was the year 1979, and we believe that because it was like Olympic game in\nMoscow, maybe they -- they a little bit open the door, and maybe we will be lucky to go\nthrough this door. And well, they said no. They said no, no, no, no, no. Some people they\nmanaged, I don\u2019t know how they gave under table money to someone, they -- everything\nwas corrupt, so maybe they find the way. But we did not -- we was unable to do it. But\nwhat we said, so it was like a legal situation, was you can do like you are on the level, not\n-- not fighting. Cause the government, every six months you can to send documents that\nyou apply -- that you did not change your mind, you still apply. And they send you a\npostcard they know. Th -- they did -- the -- a division of visas permission, they said you\ncannot go, no, your -- your request is denied, your request is denied. And it -- as I said, it\nwas when we start -- our problem was that when we start first time to do it, our son was\nabout two year old. No, not two -- yeah, two year old when we start first time there.\nWhen he went to the final stage, he almost finish college, and even in this situation, when\nthey play games, a open society, blah, blah, blah, they did unbelievable thing because\nthey played games and said, you know, mom can go, you cannot go. Later they said you\ncan go but your son cannot go. And in this time, the chief -- the chief of this department,\nhe gave interview to some foreign newspapers and he said, \u201cEveryone who want go, we\nlet them go. We don\u2019t keep anyone. There\u2019s no one want to go.\u201d And I came to him, to\nhis office with this newspaper, and I said, \u201cLet me ask you a que,\u201d -- it -- in Moscow his\nwas very, very, very hi -- high level guy, and it\u2019s -- you know, you never know what\nhappen to you when you come back from this -- from this office, because he was very\npowerful. So I came to him with this newspaper, I said, \u201cMay I ask you a question\nplease? What does it means? This is an interview that you gave to this reporter. He did\nnot understand you right? Or it\u2019s a -- a -- a mistake in newspaper?\u201d And he said to me,\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201che understand me right, but we make a decision, not he.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cYour son, we cannot let your son go.\u201d And it was a sp-specific system in -- in Russia\nthat everyone -- every man, he has a gi -- duty to serve three years in the military. After\nmilitary it\u2019s -- besides there\u2019s a -- the life in the military, it\u2019s more than in prison. But\nafter military they said to you, you cannot go because you know secrets, you was in\nmilitary. And no one knows what kind of secrets and how long it lasts to keep you\nbecause you was in military. And my son said to me, \u201cListen, I better die than I go to this\nmilitary.\u201d And with these words, with understanding this, we have to go to this guy a few\ntimes, it was very, very difficult. And finally, as I said, when we were -- when the wind\nwas a little bit warmer, and they let him go, and later we left, and in Italy, when he came\nto Italy, he decided he would like to help young Jewish kids to go to Judaism. So he got a\n[indecipherable] like this, he listened to -- they got like -- a rabbi came to Italy, and they\ntried to introduce to the culture, to the tradition the ju -- Judaism. And everyone was on\nthe beach because it was months, we are not working, you got food, and they make a\ndecision when -- when sk -- they scheduled to bring you to United States, and he was\nbusy with kids, wi -- wi -- because he said that this 1s what he has to do. And when we\ncame here, so very soon he said that we don\u2019t -- we -- we not the right life -- the right life,\nthis is a philosophy. And he changed his life, he become religion.",
        "A: Very religious.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, because as I said, they -- 1t is become a common -- let\u2019s say what, like refusniks\n-- refusniks, except the person whom they refuse give a permission to leave. So -- and as\nI said, diff -- different pe -- different category of people, they -- or by their belief or by\nsome circumstances, they did i -- they take different actions to this, you know, they got\nsome of them, they -- every month they go -- went to demonstration, and to the Moscow,\nor to foreign people. Most -- a lot of them, they put them 1n prison, they -- they make up -\n- a lot guilt about this, like rape, like drugs, like things like this. But we was like on the\nlevel that they said okay, you can -- you can -- every six months you can just send us a\nrequest, and we will refuse. But it was a -- a -- a mark that you are -- belong also to this\ncategory.",
        "A: And -- I don\u2019t -- they -- every be -- maybe, I don\u2019t know, month or two months we got\nsomeone from the police, or from the KGB, he was -- had a police uniform. And he said -\n- he make up a -- a -- any kind of excuse to come to check what we are doing, run, or --\nor [indecipherable] like this. And -- and he reported from our phone, that , \u201cI\u2019m here now\nchecking this family, everything looks -- looks not bad.\u201d And once time he came to us\nand he said -- I said, \u201cWhy did you come to me?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, we got a letter that\nyour neighbor is drunk.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, why you did not go to this member -- to this -- my\nneighbor? He drunk, go to his apartment, why you came to me?\u201d \u201cNo, I would like to\nknow if you know something about it.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, just write that you don\u2019t know about it.\u201d I said, \u201cLook, how it help you? What is\nthe reason?\u201d But they mi -- make up everything, and the problem was when I -- my\nsecond job when I -- it was not a manager position, but sometimes I have taught them the\ndirector\u2019s meetings, because I was in charge for supplies, some important things to the\nfactory. And it was -- sometimes is not your fault but you cannot manage it because it\u2019s --\nit was like a circle. To have the supplies you have to give them something that you are\nunable to give them, some material and you don\u2019t have it. And the -- the director said to -\n- on this meeting, listen, if I will not have these supplies, I will call KGB that you did it\non purpose, you don\u2019t want me to do this production and this one ki -- the government\nwant me to do. And I believe they will make you bah bah bah, like this. And that every\nday was like this, and especially you can understand when our son was in Moscow, and\nwhen we still try to let him go, one days we came to -- to this chief, this department, and\nwe ask him, \u201cLook, what is your logical? Is -- from such and such here, we tried to go all\ntogether. So now what -- how is the family united? If you said -- you advise them to go\nand bring him invitation, later he will have relatives here, and we -- he will have\npermission, what is the [indecipherable]? What is the -- what is the logic?\u201d And he said to\nme, \u201cListen, the students are very patriotic people, so we cannot guarantee he will be safe\nin ma -- in Moscow.\u201d This is -- was the life.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I got maybe half what I got before. And the -- the guy who interview me said,\n\u201cListen, when you move from this place to our place, it means you keep in mind\nsomething. Tell me right away. You know, if you go somewhere, I will have a problem\nwith the -- it will be problem for me. So in order to give you permission or not, I have to\nknow -- tell me right away what you going to do.\u201d And I said to him, \u201cWell, I am telling\nyou right -- right away that I did not change my mind, but because they said that I cannot\nleave country because I used to work on this military, I don\u2019t know how long they will\nkeep me here. Do you know what will happen to you in three years? You don\u2019t know.\u201d\nSo -- and you don\u2019t know what people it\u2019s around in your department, you know what in\ntheir mind. They can make a decision tomorrow. So this job was not very, very -- let\u2019s\nsay presti -- with a prestige, with a lot money, and it was difficult, if need some special\nskills, and someone recommend me to this job. So he said okay. He -- he closed his eyes.\n[indecipherable] did that because when you go from the place where I work bef-before,\nthis place was famous place, with a li -- benefits, with a lot opportunities for -- just for\nbenefits, not about salary, but benefits was really much higher than any other company\nhave. So they understand what you keep in mind, or you fired because you did something\nwrong, against them, and you just manage they -- they don\u2019t put that they fire, or not. In\nUnited States when you find the -- try to get a job you put your resum\u00e9. In Russia you got\na -- like a certificate, your certificate. Every job that you go they put a seal here, and they\nput the reason why you left this job. So -- and if they put the reason that they fire you\nbecause you are bad worker, or you late, or you drunk, or something like this, so later on\nit\u2019]l na -- no one when -- will take you, and this 1 -- was the requirement, you have to\nshow them the certificate. Without this certificate, no one talk to you.",
        "A: Nothing, that I decide by myself, and that is it.",
        "A: It was close, it was -- it was --",
        "A: -- it was a mechanical engineering field. I have to explain my boss in my company why I\ndecided to leave. So I cannot tell -- I could not tell him that I want to go to abroad --",
        "A: -- I just tell him that I have relatives, and -- and we in contact with them in the United\nStates. So I gave then information that he knows all -- or -- or -- if not he, but special\ndepartment knows it already.",
        "A: And that is why I said I would like to leave this place, and I will go. And he said, \u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, stay, I will manage it.\u201d He said, \u201cA couple bottle with vodka, everything will be\nokay, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Because my position in my previous job, it was not very, very big\nlevel, but I was like assistant to our big boss. He was a chief in quality control\nproduction, and it was a factory about 5,000 people. And my job was like statistical job,\nto prepare him for the meetings, for -- for reports, for something like this. So he was very\ncomfortable with me because I tell him what his action, how this [indecipherable] should\nbe, what he has to mention. And he doesn\u2019t -- he did not want me actually, to leave. He\ndid not want me to leave. And he said well, one -- one Jew -- one Jew, he can keep one\nJew. I was just one, no one else. It was like under the percentage. And but this what --\nhow I explain him, I said, \u201cWell, I am going to leave.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, stay with us, blah,\nblah, blah.\u201d I said no, because from this enterprise, I never leave.",
        "A: So I left, and I came to another one and they [indecipherable] they remind me very often\nwhere I come from, and what I keep in mind, because they knew that my papers every\ntime, when I -- and the last time -- not -- it was not last time, before this -- before this\ntime, I fill out the papers again, and -- and the director of this, he was a Jewish guy, and --\nbut he got a Russian name, he -- by documents he was Russian. So he said to me, \u201cListen,\nbecause you put this documents that you want in U.S., I have to transfer you from this\nengineering job to ship -- to like shipping receiving, something like load and loud\n[indecipherable]or something.\u201d I said, \u201cWell if you feel that it\u2019s constitution, you can do\nit. \u2019'm not going to put you any -- any request about this.\u201d Well, and he decided okay, let\nhim stay like this. And this -- well, I stay like this. But as I said, all pe -- a lot people who\nare brought for fight, who f -- f -- to give us this opportunity, they help because this one -\n- one -- wa -- one [indecipherable] did not come back to self. So -- well, [indecipherable]\nGorbachov came, and he got an idea that let\u2019s say let\u2019s have better relationship with --\nwith the west, with something else, but all people who fight hard, work hard to bring this\nday, to let us go, they -- peop -- we remember [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, I's -- I seeing personally, if they -- they was not so stupid, if they decided what is\nthe deal. If they want to go, let them go, let them go. What -- what happened? Everyone\nwho want go, let them go. A lot people may be going to do so, but I think that\u2019s not -- a\nlot people --",
        "A: -- will later -- will go back. Why? Because, you know, it\u2019s -- to grow up in this society,\nand find your place in new society, is not easy --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s totally different, you have to f -- you have to know exactly what you\nwant to do, and why you leave this country. If you would like to leave this country just\nbecause you can have here [indecipherable] jeans, or I don\u2019t know, or cheese every day,\nor something like this, very soon maybe you miss it, and you like to go back, because you\nremember some not bad things in your previous life, somethings. Department --\napartment, education system, something like this. But the problem was th -- the -- that\nthey did not let them go, and the problem was true because they did not o -- they di-did\nnot honor your right to exercise your roots, you religion.",
        "A: And this is the problem. And what I want for -- what I just -- I don\u2019t know, if you goes to\nthe -- I -- I want just mention one thing, that when I came here, so my first job was also\nwe have to find something to live, so I start to working for shipping receiving. And 1n the\n-- in the store -- in store, 1s it -- they sell some equipment for the kitchen.

        "A: -- civil rights, and he remembered his family was very, very in -- in this movement. And\nhe was actually this very gift -- gifted guy. He was smart, he listened, he was li -- good\nvery listener and -- and I said, \u201cI would like to know actually, when you go to school,\nthese people -- people in your country, they -- they know what is the advantage to live in\nAmerica. Why people from around the world actually try -- want to come to here and stay\nhere?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no one -- I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember even one lesson that my\nteacher told me what is the advantage, what we have here.\u201d If you don\u2019t have -- if you\ndon\u2019t teach them what is the advantage, so -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- is not the best things\nto do because they -- they don\u2019t value what they have. This is the --",
        "A: Yeah, I told him, I told him -- well, I told him a ver -- very simple story. I said to him --\nyou know, when it -- I remember this time when it was little bit idea that we had to bring\nAmerican experience to the Russian. It was some government decision, it was time. In\nthis time -- and I remember that one -- once -- one -- he was the guy, his was\n[indecipherable] that he came from very rich sugar production family before revolution\n[indecipherable] was here. So he came to -- and they invite him to introduce some people\n[indecipherable] to the American life, to the style, and he said, \u201cIf you will tell American\nthat,\u201d -- Russian has this word like [indecipherable] or president, they call 1t prepeeska.\nOh stop, forgot about [indecipherable] that your lifestyle is good, because American\ncannot understand what is it. It\u2019s like [indecipherable] even accept it.
