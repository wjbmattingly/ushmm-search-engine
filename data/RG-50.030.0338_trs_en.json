        "Question: Will you begin by telling me your name, date of birth and where you were born?",
        "Answer: My name is Simon Federman. I was born in Paris, France, on March 1, 1926.\nQ. Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.\nA. Before the war, my parents originally came from Poland, in the beginning of the 1920s.\nMy father was a watchmaker, jeweler. We had a very modest life because he never made a lot of\nmoney, but it was a quiet simple life. I had three sisters. One of them passed away. We were\nnot religious people, maybe the reason was it wasn't very easy in Paris in those years to buy\nkosher food. It would have been an effort. My mother stopped after a little while to go to a\nsmall Jewish section of Paris to buy kosher food. So, we started to live like everybody in the\nneighborhood without being kosher, and our religion was not very, very important in our\nhousehold. During the 1930s, even I being a young boy, listening to the radios, reading some\nnewspapers, hearing my parents when they were talking, we heard what was going on in\nGermany. You know, we were religious, but we still were very Jewish. I knew personally some\nof the tradition. I knew some of the holidays, but I never went to synagogue. But this being\nJewish I knew it and I felt it; I was Jewish. What was going on in Germany touched us. In the\nlater 30s I started to see some people coming from Germany, and they were Jews who were\nrunning away. I was hearing some of the hardship they had in the country. But it didn't you\nknow it was something I heard, but I didn't feel it. I was too young, but I knew about it. In\n1939, just before the war, I was listening to the radio like most of the people and we heard that\nthere might be a war against Germany. Germany attacked Poland, there might be a war, but we\ndidn't have to worry about it because we were so strong. France was so strong, that if Germany\never they are doing anything, we would run over them in a very short time. And all this was lies.\nBut we believed it. Every single day we heard that propaganda And the poor folks everything\nwas a lie, because it took the German army to conquer France in a couple weeks.\nQ. In Paris you went to a public school?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And were you friends very mixed?\nA. Mixed?\nQ. Catholic, Jewish.\nA. Mixed, that's how religion is because we didn't have any allies, we didn't have any black\npeople, because before the war it was very rare when you saw a black person in the street. So,\nwhen we talk about mix, it was religion. But like I say, I didn't feel any different between the\nChristian and me. Enough of this, I have the feeling it never went to their mind that I was\ndifferent than they were. Because we were a small minority, and as long as they knew that I was\nborn in Paris. I spoke like them. I didn't have any accent, so I must have been in their mind, I'm\nsure, they must have thought I was like them, a Christian. Even when I was in the Army, it never\nwent to their mind that I could have been different. That's how religion was. My mannerism and\neverything was Parisian.\nQ. You never were aware of anti-semitism as a boy?\nA. I knew it existed because I knew how you know sometime when people were arguing or\nfighting they said to somebody else, you know, he's a dirty Jew. But I don't know, but it never\nwas addressed to me, because I don't want to sound macho, but I wouldn't have tolerated it. So,\nthey did nothing to me. I already didn't feel anti-semitism. I didn't feel anything like that when I\nwas a young kid in school. I was like anybody else.\nQ. What do you remember about the Germany occupation, the first days?\nA. What I remember is I really saw the Germans in 1940. I didn't see them in 1939, because\nwhen the war started my father was called into the army and like the result of all that propaganda\nand all this they mobilized a million people, but they were not ready for it. My father had half of\na uniform, no guns, sleeping in the subway. You know, this was supposed to be the 12 median\nFrench army. So, the commander decided, and I think in the end of 1939, tried to evacuate\nwomen and children from Paris. Not because we didn't know you know the Germans were going\nto bomb Paris, whatever, so they decided -- and also I remember in school they gave us some gas\nmasks, that you were supposed to carry at all times with our gas masks 1n it. Like I was saying\nbefore, they decided to evacuate women and children and we were to register, the women and\nchildren, and they send us out I think about 100 miles from Paris, in small little villages. And\nthis is where my mother, my sister and myself went. It lasted a few months, until the Germans\nreally had their offensive. One day the offensive, they had a big offensive all of a sudden they\nare finally I think they realized they had so many men in the army, but they didn't have anything\nto give them. So, what they did, they released my father who had four children. When my father\nwas released, the first thing he did was go into the village where we were. When he got there, he\nheard on the radio where the German army is advancing and the French government did\nsomething also not very smart. They made a call over the radio that all men 13 years old must\ntry to move to to reform and fight the Germans there. I never saw a gun in my\nlife. I'm 13 and they're going to make me fight there. But, we decided the Germans are not\ngoing to catch us. We didn't have any transport. We didn't have anything, we started to work,\nand we found some trucks going by or whatever and we got a lift. We got to a train station and\nthen we tried to get on the train, and we finally got to .\nQ. When was this?\nA. 1940.\nQ. In June?\nA. I think it was the early part of 1940, maybe in June. May, June, I don't remember very\nwell. It wasn't very cold.\nQ. But you hadn't yet seen Germans coming in?\nA. I didn't see them. We knew while we were on the road going to we saw\nthe plane bombing us. You know you had thousands and thousands of refugees, you know, the\nfarmer was there with his animals. We had people on bicycles, people walking. You're talking\nabout people on the and all of a sudden you saw those German plane come in, he\nstarted shooting. So, my father, we finally reached the salt mines, and we met another refugee\nlike this and talking to them, some of them were Jewish, and they said we are going over to\nPurinae, over to Spain. If you have anybody in the United States, try to reach Lisbon. The\nAmerican consulate will try to get you some papers to reach America. So, my father had a\nbrother there in New York. So, we said, Okay, let's try it. When we got to the border we were\nstopped. We said okay, we are going to go in Spain but what's going to end up with my mother\nand sisters. I cannot abandon them. So, we decided to go back. We couldn't leave my mother.\nSo, we decided to go back because we could not abandon my mother and sisters. And then\nFrance was divided. Already the German army stopped in the middle of France with an\narmistice and the northern part, the Germans were there, and the southern part was the Vichy\ngovernment. So, I don't remember exactly the date, but we got on board a train and got back to\nParis. In the meantime, my mother and sisters were back into Paris, and when I got to the border\nbetween South France, northern part, this is when I saw the Germans for the first time. They\nwent to the train, but it wasn't that important because he had so many people trying to get back to\ntheir home, so they didn't look at us too close. We got into Paris.\nQ. Was it frightening to see the German presence?\nA. No, not at all. It was orders and that's it.\nQ. Was it fairly easy to go back and forth between Vichy and --?\nA. It was not easy. It was not easy because after that you need a visa, which we are talking a\nfew days after the armistice was signed. So, I really don't think they were organized to really put\na lot of control, you know, between the north and the south. So, we got into Paris and then life\nwent back more or less normal. You saw Germans in the streets of Paris. All of a sudden a few\nmonths later, I think it was the beginning of 1941, all of a sudden we were told if we were a Jew,\nwe had to register. We had to go to what we called police, you know the man in\nthe police station to register as Jews. But not really knowing what anti-semitism was, so we\nreally didn't care. If you want to know if we are Jews, we are Jews. We went there and there\nwere lines of people who registered. I think at that time they put a stamp on our identification\ncard, because every French person must have an identity card, and they gave us a gold star, a\nJewish star, the Star of David. They told us you must put it on your clothes. And also, certain\nrestrictions. If we took the subway, we were to go only in the last wagon. We were not allowed\nto go to public places. So, my mother sewed my clothes, the Jewish star. The next day, I told\nmy mother, take it off, please. She said, no why? I said, nothing doing. I said if they are going\nto decide to pick me up, I'm not going to make it easy for them. You know, I don't look exactly\nlike what the Germans think a Jew looks like, you know with the big nose and things like that. I\nsaid no. After arguing for a little while, she took it off. I could not accept those restrictions. I\nwanted to be able to go into a park. I want to get into a move. I was young. The danger was not\nthat great. And after that, we noticed something else. They were starting to pick up Jews, but\nthey were picking up mostly foreign Jews. We noticed what they were doing, they knew people\nwere coming back from work at 6:00 at night, so they were closing off streets not far from the\nmain subway stations. So, I worked out with my father. I said I'll go at the time he was\nsupposed to come back home, and I will walk in front of him about 1,500 hundred feet. If I saw\nthem, closing the street I being a young fellow, I could run pretty fast in those days, I was\nrunning back and I would have told him and we would have taken another way of going home.\nThis is what we did for a while.\nQ. Now, let me ask you something. You were born in Paris?\nA. Yes.\nQ. But your parents were not born --?\nA. My parents were born in Poland.\nQ. Would they have been vulnerable to the roundups?\nA. No, no, because you see lucky for us, my father and my mother thought Poland is not for\nthem. They were born there and they saw the anti-semitism. They saw how bad it was for the\nJews in Poland. So, one day they decided to -- the original idea was to go to America, but they\ncouldn't get a visa. In France, in the early 20s needed people to work in the mines in northern\nFrance, to work in the factories, things like that, so they were letting foreigners come to do the\nwork that Frenchman would not do. So, my father got a job with Renault. He had in mind, I\ncan't go to America, I'm going to stay in France. I might as well try to become a Frenchman. I\nhave the privilege and obligation of a citizen. I don't want to be a foreigner in a country. So,\nwhat he did, after a couple of years, he applied for citizenship and he was a Frenchman and my\nmother and this is what French people do. Being born would have made me a Frenchman, but\nstill they were Jewish. So, you know, they were picking on the foreign Jews more or less, but we\nknew it was a matter of time for us. So, this was our life from about 1941 to 1942.\nQ. Were you in school?\nA. I was in school. I was in school but they were looking for trouble. They give us all the\ntime in school. I couldn't continue with certain things. They put me in another school, some\nkind of what do you call, trade school. They really tried to get us out all the time. This was until\n1942. In the beginning of 1942, I think the end of June or the beginning of July, all of a sudden\nwe heard it was going to be bad for the Jews. We already had all those laws. We had all those\nrestrictions, and talking to some older fellows they told me a little bit more about it. They said\nthey know from somebody in the police department they messed up picking up the Jews of Paris.\nI think it was the 14th of 15th of July all of a sudden I was told to warn the Jews in my\nneighborhood that I knew, they were coming to pick up the Jews. But they are going to pick up\nthe men and the boys. This is what they are going to pick up. So, they asked me to warn\nanybody I knew. Those people must have been from the resistance, I don't know where, but they\nhad the knowledge I didn't have, and they told me, they asked me to do it. So, I started to tell\neverybody I knew. I chose men and boys and on the 15th it will happen. So, again you warn\neverybody. So, a lot of men with their sons who believed it will happen, who believed us, they\ntried to find a place to hide and to see what will happen. I went with my older sister, -- let me go\nback to something. Let me go back to something else. It was getting very bad in Paris in the\nbeginning of 1942, and we knew two people that we had contact with, the Germans are really\ngoing to go after us, with the help of the French police. So some people started to organize a\nway of getting out of the occupied zone into the free zone and those people were helping people\nto go to the free zone where what we called , people who were passing people on\nthe other side. Some did it for money. Some did it because they wanted to help. So, when we\nsaw what was going on, the first thing we did was try to get my father out. Because I was a\nyoung boy, we figured they are going to get the man, so we spoke to one of those ;\nand we worked out some kind of deal within and my father left. It must have been the end of\nJune and on July 16th my father was gone. So, it was my older sister we went to sleep in a\nChristian's home because we were told they were going to pick up the Jews in Paris on the 16th.\nDuring the night I heard a lot of noise, and I looked through a window and I saw the police\ndragging children, with little bundles. So I saw the French police dragging little kids with their\nmother, little bundles in the street taking them I didn't know where, but I saw them, you know, at\nnight, coming out of buildings and walking in the middle of the street with those French police\naround them. The mothers crying and I was so shocked, because we were expecting them to\npick up men, and they picked up the women and small children, everybody. Lucky for us, we\nwere French citizens. In our building there were a few Jewish families and they were going from\none apartment, they must have got a list of maybe not a list. They went from one apartment to\nanother, and they knocked at my mother's door. When she opened the door she had a Jewish star\non it and they asked her for some identity car and she showed an identity card, she was French.\nQ. You were talking about the police came in and your mother showed them her identity\ncard.\nA. Yes, and because on this particular night they didn't pick up French women. This is how\nwe were lucky to survive that particular night. But we decided that we must get out of Paris\nbecause today they would find Jews and tomorrow maybe it would be us. So, what we did was\nwe tried to get into contact with a man who helped my father go to the other side, but he\ndisappeared. Either he was caught or he wouldn't do it anymore, but we had an idea of what it\ntook to go to the other side. So, we decided and my mother and my two little sisters would go\nfirst because if we all disappeared in one shot or whatever, it will be too visible. So we planned\nit that they were going to go on a vacation and my older sister would stay, but we closed up the\nplace as best we could after they are gone. So, they left, to the train to a certain city, I don't\nremember the name a few miles to the identification line, and they got to that small little town,\nand the next morning they started to walk. They were a couple miles from what was supposed to\nbe the free zone, and they were walking early in the morning and a Frenchman came by with a\nbicycle. He looked at them and he knew the way they looked that they were not from the region.\nSo, the walk was leading right to the other side so he asked my mother if she wanted him to take\nthe two kids on his bike and put it on the hood. My little sister was three years old and the other\none was seven, eight years old and they couldn't walk that well. So, she really didn't feel like it,\nbut she accepted it. And she found the fellow with the two children a couple miles down the\nroad waiting for my mother. Because he wasn't going to cross over to the other side. So, he said\nwalk over a little bit over there and the next village you see will be in the free zone. So, they got\nto a field and saw the village and my mother told my sisters start running and don't stop until you\nget over there. And this is what they did. My little sister was so small that they just cut the\nwheat, they cut it so they had the little stump left so 1t was catching up her little pants, so my\nsister grabbed her and ran with her. All of a sudden my mother a patrol, a German patrol came\nby and stopped my mother and they already had two women, Frenchwomen arrested there\nbecause some Christians were also trying to get to the other side to see their family. And to go to\nthe other side you needed a special pass and something, so they arrested those two women, and\nthat German soldier got my mother and said what are you doing. She's says I'm on vacation.\nAnd she said my children are running in the field over there. I want my children. I want to get\nthem. So he said show me what you have in your pocketbook. She opened up her pocketbook\nand what she had was a piece of paper from a hospital in Paris and the name of the hospital in\nParis was . The little French she knew he could understand sick children,\nhospital for sick children. She said, see my children are sick, on vacation, so I don't think he was\na very hard man. He said go ahead and get your children and come right back. So, she was\nlucky. She went to the other side.\nQ. Did you mother wear the Jewish star?\nA. In Paris yes, but when she left she did not wear it because she knew she couldn't be\nJewish to go over there. A few days later it was my turn to leave Paris. So, what we did with my\nsister we packed what we could, big bundles and boarded this train station to be shipped to South\nFrance where my father already was.\nQ. You had gotten communication from him?\nA. Yes, we got letters. So, we thought with my sister to go the same route. It was the only\nroute we knew. We were very lucky because we got to that small little town. I don't remember\nthe name and we spent the night -- I don't remember if 1t was a motel or whatever -- and 5:00 in\nthe morning we left, we walked. We heard motor cycle patrols, and so when we heard it we got\nout of the road and went to the field. We turned down so much that we didn't know what the free\nside was. So, I told my sister I saw somebody in the field, I told my sister you stay right here\nand I'm going to run over and ask him where am I. So, I ran over and I asked him and he said\nyou are standing right here on the free zone. So, I waved my sister and she came on in and we\ngot to the village and when we got to the village, the French asked us what are we\ndoing here. We said we are Jews and we left the occupied zone. But being French citizens, he\ncouldn't do anything. This particular guy couldn't do anything. So, we took a train and changing\ntrains and all this it took us about seven or eight hours until we got to , and we\nfind my father there.\nQ. Let me just ask you a question. When you were all in Paris together after your father\nleft, how did you make decisions? Did you as the boy, even though you were very young, feel\nresponsible?\nA. Always and I stayed the rest of my life. My father was a wonderful man, but he was an\neasy going man. He wasn't making an important decision didn't come easy to him. I being\nyoung I didn't have the vision that he had for me making a decision was easy. I started to make\ndecision in -- I started with my father -- I pushed him to go back to Paris when we were in\nFrance, and from this day on I kept making decisions to this day. All of a sudden I wasn't\nanymore a child, I was responsible for what was my family. This is the way it was. I never had\na childhood. I was a man in 24 hours. We got, like I said, we got into , and we\nstarted the best we could. My father found a small apartment, two room apartment with six\npeople. So, at night we were opening the beds and in the morning we were closing them. The\ntoilet was in the hall. But the hardest part was finding food. Because we didn't know anybody in\nthe city of . People knew each other. They were born that way. They had a\nway of getting food more or less at no price. We had to buy everything on black market. We\nwere not rich people.\nQ. You couldn't just go to a local store?\nA. You needed the coupons. You needed the food rations. You couldn't. So what you\ncould buy was nothing without coupons. Everything else was black market, and we didn't have\nany contact.\nQ. And the coupons that you had would have been from Paris were different?\nA. No, no, we registered through the department that was taking care of that. We were\ngetting so many coupons for the months. And it was very hard because it was so hard as my\nsister was about seven or eight years old. We had to pick her up in school she was fainting from\nhunger. It was tough. Later on we met some contacts and we knew a little bit more so we could\nget some kind of food, but in the beginning it was terrible. It was not only us, it must have been\nquite a few people that ran away from the northern part. I'm sure it wasn't easy for the local\npeople, but it was a little bit easier than us because they knew how to get stuff. So, it was like\nthat until I don't remember exactly when the German army came in. It wasn't too long, but a lot\nof people went to , Nice, the eastern side of Southern France because it was\noccupied by Italians, the Italian Army. the Italians were not bad. For instance, they were not the\nGermans. They didn't have the hatred against the Jews that the Germans had. So what we did in\nwe had to go somewhere, go where the Italians are. And also, a lot of people\nwere trying to go to that eastern part of Southern France because from there some tried to get to\nSwitzerland. Some were lucky enough and some of them were rejected by the police army or\ncustom. But when the Germans decided it was time, all of a sudden they invaded the rest of\nFrance and I am sure they were very unhappy with the Italians who were not tough enough with\nus. So, then after a little while when I was in , | met somebody that I knew who\nasked me if I wanted to do some work for the resistance.\nQ. This was when?\nA. It was in 1943. So, I said yes. And we started through there and people who were\ndeporting were not going to be deported. They were ready to work, like we heard about work\nbecause the Germans all of a sudden I think in 1940 they asked for a French man to go and work\nfor them to build the Atlantic wall and things like that so working for the Germans was\nsomething the Germans were looking for because their men were in the Army. So, for a little\nwhile we had the illusion that they were taking people to go to work. But in 1943 we heard\nstories that they were deporting Jews to kill them. This was in 1943. It's not like people were\nsaying we never knew. In America they didn't know they were killing Jews. We knew already\nin 1943. What date, I don't remember what we were told they were deporting Jews and killing\nthem. How they were killing them we didn't know, but the objective was to get rid of the Jews.\nSo, this is why it makes me feel I must do something. And, I was 16 or 17 years old. I don't\nthink of I was really conscious of the danger. To me, now, if somebody would say I was talking\neasy the two men I already had in mind would never get me alive over there, and I meant it. To\nme that you know was not something I could be scared of. It was part of the time. Now, I'll be\ncareful on the street. I don't go to Manhattan too often, but in those days this was the age when I\nwasn't afraid. They asked me, so they asked me if I wanted to go in and try to collect some\nmoney and help people who will go by the city of to find them a place safe to stay\nand if I wanted to do some counter propaganda the German and Vishi government was doing.\nBecause you saw quite often in the street in the city big posters with the face of a man who\nlooked unshaved and things like that, and they were saying those are the terrorists who are doing\nthis and this and this. Putting bombs and so on and so forth. Usually they were Jewish names or\nSpanish names. The poster was saying the trouble we have in this country are not the French\npeople, a bunch of foreigners who are the terrorists. Those are the people, and usually those\npeople were people who already shot or hanged. So, they asked me we have to do something to\ncounter propaganda. So, what they were doing they were buying these tickets with one sentence,\n\"Die for France.\" They asked me to go to every post I could and put the sticker on. We usually\nwere working two fellows. One watching and one putting the sticker and vice versa. One day, I\nwas supposed to meet somebody, somebody was going to work with me and he was going to\nbring me the sticker. Somebody was going to bring him the stickers. I went to the point. He\nwasn't there. I waited, waited. He wasn't there. So, I went to him and going on I saw my sister\ncoming in the street. I asked her what are you doing here you're supposed to be ata movie. She\nsaid, oh when we got to the movie you know there was line and we didn't want to wait. She\nstarted to give me some kind of story, but I knew her. I looked at her and all of a sudden I said, I\nnoticed she had a package under her arm. I said what do you have there? She said nothing.\nNothing, I said show me. She was a year and a half older than I was, but I was still the boy of\nthe family. I said show me. And I saw the stickers. She was supposed to go to work with\nsomebody else who didn't show up also. She had a sticker and this is all around and my sister\nwas working for the resistance. So, when I saw the sticker I said as long as you have the sticker\nlet's go. So, it was even easier with her than with the fellow I was working with, because with\nher I was pushing her against the wall where the sticker was and I was making believe the I was\nkissing her and was putting the sticker right in her back. And in France you know, of course I\ndon't know if it is now, but seeing a couple against the wall kissing was not something unusual.\nSo, it made it easier. I was surprised that my sister was doing this because she never told me,\nand I never told her either.\nQ. So your parents didn't know you were involved in the resistance?\nA. No. They would have been scared. Like I said, I wouldn't talk to my sister either\nbecause I really didn't want her to be involved. Once we knew I never worked again with her,\nbut I knew she had her own job.\nQ. Did you talk about your work to her?\nA. No.\nQ. Not at all?\nA. No. Because we really didn't know what our work was going to be. I didn't know.\nSometime I was getting some money I was getting it to somebody else who was going to collect\nit. Sometimes I was getting some small arms. Sometime I was getting a little bundle with false\ni.d.s, you know because the printers were printing false 1.d.s or they were stealing them when\nthey were making identification cards for the police department and keeping part of it, but we\ntook it to somebody else who was using it to make something else. I was sometime getting some\nstamps from different police departments. All this, I was some kind of point where people bring\nsomething to me and I was giving it to somebody else. The only thing I kept after a while was a\nhandgun. And they didn't mind, and I never knew who was going to show us. We had some\nway of knowing when somebody, but I didn't know who. For instance, we had somebody\ncoming and telling me we had some training. Some small arm use, some kind of what would\nhappen if we were fighting in the street and we were getting some kind of training, not much, but\nsome kind of training, and the training we were getting usually there is an avenue there 1s a river,\nthe River goes there and this particular part of is some kind of\nisland and that island which was very quiet where we could go two or three fellows we're going\nto start there and talk. We couldn't use any arms, but we could dismantle the things like that.\nThis is where we were getting this training during the occupation. I never asked them where\nthey came from. If they were from a Jewish underground or a communist underground. It was\nnever part of my mind. They were part of the resistance and that's it. The only thing I had in\nmind was resistance against the Nazis.\nQ. So you never joined one resistance group or another?\nA. No, I found out really just before the Russians, the people were doing and I was part of\nthe FFI. We never talked about politics. We never talked about religion. We were there to help\nand do what we could do. We'll help without a Jew going by who needed a place to stay or a\nration card, but it didn't make any difference to us.\nQ. Did you know who your leaders were?\nA. No, I never knew.\nQ. Did you know how large the organization?\nA. No, never knew. After the war, I found out it was pretty large. There were only small\ngroups, because you know if they would have caught us, we couldn't say anything. Like I say, I\nknew a few people in the city, that's it. They were coming and talking to me and asking me if I\ncould do that and so on and so forth. But I never knew that Gold was the leader. I didn't know\nthe . It didn't make any difference to me anyway. I was just resisting the\nGermans. And in 1943, I think it was in 1943, I don't know what month, it got pretty bad also\nand the people from the resistance, the people I spoke to said listen we have to try to save the\nchildren.\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2\nQ. I think you were talking about --\nA. I think I was starting to say in 1943, the people I knew in the resistance told us it is\nbecoming harder for the Jews in France so what we are to try to do is to save the children. So,\nthey asked me and I asked my parents if it's okay to have them take the little children and give it\nto somebody in the resistance who is going to place them somewhere where they are going to be\nsafe. It was very hard for my parents. For me, I said sure, they're going to be safe, why not?\nBut for my parents this was very hard. My little sister was three years old. The other one nine.\nWe talked about and we said we might have a chance to survive, but why not give them a\nchance. So, what we accepted the offer from the resistance and one day a woman, if I remember\nwell, an Italian Frenchwoman came down and she says I'm going to take them and we wanted to\nbe safe and also it was with one of my sisters fainting from hunger we decided it would be a\ngood idea. We tried to teach my little sister, three years old to call that woman Mommy. The\nolder one it was easy. Before they left my mother sewed in I think in their lining, in the bottom\nof her skirt a piece of paper with the name and the address of my uncle in the United States. We\ntold my older sister, the nine year old. We told her if the war stopped and we're not around, get\nin contact with your uncle. And they left. We didn't know where they were.\nQ. Your parents must have been --\nA. I'm a father myself so I can imagine how tough it was for them. So even without any\nchildren you can imagine how it is to give away, giving those two little children up not knowing\nwhere they were. Because it was always the same story, life in the resistance we didn't know too\nmany people because in case we were caught, the same thing with that. We couldn't know where\nthey were because if something would happen to us, we couldn't tell. So, this is what we did.\nWe found out later on they were taken to a small little village in the mountains of\n, and I think the name was . That particular region\n, and I had the feeling I was told the farmers that there were young\nchildren from the big cities undernourished and they are here to get better food, better air. But I\ndon't think we fooled them. They didn't say anything and never mentioned anything and never\ntook my sisters to church. They took them to school, but they never took them to church. So, I\nalready had the feeling that they knew what they were dealing with. And they were safe like that\nuntil liberation. And I was told where they were and I went there to pick them up.\nQ. By the resistance?\nA. What?\nQ. The resistance then told you where they were?\nA. Oh, yes, they were the only ones who knew.\nQ. But you didn't know who the resistance was?\nA. But the people we were dealing with, they got in contact. We were in contact in end we\nwere in contact almost every day with different people in our little group. And one of them\nknew somebody who knew where they took them.\nQ. Did you initiate that or did certain people come to you and say do you want us to save\nyour sisters?\nA. No, they give us that option. I didn't know that option existed. I couldn't go to somebody\nand say what can you do for my sisters or even for myself. They came to us and told us there is a\nway to save the children if something should happen to us.\nQ. What did they think -- what was the idea that might happen to you?\nA. Being caught by the Germans and be deported, being killed. For instance, my sisters,\nokay, they were saved. They were safer over there in the mountain, but we were in the city. And\nI don't remember the date, but they started to pick up the Jews of . SO,\nnow we had the problem what to do. For me it was easier. I was a young fellow, so I could find\nplaces that were safe where I could sleep, I could stay. But my sister was a bit older than I was.\nHer being a girl she couldn't sleep like that. Once in a while I slept outside, because you know a\nsafe place, I didn't have any room. The first thing, when we had a safe place, it was my parents.\nSo, the resistance again, somebody from the resistance I was talking to told us there 1s a way we\ncan help, having my sister go into a convent. This was already at the end of 1943, or the\nbeginning of '44. We said okay. So, they talked to the Mother Superior and she accepted it. So,\nmy sister went into a convent. But you know all the sisters, everybody was going to mass except\nmy sister, so you know when they were asking they never tried to convert her. They never tried\nto put any question on her, and the only one who really knew for sure was the Mother Superior\nand one other sister said why doesn't she go so the Mother Superior told one day I will tell you.\nBut it never bothered her not going to mass. I think they figured it out by themselves.\nQ. I'm surprised that she didn't go to mass just in case somebody else would find out.\nA. No, because she was in a convent. She was not outside going to church.\nQ. But couldn't the Germans come in even to the convent?\nA. They could but they never did it. They never did that.\nQ. So, your sister was placed in a convent, and you and your parents were still at large?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What did you do every day?\nA. What I found -- I found a job. I had a little training as an office machine mechanic. I\nwent to a small business who was dealing in that kind of machines, calculators and that type and\nso on and so forth, and I told him I had some small training, can he use me. So, the first thing he\ndid was call in the labor department to find out if he could hire a Jew. Because I never hidden --\nwhen I really had to deal with people, I didn't volunteer but I never hidden. And also, the\nquestion was what are you doing with your accent, your Parisian accent here? So, I told them the\ntruth. I left over there because I'm a Jew. So, [had ajob. My father being a watchmaker,\njeweler, he was working for different stores, going there and doing some repairs. So, this 1s how\nwe were making a living.\nQ. In between you were trying to help the resistance?\nA. Oh, yes, yes. Somebody in the resistance knew we existed so when somebody needed\nsome help going by , they had our name. We helped them either if we could get\nthem some false 1.d.s or if we could get them some ration cards, or we find them a place to sleep.\nThey were going to wherever they wanted to go, to Marseilles, or wherever they were trying to\nreach.\nQ. When you say we, you're just talking about you and a few others?\nA. Few, everybody I knew, and I'm sure what I was doing must have been repeated by the\ngroup.\nQ. Did you have, I know you didn't know who your overall leaders were but was there one\nperson who supervised you or told you what to do?\nA. There was one guy seemed to have more information that we did. He was telling us, he\nwas telling assignment tomorrow somebody is going to be you know. He was between us and\nsomebody else. He knew while we were talking about maybe leaving the city and maybe going\nup to the mountains to the Marque to join you know a lot of groups of different men who were\nfighting more or less organized with a heavy weapon. Weapons they were getting from either\ndropped by the Allies or stolen from different places, but they decided to keep us in the city.\nThey needed us in the city, so we never went really to join those people in the mountains.\nQ. Was that something you wanted to do?\nA. I was going to do anything. I was going to anything as long as it was fighting against the\nGermans. I don't think I was thinking too clearly, but sometimes I was sticking my neck out\nwhere I shouldn't. All of a sudden while I was working in the little shop over there, a young\nGerman soldier came in with his gun, with everything, and he had a typewriter and he asked my\nboss if he could use the shop to repair the typewriter. So, my boss was not going to refuse him.\nHe said, sure. So, that younger fellow who we give him a place on the bench and he started to\nlook at the typewriter and he couldn't communicate in French, but my Yiddish came back. You\nknow, so I started to say a few words of Yiddish and he understood some of it and I understood\nsome of his Germans. So we got a little bit friendlier and he told me story. He was a young\nfellow. He must have been 18 or 19 years old and he was from Austria and in the shop it was\nalready turning bad for the Germans. So, in that shop we had a map of Italy and we were\npointing every day the advance of the Allied army in Italy. He was looking at it. One day I told\nhim I said they are going to be there very soon. I said what are you going to do? He said I don't\nknow. They might send me , might send me somewhere, some place. I said why\ndon't they keep quiet and stay somewhere here, in France. It came out of my mind without even\nthinking. He was a nice fellow he said I wish I could. I will always remember his name. His\nname was , something like that, but I stuck my neck out really without thinking.\nSo, that gives you an idea of my state of mind. I wasn't afraid because of the age or whatever it\nwas at the time. You couldn't really be afraid. When it came to finding hiding places, this must\nhave been in somewhere in the beginning of 1944 just before the landing of the Allies in\nNormandy and thinking about landing in South France, they started bombing. They were\nbombing a lot because it was a railroad turnaround, and by coincidence, it was almost 1n the\nmiddle of the city. But they were bombing almost halfway there like clockwork. What they did,\nthe government of , the castle of the French pope was a wall about four or five\nfoot thick. They opened it up and we could stay inside and sleep inside in those rooms because\nof bombings. So, for me it was beautiful because a lot of French people were going there to\navoid the bombing before me. It was somewhere without really to hide. Also, it got to the point\nwhere we got so used to the bombing so sometime we were looking if I was with a friend, we\nwere looking at the planes coming over and we were already figuring if they were released now,\nthe Germans had this from somebody else. But you know being afraid now, it's amazing how\nyou lose fear. It's part of the daily routine and we were watching them and first the Red Cross\nfor some kind of hideout or whatever after the bombs were coming down. Also,\nthey asked me -- and also the French government was kind to ask us, if anybody to help the\npeople after the bombing, because sometime a lot of the people were killed. So, we had to go\nthere and try to dig them out, but everytime we heard a plane coming, a lot of people were\ncursing. We were happy because while the bombs were falling, they didn't worry about us. For\nus, everytime we saw those planes coming it was a closer day to liberation. Sure, we could have\nbeen killed but for us it was a relief. We knew it was stopping the Germans and\nof getting us. So, you know it was a very strange atmosphere in those days.\nQ. Did you get information from outside of ? Did you get a radio\nbroadcast or?\nA. We were listening to all those ears, the information we were getting was from the BBC. I\ndon't remember exactly at what hour, but we made it our business to listen. This was all the\ninformation we got because everything else we got from the French government were lies. But\nthe BBC was the life line to the news.\nQ. Back to this resistance organization that you were involved in. I know you said you\ndidn't know too much about the organization, but what can you tell me in more detail the sorts of\nthings you did for them and how you got what you got and where you took it and that sort of\nthing?\nA. Usually, you know it might not be very dramatic, usually I was collecting stuff from\npeople.\nQ. From what people?\nA. Other people from the resistance who were bringing me a package with for instance,\nsmall arms, or a package of propaganda material or a package of ration cards, something like that\nwas brought to me. And somebody else was picking it up from me. See, this was a thing. I\ndidn't do anything heroic, you know, but it was part of my job. And also, about close to the end\nbefore the liberation all of a sudden so many railroad tracks were blown up. So much sabotage\nwas done, all of a sudden the Germans had a bright idea of saying that all men and I don't\nremember from what age must report every night and watch the railroad track and put our men\nevery 50 meters, every 100 meters. And you must go there and if something should happen,\nyou're responsible. So, I think I was too young. My father was called. That's when I said to my\nfather, it's crazy. First of all, some of my groups are going to blow it up anyway, and how can\nyou be responsible for something like that. You're already hiding so don't go. What are they\ngoing to do? There's nothing they can do, you know, you are not there.\nQ. So your father, at this point, knew you were involved with the resistance?\nA. Yes. At that point he knew it. He knew it from the moment we spoke about sending\naway my sisters. Then he knew. So, it didn't go watch those tracks and a lot of other things\nhappened and we by the end were told to watch anything going on. If there is any train\norganized with people in it, to make sure that those trains would not go through. This was our\njob so I hate to see anything going on, something different in the city. We were watching to see\nif the Germans were not moving too much, and little by little we say them disappearing, because\nwe didn't have any big fighter on there. You see, when they came to France, the first time when\nI saw them, in the street of Paris, where you saw young guys must have been in their 20s, strong\nyoung guy, when they left, what do you see, old men pushing carriages with their belongings in\nit walking. A young kid maybe 14 of 15 years old because they must have used the army\nsomewhere in a different front before the occupation they took anything. You know, what a\ndifference between an army and a retreat. So we saw them but we didn't\nsee any big fight.\nQ. Was there a pretty large German presence?\nA. For a little while, yes. For a little while they were all there. Every time we turned around\nthere was a German there.\nQ. And Vichy police as well?\nA. Oh, yes. Not only the Vichy police but we had different kinds of police. You had the\npolice of the city, you had the with the Nationals and it was part of it the\nmunitions. Those were the worst collaborators there is. They were the ones doing the dirty job.\nYou know they were working with the Gestapo. So, we had to be careful of a lot of different\norganizations.\nQ. Did you see when you were living in the south Jews being taken away or people being\nbeaten or any of that sort of thing?\nA. Beaten in front of me, no, but being grabbed and thrown into a car and taken away, yes.\nThis I saw it. I saw it quite a few times. You know, because sometimes walking the street, all of\na sudden they were asking for identification paper, and the ones who didn't have the right kind\nthey were grabbing them and throwing them in the car and taking them away.\nQ. Did you feel that you had any real close calls?\nA. Oh, yes. Yes, I had a very close call. I was working with a fellow, and he had some\npropaganda stuff he was supposed to give me. What he did, he did something very, very stupid.\nHe picked it up from somewhere, I don't remember where and he had it on his back. In those\ndays, you know, there were no cars. So, everything was bikes and we had what we called bike\ngarages, and those bike garages were in the courtyard inside of a building. So, he says I'll wait\nover there and I will give it to you. We walked and I said go ahead and pick up your bike and I\nwas waiting outside. As soon as he got in, I saw them, either the police or the Gestapo and they\ngrabbed him. When I saw them, the only thing I could do was turn around. They called me, but\nI wasn't going to stop for them, so it was a very close call. Another time I had another friend, he\nwas arrested. Because in that particular day they picked up a lot of people. In that particular\nnight they were arresting quite a few young people, Jews and non-Jews. And that friend of mine\nthat was Jewish also was part of the resistance. He wasn't exactly what a German would have\nthought a Jew looked like. He was blonde, blue eyes. When they arrested him, in the meantime\nthey put him in the hotel and the next morning the Gestapo was coming or the ammunition or\nwhatever, and the same night another fellow I knew, wasn't Jewish was arrested also, and he told\nme the story. I wouldn't have believed it. What they did, they arrested so many young fellows\nthey put them in the courtyard of the hotel with a very big door with a big padlock. My friend\nwas a small little fellow. He must have been maybe 5'5\" or 5'6\" and he went to that padlock. He\nmust have been so desperate, he bolted and he run away, and other guys run away too. The other\nfellow I knew ---\nQ. You were talking about ?\nA. This fellow told me he saw it with his own eyes, a little guy like that breaking a big\npadlock like that. He wouldn't have believed it. And they all ran away. Because you see, he\nknew, he knew the next morning the Gestapo or whoever was going to interrogate him and ask\nhim and even with all this false paper, they would ask him to drop his pants down. And you\nknow in France, nobody was circumcised that was not Jewish. So, he must have been so\ndesperate that he did it. This is how the things were with the young people. We knew how bad\nit was for us to be caught and be deported.\nQ. Had you thought about going into real hiding?\nA. Never.\nQ. Why?\nA. I don't know. It wasn't in me. The only thing I thought was if they wanted me to go to\nthe . I was ready for that. But going into hiding, no. It was amazing. You see\nlike I say it was very hard to communicate this but I was born in France. I always felt\ncompletely free. Nobody is going to tell me really what to do. You see, maybe certain people\ncame from different countries, you know, like my father told me, in Poland sometime you know\nwhen they saw a soldier you know they would get off the sidewalks because they were afraid\nsomebody was going to hit them. They knew more about pogrom than I did. I never saw a\npogrom in my life. So this is what to me I think and it never went to my mind. I was hiding to\navoid being taken by the Germans but trying to find a place somewhere in a hole in the mountain\nor whatever, it wasn't in me.\nQ. Or to pretend you were catholic?\nA. I never did that. Even when I was in the army, they send me an , SO\none day, I will always remember, we went to a small little town in the mountain somewhere\naround , and the captain all of a sudden got the idea of everybody is going to go\non Sunday to mass. We had to get up early and we all go to church. I got up like anybody else\nbut when we got to church they all got in and you know kneel and cross themselves, I stayed at\nthe door. They asked me why don't you go in. I said I don't mind going in, but I'm Jewish. I\nnever volunteered. I never told them, they never asked me, but when it came the time to say it, I\nsaid it. They were all surprised because I was the only Jew in the whole unit. It never came to\ntheir mind that I could be different than they were as far as religion. During the war, it was the\nsame thing. IfI felt like I mentioned before, if I applied for a job, I didn't write I was Jewish.\nQ. Why not, wouldn't it have been easier?\nA. It would have been a lie. It wouldn't have been helpful. Because you see I was a Parisian\nwith a different accent. What was I doing in . You see? So, I told them that\nthere was no law against hiring a Jew and that's it. Maybe I wasn't smart. I don't know. But I\nnever did hide it. I didn't hide it in the army. I didn't hide it anyplace. The only thing I was\nhiding it when I had false papers.\nQ. Now, what did you get the false papers for? What did you need the false papers?\nA. For the resistance. For instance, they were stopping the people the in the street and\nasking for identity card and in France everybody has an identity card. So, the police a lot of\ntimes stopped you and asked you for an identity card. So, then I had a false identity. Sure, I\nwasn't telling them I was Jewish when I was showing them my identity card. If not, there was no\nreason.\nQ. Why wouldn't you use that same card for the man who was going to hire you or anything\nelse?\nA. You see, in France, I was missing something. In France for a young fellow, I don't know\nhow it is now, you needed a permit for a young man to go to work, and I didn't have that permit.\nI had it only in my name. The permit when I went from Paris. My name was Federman on the\npermit, it was not Richard. So, you know it was more involved, plus we needed the money to\nsurvive. I had to get ajob. You know, and where do you find, the resistance never, never\noffered any, you know, the false permit for children to go to work. So, this must be one of the\nreasons why I didn't use it.\nQ. Was it your sense that there were other Jewish members of the resistance --?\nA. Yes, yes because I knew some fellows that were Jewish, but 1t was never something you\nknow that important. Our main objective is to resist. That's how it is. We were willing to help\nanybody who was willing to resist, who was part of our resistance movement.\nQ. There were girls in the movement?\nA. Yes, my sister.\nQ. Did the girls have different kinds of jobs than the boys, different types of responsibilities?\nA. They must have because my sister never got any kind of training about fighting. You\nknow, and it's very hard now when I'm thinking about it, we never talked about it. We never\ntalked about the details about what she was doing and what I was doing. It's very hard to\nexplain, but we never talked about it. Like for quite some time we never talked about the details\nthat happened during the war. You know, I start to really talk about is when my kid got older.\nBut it's not , some people, I personally felt had a lot more interesting things to talk about\nthan I did. Some people were in concentration camps, some people suffered a lot more than I\ndid.\nQ. Were you aware of the Jewish underground organizations?\nA. Yes. Like I told you, we had some contact with the people coming mostly from I'd say\nwho were -- we knew there was some kind of organization, but I knew so few people in\n. SO, It wasn't a problem of trying to find a group where you fit. Sure, if there\nwas a lot of Jews in , 'm sure I would have been with them. But I didn't know\nenough people. See, so this is why I worked with the resistance. By the end, I found out it was\nthe FFI, but I wouldn't have been surprised if somebody would have told me it was a communist\nmovement or a Jewish movement.\nQ. So the name of your group was?\nA. After the war?\nQ. That you found out?\nA. , the French Force of the Interior. Like you have the French\narmy outside in North Africa or England who were supposed to be inside doing what we could.\nSome of those forces was a lot more active than we were because they were organized to really\nfight in the mountains, in the . Some of them were very, very well organized. The\nresistance from the French railroad.\nQ. These were all separate organizations?\nA. They were separate organizations. They had contact with other organizations to\nsynchronize some of the work, but everyone was assigned a certain job. Some people were -- it\nnever happened to me-- but some people were specialized in airplanes, allied flyers who were\nshut down, to go to Spain or to go back to England. They were specialized in that. They were\nlooking for that. Some had direct contact with , but we didn't have those. I'm\nsure some of those Jewish underground I had the feeling they had contact with the zionists from\nPalestine. Some were I'm sure were in contact with American Jewish organizations which were\nvery active trying to help the refugees. They were helping a lot more of the foreign refugees\nthan the French, but I'm sure they were there, but we were French, we were not foreigners. So,\nwe had a different way of reacting.\nQ. So you really didn't know about all of others?\nA. No.\nQ. Did you ever feel isolated?\nA. No. Once I started to work with the resistance, I knew I was not isolated. I knew\nsomebody was trying to do something for us because you know this 1s why they give us the\noption of the resistance. I knew what I was doing was helping somebody else. So, I knew I was\npart of a large group, but my personally I didn't know those people. After the war, then I saw in\nthe dozens of different groups, and more or less we synchronized in doing\nwhat we were to do. We were watching to see if the Germans were not doing an sabotage. We\nwere waiting for the Allies to reach us. But the Allies had an easy time because when they\nreached us, everything was already under control. The first time I saw Americans, I was told go\nin see where the Americans are. The city was already under control of the resistance, but we are\ntold go and give a look. So, I inquired and somebody told me they are somewhere not far from\nthere, and they were a couple miles down the road from the city, and I got there and I saw three\ntanks. This is the first American I saw. By coincidence one of the tank commanders, the leaders,\nI think it was a lieutenant or whatever, spoke a few words of French, because he didn't know\nwhat to expect either. We told him it's open.\nQ. The Germans had just disappeared?\nA. They just went away.\nQ. When was this? Do you remember the date?\nA. I think summer of '44. They disappeared, and we saw them little by little disappear and\nlike I said we saw them walking, pushing the carriages with their belongings. We saw them on\nbicycles. We even saw a couple with some kind of small motor boat, you know they must have\nstole it somewhere going up the River maybe going to . But it was\nnot like a big fight like in Normandy, whatever. They went and that was all there was to it. The\nonly time we worried a little bit was in the winter of '44'45. We were already liberated and all\nthis and all of a sudden the Battle of the Bulge started. So, we were already talking about what\ndo we do if the German army comes back. But it didn't last that long. Also, the regression we\nsaw a lot of different groups because all of a sudden we were told to look around to see if we can\npick up any Germans who stayed behind. So, we got from different people their names and the\naddress of a Frenchwomen who was living with Germans. The Germans were gone, but those\nwomen were caught. We were interested and the only thing we did was we left them with their\npanties on. It didn't make any sense but it was maybe a relief so we dragged them to the street.\nAfter that, when we saw a woman with a scarf on her head for a few months, we knew what it\nwas. This was a different group again. Sometime we're walking and one street was dragging a\ncouple of women and we met in another street another group with another couple of women. So,\nwe knew there were different groups working. After that, we were told to help to try and round\nup the collaborators. So, this is what we did. We went to the French police and they were taken\nto court. There was a very fast trial and then we took them to the cemetery and we shot them\ndown. But it lasted --it didn't last too much. Most of those people were shot were people with a\nlot of proof of what they did. Even when I was in court once and their lawyers and I heard the\nlawyer talking and he said no chance of a death sentence and everytime it was that sentence by a\ncouple jurors. This was the atmosphere of that liberation at the time.\nQ. So, back to the liberation itself. The Germans had disappeared, you heard some American\ntanks were nearby. That was it?\nA. We went there. That was it, and after that, a few days later we saw the Army coming.\nYou know, the regular army. The French army and the American army, and I saw it. I didn't\nknow they existed. I saw the Paris Jewish Brigade going too. All of a sudden, one day I was\nlooking at all those soldiers and what do I see? Jewish guys. You know who were part of the\nwhat do you call, the English army, Jewish . I don't know if you ever heard of\nthat? So, this really make me feel real good when I saw those guys. They went through and they\nkept on going up to Germany. After the liberation, I wanted to go up with the French Army.\nThey looked at me and said what's the matter with you. You are not trained. You are not a\nsoldier. You are somebody from the resistance. You are not a soldier so wait a little bit. I\nwaited a few months and after that I went into the French army and I went up to Austria and I did\nan occupation the first three years mostly in and in Vienna. I don't remember\n, but somewhere I found out there was a concentration camp in Austria and I\nnever knew the name, and even now I don't know the name of it. Nobody talks about it, but\nsomewhere in Austria, I don't know if it's up over or wherever. One day I took a ship\nand went there and the camp was already liberated, and I saw the barracks and all this, but until\nnow I never really made an effort to find out the name of that particular camp. So, there was a\ncamp right in Austria, a concentration camp, right there. After that, they asked me very nicely to\ngo back home, because we were also -- a fellow like me coming from the resistance and we were\nnot trained with the discipline that a regular soldier is when somebody was looking at us and\nsaying something, you know sometime we were very rough with him, what were you doing in\nthe war. Where were you? We came from the resistance. What were you doing there those four\nyears. So, I think the French government decided to get rid of us. We were not very good\nsoldiers. So, I came home. During the war we lost everything. In 1942, we abandoned\neverything and left Paris. My father had a small little store with an apartment. Everything was\ntaken and in , after that we found out that we had hidden in our small apartment.\nAfter that when we tried to go back everything was taken away. So, neighbors told us I don't\nknow if it was true but one day -- maybe it's true. A German army came in with a truck and they\nwere looking for us and they emptied all things and they find a statement, so we lost everything\naround twice, but we were smart enough to put our life more value on our life than our\nbelongings. Some people were caught because they stayed. It's very hard for somebody who\nworked all his life and see that house, if something should happen, I will take my suitcase and\ngo. I figure you know material things are not important, but for some people they are important.\nThe businesses, they lived in the same house or apartment for years and years and abandon\neverything and go, they couldn't do it. They figure maybe they won't pick us up and they were\npicked up. This is why a lot of people were picked up. They figured it will not happen to them.\nI understand now until now I couldn't understand why it would be so hard for people to abandon\neverything just to save their life and maybe start over again.\nQ. How did your family get back together again. How did you find everyone?\nA. The liberation I was told by the people who took them that took my sister, where they\nwere and I went to pick them up. My sister came out of the convent. My mother and father were\nin the city, so we got back. After that I don't remember what month, I went back to Paris. We're\ntalking about taking my father didn't go. I went back to Paris to see what\nhappened to the apartment we were in in Paris. When I got into Paris, the apartment was empty\nand on the first floor of the apartment house there was a bakery and he was using our apartment\nas a storage place for his flour, bags and so on and so forth. And also, I had something good\ngoing for us. The French government passed a law immediately anybody who comes back must\nget their apartment back. It's not some French people, the Jews were picked up, they moved in.\nA lot of them are still there because people never came back. So, I asked to give me back the\napartment and I asked the baker to please empty the whole thing and we came back to Paris and\nwe bought some furniture and I went to the army.\nQ. Was the baker resentful?\nA. I don't know, but he never said anything. He knew the law. He must have been very,\nvery surprised that we came back, because they didn't expect us coming back. For instance, in\n1945, we saw the trains coming from concentration camps.\nQ. And you were in the army?\nA. No, no. I saw them in the army, but we saw them also in France. They were coming\nfrom concentration camps. They were liberated and they were coming to France to get some\nmedical help and also to see what they can be relocated. Because a lot of those people were\nwithout any nationality. No country really recognized them. Some we called them\n, with no nationality whatsoever. So, then I'm sure a lot of American Jews in our\norganization helped them resettle either in Israel in those days Palestine, or bring them to\nAmerica. Then I heard about the Joint Committee, but we saw them every time, you know. I\nwas making my business when I was in Paris to go to the train station and see those trains\ncoming and see what I could do to help those people. A lot of them you saw cadavers. You saw\nthose films. People emaciated, you know, came out of concentration camp. So, a lot of people\nin France they thought they will not come back because they already knew about the killing.\nThey already knew these things, so they were very surprised to see us.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3\nQ. You were talking about going and seeing these trains coming with refugees from the\ncamps and what they looked like.\nA. They looked so bad. They looked so bad. You could see those people were walking\nskeletons. Some of them couldn't even stand up. So, I was there and I was sometimes helping\nthem get off the train going to an ambulance. I was helping. While I was in Austria, in\noccupation over there I was in jand all of a sudden my brother-in-law send me a\nletter. He says , my brother was originally from Hungary. So, he said\nyou are in over there and there is a cousin of ours that is somewhere in the\nlocating station somewhere. Give a look and see if you can find him. So, I asked around, and I\nwas told that not far from a little town by the name of they had some\nkind of camp like that was a Hungarian refugees. So, I went there and saw barracks, but it was\nnot a concentration camp. I saw barracks, and I saw some families there already together\nwaiting. I had his name and I said do you know so and so. I was asking and finally somebody\nsaid if he was single they put them up in a hotel in . I said okay. So, I went to the\nhotel and I got to the desk and I asked her his name. They said, yes, he's here. I said where,\nwhat room? I went up to the room and after that I realized I did something wrong. I went to the\nroom, opened the door and saw about eight or ten young fellows in that room. I walked in and I\nsaid who 1s this and this man. I didn't realize how I presented it. I was in full uniform. So, they\ngot scared. So they pointed to one fellow and they said this is him and they all disappeared and\nhe stayed with me. I said listen, your cousin is my brother-in-law. In Yiddish I said your cousin\nis my brother-in-law, and I had to repeat this four or five times until 1t dawned on me. And I\ndidn't realize you know he was talking to authority. In his eyes, I was in uniform. So, finally\nwhen he realized what I was saying, then I said let's go down to the restaurant and let's have\nsomething to eat. I asked him how he was doing if he needed something. He says he trying to\nget to France but he cannot get a visa to go to France. I said, let me see what I can do. So, I\nwent to the French representative over there and I said that's my cousin. He came out of some\nconcentration camp over there in Hungary. I'm his only family. I want him to go to France.\nWhat can you do? The girl was very nice she says I wish I could but I cannot. We cannot give\nany visas. Visas are coming from Paris. I cannot give it to him. After that I had a very good\nbuddy of mine in the Army, in the army you usually get one friend who is more of an\nthan anything else. I told him listen. When we are going on furlough to Paris, the\nonly time they're stopping us is at the border before we reach . This is where\nthey're stopping us. They're asking us sometime for a pass, but usually any time, I\ntold him what can we do for the guy. Well, we can put a uniform on him and once we are in\nFrance, there are a thousand refugees over there. They don't pull them out and since that idea we\ngo on furlough in a couple weeks, we'll take him with us. He can sit between us, he cannot talk\nbecause something is wrong with his throat and we'll go on through. We can always borrow a\nuniform somewhere. We went back to the hotel. I said look we cannot get it legally, but\naccording to what I know once you are in France they don't throw you out, so this is what we can\ndo. He was so scared he wouldn't do it. So, after that he waited for about a year, year and a half\nand he needed a work certificate to get a job. So, my father who was a little jeweler, said he'll\ngive him a job. So, this is what we tried to do. To help as much as I could.\nQ. After the war, as a Jew in France, did you feel any differently. Did the general reaction\nchange at all or was it the same as before?\nA. The same as before, and also when I'm thinking about it I was a little bit cocky because\nyou see a lot of people were standing on line to see a film you know and I was going right up to\nthe window and buying my ticket. When somebody was looking at me and started to say\nsomething I say listen I don't have the time, now. I have to go back. I was cocky. So to answer\nyour question, I didn't have any fear. You see the only think I knew I had to do something. I\ncame back, when I was released from the army we didn't have any money and France was in\nvery shape. I didn't see really a future a bright future for somebody like me. No money, nothing,\nplus you know the country was always a little bit society, you know father and son\nget business and so forth. So, having and being a Frenchman, was never really\n. So one day I decided let me go to the U.S. and see what I can do here. If I\ndon't like it, I can always go back. I'm not a refugee. I'm not running away from France because\nsomebody is doing something to me. I'm trying to get a better position. So, I applied and I got\nmy visa pretty fast. I came to this country and the I knew some Americans are\ngoing to be offended, but the little I know as a mechanic, the little training I got, all of a sudden\nwhen I came to this country I find out I knew more than the Americans knew. Because you see\nthe apprenticeship was more intense than what the Americans were getting. You see, for\ninstance, I was often paid what I worth, so I didn't actually produce. So, I started to work, I think\nI got less than a week and all of a sudden I discovered what I knew was worth something. So,\ninstead of working for somebody that didn't like the attitude I went from one store to the other\nand I started in brokering. Because in brokering it was almost a place where I could\ncommunicate very, very little English, some Yiddish, so I could communicate with the\ncustomers. I went to the store and I said listen. I'm a mechanic. I can fix machines, so they\nlooked at me and we heard that story before. I told them, listen you give them to me, if you don't\nlike it, you don't pay me. That's all there is to it. So, what they did was they went to their\nbasement and pick up any junk nobody wanted to fix, and I fixed it, at a very, very low price.\nLittle by little I made enough business man where I could get the work. They were bringing the\nwork at home. I was working at home. I had a little apartment in Brooklyn and I was working at\nhome, and my mother and my younger sister came. I had the apartment prepared for them, and\nmy father and my sister, the middle one stayed with them because the other one got married,\nbecause he was going to close and sell whatever his business was. So, I had my mother and my\nlittle sister, and I was already making enough to support them. A year later my father came. My\nfather really never worked for anybody either. He was always a little watchmaker in a small\nlittle store making a living as best he could. So, we decided to open a store in Brooklyn because\nwe knew the language. In those days it was a Jewish section. This is where the\nare. In those days it was no liberation. We opened a little store. Half of it\nwas typewriters and the other half was jewelry and watchmaking. We each went on like that for\na couple years. One day I met a beautiful Parisian girl, very Jewish and we decided to get\nmarried. My father was a man who was happy what he was. He didn't want too much. But I\nwas frustrated because I wanted a little bit more than that. So, I was trying to do certain things in\nbusiness where he was scared. So, one day I told him, \"Dad, I love you, but I must go.\" So,\nwhat I did, this was working and what I had in mind was Manhattan is where business is. So, he\nsaid I don't know anything about Manhattan. One day I saw an ad in the paper they were looking\nfor an experienced mechanic. So one day I got the job and give me a chance to see what\nbusiness is really like in New York. In the meantime, I was going to work in Manhattan and at\nnight after work I was going back to the store and taking care of whatever came in. This took a\nfew months and one day I saw the bus and I said listen I didn't come in to work for you. I came\nin to see and his business was already having some difficulty. He didn't have the know how. He\nwas just an accountant. He didn't know the technical side. He was depending on all the other\npeople. It didn't work. So, I told him, either I go or I buy my way in. He must have seen the\npicture he was really in a lot of trouble. I saw that he was in trouble but in my mind I could put\nit back in place. This is what I did. So, for quite a few years I went back every single day. We\nlived in Brooklyn, my wife, myself and we had an only child. So, I was going to the store and\nthis is what was going on. Sometimes I would start at 5:00 in the morning and finishing at\n11:00, 12:00. Saturday and Sunday I was working. This went on for a few years, and one day I\ntold my father, listen, you are hardly making a living now because you never understood the\nAmerican way of doing business. There is competition. It's not France. France before the war\nyou bought something for $50 and you sold it with 40 or 50 percent profit. Here you have to\nwatch what the next guy does. If you are not competitive you are never going to survive. So, the\nmerchandise he bought the first day when we left the store, we still had. He never understood.\nSo, when I talked to my father I said, listen, you are hardly making a living and I thought about\nit, thought about and said why don't you come to work with me. So a son going to work for a\nfather is something acceptable but a father going to work for a son first of all is very hard for a\nson, because you cannot talk to an employee that's your father, but it had to be done. So, he\nclosed the business in Brooklyn and came to work for me until he passed away.\nQ. I just have a few questions that related to before you came to the United States. You\nyounger sisters were hiding with someone?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Your other sister was in the convent and you were out there at risk?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Can you think of ways in which these years changed anything?\nA. I'm sure it must have changed us. I cannot pinpoint exactly.\nQ. Did you see them come out of that home different than when they went?\nA. They were too young to show anything, but I think it did something to them. I don't\nknow maybe I'm looking too hard on that. For instance you see Hitler tried to get rid of us, tried\nto do something to us. Maybe we are trying to prove he didn't succeed at all. My little sister, the\nlittle one three years old, right now is Professor at Harvard and is a doctor in Biology. My other\nsister graduated college, maybe this gave us the little push we needed, you know. I don't know if\nthis 1s an answer to your question.\nQ. You don't think you would have those positions in France?\nA. Maybe yes, maybe no.\nQ. What about you? Did it change your attitude? Make you stronger?\nA. In a certain way it made me stronger, you know, and it proved that --I don't want you to\ntake it the wrong way -- it proved something that not too many men in their lives had, the proof\nthat you can sacrifice yourself for somebody else. I hope nobody is in a position like that, but\nbeing at the border to Spain and not going over, this proved to myself, I had enough feeling for\nmy family and other people to not have done it. I said this happened maybe once in a lifetime to\na few people. This is what I did. And also it put me in a position where I never stayed back.\nSome times it's not very smart because you get hit right in the face, but this 1s the way I am.\nMaybe this makes me like that. When there is a problem, I confront it right away. For instance,\nit made me also less care than other people. I had a couple experiences. I was sitting in my\noffice and a guy walked in and he had his rain coat on the ground and a few seconds it took for\nhim to walk over to my desk, he pulled out a gun and asked me for money. I was very calm. I\ndidn't panic. I wasn't scared. My father was in the repair department. The only thing I said to\nthat man -- he said who 1s in the back? I said to the man I'm going to give you some money but\nmy father is in the back. He has a heart condition. I don't want you to go over there. The way I\nlooked at him, I don't know, he took the money and he went. Once I had another experience.\nOnce in May in New York City they have an art show on Fifth Avenue near the village over\nthere. So, one day we decided with my wife to go see the art show and look at the work of the\nartists. We parked if you're not too familiar with New York, we parked on the corner of 13th\nStreet and Fifth Avenue. We looked at all those artists and after that we went to eat in a little\nSpanish restaurant in the village and when we came back we walked over to the car. It was\nabout 8:00 or 8:30 and in my car you can flip a button and it would open every door. So, I got to\nmy door, flip the button and in the meantime my wife goes around to the other door and sit\ndown, and I sit down and somebody was holding, let my wife go. I thought 1t was a panhandler\nand I heard him say get out of here. He pulled a gun out. He pointed at my wife. He looked at\nme and he said you don't want me to hurt your wife. I said okay I'll give you some money.\nSince the incident in the office I always carried one wallet with larger bills and I carried a money\nclip with a lot of single bills in case something like that would happen. So, I had my single bills\nand it looked like it was a lot of money but it was like maybe $25 or $30 and I told the fellow I\nsaid check the \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s and I give him that money. I was so calm. I said okay I'll give you the\nmoney but how about giving me back my money clip because it is a souvenir. Just to show you\nso this might be the result of having lived through that war. You know, because when you really\nthink about it, in that period of time I was condemned to death if they would have every caught\nme and I was never scared. Now, I may be scared of a lot of stuff because I'm old and different\nthings. In those days, no. This might be these two occasions might show me how I still react,\nI'm not scared. My wife was also amazing because she stayed very calm. She didn't yell. After\nthat she said why did you ask him for the money clip. It's ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense\nbut this 1s the way I am after the war. They could have taken me for anything. So, this is why I\nfigured we survived. They were not as anti-semitic like the Poles or the Russians. You see, I'm\nsure there is a lot of anti-semitism in France. They were there and they're still there, but they\ndidn't touch us as other Jews of other countries. Plus we, I don't know we were acting a little\nmore different. Maybe we were more aggressive. Maybe I remember I didn't have any feeling\nof being Jewish. If they were to call me a dirty Jew or whatever I wouldn't have turned my back.\nI didn't know how.\nQ. Do you think the French resistance was effective?\nA. Very effective. This is why you have survivors like Iam. They were very effective. I'm\nsure some of those French, people in the resistance. I'm sure some of them didn't like us, because\nwe were Jews, but they hated the Germans more than anything. But they did help us a lot. We\ncannot say we survived on our own. We needed a lot of good French people with good hearts.\nFor instance like the Mother Superior. So there must have been a lot. We lost\na lot of Jews, but a lot of them are still here.\nQ. Do you ever think about how you really sacrificed your childhood?\nA. I never thought about it. Sometimes I'm sorry that I didn't have a chance to really enjoy\nmy childhood. Sometimes I'm sorry I never got a better education because when I look at my\nchildren, they had a chance in life of going to college. They have a chance in life of picking their\nfuture. I didn't have a chance. But I didn't have those chances. Like I said, I didn't have any use.\nThe war was there. The only thing I had in mind was not to be caught and not being killed. We\nwere condemned to death and this must have done something you know in me. You know\nbecause it's very hard to hope that it would never happen. But being condemned to death for so\nlong. Being thought that we were going to be sent to be killed or being thought of doing\nsomething in the resistance would mean being shot, it made me work -- lucky I was young. So,\nthat to me was not that tangible. I'm sure sometime I must have acted, sometimes my response\nto somebody looking at me or talking to me may see something I don't see. Maybe sometime I\nreact in a very aggressive way. It's almost impossible in my mind in talking to my kid the\ndoctor, it's almost impossible to live four or five years in that condition where you are not\naffected by it. Now, I can't personally put my finger on it, but I'm sure if somebody was\nstudying me for a little while they are going to notice he went through that. I had it easy. The\npeople who spent two or three years in concentration camps and survived, those people were\nreally affected. Also, this is why asking me if it did affect me, I'm sure it did, but it didn't stop\nme of living and getting married and raising a family. This is what the beauty of all this, that\neven after living through all that, you can still keep on going. I don't see anything else I can tell\nyou.\nQ. Thank you.\n(viewing pictures.)\nA. This is a French identity card. Every French citizen I think from the age of 12 had to\nhave an identity card. This is for everybody. In 1941, they called me to the police headquarter\nto register as a Jew and this is when they put on it the red letters Jewish. If anybody stopped me\nthey will know I was Jewish. This is a second identity card because France in those years, when\nyou move from one part of the country to another part of the country, you had to register again\nwith the police and get a new identity card. So I got an identity card in It's\nsupposed to be in the French zone. It was not occupied by the Germans. The identity card again\nwith a red stamp with the word Jew on it. This was in 1943 or the end of '42. This is an identity\ncard I received to the resistance with a false name. Instead of being Federman, my name was\nRichard. When I was stopped by the authorities, this is what I was showing. And all this is false\nidentities. This is an identity card I received because I belonged to the French resistance\nmovement and this I think is some kind of picture on this one. When I came one day just when I\nwas released from the Army -- when I came out of the Army they wanted me to have my card. I\ndidn't see any use for it, but they wanted me to have my card with a picture. An identity card\nfrom the resistance. I think they were making some kind of -- I don't know. This 1s to testify\nyou know I fought in the resistance during the occupation and I'm entitled to wear a medal or\nwhatever. This picture is what I was wearing at the liberation. I have an armband saying FFI and\nI had my gun. We didn't have any uniform but this is so we could be recognized being in the\nresistance and other people were in the armbands.\nQ. This was when?\nA. 1945. That's it?\nQ. Thank you.\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Answer: My name is Simon Federman. I was born in Paris, France, on March 1, 1926.\nQ. Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.\nA. Before the war, my parents originally came from Poland, in the beginning of the 1920s.\nMy father was a watchmaker, jeweler. We had a very modest life because he never made a lot of\nmoney, but it was a quiet simple life. I had three sisters. One of them passed away. We were\nnot religious people, maybe the reason was it wasn't very easy in Paris in those years to buy\nkosher food. It would have been an effort. My mother stopped after a little while to go to a\nsmall Jewish section of Paris to buy kosher food. So, we started to live like everybody in the\nneighborhood without being kosher, and our religion was not very, very important in our\nhousehold. During the 1930s, even I being a young boy, listening to the radios, reading some\nnewspapers, hearing my parents when they were talking, we heard what was going on in\nGermany. You know, we were religious, but we still were very Jewish. I knew personally some\nof the tradition. I knew some of the holidays, but I never went to synagogue. But this being\nJewish I knew it and I felt it; I was Jewish. What was going on in Germany touched us. In the\nlater 30s I started to see some people coming from Germany, and they were Jews who were\nrunning away. I was hearing some of the hardship they had in the country. But it didn't you\nknow it was something I heard, but I didn't feel it. I was too young, but I knew about it. In\n1939, just before the war, I was listening to the radio like most of the people and we heard that\nthere might be a war against Germany. Germany attacked Poland, there might be a war, but we\ndidn't have to worry about it because we were so strong. France was so strong, that if Germany\never they are doing anything, we would run over them in a very short time. And all this was lies.\nBut we believed it. Every single day we heard that propaganda And the poor folks everything\nwas a lie, because it took the German army to conquer France in a couple weeks.\nQ. In Paris you went to a public school?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And were you friends very mixed?\nA. Mixed?\nQ. Catholic, Jewish.\nA. Mixed, that's how religion is because we didn't have any allies, we didn't have any black\npeople, because before the war it was very rare when you saw a black person in the street. So,\nwhen we talk about mix, it was religion. But like I say, I didn't feel any different between the\nChristian and me. Enough of this, I have the feeling it never went to their mind that I was\ndifferent than they were. Because we were a small minority, and as long as they knew that I was\nborn in Paris. I spoke like them. I didn't have any accent, so I must have been in their mind, I'm\nsure, they must have thought I was like them, a Christian. Even when I was in the Army, it never\nwent to their mind that I could have been different. That's how religion was. My mannerism and\neverything was Parisian.\nQ. You never were aware of anti-semitism as a boy?\nA. I knew it existed because I knew how you know sometime when people were arguing or\nfighting they said to somebody else, you know, he's a dirty Jew. But I don't know, but it never\nwas addressed to me, because I don't want to sound macho, but I wouldn't have tolerated it. So,\nthey did nothing to me. I already didn't feel anti-semitism. I didn't feel anything like that when I\nwas a young kid in school. I was like anybody else.\nQ. What do you remember about the Germany occupation, the first days?\nA. What I remember is I really saw the Germans in 1940. I didn't see them in 1939, because\nwhen the war started my father was called into the army and like the result of all that propaganda\nand all this they mobilized a million people, but they were not ready for it. My father had half of\na uniform, no guns, sleeping in the subway. You know, this was supposed to be the 12 median\nFrench army. So, the commander decided, and I think in the end of 1939, tried to evacuate\nwomen and children from Paris. Not because we didn't know you know the Germans were going\nto bomb Paris, whatever, so they decided -- and also I remember in school they gave us some gas\nmasks, that you were supposed to carry at all times with our gas masks 1n it. Like I was saying\nbefore, they decided to evacuate women and children and we were to register, the women and\nchildren, and they send us out I think about 100 miles from Paris, in small little villages. And\nthis is where my mother, my sister and myself went. It lasted a few months, until the Germans\nreally had their offensive. One day the offensive, they had a big offensive all of a sudden they\nare finally I think they realized they had so many men in the army, but they didn't have anything\nto give them. So, what they did, they released my father who had four children. When my father\nwas released, the first thing he did was go into the village where we were. When he got there, he\nheard on the radio where the German army is advancing and the French government did\nsomething also not very smart. They made a call over the radio that all men 13 years old must\ntry to move to to reform and fight the Germans there. I never saw a gun in my\nlife. I'm 13 and they're going to make me fight there. But, we decided the Germans are not\ngoing to catch us. We didn't have any transport. We didn't have anything, we started to work,\nand we found some trucks going by or whatever and we got a lift. We got to a train station and\nthen we tried to get on the train, and we finally got to .\nQ. When was this?\nA. 1940.\nQ. In June?\nA. I think it was the early part of 1940, maybe in June. May, June, I don't remember very\nwell. It wasn't very cold.\nQ. But you hadn't yet seen Germans coming in?\nA. I didn't see them. We knew while we were on the road going to we saw\nthe plane bombing us. You know you had thousands and thousands of refugees, you know, the\nfarmer was there with his animals. We had people on bicycles, people walking. You're talking\nabout people on the and all of a sudden you saw those German plane come in, he\nstarted shooting. So, my father, we finally reached the salt mines, and we met another refugee\nlike this and talking to them, some of them were Jewish, and they said we are going over to\nPurinae, over to Spain. If you have anybody in the United States, try to reach Lisbon. The\nAmerican consulate will try to get you some papers to reach America. So, my father had a\nbrother there in New York. So, we said, Okay, let's try it. When we got to the border we were\nstopped. We said okay, we are going to go in Spain but what's going to end up with my mother\nand sisters. I cannot abandon them. So, we decided to go back. We couldn't leave my mother.\nSo, we decided to go back because we could not abandon my mother and sisters. And then\nFrance was divided. Already the German army stopped in the middle of France with an\narmistice and the northern part, the Germans were there, and the southern part was the Vichy\ngovernment. So, I don't remember exactly the date, but we got on board a train and got back to\nParis. In the meantime, my mother and sisters were back into Paris, and when I got to the border\nbetween South France, northern part, this is when I saw the Germans for the first time. They\nwent to the train, but it wasn't that important because he had so many people trying to get back to\ntheir home, so they didn't look at us too close. We got into Paris.\nQ. Was it frightening to see the German presence?\nA. No, not at all. It was orders and that's it.\nQ. Was it fairly easy to go back and forth between Vichy and --?\nA. It was not easy. It was not easy because after that you need a visa, which we are talking a\nfew days after the armistice was signed. So, I really don't think they were organized to really put\na lot of control, you know, between the north and the south. So, we got into Paris and then life\nwent back more or less normal. You saw Germans in the streets of Paris. All of a sudden a few\nmonths later, I think it was the beginning of 1941, all of a sudden we were told if we were a Jew,\nwe had to register. We had to go to what we called police, you know the man in\nthe police station to register as Jews. But not really knowing what anti-semitism was, so we\nreally didn't care. If you want to know if we are Jews, we are Jews. We went there and there\nwere lines of people who registered. I think at that time they put a stamp on our identification\ncard, because every French person must have an identity card, and they gave us a gold star, a\nJewish star, the Star of David. They told us you must put it on your clothes. And also, certain\nrestrictions. If we took the subway, we were to go only in the last wagon. We were not allowed\nto go to public places. So, my mother sewed my clothes, the Jewish star. The next day, I told\nmy mother, take it off, please. She said, no why? I said, nothing doing. I said if they are going\nto decide to pick me up, I'm not going to make it easy for them. You know, I don't look exactly\nlike what the Germans think a Jew looks like, you know with the big nose and things like that. I\nsaid no. After arguing for a little while, she took it off. I could not accept those restrictions. I\nwanted to be able to go into a park. I want to get into a move. I was young. The danger was not\nthat great. And after that, we noticed something else. They were starting to pick up Jews, but\nthey were picking up mostly foreign Jews. We noticed what they were doing, they knew people\nwere coming back from work at 6:00 at night, so they were closing off streets not far from the\nmain subway stations. So, I worked out with my father. I said I'll go at the time he was\nsupposed to come back home, and I will walk in front of him about 1,500 hundred feet. If I saw\nthem, closing the street I being a young fellow, I could run pretty fast in those days, I was\nrunning back and I would have told him and we would have taken another way of going home.\nThis is what we did for a while.\nQ. Now, let me ask you something. You were born in Paris?\nA. Yes.\nQ. But your parents were not born --?\nA. My parents were born in Poland.\nQ. Would they have been vulnerable to the roundups?\nA. No, no, because you see lucky for us, my father and my mother thought Poland is not for\nthem. They were born there and they saw the anti-semitism. They saw how bad it was for the\nJews in Poland. So, one day they decided to -- the original idea was to go to America, but they\ncouldn't get a visa. In France, in the early 20s needed people to work in the mines in northern\nFrance, to work in the factories, things like that, so they were letting foreigners come to do the\nwork that Frenchman would not do. So, my father got a job with Renault. He had in mind, I\ncan't go to America, I'm going to stay in France. I might as well try to become a Frenchman. I\nhave the privilege and obligation of a citizen. I don't want to be a foreigner in a country. So,\nwhat he did, after a couple of years, he applied for citizenship and he was a Frenchman and my\nmother and this is what French people do. Being born would have made me a Frenchman, but\nstill they were Jewish. So, you know, they were picking on the foreign Jews more or less, but we\nknew it was a matter of time for us. So, this was our life from about 1941 to 1942.\nQ. Were you in school?\nA. I was in school. I was in school but they were looking for trouble. They give us all the\ntime in school. I couldn't continue with certain things. They put me in another school, some\nkind of what do you call, trade school. They really tried to get us out all the time. This was until\n1942. In the beginning of 1942, I think the end of June or the beginning of July, all of a sudden\nwe heard it was going to be bad for the Jews. We already had all those laws. We had all those\nrestrictions, and talking to some older fellows they told me a little bit more about it. They said\nthey know from somebody in the police department they messed up picking up the Jews of Paris.\nI think it was the 14th of 15th of July all of a sudden I was told to warn the Jews in my\nneighborhood that I knew, they were coming to pick up the Jews. But they are going to pick up\nthe men and the boys. This is what they are going to pick up. So, they asked me to warn\nanybody I knew. Those people must have been from the resistance, I don't know where, but they\nhad the knowledge I didn't have, and they told me, they asked me to do it. So, I started to tell\neverybody I knew. I chose men and boys and on the 15th it will happen. So, again you warn\neverybody. So, a lot of men with their sons who believed it will happen, who believed us, they\ntried to find a place to hide and to see what will happen. I went with my older sister, -- let me go\nback to something. Let me go back to something else. It was getting very bad in Paris in the\nbeginning of 1942, and we knew two people that we had contact with, the Germans are really\ngoing to go after us, with the help of the French police. So some people started to organize a\nway of getting out of the occupied zone into the free zone and those people were helping people\nto go to the free zone where what we called , people who were passing people on\nthe other side. Some did it for money. Some did it because they wanted to help. So, when we\nsaw what was going on, the first thing we did was try to get my father out. Because I was a\nyoung boy, we figured they are going to get the man, so we spoke to one of those ;\nand we worked out some kind of deal within and my father left. It must have been the end of\nJune and on July 16th my father was gone. So, it was my older sister we went to sleep in a\nChristian's home because we were told they were going to pick up the Jews in Paris on the 16th.\nDuring the night I heard a lot of noise, and I looked through a window and I saw the police\ndragging children, with little bundles. So I saw the French police dragging little kids with their\nmother, little bundles in the street taking them I didn't know where, but I saw them, you know, at\nnight, coming out of buildings and walking in the middle of the street with those French police\naround them. The mothers crying and I was so shocked, because we were expecting them to\npick up men, and they picked up the women and small children, everybody. Lucky for us, we\nwere French citizens. In our building there were a few Jewish families and they were going from\none apartment, they must have got a list of maybe not a list. They went from one apartment to\nanother, and they knocked at my mother's door. When she opened the door she had a Jewish star\non it and they asked her for some identity car and she showed an identity card, she was French.\nQ. You were talking about the police came in and your mother showed them her identity\ncard.\nA. Yes, and because on this particular night they didn't pick up French women. This is how\nwe were lucky to survive that particular night. But we decided that we must get out of Paris\nbecause today they would find Jews and tomorrow maybe it would be us. So, what we did was\nwe tried to get into contact with a man who helped my father go to the other side, but he\ndisappeared. Either he was caught or he wouldn't do it anymore, but we had an idea of what it\ntook to go to the other side. So, we decided and my mother and my two little sisters would go\nfirst because if we all disappeared in one shot or whatever, it will be too visible. So we planned\nit that they were going to go on a vacation and my older sister would stay, but we closed up the\nplace as best we could after they are gone. So, they left, to the train to a certain city, I don't\nremember the name a few miles to the identification line, and they got to that small little town,\nand the next morning they started to walk. They were a couple miles from what was supposed to\nbe the free zone, and they were walking early in the morning and a Frenchman came by with a\nbicycle. He looked at them and he knew the way they looked that they were not from the region.\nSo, the walk was leading right to the other side so he asked my mother if she wanted him to take\nthe two kids on his bike and put it on the hood. My little sister was three years old and the other\none was seven, eight years old and they couldn't walk that well. So, she really didn't feel like it,\nbut she accepted it. And she found the fellow with the two children a couple miles down the\nroad waiting for my mother. Because he wasn't going to cross over to the other side. So, he said\nwalk over a little bit over there and the next village you see will be in the free zone. So, they got\nto a field and saw the village and my mother told my sisters start running and don't stop until you\nget over there. And this is what they did. My little sister was so small that they just cut the\nwheat, they cut it so they had the little stump left so 1t was catching up her little pants, so my\nsister grabbed her and ran with her. All of a sudden my mother a patrol, a German patrol came\nby and stopped my mother and they already had two women, Frenchwomen arrested there\nbecause some Christians were also trying to get to the other side to see their family. And to go to\nthe other side you needed a special pass and something, so they arrested those two women, and\nthat German soldier got my mother and said what are you doing. She's says I'm on vacation.\nAnd she said my children are running in the field over there. I want my children. I want to get\nthem. So he said show me what you have in your pocketbook. She opened up her pocketbook\nand what she had was a piece of paper from a hospital in Paris and the name of the hospital in\nParis was . The little French she knew he could understand sick children,\nhospital for sick children. She said, see my children are sick, on vacation, so I don't think he was\na very hard man. He said go ahead and get your children and come right back. So, she was\nlucky. She went to the other side.\nQ. Did you mother wear the Jewish star?\nA. In Paris yes, but when she left she did not wear it because she knew she couldn't be\nJewish to go over there. A few days later it was my turn to leave Paris. So, what we did with my\nsister we packed what we could, big bundles and boarded this train station to be shipped to South\nFrance where my father already was.\nQ. You had gotten communication from him?\nA. Yes, we got letters. So, we thought with my sister to go the same route. It was the only\nroute we knew. We were very lucky because we got to that small little town. I don't remember\nthe name and we spent the night -- I don't remember if 1t was a motel or whatever -- and 5:00 in\nthe morning we left, we walked. We heard motor cycle patrols, and so when we heard it we got\nout of the road and went to the field. We turned down so much that we didn't know what the free\nside was. So, I told my sister I saw somebody in the field, I told my sister you stay right here\nand I'm going to run over and ask him where am I. So, I ran over and I asked him and he said\nyou are standing right here on the free zone. So, I waved my sister and she came on in and we\ngot to the village and when we got to the village, the French asked us what are we\ndoing here. We said we are Jews and we left the occupied zone. But being French citizens, he\ncouldn't do anything. This particular guy couldn't do anything. So, we took a train and changing\ntrains and all this it took us about seven or eight hours until we got to , and we\nfind my father there.\nQ. Let me just ask you a question. When you were all in Paris together after your father\nleft, how did you make decisions? Did you as the boy, even though you were very young, feel\nresponsible?\nA. Always and I stayed the rest of my life. My father was a wonderful man, but he was an\neasy going man. He wasn't making an important decision didn't come easy to him. I being\nyoung I didn't have the vision that he had for me making a decision was easy. I started to make\ndecision in -- I started with my father -- I pushed him to go back to Paris when we were in\nFrance, and from this day on I kept making decisions to this day. All of a sudden I wasn't\nanymore a child, I was responsible for what was my family. This is the way it was. I never had\na childhood. I was a man in 24 hours. We got, like I said, we got into , and we\nstarted the best we could. My father found a small apartment, two room apartment with six\npeople. So, at night we were opening the beds and in the morning we were closing them. The\ntoilet was in the hall. But the hardest part was finding food. Because we didn't know anybody in\nthe city of . People knew each other. They were born that way. They had a\nway of getting food more or less at no price. We had to buy everything on black market. We\nwere not rich people.\nQ. You couldn't just go to a local store?\nA. You needed the coupons. You needed the food rations. You couldn't. So what you\ncould buy was nothing without coupons. Everything else was black market, and we didn't have\nany contact.\nQ. And the coupons that you had would have been from Paris were different?\nA. No, no, we registered through the department that was taking care of that. We were\ngetting so many coupons for the months. And it was very hard because it was so hard as my\nsister was about seven or eight years old. We had to pick her up in school she was fainting from\nhunger. It was tough. Later on we met some contacts and we knew a little bit more so we could\nget some kind of food, but in the beginning it was terrible. It was not only us, it must have been\nquite a few people that ran away from the northern part. I'm sure it wasn't easy for the local\npeople, but it was a little bit easier than us because they knew how to get stuff. So, it was like\nthat until I don't remember exactly when the German army came in. It wasn't too long, but a lot\nof people went to , Nice, the eastern side of Southern France because it was\noccupied by Italians, the Italian Army. the Italians were not bad. For instance, they were not the\nGermans. They didn't have the hatred against the Jews that the Germans had. So what we did in\nwe had to go somewhere, go where the Italians are. And also, a lot of people\nwere trying to go to that eastern part of Southern France because from there some tried to get to\nSwitzerland. Some were lucky enough and some of them were rejected by the police army or\ncustom. But when the Germans decided it was time, all of a sudden they invaded the rest of\nFrance and I am sure they were very unhappy with the Italians who were not tough enough with\nus. So, then after a little while when I was in , | met somebody that I knew who\nasked me if I wanted to do some work for the resistance.\nQ. This was when?\nA. It was in 1943. So, I said yes. And we started through there and people who were\ndeporting were not going to be deported. They were ready to work, like we heard about work\nbecause the Germans all of a sudden I think in 1940 they asked for a French man to go and work\nfor them to build the Atlantic wall and things like that so working for the Germans was\nsomething the Germans were looking for because their men were in the Army. So, for a little\nwhile we had the illusion that they were taking people to go to work. But in 1943 we heard\nstories that they were deporting Jews to kill them. This was in 1943. It's not like people were\nsaying we never knew. In America they didn't know they were killing Jews. We knew already\nin 1943. What date, I don't remember what we were told they were deporting Jews and killing\nthem. How they were killing them we didn't know, but the objective was to get rid of the Jews.\nSo, this is why it makes me feel I must do something. And, I was 16 or 17 years old. I don't\nthink of I was really conscious of the danger. To me, now, if somebody would say I was talking\neasy the two men I already had in mind would never get me alive over there, and I meant it. To\nme that you know was not something I could be scared of. It was part of the time. Now, I'll be\ncareful on the street. I don't go to Manhattan too often, but in those days this was the age when I\nwasn't afraid. They asked me, so they asked me if I wanted to go in and try to collect some\nmoney and help people who will go by the city of to find them a place safe to stay\nand if I wanted to do some counter propaganda the German and Vishi government was doing.\nBecause you saw quite often in the street in the city big posters with the face of a man who\nlooked unshaved and things like that, and they were saying those are the terrorists who are doing\nthis and this and this. Putting bombs and so on and so forth. Usually they were Jewish names or\nSpanish names. The poster was saying the trouble we have in this country are not the French\npeople, a bunch of foreigners who are the terrorists. Those are the people, and usually those\npeople were people who already shot or hanged. So, they asked me we have to do something to\ncounter propaganda. So, what they were doing they were buying these tickets with one sentence,\n\"Die for France.\" They asked me to go to every post I could and put the sticker on. We usually\nwere working two fellows. One watching and one putting the sticker and vice versa. One day, I\nwas supposed to meet somebody, somebody was going to work with me and he was going to\nbring me the sticker. Somebody was going to bring him the stickers. I went to the point. He\nwasn't there. I waited, waited. He wasn't there. So, I went to him and going on I saw my sister\ncoming in the street. I asked her what are you doing here you're supposed to be ata movie. She\nsaid, oh when we got to the movie you know there was line and we didn't want to wait. She\nstarted to give me some kind of story, but I knew her. I looked at her and all of a sudden I said, I\nnoticed she had a package under her arm. I said what do you have there? She said nothing.\nNothing, I said show me. She was a year and a half older than I was, but I was still the boy of\nthe family. I said show me. And I saw the stickers. She was supposed to go to work with\nsomebody else who didn't show up also. She had a sticker and this is all around and my sister\nwas working for the resistance. So, when I saw the sticker I said as long as you have the sticker\nlet's go. So, it was even easier with her than with the fellow I was working with, because with\nher I was pushing her against the wall where the sticker was and I was making believe the I was\nkissing her and was putting the sticker right in her back. And in France you know, of course I\ndon't know if it is now, but seeing a couple against the wall kissing was not something unusual.\nSo, it made it easier. I was surprised that my sister was doing this because she never told me,\nand I never told her either.\nQ. So your parents didn't know you were involved in the resistance?\nA. No. They would have been scared. Like I said, I wouldn't talk to my sister either\nbecause I really didn't want her to be involved. Once we knew I never worked again with her,\nbut I knew she had her own job.\nQ. Did you talk about your work to her?\nA. No.\nQ. Not at all?\nA. No. Because we really didn't know what our work was going to be. I didn't know.\nSometime I was getting some money I was getting it to somebody else who was going to collect\nit. Sometimes I was getting some small arms. Sometime I was getting a little bundle with false\ni.d.s, you know because the printers were printing false 1.d.s or they were stealing them when\nthey were making identification cards for the police department and keeping part of it, but we\ntook it to somebody else who was using it to make something else. I was sometime getting some\nstamps from different police departments. All this, I was some kind of point where people bring\nsomething to me and I was giving it to somebody else. The only thing I kept after a while was a\nhandgun. And they didn't mind, and I never knew who was going to show us. We had some\nway of knowing when somebody, but I didn't know who. For instance, we had somebody\ncoming and telling me we had some training. Some small arm use, some kind of what would\nhappen if we were fighting in the street and we were getting some kind of training, not much, but\nsome kind of training, and the training we were getting usually there is an avenue there 1s a river,\nthe River goes there and this particular part of is some kind of\nisland and that island which was very quiet where we could go two or three fellows we're going\nto start there and talk. We couldn't use any arms, but we could dismantle the things like that.\nThis is where we were getting this training during the occupation. I never asked them where\nthey came from. If they were from a Jewish underground or a communist underground. It was\nnever part of my mind. They were part of the resistance and that's it. The only thing I had in\nmind was resistance against the Nazis.\nQ. So you never joined one resistance group or another?\nA. No, I found out really just before the Russians, the people were doing and I was part of\nthe FFI. We never talked about politics. We never talked about religion. We were there to help\nand do what we could do. We'll help without a Jew going by who needed a place to stay or a\nration card, but it didn't make any difference to us.\nQ. Did you know who your leaders were?\nA. No, I never knew.\nQ. Did you know how large the organization?\nA. No, never knew. After the war, I found out it was pretty large. There were only small\ngroups, because you know if they would have caught us, we couldn't say anything. Like I say, I\nknew a few people in the city, that's it. They were coming and talking to me and asking me if I\ncould do that and so on and so forth. But I never knew that Gold was the leader. I didn't know\nthe . It didn't make any difference to me anyway. I was just resisting the\nGermans. And in 1943, I think it was in 1943, I don't know what month, it got pretty bad also\nand the people from the resistance, the people I spoke to said listen we have to try to save the\nchildren.\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2\nQ. I think you were talking about --\nA. I think I was starting to say in 1943, the people I knew in the resistance told us it is\nbecoming harder for the Jews in France so what we are to try to do is to save the children. So,\nthey asked me and I asked my parents if it's okay to have them take the little children and give it\nto somebody in the resistance who is going to place them somewhere where they are going to be\nsafe. It was very hard for my parents. For me, I said sure, they're going to be safe, why not?\nBut for my parents this was very hard. My little sister was three years old. The other one nine.\nWe talked about and we said we might have a chance to survive, but why not give them a\nchance. So, what we accepted the offer from the resistance and one day a woman, if I remember\nwell, an Italian Frenchwoman came down and she says I'm going to take them and we wanted to\nbe safe and also it was with one of my sisters fainting from hunger we decided it would be a\ngood idea. We tried to teach my little sister, three years old to call that woman Mommy. The\nolder one it was easy. Before they left my mother sewed in I think in their lining, in the bottom\nof her skirt a piece of paper with the name and the address of my uncle in the United States. We\ntold my older sister, the nine year old. We told her if the war stopped and we're not around, get\nin contact with your uncle. And they left. We didn't know where they were.\nQ. Your parents must have been --\nA. I'm a father myself so I can imagine how tough it was for them. So even without any\nchildren you can imagine how it is to give away, giving those two little children up not knowing\nwhere they were. Because it was always the same story, life in the resistance we didn't know too\nmany people because in case we were caught, the same thing with that. We couldn't know where\nthey were because if something would happen to us, we couldn't tell. So, this is what we did.\nWe found out later on they were taken to a small little village in the mountains of\n, and I think the name was . That particular region\n, and I had the feeling I was told the farmers that there were young\nchildren from the big cities undernourished and they are here to get better food, better air. But I\ndon't think we fooled them. They didn't say anything and never mentioned anything and never\ntook my sisters to church. They took them to school, but they never took them to church. So, I\nalready had the feeling that they knew what they were dealing with. And they were safe like that\nuntil liberation. And I was told where they were and I went there to pick them up.\nQ. By the resistance?\nA. What?\nQ. The resistance then told you where they were?\nA. Oh, yes, they were the only ones who knew.\nQ. But you didn't know who the resistance was?\nA. But the people we were dealing with, they got in contact. We were in contact in end we\nwere in contact almost every day with different people in our little group. And one of them\nknew somebody who knew where they took them.\nQ. Did you initiate that or did certain people come to you and say do you want us to save\nyour sisters?\nA. No, they give us that option. I didn't know that option existed. I couldn't go to somebody\nand say what can you do for my sisters or even for myself. They came to us and told us there is a\nway to save the children if something should happen to us.\nQ. What did they think -- what was the idea that might happen to you?\nA. Being caught by the Germans and be deported, being killed. For instance, my sisters,\nokay, they were saved. They were safer over there in the mountain, but we were in the city. And\nI don't remember the date, but they started to pick up the Jews of . SO,\nnow we had the problem what to do. For me it was easier. I was a young fellow, so I could find\nplaces that were safe where I could sleep, I could stay. But my sister was a bit older than I was.\nHer being a girl she couldn't sleep like that. Once in a while I slept outside, because you know a\nsafe place, I didn't have any room. The first thing, when we had a safe place, it was my parents.\nSo, the resistance again, somebody from the resistance I was talking to told us there 1s a way we\ncan help, having my sister go into a convent. This was already at the end of 1943, or the\nbeginning of '44. We said okay. So, they talked to the Mother Superior and she accepted it. So,\nmy sister went into a convent. But you know all the sisters, everybody was going to mass except\nmy sister, so you know when they were asking they never tried to convert her. They never tried\nto put any question on her, and the only one who really knew for sure was the Mother Superior\nand one other sister said why doesn't she go so the Mother Superior told one day I will tell you.\nBut it never bothered her not going to mass. I think they figured it out by themselves.\nQ. I'm surprised that she didn't go to mass just in case somebody else would find out.\nA. No, because she was in a convent. She was not outside going to church.\nQ. But couldn't the Germans come in even to the convent?\nA. They could but they never did it. They never did that.\nQ. So, your sister was placed in a convent, and you and your parents were still at large?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What did you do every day?\nA. What I found -- I found a job. I had a little training as an office machine mechanic. I\nwent to a small business who was dealing in that kind of machines, calculators and that type and\nso on and so forth, and I told him I had some small training, can he use me. So, the first thing he\ndid was call in the labor department to find out if he could hire a Jew. Because I never hidden --\nwhen I really had to deal with people, I didn't volunteer but I never hidden. And also, the\nquestion was what are you doing with your accent, your Parisian accent here? So, I told them the\ntruth. I left over there because I'm a Jew. So, [had ajob. My father being a watchmaker,\njeweler, he was working for different stores, going there and doing some repairs. So, this 1s how\nwe were making a living.\nQ. In between you were trying to help the resistance?\nA. Oh, yes, yes. Somebody in the resistance knew we existed so when somebody needed\nsome help going by , they had our name. We helped them either if we could get\nthem some false 1.d.s or if we could get them some ration cards, or we find them a place to sleep.\nThey were going to wherever they wanted to go, to Marseilles, or wherever they were trying to\nreach.\nQ. When you say we, you're just talking about you and a few others?\nA. Few, everybody I knew, and I'm sure what I was doing must have been repeated by the\ngroup.\nQ. Did you have, I know you didn't know who your overall leaders were but was there one\nperson who supervised you or told you what to do?\nA. There was one guy seemed to have more information that we did. He was telling us, he\nwas telling assignment tomorrow somebody is going to be you know. He was between us and\nsomebody else. He knew while we were talking about maybe leaving the city and maybe going\nup to the mountains to the Marque to join you know a lot of groups of different men who were\nfighting more or less organized with a heavy weapon. Weapons they were getting from either\ndropped by the Allies or stolen from different places, but they decided to keep us in the city.\nThey needed us in the city, so we never went really to join those people in the mountains.\nQ. Was that something you wanted to do?\nA. I was going to do anything. I was going to anything as long as it was fighting against the\nGermans. I don't think I was thinking too clearly, but sometimes I was sticking my neck out\nwhere I shouldn't. All of a sudden while I was working in the little shop over there, a young\nGerman soldier came in with his gun, with everything, and he had a typewriter and he asked my\nboss if he could use the shop to repair the typewriter. So, my boss was not going to refuse him.\nHe said, sure. So, that younger fellow who we give him a place on the bench and he started to\nlook at the typewriter and he couldn't communicate in French, but my Yiddish came back. You\nknow, so I started to say a few words of Yiddish and he understood some of it and I understood\nsome of his Germans. So we got a little bit friendlier and he told me story. He was a young\nfellow. He must have been 18 or 19 years old and he was from Austria and in the shop it was\nalready turning bad for the Germans. So, in that shop we had a map of Italy and we were\npointing every day the advance of the Allied army in Italy. He was looking at it. One day I told\nhim I said they are going to be there very soon. I said what are you going to do? He said I don't\nknow. They might send me , might send me somewhere, some place. I said why\ndon't they keep quiet and stay somewhere here, in France. It came out of my mind without even\nthinking. He was a nice fellow he said I wish I could. I will always remember his name. His\nname was , something like that, but I stuck my neck out really without thinking.\nSo, that gives you an idea of my state of mind. I wasn't afraid because of the age or whatever it\nwas at the time. You couldn't really be afraid. When it came to finding hiding places, this must\nhave been in somewhere in the beginning of 1944 just before the landing of the Allies in\nNormandy and thinking about landing in South France, they started bombing. They were\nbombing a lot because it was a railroad turnaround, and by coincidence, it was almost 1n the\nmiddle of the city. But they were bombing almost halfway there like clockwork. What they did,\nthe government of , the castle of the French pope was a wall about four or five\nfoot thick. They opened it up and we could stay inside and sleep inside in those rooms because\nof bombings. So, for me it was beautiful because a lot of French people were going there to\navoid the bombing before me. It was somewhere without really to hide. Also, it got to the point\nwhere we got so used to the bombing so sometime we were looking if I was with a friend, we\nwere looking at the planes coming over and we were already figuring if they were released now,\nthe Germans had this from somebody else. But you know being afraid now, it's amazing how\nyou lose fear. It's part of the daily routine and we were watching them and first the Red Cross\nfor some kind of hideout or whatever after the bombs were coming down. Also,\nthey asked me -- and also the French government was kind to ask us, if anybody to help the\npeople after the bombing, because sometime a lot of the people were killed. So, we had to go\nthere and try to dig them out, but everytime we heard a plane coming, a lot of people were\ncursing. We were happy because while the bombs were falling, they didn't worry about us. For\nus, everytime we saw those planes coming it was a closer day to liberation. Sure, we could have\nbeen killed but for us it was a relief. We knew it was stopping the Germans and\nof getting us. So, you know it was a very strange atmosphere in those days.\nQ. Did you get information from outside of ? Did you get a radio\nbroadcast or?\nA. We were listening to all those ears, the information we were getting was from the BBC. I\ndon't remember exactly at what hour, but we made it our business to listen. This was all the\ninformation we got because everything else we got from the French government were lies. But\nthe BBC was the life line to the news.\nQ. Back to this resistance organization that you were involved in. I know you said you\ndidn't know too much about the organization, but what can you tell me in more detail the sorts of\nthings you did for them and how you got what you got and where you took it and that sort of\nthing?\nA. Usually, you know it might not be very dramatic, usually I was collecting stuff from\npeople.\nQ. From what people?\nA. Other people from the resistance who were bringing me a package with for instance,\nsmall arms, or a package of propaganda material or a package of ration cards, something like that\nwas brought to me. And somebody else was picking it up from me. See, this was a thing. I\ndidn't do anything heroic, you know, but it was part of my job. And also, about close to the end\nbefore the liberation all of a sudden so many railroad tracks were blown up. So much sabotage\nwas done, all of a sudden the Germans had a bright idea of saying that all men and I don't\nremember from what age must report every night and watch the railroad track and put our men\nevery 50 meters, every 100 meters. And you must go there and if something should happen,\nyou're responsible. So, I think I was too young. My father was called. That's when I said to my\nfather, it's crazy. First of all, some of my groups are going to blow it up anyway, and how can\nyou be responsible for something like that. You're already hiding so don't go. What are they\ngoing to do? There's nothing they can do, you know, you are not there.\nQ. So your father, at this point, knew you were involved with the resistance?\nA. Yes. At that point he knew it. He knew it from the moment we spoke about sending\naway my sisters. Then he knew. So, it didn't go watch those tracks and a lot of other things\nhappened and we by the end were told to watch anything going on. If there is any train\norganized with people in it, to make sure that those trains would not go through. This was our\njob so I hate to see anything going on, something different in the city. We were watching to see\nif the Germans were not moving too much, and little by little we say them disappearing, because\nwe didn't have any big fighter on there. You see, when they came to France, the first time when\nI saw them, in the street of Paris, where you saw young guys must have been in their 20s, strong\nyoung guy, when they left, what do you see, old men pushing carriages with their belongings in\nit walking. A young kid maybe 14 of 15 years old because they must have used the army\nsomewhere in a different front before the occupation they took anything. You know, what a\ndifference between an army and a retreat. So we saw them but we didn't\nsee any big fight.\nQ. Was there a pretty large German presence?\nA. For a little while, yes. For a little while they were all there. Every time we turned around\nthere was a German there.\nQ. And Vichy police as well?\nA. Oh, yes. Not only the Vichy police but we had different kinds of police. You had the\npolice of the city, you had the with the Nationals and it was part of it the\nmunitions. Those were the worst collaborators there is. They were the ones doing the dirty job.\nYou know they were working with the Gestapo. So, we had to be careful of a lot of different\norganizations.\nQ. Did you see when you were living in the south Jews being taken away or people being\nbeaten or any of that sort of thing?\nA. Beaten in front of me, no, but being grabbed and thrown into a car and taken away, yes.\nThis I saw it. I saw it quite a few times. You know, because sometimes walking the street, all of\na sudden they were asking for identification paper, and the ones who didn't have the right kind\nthey were grabbing them and throwing them in the car and taking them away.\nQ. Did you feel that you had any real close calls?\nA. Oh, yes. Yes, I had a very close call. I was working with a fellow, and he had some\npropaganda stuff he was supposed to give me. What he did, he did something very, very stupid.\nHe picked it up from somewhere, I don't remember where and he had it on his back. In those\ndays, you know, there were no cars. So, everything was bikes and we had what we called bike\ngarages, and those bike garages were in the courtyard inside of a building. So, he says I'll wait\nover there and I will give it to you. We walked and I said go ahead and pick up your bike and I\nwas waiting outside. As soon as he got in, I saw them, either the police or the Gestapo and they\ngrabbed him. When I saw them, the only thing I could do was turn around. They called me, but\nI wasn't going to stop for them, so it was a very close call. Another time I had another friend, he\nwas arrested. Because in that particular day they picked up a lot of people. In that particular\nnight they were arresting quite a few young people, Jews and non-Jews. And that friend of mine\nthat was Jewish also was part of the resistance. He wasn't exactly what a German would have\nthought a Jew looked like. He was blonde, blue eyes. When they arrested him, in the meantime\nthey put him in the hotel and the next morning the Gestapo was coming or the ammunition or\nwhatever, and the same night another fellow I knew, wasn't Jewish was arrested also, and he told\nme the story. I wouldn't have believed it. What they did, they arrested so many young fellows\nthey put them in the courtyard of the hotel with a very big door with a big padlock. My friend\nwas a small little fellow. He must have been maybe 5'5\" or 5'6\" and he went to that padlock. He\nmust have been so desperate, he bolted and he run away, and other guys run away too. The other\nfellow I knew ---\nQ. You were talking about ?\nA. This fellow told me he saw it with his own eyes, a little guy like that breaking a big\npadlock like that. He wouldn't have believed it. And they all ran away. Because you see, he\nknew, he knew the next morning the Gestapo or whoever was going to interrogate him and ask\nhim and even with all this false paper, they would ask him to drop his pants down. And you\nknow in France, nobody was circumcised that was not Jewish. So, he must have been so\ndesperate that he did it. This is how the things were with the young people. We knew how bad\nit was for us to be caught and be deported.\nQ. Had you thought about going into real hiding?\nA. Never.\nQ. Why?\nA. I don't know. It wasn't in me. The only thing I thought was if they wanted me to go to\nthe . I was ready for that. But going into hiding, no. It was amazing. You see\nlike I say it was very hard to communicate this but I was born in France. I always felt\ncompletely free. Nobody is going to tell me really what to do. You see, maybe certain people\ncame from different countries, you know, like my father told me, in Poland sometime you know\nwhen they saw a soldier you know they would get off the sidewalks because they were afraid\nsomebody was going to hit them. They knew more about pogrom than I did. I never saw a\npogrom in my life. So this is what to me I think and it never went to my mind. I was hiding to\navoid being taken by the Germans but trying to find a place somewhere in a hole in the mountain\nor whatever, it wasn't in me.\nQ. Or to pretend you were catholic?\nA. I never did that. Even when I was in the army, they send me an , SO\none day, I will always remember, we went to a small little town in the mountain somewhere\naround , and the captain all of a sudden got the idea of everybody is going to go\non Sunday to mass. We had to get up early and we all go to church. I got up like anybody else\nbut when we got to church they all got in and you know kneel and cross themselves, I stayed at\nthe door. They asked me why don't you go in. I said I don't mind going in, but I'm Jewish. I\nnever volunteered. I never told them, they never asked me, but when it came the time to say it, I\nsaid it. They were all surprised because I was the only Jew in the whole unit. It never came to\ntheir mind that I could be different than they were as far as religion. During the war, it was the\nsame thing. IfI felt like I mentioned before, if I applied for a job, I didn't write I was Jewish.\nQ. Why not, wouldn't it have been easier?\nA. It would have been a lie. It wouldn't have been helpful. Because you see I was a Parisian\nwith a different accent. What was I doing in . You see? So, I told them that\nthere was no law against hiring a Jew and that's it. Maybe I wasn't smart. I don't know. But I\nnever did hide it. I didn't hide it in the army. I didn't hide it anyplace. The only thing I was\nhiding it when I had false papers.\nQ. Now, what did you get the false papers for? What did you need the false papers?\nA. For the resistance. For instance, they were stopping the people the in the street and\nasking for identity card and in France everybody has an identity card. So, the police a lot of\ntimes stopped you and asked you for an identity card. So, then I had a false identity. Sure, I\nwasn't telling them I was Jewish when I was showing them my identity card. If not, there was no\nreason.\nQ. Why wouldn't you use that same card for the man who was going to hire you or anything\nelse?\nA. You see, in France, I was missing something. In France for a young fellow, I don't know\nhow it is now, you needed a permit for a young man to go to work, and I didn't have that permit.\nI had it only in my name. The permit when I went from Paris. My name was Federman on the\npermit, it was not Richard. So, you know it was more involved, plus we needed the money to\nsurvive. I had to get ajob. You know, and where do you find, the resistance never, never\noffered any, you know, the false permit for children to go to work. So, this must be one of the\nreasons why I didn't use it.\nQ. Was it your sense that there were other Jewish members of the resistance --?\nA. Yes, yes because I knew some fellows that were Jewish, but 1t was never something you\nknow that important. Our main objective is to resist. That's how it is. We were willing to help\nanybody who was willing to resist, who was part of our resistance movement.\nQ. There were girls in the movement?\nA. Yes, my sister.\nQ. Did the girls have different kinds of jobs than the boys, different types of responsibilities?\nA. They must have because my sister never got any kind of training about fighting. You\nknow, and it's very hard now when I'm thinking about it, we never talked about it. We never\ntalked about the details about what she was doing and what I was doing. It's very hard to\nexplain, but we never talked about it. Like for quite some time we never talked about the details\nthat happened during the war. You know, I start to really talk about is when my kid got older.\nBut it's not , some people, I personally felt had a lot more interesting things to talk about\nthan I did. Some people were in concentration camps, some people suffered a lot more than I\ndid.\nQ. Were you aware of the Jewish underground organizations?\nA. Yes. Like I told you, we had some contact with the people coming mostly from I'd say\nwho were -- we knew there was some kind of organization, but I knew so few people in\n. SO, It wasn't a problem of trying to find a group where you fit. Sure, if there\nwas a lot of Jews in , 'm sure I would have been with them. But I didn't know\nenough people. See, so this is why I worked with the resistance. By the end, I found out it was\nthe FFI, but I wouldn't have been surprised if somebody would have told me it was a communist\nmovement or a Jewish movement.\nQ. So the name of your group was?\nA. After the war?\nQ. That you found out?\nA. , the French Force of the Interior. Like you have the French\narmy outside in North Africa or England who were supposed to be inside doing what we could.\nSome of those forces was a lot more active than we were because they were organized to really\nfight in the mountains, in the . Some of them were very, very well organized. The\nresistance from the French railroad.\nQ. These were all separate organizations?\nA. They were separate organizations. They had contact with other organizations to\nsynchronize some of the work, but everyone was assigned a certain job. Some people were -- it\nnever happened to me-- but some people were specialized in airplanes, allied flyers who were\nshut down, to go to Spain or to go back to England. They were specialized in that. They were\nlooking for that. Some had direct contact with , but we didn't have those. I'm\nsure some of those Jewish underground I had the feeling they had contact with the zionists from\nPalestine. Some were I'm sure were in contact with American Jewish organizations which were\nvery active trying to help the refugees. They were helping a lot more of the foreign refugees\nthan the French, but I'm sure they were there, but we were French, we were not foreigners. So,\nwe had a different way of reacting.\nQ. So you really didn't know about all of others?\nA. No.\nQ. Did you ever feel isolated?\nA. No. Once I started to work with the resistance, I knew I was not isolated. I knew\nsomebody was trying to do something for us because you know this 1s why they give us the\noption of the resistance. I knew what I was doing was helping somebody else. So, I knew I was\npart of a large group, but my personally I didn't know those people. After the war, then I saw in\nthe dozens of different groups, and more or less we synchronized in doing\nwhat we were to do. We were watching to see if the Germans were not doing an sabotage. We\nwere waiting for the Allies to reach us. But the Allies had an easy time because when they\nreached us, everything was already under control. The first time I saw Americans, I was told go\nin see where the Americans are. The city was already under control of the resistance, but we are\ntold go and give a look. So, I inquired and somebody told me they are somewhere not far from\nthere, and they were a couple miles down the road from the city, and I got there and I saw three\ntanks. This is the first American I saw. By coincidence one of the tank commanders, the leaders,\nI think it was a lieutenant or whatever, spoke a few words of French, because he didn't know\nwhat to expect either. We told him it's open.\nQ. The Germans had just disappeared?\nA. They just went away.\nQ. When was this? Do you remember the date?\nA. I think summer of '44. They disappeared, and we saw them little by little disappear and\nlike I said we saw them walking, pushing the carriages with their belongings. We saw them on\nbicycles. We even saw a couple with some kind of small motor boat, you know they must have\nstole it somewhere going up the River maybe going to . But it was\nnot like a big fight like in Normandy, whatever. They went and that was all there was to it. The\nonly time we worried a little bit was in the winter of '44'45. We were already liberated and all\nthis and all of a sudden the Battle of the Bulge started. So, we were already talking about what\ndo we do if the German army comes back. But it didn't last that long. Also, the regression we\nsaw a lot of different groups because all of a sudden we were told to look around to see if we can\npick up any Germans who stayed behind. So, we got from different people their names and the\naddress of a Frenchwomen who was living with Germans. The Germans were gone, but those\nwomen were caught. We were interested and the only thing we did was we left them with their\npanties on. It didn't make any sense but it was maybe a relief so we dragged them to the street.\nAfter that, when we saw a woman with a scarf on her head for a few months, we knew what it\nwas. This was a different group again. Sometime we're walking and one street was dragging a\ncouple of women and we met in another street another group with another couple of women. So,\nwe knew there were different groups working. After that, we were told to help to try and round\nup the collaborators. So, this is what we did. We went to the French police and they were taken\nto court. There was a very fast trial and then we took them to the cemetery and we shot them\ndown. But it lasted --it didn't last too much. Most of those people were shot were people with a\nlot of proof of what they did. Even when I was in court once and their lawyers and I heard the\nlawyer talking and he said no chance of a death sentence and everytime it was that sentence by a\ncouple jurors. This was the atmosphere of that liberation at the time.\nQ. So, back to the liberation itself. The Germans had disappeared, you heard some American\ntanks were nearby. That was it?\nA. We went there. That was it, and after that, a few days later we saw the Army coming.\nYou know, the regular army. The French army and the American army, and I saw it. I didn't\nknow they existed. I saw the Paris Jewish Brigade going too. All of a sudden, one day I was\nlooking at all those soldiers and what do I see? Jewish guys. You know who were part of the\nwhat do you call, the English army, Jewish . I don't know if you ever heard of\nthat? So, this really make me feel real good when I saw those guys. They went through and they\nkept on going up to Germany. After the liberation, I wanted to go up with the French Army.\nThey looked at me and said what's the matter with you. You are not trained. You are not a\nsoldier. You are somebody from the resistance. You are not a soldier so wait a little bit. I\nwaited a few months and after that I went into the French army and I went up to Austria and I did\nan occupation the first three years mostly in and in Vienna. I don't remember\n, but somewhere I found out there was a concentration camp in Austria and I\nnever knew the name, and even now I don't know the name of it. Nobody talks about it, but\nsomewhere in Austria, I don't know if it's up over or wherever. One day I took a ship\nand went there and the camp was already liberated, and I saw the barracks and all this, but until\nnow I never really made an effort to find out the name of that particular camp. So, there was a\ncamp right in Austria, a concentration camp, right there. After that, they asked me very nicely to\ngo back home, because we were also -- a fellow like me coming from the resistance and we were\nnot trained with the discipline that a regular soldier is when somebody was looking at us and\nsaying something, you know sometime we were very rough with him, what were you doing in\nthe war. Where were you? We came from the resistance. What were you doing there those four\nyears. So, I think the French government decided to get rid of us. We were not very good\nsoldiers. So, I came home. During the war we lost everything. In 1942, we abandoned\neverything and left Paris. My father had a small little store with an apartment. Everything was\ntaken and in , after that we found out that we had hidden in our small apartment.\nAfter that when we tried to go back everything was taken away. So, neighbors told us I don't\nknow if it was true but one day -- maybe it's true. A German army came in with a truck and they\nwere looking for us and they emptied all things and they find a statement, so we lost everything\naround twice, but we were smart enough to put our life more value on our life than our\nbelongings. Some people were caught because they stayed. It's very hard for somebody who\nworked all his life and see that house, if something should happen, I will take my suitcase and\ngo. I figure you know material things are not important, but for some people they are important.\nThe businesses, they lived in the same house or apartment for years and years and abandon\neverything and go, they couldn't do it. They figure maybe they won't pick us up and they were\npicked up. This is why a lot of people were picked up. They figured it will not happen to them.\nI understand now until now I couldn't understand why it would be so hard for people to abandon\neverything just to save their life and maybe start over again.\nQ. How did your family get back together again. How did you find everyone?\nA. The liberation I was told by the people who took them that took my sister, where they\nwere and I went to pick them up. My sister came out of the convent. My mother and father were\nin the city, so we got back. After that I don't remember what month, I went back to Paris. We're\ntalking about taking my father didn't go. I went back to Paris to see what\nhappened to the apartment we were in in Paris. When I got into Paris, the apartment was empty\nand on the first floor of the apartment house there was a bakery and he was using our apartment\nas a storage place for his flour, bags and so on and so forth. And also, I had something good\ngoing for us. The French government passed a law immediately anybody who comes back must\nget their apartment back. It's not some French people, the Jews were picked up, they moved in.\nA lot of them are still there because people never came back. So, I asked to give me back the\napartment and I asked the baker to please empty the whole thing and we came back to Paris and\nwe bought some furniture and I went to the army.\nQ. Was the baker resentful?\nA. I don't know, but he never said anything. He knew the law. He must have been very,\nvery surprised that we came back, because they didn't expect us coming back. For instance, in\n1945, we saw the trains coming from concentration camps.\nQ. And you were in the army?\nA. No, no. I saw them in the army, but we saw them also in France. They were coming\nfrom concentration camps. They were liberated and they were coming to France to get some\nmedical help and also to see what they can be relocated. Because a lot of those people were\nwithout any nationality. No country really recognized them. Some we called them\n, with no nationality whatsoever. So, then I'm sure a lot of American Jews in our\norganization helped them resettle either in Israel in those days Palestine, or bring them to\nAmerica. Then I heard about the Joint Committee, but we saw them every time, you know. I\nwas making my business when I was in Paris to go to the train station and see those trains\ncoming and see what I could do to help those people. A lot of them you saw cadavers. You saw\nthose films. People emaciated, you know, came out of concentration camp. So, a lot of people\nin France they thought they will not come back because they already knew about the killing.\nThey already knew these things, so they were very surprised to see us.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3\nQ. You were talking about going and seeing these trains coming with refugees from the\ncamps and what they looked like.\nA. They looked so bad. They looked so bad. You could see those people were walking\nskeletons. Some of them couldn't even stand up. So, I was there and I was sometimes helping\nthem get off the train going to an ambulance. I was helping. While I was in Austria, in\noccupation over there I was in jand all of a sudden my brother-in-law send me a\nletter. He says , my brother was originally from Hungary. So, he said\nyou are in over there and there is a cousin of ours that is somewhere in the\nlocating station somewhere. Give a look and see if you can find him. So, I asked around, and I\nwas told that not far from a little town by the name of they had some\nkind of camp like that was a Hungarian refugees. So, I went there and saw barracks, but it was\nnot a concentration camp. I saw barracks, and I saw some families there already together\nwaiting. I had his name and I said do you know so and so. I was asking and finally somebody\nsaid if he was single they put them up in a hotel in . I said okay. So, I went to the\nhotel and I got to the desk and I asked her his name. They said, yes, he's here. I said where,\nwhat room? I went up to the room and after that I realized I did something wrong. I went to the\nroom, opened the door and saw about eight or ten young fellows in that room. I walked in and I\nsaid who 1s this and this man. I didn't realize how I presented it. I was in full uniform. So, they\ngot scared. So they pointed to one fellow and they said this is him and they all disappeared and\nhe stayed with me. I said listen, your cousin is my brother-in-law. In Yiddish I said your cousin\nis my brother-in-law, and I had to repeat this four or five times until 1t dawned on me. And I\ndidn't realize you know he was talking to authority. In his eyes, I was in uniform. So, finally\nwhen he realized what I was saying, then I said let's go down to the restaurant and let's have\nsomething to eat. I asked him how he was doing if he needed something. He says he trying to\nget to France but he cannot get a visa to go to France. I said, let me see what I can do. So, I\nwent to the French representative over there and I said that's my cousin. He came out of some\nconcentration camp over there in Hungary. I'm his only family. I want him to go to France.\nWhat can you do? The girl was very nice she says I wish I could but I cannot. We cannot give\nany visas. Visas are coming from Paris. I cannot give it to him. After that I had a very good\nbuddy of mine in the Army, in the army you usually get one friend who is more of an\nthan anything else. I told him listen. When we are going on furlough to Paris, the\nonly time they're stopping us is at the border before we reach . This is where\nthey're stopping us. They're asking us sometime for a pass, but usually any time, I\ntold him what can we do for the guy. Well, we can put a uniform on him and once we are in\nFrance, there are a thousand refugees over there. They don't pull them out and since that idea we\ngo on furlough in a couple weeks, we'll take him with us. He can sit between us, he cannot talk\nbecause something is wrong with his throat and we'll go on through. We can always borrow a\nuniform somewhere. We went back to the hotel. I said look we cannot get it legally, but\naccording to what I know once you are in France they don't throw you out, so this is what we can\ndo. He was so scared he wouldn't do it. So, after that he waited for about a year, year and a half\nand he needed a work certificate to get a job. So, my father who was a little jeweler, said he'll\ngive him a job. So, this is what we tried to do. To help as much as I could.\nQ. After the war, as a Jew in France, did you feel any differently. Did the general reaction\nchange at all or was it the same as before?\nA. The same as before, and also when I'm thinking about it I was a little bit cocky because\nyou see a lot of people were standing on line to see a film you know and I was going right up to\nthe window and buying my ticket. When somebody was looking at me and started to say\nsomething I say listen I don't have the time, now. I have to go back. I was cocky. So to answer\nyour question, I didn't have any fear. You see the only think I knew I had to do something. I\ncame back, when I was released from the army we didn't have any money and France was in\nvery shape. I didn't see really a future a bright future for somebody like me. No money, nothing,\nplus you know the country was always a little bit society, you know father and son\nget business and so forth. So, having and being a Frenchman, was never really\n. So one day I decided let me go to the U.S. and see what I can do here. If I\ndon't like it, I can always go back. I'm not a refugee. I'm not running away from France because\nsomebody is doing something to me. I'm trying to get a better position. So, I applied and I got\nmy visa pretty fast. I came to this country and the I knew some Americans are\ngoing to be offended, but the little I know as a mechanic, the little training I got, all of a sudden\nwhen I came to this country I find out I knew more than the Americans knew. Because you see\nthe apprenticeship was more intense than what the Americans were getting. You see, for\ninstance, I was often paid what I worth, so I didn't actually produce. So, I started to work, I think\nI got less than a week and all of a sudden I discovered what I knew was worth something. So,\ninstead of working for somebody that didn't like the attitude I went from one store to the other\nand I started in brokering. Because in brokering it was almost a place where I could\ncommunicate very, very little English, some Yiddish, so I could communicate with the\ncustomers. I went to the store and I said listen. I'm a mechanic. I can fix machines, so they\nlooked at me and we heard that story before. I told them, listen you give them to me, if you don't\nlike it, you don't pay me. That's all there is to it. So, what they did was they went to their\nbasement and pick up any junk nobody wanted to fix, and I fixed it, at a very, very low price.\nLittle by little I made enough business man where I could get the work. They were bringing the\nwork at home. I was working at home. I had a little apartment in Brooklyn and I was working at\nhome, and my mother and my younger sister came. I had the apartment prepared for them, and\nmy father and my sister, the middle one stayed with them because the other one got married,\nbecause he was going to close and sell whatever his business was. So, I had my mother and my\nlittle sister, and I was already making enough to support them. A year later my father came. My\nfather really never worked for anybody either. He was always a little watchmaker in a small\nlittle store making a living as best he could. So, we decided to open a store in Brooklyn because\nwe knew the language. In those days it was a Jewish section. This is where the\nare. In those days it was no liberation. We opened a little store. Half of it\nwas typewriters and the other half was jewelry and watchmaking. We each went on like that for\na couple years. One day I met a beautiful Parisian girl, very Jewish and we decided to get\nmarried. My father was a man who was happy what he was. He didn't want too much. But I\nwas frustrated because I wanted a little bit more than that. So, I was trying to do certain things in\nbusiness where he was scared. So, one day I told him, \"Dad, I love you, but I must go.\" So,\nwhat I did, this was working and what I had in mind was Manhattan is where business is. So, he\nsaid I don't know anything about Manhattan. One day I saw an ad in the paper they were looking\nfor an experienced mechanic. So one day I got the job and give me a chance to see what\nbusiness is really like in New York. In the meantime, I was going to work in Manhattan and at\nnight after work I was going back to the store and taking care of whatever came in. This took a\nfew months and one day I saw the bus and I said listen I didn't come in to work for you. I came\nin to see and his business was already having some difficulty. He didn't have the know how. He\nwas just an accountant. He didn't know the technical side. He was depending on all the other\npeople. It didn't work. So, I told him, either I go or I buy my way in. He must have seen the\npicture he was really in a lot of trouble. I saw that he was in trouble but in my mind I could put\nit back in place. This is what I did. So, for quite a few years I went back every single day. We\nlived in Brooklyn, my wife, myself and we had an only child. So, I was going to the store and\nthis is what was going on. Sometimes I would start at 5:00 in the morning and finishing at\n11:00, 12:00. Saturday and Sunday I was working. This went on for a few years, and one day I\ntold my father, listen, you are hardly making a living now because you never understood the\nAmerican way of doing business. There is competition. It's not France. France before the war\nyou bought something for $50 and you sold it with 40 or 50 percent profit. Here you have to\nwatch what the next guy does. If you are not competitive you are never going to survive. So, the\nmerchandise he bought the first day when we left the store, we still had. He never understood.\nSo, when I talked to my father I said, listen, you are hardly making a living and I thought about\nit, thought about and said why don't you come to work with me. So a son going to work for a\nfather is something acceptable but a father going to work for a son first of all is very hard for a\nson, because you cannot talk to an employee that's your father, but it had to be done. So, he\nclosed the business in Brooklyn and came to work for me until he passed away.\nQ. I just have a few questions that related to before you came to the United States. You\nyounger sisters were hiding with someone?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Your other sister was in the convent and you were out there at risk?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Can you think of ways in which these years changed anything?\nA. I'm sure it must have changed us. I cannot pinpoint exactly.\nQ. Did you see them come out of that home different than when they went?\nA. They were too young to show anything, but I think it did something to them. I don't\nknow maybe I'm looking too hard on that. For instance you see Hitler tried to get rid of us, tried\nto do something to us. Maybe we are trying to prove he didn't succeed at all. My little sister, the\nlittle one three years old, right now is Professor at Harvard and is a doctor in Biology. My other\nsister graduated college, maybe this gave us the little push we needed, you know. I don't know if\nthis 1s an answer to your question.\nQ. You don't think you would have those positions in France?\nA. Maybe yes, maybe no.\nQ. What about you? Did it change your attitude? Make you stronger?\nA. In a certain way it made me stronger, you know, and it proved that --I don't want you to\ntake it the wrong way -- it proved something that not too many men in their lives had, the proof\nthat you can sacrifice yourself for somebody else. I hope nobody is in a position like that, but\nbeing at the border to Spain and not going over, this proved to myself, I had enough feeling for\nmy family and other people to not have done it. I said this happened maybe once in a lifetime to\na few people. This is what I did. And also it put me in a position where I never stayed back.\nSome times it's not very smart because you get hit right in the face, but this 1s the way I am.\nMaybe this makes me like that. When there is a problem, I confront it right away. For instance,\nit made me also less care than other people. I had a couple experiences. I was sitting in my\noffice and a guy walked in and he had his rain coat on the ground and a few seconds it took for\nhim to walk over to my desk, he pulled out a gun and asked me for money. I was very calm. I\ndidn't panic. I wasn't scared. My father was in the repair department. The only thing I said to\nthat man -- he said who 1s in the back? I said to the man I'm going to give you some money but\nmy father is in the back. He has a heart condition. I don't want you to go over there. The way I\nlooked at him, I don't know, he took the money and he went. Once I had another experience.\nOnce in May in New York City they have an art show on Fifth Avenue near the village over\nthere. So, one day we decided with my wife to go see the art show and look at the work of the\nartists. We parked if you're not too familiar with New York, we parked on the corner of 13th\nStreet and Fifth Avenue. We looked at all those artists and after that we went to eat in a little\nSpanish restaurant in the village and when we came back we walked over to the car. It was\nabout 8:00 or 8:30 and in my car you can flip a button and it would open every door. So, I got to\nmy door, flip the button and in the meantime my wife goes around to the other door and sit\ndown, and I sit down and somebody was holding, let my wife go. I thought 1t was a panhandler\nand I heard him say get out of here. He pulled a gun out. He pointed at my wife. He looked at\nme and he said you don't want me to hurt your wife. I said okay I'll give you some money.\nSince the incident in the office I always carried one wallet with larger bills and I carried a money\nclip with a lot of single bills in case something like that would happen. So, I had my single bills\nand it looked like it was a lot of money but it was like maybe $25 or $30 and I told the fellow I\nsaid check the \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s and I give him that money. I was so calm. I said okay I'll give you the\nmoney but how about giving me back my money clip because it is a souvenir. Just to show you\nso this might be the result of having lived through that war. You know, because when you really\nthink about it, in that period of time I was condemned to death if they would have every caught\nme and I was never scared. Now, I may be scared of a lot of stuff because I'm old and different\nthings. In those days, no. This might be these two occasions might show me how I still react,\nI'm not scared. My wife was also amazing because she stayed very calm. She didn't yell. After\nthat she said why did you ask him for the money clip. It's ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense\nbut this 1s the way I am after the war. They could have taken me for anything. So, this is why I\nfigured we survived. They were not as anti-semitic like the Poles or the Russians. You see, I'm\nsure there is a lot of anti-semitism in France. They were there and they're still there, but they\ndidn't touch us as other Jews of other countries. Plus we, I don't know we were acting a little\nmore different. Maybe we were more aggressive. Maybe I remember I didn't have any feeling\nof being Jewish. If they were to call me a dirty Jew or whatever I wouldn't have turned my back.\nI didn't know how.\nQ. Do you think the French resistance was effective?\nA. Very effective. This is why you have survivors like Iam. They were very effective. I'm\nsure some of those French, people in the resistance. I'm sure some of them didn't like us, because\nwe were Jews, but they hated the Germans more than anything. But they did help us a lot. We\ncannot say we survived on our own. We needed a lot of good French people with good hearts.\nFor instance like the Mother Superior. So there must have been a lot. We lost\na lot of Jews, but a lot of them are still here.\nQ. Do you ever think about how you really sacrificed your childhood?\nA. I never thought about it. Sometimes I'm sorry that I didn't have a chance to really enjoy\nmy childhood. Sometimes I'm sorry I never got a better education because when I look at my\nchildren, they had a chance in life of going to college. They have a chance in life of picking their\nfuture. I didn't have a chance. But I didn't have those chances. Like I said, I didn't have any use.\nThe war was there. The only thing I had in mind was not to be caught and not being killed. We\nwere condemned to death and this must have done something you know in me. You know\nbecause it's very hard to hope that it would never happen. But being condemned to death for so\nlong. Being thought that we were going to be sent to be killed or being thought of doing\nsomething in the resistance would mean being shot, it made me work -- lucky I was young. So,\nthat to me was not that tangible. I'm sure sometime I must have acted, sometimes my response\nto somebody looking at me or talking to me may see something I don't see. Maybe sometime I\nreact in a very aggressive way. It's almost impossible in my mind in talking to my kid the\ndoctor, it's almost impossible to live four or five years in that condition where you are not\naffected by it. Now, I can't personally put my finger on it, but I'm sure if somebody was\nstudying me for a little while they are going to notice he went through that. I had it easy. The\npeople who spent two or three years in concentration camps and survived, those people were\nreally affected. Also, this is why asking me if it did affect me, I'm sure it did, but it didn't stop\nme of living and getting married and raising a family. This is what the beauty of all this, that\neven after living through all that, you can still keep on going. I don't see anything else I can tell\nyou.\nQ. Thank you.\n(viewing pictures.)\nA. This is a French identity card. Every French citizen I think from the age of 12 had to\nhave an identity card. This is for everybody. In 1941, they called me to the police headquarter\nto register as a Jew and this is when they put on it the red letters Jewish. If anybody stopped me\nthey will know I was Jewish. This is a second identity card because France in those years, when\nyou move from one part of the country to another part of the country, you had to register again\nwith the police and get a new identity card. So I got an identity card in It's\nsupposed to be in the French zone. It was not occupied by the Germans. The identity card again\nwith a red stamp with the word Jew on it. This was in 1943 or the end of '42. This is an identity\ncard I received to the resistance with a false name. Instead of being Federman, my name was\nRichard. When I was stopped by the authorities, this is what I was showing. And all this is false\nidentities. This is an identity card I received because I belonged to the French resistance\nmovement and this I think is some kind of picture on this one. When I came one day just when I\nwas released from the Army -- when I came out of the Army they wanted me to have my card. I\ndidn't see any use for it, but they wanted me to have my card with a picture. An identity card\nfrom the resistance. I think they were making some kind of -- I don't know. This 1s to testify\nyou know I fought in the resistance during the occupation and I'm entitled to wear a medal or\nwhatever. This picture is what I was wearing at the liberation. I have an armband saying FFI and\nI had my gun. We didn't have any uniform but this is so we could be recognized being in the\nresistance and other people were in the armbands.\nQ. This was when?\nA. 1945. That's it?\nQ. Thank you.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
