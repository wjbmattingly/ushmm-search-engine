The whole world protested at that time, 1937, 38. So finally they\npermitted to kill kosher so much and so much. I will never forget as long as I\nlive, we used to sell a lot of restaurants in Bialystok. So one morning I came in\nlike 5:00, 6:00 in the morning . The main meal is lunchtime, so they\nstopped cooking about 7:00, 8:00 in the morning, so I had to be in the store 5:00,\n6 o\u2019clock in the morning. We had one store wasn\u2019t too far from the railroad\nstation so at 5 o\u2019clock when the shift changes in the railroad workers so they\nbanged on the door. Mr. Bass, Mr. Bass, grandfather died.

(The tape is difficult to hear). The Germans had a lot of\ninfluence at that time. In our hometown lived a lot of Germans. They remained\nfrom the First World War. They were manufacturing textiles. Bialystok is the\nsecond largest city in Europe in textiles.",
        "Q: You described the German population of Bialystok. When it came to anti-\nSemitism who was the greatest danger to you, the Germans of Bialystok or the\nPoles?",

        "Q: So there were pogroms in Bialystok?\n9",
        "A: Not in Bialystok direct because Bialystok was 85 to 90 percent Jewish city. So\nthey didn\u2019t start it up. Bur there were some other cities",
        "Q: Who controlled Bialystok? With the large Jewish population, who controlled the\ncity government?",

So they told us to see one of the big jails\nthere. We used to cut our bread in half and send the other half to my father. After\nthe liberation in 45-46, my father and I got together, my father and I lived\ntogether. We slept in one bed and we cried our tears out. He told me he has\nnever seen Brisk (?), he never even knew how it looked. They put him in\n. They sent him six weeks -- sixty days and sixty nights.",
        "Q: Siberia?",
        "A: Six weeks, they took him that long. He always used to kid me. If you would be\nthere we used to cut trees, he used to tell me a dozen people could dance a waltz\non it such huge trees.",
        "Q: Did your family get any word from him during that time?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No one knew what happened to him, no letters, nothing?",
        "A: Nothing. We didn\u2019t expect that. But right when the war ended, he used to write\nletters. In Bialystok, we used to have a guy used to take care of our accounts. He\nwas an accountant, so my father used to send a letter to him and we used to send\n10\nletters from Germany because we were liberated from Germany. Somehow my\nsister was liberated not far from Poland and we spoke to each other said we going\nto be liberated we\u2019ll all come back to Bialystok. But who knew the circumstances\nwith Germany and Russia with borders and all that, but she made it into Poland.\nCame to my home town there were maybe ten, twelve people, they all left\nthey couldn\u2019t stay there .

        "Q: Cooperative?",

One time, they always used to have a lot of dancing,\nthe Russians. In that same factory they built up a place with a platform, they used\nto go every night dancing. I was a youngster, I was dressed nicely and the\ndirector was a Russian guy. He used to come over all the time and ask \u201cwhere did\nyou get it?\u201d I said, what do you mean where did we get it? We bought it. I was\nyoung, I didn\u2019t know what to answer. I didn\u2019t know their system in Russian. He\nsaid, you mean you have money, you go to the store you bought shoes, you\nbought a suit.

        "Q: Comrade.",
        "A: Comrade, director, where am I going to get sugar for you? He said how many\npounds of sugar do you put in each shift? Three tanks, each shift we used to put\nin a tank of coffee. Each shift is a tank of coffee and we used to put in sugar and\ncoffee together. We used to put in five kilo? Because there was 1,800 cups. I'll\ntell you what to do, put in four kilo from now on. I never know from those things,\nhow could I steal a pound of sugar from it. I gave it to him. But then he opened\nthe door for me. ;",
        "Q: So then you had help? This job you got when the Russians came in, this was after\nthe Russians came in, the job in the kitchen. This was after the Russians came in?",
        "A: In 1939. The end of \u201939.",

        "A: Yeah, I would get on my bicycle, it was a distance. If 1t wasn\u2019t too much.\nOtherwise I had to take the bus. That\u2019s how I knew about cooking, I used to\ncome around, sometimes the Polacks they used to stay in the kitchen they used to\ncall me over and show me how to do this and how to do this. . So this way\nthat\u2019s how I made sure my family had food.",
        "Q: The job in the kitchen, how long did you work there?\n12",
        "A: Maybe a year and a half.",

So I go home and I see all the Soviets\nbarefooted, one shoe on, one shoe off. They are running like crazy, like I\nkept asking what\u2019s happening? They said the Germans are back.

The whole world protested at that time, 1937, 38. So finally they\npermitted to kill kosher so much and so much. I will never forget as long as I\nlive, we used to sell a lot of restaurants in Bialystok. So one morning I came in\nlike 5:00, 6:00 in the morning . The main meal is lunchtime, so they\nstopped cooking about 7:00, 8:00 in the morning, so I had to be in the store 5:00,\n6 o\u2019clock in the morning.

(The tape is difficult to hear). The Germans had a lot of\ninfluence at that time. In our hometown lived a lot of Germans. They remained\nfrom the First World War. They were manufacturing textiles. Bialystok is the\nsecond largest city in Europe in textiles.",
        "A: The Germans maybe they did it more in intelligence, but the Poles did it like\npogroms or fighting or things like that.",
        "A: Not in Bialystok direct because Bialystok was 85 to 90 percent Jewish city. So\nthey didn\u2019t start it up. Bur there were some other cities",

So they told us to see one of the big jails\nthere. We used to cut our bread in half and send the other half to my father. After\nthe liberation in 45-46, my father and I got together, my father and I lived\ntogether. We slept in one bed and we cried our tears out. He told me he has\nnever seen Brisk (?), he never even knew how it looked. They put him in\n. They sent him six weeks -- sixty days and sixty nights.",
        "A: Six weeks, they took him that long. He always used to kid me. If you would be\nthere we used to cut trees, he used to tell me a dozen people could dance a waltz\non it such huge trees.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Nothing. We didn\u2019t expect that. But right when the war ended, he used to write\nletters. In Bialystok, we used to have a guy used to take care of our accounts. He\nwas an accountant, so my father used to send a letter to him and we used to send\n10\nletters from Germany because we were liberated from Germany. Somehow my\nsister was liberated not far from Poland and we spoke to each other said we going\nto be liberated we\u2019ll all come back to Bialystok. But who knew the circumstances\nwith Germany and Russia with borders and all that, but she made it into Poland.\nCame to my home town there were maybe ten, twelve people, they all left\nthey couldn\u2019t stay there . That\u2019s how we got together with\nmy father we brought him into Bialystok then to Germany and then to the United\nStates.",
        "A: My father was there. What was I doing? I was working in the kitchen.",
        "A: The Germans came two years later, 1941. Because Poland, if you look at a map,\nyou see Poland has a river the Bug.",
        "A: They sent us to school.",
        "A: Their school. They allowed us. After 4 o\u2019clock they sent us to Russian school. I\njust tried to explain the reason why, they prepared us for the army. A year later or\ntwo years later they would probably take us into the service.",
        "A: It\u2019s a good question.",
        "A: Yeah. I\u2019m trying to tell you a story, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "A: I just mentioned a minute ago that there were textile factories and I worked in the\ntextiles. When the Russians came in they used to take like three or four places,\nthey call it and guard them together.\n11",
        "A: Cooperative. They called them . And they made a kitchen there. The\ntextiles run three shifts every day, day and night. We had to prepare twenty-four\nmeals a day for three shifts. One time, they always used to have a lot of dancing,\nthe Russians. In that same factory they built up a place with a platform, they used\nto go every night dancing. I was a youngster, I was dressed nicely and the\ndirector was a Russian guy. He used to come over all the time and ask \u201cwhere did\nyou get it?\u201d I said, what do you mean where did we get it? We bought it. I was\nyoung, I didn\u2019t know what to answer. I didn\u2019t know their system in Russian. He\nsaid, you mean you have money, you go to the store you bought shoes, you\nbought a suit. One time coming there in October I meet this one, this one and this\none. . Ineed sugar. Where am I going to get sugar.\nTovarich, you know what Tovarich 1s?",
        "A: Comrade, director, where am I going to get sugar for you? He said how many\npounds of sugar do you put in each shift? Three tanks, each shift we used to put\nin a tank of coffee. Each shift is a tank of coffee and we used to put in sugar and\ncoffee together. We used to put in five kilo? Because there was 1,800 cups. I'll\ntell you what to do, put in four kilo from now on. I never know from those things,\nhow could I steal a pound of sugar from it. I gave it to him. But then he opened\nthe door for me. ;",
        "A: In 1939. The end of \u201939.",
        "A: I managed it. Because I can explain it. I was a very good comedian. Today I\nhappen to be a good cook. . When we supplied the restaurants I used to pick\nup the orders and get on my bicycle when it wasn\u2019t too busy.",
        "A: Yeah, I would get on my bicycle, it was a distance. If 1t wasn\u2019t too much.\nOtherwise I had to take the bus. That\u2019s how I knew about cooking, I used to\ncome around, sometimes the Polacks they used to stay in the kitchen they used to\ncall me over and show me how to do this and how to do this. . So this way\nthat\u2019s how I made sure my family had food.\n12",
        "A: Maybe a year and a half.",
        "A: Until the Germans came. At that time they all escaped. We came back that was\non Saturday night, I'll never forget. We came back from a dance Saturday night,\nit must have been two or three o\u2019clock in the morning. Two, three o\u2019clock\nsummertime, the sun is already out in June. So I go home and I see all the Soviets\nbarefooted, one shoe on, one shoe off. They are running like crazy, like I\nkept asking what\u2019s happening? They said the Germans are back. They were at\nthat time also drunk and they came from dancing places or entertainment places\nand they came after midnight and they came to the barracks. Where we used to\nlive near the army barracks.",
        "A: Not too far, maybe a couple of miles, a couple of kilometers. That\u2019s how\nwe had enough food.",
        "A: I was always a good supplier. Even when I worked in the concentration camp,\nwhat do you think, how do I survive. I was three and one half years in Auschwitz.\nHow many survived? I also worked in the kitchen. When we came up in the\ntransport at Auschwitz so they started announcing they needed \u201cmescher\u201d\n(spelling) So you know what a \u201cmescher\u2019\u201d\u2019 is?",
        "A: That\u2019s it. A \u201cmescher\u201d so everybody is raising their hands. Give them a knife\nand a skin and check out how he cuts it. So help me God when I came over as\nsoon as I took the skin and the knife, he said \u201cdu bist gut.\u201d",
        "A: You mean when the Germans came in?",
        "A: First of all as soon as they came in they start grabbing Jews and throwing them\ninto the synagogues and burning up.\n13",
        "A: Immediately. Shooting and killing. People were afraid to go out they didn\u2019t\nknow what was going on because some of the Jewish people from Warsaw, from\nWaltz? They crossed they already told us the horror. And some of them\ntried to skip out and go into Russia, and some of them survived this way.",
        "A: No we were not. You couldn\u2019t imagine that people would kill people. You\ncouldn\u2019t imagine that kind of horror.",

        "A: We lived a little bit out of the center.",
        "A: Oh yes. Then they came after a few days and gave everybody a star. Then they\nformed the ghetto. My father remained home, we were not bombed out.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Our house was not in the ghetto section, our house. Our house had no choice to\nsave their . But we had to move. Every little thing in life is lucky. That guy\nI mentioned before used to take care on feeding the animals, the cows and the\npigs, we used to call him not exactly a maintenance man. He used to take down\nall the things from the stables, feeding the cows, milking the cows. His house\nwasn\u2019t far from the ghetto.\n14",
        "A: Soft things. We schlepped.",
        "A: They gave us, I don\u2019t know exactly, but they gave a short time, maybe a day or\ntwo. We were young guys. We made a big pack and we were walking with it.\nWhatever we could take we schlepped. We couldn\u2019t take too much because this\nhouse we lived in in the ghetto, they organized the Jewish Judenrat. Judenrat\nmeans a house. So many narrows (?) per person. That house, what do you think\nthey did, they took in my brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s family, my girlfriend\u2019s parents, we\nwere three families.",
        "A: No. They used to take us out . After awhile the ghetto got so filled up it\nwasn\u2019t enough room for the people. So they came to the conclusion they\u2019re going\nto evacuate some of the people from the ghetto to a little town called Pruzany not\nfar from Greece. So they first came out that the Judenrat they go by the ABC.\nThe second day was our next. So they loaded us up on trucks to take us to\nPruzany. We had to go through a control, a German control\nvery difficult to hear.",
        "A: No. . We were there a little while after Bialystok. From Pruzany,\nthen they took us out.",

I used to smuggle in a lot of food from the Germans. In the\nwintertime while they slept . It was nice and quiet I used to go out\nand take out some valuables and change it . We used to make like double\nbags and schlep cornmeal, beans, anything edible. Whatever came along. Corn\nflour we used to bake bread ;",
