        "Q:Let me begin, oh, by the way, this is Monday, January 12th, 1997.",
        "A:Can't be the 12th.",
        "Q:Pardon me? January 6th, you\u2019re right, do you by any chance wear a hearing aid?",
        "A:No, I don't.",
        "Q:You don't. Okay. I'm in Georgetown at the home of Seymour Rubin and I'd like to begin. If you\ncould give me some biographical information about yourself: when were you born and\nwhere were you raised and perhaps a little bit about your family and education before you\nwent to college.",
        "A: Well, I was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1914, April 6th, 1914, that makes me 82 years of age, as\nthe newspapers have indicated the other day, much to my wife's annoyance. I was raised in\nChicago, more or less, and I went to grammar school, junior high school and high school\nthere.",
        "Q:Telephone.",
        "A:Where are we now\u201d?",
        "Q:Your wife was annoyed that they put your age in the paper.",
        "A:Well, you want to start off again about Chicago?",
        "Q:Sure. Sure.",
        "A:I was born in Chicago in 1914. My parents both came here from Latvia and Russia at the age of\ntwo and three many, many years ago. And I went to school in Chicago in public schools:\ngrammar school, junior high school, high school.",
        "Q: Which part of Chicago?",
        "A:I was born on the West side of Chicago and my family gradually moved to the North side so that\nby the time I went to college, we were living in Wilmette, just North of the city of Chicago.\nI went to the University of Michigan, which 1s a nice state school, it had a regular reputation\nand was just a sufficient distance away from Chicago so I could get away from the family a\nlittle bit, but I could also get back -- by hitchhiking -- back, and get a meal when I needed\none. And then I went on from University of Michigan to the Harvard Law School where I\ngot my regular degree, Magna Cum Laude, and then I stayed on for an additional year and\ngot an L.L.M. at the suggestion of Felix Frankfurter(ph). I thereafter went down to the\nCircuit Court of Appeals in New York City and clerked for the person I consider to be one\nof the better judges, one of the best judges, really, in the United States, Augustus N. Hand,\nnot Learned Hand who was his cousin who was on the same court, but Gus Hand. I stayed\nwith him for a year and then came down to Washington. In Washington, the thesis was --\nmy thesis was -- that I was going to get a job, which I did get with the Securities and\nExchange Commission in the Reorganization Division. The reason for the Reorganization\nDivision being that it was the factor in the SEC which handled litigated cases, corporate\nreorganization cases, and I wanted to go back to Chicago and practice law with my two\nolder brothers in the field of corporate reorganization, which had been occupying a great\ndeal of their time. I never got back to Chicago because I left the SEC [phone rings] should I\nstop?",
        "Q:Back to Chicago...",
        "A:Well, I never got back to Chicago because I moved from the SEC to one of the wartime agencies,\nthe office of Price Administration here which seemed a little more exciting at the time as we\nwere just beginning to get into the war. And then from the office of Price Administration,\nmore by chance than anything else, I moved over to the State Department in March of 1943.",
        "Q:Before we go to the State Department, could I ask you about your, is your family Jewish?",
        "A:My family is Jewish. I was raised in the Reform aspect of the Jewish religion. I took Hebrew\nlessons which, unfortunately, I've completely forgotten about, and, I'm a reasonably non-\nconforming Jew.",
        "Q:And during the early days of National Socialism, you were in college and law school. Were you\nactively aware of what was happening, and was it something that was a major part of your\nview of the world at that time?",
        "A:Well, I wasn\u2019t tremendously aware of what was going on. I was... I read the newspapers all the\ntime and so I knew approximately what was going on, as much as one can gain from the\nnewspapers. I still remember being in college when Mr. Hitler came to power in Germany,\nand I remember talking about that with a history professor who curiously, whose name I\ncuriously enough still remember, Mr. Slossun(ph), his name was. A very distinguished\nprofessor, a very interesting professor. He said, \"Hitler will last a few months, that\u2019s all.\"\nThat was in 1933, when I was still in college, and I was aware of what was going on quite\nclearly. When I went to the Harvard Law School which was in 1935, I saw a lot of people\nthere and, as a matter of fact, I've, a group of other people and I got together and organized -\n- with a fellow named Nathan Isaacs(ph), who is a professor at the business school -- he\ncame over to my little apartment that I was sharing with a couple of other characters, and\nsort of gave us lessons in the Talmud, supposedly every Saturday. It lasted about three\nSaturdays and that was about it. But, so far as what was going on in Germany was\nconcerned, yes I was aware of it but I wasn\u2019t deeply involved in anything particular. I do\nremember being at a Harvard Law Review dinner one time and talking with one of the\nprofessors who was resentful about the fact that longshoremen in New York had been trying\nto prevent the unloading of goods from Germany, and he thought this was an unwarranted\ninterference by a private organization in the affairs of the United States Government. I\ndisagreed rather strongly with him at the time but didn't take a tremendous amount of act, I\ndid not take an active role, really, in anything going on. I had a little bit to do, not very\nmuch, with refugee matters. Partially because one of the people who eventually became my\npartner, and who was a year or two after me in law school, was very much involved in that.\nAnd I probably contributed a little bit to some organizations but I didn\u2019t do very much more\nthan that.",
        "Q:You mentioned that it was sort of by chance that you went to the State Department. Can you\ndescribe a little bit more about that chance?",
        "A:Yes, I can. As I said, I've spent a large amount of time in the Reorganization Division of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission when I first came down here to Washington. And\neventually in 1943, in early '43, a friend of mine, Bernard Melser(ph), who's still a Professor\nof Law, Emeritus, at the University of Chicago, called me. He was temporarily in the State\nDepartment. He was a very bright young man and he was about to go over to Europe, I think\nhe was in on the Nuremberg Trials, but he was in the State Department at the time. And he\ncalled me, and he said there was a very interesting thing going on there, and why didn't I\ncome over to the State Department and organize or work on something called the\nReorganization Program in the Foreign Funds Control Division of the Department of State.\nAnd I said, \"Bernie, that has absolutely nothing to do with corporate reorganization under\nChapter 10 of the Bank,\" -- well, Chapter 10 didn't exist, but 77B did -- \"under the\nBankruptcy Act at all. It's absolutely different.\" And he said, \"Well, you know that and I\nknow that, but nobody else knows that and you're the only person around who knows\nsomething about quote, 'reorganization.' Reorganization is reorganization is reorganization.\"\nSo, I thought it was a very interesting kind of thing, and went over to the State Department,\nand basically I was the fellow who was in charge of the program, which there was one, and\ntrying to run the Germans out of enterprises, primarily in Latin America. The reorganization\nprogram there was one which took into account the fact that a large number of business\nenterprises in Latin America, in particular, had been founded by German enterprises,\nFarben! and a variety of others. And the worry was that these enterprises would contribute\nto the Nazi war effort in at least two ways. One was by contributing of funds to a variety of\nvery evil causes; and the other was by contributing and financing espionage, or sabotage, or\n' IG Farben: A large German Chemical Cartel. Assets of this Cartel were cloaked by a Swiss\nholding company called \"Interhandel\" after the war. (Source: Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers:\nThe Mysterious World of Swiss Banking. New York: Viking, 1982.)\nworse. And the idea was, you had to allow the Latin Americans to continue to have the\nbenefits of these organizations, many of which were in the medical and drug,\npharmaceutical field. You couldn\u2019t just close down the organizations, so you had to continue\nto have the organizations do what they had been doing: producing drugs. But you wanted to\nget the German influence out of those, and that was the reorganization aspect: trying to\nintroduce, primarily at that time, American enterprise to come in and take over these\nenterprises. Certainly during the period of the war, and probably thereafter, because we\nalways had the theory that we didn\u2019t want the Germans to come back again in Latin\nAmerica, particularly in view of the fact that the National Socialist philosophy was one that\nwas anathema to most of us here.",
        "Q:Was that reorganization separate from the Safe Haven Program? Or was that part of it?",
        "A:The Safe Haven Program developed out of the Reorganization thing, that's right. I was one of the\noriginators of this, so called, Safe Haven Program. But that had the same kind of objective at\nit that the Reorganization Program did. Reorganization was supposed to: a) take care of the\npresent threat \u2014 try to get the German control away from these enterprises in Latin American\nso they couldn\u2019t contribute money; and secondly, the idea was to prevent any recurrence of\nthe German influence in Latin America. That, basically, was the Safe Haven Program,\nprevention of recurrence of Nazism, and fascism, and so forth.",
        "Q:But Safe Haven was an international effort, not just an American effort, is that, can you describe\nmore about Safe Haven and its beginnings?",
        "A:Well, Safe Haven was basically, my recollection is, it was basically an American initiative but we\ncertainly had the British involved in it from the very beginning. And it may have been\ninternational in the broader sense of the word, because I\u2019m sure, as what resulted, as a fact\nof the later days, the French got involved very heavily. But basically, at the beginning, the\nBritish and the Americans were the only ones who were able to do anything and it was a\nBritish-American effort, basically aimed at trying to identify German influence which one\ncould equate with Nazi influence at the time, and to try to get rid of that, not only at the\npresent time, but for, to prevent any recurrence of it. That was basically the Safe Haven\nProgram. What we were trying to do is locate areas where the Germans had located money,\nwhere Germans were cloaking or having somebody else cloak for them etcetera, etcetera.",
        "Q:And, specifically, what did you, what was your role in that effort?",
        "A:Well, I was trying to devise policies with respect, particularly in the beginning, with the Latin\nAmericans to try to persuade the Latin Americans, for example, to control the German\nenterprises, German owned enterprises in their territory. But, my first trip was down to\nColumbia and my effort down there was to try to persuade the Columbian government to\neither supervise or actually vest the assets belonging to German controlled enterprises and\nthen to have those administered in accordance with this reorganization program by Allies,\nby Americans, probably, because the Americans were the only ones really able to do this\nkind of thing but we would have said the British or the Dutch or anybody else, if there were\npeople like that around as well. But there weren\u2019t very many around.",
        "Q:So it was actually an effort to try and move American management in to take control of the\ncorporation, 1s that...",
        "A:Yes.",
        "Q:...what you were doing?",
        "A:Yes. Exactly. Because the idea was, you were, as I say, had two objectives. One was a wartime\nobjective, to prevent espionage and sabotage and financing of the German war effort and the\nsecond was a post-war effort which was akin with the idea, part of the idea that you didn't\nwant the German, Germans as they were then certainly, to come back in to any kind of\npolitical power in other areas of the world. We had some problems here in the United States,\nas you probably know, with... we also had a lot of problems with the possibility of Germans\ninfiltrating into the enterprises, particularly into the enterprises where they had been\nprominent in countries like Bolivia, Columbia, Argentina, etcetera, in Latin America. That\nwas the part of the world that I was very much involved with. The entire enterprise had\nsome people from, for example, one of my good friends, Kovi(ph) Oliver, who 1s still\naround, a very distinguished, now former, ambassador of the United States to Colombia\nmany years after this, was stationed in Madrid. A good many of the people who were\ninvolved in this when I got into it, were Americans who spoke good Spanish because Latin\nAmerica was one of the areas of our concentration. We would find a lot of the people\ninvolved in this were people who had been born in El Paso, as Kovi(ph) was, or in some\nplace in Texas who spoke Spanish as well as they did English, or nearly as well. Kovi\nprobably spoke it better.",
        "Q:And that was 1943 when you went to the State Department...",
        "A:1943 was when I came into it. The effort had been going on for awhile before that. I came into\nthis Division of Foreign Funds Control, which was basically trying to look at the financial\ntransactions of people who might be supporting the Axis, and what we were trying to do\nwas to prevent any financial transactions which would have been of benefit to them. There\nwere a variety of aspects of that. One was to blacklist companies, either in the United States\nor elsewhere, primarily elsewhere, because we had direct control over the United States. But\nwe were trying to blacklist companies, mainly from the neutral countries who were doing\nbusiness with the Germans.",
        "Q:Can you mention what some of those companies are, were?",
        "A:They were, we were, we had a blacklist which was maintained in Switzerland, Sweden, Spain,\nPortugal, Argentina, Columbia, Turkey, a variety of other countries. Basically, wherever we\nthought, what we could do would be to prevent a financial transaction which would have\nbeen beneficial to the... to the Germans. We were active in trying to say-- to the enterprises,\nmainly, or to individuals, but mainly these would be enterprises, individuals acting as\nenterprises, as well-- we were trying to say to them, \"If you do this, you're not going to have\nany access, whatsoever, to any American facilities. And we will not only prevent you now\nfrom dealing with the United States, selling to the United States or getting exports from the\nUnited States, but we will continue this effort after the war in order to prevent you from\nrebuilding the thing.\"",
        "Q:Could you mention some of the enterprises that we\u2019re dealing with, some of the German\nenterprises?",
        "A:Well, the, Sterling Drug was one of the enterprises; IG Farben\u2019, of course, is the largest one.\nThere were a whole slew of corporations in Sweden which had been manufacturing ball\nbearings for other machine parts and things like that, who were all on the blacklist. My\nrecollection does not go to the individual names very much. We had a few Americans on the\nblacklist, some American nationals living in Vichy France... France were suspected of\ndealing with the Germans, and we blacklisted American nationals. That raised some issues\nhere but we did it nonetheless. But, one of the real reasons for the negotiations with the\nSwiss in 1946 was the fact that the blacklist still existed and there were a number of Swiss\ncorporations which were still on the blacklist and they were obviously desirous of getting\nthem off the blacklist. We were desirous of restoring normal relations, too. But the principal\nmotive for the negotiations on the Swiss side, was to eliminate the blacklist.",
        "Q:I want to lay as much groundwork for the Swiss negotiations as possible. So we're now at '43, '44.\nYou have come to the State Department and you're sort of gradually becoming part of the\nSafe Haven Program, 1s this right?",
        "A:Yes, except not gradually.",
        "Q:Not gradually. It didn\u2019t happen gradually.",
        "A:No, it didn\u2019t happen gradually. I was there in the beginning and was very active in it. Largely\nbecause I came to the State Department in 1943 as a very healthy young man with very,\nvery bad eyes. And though I tried to get into the Navy, they threw me out, laughing all the\ntime. And then the Army called me down for the draft twice and they examined me from\nstem to stern and found I was a very, very healthy specimen until they got to my eyes. Then\nthey couldn\u2019t believe how bad they were and I got thrown out again. So I was one of the\n2 During the war, IG Farben had many holding companies, and/or branches all over the world,\neven in the United States. (See Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss\nBanking, pgs. 144-160.)\nvery few youngish males around here, at the time, who had had a fairly good education,\nHarvard and so forth, who was around at the time, who was not going into the Army. Most\nof the people my age were not married at the time (although I got married just at the same\ntime that I went into the State Department), but if we were married, we didn\u2019t have kids,\netcetera, so most of my colleagues went into the Army or the Air Force or whatever. And I\nhappened to be around, so I moved up in that absolutely new area for State Department\nwork very, very quickly. And basically, I was one of the originators of it, and so forth.",
        "Q:In, I think 1t was Bower's(ph) book, about the, The Paper Clip Conspiracy, he quoted you as\nsaying that you, one of the reasons you thought you moved up quickly in the State\nDepartment, because there some sort of renewed anti-Semitism backlash, because of senior\nState Department positions earlier. Can you sort of explain what that scene was like?",
        "A:I speculated with Mr. Bower(ph) a little bit about this, \u2019've never been quite sure about it, but I\ndid move up. If you take a look at my record in the State Department, I moved up from the\nentry level to high in the Civil Services, I could go very, very quickly. And there always was\na rumor around that the State Department was rather anti-Semitic. I always thought that\nthere were some people in the old Foreign Service who were, although I had many, many\nfriends in the Foreign Service who had no anti-Semitism whatsoever, and I developed these\nfriendships as time went along. But it seemed to me, at the very beginning, that perhaps one\nreason that I was promoted as quickly as I was, was because I was what you might call a\nrespectable Jew. I'd been to the Harvard Law School, I\u2019d been on the Harvard Law Review,\nI'd been a clerk for a very distinguished WASP?, a judge up in New York City, etcetera,\netcetera. I knew which fork to pick up at the dinner table, etcetera. And I was reasonably\nrespectable. And it seemed to me that there was some possibility that when people looked\naround they said, well, here\u2019s a fellow, we really want to do something about this anti-Nazi\nprogram, here\u2019s a guy who happens to know a lot about it and who is very competent and\n> WASP: White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.\nwho is respectable and, you know, he's the kind of person we would like to push forward. So\nI did get to be the Chief of the Division 1n a very, very short period of time and, after that the\nDeputy Director of the office, and after that the first Assistant Legal Advisor for Economic\nAffairs, etcetera, etcetera. Whether this had much to do with my being Jewish or not Jewish,\nI really don't know except that I had a... I always had a sort of a little bit of a feeling that\nwell, maybe, everybody thought well, this is a, quote, good Jew, unquote.",
        "Q:But the anti-Semitism, as you said, was not an issue for you. You didn\u2019t experience it directly in\nthe State Department.",
        "A:No, I never experienced it directly in the State Department. The only experience I ever had with\nreally discussing it in any, even remote way, was in connection with Mr. Bower\u2019s book, The\nPaperclip Conspiracy, indicated that I was one of the people in the State Department who\nwas most in favor of pursuing what had been Mr. Roosevelt's policy of keeping well-known,\nvery active Nazis out of the United States, both then and probably forever. And there was a\nprogram which was near and dear to the hearts of the United States Army people which was\nto bring German scientists, particularly rocket scientists, to the United States to help us in\nour rocket program. The Germans obviously had been well-advanced in the rocket program,\nway ahead of almost anybody else. And it wasn\u2019t Warner Von Brown(ph) and people like\nthat, but they wanted to bring a lot more people in. That raised the question as to how many\nof these people you should bring into the United States, contrary to what had been the\npublicly stated policy, as I recall, of President Roosevelt, that, well, no Nazis, or active\nNazis, were not going to get into the United States. I was a little more, a lot more perhaps,\nageressive in the saying, we ought to have very, very strict standards of necessity and utility,\nbringing these people into the United States than the Army really wanted to adopt. As far as\nI could tell, back in those days, the Army officers, in Germany particularly, would go out\nand they would find somebody who'd swept the floor in the rocket establishment. They\nwanted to bring him to the United States on the grounds that he would contribute to the...\nour own effort to develop rocket technology. I had a little discussion about that, I wrote a\nmemorandum about it, as a matter of fact, one time, and I got into a dispute, which is in...\naccounted in Mr. Bower's book, with a very good friend of mine named Clare Wilcox(ph),\nfor whom I worked, as a matter of fact, a little bit later, in trade matters. He was a very\ndistinguished economist from Swarthmore and I'm sure he had not the slightest bit of anti-\nSemitism in him, not the slightest. But he thought that I was being a little too sensitive about\nthe possibility that if you brought some of these Nazis into the United States they would\ncontribute to what was then, to a certain extent, the latent anti-Semitism of certain people in\nthe United States. I'd lived in New York when I was clerk for Gus Hand, and back in those\ndays, there was a guy named Fritz Coon(ph) who was around, who was a well-known\nAmerican Nazi. In any case, Wilcox and I got into a dispute which was reflected in a couple\nof memos back and forth in which Clare(ph) basically said he was just as anti-Nazi as I was\nbut he didn\u2019t think that this was the... it was appropriate, we were trying to keep too many\npeople out of the United States who would be useful, etcetera. And I had a little discussion\nby memorandum with him. The fact that it never really became personal was evidenced by\nthe fact that sometime a little bit later, Clare Wilcox(ph) was the Deputy Chairman of our\ndelegation to the International Trade Organization in 1947-48, and I was the legal advisor to\nthat delegation. I was one of Clare's(ph) principal assistants if you can call it that, at that\ntime. And he and I became very, very good friends. So I don't think that, well, that\ndiscussion took place largely, I think, because I had said that there were too many of these\nNazis, or people who were likely to be Nazis, who were getting into the United States under\ncolor of necessity and I really wanted to have a very strict standard applied. I still remember,\nwe sent somebody around to Vanovar Bush(ph) maybe we sent Vanovar Bush(ph) around to\nMr. Conant(ph). I've forgotten which way it went. One of them was in the government...\nTape #1, Side B",
        "A:One of them was in the government and one of them was not, as I recall. To explore the question\nof how many of these scientists really would contribute to our rocket technology if they\nwere brought into the United States. And I do recall that, as we got back, was, well, you\ncould bring a few of these people in, not too terribly many of them, and you could get\neverything you needed out of them in a period of about six months. I'm not sure that that's\nentirely the case, because I suppose if somebody had developed something that really has\nbeen very good at one point, you can probably expect to get more things out of him as he\nwent along, in the future. But, my recollection is that that was the reason for Mr. Bower's\nbook, The Paperclip Conspiracy, basically.",
        "Q:Right. The United States took what's, I understand, has been described as a very tough roll against\nthe neutral countries. Can you describe the attitude, maybe even the position, of the State\nDepartment going into the Swiss negotiations in 1946. And I guess I need you to sort of lay\nthe groundwork with the Paris Agreements the year before.",
        "A:Well, I'll go back even before the Paris Agreement. The Pottsdam(ph) Agreement, signed,\nbasically, the assets in the neutral countries of German nationals, to the Western Allies with\nrespect to reparation purposes. So that the theory was that we would take, the... we'd get\nreparations from the Germans, and not only from Germany itself, the occupied areas, but\nalso from the areas where Germans had interests in the neutral countries. And the Paris\nAgreement decided on how those assets, how all of the reparations to be taken from\nGermany, would be divided up among all of the Western Allies. Because the only people\npresent, the only countries present at the Pottsdam Agreement, were the United States, Great\nBritain, and the Soviet Union. So, Paris had to do something about allocating the proceeds,\nallocating the amounts that would be given to the various Allied countries, whether they\nhappened to be Belgium, Holland, or the United States, and so forth. The Paris Agreement\nalso worked out a formula -- because even then we were concerned about refugees and the\npeople who were left homeless, the persecutees and so forth -- had worked out an agreement\nthat a portion of what was recovered would be allocated to what was then the\nIntergovernmental Committee for Refugees, and through the Intergovernmental Committee\nfor Refugees primarily it was decided -- I'm not sure if this was in Paris or a little bit later --\nto the Jewish Agency* and the Joint Distribution Committee.\u00b0 [phone ringing] The machine\nwill pick that up, I hope. In any case, the Paris Agreement was one in which we were\nallocating the proceeds of the reparations which were scheduled to come from Germany.\nNow, part of those proceeds, obviously, were the assets of German, of the German entities,\nand German individuals located in the neutral countries. And that laid the background for\nthe negotiations with the Swiss and then later with the Swedes and the Spanish and the\nPortuguese and, even to a certain limited extent, with the Turks. Because we knew there\nwere a lot of German assets located in Switzerland; Switzerland had been right there at the\ncenter of Europe, it was a financial center and so forth. And there was no question but that\nthere were a lot of German assets in Switzerland. So we began these negotiations on the\nthesis that what we were after, in accordance with the Paris Reparation Agreements, the\nUnited States, Great Britain and France, as agents of all the other Allies, were to secure\nthese assets which were located in the neutral countries and put them into the reparations\npot, which would be administered eventually by the Interallied Reparations Agency, which\nhad been established and which was functioning in Brussels. So, we began the negotiations\nwith the Swiss, basically, on that thesis: That what we were doing was to look for the\nGerman assets in Switzerland and put them in the reparations pot. On the Swiss side, the\nnegotiations, as I said a moment ago, were useful, if you want to put it that way, because\nwhat they were aiming for was to get rid of the freezing and the blocking which was the\nresult of the proclaimed list of certain blocked nationals, the formal name for the blacklist.\nSo that we had some incentive on both sides to go ahead and negotiate. On the Allied side,\nwhen we started the negotiations, before we actually got into the negotiations, we began to\n* Jewish Agency for Palestine was established in 1922 and recognized in Article 4 of the Palestine\nMandate as a public body to advise and cooperate with the British administration of Palestine in\neconomic, social and other matters that affected the establishment of the Jewish National Home.\n> American Joint Jewish Distribution Committee (JDC) was founded as a philanthropic agency in\n1914 to aid Jews in need all over the world. It played an active role in rescuing Jewish refugees\nfrom Nazi Germany.\nthink about this, and if we were thinking about taking over the German assets in\nSwitzerland, we began to worry about what are, quote, the \"German assets in Switzerland.\"\nAnd at that point, maybe before, it was certainly on all of our minds, but articulating it, we\nbegan to say the formula, \"The enemies...or our enemies... are our friends.\" And we were\nnot going to take over the assets, even though they had originated from somebody 1n Berlin,\nif they belonged to a persecutee. That is, the assets of Mr. Hans Schmidt, a good German\nNazi, which were located in Switzerland, were different from the assets of Mr. Chaim\nCohen, who had died in Bergen-Belsen or in Auschwitz or in someplace like that. Equally a\ncitizen, formerly a citizen of Berlin who had deposited assets in Switzerland. So, when we\nbegan the negotiations, we had basically these, the overall objective of securing the German\nassets in Switzerland, and the subsidiary, but not very subsidiary, deviation from that\nobjective, of exempting and making sure that the persecutees got whatever they possibly\ncould get out of that.",
        "Q:How did you go about determining what those figures were?",
        "A:Well, in the first place, we didn't determine what the figures were. The first thing we did, was to\nsay in effect, \"If there's a German asset, so-called German assets in Switzerland, and you\nidentify it, and Mr. Cohen who used to be living in Berlin, comes over there and says, \"Hey,\nI was a persecutee, I survived Bergen-Belsen, here I am, I want my property back,\u2019 you, the\nSwiss, nobody else, takes that asset and puts it into the reparation pot.\" -- Just as we, in the\nUnited States, were returning the assets of persecutees who could turn up here and identify\nthe assets. Even though they were, quote, in quotes, \"German assets.\" We demanded that the\nSwiss do exactly the same. And as far as I know, there was never any objection to that on\nthe part of the Swiss. And as far as I know, every German Jew who turned up in Switzerland\nand could identify his assets, got those assets back.",
        "Q:Was that a significant number, do you have any idea how significant that number was?",
        "A:I have no idea how many assets there were, but I assume there were a number of people,\nparticularly perhaps, more from Germany than from the other occupied areas. Because the\nGermans, in effect, had more notice. I mean, Hitler was there in 1932, '33, and it was a long\ntime before the controls really fell into place, before the Final Solution was begun to be\nworked on and so forth. And the German Jews were likely to be more prosperous than the\nHungarian or the Rumanian Jews, although there were a lot of prosperous Rumanian and\nHungarian Jews, maybe even Bulgarians, and Polish. So, the German Jews had some notice\nand, despite the fact that there were controls which were enacted by the Germans, I'm sure\nthere was a considerable period of time when those controls could be successfully evaded.\nSo, I suspect, a large number of German Jews actually did get their money out of\nSwitzerland [sic]. One way or another. Maybe before the war actually broke out, maybe\neven during the war. The amounts, I have not the slightest idea. Really. I don't think we ever\ntried to make any evaluation of how many German Jewish assets there were in Switzerland,\nsay, in 1932, at the beginning of the war before things really began to get terrible. And so,\nwe had no way of knowing how much would have been recovered by German Jews who\ncame out. Whether the Swiss would have figures on somebody who turned up at the bank,\nand was able to identify the bank number, and was able to say, \"I am the survivor,\" or, \"I am\nactually the guy who put the money there and I want to get it back now.\" And how many of\nthose people actually turned up and got their money out, that I just do not know. I don't\nknow whether anybody knows it. Maybe some people do, maybe if you went back and did\nthis kind of study that Mr. Volcker is doing, maybe you could go back through all those old\nrecords and you could find that people did actually turn up and did recover their assets. I'm\nsure that a large number of them did. That is not to say that a large number of them did not.\nBut a large number of them did. As I say, I suspect in the case of the German Jews, it would\nhave been more likely that they got the money out than the case of the Hungarians and the\nothers who thought that, \"Well, it's not going to come here,\" the Czechs or whatever, who\nthought, \"We are going to be protected.\" I know there was a lot of people in, say, Austria,\nwho had money in Switzerland, and who came out and then went back into Austria, because\nthey thought that nothing was going to happen to them. But, in most of those cases, they had\ntheir families out before they went back. We know a number of people would back and then,\nof course, they got caught.",
        "Q:We're talking about individuals now. We're going into the negotiations, what about other assets in\nSwiss banks, especially the question of gold.",
        "A:Well, the question of gold, there are two different questions there. If I can go back, the other\nassets you wanted to talk about, let me talk about the other assets. There were a lot of assets\ndeposited in Switzerland by German, Hungarian, etcetera, Jews, everybody was putting their\nmoney in, whether it was Jewish or not. But the Jews had a particular reason and a lot of\nthose assets were never claimed. Because the people died in concentration camps, not only\nthey died, but all of their heirs and so forth died. Now, on those assets, those I take it are\nwhat we are talking about here, so far as these negotiations are concerned. There probably\nare still a substantial number of those around. Because the Swiss never did what I and a\nvariety of other people urged them to do at the end of the war, do the kind of census that Mr.\nVolcker and his group are doing at the present time. It's very difficult, I think, to get any\nclear figures down to the last penny or Swiss franc or whatever, as to how many of these\nassets there were, and maybe you could never really identify all of them. But, because we\ndiscovered here in the United States when we tried to do a similar thing, it was very, very\ndifficult to identify heirless assets. Just by names and things like that. But, to a certain\nextent, a lot of those assets did exist in Germany, and they could have had a census. Perhaps\nnot as elaborate as the one which is being conducted now because it would have been\ntimelier then. Now, Mr. Volcker has to go back over all these years and check back records.\nAnd banks have disappeared, and accounts have been transferred, etcetera, etcetera. Then,\nthat was not the case; they could have done a census and, while I don't think they would\nhave been able to identify every heirless asset, particularly since names are ambiguous, as\nwe discovered here in the United States. The name Burger might be Warren Burger(ph) of\nthe Supreme Court, it might be my friend, Raul(ph) Burger, who is Jewish. And this Warren\nBurger is not Jewish. Burger is a good German name, it Just means an inhabitant of the city.",
        "But, in any case, we would not have gotten down to the last penny, but they could have done\nsomething at that time. Now, I think that they are going back, and to a certain extent, I think\nMr. Volcker and his group, and maybe even the Swiss group which is doing some different\nkind of survey, will be able to locate some of these, the assets. So, what we were talking\nabout in the negotiations, also were these heirless assets and we were trying to insist, we did\ninsist, that the heirless assets be put in the hands of somebody. Question: Who 1s that\nsomebody? Well, if a German Jew came out and he identified the asset as being his own, he\ngot it back. That we settled from the very beginning. If he were not alive and neither was\nanybody else who survived him, the question is: What happens to those German Jewish\nassets which are, in a true sense, heirless? And there, all we could get out of the Swiss was a\nstatement of sympathetic consideration. They would give consideration, sympathetic\nconsideration, to the desirability of identifying those assets and making them available to\none of the relief organizations. The relief organization we had in mind at the moment, was\nthe Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees, which was succeeded by the IRO, the\nInternational Refugee Organization. And both of those used, as a operating agency, the Joint\nDistribution Committee and the Jewish Agency for Palestine, I guess it was at the time. So,\nthat was the situation with respect to heirless assets and the negotiations, as I say, came to a\nconclusion, not a very satisfactory conclusion on that basis, with the Swiss saying they\nwould give sympathetic consideration to doing something about this, but without any firm\ncommitment on their side. I think they regret now not having given us a firm commitment,\nand I regret 1t very much, and people who might have benefited from these assets would\nregret it, I suppose, most of all. So that was the situation with respect to the heirless assets.\nAnd we've been negotiating, fighting, doing something about them almost ever since. In my\nown case... and, I left the State Department in 1948, and I became... I went into the private\npractice of law, but one of my principal clients was a foreign relations aspect of the\nAmerican Jewish Committee,\u00b0 and I worked on their behalf a very, very... a lot of hours,\nanyway. And did a lot of things in connection with Jewish claims. And one of the things I\ndid was to continue to pursue this business of the heirless assets in Switzerland, so that\nsometime, I think, in 1951, I was in, actually went to Switzerland and had a meeting with\nthe American Legation as it still was then, the Embassy, and we went over to the Swiss\nForeign Office or the Ministry of Justice, I've forgotten which, to talk about this issue. And\nhad a rather frustrating meeting over then, over in that office. I think that was 1951. I would\nhave to take a look at the record to make sure. So much for heirless assets at that time.",
        "Q:At the end of those negotiations, can you remember how you felt about the conclusion that you\nhad reached? Was it, did you feel at the time that it was... given the situation, that it was\nsatisfactory, that you'd done what you could do? I mean, I know this is 20/20, we all have\n20/20 hindsight.",
        "A:Forty years later.",
        "Q:No, I mean, 20/20 hindsight.",
        "A:Oh, 20/20 hindsight, oh.",
        "Q:Yeah, it's 40 years later, but can you recall what you were thinking at the time when those\nnegotiations finished?",
        "A:Sure. I remember very, very well. I was not very happy with the conclusion of the negotiations,\nparticularly on this question of heirless assets. We thought we had achieved pretty much\nwhat we were able to achieve and what we could achieve in connection with the general\nreclaiming of German assets for the reparations pot. Even there, there were problems,\nbecause, basically what we did, in the end, was to say to the Swiss, \"Okay, you're, you will\nidentify all the German assets. Now, I'm talking about German assets, excluding the Jewish\n\u00b0\"The American Jewish Committee was founded in 1906 as a Jewish defense organization in\nreaction to anti-Jewish pogroms in Tzarist Russia. During Nazi era: Urged the United States to\nintervene on behalf of the persecuted Jews of Europe. Post-war: Concerned with restitution,\nresettlement, reparations, indemnification, and immigration to the United States.\" (Source: Archives\nof the Holocaust, v. 17, Introduction by Frederick Bogin.)\nones, but, you will identify all the German assets in Switzerland and you will liquidate,\nunder the supervision of something called the Swiss Compensation Office, all of those\nassets. And then, what you will do with the proceeds, you will turn 50 percent of those over\nto the Allies to put into the pot of the Interallied Reparation Agency, and the other 50\npercent you will retain for your own claims against Germany.\" -- Because the Swiss were\narguing that they had a lot of claims against Germany themselves and so forth. And all of\nthese German assets in Switzerland should not go to somebody else, they should go to the\nSwiss claimants who had perfectly legitimate claims against Switzerland [sic]. Now, the\nquestion of whether it was a 50/50 split, whether that was fair or not, I never thought that\nthat should have been quite that way. I always thought we should have had 60 percent, or 70\npercent, or... if not 100 percent, but that was not really satisfactory, but it seemed to me, and\nI think it seemed to everybody else there, the best we could do with the Swiss. The only\nweapon we had at the time was the continued existence of the blacklist. And that was a very\nfragile weapon at the time. People don't remember that, but nobody really wanted to\ncontinue the blacklist in the period 1946, '47 on, we were normalizing all of our relations.\nAnd, in point of fact, even in Germany, the attitude -- for Germany, I should say -- the\nattitude was changing a great deal. You had, at one point in '43, '44, '45, the Morgenthau\u2019\nPlan on the one side, which would say, well, let's reduce Germany to an agrarian state. And\nthen you had, after we came in and we were occupying Germany, the views of people like\nGeneral Clay and others, who said, well, the only way in which this economy can survive\nand which can prevent starvation, is if they go back to being an industrial nation, which they\nwere before. And, in the end, of course, the United States put a tremendous amount of\nmoney into Germany instead of taking it out. So, there was a certain attitude on their part,\nthat we couldn't keep the proclaimed list in existence very much longer. And I still\n\u2019 Henry Morgenthau, Secretary of the Treasury.\nremember, we went up on the Hill,* I can't remember exactly which Senator we saw, but one\nof the relevant Senators at the time, and told him about the deal we were working on at the\ntime, and he said, well, that's probably the best you can do, why don't you accept the deal,\nand let it go at that. So, on that side, we were reasonably satisfied, but not entirely satisfied.\nOn the side of the heirless assets, I never was very satisfied with it. But, I couldn't see what\nelse we were going to be able to do because the pressure on us to bring these negotiations to\nan end was very strong. The United States, I think, was stronger on this than anybody else,\nincluding the British. The British were on our side, but they always had problems about re-\nestablishing their relations with Switzerland, with the Swiss banking system, and the\nFrench...",
        "Q:They were afraid of alienating the Swiss? What was, can you... I know you were very much\ninvolved in discussions with the British. Can you go into more detail about that?",
        "A:The British wanted to re-establish normal relations with the Swiss. The Swiss had been a neutral\ncountry. The British lawyers had, perhaps, the same attitude that a lot of American\ninternational lawyers had, except that that seemed to me to be a little stronger in the Foreign\nOffice there than it was in the State Department here, maybe because I and a couple of other\npeople like myself were in the State Department, but, basically, the attitude was that the\nneutrals had a perfectly good nght to deal with whoever they were going to deal with. That,\nbasically, is the essence of neutrality. And to a certain extent, that is a policy which had been\nestablished by the United States way back in the 1800's when we enacted the Neutrality Act.\nWe were able to deal with the French when the British thought we shouldn't be dealing with\nthe French in the French-British wars. But, in any case, we were very strong on this subject\nof not dealing with the Germans and, basically, we had no particular strength in retaining the\nproclaimed list. So we came to the conclusion that we might as well, the best thing we could\ndo would be to conclude the agreements on the basis we did, which gave us the money we\n* Capitol Hill.\nwanted, pretty much, so far as German assets, strictly German assets were concerned.\nWhich gave us a statement that they would look sympathetically at the whole business of\nheirless assets. And we thought we could probably work out something on that and we\nwould be able to get them to do a census so that we would be able to find out what the\nheirless assets were, and so that we could take those assets and turn them over to the\nIntergovernmental Committee for Refugees. And that's where we were when we came to a\nconclusion. Satisfactory? No, this interview which was done with me in the Post, I thought it\nwas a pretty good and fair story, a lot of my friends have told me that I shouldn't be too\nunhappy because I expressed a view that maybe we could have done better. Well, I've never\nbeen in a negotiation, almost never been in a negotiation, where I thought I had done the\nabsolute best that I possibly could at the beginning of negotiation. And I am not now, and\nwas not then, unhappy with what we came out with. I thought it was a reasonably\nsatisfactory conclusion. But, not completely satisfactory.",
        "Q:Let's talk also about the issue of gold which we skipped over.",
        "A:Okay, looted gold, I'll get back to that. There, you have to make a distinction with respect to the\nquestion of looted gold. The main body of looted gold that we were talking about back in\nthose days when we started negotiating with the Swiss and with the others, the Portuguese\nas well, was the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of the Central Bank depositories.\nYou have to know that the large amount of gold that was on deposit in Belgium, in Brussels,\nwas moved to Switzerland, and maybe down to Dakar(ph) and re-smelted and so forth. But\nthat was Belgian government Central Bank gold. And what we were then making sure of,\ntrying to make sure of basically, was that the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of\nevery Central Bank depository, which was basically where gold was kept, was restituted at\nthe end and that's the gold which we have, basically, gotten back. To the extent of about 60\nor 70 or maybe even 80 percent of it. That is the gold which, basically, has been distributed\nby the International Gold Commission, a tripartite commission on gold, which is more or\nless affiliated with the institutions in Brussels, and which as been restored, a part of which\nhas been restored even fairly recently, to the Albanians, who lost gold from their central\ndepositories and so forth. That is one aspect. That's the major part of the, quote, the \"looted\ngold\" that went to Germany and which was used by the Germans for their own purposes.\nThe second part of the looted gold, was the gold which was taken out of the teeth of\nconcentration camp victims, the gold bracelets that came off the wrists of women, etcetera,\netcetera. And in that particular category of quote, \"looted gold,\" unquote, we generally\nincluded looted gold and other assets because, in that same general category, we're talking\nabout paintings, valuable silverware, etcetera, etcetera. All the valuables, the personal\nvaluables that people would have. Now, a certain amount of that, going back strictly to the\ngold, was looted by the gold... looted by the Germans, and melted down by them, and used\nby them for their own wartime purposes. I hesitate a little bit when I say \"wartime\npurposes,\" because I am reasonably convinced without having any particular proof of it, that\na substantial amount of that went into the pockets of the individuals, the individual Germans\nwho were there in the concentration camps, the guards, etcetera, etcetera, the people who\nhad control of it, and so forth. The Germans were pretty good at keeping track of things like\nthis because they didn't want the guards to be profiting instead of the authorities back in\nBerlin, but I'm sure that, since in almost every other case there's been some individual\nlooting, there probably would have been a considerable amount of individual looting in this\nparticular case. So, some of that, though, may have disappeared into the pockets of the\nguards, etcetera. But a large amount of that gold went back to smelting establishments in\nGermany and was smelted down. And then, probably, having been smelted, had the\nReichsbank stamps put on it. And, all in all, probability, the Reichsbank stamps dated back\nfive or ten years or something like that so that it looked just like gold that had been in the\nReichsbank Central Bank depositories for years. Now, the Swiss knew at the beginning of\nthe war, approximately how much gold reserves the German central bank did have. And\nthey know that during the course of the war, more gold went through Switzerland than was\nin those depositories at the beginning. So, everybody there, I think, has been conscious of\nthe fact that a large part of that gold had to be looted in one sense or the other. In the sense\nof having come from the central bank depositories of the, what should have been Belgian\ngold, or Albanian gold, or French gold or something like that, Central Bank gold, and on the\nother side, gold that came out of the concentration camps or out of just stealing the stuff\nfrom the Jews who had not been put into a concentration camp, but whose homes were\nlooted. So, that gold has been a substantial part of the discussion. The question of what\nactually happened with respect to the gold that passed through Switzerland, or came into\nSwitzerland, is, I think, one that maybe Mr. Volcker\u2019 and others will be able to find out\nmore clearly about. A large part of that gold, I think, was just transferred back, transferred\nby the Germans, converted into Swiss francs, and the Swiss francs were used by the\nGermans to purchase whatever it was they wanted to purchase, war materials in the first\nplace, or something else. Some of that gold probably remained in Switzerland. How much\nremained in Switzerland, I do not know. I don't, I doubt that very much of it did remain in\nSwitzerland, because I think it had all been used, to the extent that it possibly could be used.\nWe did work out an agreement with the Swiss in which they would make a payment on\naccount of looted gold to the International, the Tripartite Gold Commission. And a payment\nof that sort was made. Beyond that, I don't know. How much of this gold can be identified as\nhaving come from the people who were in the concentration camps and how much their\nclaims, therefore, should be, I do not know. I notice in the newspapers, there was some\ncomplaint about the fact that the amount of money that's still in the Federal Reserve in New\nYork, under the control of the Tripartite Gold Commission, some payments were being\nmade to governments, like the Albanian government, rather than to individuals. Since the\ngovernments got back less than, a lot less than 100% of what was looted from them, I'm not\nsure that that's a legitimate complaint. I think the governments are entitled to get their gold\nback. How much of the gold that came out of teeth, etcetera, etcetera, actually went into\n? Paul Volcker.\nSwitzerland, one does not really know. It may be, as people now tell me, nobody told me at\nthe time, that one could identify the gold that came out of bracelets and teeth and so forth, as\nhaving had that kind of origin. Because that gold has in it, elements which are not found in\nthe gold which comes out of a mine, which is then smelted and cast into a monetary bar.\nBut, on this, I really have very little knowledge.",
        "Q:Could you talk about the negotiations themselves? You mentioned to me when we spoke last\nweek, the names of some of the Swiss negotiating team, the tenor of the meetings. It went\non, the meetings went on for two months, I guess.",

        "A:Yes.",
        "Q:Can you talk about some of those sort of aspects of the, of the talks?",
        "A:Sure. Well, the, the, the Swiss negotiations were, as I said, the first negotiations we went on.\nLater was the Swedish negotiations here in, in, in Washington, there was a substantial\ncontrast, in the tone, really, of the two. But to talk about the Swiss, the Swiss delegation was\nheaded by Walter Stucki, who was a very eminent Swiss ambassador. I\u2019ve forgotten what\nother posts he held but he was a pretty high dignitary\u2019\u00ae so far as the Swiss government was\n'\u00a9 Walter Stucki was a senior official at the Swiss Political Department. (See Nicholas Faith,\nSafety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss Banking, pg. 140.)\nconcerned. I think he had been the Swiss ambassador to Vichy France, as a matter of fact.\nAnd he headed the delegation. He was a tall, stern, balding fellow and rather severe in\nappearance, I would say, and a little remote 1n tone, in tone and so forth. The second man on\nthe Swiss delegation, as far as I can recall, was a fellow named Rappard, who was a very\npleasant, genial, very distinguished Swiss international lawyer whose name is\ncommemorated in the Rappard Institute in Geneva at the present time which is one of the\nworld\u2019s leading institutions in the field of the study of international law. And he was one of\nthe people with whom I dealt most extensively because I have a legal background and he\nwas a lawyer and so forth. Other members to the delegation I don\u2019t remember too well.\nThere apparently was a fellow named Heerch(ph) or Hersh(ph) or something like that,\nwhom I must say I can\u2019t recall at all. There was another member, the junior member of the\ndelegation, named Geeterom(ph). Gee, his last name was Durham, D-U-R-H-A-M, who I\nthink is no longer in existence but may be, and my recollection is that there was another\nfellow who was also around in the background, sort of, named Paul Jolles, J-O-L-L-E-S,\nwho I think 1n later years was a rather distinguished Swiss government official in the field of\ninternational trade, which is the field that I followed in years later, myself. The member of\nthe Swiss delegation, I think, was a fellow named Ernst Shtayburger(ph), who was here in\nthe Swiss legation at the time and who became a very good friend of mine in years\nthereafter. Wrote some pieces when he was in private life in, in Switzerland about the fact\nthat there had been a lot of cloaking in, in Switzerland. And...",
        "Q:Cloaking is?",
        "A:Cloaking in the sense of Swiss using their names to disguise the fact that a particular asset was\nreally a German asset. For example, the biggest case, which was one, one that causes a lot of\ndifficulty and which you find a lot about in the records of the Justice Department here and\nso forth, was the IG Chemie case. IG Chemie was a Swiss corporation. It was accused by us\nand by others of being a cloak for I.G. Farben. And the holdings in the United States of IG\nChemie included General Dyestuff(ph) Corporation which was a very large aspect that\nclosely connected with General Aniline and Film, which again, was a very large company\nwhich rivaled Kodak at one time. But General Aniline Film and General Dyestuff were\nAmerican corporations, presumably owned by IG Chemie. Our, our, our argument was that\nIG Chemie was really a cloak for IG Farben. And that's what I mean by cloaking. There\nwere many cases, much less dramatic than that, much smaller than that, in which an asset\nowned by Mr., we\u2019ll say, Mr. Hans Schmidt, use that name I always use, in New York was\nheld in the name of Mr. John Jones, or whatever his name could have been, well, it was\ncloaking. And that was the case, of course also, in, in a number of situations in Latin\nAmerica, where companies were...perfectly non-German companies were accused of being\ncloaks for the German, real owners, of the property.",
        "Q:And Durham had written, you said, written extensively about this?",
        "A:No, Durham, Durham had never written, as far as I know, anything about it. He was a junior\nmember of the, William Rappard(ph), I'm not sure how much he had written about the\nsubject, I wrote a lot more than he did on there...and a fellow named Borchard(ph) here in\nthe United States, who was a professor of law at Yale, had written quite a bit about the\nsubject, the general subject of whether it was possible to take enemy private assets and use\nthem for reparations purposes, basically, that was the issue. But Rappard was the, the\neminent international lawyer on the, on the Swiss delegation, so that when we were talking\nabout heirless assets and the utilization of German assets in Switzerland, private German\nassets in Switzerland, for, for reparations purposes, for payment of the reparation claims of\nthe Allies, it would be Rappard who would talk about the general rules of international law\nwhich protected the enemy private assets, and I keep emphasizing private, in the neutral\ncountries, or indeed, in hostile countries. Because Borchard here and Paul, I think his first\nname was Paul, maybe not, but Professor Borchard at Yale wrote articles which are on file\nnow which said that, under the rules of international law, the assets of enemy private\nindividuals were, in effect, sacrosanct and could not be confiscated, even by their enemies.\nThat is, the United States would be allowed, under his theory, to take over the assets in the\nUnited States belonging to the German government or maybe to semi-governmental\ncorporations, if there were such. But if there was a private individual in Germany, who had a\nbank account in New York, that bank account could not be taken by the United States\ngovernment and used for reparation payments or war claim payments in the United States.\nBecause under international law, it was a private asset of an enemy national. That is one of\nthe big arguments which you can find...my articles on that subject and Professor\nBorchard's(ph) article on the subject and the article...sort of takes a position closer to\nBorchard(ph), but somewhat intermediate, written by a fellow named Otto(ph)\nSummerick(ph)...Otto Summerick was a lawyer in New York City of German background,\nbut those three articles are in a publication put out by the Duke University Law School\nentitled, \"Law and Contemporary Problems,\" and I think it's the issue, maybe the summer of\n1952, something like that.",
        "Q:What about the American delegation, aside from yourself. Can you talk about who else was\nthere?",
        "A:Well, the American delegation for the negotiation of the Swiss was headed by Randolph Paul.\nRandolph Paul was a very, very distinguished, had been a very distinguished tax lawyer, he\nhad been the general counsel of the Treasury Department during a good part of the war\nyears. And he was one of the people who participated in the formulation of the negotiations\nwith the Swiss and so forth. He headed the United States delegation. I was his deputy. I was\nin the State Department, and...I'm not sure whether it was then still called the Foreign Funds\nControl Division or whether it was called the, let's see, one moment while I think about that.\nI think it was the Division of Enemy Property Controls. Enemy Property Controls, I think,\nwas the name of the division. But, there was a transition in the State Department from\nForeign Funds Control to Enemy Property Controls and I moved from being in the Foreign\nFunds Control Division to being the chief of the Division of Enemy Property Controls and\nthen we expanded that division and took charge of, basically, of post-war negotiations on\nenemy property matters in both, on both sides of the ocean, Japan, Korea, and Germany,\nAustria. I became the Deputy Director of the Division...of the Office of Enemy Economic\nWarfare, Economic Controls. In any case, I was on the delegation as Mr. Paul's deputy. On\nthe delegation was a fellow named Orvis Schmidt who was, you would have to get his title\nfrom somebody else, but he was in the, basically, the Office of Foreign Funds Control of the\nTreasury Department. And I\u2019m not sure whether he was actually on the delegation or not,\nbut there was a fellow who took an active part of 1t named John Pailey(ph), who was Mr.\nSchmidt's boss in the Treasury Department. There were a couple of other people who were\nvery actively engaged in it. And I really can't remember how many people were actually on\nthe, on the delegation. I think my deputy, Walter Surrey(ph), was actually on the delegation.\nAnd in the Treasury Department, probably, a fellow named Joe Duboy(ph), Doobwah(ph),\nDooboise(ph), D-U-B-O-I-S, was, was on it. And a...very actively on the delegation was a\nfellow named James Mann(ph), who was later in the American legation in Berne as a\nTreasury Department representative in Berne, Switzerland, and he was very active in all this.\nHe and Orvis Schmidt were probably the ones who dealt the most with the issues of looted\ngold because that was an issue which seemed peculiarly to fall in the hands of the Treasury\nDepartment rather than the State Department. And that pretty much made up the American,\nAmerican delegation. Randolph Paul was the head of the delegation and very active.",
        "Q:Is it true, as far as you know, that you're the only person of that delegation that survives?",
        "A:I was the only person what?",
        "Q:You're the only person surviving?",
        "A:I am the, I am the only one of the negotiators in these negotiations who is surviving in the sense\nthat I was the head of the negotiation in all, all four of these negotiations and so far as the\nSwiss, so far as the Swiss, French, British and so forth, I'm the only one. Randolph Paul is\ndead, so I'm the...the other people on the American delegation and the Swiss thing, well, Jim\nMann is dead, Randolph, well Randolph is dead, Walter Surrey is dead. I can't think of\nanybody else on the delegation who has survived. There is one other person who is alive\nwho knows a good deal, deal about this and that is Morton Bock(ph), whose name I may\nhave mentioned before, who's living up here in Washington, not far away from where I am\nnow, who's still a good friend of mine. He's ten years older than I am, so, it gives me hope\nthat I'll be able to go on for a little while longer anyway. And he was around in, probably in\nthe Treasury Department, at the time of these negotiations. I have a difficulty remembering\nwhether Mort was actually in the Treasury Department. I guess he was in the Treasury\nDepartment, maybe during the negotiations. He may have actually gone over to the\nAmerican Legation in Berne at the time, but he probably would have come back for the\nnegotiations if he had been over there. But I, I, I know about Mort very well, but I can't\nremember really whether he sat in on these negotiations or not.",
        "Q:And something about the tone of the negotiations. You mentioned that Mr. Stucki was very stern\nand somewhat distant person, but did that set the tone for the negotiations?",
        "A:Yes, it did. The negotiations were not very, not very friendly except for the fact that I became\nvery friendly with a few of the people afterward, like Shtayburger(ph), who was a wonderful\nguy and who was not as stern as that. But Stucki was a rather stiff, you might call middle\nEuropean bureaucrat, diplomat. And he took very strongly the, the, the Swiss line that there\nwas no entitlement on the part of the Allies to any of these German assets in Switzerland, let\nalone the heirless assets. And, that was the line which he took very, very strongly. I might\ndeviate a little bit here to say that, that same line, basically, was taken by a very different\nperson whose name was Emil Sandstrom, who was head of the Swedish delegation.\nSandstrom had been a justice of the Supreme Court of Sweden, he was the head of the\nLeague of Red Cross Societies,'! he was a wonderful, wonderful, man. And he, as a lawyer\nand as a Swede, took the same line, that the Allies were not entitled to the German private\nassets in, in, in Sweden. But the Swedish attitude was, okay, fellas, we don't think you're\nentitled to these things, but we think we should be making some kind of contribution, not\n11 perhaps Mr, Rubin is referring to the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC). This\nwas the umbrella organization of all of the regional Red Cross offices. (See Jacques Picard,\nSwitzerland and the Assets of the Missing Victims of the Nazis. Bank Julius Baer: 1993.)\nonly to, to the Allied reparations finances, but also to the refugees. They had taken in a lot of\nrefugees, of course, during the war and, basically, what we'll do, a calculation. How much\nyou think you'll be entitled to and we'll make that available as a pro bono gift. So we give it\nto you as a gift, you take it as your due, whatever the theory, the money gets over there. And\nthen we don't have to argue about the law of the, the international law with respect to enemy\nprivate property, enemy private property. So that, that, that the negotiations with the Swedes\nwent swimmingly and very...on a very friendly basis. With the Swiss, they were stiff and\nStucki, having said you're not entitled to anything, for quite awhile, went back to\nSwitzerland for further consultation, then he came back here and pretty much reiterated the\nsame point. And then I suppose I made, well, somebody\u2019s described me as having made a\nmoral argument, which may or may not have had some kind of effect, that not only are we\nentitled to this legally, but there\u2019s a moral obligation on the part of Switzerland because\nSwitzerland, well, they allegedly armed themselves to resist any aggression if it should\ncome and did not bear any of the real costs of the war and all sorts of other people did. And\nwe arrived at the conclusion.",

        "Q:Do you remember the response, do you remember...",
        "A:Oh, the response was one of well, maybe, or something. It was not a very...1t was not yes, you've\nconvinced us and here you are with the money. But in the end, they went back and they did\ncome back with a proposal, as I say, which was not as satisfactory as I would have liked it to\nbe, but it was better than saying get out of our hair, we\u2019re not going to give you a nickel.",
        "Q:How important do you think was your argument in turning them around?",
        "A:My moral argument?",
        "Q:Honestly, I mean...",
        "A:Honestly, I think it had some effect. I think it had some effect. I think that it may have had some\neffect, more because they began to think a little bit about the public relations aspect than,\nthan any other aspect of it. It may be, and I do not condemn Mr. Stucki as being a Nazi, I\ndon\u2019t think he was, he was a very stern, stiff Swiss diplomat. But I have sort of a feeling,\nand he was you know, sympathetic in the sense of what had been going on, but I suspect that\nbasically, what he began to think about was the possibility that there not only was a\nplausible legal argument which they continued to deny, but I am convinced that my rhetoric\nwas sufficiently good, my logic sufficiently good and my demonstration sufficiently good so\nthat maybe I inculcated a few doubts even in the mind of people like Professor Borchard(ph)\nup at Yale. And I think maybe I did the same thing with Mr. Stucki and maybe with...and\ncertainly with Mr. Rappard(ph). But then I think also, the moral argument appealed to them\nin a sense because maybe there was... it had some effect as a moral argument and more\nbecause it had an effect as an argument they thought about as a possibility of public\nrelations. What's going to happen if the Allies really come forward with this and they say\nthat on, on a moral basis, the Swiss have been bastards. That, I think, probably had some\neffect. How much effect, I do not know. I ain\u2019t no psychologist.",
        "Q:Yeah, but they also had a tremendous interest in furthering their position as an international\ncenter of finance in the future, so they...that's what you...",
        "A:Oh yes, I'm sure, I'm sure that the fact that these arguments were being made on a moral basis,\netcetera, had a, had a considerable effect. They're thinking about their future relations. The\nBritish, on their side, were thinking about being a little more lenient, I think, than the\nAmericans were, partially because they wanted to re-establish financial relations with the\nSwiss, and I have no doubt that the Swiss wanted to re-establish financial relations with\neverybody. That, of course, was one of the reasons why they were so insistent and so they\nwere so anxious about getting rid of the proclaimed list, getting rid of the blacklist.",
        "Q:And was the, the elimination of the blacklist a direct point of negotiation? Was, was that\nsomething that you all as members of that delegation had control over?",
        "A:Oh, yes, yes. That was central to the negotiations, of course. The Swiss were saying, one of the\nthings we have to have is the elimination of the blacklist. And we were saying, you don\u2019t get\nthat until we get this agreement. And then we said, as soon as you get the agreement...I\nthink, I'm trying to think whether we said as soon as you get the agreement or as soon as the\nagreement is implemented, you get rid of the blacklist. To my shame, I really can\u2019t\nremember which one we said. I think probably we said something about implementation.",
        "Q:Because they had to go back and have, this...agreement had to be ratified by their parliament.",
        "A:It had to be ratified by their Parliament, that's right, that's nght. And I remember, and this is in the\ncomments which I made...the article I wrote about the Swedish agreement, I, I pointed out\nthat the Swedish agreement was implemented very, very...almost immediately, if not\nimmediately.",
        "Q:It was June when the parliament agreed, but I gather that their discussions were extremely\ncontentious in the Swiss Parliament.",
        "A:I'm sure that they were.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. The Washington Post reporter, David Ottoway(ph), mentioned in his piece this fall\nabout you, that, at the time of those agreements, there was very little attention paid to, to\nwhat was happening here. There were so many other things going in the news, that even the\nNew York Times barely mentioned the fact that the, that an agreement had been reached. In\nretrospect, was that a...was it helpful to the negotiation or did that harm the negotiation in\nany way?",
        "A:Well, I wouldn\u2019t say it harmed the negotiation. It certainly didn\u2019t help them. I mean, it would\nhave helpful, I think, had there been a little more publicity about what was going on. As, the\npoint I made a little while ago, which was that one of the reasons why I think the Swiss\ncame to the conclusion that they did at the very end, perhaps inadequate as that was, was\nthat, the fear of publicity. And publicity here would have, I think, pushed them a little bit\nfurther on. They had a very competent ambassador here in town, Mr. Bruggemann, and my\nrecollection is that we talked with him and he was very anxious to have this agreement\nconcluded. I'm, I'm not...I don't recall very much that, that, that he took any part in the\nnegotiations but I do have a very strong feeling that he was anxious to get this thing over\nwith and he probably back home was pushing Mr. Stucki quite a bit, back home in the\nembassy here, the liaison. He was married, incidentally, to a lady who had been an\nAmerican, who maybe still was an American, who was Henry Wallace's\u201d sister, who was\napparently, allegedly, the only non-native born Swiss who ever spoke Schweizerdeutsch(ph)\nperfectly.",
        "Q:Do you, do you recall President Truman ever expressing any opinion about the course of these\nnegotiations, directly?",
        "A:I do not recall that we ever got to see Mr. Truman, that I...I don't recall any particular expression\nfrom him. I was reasonably sure that we had his support in the White House. Back in those\ndays, you sort of stuck around where you were. You didn't go through back channels as\nmuch as they do at the present time and, and I didn't have any back channels at the White\nHouse anyway. Even Randolph, Randolph Paul, I, I, I doubt that he ever saw Mr. Truman\nabout this. But, you know, the thesis was, when we began the negotiations, we knew what\nwe wanted and we never had any lack of support. Now if we'd, if we'd perhaps said to the\nWhite House, why don't you go to see the, why don't you call in the ambassador\u2019? and tell\nthe ambassador in, here sitting in the Oval Office, that if they don't do something, we're\ngoing to be in, they're going to be in very bad shape. Maybe we should have done that, we\nnever thought about doing it, as far as I know.

        "Q:Okay. Here we are back, okay.",
        "A:I think what I would like to mention, briefly, I\u2019ve only read two things, really. One is the question\nof the contrast between the Swiss and the Swedish negotiations. In both cases, we were\nlooking for pretty much the same thing. We were looking for the German assets in the two\ncountries, to take for reparation purposes. We were looking for restitution of looted gold, if\nthere were any looted gold there, and we were looking for some kind of claims with respect\n'4 Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO): Based in New York, JRSO was organized\nby various Jewish philanthropic organizations to handle restitution issues.\nto the persecutees. In neither case, did we have any problem with respect to individual\nclaims of people who had come in and identified their property. There never was any, any\nissue about that. So far as the Swedes were concerned, they also made a contribution so far\nas the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees'!? was concerned. But so for the\ndifference between the two negotiations, was that the Swiss were very, very sticky so far as\nthe legal aspects were concerned. Maybe legitimately, I don\u2019t know. There still are people\nwho argue that enemy private property is, 1s sacrosanct and maybe not. And they also were\nvery difficult with respect to the one aspect, that I think is very important, the question of\nidentification of, of heirless assets in, in Switzerland. In that particular case, it seems to me,\nthey could very well at that particular point, have done basically what Paul Volcker is doing\nat the present time, with much less trouble than Mr. Volcker is having to go through:\nidentify, if not 100 percent of the heirless assets, at least 95 percent or 85 percent or\nsomething like that, and restituted those to an, a successor organization like the Jewish\nRestitution Successor Organization which was operating very successfully back in those\ndays, and right across the border in Germany. On the Jewish Restitution Successor\nOrganization, I think it's important to note, in connection with the, the possible, their\npossible role in, in Switzerland, their possible role as a successful organization in\nSwitzerland, that they did exactly that in the American Zone of Germany, very, very\nsuccessfully. The JRSO did obtain a tremendous amount of, of property in Germany which\nhad been looted from Jews and so forth, and that was, was properly restituted, etcetera. They\nalso were able to participate in the negotiations with the Germans on, perhaps, the larger\nissue of the, of restitution of jobs, of taking care of people who had been in concentration\ncamps and giving them some kind of compensation, inadequate, obviously, as monetary\ncompensation ever would be for that kind of thing. They still were able to get people some\n'S Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees (IGCR): \"A body formed in 1938 to manage a\nsolution to the problem of Jewish refugees. Switzerland was reluctant to involve itself with this\nbody.\" (Source: Jacques Picard, Switzerland and the Assets of the Missing Victims of the Nazis.)\nkind of compensation for the loss of career, the loss of jobs, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So\nthe JRSO could have been a very, very effective operating agency here. On the question of\nheirless assets, they could have, I think, helped a great deal, and I am not minimizing the\ndifficulty of identification of heirless assets, even in Switzerland. We had the same problem\nhere in the United States. We had property in the United States which was vested by the\nAlien Property Custodian, on the grounds that it had come from Germany. And there was no\nway of telling whether that property coming from Germany had been the property of a Jew,\nwho died in Bergen-Belsen or wherever, or had been the property of Mr. Goering,!\u00b0 except\nby taking a look at the names. If you didn't have the names, basically all you knew, was that\nthe account had been established by somebody in Germany and if the name was ambiguous\nand so forth, you didn't really know. We claim, we, the JSRO in the United States, claim\nthat there should be about three million dollars on our best estimate, and that was an\nestimate made on the very, very crude business of taking a look at names and lists and things\nlike that, in the assets which had been vested by the Alien Property Custodian and which\nwere being turned over to the War Claims Commission here in the United States to pay\nUnited States war claims. Negotiations in the United States resulted in our first coming\ndown to a figure of three million dollars as the amount of money which we thought would\nbe adequate for this particular vested, vested asset, amount of heirless assets. Then that had\nto be reduced, because the War Claims Commission and others would refuse to accept it, to\none million, and in the end, we had the Congress pass legislation which gave to the JRSO,\nonly half a million dollars. Which indicates the difficulty of having, of identifying heirless\nassets even in a situation where you have the entire forces of the government trying to work\nwith you. So, I think that perhaps the situation in, in Switzerland is, in a sense,\nunderstandable. I'm not sure how much there will be located in the way of heirless assets,\n'\u00a9 Reichs Air Minister and Economic Tzar: Responsible for huge amounts of looted art which he\nfunneled into Nazi Germany's national collections as well as his own collections. (See Klaus\nFischer, Nazi Germany, Continuum: New York 1995.)\nparticularly in view of all of these other factors. But the assets should have been restituted to\nthe, restored to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization back in those days. It should\nhave been made available in those days to the, either the Joint Distribution Committee or the\nJewish Agency, and should have gone for purposes of relief which would have been much\nmore relevant back then than, than they are at the present time. I say it would have been\nmore relevant back then than they are at the present time, because even though I'm\nconscious of the fact that there are a number of people who are still impoverished here 1n the\nUnited States, I can not really believe that...\nTape #2, Side B",
        "A:...people who are still impoverished here in the United States, I can not really believe that these\nassets would be, if they went into this, this kind of account, very, very significant in terms of\nthe total amounts that have been made available to the persecutees. The total amounts made\navailable to persecutees come, basically, out of all sorts of sources, but I, I think, primarily,\nout of the sources that came from Germany in connection with the Hague negotiations,\nwhich, at Vassanar(ph) in which I participated in 1952 and '53, where we negotiated on\nbehalf of both the government of Israel on the one side and the Conference on Jewish\nMaterial Claims Against Germany on the other side, as the two Jewish organizations,\nnegotiated, negotiated there. And then the government of Israel was represented on its own\nbehalf and then, of course, the Germans, represented by, very largely by a, a first class\ngentleman named Boehm(ph), I can't remember his first name, B-O-E-H-M, who was a\nwonderful, wonderful guy. And we did negotiate there, and there have been negotiations\nwhich have been going on ever since, and there has been a lot of money which has been\npaid into various accounts which, I think, has gone to recompense persecutees and their\nsurvivors, etcetera. I'm not saying, as I say, that the people who survived and the heirs and\nso forth, are not entitled. They're very much entitled to everything that they, they could\npossibly get. Certainly, they're entitled, if they can establish claims, to the property which\nwas left by one of their own ancestors. And certainly, also, they're entitled to whatever\namount may come into the pot which goes into a pot of heirless assets, basically. But that\namount that's going to go into the heirless asset pot is going to be minuscule compared to the\namounts which have already gone in and so forth. And that, I think, is probably true even\nwith respect to looted gold. There may be some looted gold which should be recovered,\nwhich has come out of the concentration camps, but you have to remember, a large amount\nof that looted gold was recovered in Germany itself. It was recovered at the, at the death\ncamps. I know that one of the officials of the International Refugee Organization!\u2019 came to\nSwitzerland with a couple of jerry cans filled with bracelets and gold teeth and so forth, and\nbrought them into the American legation in Switzerland, and by arrangement with them,\nthey were taken over to a, a cooperating Swiss bank and they were...those things were all\nsmelted down and the proceeds were paid to the International Refugee Organization for the\naccount of the, of the survivors and so, paid into the, into the interest of the...probably\nthrough the Jewish Agency and the JDC, but they went for the purposes about...but most of\nthat stuff was probably recovered in, in Germany itself. A large amount of it must have\ndisappeared, as I say, a large part of 1t was confiscated, a large part probably confiscated by\nguards at the camps, and a certain amount of it, certainly, went into the smelting pots and\nwas eventually stamped and came out again as the, with the Reichsbank stamp on it. So\nthere may be some additional amount available there. How much is a, is a matter which I\nthink will be very difficult to tell. One other thing about the Swiss, and the claim against\nSwitzerland, most of the money, I think, probably went...a lot of the money at any rate, went\nthrough Switzerland and did not remain, remain in Switzerland. I doubt that there's very\nmuch of the German gold still sitting there in a bank vault. Maybe there is some...Jew..some\nproperty still there, either gold bars or the things we also consider to be looted property,\npaintings, silverware, etcetera, not only in the, in the large Swiss banks, but maybe in some\n'7 International Refugee Organization: The major organization dedicated to the relief of refugees\nfrom the Nazi menace. Also called the IFO.\nof the Swiss private banks, or in the hands of individuals in Switzerland. It's very, very\ndifficult to, to tell about that. I, I think the amounts that we're talking about, that have been\ntalked about recently, are, are substantially exaggerated. And, about the only thing I would\nlike to add at the present time, is that I think the Swiss are, at the present time, maybe\nreluctantly and maybe under compulsion, making an effort to do something about it, despite\nthe charges which were made just the other day that all this is on the basis of, of blackmail.\nAnd beyond that, so far as the...my participation in, in, in Vassanar(ph) and the Hague is\nconcerned, about all I can say is that I was, as I said, a member of... was working with the\nAmerican Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Committee was very, very much\ninvolved in these negotiations which set up the negotiations at Vassanar(ph). I was one of\nthe four people on the, on the Jewish delegation representing the Conference on Jewish\nMaterial Claims Against Germany. I think Moe(ph) Levitt(ph) representing the JDC, I\nrepresenting, I don't know, a variety of organizations, I guess, certainly the American Jewish\nCommittee, a fellow named Alec(ph) Easterman(ph) representing the Conference of, the\nBoard of Jewish Deputies or something like that. And Maurice(ph) Bookstein(ph) who was\nrepresenting, I guess, the Jewish Agency at, at the time. And we were the four so-called\nprincipal negotiators. Sitting up on top of us were Jacob(ph) Blaustein(ph) who was then\nPresident of the American Jewish Committee, and that absolutely glorious character,\nNachem(ph) Goldman(ph) who then was, I guess, President of the Jewish Agency and the\nWorld Jewish Congress and so forth. And those were the two who did a lot of negotiating\nwith...on behalf of these claims. Nachem in particular was a very...very close to Konrad\nAdenauer and Jacob Blaustein was absolutely essential, I think, in going to General Clay\nand other people in the United States government, and they did a wonderful, wonderful job\nthere. I participated in those negotiations in the Hague... went on to be one of the few people\ntogether with Nehemiah(ph) Robinson(ph) who thought we would ever get anything out of\nthe Austrians. And Nehemiah Robinson was with the World Jewish Congress. He and I\nwere the only ones who thought negotiating with the Austrians was going to do anything at\nall because the Austrians had been declared to be an occupied country by the Allies by, way\nback in Moscow in 1943. And they were saying, who us? We're not guilty. And then we had\nsome negotiations with the Austrians and in 1955, I initialed an agreement in Vienna with\nthe entire Austrian cabinet on the other side of the table which resulted in the payment of\nabout 50 million dollars into a so-called Hilth(ph) Fund, which was administered by the\nJewish organizations, by the Committee for Jewish Claims On Austria. The big distinction\nbeing that we got a conference for Jewish claims against Germany, but a committee for\nJewish claims on Austria. It was supposed to reflect the difference. And that fund was, as far\nas I know, administered. It was inadequate, but it was something that the Austrians did pay\nin despite the fact that they were considered to be more liberated than, and an occupied\ncountry, than an ally of Germany. And that, I think, is about it.",

        "Q:Can you mention what some of those companies are, were?",

        "Q:I want to lay as much groundwork for the Swiss negotiations as possible. So we're now at '43, '44.\nYou have come to the State Department and you're sort of gradually becoming part of the\nSafe Haven Program, 1s this right?",
        "Q:Not gradually. It didn\u2019t happen gradually.",
        "Q:In, I think 1t was Bower's(ph) book, about the, The Paper Clip Conspiracy, he quoted you as\nsaying that you, one of the reasons you thought you moved up quickly in the State\nDepartment, because there some sort of renewed anti-Semitism backlash, because of senior\nState Department positions earlier. Can you sort of explain what that scene was like?",
        "Q:But the anti-Semitism, as you said, was not an issue for you. You didn\u2019t experience it directly in\nthe State Department.",
        "Q:Right. The United States took what's, I understand, has been described as a very tough roll against\nthe neutral countries. Can you describe the attitude, maybe even the position, of the State\nDepartment going into the Swiss negotiations in 1946. And I guess I need you to sort of lay\nthe groundwork with the Paris Agreements the year before.",

        "Q:Was that a significant number, do you have any idea how significant that number was?",
        "Q:We're talking about individuals now. We're going into the negotiations, what about other assets in\nSwiss banks, especially the question of gold.",
        "But, in any case, we would not have gotten down to the last penny, but they could have done\nsomething at that time. Now, I think that they are going back, and to a certain extent, I think\nMr. Volcker and his group, and maybe even the Swiss group which is doing some different\nkind of survey, will be able to locate some of these, the assets. So, what we were talking\nabout in the negotiations, also were these heirless assets and we were trying to insist, we did\ninsist, that the heirless assets be put in the hands of somebody. Question: Who 1s that\nsomebody? Well, if a German Jew came out and he identified the asset as being his own, he\ngot it back. That we settled from the very beginning. If he were not alive and neither was\nanybody else who survived him, the question is: What happens to those German Jewish\nassets which are, in a true sense, heirless? And there, all we could get out of the Swiss was a\nstatement of sympathetic consideration. They would give consideration, sympathetic\nconsideration, to the desirability of identifying those assets and making them available to\none of the relief organizations. The relief organization we had in mind at the moment, was\nthe Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees, which was succeeded by the IRO, the\nInternational Refugee Organization. And both of those used, as a operating agency, the Joint\nDistribution Committee and the Jewish Agency for Palestine, I guess it was at the time. So,\nthat was the situation with respect to heirless assets and the negotiations, as I say, came to a\nconclusion, not a very satisfactory conclusion on that basis, with the Swiss saying they\nwould give sympathetic consideration to doing something about this, but without any firm\ncommitment on their side. I think they regret now not having given us a firm commitment,\nand I regret 1t very much, and people who might have benefited from these assets would\nregret it, I suppose, most of all. So that was the situation with respect to the heirless assets.\nAnd we've been negotiating, fighting, doing something about them almost ever since. In my\nown case... and, I left the State Department in 1948, and I became... I went into the private\npractice of law, but one of my principal clients was a foreign relations aspect of the",

        "A:I was born on the West side of Chicago and my family gradually moved to the North side so that\nby the time I went to college, we were living in Wilmette, just North of the city of Chicago.\nI went to the University of Michigan, which 1s a nice state school, it had a regular reputation\nand was just a sufficient distance away from Chicago so I could get away from the family a\nlittle bit, but I could also get back -- by hitchhiking -- back, and get a meal when I needed\none. And then I went on from University of Michigan to the Harvard Law School where I\ngot my regular degree, Magna Cum Laude, and then I stayed on for an additional year and\ngot an L.L.M. at the suggestion of Felix Frankfurter(ph). I thereafter went down to the\nCircuit Court of Appeals in New York City and clerked for the person I consider to be one\nof the better judges, one of the best judges, really, in the United States, Augustus N. Hand,\nnot Learned Hand who was his cousin who was on the same court, but Gus Hand. I stayed\nwith him for a year and then came down to Washington. In Washington, the thesis was --\nmy thesis was -- that I was going to get a job, which I did get with the Securities and\nExchange Commission in the Reorganization Division. The reason for the Reorganization\nDivision being that it was the factor in the SEC which handled litigated cases, corporate\nreorganization cases, and I wanted to go back to Chicago and practice law with my two\nolder brothers in the field of corporate reorganization, which had been occupying a great\ndeal of their time. I never got back to Chicago because I left the SEC [phone rings] should I\nstop?",
        "A:Well, I never got back to Chicago because I moved from the SEC to one of the wartime agencies,\nthe office of Price Administration here which seemed a little more exciting at the time as we\nwere just beginning to get into the war. And then from the office of Price Administration,\nmore by chance than anything else, I moved over to the State Department in March of 1943.",
        "A:My family is Jewish. I was raised in the Reform aspect of the Jewish religion. I took Hebrew\nlessons which, unfortunately, I've completely forgotten about, and, I'm a reasonably non-\nconforming Jew.",
        "A:Well, I wasn\u2019t tremendously aware of what was going on. I was... I read the newspapers all the\ntime and so I knew approximately what was going on, as much as one can gain from the\nnewspapers. I still remember being in college when Mr. Hitler came to power in Germany,\nand I remember talking about that with a history professor who curiously, whose name I\ncuriously enough still remember, Mr. Slossun(ph), his name was. A very distinguished\nprofessor, a very interesting professor. He said, \"Hitler will last a few months, that\u2019s all.\"\nThat was in 1933, when I was still in college, and I was aware of what was going on quite\nclearly. When I went to the Harvard Law School which was in 1935, I saw a lot of people\nthere and, as a matter of fact, I've, a group of other people and I got together and organized -\n- with a fellow named Nathan Isaacs(ph), who is a professor at the business school -- he\ncame over to my little apartment that I was sharing with a couple of other characters, and\nsort of gave us lessons in the Talmud, supposedly every Saturday. It lasted about three\nSaturdays and that was about it. But, so far as what was going on in Germany was\nconcerned, yes I was aware of it but I wasn\u2019t deeply involved in anything particular. I do\nremember being at a Harvard Law Review dinner one time and talking with one of the\nprofessors who was resentful about the fact that longshoremen in New York had been trying\nto prevent the unloading of goods from Germany, and he thought this was an unwarranted\ninterference by a private organization in the affairs of the United States Government. I\ndisagreed rather strongly with him at the time but didn't take a tremendous amount of act, I\ndid not take an active role, really, in anything going on. I had a little bit to do, not very\nmuch, with refugee matters. Partially because one of the people who eventually became my\npartner, and who was a year or two after me in law school, was very much involved in that.\nAnd I probably contributed a little bit to some organizations but I didn\u2019t do very much more\nthan that.",
        "A:Yes, I can. As I said, I've spent a large amount of time in the Reorganization Division of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission when I first came down here to Washington. And\neventually in 1943, in early '43, a friend of mine, Bernard Melser(ph), who's still a Professor\nof Law, Emeritus, at the University of Chicago, called me. He was temporarily in the State\nDepartment. He was a very bright young man and he was about to go over to Europe, I think\nhe was in on the Nuremberg Trials, but he was in the State Department at the time. And he\ncalled me, and he said there was a very interesting thing going on there, and why didn't I\ncome over to the State Department and organize or work on something called the\nReorganization Program in the Foreign Funds Control Division of the Department of State.\nAnd I said, \"Bernie, that has absolutely nothing to do with corporate reorganization under\nChapter 10 of the Bank,\" -- well, Chapter 10 didn't exist, but 77B did -- \"under the\nBankruptcy Act at all. It's absolutely different.\" And he said, \"Well, you know that and I\nknow that, but nobody else knows that and you're the only person around who knows\nsomething about quote, 'reorganization.' Reorganization is reorganization is reorganization.\"\nSo, I thought it was a very interesting kind of thing, and went over to the State Department,\nand basically I was the fellow who was in charge of the program, which there was one, and\ntrying to run the Germans out of enterprises, primarily in Latin America. The reorganization\nprogram there was one which took into account the fact that a large number of business\nenterprises in Latin America, in particular, had been founded by German enterprises,\nFarben! and a variety of others. And the worry was that these enterprises would contribute\nto the Nazi war effort in at least two ways. One was by contributing of funds to a variety of\nvery evil causes; and the other was by contributing and financing espionage, or sabotage, or\n' IG Farben: A large German Chemical Cartel. Assets of this Cartel were cloaked by a Swiss\nholding company called \"Interhandel\" after the war. (Source: Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers:\nThe Mysterious World of Swiss Banking. New York: Viking, 1982.)\nworse. And the idea was, you had to allow the Latin Americans to continue to have the\nbenefits of these organizations, many of which were in the medical and drug,\npharmaceutical field. You couldn\u2019t just close down the organizations, so you had to continue\nto have the organizations do what they had been doing: producing drugs. But you wanted to\nget the German influence out of those, and that was the reorganization aspect: trying to\nintroduce, primarily at that time, American enterprise to come in and take over these\nenterprises. Certainly during the period of the war, and probably thereafter, because we\nalways had the theory that we didn\u2019t want the Germans to come back again in Latin\nAmerica, particularly in view of the fact that the National Socialist philosophy was one that\nwas anathema to most of us here.",
        "A:The Safe Haven Program developed out of the Reorganization thing, that's right. I was one of the\noriginators of this, so called, Safe Haven Program. But that had the same kind of objective at\nit that the Reorganization Program did. Reorganization was supposed to: a) take care of the\npresent threat \u2014 try to get the German control away from these enterprises in Latin American\nso they couldn\u2019t contribute money; and secondly, the idea was to prevent any recurrence of\nthe German influence in Latin America. That, basically, was the Safe Haven Program,\nprevention of recurrence of Nazism, and fascism, and so forth.",
        "A:Well, Safe Haven was basically, my recollection is, it was basically an American initiative but we\ncertainly had the British involved in it from the very beginning. And it may have been\ninternational in the broader sense of the word, because I\u2019m sure, as what resulted, as a fact\nof the later days, the French got involved very heavily. But basically, at the beginning, the\nBritish and the Americans were the only ones who were able to do anything and it was a\nBritish-American effort, basically aimed at trying to identify German influence which one\ncould equate with Nazi influence at the time, and to try to get rid of that, not only at the\npresent time, but for, to prevent any recurrence of it. That was basically the Safe Haven\nProgram. What we were trying to do is locate areas where the Germans had located money,\nwhere Germans were cloaking or having somebody else cloak for them etcetera, etcetera.",
        "A:Well, I was trying to devise policies with respect, particularly in the beginning, with the Latin\nAmericans to try to persuade the Latin Americans, for example, to control the German\nenterprises, German owned enterprises in their territory. But, my first trip was down to\nColumbia and my effort down there was to try to persuade the Columbian government to\neither supervise or actually vest the assets belonging to German controlled enterprises and\nthen to have those administered in accordance with this reorganization program by Allies,\nby Americans, probably, because the Americans were the only ones really able to do this\nkind of thing but we would have said the British or the Dutch or anybody else, if there were\npeople like that around as well. But there weren\u2019t very many around.",
        "A:Yes.",
        "A:Yes. Exactly. Because the idea was, you were, as I say, had two objectives. One was a wartime\nobjective, to prevent espionage and sabotage and financing of the German war effort and the\nsecond was a post-war effort which was akin with the idea, part of the idea that you didn't\nwant the German, Germans as they were then certainly, to come back in to any kind of\npolitical power in other areas of the world. We had some problems here in the United States,\nas you probably know, with... we also had a lot of problems with the possibility of Germans\ninfiltrating into the enterprises, particularly into the enterprises where they had been\nprominent in countries like Bolivia, Columbia, Argentina, etcetera, in Latin America. That\nwas the part of the world that I was very much involved with. The entire enterprise had\nsome people from, for example, one of my good friends, Kovi(ph) Oliver, who 1s still\naround, a very distinguished, now former, ambassador of the United States to Colombia\nmany years after this, was stationed in Madrid. A good many of the people who were\ninvolved in this when I got into it, were Americans who spoke good Spanish because Latin\nAmerica was one of the areas of our concentration. We would find a lot of the people\ninvolved in this were people who had been born in El Paso, as Kovi(ph) was, or in some\nplace in Texas who spoke Spanish as well as they did English, or nearly as well. Kovi\nprobably spoke it better.",
        "A:1943 was when I came into it. The effort had been going on for awhile before that. I came into\nthis Division of Foreign Funds Control, which was basically trying to look at the financial\ntransactions of people who might be supporting the Axis, and what we were trying to do\nwas to prevent any financial transactions which would have been of benefit to them. There\nwere a variety of aspects of that. One was to blacklist companies, either in the United States\nor elsewhere, primarily elsewhere, because we had direct control over the United States. But\nwe were trying to blacklist companies, mainly from the neutral countries who were doing\nbusiness with the Germans.",
        "A:They were, we were, we had a blacklist which was maintained in Switzerland, Sweden, Spain,\nPortugal, Argentina, Columbia, Turkey, a variety of other countries. Basically, wherever we\nthought, what we could do would be to prevent a financial transaction which would have\nbeen beneficial to the... to the Germans. We were active in trying to say-- to the enterprises,\nmainly, or to individuals, but mainly these would be enterprises, individuals acting as\nenterprises, as well-- we were trying to say to them, \"If you do this, you're not going to have\nany access, whatsoever, to any American facilities. And we will not only prevent you now\nfrom dealing with the United States, selling to the United States or getting exports from the\nUnited States, but we will continue this effort after the war in order to prevent you from\nrebuilding the thing.\"",
        "A:Well, the, Sterling Drug was one of the enterprises; IG Farben\u2019, of course, is the largest one.\nThere were a whole slew of corporations in Sweden which had been manufacturing ball\nbearings for other machine parts and things like that, who were all on the blacklist. My\nrecollection does not go to the individual names very much. We had a few Americans on the\nblacklist, some American nationals living in Vichy France... France were suspected of\ndealing with the Germans, and we blacklisted American nationals. That raised some issues\nhere but we did it nonetheless. But, one of the real reasons for the negotiations with the\nSwiss in 1946 was the fact that the blacklist still existed and there were a number of Swiss\ncorporations which were still on the blacklist and they were obviously desirous of getting\nthem off the blacklist. We were desirous of restoring normal relations, too. But the principal\nmotive for the negotiations on the Swiss side, was to eliminate the blacklist.",
        "A:Yes, except not gradually.",
        "A:No, it didn\u2019t happen gradually. I was there in the beginning and was very active in it. Largely\nbecause I came to the State Department in 1943 as a very healthy young man with very,\nvery bad eyes. And though I tried to get into the Navy, they threw me out, laughing all the\ntime. And then the Army called me down for the draft twice and they examined me from\nstem to stern and found I was a very, very healthy specimen until they got to my eyes. Then\nthey couldn\u2019t believe how bad they were and I got thrown out again. So I was one of the\n2 During the war, IG Farben had many holding companies, and/or branches all over the world,\neven in the United States. (See Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss\nBanking, pgs. 144-160.)\nvery few youngish males around here, at the time, who had had a fairly good education,\nHarvard and so forth, who was around at the time, who was not going into the Army. Most\nof the people my age were not married at the time (although I got married just at the same\ntime that I went into the State Department), but if we were married, we didn\u2019t have kids,\netcetera, so most of my colleagues went into the Army or the Air Force or whatever. And I\nhappened to be around, so I moved up in that absolutely new area for State Department\nwork very, very quickly. And basically, I was one of the originators of it, and so forth.",
        "A:I speculated with Mr. Bower(ph) a little bit about this, \u2019've never been quite sure about it, but I\ndid move up. If you take a look at my record in the State Department, I moved up from the\nentry level to high in the Civil Services, I could go very, very quickly. And there always was\na rumor around that the State Department was rather anti-Semitic. I always thought that\nthere were some people in the old Foreign Service who were, although I had many, many\nfriends in the Foreign Service who had no anti-Semitism whatsoever, and I developed these\nfriendships as time went along. But it seemed to me, at the very beginning, that perhaps one\nreason that I was promoted as quickly as I was, was because I was what you might call a\nrespectable Jew. I'd been to the Harvard Law School, I\u2019d been on the Harvard Law Review,\nI'd been a clerk for a very distinguished WASP?, a judge up in New York City, etcetera,\netcetera. I knew which fork to pick up at the dinner table, etcetera. And I was reasonably\nrespectable. And it seemed to me that there was some possibility that when people looked\naround they said, well, here\u2019s a fellow, we really want to do something about this anti-Nazi\nprogram, here\u2019s a guy who happens to know a lot about it and who is very competent and\n> WASP: White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.\nwho is respectable and, you know, he's the kind of person we would like to push forward. So\nI did get to be the Chief of the Division 1n a very, very short period of time and, after that the\nDeputy Director of the office, and after that the first Assistant Legal Advisor for Economic\nAffairs, etcetera, etcetera. Whether this had much to do with my being Jewish or not Jewish,\nI really don't know except that I had a... I always had a sort of a little bit of a feeling that\nwell, maybe, everybody thought well, this is a, quote, good Jew, unquote.",
        "A:No, I never experienced it directly in the State Department. The only experience I ever had with\nreally discussing it in any, even remote way, was in connection with Mr. Bower\u2019s book, The\nPaperclip Conspiracy, indicated that I was one of the people in the State Department who\nwas most in favor of pursuing what had been Mr. Roosevelt's policy of keeping well-known,\nvery active Nazis out of the United States, both then and probably forever. And there was a\nprogram which was near and dear to the hearts of the United States Army people which was\nto bring German scientists, particularly rocket scientists, to the United States to help us in\nour rocket program. The Germans obviously had been well-advanced in the rocket program,\nway ahead of almost anybody else. And it wasn\u2019t Warner Von Brown(ph) and people like\nthat, but they wanted to bring a lot more people in. That raised the question as to how many\nof these people you should bring into the United States, contrary to what had been the\npublicly stated policy, as I recall, of President Roosevelt, that, well, no Nazis, or active\nNazis, were not going to get into the United States. I was a little more, a lot more perhaps,\nageressive in the saying, we ought to have very, very strict standards of necessity and utility,\nbringing these people into the United States than the Army really wanted to adopt. As far as\nI could tell, back in those days, the Army officers, in Germany particularly, would go out\nand they would find somebody who'd swept the floor in the rocket establishment. They\nwanted to bring him to the United States on the grounds that he would contribute to the...\nour own effort to develop rocket technology. I had a little discussion about that, I wrote a\nmemorandum about it, as a matter of fact, one time, and I got into a dispute, which is in...\naccounted in Mr. Bower's book, with a very good friend of mine named Clare Wilcox(ph),\nfor whom I worked, as a matter of fact, a little bit later, in trade matters. He was a very\ndistinguished economist from Swarthmore and I'm sure he had not the slightest bit of anti-\nSemitism in him, not the slightest. But he thought that I was being a little too sensitive about\nthe possibility that if you brought some of these Nazis into the United States they would\ncontribute to what was then, to a certain extent, the latent anti-Semitism of certain people in\nthe United States. I'd lived in New York when I was clerk for Gus Hand, and back in those\ndays, there was a guy named Fritz Coon(ph) who was around, who was a well-known\nAmerican Nazi. In any case, Wilcox and I got into a dispute which was reflected in a couple\nof memos back and forth in which Clare(ph) basically said he was just as anti-Nazi as I was\nbut he didn\u2019t think that this was the... it was appropriate, we were trying to keep too many\npeople out of the United States who would be useful, etcetera. And I had a little discussion\nby memorandum with him. The fact that it never really became personal was evidenced by\nthe fact that sometime a little bit later, Clare Wilcox(ph) was the Deputy Chairman of our\ndelegation to the International Trade Organization in 1947-48, and I was the legal advisor to\nthat delegation. I was one of Clare's(ph) principal assistants if you can call it that, at that\ntime. And he and I became very, very good friends. So I don't think that, well, that\ndiscussion took place largely, I think, because I had said that there were too many of these\nNazis, or people who were likely to be Nazis, who were getting into the United States under\ncolor of necessity and I really wanted to have a very strict standard applied. I still remember,\nwe sent somebody around to Vanovar Bush(ph) maybe we sent Vanovar Bush(ph) around to\nMr. Conant(ph). I've forgotten which way it went. One of them was in the government...\nTape #1, Side B",
        "A:One of them was in the government and one of them was not, as I recall. To explore the question\nof how many of these scientists really would contribute to our rocket technology if they\nwere brought into the United States. And I do recall that, as we got back, was, well, you\ncould bring a few of these people in, not too terribly many of them, and you could get\neverything you needed out of them in a period of about six months. I'm not sure that that's\nentirely the case, because I suppose if somebody had developed something that really has\nbeen very good at one point, you can probably expect to get more things out of him as he\nwent along, in the future. But, my recollection is that that was the reason for Mr. Bower's\nbook, The Paperclip Conspiracy, basically.",
        "A:Well, I'll go back even before the Paris Agreement. The Pottsdam(ph) Agreement, signed,\nbasically, the assets in the neutral countries of German nationals, to the Western Allies with\nrespect to reparation purposes. So that the theory was that we would take, the... we'd get\nreparations from the Germans, and not only from Germany itself, the occupied areas, but\nalso from the areas where Germans had interests in the neutral countries. And the Paris\nAgreement decided on how those assets, how all of the reparations to be taken from\nGermany, would be divided up among all of the Western Allies. Because the only people\npresent, the only countries present at the Pottsdam Agreement, were the United States, Great\nBritain, and the Soviet Union. So, Paris had to do something about allocating the proceeds,\nallocating the amounts that would be given to the various Allied countries, whether they\nhappened to be Belgium, Holland, or the United States, and so forth. The Paris Agreement\nalso worked out a formula -- because even then we were concerned about refugees and the\npeople who were left homeless, the persecutees and so forth -- had worked out an agreement\nthat a portion of what was recovered would be allocated to what was then the\nIntergovernmental Committee for Refugees, and through the Intergovernmental Committee\nfor Refugees primarily it was decided -- I'm not sure if this was in Paris or a little bit later --\nto the Jewish Agency* and the Joint Distribution Committee.\u00b0 [phone ringing] The machine\nwill pick that up, I hope. In any case, the Paris Agreement was one in which we were\nallocating the proceeds of the reparations which were scheduled to come from Germany.\nNow, part of those proceeds, obviously, were the assets of German, of the German entities,\nand German individuals located in the neutral countries. And that laid the background for\nthe negotiations with the Swiss and then later with the Swedes and the Spanish and the\nPortuguese and, even to a certain limited extent, with the Turks. Because we knew there\nwere a lot of German assets located in Switzerland; Switzerland had been right there at the\ncenter of Europe, it was a financial center and so forth. And there was no question but that\nthere were a lot of German assets in Switzerland. So we began these negotiations on the\nthesis that what we were after, in accordance with the Paris Reparation Agreements, the\nUnited States, Great Britain and France, as agents of all the other Allies, were to secure\nthese assets which were located in the neutral countries and put them into the reparations\npot, which would be administered eventually by the Interallied Reparations Agency, which\nhad been established and which was functioning in Brussels. So, we began the negotiations\nwith the Swiss, basically, on that thesis: That what we were doing was to look for the\nGerman assets in Switzerland and put them in the reparations pot. On the Swiss side, the\nnegotiations, as I said a moment ago, were useful, if you want to put it that way, because\nwhat they were aiming for was to get rid of the freezing and the blocking which was the\nresult of the proclaimed list of certain blocked nationals, the formal name for the blacklist.\nSo that we had some incentive on both sides to go ahead and negotiate. On the Allied side,\nwhen we started the negotiations, before we actually got into the negotiations, we began to\n* Jewish Agency for Palestine was established in 1922 and recognized in Article 4 of the Palestine\nMandate as a public body to advise and cooperate with the British administration of Palestine in\neconomic, social and other matters that affected the establishment of the Jewish National Home.\n> American Joint Jewish Distribution Committee (JDC) was founded as a philanthropic agency in\n1914 to aid Jews in need all over the world. It played an active role in rescuing Jewish refugees\nfrom Nazi Germany.\nthink about this, and if we were thinking about taking over the German assets in\nSwitzerland, we began to worry about what are, quote, the \"German assets in Switzerland.\"\nAnd at that point, maybe before, it was certainly on all of our minds, but articulating it, we\nbegan to say the formula, \"The enemies...or our enemies... are our friends.\" And we were\nnot going to take over the assets, even though they had originated from somebody 1n Berlin,\nif they belonged to a persecutee. That is, the assets of Mr. Hans Schmidt, a good German\nNazi, which were located in Switzerland, were different from the assets of Mr. Chaim\nCohen, who had died in Bergen-Belsen or in Auschwitz or in someplace like that. Equally a\ncitizen, formerly a citizen of Berlin who had deposited assets in Switzerland. So, when we\nbegan the negotiations, we had basically these, the overall objective of securing the German\nassets in Switzerland, and the subsidiary, but not very subsidiary, deviation from that\nobjective, of exempting and making sure that the persecutees got whatever they possibly\ncould get out of that.",
        "A:Well, in the first place, we didn't determine what the figures were. The first thing we did, was to\nsay in effect, \"If there's a German asset, so-called German assets in Switzerland, and you\nidentify it, and Mr. Cohen who used to be living in Berlin, comes over there and says, \"Hey,\nI was a persecutee, I survived Bergen-Belsen, here I am, I want my property back,\u2019 you, the\nSwiss, nobody else, takes that asset and puts it into the reparation pot.\" -- Just as we, in the\nUnited States, were returning the assets of persecutees who could turn up here and identify\nthe assets. Even though they were, quote, in quotes, \"German assets.\" We demanded that the\nSwiss do exactly the same. And as far as I know, there was never any objection to that on\nthe part of the Swiss. And as far as I know, every German Jew who turned up in Switzerland\nand could identify his assets, got those assets back.",
        "A:I have no idea how many assets there were, but I assume there were a number of people,\nparticularly perhaps, more from Germany than from the other occupied areas. Because the\nGermans, in effect, had more notice. I mean, Hitler was there in 1932, '33, and it was a long\ntime before the controls really fell into place, before the Final Solution was begun to be\nworked on and so forth. And the German Jews were likely to be more prosperous than the\nHungarian or the Rumanian Jews, although there were a lot of prosperous Rumanian and\nHungarian Jews, maybe even Bulgarians, and Polish. So, the German Jews had some notice\nand, despite the fact that there were controls which were enacted by the Germans, I'm sure\nthere was a considerable period of time when those controls could be successfully evaded.\nSo, I suspect, a large number of German Jews actually did get their money out of\nSwitzerland [sic]. One way or another. Maybe before the war actually broke out, maybe\neven during the war. The amounts, I have not the slightest idea. Really. I don't think we ever\ntried to make any evaluation of how many German Jewish assets there were in Switzerland,\nsay, in 1932, at the beginning of the war before things really began to get terrible. And so,\nwe had no way of knowing how much would have been recovered by German Jews who\ncame out. Whether the Swiss would have figures on somebody who turned up at the bank,\nand was able to identify the bank number, and was able to say, \"I am the survivor,\" or, \"I am\nactually the guy who put the money there and I want to get it back now.\" And how many of\nthose people actually turned up and got their money out, that I just do not know. I don't\nknow whether anybody knows it. Maybe some people do, maybe if you went back and did\nthis kind of study that Mr. Volcker is doing, maybe you could go back through all those old\nrecords and you could find that people did actually turn up and did recover their assets. I'm\nsure that a large number of them did. That is not to say that a large number of them did not.\nBut a large number of them did. As I say, I suspect in the case of the German Jews, it would\nhave been more likely that they got the money out than the case of the Hungarians and the\nothers who thought that, \"Well, it's not going to come here,\" the Czechs or whatever, who\nthought, \"We are going to be protected.\" I know there was a lot of people in, say, Austria,\nwho had money in Switzerland, and who came out and then went back into Austria, because\nthey thought that nothing was going to happen to them. But, in most of those cases, they had\ntheir families out before they went back. We know a number of people would back and then,\nof course, they got caught.",
        "A:Well, the question of gold, there are two different questions there. If I can go back, the other\nassets you wanted to talk about, let me talk about the other assets. There were a lot of assets\ndeposited in Switzerland by German, Hungarian, etcetera, Jews, everybody was putting their\nmoney in, whether it was Jewish or not. But the Jews had a particular reason and a lot of\nthose assets were never claimed. Because the people died in concentration camps, not only\nthey died, but all of their heirs and so forth died. Now, on those assets, those I take it are\nwhat we are talking about here, so far as these negotiations are concerned. There probably\nare still a substantial number of those around. Because the Swiss never did what I and a\nvariety of other people urged them to do at the end of the war, do the kind of census that Mr.\nVolcker and his group are doing at the present time. It's very difficult, I think, to get any\nclear figures down to the last penny or Swiss franc or whatever, as to how many of these\nassets there were, and maybe you could never really identify all of them. But, because we\ndiscovered here in the United States when we tried to do a similar thing, it was very, very\ndifficult to identify heirless assets. Just by names and things like that. But, to a certain\nextent, a lot of those assets did exist in Germany, and they could have had a census. Perhaps\nnot as elaborate as the one which is being conducted now because it would have been\ntimelier then. Now, Mr. Volcker has to go back over all these years and check back records.\nAnd banks have disappeared, and accounts have been transferred, etcetera, etcetera. Then,\nthat was not the case; they could have done a census and, while I don't think they would\nhave been able to identify every heirless asset, particularly since names are ambiguous, as\nwe discovered here in the United States. The name Burger might be Warren Burger(ph) of\nthe Supreme Court, it might be my friend, Raul(ph) Burger, who is Jewish. And this Warren\nBurger is not Jewish. Burger is a good German name, it Just means an inhabitant of the city.\nAmerican Jewish Committee,\u00b0 and I worked on their behalf a very, very... a lot of hours,\nanyway. And did a lot of things in connection with Jewish claims. And one of the things I\ndid was to continue to pursue this business of the heirless assets in Switzerland, so that\nsometime, I think, in 1951, I was in, actually went to Switzerland and had a meeting with\nthe American Legation as it still was then, the Embassy, and we went over to the Swiss\nForeign Office or the Ministry of Justice, I've forgotten which, to talk about this issue. And\nhad a rather frustrating meeting over then, over in that office. I think that was 1951. I would\nhave to take a look at the record to make sure. So much for heirless assets at that time.",
        "A:Forty years later.",
        "A:Oh, 20/20 hindsight, oh.",
        "A:Sure. I remember very, very well. I was not very happy with the conclusion of the negotiations,\nparticularly on this question of heirless assets. We thought we had achieved pretty much\nwhat we were able to achieve and what we could achieve in connection with the general\nreclaiming of German assets for the reparations pot. Even there, there were problems,\nbecause, basically what we did, in the end, was to say to the Swiss, \"Okay, you're, you will\nidentify all the German assets. Now, I'm talking about German assets, excluding the Jewish\n\u00b0\"The American Jewish Committee was founded in 1906 as a Jewish defense organization in\nreaction to anti-Jewish pogroms in Tzarist Russia. During Nazi era: Urged the United States to\nintervene on behalf of the persecuted Jews of Europe. Post-war: Concerned with restitution,\nresettlement, reparations, indemnification, and immigration to the United States.\" (Source: Archives\nof the Holocaust, v. 17, Introduction by Frederick Bogin.)\nones, but, you will identify all the German assets in Switzerland and you will liquidate,\nunder the supervision of something called the Swiss Compensation Office, all of those\nassets. And then, what you will do with the proceeds, you will turn 50 percent of those over\nto the Allies to put into the pot of the Interallied Reparation Agency, and the other 50\npercent you will retain for your own claims against Germany.\" -- Because the Swiss were\narguing that they had a lot of claims against Germany themselves and so forth. And all of\nthese German assets in Switzerland should not go to somebody else, they should go to the\nSwiss claimants who had perfectly legitimate claims against Switzerland [sic]. Now, the\nquestion of whether it was a 50/50 split, whether that was fair or not, I never thought that\nthat should have been quite that way. I always thought we should have had 60 percent, or 70\npercent, or... if not 100 percent, but that was not really satisfactory, but it seemed to me, and\nI think it seemed to everybody else there, the best we could do with the Swiss. The only\nweapon we had at the time was the continued existence of the blacklist. And that was a very\nfragile weapon at the time. People don't remember that, but nobody really wanted to\ncontinue the blacklist in the period 1946, '47 on, we were normalizing all of our relations.\nAnd, in point of fact, even in Germany, the attitude -- for Germany, I should say -- the\nattitude was changing a great deal. You had, at one point in '43, '44, '45, the Morgenthau\u2019\nPlan on the one side, which would say, well, let's reduce Germany to an agrarian state. And\nthen you had, after we came in and we were occupying Germany, the views of people like\nGeneral Clay and others, who said, well, the only way in which this economy can survive\nand which can prevent starvation, is if they go back to being an industrial nation, which they\nwere before. And, in the end, of course, the United States put a tremendous amount of\nmoney into Germany instead of taking it out. So, there was a certain attitude on their part,\nthat we couldn't keep the proclaimed list in existence very much longer. And I still\n\u2019 Henry Morgenthau, Secretary of the Treasury.\nremember, we went up on the Hill,* I can't remember exactly which Senator we saw, but one\nof the relevant Senators at the time, and told him about the deal we were working on at the\ntime, and he said, well, that's probably the best you can do, why don't you accept the deal,\nand let it go at that. So, on that side, we were reasonably satisfied, but not entirely satisfied.\nOn the side of the heirless assets, I never was very satisfied with it. But, I couldn't see what\nelse we were going to be able to do because the pressure on us to bring these negotiations to\nan end was very strong. The United States, I think, was stronger on this than anybody else,\nincluding the British. The British were on our side, but they always had problems about re-\nestablishing their relations with Switzerland, with the Swiss banking system, and the\nFrench...",
        "A:The British wanted to re-establish normal relations with the Swiss. The Swiss had been a neutral\ncountry. The British lawyers had, perhaps, the same attitude that a lot of American\ninternational lawyers had, except that that seemed to me to be a little stronger in the Foreign\nOffice there than it was in the State Department here, maybe because I and a couple of other\npeople like myself were in the State Department, but, basically, the attitude was that the\nneutrals had a perfectly good nght to deal with whoever they were going to deal with. That,\nbasically, is the essence of neutrality. And to a certain extent, that is a policy which had been\nestablished by the United States way back in the 1800's when we enacted the Neutrality Act.\nWe were able to deal with the French when the British thought we shouldn't be dealing with\nthe French in the French-British wars. But, in any case, we were very strong on this subject\nof not dealing with the Germans and, basically, we had no particular strength in retaining the\nproclaimed list. So we came to the conclusion that we might as well, the best thing we could\ndo would be to conclude the agreements on the basis we did, which gave us the money we\n* Capitol Hill.\nwanted, pretty much, so far as German assets, strictly German assets were concerned.\nWhich gave us a statement that they would look sympathetically at the whole business of\nheirless assets. And we thought we could probably work out something on that and we\nwould be able to get them to do a census so that we would be able to find out what the\nheirless assets were, and so that we could take those assets and turn them over to the\nIntergovernmental Committee for Refugees. And that's where we were when we came to a\nconclusion. Satisfactory? No, this interview which was done with me in the Post, I thought it\nwas a pretty good and fair story, a lot of my friends have told me that I shouldn't be too\nunhappy because I expressed a view that maybe we could have done better. Well, I've never\nbeen in a negotiation, almost never been in a negotiation, where I thought I had done the\nabsolute best that I possibly could at the beginning of negotiation. And I am not now, and\nwas not then, unhappy with what we came out with. I thought it was a reasonably\nsatisfactory conclusion. But, not completely satisfactory.",
        "A:Okay, looted gold, I'll get back to that. There, you have to make a distinction with respect to the\nquestion of looted gold. The main body of looted gold that we were talking about back in\nthose days when we started negotiating with the Swiss and with the others, the Portuguese\nas well, was the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of the Central Bank depositories.\nYou have to know that the large amount of gold that was on deposit in Belgium, in Brussels,\nwas moved to Switzerland, and maybe down to Dakar(ph) and re-smelted and so forth. But\nthat was Belgian government Central Bank gold. And what we were then making sure of,\ntrying to make sure of basically, was that the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of\nevery Central Bank depository, which was basically where gold was kept, was restituted at\nthe end and that's the gold which we have, basically, gotten back. To the extent of about 60\nor 70 or maybe even 80 percent of it. That is the gold which, basically, has been distributed\nby the International Gold Commission, a tripartite commission on gold, which is more or\nless affiliated with the institutions in Brussels, and which as been restored, a part of which\nhas been restored even fairly recently, to the Albanians, who lost gold from their central\ndepositories and so forth. That is one aspect. That's the major part of the, quote, the \"looted\ngold\" that went to Germany and which was used by the Germans for their own purposes.\nThe second part of the looted gold, was the gold which was taken out of the teeth of\nconcentration camp victims, the gold bracelets that came off the wrists of women, etcetera,\netcetera. And in that particular category of quote, \"looted gold,\" unquote, we generally\nincluded looted gold and other assets because, in that same general category, we're talking\nabout paintings, valuable silverware, etcetera, etcetera. All the valuables, the personal\nvaluables that people would have. Now, a certain amount of that, going back strictly to the\ngold, was looted by the gold... looted by the Germans, and melted down by them, and used\nby them for their own wartime purposes. I hesitate a little bit when I say \"wartime\npurposes,\" because I am reasonably convinced without having any particular proof of it, that\na substantial amount of that went into the pockets of the individuals, the individual Germans\nwho were there in the concentration camps, the guards, etcetera, etcetera, the people who\nhad control of it, and so forth. The Germans were pretty good at keeping track of things like\nthis because they didn't want the guards to be profiting instead of the authorities back in\nBerlin, but I'm sure that, since in almost every other case there's been some individual\nlooting, there probably would have been a considerable amount of individual looting in this\nparticular case. So, some of that, though, may have disappeared into the pockets of the\nguards, etcetera. But a large amount of that gold went back to smelting establishments in\nGermany and was smelted down. And then, probably, having been smelted, had the\nReichsbank stamps put on it. And, all in all, probability, the Reichsbank stamps dated back\nfive or ten years or something like that so that it looked just like gold that had been in the\nReichsbank Central Bank depositories for years. Now, the Swiss knew at the beginning of\nthe war, approximately how much gold reserves the German central bank did have. And\nthey know that during the course of the war, more gold went through Switzerland than was\nin those depositories at the beginning. So, everybody there, I think, has been conscious of\nthe fact that a large part of that gold had to be looted in one sense or the other. In the sense\nof having come from the central bank depositories of the, what should have been Belgian\ngold, or Albanian gold, or French gold or something like that, Central Bank gold, and on the\nother side, gold that came out of the concentration camps or out of just stealing the stuff\nfrom the Jews who had not been put into a concentration camp, but whose homes were\nlooted. So, that gold has been a substantial part of the discussion. The question of what\nactually happened with respect to the gold that passed through Switzerland, or came into\nSwitzerland, is, I think, one that maybe Mr. Volcker\u2019 and others will be able to find out\nmore clearly about. A large part of that gold, I think, was just transferred back, transferred\nby the Germans, converted into Swiss francs, and the Swiss francs were used by the\nGermans to purchase whatever it was they wanted to purchase, war materials in the first\nplace, or something else. Some of that gold probably remained in Switzerland. How much\nremained in Switzerland, I do not know. I don't, I doubt that very much of it did remain in\nSwitzerland, because I think it had all been used, to the extent that it possibly could be used.\nWe did work out an agreement with the Swiss in which they would make a payment on\naccount of looted gold to the International, the Tripartite Gold Commission. And a payment\nof that sort was made. Beyond that, I don't know. How much of this gold can be identified as\nhaving come from the people who were in the concentration camps and how much their\nclaims, therefore, should be, I do not know. I notice in the newspapers, there was some\ncomplaint about the fact that the amount of money that's still in the Federal Reserve in New\nYork, under the control of the Tripartite Gold Commission, some payments were being\nmade to governments, like the Albanian government, rather than to individuals. Since the\ngovernments got back less than, a lot less than 100% of what was looted from them, I'm not\nsure that that's a legitimate complaint. I think the governments are entitled to get their gold\nback. How much of the gold that came out of teeth, etcetera, etcetera, actually went into\n? Paul Volcker.\nSwitzerland, one does not really know. It may be, as people now tell me, nobody told me at\nthe time, that one could identify the gold that came out of bracelets and teeth and so forth, as\nhaving had that kind of origin. Because that gold has in it, elements which are not found in\nthe gold which comes out of a mine, which is then smelted and cast into a monetary bar.\nBut, on this, I really have very little knowledge.",

        "A:Yes.",
        "A:Sure. Well, the, the, the Swiss negotiations were, as I said, the first negotiations we went on.\nLater was the Swedish negotiations here in, in, in Washington, there was a substantial\ncontrast, in the tone, really, of the two. But to talk about the Swiss, the Swiss delegation was\nheaded by Walter Stucki, who was a very eminent Swiss ambassador. I\u2019ve forgotten what\nother posts he held but he was a pretty high dignitary\u2019\u00ae so far as the Swiss government was\n'\u00a9 Walter Stucki was a senior official at the Swiss Political Department. (See Nicholas Faith,\nSafety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss Banking, pg. 140.)\nconcerned. I think he had been the Swiss ambassador to Vichy France, as a matter of fact.\nAnd he headed the delegation. He was a tall, stern, balding fellow and rather severe in\nappearance, I would say, and a little remote 1n tone, in tone and so forth. The second man on\nthe Swiss delegation, as far as I can recall, was a fellow named Rappard, who was a very\npleasant, genial, very distinguished Swiss international lawyer whose name is\ncommemorated in the Rappard Institute in Geneva at the present time which is one of the\nworld\u2019s leading institutions in the field of the study of international law. And he was one of\nthe people with whom I dealt most extensively because I have a legal background and he\nwas a lawyer and so forth. Other members to the delegation I don\u2019t remember too well.\nThere apparently was a fellow named Heerch(ph) or Hersh(ph) or something like that,\nwhom I must say I can\u2019t recall at all. There was another member, the junior member of the\ndelegation, named Geeterom(ph). Gee, his last name was Durham, D-U-R-H-A-M, who I\nthink is no longer in existence but may be, and my recollection is that there was another\nfellow who was also around in the background, sort of, named Paul Jolles, J-O-L-L-E-S,\nwho I think 1n later years was a rather distinguished Swiss government official in the field of\ninternational trade, which is the field that I followed in years later, myself. The member of\nthe Swiss delegation, I think, was a fellow named Ernst Shtayburger(ph), who was here in\nthe Swiss legation at the time and who became a very good friend of mine in years\nthereafter. Wrote some pieces when he was in private life in, in Switzerland about the fact\nthat there had been a lot of cloaking in, in Switzerland. And...",
        "A:Cloaking in the sense of Swiss using their names to disguise the fact that a particular asset was\nreally a German asset. For example, the biggest case, which was one, one that causes a lot of\ndifficulty and which you find a lot about in the records of the Justice Department here and\nso forth, was the IG Chemie case. IG Chemie was a Swiss corporation. It was accused by us\nand by others of being a cloak for I.G. Farben. And the holdings in the United States of IG\nChemie included General Dyestuff(ph) Corporation which was a very large aspect that\nclosely connected with General Aniline and Film, which again, was a very large company\nwhich rivaled Kodak at one time. But General Aniline Film and General Dyestuff were\nAmerican corporations, presumably owned by IG Chemie. Our, our, our argument was that\nIG Chemie was really a cloak for IG Farben. And that's what I mean by cloaking. There\nwere many cases, much less dramatic than that, much smaller than that, in which an asset\nowned by Mr., we\u2019ll say, Mr. Hans Schmidt, use that name I always use, in New York was\nheld in the name of Mr. John Jones, or whatever his name could have been, well, it was\ncloaking. And that was the case, of course also, in, in a number of situations in Latin\nAmerica, where companies were...perfectly non-German companies were accused of being\ncloaks for the German, real owners, of the property.",
        "A:No, Durham, Durham had never written, as far as I know, anything about it. He was a junior\nmember of the, William Rappard(ph), I'm not sure how much he had written about the\nsubject, I wrote a lot more than he did on there...and a fellow named Borchard(ph) here in\nthe United States, who was a professor of law at Yale, had written quite a bit about the\nsubject, the general subject of whether it was possible to take enemy private assets and use\nthem for reparations purposes, basically, that was the issue. But Rappard was the, the\neminent international lawyer on the, on the Swiss delegation, so that when we were talking\nabout heirless assets and the utilization of German assets in Switzerland, private German\nassets in Switzerland, for, for reparations purposes, for payment of the reparation claims of\nthe Allies, it would be Rappard who would talk about the general rules of international law\nwhich protected the enemy private assets, and I keep emphasizing private, in the neutral\ncountries, or indeed, in hostile countries. Because Borchard here and Paul, I think his first\nname was Paul, maybe not, but Professor Borchard at Yale wrote articles which are on file\nnow which said that, under the rules of international law, the assets of enemy private\nindividuals were, in effect, sacrosanct and could not be confiscated, even by their enemies.\nThat is, the United States would be allowed, under his theory, to take over the assets in the\nUnited States belonging to the German government or maybe to semi-governmental\ncorporations, if there were such. But if there was a private individual in Germany, who had a\nbank account in New York, that bank account could not be taken by the United States\ngovernment and used for reparation payments or war claim payments in the United States.\nBecause under international law, it was a private asset of an enemy national. That is one of\nthe big arguments which you can find...my articles on that subject and Professor\nBorchard's(ph) article on the subject and the article...sort of takes a position closer to\nBorchard(ph), but somewhat intermediate, written by a fellow named Otto(ph)\nSummerick(ph)...Otto Summerick was a lawyer in New York City of German background,\nbut those three articles are in a publication put out by the Duke University Law School\nentitled, \"Law and Contemporary Problems,\" and I think it's the issue, maybe the summer of\n1952, something like that.",
        "A:Well, the American delegation for the negotiation of the Swiss was headed by Randolph Paul.\nRandolph Paul was a very, very distinguished, had been a very distinguished tax lawyer, he\nhad been the general counsel of the Treasury Department during a good part of the war\nyears.

I was\nin the State Department, and...I'm not sure whether it was then still called the Foreign Funds\nControl Division or whether it was called the, let's see, one moment while I think about that.\nI think it was the Division of Enemy Property Controls. Enemy Property Controls, I think,\nwas the name of the division. But, there was a transition in the State Department from\nForeign Funds Control to Enemy Property Controls and I moved from being in the Foreign\nFunds Control Division to being the chief of the Division of Enemy Property Controls and\nthen we expanded that division and took charge of, basically, of post-war negotiations on\nenemy property matters in both, on both sides of the ocean, Japan, Korea, and Germany,\nAustria. I became the Deputy Director of the Division...of the Office of Enemy Economic\nWarfare, Economic Controls. In any case, I was on the delegation as Mr. Paul's deputy. On\nthe delegation was a fellow named Orvis Schmidt who was, you would have to get his title\nfrom somebody else, but he was in the, basically, the Office of Foreign Funds Control of the\nTreasury Department. And I\u2019m not sure whether he was actually on the delegation or not,\nbut there was a fellow who took an active part of 1t named John Pailey(ph), who was Mr.\nSchmidt's boss in the Treasury Department. There were a couple of other people who were\nvery actively engaged in it. And I really can't remember how many people were actually on\nthe, on the delegation. I think my deputy, Walter Surrey(ph), was actually on the delegation.\nAnd in the Treasury Department, probably, a fellow named Joe Duboy(ph), Doobwah(ph),\nDooboise(ph), D-U-B-O-I-S, was, was on it. And a...very actively on the delegation was a\nfellow named James Mann(ph), who was later in the American legation in Berne as a\nTreasury Department representative in Berne, Switzerland, and he was very active in all this.\nHe and Orvis Schmidt were probably the ones who dealt the most with the issues of looted\ngold because that was an issue which seemed peculiarly to fall in the hands of the Treasury\nDepartment rather than the State Department. And that pretty much made up the American,\nAmerican delegation. Randolph Paul was the head of the delegation and very active.",
        "A:I was the only person what?",
        "A:I am the, I am the only one of the negotiators in these negotiations who is surviving in the sense\nthat I was the head of the negotiation in all, all four of these negotiations and so far as the\nSwiss, so far as the Swiss, French, British and so forth, I'm the only one. Randolph Paul is\ndead, so I'm the...the other people on the American delegation and the Swiss thing, well, Jim\nMann is dead, Randolph, well Randolph is dead, Walter Surrey is dead. I can't think of\nanybody else on the delegation who has survived. There is one other person who is alive\nwho knows a good deal, deal about this and that is Morton Bock(ph), whose name I may\nhave mentioned before, who's living up here in Washington, not far away from where I am\nnow, who's still a good friend of mine. He's ten years older than I am, so, it gives me hope\nthat I'll be able to go on for a little while longer anyway. And he was around in, probably in\nthe Treasury Department, at the time of these negotiations. I have a difficulty remembering\nwhether Mort was actually in the Treasury Department. I guess he was in the Treasury\nDepartment, maybe during the negotiations. He may have actually gone over to the\nAmerican Legation in Berne at the time, but he probably would have come back for the\nnegotiations if he had been over there. But I, I, I know about Mort very well, but I can't\nremember really whether he sat in on these negotiations or not.",
        "A:Yes, it did. The negotiations were not very, not very friendly except for the fact that I became\nvery friendly with a few of the people afterward, like Shtayburger(ph), who was a wonderful\nguy and who was not as stern as that. But Stucki was a rather stiff, you might call middle\nEuropean bureaucrat, diplomat. And he took very strongly the, the, the Swiss line that there\nwas no entitlement on the part of the Allies to any of these German assets in Switzerland, let\nalone the heirless assets. And, that was the line which he took very, very strongly. I might\ndeviate a little bit here to say that, that same line, basically, was taken by a very different\nperson whose name was Emil Sandstrom, who was head of the Swedish delegation.\nSandstrom had been a justice of the Supreme Court of Sweden, he was the head of the\nLeague of Red Cross Societies,'! he was a wonderful, wonderful, man. And he, as a lawyer\nand as a Swede, took the same line, that the Allies were not entitled to the German private\nassets in, in, in Sweden. But the Swedish attitude was, okay, fellas, we don't think you're\nentitled to these things, but we think we should be making some kind of contribution, not\n11 perhaps Mr, Rubin is referring to the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC). This\nwas the umbrella organization of all of the regional Red Cross offices. (See Jacques Picard,\nSwitzerland and the Assets of the Missing Victims of the Nazis. Bank Julius Baer: 1993.)\nonly to, to the Allied reparations finances, but also to the refugees. They had taken in a lot of\nrefugees, of course, during the war and, basically, what we'll do, a calculation. How much\nyou think you'll be entitled to and we'll make that available as a pro bono gift. So we give it\nto you as a gift, you take it as your due, whatever the theory, the money gets over there. And\nthen we don't have to argue about the law of the, the international law with respect to enemy\nprivate property, enemy private property. So that, that, that the negotiations with the Swedes\nwent swimmingly and very...on a very friendly basis. With the Swiss, they were stiff and\nStucki, having said you're not entitled to anything, for quite awhile, went back to\nSwitzerland for further consultation, then he came back here and pretty much reiterated the\nsame point. And then I suppose I made, well, somebody\u2019s described me as having made a\nmoral argument, which may or may not have had some kind of effect, that not only are we\nentitled to this legally, but there\u2019s a moral obligation on the part of Switzerland because\nSwitzerland, well, they allegedly armed themselves to resist any aggression if it should\ncome and did not bear any of the real costs of the war and all sorts of other people did. And\nwe arrived at the conclusion.",
        "A:Oh, I remember saying it in one of the meetings, yes. Yes. I don't remember whether I put it in\nwriting or not.",
        "A:Oh, the response was one of well, maybe, or something. It was not a very...1t was not yes, you've\nconvinced us and here you are with the money. But in the end, they went back and they did\ncome back with a proposal, as I say, which was not as satisfactory as I would have liked it to\nbe, but it was better than saying get out of our hair, we\u2019re not going to give you a nickel.",
        "A:My moral argument?",
        "A:Honestly, I think it had some effect. I think it had some effect. I think that it may have had some\neffect, more because they began to think a little bit about the public relations aspect than,\nthan any other aspect of it. It may be, and I do not condemn Mr. Stucki as being a Nazi, I\ndon\u2019t think he was, he was a very stern, stiff Swiss diplomat. But I have sort of a feeling,\nand he was you know, sympathetic in the sense of what had been going on, but I suspect that\nbasically, what he began to think about was the possibility that there not only was a\nplausible legal argument which they continued to deny, but I am convinced that my rhetoric\nwas sufficiently good, my logic sufficiently good and my demonstration sufficiently good so\nthat maybe I inculcated a few doubts even in the mind of people like Professor Borchard(ph)\nup at Yale. And I think maybe I did the same thing with Mr. Stucki and maybe with...and\ncertainly with Mr. Rappard(ph). But then I think also, the moral argument appealed to them\nin a sense because maybe there was... it had some effect as a moral argument and more\nbecause it had an effect as an argument they thought about as a possibility of public\nrelations. What's going to happen if the Allies really come forward with this and they say\nthat on, on a moral basis, the Swiss have been bastards. That, I think, probably had some\neffect. How much effect, I do not know. I ain\u2019t no psychologist.",
        "A:Oh yes, I'm sure, I'm sure that the fact that these arguments were being made on a moral basis,\netcetera, had a, had a considerable effect. They're thinking about their future relations. The\nBritish, on their side, were thinking about being a little more lenient, I think, than the\nAmericans were, partially because they wanted to re-establish financial relations with the\nSwiss, and I have no doubt that the Swiss wanted to re-establish financial relations with\neverybody. That, of course, was one of the reasons why they were so insistent and so they\nwere so anxious about getting rid of the proclaimed list, getting rid of the blacklist.",
        "A:Oh, yes, yes. That was central to the negotiations, of course. The Swiss were saying, one of the\nthings we have to have is the elimination of the blacklist. And we were saying, you don\u2019t get\nthat until we get this agreement. And then we said, as soon as you get the agreement...I\nthink, I'm trying to think whether we said as soon as you get the agreement or as soon as the\nagreement is implemented, you get rid of the blacklist. To my shame, I really can\u2019t\nremember which one we said. I think probably we said something about implementation.",
        "A:It had to be ratified by their Parliament, that's right, that's nght. And I remember, and this is in the\ncomments which I made...the article I wrote about the Swedish agreement, I, I pointed out\nthat the Swedish agreement was implemented very, very...almost immediately, if not\nimmediately.",
        "A:I'm sure that they were.",
        "A:Well, I wouldn\u2019t say it harmed the negotiation. It certainly didn\u2019t help them. I mean, it would\nhave helpful, I think, had there been a little more publicity about what was going on. As, the\npoint I made a little while ago, which was that one of the reasons why I think the Swiss\ncame to the conclusion that they did at the very end, perhaps inadequate as that was, was\nthat, the fear of publicity. And publicity here would have, I think, pushed them a little bit\nfurther on. They had a very competent ambassador here in town, Mr. Bruggemann, and my\nrecollection is that we talked with him and he was very anxious to have this agreement\nconcluded. I'm, I'm not...I don't recall very much that, that, that he took any part in the\nnegotiations but I do have a very strong feeling that he was anxious to get this thing over\nwith and he probably back home was pushing Mr. Stucki quite a bit, back home in the\nembassy here, the liaison. He was married, incidentally, to a lady who had been an\nAmerican, who maybe still was an American, who was Henry Wallace's\u201d sister, who was\napparently, allegedly, the only non-native born Swiss who ever spoke Schweizerdeutsch(ph)\nperfectly.",
        "A:I do not recall that we ever got to see Mr. Truman, that I...I don't recall any particular expression\nfrom him. I was reasonably sure that we had his support in the White House. Back in those\ndays, you sort of stuck around where you were. You didn't go through back channels as\nmuch as they do at the present time and, and I didn't have any back channels at the White\nHouse anyway. Even Randolph, Randolph Paul, I, I, I doubt that he ever saw Mr. Truman\nabout this. But, you know, the thesis was, when we began the negotiations, we knew what\nwe wanted and we never had any lack of support. Now if we'd, if we'd perhaps said to the\nWhite House, why don't you go to see the, why don't you call in the ambassador\u2019? and tell\nthe ambassador in, here sitting in the Oval Office, that if they don't do something, we're\ngoing to be in, they're going to be in very bad shape. Maybe we should have done that, we\nnever thought about doing it, as far as I know. And I don't think that Randolph Paul ever\nthought about doing it either.\n'2 Henry Wallace, Vice President of the United States in 1941.\n'S United States Ambassador to Switzerland at this time was Leland Harrison.",
        "A:Well, I might talk a little bit about the Swedish negotiations just because it, it does form a very\nbig contrast to the Swiss. And there's an article in, in one of the Swiss newspapers, the Swiss\ninterviewed me a little while ago and there's an article which...have you seen that?",
        "A:...which says, difficult Swiss, amiable Swedes, something like that, about the...",
        "A:If you like, I don\u2019t know whether this is relevant to this oral history or not, you know, I was very\nmuch involved in the negotiations with the Hague and, and that sort of thing. I think to a\ncertain extent, but let me talk a little bit about the, the, the restitution process, the Jewish\nRestitution Successor Organization\u2019* because that is very much involved here and people\nare saying that the Jews didn\u2019t get what they should and...\n(Pause on tape)",
        "A:I think what I would like to mention, briefly, I\u2019ve only read two things, really. One is the question\nof the contrast between the Swiss and the Swedish negotiations. In both cases, we were\nlooking for pretty much the same thing. We were looking for the German assets in the two\ncountries, to take for reparation purposes. We were looking for restitution of looted gold, if\nthere were any looted gold there, and we were looking for some kind of claims with respect\n'4 Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO): Based in New York, JRSO was organized\nby various Jewish philanthropic organizations to handle restitution issues.\nto the persecutees. In neither case, did we have any problem with respect to individual\nclaims of people who had come in and identified their property. There never was any, any\nissue about that. So far as the Swedes were concerned, they also made a contribution so far\nas the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees'!? was concerned. But so for the\ndifference between the two negotiations, was that the Swiss were very, very sticky so far as\nthe legal aspects were concerned. Maybe legitimately, I don\u2019t know. There still are people\nwho argue that enemy private property is, 1s sacrosanct and maybe not. And they also were\nvery difficult with respect to the one aspect, that I think is very important, the question of\nidentification of, of heirless assets in, in Switzerland. In that particular case, it seems to me,\nthey could very well at that particular point, have done basically what Paul Volcker is doing\nat the present time, with much less trouble than Mr. Volcker is having to go through:\nidentify, if not 100 percent of the heirless assets, at least 95 percent or 85 percent or\nsomething like that, and restituted those to an, a successor organization like the Jewish\nRestitution Successor Organization which was operating very successfully back in those\ndays, and right across the border in Germany. On the Jewish Restitution Successor\nOrganization, I think it's important to note, in connection with the, the possible, their\npossible role in, in Switzerland, their possible role as a successful organization in\nSwitzerland, that they did exactly that in the American Zone of Germany, very, very\nsuccessfully. The JRSO did obtain a tremendous amount of, of property in Germany which\nhad been looted from Jews and so forth, and that was, was properly restituted, etcetera. They\nalso were able to participate in the negotiations with the Germans on, perhaps, the larger\nissue of the, of restitution of jobs, of taking care of people who had been in concentration\ncamps and giving them some kind of compensation, inadequate, obviously, as monetary\ncompensation ever would be for that kind of thing. They still were able to get people some\n'S Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees (IGCR): \"A body formed in 1938 to manage a\nsolution to the problem of Jewish refugees. Switzerland was reluctant to involve itself with this\nbody.\" (Source: Jacques Picard, Switzerland and the Assets of the Missing Victims of the Nazis.)\nkind of compensation for the loss of career, the loss of jobs, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So\nthe JRSO could have been a very, very effective operating agency here. On the question of\nheirless assets, they could have, I think, helped a great deal, and I am not minimizing the\ndifficulty of identification of heirless assets, even in Switzerland. We had the same problem\nhere in the United States. We had property in the United States which was vested by the\nAlien Property Custodian, on the grounds that it had come from Germany. And there was no\nway of telling whether that property coming from Germany had been the property of a Jew,\nwho died in Bergen-Belsen or wherever, or had been the property of Mr. Goering,!\u00b0 except\nby taking a look at the names. If you didn't have the names, basically all you knew, was that\nthe account had been established by somebody in Germany and if the name was ambiguous\nand so forth, you didn't really know. We claim, we, the JSRO in the United States, claim\nthat there should be about three million dollars on our best estimate, and that was an\nestimate made on the very, very crude business of taking a look at names and lists and things\nlike that, in the assets which had been vested by the Alien Property Custodian and which\nwere being turned over to the War Claims Commission here in the United States to pay\nUnited States war claims. Negotiations in the United States resulted in our first coming\ndown to a figure of three million dollars as the amount of money which we thought would\nbe adequate for this particular vested, vested asset, amount of heirless assets. Then that had\nto be reduced, because the War Claims Commission and others would refuse to accept it, to\none million, and in the end, we had the Congress pass legislation which gave to the JRSO,\nonly half a million dollars. Which indicates the difficulty of having, of identifying heirless\nassets even in a situation where you have the entire forces of the government trying to work\nwith you. So, I think that perhaps the situation in, in Switzerland is, in a sense,\nunderstandable. I'm not sure how much there will be located in the way of heirless assets,\n'\u00a9 Reichs Air Minister and Economic Tzar: Responsible for huge amounts of looted art which he\nfunneled into Nazi Germany's national collections as well as his own collections. (See Klaus\nFischer, Nazi Germany, Continuum: New York 1995.)\nparticularly in view of all of these other factors. But the assets should have been restituted to\nthe, restored to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization back in those days. It should\nhave been made available in those days to the, either the Joint Distribution Committee or the\nJewish Agency, and should have gone for purposes of relief which would have been much\nmore relevant back then than, than they are at the present time. I say it would have been\nmore relevant back then than they are at the present time, because even though I'm\nconscious of the fact that there are a number of people who are still impoverished here 1n the\nUnited States, I can not really believe that...\nTape #2, Side B",
        "A:...people who are still impoverished here in the United States, I can not really believe that these\nassets would be, if they went into this, this kind of account, very, very significant in terms of\nthe total amounts that have been made available to the persecutees. The total amounts made\navailable to persecutees come, basically, out of all sorts of sources, but I, I think, primarily,\nout of the sources that came from Germany in connection with the Hague negotiations,\nwhich, at Vassanar(ph) in which I participated in 1952 and '53, where we negotiated on\nbehalf of both the government of Israel on the one side and the Conference on Jewish\nMaterial Claims Against Germany on the other side, as the two Jewish organizations,\nnegotiated, negotiated there. And then the government of Israel was represented on its own\nbehalf and then, of course, the Germans, represented by, very largely by a, a first class\ngentleman named Boehm(ph), I can't remember his first name, B-O-E-H-M, who was a\nwonderful, wonderful guy. And we did negotiate there, and there have been negotiations\nwhich have been going on ever since, and there has been a lot of money which has been\npaid into various accounts which, I think, has gone to recompense persecutees and their\nsurvivors, etcetera. I'm not saying, as I say, that the people who survived and the heirs and\nso forth, are not entitled. They're very much entitled to everything that they, they could\npossibly get. Certainly, they're entitled, if they can establish claims, to the property which\nwas left by one of their own ancestors. And certainly, also, they're entitled to whatever\namount may come into the pot which goes into a pot of heirless assets, basically. But that\namount that's going to go into the heirless asset pot is going to be minuscule compared to the\namounts which have already gone in and so forth. And that, I think, is probably true even\nwith respect to looted gold. There may be some looted gold which should be recovered,\nwhich has come out of the concentration camps, but you have to remember, a large amount\nof that looted gold was recovered in Germany itself. It was recovered at the, at the death\ncamps. I know that one of the officials of the International Refugee Organization!\u2019 came to\nSwitzerland with a couple of jerry cans filled with bracelets and gold teeth and so forth, and\nbrought them into the American legation in Switzerland, and by arrangement with them,\nthey were taken over to a, a cooperating Swiss bank and they were...those things were all\nsmelted down and the proceeds were paid to the International Refugee Organization for the\naccount of the, of the survivors and so, paid into the, into the interest of the...probably\nthrough the Jewish Agency and the JDC, but they went for the purposes about...but most of\nthat stuff was probably recovered in, in Germany itself. A large amount of it must have\ndisappeared, as I say, a large part of 1t was confiscated, a large part probably confiscated by\nguards at the camps, and a certain amount of it, certainly, went into the smelting pots and\nwas eventually stamped and came out again as the, with the Reichsbank stamp on it. So\nthere may be some additional amount available there. How much is a, is a matter which I\nthink will be very difficult to tell. One other thing about the Swiss, and the claim against\nSwitzerland, most of the money, I think, probably went...a lot of the money at any rate, went\nthrough Switzerland and did not remain, remain in Switzerland. I doubt that there's very\nmuch of the German gold still sitting there in a bank vault. Maybe there is some...Jew..some\nproperty still there, either gold bars or the things we also consider to be looted property,\npaintings, silverware, etcetera, not only in the, in the large Swiss banks, but maybe in some\n'7 International Refugee Organization: The major organization dedicated to the relief of refugees\nfrom the Nazi menace. Also called the IFO.\nof the Swiss private banks, or in the hands of individuals in Switzerland. It's very, very\ndifficult to, to tell about that. I, I think the amounts that we're talking about, that have been\ntalked about recently, are, are substantially exaggerated. And, about the only thing I would\nlike to add at the present time, is that I think the Swiss are, at the present time, maybe\nreluctantly and maybe under compulsion, making an effort to do something about it, despite\nthe charges which were made just the other day that all this is on the basis of, of blackmail.\nAnd beyond that, so far as the...my participation in, in, in Vassanar(ph) and the Hague is\nconcerned, about all I can say is that I was, as I said, a member of... was working with the\nAmerican Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Committee was very, very much\ninvolved in these negotiations which set up the negotiations at Vassanar(ph). I was one of\nthe four people on the, on the Jewish delegation representing the Conference on Jewish\nMaterial Claims Against Germany. I think Moe(ph) Levitt(ph) representing the JDC, I\nrepresenting, I don't know, a variety of organizations, I guess, certainly the American Jewish\nCommittee, a fellow named Alec(ph) Easterman(ph) representing the Conference of, the\nBoard of Jewish Deputies or something like that. And Maurice(ph) Bookstein(ph) who was\nrepresenting, I guess, the Jewish Agency at, at the time. And we were the four so-called\nprincipal negotiators. Sitting up on top of us were Jacob(ph) Blaustein(ph) who was then\nPresident of the American Jewish Committee, and that absolutely glorious character,\nNachem(ph) Goldman(ph) who then was, I guess, President of the Jewish Agency and the\nWorld Jewish Congress and so forth. And those were the two who did a lot of negotiating\nwith...on behalf of these claims. Nachem in particular was a very...very close to Konrad\nAdenauer and Jacob Blaustein was absolutely essential, I think, in going to General Clay\nand other people in the United States government, and they did a wonderful, wonderful job\nthere. I participated in those negotiations in the Hague... went on to be one of the few people\ntogether with Nehemiah(ph) Robinson(ph) who thought we would ever get anything out of\nthe Austrians. And Nehemiah Robinson was with the World Jewish Congress. He and I\nwere the only ones who thought negotiating with the Austrians was going to do anything at\nall because the Austrians had been declared to be an occupied country by the Allies by, way\nback in Moscow in 1943. And they were saying, who us? We're not guilty. And then we had\nsome negotiations with the Austrians and in 1955, I initialed an agreement in Vienna with\nthe entire Austrian cabinet on the other side of the table which resulted in the payment of\nabout 50 million dollars into a so-called Hilth(ph) Fund, which was administered by the\nJewish organizations, by the Committee for Jewish Claims On Austria. The big distinction\nbeing that we got a conference for Jewish claims against Germany, but a committee for\nJewish claims on Austria. It was supposed to reflect the difference. And that fund was, as far\nas I know, administered. It was inadequate, but it was something that the Austrians did pay\nin despite the fact that they were considered to be more liberated than, and an occupied\ncountry, than an ally of Germany. And that, I think, is about it.\n"
