        "A: And at that time, you know, the classes and so on were still quite, not segregated, but there\nwas a -- a fact -- a separation -- factual separation, so I lived very much in that kind of a -- not\nprivileged, but I would say self-contained world, mentally, values and so on. I don\u2019t want to be\ncritical, but you have to realize how --",

        "Q: Mm-hm. Can you tell us a little bit more about your childhood, about the town that you grew\nup in? You mentioned something about the sugar industry. In what way was your family\ninvolved? What we\u2019re trying to do is get a sense of the community and the values and the world\nthat you grew up in, so whatever you could tell us about that child -- those childhood years --",
        "A: Well, that childhood was extremely happy, you see, I -- I never went to grammar school\nbecause I was too good to be sent to, you know, that country school. We were living in the\ncountry, and --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- well, I enjoyed -- I was very happy at the time, and just no -- we had no worries, and then\ncame -- you see, the Great Depression, beca -- at that time, because a -- the family business was a\nsugar producing and also [indecipherable] owning lots of farms and so on and so we were very\ninvolved in the agricultural way. And then my grandfather was a very capable and creative\nbusinessman, but he did not train, you see, his children and so on and so they were a background\nalso [indecipherable] and that sort of thing, because the economic situation in western Europe at\nthat time was difficult, particularly in the area of agricultural production and so on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And in the sugar business, is -- that was something your father himself was involved\nin?",
        "A: No, no, that\u2019s the family business --",
        "Q: I see.",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- so that was entirely private thing, and just a -- but the times were th -- because the prices\nwere going up and down and then the harvests, you know, were long and difficult and so on.",
        "Q: You --",
        "A: I think there was a catastrophic year, I forgot when it was, 1935 or so.",
        "Q: And you mentioned before that when the war occurred --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- you were -- you see yourself as somebody who was totally unprepared --",
        "A: Unprepared.",
        "Q: -- fo-for what had happened fo -- afterwards.",
        "A: And it happened very suddenly because, you know, the war was declared by France and\nEngland. I think it was on September -- on September first, Germany invaded Poland, right? And\nthen there was a, I don\u2019t know, an ultimatum or something, and the war between Germany and\nEngland and France started on -- I think on September third, and then there was a period, you\nknow, a long period of neutrality and suspense and so on, and then on --",
        "Q: In Belgium?",
        "A: -- May the 10\" --",
        "Q: In Belgium, you s --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] in Belgium, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And on May the 10\", the German invaded Belgium and Holland if I am correct, and so on.\nThen th-that --",
        "Q: Do you remember that?",
        "A: -- for me who was still a -- a teenager, was a child, 1t came very suddenly, because all -- in\nour y-younger years, you know, we heard stories about the atrocities and suffering during the\nfirst World War, which was still reasonably close at the time, so -- so we were frightened, but we\ndidn\u2019t know what we feared.",
        "Q: Do you have a memory of when the invasion occurred? Do you remember where you were at\nthe time?",
        "A: Sure, sure, sure.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about that?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Well, the -- I was already in Namur at the time, and then I think there was some bombing and\nso on, and then -- then we left for France and so on, so -- so there 1s a -- was a retreat -- I mean, a\n-- we left the house, and so on the -- and then the -- there were battle and so on, just -- but well,\nthat\u2019s -- that is not so clear in my memory, just that -- I just remember vaguely.",
        "Q: How -- did you return to Namur at any time?",
        "A: Yes, yes, of course --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- we return, and then -- and then the -- I don\u2019t know, I -- I -- I think the studies were\ninterrupted, but 1t was -- no, I -- and I -- and wa -- 1941 I was back -- back to Namur, and so on.\nAnd then I -- I met that -- that priest, you know, who took care of those Jewish boys and so on.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about how you met this priest, what his name was?",
        "A: I-I have no recollection of how I met them, but i -- it\u2019s an entirely extraordinary story. If you\nwant -- did you want me to go into what I know of his --",
        "Q: What was his name? What were the circumstances --",
        "A: His name was Jose-Joseph -- you see, now I have a -- excuse me.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m getting old. I never thought I would forget his name. [indecipherable]. Oh, that\u2019s\nridiculous. It will come back.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. It happens sometimes.",
        "A: Yes, it -- no, 1-1t was an extraord -- a very sensitive, young priest --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- a parish priest, and then he was transferred someplace, seminary where he was teaching,\nand it was a very extraordinary, heroic kind of man, very sensitive, and at the same time he could\nbe -- violently could get fits of anger and so on, but not at all, you know, resentments, so on, just\nbecause at times he was -- I mean, he was oversensitive. And then he was -- you are -- now are\ngoing to the substance of my --",
        "Q: Yeah, I'd like to find out more how -- how it is that you got involved in this activity.",
        "A: That -- [have no memory of it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Why, I just got involved. I suppose I met him, or somebody told me about tt.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But the story is that there was a parish house in -- on a sort of [indecipherable] and so on, but\nthat is very local, it\u2019s not to be compared to the setting of Washington, it was very simple. And\nthere was a parish house here, and then next to it, exactly next to it, the same wall, there was a\nbig hotel before the war, which was occupied by the German Gestapo and various German\nservices in that town. So we had a wall, and when I was sitting with the wall, I could hear the\nGerman officers on the outside. And then that priest, you know, slowly -- I -- I -- I suppose he\nwas in touch -- no, later on he was in touch with the various Jewish idi -- organization. But we\nhad as many as 20 boys in that house, you see, and on the first floor was a sort of a big room\nwith a theater and so on, where the boys could at least take some exercise. And then, on the top\nthere were his office and so on. And the boys actually lived in that house, you see, for -- they\ncould not go out, right? And -- and that\u2019s the reason why he got in touch with me, because we\nwanted to, you know, on Sunday -- on Saturdays and Sundays, well mostly on Sundays, I\nsuppose, we gathered, you know, neighborhood boys and so on, right, and then the Jewish\nchildren joined them and so -- so they could get some exercise and fresh air.",
        "Q: So, if I can understand this correctly, there was a house that belonged to the college --",
        "A: To the parish, or to the --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, to the parish in Namur.",
        "A: I shou -- in Namur, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. And the priest who lived in the house --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- it was -- 1t was --",
        "A: It was a parish house for certain functions, I suppose the parish functions.",
        "Q: And he was the one who started saving the children.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And were these -- how old was the range, the age range of the children who were",
        "A: Oh, the children, I could not say, I would say about seven -- the -- we -- as far as I recall, we\nhave no small children and so on, they were all, you know, beginning teenagers and so on.",
        "Q: So they were -- uh-huh.",
        "A: And no more than 12, I would say.",
        "Q: And what was --",
        "A: But then of course, they change. You see, there was --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- a rotation. I -- I don\u2019t know, I -- yeah.",
        "Q: How was -- what was your involvement in it? Was it that you were a group of other boys --",
        "A: My involvement was pure, not charity. I was -- as I told you, I was immature, I didn\u2019t know\nwhat I was doing. I was very happy to do it. I had a great, not love, but I mean I liked the boys, I\nseem to remember some of them. So -- and -- but my function, what I actually did was simply to\ntake them out with other friends.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And so you would take them out --",
        "A: So I --",
        "Q: -- for playing and for exercise?",
        "A: -- to -- yeah, yeah, and exercise and play ball, and that sort of thing and so on. But -- and then,\nyou see that -- so, we had the Gestapo next door --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- right? And then, on the first floor, and then there was a roof, you see, on --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- on the top of the house, without any heating, with mattresses on the floor. And at times I\nsaw with my own eyes there\u2019s something -- sometime 15 children and so on. A-And mostly --\nmost of them, if I am correct, I don\u2019t -- came from Poland and Vienna.",
        "Q: Did you get -- did you have a common language that you --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: I see, so you never --",
        "A: Well, of course the -- they knew su -- I don\u2019t know -- know, really. Communication was\nrather poor in the sense -- because most of them had language problems, right, and actually the\npriest, after the -- after the -- I mean the liberation of the country, created si -- courses in -- in\nHebrew for -- for the boys. And the most important part of my testimony as far as I\u2019m concerned,\nthat I believe, I don\u2019t know that, but -- I don\u2019t know how many, but certainly perhaps a thousand\nboys, over the years, you know, went through that system.",
        "Q: So there -- about -- over a thousand boys were -- went through the school, through this house",
        "A: No, no, no, no --",
        "Q: -- excuse me, this house that they were saving --",
        "A: -- they were -- they just were --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- they were sheltered there, they found a shelter. But you have to realize th-th-the that e-\nextraordinary, absolutely extraordinary to keep boys --",
        "Q: Next to the --",
        "A: -- and I never witness any -- you know, any lack of discipline or anything there. The boys,\nmost of them were so conscious of their situation and -- and so disciplined and so on. But I want\n-- I wanted to say two things. The first thing is that as far as I know, only one boy who I changed\nhis fate, you know, so [indecipherable] it was part of the system to protect the Jewish -- and also\nperhaps even more than the Jewish aspect, the -- the authority of the parents. And that was very\nbeautiful, I never forgot that. Well, that\u2019s one thing, and the second thing again, as far as I know,\nnot one boy was caught and so he saved them, really save --",
        "Q: That was one of my questions, is the fate of these children, as far as you knew it, that these\nchildren did not fall into the hands of the Gestapo, who were right next --",
        "A: They did not.",
        "Q: They did not.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Th-Then one day, a father of one of our boys was shot to --",
        "Q: Excuse me for a second -- [tape break] -- uh-huh?",
        "A: For a day and night. Cause that\u2019s what I said, the Germans also heard, you see, voices, and I-I\n-- | -- [never understood how he could maintain, you know, that th -- type of discipline\nnecessary for their safety, for their protection.",
        "Q: Did --",
        "A: And in addition --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- there was, of course, an enormous problem of feeding them. You see, every citizen received\ncoupons or stamps and so on, and so we had to find food and nourishment for those boys. And --\nand we ha -- had not only to prepare the meal, and then but al-also to feed them, and to avoid\nnoises and so on. And quite frankly, I never understood how it was achieved, and sin -- and so\non, because it --",
        "Q: Were any of your friends involved in this as well?",
        "A: No, no, yeah, I-I myself only came, only on Sundays and Saturdays, so I -- I was not an\noutsider, but I was not involved in the actually daily routine of the -- of the shelter. And so 1 --\nyou have to -- also to understand that there was a network around that place, you see, providing\nfood, nourishment and so on. There was an er -- a truly heroic nurse who was heading sort of an\noffice -- sort of Red Cross offices, where the boys were treated and so on. Bu -- and all that was\nin -- achieving sec -- complete secrecy and so on. And that person, after having given herself to\nthat work for three year -- three years, on the very last day, a few days before the liberation, she\ngot -- she was killed in a bombing, and so on -- o-on the spot and her body was thrown on the\nwall [indecipherable]. And it was a truly -- I mean, extraordinary person, extra -- a nurse\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: No, her name I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know?",
        "A: I forgot, because you know I -- all these sad experiences has been extremely deep, I mean\n[indecipherable] really attached, but I did not follow it through. For -- for instance, if you had\ninformed me that -- this interview, I would have gone to talk to people [indecipherable] but th --",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: -- no, it -- it\u2019s not important, no.",
        "Q: No, it -- it\u2019s simply -- it\u2019s n -- 1t\u2019s helpful to have the name of the person you are talking\nabout, if you remember it.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And if not it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: -- we can leave it by the side. Were there any of -- any other of your friends that you knew of,\neven if not directly, who in some way were involved in the sheltering?",
        "A: Yes, of course, of course, there were a -- a number of -- why, as a matter of fact, I -- very\nrecently I got in touch with a -- who is now al -- a priest also, but he was a boy at the time of\nthose events, and he had known that Joseph Andre -- now the name comes --",
        "Q: See? Mr. Joseph Andre was the priest.",
        "A: The priest, the name --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- of the priest.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I -- I was saying yes, I -- I know that yeah, tha -- h-he was a boy at the time and that priest\ncame to his fath -- his parents had a little farm or something --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- and so they got supply, I mean the -- the shelter got supplies from them, and so --",
        "Q: Excuse me, can you repeat that? I didn\u2019t fully understand.",
        "A: You didn\u2019t understand, no? No, I just met recently --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: -- the priest, who was younger than me, and when he was a child, his parents supplied\npotatoes and eggs and so on and so --",
        "Q: To the school -- to the boys, mm-hm.",
        "A: Bu-But the main -- th-the one who worked most with the -- the priest and myself, died\nrecently. So should I continue?",
        "Q: Oh yes, please.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yes, yes, please.",
        "A: So, if you want, I-I could tell you how this extraordinary experience ended, so -- becau -- ah\nyes, I was telling you that the father of one of our boys was shot by the Gestapo on the street, and\nthen, that moment I was called by phone, and I really risked my existence on that date, because\nof course the shelter, it was at the back of the house in -- in the cellar, down cellar --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You see, on the other side. And so all the boys escaped, and I took charge of a group of five\nor six, with the Gestapo [indecipherable] but I-I was not aware that -- I -- I was -- it was not an\nheroic action, it was just a purely human, but 1n fact, 1t was.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because -- and then the priest fled, disappeared. Hi-His brother was arrested, he was\n[indecipherable] and so on, and other people were -- are arrested, but none of the boys was\ncaptured.",
        "Q: Did the Gestapo know that they were in the house, and they came looking for them?",
        "A: Ah yes, I -- at that time, yes.",

        "A: At that time, yes.",
        "Q: And was that close to the end, or was th --",
        "A: It was close to the end of the war, yes, of course, and -- and then the boys were\n[indecipherable] and I went to a marvelous -- well, she was a nun with a very strong character\nand so on and she was in charge of an orphanage and so on. And so I took my boys to her and\nthat was the end as far as I was concerned, just to -- but then after that -- if -- should I continue?",
        "Q: Yes, please, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, yes. So the priest fled, the boys were -- disappeared, none of them was captured, well --\nand in September, I think, the -- the place, or the town was liberated by the U.S. first army. And\nthen that was a beautiful memory I have because the Jewish chaplain of the American unit\ninvited me and the priest for the celebration of the Jewish New Year. I forgot the exact date, but I\ndon\u2019t know --",
        "Q: In September.",

        "Q: Okay, then we can back up a little bit.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: When you were talking about when the Gestapo started to hunt for these boys --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that were in the house, you mentioned that one boy had his -- had his father shot --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- close by. Can you tell us a little bit about those circumstances, and how is it the connection\nwas established? How is it that the Gestapo knew that the father had a son there, or did they?",
        "A: No, because then we -- first of all, we knew, since the boy were -- a-as far as I recall, you say\nthe fa -- the father of that boy was shot a few steps from the house, and so on. But you -- we\nknew that we were in danger, but how the alert was given, that I-I have no recollection of that. I\njust know that at a certain hour in the morning, I was called by a friend working with that priest\nand so on, that I had to come at once, and then I was put in charge of a group of boys.",
        "Q: Even more to step back, what were the circumstances of this man\u2019s -- how is it that he came\nto be there, that he was --",

        "A: I just know that this happened, and from that moment of course we were all in mortal danger\nbecause --",
        "Q: Because they could see the -- they could go and look for the boys.",
        "A: -- a-and the house must have been watch and so on, and --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. When --",
        "A: But it ended in a very sudden way, that all the boys fled through the -- that escape door on the\nother si -- on another street, you see, on the other side of the building, and --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Now, when you would go out and play with them on Saturdays and Sundays --",

        "A: Normal, you know, boyish activities and so one, the --",
        "Q: What\u2019s that?",
        "A: Walking, first of all. They were happy to be out, which was not given, you know, very\nfrequently. You must imagine what it is for a boy to be shut in a house and so on and then I\nsuppose we played ball and that sort of thing. It lasted a -- the outing lasted about four hours or\nsomething of that sort.",
        "Q: Would it use --",
        "A: In the afternoon.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Would it use -- was it in the town, was it in, let\u2019s say outside the town where -- did\nother people see you as you --",
        "A: Of course, sure, sure.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But they thought it was a church, normal church activity, you see, just --",
        "Q: I see, so did anybody ever look at these children and say they --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: -- they don\u2019t look like our children?",
        "A: No, no, as far as I know, no.",

        "A: A-A-Anyway, I have no 1-idea.",
        "Q: I see, I see. So your outings were not like in the woods where no one would see them, they\nwere within the usual --",
        "A: No, no, no, no, I mean, it was totally open and so on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was a normal parish activity, and -- but I -- as I say, tha-that priest was extremely sensitive\nto any proselyting and so on, and as far as I recall, those who -- the boys who had placed 1n that\norphanage and so on, actually on Sundays [indecipherable] they went to church, but they were\ngiven instructions, you see to respect their own Jewish practices and liturgies. Although they\nphysically participated, they were warned by that nun, or by the priests themselves, not to do\nanything. And that, I think is a very beautiful part of the story.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I would a -- how -- can you tell me in total how long, how many years were you\ninvolved with -- with -- with taking care of these boys in that house?",
        "A: [indecipherable] that was very, very short, because he actually went into that house, you see,\nin \u00b041.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then I-I -- \u2019'm not clear, I do not know the -- the actually links he had with Jewish\norganizations. I don\u2019t even know their name, but th-they were very active, for instance, they\nsupplied food stamps, you see.",

        "A: In September.",
        "Q: In September, yes. Well [indecipherable] yes?",
        "A: [indecipherable] the war lasted until May 8, 1945.",

        "A: And then, I don\u2019t know how, I don -- I forgot how it took place, why it -- but it was a very\nshort period I told you, aba -- af-after the liberation of the camp.

        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: -- the first thing I -- we were greeted, the camp of Buchenwald was governed by Yugoslav\ncommunists. And so those communists were totally in control of the camp when we -- we came.\nAnd so when, I don\u2019t know how, I -- I won\u2019t call it a privilege, but yet it is something important\nfor me. I was taken by a team of those com -- so it\u2019s a first experience --",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was first experience of communism, because th-there was such a contrast, you see,\nbetween those starving inmates and those, you know, powerful and -- Yugoslav communists. So\nanyway, I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know how I managed, perhaps because I could still already\nspeak some English, I don\u2019t know. But I got an extraordinary experience, because there -- the\nman who guided me [indecipherable] took me really at the -- at the center where they -- they\nwere exterminated. It was a barrack, right, and there was a little yard with a gallows, is that what\nyou call it, right? Where they could hang about 15 people at a time, that -- so the barrack -- the\nbarrack was here and then there was a doctor\u2019s office where the shot, you know, were given to\nthe inmates, and then there was a -- it\u2019s horrible -- a place where the bodies were just piled, and\nso on, and then the cremation oven was nearby. So that man took me there, and of course that\u2019s\nsomething [indecipherable] terrible, I mean not -- although, I mean I\u2019m more impressed by it\nnow than I was when I [indecipherable] Jews with that, you know, immature mentality I had.",
        "Q: Why do you say that, why do you think it? Why was it immature?",
        "A: Because I said -- I proved it, I said, that Iam more moved now by what I experienced then,\nthan I was at the time. But I -- and -- and you have to -- 1-it was an extraordinary experience, this\n-- as far as I recall, that the oven were still used 1n the --",

        "Q: Was this in --",
        "A: Because the American ri -- you know, rush -- you have no idea how fast it went.

And so there was no, as far as I\u2019m -- as I can say, no effective,\nprobably, medical -- Americans are very, very nice, very kind and so on, but it was something\ntotally uncontrolled.

        "A: Three things. First of all, you have to connect right -- no, because for me, for me is -- 1s not at\nall -- is no longer -- is not something -- I\u2019m not centering on the horror of the thing. I see that as a\n-- a-a-as a hope, I mean the -- and recently I got to understand much better the universality of the\nJewish faith, if I may use that word. I don\u2019t whether I -- I hope I do not offend you, be-because\nthe thing is that the root of western culture, although it\u2019s called Judeo-Christian, wi -- ba -- th-the\nfirst root is the -- the col -- the vocation of Israel, for instance, that Shema and so on, for me it\u2019s\nan -- wi -- although I\u2019m a -- a ca -- believer Catholic [indecipherable] believer, there is -- for me\nit\u2019s absolutely fundamental. And I see it -- I would not say that in a Jewish way, but for me I-I\nsee the origin of my own Catholic faith here, right in that extraordinary history of Israel and so\non. No, wh-what I mean to say is that first of all there\u2019s still a tremendous amount of ignorance.\nWhy -- I don\u2019t see why, in every Catholic school, or in every public school there should not be a\n-- some -- a booklet or something, a very short, well written, educative information on the Jewish\ncustoms and so on and on the basic Jewish beliefs and so on.

        "A: Now, we underwent a cultural revolution, wi -- and now the values, the traditional values,\nwhich we call Judean-Christian values are now deconstructed and so on. And there there is a\ntremendous work to do. I\u2019m not negative, and I think that in that -- what I call that cultural\nrevolution, wi -- there is something which could be transformed into a positive [indecipherable]\nthe values of the western culture a-are changed. The change has been very negative and so on,\nbut it -- it\u2019s also, you see, very -- 1-1t could be transformed into a positive -- and there I see if the\nJewish -- if there could be a common formulation. Not that the Jews really should -- to express\nthat basic fundamental reality, the universality of the Jewish message and so on. But that should\nnot be done, you know, by grade, or I don\u2019t know, or books and so on. It should be done -- it\nshould come bottom up, you see? And that could be done. That -- that -- that could be done,\nbecause I\u2019m sure that, first of all that there would be a communion of -- of the jewi -- because I\nam -- been a teacher all my life, you see and I\u2019m oriented towards the -- the younger generation,\nI feel more at ease with -- but if that effort could come bottom up, wi -- through friendship, you\nknow, networking. Of course, there is an intellectual work which has to be done. And that means\neducational work. But the reality should be friendship, should be personal counters, and start,\nyou know, very low profile, not, you know, those big reunions. For instance, my daughter met\nDavid Rosen, Rabbi David Rosen, do you know him?",
        "Q: Mm-mm, no.",
        "A: No, but anyway, he\u2019s a very outstanding person, but you know, now he\u2019s totally identified\nwith those groups 1n [indecipherable] and go to Rome and so on, and you know they captured\nhim and so on, and that aspect of personal encounter, friendship, mutual understanding,\ncooperation where cooperation is possible, that 1s what is lacking, in my judgment.",
        "Q: That\u2019s number two.",
        "A: Number two? [indecipherable]",
        "Q: That\u2019s number two, you said there were three things?",
        "A: No, number one is to formulate, if possible -- first of all to understand why the structural\nframework of that deconstruction, which has now been established --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- and which threatens the basic Jewish faith and tradition and questions and so on, as they do\nfor the Christian and so on. And so there is a commonality, because the origin of Christianity are\nJewish, right?",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes. And the basic -- my faith, the Catholic faith 1s based on the Bible, and -- which is Jewish\nexperience. So, in other word, number one is understanding of the -- of the structure --\nintellectual structure of a deconstruction wh-which si -- is contrary to the fundamental Jewish\ntradition which, insofar is 1t is common to the Christian origin. Right? Number two 1-15, if\npossible, try to be more interactive, or more intelligent in spreading basic knowledge, even for\nkids and so on.",
        "Q: I see, mm-hm.",
        "A: In schools, and so on, and of course at the upper level even more, of Judaism, right? And third\nis that fred -- friendship business.",
        "Q: The context.",
        "A: You know, [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: By internetworking, by --",
        "Q: Did you -- here is an irony. Since we didn\u2019t speak much before the interview, I had very little\ninformation. But of the little that I had, our -- our, you know, contact who told us of you said that\nyou hadn\u2019t spoken much about your experience during the war, that --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- okay. Did you tell your own children?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",

        "A: No --",
        "Q: -- did you tell your own family?",
        "A: [indecipherable] little, very little.",
        "Q: And is there a reason for that? Was that a conscious decision on your part?",
        "A: No, no, there was no reason, I was just --",
        "Q: Did they know --",
        "A: -- too bashful to push myself forward, that\u2019s about it, though. You know, they know about it,\nand --",
        "Q: Then --",
        "A: Because in addition to that experience with the priest, you know, I always thought about --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- I was connected with a -- though that was a very deep friendship and so on, and also with\nmy wife, of a French politician named Michelait I don\u2019t know whether you know his name.",
        "Q: No, his name is not known to me.",
        "A: Anyway, he saved many, many Jews and so on, and he was a gr -- a great friend of mine, and\nhe became minister, he was a friend of de Gaulle. He went to Dachau and se -- and so on, but in\nDachau he -- he worked -- I mean, he did not work, but his association was more with the\ncommunists inmates than with the -- the Jewish people. But he saved, for instance, many Jewish\nfriends I -- I have who I met here in America, just -- so that experience is a little bit divided, but I\nwas a -- I wa -- never reluctant to speak about it and so on, it\u2019s because my role, first of all, what\nI could do, except in that exceptional situation where I really risked my life for them, but I never\nthought I was doing much and so on. It\u2019s only after the war, after the business Buchenwald that\nI-I realized the magnitude of the -- of the Holocaust.",
        "Q: I read a little bit about the Holocaust in Belgium.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: And comparatively to, let\u2019s say the Netherlands, there were in -- in the articles that I read, it\nwas stated that more people were involved in hiding and saving Jews, that f-fewer Jews died. St-\nstill many, many --",
        "A: Mm. Yes.",
        "Q: -- over half were killed, but the percentages were lower in -- in Belgium --",
        "A: Really?",
        "Q: -- than in the Netherlands.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And in some of the other surrounding countries and that there were a number of factors that\ncontributed to that. Is that something that you found also to be --",
        "A: No, I am not aware of that at all, just --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- no. But I am aware of the number of people who performed, you know, heroic action\naround that -- that system, that little system we -- I was a-associated with. I mean --",
        "Q: Was your family -- did your family know what you were doing?",
        "A: No, no, no, not the family, not the -- none of the family. The people around , for instance,\nthere -- you know, there was a -- a bakery and -- a bakery that supplied bread, you know, as a\n[indecipherable] and so on, and -- and that woman really was heroic, heroic. She was leaving\n[indecipherable] not very far from the center. And that sort of thing, a p-place to a-avoid the\nfamily, and so on.",
        "Q: Your family --",
        "A: And go through the --",
        "Q: -- your --",
        "A: -- not my family.",
        "Q: -- no, but --",
        "A: Yeah, [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- did they know what you were doing?",
        "A: They -- no, of course not.",
        "Q: Okay, so neither your parents, nor your brothers or your sisters --",
        "A: No, no, of course not.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that was entirely an un -- individual decision and so on.",
        "Q: Did you speak of --",
        "A: But I do not mean to say that -- no, I -- I was [indecipherable] or that sort of thing. I ju-just\naccepted -- I did not even consciously accepted the risk. I did it as a service for the -- the\nchildren, the boys we had, and --",
        "Q: Do you remember their names, any of the names of the boys?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: We actually never knew them, and --",
        "Q: Bless you. Did yo -- did they stay for just a certain period of this time in this house and then\nmove on?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were there always different boys that were coming?",
        "A: No -- oh yes. Yes, yes, but that was, I think -- I believed at the time that [indecipherable] it\nwas some Jewish organization taking care of that circulation and moving the boys and so on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they were very effective, as proved, as I said, by the coupon -- or they probably printed\nthem, or I don\u2019t know, stole them, or --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But we received whole sheets, you know, of -- of --",
        "Q: Of those ration tickets?",
        "A: Yeah, the ration tickets.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit more, I wasn\u2019t very clear about the French connection, this man\nwho you said was a minister under de Gaulle and had spent time in Dachau. Was your contact\nwith him after the war, or during the war?",
        "A: No, it was mostly after the war, because during the war he actually was the mayor of this\ntown in southern France, the middle of France, and he printed, you know, identification paper --\n1-identity papers and so on, and -- and saved, actually saved them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But he was captured fe -- I forgot what it was, but I think it was fairly early.",
        "Q: I see, I see. Is there anything else from your notes that you would like to --",
        "A: No, as far as I know, let me see.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: To -- a -- a -- I remember -- J-I recall that it -- the priest came in \u201968 --",

        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: And I will just talk about the photocopy with -- with our archivists, of how this could be\npreserved, how this could come in as a donation. I will -- we will see --",
        "A: But in the lectures I -- when I speak about this --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

And\nthere was a parish house here, and then next to it, exactly next to it, the same wall, there was a\nbig hotel before the war, which was occupied by the German Gestapo and various German\nservices in that town. So we had a wall, and when I was sitting with the wall, I could hear the\nGerman officers on the outside. And then that priest, you know, slowly -- I -- I -- I suppose he\nwas in touch -- no, later on he was in touch with the various Jewish idi -- organization. But we\nhad as many as 20 boys in that house, you see, and on the first floor was a sort of a big room\nwith a theater and so on, where the boys could at least take some exercise. And then, on the top\nthere were his office and so on. And the boys actually lived in that house, you see, for -- they\ncould not go out, right? And -- and that\u2019s the reason why he got in touch with me, because we\nwanted to, you know, on Sunday -- on Saturdays and Sundays, well mostly on Sundays, I\nsuppose, we gathered, you know, neighborhood boys and so on, right, and then the Jewish\nchildren joined them and so -- so they could get some exercise and fresh air.",
        "A: To the parish, or to the --",
        "A: I shou -- in Namur, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was a parish house for certain functions, I suppose the parish functions.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, the children, I could not say, I would say about seven -- the -- we -- as far as I recall, we\nhave no small children and so on, they were all, you know, beginning teenagers and so on.",
        "A: And no more than 12, I would say.",
        "A: But then of course, they change. You see, there was --",
        "A: -- a rotation. I -- I don\u2019t know, I -- yeah.",
        "A: My involvement was pure, not charity. I was -- as I told you, I was immature, I didn\u2019t know\nwhat I was doing. I was very happy to do it. I had a great, not love, but I mean I liked the boys, I\nseem to remember some of them. So -- and -- but my function, what I actually did was simply to\ntake them out with other friends.",
        "A: So I --",
        "A: -- to -- yeah, yeah, and exercise and play ball, and that sort of thing and so on. But -- and then,\nyou see that -- so, we had the Gestapo next door --",
        "A: -- right? And then, on the first floor, and then there was a roof, you see, on --",
        "A: -- on the top of the house, without any heating, with mattresses on the floor. And at times I\nsaw with my own eyes there\u2019s something -- sometime 15 children and so on. A-And mostly --\nmost of them, if I am correct, I don\u2019t -- came from Poland and Vienna.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, of course the -- they knew su -- I don\u2019t know -- know, really. Communication was\nrather poor in the sense -- because most of them had language problems, right, and actually the\npriest, after the -- after the -- I mean the liberation of the country, created si -- courses in -- in\nHebrew for -- for the boys. And the most important part of my testimony as far as I\u2019m concerned,\nthat I believe, I don\u2019t know that, but -- I don\u2019t know how many, but certainly perhaps a thousand\nboys, over the years, you know, went through that system.",
        "A: No, no, no, no --",
        "A: -- they were -- they just were --",
        "A: -- they were sheltered there, they found a shelter. But you have to realize th-th-the that e-\nextraordinary, absolutely extraordinary to keep boys --",
        "A: -- and I never witness any -- you know, any lack of discipline or anything there. The boys,\nmost of them were so conscious of their situation and -- and so disciplined and so on. But I want\n-- I wanted to say two things. The first thing is that as far as I know, only one boy who I changed\nhis fate, you know, so [indecipherable] it was part of the system to protect the Jewish -- and also\nperhaps even more than the Jewish aspect, the -- the authority of the parents. And that was very\nbeautiful, I never forgot that. Well, that\u2019s one thing, and the second thing again, as far as I know,\nnot one boy was caught and so he saved them, really save --",
        "A: They did not.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Th-Then one day, a father of one of our boys was shot to --",
        "A: For a day and night. Cause that\u2019s what I said, the Germans also heard, you see, voices, and I-I\n-- | -- [never understood how he could maintain, you know, that th -- type of discipline\nnecessary for their safety, for their protection.",
        "A: And in addition --",
        "A: -- there was, of course, an enormous problem of feeding them. You see, every citizen received\ncoupons or stamps and so on, and so we had to find food and nourishment for those boys. And --\nand we ha -- had not only to prepare the meal, and then but al-also to feed them, and to avoid\nnoises and so on. And quite frankly, I never understood how it was achieved, and sin -- and so\non, because it --",
        "A: No, no, yeah, I-I myself only came, only on Sundays and Saturdays, so I -- I was not an\noutsider, but I was not involved in the actually daily routine of the -- of the shelter. And so 1 --\nyou have to -- also to understand that there was a network around that place, you see, providing\nfood, nourishment and so on. There was an er -- a truly heroic nurse who was heading sort of an\noffice -- sort of Red Cross offices, where the boys were treated and so on. Bu -- and all that was\nin -- achieving sec -- complete secrecy and so on. And that person, after having given herself to\nthat work for three year -- three years, on the very last day, a few days before the liberation, she\ngot -- she was killed in a bombing, and so on -- o-on the spot and her body was thrown on the\nwall [indecipherable]. And it was a truly -- I mean, extraordinary person, extra -- a nurse\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: No, her name I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I forgot, because you know I -- all these sad experiences has been extremely deep, I mean\n[indecipherable] really attached, but I did not follow it through. For -- for instance, if you had\ninformed me that -- this interview, I would have gone to talk to people [indecipherable] but th --",
        "A: -- no, it -- it\u2019s not important, no.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Yes, of course, of course, there were a -- a number of -- why, as a matter of fact, I -- very\nrecently I got in touch with a -- who is now al -- a priest also, but he was a boy at the time of\nthose events, and he had known that Joseph Andre -- now the name comes --",
        "A: The priest, the name --",
        "A: -- of the priest.",
        "A: So I -- I was saying yes, I -- I know that yeah, tha -- h-he was a boy at the time and that priest\ncame to his fath -- his parents had a little farm or something --",
        "A: -- and so they got supply, I mean the -- the shelter got supplies from them, and so --",
        "A: You didn\u2019t understand, no? No, I just met recently --",
        "A: -- the priest, who was younger than me, and when he was a child, his parents supplied\npotatoes and eggs and so on and so --",
        "A: Bu-But the main -- th-the one who worked most with the -- the priest and myself, died\nrecently. So should I continue?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: So, if you want, I-I could tell you how this extraordinary experience ended, so -- becau -- ah\nyes, I was telling you that the father of one of our boys was shot by the Gestapo on the street, and\nthen, that moment I was called by phone, and I really risked my existence on that date, because\nof course the shelter, it was at the back of the house in -- in the cellar, down cellar --",
        "A: -- they had a door hidden by a piece of furniture and so on, and there -- so there was an escape\non -- on another street.",
        "A: You see, on the other side. And so all the boys escaped, and I took charge of a group of five\nor six, with the Gestapo [indecipherable] but I-I was not aware that -- I -- I was -- it was not an\nheroic action, it was just a purely human, but 1n fact, 1t was.",
        "A: Because -- and then the priest fled, disappeared. Hi-His brother was arrested, he was\n[indecipherable] and so on, and other people were -- are arrested, but none of the boys was\ncaptured.",
        "A: Ah yes, I -- at that time, yes.",
        "A: At that time, yes.",
        "A: It was close to the end of the war, yes, of course, and -- and then the boys were\n[indecipherable] and I went to a marvelous -- well, she was a nun with a very strong character\nand so on and she was in charge of an orphanage and so on. And so I took my boys to her and\nthat was the end as far as I was concerned, just to -- but then after that -- if -- should I continue?",
        "A: Yes, yes. So the priest fled, the boys were -- disappeared, none of them was captured, well --\nand in September, I think, the -- the place, or the town was liberated by the U.S. first army. And\nthen that was a beautiful memory I have because the Jewish chaplain of the American unit\ninvited me and the priest for the celebration of the Jewish New Year. I forgot the exact date, but I\ndon\u2019t know --",
        "A: It was in September, but I don\u2019t recall whether it was the first and so on.",
        "A: And after that I -- I jotned the American first army as a volunteer. I-I didn\u2019t accomplish\nanything. But then we crossed the Rhine, I think April first at Remagen, and then we raced\nthrough Germany -- not me, but the --",
        "A: -- Patton, and so on, and -- and so finally we -- we arrived in the vicinity of Weimar.",
        "A: Right? And then I wa -- I visited, must have been I don\u2019t know how many days, let\u2019s say 10,\nafter the liberation of the camp, of the -- Buchenwald.",
        "A: And there -- if you want I could talk to you about that experience, and --",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Why don\u2019t you ask them now?",
        "A: No? Would you now?",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, because then we -- first of all, we knew, since the boy were -- a-as far as I recall, you say\nthe fa -- the father of that boy was shot a few steps from the house, and so on. But you -- we\nknew that we were in danger, but how the alert was given, that I-I have no recollection of that. I\njust know that at a certain hour in the morning, I was called by a friend working with that priest\nand so on, that I had to come at once, and then I was put in charge of a group of boys.",
        "A: Who --",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I just know that this happened, and from that moment of course we were all in mortal danger\nbecause --",
        "A: -- a-and the house must have been watch and so on, and --",
        "A: But it ended in a very sudden way, that all the boys fled through the -- that escape door on the\nother si -- on another street, you see, on the other side of the building, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Normal, you know, boyish activities and so one, the --",
        "A: Walking, first of all. They were happy to be out, which was not given, you know, very\nfrequently. You must imagine what it is for a boy to be shut in a house and so on and then I\nsuppose we played ball and that sort of thing. It lasted a -- the outing lasted about four hours or\nsomething of that sort.",
        "A: In the afternoon.",
        "A: Of course, sure, sure.",
        "A: But they thought it was a church, normal church activity, you see, just --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: No, no, as far as I know, no.",
        "A: A-A-Anyway, I have no 1-idea.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, I mean, it was totally open and so on.",
        "A: It was a normal parish activity, and -- but I -- as I say, tha-that priest was extremely sensitive\nto any proselyting and so on, and as far as I recall, those who -- the boys who had placed 1n that\norphanage and so on, actually on Sundays [indecipherable] they went to church, but they were\ngiven instructions, you see to respect their own Jewish practices and liturgies. Although they\nphysically participated, they were warned by that nun, or by the priests themselves, not to do\nanything. And that, I think is a very beautiful part of the story.",
        "A: [indecipherable] that was very, very short, because he actually went into that house, you see,\nin \u00b041.",
        "A: And then I-I -- \u2019'm not clear, I do not know the -- the actually links he had with Jewish\norganizations. I don\u2019t even know their name, but th-they were very active, for instance, they\nsupplied food stamps, you see.",
        "A: And so I suppose that the boys came to that Jewish --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: A-Actually, it was February 1944. That\u2019s when the incident we recall --",
        "A: -- took place.",
        "A: That\u2019s it.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s my recollection, of course.",
        "A: In September.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the war lasted until May 8, 1945.",
        "A: Yes, I was, in Weimar.",
        "A: And then, I don\u2019t know how, I don -- I forgot how it took place, why it -- but it was a very\nshort period I told you, aba -- af-after the liberation of the camp. What I would like to supply,\nbecause you know the -- the good Germans were asked to surrender their cameras and so on to\nthe -- and so I got hold, I don\u2019t know how, of a -- a very small photo ca --",
        "A: Yeah. And so I took pictures, and those pictures I will -- I have to look for them, but I would\nlike to supply to you, because as far as I know, I\u2019m the only one who took the picture bec -- well,\nthat\u2019s a -- I -- I --",
        "A: No, I have to tell you the story, because --",
        "A: -- the first thing I -- we were greeted, the camp of Buchenwald was governed by Yugoslav\ncommunists. And so those communists were totally in control of the camp when we -- we came.\nAnd so when, I don\u2019t know how, I -- I won\u2019t call it a privilege, but yet it is something important\nfor me. I was taken by a team of those com -- so it\u2019s a first experience --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was first experience of communism, because th-there was such a contrast, you see,\nbetween those starving inmates and those, you know, powerful and -- Yugoslav communists. So\nanyway, I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know how I managed, perhaps because I could still already\nspeak some English, I don\u2019t know. But I got an extraordinary experience, because there -- the\nman who guided me [indecipherable] took me really at the -- at the center where they -- they\nwere exterminated. It was a barrack, right, and there was a little yard with a gallows, is that what\nyou call it, right? Where they could hang about 15 people at a time, that -- so the barrack -- the\nbarrack was here and then there was a doctor\u2019s office where the shot, you know, were given to\nthe inmates, and then there was a -- it\u2019s horrible -- a place where the bodies were just piled, and\nso on, and then the cremation oven was nearby. So that man took me there, and of course that\u2019s\nsomething [indecipherable] terrible, I mean not -- although, I mean I\u2019m more impressed by it\nnow than I was when I [indecipherable] Jews with that, you know, immature mentality I had.",
        "A: Because I said -- I proved it, I said, that Iam more moved now by what I experienced then,\nthan I was at the time. But I -- and -- and you have to -- 1-it was an extraordinary experience, this\n-- as far as I recall, that the oven were still used 1n the --",
        "A: E -- e -- a -- a -- th-that\u2019s if -- that the -- the memory I have, but I admit it might be wrong.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure about what my memory is. My feeling is that they were still used.",
        "A: Perhaps to dispose of -- because the people were still dying, you know, and -- and the good\nAmerican soldiers gave them chocolate and so on, which was -- it was totally uncontrolled at that\ntime. When I-I -- when I visited the camp where the [indecipherable] was --",
        "A: Because the American ri -- you know, rush -- you have no idea how fast it went. Patton, you\nknow, made a -- a breakthrough at Remagen, and so on, and in a matter of days we traveled\nhundreds of miles, and so on. And so there was no, as far as I\u2019m -- as I can say, no effective,\nprobably, medical -- Americans are very, very nice, very kind and so on, but it was something\ntotally uncontrolled. And so the -- the in -- the prisoners died, scores of them died\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] it was si -- oh yeah, and then I come to the point which I\nwanted to make. Wa -- I took a picture --",
        "A: -- which I still have, of that gallows. And I\u2019m not sure you have it, and so on --",
        "A: No, I tried -- I tried to -- it\u2019s a very poor first shot, you know what I\u2019m saying, but yet, I\nwould be very happy to -- to send it here --",
        "A: -- so it would not be lost, and so on.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I would be glad --",
        "A: -- because my children are simply -- know nothing about those things.",

        "A: No, of course not.",
        "A: One of the box cameras, you know, very -- the cheapest of the cheap. But yet, that picture\ncame out, and as far as I know, I hope [Il find it, but if I do find it, I -- P1l send it to you.",
        "A: [ll be very happy to do that -- to do so.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I was shocked. First of all, because I could not -- you see, it took me years,\nso to speak, to realize the -- the vastness of this operation and so on. It\u2019s not that I was not moved\nand so on, I was very sensitive, but -- but I was a real -- that I could testify, a real attachment to\nthe-- to the boys and admiration to the way, you know, they acted and so on. I remember a little\nPolish boy, I don\u2019t know how he did it, but he was reading phil-philosophical books, you know.\nHe was reading Rousseau and that sort of thing and yes --",
        "A: And then --",
        "A: But you have to know that that priest, Joseph Andre, after the war was asked to testify and so\non and to go to Israel, the -- the state of Israel was established if I am correct, in \u201948\n[indecipherable] is that what it is? So actually he went to -- to Israel, to Yad Vashem, you know,\nonly in September 1967.",
        "A: And that\u2019s whe-when he received that title, and planted a tree, and so on, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And actually Yad Vashem send me a couple of interviews and so on which I could send you -\n- to you. In French, unfortunately.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I -- that I could not tell, but the document will s -- will tell you.",
        "A: Will answer your question, but I too -- Yad Vashem send me two or three articles on Joseph\nAndre, after he received that title and so on, then he was received a -- you kn -- in Jerusalem, I\nthink.",
        "A: No, I -- that\u2019s another story which is very sad.",
        "A: Because after that, in \u201968, was the United Jewish Appeal had him come in America --",
        "A: -- and then there was a reunion of -- of the boys, it\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t know how they learned\nabout the reunion and that I missed, and I -- and that I don\u2019t forgive myself.",
        "A: But perhaps you -- you may have a few names [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, oh yes",
        "A: So you would have names, yes?",
        "A: No, tha-that\u2019s another mistake I made, why -- and actually it\u2019s only very recently, it\u2019s a few\nweeks ago, but I met that other priest who knew him.",
        "A: And if you had told me that you wanted to make that -- this interview, I would have been able",
        "A: -- to get more material, but -- but ac -- I-I -- what I never understood is that, you know, I --\nhow little Europeans, and the Belgians in particular did. Because, you know that priest? There\u2019s\nnot even one article of biography on him, nothing, although he is known 1-in America, and in\nIsrael, of course.",
        "A: There was no -- no official -- no -- no responsible ska -- written -- carefully written biography\nof him.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s a European. Old Europe, I suppose. And that\u2019s why I -- I mean, I always\ndreamt of a -- you know, of Holocaust, you know, becoming a sort of light. But there is\nsomething missing, there is a missing link and so on, and -- of course you -- you gather material\nand so on, but it never became the light you see, and -- and there there is an enormous amount of\nwork that should be done.",
        "A: No, in here --",
        "A: -- in everything, in the world in general.",
        "A: There I disagree with you because that\u2019s not enough. Because that sacrifice, you see, that\nshould not -- no longer, no -- I mean to -- to make the aura, you know. Knowing is something\nvery important.",
        "A: Why that -- to transform that sacrifice of a whole nation into a -- a hope, a light. You will\nagree?",
        "A: Especially for the Jewish youth, and so on. And -- and there I see that there is work to do, but\nI\u2019m too old to -- for doing.",
        "A: Three things. First of all, you have to connect right -- no, because for me, for me is -- 1s not at\nall -- is no longer -- is not something -- I\u2019m not centering on the horror of the thing. I see that as a\n-- a-a-as a hope, I mean the -- and recently I got to understand much better the universality of the\nJewish faith, if I may use that word. I don\u2019t whether I -- I hope I do not offend you, be-because\nthe thing is that the root of western culture, although it\u2019s called Judeo-Christian, wi -- ba -- th-the\nfirst root is the -- the col -- the vocation of Israel, for instance, that Shema and so on, for me it\u2019s\nan -- wi -- although I\u2019m a -- a ca -- believer Catholic [indecipherable] believer, there is -- for me\nit\u2019s absolutely fundamental. And I see it -- I would not say that in a Jewish way, but for me I-I\nsee the origin of my own Catholic faith here, right in that extraordinary history of Israel and so\non. No, wh-what I mean to say is that first of all there\u2019s still a tremendous amount of ignorance.\nWhy -- I don\u2019t see why, in every Catholic school, or in every public school there should not be a\n-- some -- a booklet or something, a very short, well written, educative information on the Jewish\ncustoms and so on and on the basic Jewish beliefs and so on. It could be done at a very little\nexpense. Why -- di -- that\u2019s one thing, and the second thing is that you know the west?",
        "A: Now, we underwent a cultural revolution, wi -- and now the values, the traditional values,\nwhich we call Judean-Christian values are now deconstructed and so on. And there there is a\ntremendous work to do. I\u2019m not negative, and I think that in that -- what I call that cultural\nrevolution, wi -- there is something which could be transformed into a positive [indecipherable]\nthe values of the western culture a-are changed. The change has been very negative and so on,\nbut it -- it\u2019s also, you see, very -- 1-1t could be transformed into a positive -- and there I see if the\nJewish -- if there could be a common formulation. Not that the Jews really should -- to express\nthat basic fundamental reality, the universality of the Jewish message and so on. But that should\nnot be done, you know, by grade, or I don\u2019t know, or books and so on. It should be done -- it\nshould come bottom up, you see? And that could be done. That -- that -- that could be done,\nbecause I\u2019m sure that, first of all that there would be a communion of -- of the jewi -- because I\nam -- been a teacher all my life, you see and I\u2019m oriented towards the -- the younger generation,\nI feel more at ease with -- but if that effort could come bottom up, wi -- through friendship, you\nknow, networking. Of course, there is an intellectual work which has to be done. And that means\neducational work. But the reality should be friendship, should be personal counters, and start,\nyou know, very low profile, not, you know, those big reunions. For instance, my daughter met\nDavid Rosen, Rabbi David Rosen, do you know him?",
        "A: No, but anyway, he\u2019s a very outstanding person, but you know, now he\u2019s totally identified\nwith those groups 1n [indecipherable] and go to Rome and so on, and you know they captured\nhim and so on, and that aspect of personal encounter, friendship, mutual understanding,\ncooperation where cooperation is possible, that 1s what is lacking, in my judgment.",
        "A: Number two? [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, number one is to formulate, if possible -- first of all to understand why the structural\nframework of that deconstruction, which has now been established --",
        "A: -- and which threatens the basic Jewish faith and tradition and questions and so on, as they do\nfor the Christian and so on. And so there is a commonality, because the origin of Christianity are\nJewish, right?",
        "A: Yes. And the basic -- my faith, the Catholic faith 1s based on the Bible, and -- which is Jewish\nexperience. So, in other word, number one is understanding of the -- of the structure --\nintellectual structure of a deconstruction wh-which si -- is contrary to the fundamental Jewish\ntradition which, insofar is 1t is common to the Christian origin. Right? Number two 1-15, if\npossible, try to be more interactive, or more intelligent in spreading basic knowledge, even for\nkids and so on.",
        "A: In schools, and so on, and of course at the upper level even more, of Judaism, right? And third\nis that fred -- friendship business.",
        "A: You know, [indecipherable]",
        "A: By internetworking, by --",
        "A: No.",

        "A: -- too bashful to push myself forward, that\u2019s about it, though. You know, they know about it,\nand --",
        "A: Because in addition to that experience with the priest, you know, I always thought about --",
        "A: -- I was connected with a -- though that was a very deep friendship and so on, and also with\nmy wife, of a French politician named Michelait I don\u2019t know whether you know his name.",
        "A: Anyway, he saved many, many Jews and so on, and he was a gr -- a great friend of mine, and\nhe became minister, he was a friend of de Gaulle. He went to Dachau and se -- and so on, but in\nDachau he -- he worked -- I mean, he did not work, but his association was more with the\ncommunists inmates than with the -- the Jewish people. But he saved, for instance, many Jewish\nfriends I -- I have who I met here in America, just -- so that experience is a little bit divided, but I\nwas a -- I wa -- never reluctant to speak about it and so on, it\u2019s because my role, first of all, what\nI could do, except in that exceptional situation where I really risked my life for them, but I never\nthought I was doing much and so on. It\u2019s only after the war, after the business Buchenwald that\nI-I realized the magnitude of the -- of the Holocaust.",

        "A: No, no, no, not the family, not the -- none of the family. The people around , for instance,\nthere -- you know, there was a -- a bakery and -- a bakery that supplied bread, you know, as a\n[indecipherable] and so on, and -- and that woman really was heroic, heroic. She was leaving\n[indecipherable] not very far from the center. And that sort of thing, a p-place to a-avoid the\nfamily, and so on.",

        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: And they were very effective, as proved, as I said, by the coupon -- or they probably printed\nthem, or I don\u2019t know, stole them, or --",
        "A: But we received whole sheets, you know, of -- of --",
        "A: Yeah, the ration tickets.",
