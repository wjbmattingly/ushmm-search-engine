It was very, a very active Jewish\ncommunity.",
        "Q: What kind of work did your father do at the time?",
        "A: My father worked for the city in the tax department until 1937 when he was dismissed by the\ngovernment because at that time anti-Semitism was at its peak and they dismissed all the\nJewish workers that worked for the city and at that time he got a job in a Zionist organization\nwhere he served sandwiches and you know, tended to the card room to organize the events\nthe Jewish organizations sponsored. He was in charge of those things, with my mother of\ncourse. They were working together. They had a kitchen over there and buffet tables, where\nthey you know, tended to buffet tables and so on.",

        "A: It was a happy life of a youngster. I started out in a Cheder and then I attended the Javne\nschool. It was a Jewish progressive school run under rabbinical supervision until the\nbeginning of the war. And I knew nothing of another world but a Jewish world.",

They were very, very nice. There was no talk against Jews. I used to\nvisit their houses. They used to come to my house and there was no problem.",
        "Q: When did you start seeing a problem, or feeling a problem?",
        "A: The problems started after Marshal Pilsudski died. He was the President of Poland.\nAfterwards anti-Semitism became stronger, much stronger and as a matter of fact when he\ndied the Polish anti-Semites used to run into the street and call to the Jews, your grandfather\ndied, because he was very good to the Jews, the Jewish people. And it was at a peak as I\nsaid, in 1937 came to a peak where antisemitism was very strong and I don't think that the\nGermans would have such a good time taking over Poland if not for this anti-Semitism that\nexisted at that time.",
        "Q: How did you see it? This was 1938? [1939]",
        "A: Yes, 1938. A week before the Germans came in, it was a chaos in town. It was terrible. The\nJewish people were really scared and they hired trucks and wagons and whatever they could\nget,\ntransportation to run towards the Russian border away from the German invasion. They,\nespecially men because it was a talk that the Germans when they come in right away they\ntake the men for slave labor and they massacre the Jewish populations on the way as they\ncome in. We heard stories from the German Jews that were pushed across the borders a\ncouple of years before that, terrible stories but nobody could visualize what really is\nhappening. Nobody believed it, the kind of stories they used to tell, how the Germans treated\nthe the Jewish population in Germany. And nobody can really understand what the Jewish\npeople went through unless they themselves went through the war, the holocaust. It's\nimpossible to understand, to to comprehend.",
        "Q: Martin, let's go back to what you were saying a moment ago, that nobody would believe the\nstories that they were being told by the Jews who were coming back into Poland at the time\nfrom Germany. What were some of the stories or what was the feeling that you and your\nparents were getting from these stories?",
        "A: Well there were stories of Jews being grabbed from the streets and from apartments for slave\nlabor. They were beaten in the streets, their belongings confiscated. Their houses being\nconfiscated, their properties being confiscated. And some of the people never come back\nfrom slave labor camps. They were telling stories about concentration camps. Nobody could\ncould comprehend what the concentration camp wer in those years, and as I said it's very\nhard to understand unless you yourself go through it, went through it.",
        "Q: You were going through it at the time and at that time, 1938,\n01:10\nyou were ten years of age.",
        "A: I was eleven.",
        "Q: Eleven years of age. (Yes) And from your memory of that time immediately before the war,\nimmediately before the Germans advanced into Tarnow, what do you remember of the\nexperience as you saw it?",
        "A: The day before the Germans came in was very quiet. I remember like today. The city was\nlike a holiday atmosphere. There was no movement except at night the stores were robbed,\nbroken into. the government warehouses where broken into. I even went during the day I\nwent to look how they carried, people carried out cartons with cigarettes and with all kinds\nof things from that warehouse. There was a fear 1n the air that you couldn't understand. Spies\nwere being caught. German spies were being caught, and daily air raids, bombing hospitals\neven. In our city a a bomb fell on a hospital and when the air raid sirens were sounding off\nwe yelled to my father, you know, let's go to the basement. He says, oh no, there's nothing\ngoing to happen, until the bomb hit the hospital and and he fell out of bed. Then he was\nrunning to the basement. And we lived near the military barracks where they were\nregistering the new recruits. And that day and night there was a very busy place and while\nwe were in the basement hiding, we heard someone upstairs 1n the lobby and our neighbor\nwas a fireman. He had a gun on him, and he went to look and he brought down a very scared\nperson, a man, and when he asked him what he was doing, in his state he said he was looking\nfor bullets for his gun, because he had also a gun on him. So they sat him down by\ncandlelight in the basement and the fireman you know, said to my father he says, look\nthrough his papers. And my father's hands were shaking and he was looking through his\npapers and if my father would have said he's a spy, the gun would have, you know, the\nfireman would have shot this man. But my father said he's alright. His papers are OK. And\nlater on he, my father told me, you know, I didn't even look at the papers. I was so scared I\ncouldn't see anything. (Laughter) So but they were catching spies, musicians that were going\nfrom courtyard to courtyard and they had maps and papers on on their bodies under their\nshirts. Some when the planes were coming over, German planes, bombers were coming over,\nthey caught a few that had radios on them talking to the pilots. I remember, you know, a lot a\nlot of people were being caught as spies, it was a chaos. A week before the Germans came in\na bomb, a time bomb went off at the railroad station, and one person got killed, a woman that\nwas in transit, a Jewish woman in transit, and I have her name written down. As a matter of\nfact, am working now with a with a lady that this was her aunt. Just happens that we were\ntalking about the situation in Poland at that time. She says you know, my aunt was killed by\na bomb in Tarnow at the beginning, before the Germans came in, in transit. I said I\nremember. Things, things come back into memories that when the Germans came in, on\nSeptember 8th, I was on a corner, standing on a corner on Main Street watching them\ncoming in the trucks. Truck by truck, and the German military police was standing directing\nthe traffic. And they all were asking directions to the main crossing point on the way to\nWarsaw. One road led to Lwow in the direction of the Russian border and one towards\nWarsaw. And I was standing over there watching the guards that were on each corner of\n01:16:\nthe street, and they had belts, belt buckles and it said, Got mit uns, so at that time as a kid I\nwas wondering what kind of God did they believe in. Which god. Cruel people, they didn't\nseem cruel. I, as a kid you know, I always admired military uniforms. They had beautiful\nuniforms. And had those two grenades under their belts, and standing guard over there with a\ngun. I, as a kid you know, you admire military people and I was fascinated by the military\nsplendor that they came in with, organized, motorized. It wasn't like this under the Polish\ngovernment. Polish government, I've seen soldiers come running back, retreating where they\nhad their shoes on their shoulders and barefooted running back. And this fascinated me. It\nwas a well motorized, organized army that came into Tarnow.",
        "Q: How long did it take after they first came into Tarnow before you and your family felt their\npresence?",
        "A: As soon as they came in, it didn't take long. It took a day or two where the horror begun,\nwhere they started searching and confiscating the Jewish properties. They took old people.\nEspecially they picked on Jews with beards, religious people, to take them out into the street\nand to clean the manure, horse manure from the street with their hands. They didn't give\nthem brooms, nothing. They were degraded to a point where even an animal doesn't do it and\nat that time we were seeing what those people that came from Germany were talking about.\nThere were people that were rounded up, young people in the streets for slave labor. They\nsend them to Plaszow - that's near Krakow. This was just a beginning. There were some of\nthem came back. They were telling stories about working conditions in those in those camps.\nPeople were really horrified because you never knew when you would be grabbed in the\nstreet. (By) the SS, the Wehrmacht didn't bother. The Wehrmacht went along with the SS,\nwhat the SS was telling them to do. They were of course helping; they had to help, but the\nGestapo and the SS were the main characters that came in to play that horrified the Jewish\npopulation and there was a day they picked Jews at random in the street and they tortured\nthem. They were cutting off their beards with knives and they were kicking them. My rabbi\nthat used to teach me for my bar mitzvah, they caught him with a tallis on a Saturday at his\nhome and they were kicking him around and I happened to come because this was the time\nfor my lesson. I just happened to be there when they were kicking him around and he saw\nme and he yelled out, he yelled out in Jewish he yelled out, run. As a matter of fact not in\nJewish but in Hebrew. Run, Moishele. As I turned around you know, they pushed\n01:21:\nhim down to the ground and then I heard a shot. And this was the end of Rabbi Brubel(?).",
        "Q: The thing you were talking about occurred shortly after the Germans .. .",
        "A: After they came in.",
        "Q: Where was your family at the time? Were you still living in your same apartment?",
        "A: The same apartment. Same year one day, this was in 1940, came a Volksdeutscher, it means\nhe was of a German descent, and we were ordered to get out of our apartment. And we had\nto leave everything behind and moved in with his family and my father and I had to sleep in\nmy mother's uncle's lumber yard because there was\nno place where to go. My mother and my sister, Uncle Farber took in and they lived in his\napartment. We, my father and I slept over there in the lumber yard for some time and then\nwe found a little apartment in a farm house overlooking the Jewish cemetery. This was\nUlitsa Spitalna, number 43. I still remember. And we lived over there until the first massacre,\nthe first deportation took place. After the deportation we had to move from there. But\nsomething happened during the time before the deportation. My father heard that it will be\nmore than the deportation and he built an attic in a woodshed. This was a little farmhouse\nwhere had woodsheds. You know, each apartment had the woodsheds. And we had, he built\na woodshed to, just in case of emergency we have to hide, because he didn't work and I\nworked at that time for a tailor, a very nice Jewish man that catered to German clientele,\nwhen they came to visit the military husbands or brothers or whatever. And he was very nice\nto me. I didn't know the trade but I used to help out and my father worked at the\n2? what they called it. There was a German firm; they were putting up structures\nfor high tension wires from the German border to the Russian border all along. It was very\nhard work but after the work in the area was finished, they dismissed all the workers and that\nmeant my father didn't have work. But everybody had to work at that time. Otherwise they\nwere in trouble. And one day it happened. Suddenly there was the day of deportation where\nthe Germans came in and from house to house searching, they, with a list. They were very\nwell organized. They always came with\n01:26:\na list with names. And they took mostly the old people that couldn't work, people that were\nwearing glasses, that were undesirables. People that had anything, like a limp or had\nsomething wrong with the eyes. Right away they were the candidates for the transport and as\nsoon as we heard that the Germans, what the Germans are doing, before they came our way,\nmy father and I went into the attic and my mother had her birth certificate, and that's how she\ncould protect my sister, because she was a little kid, she was ten years old, eleven years old.\nSo she thought she would be safe with, as an American citizen. And she also had her\nAusweis, the ID card issued by the Germans as an American and we heard the columns of\nJews under the German escort at night. It was going constantly. They were passing our house\nbecause this was already on the outskirts of the city, the cemetery, and they were marching\nthem to the woods behind the city. And as we found out later they were all shot over there.\nDuring the day I looked out through the shingles. My father said I shouldn't look but anyway\nI was a kid. I was curious and the roof was overlooking the cemetery and wagons with\nbodies dead bodies, were coming in. Groups, they were bringing in groups of Jewish people\nthat had to dig ditches and the bodies dumped in and after those Jews that dug the ditches,\nthey were shot also and pushed by another group that came in after them into those ditches\nand lime was poured over over the bodies and the next group covered up those ditches and\ndug\n01:28:\nother ditches. They brought in, they brought in pregnant women, and they didn't use any\nbullets. They used bayonets. The screams of the mothers that their children, they they hold\nthe children under their arms and the screams of the children I still hear. Little infants. The\nGermans took pleasure, the SS took pleasure in taking little infants and smashing their heads\nagainst the tombstones or the cemetery wall. Little babies - they made a game out of it. One\ngrabbed one leg and one the other leg and they tore the babies apart. I'm sorry.",
        "Q: That's fine my friend. Have a little drink of water and just take your time.",
        "A: No matter how many times I speak about it, I have the same reaction.",
        "Q: I can understand that.",
        "A: My father swore to me I shouldn't speak about it. Nobody will believe me. They will say\nthat, that I made it up . . .He was partially right; even our Jewish people said it really\nhappened (7?)\n... 1 don't understand. How can anyone make up a story like that? At that time when I hid\nwith my father in that attic, we heard, it was during the day, we heard my sister scream,\ncalling my mother. It happened that a German soldier came 1n and was looking you know,\nfor Jews, and my mother showed the birth certificate and had an ID card and he left. It took a\nfew days till the whole thing subsided but as I understand from people that survived, the\ngathering places was the main market place, , In the center of Tarnow, was jammed\nwith people that were either killed on the spot or taken to the railroad station and transported\nto Belsec concentration camp. And actually it was, and that camp nobody came from Belsec,\nout of Belsec. When it was over my mother sent my sister because she was little and she\nfigured nobody was going to bother her in the street, to see 1f anybody from the relatives is\nstill alive, and she had an old aunt living in that market place with two daughters and this\naunt was already 90 years old. So when my sister came up there, they told her that they didn't\nbother to kill her on the spot, this old woman. They took her by the legs and arms and threw\nher from the second floor down on to the wagon with the dead bodies, alive. And it was\nMala Lubash (ph) and her sister Golda Reich, with her husband, the old Tante Lubash they\nkilled. That was the first deportation and massacre in Tarnow of the Jewish people. At that\ntime 12,000 people died because before they massacred, they ordered all the Jews from\nsurrounding areas, from smaller areas, to move in to Tarnow. No Jews were allowed to live\nin the villages and the farm areas. They had to live in Tarnow. So the population swelled you\nknow and they had a better a better easier way of killing the Jews that way.",
        "Q: While the activities were taking place, were the Jewish residents living in what could be\ndescribed as a ghetto at that time, or did that come later?",
        "A: The ghetto was formed after the first action was taken, after the first deportation. I'll tell you\nabout my father why I skipped it. I wanted to tell a story about my father on the first day of\nthe deportation, across the yard, across the courtyard lived a Jewish policeman and when my\nfather heard, you know, he went to ask him advice, his advice what to do. And while he was\nin his house, the Gestapo people came into the courtyard and when they saw him coming out\nfrom Mr. Gelb's house, my father didn't have any papers on him. It was all destiny. It didn't\ntake much just for the Gestapo man to ask my father, Ausweis, papers. This this would have\nbeen the end of him. But they didn't ask. My father was so weak, so scared, that he braced\nhimself against the wall and his knees started to buckle and the Gestapo man says, said to my\nfather, are you sick? My father said nein. Are you besoffen? Are you are you drunk? He said\nnein. Where do you live? So my father pointed to the house next door and he says, Zurueck\nnach Hause. Go back home. So one of them couldn't take it because this was a\nhigher ranking officer told my father to go back home. He run after my father and give him a\nkick in the behind you know and my father fell into the house. But as I said, the whole war\nthat we lived through was destiny. Each one who has any family saved the others' lives\nwhich I will - so the first was my mother, because she saved us because she was an\nAmerican citizen.",
        "Q: Let's hear a little about that. Just prior to the war, your mother made efforts to obtain visas\nfor you.",
        "A: Yes, in 19... in 1938 my mother wrote to the American Consulate in Warsaw and they said\nthat they're going to issue her a visa if she will come to Warsaw Consulate and sign papers\ntestifying that she never voted in the Polish elections. And she procrastinated. She was busy\nwith this and that. She never thought of going to Warsaw until 1939 when there was talk\nabout the war. And the American Consulate at the Embassy said that she should come\nimmediately because they are evacuating all the American citizens and she should come to\nregister. And she still procrastinated. So they said you can go back to United States but your\nfamily has to stay behind because we can't issue visas anymore for your family. And she\ndidn't want to go by herself. She said if they have to stay, I will stay with my family. That's\nhow she got stuck as an American citizen. And the American Consulate, the American\nEmbassy ignored her. They just left her to fend for herself as a Jewess.",
        "Q: Difficult.",
        "A: They were difficult years. Difficult years.",
        "Q: Just after the deportation, as you were describing it before, where were you and what\nhappened to you?",
        "A: The Germans made the Jewish quarters smaller. They tightened the area for the Jews, made\nit smaller. The part where we lived on the little farm house was out of the Jewish area, so we\nhad to move in into a smaller.... , well, this was a ghetto without walls. And at that time we\nhad to, my father and I had to go back to the lumber yard to sleep. My mother went with my\nsister to the Farber's to live, to her uncle, and a short time later they found room for my father\nand myself also and we slept ten people in one room because the Farbers had their son and\ntheir relatives come from other cities to live with them. At that time they thought that\nTarnow is, will be safer and they wanted to stay with the family. So there were ten people in\none room sleeping on the\n01:44:\nfloor. And it didn't take long till the second deportation started. And we heard about the date\nbecause the Germans said the Jews should be ready for a transport on this and this date, and\nUncle Farber in his lumber yard dug two ditches underneath the floorboards of the lumber\nyard. One for his family and one for his immediate relatives. I thought that we are included\nso my father said as soon as he heard about the deportation, he says let's go. This was the day\nbefore the actual date, and went to hiding in the lumber yard. When the action began it was\ntoo late already for the Farber family to get there because the Germans were rounding up the\nJews already and they couldn't go through the streets, so you know Uncle Farber and his two\ndaughters climbed up on the roof of the building and there was a big chimney like the\nEuropean buildings have, those wide chimneys, hid behind the chimney and it didn't take\nlong. The Germans were rounding up the Jews in this building and one of the neighbors,\ndownstairs neighbors, pointed out to the chimneys to the Germans Uncle Farber with his two\ndaughters, and that's how he was killed and my family hid under the floorboards. And we\nheard shooting for about four days because this lumber yard was situated also on the market\nplace. Tarnow had about four market places and this was a gathering place for farmers and\nyou know, when they came to, before the war, to the to the market place to sell their goods.\nWe were flat, prostrate on our backs under the floorboards. It was dark. We didn't know\nwhen is day, when was night, and all we heard was yelling and screaming and the German\nshepherd dogs barking outside. This was another thing, a miracle that the German shepherds\ndidn't sniff us out. During the the massacre, during the action, there were Polish young\npeople who helped the Germans kill Jews. There was the Legion, the Polish Legion they\ncalled themselves. And two of them came into the lumber yard and they were standing right\nabove us urinating and one said to the other, oh, if I catch a Jew, I won't give him over to the\nto the Germans. I will cut off his head with my axe. And this was the attitude of the anti-\nSemites in in Poland at that time. They were even helping the Germans kill the Jews. And\nwhen it was over we came out smelling like roses. We were covered with feces and dirt. We\nlooked at each other and started laughing. But during the deportations my mother was so\nscared underneath the floorboards that she was hallucinating and we had to slap her face. She\nsaw a Gestapo man. It was dark. It was pitch dark. She was hallucinating. She saw a Gestapo\nman with that with a briefcase standing. Where? Slapped her face to keep her quiet. Really -\nif someone had a bad heart this was the end of the person. Could never live through if\nsomeone was weak. You had to be a really super strong to - all the people that survived the\nwar were people that were strong, strong people. Otherwise you couldn't survive.",
        "Q: For four days you stayed under the boards?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why did you emerge? What....",
        "A: When it was quiet. It was quiet. And...",
        "Q: What did you see when you came out?",
        "A: When we came out we went back to the house, to the Farber's house, and nobody talked.\nEverybody kept to himself. It was like someone died in the family. Actually they did. But\nnobody talked about it and each one of us went back to their own chores. After each\ndeportation the Germans, they (re)organized the factories, re-registered the people. The\nfactory that I worked with my mother was called Madritsch (ph). This was a German firm,\nactually Austrian, an Austrian firm that used to make military coats. and I used to work in\nthe pressers room where I used to wring out the rags for the pressers. I used to come home\nwith blisters on my hands. I couldn't move them. All day, you know, have my hands in water\nand and wringing out rags and then after the pressers got through with pressing the coats,\nthey loaded coats on my shoulder and I used to carry the coats to the to the other side of the\nbuilding where they were sewing on the buttons on the coats. That's where my mother\nworked, and as I said, after each deportation they re-registered and the ghetto was getting\nsmaller. Each time they were making the ghetto smaller. The ghetto after the second\ndeportation, they split the ghetto in two. There was Ghetto A and Ghetto B. Ghetto A was for\nthe slaveworkers and Ghetto B was for people who didn't work - for the old people and for\nchildren. And then after the deportation when they were re-registering - let me, let me go\nback a little bit - I want to make a point of something. When I was carrying the coats there\nwas a group of women, the wives of the managers, German managers and the owners of the\nfirm came for an inspection of the factory, to Tarnow. And when one woman saw me\ncarrying the coats, she says, oh what a pity - that little boy with a load like this on his\nshoulders. Soon after I was called to the office. I said to myself, oh, this is the end. So when I\ncame to the office, there was the owner of the factory, the Austrian, standing there with a\nsmile, and he says to me, how do you like to work over here? I said, it's alright. He says, how\nis your health? I said fine. It seems like his wife said something about me. He says, then he\nsays to me, if you need anything, come to me and tell me. And this manager, the Jewish\nmanager Mr. Weinstock, who managed the factory, was getting fidgety and he excused me\nby saying that I have to back to work and shoved me out of the door. This Mr. Madritsch I'll\nnever forget because this Mr. Madritsch after the war, wrote a book, how he saved 500 Jews\nin Tarnow by creating a factory. He did it with a purpose, and he wrote a book and they put\nup a tree in his name in Yad vaShem. (Very interesting.) He had a partner, Mr. Titsch (ph),\nwho also was honored by Yad vaShem, and I want to make a point that after the deportation\nwhen they were re-registering the Jewish people, I went over to the table, to the Gestapo\ntable that was standing in the middle of the market place, and you know, there was a line of\npeople. I came to the table and they put my name down. And then Mr. Weinstock was\nstanding over there and he didn't want to register my mother. I was very desperate. I looked\naround and I said, why not. He said we don't need so many people. I looked around and I\nsaw Mr. Titsch standing talking to an SS officer. I went over. I was a little kid. I had no fear\nbecause I knew that they liked me, you know, this Mr. Madritsch liked me and he was there\nwith the with a group inspecting the factory at that time. I went over and I said, they\nregistered me, but they don't want to register my mother, in my in my broken German. He\nlooked at me with a smile. He took me by the shoulder and led me to the table and he said to\nthe SS man, he said put his mother's name down.",
        "Q: An incredible story. And Martin perhaps a good place for us to end this part of our\ndiscussion so that we can get ourselves ready for the next. Thanks.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Martin, we were talking about the transportations, and you mentioned you had something\nvery important to add.",
        "A: One morning I got up early before all the others. I looked around the room. There were ten\npeople on the floor sleeping and as I was dressing I looked out of the window that was\nleading outside the ghetto and I see trucks, German trucks with soldiers, a whole column\ngoing towards the ghetto gate and as they were riding down towards the gate they were\ndropping off Polish policemen across the street to stand guard watching the ghetto. I knew\nright away what's going to happen. This was the third deportation taking place and right\naway I screamed out an alarm - the Germans are coming. And everybody got up and they\nstarted running in every direction. People didn't know what what to do. They were not\nprepared for it. And my parents and my sister started running towards that hiding place again\nin the lumber yard. We couldn't get there because the we realized when we were in the street\nalready that the gate that the German trucks were coming in to where it was in our way,\nbetween the hiding place, the lumber yard and us. And we couldn't get through. So we turned\naround and my father told us to get in to the first building that was on our way, as we were\nretreating, and it was a big courtyard, an old house where you come into the house and there\nis a big door, a wooden door and then a big courtyard and there was a complete chaos 1n that\ncourtyard. People were running, screaming names Chaim, Moishe. And they had a big ladder\nagainst a wall of a building and there was an opening in the wall, high up, and they were\nclimbing the ladder to that hiding place. How many people can go into that - there were\nabout a few dozen people running around like chickens. My sister, she was a little girl,\nturned around on her on her heel, comes back running into the street with her pigtails flying -\nshe says, I am not going 1n there. And she started running towards our house. And without a\nword we followed her. As we were on our way back to our house, we heard the Germans\nmarching in the streets behind us because they had those hobnails on the boots and we were\nrunning back as fast as possible and on the way my mother said, you know, I heard about a\nhiding place that a man was building in his apartment. Let's go over there. So it was on the\nfirst floor where we used to live in our in our house where the Farbers lived, and at the end\nof the balcony because the the courtyard had a balcony all around, a wooden balcony, so at\nthe end of the balcony there was an apartment and we came over there and there was a\npadlock on the door. My father turns around to me. He says go back to the apartment and get\nthe axe. I run first to the apartment and brought the axe and my father ripped off the padlock\nand we heard already Germans entering the building downstairs. We came to the apartment.\nWas quiet. Nobody was there. So my mother called out - we are Spetts. Please let us in. I\nknow that there is a hiding place over here. And nobody answered. So my mother\nthreatened. She said, if I don't hear from you we're going to move the furniture around. We're\ngoing to look for the hiding place. Finally from under the bed, a voice came from under the\nbed. They said bend down, crawl under the bed. There 1s an opening. And we all did. There\nwas aa panel. The the door from another room - the frame was taken out and blocked off.\nYou wouldn't even know that there was another room behind that wall. We crawled into\nanother room where there were about eight people there. And the owner of the apartment\ntold us that his two daughters went to work early that morning and locked the apartment with\na padlock and they didn't have any food. We stayed over there for almost a week. That's how\nlong the deportation took. But they had a pail over there for doing the business and they\nshared food with us. Very nice people. The daughters never made it back. It seems later on\nthat they were grabbed in the street and put on a train and while they jumped out through that\ncattle car opening - from a window - they were shot, both of them. They never made it... .",
        "Q: And you and your family stayed in this shelter for a week?",
        "A: In this shelter for a week and while - a few minutes after we were there 1n that hiding place,\nwe heard German voices. And one German said to the other, Wir waren schon hier, we were\nhere already. We were here already. Because they saw the lock broken, so we saved, we\nsaved the place from being searched.",
        "Q: You were speaking before about destiny.",
        "A: Yes. I still say life, each person's life has its destiny. I believe strongly in that. And no matter\nwhat you do, how you think, how you plan, it doesn't help. It's your destiny that rules the life.",
        "Q: And when you came out after that week in that...\n02:09:",
        "A: After that week this was third deportation and we struggled in the ghetto. Were terrible\nsanitary conditions, hunger. After the deportation there was talk about doing away with the\nsecond ghetto where people who didn't work and the old people. One night I hoisted my\nmother over the wooden fence. We found a corner of the fence that wasn't patrolled. It was a\ndark place, and I hoisted my mother over and then I climbed over because my father was\nthere with my sister in that ghetto. And I gave my father my number with the Madritsch\nname on it and my sister and myself were packed into wicker luggage trunk, locked in and\nmy mother called two strong fellows in the morning and she said, be careful with my china.\nIt's very precious. And they were complaining how heavy it is. When they put it on a dolly\nand and they came to the gate to take it to the other ghetto, to the working ghetto, and the\nJewish policemen were giving them trouble - started asking questions: why do you need\nchina? What are you going to do with china? My mother said this is my my only possession\nand finally they let us through, and the trunk was thrown into a basement where my sister\nand I came out later on. And my sister went into hiding you know, out of sight. That's how\nwe had to live. My father didn't work also and food was very scarce. There was no\nmedication. the Gestapo used to come and they used to grab people, shoot people in the\nstreet and it was a horror. Finally, excuse me, finally in May of 1943, the Gestapo was\nasking the Jewish leaders if they know about any foreigners like American, British citizens\nthat are still in the ghetto and the Gestapo men you know, sent fliers - whatever you call it -\nand my mother was very apprehensive because in the beginning when the Germans came in,\nthey took eighty British citizens and they shot them behind the city. And at that time my\nfather buried the my mother's birth certificate in a wall because they were afraid, you know,\nfor my mother to be recognized as an American citizen. And but when the war, we started\nmoving from ghetto to ghetto, he took the birth certificate out you know when they started\nmoving us around. My mother kept the birth certificate with her and that's what saved her.\nOn the 10th of May, 1943, a Gestapo man was sitting in the office of the Jewish police\nstation and registering a family that came before us. A man by the name of Sam,... Sam\nBloomenstock who received a postal card from his father in New York, and in that postal\ncard the father mentioned that he applied for him and for his mother for a visa. With that\npostal card, he presented this postal card to the Gestapo man. And the Gestapo man accepted\nit. Not only that he saved his mother and himself, but he took along his girlfriend and he\npresented her as his wife and he registered her too. And he lived through the concentration\ncamp and with us together and was liberated and he 1s now in Brooklyn, a businessman in\nBrooklyn.",
        "Q: Amazing. Let's go back to...",
        "A: Yeah, to the registration. When my mother came in she faced the Gestapo man. He, the\nGestapo man asked her if she has a husband and children. And my mother was afraid to say -\nshe didn't know what to say. My father and my sister and I were standing outside waiting.\nWe didn't know what to expect. And the head of the Jewish community was standing by the\ntable and he said - he knew us - and he said of course you have a husband and children. The\nGestapo man said where are they. So she points outside the window and he told us to come\nin and he registered us and he told us to be ready tomorrow morning. One suitcase for each\nperson and we would be exchanged for German prisoners. That's our destination. The next\nmorning, on May 11th, 1943, on my father's birthday, we were, we boarded a wagon with a\nhorse and they took us to the railroad station. Passenger train took us to Krakow railroad\nstation there, and we had to wait for a while over there and we told we will send out postal\ncards to people that we know. One we sent to ghetto where we knew that it's not going to\narrive but we tried - that we arrived in Krakow. One we sent, we addressed to Basel,\nSwitzerland where my mother had an aunt by the name of Miller, Tante Miller, and she\nalways, my mother always drummed the address into our heads just in case we will be\nseparated during the war that after the war we should meet over there. Eight Rue des Bains\n(ph) in Basel and, but they never received mail. Shortly under German escort they marched\nus through the streets of Krakau into the prison, political prison, Monteluppe (ph) where we\nspent nine weeks, men separated from women. We didn't know of each other's fate. We came\nto the cell and there were straw sacks burlap burlap bags with straw as mattresses, for\nmattresses. There was a table, a wooden table and two benches and a niche in the cell for a\nbucket for sanitary conditions. The windows were facing the courtyard and they had a metal\ncover wider at the top so the sun can come in and on the bottom was narrower with holes on\nthe bottom for drainage, water drainage. And a few days later they brought in more prisoners\nto our cell, also Jews from Lwow and surrounding areas. As we found out they had false\npapers, foreign papers. They paid for those papers and the Germans registered them as as\nforeigners. We were about ten people in the cell and on the way to the showers one day in\nthe basement we met Jews that were prisoners of that prison there, political prison - Jews\nwere considered - as Jews they were not political. They were considered lower than animals.\nThey were\n02:21:\nnot even human because they were not human beings. But they told us on passing - they\nwere coming out from the showers and we were going in and we looked at each other and\nthey had pieces of noses missing, pieces of ears that were all scratched and bitten, so one of\nthem said that when they are being punished, they are being thrown into cells with mad dogs,\nGerman shepherds, and that's what happens you know, when the German shepherds attack.\nDuring the day we saw exercises in the courtyard where they were exercising the prisoners,\nJewish prisoners, and they were beating them and torturing them with sticks. They were\nbeing hit in the Adam's apple while they were running around in circles or they told them to\nclimb up a pile of coal on their elbows and and and their knees, up the pile and as they were\nsliding down they were hit over the backs with a boards, two by twos. It was terrible. One\nday we were very hungry. We ate ate anything that was given to us. One day we heard\nsomebody by the door and we had to line up for food and the door opens up. We are standing\nalready ready to get food and there was a SS man, SS officer with his shining boots and\ngloves in his hand, and he seemed like a little drunk. And he says, \"Also Juden Spruch\". He\nsays Spruch (saying). We didn't know what he means. So everybody kept quiet. So he keeps\nyelling again, Spruch. And with that he hits the first man in the row, which was\nBloomenstock, right in the face. He says I'm going to teach you what Spruch means. And he\ngoes like this. \"wir Juden sind schuldig an allElend wenn das kosbare Deutsches Blut fliesst,\nwir Juden sind Gauner, wir Juden sind Verbrecher.\u201d",
        "Q: Which means?",
        "A: Which means, we Jews are guilty when dear blood that 1s spilt - German blood that is spilt -\nJews are Gauner, I don't know how to translate it - it's it's like a thief you know [actually\nmeans criminal ]- a Verbrecher means a murderer [also means criminal]- we were the\nmurderers. And I will be back in one hour and we'll have to know the \"Spruch\" and with that\nhe closed the door. And we were sure he's going to come back and everybody - I didn't, I\nnever heard, I never saw people learning so fast the language - in one hour (laughter). And I\nstill remember. (laughter). So he never showed up. And I still know the \"Spruch\".",
        "Q: And you stayed there for nine weeks?",
        "A: For nine weeks. After nine weeks they took us out from the cell into the courtyard and were\nreunited with the women, with my mother, my sister and the others and the Germans told us\nto face the wall. And while we were standing with our faces to the wall, they were loading\nand reloading the guns. It seemed like they were trying to scare us because a few minutes\nlater, a few minutes - it was like a half an hour later two trucks came and a German officer\ncame over. It was Wehrmacht, the regular Army and he told us that we are being taken to be\nexchanged, to the exchange station where they will exchange the German prisoners and we\nwere being loaded on the trucks and taken to the railroad station. Pullman cars and while the\ntrain was in motion - we were going towards Germany and this officer came with official\npapers and he was taking down the information - how much property each one of us left in\nPoland - the same amount in monetary, in money will be given to us when we will be\nexchanged either to England or to United States in their monetary value. And he told us to\nsign the papers. The train arrived on the Berlin station and the Red Cross was waiting for us\nwith milk for the children and all kinds of goodies - chocolate and so on - bread and the Red\nCross knew about us. We were the Auslaender, the foreigners. Everybody was nice to us on\nthe Berlin station. At Berlin station they attached another train to our train that came from\nLwow in Poland with other group of Jews. And we were on our way. Two hours out of the\nBerlin station the train stopped in an open field. And we saw the SS surrounding the train\nwith dogs and they came on the train and they started yelling for us to get out and hitting us\nwith their guns. We turned to the commandant, to the German officer that said that we're\ngoing to be exchanged - wanted to know what is the story. He says I don't know myself. He\nsaid this end of line for me. They told me to go back. And we're being thrown out, out of the\ntrain and lined up and as they were passing by, the the SS men passing by, one says in\nGerman to the other soldier, he says oh, \"ein Maschinengewehr ist genug.\u201d One machine gun\nis enough for them. So we knew, we thought we knew what what was waiting for us, and\nafter a while trucks came backing up and they loaded us on the trucks and they put down the\nflaps you know in the back so we wouldn't see where we're going but through the opening\nwe saw we are going through a forest and my father took us around and he started praying.\nAfter a while we arrived at a camp. We saw barbed wires, pine trees all around. Smelled\nbeautifully because the barracks in that camp was freshly built. The wood the wood of the\nbarracks still smelled fresh. It was in the summer of 1943 and they unloaded us on the main\nroad in the camp where we saw across the road British and Russian prisoners still finishing\nthe barracks. It seems like they took the prisoners of war for the work for building the\nbarracks. We found out we were in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. It seems like we are\nthe first ones to open up the camp and while we were standing over there waiting something\nto happen, something happened to me. All of a sudden I lost my strength in my legs . . My\nlegs started giving and I feel I didn\"t have the strength to standon my legs. So my mother\nstarted crying. There was a nice young strong man in our group. He picked me up and he\nwas holding me in his arms until the Germans came and they were leading us away into a\nbarrack. They assigned us a barrack and they put me on a bunk and they called a German\ndoctor, a German military doctor. He came and he diagnosed it as Rose (ph) Fever, from\nmalnutrition. I got Rose Fever in my legs and they would swell up, swelled up and and had\nreddish spots - it was terrible. I couldn't move them. So they gave me, I guess, vitamins, the\nround big pills. They gave me vitamins. After a while it subsided and I was walking around\nagain. From the beginning we were considered Ausleander, foreigners with British and\nAmerican papers. Some of the people had South American papers. I remember one had\nMexican, Mexican papers as a citizen of Mexico. And from the beginning they treated us\nvery well. The children were getting milk. The food was good and then something happened.\nI don't know exactly how it happened when the food was rationed and we didn't get the same\ntreatment just as we came in. We were about, and I can't - already at that time they brought\nin people from Warsaw who had false papers from all over. And one day an inspection came.\nGestapo came to inspect the camp and our commandant, Jewish commandant, our\nrepresentative you know - speaker - his name was Sonderling (ph) and he was he was from\nLwow. As the Gestapo was passing by and the, Mr. Sonderling was presenting his statement,\none of the Gestapo men said to him, what are you doing here? And he called him by his\nrightful name. This Mr. Sonderling, it seems that he was studying law with the Gestapo man\nin Germany. Together they were classmates. And he recognized him. About a week later\nthere was, they posted a list of names on the barrack. Those people will be sent to\nSwitzerland for exchange of Germans from the United States or Britain whatever. And\npeople were fighting to get on that list. They were paying off the people on that, that were on\nthat list money to take their place. Some people did it. And there was a transport a few\nhundred people. Because the camp already consisted of over a thousand people. And Mr.\nSonderling was on that list with other people. Two brothers, that were doctors. One stayed\nand one went with the transport. As we found out later, that everybody envied those people -\nthey are going to Switzerland. They were sending messages with them. We found out later\non from the grapevine, through the grapevine, people working the railroads - you know from\nthe prisoners, other prisoners, that the train came back with the luggage of those, of those\nfrom those people on that transport. It seems like that thing went straight to the gas chambers\nof Auschwitz. And afterwards they were checking papers but the Gestapo was very thorough\nthe first ttme. And whoever was left, they made the compound smaller. They moved us from\none place to another, from one barrack to the other. One day - it was so bad that we were so\nhungry. There was a piece of bread they gave us that day that we made- they gave us a loaf\nof\n02:39:\nblack bread and we had to cut it, cut portions, appropriate portions for each person in the\ncamp, and we made a scale out of strings and pieces of wood and each crumb, God forbid it\nfell off off that that scale - was terrible. There were special people assigned to weigh that\nbread. Sanitary conditions was terrible. There was, in the beginning we had the latrine was a\nbuilding with a big ditch and two benches on each side. You had a panoramic view of\neverybody. Later on we had a barrack with a toilet that didn't work. We had water that was\nrationed you know, hours that you could use. People were eating up were eating up eaten up\nby lice. We were sitting in the morning and and killing the lice - the shirts were infested with\nit. Hungry - that the kettle that they brought in from the kitchen - we had to send people to\nbring those military kettles with with soup that you didn't know what the soup was made\nfrom, and yet when it was dished out to everybody, a portion to everybody, we had a line-up\nof people, a list of people that could lick that kettle out after it was finished. Such hunger.\nYou can imagine sanitary conditions 1n that in that camp. No toilet paper. People left to their\nown devices to tend to the sanitary conditions. .. .",
        "Q: Martin, what did you do during the day?",
        "A: Nothing. Nothing. The kids were were asking, actually the parents you know were asking\nthose older the the young people that went to colleges, that studied, to teach the others. So\nwe used to take out the board from the bunk, from underneath the mattress and scrape out\nour lessons on the board with a piece of wire or something because there was no pencil. If\nthere was a pencil it was a treasure. I learned about architecture this way. There was an\narchitect, my mother you know saved a piece of bread to give for my lessons. There was a\nperson that taught English. There was a person that taught French. We tried to occupy\nourselves but actually we did nothing. This Bloomenstock that I was talking about that is\nnow in New York, became a shoemaker. We used to have these Sabots. Those are the\nwooden Dutch shoes. They hurt our feet terrible. But the shoes that we came with were\nfalling apart. So he used to take the boards from the from the bunks. He used to make little\npegs and that's how he used to fix the shoes. He used to take old shoes, cut a piece of leather\nout of the shoe and used to patch up the shoes, other people's shoes with that way, you know,\nwith the pegs, wooden pegs. Over here he has warehouses with shoes - it became it became\nhis trade. (laughter)",
        "Q: Back in those days in Bergen-Belsen, how long did you and your family stay there?",
        "A: Two years. From 1943, summer of 1943 until April, beginning of April 1945. The conditions\nwere terrible. People were dying and they moved us at the end already to the end of camp in\na little barrack and people were dying of typhus at that time already. In April of 1945. But I\nwant to come back to the camp before that, to the compound before that. One day I was\nstanding outside before the barrack and a transport of Jewish prisoners - the Germans\nbrought in to the next compound next to us. And while I was standing outside I heard my\nname called. I turned around and through the wires I see a skeleton standing there. I couldn't\nrecognize him. He says Martin, he says. At that time they called me Monick (ph). Monick,\ndon't you recognize me. I said no. And he told me his name. He was my classmate. And he\nsays they told me that you are coming over here for Erholung, for recuperation from another\ncamp. Can you spare a piece of bread? I didn't eat. I didn't eat for two days. So I I went to my\nmother. I said, can you spare a piece of bread? So she went to ask other people when we got\na little package together of pieces of bread and I went to the wire and made it so you know\nso the guard from the tower wouldn't see, and I threw it you know, through the wires towards\nhim. And that night we heard, I heard a commotion in that barrack next door, next\ncompound. In the morning that barrack was empty. we heard that Kapos and the German\nguards went in there during the night with sticks and beat the whole the whole group to\ndeath. Just beat them to death. And I didn't see my friend again. In 1983, when I was at the\ngathering of the Holocaust survivors in Washington, a woman passed me by. And she saw\nmy badge which says\n02:48:\nTarnow. I, so she says are you from Tarnow\u201d I said yes. She said I have a husband that 1s\nfrom Tarnow. I said what is his name. So she said Franco. I said Franco. What's his first\nname? So she told me the first name. I said it's impossible. Franco was killed in a barrack in\nBergen-Belsen. No she said. He played dead. He fell on other bodies and he they took him\nout of camp and he joined other prisoners, a work a work group, as the bodies were being\ntransported. He lives now in Mexico City. And this was his wife. (Amazing) And he was in\nWashington and we missed each other. She gave me his telephone number and I was rushing\nto the hotel and I got stuck in traffic and I never made it. He went back to Mexico.",
        "Q: Martin, if we could come back now to the time when you were still in the camp (Yes)\napproaching a time when there would be other actions in the camp. How did you experience\nthrough it?",
        "A: As I said, the sanitary conditions and the hunger was very bad and this was 1943, winter.\nWas very hard winter and the Germans allowed the people from the barrack, they should\nvolunteer to go into the woods - it was a forest actually behind the behind the camp and\ngather twigs for the stove in the - we had one stove, belly - how you call it - stove oven - and\nmy mother volunteered. The poor woman was stepping to her knees in this snow to go to the\nforest. And pieces of bread that we saved, maybe later maybe later we'll eat. The crust from\nthe bread we used to stick to the pot-bellied stove. It should get hot where she would be able\nto chew on it and in April of 1945 it was Passover. The Germans took us out about, four\nhundred people and transported four hundred people. An epidemic already started in that\ncompound, typhus epidemic. And they marched us out of the camp. I had double pneumonia.\nAnd I had to walk seven kilometers to the train in Celle, the town of Celle. I was lagging\nbehind. My mother was afraid that as I stayed behind the Germans would shoot me. Who\nneeds, you know, who needs me. But I made it. As soon as we came to the train I lied myself\ndown on top of the luggage rack over there, just laid there. I had a terrible pain in my back. I\nwas sick with fever. And the train started with seventy guards sitting on top of the roof while\nthe train was in motion. The German commandant who was in charge and we found out that\nwe are going to be transported to Theresienstadt. Theresienstadt was the show case for the\nworld, so-called better camp of for foreigners. By the time we reached Magdeburg, this is in\nnorthern part of Germany, the train started to rerouting, back and forth. We are going in\ncircles for ten days. We couldn't get through because the Allies were on all sides. And\nGerman kids were standing on mounts you know near the railroad tracks and they were\nyelling while we are going towards Magdeburg, they were yelling, where are you going?\nYou are going into fire. Magdeburg was bombed by American planes. And the train had to\nstop in the middle of the forest. And while the bombings were going on, the wave after wave\nof planes, we went underneath the train to hide. A lot would help if the bombs would drop.\nAnd the commandant, not knowing what to do, he went to the next village to call up Berlin.\nHe told us where he is going. And he came back and he told, he told us that he has order to\nliquidate the whole transport, to shoot us. He says I am sorry. I have orders from Berlin. And\nthe heavy machine guns were all set up. During the night we saw artillery from far away\nshooting in our direction. It was like someone was lighting a match. One by one. And the\nGerman army was retreating in the forest past our train. We were scared terribly because we\ndidn't know. Maybe they they will get into their heads to finish us off as they are retreating.\nIn the morning it was quiet. It was a beautiful day in the morning. And the train was in a\nplace where there was a stream passing by you know, running by. And the little kids went to\nthe stream. People were dying. Hunger, hungry, terrible. We had rations given us as we\nstarted out. People ate it right away. When the train stopped in an open field we used to jump\nout and dig out the the turnips that they give to cows to eat. We used to eat it raw. It used to\nburn our throats terribly, but we ate it. And that morning the German commandant left the\ntrain and we see him on a bicycle. He went to the village and we see him on a bicycle\npassing by, and waving to us as he rides rides away. And out of this seventy guards that were\nguarding that train, only seven were left. And they were not even Germans. They were\nUkrainians, a mixture of from other countries in German uniforms. About ten o'clock in the\nmorning, about that time, we heard a squeaking sound of metal rumbling and a tank showed\nup over the horizon on the hill pointing a gun towards the train with a white star on it. We\ncouldn't make it out, what it was. And a soldier jumped off that tank and he comes towards\nus and we realized it's an American soldier. And he didn't, he didn't come fifty yards from\nthe train when a surge of people started running towards him (pause - crying) kissing his\nfeet. The soldier started crying and he told us that President Roosevelt died. It was the 13th\nof April, 1945.",
        "Q: And for you, Martin, it was the end of one long experience?",
        "A: And we realized that we are liberated. And one of the German guards pointed a gun at the\nAmerican soldier. And two of our people jumped him. Took away the gun from him. So we\nsaid to the American soldier, shoot him. He wanted to kill you. He says no, he has orders to\ntake prisoners. We found out the soldier's name was Schwartz (ph) from Brooklyn. A young\nboy.",

        "A: I was born in Tarnow, Poland.",
        "A: In 1928. December 2nd, 1928.",
        "A: My parents lived over there since they were married. My mother, my mother comes from\nUnited States originally. She was born in United States, in Newark, New Jersey and she was\nmarried in Tarnow, where I was born. So did my sister. She was born in Tarnow also. We\nhad a large family on both sides, on my father's side and my mother's side. And it was aa\nclose, close-knit family.",
        "A: Life, Jewish life in Tarnow was a vibrant life. We had synagogues. We had Jewish\norganizations, Zionist organizations, Jewish sports clubs, general Zionist organizations\nwhere all the people, all the organizations met and they used to organize dances over there.\nThe Jewish newspaper, the publisher had his office there. It was very, a very active Jewish\ncommunity.",
        "A: My father worked for the city in the tax department until 1937 when he was dismissed by the\ngovernment because at that time anti-Semitism was at its peak and they dismissed all the\nJewish workers that worked for the city and at that time he got a job in a Zionist organization\nwhere he served sandwiches and you know, tended to the card room to organize the events\nthe Jewish organizations sponsored. He was in charge of those things, with my mother of\ncourse. They were working together. They had a kitchen over there and buffet tables, where\nthey you know, tended to buffet tables and so on.",
        "A: It was a happy life of a youngster. I started out in a Cheder and then I attended the Javne\nschool. It was a Jewish progressive school run under rabbinical supervision until the\nbeginning of the war. And I knew nothing of another world but a Jewish world.",
        "A: I had, well of course I had Jewish friends from school, non-Jewish friends I used to play with\nwhere I, where we lived on\nVenskogo Street. This was 1n a building for the city workers when my father was still active\nin his office. I made some friends and we used to play. When I was home I used to play with\nnon-Jewish friends. They were very, very nice. There was no talk against Jews. I used to\nvisit their houses. They used to come to my house and there was no problem.",
        "A: The problems started after Marshal Pilsudski died. He was the President of Poland.\nAfterwards anti-Semitism became stronger, much stronger and as a matter of fact when he\ndied the Polish anti-Semites used to run into the street and call to the Jews, your grandfather\ndied, because he was very good to the Jews, the Jewish people. And it was at a peak as I\nsaid, in 1937 came to a peak where antisemitism was very strong and I don't think that the\nGermans would have such a good time taking over Poland if not for this anti-Semitism that\nexisted at that time.",
        "A: Yes, 1938. A week before the Germans came in, it was a chaos in town. It was terrible. The\nJewish people were really scared and they hired trucks and wagons and whatever they could\nget,\ntransportation to run towards the Russian border away from the German invasion. They,\nespecially men because it was a talk that the Germans when they come in right away they\ntake the men for slave labor and they massacre the Jewish populations on the way as they\ncome in. We heard stories from the German Jews that were pushed across the borders a\ncouple of years before that, terrible stories but nobody could visualize what really is\nhappening. Nobody believed it, the kind of stories they used to tell, how the Germans treated\nthe the Jewish population in Germany. And nobody can really understand what the Jewish\npeople went through unless they themselves went through the war, the holocaust. It's\nimpossible to understand, to to comprehend.",
        "A: Well there were stories of Jews being grabbed from the streets and from apartments for slave\nlabor. They were beaten in the streets, their belongings confiscated. Their houses being\nconfiscated, their properties being confiscated. And some of the people never come back\nfrom slave labor camps. They were telling stories about concentration camps. Nobody could\ncould comprehend what the concentration camp wer in those years, and as I said it's very\nhard to understand unless you yourself go through it, went through it.\n01:10\nyou were ten years of age.",
        "A: I was eleven.",
        "A: The day before the Germans came in was very quiet. I remember like today. The city was\nlike a holiday atmosphere. There was no movement except at night the stores were robbed,\nbroken into. the government warehouses where broken into. I even went during the day I\nwent to look how they carried, people carried out cartons with cigarettes and with all kinds\nof things from that warehouse. There was a fear 1n the air that you couldn't understand. Spies\nwere being caught. German spies were being caught, and daily air raids, bombing hospitals\neven. In our city a a bomb fell on a hospital and when the air raid sirens were sounding off\nwe yelled to my father, you know, let's go to the basement. He says, oh no, there's nothing\ngoing to happen, until the bomb hit the hospital and and he fell out of bed. Then he was\nrunning to the basement. And we lived near the military barracks where they were\nregistering the new recruits. And that day and night there was a very busy place and while\nwe were in the basement hiding, we heard someone upstairs 1n the lobby and our neighbor\nwas a fireman. He had a gun on him, and he went to look and he brought down a very scared\nperson, a man, and when he asked him what he was doing, in his state he said he was looking\nfor bullets for his gun, because he had also a gun on him. So they sat him down by\ncandlelight in the basement and the fireman you know, said to my father he says, look\nthrough his papers. And my father's hands were shaking and he was looking through his\npapers and if my father would have said he's a spy, the gun would have, you know, the\nfireman would have shot this man. But my father said he's alright. His papers are OK. And\nlater on he, my father told me, you know, I didn't even look at the papers. I was so scared I\ncouldn't see anything. (Laughter) So but they were catching spies, musicians that were going\nfrom courtyard to courtyard and they had maps and papers on on their bodies under their\nshirts. Some when the planes were coming over, German planes, bombers were coming over,\nthey caught a few that had radios on them talking to the pilots. I remember, you know, a lot a\nlot of people were being caught as spies, it was a chaos. A week before the Germans came in\na bomb, a time bomb went off at the railroad station, and one person got killed, a woman that\nwas in transit, a Jewish woman in transit, and I have her name written down. As a matter of\nfact, am working now with a with a lady that this was her aunt. Just happens that we were\ntalking about the situation in Poland at that time. She says you know, my aunt was killed by\na bomb in Tarnow at the beginning, before the Germans came in, in transit. I said I\nremember. Things, things come back into memories that when the Germans came in, on\nSeptember 8th, I was on a corner, standing on a corner on Main Street watching them\ncoming in the trucks. Truck by truck, and the German military police was standing directing\nthe traffic. And they all were asking directions to the main crossing point on the way to\nWarsaw. One road led to Lwow in the direction of the Russian border and one towards\nWarsaw. And I was standing over there watching the guards that were on each corner of\n01:16:\nthe street, and they had belts, belt buckles and it said, Got mit uns, so at that time as a kid I\nwas wondering what kind of God did they believe in. Which god. Cruel people, they didn't\nseem cruel. I, as a kid you know, I always admired military uniforms. They had beautiful\nuniforms. And had those two grenades under their belts, and standing guard over there with a\ngun. I, as a kid you know, you admire military people and I was fascinated by the military\nsplendor that they came in with, organized, motorized. It wasn't like this under the Polish\ngovernment. Polish government, I've seen soldiers come running back, retreating where they\nhad their shoes on their shoulders and barefooted running back. And this fascinated me. It\nwas a well motorized, organized army that came into Tarnow.",
        "A: As soon as they came in, it didn't take long. It took a day or two where the horror begun,\nwhere they started searching and confiscating the Jewish properties. They took old people.\nEspecially they picked on Jews with beards, religious people, to take them out into the street\nand to clean the manure, horse manure from the street with their hands. They didn't give\nthem brooms, nothing. They were degraded to a point where even an animal doesn't do it and\nat that time we were seeing what those people that came from Germany were talking about.\nThere were people that were rounded up, young people in the streets for slave labor. They\nsend them to Plaszow - that's near Krakow. This was just a beginning. There were some of\nthem came back. They were telling stories about working conditions in those in those camps.\nPeople were really horrified because you never knew when you would be grabbed in the\nstreet. (By) the SS, the Wehrmacht didn't bother. The Wehrmacht went along with the SS,\nwhat the SS was telling them to do. They were of course helping; they had to help, but the\nGestapo and the SS were the main characters that came in to play that horrified the Jewish\npopulation and there was a day they picked Jews at random in the street and they tortured\nthem. They were cutting off their beards with knives and they were kicking them. My rabbi\nthat used to teach me for my bar mitzvah, they caught him with a tallis on a Saturday at his\nhome and they were kicking him around and I happened to come because this was the time\nfor my lesson. I just happened to be there when they were kicking him around and he saw\nme and he yelled out, he yelled out in Jewish he yelled out, run. As a matter of fact not in\nJewish but in Hebrew. Run, Moishele. As I turned around you know, they pushed\n01:21:\nhim down to the ground and then I heard a shot. And this was the end of Rabbi Brubel(?).",
        "A: After they came in.",
        "A: The same apartment. Same year one day, this was in 1940, came a Volksdeutscher, it means\nhe was of a German descent, and we were ordered to get out of our apartment. And we had\nto leave everything behind and moved in with his family and my father and I had to sleep in\nmy mother's uncle's lumber yard because there was\nno place where to go. My mother and my sister, Uncle Farber took in and they lived in his\napartment. We, my father and I slept over there in the lumber yard for some time and then\nwe found a little apartment in a farm house overlooking the Jewish cemetery. This was\nUlitsa Spitalna, number 43. I still remember. And we lived over there until the first massacre,\nthe first deportation took place. After the deportation we had to move from there. But\nsomething happened during the time before the deportation. My father heard that it will be\nmore than the deportation and he built an attic in a woodshed. This was a little farmhouse\nwhere had woodsheds. You know, each apartment had the woodsheds. And we had, he built\na woodshed to, just in case of emergency we have to hide, because he didn't work and I\nworked at that time for a tailor, a very nice Jewish man that catered to German clientele,\nwhen they came to visit the military husbands or brothers or whatever. And he was very nice\nto me. I didn't know the trade but I used to help out and my father worked at the\n2? what they called it. There was a German firm; they were putting up structures\nfor high tension wires from the German border to the Russian border all along. It was very\nhard work but after the work in the area was finished, they dismissed all the workers and that\nmeant my father didn't have work. But everybody had to work at that time. Otherwise they\nwere in trouble. And one day it happened. Suddenly there was the day of deportation where\nthe Germans came in and from house to house searching, they, with a list. They were very\nwell organized. They always came with\n01:26:\na list with names. And they took mostly the old people that couldn't work, people that were\nwearing glasses, that were undesirables. People that had anything, like a limp or had\nsomething wrong with the eyes. Right away they were the candidates for the transport and as\nsoon as we heard that the Germans, what the Germans are doing, before they came our way,\nmy father and I went into the attic and my mother had her birth certificate, and that's how she\ncould protect my sister, because she was a little kid, she was ten years old, eleven years old.\nSo she thought she would be safe with, as an American citizen. And she also had her\nAusweis, the ID card issued by the Germans as an American and we heard the columns of\nJews under the German escort at night. It was going constantly. They were passing our house\nbecause this was already on the outskirts of the city, the cemetery, and they were marching\nthem to the woods behind the city. And as we found out later they were all shot over there.\nDuring the day I looked out through the shingles. My father said I shouldn't look but anyway\nI was a kid. I was curious and the roof was overlooking the cemetery and wagons with\nbodies dead bodies, were coming in. Groups, they were bringing in groups of Jewish people\nthat had to dig ditches and the bodies dumped in and after those Jews that dug the ditches,\nthey were shot also and pushed by another group that came in after them into those ditches\nand lime was poured over over the bodies and the next group covered up those ditches and\ndug\n01:28:\nother ditches. They brought in, they brought in pregnant women, and they didn't use any\nbullets. They used bayonets. The screams of the mothers that their children, they they hold\nthe children under their arms and the screams of the children I still hear. Little infants. The\nGermans took pleasure, the SS took pleasure in taking little infants and smashing their heads\nagainst the tombstones or the cemetery wall. Little babies - they made a game out of it. One\ngrabbed one leg and one the other leg and they tore the babies apart. I'm sorry.",
        "A: No matter how many times I speak about it, I have the same reaction.",
        "A: My father swore to me I shouldn't speak about it. Nobody will believe me. They will say\nthat, that I made it up . . .He was partially right; even our Jewish people said it really\nhappened (7?)\n... 1 don't understand. How can anyone make up a story like that? At that time when I hid\nwith my father in that attic, we heard, it was during the day, we heard my sister scream,\ncalling my mother. It happened that a German soldier came 1n and was looking you know,\nfor Jews, and my mother showed the birth certificate and had an ID card and he left. It took a\nfew days till the whole thing subsided but as I understand from people that survived, the\ngathering places was the main market place, , In the center of Tarnow, was jammed\nwith people that were either killed on the spot or taken to the railroad station and transported\nto Belsec concentration camp. And actually it was, and that camp nobody came from Belsec,\nout of Belsec. When it was over my mother sent my sister because she was little and she\nfigured nobody was going to bother her in the street, to see 1f anybody from the relatives is\nstill alive, and she had an old aunt living in that market place with two daughters and this\naunt was already 90 years old. So when my sister came up there, they told her that they didn't\nbother to kill her on the spot, this old woman. They took her by the legs and arms and threw\nher from the second floor down on to the wagon with the dead bodies, alive. And it was\nMala Lubash (ph) and her sister Golda Reich, with her husband, the old Tante Lubash they\nkilled. That was the first deportation and massacre in Tarnow of the Jewish people. At that\ntime 12,000 people died because before they massacred, they ordered all the Jews from\nsurrounding areas, from smaller areas, to move in to Tarnow. No Jews were allowed to live\nin the villages and the farm areas. They had to live in Tarnow. So the population swelled you\nknow and they had a better a better easier way of killing the Jews that way.",
        "A: The ghetto was formed after the first action was taken, after the first deportation. I'll tell you\nabout my father why I skipped it. I wanted to tell a story about my father on the first day of\nthe deportation, across the yard, across the courtyard lived a Jewish policeman and when my\nfather heard, you know, he went to ask him advice, his advice what to do. And while he was\nin his house, the Gestapo people came into the courtyard and when they saw him coming out\nfrom Mr. Gelb's house, my father didn't have any papers on him. It was all destiny. It didn't\ntake much just for the Gestapo man to ask my father, Ausweis, papers. This this would have\nbeen the end of him. But they didn't ask. My father was so weak, so scared, that he braced\nhimself against the wall and his knees started to buckle and the Gestapo man says, said to my\nfather, are you sick? My father said nein. Are you besoffen? Are you are you drunk? He said\nnein. Where do you live? So my father pointed to the house next door and he says, Zurueck\nnach Hause. Go back home. So one of them couldn't take it because this was a\nhigher ranking officer told my father to go back home. He run after my father and give him a\nkick in the behind you know and my father fell into the house. But as I said, the whole war\nthat we lived through was destiny. Each one who has any family saved the others' lives\nwhich I will - so the first was my mother, because she saved us because she was an\nAmerican citizen.",
        "A: Yes, in 19... in 1938 my mother wrote to the American Consulate in Warsaw and they said\nthat they're going to issue her a visa if she will come to Warsaw Consulate and sign papers\ntestifying that she never voted in the Polish elections. And she procrastinated. She was busy\nwith this and that. She never thought of going to Warsaw until 1939 when there was talk\nabout the war. And the American Consulate at the Embassy said that she should come\nimmediately because they are evacuating all the American citizens and she should come to\nregister. And she still procrastinated. So they said you can go back to United States but your\nfamily has to stay behind because we can't issue visas anymore for your family. And she\ndidn't want to go by herself. She said if they have to stay, I will stay with my family. That's\nhow she got stuck as an American citizen. And the American Consulate, the American\nEmbassy ignored her. They just left her to fend for herself as a Jewess.",
        "A: They were difficult years. Difficult years.",
        "A: The Germans made the Jewish quarters smaller. They tightened the area for the Jews, made\nit smaller. The part where we lived on the little farm house was out of the Jewish area, so we\nhad to move in into a smaller.... , well, this was a ghetto without walls. And at that time we\nhad to, my father and I had to go back to the lumber yard to sleep. My mother went with my\nsister to the Farber's to live, to her uncle, and a short time later they found room for my father\nand myself also and we slept ten people in one room because the Farbers had their son and\ntheir relatives come from other cities to live with them. At that time they thought that\nTarnow is, will be safer and they wanted to stay with the family. So there were ten people in\none room sleeping on the\n01:44:\nfloor. And it didn't take long till the second deportation started. And we heard about the date\nbecause the Germans said the Jews should be ready for a transport on this and this date, and\nUncle Farber in his lumber yard dug two ditches underneath the floorboards of the lumber\nyard. One for his family and one for his immediate relatives. I thought that we are included\nso my father said as soon as he heard about the deportation, he says let's go. This was the day\nbefore the actual date, and went to hiding in the lumber yard. When the action began it was\ntoo late already for the Farber family to get there because the Germans were rounding up the\nJews already and they couldn't go through the streets, so you know Uncle Farber and his two\ndaughters climbed up on the roof of the building and there was a big chimney like the\nEuropean buildings have, those wide chimneys, hid behind the chimney and it didn't take\nlong. The Germans were rounding up the Jews in this building and one of the neighbors,\ndownstairs neighbors, pointed out to the chimneys to the Germans Uncle Farber with his two\ndaughters, and that's how he was killed and my family hid under the floorboards. And we\nheard shooting for about four days because this lumber yard was situated also on the market\nplace. Tarnow had about four market places and this was a gathering place for farmers and\nyou know, when they came to, before the war, to the to the market place to sell their goods.\nWe were flat, prostrate on our backs under the floorboards. It was dark. We didn't know\nwhen is day, when was night, and all we heard was yelling and screaming and the German\nshepherd dogs barking outside. This was another thing, a miracle that the German shepherds\ndidn't sniff us out. During the the massacre, during the action, there were Polish young\npeople who helped the Germans kill Jews. There was the Legion, the Polish Legion they\ncalled themselves. And two of them came into the lumber yard and they were standing right\nabove us urinating and one said to the other, oh, if I catch a Jew, I won't give him over to the\nto the Germans. I will cut off his head with my axe. And this was the attitude of the anti-\nSemites in in Poland at that time. They were even helping the Germans kill the Jews. And\nwhen it was over we came out smelling like roses. We were covered with feces and dirt. We\nlooked at each other and started laughing. But during the deportations my mother was so\nscared underneath the floorboards that she was hallucinating and we had to slap her face. She\nsaw a Gestapo man. It was dark. It was pitch dark. She was hallucinating. She saw a Gestapo\nman with that with a briefcase standing. Where? Slapped her face to keep her quiet. Really -\nif someone had a bad heart this was the end of the person. Could never live through if\nsomeone was weak. You had to be a really super strong to - all the people that survived the\nwar were people that were strong, strong people. Otherwise you couldn't survive.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: When it was quiet. It was quiet. And...",
        "A: When we came out we went back to the house, to the Farber's house, and nobody talked.\nEverybody kept to himself. It was like someone died in the family. Actually they did. But\nnobody talked about it and each one of us went back to their own chores. After each\ndeportation the Germans, they (re)organized the factories, re-registered the people. The\nfactory that I worked with my mother was called Madritsch (ph). This was a German firm,\nactually Austrian, an Austrian firm that used to make military coats. and I used to work in\nthe pressers room where I used to wring out the rags for the pressers. I used to come home\nwith blisters on my hands. I couldn't move them. All day, you know, have my hands in water\nand and wringing out rags and then after the pressers got through with pressing the coats,\nthey loaded coats on my shoulder and I used to carry the coats to the to the other side of the\nbuilding where they were sewing on the buttons on the coats. That's where my mother\nworked, and as I said, after each deportation they re-registered and the ghetto was getting\nsmaller. Each time they were making the ghetto smaller. The ghetto after the second\ndeportation, they split the ghetto in two. There was Ghetto A and Ghetto B. Ghetto A was for\nthe slaveworkers and Ghetto B was for people who didn't work - for the old people and for\nchildren. And then after the deportation when they were re-registering - let me, let me go\nback a little bit - I want to make a point of something. When I was carrying the coats there\nwas a group of women, the wives of the managers, German managers and the owners of the\nfirm came for an inspection of the factory, to Tarnow. And when one woman saw me\ncarrying the coats, she says, oh what a pity - that little boy with a load like this on his\nshoulders. Soon after I was called to the office. I said to myself, oh, this is the end. So when I\ncame to the office, there was the owner of the factory, the Austrian, standing there with a\nsmile, and he says to me, how do you like to work over here? I said, it's alright. He says, how\nis your health? I said fine. It seems like his wife said something about me. He says, then he\nsays to me, if you need anything, come to me and tell me. And this manager, the Jewish\nmanager Mr. Weinstock, who managed the factory, was getting fidgety and he excused me\nby saying that I have to back to work and shoved me out of the door. This Mr. Madritsch I'll\nnever forget because this Mr. Madritsch after the war, wrote a book, how he saved 500 Jews\nin Tarnow by creating a factory. He did it with a purpose, and he wrote a book and they put\nup a tree in his name in Yad vaShem. (Very interesting.) He had a partner, Mr. Titsch (ph),\nwho also was honored by Yad vaShem, and I want to make a point that after the deportation\nwhen they were re-registering the Jewish people, I went over to the table, to the Gestapo\ntable that was standing in the middle of the market place, and you know, there was a line of\npeople. I came to the table and they put my name down. And then Mr. Weinstock was\nstanding over there and he didn't want to register my mother. I was very desperate. I looked\naround and I said, why not. He said we don't need so many people. I looked around and I\nsaw Mr. Titsch standing talking to an SS officer. I went over. I was a little kid. I had no fear\nbecause I knew that they liked me, you know, this Mr. Madritsch liked me and he was there\nwith the with a group inspecting the factory at that time. I went over and I said, they\nregistered me, but they don't want to register my mother, in my in my broken German. He\nlooked at me with a smile. He took me by the shoulder and led me to the table and he said to\nthe SS man, he said put his mother's name down.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: One morning I got up early before all the others. I looked around the room. There were ten\npeople on the floor sleeping and as I was dressing I looked out of the window that was\nleading outside the ghetto and I see trucks, German trucks with soldiers, a whole column\ngoing towards the ghetto gate and as they were riding down towards the gate they were\ndropping off Polish policemen across the street to stand guard watching the ghetto. I knew\nright away what's going to happen. This was the third deportation taking place and right\naway I screamed out an alarm - the Germans are coming. And everybody got up and they\nstarted running in every direction. People didn't know what what to do. They were not\nprepared for it. And my parents and my sister started running towards that hiding place again\nin the lumber yard. We couldn't get there because the we realized when we were in the street\nalready that the gate that the German trucks were coming in to where it was in our way,\nbetween the hiding place, the lumber yard and us. And we couldn't get through. So we turned\naround and my father told us to get in to the first building that was on our way, as we were\nretreating, and it was a big courtyard, an old house where you come into the house and there\nis a big door, a wooden door and then a big courtyard and there was a complete chaos 1n that\ncourtyard. People were running, screaming names Chaim, Moishe. And they had a big ladder\nagainst a wall of a building and there was an opening in the wall, high up, and they were\nclimbing the ladder to that hiding place. How many people can go into that - there were\nabout a few dozen people running around like chickens. My sister, she was a little girl,\nturned around on her on her heel, comes back running into the street with her pigtails flying -\nshe says, I am not going 1n there. And she started running towards our house. And without a\nword we followed her. As we were on our way back to our house, we heard the Germans\nmarching in the streets behind us because they had those hobnails on the boots and we were\nrunning back as fast as possible and on the way my mother said, you know, I heard about a\nhiding place that a man was building in his apartment. Let's go over there. So it was on the\nfirst floor where we used to live in our in our house where the Farbers lived, and at the end\nof the balcony because the the courtyard had a balcony all around, a wooden balcony, so at\nthe end of the balcony there was an apartment and we came over there and there was a\npadlock on the door. My father turns around to me. He says go back to the apartment and get\nthe axe. I run first to the apartment and brought the axe and my father ripped off the padlock\nand we heard already Germans entering the building downstairs. We came to the apartment.\nWas quiet. Nobody was there. So my mother called out - we are Spetts. Please let us in. I\nknow that there is a hiding place over here. And nobody answered. So my mother\nthreatened. She said, if I don't hear from you we're going to move the furniture around. We're\ngoing to look for the hiding place. Finally from under the bed, a voice came from under the\nbed. They said bend down, crawl under the bed. There 1s an opening. And we all did. There\nwas aa panel. The the door from another room - the frame was taken out and blocked off.\nYou wouldn't even know that there was another room behind that wall. We crawled into\nanother room where there were about eight people there. And the owner of the apartment\ntold us that his two daughters went to work early that morning and locked the apartment with\na padlock and they didn't have any food. We stayed over there for almost a week. That's how\nlong the deportation took. But they had a pail over there for doing the business and they\nshared food with us. Very nice people. The daughters never made it back. It seems later on\nthat they were grabbed in the street and put on a train and while they jumped out through that\ncattle car opening - from a window - they were shot, both of them. They never made it... .",
        "A: In this shelter for a week and while - a few minutes after we were there 1n that hiding place,\nwe heard German voices. And one German said to the other, Wir waren schon hier, we were\nhere already. We were here already. Because they saw the lock broken, so we saved, we\nsaved the place from being searched.",
        "A: Yes. I still say life, each person's life has its destiny. I believe strongly in that. And no matter\nwhat you do, how you think, how you plan, it doesn't help. It's your destiny that rules the life.\n02:09:",
        "A: After that week this was third deportation and we struggled in the ghetto. Were terrible\nsanitary conditions, hunger. After the deportation there was talk about doing away with the\nsecond ghetto where people who didn't work and the old people. One night I hoisted my\nmother over the wooden fence. We found a corner of the fence that wasn't patrolled. It was a\ndark place, and I hoisted my mother over and then I climbed over because my father was\nthere with my sister in that ghetto. And I gave my father my number with the Madritsch\nname on it and my sister and myself were packed into wicker luggage trunk, locked in and\nmy mother called two strong fellows in the morning and she said, be careful with my china.\nIt's very precious. And they were complaining how heavy it is. When they put it on a dolly\nand and they came to the gate to take it to the other ghetto, to the working ghetto, and the\nJewish policemen were giving them trouble - started asking questions: why do you need\nchina? What are you going to do with china? My mother said this is my my only possession\nand finally they let us through, and the trunk was thrown into a basement where my sister\nand I came out later on. And my sister went into hiding you know, out of sight. That's how\nwe had to live. My father didn't work also and food was very scarce. There was no\nmedication. the Gestapo used to come and they used to grab people, shoot people in the\nstreet and it was a horror. Finally, excuse me, finally in May of 1943, the Gestapo was\nasking the Jewish leaders if they know about any foreigners like American, British citizens\nthat are still in the ghetto and the Gestapo men you know, sent fliers - whatever you call it -\nand my mother was very apprehensive because in the beginning when the Germans came in,\nthey took eighty British citizens and they shot them behind the city. And at that time my\nfather buried the my mother's birth certificate in a wall because they were afraid, you know,\nfor my mother to be recognized as an American citizen. And but when the war, we started\nmoving from ghetto to ghetto, he took the birth certificate out you know when they started\nmoving us around. My mother kept the birth certificate with her and that's what saved her.\nOn the 10th of May, 1943, a Gestapo man was sitting in the office of the Jewish police\nstation and registering a family that came before us. A man by the name of Sam,... Sam\nBloomenstock who received a postal card from his father in New York, and in that postal\ncard the father mentioned that he applied for him and for his mother for a visa. With that\npostal card, he presented this postal card to the Gestapo man. And the Gestapo man accepted\nit. Not only that he saved his mother and himself, but he took along his girlfriend and he\npresented her as his wife and he registered her too. And he lived through the concentration\ncamp and with us together and was liberated and he 1s now in Brooklyn, a businessman in\nBrooklyn.",
        "A: Yeah, to the registration. When my mother came in she faced the Gestapo man. He, the\nGestapo man asked her if she has a husband and children. And my mother was afraid to say -\nshe didn't know what to say. My father and my sister and I were standing outside waiting.\nWe didn't know what to expect. And the head of the Jewish community was standing by the\ntable and he said - he knew us - and he said of course you have a husband and children. The\nGestapo man said where are they. So she points outside the window and he told us to come\nin and he registered us and he told us to be ready tomorrow morning. One suitcase for each\nperson and we would be exchanged for German prisoners. That's our destination. The next\nmorning, on May 11th, 1943, on my father's birthday, we were, we boarded a wagon with a\nhorse and they took us to the railroad station. Passenger train took us to Krakow railroad\nstation there, and we had to wait for a while over there and we told we will send out postal\ncards to people that we know. One we sent to ghetto where we knew that it's not going to\narrive but we tried - that we arrived in Krakow. One we sent, we addressed to Basel,\nSwitzerland where my mother had an aunt by the name of Miller, Tante Miller, and she\nalways, my mother always drummed the address into our heads just in case we will be\nseparated during the war that after the war we should meet over there. Eight Rue des Bains\n(ph) in Basel and, but they never received mail. Shortly under German escort they marched\nus through the streets of Krakau into the prison, political prison, Monteluppe (ph) where we\nspent nine weeks, men separated from women. We didn't know of each other's fate. We came\nto the cell and there were straw sacks burlap burlap bags with straw as mattresses, for\nmattresses. There was a table, a wooden table and two benches and a niche in the cell for a\nbucket for sanitary conditions. The windows were facing the courtyard and they had a metal\ncover wider at the top so the sun can come in and on the bottom was narrower with holes on\nthe bottom for drainage, water drainage. And a few days later they brought in more prisoners\nto our cell, also Jews from Lwow and surrounding areas. As we found out they had false\npapers, foreign papers. They paid for those papers and the Germans registered them as as\nforeigners. We were about ten people in the cell and on the way to the showers one day in\nthe basement we met Jews that were prisoners of that prison there, political prison - Jews\nwere considered - as Jews they were not political. They were considered lower than animals.\nThey were\n02:21:\nnot even human because they were not human beings. But they told us on passing - they\nwere coming out from the showers and we were going in and we looked at each other and\nthey had pieces of noses missing, pieces of ears that were all scratched and bitten, so one of\nthem said that when they are being punished, they are being thrown into cells with mad dogs,\nGerman shepherds, and that's what happens you know, when the German shepherds attack.\nDuring the day we saw exercises in the courtyard where they were exercising the prisoners,\nJewish prisoners, and they were beating them and torturing them with sticks. They were\nbeing hit in the Adam's apple while they were running around in circles or they told them to\nclimb up a pile of coal on their elbows and and and their knees, up the pile and as they were\nsliding down they were hit over the backs with a boards, two by twos. It was terrible. One\nday we were very hungry. We ate ate anything that was given to us. One day we heard\nsomebody by the door and we had to line up for food and the door opens up. We are standing\nalready ready to get food and there was a SS man, SS officer with his shining boots and\ngloves in his hand, and he seemed like a little drunk. And he says, \"Also Juden Spruch\". He\nsays Spruch (saying). We didn't know what he means. So everybody kept quiet. So he keeps\nyelling again, Spruch. And with that he hits the first man in the row, which was\nBloomenstock, right in the face. He says I'm going to teach you what Spruch means. And he\ngoes like this. \"wir Juden sind schuldig an allElend wenn das kosbare Deutsches Blut fliesst,\nwir Juden sind Gauner, wir Juden sind Verbrecher.\u201d",
        "A: Which means, we Jews are guilty when dear blood that 1s spilt - German blood that is spilt -\nJews are Gauner, I don't know how to translate it - it's it's like a thief you know [actually\nmeans criminal ]- a Verbrecher means a murderer [also means criminal]- we were the\nmurderers. And I will be back in one hour and we'll have to know the \"Spruch\" and with that\nhe closed the door. And we were sure he's going to come back and everybody - I didn't, I\nnever heard, I never saw people learning so fast the language - in one hour (laughter). And I\nstill remember. (laughter). So he never showed up. And I still know the \"Spruch\".",
        "A: For nine weeks. After nine weeks they took us out from the cell into the courtyard and were\nreunited with the women, with my mother, my sister and the others and the Germans told us\nto face the wall. And while we were standing with our faces to the wall, they were loading\nand reloading the guns. It seemed like they were trying to scare us because a few minutes\nlater, a few minutes - it was like a half an hour later two trucks came and a German officer\ncame over. It was Wehrmacht, the regular Army and he told us that we are being taken to be\nexchanged, to the exchange station where they will exchange the German prisoners and we\nwere being loaded on the trucks and taken to the railroad station. Pullman cars and while the\ntrain was in motion - we were going towards Germany and this officer came with official\npapers and he was taking down the information - how much property each one of us left in\nPoland - the same amount in monetary, in money will be given to us when we will be\nexchanged either to England or to United States in their monetary value. And he told us to\nsign the papers. The train arrived on the Berlin station and the Red Cross was waiting for us\nwith milk for the children and all kinds of goodies - chocolate and so on - bread and the Red\nCross knew about us. We were the Auslaender, the foreigners. Everybody was nice to us on\nthe Berlin station. At Berlin station they attached another train to our train that came from\nLwow in Poland with other group of Jews. And we were on our way. Two hours out of the\nBerlin station the train stopped in an open field. And we saw the SS surrounding the train\nwith dogs and they came on the train and they started yelling for us to get out and hitting us\nwith their guns. We turned to the commandant, to the German officer that said that we're\ngoing to be exchanged - wanted to know what is the story. He says I don't know myself. He\nsaid this end of line for me. They told me to go back. And we're being thrown out, out of the\ntrain and lined up and as they were passing by, the the SS men passing by, one says in\nGerman to the other soldier, he says oh, \"ein Maschinengewehr ist genug.\u201d One machine gun\nis enough for them. So we knew, we thought we knew what what was waiting for us, and\nafter a while trucks came backing up and they loaded us on the trucks and they put down the\nflaps you know in the back so we wouldn't see where we're going but through the opening\nwe saw we are going through a forest and my father took us around and he started praying.\nAfter a while we arrived at a camp. We saw barbed wires, pine trees all around. Smelled\nbeautifully because the barracks in that camp was freshly built. The wood the wood of the\nbarracks still smelled fresh. It was in the summer of 1943 and they unloaded us on the main\nroad in the camp where we saw across the road British and Russian prisoners still finishing\nthe barracks. It seems like they took the prisoners of war for the work for building the\nbarracks. We found out we were in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. It seems like we are\nthe first ones to open up the camp and while we were standing over there waiting something\nto happen, something happened to me. All of a sudden I lost my strength in my legs . . My\nlegs started giving and I feel I didn\"t have the strength to standon my legs. So my mother\nstarted crying. There was a nice young strong man in our group. He picked me up and he\nwas holding me in his arms until the Germans came and they were leading us away into a\nbarrack. They assigned us a barrack and they put me on a bunk and they called a German\ndoctor, a German military doctor. He came and he diagnosed it as Rose (ph) Fever, from\nmalnutrition. I got Rose Fever in my legs and they would swell up, swelled up and and had\nreddish spots - it was terrible. I couldn't move them. So they gave me, I guess, vitamins, the\nround big pills. They gave me vitamins. After a while it subsided and I was walking around\nagain. From the beginning we were considered Ausleander, foreigners with British and\nAmerican papers. Some of the people had South American papers. I remember one had\nMexican, Mexican papers as a citizen of Mexico. And from the beginning they treated us\nvery well. The children were getting milk. The food was good and then something happened.\nI don't know exactly how it happened when the food was rationed and we didn't get the same\ntreatment just as we came in. We were about, and I can't - already at that time they brought\nin people from Warsaw who had false papers from all over. And one day an inspection came.\nGestapo came to inspect the camp and our commandant, Jewish commandant, our\nrepresentative you know - speaker - his name was Sonderling (ph) and he was he was from\nLwow. As the Gestapo was passing by and the, Mr. Sonderling was presenting his statement,\none of the Gestapo men said to him, what are you doing here? And he called him by his\nrightful name. This Mr. Sonderling, it seems that he was studying law with the Gestapo man\nin Germany. Together they were classmates. And he recognized him. About a week later\nthere was, they posted a list of names on the barrack. Those people will be sent to\nSwitzerland for exchange of Germans from the United States or Britain whatever. And\npeople were fighting to get on that list. They were paying off the people on that, that were on\nthat list money to take their place. Some people did it. And there was a transport a few\nhundred people. Because the camp already consisted of over a thousand people. And Mr.\nSonderling was on that list with other people. Two brothers, that were doctors. One stayed\nand one went with the transport. As we found out later, that everybody envied those people -\nthey are going to Switzerland. They were sending messages with them. We found out later\non from the grapevine, through the grapevine, people working the railroads - you know from\nthe prisoners, other prisoners, that the train came back with the luggage of those, of those\nfrom those people on that transport. It seems like that thing went straight to the gas chambers\nof Auschwitz. And afterwards they were checking papers but the Gestapo was very thorough\nthe first ttme. And whoever was left, they made the compound smaller. They moved us from\none place to another, from one barrack to the other. One day - it was so bad that we were so\nhungry. There was a piece of bread they gave us that day that we made- they gave us a loaf\nof\n02:39:\nblack bread and we had to cut it, cut portions, appropriate portions for each person in the\ncamp, and we made a scale out of strings and pieces of wood and each crumb, God forbid it\nfell off off that that scale - was terrible. There were special people assigned to weigh that\nbread. Sanitary conditions was terrible. There was, in the beginning we had the latrine was a\nbuilding with a big ditch and two benches on each side. You had a panoramic view of\neverybody. Later on we had a barrack with a toilet that didn't work. We had water that was\nrationed you know, hours that you could use. People were eating up were eating up eaten up\nby lice. We were sitting in the morning and and killing the lice - the shirts were infested with\nit. Hungry - that the kettle that they brought in from the kitchen - we had to send people to\nbring those military kettles with with soup that you didn't know what the soup was made\nfrom, and yet when it was dished out to everybody, a portion to everybody, we had a line-up\nof people, a list of people that could lick that kettle out after it was finished. Such hunger.\nYou can imagine sanitary conditions 1n that in that camp. No toilet paper. People left to their\nown devices to tend to the sanitary conditions. .. .",
        "A: Nothing. Nothing. The kids were were asking, actually the parents you know were asking\nthose older the the young people that went to colleges, that studied, to teach the others. So\nwe used to take out the board from the bunk, from underneath the mattress and scrape out\nour lessons on the board with a piece of wire or something because there was no pencil. If\nthere was a pencil it was a treasure. I learned about architecture this way. There was an\narchitect, my mother you know saved a piece of bread to give for my lessons. There was a\nperson that taught English. There was a person that taught French. We tried to occupy\nourselves but actually we did nothing. This Bloomenstock that I was talking about that is\nnow in New York, became a shoemaker. We used to have these Sabots. Those are the\nwooden Dutch shoes. They hurt our feet terrible. But the shoes that we came with were\nfalling apart. So he used to take the boards from the from the bunks. He used to make little\npegs and that's how he used to fix the shoes. He used to take old shoes, cut a piece of leather\nout of the shoe and used to patch up the shoes, other people's shoes with that way, you know,\nwith the pegs, wooden pegs. Over here he has warehouses with shoes - it became it became\nhis trade. (laughter)",
        "A: Two years. From 1943, summer of 1943 until April, beginning of April 1945. The conditions\nwere terrible. People were dying and they moved us at the end already to the end of camp in\na little barrack and people were dying of typhus at that time already. In April of 1945. But I\nwant to come back to the camp before that, to the compound before that. One day I was\nstanding outside before the barrack and a transport of Jewish prisoners - the Germans\nbrought in to the next compound next to us. And while I was standing outside I heard my\nname called. I turned around and through the wires I see a skeleton standing there. I couldn't\nrecognize him. He says Martin, he says. At that time they called me Monick (ph). Monick,\ndon't you recognize me. I said no. And he told me his name. He was my classmate. And he\nsays they told me that you are coming over here for Erholung, for recuperation from another\ncamp. Can you spare a piece of bread? I didn't eat. I didn't eat for two days. So I I went to my\nmother. I said, can you spare a piece of bread? So she went to ask other people when we got\na little package together of pieces of bread and I went to the wire and made it so you know\nso the guard from the tower wouldn't see, and I threw it you know, through the wires towards\nhim. And that night we heard, I heard a commotion in that barrack next door, next\ncompound. In the morning that barrack was empty. we heard that Kapos and the German\nguards went in there during the night with sticks and beat the whole the whole group to\ndeath. Just beat them to death. And I didn't see my friend again. In 1983, when I was at the\ngathering of the Holocaust survivors in Washington, a woman passed me by. And she saw\nmy badge which says\n02:48:\nTarnow. I, so she says are you from Tarnow\u201d I said yes. She said I have a husband that 1s\nfrom Tarnow. I said what is his name. So she said Franco. I said Franco. What's his first\nname? So she told me the first name. I said it's impossible. Franco was killed in a barrack in\nBergen-Belsen. No she said. He played dead. He fell on other bodies and he they took him\nout of camp and he joined other prisoners, a work a work group, as the bodies were being\ntransported. He lives now in Mexico City. And this was his wife. (Amazing) And he was in\nWashington and we missed each other. She gave me his telephone number and I was rushing\nto the hotel and I got stuck in traffic and I never made it. He went back to Mexico.",
        "A: As I said, the sanitary conditions and the hunger was very bad and this was 1943, winter.\nWas very hard winter and the Germans allowed the people from the barrack, they should\nvolunteer to go into the woods - it was a forest actually behind the behind the camp and\ngather twigs for the stove in the - we had one stove, belly - how you call it - stove oven - and\nmy mother volunteered. The poor woman was stepping to her knees in this snow to go to the\nforest. And pieces of bread that we saved, maybe later maybe later we'll eat. The crust from\nthe bread we used to stick to the pot-bellied stove. It should get hot where she would be able\nto chew on it and in April of 1945 it was Passover. The Germans took us out about, four\nhundred people and transported four hundred people. An epidemic already started in that\ncompound, typhus epidemic. And they marched us out of the camp. I had double pneumonia.\nAnd I had to walk seven kilometers to the train in Celle, the town of Celle. I was lagging\nbehind. My mother was afraid that as I stayed behind the Germans would shoot me. Who\nneeds, you know, who needs me. But I made it. As soon as we came to the train I lied myself\ndown on top of the luggage rack over there, just laid there. I had a terrible pain in my back. I\nwas sick with fever. And the train started with seventy guards sitting on top of the roof while\nthe train was in motion. The German commandant who was in charge and we found out that\nwe are going to be transported to Theresienstadt. Theresienstadt was the show case for the\nworld, so-called better camp of for foreigners. By the time we reached Magdeburg, this is in\nnorthern part of Germany, the train started to rerouting, back and forth. We are going in\ncircles for ten days. We couldn't get through because the Allies were on all sides. And\nGerman kids were standing on mounts you know near the railroad tracks and they were\nyelling while we are going towards Magdeburg, they were yelling, where are you going?\nYou are going into fire. Magdeburg was bombed by American planes. And the train had to\nstop in the middle of the forest. And while the bombings were going on, the wave after wave\nof planes, we went underneath the train to hide. A lot would help if the bombs would drop.\nAnd the commandant, not knowing what to do, he went to the next village to call up Berlin.\nHe told us where he is going. And he came back and he told, he told us that he has order to\nliquidate the whole transport, to shoot us. He says I am sorry. I have orders from Berlin. And\nthe heavy machine guns were all set up. During the night we saw artillery from far away\nshooting in our direction. It was like someone was lighting a match. One by one. And the\nGerman army was retreating in the forest past our train. We were scared terribly because we\ndidn't know. Maybe they they will get into their heads to finish us off as they are retreating.\nIn the morning it was quiet. It was a beautiful day in the morning. And the train was in a\nplace where there was a stream passing by you know, running by. And the little kids went to\nthe stream. People were dying. Hunger, hungry, terrible. We had rations given us as we\nstarted out. People ate it right away. When the train stopped in an open field we used to jump\nout and dig out the the turnips that they give to cows to eat. We used to eat it raw. It used to\nburn our throats terribly, but we ate it. And that morning the German commandant left the\ntrain and we see him on a bicycle. He went to the village and we see him on a bicycle\npassing by, and waving to us as he rides rides away. And out of this seventy guards that were\nguarding that train, only seven were left. And they were not even Germans. They were\nUkrainians, a mixture of from other countries in German uniforms. About ten o'clock in the\nmorning, about that time, we heard a squeaking sound of metal rumbling and a tank showed\nup over the horizon on the hill pointing a gun towards the train with a white star on it. We\ncouldn't make it out, what it was. And a soldier jumped off that tank and he comes towards\nus and we realized it's an American soldier. And he didn't, he didn't come fifty yards from\nthe train when a surge of people started running towards him (pause - crying) kissing his\nfeet. The soldier started crying and he told us that President Roosevelt died. It was the 13th\nof April, 1945.",
        "A: And we realized that we are liberated. And one of the German guards pointed a gun at the\nAmerican soldier. And two of our people jumped him. Took away the gun from him. So we\nsaid to the American soldier, shoot him. He wanted to kill you. He says no, he has orders to\ntake prisoners. We found out the soldier's name was Schwartz (ph) from Brooklyn. A young\nboy.\nEnd of Tape #2\nConclusion of Interview\n"
