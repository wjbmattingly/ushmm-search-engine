        "Q: How do you spell that?",
        "A: Let me write it down. It was a nickname, Dzidzia, something like this. It was\nquite popular nickname in Poland and I was known as Dzidzia from my\nschooldays till before the war. For a long time, I was an only child and I loved\nthe status of being the only child and loved by everyone, the center of attention, of\ncourse. I had a small puppy that I loved but she passed away as a puppy. But\nlater on I had a sister. My sister was, in my life, played a special role because she\nwas nine years younger than me. I treated her something between my toy and\nbetween my child. It was very, very, very nice feeling. My mother was wise\nenough to keep me believing that I\u2019m the one who is responsible for my sister.\nMy friends at school were very jealous. Nobody had such a small sister or brother\naround. I could tell you about my childhood. It was a very happy childhood,\nnothing ---",
        "Q: Did you live in a suburb of Warsaw or in the city?",
        "A: No, I lived in the center of Warsaw. My father was a lawyer and we lived in a\nbig, big apartment. Those old days, everybody had maids, everybody who --\nmiddle-class people had maids. It\u2019s such a distant and different life.",
        "Q: Your parents -- you came from a Jewish family?",
        "A: It\u2019s very, very hard to say about -- that my family was a Jewish family. We were\nJewish because my parents were converts. So it wasn\u2019t strictly Jewish family. I\nwas raised more in Christian traditions than Jewish tradition.",
        "Q: Your family --your parents had both converted to Catholicism?",
        "A: My father was Catholic, my mother was Protestant. On my father\u2019s family was a\nfamily of assimilators. Is that the right word?",

        "A: Well, it takes some more explaining. They were, by faith they were Jewish, my\nfather\u2019s family. My father\u2019s family was quite known and I would even say my\nfamous father in Poland. My ---",

        "Q: Champion?",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So on my father\u2019s side it was very natural that he felt more Polish than Jewish and\nhis change of -- conversion didn\u2019t bother anybody. I think. But on my mother\u2019s\nside, it was a different story because her family was more Jewish, more traditional\nand more Jewish.

        "Q: Did you have any religious instruction, any formal --?",
        "A: No, because my parents weren\u2019t very religious people. They -- it\u2019s really hard to\nunderstand in America why people change the faith. Only to show that the sort of\nbelonging to Polish society or something.",

        "A: Maybe.\nQ Definitely, definitely.",
        "A: For my father, it was sort of patriotism. Maybe, he was very young, it was very\nnaive, it wasn\u2019t very wise, what he did. On my mother\u2019s side, it was because she\n-- my father wasn\u2019t Jew. I don\u2019t how the situation was between Jewish and not\nJewish marriage but I think that my mother wanted to -- wanted some change,\nwanted to confirm to my father\u2019s standards or something like this.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s interesting then, that number one, that she chose Protestant, and number\ntwo, that he wasn\u2019t a Polish Pole, he was formerly of a Jewish --. You know they\nstill had --.",

        "Q: They still came from that background and that\u2019s --.",
        "A: It was some but it --. The times were utmost political, atmosphere and social\natmosphere changed do quickly in Poland so some things that in 1921 or 1920\nwere appropriate might be less appropriate in 1927 when my mother got married.\nI never asked my parents; I just accepted the situation that my father was\nCatholic, my mother was Protestant and children were Protestant too. SoI--. We\nhad two Jewish, two Jewish girls in our class. They were taught religion by a\nrabbi and I was taught religion by pastor. Jews didn\u2019t, Jewish girls didn\u2019t feel, felt\nill at ease being Jewish. It was such an atmosphere in Poland. I don\u2019t know why\nit was like this but it was like this. We used to go to Protestant school.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t feel different? I spoke with Jana in Boston. She said even though\nshe was raised with these Catholic parents, she knew they were different. She\nknew something about her family was different than all the other Catholic people,\nyou know. Did you have a sense of that?",
        "A: Well, something was different but it wasn\u2019t different because of religion. It was\ndifferent because of, I don\u2019t know, because of what. Because I think that my\nparents were more independent people than most people around. More free-\nthinking, free- thinkers, more -- well, better educated or something like this.\nMore open mind.",

It was the end of the war, end of the First World War in 1917 and they went\nthrough a real terrible poverty. My mother was extremely brave and industrious\nand ambitious and beautiful. You can see now that she was a --. She didn\u2019t\naccept -- she was more like American women, not Polish. She was -- she didn\u2019t\naccept the whole situation of being poor and poorly educated and living in lower\nmiddle class family. She, as an extern, she tried to -- she got a high school\ndiploma but she didn\u2019t finish high school. She had diploma, went for exams,\nextern, is this the right word?

She gave lessons, she taught, she worked as a tutor, she\nsometimes -- she was a tutor, living with a family, she was very popular with\npeople, very, very easy to make friends.

During the war,\nwhen we were alone and my father went to the army, she started buying and\nselling things. She sort of entered, this is how we survived the war because she\nwas able to earn money. After the war when it was forbidden and very, very\ndangerous, she did the same. So my parents were well-to-do people. I never went\nthrough, never is not the right word, but most of the war, most of the time, the\nwartime, we were well to do. We were well-to-do in the sense that we weren\u2019t\nhungry. We and friends of my parents and relatives of my parents had always at\nleast one meal fixed at my parent\u2019s table.",

They were Protestants and they patronized, the\npatron of the school was that Protestant princess of the past. The school, Rey\nHigh School was very well established and often very high -- highly accepted\nschool. The Vasa School was more for girls but 1t was okay, was okay. The\natmosphere was very liberal. Everybody was well bred, tactful and I didn\u2019t feel I\nfelt at home there. I didn\u2019t feel any of that I didn\u2019t belong; I belonged. I belonged\nperfectly well.",

The book didn\u2019t belong to me; it belonged to my\nmother\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter and I was so scared, I didn\u2019t know what to do to hide\nthe book but those people didn\u2019t let me go without returning the book, I knew\nthat.

My\nmother\u2019s sister with her small son, Claude came to stay with us for two weeks, for\nthree weeks. Part of the time my parents were out. This was the only time in my\nlife, I met my cousin Claude. He came from France. He hated everything Polish.\nHe -- looking at them I had a premonition of what will happen to us because they\nwere So poor, so -- they were deportees. They had no work -- his; Claude\u2019s\nparents, had no work. They didn\u2019t belong anywhere because they didn\u2019t belong to\nFrance, they didn\u2019t belong to Poland. They were victim of some social forces that\nwe became later. They perished in the, perished in Holocaust. They were in Lodz\nghetto and they perished and they probably were the first to die from hunger\nbecause they were not able to work. They were not able to work in normal\nconditions not only in Lodz ghetto which was terrible place to live in.

I had\nanother experience with Nazism, not with Germans but Nazi Germany deported\nJews who were born in Poland in 1937. It was sort of obligation, sort of moral\nobligation of everybody who belonged to the Jewish, somehow to Jewish\ncommunity, to help them. My mother took a young girl, was maybe 19, maybe\n20, gave her a job of teaching me in German and sort of like being governess. It\nwasn\u2019t exactly governess but something like teacher and governess, something in\nbetween. She was boring, stupid and I didn\u2019t want to learn German but she was --\non the other hand, I knew she was so poor, she was so troubled. She didn\u2019t feel\nhappy, she was so out of place.

I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t, we children didn\u2019t take German\nseriously.

        "A: They knew but somehow people didn\u2019t know -- there was some blockage in the\nheads. Your imagination can\u2019t go that far. You have to have some experience to\nimagine things. If you don\u2019t experience things like that, you can\u2019t --. They knew\nthat life would be very hard but there was always hope that the war won\u2019t break\nout. There was always hope that Hitler will stop. This was sort of loyalty. You\ncan\u2019t escape from place where the others have to live, you know. This is\nsomething not honorable.

She loved guests from five till\nseven every Tuesday and that\u2019s it. My mother was absolutely astonished .It was\nsomething unbelievable so we went down to the first floor to the neighbors who\nwere very unfriendly but he couldn\u2019t; he had no guts to say no. We spent part of\nthe September of 1939, this terrible -- you know what was September of \u201939 in\nPoland, in Warsaw?",
        "Q: It was the beginning of the war.",
        "A: It was the beginning of the war. It was the bombardment of Warsaw. We spent in\n-- partly in the basement, partly in that neighbor\u2019s apartment. In the basement,\npeople prayed all the time and there I felt very tension between my mother and\nmy grandmother. She was strongly against accepting and being part of the\nprayers. She felt it was a time of trial and she felt that she is Jewish and she\ndidn\u2019t want to stay with these praying people. When the -- after the -- after\nWarsaw came into hands of Germans, my grandmother went back to Lodz. She\ncame, she was evacuated, deported in very brutal manner. She, some, not all\nJews, but some, I don\u2019t know why my grandmother, maybe old people, were\ndeported from Lodz, took to small towns. Because she had Jewish -- gmina,\nJudenrat, you know the word Judenrat?",
        "Q: Yeah, the Jewish council.",
        "Q: The Jewish council used to find place for those deportees but my grandmother\ndidn\u2019t need any place because she had her daughter in Warsaw. She came to us.\nBut when she was in Radom, she had such an experience, that it\u2019s worth telling\nand worth remembering. Those poor ,poor deportees were placed among people\nby Jewish council. There were many in one building. In the evening, one of the\nGerman, captain or lieutenant or something, used to gather them. They stayed\nthere for a few days. He gathered, the German captain gathered them and wrote\nBible to them and told them that monster and anti-Christ will be punished by God\nand that something will happen. You know who I am talking in, anti-Christ and\nmonster was Hitler in his --.",
        "Q: His theology.",
        "A: Yes. That he will be punished and that everybody has to keep faith and hope. He\ngave them extreme consolation. He was sort of saint but he was taken next day.\nSome evening he didn\u2019t come and those people asked what happened to him.\nSome were told that better not to ask because he was --.",
        "Q: He was a German officer?",
        "A: A German officer.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So it was something that doesn\u2019t happen very often and something that shouldn\u2019t\nbe forgotten. My grandmother came to us and stayed with us and went to ghetto\nwith us.",
        "Q: You were sent to the --?",
        "A: We went to ghetto in October of 1940.",
        "Q: How did that happen? You were deported to the ghetto?",
        "A: No, because it wasn\u2019t deportation or anything like this. The ghetto was built, the\nplace was, the place for Jewish population was --.",
        "Q: It was marked out?",
        "A: Was marked out. The wall was started to be built and the deadline was set. We\nwere in trouble because my parents had beautiful apartment with beautiful\nfurniture and charming place and everything. Somehow they couldn\u2019t find\nanybody to --. Jewish population outside the ghetto had to find place in the ghetto\ndistrict. People from Polish population from ghetto used to trade their apartments.\nIt was very unpleasant time because it was time for very easy quick bucks for,\nmostly for Polish people who lived in ghetto quarters. It was big, big, tension,\nbig, big -- the deadline was very close and we didn\u2019t have place to live. But at\nlast, in last minute, in the court, one of the -- well, clerks, law clerks told my\nfather, this judge who lives in ghetto, one of judges who lives in ghetto and who is\nin the same situation. He has to go out of ghetto and he has no place to live. He\nwas very impractical man. We quickly changed apartments -- traded apartments\namong ourselves. We moved into Nowolipie 48.",
        "Q: Did your parents ever consider trying not to go?",
        "A: They were -- do you have my parents\u2019, my father\u2019s picture? He looks like,\nabsolutely, he\u2019s the quintessence of Jewish --.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: More than me. I\u2019m Jewish enough but he was more than me. He had too many\nacquaintances. He was well known among the people and it was too risky,\nabsolutely. They didn\u2019t take the -- it was a chance. They considered it but they\ndecided not. At the same time, my grandmother, I have two grandmothers; one\nfrom Lodz that I told you about, and the other is my father\u2019s mother. She lost her\nmind, she was very seriously mentally ill, very dangerous for herself. It was\nsomething very, very acute, acute illness. She -- you ask me about family?",
        "Q: Yeah, this is important.",
        "A: Well, on my father\u2019s side, his mother\u2019s family was manufacturers. Her father,\nbecause of -- it\u2019s too long story to go that far.",
        "Q: Well, whatever you want to tell me.",
        "A: He had to quit Poland because of -- as a young boy fourteen years old or in some\ncases eleven years old, in others fourteen years old because the Russians deported\nJewish young boys to make them -- young, strong, healthy boys to make them, to\ntake them to army and make them something, of special guards, special,\ncompletely, well -- I don\u2019t even understand it myself. It was something very\ndangerous and he had to escape at night, go through border. He lived in a small\ntown, the borders with Austria. His father got information by policeman that that\nnight there will be hunting for Jewish boys. In 15 minutes he left home with a\nfew rubles, whatever he had, they had at home. He went through the border and\nhe started his independent life and he worked for farmers. He works -- at last he\nworked in a manufacture of ribbons. When he grew up at the age of twenty and\nsomething, he returned home. But he didn\u2019t speak Polish, I don\u2019t know about his\nJewish but he spoke only German that time. My grandmother\u2019s family was\nbilingual. They spoke German at home and my grandmother was very, very\nfluent in German. Being so sick and out of mind, she used to open the windows\nand start the very, very convincing speeches to German people, to get rid of\nHitler.",
        "Q: Oh my God.",
        "A: It was very dangerous. It was very dangerous so my parents need to get to wire\nthe windows and she had to be put under constant supervision. But she didn\u2019t\ntrust anybody except me so I stayed with her day and night.",
        "Q: Was she dangerous? I mean, was she --?",
        "A: She was dangerous, she was dangerous.",
        "Q: I mean physically dangerous?",
        "A: Physically dangerous. She had hallucinations. She had some -- when something\ncame into her mind, she was dangerous because she believed that -- like seriously,\nmentally ill people, she was very --. It happened very sudden. After the whole --.\nBecause my father went for a war and there was no information what happened to\nhim for long time. My grandmother was pledged not to eat until he comes back.\nI don\u2019t know if she was sick then or she became sick because of emotions and --\nor of her pain but we had --. We stayed with grandmother. We had to keep her\nseparated from the world and at last, we had to put her into a hospital because the\nplace we got in, in ghetto, we divided with other relatives; another family of five\npeople. We had no room to keep grandmother safely. She went to hospital in\nSofiowka. It was in suburbs of Warsaw, Jewish hospital for mentally ill. Before\nthe hospital was --.",
        "Q: Liquidated?",
        "A: Liquidated, she took away her life. She died in December of 1940. We went to\nghetto. The first year of war was still normal life for me. I used to go\nunderground, no it wasn\u2019t even underground, to school. Because children in that\ntime were -- there was no statute to forbid children, Jewish children, to go to\nschool so I used to go to regular school. From 1940, from the summer of 1940,\nthe real war life started to me. Because everything changed. First with illness of\nmy grandmother, later in ghetto everything was completely different. In ghetto,\nwhen it came to ghetto, we started our -- went to the -- started meeting people\nfrom over there. We learned that that judge who lived in, who we traded\napartments, was a special person and his family was very, very unusual. They\nwere owners of the possession, of the land, owners of the building. They were\nowners of the lumber that was in, behind the building. It was very unusual and\nit\u2019s important to the part of my story. We moved Nowolipie. Around, we have\nregular buildings, three-four-story buildings like in crowded city streets but our\nbuilding was completely different. We had three courts, very long three courts. It\nwas very old part of farm, of plantation that existed in Warsaw few hundred years\nago. The people, the owners who were owners of plantation; they had plantation\nin the eastern part of Poland but they lost everything because of revolution, the\nRussian revolution in 1917, they returned to Warsaw and they treated the place\nthey lived like their plantation. They took care of people who lived there. They\ndidn\u2019t expect to be paid for rent because they treated them like --.",
        "Q: Serfs?",
        "A: Like serfs, no, they didn\u2019t expect any work. They had mentality of people of\nplantation. In the best sense of that word. You take care, they are your people,\nyou take care of them. They teach them, they give them help they need. If they\nneed medication, the mistress is there to --. They were absolutely crazy people.\nThey lived in poverty. Their apartment was never painted, nothing was repaired\nfor probably -- oh more than years. There was plenty of space but on the right\nside of those courts were sort of buildings two, three-story buildings; very\nprimitive but buildings. On the left side was sort of barracks. Like in the country,\nin the poor country dwellings. Keep it in mind because this is important. Lumber\nfactory in the back. When my father learned who the place belonged to; saint\npeople who took care of all poor, terribly poor Jewish, the poorest of the poor\nwho lived in this building, was sort of obligation, sort of challenge for us. In the\nsame apartment with us lived our, moved into the same apartment, moved our\nfamily. Two doctors, my father, two doctors and my father organized sort of\ncommunity association you can say it. It wasn\u2019t association but he was so\nconvincing that everybody tried to take care in improving our life in our building.\nHe built some grass, some places to play for children. He organized kitchens\nsoup-kitchens soup.",
        "Q: Soup kitchens.",
        "A: Soup kitchens for poor people. There was one prostitute who lived in the attic of\n--. Because it wasn\u2019t a building, it was something like rural, like rural house. The\nprostitute came once, I remember, she said, I earn money very easily so I can have\nmoney easily too but I can\u2019t have people to feed them. Because I work at my\napartment; this is my place of work. I will give money, whatever you need, but I\ncan\u2019t take people to, for dinners. Because people first sort of obligation and my\nfather was -- gave initiative to that everybody has to give once a week dinner for\nat least one person.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: Or give money, they can do it. I taught children, two girls from the -- I taught\nprogram of third class. I was then in high school. I should be in high school. So I\ntold them some, gave them some elementary program teaching. We became very,\nvery friendly with -- very, very close to those people in our building, in our\nneighborhood. We had books or some young people used to come over to borrow\nbooks. Doctors used to give medical help to people who lived in those barracks.",
        "Q: About how many people was this altogether?",
        "A: I tried to figure out but it 1s impossible. There were at least two parts of one --\nmaybe 12 apartments, 12 regular apartments, middle-sized, three, four rooms.\nProbably about 10 small apartments, one room, one kitchen in the barracks for ten\nfamilies. Maybe, one or two small stores or -- but people were crowded. There\nwere many, many people.",
        "Q: Probably couple hundred people, I would say.",
        "A: Probably couple hundred people but there weren\u2019t that many apartments. One of\nthose girls that I taught, her name was Fajga but I didn\u2019t feel Jewish. I, my\nmission was to keep those kids Polish. I didn\u2019t know Yiddish, I didn\u2019t, so one of\nthe girls promised to teach me Yiddish because some people didn\u2019t speak Polish.",
        "Q: They speak Yiddish?",
        "A: They speak Yiddish because they were very, very poor. Poor Jewish population\nof uneducated Jewish populations. Some blahas (?) or I remember but I don\u2019t\nknow what the word -- let me check. They discussed politics and everything in\nYiddish and they were different type than I knew before because they were real\nJewish population, Jewish proletarian. We were very, very close friends\nespecially with that girl, Fajga. Tinsmiths\u2019s work, tinsmiths, we don\u2019t, tin man,\nzinc, I don\u2019t know what the, they probably fixed pots, something like this, this\nkind of people.",
        "Q: So not a full-fledged tinsmith?",
        "A: No, no. They were extremely poor, extremely smelly, extremely ----. They were\nalways hungry, I know. I remember that my student, my pupil Fajga, how hungry\nshe was. How thin she was, how pale.",
        "Q: How did you manage to get food in the Warsaw ghetto?",
        "A: It was, if you had money, it wasn\u2019t hard to get food. My mother was a business\nwoman.",
        "Q: So she managed?\nA She managed and she didn\u2019t have any other ambition. She didn\u2019t have ambition\nto gather money; she had ambition to buy food and let people, let people, help\nsome people with feeding them. We had three meals daily. Not everybody was\nhungry in ghetto. There were people who were very rich in ghetto too. So we\nhad three meals and we had always two, three, four people who were regular\nboarders. Two uncles of my mother and I don\u2019t remember all of them because it\nchanged but we had always 12 people for every meal. Most of them were regular\nboarders. They didn\u2019t live with us but they used to eat with us. It was sort of help\nbecause it was fixed and it was -- they could trust.",
        "Q: They could rely on it?\nA They could rely but there were tragic situations. Behind every jolly and cheerful\nmeal that we tried to keep, there was always tragedy. One of my mother\u2019s uncles\nhad grown-up son who was mentally ill and not able to work and to do anything.\nHe had a -- my uncle had a girlfriend, not a wife, but sort of wife. He had a, we\ncall it, common-law-wife.",
        "Q: Common-law?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t come over for meals with us. I don\u2019t know -- it was impossible to feed\neverything, just impossible. It was very, very unpleasant situation of making\nchoices. It was a very bad part because my grandmother had bad feelings. Give\nthis, give him for Vera. Vera was the common-law wife. Give some food for\nJulek, his son. So whoever used to eat at our table had many people who should\nbe fed too. It was absolutely, it was absolutely impossible. It was always a\nchoice of every day. One day you could give them and other day you couldn\u2019t. It\nwasn\u2019t pleasant situation. It wasn\u2019t pleasant situation even for my mother\u2019s uncle\nbecause he wasn\u2019t hungry. I don\u2019t know but the art of life, of living in those days,\nwas not to talk about everything, to avoid negative talking.",
        "Q: What type of goods were available though? You said that food was available, I\nassume --.",
        "A: Of course, it wasn\u2019t any problem if you had money. It was a big market. The\nproblem was to get food in the nearest store. We had a very small store. In our\nhome, or maybe in the neighboring homes but the problem was, the art, the\nchallenge was, to buy a loaf of bread and take it home. Because the moment, the\nvery moment you left your -- the store, the beggars, the hungry people tried to ---.",
        "Q: Take it away?",
        "A: Take it away and they did. Most of the time, they did.",
        "Q: I assume that you did go out of this little enclave during your time in the ghetto.\nDo you want to discuss any of the things you might have seen? I mean anything\nyou witnessed while you were there?",
        "A: In the ghetto?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I want to tell you about two things. One about Fajga, I called her Frania but\nshe accepted it. I felt Polish and I tried to -- well I didn\u2019t understand the Jewish-\nPolish problems in those days. Eventually because her uncle was so poor, she had\nto be taken to Korczak Orphanage. I was over there and visited her. They didn\u2019t\n-- it was the most, most remembered by me experience, very, very touching thing\nto do. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t use the right word but something very inspiring going\nto Korczak Orphanage and taking --.",
        "Q: It was worth it.",
        "A: It was absolutely -- it was the place like a -- well, how do you call the place where\nEve and --.",
        "Q: Garden of Eden.",
        "A: Garden of Eden, Garden of Eden. So it was the last time I saw my Fajga, was in\nthe orphanage. Another thing I wanted to tell you was the girl from Austria. The\ngirl from Austria somehow lost her parents in, during the, in ghetto. She was my\nclassmate before the war. Her name was Ingeborga. We had friends, a few\nfriends who lived in ghetto tried to help her by making cigarettes and selling\ncigarettes and giving money to her. But any time I saw her, she was more like\nghost than not like living person. She didn\u2019t look like a living person. She went\nthough typhus, she went through hunger like it was in ghetto, it wasn\u2019t in a camp.\nBut there were places where people lived like, looked like skeletons. Her mind\nwas almost gone. But otherwise, there were some people who lived regular life\nmore or less.",
        "Q: I want to change tapes if that\u2019s okay with you.",
        "A: Okay.\n(End of Tape 1, Side B)",
        "A: There were stores full of food but food was very expensive. When I tell you that\nwe have three meals doesn\u2019t mean that we have meat every day. We didn\u2019t --.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I was wondering.",
        "A: It was a very simple food like -- but, well, comparing to people in the wartime, it\nwas food. There was always soup, there was some kasha, there was bread. You\ncould eat as much bread, as many slices as you like to. There was milk and butter\nonly for my father who had tuberculosis and for my small sister. But nobody was\nhungry, nobody was hungry and you had very, very --. From my point of view,\nthe life was very, very --. I can\u2019t say it because it can be misunderstood by people\nbut I enjoyed life. I was thirteen years old, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. I turned 14\nin July of 1942 and those two years were very happy years for me. I had the best\nfriend across the street. We spent most of the time together.",
        "Q: The images that I\u2019ve heard from anybody who\u2019s in the Warsaw ghetto was of\nleaving bodies out in the street, covered with newspaper and all that, I mean --?",
        "A: If you kept, well if you hear --. You ask the same question as my sons. How\ncould you say you were happy? I was happy. If you see something every day,\nevery minute, you are smart enough to turn your head away. The people who live\nin Washington, who get out of Metro every day are unhappy because they look at\nhomeless people? Are you unhappy because of that? It doesn\u2019t -- it make --.\nYou learn to keep your mind away from unpleasant things and think of that only\non special occasions. You do whatever you can do but you don\u2019t torture yourself\nthinking about it all the time. It was the same with me. I -- that\u2019s not that I was\nneutral, that I didn\u2019t see things. I see them all the time. I hear voices; I still hear\nvoices from beggars from ghetto and small dying children but at the same time I\nwas a happy child, very happy. I had my sister who was left to me and I used to\ntake her on long walks to discover the town. Ghetto was like Jerusalem. Ghetto\nwas very exotic place if you had some imagination, you were very young. You\nsaw so many different quarters, different people, different language that people\nspoke. I used to take her to very dangerous place, to Jewish cemetery. There was\nplace of trade between Aryan part of the town and Jewish part of the town, that\nwas what people called \u201cszmugiel\u201d. You know what\u2019s that --?",
        "Q: What is that? No.",
        "A: It\u2019s a word that I probably won\u2019t find here. It\u2019s a trade between, illegal trade\nbetween --.",
        "Q: Like the English word, smuggle?",
        "A: Smuggle, yes, oh the same word. But it was a very dangerous smuggle because\nwas constant shots with police, Jewish police and Polish police and German\ngendarmes chasing people. It was very dangerous but I didn\u2019t tell anybody and I\nused to take her. We had a great time, it was sort of excitement, of danger, of\nexcitement. We had a great time but one day she came home and she told. He\nwas taken to the Russian --.",
        "Q: We\u2019re talking about your father now. I just want to make it clear on the tape.",
        "A: Okay, okay. Now this is -- I will explain what happened. The history of my\nfather. He went to the army, he was in reserve. He didn\u2019t have to go but he\nwanted to. He was taken by Russian army in the eastern part of Poland and when\nhe was in convoy, the guard, the Russian officer or soldier, I don\u2019t remember\nwho, told him; you look Jewish to me. There\u2019s one thing I want you to know.\nThis is not Russia. Russia comes POW? (Intent is to say that it was the Russian\nguard who told my father that Russian authority was prejudiced against Jews and\ntherefore helped my father escape the convoy.)",
        "Q: POW, the labor camps?",
        "A: No, for soldiers, for army people.",
        "Q: I believe there are POW camps.",
        "A: POW camps. He had something to this effect in very, very short words because\nhe was -- my father was in convoy and he was a person who had kept convoy in\norder. In very few words, he said, you better escape. Go slower, slower and\nescape. So my father escaped and he --. We learned about that. He sent a letter\nto us and he stay on the Russian side of occupied Poland, in Lvov, in some places\nin that -- that were taken by Soviet Union. But he was very unhappy and very,\nvery lonely and in New Year\u2019s Night of 1939, he returned home. He went\nthrough, illegally through the border, passed the border and he returned home.\nWhen he came in into our apartment. My mother, instead of being happy, almost\npassed away from fear. Because it was the worst place to be for my father, was\nWarsaw. That night, or maybe the night before, eighty lawyers were arrested and\nsent to the concentration camp. In the beginning they arrested people from lists\nnot from --. My father came back and couldn\u2019t go out in street because his\nfeatures were so Jewish. He didn\u2019t want to wear Jewish armband. Every Jew was\nobligated to wear the armband. So he mostly stayed home and was very, very\ndepressed, extremely depressed. But coming back to my father, when we were in\n--.Well, there\u2019s nothing more to tell you about the life in the ghetto because I\nwould go on --.",
        "Q: How about if I ask you?",
        "A: If you ask, I will answer, of course.",
        "Q: Are there any other episodes or incidents beside from the two that you, the\nspecific two, that you told me that made such an impression on you? Any other\nimage that sand out in your mind of the time that you spent there.",
        "A: Well, once --. There were many but if I try to --. Well, the wailing of dying\npeople on the street; some beggars that were more -- they appealed more to my\nimagination. There was a father and two girls, two small girls and they begged\ntogether. They danced and they --. He looked like a well- educated person and\nsort of desperation. There were many things but I --. I remember my last\nbirthday party. My last birthday party was on July 10. It was 16 days before the\ninformation of, before the decision of the liquidation of ghetto. But somehow\nmost people who came for my birthday party, my parents\u2019 friends, were fully,\nfully aware of things that will happen very soon. It was very nice, very quiet,\nvery friendly, the real party.",
        "Q: Was it your 14\" birthday?",
        "A: Yes, but it was, first time I notice that people talk about things that they usually\ndidn\u2019t talk. They talk about our last meeting, about things that were nice in life,\nabout --. It was something like you go for burial and you are in funeral home, and\nyou are smiling but everything 1s very, very --. If you go for a funeral, a very sad\nfuneral, you know that it was not a regular funeral, but something like special\ntragedy. You try to pretend that everything will be okay. It was my last birthday\nparty. I was, then, I was treated like a grown-up person. First time in my life, I\nremembered that they didn\u2019t treat me like a child. It was then, no --. few days\nlater, my mother had a friend from her childhood. That friend had a younger\nsister who was paralyzed after that influenza.",
        "Q: Typhus?",
        "A: No. Childhood, you know --.",
        "Q: Oh, polio.",
        "A: Polio. In ghetto and she constantly had to eat something, to bite on something\nconstantly. She had some very, sort of --. She couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut. It\nwas something that they had to put something into her mouth. They didn\u2019t have\nanything. They were three women; mother, that friend of my mother, and that\nsick sister. They decided that since you get a loaf of bread for every, for each\nperson if you go from your own will to Umschlagplatz for so-called deportation,\nhow did they call it, not deportations, they called it change of place.",
        "Q: Yes, relocation.",
        "A: Relocation, she will do that. She came to say goodbye because we never see each\nother again. Because she couldn\u2019t leave that sister without food so she had to eat\nuntil she died. She put it very openly and said, oh my dear what are you talking.\nWhy are you talking such a nonsense? Everything will be okay. She looked at\nmy eyes and she treating me like a grown up person and she said, Dzidzia, don\u2019t\nbe a child, don\u2019t be stupid. She tried to push me to do something, to open my\neyes to the real life. From that time on, I remember that very well. I know that\nwe have always lived with open eyes because if you let our eyes to be naive, the\nlife is so terrible. Things are happening everywhere, it\u2019s so terrible. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter if it was in Holocaust. It might happen in China, everywhere.",
        "Q: Yugoslavia?",
        "A: Yugoslavia, everywhere. Well, there are many, many things, of course that I\nremember but some -- they come and they go away. They don\u2019t stay with me all\nthe time.\nQ Do you want to discuss what __",
        "A: And what happened, what happened? The great, great action started in ghetto.\nMy father didn\u2019t come back home in the evening of August 3, or maybe --\nbecause I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: In \u201842?",
        "A: Forty-two. I\u2019m not sure about dates. This is one thing. I read that book. It was a\n-- this is a -- 1t was written in when the things happened.",
        "Q: Yes, do you want to mention it in the tape?",
        "A: No, oh no. You don\u2019t have to, no. This is to tell you that I can\u2019t, he gives\ndifferent dates than I remember. He\u2019s probably right because he used to write day\nafter day and I --. But in my memory, I\u2019m talking about things that happened on\nAugust 3. My father didn\u2019t come back home. That evening, people on our street\nwere surrounded, rounded up and taken to Umschlagplatz but only people from\nstreet. They didn\u2019t go to houses, they didn\u2019t pick up people from the buildings,\njust from the street.",
        "Q: Took them off the street?",
        "A: From the street. It was the beginnings, it was the sort of --. It was the tenth day\nof \u201cgreat action\u201d. They call it in English, great action?",
        "Q: No, but I know what you\u2019re --.",
        "A: Because in Polish, it\u2019s -- has it\u2019s name. My father didn\u2019t come home. My mother\nwas devastated. The whole night she waited and packed things and knew things\nare going to the end. The end is very close. Next morning, my father came back.\nThe same thing happened to him when he was in a column. He was caught and he\nwas directed to Umschlagplatz in column of other people. When he passed the\nlast building, the street in front of him was deserted and he was close to pass the\nlast building; he decided to escape. I think there was sort of discussion between\nhim and the Jewish policeman. The Jewish policeman helped him. He closed his\neyes and my father escaped. He came back home and there was day almost like\nany other day. We started, was 2:00 or 2:30 in the afternoon and our house, or\nmaybe more houses but I know only about our house, was surrounded by --.\nThere was a whistle, very, very loud whistle in the courtyard and voice very, very\nharsh, and very, very loud ordering people to take his belongings, to take small\nbelongings, going down to the court. My father said that absolutely --. My\nfather, when he came home, he had some conversation with my mother that I\npicked up; that this is obviously the end. This is no, there is no doubt, they don\u2019t,\nthe destination of people is this. What I saw yesterday was like hell, it was\nobviously something --. People can\u2019t, you can\u2019t get caught and --. Well, we were\nordered to go down. My father was very quick not -- to call everybody in the\nhouse, all the relatives and tell to follow him. He started to -- but most of the\npeople, they were old people and there were at least ten people in the household.\nThey didn\u2019t want to be sent over to my father. They had good \u201causweisses\u201d\u2019, good\ndocuments or they didn\u2019t want to take any risk. They didn\u2019t go with us but my\nfather took mother, me, my mother, my sister, my grandmother and we all started\nto get out of the stairs. We met a Jewish policeman. Jewish policeman wanted to\nfollow him, asked us to follow him. Asked ! well I call it asked. He gave orders\nand my father said something brutal, in brutal way, fuck off or something like\nthis. He tried to pretend to be strong man and my father said I will kill you right\nhere if you don\u2019t let me pass you and he gave up. But it was only the beginning\nof hunting. There were one or two policemen in this building; the rest was\ncoming but they weren\u2019t there. So my father took us to those barracks. I told you\nthat in the same courtyard were small, small barracks. There was a ceiling,\nunderground ceiling, like in the peasants\u2019 homes in old days. We all -- he opened\nthe . Opening in the floor. The floor was wooden. He opened it.",
        "Q: A trap door?",
        "A: A trap door, yes. He tried to put us into that cellar. Was very, very small; of\ncourse, very small. There were 16 people already so it was --. People started to\nfight back. They didn\u2019t want us but my father was so determined with them like\nwith the policeman before. So we all went down and we settled down. My\ngrandmother was sick; she had asthma. She couldn\u2019t -- they were so, so crowded\nand no ventilation at all, no fresh air. My grandmother said, no I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t\nstand any moment longer, no more. She left the place but everything was decided\nin a second. It\u2019s much shorter period of time, moments. So grandmother went\nout, the trap went back. Somebody, I don\u2019t know who, I don\u2019t know if, somebody\nwas supposed to put a rug on top of that door trap. We stayed there, the air was\nstale. Little by little, people fainted. My sister fainted, my mother almost fainted.\nWe heard voices, we heard shots. It was long, long day. After many, many\nhours, it was quiet. My mother with her head, opened the trap a little bit to let the\nair come in. We spent there six or seven hours and in the evening somebody\ncame and started to call us to get out because everything is over. The building\nwas empty, almost nobody survived, everybody was taken. We went upstairs and\nthe whole apartment was looted. There was no food. My mother had some food\nstocked but there was no food. The prospects weren\u2019t very bright. This manner,\nwe spent three weeks. We had the last telephone in our -- well, this is what I\nknow about. This is not what I find in different --.",
        "Q: Accounts?",
        "A: Yes. But -- oh, something happened very important to us in history of our\nsurviving. One day there was telephone from telephone company. Young girl\nwith very small, shy low voice told my father she wanted to talk to my father.\nShe told him somebody has to pay a bill. If the bill won\u2019t be paid today, I will\nhave to turn off the telephone. The bill, it was sort of interesting thing for history\nof ghetto, the bills were not paid from ghetto because the post office didn\u2019t exist\nanymore. So it was a trap, Catch 22. My father called his friend out of ghetto and\nhe went and paid the bill so we had a telephone. The telephone saved the life of\nmany people. Because people could contact the outside world and make contacts,\nmake arrangements and save their life. It saved our loves too by -- just by sheer\naccident. Somebody called -- people made the meeting place in our house.\nMeeting place and they waited for message from outside world that were\nsupposed to come through our telephone. It was crowded, our house became very\ncrowded then. Nobody from our family except us were still living but new people\ncame from all over ghetto, whoever knew that there\u2019s such an apartment with\ntelephone. So we lived with strangers and once somebody called to -- somebody\ncalled somebody who was supposed to be in our home but he weren\u2019t and talked\nto my father. They were old colleagues, old friends, lawyer friends. That father\u2019s\nold friend told my father, if you get, find a way to get out of the ghetto, the rest\nleave to me. I will give you a helping hand but I can\u2019t help you to get out of\nghetto. It was some hope for my father who looked like 100 Jews in one, you\nknow, in person. Little by little, we left the ghetto through groups who worked\noutside the ghetto. They were counted by people and they were able to manage,\nto leave somebody outside. They bribed Polish policemen or whoever, I don\u2019t\nknow exactly. It was a big business. They made, it was a way of making money\nin those days. First they took my sister, One worker who worked outside, in the\ngroup outside the ghetto, took my sister as his daughter. Then I left. That\u2019s the\nend of my life in ghetto.",
        "Q: Where did you go?",
        "A: Where I -- I think --.",
        "Q: This was all in August, 1942?",
        "A: I left on August 16. It was August 16. I am sure about the date, My sister left a\nfew days earlier, Any time there was -- the Germans, not the Germans, mostly the\n--. Close the --. From raids, there were raids on the big scale, at least three in\nthose days between August 4 and August 16 when I left. In the beginning, we\nused to go to the same ceiling where we stayed first time. Later on it was, oh,\nlater on, we, for some reason, I don\u2019t remember why, those small ceilings became\ndangerous. My father, maybe there was no time. We spent nights at home\nwithout light, only in the dark to wash ourselves, to get something to eat. In\ndaytime, we didn\u2019t stay in our apartment. We stayed in the lumber factory. The\nlumber factory was in the back of the courtyard, our lot. Whoever survived those\nfirst -- whoever was alive stayed there. People talked and people -- I met very,\nvery interesting people over there. They were always in love, I was fourteen and I\nwas always in love. Since young men were mostly militia men so I was always in\nlove with some militia man. I found, since I was only 14 and not a woman but a\nchild, we were very good friends. They used to talk to me about this all. They\nwere very strange people. You don\u2019t know how far hypocrisy can go into the soul\nof people, they were murderers. They were helping hands of murderers. Every\nday they murdered hundreds of people but they didn\u2019t feel guilty. They always\ndid it for some better reason, to save their mother, to save their somebody, to help\nsomeone survive. It was interesting experience to talk to those people. One day I\nwas very close to death, the closest in my life, I never was so close o be caught\nlike that. The raid came suddenly with no -- we had no time to hide. Somebody\ntook my sister, a four- year old child with me and put lumber in front; put me\nbetween lumber, between boards, lumber boards. The Germans or Ukrainians\nwhoever they were, chasers, came and one board after another, they took away.\nThey were very, very close and my sister didn\u2019t, she fell asleep. She could wake\nup any second and they were so -- only one board was between us and them.\nThey went away and it was over. Once one of those, I don\u2019t know who were, who\nexactly who were, nationality is the wrong way to tell about them because they\nwere from many, many nationalities. There were, most of the time there were\nnon-Germans but from some groups from different, many, many countries. Sort\nof, do you know something about who they were?",
        "Q: Yes, these fascist groups, well I imagine many of them were Ukrainians.",
        "A: But not all of them, not all of them. This one whom I will talking about was\nprobably German, was probably some German soldier. He found, this was a very,\nred-haired, big blue-eyed girl who survived the first round-ups. She hid ina\nspecial kind of folding bed that don\u2019t exist any more. He opened the bed and the\neyes met, big blue eyes and nobody was in close vicinity. He shut that bed closed\nand said nobody\u2019s there and went away. It was interesting happening too. She\ndidn\u2019t know why, she couldn\u2019t understand. It was she herself who told us the\nstory. It was something she couldn\u2019t understand. So, now I\u2019m out of the ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay, I would like to know what happened for the rest of the war.\n\\",
        "A: Rest of the war. For next few months, I changed places. Nobody -- it was hard to\nfind any place to be safe for longer than a few weeks, or a few months, there was\nalways something. January 17 of 1943, our friends found places for us with a\nfamily who kept us from -- till the end of the war. So we spent there two years. I\nlived like Anne Frank, in the hiding. I didn\u2019t go out, I didn\u2019t see; we saw only\npeople who -- very, very, selected people who could come over and visit us. Our\ncontact with the outside world was very limited. We had one room, we lived\ntogether in one room, my parents and me. My sister was with foster family if you\ncan call it. Some friends of our family took my sister and she lived like -- almost\nnormal life in the suburban, in Milanowek, in the suburbs of Warsaw. With small\nchildren around because her foster parents had small children. First six months\nthat I lived out of ghetto --. The worst thing was my contact, my encounter with\nthe Aryan world, with the Warsaw that didn\u2019t exist for me, with the normal\npeople, normal life, normal life. People who had different scale value and\ndifferent needs. I couldn\u2019t, it was very hard to adjust. People who took me, the\nfirst people who took me and I spend few weeks with them, were cousins of my --\n, the nearest cousin of my mother. But they were transformed, they were different\npeople. They pretended not to be Jewish; they still pretend. They were\ncompletely different people. I had nothing in common with them. Everything\nturned, our friendship, our love, didn\u2019t survive the war. We didn\u2019t, we are not\nfriends any more. It\u2019s hard to say what happened, what happened was that they\ntried to become like other people. They tried to live in petty, small, petty\nproblems. I left my parents in ghetto and I didn\u2019t know if they were still alive. I\ncouldn\u2019t care for small things, I was one important burden that I --.Well, I wasn\u2019t\nalone over there because cousins, our cousin took another cousin who was young;\nI was 14, he was 17. Since the life, normal life and sun and smiling people and\nchitchat and things like that didn\u2019t -- were so distant to us, we used to keep\ntogether. We tried to be, well, there was --. They lived in the attic, they had very\nnice apartment in the upper --.",
        "Q: Penthouse, for instance?",
        "A: Yes, for, for --.\n(End of Side A, Tape IT)",
        "A: I will finish with that story about our cousins. There was an attic and we used to\ngo up to that attic. We didn\u2019t talk much but we just stayed, sit and be quiet. I\ndon\u2019t remember any conversation, any special conversation with him. My cousin,\nmy aunt or my cousin told me that this is a very inappropriate thing for a young\ngirl to be alone with a young man with no --. It was such a stupid thing. I was\nreally -- I felt terribly isolated. I felt terribly isolated because I didn\u2019t belong to\nthe world that she wanted to belong. Her father was in ghetto and he was one of\nthose constant boarders who always used to spend days with us. She never asked\nabout him. She wasn\u2019t interested. It was sort of self -- self defense. I am sure\nnow she wanted to be like other people. She didn\u2019t want to have father in ghetto\ndying in there, or maybe already dead, or in a transport in a - to Treblinka. She\ndidn\u2019t want it but I didn\u2019t want to listen about her new dress or a new fur or\nsomething like this. So I was very, very unhappy. I was unhappy but I don\u2019t\nthink I had the courage to say something. I really don\u2019t know. A few weeks later,\nthey found a place for me to stay. It was in the Warsaw suburbs; I don\u2019t\nremember even the name of the -- I forgot the name but it doesn\u2019t matter. The\nman who took me, took me only for money. He was an alcoholic. He treated his\nfamily very badly. They lived in very bad -- they were very primitive people.\nBut I don\u2019t think they were -- they weren\u2019t brutal, they didn\u2019t do anything bad,\nanything cruel for me. They were such a simpleton. My mother visited me there.\nMy mother didn\u2019t talk and didn\u2019t trust, instinctively didn\u2019t trust our\ncousins. She noticed the transformation; they were different people and she\ndidn\u2019t know how far they are able to go. Something opened, something different;\nthey were very close relatives and very close friends. But something strange,\nstrange feelings and mistrust, opened between my mother and my cousins. So\nthey didn\u2019t want to tell my mother where I am. At last my mother came. I have to\ntell you about how my mother left ghetto. I will finish this, okay?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My mother came and I went to meet her. It was only three weeks after I left\nghetto, three or four, very short time. We met on the road and I was like dead\ninside. I couldn\u2019t even be happy. It was -- I didn\u2019t feel my mother was coming. I\nwas like a living -- like somebody sucked away my feelings. It took some time,\nnot very long, maybe half an hour, maybe 15 minutes, before I started to feel\nhappiness and then it was absolutely great feeling to have my mother again.\nBecause I didn\u2019t think that we could survive. I left, no. This is something that I\nnever told anybody. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s very loyal to tell about\nother people. To tell how disaster makes people, divide people, divide close\npeople --. When I was in my cousins\u2019 apartment, 1t wasn\u2019t -- not very big\napartment; other people helped my parents to get out -- of ghetto. They -- the\ntelephone -- I said that the telephone was still working. The ghetto almost didn\u2019t\nexist but the telephone was working. So one of my father\u2019s, my parents\u2019 friends\ncame over and told me Dzidzia please, I want to talk in private with Lilusia.\nLilusia was cousin. I don\u2019t want you to be here because I have to tell something.\nWe have some things that grown-up people have to talk. I left the room but I\nknew that it was about my parents. I put my ear into a lock and I heard\neverything. He told, Mr. ---- I am saying his words. He said \u201cWladek, (my\nfather) he\u2019s crazy. They don\u2019t have any valuables, they don\u2019t have any valuable\nthings. They have little money, he looks like he looks and he want to leave the\nghetto. He\u2019s absolutely crazy. I don\u2019t know what, I can\u2019t figure out the way of\nhis thinking.\u201d It was quite cruel but it was the -- his intentions were good. He\ndidn\u2019t say this because he had something against my father\u2019s survival but he knew\nit was unrealistic. At least I knew my father, my parents were alive. By the same\nway, the same groups who worked outside ghetto, were still working outside\nghetto, were working for quite a long time, few months longer. First my mother,\nthen my father were transported through ghetto borders and they were also in the\nworking place outside the ghetto. Some friends of my parents came over and took\nthem to their house. It was act of courage like absolute heroism. They were\nheroes because it was obvious for people outside the ghetto, who my parents were\n-- the way they looked and the sort of the way they were dressed, it was\nabsolutely obvious. But from where my parents were outside in the safe place,\nthe other friend made first contact, who talk on the phone with my father and who\ngave him the idea that there\u2019s a chance for my father, took things in his hands and\nfound a place in Milanowek, in Warsaw suburbs. My parents were in Milanowek;\nI moved from one place to another for a few months. Some people were nice,\nsome people were scared; some people had tried but couldn\u2019t manage, it was too\nrisky Sometime people around started to talk about me; that there is something\nstrange with me, who I am, it\u2019s obvious who I am. It was obvious who I am. At\nlast, from January 17, 1943, we were together for two years, together with my\nparents. Those two years weren\u2019t bad.",
        "Q: Where were you?",
        "A: In Milanowek, in Warsaw suburbs. We spent two years in relative quiet, quiet\nenvironment, relatively quiet. We --.",
        "Q: Your sister was there too?",
        "A: No. My sister was --.",
        "Q: Oh, she was with the other people?",
        "A: The other people. On some occasions when there was some danger around, other\npeople used to take my sister to our place because it was in the same small town.\nBut it was rather rare. Most of the time, my sister was with, in the other place.\nWe weren\u2019t -- the people, Mr. and Mrs. Sokolowski is this name, they are both\ndead by now, only their daughter is alive. Their daughter was my friend. She4\nwas -- we were of the same age so we --. Mr. and Mrs. Sokolowski put some\nconditions. They took us under some conditions. We were not supposed to have\nguests, nobody was supposed to know our address and we were not supposed to\nleave the place. We had some false documents but my father when he got his --\nyou know what kennkarte was?",
        "Q: Yes, passport.",
        "A: When my father got his passport, his kennkarte, that was very hard to get one. At\nlast he received one, he had to sign it. He signed Wladyslew Winawer. His\nkennkarte was for different name but he -- it was disaster. But at the same time,\nwe knew that my father couldn\u2019t use that kennkarte, he simply couldn\u2019t use it.\nNobody would believe he was --.",
        "Q: Now this is a personal --. Was he circumcised?",
        "A: Yes, he was.",
        "Q: He was? So that would have been a problem?",
        "A: No, it couldn\u2019t have been any problem to know that more. It was sort of, really,\nno false hope. It\u2019s obvious that we can\u2019t lead any official life. There\u2019s no way for\nus to pretend that we live here, live there as tenants or something like that. But our\nMr. and Mrs. Sokolowski didn\u2019t believe, didn\u2019t, took us knowing that we are a --\nwait a second -- it was a death sentence. So thy built something sort of, the same\nthing that we had in our small barracks. They built sort of trap with covered\nentrance and any time they kept the house gated. The gate was always locked and\nany time somebody suspicious appeared at the gate, we\u2019re supposed to hide in the\ntrap. We did it; we learned how to do it very quickly. It was like a drill, like a\nmilitary drill. They were, they weren\u2019t like Polish people, Polish people are\nemotional, poorly organized. This is typical, this is what 1s typical in Polish\nculture and Polish --. But they were completely different. They had a very strong\nsense of responsibility and they knew the risk they taking and everything was\nperfectly well organized. Little by little, we had more and more things to take\nwith us, a radio and arms and many, many things because we were the safest\npeople to keep dangerous things. Because we weren\u2019t supposed to be taken to\nGestapo or to be tortured because Jews were killed on the spot. Since we, little by\nlittle we had more important things to hide with us, we felt more -- our life had\nmore value. We did something, we did something more than try to save our lives.\nComparing to the other people our life in hiding was very, very quiet and\nuneventful.",
        "Q: Were you in hiding, did you have any part in the Warsaw uprising towards the\nend or --?",
        "A: No, because we were 1n hiding.",
        "Q: So what happened? How were you liberated?",
        "A: When we liberated; we --. A few days later, my father was very sick. Well, those\n-- my father was depressed. He, in his character, he was able to do heroic acts but\nhe had no discipline like my mother, to stay quiet, to wait, to do routine things; he\nbecame depressed, he became so depressed, he didn\u2019t get up, he stayed in bed for\nweeks on. What turned out to be great, great help for his tuberculosis because this\nis the way that tuberculosis can be cured. So he survived. There were some bad\ntimes, sometimes he was very sick but all in all he, in the end of the war, he was\nmuch better than a few years earlier. He survived; I think what he did, he opened\nsort of Jewish ;place of Jewish, not council; Jewish, not gathering place; place\nthat you learn about other people who survived.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: Something, it wasn\u2019t any, it was spontaneous, it was something, it wasn\u2019t any\norganization in -- but it was the place where many people --. We moved from\nthat, our hiding place. We found an apartment very, very close, close by. People\nwho came from Russia, people who was leaving the hiding places, people who\ncame from camps, they came en masse to our place to talk about the way they\nsurvived, what happened to them, to ask about other people. It was unfortunate,\nwe didn\u2019t have anything like tape recorders, tape recorders like now. I didn\u2019t, I\ndon\u2019t remember --. Most of those exciting stories got lost.",
        "Q: The Russians are the ones who liberated you?",
        "A: The Russians on exact date, I\u2019m telling you the date because the date was very\nimportant, very, very meaningful in Poland. Because on January 17 of 1945, the\nRussians came. It\u2019s questionable if they liberated Poland but they liberated us,\nthat\u2019s for sure. It was exactly two years of living in the Mr. and Mrs.\nSokolowski\u2019s house.",
        "Q: After having escaped the ghetto. What about the Jewish uprising in the ghetto?\nDid you have any knowledge of that?",
        "A: Well, only I saw the fire and heard shots but --.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know anything about it?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know because I lived in suburbs. It wasn\u2019t close. It wasn\u2019t -- so people,\nmy husband, who wasn\u2019t Jewish, who lived next to ghetto and the neighboring\nstreet, to walls so his knowledge about uprising in ghetto is much more precise\nthan mine. Because he heard voices, he saw things that I didn\u2019t. I know it was,\naccording to his memory, it was something you can\u2019t forget.",
        "Q: Maybe he\u2019d like to talk about it some time.",

Because I think that my\nparents were more independent people than most people around. More free-\nthinking, free- thinkers, more -- well, better educated or something like this.\nMore open mind.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s formal education wasn\u2019t very, very high. She was an orphan, well\nnot complete orphan. Her father died when she was thirteen.

It was the end of the war, end of the First World War in 1917 and they went\nthrough a real terrible poverty. My mother was extremely brave and industrious\nand ambitious and beautiful. You can see now that she was a --. She didn\u2019t\naccept -- she was more like American women, not Polish. She was -- she didn\u2019t\naccept the whole situation of being poor and poorly educated and living in lower\nmiddle class family. She, as an extern, she tried to -- she got a high school\ndiploma but she didn\u2019t finish high school. She had diploma, went for exams,\nextern, is this the right word?

She was a -- she became a real -- she\ngot a real knowledge in art, especially in china, in oriental rugs. During the war,\nwhen we were alone and my father went to the army, she started buying and\nselling things. She sort of entered, this is how we survived the war because she\nwas able to earn money. After the war when it was forbidden and very, very\ndangerous, she did the same. So my parents were well-to-do people. I never went\nthrough, never is not the right word, but most of the war, most of the time, the\nwartime, we were well to do. We were well-to-do in the sense that we weren\u2019t\nhungry.

They were Protestants and they patronized, the\npatron of the school was that Protestant princess of the past. The school, Rey\nHigh School was very well established and often very high -- highly accepted\nschool. The Vasa School was more for girls but 1t was okay, was okay. The\natmosphere was very liberal.

It was a last visit like saying goodbye, and\nwe were very open with each other. He told me, it\u2019s very hard to explain but I felt\nmore Polish than Jewish. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with my religion.",

The book didn\u2019t belong to me; it belonged to my\nmother\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter and I was so scared, I didn\u2019t know what to do to hide\nthe book but those people didn\u2019t let me go without returning the book, I knew\nthat.

She didn\u2019t finish any school. She was very\nunbalanced, emotionally unbalanced. She had a very bad marriage. They were --\nher husband was communist and they were deported from France to Poland. My\nmother\u2019s sister with her small son, Claude came to stay with us for two weeks, for\nthree weeks. Part of the time my parents were out. This was the only time in my\nlife, I met my cousin Claude. He came from France. He hated everything Polish.\nHe -- looking at them I had a premonition of what will happen to us because they\nwere So poor, so -- they were deportees. They had no work -- his; Claude\u2019s\nparents, had no work. They didn\u2019t belong anywhere because they didn\u2019t belong to\nFrance, they didn\u2019t belong to Poland. They were victim of some social forces that\nwe became later. They perished in the, perished in Holocaust. They were in Lodz\nghetto and they perished and they probably were the first to die from hunger\nbecause they were not able to work. They were not able to work in normal\nconditions not only in Lodz ghetto which was terrible place to live in. That small\nchild, that Claude and my aunt, whom I didn\u2019t like and I didn\u2019t know well; I\nhardly knew them, never -- are still with me. I -- did you see the picture of Mr.\nLanzmann from Shoah?",

His name is Claude and he looks exactly like my cousin\nClaude because they were the same age, the same family, the same -- very similar\nkind of family, Polish emigrants. It\u2019s such a similarity between them. I can\u2019t ever\nforget them. My grandmother lived with is in Warsaw and during the time,\nwartime, she didn\u2019t get any letter from her daughter in Lodz ghetto. It was sort of\nconstant, constant tragedy that was killing her.",
        "A: I had something before my aunt Helenka and Claude came to visit us. I had\nanother experience with Nazism, not with Germans but Nazi Germany deported\nJews who were born in Poland in 1937. It was sort of obligation, sort of moral\nobligation of everybody who belonged to the Jewish, somehow to Jewish\ncommunity, to help them. My mother took a young girl, was maybe 19, maybe\n20, gave her a job of teaching me in German and sort of like being governess. It\nwasn\u2019t exactly governess but something like teacher and governess, something in\nbetween. She was boring, stupid and I didn\u2019t want to learn German but she was --\non the other hand, I knew she was so poor, she was so troubled. She didn\u2019t feel\nhappy, she was so out of place. It was bad experience but I thought that it\u2019s my\nfault.",

She was very poor and\nduring the war, I had a special relation with her but this is the story later. I will\ntell you later on. It was only two people I knew, two deportees I knew from\nGermany. I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t, we children didn\u2019t take German\nseriously. There was something so -- Poland was strong and prepared for war and\nthe whole world was supposed to help Poland. No, Germans were something to\nmake fun of. I was only ten and eleven.",

If you don\u2019t experience things like that, you can\u2019t --. They knew\nthat life would be very hard but there was always hope that the war won\u2019t break\nout. There was always hope that Hitler will stop. This was sort of loyalty. You\ncan\u2019t escape from place where the others have to live, you know. This is\nsomething not honorable.

He was in peak\nof his career; he was very well --. He had big clientele, he was very well known\nlawyer, hard working lawyer and very clever. My father said we have to go back\nto Warsaw. Things are getting dangerous. So he packed all of us into the small\ncar. We left everything that we had at home. Wasn\u2019t anything very valuable and\nwe went back to Warsaw. Next day, my father said to my mother, I love you all\nbut I love my country more; or something like this. He kissed us goodbye and\nwent to fight for the country. He left my mother with two years old and me and\neverything -- no money because somehow people weren\u2019t prepared. If he had\nanything, he didn\u2019t have it home -- maybe in bank, maybe clients were --. It was\na normal, regular life like every day, day like every day from financial point of\nview. It was a -- the war started this way for almost everybody with not mentally\nprepared for it, for the change. My mother and -- the bombardment started and\nthere was no food in the stores. The stores were shut closed. Well, every day was\nworse than the day before. My sister became ill, sick and she got a very high\nfever and she was dying.

        "A: It was Kapucynska Street. I lived on Kapucynska 15 in Warsaw. It was a very\nsmall street with dead end so the traffic was limited. It was inhabited mostly by\nlawyers because the court was very close --- the court and a land registry. I don\u2019t\nknow how you -- or whatever it is the place I --. Can you stop?",

I\ndon\u2019t remember why I told you that. I had some idea but I forgot so you can\nforget what --. But we came back home and -- oh, I know. On the first floor of\nthe same building, lived our aunt, my father\u2019s aunt. She was old lady with,\nwidow with two daughters. They had no children because she didn\u2019t like children\nand when my small sister, Kieia; she had nickname Kieia. Kieia became ill and\nwe lived on the third floor and bombardment became very frequent, we were\nforbidden to live upstairs. We couldn\u2019t stay in the basement all the time because\nof the small sick child so we asked that aunt to let us stay with her. She lived on\nthe second floor and she said no because I don\u2019t like children and sick children is\nsomething that I really hate. I couldn\u2019t believe she was my father\u2019s aunt.",
        "A: But before the war, she was extremely nice. She became -- she was very nice as\nlong as everything was planned and organized. She loved guests from five till\nseven every Tuesday and that\u2019s it. My mother was absolutely astonished .It was\nsomething unbelievable so we went down to the first floor to the neighbors who\nwere very unfriendly but he couldn\u2019t; he had no guts to say no. We spent part of\nthe September of 1939, this terrible -- you know what was September of \u201939 in\nPoland, in Warsaw?",
        "A: It was the beginning of the war. It was the bombardment of Warsaw. We spent in\n-- partly in the basement, partly in that neighbor\u2019s apartment. In the basement,\npeople prayed all the time and there I felt very tension between my mother and\nmy grandmother. She was strongly against accepting and being part of the\nprayers. She felt it was a time of trial and she felt that she is Jewish and she\ndidn\u2019t want to stay with these praying people. When the -- after the -- after\nWarsaw came into hands of Germans, my grandmother went back to Lodz. She\ncame, she was evacuated, deported in very brutal manner. She, some, not all\nJews, but some, I don\u2019t know why my grandmother, maybe old people, were\ndeported from Lodz, took to small towns. Because she had Jewish -- gmina,\nJudenrat, you know the word Judenrat?",

        "A: We went to ghetto in October of 1940.",

We\nwere in trouble because my parents had beautiful apartment with beautiful\nfurniture and charming place and everything. Somehow they couldn\u2019t find\nanybody to --. Jewish population outside the ghetto had to find place in the ghetto\ndistrict. People from Polish population from ghetto used to trade their apartments.\nIt was very unpleasant time because it was time for very easy quick bucks for,\nmostly for Polish people who lived in ghetto quarters. It was big, big, tension,\nbig, big -- the deadline was very close and we didn\u2019t have place to live. But at\nlast, in last minute, in the court, one of the -- well, clerks, law clerks told my\nfather, this judge who lives in ghetto, one of judges who lives in ghetto and who is\nin the same situation. He has to go out of ghetto and he has no place to live. He\nwas very impractical man. We quickly changed apartments -- traded apartments\namong ourselves. We moved into Nowolipie 48.",

They didn\u2019t take the -- it was a chance. They considered it but they\ndecided not. At the same time, my grandmother, I have two grandmothers; one\nfrom Lodz that I told you about, and the other is my father\u2019s mother. She lost her\nmind, she was very seriously mentally ill, very dangerous for herself. It was\nsomething very, very acute, acute illness. She -- you ask me about family?",
        "A: Well, on my father\u2019s side, his mother\u2019s family was manufacturers. Her father,\nbecause of -- it\u2019s too long story to go that far.",
        "A: He had to quit Poland because of -- as a young boy fourteen years old or in some\ncases eleven years old, in others fourteen years old because the Russians deported\nJewish young boys to make them -- young, strong, healthy boys to make them, to\ntake them to army and make them something, of special guards, special,\ncompletely, well -- I don\u2019t even understand it myself. It was something very\ndangerous and he had to escape at night, go through border. He lived in a small\ntown, the borders with Austria. His father got information by policeman that that\nnight there will be hunting for Jewish boys. In 15 minutes he left home with a\nfew rubles, whatever he had, they had at home. He went through the border and\nhe started his independent life and he worked for farmers. He works -- at last he\nworked in a manufacture of ribbons. When he grew up at the age of twenty and\nsomething, he returned home. But he didn\u2019t speak Polish, I don\u2019t know about his\nJewish but he spoke only German that time. My grandmother\u2019s family was\nbilingual. They spoke German at home and my grandmother was very, very\nfluent in German. Being so sick and out of mind, she used to open the windows\nand start the very, very convincing speeches to German people, to get rid of\nHitler.",
        "A: It was very dangerous. It was very dangerous so my parents need to get to wire\nthe windows and she had to be put under constant supervision. But she didn\u2019t\ntrust anybody except me so I stayed with her day and night.",
        "A: She was dangerous, she was dangerous.",
        "A: Physically dangerous. She had hallucinations. She had some -- when something\ncame into her mind, she was dangerous because she believed that -- like seriously,\nmentally ill people, she was very --. It happened very sudden. After the whole --.\nBecause my father went for a war and there was no information what happened to\nhim for long time. My grandmother was pledged not to eat until he comes back.\nI don\u2019t know if she was sick then or she became sick because of emotions and --\nor of her pain but we had --. We stayed with grandmother. We had to keep her\nseparated from the world and at last, we had to put her into a hospital because the\nplace we got in, in ghetto, we divided with other relatives; another family of five\npeople. We had no room to keep grandmother safely. She went to hospital in\nSofiowka. It was in suburbs of Warsaw, Jewish hospital for mentally ill. Before\nthe hospital was --.",
        "A: Liquidated, she took away her life. She died in December of 1940. We went to\nghetto. The first year of war was still normal life for me. I used to go\nunderground, no it wasn\u2019t even underground, to school. Because children in that\ntime were -- there was no statute to forbid children, Jewish children, to go to\nschool so I used to go to regular school. From 1940, from the summer of 1940,\nthe real war life started to me. Because everything changed. First with illness of\nmy grandmother, later in ghetto everything was completely different. In ghetto,\nwhen it came to ghetto, we started our -- went to the -- started meeting people\nfrom over there. We learned that that judge who lived in, who we traded\napartments, was a special person and his family was very, very unusual. They\nwere owners of the possession, of the land, owners of the building. They were\nowners of the lumber that was in, behind the building. It was very unusual and\nit\u2019s important to the part of my story. We moved Nowolipie. Around, we have\nregular buildings, three-four-story buildings like in crowded city streets but our\nbuilding was completely different. We had three courts, very long three courts. It\nwas very old part of farm, of plantation that existed in Warsaw few hundred years\nago. The people, the owners who were owners of plantation; they had plantation\nin the eastern part of Poland but they lost everything because of revolution, the\nRussian revolution in 1917, they returned to Warsaw and they treated the place\nthey lived like their plantation. They took care of people who lived there. They\ndidn\u2019t expect to be paid for rent because they treated them like --.",
        "A: Like serfs, no, they didn\u2019t expect any work. They had mentality of people of\nplantation. In the best sense of that word. You take care, they are your people,\nyou take care of them. They teach them, they give them help they need. If they\nneed medication, the mistress is there to --. They were absolutely crazy people.\nThey lived in poverty. Their apartment was never painted, nothing was repaired\nfor probably -- oh more than years. There was plenty of space but on the right\nside of those courts were sort of buildings two, three-story buildings; very\nprimitive but buildings. On the left side was sort of barracks. Like in the country,\nin the poor country dwellings. Keep it in mind because this is important. Lumber\nfactory in the back. When my father learned who the place belonged to; saint\npeople who took care of all poor, terribly poor Jewish, the poorest of the poor\nwho lived in this building, was sort of obligation, sort of challenge for us. In the\nsame apartment with us lived our, moved into the same apartment, moved our\nfamily. Two doctors, my father, two doctors and my father organized sort of\ncommunity association you can say it. It wasn\u2019t association but he was so\nconvincing that everybody tried to take care in improving our life in our building.\nHe built some grass, some places to play for children. He organized kitchens\nsoup-kitchens soup.",
        "A: Soup kitchens for poor people. There was one prostitute who lived in the attic of\n--. Because it wasn\u2019t a building, it was something like rural, like rural house. The\nprostitute came once, I remember, she said, I earn money very easily so I can have\nmoney easily too but I can\u2019t have people to feed them. Because I work at my\napartment; this is my place of work. I will give money, whatever you need, but I\ncan\u2019t take people to, for dinners. Because people first sort of obligation and my\nfather was -- gave initiative to that everybody has to give once a week dinner for\nat least one person.",
        "A: Or give money, they can do it. I taught children, two girls from the -- I taught\nprogram of third class. I was then in high school. I should be in high school. So I\ntold them some, gave them some elementary program teaching. We became very,\nvery friendly with -- very, very close to those people in our building, in our\nneighborhood. We had books or some young people used to come over to borrow\nbooks. Doctors used to give medical help to people who lived in those barracks.",
        "A: I tried to figure out but it 1s impossible. There were at least two parts of one --\nmaybe 12 apartments, 12 regular apartments, middle-sized, three, four rooms.\nProbably about 10 small apartments, one room, one kitchen in the barracks for ten\nfamilies. Maybe, one or two small stores or -- but people were crowded. There\nwere many, many people.",
        "A: Probably couple hundred people but there weren\u2019t that many apartments. One of\nthose girls that I taught, her name was Fajga but I didn\u2019t feel Jewish. I, my\nmission was to keep those kids Polish. I didn\u2019t know Yiddish, I didn\u2019t, so one of\nthe girls promised to teach me Yiddish because some people didn\u2019t speak Polish.",
        "A: They speak Yiddish because they were very, very poor. Poor Jewish population\nof uneducated Jewish populations. Some blahas (?) or I remember but I don\u2019t\nknow what the word -- let me check. They discussed politics and everything in\nYiddish and they were different type than I knew before because they were real\nJewish population, Jewish proletarian. We were very, very close friends\nespecially with that girl, Fajga. Tinsmiths\u2019s work, tinsmiths, we don\u2019t, tin man,\nzinc, I don\u2019t know what the, they probably fixed pots, something like this, this\nkind of people.",
        "A: No, no. They were extremely poor, extremely smelly, extremely ----. They were\nalways hungry, I know. I remember that my student, my pupil Fajga, how hungry\nshe was. How thin she was, how pale.",
        "A: It was, if you had money, it wasn\u2019t hard to get food. My mother was a business\nwoman.\nA She managed and she didn\u2019t have any other ambition. She didn\u2019t have ambition\nto gather money; she had ambition to buy food and let people, let people, help\nsome people with feeding them. We had three meals daily. Not everybody was\nhungry in ghetto. There were people who were very rich in ghetto too. So we\nhad three meals and we had always two, three, four people who were regular\nboarders. Two uncles of my mother and I don\u2019t remember all of them because it\nchanged but we had always 12 people for every meal. Most of them were regular\nboarders. They didn\u2019t live with us but they used to eat with us. It was sort of help\nbecause it was fixed and it was -- they could trust.\nA They could rely but there were tragic situations. Behind every jolly and cheerful\nmeal that we tried to keep, there was always tragedy. One of my mother\u2019s uncles\nhad grown-up son who was mentally ill and not able to work and to do anything.\nHe had a -- my uncle had a girlfriend, not a wife, but sort of wife. He had a, we\ncall it, common-law-wife.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t come over for meals with us. I don\u2019t know -- it was impossible to feed\neverything, just impossible. It was very, very unpleasant situation of making\nchoices. It was a very bad part because my grandmother had bad feelings. Give\nthis, give him for Vera. Vera was the common-law wife. Give some food for\nJulek, his son. So whoever used to eat at our table had many people who should\nbe fed too. It was absolutely, it was absolutely impossible. It was always a\nchoice of every day. One day you could give them and other day you couldn\u2019t. It\nwasn\u2019t pleasant situation. It wasn\u2019t pleasant situation even for my mother\u2019s uncle\nbecause he wasn\u2019t hungry. I don\u2019t know but the art of life, of living in those days,\nwas not to talk about everything, to avoid negative talking.",
        "A: Of course, it wasn\u2019t any problem if you had money. It was a big market. The\nproblem was to get food in the nearest store. We had a very small store. In our\nhome, or maybe in the neighboring homes but the problem was, the art, the\nchallenge was, to buy a loaf of bread and take it home. Because the moment, the\nvery moment you left your -- the store, the beggars, the hungry people tried to ---.",
        "A: Take it away and they did. Most of the time, they did.",
        "A: In the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, I want to tell you about two things. One about Fajga, I called her Frania but\nshe accepted it. I felt Polish and I tried to -- well I didn\u2019t understand the Jewish-\nPolish problems in those days. Eventually because her uncle was so poor, she had\nto be taken to Korczak Orphanage. I was over there and visited her. They didn\u2019t\n-- it was the most, most remembered by me experience, very, very touching thing\nto do. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t use the right word but something very inspiring going\nto Korczak Orphanage and taking --.",
        "A: It was absolutely -- it was the place like a -- well, how do you call the place where\nEve and --.",
        "A: Garden of Eden, Garden of Eden. So it was the last time I saw my Fajga, was in\nthe orphanage. Another thing I wanted to tell you was the girl from Austria. The\ngirl from Austria somehow lost her parents in, during the, in ghetto. She was my\nclassmate before the war. Her name was Ingeborga. We had friends, a few\nfriends who lived in ghetto tried to help her by making cigarettes and selling\ncigarettes and giving money to her. But any time I saw her, she was more like\nghost than not like living person. She didn\u2019t look like a living person. She went\nthough typhus, she went through hunger like it was in ghetto, it wasn\u2019t in a camp.\nBut there were places where people lived like, looked like skeletons. Her mind\nwas almost gone. But otherwise, there were some people who lived regular life\nmore or less.",
        "A: Okay.\n(End of Tape 1, Side B)",
        "A: There were stores full of food but food was very expensive. When I tell you that\nwe have three meals doesn\u2019t mean that we have meat every day. We didn\u2019t --.",
        "A: It was a very simple food like -- but, well, comparing to people in the wartime, it\nwas food. There was always soup, there was some kasha, there was bread. You\ncould eat as much bread, as many slices as you like to. There was milk and butter\nonly for my father who had tuberculosis and for my small sister. But nobody was\nhungry, nobody was hungry and you had very, very --. From my point of view,\nthe life was very, very --. I can\u2019t say it because it can be misunderstood by people\nbut I enjoyed life. I was thirteen years old, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. I turned 14\nin July of 1942 and those two years were very happy years for me. I had the best\nfriend across the street. We spent most of the time together.",
        "A: If you kept, well if you hear --. You ask the same question as my sons. How\ncould you say you were happy? I was happy. If you see something every day,\nevery minute, you are smart enough to turn your head away. The people who live\nin Washington, who get out of Metro every day are unhappy because they look at\nhomeless people? Are you unhappy because of that? It doesn\u2019t -- it make --.\nYou learn to keep your mind away from unpleasant things and think of that only\non special occasions. You do whatever you can do but you don\u2019t torture yourself\nthinking about it all the time. It was the same with me. I -- that\u2019s not that I was\nneutral, that I didn\u2019t see things. I see them all the time. I hear voices; I still hear\nvoices from beggars from ghetto and small dying children but at the same time I\nwas a happy child, very happy. I had my sister who was left to me and I used to\ntake her on long walks to discover the town. Ghetto was like Jerusalem. Ghetto\nwas very exotic place if you had some imagination, you were very young. You\nsaw so many different quarters, different people, different language that people\nspoke. I used to take her to very dangerous place, to Jewish cemetery. There was\nplace of trade between Aryan part of the town and Jewish part of the town, that\nwas what people called \u201cszmugiel\u201d. You know what\u2019s that --?",
        "A: It\u2019s a word that I probably won\u2019t find here. It\u2019s a trade between, illegal trade\nbetween --.",
        "A: Smuggle, yes, oh the same word. But it was a very dangerous smuggle because\nwas constant shots with police, Jewish police and Polish police and German\ngendarmes chasing people. It was very dangerous but I didn\u2019t tell anybody and I\nused to take her. We had a great time, it was sort of excitement, of danger, of\nexcitement. We had a great time but one day she came home and she told. He\nwas taken to the Russian --.",
        "A: Okay, okay. Now this is -- I will explain what happened. The history of my\nfather. He went to the army, he was in reserve. He didn\u2019t have to go but he\nwanted to. He was taken by Russian army in the eastern part of Poland and when\nhe was in convoy, the guard, the Russian officer or soldier, I don\u2019t remember\nwho, told him; you look Jewish to me. There\u2019s one thing I want you to know.\nThis is not Russia. Russia comes POW? (Intent is to say that it was the Russian\nguard who told my father that Russian authority was prejudiced against Jews and\ntherefore helped my father escape the convoy.)",
        "A: No, for soldiers, for army people.",
        "A: POW camps. He had something to this effect in very, very short words because\nhe was -- my father was in convoy and he was a person who had kept convoy in\norder. In very few words, he said, you better escape. Go slower, slower and\nescape. So my father escaped and he --. We learned about that. He sent a letter\nto us and he stay on the Russian side of occupied Poland, in Lvov, in some places\nin that -- that were taken by Soviet Union. But he was very unhappy and very,\nvery lonely and in New Year\u2019s Night of 1939, he returned home. He went\nthrough, illegally through the border, passed the border and he returned home.\nWhen he came in into our apartment. My mother, instead of being happy, almost\npassed away from fear. Because it was the worst place to be for my father, was\nWarsaw. That night, or maybe the night before, eighty lawyers were arrested and\nsent to the concentration camp. In the beginning they arrested people from lists\nnot from --. My father came back and couldn\u2019t go out in street because his\nfeatures were so Jewish. He didn\u2019t want to wear Jewish armband. Every Jew was\nobligated to wear the armband. So he mostly stayed home and was very, very\ndepressed, extremely depressed. But coming back to my father, when we were in\n--.Well, there\u2019s nothing more to tell you about the life in the ghetto because I\nwould go on --.",
        "A: If you ask, I will answer, of course.",
        "A: Well, once --. There were many but if I try to --. Well, the wailing of dying\npeople on the street; some beggars that were more -- they appealed more to my\nimagination. There was a father and two girls, two small girls and they begged\ntogether. They danced and they --. He looked like a well- educated person and\nsort of desperation. There were many things but I --. I remember my last\nbirthday party. My last birthday party was on July 10. It was 16 days before the\ninformation of, before the decision of the liquidation of ghetto. But somehow\nmost people who came for my birthday party, my parents\u2019 friends, were fully,\nfully aware of things that will happen very soon. It was very nice, very quiet,\nvery friendly, the real party.",
        "A: Yes, but it was, first time I notice that people talk about things that they usually\ndidn\u2019t talk. They talk about our last meeting, about things that were nice in life,\nabout --. It was something like you go for burial and you are in funeral home, and\nyou are smiling but everything 1s very, very --. If you go for a funeral, a very sad\nfuneral, you know that it was not a regular funeral, but something like special\ntragedy. You try to pretend that everything will be okay. It was my last birthday\nparty. I was, then, I was treated like a grown-up person. First time in my life, I\nremembered that they didn\u2019t treat me like a child. It was then, no --. few days\nlater, my mother had a friend from her childhood. That friend had a younger\nsister who was paralyzed after that influenza.",
        "A: No. Childhood, you know --.",
        "A: Polio. In ghetto and she constantly had to eat something, to bite on something\nconstantly. She had some very, sort of --. She couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut. It\nwas something that they had to put something into her mouth. They didn\u2019t have\nanything. They were three women; mother, that friend of my mother, and that\nsick sister. They decided that since you get a loaf of bread for every, for each\nperson if you go from your own will to Umschlagplatz for so-called deportation,\nhow did they call it, not deportations, they called it change of place.",
        "A: Relocation, she will do that. She came to say goodbye because we never see each\nother again. Because she couldn\u2019t leave that sister without food so she had to eat\nuntil she died. She put it very openly and said, oh my dear what are you talking.\nWhy are you talking such a nonsense? Everything will be okay. She looked at\nmy eyes and she treating me like a grown up person and she said, Dzidzia, don\u2019t\nbe a child, don\u2019t be stupid. She tried to push me to do something, to open my\neyes to the real life. From that time on, I remember that very well. I know that\nwe have always lived with open eyes because if you let our eyes to be naive, the\nlife is so terrible. Things are happening everywhere, it\u2019s so terrible. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter if it was in Holocaust. It might happen in China, everywhere.",
        "A: Yugoslavia, everywhere. Well, there are many, many things, of course that I\nremember but some -- they come and they go away. They don\u2019t stay with me all\nthe time.\nQ Do you want to discuss what __",
        "A: And what happened, what happened? The great, great action started in ghetto.\nMy father didn\u2019t come back home in the evening of August 3, or maybe --\nbecause I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: Forty-two. I\u2019m not sure about dates. This is one thing. I read that book. It was a\n-- this is a -- 1t was written in when the things happened.",
        "A: No, oh no. You don\u2019t have to, no. This is to tell you that I can\u2019t, he gives\ndifferent dates than I remember. He\u2019s probably right because he used to write day\nafter day and I --. But in my memory, I\u2019m talking about things that happened on\nAugust 3. My father didn\u2019t come back home. That evening, people on our street\nwere surrounded, rounded up and taken to Umschlagplatz but only people from\nstreet. They didn\u2019t go to houses, they didn\u2019t pick up people from the buildings,\njust from the street.",
        "A: From the street. It was the beginnings, it was the sort of --. It was the tenth day\nof \u201cgreat action\u201d. They call it in English, great action?",
        "A: Because in Polish, it\u2019s -- has it\u2019s name. My father didn\u2019t come home. My mother\nwas devastated. The whole night she waited and packed things and knew things\nare going to the end. The end is very close. Next morning, my father came back.\nThe same thing happened to him when he was in a column. He was caught and he\nwas directed to Umschlagplatz in column of other people. When he passed the\nlast building, the street in front of him was deserted and he was close to pass the\nlast building; he decided to escape. I think there was sort of discussion between\nhim and the Jewish policeman. The Jewish policeman helped him. He closed his\neyes and my father escaped. He came back home and there was day almost like\nany other day. We started, was 2:00 or 2:30 in the afternoon and our house, or\nmaybe more houses but I know only about our house, was surrounded by --.\nThere was a whistle, very, very loud whistle in the courtyard and voice very, very\nharsh, and very, very loud ordering people to take his belongings, to take small\nbelongings, going down to the court. My father said that absolutely --. My\nfather, when he came home, he had some conversation with my mother that I\npicked up; that this is obviously the end. This is no, there is no doubt, they don\u2019t,\nthe destination of people is this. What I saw yesterday was like hell, it was\nobviously something --. People can\u2019t, you can\u2019t get caught and --. Well, we were\nordered to go down. My father was very quick not -- to call everybody in the\nhouse, all the relatives and tell to follow him. He started to -- but most of the\npeople, they were old people and there were at least ten people in the household.\nThey didn\u2019t want to be sent over to my father. They had good \u201causweisses\u201d\u2019, good\ndocuments or they didn\u2019t want to take any risk. They didn\u2019t go with us but my\nfather took mother, me, my mother, my sister, my grandmother and we all started\nto get out of the stairs. We met a Jewish policeman. Jewish policeman wanted to\nfollow him, asked us to follow him. Asked ! well I call it asked. He gave orders\nand my father said something brutal, in brutal way, fuck off or something like\nthis. He tried to pretend to be strong man and my father said I will kill you right\nhere if you don\u2019t let me pass you and he gave up. But it was only the beginning\nof hunting. There were one or two policemen in this building; the rest was\ncoming but they weren\u2019t there. So my father took us to those barracks. I told you\nthat in the same courtyard were small, small barracks. There was a ceiling,\nunderground ceiling, like in the peasants\u2019 homes in old days. We all -- he opened\nthe . Opening in the floor. The floor was wooden. He opened it.",
        "A: A trap door, yes. He tried to put us into that cellar. Was very, very small; of\ncourse, very small. There were 16 people already so it was --. People started to\nfight back. They didn\u2019t want us but my father was so determined with them like\nwith the policeman before. So we all went down and we settled down. My\ngrandmother was sick; she had asthma. She couldn\u2019t -- they were so, so crowded\nand no ventilation at all, no fresh air. My grandmother said, no I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t\nstand any moment longer, no more. She left the place but everything was decided\nin a second. It\u2019s much shorter period of time, moments. So grandmother went\nout, the trap went back. Somebody, I don\u2019t know who, I don\u2019t know if, somebody\nwas supposed to put a rug on top of that door trap. We stayed there, the air was\nstale. Little by little, people fainted. My sister fainted, my mother almost fainted.\nWe heard voices, we heard shots. It was long, long day. After many, many\nhours, it was quiet. My mother with her head, opened the trap a little bit to let the\nair come in. We spent there six or seven hours and in the evening somebody\ncame and started to call us to get out because everything is over. The building\nwas empty, almost nobody survived, everybody was taken. We went upstairs and\nthe whole apartment was looted. There was no food. My mother had some food\nstocked but there was no food. The prospects weren\u2019t very bright. This manner,\nwe spent three weeks. We had the last telephone in our -- well, this is what I\nknow about. This is not what I find in different --.",
        "A: Yes. But -- oh, something happened very important to us in history of our\nsurviving. One day there was telephone from telephone company. Young girl\nwith very small, shy low voice told my father she wanted to talk to my father.\nShe told him somebody has to pay a bill. If the bill won\u2019t be paid today, I will\nhave to turn off the telephone. The bill, it was sort of interesting thing for history\nof ghetto, the bills were not paid from ghetto because the post office didn\u2019t exist\nanymore. So it was a trap, Catch 22. My father called his friend out of ghetto and\nhe went and paid the bill so we had a telephone. The telephone saved the life of\nmany people. Because people could contact the outside world and make contacts,\nmake arrangements and save their life. It saved our loves too by -- just by sheer\naccident. Somebody called -- people made the meeting place in our house.\nMeeting place and they waited for message from outside world that were\nsupposed to come through our telephone. It was crowded, our house became very\ncrowded then. Nobody from our family except us were still living but new people\ncame from all over ghetto, whoever knew that there\u2019s such an apartment with\ntelephone. So we lived with strangers and once somebody called to -- somebody\ncalled somebody who was supposed to be in our home but he weren\u2019t and talked\nto my father. They were old colleagues, old friends, lawyer friends. That father\u2019s\nold friend told my father, if you get, find a way to get out of the ghetto, the rest\nleave to me. I will give you a helping hand but I can\u2019t help you to get out of\nghetto. It was some hope for my father who looked like 100 Jews in one, you\nknow, in person. Little by little, we left the ghetto through groups who worked\noutside the ghetto. They were counted by people and they were able to manage,\nto leave somebody outside. They bribed Polish policemen or whoever, I don\u2019t\nknow exactly. It was a big business. They made, it was a way of making money\nin those days. First they took my sister, One worker who worked outside, in the\ngroup outside the ghetto, took my sister as his daughter. Then I left. That\u2019s the\nend of my life in ghetto.",
        "A: Where I -- I think --.",
        "A: I left on August 16. It was August 16. I am sure about the date, My sister left a\nfew days earlier, Any time there was -- the Germans, not the Germans, mostly the\n--. Close the --. From raids, there were raids on the big scale, at least three in\nthose days between August 4 and August 16 when I left. In the beginning, we\nused to go to the same ceiling where we stayed first time. Later on it was, oh,\nlater on, we, for some reason, I don\u2019t remember why, those small ceilings became\ndangerous. My father, maybe there was no time. We spent nights at home\nwithout light, only in the dark to wash ourselves, to get something to eat. In\ndaytime, we didn\u2019t stay in our apartment. We stayed in the lumber factory. The\nlumber factory was in the back of the courtyard, our lot. Whoever survived those\nfirst -- whoever was alive stayed there. People talked and people -- I met very,\nvery interesting people over there. They were always in love, I was fourteen and I\nwas always in love. Since young men were mostly militia men so I was always in\nlove with some militia man. I found, since I was only 14 and not a woman but a\nchild, we were very good friends. They used to talk to me about this all. They\nwere very strange people. You don\u2019t know how far hypocrisy can go into the soul\nof people, they were murderers. They were helping hands of murderers. Every\nday they murdered hundreds of people but they didn\u2019t feel guilty. They always\ndid it for some better reason, to save their mother, to save their somebody, to help\nsomeone survive. It was interesting experience to talk to those people. One day I\nwas very close to death, the closest in my life, I never was so close o be caught\nlike that. The raid came suddenly with no -- we had no time to hide. Somebody\ntook my sister, a four- year old child with me and put lumber in front; put me\nbetween lumber, between boards, lumber boards. The Germans or Ukrainians\nwhoever they were, chasers, came and one board after another, they took away.\nThey were very, very close and my sister didn\u2019t, she fell asleep. She could wake\nup any second and they were so -- only one board was between us and them.\nThey went away and it was over. Once one of those, I don\u2019t know who were, who\nexactly who were, nationality is the wrong way to tell about them because they\nwere from many, many nationalities. There were, most of the time there were\nnon-Germans but from some groups from different, many, many countries. Sort\nof, do you know something about who they were?",
        "A: But not all of them, not all of them. This one whom I will talking about was\nprobably German, was probably some German soldier. He found, this was a very,\nred-haired, big blue-eyed girl who survived the first round-ups. She hid ina\nspecial kind of folding bed that don\u2019t exist any more. He opened the bed and the\neyes met, big blue eyes and nobody was in close vicinity. He shut that bed closed\nand said nobody\u2019s there and went away. It was interesting happening too. She\ndidn\u2019t know why, she couldn\u2019t understand. It was she herself who told us the\nstory. It was something she couldn\u2019t understand. So, now I\u2019m out of the ghetto.\n\\",
        "A: Rest of the war. For next few months, I changed places. Nobody -- it was hard to\nfind any place to be safe for longer than a few weeks, or a few months, there was\nalways something. January 17 of 1943, our friends found places for us with a\nfamily who kept us from -- till the end of the war. So we spent there two years. I\nlived like Anne Frank, in the hiding. I didn\u2019t go out, I didn\u2019t see; we saw only\npeople who -- very, very, selected people who could come over and visit us. Our\ncontact with the outside world was very limited. We had one room, we lived\ntogether in one room, my parents and me. My sister was with foster family if you\ncan call it. Some friends of our family took my sister and she lived like -- almost\nnormal life in the suburban, in Milanowek, in the suburbs of Warsaw. With small\nchildren around because her foster parents had small children. First six months\nthat I lived out of ghetto --. The worst thing was my contact, my encounter with\nthe Aryan world, with the Warsaw that didn\u2019t exist for me, with the normal\npeople, normal life, normal life. People who had different scale value and\ndifferent needs. I couldn\u2019t, it was very hard to adjust. People who took me, the\nfirst people who took me and I spend few weeks with them, were cousins of my --\n, the nearest cousin of my mother. But they were transformed, they were different\npeople. They pretended not to be Jewish; they still pretend. They were\ncompletely different people. I had nothing in common with them. Everything\nturned, our friendship, our love, didn\u2019t survive the war. We didn\u2019t, we are not\nfriends any more. It\u2019s hard to say what happened, what happened was that they\ntried to become like other people. They tried to live in petty, small, petty\nproblems. I left my parents in ghetto and I didn\u2019t know if they were still alive. I\ncouldn\u2019t care for small things, I was one important burden that I --.Well, I wasn\u2019t\nalone over there because cousins, our cousin took another cousin who was young;\nI was 14, he was 17. Since the life, normal life and sun and smiling people and\nchitchat and things like that didn\u2019t -- were so distant to us, we used to keep\ntogether. We tried to be, well, there was --. They lived in the attic, they had very\nnice apartment in the upper --.",
        "A: Yes, for, for --.\n(End of Side A, Tape IT)",
        "A: I will finish with that story about our cousins. There was an attic and we used to\ngo up to that attic. We didn\u2019t talk much but we just stayed, sit and be quiet. I\ndon\u2019t remember any conversation, any special conversation with him. My cousin,\nmy aunt or my cousin told me that this is a very inappropriate thing for a young\ngirl to be alone with a young man with no --. It was such a stupid thing. I was\nreally -- I felt terribly isolated. I felt terribly isolated because I didn\u2019t belong to\nthe world that she wanted to belong. Her father was in ghetto and he was one of\nthose constant boarders who always used to spend days with us. She never asked\nabout him. She wasn\u2019t interested. It was sort of self -- self defense. I am sure\nnow she wanted to be like other people. She didn\u2019t want to have father in ghetto\ndying in there, or maybe already dead, or in a transport in a - to Treblinka. She\ndidn\u2019t want it but I didn\u2019t want to listen about her new dress or a new fur or\nsomething like this. So I was very, very unhappy. I was unhappy but I don\u2019t\nthink I had the courage to say something. I really don\u2019t know. A few weeks later,\nthey found a place for me to stay. It was in the Warsaw suburbs; I don\u2019t\nremember even the name of the -- I forgot the name but it doesn\u2019t matter. The\nman who took me, took me only for money. He was an alcoholic. He treated his\nfamily very badly. They lived in very bad -- they were very primitive people.\nBut I don\u2019t think they were -- they weren\u2019t brutal, they didn\u2019t do anything bad,\nanything cruel for me. They were such a simpleton. My mother visited me there.\nMy mother didn\u2019t talk and didn\u2019t trust, instinctively didn\u2019t trust our\ncousins. She noticed the transformation; they were different people and she\ndidn\u2019t know how far they are able to go. Something opened, something different;\nthey were very close relatives and very close friends. But something strange,\nstrange feelings and mistrust, opened between my mother and my cousins. So\nthey didn\u2019t want to tell my mother where I am. At last my mother came. I have to\ntell you about how my mother left ghetto. I will finish this, okay?",
        "A: My mother came and I went to meet her. It was only three weeks after I left\nghetto, three or four, very short time. We met on the road and I was like dead\ninside. I couldn\u2019t even be happy. It was -- I didn\u2019t feel my mother was coming. I\nwas like a living -- like somebody sucked away my feelings. It took some time,\nnot very long, maybe half an hour, maybe 15 minutes, before I started to feel\nhappiness and then it was absolutely great feeling to have my mother again.\nBecause I didn\u2019t think that we could survive. I left, no. This is something that I\nnever told anybody. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s very loyal to tell about\nother people. To tell how disaster makes people, divide people, divide close\npeople --. When I was in my cousins\u2019 apartment, 1t wasn\u2019t -- not very big\napartment; other people helped my parents to get out -- of ghetto. They -- the\ntelephone -- I said that the telephone was still working. The ghetto almost didn\u2019t\nexist but the telephone was working. So one of my father\u2019s, my parents\u2019 friends\ncame over and told me Dzidzia please, I want to talk in private with Lilusia.\nLilusia was cousin. I don\u2019t want you to be here because I have to tell something.\nWe have some things that grown-up people have to talk. I left the room but I\nknew that it was about my parents. I put my ear into a lock and I heard\neverything. He told, Mr. ---- I am saying his words. He said \u201cWladek, (my\nfather) he\u2019s crazy. They don\u2019t have any valuables, they don\u2019t have any valuable\nthings. They have little money, he looks like he looks and he want to leave the\nghetto. He\u2019s absolutely crazy. I don\u2019t know what, I can\u2019t figure out the way of\nhis thinking.\u201d It was quite cruel but it was the -- his intentions were good. He\ndidn\u2019t say this because he had something against my father\u2019s survival but he knew\nit was unrealistic. At least I knew my father, my parents were alive. By the same\nway, the same groups who worked outside ghetto, were still working outside\nghetto, were working for quite a long time, few months longer. First my mother,\nthen my father were transported through ghetto borders and they were also in the\nworking place outside the ghetto. Some friends of my parents came over and took\nthem to their house. It was act of courage like absolute heroism. They were\nheroes because it was obvious for people outside the ghetto, who my parents were\n-- the way they looked and the sort of the way they were dressed, it was\nabsolutely obvious. But from where my parents were outside in the safe place,\nthe other friend made first contact, who talk on the phone with my father and who\ngave him the idea that there\u2019s a chance for my father, took things in his hands and\nfound a place in Milanowek, in Warsaw suburbs. My parents were in Milanowek;\nI moved from one place to another for a few months. Some people were nice,\nsome people were scared; some people had tried but couldn\u2019t manage, it was too\nrisky Sometime people around started to talk about me; that there is something\nstrange with me, who I am, it\u2019s obvious who I am. It was obvious who I am. At\nlast, from January 17, 1943, we were together for two years, together with my\nparents. Those two years weren\u2019t bad.",
        "A: In Milanowek, in Warsaw suburbs. We spent two years in relative quiet, quiet\nenvironment, relatively quiet. We --.",
        "A: No. My sister was --.",
        "A: The other people. On some occasions when there was some danger around, other\npeople used to take my sister to our place because it was in the same small town.\nBut it was rather rare. Most of the time, my sister was with, in the other place.\nWe weren\u2019t -- the people, Mr. and Mrs. Sokolowski is this name, they are both\ndead by now, only their daughter is alive. Their daughter was my friend. She4\nwas -- we were of the same age so we --. Mr. and Mrs. Sokolowski put some\nconditions. They took us under some conditions. We were not supposed to have\nguests, nobody was supposed to know our address and we were not supposed to\nleave the place. We had some false documents but my father when he got his --\nyou know what kennkarte was?",
        "A: When my father got his passport, his kennkarte, that was very hard to get one. At\nlast he received one, he had to sign it. He signed Wladyslew Winawer. His\nkennkarte was for different name but he -- it was disaster. But at the same time,\nwe knew that my father couldn\u2019t use that kennkarte, he simply couldn\u2019t use it.\nNobody would believe he was --.",
        "A: Yes, he was.",
        "A: No, it couldn\u2019t have been any problem to know that more. It was sort of, really,\nno false hope. It\u2019s obvious that we can\u2019t lead any official life. There\u2019s no way for\nus to pretend that we live here, live there as tenants or something like that. But our\nMr. and Mrs. Sokolowski didn\u2019t believe, didn\u2019t, took us knowing that we are a --\nwait a second -- it was a death sentence. So thy built something sort of, the same\nthing that we had in our small barracks. They built sort of trap with covered\nentrance and any time they kept the house gated. The gate was always locked and\nany time somebody suspicious appeared at the gate, we\u2019re supposed to hide in the\ntrap. We did it; we learned how to do it very quickly. It was like a drill, like a\nmilitary drill. They were, they weren\u2019t like Polish people, Polish people are\nemotional, poorly organized. This is typical, this is what 1s typical in Polish\nculture and Polish --. But they were completely different. They had a very strong\nsense of responsibility and they knew the risk they taking and everything was\nperfectly well organized. Little by little, we had more and more things to take\nwith us, a radio and arms and many, many things because we were the safest\npeople to keep dangerous things. Because we weren\u2019t supposed to be taken to\nGestapo or to be tortured because Jews were killed on the spot. Since we, little by\nlittle we had more important things to hide with us, we felt more -- our life had\nmore value. We did something, we did something more than try to save our lives.\nComparing to the other people our life in hiding was very, very quiet and\nuneventful.",
        "A: No, because we were 1n hiding.",
        "A: When we liberated; we --. A few days later, my father was very sick. Well, those\n-- my father was depressed. He, in his character, he was able to do heroic acts but\nhe had no discipline like my mother, to stay quiet, to wait, to do routine things; he\nbecame depressed, he became so depressed, he didn\u2019t get up, he stayed in bed for\nweeks on. What turned out to be great, great help for his tuberculosis because this\nis the way that tuberculosis can be cured. So he survived. There were some bad\ntimes, sometimes he was very sick but all in all he, in the end of the war, he was\nmuch better than a few years earlier. He survived; I think what he did, he opened\nsort of Jewish ;place of Jewish, not council; Jewish, not gathering place; place\nthat you learn about other people who survived.",
        "A: Something, it wasn\u2019t any, it was spontaneous, it was something, it wasn\u2019t any\norganization in -- but it was the place where many people --. We moved from\nthat, our hiding place. We found an apartment very, very close, close by. People\nwho came from Russia, people who was leaving the hiding places, people who\ncame from camps, they came en masse to our place to talk about the way they\nsurvived, what happened to them, to ask about other people. It was unfortunate,\nwe didn\u2019t have anything like tape recorders, tape recorders like now. I didn\u2019t, I\ndon\u2019t remember --. Most of those exciting stories got lost.",
        "A: The Russians on exact date, I\u2019m telling you the date because the date was very\nimportant, very, very meaningful in Poland. Because on January 17 of 1945, the\nRussians came. It\u2019s questionable if they liberated Poland but they liberated us,\nthat\u2019s for sure. It was exactly two years of living in the Mr. and Mrs.\nSokolowski\u2019s house.",
        "A: Well, only I saw the fire and heard shots but --.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know because I lived in suburbs. It wasn\u2019t close. It wasn\u2019t -- so people,\nmy husband, who wasn\u2019t Jewish, who lived next to ghetto and the neighboring\nstreet, to walls so his knowledge about uprising in ghetto is much more precise\nthan mine. Because he heard voices, he saw things that I didn\u2019t. I know it was,\naccording to his memory, it was something you can\u2019t forget.",
        "A: But well, this is nothing, nothing special because he didn\u2019t, he\u2019s contacted his --.\nHe doesn\u2019t know that much to make the story special. You have to listen, to talk\nto people who have some, who helped or who --.",
        "A: Well, maybe. I will --. People who helped Jews are heroes. I really think of it.",
        "A: After the -- well --.",
        "A: After time in hiding. When I left my hiding place, I wasn\u2019t normal girl. I wasn\u2019t\nlike the other girls. Because after two years of being isolated, I was strange. I\nwas almost half-crazy, stupid, extremely naive, extremely stupid. I wanted to be\nlike other girls, I didn\u2019t want to be so wise and experienced and remember. I\ndidn\u2019t want to remember anything for years.",
        "A: Well, I talked. I didn\u2019t -- I talked. I didn\u2019t like to talk about our disappointments\nof our relatives or something that our friends said, not knowing that I heard it\nbecause they were very good people. They had good intentions, they didn\u2019t want\nto hurt anybody. No, I don\u2019t have any --. I don\u2019t feel different than other people.\nI don\u2019t feel that I survived, that I had tragic experience because my experience\nwas very, very --. Comparing to other people, my life, my war experience was --.",
        "A: Mild, I would say mild. Comparing --.",
        "A: Absolutely mild. I would say it was mild comparing to the others. Comparing to\nAmerican girl, living in American suburb, it was tragedy but you have to always,\nalways compare to something. It was mild. I didn\u2019t know a fear of death. Since I\ndidn\u2019t, I had only a fear of being alone, not being with my parents. I was afraid of\nbrutal people, of primitive people more than of execution. I remember that\nmoment close to death, it wasn\u2019t a moment of fear. It was sort of moment of\nexpectation, not of fear. I don\u2019t know if I hadn\u2019t -- if execution squad will shot\nme, I will be hero, I don\u2019t know. As far as I know, I wasn\u2019t afraid of death and in\nsome way, I was prepared. We knew that there\u2019s no chance to survive. We had\nno money, we lived from month to month. My father had some lots in Warsaw.\nThey were un-built lots; they were very difficult to be sold but our friends\nmanaged somehow to find buyers. Well, for low price. We lived selling those\nlots. My parents didn\u2019t have, didn\u2019t have, really didn\u2019t have any money to live\non. It was almost day-to-day survival. We didn\u2019t have much hope but we --. I\ncan tell about my father because my father helped us out of his difficult streak in\nhim; but my mother and me were quiet. We were always quiet. My father was a\nhero but couldn\u2019t stand the passive life.",
        "A: My life.",
        "A: Well, okay. Can we take some break.",
        "A: Okay, our life after war was difficult to me because I didn\u2019t go to school during\nthe war. My education was shattered. I learned something, a little bit of this, a\nlittle bit of that. My parents tried to teach me but wasn\u2019t organized, disciplined\nway of teaching so I was two years behind my peers. I thought at the age of 17, if\nyou are two years older than your classmates, you feel terrible.(?) It\u2019s completely\ndifferent, different world. With my experience, I was more distant, more different\nthan -- to my peers than even if I were two years older but --. I couldn\u2019t find a\nplace. I didn\u2019t belong anywhere. In those days, it was only once in my years that\nI found the victim of anti-Semitism. After the war, there was very strong anti-\nSemitic attitude, especially among the young people, among kid at school.\nMaybe not only, but I felt it at school.",
        "A: Well, I felt the same. No, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel different, I felt\nprosecuted or hurt but no, hurt by stupid idiots. But the school was anti-Semitic,\nnot only kids, teachers too. The atmosphere was very unpleasant. I wanted to go\nto a special school for grown-ups. There were such schools after the war, to make\nevening classes for working people. But my parents didn\u2019t accept it and I was -- I\nwas, somehow, I depended on my family more than seventeen-year-old depends\nin normal times. If they say no, I accepted it and I used to go to regular school.\nThe school was so bad and they treated me so unfairly that I moved to another\nschool. I changed schools and in that school, in another place, another town, I felt\n--. It was a good school and everybody liked me and everything was okay. Little\nby little, I returned to normal life. When I finished school, I started to study law\nand the new calamities, how do you say it in English, disaster came?",
        "A: The calamities came, Stalinism, communism. Whatever happened during the\nHitler era had some good followers during the Stalin era. Little by little, I was\nmore involved in rebellion against Stalinism than thinking about my past.",
        "A: My -- many friends begged them to leave Poland. But my father was sick with\nthe tuberculosis that was much better but when he started working and he was --\nworked with such an energy, he became ill again. My father had no -- this is not\nprofession to --.",
        "A: At the age of 44 or 45, sick with -- and the world didn\u2019t like, wasn\u2019t open for\nrefugees. It was very bad time for the -- the only immigration could be to -- even\nthat was before Israel was formed",
        "A: They didn\u2019t, they thought it wouldn\u2019t be reasonable.",
        "A: And got married. No I, for a few years, I worked as a judge, as a judge\nsomething. Then I started to practice law. Not a regular judge, sort of judge. Was\nadministration, sort of -- well, doesn\u2019t matter. Interesting?",
        "A: I will tell you because I forgot the word today. New Socialistic organization that\nwas supposed to judge, to settle the cases between public sector because courts\nwere too conservative and the communist wants special court for organizations,\nfor whatever.
