        "Question: Can you tell me your parents' names and their\noccupations?",
        "Answer: Sure. My dad's name was Albert Heppner. He had no\nmiddle name. He was by profession an art historian principally,\nalthough he did some writing and some some dealing. A lot of\nart dealing. And uh my mother's name was Irene Marian Kramer\n(oh) and uh she had no profession as far as training is\nconcerned but since my father was a freelancer she did a lot of\nwork with him. In fact my mom and dad worked together during all\nthe time that I can remember before things broke down to the\nextent nobody was working anymore.",
        "Question: Did you have any brothers or sisters?",
        "Answer: No. None.",
        "Question: Uh, were your grandparents living?",
        "Answer: Yes, my grandparents were living. That is to say uh I\nI got to know and meet one from each side of the family. Uh I\nknew my grandmother Dana (ph) who was my father's mother, and\neven better I knew my mother's father, whose name was Jacob\nKramer and uh he lived with us.",
        "Question: Could you tell me what your early childhood was like?",
        "Answer: Well, my early childhood was not unusual for an\nimmigrant family. Even though I was born in the Netherlands, I\nwas barely born in the Netherlands. My parents escaped from\nBerlin earlier the same year that I was born which was 1933.\nAnd uh they settled in the Netherlands at at for them a very bad\ntime. It was the midst of a de...depression and uh they could\nbarely escape with what little possessions they had. They were\nrelatively young married couple so they had a hard time\neconomically and as I say they they worked together pretty well.\nAnd my father stitched together little bit of this anda little\nbit of that so that they could make a living. And so actually I\nwas raised more by my grandfather in in that period of my life\nthan by either parents and I liked my grandfather a whole lot\nbetter for that reason because since my father worked out of the\nhome, why it was always shush here and shush there and don't\ntouch and and make scarce. And grandfather, Opa (ph) I called\nhim, Opa Kramer, uh he took time. He had the time. He was\nretired so uh he dragged him around with him and really had more\nof an influence probably on my early education, preschool, than\nmy parents. I remember usually in the mornings, he would take\nme to the playground just to get away from being under foot at\nhome and in the afternoon he'd take me to his pinochle game. So\nthe mornings he made like a child and in the afternoon I made\nlike a grandparent and sat very quietly on the chairs. I\nwatched the old, old men, all refugees from Germany, play\npinochle and drink tea and tell stories and that's how I grew up\nbilingual, at least bilingual. Uh my father was ina ina very\ninternational type of of occupation and there were always people\nfrom all over coming to our house because that's, as I said,\nwhere my dad conducted his business. Early in the morning\nalready, my mother was an excellent hostess. She made, was\nwell-known for her breakfasts so people who came in on the\nmorning train from Paris would come in and sit down at our at\nour table and and uh talk, chit chat, and talk business. My\nfather was an excellent linguist. He was equally at home in\nGerman and in French and in Italian and in Dutch, and his\nEnglish was quite good as well. He has a classical education.\nHe spoke uh uh could could certainly read fluently Latin and\nGreek, so it it was a very actually lively I would say and\ninternational experience that I was exposed to. So even though\nmy father had a very strict rule because he was really upset\nthat uh the country that he loved so dearly, Germany, went for\nsuch for such crazy and criminal theories and activities as took\nplace under Hitler. He had a very strict rule. No German.\nAbsolutely not. They uh, my father went to to the trouble of\ntranslating German nursery rhymes and songs, children's songs\nhe didn't know any Dutch ones and I don't why he didn't take the\ntrouble to learn. Maybe that's hard for parents. At any rate\nuh the way out that he choose was he kept uh the German songs\nand nursery rhymes and just translated them. And uh made my\nmother uh sing or recite the translations. Which she did\nfaithfully while he was around but it was much easier for her\nto do it in the original German, and so I learned them both\nways, and of course my grandfather didn't pay any attention to\nwhat made my father said about that and uh as soon as we were\nout of ear shot, that was the language he talked to me. So as I\nsay I was really raised bilingual and bicultural. But that had\nto be subrosa because we had to hide it from my dad because the\nthe outside effect that we were to give is that we were a Dutch\nfamily and uh he wanted to forget about ever having been German.",
        "Question: Can you describe the changes in your family life and\nin the daily routine after the Nazis invaded the Netherlands but\nefore you left Amsterdam?",
        "Answer: Yeah. Well, of course, things went very much in\nstages. I think a lot of people who've who've lived through\nthat have have explained it pretty much the same way. Uh the\nGermans, the Nazis, and it's hard to make that distinction, uh\nbecause the Nazis swept everyone along with them, uh the Germans\nwhen they invaded the Netherlands uh were an occupying power and\nin in the beginning made a real effort I think to kind of get\nthe population on their side. So uh our first reaction when we\nsaw that Holland was uh going to be lost from the standpoint of\nof the fortunes of war, uh my father tried to pack up the family\nand we went, we jumped in a taxicab that he managed to secure\nsomehow, and uh drove across the narrow neck of the northern\npart of the Netherlands to the harbor city of ,\nwhere uh we heard that they were sending refugee boats to pick\nup people, but we came just an hour too late maybe. At that time\nthey were already blowing up the harbor installations and one of\nmy earliest recollections is just seeing the whole harbor area\nof go up in flames. The reason that was so impressive is\nthey had oil storage tanks there and uh of course that burned\nguite effectively lots of fire, lots of smoke. And uh a Dutch\ntrooper at the edge of turned us back and said it's too\nlate and sent us back to Amsterdam. And then we were really\nscared because we saw Amsterdam burning too but they were\nblowing up the oil storage tanks there too in the harbor and so\nuh once we got back things got fairly well back to normal never\ncompletely because you know there was an occupying power in the\nstreet. And again some of my earliest recollection is walking\nto school. At the time we we Jewish kids were still going to\nthe regular school. There was no thought of of segregating us.\nUh but the Nazis one time just just for fun uh ran one of their\nuh uh personnel carriers up on the sidewalk just to watch the\nkids scurry. So they they were very much uh an occupying power\nand then gradually started tightening the screws, obviously\nfirst a little tighter on the Jews and and uh but right behind\nit on the rest of the population until at the very end no one,\nJewish or non-Jewish, escaped extreme depravation. I mean the\nJews were deported and gassed, but the rest of the people had a\nvery hard time as well. And uh after the war, you know, I I\nwent back to the Netherlands for about a half a year, and one of\nthe interesting, for me, things that I did was I joined a\ntherapy group because I'm having a hard time living all this\nstuff down. And I figured, in Dutch, on the scene, that might\nhelp me quite a bit. And there were some people in there my age\nand when raised that this was an issue for me, the subject\ncompletely switched from all the troubles they had at home and\nthe troubles that they had at work, and they were completely\nthere with me, talking about uh the experiences in the\nNetherlands, because no one came off free from it. But you know\nthe early experiences that I had for example is that the Nazis,\nthe Germans hard to hard to distinguish as I say built a wall\ndown the center of my school. One side for the Jewish kids, one\nside for the non-Jewish kids. And uh that was unusual. Usually\nthey picked one school for the Jews and another school for the\nnon-Jews. That that's how how it was dramatized that things\nwere happening, things that were happening that segregated out\nthe Jews and that I was one of them and that I was in trouble.",
        "Question: Can you tell me a little bit about the events leading\nup to your departure from Amsterdam?",
        "Answer: Yeah. Right. Well, uh as I say, tightening the screws\nwas done on my family in a very dramatic way in that uh they\nfirst pulled my dad's work permit so that my dad, who was very\nmuch in the public eye uh giving lectures at public museums,\ngoing to auctions and so forth, couldn't openly do that anymore.\nSo I uh I heard it's hard to know after all I was six, seven\nyears old it's hard to know what I remember and what I'm\nreconstructing from what people tell me but I think I was very\nwell aware that my father was uh having troubles with his\nbusiness and where these troubles were coming from, that he had\nto do double bookkeeping and work out tricks with his friends so\nthey could stay on in business and make it appear that he really\nwas not. Uh they actually came to raid our place several times.\nFirst they came for silver and gold and the usual things that uh\nthat they that they liked to steal, which was always done in\nvery formal way, with receipts and stamps and all that sort of\nthing. Uh and uh later on they came by stages to steal my dad's\nart collection which was his stock for for his dealership in in\nart, and I remember the first time they came around they they\nsent the Amsterdam police. Those people must have really been in\na very you know almost untenable position because they didn't\nwant to do this. But they were made to do it and they had to\nwork somehow and they were the police. They were taken over.\nSo I remember when they came, my dad was out. He wasn't even\nsupposed to be out of the city because he wasn't even allowed to\nride public transportation anymore in those days. So uh mother\nmade up a story as to where he was, and uh the police did\neverything they do to to calm her down they said don't worry\nabout it uh, we don't even like to do this job but we have to do\nit, and they said if there is anything particular you'd like to\ndo before we start our work, that's fine. Now this was a hint\nto her that if she wanted to make one of those paintings that\nthey knew were were around disappear, they wouldn't mind. But\nyou didn't know who you could trust, so here again I'm telling\nyou part of what I remember, part of what I reconstruct but I\nstill remember my mother taking one of those paintings, a little\none, and just letting her coat drop over it and see what would\nhappen. And they pretended like it wasn't there. So gradually\nevery time she'd pass through the house she she pushed that that\npainting further and further until she finally pushed it into a\ncloset. Then they came and listed everything on official forms\nand sealed it in the closet. Put the seal of the city of\nAmsterdam on our on our hall closet, and that was the end of my\ndad's stock. Most of it they didn't get, but they got four or\nfive good paintings which we've tried to in the interim to get\nback, unsuccessfully. The stuff that we got back was all saved\nfor us by friends and neighbors. But uh the stuff that was\nconfiscated, including my own bicycle, we never got back. And\nhow people can sit with wellknown pieces of art, because my dad\ndealt in good stuff, that they know is stolen, this very day is\nhard to believe. So you know the Holocaust goes on because\npeople did not make restitution, not in a general way. But the\nyour question was what changed? Well, uh what what changed then\nuh is that the action against property changed to action against\npeople. Now first they called up the the young folks and they\ntold them, I remember I had a uh friend of the family that that\nplayed with me quite a bit. Uh he was he was called up and he\nwas glad to go because in the beginning it was not at all clear\nwhat was happening to people that were being called up for uh\nwork related uh for war related work in Germany. They told these\nfolks uh, come work for us a half a year and we'll let you go to\nPalestine. And so the kids were were anxious to go. And they\nwent willingly. Sent letters back, sent letters back ona\nregular basis. And when the letters stopped coming my parents\nknew. They knew even though nobody ever really said this out\nloud. So it was still a surprise the first day when they\nstarted picking up people in the street. And my father ran into\none of those uh street raids but fortunately he had a lot of\nfriends and uh one of the stores that he was dealing with, one\nof the neighborhood stores, the storekeeper pulled him off the\nstreet and says you don't want to go there. They're loading up\nJews. So he had he hid him behind the counter and then after\nafter curfew the Germans set an eight o'clock curfew on Jews in\nthose days uh he slipped home and thought that that things were\nat least in the short run going to be better when they made a\nnight raid on our block. And uh my dad was trapped, because uh\nit was very clear that they were coming at us from all sides,\nand uh that there was, that you couldn't just walk away from it.\nSo my dad decided to go out over the roof and you know one of\none of the real uh high grabbing experiences that that I have to\ndeal with is that I heard him discuss what some of the options\nwere. His friends came over because they were worried. People\ntook took risks. They, Dutch people supported their Jewish\nfriends, discussed what the options were, decided to go up over\nthe roof. I had been told over and over again, don't go on the\nroof. And, but I knew just how to climb out the window and get\non the roof and I knew he was going to do that and try to escape\nover the roof and I was really worried. Nobody said word one to\nme, except they suddenly noticed I was standing there. Somebody\ngrabbed me, pushed me in bed, pulled the covers over me even\nthough I was protesting that I didn't put on my pajamas yet, and\nSaid you be quiet and you act like you're asleep. And uh just\nabout that time I heard the uh raiding parties stomp up the\nStairs. They, they the the real Nazis did everything they did\nloud, so you could always tell when they were Nazis and Nazi\nsympathizers. They would \"Hail Hitler\" real loud, and they had\nthat opportunity cause we, unfortunately, had downstairs\nneighbors that were Nazi sympathizers. When theysaw those\nraiders coming in, they opened the door and spent a lot of time\nhailing and and shouting at each other in the hall, which was\ngood cause it gave my dad extra time to get out. Finally they\nstomped up the stairs, stomped on the door. Finally one of my\ndad's friends let them in and quite innocently asked what they\nwanted, and although they screamed real loudly that they were\nlooking for my dad and where was he and uh you know I heard my\nmother try to explain that she didn't know, maybe he had been\npicked up in the streets she didn't know where my dad was. And\nI heard them get madder and madder at my mom and finally tell\nher that they were taking her. And uh so they did. They barely\ngave her a chance to take her purse. And uh they dragged her\noff and put her in one of their paddy wagons and hauled her off.\nWell, you said how, how did it happen then that you left town.\nWell, uh things were formal and crazy at the same time. There\nwere rules for everything which were frequently broken and were\nup to the whim of which ever commander was in charge. My mother\nwas taken to a theater which was uh known as the Holland\n, uh which which later became known as the\nbecause they they were no longer doing plays there. They were\nuSing this aS a concentration point for for people that they\npicked up, for for you know, for the shipment. And uh while my\nmother was at this , at this theater, uh she spotted a\nfriend from across the street uh whose daughter was quite\nfriendly with uh his name was Fritz Salten (ph), and Fritz was\nuh working for the Jewish Council to try and and get some\ncomfort and and support for the people that had been arrested,\ndetained or whatever word you want to use. And uh my mother\ncalled him over and said hey uh Fritz, is there any way we, I I\ncan get out of there. And he said well, he says I know that\nyour dad has done, well, she he would have said of course your\nhusband, uh I know that your husband has done work for the\nJewish Council. They're letting people off sometimes uh that\nwhose relatives worked for the Jewish Council. Why don't you\ntry that? And so, uh through Fritz we we got a letter in the\nright format saying that my dad had done work as a teacher for\nthe for the Jewish Council, and uh was the was the\nfamous commander, infamous commander of of that uh particular\noperation, let my mother go. The only one he let go that day.\nSo that's why I say things were very arbitrary. That day he\ndecided to honor that particular rule. So I mean my parents\ncouldn't have it dramatized very much more uh extremely that it\nwas time to get out of there, but where to go. (Cough) My my\nparents had one real close uh couple who were their friends whom\nthey had asked already prelude to that time to kind of scout\naround a little bit and just find anything that might work to\nget us out of there. And that was just in the beginning of some\nnegotiation with with with them, very shadowy group uh who had\nhad one front person by the name of drink a\nmoment whom Franz, that's the husband of that couple, had\ncoincidentally just gone to see the very night that uh that they\nraided our place. They were unaware that we were being raided.\nSo they hurried up these negotiations and uh even though they\nseemed very haphazarded what apparently it would be is that uh\nthey would, that this group then of adventurers would smuggle us\nsouth in a gasoline truck through Belgium, through France, up to\na little enclave known as Free France uh which was kind of in\nbetween the uh occupied and nonoccupied areas of Europe, and\nwhich functioned as kind of a door, a lastminute door for people\nto escape. So in August of '42 when these events happened, uh we\nwe left and went to the house of this Ari Hayward (ph), again to\nto see you know what what he could arrange to get us away\nfurther, so those were the circumstances that led to our\nleaving.",
        "Question: Would you tell me now from there on, the actual\nleaving and and the events that followed after that?",
        "Answer: Well, the hardest part I think for my parents in the\nleaving was that they had to leave my grandfather. He was uh\ngetting senile and diabetic and there was no question of making\nthe run with him, so they left him in an oldage home and it was\nvery hard for us to leave him. Of course, they didn't tell me\nthat we that we were going on the run. They told me that we\nwere going on vacation, which was credible since it was August,\nthe big vacation month in Europe, and they said well, we're just\ngoing to go on vacation to this new friend of ours, Mr. Hayward,\nand uh you can play with his kids and uh and we hope we'll have\na pretty good time. Uh I didn't believe that but I also didn't\nhave the nerve to ask what was really going on. And you know,\nlater on I've I've given a lot of thought to this. Do you tell\nyour kids what goes on if it's if it's tough news? And I've\ncome to the conclusion that you do at least you tell a tenyear\nOld. I was eight then. You tell an eight year old because\neight year olds understand a whole lot. You don't need to tell\nthem all the nitty gritty details, but you do need to tell them\nwhat's going on, because one of one of the most difficult things\nfor me is the confusion. Hearing one thing and seeing another.\nKnowing that my parents were telling me stories. Don't want to\nsay lies because they probably thought they were protecting me.\nCertainly thought that they were protecting me. But it was no\nprotection. It was crazy making. It was crazy making. And we\nstayed uh with the the Haywards a couple of weeks until the\nNazis raided the place, and they lost their nerve, and they\ndidn't have any alternatives ready, so those were very difficult\nweeks from uh oh from mid-August to uh mid-September when uh we\nJust wandered the countryside from one temporary shelter to\nanother until we finally wound up in the bath house of a uh\nretreat center. It sounds too fancy it was just a little place\nout in the woods uh operated by a Catholic order and it uh was\nnot being used for anything particular at the time some some\ncame their from time to time to go swimming. We\nignored them. They ignored us and we each pretended the others\nweren't there, but of course they knew. And uh things were very\nunsettled. There was still frequently a question of is the\ntruck going to come, is the truck not going to come and uh\nwhat's to happen next because incredible as it may seem, we were\nhaving our meals catered at this retreat center. It was very\nstrange uh about meal time we you would suddenly see a little\nboy appear in that clearing in the woods with a with a package\nof food for all of us. And this boy that made the delivery was\nincredible because you know when you and I walk the woods you\nhear the leaves crackle and twigs crack didn't hear anything.\nSuddenly the kid was there, and there was our food and then he\nwould slink away and disappear. Well, this was obviously not\nanything that could go on. In fact one of the things that I\nremember is how extremely worried my dad was. We were having\nbeautiful September weather, unusual for the Netherlands nice\nwarm sunny afternoons where we could go swimming. I mean it was\ngreat, in the swimming pool right uh we had to go swimming\nactually cause we at that time had only uh the clothes that that\nuh that we carried with us on our back because we were on the\nmove so much and uh while Dad and I went swimming uh my mother\nand the lady in the other couple that was hiding with us, uh did\nthe laundry in the other end of the swimming pool. Uh but as I\nwas starting to say, my dad was complaining about the good\nweather cause he says how long can this weather last. When the\ncold weather comes, we'll freeze here. There was of course no\nway to heat the bath house of a of a of a Swimming pool anda\nremote camp. So you know, when fall weather comes, particularly\nsunny weather, I find myself getting very uncomfortable and I\nhave to remind myself you know, that that harks back to these\ntimes and I'm only recently able to enjoy beautiful fall weather\nbecause I keep telling people the bad (ph) winter is going to\ncome. Now the the that 1S un a very bad position we were in\nbecause I, it was quite clear that these adventurers we, we\ntend to want to see people in terms of good or bad but that\ndoesn't always work. These uh these people that Ari Hayward put\nus in contact with were good/bad. They probably had some good\nmotivations and uh from most of the stories that I hear about\nthem repeated talk about how much money and when are you going\nto pay us and so on. They were in it principally for the money.\nAnd they were in a bad place because they couldn't deliver.\nThey had gotten their deposit I am now reconstructing uh it's\nvery clear that they had gotten their deposit but uh my father\nand and his friend uh Heinz Graumann who with also a wife and\nson was hiding along with us I didn't trust him at all. I\ndidn't give him any more money than he could get away with. I\nremember those discussions. And uh it's amazing. There's a\nDutch proverb that says little pictures have big ears. Uh this\nlittle picture had very big ears because I tried to find out as\nmuch as I could about what was going on because nobody was\ngoing to be telling me anything at all. Uh these people there,\nthen these adventurers were ina bad way. What were they going\nto do with us? And as we know reconstructed, they decided to\nkill us. It had a number of advantages. First of all they knew\nthat if the Germans got a hold of us they would do more, they\nwould do worse than kill us, and secondly since they had already\nfigured out where Heinz and my dad were were keeping their\nmoney, they could get paid instantly and not have to take any\nmore risks with us. So uh at the at that very time however the\nregular Dutch underground was starting to make some contact with\nthat nebulous group of adventurers, and uh while they were\nexploring ways to get rid of us, they also explored a way of\nhanding us over to the regular Dutch underground in that\nparticular area of the Netherlands which was the southeastern\ncorner, east of . And uh .....\nEND OF TAPE\n...so the story that they told us was that they had some people\nthat maybe could help them and uh one by one they would they\nwould uh which would which would be safer than herding a whole\ngroup of six people through the woods one by one they would\ndeliver us to these people, whereas at least a good portion of,\nat least two of these people were definitely decided on the\nmurder route. They uh took Michael, the the other boy that was\nhiding with us uh he was considerably older than I, I was I was\neight and he was probably around fifteen or sixteen at the time\nthey took him first and they did in fact kill him. And uh later\non uh I was told they found graves that, shallow graves, that\nthey had pre-dug for all us. So they were really serious about\ndoing us in. But uh killing is hard. People uh that talk about\nkilling say uh your first killing really is the hardest. When\nyou see a a vibrant young boy that had just been laughing and\njoking with you and you suddenly split open his skull and you\nsee his blood that does something to people. And from the\ntestimony that uh came out in the trial afterwards, the person\nthat uh swung the shovel that kill...killed Michael, came to\ntrial after liberation. It was clear that uh that the\ngruesomeness of of actually having done the act uh helped deter\nthem from killing the rest of us, and then they tried the route\nof handing us over to the regular underground, which they did.",
        "Question: Alright. After you were handed over to the\nunderground, what happened then?",
        "Answer: Well, at at first we were still split up and uh my\nparents and I were brought to the house of uh Harry Janssen,\nJanssen we would say in Dutch, uh a smallscale farmer and\nprofessional thrasher who lived in the outback behind uh the\nvillage of Durna (ph) which as I say is east of and uh\nhe was uh loosely connected with the underground. The\nunderground has to be loosely connected or else it doesn't\nfunction in occupied territories. And uh that was an interim\nplacement. They were going to decide what to do next. And uh\nto our surprise, after a while, the Graumanns showed up there\ntoo, because the people that were supposed to have taken them in\ndidn't and the last time we saw the members of this nebulous\ngroup of adventurers that I talked about was when they delivered\nthe Graumanns. Said they would come back for them and never\ndid. And uh all the connections that were supposed to have\nworked for Harry to to get us away or out of the country or\nwhatever, didn't work. So he inherited us. And although he\nnever expected to be hiding five Jews for any length of time, he\ndid. And I think the relationship immediately became quite\nclose because of course in the beginning, no one knew what had\nbecome of Michael. And uh Harry could see Elli Graumann,\nMichael's mother, wilting more and more each day, not knowing\nwhat had happened to her son. So he he uh he started the\nunderground into a manhunt. And they combed the place till they\nfinally found one of the people of what I have been calling that\nnebulous group, and they nabbed himand interrogated him till\nthey, till he told the truth, and showed where where Michael was\nburied. So that dramatized to Harry you know the the type of\npickle that we were in, and I guess kind of gradually at first,\nweek by week, he decided to to become the person to to shelter\nus, take charge of us. And he did that. He did this two years\nalmost to the day till we were liberated, despite raids, despite\nsearches specifically of his place, despite interrogation, this\nman was a master at dissimilation and withstanding uh\ninterrogation. He could make up stories. He was a natural\nraconteur. We kids loved him because he could tell us kids\nstories too. A marvelous storyteller. That came in very handy\nfor him, cause he'd make up some story and it always worked.\nLike one time I remember there was a search specifically of his\nplace. They came to he he had his contacts and he had been\nwarned uh that there would be a search of his place. And TI I\nhad the measles. I was really sick. And you Know we had\nvarious places that we would hide out when the word came that\nthere'd be a search, but there was no question it would have\nbeen inhumane to stick me into one of these places so he stuck\ntwo of his kids uh about the same age in bed with me it was\nObvi...it was quite common in poor uh families for several kids\nto sleep together, but that was not the usual way that I slept.\nAnd the other two kids had the measles too I think, and so they\nthey stuck them, he stuck them, all three of us, in in one of\nthe bedrooms, and put a big sign on the door, \"Quarantined\", and\nso when the search party came through, he says feel free to look\nanyplace. I've got nothing to hide he says, but don't go in\nthere. I've got some really sick kids in there, and the doctor\nput a sign on there \"quarantined.\" I don't want you guys to get\nsick. So well after they made a perfunctory look inside and\nthey say three real sick kids in there, threw the door closed,\nand uh you know, he got us through just by talk. And even\nthough he had some very very good places that he tried at\nvarious place, at various times to hide us, the most interesting\none was a double wall. In order to picture how the double wall\nfunctioned, you have to you have to picture a very primitive\nfarmstead, and the farmsteads in in Holland uh from an earlier\nera like this one dated from, had the animals and the people\nunder one roof. The people would live up front, and the animals\nwould be in the back. Very convenient if you go milking cause\nyou just open up a door and you're in the stable and you can\nmilk the cows and bring the milk right into the kitchen. In\nfact that's what they did. Well, in this wall, they had they\nhad two walls then one separating the house from the main part\nof the stable and then another separation between the cows and\nthe horses. And that's where they built the double wall. And\nhe had a friend, a uh a bricklayer come in, and duplicate the\nthe wall that was already there exactly as it was uh oh about\nmaybe uh a couple of feet away, and uh then to get to that place\nthey would hoist us up to the rafters and let us down with a\nrope so that we'd between the two walls and of course there was\nno door. Uh these raids always came at the worst times. I\nremember one time my mother, my mother had a severe case of\ndiarrhea when the alarms came and they hoisted her in there with\nuh with uh a potty and uh can you imagine those poor people that\nhad to sit there for I think twenty-four hours with someone who\nhad an over-flowing potty of diarrhea. Ugh. Fortunately they\nhid me someplace else that time. They hid me in a haystack.",
        "Question: Tell me a little bit about your daily routine when\nyou were living with the farm family.",
        "Answer: Well, I think I think everybody was quite aware that in\norder to go, to keep from going stircrazy, you have to keep\npeople busy. And uh the Janssens increasingly gave us work to\ndo. We peeled all their potatoes, and when I say all, potatoes\nwas a Staple and uh the Janssens were sheltering not only Jews\nbut at various times various members of their rather extensive\nfamily that had moved to the city and were running out of food.\nSo there was uh one other chicken house full of people. Uh\nHarry used to say how fortunate that the Nazis stole all our\nchickens. This way we can house the people. We can house the\nrefugees. There's another chicken house full and sometimes some\nof the other buildings. I had relatives in them too. So we\nstrung the beans and peeled the potatoes. Something that uh\npeople find hard to believe we strung tobacco and Holland is\nnot known aS a tobacco raising country, but uh you know, we were\ntalking a little earlier how starved people were for for these\nCigarettes or anything resembling cigarettes, so they found some\nvariety that would grow there and people took tremendous risks\nsmuggling uh seeds for tobacco which we then grew secretly and\nstrung secretly. There was a lot of secret stuff. I still\nremember Harry did another thing which was strictly illegal. He\nbutchered. Uh he butchered hogs. And we, and people who\nfarmedwere supposed to deliver all uh animals that were ready\nfor market, all produce to the Germans, which they then shipped\neast. They didn't give hardly anything to the people in the\nNetherlands, which is why there was such a famine there. But uh\nHarry in contravention of all the rules, slaughtered, and we did\nthat right on the kitchen floor. Uh can imagine a little Jewish\nboy... (laughter)...a scene like that. I had no real sense of\nwhere meat was coming from and to see then slit the throat of a\nhog and string it up from the ceiling and cut it up into pieces\nand make sausage out of the guts that was some experience. But\nuh it was something that the kids all watched with glee and uh I\nmade a real effort to to fit in. It was hard because you know I\nwas uh a city slicker from the north and they were country\nbumpkins from the south and they, they not only had a completely\ndifferent culture, they had a different language. They spoke\nDutch but it was such a different dialect that uh if they talked\namong themselves I couldn't understand a word they were saying.\nAnd I knew I was I was a native Dutchman. However fortunately\nthey learned standard Dutch in school so if they wanted to they\ncould include me. And of course in short order I learned the\ndialect and learned to watch such things as hog slaughter. And\nit was uh kind of a fun thing ina way because the one thing\nthat uh we kids would get out of it immediately was the bladder.\nAnd you will say, what do you do with a hog bladder. Well, what\nyou do is you you try to scrape and wash it clean the best you\ncan, and then you take an old tin can and you tie the top of the\nbladder to the tin can much as you would make a drum, with one\ndifference. You'd also take a stick and you would tie that to\nthe center of the bladder, centered over the drum, centered over\nthe over the tin can, and then you would tie it taught. Then\nyou would spit into your hands, , and then you would slide\nit up and down the stick and that was an instrument, an\ninstrument which everybody learned to hate. But uh for uh for\nuh, what what is this holiday called in English sometimes it's\nit's hard to translate on the spot uh it's it's a spring\nholiday just befo...just before the frost (ph) uh, help me,\nit's fat fat Monday in French. Mardi Gras. OK. Uh on Mardi\nGras we would go out and uh and serenade the neighbors which\nwith what we called the , and uh as much to get rid the\nawful noise as anything else, they would they would give little\nhandouts and then the kids would troop other places. Well, of\ncourse I couldn't do this during the occupation but I was there\na good while after and uh I remember doing that with the kids\nand of course I had the fun of of making my own . Well,\nwhat else did we do? Well the interesting part is that\nunschooled and unlettered as the Janssen's were, uh especially\nthe older girls got quite interested in all the literary\nactivity of the Ph.D.'s that uh were in hiding with them. Now\nthese Ph.D. uh parental generation of mine was was odd from from\nmy retrospective point of view. They were dressed like you and\nI are today, in three-piece suits and tie, on a farm in the\noutback where there was no pavement within miles. Where there\nwas mud all around, where they had to make fire in stoves with\nwet peat that filled the place with acrid smoke in every\nmorning. That was my dad's job and uh he was he was extremely\nallergic. He had uh he had a mild case of asthma and and lots\nof associated allergies and was the worst possible job but Heinz\nnever could learn how to light a fire, so that was my dad's job\nwhich he did in his three-piece suit and tie, every morning.\nThat went on first. Uh so that showed the kind of activity you\nasked activity uh it 1S amazing the p...these two Ph.D.'s had\ntheir literary material shipped in on on the underground. Uh my\nfather had a connection in Amsterdam. One of his students, a\nvery advanced student of art history, uh collaborated with him\nin the writing. He did uh the research work in the libraries uh\nwhich he which he would either copy or summarize and send send\ndown, and my dad would would write in his field. And uh he had\na portable typewriter, so big we still have it today a little\nHermes (ph), a baby Hermes that uh he picked up in Switzerland\nand it still works today. My mother uses it today and has used\nit all this time. Tremendous advertising I would think for that\nfirm. Well, in that outback place they had a typewriter. Uh\nHeinz who had different interests uh decided to do a history on\nthe life of Millieure (ph), the playwright because to the\nunderground he he got uh in contact with a group of monks across\nthe border in Belgium, in the southeast corner of the\nNetherlands, very close to Belgium uh who unbeknownst I guess to\nto the uh uh regular scholars had hoarded away the personal\npapers of Millieure which they smuggled to Heinz and which he\nmade a treatise out of. He finally wrote a play on the life of\nMillieure so that's what went on in that chicken house, as hard\nas it is to believe. Well, with all this literary activities\nthe kids came by to see and my father started uh teaching them\nuh how to do poetry and how to make drawings and we made skits.\nI remember one of the neighbors who knew most neighbors knew uh\nthat Harry was hiding refugees was having a fiftieth wedding\nanniversary and we made the most elaborate uh skit for them, uh\na whole production uh uh weaving together stories from from the\nfamilies that were going to be at this uh at this at the\nceremony, at the celebration. And I still have those today.\nVery good stuff. And uh so it it made a very nice uh contact\nbetween uh people who otherwise would have been semiliterate.\nUh there are members of the family who who didn't join in this.\n\u00abis you know barely literate even today. Uh their their\nletters take a genius like myself to decipher but uh we became\nvery good friends which is from what I hear a rather unusual\nstory because relations between people who were hiding and\npeople who were hiding them were not always the best. You can\nimagine what tremendous pressure that put on people and uh the\nJanssens did extremely well not only in successfully hiding the\nfive people in their charge for for uh two years and then taking\ncare of them afterwards, because afterwards we had no place to\ngo. We were in the part of the Netherlands that was liberated\nhalf a year befo...before the rest. We were fortunate in that\nrespect. So even while we lived in the war zone for a half a\nyear they continued to take care of us. In the beginning we had\nmoney to pay them, but I I find in going through the uh uh\ndocuments we have from this time that uh shortly after\nliberation we ran out of money, and food was even scarcer then\nif possible than before. Harry continued to feed us and uh Dad\nwrote him an 1.0.U. and I have the 1.0.U. that he crossed out uh\nbecause he decided to forgive the debt. So that was uh the kind\nof relationship we had with the people.",
        "Question: Did your, did you get into a routine for for studies?",
        "Answer: Yeah. I personally had such a routine where there were\nat least two or three hours every morning that uh we had\nsubjects that I didn't particularly like and that I don't think\nmy dad was all that interested in either. He was a very\nliterary person. Math and and sciences were not his strong\npoints, so that's what we saved for the morning. But the fun\npart, the composition, the drawings, the language studies and\ndon't forget geography geography was the overriding interest\nbecause you know that's where our salvation was to come from in\na literary in the literal sense, so we we traced the Allied\ntroop movement over every inch of North Africa and through Italy\nand through France until they finally came through Belgium to\nliberate us, so I I you probably remember when uh the Allied\ntroops first landed in in uh western France they they came to\nNormandy and were stuck there, and I still know all the little\nhick town villages like in Normandy where these battles\nwere fought because uh they were all recreated in my atlas that\nI still have today.",
        "Question: What were some of the hiding places that were used\nfor you and your family and the other refugees when for example\nthere was a raid?",
        "Answer: Well, I've mentioned the principle one. Uh we we uh,\nthe first one where we were the least prepared, Harry took us\nway back into the peat bog where he knew of an abandoned barn\nwhere we hid in hid in the attic. Uh after that as I told you he\nconstructed or had constructed this double wall. For a time\nthey they toyed with the idea of building an air raid shelter\nwith uh with a secret room in this, but even though the air raid\nshelter got partly built that that never came came up. One time\nthey tried digging a tunnel under a haystack for me. That was\nspecial for me because it couldn't be uh so big that other that\nother people bigger than a nineyear old that I was at the time\nwould fit in. You couldn't hide in the haystack because it\nbecame known pretty quick that when they did a raid they always\nran uh sabers and bayonets through haystacks. If they came up\nwith blood they knew they caught somebody. So, but under the\nhaystack was the variation that was the worst night I think I\never spent in hiding. That was awful, in the cold clammy dark\nplace under that haystack. Uh I complained very little, but\nthey never did that again because I I did complain and that was\nreally awful. Uh other times when there was little advanced\nnotice we would just hide in the ditches and plenty of ditches\nto hide in in the Netherlands and uh ina dry, in the drier\nseason that gives you quite a bit of cover and mobility cause if\nyou can get some sense of which way the raid 1S going you can\nconstantly keep cover and and keep on the move.",
        "Question: Were the raids frequent?",
        "Answer: Well, uh I am reconstructing that there must have been\nfour that actually reached the place and maybe three or four\nothers in the neighborhood which were just as bad from the\nstandpoint of getting everybody all excited because you never\nknew are they going to come to your farm or not, but uh there\nwas a Nazi sympathizer unfortunately that uh lived across the\nstreet. Again it's hard to say. You know, as I told you\nbefore, it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Uh\nmy hunch is uh that this fellow like like many people who who\nplayed with the Nazis was more interested in being important\nthan being disloyal and uh you know, an occupying force,\nespecially a loud and oppressive one, has a certain amount of\nattraction to it, and uh there was an element, there's a type of\nof a personality I think that gets attracted to this and wants\nto go over to them and and tell them something that they don't\nalready know, and get pat on the back and be told you're a great\ncitizen and great supporter of the new order. Uh and uh it is\npretty clear that uh that the that the neighbor across the\nstreet told on us which is breaking ranks with with all the rest\nof the people around who who did know. And uh after liberation\nHarry really confronted this guy according to what uh his wife\nNina (ph) told me later, until he had this guy on his knees in\nthe middle of the street begging for mercy. I mean there were\nthat kind of strong feelings about but uh that is how come there\nwere specific raids on our place. I mean there were there were\nreally actual fingers pointed at Harry and that he was able to\nkeep cool under those circumstances. One day he payed played\ncards to, in the first raid as a matter of fact, he carried off\nby playing cards. He and his friend Marinus (ph) who were who\nwas his closest friend and who was in the underground with him,\nuh had gotten notice that uh that we were going to be raided\nwith very little advanced notice. Took us out to this barn in\nthe outback like I told you, and then he and Marinus uh uh got\ntogether some drinks and uh spread the card, cards out you know\nmoments before the raiding party came. They they acted like\nthey had been playing and drinking all night, acting completely\nSurprised. What you guys looking here on a ona strange night\nlike this? Well, we were told to make a search. Search for\nwhat? Well, you know, that conversation went on like that till\nthey got them into the game where where these two excellent card\nplayers first took all their money. To keep interest in it,\nthey let them win some of it back, which you know ate up a whole\nlot of time, all the time saying oh there's always time to go\nlooking around the place, till they were so drunk and so tired\nthat uh they hardly did any looking around at all. And Harry\nkept the best uh the best drinks for occasions like this. So he\nhe played his way through a search which is probably also weird\nin the annals of uh secret operations.",
        "Question: We'll pause here for a moment to change the tape.\nEND OF TAPE",
        "Question: Mr. Heppner, can you tell me whether there are any\nstories about Mr. Janssen that particularly stick out in your\nmind?",
        "Answer: Yeah, well he he did some really nice and and\nSupportive things. Probably the most supportive thing that he\ndid to help us live through which which was a very difficult\nSituation I mean here we were in this chicken house, right, uh\nwith for for the most part uh no opportunity to go elsewhere.\nOne thing he did is he built a uh site barricade next to the\nchicken house out of out of some of sheathes of grain, kind of\na palisade and uh so we could walk you know short distance like\nmaybe ten feet back and forth outside or sit in the sun and be\nshielded from the road by that. But one thing that he did that\nI I think was particularly thoughtful and dangerous was to bring\nin a radio, a receiver. Now you must understand that nobody in\nthe Netherlands was allowed to have a radio. There were certain\npeople who with uh certain people that were deemed trustworthy\nby the Nazis who could get a permit for a special radio which\nwas constructed so that it could only get two stations, which\nwere the two approved stations that they felt people should\nlisten to. So to get a a regular radio that could listen to\nanything, shortwave radio, was impossible. But he got one\nanyway. And dangerous because one can trace radios without\nmaking house searches. You can trace apparently whether someone\n1s receiving air waves uh electronically. So it was uh a very\nrisky thing to do and uh when my father got over the shock of\nthis very special gift that Harry brought him, he he mentioned\nthat and he says well, how many times can they kill us already.\nSo this was the attitude that that he took and uh so my father\nreally made a business of of listening to the news of of the war\nand for a while we, he even put together a little underground\nnewspaper. His best source of information was in English but\nhis English wasn't really good enough to to follow uh news\nbroadcasts too well, so he found uh a German station that was\ngiving the uh the party line, the German version of how things\nwere going in the war, at dictation speed in English, because\napparently this was done as as as kind of a propaganda tool to\nEnglishspeaking peoples, to show them how the Nazis were really\nwinning the war, and so my father could listen to the English\nbroadcasts at dictation speed which was done so that people\ncould copy it down and and you know make little newspapers out\nof it and uh then would listen to the same broadcast at regular\nspeed, and then he would train his ear so that he could\nunderstand the terms that would be used in any kind of a of a\nbroadcast. Then he would listen to the news a third time from\nthe Allied side, get the true story and understand it. There\nwas no paper and my dad scribbled on on the back of old\nenvelopes, in the margins of of diaries, of of tear\u2019off uh uh\ncalendars and everything. I still have some of these pieces of\npaper very very small, hurried writing, where you could see how\nhe was following the news. But for a time they did manage to uh\nto put out a little newspaper till word got back to Harry that\nuh this was being noticed by the wrong people and we quit. But\nuh Dad still would uh feed information into to the underground\non the progress of the war and of course we all followed with\nwith great interest ourselves. And that radio stayed with us\nthroughout. I remember I I did I did some drawing as I told you,\nthat was one of the special subjects that my dad taught me. He\nhe was a pretty good cartoonist and uh one time he said what are\nyou drawing, and he said, and I said well I'm just drawing this\nwall of of things in the chicken house. He says but you're not\ngoing to put in the radio. I said well yeah I guess not. So\nhere I have this drawing where you can see the ground wire of\nthe radio which I had already drawn, and instead see see a clock\non the shelf where the radio was. It was kind of funny. A\ncensored drawing.",
        "Question: Were there uh any other refugees on the Janssen farm?",
        "Answer: Not on their farm. First I told you we were two\nrefugee families there. That was enough. If you're talking\nabout Jewish refugees, we were aware of one other Jewish refugee\nin the neighborhood although after liberation we heard of of\nmore. This waS was an interesting thing because we were, we\nheard that uh this man was a rabbi, and uh there was a short\nmessage passedback and forth where he found out that there was a\na nine year old kid there. And so he passed back a message\nSaying no, that he was not a rabbi. He was a rabbinical student\nand uh that he was quite interested in Jewish education and he\nwanted to now already be working on a text that could be used in\nthe postwar period for uh teaching Jewish kids and could he try\nhis manuscript out on a real live student. So my father was\ndelighted. His his background in Jewish history particularly in\nHebrew was not very strong, so we used uh these letters which\nwere addressed as letter to a young friend, ,\nwhich was really the manuscript of uh that rabbi was uh\nwas sending us and I still have some of those uh letters where\nhe was teaching me Hebrew and Jewish history and and uh and uh\nculture and customs long distance. So that was incorporated\ninto my regular lessons and uh Dr. Survived the war\nand became I think a very leading post uh Holocaust uh rabbi of\nthe Netherlands. Uh the liberal Jewish community really grew\nafter the war because uh most of the survivors had that kind of\na tendency and he led the liberal movement and actually the uh\nliberal Jewish synagogue in in uh in Amsterdam is built with the\nwhole Holocaust theme of, the theme of rising from the ashes,\nand uh that movement is the one that uh led after he\nfinished his rabbinical studies. So when I visited the\nNetherlands in the '60's I I got an appointment with the who had\nthen become great man, and he could give me exactly twelve\nminutes. He felt terrible, but but you know, I was on one of\nthose American tours where you did I exaggerate ten countries\nin six days, so it had to be that afternoon and he was just\ncompletely scheduled up. But I got to see him that one time.\nThe next time I went to the Netherlands, unfortunately he died\nrather young, but his son took over his his pulpit and they\nstill have Rabbi in Amsterdam.",
        "Question: Were there any uh Allied soldiers that were refugees\nin the Janssen farm for any brief period of time, or in the\narea?",
        "Answer: Well, I think that the underground movement in the area\nwhere we where we were at was the most enthusiastic about\nrescuing pilots. Uh pilots were regularly being shot out of the\nair because a good part of the war was was carried out on in the\nair. Uh the decisive battles really were in the air, not on the\nground and uh so one time generally these two various\nunderground operations were kept separate for obvious reasons\none time a pilot stayed with us overnight. And this was very\nexciting and of course the pilot was very pleased because he\nhadn't really been able to talk to anybody because all he knew\nwas English. And to find someone in the outback that spoke\nEnglish was to him a real find and you know, my father and he,\nthey talked all night about you know about his background and\nhis fears and he finally could get clued in as to what was\nhappening to him, cause he really didn't know who had taken\npossession of him and what they could do for him, so I remember\nmy father and and this man, an Englishman, talking all night\ntill the next morning when they came to get him, and they got\nhim out successfully. They, that was a pretty successful\noperation they smuggled them south into France and then into\nSpain and Portugal and it was a regular route for to ship downed\npilots back that way. And never or they did use if for Jews but\nnot with equal enthusiasm.",
        "Question: Did you have any personal uh contact with resistance\nfighters and and develop an understanding of the depth of their\noperations or see any of these people at the farm?",
        "Answer: No. Uh this this this was nothing that that a kid\ncould understand and I I know that Harry told us as little as\npossible of his operations because you know that that was\nSurvival. Even his wife who's still alive and whom I questioned\nabout this recently said that she didn't know and didn't want to\nknow all that he was in to.",
        "Question: Before I ask you about the liberation, is there\nanything else, any particular story that you remember about the\ntime that you lived with the Janssens that you'd like to to tell\nnow?",
        "Answer: Well, I can tell you something that ties right in to\nthe day of liberation. One of the side elements of the air war\nwas an effort by the Allies to disturb the German\ncommunications, and for a time they would drop lots of uh little\nstrips of black paper with aluminum foil attached to them, which\nI guess uh disrupts radar and what happened I guess uh fly\nthrough a radar net that otherwise might detect planes that were\ncoming through, so we kids made a game of this. And we would go\nout in the fields and hunt all those strips of paper and use\nthem for art projects. I still have a calendar for example that\nthat where I made the backing out of out of those little bits of\npaper which we called silver paper. And the area in which we\nwere, atypical for the Netherlands, was solidly Catholic. [In\nfact that's probably why the people were successful in in hiding\nJews because of the solidarity among Catho...in a Catholic\nenclave in the midst of of a protestant country. And uh so we\nwould go through the fields and meadows singing \"Holy St.\nAnthony, dear friend, I hope that you will help me find a little\nslip of paper,\" in Dutch it rhymes. [Speaks in Dutch] And we\nwere hunting uh when the call came that uh that the\nliberators were finally there. You must picture a country\nwhich, countryside which had no paved roads whatsoever, didn't\nneed paved roads because nobody had a car. Only the doctor had\na motorcycle. And uh so all you had was these ruts through the\nthrough the sand and through the clay, and we had the worst\nweather in the fall of '44 that most people can remember. It\nrained and it rained in a country where it's already quite wet,\nso the the troops that were coming through there at the time, we\nlater heard that this was part of the operation Market Garden,\nwhere they were trying to make a quick dash up to the northern\npart of the Netherlands only it never worked uh only had one\nso-called hard road. We called it the hard road because it was\npaved through the whole neighborhood, and it was the only way in\nwhich armies could operate. And so uh I remember and the call\ncame up the uh the English they called everybody that spoke\nEnglish, English it didn't matter whether they were Americans\nor Scots or Canadians or Australians they were all English the\nEnglish are coming. So uh the cry went out for the kids to come\nback from the field so we all ran back to to hear what was\nhappening, so my father says uh the English are coming and uh\nthey are at the hard road. And uh I want to go and have a look\nat them. Do you want to come along? And I said to him, isn't\nthat dangerous. And he said yeah. Yeah, I guess it's\ndangerous. You don't have to go if you don't want to. So,\nwhile we know who who would pass up a challenge like this so we\ntrudged through the mud, and they had put tree trunks on the\npaths to so that people could uh at least not sink into the to\nthe deepest mud puddles. It was incredible how wet the\ncountryside was. I still remember balancing on falled tree\ntrunks to get to the hard road, and there they were a long\ncolumn of tanks, one right after the other. I think they were\nCanadians, the first ones that came through there. And uh so we\nJumped up on the tracks of of of the tanks and looked in to the\nturrets to to see who was inside and started conversation with\nthese people, but between fire fights. Uh the radio would\ncrackle and they'd say another barrage iS coming in. Everybody\ndown. Said lower the turrets. We would jump into fox holes\nwhich which the Nazis had considerably considerately dug beside\nthe road which were of course full of water. So we'd duck, duck\ninto the water till the next volley of shots went by, jump back\nout and talk talk to the soldiers some more till I still\nremember a large haystack just across that narrow little road\nwhere where I was sitting in the foxhole, uh burst into flames.\nThen I'd enough. I mean that burst into flames like you\ncouldn't believe it just \"poof\", just like that and uh so I I\nsaid to Dad right then and there, I've I've had enough and I\nmade my way back to the farm. I I don't know how long they\nstayed. But that was a very exciting time.",
        "Question: Do you remember the date of liberation?",
        "Answer: Oh yes. I remember it very clearly. It was the 24th\nof September 1944. The reason I remember it so clearly is that\nwhen we started hearing over the radio that the uh uh liberation\nforces were coming closer and we were seeing more and more\nplanes coming over and so forth, Harry and my dad made a bet\nthat we would be liberated before my dad's birthday which was\nthe 28th of September. My father said I think they'll make it,\nand Harry says no way. He says they they can't get here that\nfast. And uh so my father won the bet by four days and I still\nhave the bill that Harry initialed to show that uh Dad\nwon the bet. And that has the date right on it.",
        "Question: What was you initial contact, I mean your real, other\nthan that that one visit with your dad to watch the soldiers go\nby, what was your real involvement with the uh liberation?",
        "Answer: Well, the the German forces counterattacked as as you\nknow from having read the story of Market Garden, and pinned the\nliberation forces down, I would say exactly at our farm. I\nstill remember hearing that that one night the Germans had had\nretaken and occupied the farm right next to ours. So it was\nthat close. So we were literally in the front line and the\ncompany of soldiers that was the nearest to us physically were\nScotch, Scottish soldiers and uh they didn't like you to call\nthem Scotch. They wanted to be called Scots. Uh and uh they\nmade kind of a mascot out of me. They had very little contact\nwith the rest of the population because no one spoke English but\nto find a little urchin that's that's uh spoke English and\nwanted contact with them was a real turnon to these soldiers.\nAnd they really spoiled me. I mean they they fed me their\ncandies and they gave me their tea. They brewed tea in uh\nfireplaces made out of barrels. They would set up a barrel,\nfill it full of sand, pour gasoline into this end, and then get\na big other kind of a barrel or kettle and put it on top of top\nthere and cook tea in huge quantities and right in the middle of\nbattle they would always have their tea. The Scotch just the\nsame, the Scottish just like the English. And uh they burned\ndown many a farmstead with their bonfires, which were all done\nin the name of tea. That's what we had the most of tea and\napples. And and that fall the apple trees which were which were\nall around had a had a fantastic year and the, you know Dutchmen\nare are kind of taciturn you have a hard time expressing their\nemotions so what everybody did was whenever you saw a uh\nsoldier you gave him an apple. And that's what people did. And\nI still can hear today my mother and father kind of shaking\ntheir heads and muttering when they saw apples with one bite\ntaken out of them along side the road when everybody was\nstarving. Uh but uh they fed me their their candy and their tea\nand and their fresh baked bread which they had shipped in from\nParis. Strange things armies do. And uh uh it got to the point\nuh where I was firing their cannon and when my dad heard that uh\nI had been detonating cannon he put put a stop to my hanging\naround with these troops day and night. But I had made one,\nfriends with one man in particular. His name was Charlie\nFrazier (ph) from Aberdeen and uh Charlie followed me home and\nmade friends with my parents and uh just loved to be with a with\na family. I mean he was he was one of the few soldiers that was\na family man. He had two kids of his own, and uh he just\ncouldn't get away from his camp often enough to be with us, so\nhe he spent long periods of time with us, Charlie did, and tell\nus stories about his family back home to help him feel better.\nAnything we wanted he'd give. Well I remember one time I asked\nhim for an ammunition box. Now remember our communications\nweren't that perfect. When I said I spoke English you might as\nwell say I spoke pigeon, so uh I asked him for an ammunition box\nwhich I wanted for a lunch box. So uh he said fine, he would he\nwould get me one of those. One evening we could uh, he he\ntrudged in it was raining as it usually was he he tracked in\nthrough the mud, the mile or so from his little encampment, and\nuh he said to us, I've I've got your box. And you know, they\ndon't speak normal English in Scotland either he had a very\nstrong Scotch accent finally we understood what he was saying,\nbut we said to him, what do you mean you've got our box. Where\nit is? Well he said I left it outside. And why'd you leave it\noutside? Well he says it's heavy, it's big. The poor man had\nbrought in one of those great big boxes that you put shells in\nnot where you put those not where you put little bullets in. He\nthought that's what we wanted. Well we we still have that box\nthat he brought us at at such great cost. It it sealed pretty\ngood against uh against the damp and my mother kept clothes in\nit for many years. In fact she just moved a couple of years ago\nand she finally took her winter clothes out of that uh out of\nthe box and said to me, you uh you uh do something with it. And\nI said fine. Well we'll give it to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, and that's probably where it will be.",
        "Question: What uh, what was the physical condition of your\nfamily and the Graumanns and the Janssens, at the time of\nliberation?",
        "Answer: Bad and and getting worse. Because the food situation\nreally was bad and the strain and stress was really telling on\nthe people. I mean I'm reconstructing this afterwards. Uh in\nthe spring of '45 I was really sick and uh that was the time\nthat the northern part of the Netherlands was just starting to\nbe liberated. It wasn't near as dramatic as our liberation\nbecause uh the Nazis just faded away at a certain point because\ntheir supply lines to the east uh had been broken and militarily\nthe northern part of the Netherlands was never forcefully taken.\nBut the famine there was worse than it was in the south. It was\nbad enough with us but at least we had we had scraps of food.\nUh in the north they had nothing. So my father got together as\nbig a package of food as he thought he could manage and uh\nstarted to make his way north because he knew his friends in in\nAmsterdam were starving. And uh the time that he said goodbye\nand going back to Amsterdam was the last time I saw him, cause\nhe took sick on on the road and died. I never saw him again.\nWell I got sick at the same time and uh I was put in the\nhospital and uh never heard that my dad had died. They didn't\ntell me. They were still shielding me. For months they didn't\ntell me that he had died and they kept making up stories as to\nwhere he might be and I guess that's why I have a tough time\nbelieving people even today because people just weren't straight\nwith me. Well, they figured he's a poor sick kid why bother him\nwith the story that his father died and then finally they were\ncaught in their own stories, so you know then no one made up\nmakeup stories and I just had to find out on my own that my dad\nwas dead, which was a very hard thing for me to live down and of\ncourse it was hard on my mother. No need to compare who it was\nharder for, but she depended a lot on him. She, he was her\nwhole life, our lifeline to the world. She remained a real\nGerman house and whatever my dad said, went. So she made\nvery few decisions and was very dependent on my dad. So to have\nhim die at a at a critical time like this when everything was in\nthe shambles was very hard on my mother. Uh the Graumanns uh\ntried to go back to Amsterdam. When uh Mrs. Graumann, Elli,\ncame back to her old surroundings, it hit her even harder what\nhad happened to her son, and couldn't deal with the grief, so\nshe committed suicide. I didn't know about it that at the time\neither. I I heard that afterwards too. So really out of the six\npeople that that started out on the run together in August of\n\"42, uh out of the six people only three survived. And none of\nthe losses was due to Harry. My dad died after liberation. Mrs.\nGraumann of course a few months later, and Michael before we got\nto Harry. So Harry has a perfect record. But uh the survivors,\nthere's there's only half of us. Dr. Graumann uh remarried and\nsettled in uh Topeka, Kansas, where he still lives. He is in\nhis 90's so he's a real survivor. My mother still lives. She\nis uh 85 years old and still goes to work every day here in uh\nthe Washington area. Uh the survivors are are tough people.",
        "Question: If I may, let me go back a little to after, right\nafter the liberation, because I think you've indicated that the,\nit was some months from the time you were liberated before the\nrest of the country was liberated. How did your life and your\nroutine change during that time that the war was still raging in\nthe northern part of the Netherlands?",
        "Answer: Well, it was raging right on our doorstep. In fact it\ngot so bad that uh they evacuated by they I mean the Allied\ncommander evacuated the people in in our pocket of the\ncountryside and they took over the farm and and made a\ncommunications center out of it. Uh Harry didn't like this at\nall because in these unsettled times he was afraid that people\nwould steal whatever little he had left, but uh reluctantly he\nuh evacuated the family to a cousin of of his wife's. His name\nwas Vilam Yosten (ph), who all of a sudden got uh a couple of\ndozen people on his doorstep because uh as I was saying several\nof Harry's relatives had had been not really hiding but living\nwith us uh more or less openly uh to escape the famine, so uh it\nwas amazing that this Vilam Yosten with with hardly any notice\ntook on this whole troop of people. And we lived everywhere. I\nremember uh by we I mean all 24 or 25, 26 of us. Uh my family,\nmy mom, dad and I lived in an old pigsty. Uh again an\ninteresting experience for a Jewish family. Uh my father was\njust millimeters short of six feet tall and he had the hardest\ntime fitting into this pigsty but as I say it rained steadily\nthrough that time, so we had to be somewhere inside, so we\nstayed in the pigsty and my dad squeezed himself into it the\nbest he could and uh continued with his usual pursuits. He\nalways had a little notebook of some kind and I still can\npicture him sitting there and on some straw that we had put on\nthe ground, making notes to himself and I uh dragged in one of\nmy best finds uh a soldier who had gotten so excited at finding\naa little urchin that spoke English and turned out to be a\nJewish urchin, that he had come, had to absolutely come and see\nthe rest of the family. The soldier was literally delirious.\nHis name was Godfrey Langdon (ph), also an older soldier who was\nfighting a very personal war. He was Jewish and we were the\nfirst actual honest-to-God Jewish people that he had come across\nin the territories that he liberated. And I later heard that he\nhad been through all the African campaigns and the French\nCampaign and the Belgium Campaign, but I guess they were so busy\nfighting they never met any people. Or never liberated any\npeople identifiable as Jews. This man absolutely opened up\nhimself to us. He gave us everything he had and there were no\nlimits. Uh anything that you mentioned he'd do. Although the\none thing that we were the most scared to ask, because we had\nbeen told repeatedly not to ask, which is to use their\ncommunications network. And as I told you the countryside was\nin a Shambles and my parents' relatives uh had and we knew they\nhad escaped to the United States and and Britain. And we wanted\nin the worst way to find out how they were and to let them know\nthat we had survived...\nEND OF TAPE\n...which was rather worthy. They could only have supposed that\nwe had not. And uh well he was in the signal corps and uh we\ntook a chance. Uh we all took a chance, and he decided to adopt\nus as his relatives and write letters to his uh then newly\nacquired aunts and uncles telling telling them that his other\nrelatives had had survived the war. And got away with it. And\neven in the midst of a battle zone we received uh letters from\nour relatives through military mail, even when he when his unit\nmoved on, he would sometimes trudge through the whole night just\nto deliver us letters and maybe a little and get back\nto his unit. Even when he couldn't get leave he would do that\ninstead of sleep. So this is how strongly some people felt and\nGodfrey Langdon stayed a friend till the day he died. I still\nhave uh prayer books that he gave the family, so that we would\nhave something something Jewish.",
        "Question: Is there any other story that you'd like to tell us\nabout the farm?",
        "Answer: About the Yosten farm. Well the Yosten's were were\nalso an amazingly hospitable people and they are still friends\nof ours to this day. Their farm if possible is even further\noutback than the Janssen farm, in that it 1S more remote\nalthough it was then and still is a lot more modern and uh I I\nreally enjoyed farming with these people because uh because they\nthey had scale to their to their outfit and they taught me how\nto milk and uh I helped them bring in the harvest. Uh I really\nI really did well in those days because I was just like a bird\nlet out of a cage. I had to try everything and people responded\nto that. I still remember, you know everybody made a pet out of\nme. Uh the older Yosten daughters took me and as I said taught\nme how to milk and how to farm and I guess this is one reason\nthat I went into agriculture. I'm a paper farmer. I I shuffle\npapers for the U.S. Department of Agriculture but I have a life\nlong interest in farming.",
        "Question: Can you tell me what happened to you and your family\nafter liberation?",
        "Answer: Well, we've touched on that some. My my mother finally\nuh after she buried my dad, made her way to Amsterdam, while I\nwas in in under quarantine in the hospital in , which was\nreally bad for me because I had I had been penned up long enough\nand you know here I had just been let free and loose and then\nthey put me ina glass cage literally, and medical facilities at\nthat time were extremely primitive still and they were afraid\nthey had an epidemic on their hands. So uh they put me in\nQuarantine and and fed me through a slot. And I was well by that\npoint when they when they started feeding me through the slot.\nI was well. They pushed books and food through there and for\nthe rest they would just shout through the walls and that was\nthe only contact I had with the outside world. A terrible time\nI had but uh Mrs. Graumann who really felt miserable most of the\ntime rose to this occasion and she stuck around that hospital\nday and night to make sure I got taken care of while she was\nobviously also gripped by the fact that my mother had had to go\nbury her husband. Must have been a difficult position for my\nmother whether to go and go to my father's funeral and abandon\nher sick child or have the funeral occur without her and stay\nwith the child. Well, she decided to go to the to the funeral.\nThat in itself was was an amazing thing because my dad died\namong strangers. The only Jewish family in that little town uh\nthat had come back took him in, and that also became a life-long\nfriendship because uh shortly after they took him in, while he\nwaS waiting for the necessary travel papers to make the best of\nhis trip north, he got si...he got very sick and died ina\nperiod of days, and here they had the body of this stranger on\ntheir hands whom they really didn't know much about except some\nrough idea where the rest of his family was. Well, the managed\nto find another returning uh Jewish person who had who had\nsurvived the camps, and uh that uh that person found the car and\ndriver somewhere. How they managed that I don't know but they\nfound their way through the rain, through the dark, to the\nimpossible-to-find outback place where my mother was, and in the\namazing short period of time of two days, and said you know, if\nyou want to be at your husband's funeral, now is the time and\nthey had to break the news to her. Well they took her back in\nthe car. Managed to scrounge up enough gasoline and managed to\nbury my father within the ritual maximum length of time that you\ncan keep a body out. I think it's three days. And uh they were\nvery orthodox and didn't know how how we were oriented so they\nprepared everything for an orthodox funeral. In the midst of of\na famine in the war zone, they were extremely kind to strangers.\nAfter all these people had seen so much death that they were\nable to find the compassion to deal with one more death. It's\namazing. But they did. They were super compassionate to my\nmother and she still can't get over today what hospitality and\nwhat uh what support she found in which obviously were complete\nstrangers. But she made her way back to Amsterdam, and joined\nup with uh her friends who had maintained contact\nmore or less throughout the whole hiding period. In the\nparlance of the times they were called our periscope. We were\nthe submerged people, the underdikers (ph), the people in\nhiding, and the the imagery that was used, ima...imagery that\nwas used was of a submarine so the people who knew where you\nwere were your periscope. So she went to the periscope family\nwho took her and then later when I came out of the hospital, me\nin also. They had a relatively small apartment but they made\nroom for us. In fact I had my own room. They emptied out an\nattic room which I converted into my own little space and they\nhad uh an apartment on the very last city canal in Amsterdam, so\nI could look out over the countryside and it was a good, quiet\nplace for me to try to get my myself together.",
        "Question: Continuing along that line, can you tell me how you\ncame to the United States?",
        "Answer: Well, as I indicated, my relatives on both sides of the\nfamily had uh in the last years when it was possible immigrated\nout of continental Europe. My father's family had gone to\nLondon and we visit them, visited them within the first say\ntwelve months of the time that we got back to Amsterdam. But my\nmother really wanted to go to her side of the family, which was\nuh in America. I didn't want to go but once again people paid\nno attention to me whatsoever, to what I wanted. I just was\nglad to get back to my old neighborhood and try to make contact\nwith my old friends which wasn't easy because I hadn't seen them\nfor three, more than three years and for a kid that's a good\nchunk of his life. And uh it was very hard to make contact back\nwith people whose lives had gone on while mine had stood still.\nAnd I was just starting to do that when my mom says we're\npacking up. We're going to the United States. This to me was\nbad news cause I had seen just enough wild west and gangster\nmovies that I figured that's what the United States was\ninhabited by and I didn't want to live with the likes of Al\nCapone and Wild Bill Hickcock and uh so I I didn't uh like that\nat all. Uh they they told us in various letters that that\nwasn't really so. That there were really civilized places in\nthe United States like New York and Cleveland, Ohio, where there\nwere no gangsters, at least not that you could see them ona\nregular basis and uh no Indians whatsoever. And that people did\nsuch things as uh parents went to work and kids went to school\nand in their spare time make money selling newspapers. Well,\nselling newspapers. That really did it because only the poorest\nof the very poor outcasts in western Europe of the time sold\nnewspapers and to be told that I would be making money on the\nside selling newspapers was was like bad news and I wasn't at\nall interested in going there and I didn't want to have anything\nto do with going to the United States. But my mother didn't\nhave much of a choice. She was completely out of money and\nassets. She was out of energy. She was out of everything and\nshe needed all the support that she could get from her family,\nso probably from her point of view she did wisely and and just\nmoved to the United States, where we were received also very,\nwith with open arms by our relatives. We lived with my mother's\nSister and her family, her husband and son, for al...almost two\nyears in avery cramped apartment because remember they were\njust getting over being refugees themselves. My uncle migrated\nto the United States when he was in his sixties so he wasn't\nvery employable, so he didn't make very much money and uh my\naunt was making money doing sewing work on a piece, on a piece\nby piece basis. They call it piece work. So they weren't very\nwell off. They lived in an apartment which was small already\nfor them and then they had to take in two more people. In two\nyears I never heard one unkind word. Like they must have gotten\nmad at me plenty of times cause I told you I was an urchin. I\nwasn't an easy kid to deal with. But they dealt with me\npatiently and lovingly and helped civilize me.",
        "Question: Can you tell me a little bit about your life in\nAmerica from the time that you came here, where you went to\nschool, and what you ended up doing?",
        "Answer: The beginning was very hard. Uh there were there were\nor if they were they weren't Jews, but we experienced no social\nservice support at all. It was like there was no Jewish\ncommunity in Cleveland from for all they did for the refugees\nthat came in, from my personal experience. My personal\nexperience with the with the Jewish social service agencies was\nawful. To the extent that they tried to help us they made\nthings worse. Uh they welshed on every agreement that they ever\nmade. Never came through with anything that we expected and we\nwe didn't have anything further to do with them. So what\nhappened is I was just dropped into a regular school, and what\nEnglish that I knew was pigeon English and English English as we\ncalled it then, the American lingo was completely undecipherable\nto me. If people talked to me face to face like you're doing\nwith me right now I could understand them fairly well. I could\nask questions if I didn't. In the class I couldn't understand\nanything. In fact frequently the only thing I understood all\nday long was the questions they asked me on the materials that\nthey had just covered. Questions directed personally at me I\ncould understand easier than lectures. I just couldn't\nunderstand, and it was I was totally frustrated and the adults\nwere totally preoccupied making a living and I was the only\nlittle kid because as I said my uncle had his son living with\nhim but he was a grown son. He had just come back from the war.\nHe had his own problems. He had he had uh fought with the\nAmerican Armies and was just trying to re-stabilize his life, so\nhe didn't have time with me so here I was again, thrown\ncompletely on my own resources without anybody to talk to or\nanybody to help me over this very difficult adjustment to a toa\nsociety and the customs and a culture I knew nothing about. Uh\nI went to high school. Uh my second year uh I started I started\nin the ninth grade which was then in junior high school, but\nmost of my experience was in high school and especially in high\nschool the kids just cut me cold. They were nouveau riche uh\nAmerican Jewish kids and they didn't want to have anything to do\nwith uh with refugees. And uh the only way in which I made\ncontact was through a drama club and since all of usS were acting\nthen and since I was acting all the time anyway I could fit in\nthere. And that's how I got to know some kids my own age and\nand started making friends, so the drama club was my salvation.\nI was never a very good actor in the sense of being a thespian\nbut I was a very enthusiastic member of the of the drama club,\nand thespian iS a good word to use because the honor society in\nthat community was called the Thespian Society, and the day that\nthey made me a Thespian I knew that I had arrived in some area\nthat I really wanted to be in. After that uh I kind of drifted\ninto college and then drifted into Israel, thinking that maybe\nthat's where I'd like to be, but I didn't feel comfortable there\neither and besides the U.S. government was sending me\nthreatening letters that if I didn't come back they would call\nme a draft dodger because at that time everybody had to go into\nthe into the Army, so I came back and I was promptly drafted\ninto the Army, and uh after that I went to graduate school and\nStarted working for agricultural companies doing writing, public\nrelations, information type work which I am still doing this\nday. My mother benefitted from the fact that she had been\neverything for my dad in the time that he operated his own\nbusiness and gave all those lectures and talks and\npresentations. She absorbed enough art history so that uh even\nthough she had no formal education at all she was raised to be\nuh a lady. She was raised to be a hostess and an entertainer\nand a manager of servants, not to live in a poor neighborhood in\nthe United States. But uh this way she was able to get the job\nin the library in an art museum and that's the kind of work she\nstill does today.",

        "Answer: Yes, my grandparents were living. That is to say uh I\nI got to know and meet one from each side of the family. Uh I\nknew my grandmother Dana (ph) who was my father's mother, and\neven better I knew my mother's father, whose name was Jacob\nKramer and uh he lived with us.",
        "Answer: Well, my early childhood was not unusual for an\nimmigrant family. Even though I was born in the Netherlands, I\nwas barely born in the Netherlands. My parents escaped from\nBerlin earlier the same year that I was born which was 1933.\nAnd uh they settled in the Netherlands at at for them a very bad\ntime. It was the midst of a de...depression and uh they could\nbarely escape with what little possessions they had. They were\nrelatively young married couple so they had a hard time\neconomically and as I say they they worked together pretty well.\nAnd my father stitched together little bit of this anda little\nbit of that so that they could make a living. And so actually I\nwas raised more by my grandfather in in that period of my life\nthan by either parents and I liked my grandfather a whole lot\nbetter for that reason because since my father worked out of the\nhome, why it was always shush here and shush there and don't\ntouch and and make scarce. And grandfather, Opa (ph) I called\nhim, Opa Kramer, uh he took time. He had the time. He was\nretired so uh he dragged him around with him and really had more\nof an influence probably on my early education, preschool, than\nmy parents. I remember usually in the mornings, he would take\nme to the playground just to get away from being under foot at\nhome and in the afternoon he'd take me to his pinochle game. So\nthe mornings he made like a child and in the afternoon I made\nlike a grandparent and sat very quietly on the chairs. I\nwatched the old, old men, all refugees from Germany, play\npinochle and drink tea and tell stories and that's how I grew up\nbilingual, at least bilingual. Uh my father was ina ina very\ninternational type of of occupation and there were always people\nfrom all over coming to our house because that's, as I said,\nwhere my dad conducted his business. Early in the morning\nalready, my mother was an excellent hostess. She made, was\nwell-known for her breakfasts so people who came in on the\nmorning train from Paris would come in and sit down at our at\nour table and and uh talk, chit chat, and talk business. My\nfather was an excellent linguist. He was equally at home in\nGerman and in French and in Italian and in Dutch, and his\nEnglish was quite good as well. He has a classical education.\nHe spoke uh uh could could certainly read fluently Latin and\nGreek, so it it was a very actually lively I would say and\ninternational experience that I was exposed to. So even though\nmy father had a very strict rule because he was really upset\nthat uh the country that he loved so dearly, Germany, went for\nsuch for such crazy and criminal theories and activities as took\nplace under Hitler. He had a very strict rule. No German.\nAbsolutely not. They uh, my father went to to the trouble of\ntranslating German nursery rhymes and songs, children's songs\nhe didn't know any Dutch ones and I don't why he didn't take the\ntrouble to learn. Maybe that's hard for parents. At any rate\nuh the way out that he choose was he kept uh the German songs\nand nursery rhymes and just translated them. And uh made my\nmother uh sing or recite the translations. Which she did\nfaithfully while he was around but it was much easier for her\nto do it in the original German, and so I learned them both\nways, and of course my grandfather didn't pay any attention to\nwhat made my father said about that and uh as soon as we were\nout of ear shot, that was the language he talked to me. So as I\nsay I was really raised bilingual and bicultural. But that had\nto be subrosa because we had to hide it from my dad because the\nthe outside effect that we were to give is that we were a Dutch\nfamily and uh he wanted to forget about ever having been German.",
        "Answer: Yeah. Well, of course, things went very much in\nstages. I think a lot of people who've who've lived through\nthat have have explained it pretty much the same way. Uh the\nGermans, the Nazis, and it's hard to make that distinction, uh\nbecause the Nazis swept everyone along with them, uh the Germans\nwhen they invaded the Netherlands uh were an occupying power and\nin in the beginning made a real effort I think to kind of get\nthe population on their side. So uh our first reaction when we\nsaw that Holland was uh going to be lost from the standpoint of\nof the fortunes of war, uh my father tried to pack up the family\nand we went, we jumped in a taxicab that he managed to secure\nsomehow, and uh drove across the narrow neck of the northern\npart of the Netherlands to the harbor city of ,\nwhere uh we heard that they were sending refugee boats to pick\nup people, but we came just an hour too late maybe. At that time\nthey were already blowing up the harbor installations and one of\nmy earliest recollections is just seeing the whole harbor area\nof go up in flames. The reason that was so impressive is\nthey had oil storage tanks there and uh of course that burned\nguite effectively lots of fire, lots of smoke. And uh a Dutch\ntrooper at the edge of turned us back and said it's too\nlate and sent us back to Amsterdam. And then we were really\nscared because we saw Amsterdam burning too but they were\nblowing up the oil storage tanks there too in the harbor and so\nuh once we got back things got fairly well back to normal never\ncompletely because you know there was an occupying power in the\nstreet. And again some of my earliest recollection is walking\nto school. At the time we we Jewish kids were still going to\nthe regular school. There was no thought of of segregating us.\nUh but the Nazis one time just just for fun uh ran one of their\nuh uh personnel carriers up on the sidewalk just to watch the\nkids scurry. So they they were very much uh an occupying power\nand then gradually started tightening the screws, obviously\nfirst a little tighter on the Jews and and uh but right behind\nit on the rest of the population until at the very end no one,\nJewish or non-Jewish, escaped extreme depravation. I mean the\nJews were deported and gassed, but the rest of the people had a\nvery hard time as well. And uh after the war, you know, I I\nwent back to the Netherlands for about a half a year, and one of\nthe interesting, for me, things that I did was I joined a\ntherapy group because I'm having a hard time living all this\nstuff down. And I figured, in Dutch, on the scene, that might\nhelp me quite a bit. And there were some people in there my age\nand when raised that this was an issue for me, the subject\ncompletely switched from all the troubles they had at home and\nthe troubles that they had at work, and they were completely\nthere with me, talking about uh the experiences in the\nNetherlands, because no one came off free from it. But you know\nthe early experiences that I had for example is that the Nazis,\nthe Germans hard to hard to distinguish as I say built a wall\ndown the center of my school. One side for the Jewish kids, one\nside for the non-Jewish kids. And uh that was unusual. Usually\nthey picked one school for the Jews and another school for the\nnon-Jews. That that's how how it was dramatized that things\nwere happening, things that were happening that segregated out\nthe Jews and that I was one of them and that I was in trouble.",
        "Answer: Yeah. Right. Well, uh as I say, tightening the screws\nwas done on my family in a very dramatic way in that uh they\nfirst pulled my dad's work permit so that my dad, who was very\nmuch in the public eye uh giving lectures at public museums,\ngoing to auctions and so forth, couldn't openly do that anymore.\nSo I uh I heard it's hard to know after all I was six, seven\nyears old it's hard to know what I remember and what I'm\nreconstructing from what people tell me but I think I was very\nwell aware that my father was uh having troubles with his\nbusiness and where these troubles were coming from, that he had\nto do double bookkeeping and work out tricks with his friends so\nthey could stay on in business and make it appear that he really\nwas not. Uh they actually came to raid our place several times.\nFirst they came for silver and gold and the usual things that uh\nthat they that they liked to steal, which was always done in\nvery formal way, with receipts and stamps and all that sort of\nthing. Uh and uh later on they came by stages to steal my dad's\nart collection which was his stock for for his dealership in in\nart, and I remember the first time they came around they they\nsent the Amsterdam police. Those people must have really been in\na very you know almost untenable position because they didn't\nwant to do this. But they were made to do it and they had to\nwork somehow and they were the police. They were taken over.\nSo I remember when they came, my dad was out. He wasn't even\nsupposed to be out of the city because he wasn't even allowed to\nride public transportation anymore in those days. So uh mother\nmade up a story as to where he was, and uh the police did\neverything they do to to calm her down they said don't worry\nabout it uh, we don't even like to do this job but we have to do\nit, and they said if there is anything particular you'd like to\ndo before we start our work, that's fine. Now this was a hint\nto her that if she wanted to make one of those paintings that\nthey knew were were around disappear, they wouldn't mind. But\nyou didn't know who you could trust, so here again I'm telling\nyou part of what I remember, part of what I reconstruct but I\nstill remember my mother taking one of those paintings, a little\none, and just letting her coat drop over it and see what would\nhappen. And they pretended like it wasn't there. So gradually\nevery time she'd pass through the house she she pushed that that\npainting further and further until she finally pushed it into a\ncloset. Then they came and listed everything on official forms\nand sealed it in the closet. Put the seal of the city of\nAmsterdam on our on our hall closet, and that was the end of my\ndad's stock. Most of it they didn't get, but they got four or\nfive good paintings which we've tried to in the interim to get\nback, unsuccessfully. The stuff that we got back was all saved\nfor us by friends and neighbors. But uh the stuff that was\nconfiscated, including my own bicycle, we never got back. And\nhow people can sit with wellknown pieces of art, because my dad\ndealt in good stuff, that they know is stolen, this very day is\nhard to believe. So you know the Holocaust goes on because\npeople did not make restitution, not in a general way. But the\nyour question was what changed? Well, uh what what changed then\nuh is that the action against property changed to action against\npeople. Now first they called up the the young folks and they\ntold them, I remember I had a uh friend of the family that that\nplayed with me quite a bit. Uh he was he was called up and he\nwas glad to go because in the beginning it was not at all clear\nwhat was happening to people that were being called up for uh\nwork related uh for war related work in Germany. They told these\nfolks uh, come work for us a half a year and we'll let you go to\nPalestine. And so the kids were were anxious to go. And they\nwent willingly. Sent letters back, sent letters back ona\nregular basis. And when the letters stopped coming my parents\nknew. They knew even though nobody ever really said this out\nloud. So it was still a surprise the first day when they\nstarted picking up people in the street. And my father ran into\none of those uh street raids but fortunately he had a lot of\nfriends and uh one of the stores that he was dealing with, one\nof the neighborhood stores, the storekeeper pulled him off the\nstreet and says you don't want to go there. They're loading up\nJews. So he had he hid him behind the counter and then after\nafter curfew the Germans set an eight o'clock curfew on Jews in\nthose days uh he slipped home and thought that that things were\nat least in the short run going to be better when they made a\nnight raid on our block. And uh my dad was trapped, because uh\nit was very clear that they were coming at us from all sides,\nand uh that there was, that you couldn't just walk away from it.\nSo my dad decided to go out over the roof and you know one of\none of the real uh high grabbing experiences that that I have to\ndeal with is that I heard him discuss what some of the options\nwere. His friends came over because they were worried. People\ntook took risks. They, Dutch people supported their Jewish\nfriends, discussed what the options were, decided to go up over\nthe roof. I had been told over and over again, don't go on the\nroof. And, but I knew just how to climb out the window and get\non the roof and I knew he was going to do that and try to escape\nover the roof and I was really worried. Nobody said word one to\nme, except they suddenly noticed I was standing there. Somebody\ngrabbed me, pushed me in bed, pulled the covers over me even\nthough I was protesting that I didn't put on my pajamas yet, and\nSaid you be quiet and you act like you're asleep. And uh just\nabout that time I heard the uh raiding parties stomp up the\nStairs. They, they the the real Nazis did everything they did\nloud, so you could always tell when they were Nazis and Nazi\nsympathizers. They would \"Hail Hitler\" real loud, and they had\nthat opportunity cause we, unfortunately, had downstairs\nneighbors that were Nazi sympathizers. When theysaw those\nraiders coming in, they opened the door and spent a lot of time\nhailing and and shouting at each other in the hall, which was\ngood cause it gave my dad extra time to get out. Finally they\nstomped up the stairs, stomped on the door. Finally one of my\ndad's friends let them in and quite innocently asked what they\nwanted, and although they screamed real loudly that they were\nlooking for my dad and where was he and uh you know I heard my\nmother try to explain that she didn't know, maybe he had been\npicked up in the streets she didn't know where my dad was. And\nI heard them get madder and madder at my mom and finally tell\nher that they were taking her. And uh so they did. They barely\ngave her a chance to take her purse. And uh they dragged her\noff and put her in one of their paddy wagons and hauled her off.\nWell, you said how, how did it happen then that you left town.\nWell, uh things were formal and crazy at the same time. There\nwere rules for everything which were frequently broken and were\nup to the whim of which ever commander was in charge. My mother\nwas taken to a theater which was uh known as the Holland\n, uh which which later became known as the\nbecause they they were no longer doing plays there. They were\nuSing this aS a concentration point for for people that they\npicked up, for for you know, for the shipment. And uh while my\nmother was at this , at this theater, uh she spotted a\nfriend from across the street uh whose daughter was quite\nfriendly with uh his name was Fritz Salten (ph), and Fritz was\nuh working for the Jewish Council to try and and get some\ncomfort and and support for the people that had been arrested,\ndetained or whatever word you want to use. And uh my mother\ncalled him over and said hey uh Fritz, is there any way we, I I\ncan get out of there. And he said well, he says I know that\nyour dad has done, well, she he would have said of course your\nhusband, uh I know that your husband has done work for the\nJewish Council. They're letting people off sometimes uh that\nwhose relatives worked for the Jewish Council. Why don't you\ntry that? And so, uh through Fritz we we got a letter in the\nright format saying that my dad had done work as a teacher for\nthe for the Jewish Council, and uh was the was the\nfamous commander, infamous commander of of that uh particular\noperation, let my mother go. The only one he let go that day.\nSo that's why I say things were very arbitrary. That day he\ndecided to honor that particular rule. So I mean my parents\ncouldn't have it dramatized very much more uh extremely that it\nwas time to get out of there, but where to go. (Cough) My my\nparents had one real close uh couple who were their friends whom\nthey had asked already prelude to that time to kind of scout\naround a little bit and just find anything that might work to\nget us out of there. And that was just in the beginning of some\nnegotiation with with with them, very shadowy group uh who had\nhad one front person by the name of drink a\nmoment whom Franz, that's the husband of that couple, had\ncoincidentally just gone to see the very night that uh that they\nraided our place. They were unaware that we were being raided.\nSo they hurried up these negotiations and uh even though they\nseemed very haphazarded what apparently it would be is that uh\nthey would, that this group then of adventurers would smuggle us\nsouth in a gasoline truck through Belgium, through France, up to\na little enclave known as Free France uh which was kind of in\nbetween the uh occupied and nonoccupied areas of Europe, and\nwhich functioned as kind of a door, a lastminute door for people\nto escape. So in August of '42 when these events happened, uh we\nwe left and went to the house of this Ari Hayward (ph), again to\nto see you know what what he could arrange to get us away\nfurther, so those were the circumstances that led to our\nleaving.",
        "Answer: Well, the hardest part I think for my parents in the\nleaving was that they had to leave my grandfather. He was uh\ngetting senile and diabetic and there was no question of making\nthe run with him, so they left him in an oldage home and it was\nvery hard for us to leave him. Of course, they didn't tell me\nthat we that we were going on the run. They told me that we\nwere going on vacation, which was credible since it was August,\nthe big vacation month in Europe, and they said well, we're just\ngoing to go on vacation to this new friend of ours, Mr. Hayward,\nand uh you can play with his kids and uh and we hope we'll have\na pretty good time. Uh I didn't believe that but I also didn't\nhave the nerve to ask what was really going on. And you know,\nlater on I've I've given a lot of thought to this. Do you tell\nyour kids what goes on if it's if it's tough news? And I've\ncome to the conclusion that you do at least you tell a tenyear\nOld. I was eight then. You tell an eight year old because\neight year olds understand a whole lot. You don't need to tell\nthem all the nitty gritty details, but you do need to tell them\nwhat's going on, because one of one of the most difficult things\nfor me is the confusion. Hearing one thing and seeing another.\nKnowing that my parents were telling me stories. Don't want to\nsay lies because they probably thought they were protecting me.\nCertainly thought that they were protecting me. But it was no\nprotection. It was crazy making. It was crazy making. And we\nstayed uh with the the Haywards a couple of weeks until the\nNazis raided the place, and they lost their nerve, and they\ndidn't have any alternatives ready, so those were very difficult\nweeks from uh oh from mid-August to uh mid-September when uh we\nJust wandered the countryside from one temporary shelter to\nanother until we finally wound up in the bath house of a uh\nretreat center. It sounds too fancy it was just a little place\nout in the woods uh operated by a Catholic order and it uh was\nnot being used for anything particular at the time some some\ncame their from time to time to go swimming. We\nignored them. They ignored us and we each pretended the others\nweren't there, but of course they knew. And uh things were very\nunsettled. There was still frequently a question of is the\ntruck going to come, is the truck not going to come and uh\nwhat's to happen next because incredible as it may seem, we were\nhaving our meals catered at this retreat center. It was very\nstrange uh about meal time we you would suddenly see a little\nboy appear in that clearing in the woods with a with a package\nof food for all of us. And this boy that made the delivery was\nincredible because you know when you and I walk the woods you\nhear the leaves crackle and twigs crack didn't hear anything.\nSuddenly the kid was there, and there was our food and then he\nwould slink away and disappear. Well, this was obviously not\nanything that could go on. In fact one of the things that I\nremember is how extremely worried my dad was. We were having\nbeautiful September weather, unusual for the Netherlands nice\nwarm sunny afternoons where we could go swimming. I mean it was\ngreat, in the swimming pool right uh we had to go swimming\nactually cause we at that time had only uh the clothes that that\nuh that we carried with us on our back because we were on the\nmove so much and uh while Dad and I went swimming uh my mother\nand the lady in the other couple that was hiding with us, uh did\nthe laundry in the other end of the swimming pool. Uh but as I\nwas starting to say, my dad was complaining about the good\nweather cause he says how long can this weather last. When the\ncold weather comes, we'll freeze here. There was of course no\nway to heat the bath house of a of a of a Swimming pool anda\nremote camp. So you know, when fall weather comes, particularly\nsunny weather, I find myself getting very uncomfortable and I\nhave to remind myself you know, that that harks back to these\ntimes and I'm only recently able to enjoy beautiful fall weather\nbecause I keep telling people the bad (ph) winter is going to\ncome. Now the the that 1S un a very bad position we were in\nbecause I, it was quite clear that these adventurers we, we\ntend to want to see people in terms of good or bad but that\ndoesn't always work. These uh these people that Ari Hayward put\nus in contact with were good/bad. They probably had some good\nmotivations and uh from most of the stories that I hear about\nthem repeated talk about how much money and when are you going\nto pay us and so on. They were in it principally for the money.\nAnd they were in a bad place because they couldn't deliver.\nThey had gotten their deposit I am now reconstructing uh it's\nvery clear that they had gotten their deposit but uh my father\nand and his friend uh Heinz Graumann who with also a wife and\nson was hiding along with us I didn't trust him at all. I\ndidn't give him any more money than he could get away with. I\nremember those discussions. And uh it's amazing. There's a\nDutch proverb that says little pictures have big ears. Uh this\nlittle picture had very big ears because I tried to find out as\nmuch as I could about what was going on because nobody was\ngoing to be telling me anything at all. Uh these people there,\nthen these adventurers were ina bad way. What were they going\nto do with us? And as we know reconstructed, they decided to\nkill us. It had a number of advantages. First of all they knew\nthat if the Germans got a hold of us they would do more, they\nwould do worse than kill us, and secondly since they had already\nfigured out where Heinz and my dad were were keeping their\nmoney, they could get paid instantly and not have to take any\nmore risks with us. So uh at the at that very time however the\nregular Dutch underground was starting to make some contact with\nthat nebulous group of adventurers, and uh while they were\nexploring ways to get rid of us, they also explored a way of\nhanding us over to the regular Dutch underground in that\nparticular area of the Netherlands which was the southeastern\ncorner, east of . And uh .....\nEND OF TAPE\n...so the story that they told us was that they had some people\nthat maybe could help them and uh one by one they would they\nwould uh which would which would be safer than herding a whole\ngroup of six people through the woods one by one they would\ndeliver us to these people, whereas at least a good portion of,\nat least two of these people were definitely decided on the\nmurder route. They uh took Michael, the the other boy that was\nhiding with us uh he was considerably older than I, I was I was\neight and he was probably around fifteen or sixteen at the time\nthey took him first and they did in fact kill him. And uh later\non uh I was told they found graves that, shallow graves, that\nthey had pre-dug for all us. So they were really serious about\ndoing us in. But uh killing is hard. People uh that talk about\nkilling say uh your first killing really is the hardest. When\nyou see a a vibrant young boy that had just been laughing and\njoking with you and you suddenly split open his skull and you\nsee his blood that does something to people. And from the\ntestimony that uh came out in the trial afterwards, the person\nthat uh swung the shovel that kill...killed Michael, came to\ntrial after liberation. It was clear that uh that the\ngruesomeness of of actually having done the act uh helped deter\nthem from killing the rest of us, and then they tried the route\nof handing us over to the regular underground, which they did.",
        "Answer: Well, at at first we were still split up and uh my\nparents and I were brought to the house of uh Harry Janssen,\nJanssen we would say in Dutch, uh a smallscale farmer and\nprofessional thrasher who lived in the outback behind uh the\nvillage of Durna (ph) which as I say is east of and uh\nhe was uh loosely connected with the underground. The\nunderground has to be loosely connected or else it doesn't\nfunction in occupied territories. And uh that was an interim\nplacement. They were going to decide what to do next. And uh\nto our surprise, after a while, the Graumanns showed up there\ntoo, because the people that were supposed to have taken them in\ndidn't and the last time we saw the members of this nebulous\ngroup of adventurers that I talked about was when they delivered\nthe Graumanns. Said they would come back for them and never\ndid. And uh all the connections that were supposed to have\nworked for Harry to to get us away or out of the country or\nwhatever, didn't work. So he inherited us. And although he\nnever expected to be hiding five Jews for any length of time, he\ndid. And I think the relationship immediately became quite\nclose because of course in the beginning, no one knew what had\nbecome of Michael. And uh Harry could see Elli Graumann,\nMichael's mother, wilting more and more each day, not knowing\nwhat had happened to her son. So he he uh he started the\nunderground into a manhunt. And they combed the place till they\nfinally found one of the people of what I have been calling that\nnebulous group, and they nabbed himand interrogated him till\nthey, till he told the truth, and showed where where Michael was\nburied. So that dramatized to Harry you know the the type of\npickle that we were in, and I guess kind of gradually at first,\nweek by week, he decided to to become the person to to shelter\nus, take charge of us. And he did that. He did this two years\nalmost to the day till we were liberated, despite raids, despite\nsearches specifically of his place, despite interrogation, this\nman was a master at dissimilation and withstanding uh\ninterrogation. He could make up stories. He was a natural\nraconteur. We kids loved him because he could tell us kids\nstories too. A marvelous storyteller. That came in very handy\nfor him, cause he'd make up some story and it always worked.\nLike one time I remember there was a search specifically of his\nplace. They came to he he had his contacts and he had been\nwarned uh that there would be a search of his place. And TI I\nhad the measles. I was really sick. And you Know we had\nvarious places that we would hide out when the word came that\nthere'd be a search, but there was no question it would have\nbeen inhumane to stick me into one of these places so he stuck\ntwo of his kids uh about the same age in bed with me it was\nObvi...it was quite common in poor uh families for several kids\nto sleep together, but that was not the usual way that I slept.\nAnd the other two kids had the measles too I think, and so they\nthey stuck them, he stuck them, all three of us, in in one of\nthe bedrooms, and put a big sign on the door, \"Quarantined\", and\nso when the search party came through, he says feel free to look\nanyplace. I've got nothing to hide he says, but don't go in\nthere. I've got some really sick kids in there, and the doctor\nput a sign on there \"quarantined.\" I don't want you guys to get\nsick. So well after they made a perfunctory look inside and\nthey say three real sick kids in there, threw the door closed,\nand uh you know, he got us through just by talk. And even\nthough he had some very very good places that he tried at\nvarious place, at various times to hide us, the most interesting\none was a double wall. In order to picture how the double wall\nfunctioned, you have to you have to picture a very primitive\nfarmstead, and the farmsteads in in Holland uh from an earlier\nera like this one dated from, had the animals and the people\nunder one roof. The people would live up front, and the animals\nwould be in the back. Very convenient if you go milking cause\nyou just open up a door and you're in the stable and you can\nmilk the cows and bring the milk right into the kitchen. In\nfact that's what they did. Well, in this wall, they had they\nhad two walls then one separating the house from the main part\nof the stable and then another separation between the cows and\nthe horses. And that's where they built the double wall. And\nhe had a friend, a uh a bricklayer come in, and duplicate the\nthe wall that was already there exactly as it was uh oh about\nmaybe uh a couple of feet away, and uh then to get to that place\nthey would hoist us up to the rafters and let us down with a\nrope so that we'd between the two walls and of course there was\nno door. Uh these raids always came at the worst times. I\nremember one time my mother, my mother had a severe case of\ndiarrhea when the alarms came and they hoisted her in there with\nuh with uh a potty and uh can you imagine those poor people that\nhad to sit there for I think twenty-four hours with someone who\nhad an over-flowing potty of diarrhea. Ugh. Fortunately they\nhid me someplace else that time. They hid me in a haystack.",
        "Answer: Well, I think I think everybody was quite aware that in\norder to go, to keep from going stircrazy, you have to keep\npeople busy. And uh the Janssens increasingly gave us work to\ndo. We peeled all their potatoes, and when I say all, potatoes\nwas a Staple and uh the Janssens were sheltering not only Jews\nbut at various times various members of their rather extensive\nfamily that had moved to the city and were running out of food.\nSo there was uh one other chicken house full of people. Uh\nHarry used to say how fortunate that the Nazis stole all our\nchickens. This way we can house the people. We can house the\nrefugees. There's another chicken house full and sometimes some\nof the other buildings. I had relatives in them too. So we\nstrung the beans and peeled the potatoes. Something that uh\npeople find hard to believe we strung tobacco and Holland is\nnot known aS a tobacco raising country, but uh you know, we were\ntalking a little earlier how starved people were for for these\nCigarettes or anything resembling cigarettes, so they found some\nvariety that would grow there and people took tremendous risks\nsmuggling uh seeds for tobacco which we then grew secretly and\nstrung secretly. There was a lot of secret stuff. I still\nremember Harry did another thing which was strictly illegal. He\nbutchered. Uh he butchered hogs. And we, and people who\nfarmedwere supposed to deliver all uh animals that were ready\nfor market, all produce to the Germans, which they then shipped\neast. They didn't give hardly anything to the people in the\nNetherlands, which is why there was such a famine there. But uh\nHarry in contravention of all the rules, slaughtered, and we did\nthat right on the kitchen floor. Uh can imagine a little Jewish\nboy... (laughter)...a scene like that. I had no real sense of\nwhere meat was coming from and to see then slit the throat of a\nhog and string it up from the ceiling and cut it up into pieces\nand make sausage out of the guts that was some experience. But\nuh it was something that the kids all watched with glee and uh I\nmade a real effort to to fit in. It was hard because you know I\nwas uh a city slicker from the north and they were country\nbumpkins from the south and they, they not only had a completely\ndifferent culture, they had a different language. They spoke\nDutch but it was such a different dialect that uh if they talked\namong themselves I couldn't understand a word they were saying.\nAnd I knew I was I was a native Dutchman. However fortunately\nthey learned standard Dutch in school so if they wanted to they\ncould include me. And of course in short order I learned the\ndialect and learned to watch such things as hog slaughter. And\nit was uh kind of a fun thing ina way because the one thing\nthat uh we kids would get out of it immediately was the bladder.\nAnd you will say, what do you do with a hog bladder. Well, what\nyou do is you you try to scrape and wash it clean the best you\ncan, and then you take an old tin can and you tie the top of the\nbladder to the tin can much as you would make a drum, with one\ndifference. You'd also take a stick and you would tie that to\nthe center of the bladder, centered over the drum, centered over\nthe over the tin can, and then you would tie it taught. Then\nyou would spit into your hands, , and then you would slide\nit up and down the stick and that was an instrument, an\ninstrument which everybody learned to hate. But uh for uh for\nuh, what what is this holiday called in English sometimes it's\nit's hard to translate on the spot uh it's it's a spring\nholiday just befo...just before the frost (ph) uh, help me,\nit's fat fat Monday in French. Mardi Gras. OK. Uh on Mardi\nGras we would go out and uh and serenade the neighbors which\nwith what we called the , and uh as much to get rid the\nawful noise as anything else, they would they would give little\nhandouts and then the kids would troop other places. Well, of\ncourse I couldn't do this during the occupation but I was there\na good while after and uh I remember doing that with the kids\nand of course I had the fun of of making my own . Well,\nwhat else did we do? Well the interesting part is that\nunschooled and unlettered as the Janssen's were, uh especially\nthe older girls got quite interested in all the literary\nactivity of the Ph.D.'s that uh were in hiding with them. Now\nthese Ph.D. uh parental generation of mine was was odd from from\nmy retrospective point of view. They were dressed like you and\nI are today, in three-piece suits and tie, on a farm in the\noutback where there was no pavement within miles. Where there\nwas mud all around, where they had to make fire in stoves with\nwet peat that filled the place with acrid smoke in every\nmorning. That was my dad's job and uh he was he was extremely\nallergic. He had uh he had a mild case of asthma and and lots\nof associated allergies and was the worst possible job but Heinz\nnever could learn how to light a fire, so that was my dad's job\nwhich he did in his three-piece suit and tie, every morning.\nThat went on first. Uh so that showed the kind of activity you\nasked activity uh it 1S amazing the p...these two Ph.D.'s had\ntheir literary material shipped in on on the underground. Uh my\nfather had a connection in Amsterdam. One of his students, a\nvery advanced student of art history, uh collaborated with him\nin the writing. He did uh the research work in the libraries uh\nwhich he which he would either copy or summarize and send send\ndown, and my dad would would write in his field. And uh he had\na portable typewriter, so big we still have it today a little\nHermes (ph), a baby Hermes that uh he picked up in Switzerland\nand it still works today. My mother uses it today and has used\nit all this time. Tremendous advertising I would think for that\nfirm. Well, in that outback place they had a typewriter. Uh\nHeinz who had different interests uh decided to do a history on\nthe life of Millieure (ph), the playwright because to the\nunderground he he got uh in contact with a group of monks across\nthe border in Belgium, in the southeast corner of the\nNetherlands, very close to Belgium uh who unbeknownst I guess to\nto the uh uh regular scholars had hoarded away the personal\npapers of Millieure which they smuggled to Heinz and which he\nmade a treatise out of. He finally wrote a play on the life of\nMillieure so that's what went on in that chicken house, as hard\nas it is to believe. Well, with all this literary activities\nthe kids came by to see and my father started uh teaching them\nuh how to do poetry and how to make drawings and we made skits.\nI remember one of the neighbors who knew most neighbors knew uh\nthat Harry was hiding refugees was having a fiftieth wedding\nanniversary and we made the most elaborate uh skit for them, uh\na whole production uh uh weaving together stories from from the\nfamilies that were going to be at this uh at this at the\nceremony, at the celebration. And I still have those today.\nVery good stuff. And uh so it it made a very nice uh contact\nbetween uh people who otherwise would have been semiliterate.\nUh there are members of the family who who didn't join in this.\n\u00abis you know barely literate even today. Uh their their\nletters take a genius like myself to decipher but uh we became\nvery good friends which is from what I hear a rather unusual\nstory because relations between people who were hiding and\npeople who were hiding them were not always the best. You can\nimagine what tremendous pressure that put on people and uh the\nJanssens did extremely well not only in successfully hiding the\nfive people in their charge for for uh two years and then taking\ncare of them afterwards, because afterwards we had no place to\ngo. We were in the part of the Netherlands that was liberated\nhalf a year befo...before the rest. We were fortunate in that\nrespect. So even while we lived in the war zone for a half a\nyear they continued to take care of us. In the beginning we had\nmoney to pay them, but I I find in going through the uh uh\ndocuments we have from this time that uh shortly after\nliberation we ran out of money, and food was even scarcer then\nif possible than before. Harry continued to feed us and uh Dad\nwrote him an 1.0.U. and I have the 1.0.U. that he crossed out uh\nbecause he decided to forgive the debt. So that was uh the kind\nof relationship we had with the people.",
        "Answer: Yeah. I personally had such a routine where there were\nat least two or three hours every morning that uh we had\nsubjects that I didn't particularly like and that I don't think\nmy dad was all that interested in either. He was a very\nliterary person. Math and and sciences were not his strong\npoints, so that's what we saved for the morning. But the fun\npart, the composition, the drawings, the language studies and\ndon't forget geography geography was the overriding interest\nbecause you know that's where our salvation was to come from in\na literary in the literal sense, so we we traced the Allied\ntroop movement over every inch of North Africa and through Italy\nand through France until they finally came through Belgium to\nliberate us, so I I you probably remember when uh the Allied\ntroops first landed in in uh western France they they came to\nNormandy and were stuck there, and I still know all the little\nhick town villages like in Normandy where these battles\nwere fought because uh they were all recreated in my atlas that\nI still have today.",
        "Answer: Well, I've mentioned the principle one. Uh we we uh,\nthe first one where we were the least prepared, Harry took us\nway back into the peat bog where he knew of an abandoned barn\nwhere we hid in hid in the attic. Uh after that as I told you he\nconstructed or had constructed this double wall. For a time\nthey they toyed with the idea of building an air raid shelter\nwith uh with a secret room in this, but even though the air raid\nshelter got partly built that that never came came up. One time\nthey tried digging a tunnel under a haystack for me. That was\nspecial for me because it couldn't be uh so big that other that\nother people bigger than a nineyear old that I was at the time\nwould fit in. You couldn't hide in the haystack because it\nbecame known pretty quick that when they did a raid they always\nran uh sabers and bayonets through haystacks. If they came up\nwith blood they knew they caught somebody. So, but under the\nhaystack was the variation that was the worst night I think I\never spent in hiding. That was awful, in the cold clammy dark\nplace under that haystack. Uh I complained very little, but\nthey never did that again because I I did complain and that was\nreally awful. Uh other times when there was little advanced\nnotice we would just hide in the ditches and plenty of ditches\nto hide in in the Netherlands and uh ina dry, in the drier\nseason that gives you quite a bit of cover and mobility cause if\nyou can get some sense of which way the raid 1S going you can\nconstantly keep cover and and keep on the move.",
        "Answer: Well, uh I am reconstructing that there must have been\nfour that actually reached the place and maybe three or four\nothers in the neighborhood which were just as bad from the\nstandpoint of getting everybody all excited because you never\nknew are they going to come to your farm or not, but uh there\nwas a Nazi sympathizer unfortunately that uh lived across the\nstreet. Again it's hard to say. You know, as I told you\nbefore, it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Uh\nmy hunch is uh that this fellow like like many people who who\nplayed with the Nazis was more interested in being important\nthan being disloyal and uh you know, an occupying force,\nespecially a loud and oppressive one, has a certain amount of\nattraction to it, and uh there was an element, there's a type of\nof a personality I think that gets attracted to this and wants\nto go over to them and and tell them something that they don't\nalready know, and get pat on the back and be told you're a great\ncitizen and great supporter of the new order. Uh and uh it is\npretty clear that uh that the that the neighbor across the\nstreet told on us which is breaking ranks with with all the rest\nof the people around who who did know. And uh after liberation\nHarry really confronted this guy according to what uh his wife\nNina (ph) told me later, until he had this guy on his knees in\nthe middle of the street begging for mercy. I mean there were\nthat kind of strong feelings about but uh that is how come there\nwere specific raids on our place. I mean there were there were\nreally actual fingers pointed at Harry and that he was able to\nkeep cool under those circumstances. One day he payed played\ncards to, in the first raid as a matter of fact, he carried off\nby playing cards. He and his friend Marinus (ph) who were who\nwas his closest friend and who was in the underground with him,\nuh had gotten notice that uh that we were going to be raided\nwith very little advanced notice. Took us out to this barn in\nthe outback like I told you, and then he and Marinus uh uh got\ntogether some drinks and uh spread the card, cards out you know\nmoments before the raiding party came. They they acted like\nthey had been playing and drinking all night, acting completely\nSurprised. What you guys looking here on a ona strange night\nlike this? Well, we were told to make a search. Search for\nwhat? Well, you know, that conversation went on like that till\nthey got them into the game where where these two excellent card\nplayers first took all their money. To keep interest in it,\nthey let them win some of it back, which you know ate up a whole\nlot of time, all the time saying oh there's always time to go\nlooking around the place, till they were so drunk and so tired\nthat uh they hardly did any looking around at all. And Harry\nkept the best uh the best drinks for occasions like this. So he\nhe played his way through a search which is probably also weird\nin the annals of uh secret operations.",
        "Answer: Yeah, well he he did some really nice and and\nSupportive things. Probably the most supportive thing that he\ndid to help us live through which which was a very difficult\nSituation I mean here we were in this chicken house, right, uh\nwith for for the most part uh no opportunity to go elsewhere.\nOne thing he did is he built a uh site barricade next to the\nchicken house out of out of some of sheathes of grain, kind of\na palisade and uh so we could walk you know short distance like\nmaybe ten feet back and forth outside or sit in the sun and be\nshielded from the road by that. But one thing that he did that\nI I think was particularly thoughtful and dangerous was to bring\nin a radio, a receiver. Now you must understand that nobody in\nthe Netherlands was allowed to have a radio. There were certain\npeople who with uh certain people that were deemed trustworthy\nby the Nazis who could get a permit for a special radio which\nwas constructed so that it could only get two stations, which\nwere the two approved stations that they felt people should\nlisten to. So to get a a regular radio that could listen to\nanything, shortwave radio, was impossible. But he got one\nanyway. And dangerous because one can trace radios without\nmaking house searches. You can trace apparently whether someone\n1s receiving air waves uh electronically. So it was uh a very\nrisky thing to do and uh when my father got over the shock of\nthis very special gift that Harry brought him, he he mentioned\nthat and he says well, how many times can they kill us already.\nSo this was the attitude that that he took and uh so my father\nreally made a business of of listening to the news of of the war\nand for a while we, he even put together a little underground\nnewspaper. His best source of information was in English but\nhis English wasn't really good enough to to follow uh news\nbroadcasts too well, so he found uh a German station that was\ngiving the uh the party line, the German version of how things\nwere going in the war, at dictation speed in English, because\napparently this was done as as as kind of a propaganda tool to\nEnglishspeaking peoples, to show them how the Nazis were really\nwinning the war, and so my father could listen to the English\nbroadcasts at dictation speed which was done so that people\ncould copy it down and and you know make little newspapers out\nof it and uh then would listen to the same broadcast at regular\nspeed, and then he would train his ear so that he could\nunderstand the terms that would be used in any kind of a of a\nbroadcast. Then he would listen to the news a third time from\nthe Allied side, get the true story and understand it. There\nwas no paper and my dad scribbled on on the back of old\nenvelopes, in the margins of of diaries, of of tear\u2019off uh uh\ncalendars and everything. I still have some of these pieces of\npaper very very small, hurried writing, where you could see how\nhe was following the news. But for a time they did manage to uh\nto put out a little newspaper till word got back to Harry that\nuh this was being noticed by the wrong people and we quit. But\nuh Dad still would uh feed information into to the underground\non the progress of the war and of course we all followed with\nwith great interest ourselves. And that radio stayed with us\nthroughout. I remember I I did I did some drawing as I told you,\nthat was one of the special subjects that my dad taught me. He\nhe was a pretty good cartoonist and uh one time he said what are\nyou drawing, and he said, and I said well I'm just drawing this\nwall of of things in the chicken house. He says but you're not\ngoing to put in the radio. I said well yeah I guess not. So\nhere I have this drawing where you can see the ground wire of\nthe radio which I had already drawn, and instead see see a clock\non the shelf where the radio was. It was kind of funny. A\ncensored drawing.",
        "Answer: Not on their farm. First I told you we were two\nrefugee families there. That was enough. If you're talking\nabout Jewish refugees, we were aware of one other Jewish refugee\nin the neighborhood although after liberation we heard of of\nmore. This waS was an interesting thing because we were, we\nheard that uh this man was a rabbi, and uh there was a short\nmessage passedback and forth where he found out that there was a\na nine year old kid there. And so he passed back a message\nSaying no, that he was not a rabbi. He was a rabbinical student\nand uh that he was quite interested in Jewish education and he\nwanted to now already be working on a text that could be used in\nthe postwar period for uh teaching Jewish kids and could he try\nhis manuscript out on a real live student. So my father was\ndelighted. His his background in Jewish history particularly in\nHebrew was not very strong, so we used uh these letters which\nwere addressed as letter to a young friend, ,\nwhich was really the manuscript of uh that rabbi was uh\nwas sending us and I still have some of those uh letters where\nhe was teaching me Hebrew and Jewish history and and uh and uh\nculture and customs long distance. So that was incorporated\ninto my regular lessons and uh Dr. Survived the war\nand became I think a very leading post uh Holocaust uh rabbi of\nthe Netherlands. Uh the liberal Jewish community really grew\nafter the war because uh most of the survivors had that kind of\na tendency and he led the liberal movement and actually the uh\nliberal Jewish synagogue in in uh in Amsterdam is built with the\nwhole Holocaust theme of, the theme of rising from the ashes,\nand uh that movement is the one that uh led after he\nfinished his rabbinical studies. So when I visited the\nNetherlands in the '60's I I got an appointment with the who had\nthen become great man, and he could give me exactly twelve\nminutes. He felt terrible, but but you know, I was on one of\nthose American tours where you did I exaggerate ten countries\nin six days, so it had to be that afternoon and he was just\ncompletely scheduled up. But I got to see him that one time.\nThe next time I went to the Netherlands, unfortunately he died\nrather young, but his son took over his his pulpit and they\nstill have Rabbi in Amsterdam.",
        "Answer: Well, I think that the underground movement in the area\nwhere we where we were at was the most enthusiastic about\nrescuing pilots. Uh pilots were regularly being shot out of the\nair because a good part of the war was was carried out on in the\nair. Uh the decisive battles really were in the air, not on the\nground and uh so one time generally these two various\nunderground operations were kept separate for obvious reasons\none time a pilot stayed with us overnight. And this was very\nexciting and of course the pilot was very pleased because he\nhadn't really been able to talk to anybody because all he knew\nwas English. And to find someone in the outback that spoke\nEnglish was to him a real find and you know, my father and he,\nthey talked all night about you know about his background and\nhis fears and he finally could get clued in as to what was\nhappening to him, cause he really didn't know who had taken\npossession of him and what they could do for him, so I remember\nmy father and and this man, an Englishman, talking all night\ntill the next morning when they came to get him, and they got\nhim out successfully. They, that was a pretty successful\noperation they smuggled them south into France and then into\nSpain and Portugal and it was a regular route for to ship downed\npilots back that way. And never or they did use if for Jews but\nnot with equal enthusiasm.",
        "Answer: No. Uh this this this was nothing that that a kid\ncould understand and I I know that Harry told us as little as\npossible of his operations because you know that that was\nSurvival. Even his wife who's still alive and whom I questioned\nabout this recently said that she didn't know and didn't want to\nknow all that he was in to.",
        "Answer: Well, I can tell you something that ties right in to\nthe day of liberation. One of the side elements of the air war\nwas an effort by the Allies to disturb the German\ncommunications, and for a time they would drop lots of uh little\nstrips of black paper with aluminum foil attached to them, which\nI guess uh disrupts radar and what happened I guess uh fly\nthrough a radar net that otherwise might detect planes that were\ncoming through, so we kids made a game of this. And we would go\nout in the fields and hunt all those strips of paper and use\nthem for art projects. I still have a calendar for example that\nthat where I made the backing out of out of those little bits of\npaper which we called silver paper. And the area in which we\nwere, atypical for the Netherlands, was solidly Catholic. [In\nfact that's probably why the people were successful in in hiding\nJews because of the solidarity among Catho...in a Catholic\nenclave in the midst of of a protestant country. And uh so we\nwould go through the fields and meadows singing \"Holy St.\nAnthony, dear friend, I hope that you will help me find a little\nslip of paper,\" in Dutch it rhymes. [Speaks in Dutch] And we\nwere hunting uh when the call came that uh that the\nliberators were finally there. You must picture a country\nwhich, countryside which had no paved roads whatsoever, didn't\nneed paved roads because nobody had a car. Only the doctor had\na motorcycle. And uh so all you had was these ruts through the\nthrough the sand and through the clay, and we had the worst\nweather in the fall of '44 that most people can remember. It\nrained and it rained in a country where it's already quite wet,\nso the the troops that were coming through there at the time, we\nlater heard that this was part of the operation Market Garden,\nwhere they were trying to make a quick dash up to the northern\npart of the Netherlands only it never worked uh only had one\nso-called hard road. We called it the hard road because it was\npaved through the whole neighborhood, and it was the only way in\nwhich armies could operate. And so uh I remember and the call\ncame up the uh the English they called everybody that spoke\nEnglish, English it didn't matter whether they were Americans\nor Scots or Canadians or Australians they were all English the\nEnglish are coming. So uh the cry went out for the kids to come\nback from the field so we all ran back to to hear what was\nhappening, so my father says uh the English are coming and uh\nthey are at the hard road. And uh I want to go and have a look\nat them. Do you want to come along? And I said to him, isn't\nthat dangerous. And he said yeah. Yeah, I guess it's\ndangerous. You don't have to go if you don't want to. So,\nwhile we know who who would pass up a challenge like this so we\ntrudged through the mud, and they had put tree trunks on the\npaths to so that people could uh at least not sink into the to\nthe deepest mud puddles. It was incredible how wet the\ncountryside was. I still remember balancing on falled tree\ntrunks to get to the hard road, and there they were a long\ncolumn of tanks, one right after the other. I think they were\nCanadians, the first ones that came through there. And uh so we\nJumped up on the tracks of of of the tanks and looked in to the\nturrets to to see who was inside and started conversation with\nthese people, but between fire fights. Uh the radio would\ncrackle and they'd say another barrage iS coming in. Everybody\ndown. Said lower the turrets. We would jump into fox holes\nwhich which the Nazis had considerably considerately dug beside\nthe road which were of course full of water. So we'd duck, duck\ninto the water till the next volley of shots went by, jump back\nout and talk talk to the soldiers some more till I still\nremember a large haystack just across that narrow little road\nwhere where I was sitting in the foxhole, uh burst into flames.\nThen I'd enough. I mean that burst into flames like you\ncouldn't believe it just \"poof\", just like that and uh so I I\nsaid to Dad right then and there, I've I've had enough and I\nmade my way back to the farm. I I don't know how long they\nstayed. But that was a very exciting time.",
        "Answer: Oh yes. I remember it very clearly. It was the 24th\nof September 1944. The reason I remember it so clearly is that\nwhen we started hearing over the radio that the uh uh liberation\nforces were coming closer and we were seeing more and more\nplanes coming over and so forth, Harry and my dad made a bet\nthat we would be liberated before my dad's birthday which was\nthe 28th of September. My father said I think they'll make it,\nand Harry says no way. He says they they can't get here that\nfast. And uh so my father won the bet by four days and I still\nhave the bill that Harry initialed to show that uh Dad\nwon the bet. And that has the date right on it.",
        "Answer: Well, the the German forces counterattacked as as you\nknow from having read the story of Market Garden, and pinned the\nliberation forces down, I would say exactly at our farm. I\nstill remember hearing that that one night the Germans had had\nretaken and occupied the farm right next to ours. So it was\nthat close. So we were literally in the front line and the\ncompany of soldiers that was the nearest to us physically were\nScotch, Scottish soldiers and uh they didn't like you to call\nthem Scotch. They wanted to be called Scots. Uh and uh they\nmade kind of a mascot out of me. They had very little contact\nwith the rest of the population because no one spoke English but\nto find a little urchin that's that's uh spoke English and\nwanted contact with them was a real turnon to these soldiers.\nAnd they really spoiled me. I mean they they fed me their\ncandies and they gave me their tea. They brewed tea in uh\nfireplaces made out of barrels. They would set up a barrel,\nfill it full of sand, pour gasoline into this end, and then get\na big other kind of a barrel or kettle and put it on top of top\nthere and cook tea in huge quantities and right in the middle of\nbattle they would always have their tea. The Scotch just the\nsame, the Scottish just like the English. And uh they burned\ndown many a farmstead with their bonfires, which were all done\nin the name of tea. That's what we had the most of tea and\napples. And and that fall the apple trees which were which were\nall around had a had a fantastic year and the, you know Dutchmen\nare are kind of taciturn you have a hard time expressing their\nemotions so what everybody did was whenever you saw a uh\nsoldier you gave him an apple. And that's what people did. And\nI still can hear today my mother and father kind of shaking\ntheir heads and muttering when they saw apples with one bite\ntaken out of them along side the road when everybody was\nstarving. Uh but uh they fed me their their candy and their tea\nand and their fresh baked bread which they had shipped in from\nParis. Strange things armies do. And uh uh it got to the point\nuh where I was firing their cannon and when my dad heard that uh\nI had been detonating cannon he put put a stop to my hanging\naround with these troops day and night. But I had made one,\nfriends with one man in particular. His name was Charlie\nFrazier (ph) from Aberdeen and uh Charlie followed me home and\nmade friends with my parents and uh just loved to be with a with\na family. I mean he was he was one of the few soldiers that was\na family man. He had two kids of his own, and uh he just\ncouldn't get away from his camp often enough to be with us, so\nhe he spent long periods of time with us, Charlie did, and tell\nus stories about his family back home to help him feel better.\nAnything we wanted he'd give. Well I remember one time I asked\nhim for an ammunition box. Now remember our communications\nweren't that perfect. When I said I spoke English you might as\nwell say I spoke pigeon, so uh I asked him for an ammunition box\nwhich I wanted for a lunch box. So uh he said fine, he would he\nwould get me one of those. One evening we could uh, he he\ntrudged in it was raining as it usually was he he tracked in\nthrough the mud, the mile or so from his little encampment, and\nuh he said to us, I've I've got your box. And you know, they\ndon't speak normal English in Scotland either he had a very\nstrong Scotch accent finally we understood what he was saying,\nbut we said to him, what do you mean you've got our box. Where\nit is? Well he said I left it outside. And why'd you leave it\noutside? Well he says it's heavy, it's big. The poor man had\nbrought in one of those great big boxes that you put shells in\nnot where you put those not where you put little bullets in. He\nthought that's what we wanted. Well we we still have that box\nthat he brought us at at such great cost. It it sealed pretty\ngood against uh against the damp and my mother kept clothes in\nit for many years. In fact she just moved a couple of years ago\nand she finally took her winter clothes out of that uh out of\nthe box and said to me, you uh you uh do something with it. And\nI said fine. Well we'll give it to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, and that's probably where it will be.",
        "Answer: Bad and and getting worse. Because the food situation\nreally was bad and the strain and stress was really telling on\nthe people. I mean I'm reconstructing this afterwards. Uh in\nthe spring of '45 I was really sick and uh that was the time\nthat the northern part of the Netherlands was just starting to\nbe liberated. It wasn't near as dramatic as our liberation\nbecause uh the Nazis just faded away at a certain point because\ntheir supply lines to the east uh had been broken and militarily\nthe northern part of the Netherlands was never forcefully taken.\nBut the famine there was worse than it was in the south. It was\nbad enough with us but at least we had we had scraps of food.\nUh in the north they had nothing. So my father got together as\nbig a package of food as he thought he could manage and uh\nstarted to make his way north because he knew his friends in in\nAmsterdam were starving. And uh the time that he said goodbye\nand going back to Amsterdam was the last time I saw him, cause\nhe took sick on on the road and died. I never saw him again.\nWell I got sick at the same time and uh I was put in the\nhospital and uh never heard that my dad had died. They didn't\ntell me. They were still shielding me. For months they didn't\ntell me that he had died and they kept making up stories as to\nwhere he might be and I guess that's why I have a tough time\nbelieving people even today because people just weren't straight\nwith me. Well, they figured he's a poor sick kid why bother him\nwith the story that his father died and then finally they were\ncaught in their own stories, so you know then no one made up\nmakeup stories and I just had to find out on my own that my dad\nwas dead, which was a very hard thing for me to live down and of\ncourse it was hard on my mother. No need to compare who it was\nharder for, but she depended a lot on him. She, he was her\nwhole life, our lifeline to the world. She remained a real\nGerman house and whatever my dad said, went. So she made\nvery few decisions and was very dependent on my dad. So to have\nhim die at a at a critical time like this when everything was in\nthe shambles was very hard on my mother. Uh the Graumanns uh\ntried to go back to Amsterdam. When uh Mrs. Graumann, Elli,\ncame back to her old surroundings, it hit her even harder what\nhad happened to her son, and couldn't deal with the grief, so\nshe committed suicide. I didn't know about it that at the time\neither. I I heard that afterwards too. So really out of the six\npeople that that started out on the run together in August of\n\"42, uh out of the six people only three survived. And none of\nthe losses was due to Harry. My dad died after liberation. Mrs.\nGraumann of course a few months later, and Michael before we got\nto Harry. So Harry has a perfect record. But uh the survivors,\nthere's there's only half of us. Dr. Graumann uh remarried and\nsettled in uh Topeka, Kansas, where he still lives. He is in\nhis 90's so he's a real survivor. My mother still lives. She\nis uh 85 years old and still goes to work every day here in uh\nthe Washington area. Uh the survivors are are tough people.",
        "Answer: Well, it was raging right on our doorstep. In fact it\ngot so bad that uh they evacuated by they I mean the Allied\ncommander evacuated the people in in our pocket of the\ncountryside and they took over the farm and and made a\ncommunications center out of it. Uh Harry didn't like this at\nall because in these unsettled times he was afraid that people\nwould steal whatever little he had left, but uh reluctantly he\nuh evacuated the family to a cousin of of his wife's. His name\nwas Vilam Yosten (ph), who all of a sudden got uh a couple of\ndozen people on his doorstep because uh as I was saying several\nof Harry's relatives had had been not really hiding but living\nwith us uh more or less openly uh to escape the famine, so uh it\nwas amazing that this Vilam Yosten with with hardly any notice\ntook on this whole troop of people. And we lived everywhere. I\nremember uh by we I mean all 24 or 25, 26 of us. Uh my family,\nmy mom, dad and I lived in an old pigsty. Uh again an\ninteresting experience for a Jewish family. Uh my father was\njust millimeters short of six feet tall and he had the hardest\ntime fitting into this pigsty but as I say it rained steadily\nthrough that time, so we had to be somewhere inside, so we\nstayed in the pigsty and my dad squeezed himself into it the\nbest he could and uh continued with his usual pursuits. He\nalways had a little notebook of some kind and I still can\npicture him sitting there and on some straw that we had put on\nthe ground, making notes to himself and I uh dragged in one of\nmy best finds uh a soldier who had gotten so excited at finding\naa little urchin that spoke English and turned out to be a\nJewish urchin, that he had come, had to absolutely come and see\nthe rest of the family. The soldier was literally delirious.\nHis name was Godfrey Langdon (ph), also an older soldier who was\nfighting a very personal war. He was Jewish and we were the\nfirst actual honest-to-God Jewish people that he had come across\nin the territories that he liberated. And I later heard that he\nhad been through all the African campaigns and the French\nCampaign and the Belgium Campaign, but I guess they were so busy\nfighting they never met any people. Or never liberated any\npeople identifiable as Jews. This man absolutely opened up\nhimself to us. He gave us everything he had and there were no\nlimits. Uh anything that you mentioned he'd do. Although the\none thing that we were the most scared to ask, because we had\nbeen told repeatedly not to ask, which is to use their\ncommunications network. And as I told you the countryside was\nin a Shambles and my parents' relatives uh had and we knew they\nhad escaped to the United States and and Britain. And we wanted\nin the worst way to find out how they were and to let them know\nthat we had survived...\nEND OF TAPE\n...which was rather worthy. They could only have supposed that\nwe had not. And uh well he was in the signal corps and uh we\ntook a chance. Uh we all took a chance, and he decided to adopt\nus as his relatives and write letters to his uh then newly\nacquired aunts and uncles telling telling them that his other\nrelatives had had survived the war. And got away with it. And\neven in the midst of a battle zone we received uh letters from\nour relatives through military mail, even when he when his unit\nmoved on, he would sometimes trudge through the whole night just\nto deliver us letters and maybe a little and get back\nto his unit. Even when he couldn't get leave he would do that\ninstead of sleep. So this is how strongly some people felt and\nGodfrey Langdon stayed a friend till the day he died. I still\nhave uh prayer books that he gave the family, so that we would\nhave something something Jewish.",
        "Answer: About the Yosten farm. Well the Yosten's were were\nalso an amazingly hospitable people and they are still friends\nof ours to this day. Their farm if possible is even further\noutback than the Janssen farm, in that it 1S more remote\nalthough it was then and still is a lot more modern and uh I I\nreally enjoyed farming with these people because uh because they\nthey had scale to their to their outfit and they taught me how\nto milk and uh I helped them bring in the harvest. Uh I really\nI really did well in those days because I was just like a bird\nlet out of a cage. I had to try everything and people responded\nto that. I still remember, you know everybody made a pet out of\nme. Uh the older Yosten daughters took me and as I said taught\nme how to milk and how to farm and I guess this is one reason\nthat I went into agriculture. I'm a paper farmer. I I shuffle\npapers for the U.S. Department of Agriculture but I have a life\nlong interest in farming.",
        "Answer: Well, we've touched on that some. My my mother finally\nuh after she buried my dad, made her way to Amsterdam, while I\nwas in in under quarantine in the hospital in , which was\nreally bad for me because I had I had been penned up long enough\nand you know here I had just been let free and loose and then\nthey put me ina glass cage literally, and medical facilities at\nthat time were extremely primitive still and they were afraid\nthey had an epidemic on their hands. So uh they put me in\nQuarantine and and fed me through a slot. And I was well by that\npoint when they when they started feeding me through the slot.\nI was well. They pushed books and food through there and for\nthe rest they would just shout through the walls and that was\nthe only contact I had with the outside world. A terrible time\nI had but uh Mrs. Graumann who really felt miserable most of the\ntime rose to this occasion and she stuck around that hospital\nday and night to make sure I got taken care of while she was\nobviously also gripped by the fact that my mother had had to go\nbury her husband. Must have been a difficult position for my\nmother whether to go and go to my father's funeral and abandon\nher sick child or have the funeral occur without her and stay\nwith the child. Well, she decided to go to the to the funeral.\nThat in itself was was an amazing thing because my dad died\namong strangers. The only Jewish family in that little town uh\nthat had come back took him in, and that also became a life-long\nfriendship because uh shortly after they took him in, while he\nwaS waiting for the necessary travel papers to make the best of\nhis trip north, he got si...he got very sick and died ina\nperiod of days, and here they had the body of this stranger on\ntheir hands whom they really didn't know much about except some\nrough idea where the rest of his family was. Well, the managed\nto find another returning uh Jewish person who had who had\nsurvived the camps, and uh that uh that person found the car and\ndriver somewhere. How they managed that I don't know but they\nfound their way through the rain, through the dark, to the\nimpossible-to-find outback place where my mother was, and in the\namazing short period of time of two days, and said you know, if\nyou want to be at your husband's funeral, now is the time and\nthey had to break the news to her. Well they took her back in\nthe car. Managed to scrounge up enough gasoline and managed to\nbury my father within the ritual maximum length of time that you\ncan keep a body out. I think it's three days. And uh they were\nvery orthodox and didn't know how how we were oriented so they\nprepared everything for an orthodox funeral. In the midst of of\na famine in the war zone, they were extremely kind to strangers.\nAfter all these people had seen so much death that they were\nable to find the compassion to deal with one more death. It's\namazing. But they did. They were super compassionate to my\nmother and she still can't get over today what hospitality and\nwhat uh what support she found in which obviously were complete\nstrangers. But she made her way back to Amsterdam, and joined\nup with uh her friends who had maintained contact\nmore or less throughout the whole hiding period. In the\nparlance of the times they were called our periscope. We were\nthe submerged people, the underdikers (ph), the people in\nhiding, and the the imagery that was used, ima...imagery that\nwas used was of a submarine so the people who knew where you\nwere were your periscope. So she went to the periscope family\nwho took her and then later when I came out of the hospital, me\nin also. They had a relatively small apartment but they made\nroom for us. In fact I had my own room. They emptied out an\nattic room which I converted into my own little space and they\nhad uh an apartment on the very last city canal in Amsterdam, so\nI could look out over the countryside and it was a good, quiet\nplace for me to try to get my myself together.",
        "Answer: Well, as I indicated, my relatives on both sides of the\nfamily had uh in the last years when it was possible immigrated\nout of continental Europe. My father's family had gone to\nLondon and we visit them, visited them within the first say\ntwelve months of the time that we got back to Amsterdam. But my\nmother really wanted to go to her side of the family, which was\nuh in America. I didn't want to go but once again people paid\nno attention to me whatsoever, to what I wanted. I just was\nglad to get back to my old neighborhood and try to make contact\nwith my old friends which wasn't easy because I hadn't seen them\nfor three, more than three years and for a kid that's a good\nchunk of his life. And uh it was very hard to make contact back\nwith people whose lives had gone on while mine had stood still.\nAnd I was just starting to do that when my mom says we're\npacking up. We're going to the United States. This to me was\nbad news cause I had seen just enough wild west and gangster\nmovies that I figured that's what the United States was\ninhabited by and I didn't want to live with the likes of Al\nCapone and Wild Bill Hickcock and uh so I I didn't uh like that\nat all. Uh they they told us in various letters that that\nwasn't really so. That there were really civilized places in\nthe United States like New York and Cleveland, Ohio, where there\nwere no gangsters, at least not that you could see them ona\nregular basis and uh no Indians whatsoever. And that people did\nsuch things as uh parents went to work and kids went to school\nand in their spare time make money selling newspapers. Well,\nselling newspapers. That really did it because only the poorest\nof the very poor outcasts in western Europe of the time sold\nnewspapers and to be told that I would be making money on the\nside selling newspapers was was like bad news and I wasn't at\nall interested in going there and I didn't want to have anything\nto do with going to the United States. But my mother didn't\nhave much of a choice. She was completely out of money and\nassets. She was out of energy. She was out of everything and\nshe needed all the support that she could get from her family,\nso probably from her point of view she did wisely and and just\nmoved to the United States, where we were received also very,\nwith with open arms by our relatives. We lived with my mother's\nSister and her family, her husband and son, for al...almost two\nyears in avery cramped apartment because remember they were\njust getting over being refugees themselves. My uncle migrated\nto the United States when he was in his sixties so he wasn't\nvery employable, so he didn't make very much money and uh my\naunt was making money doing sewing work on a piece, on a piece\nby piece basis. They call it piece work. So they weren't very\nwell off. They lived in an apartment which was small already\nfor them and then they had to take in two more people. In two\nyears I never heard one unkind word. Like they must have gotten\nmad at me plenty of times cause I told you I was an urchin. I\nwasn't an easy kid to deal with. But they dealt with me\npatiently and lovingly and helped civilize me.",
        "Answer: The beginning was very hard. Uh there were there were\nor if they were they weren't Jews, but we experienced no social\nservice support at all. It was like there was no Jewish\ncommunity in Cleveland from for all they did for the refugees\nthat came in, from my personal experience. My personal\nexperience with the with the Jewish social service agencies was\nawful. To the extent that they tried to help us they made\nthings worse. Uh they welshed on every agreement that they ever\nmade. Never came through with anything that we expected and we\nwe didn't have anything further to do with them. So what\nhappened is I was just dropped into a regular school, and what\nEnglish that I knew was pigeon English and English English as we\ncalled it then, the American lingo was completely undecipherable\nto me. If people talked to me face to face like you're doing\nwith me right now I could understand them fairly well. I could\nask questions if I didn't. In the class I couldn't understand\nanything. In fact frequently the only thing I understood all\nday long was the questions they asked me on the materials that\nthey had just covered. Questions directed personally at me I\ncould understand easier than lectures. I just couldn't\nunderstand, and it was I was totally frustrated and the adults\nwere totally preoccupied making a living and I was the only\nlittle kid because as I said my uncle had his son living with\nhim but he was a grown son. He had just come back from the war.\nHe had his own problems. He had he had uh fought with the\nAmerican Armies and was just trying to re-stabilize his life, so\nhe didn't have time with me so here I was again, thrown\ncompletely on my own resources without anybody to talk to or\nanybody to help me over this very difficult adjustment to a toa\nsociety and the customs and a culture I knew nothing about. Uh\nI went to high school. Uh my second year uh I started I started\nin the ninth grade which was then in junior high school, but\nmost of my experience was in high school and especially in high\nschool the kids just cut me cold. They were nouveau riche uh\nAmerican Jewish kids and they didn't want to have anything to do\nwith uh with refugees. And uh the only way in which I made\ncontact was through a drama club and since all of usS were acting\nthen and since I was acting all the time anyway I could fit in\nthere. And that's how I got to know some kids my own age and\nand started making friends, so the drama club was my salvation.\nI was never a very good actor in the sense of being a thespian\nbut I was a very enthusiastic member of the of the drama club,\nand thespian iS a good word to use because the honor society in\nthat community was called the Thespian Society, and the day that\nthey made me a Thespian I knew that I had arrived in some area\nthat I really wanted to be in. After that uh I kind of drifted\ninto college and then drifted into Israel, thinking that maybe\nthat's where I'd like to be, but I didn't feel comfortable there\neither and besides the U.S. government was sending me\nthreatening letters that if I didn't come back they would call\nme a draft dodger because at that time everybody had to go into\nthe into the Army, so I came back and I was promptly drafted\ninto the Army, and uh after that I went to graduate school and\nStarted working for agricultural companies doing writing, public\nrelations, information type work which I am still doing this\nday. My mother benefitted from the fact that she had been\neverything for my dad in the time that he operated his own\nbusiness and gave all those lectures and talks and\npresentations. She absorbed enough art history so that uh even\nthough she had no formal education at all she was raised to be\nuh a lady. She was raised to be a hostess and an entertainer\nand a manager of servants, not to live in a poor neighborhood in\nthe United States. But uh this way she was able to get the job\nin the library in an art museum and that's the kind of work she\nstill does today.",
