This is side A of tape number one. Okay, Mrs. Green, will you please tell me\nyour name as it was at birth and your date of birth and the place where you were born?",
        "Answer: My name is, was, Sylvia Farber. I was born in Karlsruhe am Rhine, April 14,\n1924.",
        "Q: And Karlsruhe am Rhine was in Germany?",
        "A: In Baden, yeah.",
        "Q: And will you tell me something your parents and let\u2019s start with your father,\u2019 what was\nhis family background?",
        "A: He was one of seven children and they were married in 1919, they were married in\nPoland and then they moved to Germany right away, and they lived in Stuttgart and my\nbrother\u201d was born in 1920 in Stuttgart. And I don\u2019t know when they moved to Karlsruhe, I\nwas born in Karlsruhe in \u201824, so between \u201820 and \u201824 they moved, I don\u2019t know the exact\ndate.",
        "Q: And your father\u2019s, your father\u2019s family, were they middle-class, or?",
        "A: Yeah, my dad\u2019s, what I have been told, I didn\u2019t know too many of them except the ones\n' Josef Farber, born Feb. 14, 1888\n* Bernhard Farber (Bernard Farber)\nSylvia Green 3\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 3\nwhom were living in Germany, some stayed in Poland. He was the baby and when my dad\nwas born, his oldest brother already had children the age of my father and they were in the\nUnited States. And some of them moved to Karlsruhe, some of them, his sister lived in\nNuremberg and she would come and visit. And they had a dairy store, dairy, eggs and butter\nand my dad, that was my dad\u2019s job in Karlsruhe. It was lucky, my mother always said I was\nthe lucky child because the day I was born my dad got that job. He was the manager of the\ndairy department in a wholesale grocery store, and he had this job until he was deported to\nPoland in 1938. And on the same day my brother came home with a horse shoe and that\u2019s\nsupposed to be luck also.",
        "Q: So your father was born where?",
        "A: In Dukla, in Poland, and I\u2019ve never been there, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And he moved to Germany in?",
        "A: Well, in 1919 when they married.",
        "Q: Did they marry before they had come to Germany?",
        "A: Yeah, 1919, they married in Chrzanow where my mother was from and I think it was a\nmatch, probably, arranged.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s family background?",
        "A: They were very poor, there were ten children and my grandfather had a tailor shop,\nSylvia Green 4\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 4\ntailoring shop, and there hardly was any food on the table and my mother\u2019 was the second\noldest girl, the first one was a boy. So my mother had to raise all the younger children so\nshe never had a childhood. She said she never played with children. They had a cradle\nmade out of wood and she would look out the window and children were on the sidewalk\nplaying hopscotch and she participated then, she was in an apartment upstairs and many\ntimes the cradle was turned upside down because she got so excited, but she never had\ntime to really play with children, raising the rest of the family. My grandfather, I only\nsaw him once or twice in my life. To me, he was a big man with a long beard, Orthodox,\nand my mother said that he never held any of the children on his lap, but the\ngrandchildren he did. That one time we went to visit, I was on his lap and I braided his\nbeard and my mother just stood there, she didn\u2019t believe that he let me do that.",
        "Q: Was your family very religious?",
        "A: Yeah, they were Orthodox, but modern Orthodox. My dad was clean-shaven and my\nmother did not wear a wig, they were modern Orthodox, but very observing, Sabbath and all\nthe holidays. When my dad worked, well the name was Pfankuch, he never had a vacation\nall his life because he didn\u2019t work on any Jewish holidays and we got a lot of holidays, so\nthis was taken off as vacation. So my mother used to take us places or, also, we children,\nobvious, every summer you had to get out of the city, like otherwise you would die it seems\nlike. The New Yorkers do that too, don\u2019t they?\n* Cerka (Cilly) Posner Farber, born Oct. 20, 1887\nSylvia Green 5\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 5",
        "Q: Mmm-hmm.",
        "A: And, well, it was camps we used to go to and also I was very athletic and on weekends\nwe used to train and then I also belonged to the Mizrachi, which is a orthodox Zionist\norganization. And I think I was about five or six when I joined, and we had camps for about\ntwo weeks and then we had conclaves.",
        "Q: And you had one sibling, is that right?",
        "A: Two, my brother who is four years older and myself. My mother always said she only\nwanted two children, she raised such a large family before that that\u2019s all she wanted and\nthat\u2019s all she had was two children.",
        "Q: When was your brother born?",
        "A: June, wait a minute, June the 2nd because my son was born June the 4th, June 2, 1920,\nhe was born in Stuttgart.",
        "Q: Were you close with him?",
        "A: As children we were close in a way, but boys were raised entirely different than girls. A\ngirl just had to smile and look pretty, that\u2019s all that mattered, and my brother had to be\neducated, so he didn\u2019t have a childhood. My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, is that all right\nthe way I\u2019m holding that now? My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, my mother wanted him to\nbe a college professor, so he was educated for both. So I was schooled, we had school, you\nwent to school from eight till 12 and you went back in the afternoon from two till four, or\nfrom eight till one and three till five. Whenever he got out of school, he had to go to Hebrew\nSylvia Green 6\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 6\nschool, every day. So he didn\u2019t have much of a childhood either. And it was really\ninteresting, after we met again after the war, he was married and I was married and so we\ntalked about our parents and about our childhood, and the interesting part was the way I\ntalked about our parents was not the same way he talked about his parents, which were our\nparents, you know. So he told me, he said, \u201cI was so jealous of you.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cI was so jealous of you, you were so brilliant.\u201d And he said, \u201cI had to be. I had to\nstudy all the time, I had no childhood and you had friends.\u201d He didn\u2019t have any friends.\n\u201cYou always had friends, you always were playing or going places, doing things.\u201d And it\nwas really interesting, we were jealous of each other. But it worked out well, I mean we got\nit out of our system and we didn\u2019t carry any grudges.",
        "Q: So your parents didn\u2019t, weren\u2019t particularly interested in your education?",
        "A: I was not a dumbbell, I didn\u2019t have to work very hard and I brought home A\u2019s and B\u2019s,\nwithout any sweat. And he had to bring home A\u2019s, B\u2019s were not good enough. And, well,\nthat\u2019s what I said, all you had to do was smile and you had to associate with the people they\napproved of. And you couldn\u2019t go with children they didn\u2019t approve\u2014especially my\nmother. My dad was a hard-working man.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you had a lot of friends?",
        "A: Yes, I always had a lot of friends.",
        "Q: Were they friends from school, or from?",
        "A: Well, at the beginning I had Gentile friends, but then when Hitler came to power, they\nSylvia Green 7\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 7\ngot sparse, less and less friends. And it\u2019s really interesting you asking that, I still remember\nFritz Oler, we were raised together and I loved Fritz as much as I liked my brother, loved my\nbrother Bernard. And then when Hitler came to power, he disappeared. If we passed on the\nstreet, he wouldn\u2019t see me. If I passed on the street when it was dark, at that time we used to\ngo out in the evening, at the beginning, later on we didn\u2019t go out too much in the evenings,\nhe would look, stare at you like no recognition, but then he would take his hand and wave at\nyou in the back, so he wouldn\u2019t been seen. So but that really hurt, because in a way I knew\nthat the reason for it because I was a Jew, but it\u2019s very hard for children to accept. You, you\ntake it personally. Because I would cry, I came home and I saw some of the girls I used to\nplay with and they run away. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she like me any more? I haven\u2019t done anything\nto her.\u201d That\u2019s hard. And they probably went home and talked to their parents, also, how\nbad they felt, you know.",
        "Q: Do you remember, were those the first incidents that made you realize that you were\nsomehow different than these other children?",
        "A: When we were kicked out of school.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: I think it was the beginning of the fifth grade because I was supposed to have gone to the\ngymnasium also, like my brother did, but there were articles in the paper that they building a\nnew school for handicapped children in Frankfurt am Main and this was a very dilapidated\nschool, I mean nowadays it\u2019d be condemned, and that\u2019s the school they gave us.\nSylvia Green 8\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 8",
        "Q: What year would that have been?",
        "A: Let me just think, I was born in \u201824, I started school in \u201830, it might have been \u201835, oh,\nthe dates are getting dimmer, they really are. I mean, what happened you remember, but to\nremember the exact date, because I started at such a young age and so many things happened\nuntil \u201845, and nothing was good really. So, but what they didn\u2019t know, we got a much better\neducation than we did in public school because they wouldn\u2019t let Jewish college professors\nteach, so we got the college professors to teach us. So we benefited from it, we really did.",
        "Q: How far did you have to travel to go to school every day?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have to travel, 1t was within walking distance, in the radius of so many miles, they\nhad a school close by and we weren\u2019t bussed at that time.",
        "Q: Was your family afraid when Hitler came to power?",
        "A: Well, I saw Hitler many times, I was a nosy child and whenever he came, I would not go\ndown to see him in my neighborhood because everybody knew I was a Jew, I would go\nblocks and blocks out of my way and, where they didn\u2019t know me, and I was standing in the\nfront row, I was just fascinated by him, it was just like he hypnotized people. You know, I\nusually talk with my hands! It\u2019s hard. I\u2019m sorry. Well, I would always be in the front row,\nmany blocks away from where I lived, and I was there in the front row with everybody\neverybody else, and everybody yelling, \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d Here, he always came in a convertible\nand, naturally, he would hold his hand on the belt, I can close my eyes and see him, \u201cHeil\nHitler, Heil Hitler,\u201d and people just went crazy screaming, you know. And they all were\nSylvia Green 9\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 9\nrunning and I was right there with them. And he wouldn\u2019t let them get too close and then he\njust would take his hands, slowly, and everybody would go back. It\u2019s just like you were\nhypnotized, you know? So this was \u201833, but really, \u201832, already it started. There were\nCommunist parties, Nazi parties, Socialist parties, and they always scheduled marches about\nthe same time and there always, somehow there was a shooting going on, and they yelling\nand they used to hit each other. And my mother always used to grab my hand and, \u201cLet\u2019s go\nupstairs, let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d \u201cNo, I want to see what goes on!\u201d In \u201832, you know, I was eight\nyears old, I was nosy.",
        "Q: What did you think when you were watching these, these speeches and Hitler?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t, I just was fascinated by that whole thing, it was just like\neverybody was hypnotized. And his speeches weren\u2019t, he didn\u2019t say anything, he said three,\nfour words, and then yell, everybody yelled, \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler.\u201d I don\u2019t know, as a\nchild, the one thing I remember, he\u2019s... always when he came to Karlsruhe, it was a pretty\ngood sized town at that time, the size of Louisville, he would stay in the Hotel Germania,\nand every time I passed that hotel, I was going to stay there someday.",
        "Q: So you admired him a little bit?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, you kind of fascinated until, you know, then I didn\u2019t admire him anymore.\nI mean, what came afterwards, my mother always said, \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worse. It can\u2019t get\nany worse.\u201d Like when they deported my dad to Poland in \u201838.",
        "Q: Would you tell me a little more about that?\nSylvia Green 10\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 10",
        "A: One night we were home, Mother wasn\u2019t feeling well and she already was in bed, and\nthe doorbell rang, they always were very noisy and always yelling and always rushing, and\nthey always rushed, you know, and they were yelling, \u201cOpen that door! Open that door!\u201d\nAnd they kicked the door. So my dad went to the door and they came in and they said,\n\u201cEmpty your pockets.\u201d And my dad said, \u201cWhy? I haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d He was at work\nthat day, he came home from work. \u201cWell, just empty your pockets. And you do as we tell\nyou and the sooner you do it, the sooner you'll be home.\u201d And they took my dad away, they\npocket all his belongings and his favorite watch, I don\u2019t remember who gave him that watch,\nit was a gold watch, it was a pocket watch, that was the style at that time.",
        "Q: Where you there?",
        "A: Yes, I was there, I was there.",
        "Q: And your mother?",
        "A: My mother was there and that night my father came home from Wurzburg, it was a\nteacher\u2019s college,\u201d and we had a whistle, and I don\u2019t remember it now, that when we\nwhistled downstairs we knew it was one or the other. I mean, my parents knew, my mother\nknew, middle in the night we heard that whistle, and it was my brother came home, that was\nin \u201838. So after they deported my dad to the Polish border, they had some kind of agreement\nthat if any Jew in Germany was not in Poland for the last ten years, that they are going to\n* Sylvia\u2019s brother Bernard was attending college in Wiirzburg. It was he who returned\nhome, not her father.\nSylvia Green 11\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 11\nmake them staatenlos\u2019, that you didn\u2019t belong anywheres, you had no country. And\nGermany did not want to get stuck... your back hurts? It\u2019s okay. Germany did not want to\nget stuck with the people without a country, so that\u2019s why they pushed them to the border\nand the Polacks were shooting and the Germans were shooting and somehow they came to\nan agreement. Now, I was not there, this was told to me afterwards by my dad that, then\nthey finally let them there, let them in. So then after \u00b038, this was October, 1n November\nthey had Crystal Night.",
        "Q: Before we talk about Crystal Night, could you just tell me a little bit about how your\nmother and you and your brother dealt with the, the absence of your father immediately after\nhe was deported. How did you find out where he had gone and...",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t remember that...",
        "Q: ...did you expect him to come back?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t expect him to come back, because they called a meeting to all the wives of\nPolish citizens and my mother was sick in bed, I think this was sometime in \u201839, that was\nalready after Crystal Night, and we were told to be at the police station, that there is gonna be\na meeting and we have to be there, if we not gonna be there, then they were gonna arrest us.\nSo my mother was sick and she sent me. So I went there and when they called my mother\u2019s\nname, I stood up and apologized that my mother couldn\u2019t be here, but I\u2019m here and I will\ngive her the message, whatever the meeting is about. He yelled at me to come forward, he\n> Stateless (German)\nSylvia Green 12\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 12\nyelled so hard and I was a child, you know I was 15 years old and we were children at 15,\nnot, not the children, 15 seemed like they\u2019re very grown up, but we were not, we were\nchildren. I was shaking from head to toe, he gave me a pencil to sign my mother\u2019s name,\nthat we had to leave Germany by August \u201839, or we were gonna be arrested. Well, I couldn\u2019t\nhold the pencil, my hand was just shaking, so he took his gun out and put it to my temple.\nAnd I really don\u2019t remember whether I signed the name or I put the X mark\u2014he was\nsatisfied, so maybe I signed the name, I don\u2019t remember what I did, he seemed to be\nsatisfied. And we left, we left in August of \u00b039, the beginning of August and they followed\nus, September, beginning of September, the Second World War started. That\u2019s when they\ncame, invaded Poland.",
        "Q: So after your father was deported...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: ...you, you weren\u2019t really sure where he had gone?",
        "A: Yes, we knew that he, he, that they had deported him to Poland. And my mother had a\nsister in Krakow and we were pretty sure that\u2019s where he was headed.",
        "Q: And what happened in those months before that, before you left when you weren\u2019t with\nyour father? Did you have any word, or what did you and your mother. . .",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember how my mother found out, I couldn\u2019t tell you that, there was so much\ngoing on with me, also. Like, the Jewish Welfare Office was trying to get one child out of\nevery Jewish family and I was designated to go to England, they found foster homes. And,\nSylvia Green 13\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 13\nbut then, they were gonna round up the young men and my mother made me go to the Jewish\nWelfare Office and she told me to really make a scene and cry that I don\u2019t want to go to\nEngland, I want to go with my mother and, evidently, they bought it and I really was scared,\nyou know, I was crying, I was scared. Also, so, then they sent my brother instead.",
        "Q: Is that what your mother wanted?",
        "A: That\u2019s what my mother wanted. Because they were not, they were not doing anything to\nthe girls but they were already taking the young men to Dachau, so she wanted him out the\ncountry.",
        "Q: What do you remember about Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Crystal Night, it was wild. We didn\u2019t go out and, excuse me, got the hair right on your\neye, I\u2019m looking at you, okay. They banged at the door and my mother yelled, \u201cWe don\u2019t\nhave any men here in the house. You deported my husband.\u201d And my brother hid in the\napartment, I don\u2019t know, I think in a closet or something, bathroom. And we didn\u2019t open the\ndoor. And we screamed and they screamed, and then they went away. Several times they\ncame that night, then later on we found out they burned the synagogues, they burned the\nTorahs, they took the rabbi and set his beard on fire and this was afterwards. I didn\u2019t, we did\nnot go out, we were too scared to go out. This was November, *38. It was horrible, it really,\nit was horrible when they took my father away, but they just went crazy, they really did. We\nlived on Main Street and there was so much yelling going on. I stood behind a curtain just to\nsee something and then they broke all the glass in the Jewish stores and there were quite a\nSylvia Green 14\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 14\nfew Jewish stores on Main Street. They went berzerk.",
        "Q: Did your mother have any plans to leave Karlsruhe at that time?",
        "A: Well, you need an affidavit to come to the United States and my aunt Mina\u2019, the one I\ncame to the United States with, had a brother-in-law in Lexington, Kentucky. And after we\nwere in Poland, we lived in the same apartment house my aunt lived in and we talked, if\nsomebody was going to survive that, to get in touch with Leon Urbach and there was a street,\nbut I didn\u2019t remember it when I wrote to them, and that\u2019s how we were gonna be reunited.\nSo, what was the question you asked?",
        "Q: I asked if your mother had plans to leave Karlsruhe.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, Urbach sent us an affidavit, but 1t was already too late, because Hitler went\ninto Austria, that was in \u201838. And the Austrian quota, you see, there was a quota, German\ncitizen, Polish citizen, Austrian citizen, you had to wait, you got a number, so they raised the\nAustrian quota for the Jews get out of Austria, so we couldn\u2019t get out, if maybe another six\nmonths we could have made it, but I guess 1t wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t have any contact with your father at all until. . .",
        "A: Until we met again, we were reunited in Krakow, we had to leave in \u201839, August \u201839, and\nwe were reunited with my dad and they rented a small apartment and. . .",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to just after you had found out that you were, you and your mother, you\nhad signed a form and you knew that you were to be leaving...\nSylvia Green 15\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 15",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: ...Germany. What did you do, how long did it take for you to be deported, what\nhappened?",
        "A: I worked in the Jewish Welfare Office, I was like a gopher, you know, taking papers,\nthere were Jewish offices in different. . .\n[end of side one of tape 1 of 3]\nBeginning of side B, Tape One",
        "A: Can you understand it? I talk with a very heavy accent.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You can understand?",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s fine. This is tape one, side B of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green. And Mrs.\nGreen, if you would just repeat from the beginning, the question about what you did after\nyou had signed that affidavit.",
        "A: I worked in the Jewish Welfare Office and, like gopher, you know, taking papers, they\nhad offices in different parts of town. And also, when the switchboard operator went to\nlunch, I would take over for a very short time, and that was one job I hated. I was a nervous\nwreck, always thought I was going to connect the wrong people. So, I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s\njust about all I remember what happened, I don\u2019t know how else I passed the time.",
        "Q: How long did it take until you actually had to leave Germany because of that paper that\n\u00b0 Mina Posner Urbach\nSylvia Green 16\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 16\nwas signed?",
        "A: There was, well, we had to leave, I think they gave you a few months to get ready. And\nwell, my brother, he, we had like an overseas trunk and, and he packed everything, and it\nwas shipped to Poland and the bedroom was shipped to Poland. We didn\u2019t get it. So, we left\nby August, beginning of August, you just had to leave.",
        "Q: Were you on a train?",
        "A: Yes, yes. We stopped by, we stopped off in Berlin, my brother went to England the same\nnight my mother and I caught a train to Poland, but we stopped off in Berlin. My mother\nwanted me to talk to the American Consulate and she thought I could do better, you know, to\ntalk to \u2018em, that maybe we could get out and come to America. I didn\u2019t even get to see the\nConsulate in Berlin. I just talked to the secretary or somebody at the front desk, maybe some\nother people had the same idea, too.",
        "Q: How long did the trip take?",
        "A: I know it was a overnight trip, but I don\u2019t know exactly. It\u2019s very hard to remember\neverything, it was such a long period of time. Like I told you when I talked over the\ntelephone to you, I started right from the beginning with him, it was \u201833 until \u00b045, that\u2019s 12\nyears, that\u2019s a long time.",
        "Q: Did you know where you were headed?",
        "A: Poland, yes, we were headed to Krakow.",
        "Q: By choice?\nSylvia Green 17\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 17",
        "A: Well, we had to leave Germany, yeah, but by choice, excuse me. After we crossed the\nborder, it was our choice to go to Krakow because my aunt lived in Krakow. If we had\nsomebody in Warsaw, maybe we would have gone to Warsaw, but we didn\u2019t know anybody.\nMy mother was born in a little town near Krakow.",
        "Q: So she, you mentioned that she thought that was where your father would be.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And I don\u2019t remember whether she knew or she thought he would be there\nbecause my aunts, my aunt lived in Krakow.",
        "Q: Was that your father\u2019s sister?",
        "A: No, my mother\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Do you remember what happened when you arrived?",
        "A: Yeah. We went on a vacation, my aunt Mina was on a vacation, vacation in Jordanow, it\nwas a vacation place, and we went there for a whole week. I even got a picture of that. And\nmy dad came or he was there, also. And it was great, I just thought \u201cWell now, everything 1s\ngoing to go get back to normal,\u201d and since they rented an apartment, that everything is going\nto be okay now, we were together and my brother was in England, so, but we were wrong,\nwe really were wrong.",
        "Q: Do you remember meeting with your father again, being reunited?",
        "A: Well, not exactly. I don\u2019t know whether, on the picture, he was in Jordanow with us, so I\ndon\u2019t know whether he was on vacation with my aunt or he came to Jordanow, it was not\nvery far from Krakow, it was a vacation place.\nSylvia Green 18\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 18",
        "Q: Where did you live in Krakow?",
        "A: First we lived with my aunt, can\u2019t remember the name of that street, but as soon as they\nstart bombing Krakow, we were in the basement and the house across the street got bombed.\nIn middle in the night, we just took sheets and dumped stuff in there, clothes and whatever,\nand we walked all the way to Sebastiana [ph], number nine, that was a place where we rent\nan apartment afterwards, I don\u2019t remember the first address.",
        "Q: So it was the... you and your mother and your father.",
        "A: My father, all three of us. And then we were not the only ones, because my aunt lived in\nthat apartment, and then some other sisters came from the country. And at the beginning, we\nall stayed at my aunt\u2019s place. And the children slept on the floor, and the adults used the\nbeds. And my mother wouldn\u2019t let me sleep on the floor, she thought I was too good to sleep\non the floor, and I was just dying to sleep on the floor with the other kids. Seems like such a\nsilly thing to remember, you know? But I guess it must have made an impression on me at\nthat time.",
        "Q: What did you do with your days?",
        "A: Well, this was \u201839, September, \u00b039, in 1940, just a few months, then we had to sweep the\nstreets, we had to wear armbands, that was in 1940. We had to, even if it rained, we had to\nsweep the streets. We had to clean barracks, we scrubbed the barracks on our knees, we\ncarried railroad tracks, all in 1940, but we still lived in the apartment. We had to meet in the\nmornings. And my trouble was, I was very tall, I was five-eight, and they would line us up,\nSylvia Green 19\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 19\nthe tallest in the middle and then the shorter ones and shorter ones, and I really got the heavy\nload. And they were not very kind to us when we cleaned the barracks, I mean they would\nyell and scream, or kick, or scare us they were gonna shoot us, but in the evening, after we\nwent back, my mother always had a hot meal for us and I can hear my mama say, \u201cIt\u2019s not\ngonna get any worse, it\u2019s not gonna get any worse.\u201d And all during the war, I can hear her\nsay, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna get any worse,\u201d but it did.",
        "Q: So you were working with other children?",
        "A: With other children, yeah. There was 40, I was 16.",
        "Q: Did your mother or father work?",
        "A: No, no, they didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know whether they didn\u2019t ask them to work, I don\u2019t\nknow. I have no idea.",
        "Q: And did you have any sort of education, even informal, during that time?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How many hours a day did you have to work this way?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, from morning till 1t got dark? But that hot meal sure tasted good, it really\ndid.",
        "Q: Did you have weekends free?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t remember. Do you know, came to a point you\nwere like a zombie, you only did what you supposed to do, more later on even. And you\ndidn\u2019t question it, you just did it. Worst thing really happened to me was, my parents and\nSylvia Green 20\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 20\nmy aunt always said, \u201cSylvia, if Germans are around, never speak German. You don\u2019t want\nthem to know that you German.\u201d So I spoke Polish, naturally with an accent. And there was\na German, we were carrying railroad tracks and loading them on trucks, so I did not know\nand I was talking German to another German Jew, he came up and he said, \u201cYou speak with\na Badenzer,\u201d Baden, it\u2019s like the state of Baden, like Kentucky, you know? But then the\naccent, \u201cYou speak exactly like I do,\u201d and he was the meanest thing, he would scream, he\nalways sit on top of the truck and yell at us. And we never did anything right, and always\nhad the gun, was going to shoot, and he said, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d And I had to tell him, I\nsaid, \u201cKarlsruhe am Rhine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m from Karlsruhe am Rhine. You come on and you sit on\nthe truck,\u201d and he gave me his lunch, and he made everybody watch. I couldn\u2019t swallow, I\ncould, I mean my throat closed up, you know? And he was yelling at me, \u201cYou eat. You\neat.\u201d I don\u2019t know whether he wanted me to have his lunch or he did it out of meanness or\nmaybe he thought he was helping me, I don\u2019t know. But I sure couldn\u2019t swallow, it just got,\ngot stuck in my throat.",
        "Q: Did you have to march a long way?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, yeah. You marched there, you had a meeting point and you marched, and you\nmarched home that night. And you had to wear your armband. And I don\u2019t understand,\nsome people say they, they wore a armband with a yellow star which said Juden there. We\nhad the blue star, a white armband, in Krakow. That\u2019s what I remember.",
        "Q: Do you remember, were you able to make any friends, or was there just no time?\nSylvia Green 21\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 21",
        "A: Well, we really couldn\u2019t talk too much because we were watched so closely. You made\nfriends and you didn\u2019t make friends. One day you had friends, the next day they were gone.\nI was fortunate that I was with my aunt constantly and we talked a lot. And especially at\nnight, you know, after we got together, we talked a lot. But you couldn\u2019t have friends\nbecause. . .",
        "Q: Did you find any ways to have fun?",
        "A: Huh? Fun? Yeah, you know how I had fun? To aggravate the Germans. That was our\nfun. We would laugh so hard where we felt like crying. And they could not understand and\nthen we, we would tell jokes, and we would laugh, really we didn\u2019t feel like laughing, but we\ndid laugh, and that just about killed them. \u201cMy God, you should be crying there, what are\nyou laughing?\u201d You know. But if they got closer to you, you really shut up and you didn\u2019t\nlook at \u2018em, you turned your head.",
        "Q: Did you ever see them hit any, anybody?",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes. Some hit people, I saw \u2018em kill people, I saw \u2018em kill babies and... for no\nreason. Really sometimes you wonder how they could live with themselves, I don\u2019t know. I\nthink a lot of them were drunk, I really do. I did not realize that until I saw \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList,\u201d then I saw there, I mean they were drinking, I knew Goeth\u2019, now I\u2019m getting ahead of\nmyself already. But they must have been drunk because they were yelling, yelling, yelling,\n\u201d Amon Goeth (1908-46), SS Officer, commanded the concentration camp at Plaszow\nfrom February 1943 to September 1944.\nSylvia Green 22\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 22\nmy God.",
        "Q: So you kept on working like this, until...",
        "A: Like that, day after day, whatever they asked me to do, I did. And then \u201841 was the\nghetto. We were notified we had to leave. So like in \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d we grabbed a\nbedsheet again, we dumped everything in there, and a suitcase, and you walked. And like I\ntold you on the phone, when I saw that \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d I was looking for myself in there\nbecause it was so real, it, to me it was a documentary, it was not just a movie. I was looking\nfor my relatives, I was looking for my parents, I was looking for myself. And that was no\npicnic, five, six people in a little apartment where you barely had room even to sleep on the\nfloor.",
        "Q: Was it just your family or. . .",
        "A: My family and my relatives, and then that got smaller all the time. I mean, one day, well,\nI\u2019m getting ahead again, it\u2019s... Well, we did the same thing there, we would march to work\noutside the ghetto and did the same thing, we shoveled snow, we washed the streets, and the\nsame yelling. There were different faces of... watching us, but it seemed like they were all\nthe same.",
        "Q: So you were doing the same. . .",
        "A: The same thing until \u201842, we got the job, my aunt got the job in Kabelwerk work and we\nmarched from the ghetto to Kabelwerk every morning, it\u2019s\u2014was a cable factory, and there\nwere different departments there. I had to cover cables, I was in charge of ten machines and\nSylvia Green 23\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 23\nmy aunt, they made, what did she do? Oh, I can\u2019t think of that word, you plug it in, you\nknow what I\u2019m talking about, a cord you plug in, those what do you call them?",
        "Q: Extension cord?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Extension cord?",
        "A: Yeah, something like that, but you plug it in in outlets like, what\u2019s it called?",
        "Q: Plug?",
        "A: Plug, okay, well she put those together, my aunt, it was a different department she\nworked in. And from morning we marched with a O.D. man [ph], it was a Jewish police and\nthen we went back again. And then, I think it was towards end of \u201842, then we were\nconcentrated in Plaszow, Patkusz [ph] Plaszow, the concentration camp, and we went to\nwork to Kabelwerk from Plaszow. And I only saw my parents twice.",
        "Q: Before, would you tell me about Plaszow, will you describe your living quarters to me, I\nknow you said you, you were in very cramped conditions, was, was it cold?",
        "A: Well, it was always cold. And I don\u2019t know what I looked like, there was no mirror, you\nknow, but I looked at my aunt and I knew what I looked like: a skeleton. We were always\ncold, all we wore were prison garb and it was in the wintertime, naturally you were cold and\nPoland is cold. And then you had to stand appell, they would count you and count you, they\nwanted to make sure that a half a person wasn\u2019t missing or something, sometimes it was for\nhours just of meanness, till they got bored with it. The quarters, they were barracks, and\nSylvia Green 24\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 24\nwith wooden slats and you just, there were a bottom one, I think they were like a bunk, like a\nbunk, you couldn\u2019t call 1t bed.",
        "Q: This is in Plaszow?",
        "A: In Plaszow. Patkush Plaszow.",
        "Q: What about in the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto was apartments, still apartments, but overcrowded. Because the ghetto, at\none time, people lived there, before the ghetto, they were homes, you know. I mean,\napartments.",
        "Q: And you, you, did you manage to get enough to eat during that time that you were in the\nghetto?",
        "A: Probably I did, I don\u2019t know, we got a meal in Kabelwerk, the interesting thing was that\nthe first time, I always ate kosher and when I started working in Kabelwerk, they served us\nmeals and it was the same meal the Gentile workers got, so that wasn\u2019t that bad because it\nhad a lot of vegetables in there, I don\u2019t remember about meat now, maybe it did. And I\nwouldn\u2019t eat, I came home and I barely dragged and my dad said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d We\nwere still in the ghetto at that time, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I said, \u201cDad, I can\u2019t eat it, they\nserving trayf.\u201d So it must have had meat in there also. And he said, \u201cYou have to eat. You\nhave to have strength to survive this. You have to eat.\u201d So the next day, I ate and I couldn\u2019t\nkeep it down, I was throwing it all up, I came home and I dragged again. I told my dad, I\nsaid, \u201cI can\u2019t keep it down.\u201d He said, \u201cYou have to eat. You have to force yourself.\u201d And\nSylvia Green 25\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 25\nthe third day, I was glad to get it. So from that on I started eating trayf and was lucky\nenough to get it, you know, at that time.",
        "Q: Were your parents working at Kabelwerk?",
        "A: No, no. Just my aunt and I and I was promised that I, 1f I would work in Kabelwerk, that\nmy aunt, my parents would be safe in the ghetto. But naturally, it was broken promises. So\nthe liquidation of the ghetto was March the 13, 1943. And my father got killed in the\nhospital, Spital. What happened was, every so often in the ghetto, they were rounding up\npeople to send them to concentration camps and he, they rounded him up on the street in the\nghetto and he jumped out the window and he fell, he was going to run away and hide\nsomewheres in the ghetto, and he fell, he broke his leg. So this was a makeshift hospital, and\nthey had some Jewish doctors who practiced, I mean they were doctors before the war, and\nhe was in traction and his leg was in traction, it was the last time I saw him. And he was shot\nin the hospital. Because my cousin saw him, he was in the clean-up crew, and he saw him\nlaying there on the sidewalk and there were pictures of my mother and of me and my brother\naround him. But I didn\u2019t know until I saw \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d that they gave them poison, the\nnurses gave them poison, I did not know that. And I was thankful. Did you see, they were\ngrateful, the patients were grateful to get it. They were even smiling because you heard them\ndownstairs already yelling and screaming, and by the time they came up, they start shooting\nand they didn\u2019t even notice that they were already dead. And I don\u2019t know what happened\nto my mother, I thought my mother might have ended up in one of the concentration camps,\nSylvia Green 26\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 26\nbut she might have been shot in the ghetto because they were just shooting left and right.",
        "Q: Were you with her up until that day, up until the day of deportation?",
        "A: No, no, no. I was in the Kabelwerk at that time, I mean I was working in Kabelwerk,\nAnd after the liquidation of the ghetto, then they built barracks in Kabelwerk and we were\nthere, we were not walking to Plaszow any more. We were concentrated where the factory\nwas.",
        "Q: That was...",
        "A: That was till about September, this was, I think May, March, \u201843 until I think, September\n\u201843, we were concentrated in the factory where we worked. And that wasn\u2019t that bad, the\nonly upsetting thing I still remember is, they supposed to have somebody come from\nSwitzerland, a Red Cross representative come from Switzerland and we had to clean the\nbarracks and we all got a care package, which we had to open but not touch. So when the\nrepresentative from Switzerland came, he looked around, the barracks were clean and we all\ntalked to him on the side how bad it is, you know. And he was not very sympathetic, he\nsaid, \u201cThe barracks are clean. Look at the nice care package. What are you complaining?\nPeople are getting killed, there is a war going on, you got it good here.\u201d So we told him, we\nsaid, \u201cWe will have to return those, we can\u2019t even touch it. The order was to open it up, but\nnot to touch it.\u201d And they took those care packages away, but it was so upsetting to us that\nhe didn\u2019t believe us, the representative from the Red Cross.",
        "Q: Before the ghetto was liquidated and you left, do you remember the last time you saw\nSylvia Green 27\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 27\nyour mother?",
        "A: The last time, it might have been maybe a month before. My aunt knew the O.D. man\n[ph], the one used to march us from one place to another, and he had to be in the ghetto. And\nmy aunt asked him, whether he would take me along. So I marched with him and he was\nyelling at me just because there were Germans around, you know, even going from one place\nto another, \u201cNow you walk straight.\u201d You know. And it might have been about a month\nbefore, I went to the hospital\u2014I went first and saw my mother and my mother told me my\ndad was in the hospital. So I went to the hospital and I only had a very short time, I don\u2019t\nremember exactly, maybe a whole hour or a half an hour, I don\u2019t remember that. And my\ndad said he was so happy to see me, he was just smiling and he had his leg in traction. So he\nsaid, \u201cI want you to meet my doctor, he is such a nice man.\u201d I said, \u201cDad, I have to go, I\nhave to go.\u201d They just gave me so much time, and I says, \u201cI got to go,\u201d and we hugged and I\nkissed him and I was walking out and the doctor just walked in. And my dad said, \u201cThis is\nmy daughter I have told you about.\u201d [phone rings in background] I was dad\u2019s little girl\nalways. And...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nSylvia Green 28\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 28\nTape 2",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green. And, Mrs. Green, I\u2019m\ngoing to ask you to repeat the story that you were telling about your last visit with your\nfather in the hospital in the Krakow Ghetto.",
        "A: Ghetto, yeah. Do you want me to hold it or you hold it? The last visit, I went into the\nghetto, an O.D. man had to go to the ghetto and he was a good friend of my aunt\u2019s and so my\naunt asked him to take me along so I could see my parents. And so we marched and he was\nyelling at me, I knew he was just doing it, you know, for the other Germans around, the ones\nwho would walk, and as we entered the ghetto, I went to my mother\u2019s place first and then\nshe told me that my father was in the hospital and I went to see my dad and he was so happy\nto see me because I always was daddy\u2019s little girl and we talked for awhile and he had his leg\nin traction and he told me what happened, how he broke the leg, that he jumped out the\nwindow because they were rounding them up to send them to gas chambers. And, well, we\ntalked for awhile and then I said, \u201cDad, I have to go.\u201d Well, I called him Papa, we called the\nfather Papa. I have to go because so and so, the O.D. man, I can\u2019t remember his name now, I\nhave to go back with him. And he said, \u201cOh, I wanted you to meet my doctor so badly.\u201d\nAnd I started walking out and the doctor walked in and my dad smiled, \u201cThis is her, this is\nSylvia, I have told you so much about it.\u201d And the doctor said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad to meet you,\nhe\u2019s talking about you all the time.\u201d And we exchanged pleasantries, I don\u2019t know exactly\nwhat and my dad and I, we hugged and we kissed and I walked out and I met the O.D. man\nSylvia Green 29\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 29\nand this was the last time, might have been maybe a month or a few weeks before the\nliquidation of the ghetto and I\u2019m really happy I had a chance to go there to see my parents.",
        "Q: And your mother, do you remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what happened to my mother, I saw in the paper that the Red Cross has a\nnew list, they found it somewhere, some in Russia which they kept under cover for years and\nyears and I went to the Red Cross here in Winchester and she asked some background\ninformation and I gave it to her and she said, \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be lucky that you can find out\nwhat happened to your mother.\u201d\u201d And then my aunt\u2019s husband and my aunt\u2019s daughter, and\nthey haven\u2019t found out. I got a, she couldn\u2019t find out anything and then I also got a letter\nfrom Baltimore they could not trace what happened to my mother. I always thought she\nended up maybe in Auschwitz or Treblinka or somewheres, but after I saw \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList\u201d I saw they were shooting like crazy. I mean, it\u2019s not what your looks was, they was\njust shouting and shouting and shooting, going crazy, so I don\u2019t know whether she was shot\nin the ghetto or what happened to her, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do you remember the last time you saw her or close to the last?",
        "A: That was the last time, when I saw my dad, that was the last time, about a month or two\nweeks before the liquidation of the ghetto. The ghetto was. . .",
        "Q: She was there, too?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, I went to her place first and she told me my dad was in the hospital, I was\nlooking for him. You know, when I went there I thought I was going to see both of them.\nSylvia Green 30\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 30\nSo that was the last time. And that was *43 and my mother was born in \u201887, that would make\nher 54 years old. And you know my dad never even had a cold, I don\u2019t remember my dad,\nhe only missed work one time I recall, he had an abscess on his chest and my brother cleaned\nit out and it got infected, my dad thought he was dying, he never was sick, he didn\u2019t know\nhow to handle it, you know. He went to bed. He never was sick and got killed and he only\nwas 53 years old, a nice looking man.",
        "Q: You had mentioned the O.D., the\u2014those are the Jewish police.",
        "A: The Jewish policemen, kapo, O.D., Jewish policemen. Some of them were pretty mean,\nalso, they thought they would get a better treatment when they mistreated us, some were\npretty rough.",
        "Q: Did you ever get beaten yourself by Germans, or?",
        "A: No. I got beaten one time, 25, by\u2014that was in Plaszow, Patkush-Plaszow, that\nconcentration camp, it was 1n a barrack and it was the one who was in charge of the barrack,\nand I got 25 paddles. There was a bad odor in that neighborhood where I was on the double\ndecker wooden thing where we were laying. And somebody had their period or something\nand they put some, it wasn\u2019t pads, it was something, and pushed it over where I was sleeping\nand she said it was mine, it didn\u2019t happen to be mine, I got 25 paddles. But that was, I think\nwas the only time. My aunt always told me, \u201cDon\u2019t walk erect, make yourself shorter,\u201d you\nknow, that you wouldn\u2019t stand out, and I always knew wherever I went, I just walked like\nthat. So some, some, some girls got raped and I was pretty fortunate, but I wasn\u2019t much to\nSylvia Green 31\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 31\nlook at because all those years already took its toll at a very young age and I was still in the\ndeveloping age, you know, when the war broke out.",
        "Q: Do you remember the deportations that happened before the ghetto was liquidated?",
        "A: No, I was not in the ghetto when it was liquidated, so I don\u2019t know anything, it\u2019s just\nwhat I heard, it all was hearsay. And my cousin was in the clean up crew and he saw my\nfather there and he told me that.",
        "Q: You mentioned that, as you were working at Kabelwerk. . .",
        "A: Kabelwerk, yeah.",
        "Q: You were in charge of ten machines?",
        "A: Ten machines, yes.",
        "Q: And were you supervising other workers?",
        "A: No, no. I was in charge of all ten machines and there was another person, another ten\nmachines and then in the back of you there were ten machines and they had to be in\noperation at all times. If not, the thing was, it was a very fine but strong thread, but if\nsomething went wrong and it skipped a stitch, you had to cut it open and, and do it again, I\nmean you really had to watch it so it would be evenly covered. And there for awhile, I just\nworked daytimes, but then, you worked one week, 12 hours daytime and the following week,\n12 hours nighttime. And they did this on purpose because you never could sleep. I mean\nthere was no way to get adjusted from one to another. So, well, we were sent back to\nPatkush Plaszow, September, \u201843.\nSylvia Green 32\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 32",
        "Q: When you say sent back, you meant you had been there before?",
        "A: Yeah. I was in Plaszow, I was in Plaszow, and we walked from Plaszow to Kabelwerk\nfrom Plaszow, and then they concentrated us in Kabelwerk for a short time. And then, but\nby the time we were sent back to Plaszow, we did not work in Kabelwerk any more. This\nwas September, \u201843. And when I got there, well, we had to work in the concentration camp,\nwe had to open graves, pull out gold teeth and the people who were in charge of this place\nwere prisoners, German prisoners and they were completely out of control. I mean they\nwere murderers, they were in prison because they were murderers from way before the war\nand they let them out to, to oversee us. And the guy\u2019s name, Hermann [ph], oh wow, he was\ncrazy, he really was crazy. I saw Goeth many times and as soon as we heard he was walking\nin the camp, I was running away because we knew he was target shooting, he didn\u2019t care\nwhat you looked like, he was just target shooting, he wanted to see how close he could shoot\nor how far he could shoot. And Schindler was with him many times and they were drinking\nbuddies. And I really don\u2019t think Schindler, well, he saved a lot of Jews and like they say,\nwho saves one life, saves the world, but I can guarantee you this man did not start out to save\nthe Jews. He started out to, to fill his pockets and somehow I think towards the end, he\nfound out that it\u2019s a losing war they\u2019re fighting so he changed his mind. But, thank God he\ndid because he saved a lot of Jews. But this was terrible, I mean in Plaszow, whether we had\nto go outside and load railroad tracks again or in, if we worked inside, then we had to dig, I\nmean open the graves and pull out the gold teeth or we carried barracks, they were always\nSylvia Green 33\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 33\nbuilding barracks and we had to, to carry that stuff. And really my legs are my weakest, my,\nmy health problem, are my legs. You can\u2019t work like a dog, like a man, and not come out\nscarred. So we were there until, oh, I didn\u2019t tell you about my cousin, Janek Haubenstock.\nWhen we came back in September *43, people were telling me about my cousin, Janek. He\nand a little boy were walking in the concentration camp and, evidently, Goeth was walking\ntowards him and my little cousin Janek had a habit, he drove his mother crazy, when he was\nupset he would whistle. He didn\u2019t even know he did this. And somebody told me that he\nwas whistling, that, it was a Russian song or a French anthem, I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t there,\nand they arrested him right there, in \u201c43, and they built a gallow to hang him, all night long,\nand the next day they brought him out to hang him, they made his father sit in the front row,\nmy uncle, Henek Haubenstock, and the rope broke. So he sent somebody for a new rope and\nmy poor little cousin, must have been just scared to death, and he was crawling up to Goeth\u2019s\nfoot and kissing his boot. And they said that he was just hissing, Goeth took the gun out and\nshot him right there. My uncle saw it and he had a complete stroke, never came back from it\nbecause when I went up there, I went to see him in Plaszow, in that concentration camp\nwhere it all happened, he was just a vegetable.",
        "Q: How old was your cousin?",
        "A: He was younger than I and I really don\u2019t know exactly, maybe four or five years younger,\nthis was in \u201843, I was 19, he might have been 15, 14 or 15, I don\u2019t know exactly.",
        "Q: Had you known him?\nSylvia Green 34\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 34",
        "A: I did not know them very well because I was born and raised in Germany and I was not in\nPoland, I think maybe about a couple of times. My mother went to visit, but she didn\u2019t take\nus children. Somehow you take children more now than you used to, it seems like it.",
        "Q: What kept you going?",
        "A: Well, this is interesting question. I don\u2019t know, really, what kept me going, the only\nthing, my aunt and I we talked all the time, and other people, too. Somebody had, had to\nsurvive to tell the world, we did not know that the world knew about it. We thought\neverybody was just ignorant about it, you know, they did not know. And I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t\nask me whether, people say you must have been very healthy. I wasn\u2019t any healthier than\nthe ones who died next to me because I had typhus, for two weeks I don\u2019t remember\nanything. I was so sick and we had to stand appell and they would drag me out, which I did\nnot know, and they stood me up, holding me up. The only thing I can think of is, my time\nwas not up. Somebody still had some purpose and also, I don\u2019t know, maybe it was a strong\nwill to live, to tell the world. But my world crumbled pretty quick after I came to the United\nStates, when I found out the world did know and didn\u2019t do a thing about it. And maybe it\nwas lucky I didn\u2019t know because I am pretty sure I would have given up, my aunt would\nhave given up. My aunt was just like my mother, we were just constantly together, really, by\nyourself you could not survive, you had to have somebody to care for\u2014your back\u2019s hurting\nnow? You okay? You had to have somebody to care for, and she did. The ration of bread\nwe got, she wanted to share with me, her portion. \u201cI\u2019m really not very hungry, Sylvia, why\nSylvia Green 35\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 35\ndon\u2019t you take this? I just couldn\u2019t eat it.\u201d I said, \u201cMuna, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou just\nwant me to have it because you know I am so hungry.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, honest, I just can\u2019t eat\nanother bite. I\u2019m just not hungry.\u201d That was my aunt. God bless her.",
        "Q: Did you have faith at the time?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have much religion all during the war and after the war, oh God, I was bitter. I\nblamed God, what happened and why. And I\u2019ve still got a lot of why\u2019s, thank God I got over\nthe bitterness. The bitterness doesn\u2019t work, it eats you up alive and it, it doesn\u2019t harm the\npeople you hate. It, I couldn\u2019t even talk German after the war, a complete blank. I blocked\nit out. And my brother told me, \u201cSylvia,\u201d he said, \u201cthe German language is beautiful.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cThe German language? I connect it with Hitler, it\u2019s not beautiful, it\u2019s terrible.\u201d And\nthen to meet people who had anything to do with Germany or German descent, I had to run\naway. And this kind man helped, he was so kind, because I just wanted to shut the door and\nthat\u2019s it, not think about it and when I got married, and even after, I was an atheist, I didn\u2019t\nbelieve in anything, I really didn\u2019t. And so after I got married, I still did not talk about it to\nanybody. It was like I was ashamed of it, like some of it was my fault, you know. And I\nknew it wasn\u2019t, but somehow I just couldn\u2019t talk about it and then it was a small town with\nnot many Jewish people, I already had one monkey on my head to be a Jew in a small town,\nand, but the door would not stay shut when I got pregnant. And then it all came back, the\nnightmares and waking up screaming, not waking up, excuse me, screaming in my dreams.\nSobbing wet, Jake would wake me up, and we would come in and we sit for hours and I had\nSylvia Green 36\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 36\nto start talking and this man sat next to me, I don\u2019t know whether he listened what I said or\nwhat, but his ear was there and that\u2019s what I needed. So I was pretty lucky to have a\nwonderful husband and the children are great, they really are. They\u2019re loving, very loving. I\nsaid that in the documentary, I did not want to raise them full of hatred. In fact, they didn\u2019t\nknow much about the Holocaust till I made that documentary. I want them to, want to raise\nthem healthy, happy and, physically and mentally, and they got problems, I mean\neverybody\u2019s got problems, but the problems are not connected with my past. Because I did\nset myself a goal that if I fail, then Hitler had won out, and he didn\u2019t because they\u2019re loving\nchildren, they really are big hearts.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go...",
        "A: But, well, September, January, \u201844, naturally, we had to line up, we had to be counted,\nand they were telling us we were going to a wonderful place, there\u2019s gonna be clean beds\nand plenty food, you\u2019re gonna to work hard, but you\u2019re gonna have it good. And my aunt\nsaid, \u201cWow, it sounds like paradise,\u201d you know. And then we were crammed into cattle\nwagon. And Krakow, Auschwitz is not that far from Krakow, but it took such a long time\nbecause the train stopped every few feet because the planes were bombing. And before we\ngot into the cattle wagon, they gave us some bread and that was all. And there was a\ncontainer with water, and one container for the bathroom. And they stopped and gosh, were\nwe pray, praying. Yeah, they jumped out of the, the trains, and they were hiding in ditches,\nthe German, and we were laughing, we really were laughing. There was a little window up\nSylvia Green 37\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 37\nin top, those cattle wagons, the old ones, and we would get on each others\u2019 shoulders to lift\nthem up to see so we could get a good laugh because they were so scared. And we yelled,\n\u201cBomb us, bomb us, come on.\u201d You know, we didn\u2019t care, we really didn\u2019t care as long as\nthey would have gotten killed. And then we went a little bit longer, to me it seemed like we\nwent the whole week, but we didn\u2019t. But you see, time was, didn\u2019t seem important at all. It\nwas just running into a day or night till the cattle wagon stopped, they opened the doors and\nthey were yelling, \u201cOut, out, out, out, out!\u201d Kicking and dogs, and we were running. And\nthen we looked and we knew where we were, because we saw the chimneys burning.",
        "Q: You had heard about Auschwitz?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Everybody heard about Auschwitz. And you could smell the smell of human\nflesh. So, you know how they kept the records so neat, you know, they had to have orders,\nthey didn\u2019t have any orders. We arrived without orders, they didn\u2019t know what to do with\nus. So we were sitting there or standing there between the ovens, near the gate when they\nopened. And on the other side were the barracks and you sat there for 48 hours and they\nwere running like crazy. They couldn\u2019t get any orders, they didn\u2019t know whether we end up\nin the, should end up in the gas chamber or at the camp. And we just sat. And it was cold, it\nwas January. And finally there still were no orders, but then we took, I guess they were\nafraid to send us to the ovens, if the orders came that we should not been killed, they\ncouldn\u2019t bring us back after they once gassed us, you know. So then they told us to go in to\nshowers and we took the shower, naturally there\u2019s never enough water. And then we walked\nSylvia Green 38\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 38\nout in the nude, in January in Poland, shivering. And then we got prison garbs and they gave\nme wooden shoes and they make me wear those shoes, I couldn\u2019t walk in the shoes. It\nseemed like those shoes had a mind of their own. And then they put us in barracks and\nabout, well, you didn\u2019t do anything. You just laid there or you stood there and we were there\nabout 12 or 14 days, too many.\n[end of side one of tape 2]",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green. Did they, did they give\nyou a tattoo when you arrived at Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, no. In Auschwitz, and I found that out later on, that you had to work there before\nthey tattooed your arm. And we didn\u2019t work there. We just were there 12, 14 days. And we\ndidn\u2019t do anything. One time we got black coffee or whatever it was, it was awful, in the\nmorning, and we had to carry, they were heavy kettles and in the evening you got the water\nsoup. So I remember that very well, it was my turn to go, and some other girls also went and\ncoming back and we were almost to our barrack and those stupid wooden shoes wouldn\u2019t\nstay on my feet and I dropped the kettle and our whole supper was there. And really I was\nscared that the people are going to kill me, the hungry people, you know, but they didn\u2019t.\nWe just all lay down and we licked the floor, whatever fell there.",
        "Q: Did they shave your hair?",
        "A: Already partially, every so often it was shaved, the hair. It was already very short before\nwe went in Auschwitz and then in Auschwitz they shaved it again, and delouse \u2018em, they\nSylvia Green 39\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 39\nsprayed you, and they deloused you with some kind of powder that they, they, they sprayed\nyou with.",
        "Q: Were you still with your aunt?",
        "A: Yeah. We were liberated together. Let\u2019s see, after about 12 or 14 days in Auschwitz, we\nwere shipped back in the cattle wagon to Bergen-Belsen. And when we got to, I think 1t was\nstill January of \u201844, because we were pretty much one of the first ones there. When we came\nto Bergen-Belsen, they had nothing but tents and then there was a big storm one night and it\nwas quiet, there was no shouting and it was very quiet in comparison to Auschwitz, there\nwas so much commotion constantly. It was very quiet and my aunt said, \u201cYou know, Sylvia,\nin comparison to Auschwitz, this is a vacation.\u201d But we didn\u2019t know that was...1t was no\ngas chambers, but it was a starvation camp. They just starved you to death. So there weren\u2019t\nthat many people, but then we had a big storm and it knocked all the tents down and they\nmoved us to barracks. And they were looking for somebody who spoke a lot of languages,\nso I applied for it. I spoke German fluently, by that time already, I spoke Polish fluently, but\ncouldn\u2019t read or write it because when you\u2019re young you pick up languages, they said I\nspoke it with a heavy accent. So I applied for it and I knew about three words of French, or\nmaybe five words, and two words of Russian, so I got the job, not very long, though, but\nenough that I had a foot in the kitchen. And so I could steal food so my aunt wouldn\u2019t be\nhungry. So there were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers\nworking in the kitchen, and there were three Frenchmen. They were college students and\nSylvia Green 40\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 40\nthey worked with the underground, Gentiles, and they got caught. So they were funny, they\nwere so funny. They all spoke German and wouldn\u2019t let the German know that they spoke\nGerman. And they would sing, and they would sing the French anthem, and they would\nlaugh and they made us laugh. But the Russian people, we had to stay away from \u2018em.\nWhen when we stole food, we didn\u2019t tell on each other, but the Russians told on us when\nthey saw us stealing food. They kept to themselves pretty much, we were afraid of \u2018em. So,\nwell, I got typhus in the, back in Belsen, and Paul Lepitre, one of the Frenchmen, stole food\nand sent it to the camp, so by the time I got the food, there wasn\u2019t that much food left\nbecause she shared it with other people, but evidently 1t must have helped some. And when I\ngot better after two weeks, I noticed that I didn\u2019t have any shoes, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to \u2018em, my shoes, and I told the girl, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t go back to work in the kitchen\nwithout shoes.\u201d So Paul Lepitre stole some man\u2019s boots and sent it to the camp with a friend\nof mine. And after I went back to the kitchen, those three Frenchmen hoisted me up on their\nshoulder and they were marching and they were singing La, what is it, La Marseillaise, the\nFrench anthem. Ach, the German, I\u2019m telling you, they would get so red and yell and we\u2019d\nsay, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a stroke, he\u2019s going to have a stroke.\u201d But no, not such luck.\nAnd we were liberated April the 14\"...",
        "Q: Before...",
        "A: ...of \u201c45. It was really strange, by that time I wasn\u2019t working in the kitchen any more,\nnobody was working anywheres because there was no food and they already knew that they\nSylvia Green 41\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 41\nwere in bad shape because the guards were disappearing there and they came back, there was\nno place for \u2018em to go. We didn\u2019t know that, they were surrounded by the Russians, by the\nBritish and by the Americans, and there was no place to run around, so they were digging\nditches. And oh, they were angry, I\u2019m telling you, you couldn\u2019t even set a foot out, if not,\nyou got shot. So we stayed pretty much indoors and everybody was sick, no energy, no\nwater, no food and then I got dysentery problems again. I went out one night to relieve\nmyself and I felt something cold I was sitting on and I looked, it was a body and I just moved\nover. I mean, you got, evidently, you got conditioned to that. I mean, just thinking about tt,\nit blows my mind, you know. And I crawled back in. So one night, it was between 14th and\n15th, the night, or was early in the morning, we heard a lot of tanks rolling and rolling and\nrolling, we didn\u2019t know what was the matter. And it was morning and somebody came\nrunning in, \u201cWe are liberated! We are liberated!\u201d And they said, \u201cBy the British Army, we\nare liberated!\u201d Well, I crawled out there and my aunt went out there, too. I said, \u201cWhat are\nyou talking about?\u201d The German commanders, they were standing in front of the tanks, they\ntied them down evidently, I don\u2019t know. And they, with no medals, they stripped them of all\nthe medals, but I didn\u2019t see that. I still saw the Nazis, I said, \u201cWhat you talking about? Here\nthey are.\u201d And then we found out we were liberated, and I stood up, then I start singing the\nBritish anthem, God Bless the King, I remembered that from school. And, ah, there was\nsuch, so much commotion going on. They were so wonderful. And they gave us care\npackages, we didn\u2019t know how to handle those care packages, we ate everything! And that\u2019s\nSylvia Green 42\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 42\nwhy so many died, on that starvation diet for so many years and then you drank cocoa, I\nmean the powder, and coffee, you smoked cigarettes, chocolate, all at one time and sardines.\nThey meant well, I mean they didn\u2019t mean any harm. But I think that the world learned\nfrom that, whenever prisoners come back, they kind of condition them slowly with food.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back a little bit to before liberation and you had mentioned that, that you had\ntyphus and I remember earlier you had said that you, you, you had to go out to roll call\neveryday and other people were holding you up.",
        "A: Yeah, I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember, two weeks I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember\nanything. They told me, you see, the thing about it is, they had to have a certain amount,\nthey had the number there and that number had to satisfy \u2018em. Well, they dragged me out\nand somebody called, you said, \u201cOne, two, three,\u201d you know, you called your own number,\nso somebody must have called a number for me. If not, they\u2019d be still standing there today.\nI mean, it had to be like to say 550, it had to be 550. If not, they went back in the barracks\nand they counted the dead. So they told me that they dragged me out every day and then it\ncame, I mean that\u2019s a lot of people that\u2019s, you know, lined up. They probably when it came\nto me, they just held me up.",
        "Q: Do you know if you were in a hospital at that time?",
        "A: No, I was not in a hospital, there was no hospital there. After the war, they made a\nhospital where Himmler\u2019s palace was, in Bergen-Belsen, he had a palace there and they\nmade this into a hospital. The ones who were so sick, they took them there, but by that time,\nSylvia Green 43\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 43\nI was, I wasn\u2019t that sick any more.",
        "Q: How did you get better?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, the grace of God, I don\u2019t know. I told you, my time wasn\u2019t\nup, I guess. I had to have those beautiful babies.",
        "Q: And your aunt, was she working?",
        "A: Inthe camp, no. I stole food while I was in the kitchen, but then there were times we just\nlaid there. She had typhus before I had it even, my aunt. Everybody had typhus, it\u2019s a\ndysentery, but to get well, it\u2019s hard to explain with any antibiotics or anything, because now\nyou hear about typhus, everybody dies. It was like cholera, you know, a long time ago\npeople died, not many survived.",
        "Q: Did you have the sense around that time that, that the end of the war was coming close\nand that you were going to survive?",
        "A: No. That would be too much thinking, I didn\u2019t have the energy. I think I told you that\nearlier in that interview, you did what you were supposed to do and you did it and hour went\ninto hour into day and night, it... there was no difference. No, I never. The only thing, like\nsometimes we would sit around and be miserable and then somebody would say, \u201cYou\nknow, on Shabbat, Friday night? Boy, my mother set a table fit for a king.\u201d \u201cWhat did she\ncook?\u201d \u201cWell, there was fish and chicken soup and chicken and roast beef and vegetables\nand dessert.\u201d And somebody would pop up, \u201cThat\u2019s enough food, I can\u2019t eat another bite.\u201d\nYou know, really, I\u2019m not kidding, we could taste that food.\nSylvia Green 44\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 44",
        "Q: Did you have other fantasies?",
        "A: No. Just blank, just a zombie. And I don\u2019t think I was the only one, I think everybody\nwas that way. I was so conditioned from the time I was nine years old until the end of the\nwar, that only thing many times you ask yourself, why, why, why? I still ask myself now,\nwhy? I said when my time comes, I\u2019m going to have a list that long and I\u2019m, when I get\nupstairs, I\u2019m going to ask Him maybe, \u201cWhy this, why that,\u201d you know. But you know\nwhat\u2019s very upsetting to me? The world didn\u2019t learn anything by it, if the world just would\nhave learned something by it. Look that ethnic cleansing now, they\u2019re killing babies. So I\nfeel like that whole thing was a waste. At least 1f people would have learned by it. But they\ndidn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Do you remember, at liberation, and you, you suddenly saw, realized that you were\nliberated...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: ...and you were inspired to sing.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, that national, the British, God Save the King. I met a British\nsoldier and I still remembered, whoever lives going to get in touch with the Urbachs in\nLexington, Kentucky. So I told him about, I had about two years of English and I didn\u2019t do\ntoo well, but I still have the letter here, I ... I was going to pull 1t out and show it to you. I\nwrote to Urbachs in Lexington, Kentucky, but we couldn\u2019t mail, I mean there was no mail\ngoing between Germany and, and America at that time. And I gave it to that British soldier I\nSylvia Green 45\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 45\nmet and he sent this letter to his mother in England and his mother, his parents, forwarded\nthat letter to America, to Urbachs, Lexington, Kentucky. And at that time, Lexington,\nKentucky was small, there were about 65,000 people, so everybody knew each other, so it\ngot there just, Leon Urbach, Lexington, Kentucky, United... USA. So my brother was in the\nAmerican Army, he, Urbach sent him an affidavit from England to come to the United States\nin 1940 and he was drafted in \u201c41. So he was still serving in the American Army, he was\nwith Intelligence, he spoke seven languages fluently. And the Urbachs got in touch with\nhim. And he came to Bergen-Belsen, and I think I told you that previously, when they came\nrunning in, telling me that my brother was out there. And I run out and all in a sudden I just\nstopped. I thought my dad was there because they look so much alike. So then he took us to\nMunich, he was stationed in Munich, my brother was stationed in Munich. And he sent an\nambulance after us, I think 1t was around October, \u201845. When he came to the camp, he\nbrought oranges, food, and ah, we, we just had a party. And my brother said, \u201cI just brought\nit for you and Aunt Mina.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t eat that by myself, not sharing it, what you talking\nabout?\u201d He didn\u2019t understand. You know, you\u2019re hungry together, you party together! So it\nwas good food, it really was. And he rented an apartment in Munich.",
        "Q: When you saw him and he arrived at Bergen-Belsen and you thought it was your\nfather...",
        "A: It was scary, that\u2019s why I, I couldn\u2019t talk, I just stood there like paralyzed, even had a\nmustache like my dad at that time.\nSylvia Green 46\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 46",
        "Q: Did you have a feeling of, of, of sadness or of joy?",
        "A: I had no feeling, I just looked, I knew my dad was killed and I thought my dad was\nstanding there. It wasn\u2019t sadness, I just couldn\u2019t understand it, you know. They look so\nmuch alike, almost like twins. And then I was very happy. Yeah, we just grabbed and we\nhugged and... He went through his own hell, because he went in my place to England and\nall during the war, that was on his mind. He told me, he said, \u201cI\u2019m so happy that you are\nalive, I don\u2019t know how I would have managed to, to live, to know that you got killed and\nI\u2019m alive.\u201d",
        "Q: Had you thought about him much through those years?",
        "A: Yeah, my mother would talk, \u201cI wonder how Bernard is getting along,\u201d you know, but\nthat\u2019s, we didn\u2019t know. \u201cI hope he\u2019s doing okay.\u201d But we knew at that time he was in\nEngland, we didn\u2019t know he came to America. But we felt like he was safe.",
        "Q: So you went to Munich?",
        "A: We went to Munich and he could have, he was discharged about, we came in June, he\nwas discharged about two or three months before and he could have come to the United\nStates, so he signed up as a civilian for another six months because he wanted us, he wanted\nfor us to get out of Germany. He was afraid that we weren\u2019t pushy enough probably, you\nknow. And so he stayed and he took care of all the papers and we got out about June. We\narrived in New York.",
        "Q: Would you say you were still feeling numb about everything that had happened?\nSylvia Green 47\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 47",
        "A: Well, you come to a strange country, you\u2019re scared. People you didn\u2019t know, all right,\nthe Urbachs were related to my aunt, but they were no relations to me. No, I wasn\u2019t feeling\nnumb then. I was angry, I was full of hatred, I think I brought this up before.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, how long had you been in Munich?",
        "A: From October, \u201845, until June, \u201846.",
        "Q: And what did you do while you were there?",
        "A: Go crazy, go wild. Eat, drink, bleach your hair blond, peroxide my hair. We didn\u2019t know\nwhether to walk on our head, we didn\u2019t know whether to walk on our feet. I mean all that\nfreedom, all in a sudden, listen, that\u2019s, that\u2019s overpowering. And my brother brought a lot of\nfood home from, oh, what do you call that, the mess hall or something, is that called mess\nhall? I think. Brought a lot of food and all his friends brought food. I guess they felt so\nsorry for us, you know.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t have to do any work?",
        "A: No, no, no. He took care of us. Well, the strangest thing, he got that apartment for us\nand he just told the Germans to get out. And they were crying and they were crying, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s\nour apartment, how we, we\u2019ve been living here.\u201d And he was not very sympathetic, he told\nthem they had to get out and some of his friends, also. We got the apartment, so while we\nalready lived in, in that apartment, they came ringing the doorbell, \u201cWe want to move back,\nthis is our apartment.\u201d So I was angry, I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Id like to see\nmy parents, too, what did you do to them?\u201d I wasn\u2019t... we weren\u2019t very sympathetic.\nSylvia Green 48\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 48",
        "Q: And they just left?",
        "A: Yeah, they left. And then they came back two or three days later on. Looking back now,\nI, I mean, it was theirs, you know, but look what they did to us. I mean, the one they killed,\nyou couldn\u2019t bring those back, could you? And this was only material things. But I told you\nI was angry, it was just all bundled up, you know, and all in a sudden it just had to explode.\nBut Munich was great, it really was. We went to museums and we went to concerts, we\nwent to the opera. He came in, because...",
        "Q: So when you were in Munich, you, you, you were angry, but you were also having fun?",
        "A: Oh, I was having fun. And I\u2019m not the only one, I mean everybody had fun. Somebody\nsaid, \u201cOh, you...\u201d I used to be a blond as a child, kind of golden blond. \u201cOh, you got brown\neyes. Blond hair and brown eyes is unusual, how about bleaching?\u201d So they used peroxide.\nAnd I came to the United States as a blond. And then there was a museum, it was kind of a\nmeeting place of the survivors, and once in awhile you can meet some which you knew. I\nmean, you met people all the time, so you couldn\u2019t remember everybody, you know? But\nsometimes you run across somebody, and \u201cOh, you are here, you are here.\u201d You know,\n\u201cYou survived it.\u201d And we grabbed and we hugged and we were wild.",
        "Q: You made new friends?",
        "A: In Munich, no, not really. I mean, people I was together, then I was with my brother a\nlot, my aunt was with us constantly, you see, my aunt was my best friend, there was nothing\nI couldn\u2019t tell her. And she knew exactly how I felt about things. She was my best friend,\nSylvia Green 49\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 49\nshe was my psychiatrist, and I helped her. But my brother was very good to us, he really\ntook us places and his American soldiers, his friends, were very nice. You know, we did\nmake some friends, Brechner\u00ae, he came back to Munich after the war and he opened a store\nthey had before the war. And he got us some material and we had some raincoats made. At\nthat time a lot of things were custom-made, you just couldn\u2019t go in a store, maybe house\ndresses they would sell in a store, but not like you go and you can buy suits and all that.\nThose things were custom made a long time ago.\nEnd of Tape 2.\n* Salo (\u201cSid\u201d) Brechner\nSylvia Green 50\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 50\nTape 3",
        "Q: This is tape three, side A of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green. Mrs. Green, you were\njust talking about your, your stay in Munich and you spent almost a year there, and...",
        "A: Well, not quite a year. From October until June.",
        "Q: From October until June, so a little over a half a year.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. And, and during this time, did you reflect much on what had happened to you\nbefore, in the...?",
        "A: No, not too much. I had a lot of living to do, because I didn\u2019t live before. That\u2019s,\neverybody felt that way. We ate too much, we drank too much, we just felt like a, a bird\ncoming out the cage. It\u2019s very overpowering, all, all that freedom. You were not told what\nto do, you could walk, you could go to bed when you wanted, you had nice beds and sheets.\nI mean, things you take for granted.",
        "Q: Did you think much about the future, about what you would do?",
        "A: Well, I knew that we were coming to the United States, this we knew because my brother\nfilled forms out all the time, you know, and then we had to go, for examinations and you had\nto get passports. And finally, the day came when we left Germany and I think we were, we\ncame over on the ship, Marine Perch, and, from Bremerhaven. And I think we were on\nwater about 11 days because they had to stop, there were some mines, and they didn\u2019t tell us\nthey had mines in the water until they deactivated it. They didn\u2019t tell us about it, we would\nSylvia Green 51\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 51\nhave been scared to death. But I would say there were about 800 passengers, maybe with the\ncrew also, 1t was a very small ship. And it was not equipped, it was not a luxury liner. We\nhad one little room, but from the 800 people, there might have been about 40, 50 who didn\u2019t\nget sick. Most of them got sick, seasick. And my aunt was seasick. They, the younger\npeople they put in the bunk beds, and it was a great big room. And the, the food was served\nbuffet and, but my aunt, she was over 40 and she had, I think it was a semi-private room.\nThey just gave it to her, after, up to a certain age. And they ate at a table, they were served\nand my poor aunt was in bed all the trip. I went down every day to see her and I want to\nbring her some food and she said, \u201cGet out of here. I can\u2019t look at that food!\u201d So, we had a\ngood time, we entertained ourselves, the 45, 50, and it was just amazing to us, when we got\nto New York, all in a sudden those people start pouring out the ship, you know, you haven\u2019t\nseen them, \u201cHow did you get on? I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d But so many were sick. Then we had\nto wait, that you had relatives or somebody had to pick you up at the pier. They wouldn\u2019t\njust let you go loose. And my aunt and I, we waited and waited and my cousin in New York\nsupposed to pick me up. I did not know those cousins except one cousin, he was in\nKarlsruhe and he was just like my brother. At that time, first cousins were like brothers and\nsisters, very close. And he\u2019s supposed to pick me up and he just didn\u2019t show up and my aunt\nand I, we were the last ones. And, oh God, were we scared, I start crying and all in a sudden\na woman came up to me and she said, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019re Sylvia Farber, aren\u2019t you? From Karlsruhe?\u201d\nI said, \u201cYes.\u201d And she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, do you remember Berndt Weissman?\u2019 I said,\nSylvia Green 52\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 52\n\u201cYeah, I went to school with him, the, the Jewish school.\u201d He had a speech defect and the\nchildren were not very kind to him and children can be cruel. So she said, \u201cWell, I really\ndidn\u2019t have you on my list, but I looked at the list and I saw Sylvia Farber and I wanted to\ngreet you, so I switched with somebody and I want to say, welcome to America and thank\nyou for being so nice to my son, Berndt.\u201d And that kind of felt good that people\nremembered you, you know. And he was such a nice boy but the kids just didn\u2019t give him a\nchance, he was very intelligent, his father was a doctor, I don\u2019t know what happened to him,\nlost contact. So while we were talking, my cousin came with other cousins. The other\ncousins, but I didn\u2019t know the other cousins, they were waiting for that one cousin, he had to\nsign for us. And he came and he looked like a Farber, he looked like my dad, he looked like\nmy brother and we just start hugging and kissing, you know. It seemed like the Farber, the\nlooks go through the family, it\u2019s amazing.",
        "Q: Was your brother with you?",
        "A: No, my brother didn\u2019t come until September. You see, he signed up six more months to\nmake sure to get us out. And I really loved New York, I wanted to stay there, but my brother\nwouldn\u2019t let us. My brother said, \u201cListen, we\u2019re going to make a home in Lexington,\nKentucky, it\u2019s a beautiful little town. And that way we can be together, we don\u2019t have\nparents.\u201d And I listened to him and I stayed in Lexington. Do you know where he ended\nup? New Jersey. He got his undergraduate degree from University Kentucky, he got his\nMaster\u2019s degree from Chicago, University of Chicago, he was working on his Ph.D. in, at\nSylvia Green 53\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 53\nColumbia University. And he stayed there. Then when he got married, they moved to New\nJersey.",
        "Q: This relative of yours in Lexington, will you describe how he was...",
        "A: They really were not related to me. They were related, the one, Leon Urbach was my\naunt Mina\u2019s brother-in-law. My aunt Mina\u2019s husband Alec and Leon Urbach were brothers.\nAnd I was related to my aunt Mina through my mother. You see, so they really were not\nrelated, but they were wonderful, they were, really were wonderful.",
        "Q: And so your brother had been living with Leon Urbach?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: When he came in \u201840, he lived with Leon Urbach, then he went to Louisville and they\ngrabbed him right away in \u201841 for the Army. So they really were wonderful people and they\ntreated me better than the daughter, the daughter said. Because I was older than their\ndaughter, five and a half years, and I could stay out longer on a date. And she resented that.\nShe said, \u201cThey love you more than they love me.\u201d They really were great people. But we\ndidn\u2019t stay very long. My brother came in September and we rented an apartment and we\nlived on my brother\u2019s Army pay, ninety dollars a month, forty-five dollars rent. Water bill\nwas cheap, two dollars, electric bill and we made it, can you imagine? And we only had\nhamburger on Sundays. But we wanted to be independent, Urbachs didn\u2019t want us to leave,\nbut we wanted to get started. So my brother start teaching languages, he, he was working on\nSylvia Green 54\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 54\nhis undergraduate degree and he was tutoring in French and German and sometimes he\ndidn\u2019t go to bed until two, three o\u2019clock in the morning because he had to do his own\nhomework. And he caught the flu, he couldn\u2019t get over it and the doctor said something has\nto give, you need sleep. So I went to work for eighteen dollars a week, but that was money.",
        "Q: Did you speak English?",
        "A: By that time, a little bit, Urbachs, you see, we came in June and I went to work, I think it\nwas Christmas or right after Christmas. And they were nice enough to give me a job, it was\nWolf Wile\u2019s, they were Jewish people. And I think they gave me a job, they felt sorry for\nme and then I was a novelty.",
        "Q: This was in the paper?",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s me, a young Sylvia Farber.",
        "Q: And you have blond hair.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And there\u2019s your aunt. . .",
        "A: Do you know it stayed blond until practically. . .",
        "Q: ...on the left.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s my aunt.",
        "Q: The headline says, Polish. . .",
        "A: Polish refugees, there were students, they kind of messed it up a little bit, they didn\u2019t get\nit straight, some of it.\nSylvia Green 55\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 55",
        "Q: Will you read the entire headline?",
        "A: Yeah. This was 9/27/46, and it was the Lexington Leader: \u201cPolish Refugee, Ex-Prisoners\nNow at Henry Clay High School.\u201d We just sat through English classes, American\nGovernment classes. And then some of the students gave up their study hour to help us learn\nhow to read, I thought it was very nice of them. And then also, when I was working, I\naudited some classes at the University Kentucky from eight till nine in the morning. And Joe\nWile\u2019s niece who went to University Kentucky, picked me up and took me to work so I\nwould be there by nine o\u2019clock. And they were very nice because I should, supposed to have\nbeen there at ten minutes to nine, but I talked to him and then he said that\u2019s alright.",
        "Q: Were you interested, very interested in getting an education?",
        "A: It was not the education as much, what I wanted, I wanted to learn how to speak English,\nit\u2019s very hard to think in German and then have to translate everything, it\u2019s not easy. I mean,\nwere you ever in a foreign country where you walked around with a dictionary? And my\nproblem was that I always would put the buggy before the horse somehow, the sentence\nconstruction was very difficult. And English is a very hard language, and the spelling, my\nGod, there\u2019s so many words they sound alike. Now, I wish I would have gone on to get an\neducation, I really, but the education at that time wasn\u2019t that important.",
        "Q: What were you doing in your job?",
        "A: I started out as wrapping packages and, but that April, I just felt like, you\u2019re stupid, you\ncan do better than that, you know. So I start sneaking out and waiting on customers and the\nSylvia Green 56\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 56\ncustomers loved it because I was a survivor which they never met another one and that\npublicity, I mean everybody knew about me. So I remember Joe Wile said to me, \u201cWhat are\nyou doing on the floor?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, I can do better than that, just wrap\npackages.\u201d And, well, normally a clerk couldn\u2019t have said that, but then, I didn\u2019t have the\nclothes I was supposed to wear, supposed to wear dark clothes, navy blue or gray or black. I\ndidn\u2019t have it, he told me, \u201cYou wear what you got.\u201d So he really made, made allowances\nfor me. In fact, people must have talked about this\u2014a Holocaust survivor\u2014and another\ndepartment store, Martin, the buyer, I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t think she came in to Wolf\nWile\u2019s, she must have waited outdoors or something, she came up to me and she said, \u201cI\nreally would like for you to work for Martin\u2019s. How much money do you get at Wolf\nWile\u2019s?\u201d And I said, \u201cEighteen dollars a week.\u201d She said, \u201cWe can do better than that, we\ncan pay you twenty-five dollars.\u201d So, I said, \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d So I went to Joe Wile,\nI thought that was the right thing to do because he gave me the chance. The factories where\nI applied in Lexington wouldn\u2019t hire me because I couldn\u2019t speak English fluently. Now,\nyou could sue \u2018em because you discriminated, but at that time you didn\u2019t know about suing\npeople. So I told him, I said, \u201cListen, they approached me at Martin\u2019s and they would pay\nme twenty-five dollars a week.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, 1f Martin\u2019s can pay you twenty-five, I can\ngive you twenty-five.\u201d I did feel guilty because the people I worked with, some been\nworking there ten, 20 years and didn\u2019t make more than twenty-five or twenty-seven dollars,\nbut I told him, I said, \u201cYou know, we need the money.\u201d He said, \u201cI know.\u201d So people in\nSylvia Green 57\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 57\nLexington were very nice, very decent.",
        "Q: When did you meet your husband?",
        "A: Jake?\n(Unknown person): You know, I think you better wind this up, three hours is enough.",
        "A: Open through his cousin. We met his cousin, we lived on McDowell Road, Chevy\nChase area, I don\u2019t know whether you know that area there, okay. And Martha Steinburg\nand she said, \u201cI know a young man I would like for you to meet.\u201d And I was going with that\nHungarian fellow, I was telling you I met on the boat, from Budapest. And he proposed\nbefore we got off the boat, he wanted to get married, but my aunt said, \u201cNo way, he 1s\nscared, he doesn\u2019t want to be alone to get into a country not knowing anybody.\u201d So we\ncorresponded, and we talked on the telephone sometimes. So I was telling Martha, I said,\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m dating a fellow in New York.\u201d But we had an understanding that we could date\nother people also, since we were that far apart. And she said, \u201cI really would like to.\u201d My\naunt said, \u201cWell, you have nothing to lose.\u201d So they fixed up a date, they fixed up a date,\nMartha and Jake, for eight o\u2019clock a certain day. It was eight-twenty, eight-thirty, quarter to\nnine, no Jake Green. I got undressed, I put my slack suit back on, I was madder than a\nhornet. I wasn\u2019t used to be stood up. Doorbell rings there, \u201cI\u2019m Jake Green.\u201d And I said, he\nsaid, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go out with me, I will understand.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cI got lost.\u201d Well, where we lived, it was like McDowell Road and then there was a\ncircle and the next road, Irvine, there was a circle and he drove around in circles in the dark\nSylvia Green 58\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 58\nand he went downtown to a gas station and they gave him directions and this really made\nsense, it\u2019s really hard because many times we drive by now where I used to live to see the\nchanges in the apartment house, and it\u2019s very easy to get lost. It\u2019s like a cul-de-sac, you\nknow, it\u2019s a circle. So that\u2019s how I met my husband and we went out dancing and I don\u2019t\nknow, the evening passed by so fast and I ask him now, I said, \u201cHow could you understand\nme, I couldn\u2019t even understand myself.\u201d He said, \u201cIt was very easy.\u201d I learned a little\nJewish, Yiddish and he knew a little Yiddish and some German and some English, we had a\nmarvelous time and we both like to dance. And we dated about a year and a half and we got\nmarried January the 16\", 1949, which is going to be 47 years, a long time. My brother said,\n\u201cTt won\u2019t last.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d He had nothing against Jake, he just said, \u201cNobody could\nlive with you any longer ten days to three weeks.\u201d",
        "Q: Why did he say that?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Why did he say that?",
        "A: You know how brothers and sister... he meant well, but he was so strict with me. Now\nyou wouldn\u2019t even listen to a brother, but at that trme you did. And I just listened to him.\nWhen I had a date, even before Jake, they had to come inside the house, they had to talk to\nhim, he had to look them over whether they were good enough for his sister. But I wasn\u2019t a\nchild, I already was 23, 22, 23 years old, but he just took it on himself like he was my father.\nLike I told him, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019re stricter on me like Dad would be.\u201d But then, after we got engaged\nSylvia Green 59\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 59\nand everything was all right, he said, \u201cOh well, it\u2019s not so bad. I\u2019m not losing a sister, I\ngained a bathroom.\u201d You know, one bathroom in an apartment, two bedrooms. And I had a\nproblem after the war, I took an awful lot of baths, we didn\u2019t have a shower, I just felt dirty,\nthree, four times a day, but everything turned out all right. They were kind of worried about\nme because all that time, you know, you had lice in the camps and you were itching and it\nwas terrible. And you were dirty all the time. And even if they gave you water, on purpose,\nthey would give you soap but never let you wash off the soap, they just dumped the water\noff, they got their kicks that way, I guess.

And I kind of feel bad, this was a\nblue dress and he had it tinted green. Because I got the picture and I thanked him so much\nfor it, I said, \u201cBernard,\u201d I said, \u201cThe dress was blue.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, 1t was green.\u201d I said,\n\u201cNo, it was blue.\u201d And he kind of felt bad about it, but I really shouldn\u2019t have told him that.",

        "A: I think I was about, in 1933, I think I was maybe about nine. And my mother said I was\nskinny.

This was custom made and he had short pants and long pants, but the short pants\nweren\u2019t real short, they come about, just up to the knees, a little above. And he\u2019s wearing his\ngymnasium cap and every year they would change the band, different colors. And this is my\nhandsome dad. And I think this picture must have been taken about \u201833 because in \u201836 my\nmother went to Poland and she had some modern suits.

I didn\u2019t work outdoors, they were my\nwhole life, my children, but I wanted to, I enjoyed it. And, well, they\u2019re wonderful, we love\nthem dearly, they love us dearly, but they got their own life. And... it was a good life. And\naltogether, the only thing, I thought well, everybody has to go through some kind of hell and\nI always thought, well, I been through it early in life and the rest of the life, I got smooth\nsailing.

But I\nwent to New York, I went to visit my brother, I went to Israel in \u201885 by myself, and that was\na highlight of my life because I always wanted to go to Israel when I was a member of the\nMizrachi, I was... at that time, I was going to Palestine and at the time I was five or six, and\nSylvia Green 63\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 63\nI was going to build it up single handed, I really was a Zionist.

        "A: Well, that moment, when the tanks, they were driving in, and the British were driving\nthe tanks, and somebody said, \u201cWe liberated, we liberated.\u201d But they had the German\nofficers standing up tied to the front. I said, \u201cWhat you talking about?\u201d I didn\u2019t even see\nthe British. All I saw is that, \u201cThere are the Germans, don\u2019t you see \u2018em?\u201d Then\nsomebody said, \u201cNo medals, look.\u201d And I stood up, and it is amazing that I had the\nenergy to stand up, before... because we had no food. We couldn\u2019t even venture out the\nbarracks, because if they saw somebody venturing out, you just took your life into your\nhand. They were digging ditches, they were going to blow up the camp. And, really all...\nwe all were in a semi-conscious state. And I remember I crawled out, I did not walk out. I\nSylvia Green 65\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 65\ncrawled on all four. And somehow, I had the energy, I don\u2019t know where it came from, I\nstood up, and I sang God... well, the British anthem, \u201cGod Save the King.\u201d I learned that\nin school. So, they were wonderful. I think the first thing they did, they took us to\ndelousing. This camp was just completely diseased. It was typhus and lice and any kind\nof disease you want was found in there. And so many piled up that\u2019s all... the, the, the\nones that died. And so they took us to delousing, and they gave us clean clothes. And\ndelousing usually was, with the German, too, you left your... you went in through one\ndoor, you, you, you walked in the nude in the shower, and then, after you came out, and\nthey sprayed you. So then they gave us a box of food. And it was like a ration. And I\nremember I ate everything in sight. I did not know what instant coffee was, and powdered\nmilk, and sardines and cigarettes, and chocolate. That whole thing was consumed in the,\nin the few minutes.",
        "Q: Did you get sick?",
        "A: I already was sick, I already had dysentery. I had diarrhea, everybody did. It is\namazing that it somehow blew over, because so many died, with all that rich food, and\nyour stomach conditioned to nothing, emptiness, you know. So, I don\u2019t know, I survived.",

        "Q: The British did?",
        "A: The British. That\u2019s that diseased camp, and they gave us the German barracks. We\nwere moved right away, this was the first thing. But they felt so bad. I mean, they meant\nwell when they brought us boxes and food, and our eyes popped, you know. But they did\nnot realize what it was going to happen to people. But they learned from this mistake,\nbecause whenever they have prisoners now, United State prisoners, they don\u2019t give them\nall that food, they just gave it to them gradually, and reconditioned them gradually.",

        "A: Well, she was, yeah, she had... she had typhus before I had typhus and I got it\nafterwards. When she had typhus, I still worked in the kitchen and I stole food, and I sent\nit in with a friend, through the barbed wires, because when I worked, I was not in the\nsame camp, it was divided. So she was probably in a semi-conscious state too, because\nwe had nothing there.",

And then he had to\ngo back and he couldn\u2019t come back with the ambulance, so he sent that ambulance, and\nregistered nurse, and he took us to Munich, and he rented an apartment for us. He didn\u2019t\nrent it, he evacuated some Germans, told them to get out.",
        "Q: Well, before we go to that, would you tell me a little bit more about what those\nmonths in Bergen-Belsen were like for you? Were you mainly just recovering your\nhealth, and... and resting, or what... what were you doing during those months?",
        "A: Do you know, that\u2019s a good question, what I did those months. We just went wild.\nAnd that\u2019s why they really didn\u2019t just open the... the concentration camp gates and say,\n\u201cGo.\u201d Because, probably we wouldn\u2019t have been responsible what... what we would\nhave done.

That was a cherry orchard, I don\u2019t know how many trees, full of trees. I\nhad no bag, all I could do was throw down what I could hold in my hand. Halina was\ndown and picking them up. So how much can you carry? He took the stepladder away,\nand I got stuck up on top. So, luckily, a Jeep, with British soldiers were driving by, and I\nyelled at them and told them ... I spoke a little English, I had about two years in school,\nand I told them what happened. Oh, he got so angry. He was cussing the German out, but\nthe German didn\u2019t understand English, so I translated everything for them, and he told\nhim to get that ladder, and no buts about it. And they waited till I had the ladder and I\ncame down and they said, \u201cMy God, how much could you carry in two hands?\u201d you\nknow. And they drove away. And that German really got me. He might have been about\nmaybe 60 - 65, and he said, \u201cHitler knew what he was doing. He should have killed you\nall. Look what you doing to us,\u201d you know. I got so mad, I took both hands and put it\naround his neck, and Halina said, \u201cDo it, do it, do it.\u201d And I pressed and I pressed and he\nwas getting kind of pale, and my hand, I had to let go, I couldn\u2019t do it.

        "A: They left, they left. Because he\u2019s, he knew I was safe and we had the few cherries, and\nthey left, and after they left, that\u2019s when the German start cussing us out, and we should\nhave been dead and Hitler knew what he was doing.

And then I was in Munich and\nmy brother in American Army, had some lovely friends. And everybody brought us food\nand they bought us clothes, and we really had a wonderful time in Munich.

My mother was a lovely lady, but I never knew... I thought she\nwas stuck up. And then, after my brother married, and I was married, and we had\nchildren, I told my brother, we sat down and we talked about the parents and I don\u2019t think\nwe had the same parents even. He remembered things I... which were not important to\nme. And I said, \u201cYou know Mom was stuck up. She had one friend. She knew other\npeople, but just one friend.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat you talking about? She was so shy.

And how he broke his leg, they were rounding up some people in the ghetto. Every\nso often they just picked up people and they... they\u2019d send them, probably, to Auschwitz,\nSylvia Green 73\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 73\nor Treblinka, somewheres. Well, they locked them in a room till they had the whole truck\nfull, and my dad jumped out the window. And that\u2019s how he broke his leg, and he was in\na makeshift hospital. And when they liquidated the ghetto, March the 13\", 1943, my first\ncousin, he was still alive at that time, was in the clean up crew, where they cleaned up the\nbodies, loaded it on trucks, and he told me that my dad was laying on the sidewalk, in the\nnude. Not just my dad, all the ones they killed. And looking back at that, I... I screamed,\nI cried. I didn\u2019t cry that they killed him, they took his pajamas off. This was the ultimate,\nthe worst thing could happen, I mean, didn\u2019t even leave the pajamas on. It\u2019s so... seems\nso degrading to me. So that\u2019s how...

        "A: No, no, no. They had a Holocaust reunion in Karlsruhe, 50 years after Crystal Day. I\ndid not know anything about, because I was the only survivor in this part of the country.\nAnd some people I knew in New York, they went, and I met one of them at one of the\nweddings I went to. And she said, \u201cWould you have gone? I feel bad. I should have\nnotified you, but I didn\u2019t think.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I would not have gone. I don\u2019t want to go\nthere.\u201d My brother went back. My brother was with Borden\u2019s export and import, and he\nwas in Europe a lot, so he was close by, and we had a friend, Fritz Oler. Before Hitler, he\nwas our friend, then he didn\u2019t know us, you know. So he wrote Fritzle a letter, and Fritz\nwrote him back and he said, \u201cI want you to come home with me, and we going to have\ndinner together, you meet my wife, you meet my children.\u201d And Bernard said wait a\nminute. He wrote him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to your home. Let\u2019s just meet at the neutral\nplace, in the park, or the depot, just somewheres.\u201d Because, too many hard feelings there.\nAnd they met, and Fritzle was happy, Bernard, he... Bernard wanted to make his peace\nwith Karlsruhe. So Fritzle was talking and Bernard was talking, and Fritzle said that his\nSylvia Green 76\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 76\nparents were still alive. Bernard jumped up, and walked away, didn\u2019t say good-bye or\nanything. He came back to the United States, Sarah my sister-in-law told me, he walked\ninto his home, went to the telephone, calling me, \u201cThere is no justice, there is no justice.\u201d\nFritz Oler... Fritz was like a brother, really. We were raised together, and my mother and\nFrau Oler were close friends. And then, when Hitler came to power, her husband became\na big wheel in the SS. And I was scared of the man. I don\u2019t know, I... how can you be\nthat close, and then all in a sudden looking at you like, \u201cI\u2019m going to come at you and kill\nyou?\u201d And I got the picture of... well, that\u2019s, the picture wouldn\u2019t help you, and I got...\nhere.

        "A: No, no, some of it were my brother\u2019s, but you see, we, we left Poland a month before\nthe war. My dad was deported to Poland in... see the dates. October, \u201838, and we had to\nleave Karlsruhe by August, \u201839. So we had the pictures. So, in Poland, my Aunt Mina\nSylvia Green 77\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 77\nhad a very good friend, we thought. She gave her silver to her, fur coat, her china, her\nlinen. And the linen, everything was hand monogrammed, even sheets were hand-\nmonogrammed, everything. And my aunt gave her everything and her pictures and my\npictures. So my Aunt Mina had the maid before the war, so after the war was over with,\nMina wrote to Yulche [ph], the maid, to go to the people and tell them that she was alive\nand then that Mina was going to call her or talk to her, how to ship that... her stuff here\nto the United States.

I do have the pictures.\u201d So, we were so thankful for\nthose pictures, because the other stuff was material things, you can live without it, but the\npictures, Mina... we really were happy. And a lot of those pictures are my Aunt Mina\u2019s.\nHave you ever seen a picture of her?",

I needed everything to survive, that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t have our period.

And he start talking about the Jews and how horrible, what\nthey doing in Munich. We were loud. We really were loud. I mean, you locked up... look,\neven an animal, you let an animal out, they gonna go wild, you know, you cooped up. We\nwere loud. We didn\u2019t bother anybody, but we were laughing loud, whatever we did,\ntalking loud. And I spoke German to him, with a Badenzer [ph] accent and he thought I\nwas Bernard\u2019s girlfriend. And, so finally he gave some medicine and I told him to get\nout, and I told him who I was. He didn\u2019t care. So that was after the war.",
        "Q: Did you get the, the impression in general that, that the Germans just didn\u2019t know\nSylvia Green 81\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 81\nwhat happened, or that they knew what happened and they didn\u2019t care?",
        "A: No, they knew, they didn\u2019t care, and it\u2019s convenient not to know. Don\u2019t tell me the\nlittle towns near Bergen-Belsen, the people didn\u2019t know what happened? What about\nAuschwitz? We had to walk a mile, they never let you out on the... in the main depot and\nit was always at night, wherever we went.

Because they took\nme in right away, they took to me. And Dolly, their daughter, said, \u201cIt\u2019s unfair, I have a\ncurfew on a date. Sylvia can go and she can stay out.\u201d She was jealous of me, you know.\nBut then, she didn\u2019t realize I was older. But they were, they were wonderful to the day\nthey died. I loved them dearly. And I still miss them, like Mother\u2019s Day, I always called\nthem. At that time, towards the end, they lived in Florida. From Lexington, moved to\nLouisville, from Louisville, in a condominium in Florida. And then, they had two\nSylvia Green 82\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 82\ncondominiums, next to each other, so there was somebody always could watch over\nthem, when they were older. And then they went into a small apartment, and they both\nsaid, \u201cYou know, we now where we started from.\u201d In a small apartment when they first\nwere married. But Mother\u2019s Day, birthdays, I always called them. And Leon was so hard\nof hearing and I just miss it. Rose always answered the telephone, and she would yell,\n\u201cLeon, Leon,\u201d you know. Took awhile for him to hear, but I miss that. And I always told\nthem, I said, \u201cMy God, you took such a chance, taking a stranger in.\u201d And they brought\nmy brother from England, too, in 1940, and Bernard was drafted in \u201841.",

They, I don\u2019t know, they were... after you were after 40,\nthey got a cabin, and we had bunkbeds, we were a whole lot in one room. And I met a lot\nSylvia Green 83\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 83\nof people, and we had a good time on the boat, so we had to entertain ourselves, because\nthis was not a luxury line, Marine Perch was just a ship. And there was one little room.\nBut we had fun. Like, I met a fellow on the boat, he drank a whole bottle of ketchup. Just\nshowing off, and laughing, you know, it\u2019s... I didn\u2019t think that far, till we got to New\nYork and somebody had to pick you up. It took us 11 days to come over, because they\nhad some mines, and all in a sudden we just stopped, but they didn\u2019t tell us why.

        "Q: Were you going for a high school diploma at Henry Clay?",
        "A: No, no, just to get the feel of the language, it\u2019s... the sound 1s so different, you know,\nit... do you speak languages? Any foreign languages? But the, the sound is different, and\nthe sentence construction in German and English, is just the opposite. When I first came,\nand I thought in German and had to translate it into English, it seemed like I always put\nthe cart before the horse, it seems like it. It just always lost something in the translation,\nor it was wrong.",
        "Q: What language did you speak to the Urbachs with?",
        "A: Well, she start teaching right away, like she said, \u201cSylvia, we going to set the table.\nThis is a plate, this is a napkin. Fork, spoon and knife.\u201d And then she would add\nsomething to it all the time.",
        "Q: She would always speak to you in English?",
        "A: Yeah.\nSylvia Green 90\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 90",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did she...",

        "Q: Tell me about what you thought of Lexington. What did you... what did it see... what\nkind of town was it? What...",
        "A: I loved Lexington. It was a small town. In \u201846, it had 65,000 people, and now it\u2019s\nbulging out in the seams, isn\u2019t it? People were very friendly. And then, Mina and I, we\nwere a novelty. I went... had to go to work in December, and I applied in factories, but\nthey wouldn\u2019t take me, because I didn\u2019t speak English. Times have changed. If it be now,\nyour language has nothing to do with it. But Dolly Urbach, that\u2019s Rose\u2019s daughter, she\nhad a friend, Phyllis Strauss, and her uncle and her mother were owners of Wolf Wile\u2019s,\ndowntown Lexington. I got a job there, in, wrapping packages, it was December *46.\nAnd I wasn\u2019t very happy, because I felt like it was demeaning. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not that\nstupid.\u201d Talked to myself. \u201cYou can do better than that.\u201d So I always sneaked out, and\ntried to wait on customers, and Joe said, \u201cCome on, Sylvia.\u201d He was very kind, he knew\nmy past. And that\u2019s why he gave me the job, also. And so, by April I was on the floor,\nwaiting on customers. And the first year, I had the most sale for the year, and the second\nyear the most sale. People were curious, so they waited for me. They...",
        "Q: They knew something about your, your background?",
        "A: Well, it was in the paper. Refugees, survivors, you know. I was the on... we were the\nonly ones in Lexington.\nSylvia Green 91\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 91",
        "Q: Did people come in and, and ask you about what had happened to you?",
        "A: No, not really. They just wanted to see me, like I was a novelty, and no, they didn\u2019t\nask. And I would not, not have been ready to talk what happened to me. It took years and\nyears before I was able to talk. I didn\u2019t talk about it until \u201883.",
        "Q: Were the customers... what, what kind of things were you selling there?",
        "A: It was a ladies\u2019 department store. It was more exclusive, and children\u2019s clothing and\nchina. It was like a department store.",
        "Q: Did you feel any... a sense of antisemitism from anyone in, in town, in Lexington,\nwhen you arrived?",
        "A: No. This 1s really strange. I found it more in Winchester than I did in Lexington.\nWhen I first married Jake, and they didn\u2019t even know about my past, because I had\nproblems enough. My children were different. So I, I didn\u2019t think... I didn\u2019t want to load\nthat on them, being a survivor, also. And this wasn\u2019t made public until \u201883, till I make a\ndocumentary, with Dr. Otis Singletary, he was the moderator, and three survivors and\ntwo liberators. So that was on television, then they found out. I don\u2019t know,\nWinchester... I changed my mind. I really don\u2019t know whether it was that much\nantisemitism, as it was ignorance, and also, they didn\u2019t like strangers. They wanted\nWinchester to stay a little town. They didn\u2019t like strangers, because I have talked to\npeople who came, and they were not Jews, and they had the same feeling, that they were\nnot treated right. And I said, \u201cI always thought they were anti-Semitic.\u201d But there were a\nSylvia Green 92\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 92\nlot of rich farmers here, who did not want industry, they tried to keep it out... keep them\nout, till they couldn\u2019t keep them out any more.",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t hear anything, any comment, comments about the Jews when you...",
        "A: In Lexington, no, no.",
        "Q: In Lexington, or in the... and did you, do you, did you have the sense that people\nknew what had happened during the war in Europe, what had happened to the Jews?",
        "A: We just never talked about it. I don\u2019t know, maybe I thought it would go away. I just\nwasn\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t even ready in \u201883, if not Marilyn Moosnick. She said, \u201cYou owe\nit, to do that.\u201d And I told her, I said, about the documentary, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\nmight cry.\u201d She said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not going to be on live, anyway.\u201d And the reason for it\nwas, that in \u201881, there was a history teacher at Tate\u2019s Creek High School, who said the\nHolocaust never happened, it was a war. So this, well, they were trying to do it in \u201881,\nand I wouldn\u2019t do it. And then, Dr. David Widstein approached me, and I said, \u201cDavid, I\ncan\u2019t do it, I might cry.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t cry with Dr. Singletary there,\u201d you\nknow. And so he dropped it. But then Marilyn took it in hand, and she used a lot of\npsychology on me, I guess.",
        "Q: Id like to talk more about that in a little while, but I... stick with the chronology\nmore and, and talk about right when you arrived in Lexington and, and some of those\nexperiences. Where did you, where did the Urbachs live, what neighborhood was that, or\nwhat was their address?\nSylvia Green 93\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 93",
        "A: They lived Fontaine Road, Chevy Chase area. They lived on Irvine Road, and my\nbrother was discharged from the Army in \u201886, September \u201986 [fn: 46]. He could have\nbeen discharged six months before, but he signed up as a civilian with the American\nArmy, so he wanted to make sure that Mina and I would be out of Germany. He was\nafraid that we didn\u2019t have enough pull or push or what. So then he was discharged in\nSeptember of \u201846, and we got an apartment. So we weren\u2019t that long with the Urbachs.\nWe came in June. July, August, September, about three months. They didn\u2019t want us to\nleave. They didn\u2019t think we were ready, but we wanted to be on our own. And we\nmanaged, believe it or not, on 90 dollars a month. That was my brother\u2019s Army pay. And\nthen, he would give private lesson, he spoke seven languages fluently, so he would give\nprivate lessons. And then he caught the flu and he couldn\u2019t get over it, and sometimes he\ndidn\u2019t get two or three hours of sleep at night. And he was very sick with that flu, and the\ndoctor said, \u201cSomething has to give. You have to take better care of you.\u201d And that\u2019s\nwhen Mina and I, we went to work.",
        "Q: Did Mina work at the same place?",
        "A: No, no. My Aunt Mina got acquainted with people who had a photo shop, sold\ncameras and tripods and bulbs and everything. And she developed pictures. And she was\nvery good at it, and she was a wonderful worker and they liked her so much, that my\nAunt Mina was sick with cancer for four years off and on, she would go back to work.\nAnd even if she didn\u2019t work, he paid her to the end, till she died. But she was a... a very\nSylvia Green 94\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 94\ndedicated worker. They went to England for a vacation and Mina ran the store. Very\nloyal.",
        "Q: Did you... did you develop ties with the Jewish community in Lexington in those\nearly days in the... did the Urbachs take you to synagogue with them?",
        "A: Yeah, the temple.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The temple. I wasn\u2019t too happy, but the... I was an atheist anyway. I come from a\nOrthodox home, but after the war I was an... an atheist. I blamed God for everything.\nAnd I did go to the temple with them, but somehow I didn\u2019t feel that comfortable,\nbecause I was used to seeing the men wearing yarmulkes, skullcaps, and at the temple, at\nthat time, the Rabbi Lewis, he was ultra, ultra, ultra Reformed, that if you wore a hat, you\ntook it off before you went inside. So, but I went, it was all right.",
        "Q: Was this Adath Israel, or... what was the temple?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Rabbi Adland. But he... he seems like he is more religious. And I really do think the\nReform is leaning towards... more to the Conservative, because they\u2019re having Bar\nMitzvahs now, which they used to not to have.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. You mentioned in the first interview, I\u2019m just going back a little bit\nto something that you mentioned, that, that in the early years of the war, when you were\nSylvia Green 95\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 95\nin Plaszow...",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Well, what happened was, I worked, and at that time we... we got the pretty good\nsoup, usually it was just one...",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: ...but 1t wasn\u2019t just cooked for us, because there were a lot Gentile working there too,\nin that factory. So, we got the same soup, but I wouldn\u2019t go and get it, because it was not\nkosher. So I went home and I dragged. And my dad said, \u201cDidn\u2019t they give you anything\nto eat?\u201d I said... we used to call him Papa, my dad. \u201cPapa, it\u2019s not kosher, I couldn\u2019t eat\nit.\u201d He said, \u201cYou have to eat it. It\u2019s a sin, it\u2019s almost like committing suicide. You have\nto eat to keep yourself alive.\u201d So, the second day, I ate, but it wouldn\u2019t stay down, it\ncame up quicker than | ate it. And so I came home and I dragged even worse. He said,\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I told him. He said, \u201cYou going to be all right.

        "Q:... of changing your diet again, back towards being kosher?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: We were not kosher in Lexington. We were lucky to buy a pound of hamburger a\nweek. Ate a lot of potatoes. So, no, even... the only reason I start keeping kosher is\nbecause Jake\u2019s father wouldn\u2019t eat at my place. And Jake even asked me, I mean, he\nknew about how I felt. And he said, \u201cYou want to keep kosher or not, that\u2019s up to you.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201calmost have to keep kosher, if not, your dad couldn\u2019t eat in our\nhouse, and that\u2019d be awful, you know.\u201d So I start keeping kosher, and I knew all about it,\nbecause I was raised that way. And then when you first start out, you just divide your\ndishes. It, it was simple.",
        "Q: Did you form \u2014 you, you mentioned that you were... that you were dating a little bit,\nbefore you met Jake?",
        "A: Yeah, but way before, when I first came, it wasn\u2019t single dates that much. People\ndidn\u2019t single date that much, it was group. And, like a group, I was running around with a\ngroup from the university, they have an organization, Hillel there. It\u2019s connected... I don\u2019t\nSylvia Green 97\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 97\nthink it\u2019s just a temple, I think it\u2019s just the Jewish children on the campus. And I went to\nparties, but 1t was mostly groups.

        "A: Well, I think I told you about the hand-me-downs, you know...",
        "Q: You just mentioned it, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, so I wore a hand-me-down, and the girl who gave it to me, her name was\nShirley, I will not mention the last name. She doesn\u2019t live here, she lives somewheres\nelse now. And out the blue sky, all happy, talking, dancing, and then the whole group, we\nwere to... having a Coke, or whatever it was, and she said, \u201cOh, you see Sylvia\u2019s dress?\u201d\nAnd they all looked, \u201cYes, what?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you remember I bought it last year, and I really\ndidn\u2019t like it, and I gave it to Sylvia.\u201d Now, how do you think a young girl feels?

        "Q: Mm, like you...",
        "A: So one of the guys, I... I know his name was Abie Guller [ph], because I met him in\nMunich, he was in American Army, and my brother knew him from Lexington. He said,\n\u201cShirley, I remember that dress when you wore it last year. It sure looked like hell on\nyou, but Sylvia looks beautiful.\u201d I want to hug and kiss him, which I didn\u2019t, you know.\nSo, that was not very pleasant. Now, some other... there\u2019s another girl, that Strauss, I told\nSylvia Green 99\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 99\nyou Phyllis. I audited some classes at the University Kentucky, I think it was two or three\ntimes in the morning, from eight till nine. I supposed to be at work at ten minutes to nine,\nbecause I had to take the mail around to different departments. But I talked to Joe Wile,\nmy boss, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d Well, Phyllis would pick me up before eight o\u2019clock,\ntake me to class, was waiting... she was going university at that time, too... was waiting\nfor me, and took me to work. And I told her that not long ago, about three years ago, she\nlives in Boca Raton, Florida now. But Jake passed away, she donated to the synagogue.\nMy brother passed away, she donated to the synagogue. I said, \u201cYou know, you were\nsomething.\u201d I said, \u201cYou picked me up,\u201d she said, \u201cSylvia, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d So she\nsaid, \u201cSo it was not that big a deal.\u201d She said, \u201cIf I would have had classes, it\u2019d be a\ndifferent story. Evidently, I didn\u2019t have classes, so I was glad to do it.\u201d So, not everybody\nis bad, not everybody 1s good, you know. All kinds of people in this world.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you interact at all with non-Jews in the community? With Gentiles in\nLexington?",
        "A: Girls, yes. I went out to lunch when I worked at Wolf Wile\u2019s, and they ate out every\nday, but I couldn\u2019t afford it. I only could eat out once a week, because the money I made\nand my... my aunt and my brother, we all pooled together. And they figured out I could\neat out once a week. So I went with them, ate out. But I went, and I had the sandwich\nwith me, and I went to restaurants with them, and they let me eat my sandwich and had a\nglass of water. I don\u2019t know whether I drank coffee at that time, or not, or milk, and paid\nSylvia Green 100\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 100\nfor that. But they didn\u2019t object, the restaurants. They knew. Yeah, I met some nice\npeople. Dating, no, not much.",
        "Q: How long had you been in Lexington before you met Jake?",
        "A: I met Jake in \u201847. I think it was September \u201847. His cousin lived a half a block from\nus, Martha Steinberg. And Mina, my aunt Mina and Martha got very close. And\nnaturally then, I was close. And she always said, \u201cI have a cousin, a first cousin.\u201d Jake\nand Martha were more like brothers and sisters, because when Jake\u2019s mother died, Jake\nwent to live with Martha and her parents, so he could say special prayers in the\nsynagogue. It\u2019s called kaddish and you need ten men, at that time. Now women count,\ntoo. And so, they felt more like brothers and sisters. And I told her, I said, \u201cWell, ?'m\ngoing with that fellow in New York.\u201d And she was just after me and after me, so George\nand I had an understanding that we were going to date other people, since we were that\nfar apart, to learn about the American way. And, so the first night we went out, he took\nme dancing, we had a marvelous time. I always said, \u201cHow could you understand me?\u201d\nWe spoke... spoke some German, some little Yiddish, sounds like German, he understood\nYiddish. And then English. He said he understood me very well. So, 1t was September\n\u201847, and we married January the 16, 49.",
        "Q: Did he... did he ask you about your experiences during the war, or did you talk to him\nabout it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that... I don\u2019t remember, but I don\u2019t think I talked... we talked about it\nSylvia Green 101\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 101\nwhen we dated. I don\u2019t think so. But after we were married, we wanted children pretty\nsoon, because he was 34, I was 24, and when I got pregnant with Jerry, that was when\nthe nightmares started. And he would come with dry, clean pajamas and a towel, and he\nsponged me off with a washcloth. He changed the sheets, it just went through. The\nnightmare was the German came to take my baby away and kill it, because I saw many\nbabies killed and they did not use bullets, they just threw them against the wall, because\nthey couldn\u2019t waste bullets. So, that\u2019s when we talked, usually after I got... he got me all\ndried off and everything, we would sit on the couch in the living room, and many nights\nwe never went back to sleep, and he didn\u2019t either. And all the time I lived with that man,\nhe never complained. He didn\u2019t let me sleep, because it was even later on at times, I\nneeded to talk. His ear was always there. One time I told him, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know\nwhether you\u2019re listening, but your ear is there.\u201d I just needed the ear, you know. No, he\nwas... he was a good soul, he really was. I was fortunate.",

        "A: I\u2019m already... We got married in Laurel, we were without a rabbi, and my brother\nBernard paid for the wedding. We had a sit-down dinner, just immediate family. And he\npaid 300 dollars, and was kosher. And the rabbi performed, it was my brother\u2019s friend,\nand he hired a cantor. And I got married in a suit. I could have bought... I only could get\na wedding dress or a suit, and I was very practical and I got the suit, which I wore years\nafterwards. I\u2019ve got pictures, I got wedding pictures, I show you later on. You see, Jake\nSylvia Green 102\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 102\nwas a large family. There were... there were four children, and their wives, and his nieces\nand nephews. And Urbachs, Rose and Leon, and Grandma, Rose\u2019s mother, and my Aunt\nMina, so it was... was a crowd. But he paid for it.",
        "Q: Had Jake been in this area for a long time, his family?",

And he was raised on top of tobacco cotton. They had those like\nbales, you know, rolled up. That\u2019s where... where... where they raised him, right on top of\nthe... the tobacco cotton. It\u2019s a miracle he didn\u2019t fall off.",
        "Q: And did Jake carry on in that business then? Was he working in the family business?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. His sister was also. What happened was, he graduated from\nUniversity Kentucky, in \u201836, and he couldn\u2019t get a job. So he just fell in there, and then\nhe was too lazy to get out. So, he just stayed in there. He always said, \u201cWe never going to\nbe rich.

        "A: Yes, what I probably was trying to say is, we in the camps talked about somebody had\nto stay alive, to tell the world what was going on in Europe. We thought the world didn\u2019t\nknow.

That that ship came with the Jewish people and they wouldn\u2019t let it in, and they\nsent it back, they got all killed. This was very upsetting.

        "A: And there was a very important rabbi who went to Washington to tell Roosevelt about\nwhat was going on. And at that time, Bernard Baruch was advisor to Roosevelt. I don\u2019t\nknow what they talked about, I, I just wonder sometimes. But one person cannot do\nanything.",
        "Q: Did you feel... so you didn\u2019t feel that the American people bore any kind of\nresponsibility?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s... most of the time, the way I see things now, the people have nothing to do\nwith it, it\u2019s the head of the government. The average person wants exactly the same thing.\nYou want the family, you want your children, you want a roof over your head. You want\nto be able to have enough money to send them to college, so they make something out of\nthemself. That\u2019s what the average citizen wants. And all along in history, it was always\nthe heads of the government who started the problems. Maybe if they would start fighting\neach other, maybe this would stop. That\u2019s wishful thinking, right? Silly? Is that silly?",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s funny to imagine a fistfight between Clinton and Milosevic or something.",
        "A: It\u2019s not... huh? It wouldn\u2019t be fistfights, believe me. It\u2019d be more.\nSylvia Green 105\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 105",
        "Q: So, did you feel angry, back then, when... after you arrived in the States? You said\nyou felt angry while you were in Germany.",
        "A: I was angry, I was angry, I was angry for 12 years. I was angry. We had a large family\nand it was so wonderful, cousins were like brothers and sisters. You know, you didn\u2019t\nhave anybody. Like, when my son was Bar Mitzvah, Jake had a large family that came\nfrom all over. I had nobody. My aunt already had cancer, she was in a wheelchair, and\nshe didn\u2019t want to come to the synagogue. We were going to hire somebody and she said\nif she can\u2019t walk on her own two feet, she didn\u2019t want to go. So I called Urbachs, I said,\n\u201cYou have to come.\u201d And they came. I said, \u201cI have to have somebody on my side.\u201d\nBecause it makes you feel pretty much alone.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, would you say again what event that was? I missed it...",
        "A: My son\u2019s Bar Mitzvah. My brother was out the country. My sister-in-law had two\nlittle kids, so she couldn\u2019t come, because Bernard was out the country. So, but they came,\nUrbachs came. They were there for me.",
        "Q: Can you talk more about the time that you were pregnant and you started to have these\nnightmares and it was like the floodgates were opening. What were your feelings about...\ndid other feel-feelings, memories come back to you? Was it... Did it change the way that\nyou...",
        "A: No, it was always when I was pregnant, it was all the time the same.",
        "Q: Okay.\nSylvia Green 106\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 106",
        "A: They were trying to catch me, they were going to take my baby away.",
        "Q: Did having... having the baby change that?",
        "A: Yeah, it got better. I mean, they weren\u2019t constant, the nightmare, they only were once\nin awhile and then later on, with Sandy, it got less and less.",
        "Q: When was your son born?",
        "A: My son was born June, 1950, and Sandy was born December \u201854.",
        "Q: And your son\u2019s name?",
        "A: Jerry. Jerry Walden Green. And my daughter\u2019s name was Sandra Ann Green\nZuckerman.",
        "Q: Zuckerman now.",
        "A: Zuckerman now, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me something about... about each of them? Tell me something about your\nson, first.",
        "A: Never gave us any trouble. We didn\u2019t agree on everything, you know, but I don\u2019t\nknow, if I look at the children now, I don\u2019t think I could raise them now. I mean they...\nthey\u2019re such different children. He was one of the good guys, he didn\u2019t experiment with\ndrugs, he didn\u2019t smoke. He...studies were very important, he wanted to make good\ngrades to get out of Winchester. And that was, I think, our doing. We wanted him out of\nhere. There wasn\u2019t much for him to do. He took, he got a degree in Political Science, and\nHistory. Undergraduate degree. And then he was turned against it. There was somebody\nSylvia Green 107\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 107\nworking in Frankfort, who made appointments with him to come, he could help him and\nhe would go there two, three times and the man wasn\u2019t there. So he got very upset over\nthat. And then he met a girl at IU, and they were dating for awhile, and then they decided\nhe was going into social work. And he went to Indianapolis. He got an undergraduate\ndegree from IU, he went to Indianapolis and got the Masters in social work. And first he\nworked for the Catholic service in Indianapolis, but now he\u2019s been with the Methodist\nHospital now, for about 18 or 19 years, or maybe getting closer to 20. But he said he had\nto get out of Kentucky because social workers were underpaid, that he makes a lot more\nmoney.",
        "Q: And he\u2019s married?",
        "A: He is married. They married in \u201875. She\u2019s a occupational therapist, and they adopted\nthree Korean children at different times. Jenna is 13, and Cara, she\u2019s beautiful, the\nmiddle one, and Cara is 11. And Lindsey is going to be seven. And that\u2019s the one who\nhas cerebral palsy. But she doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s handicapped. She\u2019s very bright, she gets\nspeech lessons. And it\u2019s so much easier to understand her now, over the telephone. The\ntrouble was... Jerry explained it to me, because she kept her mouth too wide open, and\nshe was drooling all the time, and they teach her now to close her mouth, not that wide\nopen. And she drools less, that way you can understand her. About three years ago, she\nwas in a body cast for six weeks. And all the bedrooms in this house are upstairs, so they\nbrought the, her mattress down and she was in the rec room for six weeks. They had to\nSylvia Green 108\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 108\ncarry her around. She got spoiled, but she never complained. But if she called you, she\nwanted you there. And the teachers say she is very bright. She just going to finish the\nfirst grade. And she makes pretty good grades. Eventually she will need some more\nsurgery. They had to operate on her, if not, the hip would have gone out. You see, the\nknee hit the other knee. So now, the other knee 1s doing the same thing, but the\npediatrician or... or the... the... the surgeon keep... keep a track on it. It has to be a certain\ndegree before they want to operate. If not, the other hip would go out.",
        "Q: So tell me something about your daughter now.",
        "A: My daughter? Oh gosh. I don\u2019t think I could have made it without her. She\u2019s such a\nwarm person and she worries about me a lot. Like when I was sick, I told you I had the\nflu, she called three times a day. And we almost talk almost every day. And if I get out of\nhere, P\u2019ll move to Chattanooga.",
        "Q: It sounds as if she\u2019s helped you just by being sympathetic and understanding what\nyour experiences have been.",
        "A: Yeah, that... the camps, no I mean, even now, I mean, I lost Jake. I never could have\ndone it without her. Both children were wonderful. They came and they stayed. Jerry\nstayed eight days, he had to go back to work. And Sandy stayed ten days, and she had to\ngo... She just works, teaches, at the community college, part time, because with Jay, I told\nyou, her husband is so busy. And many times he has to get up middle in the night, and\nhas to go in if the people can\u2019t work out the problems, then they call the boss, and he has\nSylvia Green 109\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 109\nto go in. And the irony is, he didn\u2019t want to go into medicine, because his father is a\npediatrician and years ago, when his children were sick, everybody else\u2019s children were\nsick, and Larry\u2019s mother used to call him, come on home, Larry is sick, or Janet was sick,\nthe daughter. And he said, \u201cGive them an aspirin, I\u2019Il be there in, in ten, 15 minutes,\u201d and\nsometimes it was hours and hours. So he just didn\u2019t want to become a doctor, but now\nwith the doctors it\u2019s different, they cover for each other. I mean, I see it in the hospital\nhere, they... is your back bothering you?",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Let me sit there for awhile, and you won\u2019t feel... that be softer.",
        "Q: No, no, it\u2019s fine, really I\u2019m fine.",
        "A: So, now with the computer, he\u2019s called out at night. The doctors only go when they on\ncall that night. Isn\u2019t life funny? It\u2019s ironic.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. She\u2019s got how many...",
        "A: One son.",
        "Q: One son.",
        "A: 15, who thinks he\u2019s 25. Last time she came, I said, \u201cSandy, you didn\u2019t bring my\ngrandson.\u201d He always was so agreeable, \u201cYes, Bubby, yes, Bubby.\u201d Now I say black, he\nsays white. So I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring my grandson.\u201d She said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the way\nit\u2019s going to be till 21, get used to it.\u201d If I live that long.",
        "Q: When... did you talk to your kids about your experiences during the Holocaust?\nSylvia Green 110\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 110",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did they ask you?",
        "A: No. Sandy says it came out a little bit. She said, \u201cWe knew more than you think.\u201d I\nnever talked to them about. They were Jews in the little... little town. And, like I told you\nabout Jerry, Sandy was the same. Grades was important get out of here, and they both\ndid. Now, when I complain, Sandy will say, \u201cMommy, you pushed us out.\u201d I said, \u201cWell,\nthere was nothing for you to do here,\u201d you know. Sandy was the only Jewish child in the\nschool system, the only Jewish child in high school, and she had a stupid teacher,\nhomeroom teacher, who... 1t was before Christmas, said one morning, \u201cI was driving up\nand down Boone Avenue, all the houses were decorated for Christmas beautifully, except\nSandy\u2019s house. Let\u2019s take up a collection.\u201d How do you think she felt? She came home\nand she cried, you know. Stupid teacher, he knew why. He thought he was funny. I don\u2019t\nknow. He was crazy, anyway. And then she was... well, if they would have had\nvaledictorian, she was the valedictorian, she got the junior cup. All A\u2019s, from the first\ngrade on. And the minister\u2019s son came up to her, \u201cI would love to date you, but my father\nwould kill me.\u201d So she came home and she cried, and I laughed, and I said to her, \u201cWell,\nI wouldn\u2019t be so happy about it either,\u201d you know. What you going to say?",
        "Q: How did you... what did... how did you convey Jewish culture to them, or a sense of...\nof heritage and history?\nSylvia Green 111\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 111",
        "A: They are not as Orthodox... well, I\u2019m not Orthodox, but not observant like I am. We\ntook them to the synagogue, we took them to Sunday school, we took them to Hebrew\nschool, and that was about the best we could do.",
        "Q: When did you...",
        "A: And I observed, I kept kosher. Friday night the candles were lit. Every holiday was a\nholiday. Passover, we always had college students. We never were less than 14,\nsometimes 20 people, sometimes 11 people. So what else could I have done? I mean, you\ncome to a point that they have to do it themselves. And I thought they had enough\nbackground. Sandy later belonged to a Conservative synagogue, but they only go on\nHigh Holidays and I think a lot... the rabbi has a lot to do with it. They had the rabbi,\nthat\u2019s why they joined it, he was wonderful. He was great with young people. They...\nthey went all the time, but this one, he\u2019s such a bore. The first time I went down there,\nand they were walking around... I don\u2019t know, have you ever... were you ever at services,\nJewish services, when they walk around with the Torah, and you kiss the Torah? He was\nwalking around, he didn\u2019t carry a Torah, and he was shaking hands, and I had my hand\nout. And I said, \u201cRabbi, I\u2019m Sandy\u2019s daughter,\u201d... I mean, mother, \u201cSandy is my\ndaughter.\u201d And he said, \u201cOh.\u201d And then I went... Oh, I went a lot last year. And I even\nwould go more, but I won\u2019t drive, and I have to fly, and Sandy\u2019s been paying for the\nflight for me to get there, and so I want to kind of slow down on that. She\u2019s going to have\na son going to college soon. So, whenever... everywhere I am, I go to Saturday morning\nSylvia Green 112\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 112\nservices, because I always say I\u2019m a reborn Jew, I was Bat Mitzvah 11 years ago,\nbecause women couldn\u2019t participate when I was a child. So we went to the synagogue, he\nshould know me, nothing. Not, \u201cOh, it\u2019s good you\u2019re visiting again,\u201d or something. How\nabout stopping a minute?\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: How 1s it going, all right?",
        "Q: Yeah. This is tape two, side B, of an interview with Sylvia Green. You were just\ntalking about your synagogue and... and I wondered when you started to be religious\nagain, and when you joined a synagogue, and what synagogue you joined?",
        "A: No, no. We joined the synagogue as soon as we were married, Ohavay Zion. Jake\u2019s\nfather was one of the founders of that synagogue. So, as soon as we got married, there\nwas no question about it. We have been members for 50 years.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, that\u2019s the Conservative synagogue in Lexington?",
        "A: That\u2019s the Conservative synagogue on Alumni Drive, but that used to be on Maxwell\nStreet, where Joe Bologna is in, the pizza place.",
        "Q: Okay. How did it feel, did you start to recover a sense of faith, or feeling...",
        "A: It\u2019s...",
        "Q: ...or were you still an atheist, just going to synagogue, or how did that... what was\nhappening?\nSylvia Green 113\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 113",
        "A: Do you know Jake... I don\u2019t know how it happened, when it happened, it was so\ngradual, but it happened a lot more since I can participate. And when I was Bat Mitzvah,\nthere were two other young girls. I\u2019m the only old woman who was Bat Mitzvah, and I\ndon\u2019t know whether I did it as much out of religion, as I was... I think I was jealous of\nmy brother, as a child. All that attention and all the gifts. And here, I knew every speech,\nI knew his Torah reading, I knew his Haftorah reading, I knew his speech by heart, as\nwell as he did. And they made such a big deal over him. So, I don\u2019t know, in my speech\n11 years ago, I said, \u201cYou probably are asking why I\u2019m doing this now. I raised my\nchildren in a kosher home, in the Jewish religion, to the best I could. I don\u2019t know\nwhether that has anything to do with the religion, I am Bat Mitzvah, or it was jealousy. I\nhad to prove to myself I could do it.\u201d That was my speech. And I said, \u201cI doed it.\u201d But, it\nwas a lucky thing, because it helped me a lot in... after Jake died. The people are\nwonderful, they... I\u2019m almost the oldest one there, and they\u2019re all young couples, so \u2019ma\ngrandmother. And then, after Jake died, they came for a whole week here, just saying\nprayers. And you only need ten people to say prayers. Now women count, too, men and\nwomen. Sometimes we had up to 30 here, because they wanted to come. And if I don\u2019t go\non a Saturday, I miss it. I go every Saturday, even we had the little bit of snow, and they\ngot mad at me after I walked in. \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t be here, maybe you shouldn\u2019t\nbe out.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s supposed to have melted by the time I drove home.\u201d But I miss\nit, and I feel like this is my family. And in fact, I think I told you, last Saturday, they\nSylvia Green 114\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 114\ncalled me up to say a special prayer, before you read the Torah, or was it between you\nread the Torah, and I cried, I couldn\u2019t help it. And, so the one who read the Torah raf, he\nsaid, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Sylvia?\u201d And I said, \u201cI feel so alone.\u201d Yeah, they were wishing\nme a happy birthday and clapping, and in Hebrew, congratulations, you know. And so, I\ndon\u2019t know, I just looked around, there was no... I mean, there were people there, but I\nwas alone. And I told the Torahfa, he said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? We are your\nfamily.\u201d That was sweet. And it helped.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s good.",
        "A: But then I was still teary eyed, because that Monday I spoke in Louisville. I told you,\nit takes me forever to get back to normal. So, I\u2019m just the happiest when people leave me\nalone and I go about my volunteering, or... or just not think about it, I do the best.",
        "Q: Did your... I\u2019m jumping around a little bit, but I remembered another question about\nyour kids. Did they ever ask you about their grandparents, what... I mean did they try to\nfind out what had happened to their...",
        "A: Well, my grandmother died. There were ten living children, my grandmother died on\nmy mother\u2019s side when she was 47 years old. Every year there was a child, stillborn. I\nhad a very active grandfather. Or... stillborn, miscarriage, and only the strong survived\nand ten survived and she died. I\u2019m named after her. Sarah was her name. My Bible name\nis Sarah. So they knew about that, and my mother\u2019s... my dad\u2019s mother, she died... let\u2019s\nsee, there was, the war broke out in \u201839, she died around that time. The war already broke\nSylvia Green 115\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 115\nout, but it was at the beginning and thank God, the way she died, it was Passover, and she\nchoked on a piece of matzo, and the whole thing was not even a split second. She must\nhave been a hundred. And can you imagine how frightened she would have been in the\ncattle wagon? So this was really a blessing. So my children did not have a grandmother,\nbecause Jake\u2019s mother died when he was nine, and my parents got killed. So that\u2019s why I\nam a Bubby. \u201cBubby\u2019 is \u2018Grandmother\u2019 in eastern Europe. So, when Sandy was pregnant\nwith Jay, she asked me whether it be all right, she never had a Bubby, whether Jay can\ncall me Bubby. The other grandmother did not want to be called Bubby, she wanted to be\ncalled Grandmama. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, if he doesn\u2019t call me... if your baby, my\ngrandchild doesn\u2019t call me anything worse, Bubby is fine.\u201d So I\u2019m still Bubby. But he\ntells me if he talks about his Bubby to his friends, I\u2019m his grandmother, not Bubby.",
        "Q: So your, your own children really didn\u2019t try to find out...",
        "A: No, it isn\u2019t that... no, no, it...",
        "Q: So the information...",
        "A: They were busy. They were busy, they, they, they always had the working time, the\nschoolwork, and then, and Sandy was a girl scout, they took piano lessons. And Jerry was\na boy scout, he took piano lessons, he was on the Little League and they were busy. And\nit was good for them, and then both went to work. Jerry went to work at Kroger\u2019s when\nhe was 16, sacking groceries. One time I walk in, Jerry was washing the floor. I said,\n\u2018Jerry,\u2019 somebody dropped a watermelon. I said, \u201cHow come you don\u2019t do this at\nSylvia Green 116\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 116\nhome?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t get paid. Here I get paid.\u201d He worked for Kroger\u2019s when he\nwent away to college. Now, he never worked during a week, in high school, just on\nweekends, because the manager ask him, \u201cI need somebody during the week,\u201d and he\nsaid, \u201cMr. Hazelwick, I want to work, but this would defeat the purpose. I want to save\nmoney so I can go to college. If I don\u2019t make the grades, then I wouldn\u2019t be accepted.\u201d\nAnd he liked his honesty, and he hired him. So when Jerry came home Christmas, and\nduring the summer he worked at Kroger\u2019s till he graduated from college, and he saved\nenough money up to buy his own car. And Sandy worked at IGA as a checker, and she\nworked from the time she was 16. And she worked the graveyard shift, till 12 o\u2019clock,\nJake was waiting for her. If that be now, I wouldn\u2019t let her work the graveyard shift. Be\ntoo dangerous.",
        "Q: Did you move to Winchester right after you got married?",

        "A: 1949. Papa let us live in the house. There were two little houses, so he let us live in\nthe house, so it already was painted, and we just moved in. And then he gave us the\nhouse.",
        "Q: This house?",
        "A: No, no. This house we bought. It was a very small house and we... it was a one-\nbedroom house, and then, when I was pregnant with Sandy, we added on another\nSylvia Green 117\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 117\nbedroom, and another bathroom, but then we outgrew it again, because I had to separate\nthe kids, so we bought this house. We been living here since... we bought the house in\n\u201865. I think we moved in \u201866, because we had it all fixed up before we moved in. Painted\nand repairs and everything.",

So I stayed till after Christmas, and then they had the sale, and\nhe ask me to stay one more day and then every time I went in there, he wanted me to\ncome back and work. And I said, \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cWe had an agreement, Jake and I, that I\nwouldn\u2019t work.\u201d I was the good Hausfrau.",
        "Q: Did... was that fine with you?",

I was\nborn and raised in Germany, but my father was a Polish citizen, and they would... your\nnationality was what your father\u2019s nationality was. So, in Germany, I was a Polack. Then,\nafter we lived in Poland, I was a German. So I never had a country to call my own, and\nthis was a very happy moment. I could have done it earlier, I could have done it in three\nyears, but Jake thought it was better, because Jerry already was a little older. And I did\ngood, I... I passed, I had no problems. At that time, I still had a good memory.",

        "A: I felt like an American, but I was very upset with the judge. There were a lot of\nGermans who married American soldiers, they became citizens. There was a girl from\nPoland, the American fellow she married, he said he owned a newspaper in the United\nStates, and then when she came here, she found out he was a newspaper boy, delivered\npapers. And, well, they called you up there, and you sat in front, facing the... oh, I\u2019m\nsorry... facing the people, you know, I told you I talk with my hands.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Facing the people, and all in a sudden, he said, \u201cI notice here, you were incarcerated.\nWhat were you incarcerated for?\u201d And that\u2019s all it took. I start crying and screaming.\nSylvia Green 119\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 119\nJake said you could hear me in the back row. The only crime I ever committed was I was\nborn to Jewish parents.",
        "Q: Did you tell him that?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I told him. The amazing part was he just... you know, was mind-boggling\nto me. And there were German frduleins there... I mean frau marrying Americans, and he\ntalked so nice to them, you know. That really... Judge Ford, he\u2019s dead, may he rest in\npeace! No, this was very upsetting to me.",
        "Q: What did he say in response to that?",
        "A: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Nobody heard him. I did. I don\u2019t know, we have a friend here, a lawyer, and he was\none of my witnesses, and another friend, a neighbor, Margaret Walden, she was one of\nmy witnesses, too. Mike said he just wanted to kind of show off, you know. But I\nscreamed, I really did. And that was the only crime I committed.",
        "Q: Did you feel safe in this country?",
        "A: Yeah. I felt very safe, yes.",
        "Q: And did you feel at home in Kentucky?",
        "A: Well, that was the only state I knew, I mean, I would go to New York, where my\nbrother was, or New Jersey, to visit, but I only lived in Kentucky. I lived in Lexington till\nI married, and then I came here, and I always lived in Winchester. I been to Israel just\nSylvia Green 120\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 120\none time. In \u201885, that was the only time I left the country. And I\u2019m glad I did, because\nnow I don\u2019t think I could take the trip.",
        "Q: What did... did you, when you would visit New York, for example, did you, did you\nmeet people who had stereotypes about Kentucky, and what... and ask you, \u201cWhy do you\nlive there, are there any Jews there,\u201d or anything like that?",
        "A: No, no, the funny part was, I had a silk blouse, that was the style, and written Sylvia\nall over, handwritten on it. I think Pll show you a picture later on, I think I got\nenlargement there. And I was visiting my cousin for two weeks every summer, till I got\nmarried. And well, one week they could take off, the other week they couldn\u2019t take off,\nso I waited for them when they came home from work. And I wore that blouse, and a guy\npassed by and he looked, \u201cHi Sylvia, how are you?\u201d I says, \u201cDo I know you? I never met\nyou.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, you know me.\u201d You know. Then he start kind of laughing, then I look\ndown, and I saw it. And so I laughed, I said, \u201cOh, you tricked me, I forgot I wore the\nblouse with my name on there.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not a New Yorker.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m\nfrom Kentucky.\u201d And he said, \u201cI noticed the different accent.\u201d Oh, that is funny, isn\u2019t 1t?\nOh gosh.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the only time that you came up against a stereotype of, of... about Kentucky,\nOr...",
        "A: Well, no, no, I... why, do people have?",
        "Q: Yeah, like...\nSylvia Green 121\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 121",
        "A: They don\u2019t respect people from Kentucky, or what?",
        "Q: Well, they might think...",
        "A: We\u2019re hicks.",
        "Q: ...1t\u2019s just a place where there are hillbillies, and what, you know...",
        "A: Oh, about that, listen. I had a cousin, he\u2019s gone now, cousin Harry, and that\u2019s the ones\nI stayed with when I first came to the United State, and spent one week in New York.\nAbout a couple months after we were settled, I think we still lived with Urbachs, so it\nwas about a couple months, he came to visit. He came because he was worried. He heard\nthat in Kentucky people don\u2019t wear shoes, and they don\u2019t have many Jews, and he wanted\nto see it with his own eyes, and... and to take me back to New York. I thought it was\nvery thoughtful, and very sweet, just the cousin who I met, you know. So, he fell in love\nwith Kentucky, but he wouldn\u2019t move to Kentucky, but he thought it was such a quiet\nlife. When 65,000 people were in Lexington. And, he wouldn\u2019t give up New York, so...",
        "Q: You\u2019ve seen Lexington change a lot over the years, I imagine.",
        "A: Oh my God, yes.",
        "Q: Can you kind of describe how, how that\u2019s... how you\u2019ve seen it change?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve seen the change... I think I told you, I don\u2019t know, I just got my license,\ndriver\u2019s license when I was 68. This is... in May it\u2019s going to be seven years. And if not\nmy friends here. He took me out for three months, every day. So, I remember when I\ncame to Lexington, people drove cars, but there were not many cars. And if you were\nSylvia Green 122\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 122\ndriving, they would stop, \u201cGo on, go on.\u201d Now, since I drive myself, they... they try to\nbeat you to the stop light. It\u2019s a lot of change in... it\u2019s kind of overgrown, I think. Look\nwhat\u2019s going on in Anita Madden\u2019s... that shopping center she has, the mall. I don\u2019t\nknow, I mean, it\u2019s just overgrown. Whenever they have a new shopping mall, people\nmove out from a different place, and move there. I, I just wonder, how many shopping\nmalls do you need?",
        "Q: It never... it seems like...",
        "A: How many restaurants?",
        "Q: ...never enough.",
        "A: Never enough 1s right.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you first voted?",
        "A: Oh, yes. As soon as I became a citizen. And I was very nervous. I think in that old\ntape, I think, as I recall, I spoke about that Monday, a week ago. When we had to report\nto the police station, that we had to leave the country, and my mother was sick and she\nsent me instead, and as he called my mother\u2019s name and I told him my mother was sick,\nthe policeman, he yelled at me to come forward, but he yelled so loud that I was shaking\nfrom head to toe. And then he took the... and I couldn\u2019t hold the pencil or pen, whatever\nit was, in my hand, and I dropped it. And I don\u2019t know, he seemed to be satisfied, maybe\nI put the \u2018X\u2019 down there, I don\u2019t know. Ever since then, any kind of legal, took a long\ntime to overcome. Because I remember when I needed a Social Security number, it took\nSylvia Green 123\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 123\nme three hours to get enough nerve to go in there. And Rose said, \u201cNo, you have to do it\nyourself.\u201d She wanted me to do things for myself, it\u2019s so much easier to let somebody\nelse do the things, but she wanted me to learn to be independent. Took three hours. So the\nfirst time I voted, just... you have to sign your name and it was going pretty shaky. It\ntook years. Doesn\u2019t bother me any more now, but I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think I ever\nmissed an occasion, not to vote.",
        "Q: Did you learn about Kentucky history, or... was it in, of interest to you to...",
        "A: [Indecipherable] a lot, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: ...to feel part of that, that history, or that you were...",
        "A: I am not part of that history, I am part of the history way up there. You know what I\u2019m\ntalking about, Germany, Poland, ghetto, concentration camps. But I like Kentucky, and I\nwas happy in Kentucky. And I will have to leave Kentucky. There\u2019Il be a time I won\u2019t be\nable take care of myself, then I have to leave.",

        "A: It\u2019s not... the children are nice, Jerry and Marcia, they\u2019re nice kids, but it\u2019s different.\nA daughter is a daughter all, all your life, a son is a son till he takes a wife. She\u2019s a nice\ngirl, she\u2019s good for him. But she has more ties with her family. But her mother died just\ntwo weeks before Jake died. And the father has had cancer now for six, seven years, and\nSylvia Green 124\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 124\nit\u2019s lung cancer. And he\u2019s doing okay. He went back to Czechoslovakia for two weeks.\nHe takes chemotherapy for three weeks and radiation for three weeks, and he\u2019s still here,\nit\u2019s amazing.",
        "Q: Will you tell me about when... you, you mentioned a little earlier about how there was\nsomething that happened in 1981, where a teacher had said that, that there was no\nHolocaust...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: ...and that that caused a reaction here.",
        "A: A history, yes.",
        "Q: And, and caused that documentary...",
        "A: Among the Jewish... not in Winchester, in Lexington, among the Jewish people.",
        "Q: Tell me about that, what happened and, and your involvement, and, and the\ndocumentary.",
        "A: Well, my involvement, it was no involvement, they just got in touch with me and\nDavid, I don\u2019t know whether he already talked to Dr. Otis Singletary to moderate\nsomething, I don\u2019t know. He called...",
        "Q: This is David who? David...",
        "A: David, Dr. Wedstein. He teaches at medical school. And I said I couldn\u2019t do it. He\ncalled me long distance, he wanted me to speak, like on television, to have a television\nprogram. And I said, \u201cI just can\u2019t do it,\u201d never talked before, you know, and then\nSylvia Green 125\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 125\ntelevision, my God. I never been on television before. So I told him, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, even now I don\u2019t know when I talk about, I cry.\u201d I, I never know, there\u2019s... not\nthat I can say I\u2019m not going to cry, it just comes automatically. So, he said at that time, he\nsaid, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t cry, after all, Dr. Otis Singletary, you know.\u201d Like you can\u2019t cry.\nThen they came back to me in \u201883, and it was Marilyn Moosnick.

        "Q: All over Kentucky. On public television?",
        "A: I think it was Channel 18. And then, what is it, KET broadcasted it maybe a couple\nyears later on, or a year later on.",
        "Q: Did... did you get the sense up until then, that people in general around you in\nKentucky, among the non-Jewish population, didn\u2019t know about the Holocaust, what had\nhappened, in this, in this state?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t... we never talked about that, they all just felt bad for me. At\nthat time I walked two miles every day and people stopped me, and there was a man one\ntime, \u201cOh, I feel so sorry for you...for you.\u201d And I said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t feel sorry for me.\nI\u2019m proud what I\u2019ve done with my life, and that\u2019s the past.\u201d I said, \u201cI feel good what I\nhave done with my life.

        "Q: Was that the first time? I... you mentioned that before that, you had talked to Jake\nabout your experiences. Had you talked to anybody else before?",
        "A: No, just Mina and I, we talked. Mina died in \u201864, but Mina and I, we talked, still.",
        "Q: So, did that change things for you, starting to relate to people in a... in a different\nway\u201d? Or did people relate to you differently afterwards, apart from...",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. Especially after the documentary. And then Betty Radliff had the\nnews magazine, and that was my whole life story, with pictures in there. And I think she,\nshe done a good job. I just didn\u2019t go out for two days, I didn\u2019t want to face anybody.",

        "Q: And did people start asking you questions, or say...",
        "A: Yeah, then, then, yeah, yeah. I think somehow, I don\u2019t know, they accepted me more\nsomehow. I really think maybe they felt sorry for me. I don\u2019t know. Right now, where I\nam here in Winchester, I\u2019m part of Winchester, all in a sudden. The first 25 years, I did\nnot feel like I was part of it. And really, after Jake retired in \u201883, I wanted to get out of\nhere. And he didn\u2019t, he loved it here, he was born here, he was raised here. And I don\u2019t\nSylvia Green 127\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 127\nknow whether I told you about the Klu Klux Klan [sic]?

That\u2019s what they sold for\nhandkerchiefs. \u201cI\u2019m sweating like a horse.\u201d It was ten cents. He came to a Jewish store to\nbuy. He was sweating like a horse.

        "A: No, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. He came to a Jewish store to... to... to buy a\nhandkerchief. I don\u2019t think he knew why he was marching. He just belonged as a\nmember, probably didn\u2019t know why. So, Jake told me that, I thought that was pretty\nfunny.",
        "Q: It makes you wonder, doesn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: It makes you wonder.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that\u2019s the way Hitler started. He started with the poor. Start\ngiving them black leather pants and jackets and motorcycles. He started with the poor,\nSylvia Green 129\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 129\nand that made them feel important, he gave them jobs. That\u2019s the way he started that\nwhole thing.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you took a trip to Israel?",
        "A: Yeah. In \u201885, May \u201885. I always... as a child, I was a member of the Mizrachi, which\nis a Zionist organization, and I always wanted to go to Palestine as a child, and build up\nPalestine single-handed. I was very enthusiastic. I also was going... I was a member of\nthe Hakoah. Hakoah in Hebrew, it\u2019s The Strong Ones. It was a sports club, and I was\ngoing to the Olympics. I mean, I had planned, my future was planned out, except Hitler\ncut it short. So I always wanted to go, and I always told Jake, \u201cI need to go, I need to go.\u201d\nBut then, I couldn\u2019t go, children in college, so after they got married, I told Jake, I said,\n\u201cT want to go to Israel. You go with me?\u201d Well, he wouldn\u2019t even fly. And I said, \u201cJake, I\nhave to go by myself.\u201d I said, \u201cI feel pretty good. If I wait longer, I won\u2019t be able to go.\u201d\nAnd I went on the tour, with a group from Florida, and oh, it was wonderful. I came out\nnot the same person. It\u2019s amazing.",
        "Q: Tell me more about it.",
        "A: Well, just everything. I mean, how brilliant! You take the desert, where nothing grows\nand that irrigation, I was just fascinated with everything. And then, one Shabbat, one\nSaturday, I spent with a cousin, my first cousin. She left Germany from Breslau in \u201836,\nand she stopped by in Karlsruhe, and we took her to the train station, and she went to\nIsrael, and she became a Hadassah nurse. And I spent a whole Saturday with her, and had\nSylvia Green 130\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 130\ndinner with, and met her children, and her grandchildren. And then her sisters came,\nwhich I haven\u2019t seen in years and years. So that was memorable. We had a lot of talking\nto do. And then I have a cousin who survived the Holocaust, who came to Munich, and\nhe lived with us in Munich. I met his wife and his children, they came to the hotel and\nspent the day with me. But we flew in on a Friday, and then, well the airport is in Tel\nAviv, and we took a bus to Jerusalem, that\u2019s where our tour started.

        "A: No, it\u2019s okay. We went to the hotel and they weren\u2019t ready for us. So, then we start\ndriving around Jerusalem, and I just didn\u2019t believe it, that I actually was there, you know.\nBut then some things were upsetting. After Jerusalem, then we went to Tel Aviv, and to\nHaifa, different places. And when we went into the department store, you had to open\nyour purse. This was upsetting. They had to check whether you had any guns, you know.\nIt was upsetting.",

The only trouble I\nhad with him after the war, when I was single, he was so strict, every boy had to come\ninto the apartment, he had to meet them, he had to interrogate them, whether they good\nenough for his sister. And Jake took me to Cincinnati, to a ball game, and he was going to\ntake me out. There used to be, up on a hill, it was in Kentucky, I can\u2019t remember the\nname of the restaurant, it burned down, it was more of a nightclub. And I told my Aunt\nMina we going to be late, but we were even later, because he wanted me to meet his\nbrother and his sister-in-law, and we all went out to dinner, they went with us.

He had a date,\nwhich he took to Atlantic City for a weekend, that was all right, wasn\u2019t it? But not his\nsister. So this was the only object... objection I had to him.",
        "Q: Do you think he was so protective of you because of what had happened during the\nwar?",
        "A: I think so. The thing about it was, after we met again, he said, \u201cI am so happy, you\nhave no idea. I couldn\u2019t have gone on living if you would have gotten killed.\u201d Because he\ntook my place, by going to England.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel angry about that?",
        "A: No. No I never did. He... even my aunt and I were talk... he never could have\nsurvived it, he was a scholar. He wasn\u2019t strong. All Bernard knew, Bernard never had a\nchildhood. He was studying, and they tore him apart, because my dad wanted him to be a\nrabbi, my mother wanted him to be a college professor. He had to bring home all A\u2019s. So\npoor Bernard just studied all the time. He never could have made it. He couldn\u2019t have\nmade it in any of the camps. So, no, I wasn\u2019t angry about that, I... in fact, after we\nsurvived, Mina and I talked a lot about that, how lucky, because he would have been one\nof the first ones. And we were lucky that they sent him instead, the Jewish Welfare\nOffice. He did not go with the kindertransport, but they send him somewheres else.\nProbably with the older children, he was four years older.\nSylvia Green 134\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 134",
        "Q: What did he do, as a profession?",
        "A: As a profession, he did not become a rabbi, he did not become a college professor. He\nworked for Borden\u2019s in export and imports, and he traveled for them. And, but he did\nmoonlight... he has a beautiful voice, cantorial voice. When I came back, when I buried\nhim in Paramus, New Jersey, and I told you I locked myself in the house for two days\nand two nights and cried, I played the tape over and over, I must have over ten times, and\nI said, \u201cYou going crazy, you better quit. If not, you\u2019re going to wear out the tape and\nyou\u2019re not going to have any tape.\u201d So, he had a strong, beautiful voice, and he did\nmoonlight sometimes. Like on Passover, he would go in New York, oh what was that\nplace? It was a hotel and they served food and ceremony... Grossinger. You heard of\nGrossinger, did you? No?",
        "Q: I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: It\u2019s not there any more, but it was there at one... usually well-to-do people went down\nthere, and they spent the whole week and you didn\u2019t have to make Passover. You know,\nour Passover is a week. So my sister-in-law loved it, because it was a lot less work for\nher. And he used to conduct services, and then the seder he conducted. He loved to do\nthat, but not as a profession.",
        "Q: When did he die?",
        "A: Oh, he just died four days before Thanksgiving.",
        "Q: Oh, this last year, in 1998.\nSylvia Green 135\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 135",
        "A: \u201898, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I\u2019m so happy I was there to see him two months before. And his mind was gone.\nSo when his daughter, Sharon, picked me up at the airport, I said, \u201cCould we stop by?\u201d It\nwas about eight o\u2019clock. She said, \u201cSure.\u201d So we stopped by, and the kids bought him a\nLazy Boy, and he was asleep, and I walked in, and he was hard of hearing, too, and he\ncouldn\u2019t... the hearing aids, he lost them and lost them and then they didn\u2019t help any,\nanyway. So I whispered in his ear, \u201cBernard, Bernard, you lazy boy, wake up. Your sister\nSylvia is here.\u201d About three or four time, I repeated that, and all in a sudden, you should\nhave seen his face. Before, he was pale, flushed, his eyes, there was recognition, and a\nsmile from ear to ear. And Sharon said, \u201cYou know something? I haven\u2019t seen Daddy\nsmile like that since Mama died.\u201d But that was the only recognition, then I was \u201cHey\nyou,\u201d or \u201cI want to do this, I want to do that.\u201d And when Sharon... before we went to the\nairport, I... this time I stayed two days, because it Just wore me out, just fly in and fly out\nSunday. So I, I flew in Thursday, and I was just... because before, I stayed with him all\nday, and she picked me up just to go to bed at her house. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting too hard\nfor you, and you just stay a half a day,\u201d but I stayed all day Friday, I stayed all day\nSaturday, and before we went to the airport, I said, \u201cDo you think you could, we could\nstop by?\u201d She said, \u201cSure. We can leave about an hour earlier, and you can stay with\nhim.\u201d So, when I walked in, he said... the day before, we thought he was going to die.\nSylvia Green 136\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 136\nWalked in there, \u201cI want to get dressed.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, you going to get dressed.\u201d I took\nsome clothes and I matched up things. He looked sharp, he really did. And I was going to\nshave him, but his electric shaver didn\u2019t work, and I wouldn\u2019t use a straight razor, he was\na severe diabetic. But I combed his hair, I washed his face. He said, \u201cI want to eat in the\ndining room.\u201d He hasn\u2019t eaten in the dining room, I don\u2019t remember when. I took him to\nthe dining room in a wheelchair, and sat down next to him. And they wouldn\u2019t give him\nany bread any more, because he would wad it up, put it in his mouth, and he\u2019d choke. So\nhe saw the bread and he pointed, and his face lit up. So I broke it up in a million little\npieces. And then he ate, and I kissed him good-bye. It didn\u2019t bother him that I left, he\ndidn\u2019t know. But I\u2019m just happy I saw him two months before, and this... to recognize\nhim, that he recognized me, this is something I cherish. But he left three beautiful girls.\nNice son-in-laws. Good girls. One is going to make Aliyah, she\u2019s moving to Israel.",
        "Q: Were you ever frustrated with him that he left Kentucky after bringing you here,\nafter...",
        "A: Yeah, I laughed about it. No, that\u2019s become home, you know. He left here, graduated,\nundergraduate degree from University Kentucky, so he was with us. And then he went to\nChicago, and he worked on his Master\u2019s in Chicago. And I went to visit him in \u201c48. My\nparents had some friends who survived, who lived in Chicago, and I stayed with them for\ntwo weeks. And then he went to Columbia University. And he had enough credit for\neverything, but he didn\u2019t finish his thesis, he got involved with a girl and got engaged,\nSylvia Green 137\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 137\nand it was a mess. But thank God he saw it ahead of time, that he called the engagement\noff. It wouldn\u2019t have worked.",
        "Q: I\u2019m... okay, I wanted to ask you about Germany and Germans. After the war you...\nyou were, of course, very angry at the...",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: ...at the Germans. Has that changed over time?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s... I finally let go of it. Took a long time, it was a gradual thing. And\nanybody had any connection with Germany or even probably 20 generation way back in\nGermany, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And even the language, I don\u2019t speak\nGerman. Maybe I could, I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t do it. I think I build a mental block,\nand even my brother Bernard used to say, Germany was there before Hitler, but when\nHitler came to power, I only was nine years old, so to me, the German language was\nHitler. So, but that\u2019s gone now, I think.",
        "Q: Did you ever have the desire to visit Germany again?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t have any desire.",
        "Q: Or Poland?",
        "A: The other... no, mm-mm. I don\u2019t have that happy memories about Poland, either. And\nthen the Polish Gentiles were very anti-Semitic. They collaborated with the Germans.\nThey were very happy to collaborate with the Germans. So, no, there are other places I\nwould like to go. I would like to go back to Israel, but I don\u2019t know if... ?ve got some\nSylvia Green 138\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 138\nproblems with my legs. Maybe if I win the lottery and I could fly first-class, then I would\ngo.",
        "Q: You were saying a little bit earlier about... off tape, about a woman who you met at\nthe Kroger...",
        "A: Oh, at the... yeah, the Kroger\u2019s.",
        "Q: Will you tell, will you tell about that on, on tape?",
        "A: Well, I have known her. She\u2019s been here as long as I have, over 50 years. She was\nfrom Germany, and maybe a hundred miles away from my hometown, she was... she\u2019s,\nwas from Mannheim. And some relatives of Jake wanted me to meet her, they thought\nthat she was such a lovely lady, and she probably was, but I didn\u2019t want to meet her,\nbecause with the German connection. And for years I didn\u2019t meet her. If I saw her, I\nwould run across the street, just not to have to see her. So then, finally, we did meet and\nwe talked some, and I always said, \u201cShe seems nice enough, she couldn\u2019t be my best\nfriend.\u201d And I don\u2019t know whether I would want her as my best friend, because then it\u2019s\nGerman again, you know. But I was at Kroger\u2019s, oh it was, I don\u2019t know, November,\nDecember, and we were talking about something and it came up, the past, and she starts\nsobbing and she start crying, and automatically, I cradled her in my arms. I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it, I mean, that was such a automatic gesture, you know. I just couldn\u2019t believe it.\nSo when I came home, I called Sandy. I said, \u201cYou won\u2019t believe it. I was comforting\nLilo Thomps... Thompson.\u201d She said, \u201cMom, you\u2019ve come a long ways.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I\nSylvia Green 139\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 139\nhave.\u201d But I did tell her also, I said, \u201cListen, we were born at the wrong time, at the\nwrong place.\u201d Now, I couldn\u2019t have felt that way a few years back, and it\u2019s true.",
        "Q: So your bitter, your bitterness has...",
        "A: It\u2019s, it\u2019s gone...",
        "Q: Has the...",
        "A: ...well, it\u2019s kind-of subsided, thank God. Like I said, that I\u2019ve, I feel like there\u2019s a\nload off my shoulders, you know, like you carry the world on your shoulders. Thank God\nit\u2019s not there any more.",
        "Q: What... can you identify things that happened in your life that made that change, that\nmade the bitterness go away?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know. It\u2019s... the few years I have left, I like to live them\nout, not with hatred, and it\u2019s even hard enough just to be alone now. Living isn\u2019t easy.\nSo, I don\u2019t know when it left me, I Just hope it stays away.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think we mentioned on the tape... that when Jake passed away, that was... will\nyou say when that was?",
        "A: It was January the ninth, \u201897, and we both have a living will, but I... I wanted him\nback, so I called 911, and they start working on him. And I called the children, they told\nme to call the children. They found a very slight pulse. So I called Jerry, then I called\nSandy, Sandy said, \u201cHang up, I call right back and leave the line open.\u201d So I did, so she\nheard everything what went on. So, I was so fortunate that night, because my doctor, Dr.\nSylvia Green 140\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 140\nPika was on call that night, and she was called in, and she stayed with me. And Sandy\ncalled a friend to stay in the hospital with me. And so Dr. Pika told that friend, Ava\nTyler, \u201cMiss Tyler,\u201d she didn\u2019t know Ava, \u201cI like to ask a favor of you, would you\nplease spend the night with Mrs. Green? I don\u2019t want her alone.\u201d So, I\u2019m very fortunate\nto have a caring doctor like she is. And she\u2019s only about 32-33 years old, with two\nchildren. She had those while she already was, was in practice. So, she prepared me so,\nbecause they were working at, with Jake at the hospital, in emergency room. And she\nwould come back and forth, to see how I was. And after about a half an hour, she said,\n\u201cMiss Green, you don\u2019t want him back. If he would come back now, he\u2019d be brain-dead\nand you wouldn\u2019t want him, he wouldn\u2019t want it.\u201d I think he already was gone when she\ncame in telling me that.",
        "Q: And I, I\u2019m... I know that you went, recently... we were talking about this a little bit\noff tape, too, that you went recently to Louisville, to talk, to do a public talk.",
        "A: For the first time...",
        "Q: For the first time.",
        "A: Yeah, and it was in the Jewish Community Center. And the only reason I did it was\nbecause my foster brother asked me. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.",

        "A: Stuart...",

        "A: Dr. Stuart Urbach, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about what that experience was like?",
        "A: Well, nerve-racking, that\u2019s all I can say. I didn\u2019t sleep. I might have slept about five\nhours in three nights. And I don\u2019t know. When I got up there, I mentioned, first I\nmentioned my name and then I told them that I never spoke in public, that I have given\ninterviews in the comfort of my own home, but I told them I was very nervous. And well,\nI did it.",
        "Q: And how many people were in the audience?",
        "A: Well, that was strange, because when I walked in, we were a little late, and Leah was\nkinda on edge. I said, \u201cYou thought I\u2019d be a no-show, huh?\u201d",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about Leah... Leah Dickstein.",
        "A: Like I talked to you on the telephone, Dr., Dr. Dickstein, yeah. So she said, \u201cNo, I just\nwant to show you where you stand and which side you get on the stage, and I\u2019m going to\nget on the other one, I will introduce you.\u201d And I looked around, I said, \u201cLeah,\u201d I said,\n\u201cthere are over a thousand people here.\u201d She said, \u201cThat can\u2019t be, because it only holds\n250.\u201d I swear it looked like over a thousand. But then I got the letter from the Federation\nand they said there were 450 people, that there were chairs all around, then the lobby, a\nlot of people were there.",
        "Q: This was held in the Jewish Federation of Louisville, is that right?",
        "A: What?\nSylvia Green 142\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 142",
        "Q: Jewish...",
        "A: No, the Community Center.",
        "Q: Community Center.",
        "A: It\u2019s the Jewish Community Center. But the, the Jewish Federation is in charge of it.\nAnd Leah, she... Dr. Dickstein organized the whole thing.",
        "Q: Was this the first event of its kind in, in Louisville?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know. She said it was a wonderful attendance, and she said there were a\nlot of Gentiles and a lot of children. And the children are important, because they never\nheard of it, they didn\u2019t know anything about it. So that\u2019s the ones we have to teach. We\nhave a Yom Shoah day in Lexington. Sometimes you have more people than other times.\nSo I don\u2019t know, they had one here, I think Tuesday, and I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t ask...\nfind out how many people there were.",
        "Q: Has it gotten any easier for you to speak about your experiences, over time?",
        "A: It still, 1t still upsets me. You can see it does. Sometimes I wish it\u2019d just go away. But\nthe only way it\u2019s going to go away, when I go away. That\u2019s the only way.",
        "Q: Do you have any sense of relief, or maybe even that it\u2019s necessary to talk? Do you\nhave a feeling that it\u2019s, that there\u2019s anything good that comes out of it?",
        "A: Well, people should know, but...\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B\nSylvia Green 143\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 143",
        "Q: Tape three, side B, of an interview with Sylvia Green. I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.",
        "A: I, I just said, maybe I\u2019m selfish, it just still gets me upset, and I don\u2019t like to be upset. I\nwould like to live my life out in peace. And see it... the past, I feel like I\u2019ve lived more\nthan two lives. And really, the life right now is not easy, either. Looking back, if Jake\nwould have lived, we would have been married 50 years in January. And I always\nthought that... well, everybody goes through some kind of hell in life. You\u2019re not\npromised a rose garden, and I always felt like, well, you\u2019ve gone through your hell at a\nvery young age, and everything was smooth, everything was fine. We had no problems\nhere, the marriage was good, the children were wonderful, and then, then it hit again.",
        "Q: What hit again? I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Well, Jake passed away, it hit me again. I just thought maybe I will have smooth\nsailing the rest of my life, but there\u2019s no guarantee.",
        "Q: Do you have ideas of, of what you want now, for the rest of your life? Goals?",
        "A: Goals. I hope and pray, and I pray all the time, I hope when my time comes, it be\nquick. I hope I'll be able to take care of myself and don\u2019t have to be a burden to my\nchildren. This bothers me. And that\u2019s my goal. Otherwise, what kind of goal? I mean, I\nenjoy working in the hospital, I got good relationship with the people I work in, and\nknow everybody there.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you volunteer one, one day a week there?",
        "A: Yeah, eight and a half hours. I get there by... well, I used to at eight o\u2019clock, but\nSylvia Green 144\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 144\nthen, there\u2019s so much traffic on Boone Avenue when school is in session, if I try to get\nout here ten to eight, to be in the hospital at eight, I can sit 20 minutes and can\u2019t even get\nout my driveway. So it\u2019s worthwhile for me to get up a half an hour earlier and leave here\nabout 7:30. But then, we have other things. We have bake sales, we have book sales. And\nin the morning, I... what I do is like a gopher. Anything they ask, we, we do. And then,\nthe afternoon, I go to the gift shop, because in the morning it\u2019s a lot of running around.\nAnd my legs don\u2019t take it as well, so when I get in the gift shop, then it\u2019s more relaxing,\nexcept when we have Beanie Babies, then it\u2019s not very relaxing. There\u2019s... people still go\nwild over the Beanie Babies.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the name of the hospital?",
        "A: Clark Regional Medical Center.",

        "A: Here in Winchester, yes.",
        "Q: And what do you do the other days of the week?",
        "A: Well, take somebody else\u2019s place. Like somebody goes out of town, like I was out of\ntown Monday, so somebody fills in what I do. So, if they go out of town, then I fill in\nwhat they do. And then, the only bad thing is that I don\u2019t drive at night, because we really\ngot a lot going on in the synagogue, but it\u2019s always at night. And I have that horror\ngetting stuck on Interstate 64, with a flat tire, or the car stops. So, I do have a car phone,\nI... I don\u2019t know, it just... 1t\u2019d be scary. So I don\u2019t go after dark. I do in town, I drive.\nSylvia Green 145\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 145\nI\u2019m a member of AARP, and we meet in the evening.",

And they had a dairy store, dairy, eggs and butter\nand my dad, that was my dad\u2019s job in Karlsruhe. It was lucky, my mother always said I was\nthe lucky child because the day I was born my dad got that job. He was the manager of the\ndairy department in a wholesale grocery store, and he had this job until he was deported to\nPoland in 1938.

        "A: Yeah, 1919, they married in Chrzanow where my mother was from and I think it was a\nmatch, probably, arranged.",
        "A: They were very poor, there were ten children and my grandfather had a tailor shop,\nSylvia Green 4\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 4\ntailoring shop, and there hardly was any food on the table and my mother\u2019 was the second\noldest girl, the first one was a boy. So my mother had to raise all the younger children so\nshe never had a childhood. She said she never played with children. They had a cradle\nmade out of wood and she would look out the window and children were on the sidewalk\nplaying hopscotch and she participated then, she was in an apartment upstairs and many\ntimes the cradle was turned upside down because she got so excited, but she never had\ntime to really play with children, raising the rest of the family. My grandfather, I only\nsaw him once or twice in my life. To me, he was a big man with a long beard, Orthodox,\nand my mother said that he never held any of the children on his lap, but the\ngrandchildren he did. That one time we went to visit, I was on his lap and I braided his\nbeard and my mother just stood there, she didn\u2019t believe that he let me do that.",
        "A: Yeah, they were Orthodox, but modern Orthodox. My dad was clean-shaven and my\nmother did not wear a wig, they were modern Orthodox, but very observing, Sabbath and all\nthe holidays. When my dad worked, well the name was Pfankuch, he never had a vacation\nall his life because he didn\u2019t work on any Jewish holidays and we got a lot of holidays, so\nthis was taken off as vacation. So my mother used to take us places or, also, we children,\nobvious, every summer you had to get out of the city, like otherwise you would die it seems\nlike.

        "A: As children we were close in a way, but boys were raised entirely different than girls. A\ngirl just had to smile and look pretty, that\u2019s all that mattered, and my brother had to be\neducated, so he didn\u2019t have a childhood. My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, is that all right\nthe way I\u2019m holding that now? My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, my mother wanted him to\nbe a college professor, so he was educated for both. So I was schooled, we had school, you\nwent to school from eight till 12 and you went back in the afternoon from two till four, or\nfrom eight till one and three till five. Whenever he got out of school, he had to go to Hebrew\nSylvia Green 6\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 6\nschool, every day. So he didn\u2019t have much of a childhood either. And it was really\ninteresting, after we met again after the war, he was married and I was married and so we\ntalked about our parents and about our childhood, and the interesting part was the way I\ntalked about our parents was not the same way he talked about his parents, which were our\nparents, you know. So he told me, he said, \u201cI was so jealous of you.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cI was so jealous of you, you were so brilliant.\u201d And he said, \u201cI had to be. I had to\nstudy all the time, I had no childhood and you had friends.\u201d He didn\u2019t have any friends.\n\u201cYou always had friends, you always were playing or going places, doing things.\u201d And it\nwas really interesting, we were jealous of each other. But it worked out well, I mean we got\nit out of our system and we didn\u2019t carry any grudges.",

And, well,\nthat\u2019s what I said, all you had to do was smile and you had to associate with the people they\napproved of. And you couldn\u2019t go with children they didn\u2019t approve\u2014especially my\nmother. My dad was a hard-working man.",
        "A: Yes, I always had a lot of friends.",
        "A: Well, at the beginning I had Gentile friends, but then when Hitler came to power, they\nSylvia Green 7\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 7\ngot sparse, less and less friends. And it\u2019s really interesting you asking that, I still remember\nFritz Oler, we were raised together and I loved Fritz as much as I liked my brother, loved my\nbrother Bernard. And then when Hitler came to power, he disappeared. If we passed on the\nstreet, he wouldn\u2019t see me. If I passed on the street when it was dark, at that time we used to\ngo out in the evening, at the beginning, later on we didn\u2019t go out too much in the evenings,\nhe would look, stare at you like no recognition, but then he would take his hand and wave at\nyou in the back, so he wouldn\u2019t been seen. So but that really hurt, because in a way I knew\nthat the reason for it because I was a Jew, but it\u2019s very hard for children to accept. You, you\ntake it personally. Because I would cry, I came home and I saw some of the girls I used to\nplay with and they run away. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she like me any more? I haven\u2019t done anything\nto her.\u201d That\u2019s hard. And they probably went home and talked to their parents, also, how\nbad they felt, you know.",

I mean, what happened you remember, but to\nremember the exact date, because I started at such a young age and so many things happened\nuntil \u201845, and nothing was good really. So, but what they didn\u2019t know, we got a much better\neducation than we did in public school because they wouldn\u2019t let Jewish college professors\nteach, so we got the college professors to teach us. So we benefited from it, we really did.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have to travel, 1t was within walking distance, in the radius of so many miles, they\nhad a school close by and we weren\u2019t bussed at that time.",
        "A: Well, I saw Hitler many times, I was a nosy child and whenever he came, I would not go\ndown to see him in my neighborhood because everybody knew I was a Jew, I would go\nblocks and blocks out of my way and, where they didn\u2019t know me, and I was standing in the\nfront row, I was just fascinated by him, it was just like he hypnotized people. You know, I\nusually talk with my hands! It\u2019s hard. I\u2019m sorry. Well, I would always be in the front row,\nmany blocks away from where I lived, and I was there in the front row with everybody\neverybody else, and everybody yelling, \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d Here, he always came in a convertible\nand, naturally, he would hold his hand on the belt, I can close my eyes and see him, \u201cHeil\nHitler, Heil Hitler,\u201d and people just went crazy screaming, you know. And they all were\nSylvia Green 9\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 9\nrunning and I was right there with them. And he wouldn\u2019t let them get too close and then he\njust would take his hands, slowly, and everybody would go back. It\u2019s just like you were\nhypnotized, you know? So this was \u201833, but really, \u201832, already it started. There were\nCommunist parties, Nazi parties, Socialist parties, and they always scheduled marches about\nthe same time and there always, somehow there was a shooting going on, and they yelling\nand they used to hit each other. And my mother always used to grab my hand and, \u201cLet\u2019s go\nupstairs, let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d \u201cNo, I want to see what goes on!\u201d In \u201832, you know, I was eight\nyears old, I was nosy.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t, I just was fascinated by that whole thing, it was just like\neverybody was hypnotized. And his speeches weren\u2019t, he didn\u2019t say anything, he said three,\nfour words, and then yell, everybody yelled, \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler.\u201d I don\u2019t know, as a\nchild, the one thing I remember, he\u2019s... always when he came to Karlsruhe, it was a pretty\ngood sized town at that time, the size of Louisville, he would stay in the Hotel Germania,\nand every time I passed that hotel, I was going to stay there someday.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, you kind of fascinated until, you know, then I didn\u2019t admire him anymore.\nI mean, what came afterwards, my mother always said, \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worse.

I mean, my parents knew, my mother\nknew, middle in the night we heard that whistle, and it was my brother came home, that was\nin \u201838.

Now, I was not there, this was told to me afterwards by my dad that, then\nthey finally let them there, let them in. So then after \u00b038, this was October, 1n November\nthey had Crystal Night.",

        "A: Crystal Night, it was wild. We didn\u2019t go out and, excuse me, got the hair right on your\neye, I\u2019m looking at you, okay. They banged at the door and my mother yelled, \u201cWe don\u2019t\nhave any men here in the house. You deported my husband.\u201d And my brother hid in the\napartment, I don\u2019t know, I think in a closet or something, bathroom. And we didn\u2019t open the\ndoor. And we screamed and they screamed, and then they went away. Several times they\ncame that night, then later on we found out they burned the synagogues, they burned the\nTorahs, they took the rabbi and set his beard on fire and this was afterwards. I didn\u2019t, we did\nnot go out, we were too scared to go out. This was November, *38. It was horrible, it really,\nit was horrible when they took my father away, but they just went crazy, they really did. We\nlived on Main Street and there was so much yelling going on. I stood behind a curtain just to\nsee something and then they broke all the glass in the Jewish stores and there were quite a\nSylvia Green 14\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 14\nfew Jewish stores on Main Street. They went berzerk.",
        "A: Well, you need an affidavit to come to the United States and my aunt Mina\u2019, the one I\ncame to the United States with, had a brother-in-law in Lexington, Kentucky. And after we\nwere in Poland, we lived in the same apartment house my aunt lived in and we talked, if\nsomebody was going to survive that, to get in touch with Leon Urbach and there was a street,\nbut I didn\u2019t remember it when I wrote to them, and that\u2019s how we were gonna be reunited.\nSo, what was the question you asked?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, Urbach sent us an affidavit, but 1t was already too late, because Hitler went\ninto Austria, that was in \u201838. And the Austrian quota, you see, there was a quota, German\ncitizen, Polish citizen, Austrian citizen, you had to wait, you got a number, so they raised the\nAustrian quota for the Jews get out of Austria, so we couldn\u2019t get out, if maybe another six\nmonths we could have made it, but I guess 1t wasn\u2019t meant to be.",

I was a nervous\nwreck, always thought I was going to connect the wrong people.

And\nwell, my brother, he, we had like an overseas trunk and, and he packed everything, and it\nwas shipped to Poland and the bedroom was shipped to Poland. We didn\u2019t get it. So, we left\nby August, beginning of August, you just had to leave.",
        "A: Yes, yes. We stopped by, we stopped off in Berlin, my brother went to England the same\nnight my mother and I caught a train to Poland, but we stopped off in Berlin. My mother\nwanted me to talk to the American Consulate and she thought I could do better, you know, to\ntalk to \u2018em, that maybe we could get out and come to America. I didn\u2019t even get to see the\nConsulate in Berlin. I just talked to the secretary or somebody at the front desk, maybe some\nother people had the same idea, too.",

If we had\nsomebody in Warsaw, maybe we would have gone to Warsaw, but we didn\u2019t know anybody.\nMy mother was born in a little town near Krakow.",

And it was great, I just thought \u201cWell now, everything 1s\ngoing to go get back to normal,\u201d and since they rented an apartment, that everything is going\nto be okay now, we were together and my brother was in England, so, but we were wrong,\nwe really were wrong.",

        "A: My father, all three of us. And then we were not the only ones, because my aunt lived in\nthat apartment, and then some other sisters came from the country. And at the beginning, we\nall stayed at my aunt\u2019s place. And the children slept on the floor, and the adults used the\nbeds. And my mother wouldn\u2019t let me sleep on the floor, she thought I was too good to sleep\non the floor, and I was just dying to sleep on the floor with the other kids. Seems like such a\nsilly thing to remember, you know? But I guess it must have made an impression on me at\nthat time.",
        "A: Well, this was \u201839, September, \u00b039, in 1940, just a few months, then we had to sweep the\nstreets, we had to wear armbands, that was in 1940. We had to, even if it rained, we had to\nsweep the streets. We had to clean barracks, we scrubbed the barracks on our knees, we\ncarried railroad tracks, all in 1940, but we still lived in the apartment. We had to meet in the\nmornings. And my trouble was, I was very tall, I was five-eight, and they would line us up,\nSylvia Green 19\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 19\nthe tallest in the middle and then the shorter ones and shorter ones, and I really got the heavy\nload. And they were not very kind to us when we cleaned the barracks, I mean they would\nyell and scream, or kick, or scare us they were gonna shoot us, but in the evening, after we\nwent back, my mother always had a hot meal for us and I can hear my mama say, \u201cIt\u2019s not\ngonna get any worse, it\u2019s not gonna get any worse.\u201d And all during the war, I can hear her\nsay, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna get any worse,\u201d but it did.",

And you\ndidn\u2019t question it, you just did it. Worst thing really happened to me was, my parents and\nSylvia Green 20\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 20\nmy aunt always said, \u201cSylvia, if Germans are around, never speak German. You don\u2019t want\nthem to know that you German.\u201d So I spoke Polish, naturally with an accent. And there was\na German, we were carrying railroad tracks and loading them on trucks, so I did not know\nand I was talking German to another German Jew, he came up and he said, \u201cYou speak with\na Badenzer,\u201d Baden, it\u2019s like the state of Baden, like Kentucky, you know? But then the\naccent, \u201cYou speak exactly like I do,\u201d and he was the meanest thing, he would scream, he\nalways sit on top of the truck and yell at us. And we never did anything right, and always\nhad the gun, was going to shoot, and he said, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d And I had to tell him, I\nsaid, \u201cKarlsruhe am Rhine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m from Karlsruhe am Rhine. You come on and you sit on\nthe truck,\u201d and he gave me his lunch, and he made everybody watch. I couldn\u2019t swallow, I\ncould, I mean my throat closed up, you know? And he was yelling at me, \u201cYou eat. You\neat.\u201d I don\u2019t know whether he wanted me to have his lunch or he did it out of meanness or\nmaybe he thought he was helping me, I don\u2019t know. But I sure couldn\u2019t swallow, it just got,\ngot stuck in my throat.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, yeah. You marched there, you had a meeting point and you marched, and you\nmarched home that night. And you had to wear your armband. And I don\u2019t understand,\nsome people say they, they wore a armband with a yellow star which said Juden there. We\nhad the blue star, a white armband, in Krakow. That\u2019s what I remember.\nSylvia Green 21\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 21",
        "A: Well, we really couldn\u2019t talk too much because we were watched so closely. You made\nfriends and you didn\u2019t make friends. One day you had friends, the next day they were gone.\nI was fortunate that I was with my aunt constantly and we talked a lot. And especially at\nnight, you know, after we got together, we talked a lot. But you couldn\u2019t have friends\nbecause. . .",
        "A: Huh? Fun? Yeah, you know how I had fun? To aggravate the Germans. That was our\nfun. We would laugh so hard where we felt like crying. And they could not understand and\nthen we, we would tell jokes, and we would laugh, really we didn\u2019t feel like laughing, but we\ndid laugh, and that just about killed them. \u201cMy God, you should be crying there, what are\nyou laughing?\u201d You know. But if they got closer to you, you really shut up and you didn\u2019t\nlook at \u2018em, you turned your head.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes. Some hit people, I saw \u2018em kill people, I saw \u2018em kill babies and... for no\nreason. Really sometimes you wonder how they could live with themselves, I don\u2019t know. I\nthink a lot of them were drunk, I really do. I did not realize that until I saw \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList,\u201d then I saw there, I mean they were drinking, I knew Goeth\u2019, now I\u2019m getting ahead of\nmyself already. But they must have been drunk because they were yelling, yelling, yelling,\n\u201d Amon Goeth (1908-46), SS Officer, commanded the concentration camp at Plaszow\nfrom February 1943 to September 1944.\nSylvia Green 22\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 22\nmy God.",
        "A: Like that, day after day, whatever they asked me to do, I did. And then \u201841 was the\nghetto. We were notified we had to leave. So like in \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d we grabbed a\nbedsheet again, we dumped everything in there, and a suitcase, and you walked. And like I\ntold you on the phone, when I saw that \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d I was looking for myself in there\nbecause it was so real, it, to me it was a documentary, it was not just a movie. I was looking\nfor my relatives, I was looking for my parents, I was looking for myself. And that was no\npicnic, five, six people in a little apartment where you barely had room even to sleep on the\nfloor.",
        "A: My family and my relatives, and then that got smaller all the time. I mean, one day, well,\nI\u2019m getting ahead again, it\u2019s... Well, we did the same thing there, we would march to work\noutside the ghetto and did the same thing, we shoveled snow, we washed the streets, and the\nsame yelling. There were different faces of... watching us, but it seemed like they were all\nthe same.",
        "A: The same thing until \u201842, we got the job, my aunt got the job in Kabelwerk work and we\nmarched from the ghetto to Kabelwerk every morning, it\u2019s\u2014was a cable factory, and there\nwere different departments there. I had to cover cables, I was in charge of ten machines and\nSylvia Green 23\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 23\nmy aunt, they made, what did she do? Oh, I can\u2019t think of that word, you plug it in, you\nknow what I\u2019m talking about, a cord you plug in, those what do you call them?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah, something like that, but you plug it in in outlets like, what\u2019s it called?",
        "A: Plug, okay, well she put those together, my aunt, it was a different department she\nworked in. And from morning we marched with a O.D. man [ph], it was a Jewish police and\nthen we went back again. And then, I think it was towards end of \u201842, then we were\nconcentrated in Plaszow, Patkusz [ph] Plaszow, the concentration camp, and we went to\nwork to Kabelwerk from Plaszow. And I only saw my parents twice.",
        "A: Well, it was always cold. And I don\u2019t know what I looked like, there was no mirror, you\nknow, but I looked at my aunt and I knew what I looked like: a skeleton. We were always\ncold, all we wore were prison garb and it was in the wintertime, naturally you were cold and\nPoland is cold. And then you had to stand appell, they would count you and count you, they\nwanted to make sure that a half a person wasn\u2019t missing or something, sometimes it was for\nhours just of meanness, till they got bored with it. The quarters, they were barracks, and\nSylvia Green 24\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 24\nwith wooden slats and you just, there were a bottom one, I think they were like a bunk, like a\nbunk, you couldn\u2019t call 1t bed.",
        "A: In Plaszow. Patkush Plaszow.",
        "A: In the ghetto was apartments, still apartments, but overcrowded. Because the ghetto, at\none time, people lived there, before the ghetto, they were homes, you know. I mean,\napartments.",
        "A: Probably I did, I don\u2019t know, we got a meal in Kabelwerk, the interesting thing was that\nthe first time, I always ate kosher and when I started working in Kabelwerk, they served us\nmeals and it was the same meal the Gentile workers got, so that wasn\u2019t that bad because it\nhad a lot of vegetables in there, I don\u2019t remember about meat now, maybe it did. And I\nwouldn\u2019t eat, I came home and I barely dragged and my dad said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d We\nwere still in the ghetto at that time, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I said, \u201cDad, I can\u2019t eat it, they\nserving trayf.\u201d So it must have had meat in there also. And he said, \u201cYou have to eat. You\nhave to have strength to survive this. You have to eat.\u201d So the next day, I ate and I couldn\u2019t\nkeep it down, I was throwing it all up, I came home and I dragged again. I told my dad, I\nsaid, \u201cI can\u2019t keep it down.\u201d He said, \u201cYou have to eat. You have to force yourself.\u201d And\nSylvia Green 25\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 25\nthe third day, I was glad to get it. So from that on I started eating trayf and was lucky\nenough to get it, you know, at that time.",
        "A: No, no. Just my aunt and I and I was promised that I, 1f I would work in Kabelwerk, that\nmy aunt, my parents would be safe in the ghetto. But naturally, it was broken promises. So\nthe liquidation of the ghetto was March the 13, 1943. And my father got killed in the\nhospital, Spital. What happened was, every so often in the ghetto, they were rounding up\npeople to send them to concentration camps and he, they rounded him up on the street in the\nghetto and he jumped out the window and he fell, he was going to run away and hide\nsomewheres in the ghetto, and he fell, he broke his leg. So this was a makeshift hospital, and\nthey had some Jewish doctors who practiced, I mean they were doctors before the war, and\nhe was in traction and his leg was in traction, it was the last time I saw him. And he was shot\nin the hospital. Because my cousin saw him, he was in the clean-up crew, and he saw him\nlaying there on the sidewalk and there were pictures of my mother and of me and my brother\naround him. But I didn\u2019t know until I saw \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d that they gave them poison, the\nnurses gave them poison, I did not know that. And I was thankful. Did you see, they were\ngrateful, the patients were grateful to get it. They were even smiling because you heard them\ndownstairs already yelling and screaming, and by the time they came up, they start shooting\nand they didn\u2019t even notice that they were already dead. And I don\u2019t know what happened\nto my mother, I thought my mother might have ended up in one of the concentration camps,\nSylvia Green 26\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 26\nbut she might have been shot in the ghetto because they were just shooting left and right.",
        "A: No, no, no. I was in the Kabelwerk at that time, I mean I was working in Kabelwerk,\nAnd after the liquidation of the ghetto, then they built barracks in Kabelwerk and we were\nthere, we were not walking to Plaszow any more. We were concentrated where the factory\nwas.",
        "A: That was till about September, this was, I think May, March, \u201843 until I think, September\n\u201843, we were concentrated in the factory where we worked. And that wasn\u2019t that bad, the\nonly upsetting thing I still remember is, they supposed to have somebody come from\nSwitzerland, a Red Cross representative come from Switzerland and we had to clean the\nbarracks and we all got a care package, which we had to open but not touch. So when the\nrepresentative from Switzerland came, he looked around, the barracks were clean and we all\ntalked to him on the side how bad it is, you know. And he was not very sympathetic, he\nsaid, \u201cThe barracks are clean. Look at the nice care package. What are you complaining?\nPeople are getting killed, there is a war going on, you got it good here.\u201d So we told him, we\nsaid, \u201cWe will have to return those, we can\u2019t even touch it. The order was to open it up, but\nnot to touch it.\u201d And they took those care packages away, but it was so upsetting to us that\nhe didn\u2019t believe us, the representative from the Red Cross.\nSylvia Green 27\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 27\nyour mother?",
        "A: The last time, it might have been maybe a month before. My aunt knew the O.D. man\n[ph], the one used to march us from one place to another, and he had to be in the ghetto. And\nmy aunt asked him, whether he would take me along. So I marched with him and he was\nyelling at me just because there were Germans around, you know, even going from one place\nto another, \u201cNow you walk straight.\u201d You know. And it might have been about a month\nbefore, I went to the hospital\u2014I went first and saw my mother and my mother told me my\ndad was in the hospital. So I went to the hospital and I only had a very short time, I don\u2019t\nremember exactly, maybe a whole hour or a half an hour, I don\u2019t remember that. And my\ndad said he was so happy to see me, he was just smiling and he had his leg in traction. So he\nsaid, \u201cI want you to meet my doctor, he is such a nice man.\u201d I said, \u201cDad, I have to go, I\nhave to go.\u201d They just gave me so much time, and I says, \u201cI got to go,\u201d and we hugged and I\nkissed him and I was walking out and the doctor just walked in.

The last visit, I went into the\nghetto, an O.D. man had to go to the ghetto and he was a good friend of my aunt\u2019s and so my\naunt asked him to take me along so I could see my parents. And so we marched and he was\nyelling at me, I knew he was just doing it, you know, for the other Germans around, the ones\nwho would walk, and as we entered the ghetto, I went to my mother\u2019s place first and then\nshe told me that my father was in the hospital and I went to see my dad and he was so happy\nto see me because I always was daddy\u2019s little girl and we talked for awhile and he had his leg\nin traction and he told me what happened, how he broke the leg, that he jumped out the\nwindow because they were rounding them up to send them to gas chambers. And, well, we\ntalked for awhile and then I said, \u201cDad, I have to go.\u201d Well, I called him Papa, we called the\nfather Papa. I have to go because so and so, the O.D. man, I can\u2019t remember his name now, I\nhave to go back with him.

He went to bed. He never was sick and got killed and he only\nwas 53 years old, a nice looking man.",
        "A: The Jewish policemen, kapo, O.D., Jewish policemen. Some of them were pretty mean,\nalso, they thought they would get a better treatment when they mistreated us, some were\npretty rough.",
        "A: No. I got beaten one time, 25, by\u2014that was in Plaszow, Patkush-Plaszow, that\nconcentration camp, it was 1n a barrack and it was the one who was in charge of the barrack,\nand I got 25 paddles. There was a bad odor in that neighborhood where I was on the double\ndecker wooden thing where we were laying. And somebody had their period or something\nand they put some, it wasn\u2019t pads, it was something, and pushed it over where I was sleeping\nand she said it was mine, it didn\u2019t happen to be mine, I got 25 paddles. But that was, I think\nwas the only time. My aunt always told me, \u201cDon\u2019t walk erect, make yourself shorter,\u201d you\nknow, that you wouldn\u2019t stand out, and I always knew wherever I went, I just walked like\nthat. So some, some, some girls got raped and I was pretty fortunate, but I wasn\u2019t much to\nSylvia Green 31\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 31\nlook at because all those years already took its toll at a very young age and I was still in the\ndeveloping age, you know, when the war broke out.",
        "A: No, I was not in the ghetto when it was liquidated, so I don\u2019t know anything, it\u2019s just\nwhat I heard, it all was hearsay. And my cousin was in the clean up crew and he saw my\nfather there and he told me that.",
        "A: Kabelwerk, yeah.",
        "A: Ten machines, yes.",
        "A: No, no. I was in charge of all ten machines and there was another person, another ten\nmachines and then in the back of you there were ten machines and they had to be in\noperation at all times. If not, the thing was, it was a very fine but strong thread, but if\nsomething went wrong and it skipped a stitch, you had to cut it open and, and do it again, I\nmean you really had to watch it so it would be evenly covered. And there for awhile, I just\nworked daytimes, but then, you worked one week, 12 hours daytime and the following week,\n12 hours nighttime. And they did this on purpose because you never could sleep. I mean\nthere was no way to get adjusted from one to another. So, well, we were sent back to\nPatkush Plaszow, September, \u201843.\nSylvia Green 32\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 32",
        "A: Yeah. I was in Plaszow, I was in Plaszow, and we walked from Plaszow to Kabelwerk\nfrom Plaszow, and then they concentrated us in Kabelwerk for a short time. And then, but\nby the time we were sent back to Plaszow, we did not work in Kabelwerk any more. This\nwas September, \u201843. And when I got there, well, we had to work in the concentration camp,\nwe had to open graves, pull out gold teeth and the people who were in charge of this place\nwere prisoners, German prisoners and they were completely out of control. I mean they\nwere murderers, they were in prison because they were murderers from way before the war\nand they let them out to, to oversee us. And the guy\u2019s name, Hermann [ph], oh wow, he was\ncrazy, he really was crazy. I saw Goeth many times and as soon as we heard he was walking\nin the camp, I was running away because we knew he was target shooting, he didn\u2019t care\nwhat you looked like, he was just target shooting, he wanted to see how close he could shoot\nor how far he could shoot. And Schindler was with him many times and they were drinking\nbuddies. And I really don\u2019t think Schindler, well, he saved a lot of Jews and like they say,\nwho saves one life, saves the world, but I can guarantee you this man did not start out to save\nthe Jews. He started out to, to fill his pockets and somehow I think towards the end, he\nfound out that it\u2019s a losing war they\u2019re fighting so he changed his mind. But, thank God he\ndid because he saved a lot of Jews. But this was terrible, I mean in Plaszow, whether we had\nto go outside and load railroad tracks again or in, if we worked inside, then we had to dig, I\nmean open the graves and pull out the gold teeth or we carried barracks, they were always\nSylvia Green 33\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 33\nbuilding barracks and we had to, to carry that stuff. And really my legs are my weakest, my,\nmy health problem, are my legs. You can\u2019t work like a dog, like a man, and not come out\nscarred. So we were there until, oh, I didn\u2019t tell you about my cousin, Janek Haubenstock.\nWhen we came back in September *43, people were telling me about my cousin, Janek. He\nand a little boy were walking in the concentration camp and, evidently, Goeth was walking\ntowards him and my little cousin Janek had a habit, he drove his mother crazy, when he was\nupset he would whistle. He didn\u2019t even know he did this. And somebody told me that he\nwas whistling, that, it was a Russian song or a French anthem, I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t there,\nand they arrested him right there, in \u201c43, and they built a gallow to hang him, all night long,\nand the next day they brought him out to hang him, they made his father sit in the front row,\nmy uncle, Henek Haubenstock, and the rope broke. So he sent somebody for a new rope and\nmy poor little cousin, must have been just scared to death, and he was crawling up to Goeth\u2019s\nfoot and kissing his boot. And they said that he was just hissing, Goeth took the gun out and\nshot him right there. My uncle saw it and he had a complete stroke, never came back from it\nbecause when I went up there, I went to see him in Plaszow, in that concentration camp\nwhere it all happened, he was just a vegetable.",
        "A: He was younger than I and I really don\u2019t know exactly, maybe four or five years younger,\nthis was in \u201843, I was 19, he might have been 15, 14 or 15, I don\u2019t know exactly.\nSylvia Green 34\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 34",
        "A: I did not know them very well because I was born and raised in Germany and I was not in\nPoland, I think maybe about a couple of times. My mother went to visit, but she didn\u2019t take\nus children. Somehow you take children more now than you used to, it seems like it.",
        "A: Well, this is interesting question. I don\u2019t know, really, what kept me going, the only\nthing, my aunt and I we talked all the time, and other people, too. Somebody had, had to\nsurvive to tell the world, we did not know that the world knew about it. We thought\neverybody was just ignorant about it, you know, they did not know. And I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t\nask me whether, people say you must have been very healthy. I wasn\u2019t any healthier than\nthe ones who died next to me because I had typhus, for two weeks I don\u2019t remember\nanything. I was so sick and we had to stand appell and they would drag me out, which I did\nnot know, and they stood me up, holding me up. The only thing I can think of is, my time\nwas not up. Somebody still had some purpose and also, I don\u2019t know, maybe it was a strong\nwill to live, to tell the world. But my world crumbled pretty quick after I came to the United\nStates, when I found out the world did know and didn\u2019t do a thing about it. And maybe it\nwas lucky I didn\u2019t know because I am pretty sure I would have given up, my aunt would\nhave given up. My aunt was just like my mother, we were just constantly together, really, by\nyourself you could not survive, you had to have somebody to care for\u2014your back\u2019s hurting\nnow? You okay? You had to have somebody to care for, and she did. The ration of bread\nwe got, she wanted to share with me, her portion. \u201cI\u2019m really not very hungry, Sylvia, why\nSylvia Green 35\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 35\ndon\u2019t you take this? I just couldn\u2019t eat it.\u201d I said, \u201cMuna, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou just\nwant me to have it because you know I am so hungry.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, honest, I just can\u2019t eat\nanother bite. I\u2019m just not hungry.\u201d That was my aunt. God bless her.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have much religion all during the war and after the war, oh God, I was bitter. I\nblamed God, what happened and why. And I\u2019ve still got a lot of why\u2019s, thank God I got over\nthe bitterness. The bitterness doesn\u2019t work, it eats you up alive and it, it doesn\u2019t harm the\npeople you hate. It, I couldn\u2019t even talk German after the war, a complete blank. I blocked\nit out. And my brother told me, \u201cSylvia,\u201d he said, \u201cthe German language is beautiful.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cThe German language? I connect it with Hitler, it\u2019s not beautiful, it\u2019s terrible.\u201d And\nthen to meet people who had anything to do with Germany or German descent, I had to run\naway. And this kind man helped, he was so kind, because I just wanted to shut the door and\nthat\u2019s it, not think about it and when I got married, and even after, I was an atheist, I didn\u2019t\nbelieve in anything, I really didn\u2019t. And so after I got married, I still did not talk about it to\nanybody. It was like I was ashamed of it, like some of it was my fault, you know. And I\nknew it wasn\u2019t, but somehow I just couldn\u2019t talk about it and then it was a small town with\nnot many Jewish people, I already had one monkey on my head to be a Jew in a small town,\nand, but the door would not stay shut when I got pregnant. And then it all came back, the\nnightmares and waking up screaming, not waking up, excuse me, screaming in my dreams.\nSobbing wet, Jake would wake me up, and we would come in and we sit for hours and I had\nSylvia Green 36\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 36\nto start talking and this man sat next to me, I don\u2019t know whether he listened what I said or\nwhat, but his ear was there and that\u2019s what I needed. So I was pretty lucky to have a\nwonderful husband and the children are great, they really are. They\u2019re loving, very loving. I\nsaid that in the documentary, I did not want to raise them full of hatred. In fact, they didn\u2019t\nknow much about the Holocaust till I made that documentary. I want them to, want to raise\nthem healthy, happy and, physically and mentally, and they got problems, I mean\neverybody\u2019s got problems, but the problems are not connected with my past. Because I did\nset myself a goal that if I fail, then Hitler had won out, and he didn\u2019t because they\u2019re loving\nchildren, they really are big hearts.",
        "A: But, well, September, January, \u201844, naturally, we had to line up, we had to be counted,\nand they were telling us we were going to a wonderful place, there\u2019s gonna be clean beds\nand plenty food, you\u2019re gonna to work hard, but you\u2019re gonna have it good. And my aunt\nsaid, \u201cWow, it sounds like paradise,\u201d you know. And then we were crammed into cattle\nwagon. And Krakow, Auschwitz is not that far from Krakow, but it took such a long time\nbecause the train stopped every few feet because the planes were bombing. And before we\ngot into the cattle wagon, they gave us some bread and that was all. And there was a\ncontainer with water, and one container for the bathroom. And they stopped and gosh, were\nwe pray, praying. Yeah, they jumped out of the, the trains, and they were hiding in ditches,\nthe German, and we were laughing, we really were laughing. There was a little window up\nSylvia Green 37\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 37\nin top, those cattle wagons, the old ones, and we would get on each others\u2019 shoulders to lift\nthem up to see so we could get a good laugh because they were so scared. And we yelled,\n\u201cBomb us, bomb us, come on.\u201d You know, we didn\u2019t care, we really didn\u2019t care as long as\nthey would have gotten killed. And then we went a little bit longer, to me it seemed like we\nwent the whole week, but we didn\u2019t. But you see, time was, didn\u2019t seem important at all. It\nwas just running into a day or night till the cattle wagon stopped, they opened the doors and\nthey were yelling, \u201cOut, out, out, out, out!\u201d Kicking and dogs, and we were running. And\nthen we looked and we knew where we were, because we saw the chimneys burning.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Everybody heard about Auschwitz. And you could smell the smell of human\nflesh. So, you know how they kept the records so neat, you know, they had to have orders,\nthey didn\u2019t have any orders. We arrived without orders, they didn\u2019t know what to do with\nus. So we were sitting there or standing there between the ovens, near the gate when they\nopened. And on the other side were the barracks and you sat there for 48 hours and they\nwere running like crazy. They couldn\u2019t get any orders, they didn\u2019t know whether we end up\nin the, should end up in the gas chamber or at the camp. And we just sat. And it was cold, it\nwas January. And finally there still were no orders, but then we took, I guess they were\nafraid to send us to the ovens, if the orders came that we should not been killed, they\ncouldn\u2019t bring us back after they once gassed us, you know. So then they told us to go in to\nshowers and we took the shower, naturally there\u2019s never enough water. And then we walked\nSylvia Green 38\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 38\nout in the nude, in January in Poland, shivering. And then we got prison garbs and they gave\nme wooden shoes and they make me wear those shoes, I couldn\u2019t walk in the shoes. It\nseemed like those shoes had a mind of their own. And then they put us in barracks and\nabout, well, you didn\u2019t do anything. You just laid there or you stood there and we were there\nabout 12 or 14 days, too many.\n[end of side one of tape 2]",
        "A: No, no. In Auschwitz, and I found that out later on, that you had to work there before\nthey tattooed your arm. And we didn\u2019t work there. We just were there 12, 14 days. And we\ndidn\u2019t do anything. One time we got black coffee or whatever it was, it was awful, in the\nmorning, and we had to carry, they were heavy kettles and in the evening you got the water\nsoup. So I remember that very well, it was my turn to go, and some other girls also went and\ncoming back and we were almost to our barrack and those stupid wooden shoes wouldn\u2019t\nstay on my feet and I dropped the kettle and our whole supper was there. And really I was\nscared that the people are going to kill me, the hungry people, you know, but they didn\u2019t.\nWe just all lay down and we licked the floor, whatever fell there.",
        "A: Already partially, every so often it was shaved, the hair. It was already very short before\nwe went in Auschwitz and then in Auschwitz they shaved it again, and delouse \u2018em, they\nSylvia Green 39\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 39\nsprayed you, and they deloused you with some kind of powder that they, they, they sprayed\nyou with.",
        "A: Yeah. We were liberated together. Let\u2019s see, after about 12 or 14 days in Auschwitz, we\nwere shipped back in the cattle wagon to Bergen-Belsen. And when we got to, I think 1t was\nstill January of \u201844, because we were pretty much one of the first ones there. When we came\nto Bergen-Belsen, they had nothing but tents and then there was a big storm one night and it\nwas quiet, there was no shouting and it was very quiet in comparison to Auschwitz, there\nwas so much commotion constantly. It was very quiet and my aunt said, \u201cYou know, Sylvia,\nin comparison to Auschwitz, this is a vacation.\u201d But we didn\u2019t know that was...1t was no\ngas chambers, but it was a starvation camp. They just starved you to death. So there weren\u2019t\nthat many people, but then we had a big storm and it knocked all the tents down and they\nmoved us to barracks. And they were looking for somebody who spoke a lot of languages,\nso I applied for it. I spoke German fluently, by that time already, I spoke Polish fluently, but\ncouldn\u2019t read or write it because when you\u2019re young you pick up languages, they said I\nspoke it with a heavy accent. So I applied for it and I knew about three words of French, or\nmaybe five words, and two words of Russian, so I got the job, not very long, though, but\nenough that I had a foot in the kitchen. And so I could steal food so my aunt wouldn\u2019t be\nhungry. So there were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers\nworking in the kitchen, and there were three Frenchmen. They were college students and\nSylvia Green 40\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 40\nthey worked with the underground, Gentiles, and they got caught. So they were funny, they\nwere so funny. They all spoke German and wouldn\u2019t let the German know that they spoke\nGerman. And they would sing, and they would sing the French anthem, and they would\nlaugh and they made us laugh. But the Russian people, we had to stay away from \u2018em.\nWhen when we stole food, we didn\u2019t tell on each other, but the Russians told on us when\nthey saw us stealing food. They kept to themselves pretty much, we were afraid of \u2018em. So,\nwell, I got typhus in the, back in Belsen, and Paul Lepitre, one of the Frenchmen, stole food\nand sent it to the camp, so by the time I got the food, there wasn\u2019t that much food left\nbecause she shared it with other people, but evidently 1t must have helped some. And when I\ngot better after two weeks, I noticed that I didn\u2019t have any shoes, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to \u2018em, my shoes, and I told the girl, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t go back to work in the kitchen\nwithout shoes.\u201d So Paul Lepitre stole some man\u2019s boots and sent it to the camp with a friend\nof mine. And after I went back to the kitchen, those three Frenchmen hoisted me up on their\nshoulder and they were marching and they were singing La, what is it, La Marseillaise, the\nFrench anthem. Ach, the German, I\u2019m telling you, they would get so red and yell and we\u2019d\nsay, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a stroke, he\u2019s going to have a stroke.\u201d But no, not such luck.\nAnd we were liberated April the 14\"...",
        "A: ...of \u201c45. It was really strange, by that time I wasn\u2019t working in the kitchen any more,\nnobody was working anywheres because there was no food and they already knew that they\nSylvia Green 41\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 41\nwere in bad shape because the guards were disappearing there and they came back, there was\nno place for \u2018em to go. We didn\u2019t know that, they were surrounded by the Russians, by the\nBritish and by the Americans, and there was no place to run around, so they were digging\nditches. And oh, they were angry, I\u2019m telling you, you couldn\u2019t even set a foot out, if not,\nyou got shot. So we stayed pretty much indoors and everybody was sick, no energy, no\nwater, no food and then I got dysentery problems again. I went out one night to relieve\nmyself and I felt something cold I was sitting on and I looked, it was a body and I just moved\nover. I mean, you got, evidently, you got conditioned to that. I mean, just thinking about tt,\nit blows my mind, you know. And I crawled back in. So one night, it was between 14th and\n15th, the night, or was early in the morning, we heard a lot of tanks rolling and rolling and\nrolling, we didn\u2019t know what was the matter. And it was morning and somebody came\nrunning in, \u201cWe are liberated! We are liberated!\u201d And they said, \u201cBy the British Army, we\nare liberated!\u201d Well, I crawled out there and my aunt went out there, too. I said, \u201cWhat are\nyou talking about?\u201d The German commanders, they were standing in front of the tanks, they\ntied them down evidently, I don\u2019t know. And they, with no medals, they stripped them of all\nthe medals, but I didn\u2019t see that. I still saw the Nazis, I said, \u201cWhat you talking about? Here\nthey are.\u201d And then we found out we were liberated, and I stood up, then I start singing the\nBritish anthem, God Bless the King, I remembered that from school. And, ah, there was\nsuch, so much commotion going on. They were so wonderful. And they gave us care\npackages, we didn\u2019t know how to handle those care packages, we ate everything! And that\u2019s\nSylvia Green 42\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 42\nwhy so many died, on that starvation diet for so many years and then you drank cocoa, I\nmean the powder, and coffee, you smoked cigarettes, chocolate, all at one time and sardines.\nThey meant well, I mean they didn\u2019t mean any harm. But I think that the world learned\nfrom that, whenever prisoners come back, they kind of condition them slowly with food.",
        "A: Yeah, I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember, two weeks I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember\nanything. They told me, you see, the thing about it is, they had to have a certain amount,\nthey had the number there and that number had to satisfy \u2018em. Well, they dragged me out\nand somebody called, you said, \u201cOne, two, three,\u201d you know, you called your own number,\nso somebody must have called a number for me. If not, they\u2019d be still standing there today.\nI mean, it had to be like to say 550, it had to be 550. If not, they went back in the barracks\nand they counted the dead. So they told me that they dragged me out every day and then it\ncame, I mean that\u2019s a lot of people that\u2019s, you know, lined up. They probably when it came\nto me, they just held me up.",
        "A: No, I was not in a hospital, there was no hospital there. After the war, they made a\nhospital where Himmler\u2019s palace was, in Bergen-Belsen, he had a palace there and they\nmade this into a hospital. The ones who were so sick, they took them there, but by that time,\nSylvia Green 43\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 43\nI was, I wasn\u2019t that sick any more.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, the grace of God, I don\u2019t know. I told you, my time wasn\u2019t\nup, I guess. I had to have those beautiful babies.",
        "A: Inthe camp, no. I stole food while I was in the kitchen, but then there were times we just\nlaid there. She had typhus before I had it even, my aunt. Everybody had typhus, it\u2019s a\ndysentery, but to get well, it\u2019s hard to explain with any antibiotics or anything, because now\nyou hear about typhus, everybody dies. It was like cholera, you know, a long time ago\npeople died, not many survived.",
        "A: No. That would be too much thinking, I didn\u2019t have the energy. I think I told you that\nearlier in that interview, you did what you were supposed to do and you did it and hour went\ninto hour into day and night, it... there was no difference. No, I never. The only thing, like\nsometimes we would sit around and be miserable and then somebody would say, \u201cYou\nknow, on Shabbat, Friday night? Boy, my mother set a table fit for a king.\u201d \u201cWhat did she\ncook?\u201d \u201cWell, there was fish and chicken soup and chicken and roast beef and vegetables\nand dessert.\u201d And somebody would pop up, \u201cThat\u2019s enough food, I can\u2019t eat another bite.\u201d\nYou know, really, I\u2019m not kidding, we could taste that food.\nSylvia Green 44\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 44",
        "A: No. Just blank, just a zombie. And I don\u2019t think I was the only one, I think everybody\nwas that way. I was so conditioned from the time I was nine years old until the end of the\nwar, that only thing many times you ask yourself, why, why, why? I still ask myself now,\nwhy? I said when my time comes, I\u2019m going to have a list that long and I\u2019m, when I get\nupstairs, I\u2019m going to ask Him maybe, \u201cWhy this, why that,\u201d you know. But you know\nwhat\u2019s very upsetting to me? The world didn\u2019t learn anything by it, if the world just would\nhave learned something by it. Look that ethnic cleansing now, they\u2019re killing babies. So I\nfeel like that whole thing was a waste. At least 1f people would have learned by it. But they\ndidn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, that national, the British, God Save the King. I met a British\nsoldier and I still remembered, whoever lives going to get in touch with the Urbachs in\nLexington, Kentucky. So I told him about, I had about two years of English and I didn\u2019t do\ntoo well, but I still have the letter here, I ... I was going to pull 1t out and show it to you. I\nwrote to Urbachs in Lexington, Kentucky, but we couldn\u2019t mail, I mean there was no mail\ngoing between Germany and, and America at that time. And I gave it to that British soldier I\nSylvia Green 45\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 45\nmet and he sent this letter to his mother in England and his mother, his parents, forwarded\nthat letter to America, to Urbachs, Lexington, Kentucky. And at that time, Lexington,\nKentucky was small, there were about 65,000 people, so everybody knew each other, so it\ngot there just, Leon Urbach, Lexington, Kentucky, United... USA. So my brother was in the\nAmerican Army, he, Urbach sent him an affidavit from England to come to the United States\nin 1940 and he was drafted in \u201c41. So he was still serving in the American Army, he was\nwith Intelligence, he spoke seven languages fluently. And the Urbachs got in touch with\nhim. And he came to Bergen-Belsen, and I think I told you that previously, when they came\nrunning in, telling me that my brother was out there. And I run out and all in a sudden I just\nstopped. I thought my dad was there because they look so much alike. So then he took us to\nMunich, he was stationed in Munich, my brother was stationed in Munich. And he sent an\nambulance after us, I think 1t was around October, \u201845. When he came to the camp, he\nbrought oranges, food, and ah, we, we just had a party. And my brother said, \u201cI just brought\nit for you and Aunt Mina.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t eat that by myself, not sharing it, what you talking\nabout?\u201d He didn\u2019t understand. You know, you\u2019re hungry together, you party together! So it\nwas good food, it really was. And he rented an apartment in Munich.",
        "A: It was scary, that\u2019s why I, I couldn\u2019t talk, I just stood there like paralyzed, even had a\nmustache like my dad at that time.\nSylvia Green 46\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 46",
        "A: I had no feeling, I just looked, I knew my dad was killed and I thought my dad was\nstanding there. It wasn\u2019t sadness, I just couldn\u2019t understand it, you know. They look so\nmuch alike, almost like twins. And then I was very happy. Yeah, we just grabbed and we\nhugged and... He went through his own hell, because he went in my place to England and\nall during the war, that was on his mind. He told me, he said, \u201cI\u2019m so happy that you are\nalive, I don\u2019t know how I would have managed to, to live, to know that you got killed and\nI\u2019m alive.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, my mother would talk, \u201cI wonder how Bernard is getting along,\u201d you know, but\nthat\u2019s, we didn\u2019t know. \u201cI hope he\u2019s doing okay.\u201d But we knew at that time he was in\nEngland, we didn\u2019t know he came to America. But we felt like he was safe.",
        "A: We went to Munich and he could have, he was discharged about, we came in June, he\nwas discharged about two or three months before and he could have come to the United\nStates, so he signed up as a civilian for another six months because he wanted us, he wanted\nfor us to get out of Germany. He was afraid that we weren\u2019t pushy enough probably, you\nknow. And so he stayed and he took care of all the papers and we got out about June. We\narrived in New York.\nSylvia Green 47\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 47",
        "A: Well, you come to a strange country, you\u2019re scared. People you didn\u2019t know, all right,\nthe Urbachs were related to my aunt, but they were no relations to me. No, I wasn\u2019t feeling\nnumb then. I was angry, I was full of hatred, I think I brought this up before.",

        "A: Go crazy, go wild. Eat, drink, bleach your hair blond, peroxide my hair. We didn\u2019t know\nwhether to walk on our head, we didn\u2019t know whether to walk on our feet. I mean all that\nfreedom, all in a sudden, listen, that\u2019s, that\u2019s overpowering. And my brother brought a lot of\nfood home from, oh, what do you call that, the mess hall or something, is that called mess\nhall? I think. Brought a lot of food and all his friends brought food. I guess they felt so\nsorry for us, you know.",
        "A: No, no, no. He took care of us. Well, the strangest thing, he got that apartment for us\nand he just told the Germans to get out. And they were crying and they were crying, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s\nour apartment, how we, we\u2019ve been living here.\u201d And he was not very sympathetic, he told\nthem they had to get out and some of his friends, also. We got the apartment, so while we\nalready lived in, in that apartment, they came ringing the doorbell, \u201cWe want to move back,\nthis is our apartment.\u201d So I was angry, I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Id like to see\nmy parents, too, what did you do to them?\u201d I wasn\u2019t... we weren\u2019t very sympathetic.\nSylvia Green 48\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 48",
        "A: Yeah, they left. And then they came back two or three days later on. Looking back now,\nI, I mean, it was theirs, you know, but look what they did to us. I mean, the one they killed,\nyou couldn\u2019t bring those back, could you? And this was only material things. But I told you\nI was angry, it was just all bundled up, you know, and all in a sudden it just had to explode.\nBut Munich was great, it really was. We went to museums and we went to concerts, we\nwent to the opera. He came in, because...",

Somebody\nsaid, \u201cOh, you...\u201d I used to be a blond as a child, kind of golden blond. \u201cOh, you got brown\neyes. Blond hair and brown eyes is unusual, how about bleaching?\u201d So they used peroxide.\nAnd I came to the United States as a blond. And then there was a museum, it was kind of a\nmeeting place of the survivors, and once in awhile you can meet some which you knew. I\nmean, you met people all the time, so you couldn\u2019t remember everybody, you know? But\nsometimes you run across somebody, and \u201cOh, you are here, you are here.\u201d You know,\n\u201cYou survived it.\u201d And we grabbed and we hugged and we were wild.",
        "A: In Munich, no, not really. I mean, people I was together, then I was with my brother a\nlot, my aunt was with us constantly, you see, my aunt was my best friend, there was nothing\nI couldn\u2019t tell her. And she knew exactly how I felt about things. She was my best friend,\nSylvia Green 49\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 49\nshe was my psychiatrist, and I helped her. But my brother was very good to us, he really\ntook us places and his American soldiers, his friends, were very nice. You know, we did\nmake some friends, Brechner\u00ae, he came back to Munich after the war and he opened a store\nthey had before the war. And he got us some material and we had some raincoats made. At\nthat time a lot of things were custom-made, you just couldn\u2019t go in a store, maybe house\ndresses they would sell in a store, but not like you go and you can buy suits and all that.\nThose things were custom made a long time ago.\nEnd of Tape 2.\n* Salo (\u201cSid\u201d) Brechner\nSylvia Green 50\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 50\nTape 3",
        "A: Well, not quite a year. From October until June.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, not too much. I had a lot of living to do, because I didn\u2019t live before. That\u2019s,\neverybody felt that way. We ate too much, we drank too much, we just felt like a, a bird\ncoming out the cage. It\u2019s very overpowering, all, all that freedom. You were not told what\nto do, you could walk, you could go to bed when you wanted, you had nice beds and sheets.\nI mean, things you take for granted.",
        "A: Well, I knew that we were coming to the United States, this we knew because my brother\nfilled forms out all the time, you know, and then we had to go, for examinations and you had\nto get passports. And finally, the day came when we left Germany and I think we were, we\ncame over on the ship, Marine Perch, and, from Bremerhaven. And I think we were on\nwater about 11 days because they had to stop, there were some mines, and they didn\u2019t tell us\nthey had mines in the water until they deactivated it. They didn\u2019t tell us about it, we would\nSylvia Green 51\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 51\nhave been scared to death. But I would say there were about 800 passengers, maybe with the\ncrew also, 1t was a very small ship. And it was not equipped, it was not a luxury liner. We\nhad one little room, but from the 800 people, there might have been about 40, 50 who didn\u2019t\nget sick. Most of them got sick, seasick. And my aunt was seasick. They, the younger\npeople they put in the bunk beds, and it was a great big room. And the, the food was served\nbuffet and, but my aunt, she was over 40 and she had, I think it was a semi-private room.\nThey just gave it to her, after, up to a certain age. And they ate at a table, they were served\nand my poor aunt was in bed all the trip. I went down every day to see her and I want to\nbring her some food and she said, \u201cGet out of here. I can\u2019t look at that food!\u201d So, we had a\ngood time, we entertained ourselves, the 45, 50, and it was just amazing to us, when we got\nto New York, all in a sudden those people start pouring out the ship, you know, you haven\u2019t\nseen them, \u201cHow did you get on? I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d But so many were sick. Then we had\nto wait, that you had relatives or somebody had to pick you up at the pier. They wouldn\u2019t\njust let you go loose. And my aunt and I, we waited and waited and my cousin in New York\nsupposed to pick me up. I did not know those cousins except one cousin, he was in\nKarlsruhe and he was just like my brother. At that time, first cousins were like brothers and\nsisters, very close. And he\u2019s supposed to pick me up and he just didn\u2019t show up and my aunt\nand I, we were the last ones. And, oh God, were we scared, I start crying and all in a sudden\na woman came up to me and she said, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019re Sylvia Farber, aren\u2019t you? From Karlsruhe?\u201d\nI said, \u201cYes.\u201d And she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, do you remember Berndt Weissman?\u2019 I said,\nSylvia Green 52\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 52\n\u201cYeah, I went to school with him, the, the Jewish school.\u201d He had a speech defect and the\nchildren were not very kind to him and children can be cruel. So she said, \u201cWell, I really\ndidn\u2019t have you on my list, but I looked at the list and I saw Sylvia Farber and I wanted to\ngreet you, so I switched with somebody and I want to say, welcome to America and thank\nyou for being so nice to my son, Berndt.\u201d And that kind of felt good that people\nremembered you, you know. And he was such a nice boy but the kids just didn\u2019t give him a\nchance, he was very intelligent, his father was a doctor, I don\u2019t know what happened to him,\nlost contact. So while we were talking, my cousin came with other cousins. The other\ncousins, but I didn\u2019t know the other cousins, they were waiting for that one cousin, he had to\nsign for us. And he came and he looked like a Farber, he looked like my dad, he looked like\nmy brother and we just start hugging and kissing, you know. It seemed like the Farber, the\nlooks go through the family, it\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: No, my brother didn\u2019t come until September. You see, he signed up six more months to\nmake sure to get us out. And I really loved New York, I wanted to stay there, but my brother\nwouldn\u2019t let us. My brother said, \u201cListen, we\u2019re going to make a home in Lexington,\nKentucky, it\u2019s a beautiful little town. And that way we can be together, we don\u2019t have\nparents.\u201d And I listened to him and I stayed in Lexington. Do you know where he ended\nup? New Jersey. He got his undergraduate degree from University Kentucky, he got his\nMaster\u2019s degree from Chicago, University of Chicago, he was working on his Ph.D. in, at\nSylvia Green 53\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 53\nColumbia University. And he stayed there. Then when he got married, they moved to New\nJersey.",
        "A: They really were not related to me. They were related, the one, Leon Urbach was my\naunt Mina\u2019s brother-in-law. My aunt Mina\u2019s husband Alec and Leon Urbach were brothers.\nAnd I was related to my aunt Mina through my mother. You see, so they really were not\nrelated, but they were wonderful, they were, really were wonderful.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: When he came in \u201840, he lived with Leon Urbach, then he went to Louisville and they\ngrabbed him right away in \u201841 for the Army. So they really were wonderful people and they\ntreated me better than the daughter, the daughter said. Because I was older than their\ndaughter, five and a half years, and I could stay out longer on a date. And she resented that.\nShe said, \u201cThey love you more than they love me.\u201d They really were great people. But we\ndidn\u2019t stay very long. My brother came in September and we rented an apartment and we\nlived on my brother\u2019s Army pay, ninety dollars a month, forty-five dollars rent. Water bill\nwas cheap, two dollars, electric bill and we made it, can you imagine? And we only had\nhamburger on Sundays. But we wanted to be independent, Urbachs didn\u2019t want us to leave,\nbut we wanted to get started. So my brother start teaching languages, he, he was working on\nSylvia Green 54\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 54\nhis undergraduate degree and he was tutoring in French and German and sometimes he\ndidn\u2019t go to bed until two, three o\u2019clock in the morning because he had to do his own\nhomework. And he caught the flu, he couldn\u2019t get over it and the doctor said something has\nto give, you need sleep. So I went to work for eighteen dollars a week, but that was money.",
        "A: By that time, a little bit, Urbachs, you see, we came in June and I went to work, I think it\nwas Christmas or right after Christmas. And they were nice enough to give me a job, it was\nWolf Wile\u2019s, they were Jewish people. And I think they gave me a job, they felt sorry for\nme and then I was a novelty.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s me, a young Sylvia Farber.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",

        "A: Polish refugees, there were students, they kind of messed it up a little bit, they didn\u2019t get\nit straight, some of it.\nSylvia Green 55\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 55",
        "A: Yeah. This was 9/27/46, and it was the Lexington Leader: \u201cPolish Refugee, Ex-Prisoners\nNow at Henry Clay High School.\u201d We just sat through English classes, American\nGovernment classes. And then some of the students gave up their study hour to help us learn\nhow to read, I thought it was very nice of them. And then also, when I was working, I\naudited some classes at the University Kentucky from eight till nine in the morning. And Joe\nWile\u2019s niece who went to University Kentucky, picked me up and took me to work so I\nwould be there by nine o\u2019clock. And they were very nice because I should, supposed to have\nbeen there at ten minutes to nine, but I talked to him and then he said that\u2019s alright.",
        "A: It was not the education as much, what I wanted, I wanted to learn how to speak English,\nit\u2019s very hard to think in German and then have to translate everything, it\u2019s not easy. I mean,\nwere you ever in a foreign country where you walked around with a dictionary? And my\nproblem was that I always would put the buggy before the horse somehow, the sentence\nconstruction was very difficult. And English is a very hard language, and the spelling, my\nGod, there\u2019s so many words they sound alike. Now, I wish I would have gone on to get an\neducation, I really, but the education at that time wasn\u2019t that important.",
        "A: I started out as wrapping packages and, but that April, I just felt like, you\u2019re stupid, you\ncan do better than that, you know. So I start sneaking out and waiting on customers and the\nSylvia Green 56\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 56\ncustomers loved it because I was a survivor which they never met another one and that\npublicity, I mean everybody knew about me. So I remember Joe Wile said to me, \u201cWhat are\nyou doing on the floor?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, I can do better than that, just wrap\npackages.\u201d And, well, normally a clerk couldn\u2019t have said that, but then, I didn\u2019t have the\nclothes I was supposed to wear, supposed to wear dark clothes, navy blue or gray or black. I\ndidn\u2019t have it, he told me, \u201cYou wear what you got.\u201d So he really made, made allowances\nfor me. In fact, people must have talked about this\u2014a Holocaust survivor\u2014and another\ndepartment store, Martin, the buyer, I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t think she came in to Wolf\nWile\u2019s, she must have waited outdoors or something, she came up to me and she said, \u201cI\nreally would like for you to work for Martin\u2019s. How much money do you get at Wolf\nWile\u2019s?\u201d And I said, \u201cEighteen dollars a week.\u201d She said, \u201cWe can do better than that, we\ncan pay you twenty-five dollars.\u201d So, I said, \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d So I went to Joe Wile,\nI thought that was the right thing to do because he gave me the chance. The factories where\nI applied in Lexington wouldn\u2019t hire me because I couldn\u2019t speak English fluently. Now,\nyou could sue \u2018em because you discriminated, but at that time you didn\u2019t know about suing\npeople. So I told him, I said, \u201cListen, they approached me at Martin\u2019s and they would pay\nme twenty-five dollars a week.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, 1f Martin\u2019s can pay you twenty-five, I can\ngive you twenty-five.\u201d I did feel guilty because the people I worked with, some been\nworking there ten, 20 years and didn\u2019t make more than twenty-five or twenty-seven dollars,\nbut I told him, I said, \u201cYou know, we need the money.\u201d He said, \u201cI know.\u201d So people in\nSylvia Green 57\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 57\nLexington were very nice, very decent.",

And he proposed\nbefore we got off the boat, he wanted to get married, but my aunt said, \u201cNo way, he 1s\nscared, he doesn\u2019t want to be alone to get into a country not knowing anybody.\u201d So we\ncorresponded, and we talked on the telephone sometimes. So I was telling Martha, I said,\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m dating a fellow in New York.\u201d But we had an understanding that we could date\nother people also, since we were that far apart. And she said, \u201cI really would like to.\u201d My\naunt said, \u201cWell, you have nothing to lose.\u201d So they fixed up a date, they fixed up a date,\nMartha and Jake, for eight o\u2019clock a certain day. It was eight-twenty, eight-thirty, quarter to\nnine, no Jake Green. I got undressed, I put my slack suit back on, I was madder than a\nhornet. I wasn\u2019t used to be stood up.

It\u2019s like a cul-de-sac, you\nknow, it\u2019s a circle. So that\u2019s how I met my husband and we went out dancing and I don\u2019t\nknow, the evening passed by so fast and I ask him now, I said, \u201cHow could you understand\nme, I couldn\u2019t even understand myself.\u201d He said, \u201cIt was very easy.\u201d I learned a little\nJewish, Yiddish and he knew a little Yiddish and some German and some English, we had a\nmarvelous time and we both like to dance. And we dated about a year and a half and we got\nmarried January the 16\", 1949, which is going to be 47 years, a long time.

And I just listened to him.\nWhen I had a date, even before Jake, they had to come inside the house, they had to talk to\nhim, he had to look them over whether they were good enough for his sister. But I wasn\u2019t a\nchild, I already was 23, 22, 23 years old, but he just took it on himself like he was my father.\nLike I told him, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019re stricter on me like Dad would be.\u201d But then, after we got engaged\nSylvia Green 59\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 59\nand everything was all right, he said, \u201cOh well, it\u2019s not so bad. I\u2019m not losing a sister, I\ngained a bathroom.\u201d You know, one bathroom in an apartment, two bedrooms. And I had a\nproblem after the war, I took an awful lot of baths, we didn\u2019t have a shower, I just felt dirty,\nthree, four times a day, but everything turned out all right. They were kind of worried about\nme because all that time, you know, you had lice in the camps and you were itching and it\nwas terrible. And you were dirty all the time. And even if they gave you water, on purpose,\nthey would give you soap but never let you wash off the soap, they just dumped the water\noff, they got their kicks that way, I guess.

And I kind of feel bad, this was a\nblue dress and he had it tinted green. Because I got the picture and I thanked him so much\nfor it, I said, \u201cBernard,\u201d I said, \u201cThe dress was blue.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, 1t was green.\u201d I said,\n\u201cNo, it was blue.\u201d And he kind of felt bad about it, but I really shouldn\u2019t have told him that.",

And he\u2019s wearing his\ngymnasium cap and every year they would change the band, different colors. And this is my\nhandsome dad. And I think this picture must have been taken about \u201833 because in \u201836 my\nmother went to Poland and she had some modern suits. I just go by the style, this was in \u201836,\nshe had some made in Poland and she brought \u2018em back in \u201836, and they were double\nbreasted suits, so this. . .",

I\n\u201d Little Sylvia (German)\nSylvia Green 62\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 62\nremember his spats and at times he would carry a cane, just for the fun of it. It was the style,\nI guess. He has a very kind face. Do you notice this?",
        "A: A nice smile. He had black eyes, and my brother inherited [doorbell rings] his black\neyes and mine are dark, but not as dark as theirs. Mine, my mother\u2019s eyes got a little\nmingled in there in mine. He smoked cigarettes also.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think about that. My life certainly has been interesting. It, I divided it up. This\nwas then and raising the children I really enjoyed. I didn\u2019t work outdoors, they were my\nwhole life, my children, but I wanted to, I enjoyed it. And, well, they\u2019re wonderful, we love\nthem dearly, they love us dearly, but they got their own life. And... it was a good life. And\naltogether, the only thing, I thought well, everybody has to go through some kind of hell and\nI always thought, well, I been through it early in life and the rest of the life, I got smooth\nsailing. But I guess it wasn\u2019t enough because then this came up, with my husband\u2019s illness.\nBut we\u2019re holding together. The... certain things I would love to do, I would love to travel.\nI used to travel by myself because Jake wanted to work and he really could have gone with,\nbut, with me, but in that respect, he was a small-town boy and he really didn\u2019t want to. But I\nwent to New York, I went to visit my brother, I went to Israel in \u201885 by myself, and that was\na highlight of my life because I always wanted to go to Israel when I was a member of the\nMizrachi, I was... at that time, I was going to Palestine and at the time I was five or six, and\nSylvia Green 63\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 63\nI was going to build it up single handed, I really was a Zionist.

I said, \u201cWhat you talking about?\u201d I didn\u2019t even see\nthe British. All I saw is that, \u201cThere are the Germans, don\u2019t you see \u2018em?\u201d Then\nsomebody said, \u201cNo medals, look.\u201d And I stood up, and it is amazing that I had the\nenergy to stand up, before... because we had no food. We couldn\u2019t even venture out the\nbarracks, because if they saw somebody venturing out, you just took your life into your\nhand. They were digging ditches, they were going to blow up the camp. And, really all...\nwe all were in a semi-conscious state. And I remember I crawled out, I did not walk out. I\nSylvia Green 65\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 65\ncrawled on all four. And somehow, I had the energy, I don\u2019t know where it came from, I\nstood up, and I sang God... well, the British anthem, \u201cGod Save the King.\u201d I learned that\nin school. So, they were wonderful. I think the first thing they did, they took us to\ndelousing. This camp was just completely diseased. It was typhus and lice and any kind\nof disease you want was found in there. And so many piled up that\u2019s all... the, the, the\nones that died. And so they took us to delousing, and they gave us clean clothes. And\ndelousing usually was, with the German, too, you left your... you went in through one\ndoor, you, you, you walked in the nude in the shower, and then, after you came out, and\nthey sprayed you. So then they gave us a box of food. And it was like a ration. And I\nremember I ate everything in sight. I did not know what instant coffee was, and powdered\nmilk, and sardines and cigarettes, and chocolate. That whole thing was consumed in the,\nin the few minutes.",
        "A: I already was sick, I already had dysentery. I had diarrhea, everybody did. It is\namazing that it somehow blew over, because so many died, with all that rich food, and\nyour stomach conditioned to nothing, emptiness, you know. So, I don\u2019t know, I survived.",
        "A: They were tied up. I don\u2019t know what they did with them afterwards. They burned this\ncamp we were in, and...\nSylvia Green 66\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 66",
        "A: The British. That\u2019s that diseased camp, and they gave us the German barracks. We\nwere moved right away, this was the first thing. But they felt so bad. I mean, they meant\nwell when they brought us boxes and food, and our eyes popped, you know. But they did\nnot realize what it was going to happen to people. But they learned from this mistake,\nbecause whenever they have prisoners now, United State prisoners, they don\u2019t give them\nall that food, they just gave it to them gradually, and reconditioned them gradually.",
        "A: Well, she was, yeah, she had... she had typhus before I had typhus and I got it\nafterwards. When she had typhus, I still worked in the kitchen and I stole food, and I sent\nit in with a friend, through the barbed wires, because when I worked, I was not in the\nsame camp, it was divided. So she was probably in a semi-conscious state too, because\nwe had nothing there.",

My brother was in the\nAmerican Army, and I wrote the English letter, and I gave it to a British soldier which I\ngot acquainted with. And he sent the letter to England, with his own letter. And his\nmother sent it to Urbachs in Lexington, Kentucky. I didn\u2019t remember the street, but I\nremembered the name, because my mother drilled it into us.

We just went wild.\nAnd that\u2019s why they really didn\u2019t just open the... the concentration camp gates and say,\n\u201cGo.\u201d Because, probably we wouldn\u2019t have been responsible what... what we would\nhave done. That friend of mine, we got acquainted with some British soldiers, who were\nstanding guard on the gate, and he let us ride the bike around the camp on the outside and\nI returned it. And then one morning, Halina\u2019\u00ae and I, we walked to see how far we can\nwalk. Not to get away, just... and we passed some vegetable gardens and we destroyed\nsome of it, some we stole, and then we came to a cherry orchard.

That was a cherry orchard, I don\u2019t know how many trees, full of trees. I\nhad no bag, all I could do was throw down what I could hold in my hand. Halina was\ndown and picking them up. So how much can you carry? He took the stepladder away,\nand I got stuck up on top. So, luckily, a Jeep, with British soldiers were driving by, and I\nyelled at them and told them ... I spoke a little English, I had about two years in school,\nand I told them what happened. Oh, he got so angry. He was cussing the German out, but\nthe German didn\u2019t understand English, so I translated everything for them, and he told\nhim to get that ladder, and no buts about it. And they waited till I had the ladder and I\ncame down and they said, \u201cMy God, how much could you carry in two hands?\u201d you\nknow. And they drove away. And that German really got me. He might have been about\nmaybe 60 - 65, and he said, \u201cHitler knew what he was doing. He should have killed you\nall. Look what you doing to us,\u201d you know. I got so mad, I took both hands and put it\naround his neck, and Halina said, \u201cDo it, do it, do it.\u201d And I pressed and I pressed and he\nwas getting kind of pale, and my hand, I had to let go, I couldn\u2019t do it.

And how he broke his leg, they were rounding up some people in the ghetto. Every\nso often they just picked up people and they... they\u2019d send them, probably, to Auschwitz,\nSylvia Green 73\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 73\nor Treblinka, somewheres. Well, they locked them in a room till they had the whole truck\nfull, and my dad jumped out the window. And that\u2019s how he broke his leg, and he was in\na makeshift hospital. And when they liquidated the ghetto, March the 13\", 1943, my first\ncousin, he was still alive at that time, was in the clean up crew, where they cleaned up the\nbodies, loaded it on trucks, and he told me that my dad was laying on the sidewalk, in the\nnude.

And out the blue sky, all happy, talking, dancing, and then the whole group, we\nwere to... having a Coke, or whatever it was, and she said, \u201cOh, you see Sylvia\u2019s dress?\u201d\nAnd they all looked, \u201cYes, what?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you remember I bought it last year, and I really\ndidn\u2019t like it, and I gave it to Sylvia.\u201d Now, how do you think a young girl feels? I\nwanted the... the ground to open up and swallow me up, you know?",
        "A: So one of the guys, I... I know his name was Abie Guller [ph], because I met him in\nMunich, he was in American Army, and my brother knew him from Lexington. He said,\n\u201cShirley, I remember that dress when you wore it last year. It sure looked like hell on\nyou, but Sylvia looks beautiful.\u201d I want to hug and kiss him, which I didn\u2019t, you know.\nSo, that was not very pleasant. Now, some other... there\u2019s another girl, that Strauss, I told\nSylvia Green 99\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 99\nyou Phyllis. I audited some classes at the University Kentucky, I think it was two or three\ntimes in the morning, from eight till nine. I supposed to be at work at ten minutes to nine,\nbecause I had to take the mail around to different departments. But I talked to Joe Wile,\nmy boss, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d Well, Phyllis would pick me up before eight o\u2019clock,\ntake me to class, was waiting... she was going university at that time, too... was waiting\nfor me, and took me to work. And I told her that not long ago, about three years ago, she\nlives in Boca Raton, Florida now. But Jake passed away, she donated to the synagogue.\nMy brother passed away, she donated to the synagogue. I said, \u201cYou know, you were\nsomething.\u201d I said, \u201cYou picked me up,\u201d she said, \u201cSylvia, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d So she\nsaid, \u201cSo it was not that big a deal.\u201d She said, \u201cIf I would have had classes, it\u2019d be a\ndifferent story. Evidently, I didn\u2019t have classes, so I was glad to do it.\u201d So, not everybody\nis bad, not everybody 1s good, you know. All kinds of people in this world.",
        "A: Girls, yes. I went out to lunch when I worked at Wolf Wile\u2019s, and they ate out every\nday, but I couldn\u2019t afford it. I only could eat out once a week, because the money I made\nand my... my aunt and my brother, we all pooled together. And they figured out I could\neat out once a week. So I went with them, ate out. But I went, and I had the sandwich\nwith me, and I went to restaurants with them, and they let me eat my sandwich and had a\nglass of water. I don\u2019t know whether I drank coffee at that time, or not, or milk, and paid\nSylvia Green 100\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 100\nfor that. But they didn\u2019t object, the restaurants. They knew. Yeah, I met some nice\npeople. Dating, no, not much.",
        "A: I met Jake in \u201847. I think it was September \u201847. His cousin lived a half a block from\nus, Martha Steinberg. And Mina, my aunt Mina and Martha got very close. And\nnaturally then, I was close. And she always said, \u201cI have a cousin, a first cousin.\u201d Jake\nand Martha were more like brothers and sisters, because when Jake\u2019s mother died, Jake\nwent to live with Martha and her parents, so he could say special prayers in the\nsynagogue. It\u2019s called kaddish and you need ten men, at that time. Now women count,\ntoo. And so, they felt more like brothers and sisters. And I told her, I said, \u201cWell, ?'m\ngoing with that fellow in New York.\u201d And she was just after me and after me, so George\nand I had an understanding that we were going to date other people, since we were that\nfar apart, to learn about the American way. And, so the first night we went out, he took\nme dancing, we had a marvelous time. I always said, \u201cHow could you understand me?\u201d\nWe spoke... spoke some German, some little Yiddish, sounds like German, he understood\nYiddish. And then English. He said he understood me very well. So, 1t was September\n\u201847, and we married January the 16, 49.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that... I don\u2019t remember, but I don\u2019t think I talked... we talked about it\nSylvia Green 101\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 101\nwhen we dated. I don\u2019t think so. But after we were married, we wanted children pretty\nsoon, because he was 34, I was 24, and when I got pregnant with Jerry, that was when\nthe nightmares started. And he would come with dry, clean pajamas and a towel, and he\nsponged me off with a washcloth. He changed the sheets, it just went through. The\nnightmare was the German came to take my baby away and kill it, because I saw many\nbabies killed and they did not use bullets, they just threw them against the wall, because\nthey couldn\u2019t waste bullets. So, that\u2019s when we talked, usually after I got... he got me all\ndried off and everything, we would sit on the couch in the living room, and many nights\nwe never went back to sleep, and he didn\u2019t either. And all the time I lived with that man,\nhe never complained. He didn\u2019t let me sleep, because it was even later on at times, I\nneeded to talk. His ear was always there. One time I told him, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know\nwhether you\u2019re listening, but your ear is there.\u201d I just needed the ear, you know. No, he\nwas... he was a good soul, he really was. I was fortunate.",
        "A: I\u2019m already... We got married in Laurel, we were without a rabbi, and my brother\nBernard paid for the wedding. We had a sit-down dinner, just immediate family. And he\npaid 300 dollars, and was kosher. And the rabbi performed, it was my brother\u2019s friend,\nand he hired a cantor. And I got married in a suit. I could have bought... I only could get\na wedding dress or a suit, and I was very practical and I got the suit, which I wore years\nafterwards. I\u2019ve got pictures, I got wedding pictures, I show you later on. You see, Jake\nSylvia Green 102\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 102\nwas a large family. There were... there were four children, and their wives, and his nieces\nand nephews. And Urbachs, Rose and Leon, and Grandma, Rose\u2019s mother, and my Aunt\nMina, so it was... was a crowd. But he paid for it.",
        "A: Jake was born here in Winchester. They had the business downtown. When he was\nborn, Pop, his father, already was in business. It was a small Mom and Pop store, with\neverything in there. And he was raised on top of tobacco cotton. They had those like\nbales, you know, rolled up. That\u2019s where... where... where they raised him, right on top of\nthe... the tobacco cotton. It\u2019s a miracle he didn\u2019t fall off.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. His sister was also. What happened was, he graduated from\nUniversity Kentucky, in \u201836, and he couldn\u2019t get a job. So he just fell in there, and then\nhe was too lazy to get out. So, he just stayed in there. He always said, \u201cWe never going to\nbe rich. You\u2019re going to have a roof over your head, you\u2019re going to have food on the\ntable.\u201d And that\u2019s what we had.",

        "A: Yes, what I probably was trying to say is, we in the camps talked about somebody had\nto stay alive, to tell the world what was going on in Europe. We thought the world didn\u2019t\nknow. But when I came to the United States, and I found out that they knew, Roosevelt\nknew. That that ship came with the Jewish people and they wouldn\u2019t let it in, and they\nsent it back, they got all killed. This was very upsetting. But then, in another way, I\u2019m not\na psychiatrist, but maybe I understand a little more now. I\u2019m older, maybe. That maybe it\nwas good we did not know that the world knew, because 1f we would have known, I think\nwe would have given up. This is my opinion now. What do you think, that\u2019s a possibility,\nisn\u2019t it?",

        "A: No, it\u2019s... most of the time, the way I see things now, the people have nothing to do\nwith it, it\u2019s the head of the government. The average person wants exactly the same thing.\nYou want the family, you want your children, you want a roof over your head. You want\nto be able to have enough money to send them to college, so they make something out of\nthemself. That\u2019s what the average citizen wants.

My aunt already had cancer, she was in a wheelchair, and\nshe didn\u2019t want to come to the synagogue. We were going to hire somebody and she said\nif she can\u2019t walk on her own two feet, she didn\u2019t want to go. So I called Urbachs, I said,\n\u201cYou have to come.\u201d And they came.

He...studies were very important, he wanted to make good\ngrades to get out of Winchester. And that was, I think, our doing. We wanted him out of\nhere. There wasn\u2019t much for him to do. He took, he got a degree in Political Science, and\nHistory. Undergraduate degree. And then he was turned against it. There was somebody\nSylvia Green 107\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 107\nworking in Frankfort, who made appointments with him to come, he could help him and\nhe would go there two, three times and the man wasn\u2019t there. So he got very upset over\nthat. And then he met a girl at IU, and they were dating for awhile, and then they decided\nhe was going into social work. And he went to Indianapolis. He got an undergraduate\ndegree from IU, he went to Indianapolis and got the Masters in social work. And first he\nworked for the Catholic service in Indianapolis, but now he\u2019s been with the Methodist\nHospital now, for about 18 or 19 years, or maybe getting closer to 20.

Jerry explained it to me, because she kept her mouth too wide open, and\nshe was drooling all the time, and they teach her now to close her mouth, not that wide\nopen. And she drools less, that way you can understand her. About three years ago, she\nwas in a body cast for six weeks. And all the bedrooms in this house are upstairs, so they\nbrought the, her mattress down and she was in the rec room for six weeks. They had to\nSylvia Green 108\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 108\ncarry her around. She got spoiled, but she never complained. But if she called you, she\nwanted you there. And the teachers say she is very bright. She just going to finish the\nfirst grade. And she makes pretty good grades. Eventually she will need some more\nsurgery. They had to operate on her, if not, the hip would have gone out. You see, the\nknee hit the other knee. So now, the other knee 1s doing the same thing, but the\npediatrician or... or the... the... the surgeon keep... keep a track on it. It has to be a certain\ndegree before they want to operate.

And I thought they had enough\nbackground. Sandy later belonged to a Conservative synagogue, but they only go on\nHigh Holidays and I think a lot... the rabbi has a lot to do with it. They had the rabbi,\nthat\u2019s why they joined it, he was wonderful. He was great with young people. They...\nthey went all the time, but this one, he\u2019s such a bore.

I don\u2019t know, have you ever... were you ever at services,\nJewish services, when they walk around with the Torah, and you kiss the Torah?

I think I was jealous of\nmy brother, as a child. All that attention and all the gifts. And here, I knew every speech,\nI knew his Torah reading, I knew his Haftorah reading, I knew his speech by heart, as\nwell as he did. And they made such a big deal over him. So, I don\u2019t know, in my speech\n11 years ago, I said, \u201cYou probably are asking why I\u2019m doing this now. I raised my\nchildren in a kosher home, in the Jewish religion, to the best I could. I don\u2019t know\nwhether that has anything to do with the religion, I am Bat Mitzvah, or it was jealousy. I\nhad to prove to myself I could do it.\u201d That was my speech. And I said, \u201cI doed it.\u201d But, it\nwas a lucky thing, because it helped me a lot in... after Jake died. The people are\nwonderful, they... I\u2019m almost the oldest one there, and they\u2019re all young couples, so \u2019ma\ngrandmother. And then, after Jake died, they came for a whole week here, just saying\nprayers. And you only need ten people to say prayers. Now women count, too, men and\nwomen. Sometimes we had up to 30 here, because they wanted to come. And if I don\u2019t go\non a Saturday, I miss it. I go every Saturday, even we had the little bit of snow, and they\ngot mad at me after I walked in. \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t be here, maybe you shouldn\u2019t\nbe out.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s supposed to have melted by the time I drove home.\u201d But I miss\nit, and I feel like this is my family. And in fact, I think I told you, last Saturday, they\nSylvia Green 114\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 114\ncalled me up to say a special prayer, before you read the Torah, or was it between you\nread the Torah, and I cried, I couldn\u2019t help it. And, so the one who read the Torah raf, he\nsaid, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Sylvia?\u201d And I said, \u201cI feel so alone.\u201d Yeah, they were wishing\nme a happy birthday and clapping, and in Hebrew, congratulations, you know. And so, I\ndon\u2019t know, I just looked around, there was no... I mean, there were people there, but I\nwas alone. And I told the Torahfa, he said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?

So they knew about that, and my mother\u2019s... my dad\u2019s mother, she died... let\u2019s\nsee, there was, the war broke out in \u201839, she died around that time. The war already broke\nSylvia Green 115\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 115\nout, but it was at the beginning and thank God, the way she died, it was Passover, and she\nchoked on a piece of matzo, and the whole thing was not even a split second. She must\nhave been a hundred. And can you imagine how frightened she would have been in the\ncattle wagon? So this was really a blessing. So my children did not have a grandmother,\nbecause Jake\u2019s mother died when he was nine, and my parents got killed. So that\u2019s why I\nam a Bubby. \u201cBubby\u2019 is \u2018Grandmother\u2019 in eastern Europe. So, when Sandy was pregnant\nwith Jay, she asked me whether it be all right, she never had a Bubby, whether Jay can\ncall me Bubby. The other grandmother did not want to be called Bubby, she wanted to be\ncalled Grandmama. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, if he doesn\u2019t call me... if your baby, my\ngrandchild doesn\u2019t call me anything worse, Bubby is fine.\u201d So I\u2019m still Bubby. But he\ntells me if he talks about his Bubby to his friends, I\u2019m his grandmother, not Bubby.",
        "A: No, it isn\u2019t that... no, no, it...",
        "A: They were busy. They were busy, they, they, they always had the working time, the\nschoolwork, and then, and Sandy was a girl scout, they took piano lessons. And Jerry was\na boy scout, he took piano lessons, he was on the Little League and they were busy. And\nit was good for them, and then both went to work. Jerry went to work at Kroger\u2019s when\nhe was 16, sacking groceries. One time I walk in, Jerry was washing the floor. I said,\n\u2018Jerry,\u2019 somebody dropped a watermelon. I said, \u201cHow come you don\u2019t do this at\nSylvia Green 116\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 116\nhome?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t get paid. Here I get paid.\u201d He worked for Kroger\u2019s when he\nwent away to college. Now, he never worked during a week, in high school, just on\nweekends, because the manager ask him, \u201cI need somebody during the week,\u201d and he\nsaid, \u201cMr. Hazelwick, I want to work, but this would defeat the purpose. I want to save\nmoney so I can go to college. If I don\u2019t make the grades, then I wouldn\u2019t be accepted.\u201d\nAnd he liked his honesty, and he hired him. So when Jerry came home Christmas, and\nduring the summer he worked at Kroger\u2019s till he graduated from college, and he saved\nenough money up to buy his own car. And Sandy worked at IGA as a checker, and she\nworked from the time she was 16. And she worked the graveyard shift, till 12 o\u2019clock,\nJake was waiting for her. If that be now, I wouldn\u2019t let her work the graveyard shift. Be\ntoo dangerous.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: 1949. Papa let us live in the house. There were two little houses, so he let us live in\nthe house, so it already was painted, and we just moved in. And then he gave us the\nhouse.",
        "A: No, no. This house we bought. It was a very small house and we... it was a one-\nbedroom house, and then, when I was pregnant with Sandy, we added on another\nSylvia Green 117\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 117\nbedroom, and another bathroom, but then we outgrew it again, because I had to separate\nthe kids, so we bought this house. We been living here since... we bought the house in\n\u201865. I think we moved in \u201866, because we had it all fixed up before we moved in. Painted\nand repairs and everything.",

I was going to quit before\nChristmas, because I wanted to get ready for the wedding and all that, and he ask me to\nstay till after Christmas. So I stayed till after Christmas, and then they had the sale, and\nhe ask me to stay one more day and then every time I went in there, he wanted me to\ncome back and work. And I said, \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cWe had an agreement, Jake and I, that I\nwouldn\u2019t work.\u201d I was the good Hausfrau.",
        "A: It was all right with me. I needed peace and quiet anyway. And then Jake was from\nthe old school. Listen, we go way back. It was before your time.\nSylvia Green 118\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 118",
        "A: \u201852... 1952.",
        "A: That was a very important event, because I never was a citizen of any country. I was\nborn and raised in Germany, but my father was a Polish citizen, and they would... your\nnationality was what your father\u2019s nationality was. So, in Germany, I was a Polack. Then,\nafter we lived in Poland, I was a German. So I never had a country to call my own, and\nthis was a very happy moment. I could have done it earlier, I could have done it in three\nyears, but Jake thought it was better, because Jerry already was a little older. And I did\ngood, I... I passed, I had no problems. At that time, I still had a good memory.",
        "A: I felt like an American, but I was very upset with the judge. There were a lot of\nGermans who married American soldiers, they became citizens. There was a girl from\nPoland, the American fellow she married, he said he owned a newspaper in the United\nStates, and then when she came here, she found out he was a newspaper boy, delivered\npapers. And, well, they called you up there, and you sat in front, facing the... oh, I\u2019m\nsorry... facing the people, you know, I told you I talk with my hands.",
        "A: Facing the people, and all in a sudden, he said, \u201cI notice here, you were incarcerated.\nWhat were you incarcerated for?\u201d And that\u2019s all it took. I start crying and screaming.\nSylvia Green 119\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 119\nJake said you could hear me in the back row. The only crime I ever committed was I was\nborn to Jewish parents.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I told him. The amazing part was he just... you know, was mind-boggling\nto me. And there were German frduleins there... I mean frau marrying Americans, and he\ntalked so nice to them, you know. That really... Judge Ford, he\u2019s dead, may he rest in\npeace! No, this was very upsetting to me.",
        "A: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d",
        "A: Nobody heard him. I did. I don\u2019t know, we have a friend here, a lawyer, and he was\none of my witnesses, and another friend, a neighbor, Margaret Walden, she was one of\nmy witnesses, too. Mike said he just wanted to kind of show off, you know. But I\nscreamed, I really did. And that was the only crime I committed.",
        "A: Yeah. I felt very safe, yes.",
        "A: Well, that was the only state I knew, I mean, I would go to New York, where my\nbrother was, or New Jersey, to visit, but I only lived in Kentucky. I lived in Lexington till\nI married, and then I came here, and I always lived in Winchester. I been to Israel just\nSylvia Green 120\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 120\none time.

        "A: No, no, the funny part was, I had a silk blouse, that was the style, and written Sylvia\nall over, handwritten on it. I think Pll show you a picture later on, I think I got\nenlargement there. And I was visiting my cousin for two weeks every summer, till I got\nmarried. And well, one week they could take off, the other week they couldn\u2019t take off,\nso I waited for them when they came home from work. And I wore that blouse, and a guy\npassed by and he looked, \u201cHi Sylvia, how are you?\u201d I says, \u201cDo I know you? I never met\nyou.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, you know me.\u201d You know. Then he start kind of laughing, then I look\ndown, and I saw it. And so I laughed, I said, \u201cOh, you tricked me, I forgot I wore the\nblouse with my name on there.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not a New Yorker.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m\nfrom Kentucky.\u201d And he said, \u201cI noticed the different accent.\u201d Oh, that is funny, isn\u2019t 1t?\nOh gosh.",

I had a cousin, he\u2019s gone now, cousin Harry, and that\u2019s the ones\nI stayed with when I first came to the United State, and spent one week in New York.\nAbout a couple months after we were settled, I think we still lived with Urbachs, so it\nwas about a couple months, he came to visit. He came because he was worried. He heard\nthat in Kentucky people don\u2019t wear shoes, and they don\u2019t have many Jews, and he wanted\nto see it with his own eyes, and... and to take me back to New York. I thought it was\nvery thoughtful, and very sweet, just the cousin who I met, you know. So, he fell in love\nwith Kentucky, but he wouldn\u2019t move to Kentucky, but he thought it was such a quiet\nlife. When 65,000 people were in Lexington. And, he wouldn\u2019t give up New York, so...",

And if not\nmy friends here. He took me out for three months, every day. So, I remember when I\ncame to Lexington, people drove cars, but there were not many cars. And if you were\nSylvia Green 122\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 122\ndriving, they would stop, \u201cGo on, go on.\u201d Now, since I drive myself, they... they try to\nbeat you to the stop light. It\u2019s a lot of change in... it\u2019s kind of overgrown, I think. Look\nwhat\u2019s going on in Anita Madden\u2019s... that shopping center she has, the mall. I don\u2019t\nknow, I mean, it\u2019s just overgrown. Whenever they have a new shopping mall, people\nmove out from a different place, and move there. I, I just wonder, how many shopping\nmalls do you need?",
        "A: How many restaurants?",
        "A: Never enough 1s right.",
        "A: Oh, yes. As soon as I became a citizen. And I was very nervous. I think in that old\ntape, I think, as I recall, I spoke about that Monday, a week ago. When we had to report\nto the police station, that we had to leave the country, and my mother was sick and she\nsent me instead, and as he called my mother\u2019s name and I told him my mother was sick,\nthe policeman, he yelled at me to come forward, but he yelled so loud that I was shaking\nfrom head to toe. And then he took the... and I couldn\u2019t hold the pencil or pen, whatever\nit was, in my hand, and I dropped it. And I don\u2019t know, he seemed to be satisfied, maybe\nI put the \u2018X\u2019 down there, I don\u2019t know. Ever since then, any kind of legal, took a long\ntime to overcome. Because I remember when I needed a Social Security number, it took\nSylvia Green 123\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 123\nme three hours to get enough nerve to go in there. And Rose said, \u201cNo, you have to do it\nyourself.\u201d She wanted me to do things for myself, it\u2019s so much easier to let somebody\nelse do the things, but she wanted me to learn to be independent. Took three hours. So the\nfirst time I voted, just... you have to sign your name and it was going pretty shaky. It\ntook years. Doesn\u2019t bother me any more now, but I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think I ever\nmissed an occasion, not to vote.",

I said, \u201cI can\u2019t keep my\neyes open.\u201d I\u2019m sorry. She\u2019s gone, too. She died in \u201889. That\u2019s my brother\u2019s wife. We\nwere very close. I don\u2019t know. They all gone.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: My relationship after the war was maybe closer than the average. The only trouble I\nhad with him after the war, when I was single, he was so strict, every boy had to come\ninto the apartment, he had to meet them, he had to interrogate them, whether they good\nenough for his sister. And Jake took me to Cincinnati, to a ball game, and he was going to\ntake me out. There used to be, up on a hill, it was in Kentucky, I can\u2019t remember the\nname of the restaurant, it burned down, it was more of a nightclub. And I told my Aunt\nMina we going to be late, but we were even later, because he wanted me to meet his\nbrother and his sister-in-law, and we all went out to dinner, they went with us. So, he\nthrew a fit. And in \u201848, I was 24. He threw a fit, \u201cAnd you let her go, and you let her go.\u201d\nAnd my Aunt Mina said, \u201cShe\u2019s not a child. She knows how to behave. She knows what\nSylvia Green 133\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 133\nto do, what not to do.\u201d \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what goes on,\u201d he told Mina. He had a date,\nwhich he took to Atlantic City for a weekend, that was all right, wasn\u2019t it? But not his\nsister. So this was the only object... objection I had to him.",
        "A: I think so. The thing about it was, after we met again, he said, \u201cI am so happy, you\nhave no idea. I couldn\u2019t have gone on living if you would have gotten killed.\u201d Because he\ntook my place, by going to England.",
        "A: No. No I never did. He... even my aunt and I were talk... he never could have\nsurvived it, he was a scholar. He wasn\u2019t strong. All Bernard knew, Bernard never had a\nchildhood. He was studying, and they tore him apart, because my dad wanted him to be a\nrabbi, my mother wanted him to be a college professor. He had to bring home all A\u2019s. So\npoor Bernard just studied all the time. He never could have made it. He couldn\u2019t have\nmade it in any of the camps. So, no, I wasn\u2019t angry about that, I... in fact, after we\nsurvived, Mina and I talked a lot about that, how lucky, because he would have been one\nof the first ones. And we were lucky that they sent him instead, the Jewish Welfare\nOffice. He did not go with the kindertransport, but they send him somewheres else.\nProbably with the older children, he was four years older.\nSylvia Green 134\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 134",
        "A: As a profession, he did not become a rabbi, he did not become a college professor. He\nworked for Borden\u2019s in export and imports, and he traveled for them. And, but he did\nmoonlight... he has a beautiful voice, cantorial voice. When I came back, when I buried\nhim in Paramus, New Jersey, and I told you I locked myself in the house for two days\nand two nights and cried, I played the tape over and over, I must have over ten times, and\nI said, \u201cYou going crazy, you better quit. If not, you\u2019re going to wear out the tape and\nyou\u2019re not going to have any tape.\u201d So, he had a strong, beautiful voice, and he did\nmoonlight sometimes. Like on Passover, he would go in New York, oh what was that\nplace? It was a hotel and they served food and ceremony... Grossinger. You heard of\nGrossinger, did you? No?",
        "A: It\u2019s not there any more, but it was there at one... usually well-to-do people went down\nthere, and they spent the whole week and you didn\u2019t have to make Passover. You know,\nour Passover is a week. So my sister-in-law loved it, because it was a lot less work for\nher. And he used to conduct services, and then the seder he conducted. He loved to do\nthat, but not as a profession.",
        "A: Oh, he just died four days before Thanksgiving.\nSylvia Green 135\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 135",
        "A: \u201898, yeah.",
        "A: And I\u2019m so happy I was there to see him two months before. And his mind was gone.\nSo when his daughter, Sharon, picked me up at the airport, I said, \u201cCould we stop by?\u201d It\nwas about eight o\u2019clock. She said, \u201cSure.\u201d So we stopped by, and the kids bought him a\nLazy Boy, and he was asleep, and I walked in, and he was hard of hearing, too, and he\ncouldn\u2019t... the hearing aids, he lost them and lost them and then they didn\u2019t help any,\nanyway. So I whispered in his ear, \u201cBernard, Bernard, you lazy boy, wake up. Your sister\nSylvia is here.\u201d About three or four time, I repeated that, and all in a sudden, you should\nhave seen his face. Before, he was pale, flushed, his eyes, there was recognition, and a\nsmile from ear to ear. And Sharon said, \u201cYou know something? I haven\u2019t seen Daddy\nsmile like that since Mama died.\u201d But that was the only recognition, then I was \u201cHey\nyou,\u201d or \u201cI want to do this, I want to do that.\u201d And when Sharon... before we went to the\nairport, I... this time I stayed two days, because it Just wore me out, just fly in and fly out\nSunday. So I, I flew in Thursday, and I was just... because before, I stayed with him all\nday, and she picked me up just to go to bed at her house. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting too hard\nfor you, and you just stay a half a day,\u201d but I stayed all day Friday, I stayed all day\nSaturday, and before we went to the airport, I said, \u201cDo you think you could, we could\nstop by?\u201d She said, \u201cSure. We can leave about an hour earlier, and you can stay with\nhim.\u201d So, when I walked in, he said... the day before, we thought he was going to die.\nSylvia Green 136\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 136\nWalked in there, \u201cI want to get dressed.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, you going to get dressed.\u201d I took\nsome clothes and I matched up things. He looked sharp, he really did. And I was going to\nshave him, but his electric shaver didn\u2019t work, and I wouldn\u2019t use a straight razor, he was\na severe diabetic. But I combed his hair, I washed his face. He said, \u201cI want to eat in the\ndining room.\u201d He hasn\u2019t eaten in the dining room, I don\u2019t remember when. I took him to\nthe dining room in a wheelchair, and sat down next to him. And they wouldn\u2019t give him\nany bread any more, because he would wad it up, put it in his mouth, and he\u2019d choke. So\nhe saw the bread and he pointed, and his face lit up. So I broke it up in a million little\npieces. And then he ate, and I kissed him good-bye. It didn\u2019t bother him that I left, he\ndidn\u2019t know. But I\u2019m just happy I saw him two months before, and this... to recognize\nhim, that he recognized me, this is something I cherish. But he left three beautiful girls.\nNice son-in-laws. Good girls. One is going to make Aliyah, she\u2019s moving to Israel.",
        "A: Yeah, I laughed about it. No, that\u2019s become home, you know. He left here, graduated,\nundergraduate degree from University Kentucky, so he was with us. And then he went to\nChicago, and he worked on his Master\u2019s in Chicago. And I went to visit him in \u201c48. My\nparents had some friends who survived, who lived in Chicago, and I stayed with them for\ntwo weeks. And then he went to Columbia University. And he had enough credit for\neverything, but he didn\u2019t finish his thesis, he got involved with a girl and got engaged,\nSylvia Green 137\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 137\nand it was a mess. But thank God he saw it ahead of time, that he called the engagement\noff. It wouldn\u2019t have worked.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s... I finally let go of it. Took a long time, it was a gradual thing. And\nanybody had any connection with Germany or even probably 20 generation way back in\nGermany, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And even the language, I don\u2019t speak\nGerman. Maybe I could, I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t do it. I think I build a mental block,\nand even my brother Bernard used to say, Germany was there before Hitler, but when\nHitler came to power, I only was nine years old, so to me, the German language was\nHitler. So, but that\u2019s gone now, I think.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t have any desire.",
        "A: The other... no, mm-mm. I don\u2019t have that happy memories about Poland, either. And\nthen the Polish Gentiles were very anti-Semitic. They collaborated with the Germans.\nThey were very happy to collaborate with the Germans. So, no, there are other places I\nwould like to go. I would like to go back to Israel, but I don\u2019t know if... ?ve got some\nSylvia Green 138\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 138\nproblems with my legs. Maybe if I win the lottery and I could fly first-class, then I would\ngo.",
        "A: Oh, at the... yeah, the Kroger\u2019s.",
        "A: Well, I have known her. She\u2019s been here as long as I have, over 50 years. She was\nfrom Germany, and maybe a hundred miles away from my hometown, she was... she\u2019s,\nwas from Mannheim. And some relatives of Jake wanted me to meet her, they thought\nthat she was such a lovely lady, and she probably was, but I didn\u2019t want to meet her,\nbecause with the German connection. And for years I didn\u2019t meet her. If I saw her, I\nwould run across the street, just not to have to see her. So then, finally, we did meet and\nwe talked some, and I always said, \u201cShe seems nice enough, she couldn\u2019t be my best\nfriend.\u201d And I don\u2019t know whether I would want her as my best friend, because then it\u2019s\nGerman again, you know. But I was at Kroger\u2019s, oh it was, I don\u2019t know, November,\nDecember, and we were talking about something and it came up, the past, and she starts\nsobbing and she start crying, and automatically, I cradled her in my arms. I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it, I mean, that was such a automatic gesture, you know. I just couldn\u2019t believe it.\nSo when I came home, I called Sandy. I said, \u201cYou won\u2019t believe it. I was comforting\nLilo Thomps... Thompson.\u201d She said, \u201cMom, you\u2019ve come a long ways.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I\nSylvia Green 139\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 139\nhave.\u201d But I did tell her also, I said, \u201cListen, we were born at the wrong time, at the\nwrong place.\u201d Now, I couldn\u2019t have felt that way a few years back, and it\u2019s true.",
        "A: It\u2019s, it\u2019s gone...",
        "A: ...well, it\u2019s kind-of subsided, thank God. Like I said, that I\u2019ve, I feel like there\u2019s a\nload off my shoulders, you know, like you carry the world on your shoulders. Thank God\nit\u2019s not there any more.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know. It\u2019s... the few years I have left, I like to live them\nout, not with hatred, and it\u2019s even hard enough just to be alone now. Living isn\u2019t easy.\nSo, I don\u2019t know when it left me, I Just hope it stays away.",
        "A: It was January the ninth, \u201897, and we both have a living will, but I... I wanted him\nback, so I called 911, and they start working on him. And I called the children, they told\nme to call the children. They found a very slight pulse. So I called Jerry, then I called\nSandy, Sandy said, \u201cHang up, I call right back and leave the line open.\u201d So I did, so she\nheard everything what went on. So, I was so fortunate that night, because my doctor, Dr.\nSylvia Green 140\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 140\nPika was on call that night, and she was called in, and she stayed with me. And Sandy\ncalled a friend to stay in the hospital with me. And so Dr. Pika told that friend, Ava\nTyler, \u201cMiss Tyler,\u201d she didn\u2019t know Ava, \u201cI like to ask a favor of you, would you\nplease spend the night with Mrs. Green? I don\u2019t want her alone.\u201d So, I\u2019m very fortunate\nto have a caring doctor like she is. And she\u2019s only about 32-33 years old, with two\nchildren. She had those while she already was, was in practice. So, she prepared me so,\nbecause they were working at, with Jake at the hospital, in emergency room. And she\nwould come back and forth, to see how I was. And after about a half an hour, she said,\n\u201cMiss Green, you don\u2019t want him back. If he would come back now, he\u2019d be brain-dead\nand you wouldn\u2019t want him, he wouldn\u2019t want it.\u201d I think he already was gone when she\ncame in telling me that.",
        "A: For the first time...",
        "A: Yeah, and it was in the Jewish Community Center. And the only reason I did it was\nbecause my foster brother asked me. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.",
        "A: Stuart...\nSylvia Green 141\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 141",
        "A: Dr. Stuart Urbach, yeah.",
        "A: Well, nerve-racking, that\u2019s all I can say. I didn\u2019t sleep. I might have slept about five\nhours in three nights. And I don\u2019t know. When I got up there, I mentioned, first I\nmentioned my name and then I told them that I never spoke in public, that I have given\ninterviews in the comfort of my own home, but I told them I was very nervous. And well,\nI did it.",
        "A: Well, that was strange, because when I walked in, we were a little late, and Leah was\nkinda on edge. I said, \u201cYou thought I\u2019d be a no-show, huh?\u201d",
        "A: Like I talked to you on the telephone, Dr., Dr. Dickstein, yeah. So she said, \u201cNo, I just\nwant to show you where you stand and which side you get on the stage, and I\u2019m going to\nget on the other one, I will introduce you.\u201d And I looked around, I said, \u201cLeah,\u201d I said,\n\u201cthere are over a thousand people here.\u201d She said, \u201cThat can\u2019t be, because it only holds\n250.\u201d I swear it looked like over a thousand. But then I got the letter from the Federation\nand they said there were 450 people, that there were chairs all around, then the lobby, a\nlot of people were there.",
        "A: What?\nSylvia Green 142\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 142",
        "A: No, the Community Center.",
        "A: It\u2019s the Jewish Community Center. But the, the Jewish Federation is in charge of it.\nAnd Leah, she... Dr. Dickstein organized the whole thing.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know. She said it was a wonderful attendance, and she said there were a\nlot of Gentiles and a lot of children. And the children are important, because they never\nheard of it, they didn\u2019t know anything about it. So that\u2019s the ones we have to teach. We\nhave a Yom Shoah day in Lexington. Sometimes you have more people than other times.\nSo I don\u2019t know, they had one here, I think Tuesday, and I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t ask...\nfind out how many people there were.",
        "A: It still, 1t still upsets me. You can see it does. Sometimes I wish it\u2019d just go away. But\nthe only way it\u2019s going to go away, when I go away. That\u2019s the only way.",
        "A: Well, people should know, but...\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B\nSylvia Green 143\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 143",
        "A: I, I just said, maybe I\u2019m selfish, it just still gets me upset, and I don\u2019t like to be upset. I\nwould like to live my life out in peace. And see it... the past, I feel like I\u2019ve lived more\nthan two lives. And really, the life right now is not easy, either. Looking back, if Jake\nwould have lived, we would have been married 50 years in January. And I always\nthought that... well, everybody goes through some kind of hell in life. You\u2019re not\npromised a rose garden, and I always felt like, well, you\u2019ve gone through your hell at a\nvery young age, and everything was smooth, everything was fine. We had no problems\nhere, the marriage was good, the children were wonderful, and then, then it hit again.",
        "A: Well, Jake passed away, it hit me again. I just thought maybe I will have smooth\nsailing the rest of my life, but there\u2019s no guarantee.",
        "A: Goals. I hope and pray, and I pray all the time, I hope when my time comes, it be\nquick. I hope I'll be able to take care of myself and don\u2019t have to be a burden to my\nchildren. This bothers me. And that\u2019s my goal. Otherwise, what kind of goal? I mean, I\nenjoy working in the hospital, I got good relationship with the people I work in, and\nknow everybody there.",
        "A: Yeah, eight and a half hours. I get there by... well, I used to at eight o\u2019clock, but\nSylvia Green 144\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 144\nthen, there\u2019s so much traffic on Boone Avenue when school is in session, if I try to get\nout here ten to eight, to be in the hospital at eight, I can sit 20 minutes and can\u2019t even get\nout my driveway. So it\u2019s worthwhile for me to get up a half an hour earlier and leave here\nabout 7:30. But then, we have other things. We have bake sales, we have book sales. And\nin the morning, I... what I do is like a gopher. Anything they ask, we, we do. And then,\nthe afternoon, I go to the gift shop, because in the morning it\u2019s a lot of running around.\nAnd my legs don\u2019t take it as well, so when I get in the gift shop, then it\u2019s more relaxing,\nexcept when we have Beanie Babies, then it\u2019s not very relaxing. There\u2019s... people still go\nwild over the Beanie Babies.",
        "A: Clark Regional Medical Center.",
        "A: Here in Winchester, yes.",
        "A: Well, take somebody else\u2019s place. Like somebody goes out of town, like I was out of\ntown Monday, so somebody fills in what I do. So, if they go out of town, then I fill in\nwhat they do. And then, the only bad thing is that I don\u2019t drive at night, because we really\ngot a lot going on in the synagogue, but it\u2019s always at night. And I have that horror\ngetting stuck on Interstate 64, with a flat tire, or the car stops. So, I do have a car phone,\nI... I don\u2019t know, it just... 1t\u2019d be scary. So I don\u2019t go after dark. I do in town, I drive.\nSylvia Green 145\nJanuary 11, 1996\nPage 145\nI\u2019m a member of AARP, and we meet in the evening.",
