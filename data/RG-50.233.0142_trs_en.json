        "Q: My name is David Yegher. It\u2019s spelled right now Yegher but it used to be J.\nJegher. My name before the war at home, I was called Chaim David and I was\nborn in a town called Ronadeyjus in Transylvania in the Carpathian Mountains in\nRomania.",
        "A: What was the year of your birth?",
        "Q: September 17, 1927. I was living at home with my mother and father and we\nwere a family of six children, three girls and three boys. My two older sisters\nwere married. One was living in a city called Siget and she had two children.\nShe married a man by the name of Ignatz Hershkowitz. My second older sister\nwas married and I don\u2019t remember his name. I know Ashmael but I don\u2019t\nremember the family name. Anyway the whole problem started with all the\nsuffering we endured. I was thirteen years old when we couldn\u2019t go from town to\ntown and we had to register and we had to close the front windows to the house\nfacing the street. Jews couldn\u2019t travel on trains. It was long- suffering and one\nday the military came in. It was a Friday afternoon. My mother was cooking the\nShabbos dinner.",
        "Q: This was in 1940 about?",
        "A: In 1944 and my mother was cooking the Shabbos dinner and of course we were\nall at home because we were not allowed to go anyplace and they told us\nwhatever we can carry to make a package. We have to go with them.",
        "Q: Were these iron guards who came or were these gendarmes or the military? Do\nyou recall?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. I just don\u2019t remember. All I know is that when we were\nleaving, whatever, we made a package that everybody could carry, whatever you\ncould carry. My mother was crying and telling my father, this is what we worked\nall our lives. This is what we worked and tried to make a family life and try to\nmake, you know, to eventually be able to achieve something and now we have\neverything. What we have now is just what we can carry 1n our bags. We had a\nvery prosperous farm, orchard with trees. We had cattle, but my father was also\nwhat I would call it -------- transportation or something. What it was. There was\nno cars, it was primitive, there was no cars, no machineries but when anybody\n1\nwanted to go into the city my father drove two horses with a wagon that people\ngot on the wagon to go to the city.",
        "Q: What city would you go to?",
        "A: To Siget. And anybody wanted to come back, they also got on the wagon and\nthey came back and he was passing a few towns on the way until we got where\nwe were living. Also on the way to Siget in the morning there was country stores\nall in these villages, towns that my father stopped and got a list from the country\nstores whatever it needed and he went into Siget, bought it, brought it to them so\nthey would have the things they were looking for, they need.",
        "Q: So he made regular trips?",
        "A: Every day except Shabbos.",
        "Q: These people would pay him for the ride into Siget?",
        "A: Yeah. So in other words there were many things that pertained to conduct a way\nof making a living. For instance, one way is to have transportation for people to\nbring them into the city and also back. And also on the way into the city, the\nfarmers who had cows or sheep that milk, they had it in containers and we took\nthe containers from them and we took it into the main creamery in the city and\nthey made cream, whipped cream, butter and then we brought the empty\ncontainers back and we dropped them off. We did this six days a week. One way\nof making a living was taking in the milk which was also from our farm and from\nthe other farmers and picking up the list from the country store...",
        "Q: Of their needs.",
        "A: Of their needs, and a country store was not just anything like you have a store\nhere. I mean a country store over there, we bought petroleum, we bought\nwhiskey, we bought flour, we bought whatever in the world it was. A general\nstore everything that the farmers or the people in the villages needed. And that\nwas usually the only store and therefore there were no separate stores for this or\nseparate stores for that. So this is what we did.",
        "Q: This was two horses. It must have been a pretty large wagon?",
        "A: Yeah, it was. You could seat at least twenty people.",
        "Q: How long was the journey from your town to Siget?",
        "A: About an hour and a half, two hours. Also it was big because of the hills and the\nmountains which you have to go through. There was very steep hill that it was\nvery difficult to get up in the winter time or even when you had on the way from\n2\nthe city that you were bringing back to the people flour and petroleum. This was\nvery heavy. When you loaded up the wagon it weighed like a railroad car and to\npull up the steep hills, to cross over into the villages, it was very, very difficult.",
        "Q: I suppose you had to help pull or push the wagon, or did the horses manage?",
        "A: The horses pushed and you put your elbow and you pushed along with them and a\nlot of times depending on the weather you just didn\u2019t have enough power to pull\nit. So we went to the nearby farm and they came in and lend us another horse or\ntwo that we put up to help pull over the mountain. Just as hard as it was going to\nget up on the mountain, it was just as difficult getting down, to hold back all that\nweight. And you got to the point where you were about holding it to the middle\nof the mountain going down and then you just lost control and it would just shoot\ndown and anything happen. It was God\u2019s will. Sometimes the horses were trying\nto hold it back. They held it back as much as they could and then they just used to\njust like slide down on the hind legs on the ground and the weight from the wagon\nwas just pulling them down and sometime one horse was holding back so hard\nthat they pulled the whole wagon into the ditch on the side where the water was\nrunning. Then we had a hard time. We had to unload it, put everything on the\nstreet and get the wagon out and load it up again. It was a very hard life but it\nwas home. I mean we had a very, very strong family unity. And we always --\nsometimes it was very little to eat and sometimes whatever it was we sat at a table\nand we shared. And my mother, may she rest in peace, she always fed everybody\nand sometimes there wasn\u2019t anything left and she just went without. And I saw\nthat myself.",
        "Q: Where were you in the range of children? Were you one of the youngest?",
        "A: No, I was the fourth one. Then, of course, I had relatives. I had, of course,\ngrandparents. My mother\u2019s side lived in the same town where we lived. And, of\ncourse, my father\u2019s parents lived with us. My grandfather, both of my\ngrandfathers had died.",
        "Q: While you were a kid they died or even before you were born?",
        "A: They died before the problem started. But my grandmother, my father\u2019s mother,\nshe was in bed all the time, she was something wrong with her, and of course we\ncarried her to the train when we were leaving. And we took her and she was in\nthe wagon even when we went to Auschwitz. And of course my other\ngrandmother was still walking. Then my father had one brother and three sisters.",
        "Q: All living in Ronadejus?",
        "A: Two of them were living in Ronadejus. The others were living in some other\ntowns. My mother had a brother and two sisters. Her brother luckily enough\nbefore all this trouble started, he emigrated to Argentina and his children, I mean\n3\nmy uncle, I happened to see him after the war. He moved from Argentina to\nIsrael and he died just about a couple of years ago now. But his children, my\ncousins, are still living now. But my mother\u2019s two sisters, the husbands and the\nchildren, they all perished in Auschwitz My father was, they were very poor\nwhen they got married. They didn\u2019t have anything. He started all of this so-\ncalled enterprises, whatever, a way that was needed and in order to be able to\nsupport the family and the money that he made from this -- taking all these things\nto the villages and into the town and everything else, we bought land. We had\nbeautiful orchards with apples, pears, plums. We ended up making our own\nwhiskey because I remember big, big drums like they have gas storage tanks that\nthey used to put in all the fruit. And there was a little thing coming out from the\nbottom after whatever long it took, and the whiskey was coming out and we made\nour own wine and we also made our own dried fruit. And we sold it not only to\nthe markets in Romania at the time but we also sold it to the neighboring\ncountries like Czechoslovakia and Hungary and this and that.",
        "Q: How did you manage to sell to other countries? Was there a co-op set up?",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "Q: So you must have produced a mass of dried fruit, a fairly large amount?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I remember when I was a little boy that in the summertime, whatever\nmanure from the cows was piled up in big piles. And in the wintertime when the\nsnow was you chopped it up in chunks and you loaded it in a sled and you hauled\nit into the fields for fertilizer. During the daytime my father was taking care of\nwhatever he had to do the business of, I don\u2019t know what would you call that,\ntransportation or whatever. And at nighttime we worked in the fields.",
        "Q: Is that right?",
        "A: You\u2019d better believe it. I mean that was the kind of situation. There was no\nclock, there was no nothing. You devoted your whole time working in the fields.\nAnd then, of course, when the summer came, you have to plow it and you plowed\nit with the horses not with tractors. Every time you cleared more trees to make\nmore land, clearing for farm land to be able to. One time my oldest brother was\nalready taken from us into what they called forced labor by the Hungarians\nbecause during my time when I was going in school which reminds me another\nsituation. When I was going in school and I was four years in public school.",
        "Q: This was Romanian public school?",
        "A: Romanian public schools. I had very little time to do my homework because\nwhen I came home I had to do the chores in the fields.",
        "Q: Did you have specific duties?\n4",
        "A: Yes I had to clean all the stables and see that the milking cows were fed. And my\nsister did my homework. As a matter of fact, when we started school, I flunked\nthe first year because I never did my homework. But my sister that was a year\nyounger from me, she started school the following year and she did her homework\nand she did my homework. But I was bright enough that I really did very well not\nfrom studying at home, just for being in school and doing it when the teacher was\ndoing the stuff. Then the problem came when the Hungarian took over that part.\nI started the fifth year in school with a Hungarian teacher that only spoke\nHungarian. I never spoke Hungarian in my life.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a foreign language to many people.",
        "A: Yes and what happened was, I was very good in arithmetic. We used to have tests\nlike who could answer faster like five times five, five times three, eight times\nnine. I always was the winner. But we had the test in Hungarian and I lost\nbecause I had to transfer the Hungarian to Romanian or to Yiddish. Even today\nwhen I am figuring a bill, when I had my catering, people used to always be\namazed because I figured in Yiddish, always.",
        "Q: Is that what you spoke at home, Yiddish?",
        "A: Only Yiddish. We spoke Yiddish at home and I spoke Romanian in school. And\nthen in the fifth year I had to learn Hungarian. And it was a very hard thing. And\none of the things that really hurt me --\u2014- when we were leaving the house, when\nthey were taking us to --- they took us to the ghetto, there was one of the guys\nwho was my best friend all my life.",
        "Q: A Jewish guy?",
        "A: No, a gentile. His father was the post office man. He delivered the mail. We\nwere very close friends. We were practically every day together. When I was\nleaving, when we were taken, I had on a red sweater with no sleeves. It was man-\nmade. The guy that was taking us told me to take my sweater off. Would you\nbelieve it I saw him take my sweater, he took it with a stick ---",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t want to touch it.",
        "A: And he gave it to my best friend because my best friend asked him to get it for\nhim. And he was wearing a rifle but it was not a real one. It was made out of\nwood just so that he had the authority. This is something that I could never\nbelieve. I never went back there and if I ever do I\u2019m gonna take a sweater off\nhim. If it\u2019s the last thing in my life I\u2019m gonna do.",
        "Q: Were there many Jews in that community? What was the breakdown in terms of\ngentiles and Jews in your town?\n5",
        "A: There was about, for that time of the world it was considered to be a lot. It was\ntwo hundred families. And there was about half of them, Jews. There was only\none main street that the whole town consisted of, but there was a lot of homes in\nthe back fields and in the woods. Most of the homes, I would say seventy-five\npercent that were built on the main road were Jewish people. The Jewish people\nhad more or less -- 1t was even in those days like we had a kitchen that we were,\nyou know the floor was nothing but a mud floor because I remember my mother\nonce a week used to bring mud and make it soft with water and just take the hand\nand go over and give it a fresh go-over. But still in all 1t had a table and chairs\nand we were eating with knives and forks and we had kosher dairy dishes and\nmeat dishes. My father was very religious. My mother was ---",
        "Q: Chassid or ---?",
        "A: Well, I never knew the word Chassid at the time but I do know I never saw\nanybody anywhere in America or anywhere I have been that could have been\nmore religious than my father. My mother wore what they call a sheitl and I\nremember when my sisters got married they cut their hair. And they cried. I\nremember that. We lived, for instance, a lot of the gentiles that were living in that\narea, they had a house. But their house consisted of four walls and in the corner\nwas a bed and in the other corner was a stove which was heated with wood. In\nthe wintertime they kept this wood going, the stove. This is how they heated and\nthey all slept in one bed and all around, whatever. But we had beds. We were\ncivilized people. We had beds. Everybody had their own bed. We might had a\nroom where we had three kids sleeping in the same room, whatever, but we had\nbeds and we each had a bed.",
        "Q: Was this one floor this house, one story?",
        "A: Yeah, one floor. In the summertime we still continued, for instance, we had our\nown, like they call here a pizza oven, we had one that was built out of brick. And\nwe heated it with wood, made it hot, and the oven got hot and my mother baked\nbread and also she put Friday in the cholent for Shabbos and she put it in the oven\nwith the coal created by the wood and you can imagine if a woman today would\nhave to go out and get wood and create the oven, this baker oven, which was like\na huge boiler which was built out of stone and brick. You bring the wood and you\nput it in and you light the fire and you create coal and when it\u2019s hot enough you\nput in all the pots and have like a 24 by 36 opening and you sealed it and you used\nwet mud to seal it so the heat will not escape, and then you opened that Saturday\nafter you come home from shul and that\u2019s what we ate Saturday, the cholent and\nthe kugel and all that and it was always very delicious. There\u2019s nothing ever\ncomparising to that.",
        "Q: Was this oven outside the house?\n6",
        "A: No, it was a corner of the house. Like let\u2019s say when you come in from the front,\nthe front part like three-quarters was the kitchen and then there was a wall with a\ndoor that you went into the other room, that was the other corner of the house.\nThat corner was built where the baker-oven was built. It had a big chimney going\nup and this is how my mother baked the bread and put the food in for the cholent\nand things like that. And we had a wooden stove in the kitchen which was lined\nwith brick. This was how we cooked and this is how we heated the winter. When\nyou went to sleep and I\u2019m telling you it was bitter cold, none of the rooms were\never heated, wherever you went to sleep but you never had to worry because you\nhad feather quilts. You was really in no problem.",
        "Q: Did you attend cheder?",
        "A: Oh yes, I attended it\u2019s not a cheder. I mean I didn\u2019t have to be in public school\nuntil nine o\u2019clock so I started cheder in the morning like 6:30. Then when I\nfinished cheder my mother waited for me to give me something to eat and I was\neating while I walked to public school. And when I got out of public school again\nshe waited for me to give me something to eat and then I went to cheder till nine\no\u2019clock at night.",
        "Q: So morning and night you went?",
        "A: Yeah and I also of course had a lot of Shabbos. You know they had teachers and\nlectures and things like that. And I spent a whole day in cheder, Sunday, because\nthere was no public school.",
        "Q: And your chores on top of all of that.",
        "A: Chores on top of that. And of course, then they took us to the ghetto.",
        "Q: This was the Ordea ghetto, the Siget ghetto or Ordea?",
        "A: Well, it was across the river. It was in Czechoslovakia. It\u2019s called Slotyna,\nSolopvina in Yiddish. That\u2019s where they got all the Jews from the whole area\nbecause when the Hungarian came in, they already had occupied Czechoslovakia,\nit was Hungary. Then when they came in, took over the Carpathian Mountain it\nbecame Hungary, too. So all of it was already one and when they got the Jews\nfrom all the towns and from the big city, from Siget they formed the ghetto in\nwhat used to be Czechoslovakia. It used to be Slotyna and in Yiddish they used\nto refer to as Solopvina. They cramped us in. They took a section of the town, of\nthe thing, and they made a ghetto. They moved all the gentiles out and they took\nwhatever it was and they cramped us in, ten ina room. There was no such a thing\nas a bed or anything.",
        "Q: When in 1944 were you taken from your home?\n7",
        "A: I am for one terribly ---",
        "Q: Okay I can verify that because we have start times for the ghettos and end times\nfor the ghettos.",
        "A: One thing I just don\u2019t remember dates. I just know what happened. So when we\nwere in the ghetto in Solopvina we had tremendous suffering because aside from\neverything, sleeping on the floor and things like that, we just didn\u2019t have food.\nWe were really suffering. And so I endangered my life by sneaking out from the\nghetto. The way I did it, there was somebody going through because you see you\nhave to go through guards and they checked everything. The traffic still people\nwere going on the main road. We were not allowed to get near the main road.",
        "Q: Was there a fence around the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah, oh sure, there was a fence around the ghetto and there was guards around\nthe ghetto and also where the main road was that went through the ghetto that was\nalso blocked off. If you had a house you had to block the windows, board it off.\nAnd there was a fence that had to be made higher so nobody could get over it.\nBut I went over it and I saw a wagon with two horses. There were just wagons\nand horses that the local people were still using. So what happened there is a long\npiece of wood that holds together the front wheels with the back wheels, that\u2019s in\nthe bottom like. And I put my legs onto that under the wagon and my hands and I\nwent through the checkpoint and when I got on the other side I went into the town\nwhere we were living. I guess whatever it was at that day I told them that we\nwere being held in such and such a place and that we don\u2019t have food and we\u2019re\nstarving and this and that. I was able to manage to get a wagon from somebody\nand I had a lot of people -- because you see my father was very honored and\nrespected because of all the transactions and all the things that we did for the town\nand for all the other towns so everybody knew because if you wanted to send\nsomething to the city you got my father to carry it. If you wanted to bring\nsomething home, you got my father to carry it. So we were very well known. So\nwhen I came into the town and told them we\u2019re starving and I had a wagon, I had\nfrom the farmers, they brought me all kinds of things and I loaded up a whole\nwagon.",
        "Q: You were able to get back to your old town?",
        "A: I got back to my old town but when I got into town I kept asking where the\nGestapo was to make sure I don\u2019t run into them. And some of the people even\nhelped me stay out so they couldn\u2019t reach me. And I loaded one of these big\nwagons and I mean full with everything, with corn and potatoes and mostly that.\nI found two horses that used to belong to us. Of course I recognized them and I\ngot them and I hitched them up and would you believe it I drove in through the\ncheckpoint and I was inside already and when I did, I wanted to get in. You know\neverything was blocked off.\n8",
        "Q: The ghetto itself was blocked off?",
        "A: The ghetto, the main road, everything was fences. In order for me to be able to do\nthis, I broke open whatever I was able to do, a gate. And I got in the ghetto and I\ndrove to where my mother and father were and what happened was my mother\nwas so worried and so nervous and upset she used to bite the back of her hand to\nkeep her --- she bit off her flesh because she was so upset. And when I got there I\nyelled quickly whoever was available to unload quickly the wagon. And when I\ndid that after it was unloaded I took the two horses and the wagon back to the\nmain road and I slapped them 1n the back and I let them go. And nobody ever\nfound out.",
        "Q: Did your mother know you were going to do that?",
        "A: Are you kidding? She would tie me up.",
        "Q: But she knew you were missing and she was --?",
        "A: Of course, because I was gone for two days. As far as she was concerned she\ndidn\u2019t know if I am alive or if I am dead because when I had to do this I had to do\nit on the QT because I had to find out if I go another half a mile in the town am I\nrunning in. They were looking for people like me that if you did something what\nthey didn\u2019t let you do they just hanged you and just let you hang in order to set an\nexample.",
        "Q: Your whole family was in the ghetto except your oldest brother?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: He had been deported for forced labor earlier?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. He was in the Russian front line behind the enemy line digging\ntrenches and doing this kind of work and this is the only brother that survived. He\nis now in Israel. I know of another man who lives in Cleveland who was together\nwith my brother in the same labor force. So we were in this ghetto and we were\nthere until they brought more and more people, more Jews, till they rounded up all\nthe Jews from all over the area.",
        "Q: Did this take a couple of months or weeks, do you recall?",
        "A: I would say maybe a couple of months. I really don\u2019t remember dates because to\nme one day was just like another day. I never knew --- as a matter of fact I didn\u2019t\neven know the day that I was born because before I came to America there was a\nlady in Germany who says to me I was young, under age, and somebody says to\nme one day, would you like to go to America and I said what are you talking\n9\nabout. Anyway I said well they asked me the date I was born. But every time\nsomebody asked me I just used whatever data just came to my mind. The latest\nwas very easy. I used to say January first. So this lady asked me where I was\nborn and this lady asked me for my name and I never could believe she happened\nto write a letter to her organization UNRRA and one day she sees me in the street\nand she comes running after me and she says, look what I\u2019ve got, look what I\u2019ve\ngot. I\u2019ve got your birth certificate. They send it to her. And so that\u2019s what I\nknew the day I was born and things like that. But you see my brother, I am\nYegher and he is Taub. The reason for that is because when the Jewish people\ngot married, nobody ever realized that you have to go to City Hall to get a license\nso when my older sisters and my older brother was born they were named after\nmy mother because the laws didn\u2019t consider them married because they weren\u2019t\nmarried legal. But then when they found out they had to have from the city a\nmarriage certificate, then when I was born I became Yegher. So everybody\nwants to know why your brother Taub and why I am Yegher.",
        "Q: Yegher is your father\u2019s name?",
        "A: Yes. Yegher is my father\u2019s name and my mother\u2019s name was Taub. That\u2019s why\nthey are named Taub. We\u2019re in the ghetto and every day you know how you must\nfeel. You had a beautiful whatever it was nice life, nice home, nice situation,\nhuman beings live whatever it was and all of a sudden you are cramped in like I\ndon\u2019t have to explain. You put twenty people in a room. You could just sit on the\nfloor, or whatever it is.",
        "Q: Were you in an apartment or was this a house?",
        "A: There were houses like they have townhouses here, one floor you know. When\nthey brought the people in from the other towns they just unloaded whatever ---\nwe walked from the stations. And when we walked they decided you go here and\nyou go here and you go here. You split up the families and when it\u2019s full they say\ngo to the next house and you keep pushing in and pushing in until it\u2019s full. Once\nit\u2019s full they go to the next house and this is how they packed them in.",
        "Q: You all managed to stay together though.",
        "A: Well, once you get food in a house nobody stayed guard because you could walk\naround outside the ghetto. So if three people from one family was in one house\nand three people from the other they just sort of stayed together. Until one day --\nyou know the life, one of the things that kept people from losing their mind like\nmy father, for instance, you pray every morning and you put tfillin and you daven\nevery night and you worry about the Shabbos and you keep things sort of\nsomething to do so you don\u2019t go out of your mind and this is what usually\nhappened the whole time.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t assign labor or anything like that?\n10",
        "A: No, we were just kept in. You could go out certain times even from the houses\nbut you have to stay inside and so on. So one day after being in the ghetto and I\ndon\u2019t have to tell you we had people getting all kinds of bacteria and sickness and\ndying and everything else. Even the world at that time didn\u2019t have the proper\nmedication what they have today. Even today you put twenty people, fifteen\npeople in a room and you\u2019re bound to have problems. And so until one day after\nbeing all this time in the ghetto and all this tremendous --- And the situation was\nthey never left you alone. The entire time from the minute this thing started they\nwere always trying to find a way how to beat you and how to keep you running\nand how to keep you scared and how to keep you from having no time to thing or\ntrying maybe make a plan of some kind. And they were constantly taking people\nfrom one house move them to the other house. For no reason at all they just came\nin beating people. And people were so scared and people were always crying and\npeople were always upset in situations like that. They created such a fear that we\nnever knew what\u2019s going on in the world outside. We never knew what the\nsituation is all about. We were just like sheep. Like animals we were herded into\none corner, herded into another corner, beaten into here, beaten into there, moved\ninto here, moved into there. When the time came they evacuated us from the\nghetto, I remember distinctly they told us that the front is lying where they were\nfighting the Russian was getting in danger because they were afraid that we will\nprovide information, we will turn espionage or traitors or partisans against them\nto help the Russians. But we never had a chance from nothing. We never had a\nchance. We didn\u2019t know a war, we didn\u2019t know nothing. We just didn\u2019t know\nfrom nothing. So they told us that the time has come that we\u2019re close to the front\nline and they have to evacuate us deeper into, away from the front.",
        "Q: Had you heard any bombing?",
        "A: No, absolutely not. So what happened is, you know the Jewish people, they\nalways are so law abiding citizens. They are such a law abiding citizens. I don\u2019t\nknow if this has anything to do with this or not but while I was here in\nWashington, I worked in a place, in a restaurant called Duke Zieberts and on the\nway to work one day I hear on my radio that George Lincoln Rockwell is going to\nbe speaking on the mall. And so I went into work and when I finished my work I\nwalked down to see what\u2019s happened. I just couldn\u2019t believe I saw swastikas in\nAmerica. I saw a man like they used to be a Gestapo tall off the ground, the\nguards. I saw a man that looked like that and he\u2019s talking and he has a swastika.\nThere\u2019s people with swastikas all around and I said to myself, I am not going to\nbe like the Jews in Europe. They had the tallis and tfillin and when the Gestapo\ncame they said, Sh\u2019ma Yisrael. I\u2019m not going to be like that. I\u2019m going to go\ndown and I\u2019m going see what he says. And he was talking about whatever he was\nsaying. So I walked away and I started talking to the Jewish people in this area.\nAs a matter of fact I tried to contact B\u2019nai Brith, the Anti-Defamation League.\nAnd they told me, no problem, because this is America. That\u2019s what they call\nfreedom of speech. But I just couldn\u2019t believe this is freedom of speech. So I\n11\ntried to talk to -- I met in libraries in the Silver Spring area was Jewish War\nVeterans. And I\u2019m never going to forget there was one guy, Harvey Rosenberg,\nwho was a Jewish lawyer who told me this is freedom of speech, this is America,\nthat the swastikas is the American way of life. He was talking about having this\nbig rally the fourth of July, you know how many people are down there. So he\nwent down there July the third which was a Saturday and July the fourth was a\nSunday. I went down there and the park police had him roped off with ropes.\nHe\u2019s speaking on a loud speaker and he has his troopers with the Gestapo folded\nthe hands in each corner all the way around him and I said to myself, let me hear\nwhat he\u2019s got to say. If Harvey Rosenberg, a Jewish lawyer, I tried to tell him,\nwhat are you going to do? Are you going to wait until he comes to your house.\nYou can all let this man, this is not what it is. And he says to me, if he comes to\nmy house, I\u2019m going to kill him. And I says, well, I\u2019m glad to hear you at least\nsay you are not going to say Sh\u2019ma Yisrael. So I went down there and I honest\nand truly tell you for the first time in my life I was able to beat up a Nazi. I tore\nhis ear off and he tried to take my eyes out.",
        "Q: This was Rockwell?",
        "A: No, one of his troopers. And the man I talked to, I\u2019m the one that started the riot.\nI had my hand on the rope. And I was trying to reason with him. He was a\nmarine that turned Nazi. So I said to him, why are you people doing this sort of\nthing. Didn\u2019t the world suffer enough for what Hitler did? And he says to me\nwho are you to talk like that. I says to him you see this number, I got this in\nAuschwitz. And he says to me, you big liar. How much did you pay to have this\nput on? And he said to me we are going to build bigger and better gas chambers\nthan Hitler did. When he told that to me I put my hand on the rope and I jumped\nin. And I started a riot. And when I started the riot I got arrested because for the\nfirst time in my life when I jumped in the guy got on top of me and put his fingers\nin my eyes and whatever I had to do. But I got him messed up in such a way that\nthe police took me off and they twisted my hand in back of me and they held me\nby my belt and by my hand in the back. And I says to the officer, officer I have\nnothing against you but you\u2019re breaking my arm. And I says, if you don\u2019t let me\nloose or you make me in pain, I says, I don\u2019t want to fight you. And he says to\nme, shut up, you did enough damage already. So I was booked. I put ten dollars\ndown as they call whatever it was, I don\u2019t know, and they let me go home. It was\nin the newspapers and the Nazi party called my house; they\u2019re going to kill me,\nkill my wife, kill my children. I had friends come over while I went to work to\nstay in the house with my kids.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember what year it was but it was all over the newspapers and\neverything else. And all of a sudden the whole town, the Washington area was\ntalking about David Yegher. And I had the best criminal lawyers who tried to\ndonate their time to defend me against this. So anyway when I went to court the\n12\njudge took one look at me and he says to me, Mr. David Yegher, I feel you had\nenough of the Nazis and you suffered enough of your life. What I'd like to do is\ngive you back your ten dollars. Go downstairs and we\u2019ll give you back your ten\ndollars and we\u2019ll make believe like this thing never happened. But anyway\nbecause of this, all these lawyers were trying to build a case by saying when you\ntell a Holocaust survivor that you\u2019re going to build bigger and better gas\nchambers that\u2019s not freedom of speech. That is not something that a man or that.\nHis permit was canceled and he could not talk Fourth of July. But he was gotten\nmore permits for other places; and he went to Cleveland and he went to this. But\nI was told by the Anti-Defamation League, we don\u2019t want you in jail. You got\naway with it once. But we don\u2019t want you to get involved again because the next\ntime you\u2019re not going to get off so easy. I still kept in touch and believe me I had\npeople come to my house and wanted me to give them the okay to kill them. And\nI said, no I don\u2019t want them killed. I don\u2019t want to be a martyr. And besides I\nwill not do anything but I would break the laws of the United States and as far as\nI\u2019m concerned, I will have no part of it. And I told him if you\u2019re going to, I\u2019m\ngoing to report you because the United States laws has to be uphold. So anyway\nthat\u2019s one of the situations that happened to me in Washington. So when they\ntook us from the ghetto they loaded us in closed railroad cars.",
        "Q: You mean the cattle cars?",
        "A: Cattle cars -- and again as many as they could push in, they pushed in and they\nlocked the doors.",
        "Q: What time of year was that, do you recall?",
        "A: It was around this time of year, around Pesach time, around this time of the year. I\nremember that much and we rode in these cattle cars for a long time. We didn\u2019t\nhave no food and we didn\u2019t have nothing and people go to the bathroom and God\nknows what else. And then they open the cattle cars and there were people with\nsticks. The minute they open the cars and you had to get off the cars, it was\nbetween tracks, like for no reason they were yelling, los, los, and beatings, for no\nreason. Everybody didn\u2019t have a chance to look or see or do anything.\nEverybody didn\u2019t have a chance to look or see or do anything. Everybody was\njust trying to bend down to prevent them from hitting you and they were beating\nyou all the time. We were going down in between these tracks and I saw\nsomebody in the front with a long stick like and he was saying this way, this way,\nto the left and to the right.",
        "Q: This is Auschwitz now?",
        "A: Yes, I found that out. When we got there, I\u2019m the only one that was going to the\nright. My sisters were young, good healthy women, grew up on the farm, worked\nthe fields, but because they had their children, they went to the left -- my mother,\nmy younger brother. I went to the right with the man and I knew that the sister\n13\nwho was a year younger than me also went to the right but I talked to people after\nthe war that she ended up in the crematorium after all. But I was the only one.\nNow I\u2019m talking to you what I told you a whole generation of uncles and aunts\nand families and people and the whole town that I don\u2019t know if a dozen people\nsurvived from the whole town. And I landed in Auschwitz, Birkenau. But then\nwhile I was there it didn\u2019t take long for me to find out because the next morning I\nwas asking what happened to the people and somebody was showing me the\nsmoke.",
        "Q: Another prisoner you asked?",
        "A: Yeah, that was there before me. So when I found out about what in the world was\nhappening with this and that, what can Ido? When I got there they shaved off my\nhair and they gave me a striped suit and they gave me a pair of shoes with wood\nsoles and cloth and that was it. And I was living, I saw in the Holocaust Museum\nthe bed, flat, which was eight or ten people in three layers. And when one turned,\neverybody had to turn. So I was in one of those. And one day I got separated\nfrom all the people that was from my area because somebody told me one day that\nthis is where the people get numbers and they are being shipped out to work\ninstead of sending them to the gas chambers. I saw a line one day: I was way\nacross in another barrack and I took my chance and I ran and I got in line. And\nsure enough I got a number and I was put in trucks and we were taken to a desert\nplace which was in Poland called Obershlazingen and I landed up in a place called\nGleiwitz. I since found out that Gleiwitz had four camps, concentration camps. It\nwas Gleiwitz one, Gleiwitz two, Gleiwitz three and Gleiwitz four. I was in\nGleiwitz two. And when we got there, there was nothing but mountains,\nwilderness. But the barracks were already built and it had electric wires around\nand with the Gestapo. And when we opened the gate, one gate it had where the\nGestapo came into in and out bringing out the people and one gate is to the side\nwhere you went to work. And then they also divided the camp though they didn\u2019t\nput electric wires was just a fence with two gates and they made women. Because\nafterwards, like after we got there, we dug down the mountain and we pushed it\nlike coal cars and we built a factory. They brought the machineries, I\u2019m never\ngoing to forget this, we built the whole thing. What we did is we mixed the\ncement by hand, seven shovels of sand, one shovel of cement. Then you kick it\nback and forth, then you make a hole in the middle, then you put so much water\nand you mix it. But this was like eight stories high. We brought the cement eight\nstories with a wheel barrel. I still have here, you see this, you were not allowed to\nstop and I was exhausted. I got to the fourth floor, I put the thing down for a\nsecond, he hit me with a piece of steel and cracked my skin. And so we were over\nthere and the women came in to monitor -- it was long tubes, steel, it had little\nfires and it was turning and it was creating some kind of black sword (?) and the\nwomen were taking care of that. They were taught how to put the sword and\nwhen it fills up, tie it up and put a new one in. There was a whole shift and we\nwere continue building more factory, more thing. And I lost my left ear, my\nmastoid because I was young, energetic, and after we came back from work, from\n14\nworking in the construction, building all day long, the Gestapo, they had the\nbarracks outside they wanted to have beautiful flower gardens and polish their\nshoes and things like that. And I was a farm boy, I knew how to work with dirt\nand make these things and I made a flower gardens and I did keeping up with\ntheir fields, whatever it is in front of the houses and I cleaned the floors and I used\nto get extra soup for that.",
        "Q: You did this in addition to the factory?",
        "A: In addition, of course, because when you were working in the factory, they did\nnot give you enough food for you to be able to continue working and continue\nliving. They have it calculated to give you just enough food to keep you alive but\nto extract from you all the strength so you become weak. And believe me the way\nthey did it there was the barracks all the way around the fences, there was one\nbarrack in the middle. They called the people out and you have to get in five ina\nrow. And then they make you run around this barrack, the center barrack. When\nyou ran around and then when you got weak and they started hitting you, you had\nto run faster, faster. The guy that was doing this, where he ran behind everybody,\nwhen he saw the people that he overtook, he stopped right there, those people\nwere not strong enough to live anymore, to produce work, they went to the trucks\nand went to the gas chambers. Because they had more people, they brought Jews\nfrom all over the world in Europe and they wanted the healthy one to make use of\ntheir strength. But I was always running fast and I was always able to keep up\nand that\u2019s how I survived. But what happened is when I did all this extra work I\ngot extra soup. And one day this same guy that was asking for volunteers and I\nalways went and I did and he dug a ladle and he gave me the soup and you saw all\nthe rest of the people just dying to get a bite of something and nobody could get\nnothing. You see them dying, starving. But then he asked for a volunteer to wash\nthe kettle out. And I was very gladly going to wash the kettle because this guy\ndidn\u2019t care about how he dipped out. The best stuff was in the bottom of the\nkettle.",
        "Q: This was another prisoner, this guy?",
        "A: No, this was one of the Gestapo. And when I come there to volunteer to wash the\nkettle and I was one of the volunteers, I already got a bowl of soup, I heard him\nsay to me, you swine and he hit me on my side with his right hand and he busted\nmy ear drum. And since then I had nothing but pain and even after I got liberated,\nI went to doctors in Germany and doctors in everywhere and I finally ended up\nhere in Washington a place with the ear clinic where a doctor said to me, I have\none choice, have the operation because it\u2019s so deteriorated that it\u2019s going to affect\nmy brain and it\u2019s pressing against my brain and that I don\u2019t have much to live. So\nI authorized him to operate on me and he took the mastoid out completely and I\nhave a mastoid, a plastic one and I don\u2019t hear in my left ear. But thank God the\noperation was very successful. The doctor told me I would have to come in and\ncheck-ups and things like that. But thank God whatever it did it took over. I go\n15\nto see him every couple of years or so and I have no problem. So anyway I was in\nGleiwitz.",
        "Q: How did they take you from Auschwitz to Gleiwitz, again by train?",
        "A: No, no, by truck. We were working in Gleiwitz and building the factory and me\ndoing the side works and me getting a little soup a couple of times a week,\nbecause it wasn\u2019t every day. And so I was coming along.",
        "Q: So the work the women were doing as you were building the factory they started\ndoing work in the factory?",
        "A: They ran the machinery and they as a matter of fact, when they got through for\nthe day, their faces, the whole thing, was covered with the dust, with black dust,\njust like your hair black. That\u2019s what the job they did. And afterwards one day\nwhile we\u2019re being there and I\u2019m telling you every day ----- I look outside in the\nstreet and I see people walking, cars and the highway and I said to myself, I don\u2019t\nknow, will I ever be able to walk free, will I ever be able to walk free. There was\nno such thing as trying to plan an escape because where are you going to go.\nThere\u2019s no place to go. They will catch you. And so we don\u2019t know anything\nwhat goes on in the world. We don\u2019t know nothing. And one day they tell us\nthey have to evacuate us. They opened up all the warehouses and everybody was\nrunning crazy, grabbing a loaf of bread.",
        "Q: This was the winter.",
        "A: The winter, oh was it winter. We went, I don\u2019t remember, two or three days\nwalking through the woods up to here in snow. And when the nightfall came they\njust tell us freeze or die or something and we just kept on walking. And anybody\njust couldn\u2019t walk anymore, they just shot you and left you right there. And there\nis one thing that I had with me that was another guy by the name of Shia Spiegel\nwho was from Poland, from Bengene and he and I sort of teamed up to look out\nfor one another. Well, when everybody went crazy and got a loaf of bread, I took\na loaf of cheese, like a loaf of American cheese, five pounds and I put it in my\nbelt and covered over with this and I carried because two days later the bread was\ngone and you had to march. And if anybody had any bread they killed you for it,\nor food or something. So I used to reach inside and take a piece of cheese, break\noff a piece and hold it in my hand, and I had him lay down in my arms like this\nand I fed him and he ate the piece of cheese, or he did that to me and this is how\nwe survived. Then we came to a place where there were railroad cars where they\nwere going to transport us. Yeah, there is one more thing that I did. I became an\nexpert in concrete, and not just concrete, also to make the steel because the\nconcrete is usually reinforced by steel. I became an expert in steel. They\npromoted me to build the individual air shelters for the Gestapo all around the\ncamp. Basically it was built like four feet deep on the location, round. Then we\nhad a place where we had to design that we built forms like barrel sections with a\n16\nnarrow opening from the back. And lookout that was wide and narrow to the\nfront. And then we put a dome on it. We built this whole thing by hand and then\nwe loaded it on a two -wheel cart and we pushed it to the location. And when we\ngot to the location we left clamps that we put nuts and bolts to tie it together, the\nsection. Then we put the dome on it. That\u2019s what I was doing. That was my last\njob with a crew of people.",
        "Q: Those warehouses that they opened were those in the SS part of the camp?",
        "A: They opened up everywhere. And everywhere people could go in and people ----\nwe went crazy trying to find food, all they could find. And so when we got to the\nrailroad, when they were evacuating us, they made us go into the wagon. It was\nopen; it was cold; it was snow so deep; it was absolutely blizzard. In our wagon\nthere was a hundred and eighty people because when they tell the people to go in I\nsaw this with my eyes: the Gestapo rook the rifle with the heavy side and hit\npeople over the shins, over the feet, so they will back up so they can get more\npeople up. And no matter how they did, they still couldn\u2019t get everybody on\nthere. What happened to the people then, I have no idea. But we left. When\nmidnight came the train took off. The first morning there were thirty people dead\nin our own wagon. We drove in this wagon for about eight days. Nobody ever\ngave us anything to eat. To get water, I made out of whatever I could find from\nstriped shirts, from coats like a rope with a hat and dragging it down on the\nground as the train was going to get snow for water.",
        "Q: These were the open cars, you said?",
        "A: The open cars. Out of our wagon when we were unloaded in Oranienburg, there\nwere three people from my wagon left, everybody died. Three people in my\nwagon, Shia Spiegel, one, me and somebody else. And the only reason we\nsurvived because I got the snow for water and I got the cheese that I made him\nand he made me eat and nobody could ever find out.",
        "Q: So it lasted you that whole time?",
        "A: Right, a little piece at a time.",
        "Q: What did you do with the dead bodies? Were they still on the train with you?",
        "A: First of all when there was enough people, people just dumped them overboard.\nBut then there was nobody to do it anymore so everybody that just died, they just\ndied. I saw a man dying who was out of his mind, shivering, things like that.\nAnd I found out that he was born in the town right next to my town and I just\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. And so when I got to Oranienburg I was still in pretty good\nshape. And as I was walking, this was I believe an air hangar for airplanes or\nsomething. And believe it or not, I come across somebody that we grew up\ntogether. We were together practically every day. And his name is David\n17\nYegher, too. And he lives in Lakewood, New Jersey right now. He wrote his\nbiography. He wrote it so the kids would have. He has it in there that I saved his\nlife. I don\u2019t know how I did it but I got some food for him. On top of being sick\nwhat it was he was also wounded from air raid. And I bandaged him up and I\nstayed with him until they were looking for healthy people and they picked me\nagain and guess where they sent me -- to Bergen-Belsen. I was in Bergen-Belsen\nand I saw like your eyes would never want to see. Just like flies people dying all\nover the streets and there was a wagon that was being pushed by people like us\npicking them up and just dumping them in the wagon and you see a hand or a leg\nor something stuck in the wheel or something and they just pushed the wagons\nand pushed the wagons. I didn\u2019t know where they were taking them but they\nwere just picking up the dead like you pick up logs or something. And again they\nare looking for somebody that is still in good health and I still was. That\u2019s when I\nlost, I separated from my friend because he was no longer able.",
        "Q: David Yegher, the other David Yegher?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Spiegel.",
        "A: Spiegel. So when they took me to Bergen-Belsen and I was still with Spiegel,\nfrom Oranienburg to Belsen-Belsen, when I got to Bergen-Belsen, again they\nwere looking for people that were still in pretty good shape and I still was and\nthey took me to Oranienburg.",
        "Q: Back to Oranienburg.",
        "A: No, no, no, from Oranienburg to Belsen-Belsen and from Belsen-Belsen they took\nme to Hamburg. They was a place called Desaoofa. Now, in Desaoofa where my\nstrength came to an end, they took me out in the morning to repair the railroads\nand the bridges that were bombed during the night. We always rode in some sort\nof a transport car, truck to get to the place or by train to where the place was\nbombed and we were repairing. But to come back, most of the time we couldn\u2019t\nride back because either the bridge was bombed, either the train was not available\nor something, we had to walk. So we walked and by the time we got to the place\ninto Desaoofa they had saved a kettle for soup for us because we were important\npeople to give us. But when we got there and they brought out the kettle of soup\nand we got in line, everybody got in line. And the guy was very nice; he took the\nsoup and he dumped it on the floor and we didn\u2019t get nothing to eat. And during\nthe night was air raids. We had to go down to the basement but the basement was\nfull of water when we get down. It took me four months to get me to the point\nwhere I could no longer stand on my feet. They loaded me into railroad cars that\nwe were told we\u2019re going back to Belsen-Belsen. The reason we were shipped to\nBergen-Belsen they should put us in the gas chambers or whatever in the\ncrematorium to get rid of us. But, God was with us. What happened was the\n18\nwhole time that they tried to reach Bergen-Belsen, there was air raids. They\nbombed this track, they bombed this track. They shifted us back and forth and\nthey never reached Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: You saw and heard the raids?",
        "A: Oh sure. As a matter of fact I was in one place whereby we were a little wooded\narea but we were not allowed to go into the shelters. But to the left of us -- there\nwas three corners. One was like a military, like a post office whatever it was and\none was an air shelter where all the Germans ran in and one was a bridge. Three\nbombs were direct hits. Our place was vibrating like you couldn\u2019t believe it. And\nthen they called us to come to the air shelter and to move the stuff. We removed\nthe dead bodies and things like that but nothing happened to us. So when they\ncouldn\u2019t get us anymore to Bergen-Belsen, they unloaded us in a place called\nZamposten. In this place, Zamposten, it wasn\u2019t a concentration camp, it was ----\nof course it was guarded, it didn\u2019t have electric wires whatever it was but it was a\nprisoner of war camp. And they unloaded us inn this place called Zamposten and\nthis was how shall I say it was like a ghost camp because there was no movement\nbecause everybody was weak and dying and so on.",
        "Q: These were soldiers. This was a POW camp so there were ---?",
        "A: I was too weak to know. All I know is I was told that this is a prisoner of war\ncamp. I want you to know I am not a weakling. I want you to know my\ncondition, the way I felt and I\u2019m never going to forget that. I\u2019m always hunting,\nlooking to find something to eat. I finally found a potato and I finally dragged\nmyself to the trees to find some limbs to be able to build a fire to cook the potato,\nbake it or something.",
        "Q: Where did you find the potato?",
        "A: I found it someplace. But would you believe it I couldn\u2019t accomplish my goal\nbecause I didn\u2019t have the strength after I found a match. I couldn\u2019t have the\nstrength to light the match. Could you believe that. I was getting weaker and\nweaker and weaker by the minute and I was already in a situation that I didn\u2019t\nknow, I didn\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t get up, I couldn\u2019t move and I was ----- but I don\u2019t\nknow what happened in the next I don\u2019t even know how many days, I just don\u2019t\nremember. All I know is I was lifting my head one day and I saw the Germans\nrunning and the British running after them. Then I looked again and I saw the\nBritish running back and the Germans running after the British.",
        "Q: This was from your barracks?",
        "A: From my barrack through the window. Then I saw the Germans and the British\nchasing them and that was the end But the next thing I knew, I remember, you\nsee the movies where there was people skin and bone, that\u2019s how I was. My thigh\n19\nright here I could take it around with my fingers. I remember one thing that\nsomebody coming with scissors and cutting off the striped pants and the shirt I\nhad on and lifting me up and putting me on a blanket which was put on a\nstretcher. I remember somebody putting some kind of powder or whatever it was\nand covering me with a blanket and that\u2019s all I know. I don\u2019t remember nothing\nelse until I came to in that used to be a German military barrack what they turned\ninto like a hospital. I remember them feeding me like you feed a baby with a\nbottle, the sweet milk. I remember them that after that giving me the broth from a\npotato. Then I remember them giving me the broth with a little potato init. And I\nhave started to recover really nice. Then I made a mistake because there were\nGermans, workers that were working for the military and somebody did me a\nfavor by giving me a piece of his sandwich. I had two bites and I swallowed it\nand I was dying. I remember one of the military doctors, because there was a few\ndoctors around trying to do whatever they\u2019re going to do and I heard one saying, I\ncan\u2019t let this one die because he is my challenge and he revived me. It took me\nfour months to be able to stand on my feet and being able. After that I just got up\none day and they told me where are you going to go, what are you going to eat,\nwhat are you going to be. I says, where I\u2019m going to go God knows, but I\u2019m\ngoing to go anywhere and everywhere to look for anybody that I can find to\nsurvive. And everywhere there was a camp that I heard of I somehow managed to\nget there by stopping in, begging for food, things like that. What can I tell you. I\nmet at the time people, German people, who fed me, who cried when they heard\nmy story. I also had people tell me that they are going to get even with America\nbecause they said the reason they lost the war was because America bombed their\ncities, their villages and their towns and they\u2019re going to get even with America. I\nwent in and I searched all over the Germany where it was under the British\noccupation. Then I wanted to know if I can find some more people. So I went\nacross the border. I just don\u2019t know. They were so strict of having people going\nacross the border.",
        "Q: Which border?",
        "A: Between the British zone to the American zone. But I fooled all of them and I\nwent across to the American occupied territory. This is how I came to America,\nfrom the American zone.",
        "Q: What year did you emigrate?",
        "A: I came to the United States in 1948. It was April 17 that I came into the United\nStates.",
        "Q: Between the time you were released from the hospital and emigrating you were\ngoing to various camps, that\u2019s how your time was occupied.",
        "A: Yes I was going to various camps and I was living in various camps until one day\nthat lady found me. That changed my life. And of course, the rest is history.\n20\nWhen I landed in New York and I came in and I was sponsored by the United\nJewish Appeal. But I was sponsored to come to America I don\u2019t even know who\nthe people were that I was assigned to go west. So when I came to New York I\nran into some people. They knew of my people, I ran into some people that I\nknew at the Hotel Marseille, 103\" Street and Broadway. When they came to me\nand they told me that they have me assigned and when am I ready to go west and I\nsaid to them I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know west, east. All I know is that I found a few\npeople. It\u2019s not my relatives but it\u2019s some people, a few people that I knew and to\nme this is my family. And I said I like to stay here. And they said to me well,\nthey want me to know if I stay that I will be strictly on my own. They cannot be\nresponsible for me or give me any assistance or financial or anything like that.\nAnd I said to them, haven\u2019t you done enough for me already. You brought me out\nto America. I guarantee you that I won\u2019t be no burden to you. In a country like\nthis where you can go out and have a job and make a living. And they said okay\nyou\u2019re on your own and I\u2019ve been on my own. I worked, I got a job, I was\nworking in this place. Oh, I worked hard. I was making $50 a week and I worked\nfrom eight o\u2019clock in the morning until eleven o\u2019clock at night seven days a week.",
        "Q: Was this a factory?",
        "A: No, cooking. And so after working a year I got a raise, not money, but I mean I\ngot working six days.",
        "Q: You got a day off?",
        "A: Yeah, then after working two years over there I heard about the Catskills and I\nheard about the places. I went to work as an assistant chef to a place which was\nvery well known at the time called Pioneer Country Club at Greenfield Park, New\nYork which was kosher, strictly kosher. They were so impressed with me, they\nhad a hotel, the Edwards Hotel in Florida, they were paying me some assistant\nchef $150, so I went from $50 to $150. But I went to Florida and worked for\nthem. As first chef I went from $150 to $400. I worked for them two years. Then\nI got to be so well known because the people who have eaten where they stayed\nand people came from other hotels because they liked the food so much that I had\ntwo agents who were signing up my jobs. I did that for ten years and believe it or\nnot I did that from 1950 to \u201951 actually. That was the first year I went until \u00b058\nwhen I came to Washington. I was in those years making a thousand dollars a\nweek because while I was in Germany hunting around and finding places where\nDP\u2019s were, DP camps, so I used to work in hotels and restaurants and I learned to\nbake and butcher and do everything and this was my profession. So when I came\nto Washington, I didn\u2019t realize then, I was the chef, one of the most popular, the\nbest restaurant in Washington, Duke Zieberts. I was there four and a half years.\nThen I went into business for myself and I operated Yegher\u2019s kosher caterers.\nWhen you work, whatever money you make, you know I had a family and kids,\nyou are just not able to save a lot of money but I was able to save up $3,000 and I\nwent into the business. I made a very good living and I sold it for $1,010,000\n21\ncash. I sold it and I went into the Pavilion in the Old Post Office and I left\nSeptember a year ago, the Pavilion.",
        "Q: You sold that restaurant too?",
        "A: Well there was nothing to sell. My lease was up and while I was there I just\ndidn\u2019t make any money. It was just a very bad arrangement. Everybody that ever\ngoes in there has a hard time. It\u2019s just not a money proposition because it\u2019s so\nover-rated and it looks so glorious and looks so over, over, over promoted that\npeople just don\u2019t realize you just can\u2019t make a living. I know people there who\nare absolutely starving in business. They have no money to take care of their\nchildren and no money to live, just waiting for -- you know. So I managed to\nhold on because I didn\u2019t have to hire no chef. I didn\u2019t have to hire no expensive\nwhatever you want to call it and I was able to hold out until my lease is up and I\njust took my equipment and I came out here. My situation right here, I hope to be\nable to find a bank who\u2019s going to lend me money to build a road. What you see\nright here I own nineteen acres with all of them buildings and it\u2019s all free and\nclear.. And I\u2019m hoping to get a loan and then I\u2019m going to open and then I\u2019m\ngoing to retire.",
        "Q: Will this be a kosher inn or -----?",
        "A: Well, it has a lot of ifs and buts about it. For this to be kosher, I would like it to\nbe kosher, but if it\u2019s not going to be kosher is because it will be determined that\nit\u2019s just not a market to support it. So it all depends, it all depends. I haven\u2019t\nreally decided yet but I will have to do -- remember one thing, I am a survivor.\nI\u2019m going to do whatever I have to do to survive.",
        "Q: I did have a question if you don\u2019t mind going back a little bit about what you\nremember about the first occupation of your town.",
        "A: Oh, how can I forget, I mean it started little things, slowly. You have no idea.\nFirst you had to register. After you registered they imposed various restrictions.\nYou couldn\u2019t walk from one town to the other; you couldn\u2019t be out at night; you\ncouldn\u2019t have no windows facing the main road, have to be blocked.",
        "Q: Did you live on that main road?",
        "A: Yes, and they were deporting Jews what they called it where people had to\nevacuate because of the front lines and they needed people to work the fields. So\nthey came in with this clever thing by saying that all the Jews who don\u2019t have\nenough means of living and supporting themselves and what they have within\ntheir farm. For instance; we had no problems; we had enough food, we had\nenough things, we had enough things we never needed to leave the farm. We had\nwheat, bread, you know all the things in the summer, in the winter.\n22",
        "Q: You were self sufficient.",
        "A: Self sufficient, and we even sold a lot. So there was no problem with us but there\nwere Jews taken who were very cleverly misrepresented because they were taking\nJews to Galicia and then we found out they weren\u2019t taking them to work, they\nwere taking them and they dug deep trenches and shot them all. But there were\nsome people that somebody, somehow, that the word got out. Wherever they did,\nthey did it in such a way by always giving you a reason. We need to evacuate the\npeople because the ones that don\u2019t have enough sufficient to sustain, to live,\nwhatever they have on their farm because they are not allowed to work, you\u2019re\nnot allowed to walk, you have to stay on your farm, those are the Jews that they\ntook. Then they come to the Jews and they said, well everybody of such and such\nage had to report to the military. That\u2019s when they took my brother. Then they\ncame again and they said no school, no Jews are allowed to go to school; no Jews\nare allowed to congregate; no Jews are allowed to go to the synagogue; no Jews\nare allowed to have communications of any kind with one another. Everything\nyou have on the farm you have to deliver to such and such a place, whatever the\ncrops and things like that. I remember my father dug a hole in the barn and put in\nsacks of wheat so we would have. In case whatever, 1n reserve or something. But\nwe didn\u2019t know that when you put in sacks of wheat in the ground and the wheat\ntouches the ground on the side, the wheat turns to dirt. It started cultivation and\ngrowing. When we uncovered it, whatever it had, lumber on the top and hay or\nsomething, there was only a little bit in the middle that was still useable.\nEverything else was all turned. We had no experience. We had known we would\nhave put lumber on the side, on the bottom but we didn\u2019t know. When we didn\u2019t\nhave wheat we ground the beans for flour and made some kind of bread out of\nbeans because we just couldn\u2019t get because even in the farm when you get\nwhatever you get in the winter time you have to be able to exchange and trade and\nmarket, you just cannot ---- We were lucky because we, now for instance,\npotatoes -- we dug a hole in the ground and we put straw on the outside and on the\nbottom and then we covered with straw and we put dirt on it, it was just like\nfields. Then we used to go and dig out potatoes. So we always found some\nthings. Every day of course you had to wear the Star of David.",
        "Q: Did you have to make it at home, did somebody distribute them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember of they distributed it or you made it or you\ngot it, [have no idea. And as always there was never a let down. There was\nnever a let down one day that they would leave you alone. There was always this\nconstant harassment, nudging -- today you have to do this, today you have to do\nthis, today you have to do this constantly. And they wore you down, wore you\nout, wore you down.",
        "A: How old were you when decrees began\u201d",
        "A: I was thirteen years old.\n23",
        "Q: Had you begun gymnasium or were you going on in school at that point?",
        "A: What are you talking about? I only had four years of public school. That\u2019s it. I\nhad very little schooling but I did have training in Jewish, I went to cheder. I\nlearned in cheder. I know how to daven pretty good. I know all there is to know.\nI learned from my father. I was with him ----",
        "Q: You carried his entrepreneurial spirit.",
        "A: I mean he used to pray all the time and he used to be so observant and so religious\nand such a good person.",
        "Q: He wore a beard?",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t wear no beard but he used some kind of paste to dissolve the hair or\nsomething because you\u2019re not allowed to use a razor. But anyway ----",
        "Q: What about anti-Semitism by the Romanians?",
        "A: Oh, I had anti-Semitism all the time. I grew up with that. Let me tell you\nsomething. I was a tough kid, and I mean I was a tough kid. I was not bothered\nby anybody because to me, I would never back down and even if I encountered ---\n--- I encountered a bunch of school, my younger age you know, and there was\nsomebody by the name of Kuza that they had thought, he got after the Jews at the\ntime, even before the Germans came. And they got surrounded me and they\nwanted me to say Treaska Kuza which means in Romanian long live Kuza. And I\nwouldn\u2019t say it.",
        "Q: Kuza, that was part of the government real anti-Semite -------?",
        "A: That was the guy like George Lincoln Rockwell over here. And Kuza organized\nmen who were going on the trains and when they found a Jew they threw him off\nthe train while the train was running, through the window, beat him up and things\nlike that. So anyway they tried to get me to say Treaska Kuza and I wouldn\u2019t say\nit. But I knew one thing. There was about five, six kids my age and I knew that if\nI took care of the leader that they would scatter. They had me surrounded and the\nguy who was the leader was telling to me to say Treaska Kuza and I got closer\nand closer to him and I used my right foot and I kicked him in the balls. He bent\nover screaming and when he did the rest of them, and I hit him afterwards, and I\nsaid who is next? And they all ran away. That was one thing and I was attacked\nanother time. I was a tough kid. Somebody was going to hit me and I took his\narm and I was going to put him over my shoulder, flip him over, but I did a\nterrible thing, what I did I had his hand backwards and I broke his arm. Nobody\nbothered me again. They knew I was a tough kid. When I went to school even I\nalso spoke very good Romanian and the teacher was trying to break up the Jewish\n24\nkids, there was two in a bench and so they got and they put one gentile and one\nJew because they wanted not that the Jewish kid to be able to talk in Yiddish and\ncarry on together. But there was me and one more kid from the other end of the\ntown. They let us sit together. Well they said because we spoke fluently,\nRomanian, so they didn\u2019t have to do it. But whatever it was -- I was a tough kid.",
        "Q: Did your father, was he ever harassed singly within the town?",
        "A: Well, we were constantly harassed, no question about it, constantly harassed. I\nremember one time, I don\u2019t remember exactly what happened. Somebody, I don\u2019t\nknow, hit my father with a rifle and my father told my sister to go and get the\npolice because we were on pretty good terms with the police. My mother\nwouldn\u2019t let her out of the house. As a matter of fact it\u2019s a good thing she didn\u2019t\nbecause the guy was outside who hit my father, he was outside in the street and\nafter a few minutes if my sister, if anybody would have come out he would have\nshot us. But instead of shooting us he used his rifle to shoot and he shot the\ngeese. There was a flock of geese and he shot the geese with the bullets. And so\nmy mother, she wouldn\u2019t let my sister go out and she just stayed in the house\ndown until he left. What can I tell you. This transport that went from Gleiwitz to\nOranienburg that was a suffering. I\u2019m telling you. There were some people that\ngot off the train when the train had to slow down, whatever, and they started to\nrun away. They were just shot, they were just shot.",
        "Q: Were you able to get a blanket or anything when they opened those warehouses\nbefore that trip?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So you were just exposed?",
        "A: You better believe it. You stay close together and when one side is warm you\nturn the other side to each other.",
        "Q: What did you do mentally? Do you remember? How did you deal mentally with\nthat kind of hardship? Do you think you\u2019re going to make it through or do you\njust agree to accept the inevitable?",
        "A: No, no, no, you never think of that. You constantly think what to do to survive.\nYou constantly plan what to do, how to do, what to survive. You don\u2019t think of\nit\u2019s good, you don\u2019t think of it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just like somebody is out in the desert\nand they\u2019re dying from thirst and when you see them in the movies, when they\u2019re\nrunning, when they see water, what do you think these people are going to be\nthinking of? Their entire body and mind and soul and power and strength is just\nto get to that water. Well that\u2019s the kind of conditioned that you become that you\nconstantly like fatigue just thinking where can I find something to eat. You don\u2019t\nthink of nothing else. You just think, how can I survive the next hour. And you\n25\nare constantly thinking just of that. And there is nothing else because you are in\nsuch a pain for hunger , you\u2019re in such a pain trying to find something to eat that\nyou just don\u2019t ever have anything else on your mind. You\u2019re just frustrated, how\ncan I find something to eat to get rid of the pain. And that\u2019s the way the whole\nsituation is. And you constantly manipulate and maneuver and you constantly\nlook to find something, something that you can eat, constantly. You constantly\nplan where to be. When I used to do the side work all the time.",
        "Q: The gardening?",
        "A: The gardening and polishing the shoes and making the beds and things like that.\nThat\u2019s what it took and you\u2019re just so helpless, you\u2019re just so useless, you\u2019re just\nso without nothing you can do. It\u2019s just like you see so many people dying, you\nsee so many people starving, you see so many people, there\u2019s nothing you can do,\nthere\u2019s nothing you can do. It\u2019s just like you are walking along the roads and\nthere\u2019s an earthquake and you get covered and you\u2019re dying. What can you do?\nNothing! There\u2019s nothing you can do. And I don\u2019t know why is there always that\nsomebody always comes up in a generation and always has the right, he feels he\nhas the right to destroy the Jews. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know.\nAll of a sudden the Jewish life becomes so cheap and so nobody sets any value on\nit and Jewish life -- I mean I saw the crematoriums.",
        "Q: At Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yes. I mean how in the world can ever be somebody ever able to do\nsystematically like a lumber factory, like a manufacturer that produces cars,\nsystematically gassing and burning human beings, never mind Jews, just\nsomebody. What in the world does ever anybody ever has gotten the idea that he\nhas the right to do that. How in the world? I just recently applied for the\nWiedergud Machel because I just never wanted anything from them because I\njust never wanted anything from them. But some of my friends just talked me\ninto it by saying, you\u2019re going to get old, you never know what\u2019s going to happen,\nwhy shouldn\u2019t you be able to get something out of it? They took enough from\nyou. So, but it\u2019s already too late. Anyway I filed with the Mead organization in\nNew York. They told me that they might be able to overturn something,\nwhatever. You can never tell. But the situation is ------ Because I\u2019m a Holocaust\nsurvivor and because of this area I have been approached many different ways,\nmany different times, especially when they had the Eichmann trials I had been\nfollowed by reporters. Wanted to know what I\u2019m going to say.",
        "Q: Your reaction?",
        "A: Reaction. I was also on television. There was a guy here on Alan King show that\nhe was the one that hunted down Klaus Barbie. I was on TV because he wanted\nto have somebody to talk about.\n26",
        "Q: Larry King?",
        "A: Larry King, yeah. And so my last statement was that I hope that the world would\nlearn what a horrible thing the Nazis did to the world and to the Jews especially.\nAnd I hope that never again would anything ever be instituted something of that\nnature and whatever. So I had quite a few calls because I was in the kosher\ncatering and I was very well honored with dignity and respect. People knew me\nand they called mw to tell me what a wonderful thing I did and said. So we\u2019re\ngoing to have a Holocaust Museum here?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I hope to God that it will be there to be able to that the world never forgot\nwhat the world did and a lot of it could have been prevented but the world didn\u2019t\nlift a finger. And again we were alone and no defense, nobody. And the people\nthat could do, didn\u2019t. They made it that they didn\u2019t want to be involved. Well, I\nhope to God that the State of Israel will exist and be able to because God forbid\nthis time and God forbid if the State of Israel should ever be destroyed or\noverpowered that there wouldn\u2019t be no more State of Israel and this time we will\nnot escape. It will be the end of the Jewish for sure and that I can tell you because\nas many enemies we got now and as many ways they now know how to\nexterminate and will be absolutely merciless.\n27\n"

        "A: What was the year of your birth?\nShe married a man by the name of Ignatz Hershkowitz. My second older sister\nwas married and I don\u2019t remember his name. I know Ashmael but I don\u2019t\nremember the family name. Anyway the whole problem started with all the\nsuffering we endured. I was thirteen years old when we couldn\u2019t go from town to\ntown and we had to register and we had to close the front windows to the house\nfacing the street. Jews couldn\u2019t travel on trains. It was long- suffering and one\nday the military came in. It was a Friday afternoon. My mother was cooking the\nShabbos dinner.",
        "A: In 1944 and my mother was cooking the Shabbos dinner and of course we were\nall at home because we were not allowed to go anyplace and they told us\nwhatever we can carry to make a package. We have to go with them.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. I just don\u2019t remember. All I know is that when we were\nleaving, whatever, we made a package that everybody could carry, whatever you\ncould carry. My mother was crying and telling my father, this is what we worked\nall our lives. This is what we worked and tried to make a family life and try to\nmake, you know, to eventually be able to achieve something and now we have\neverything. What we have now is just what we can carry 1n our bags. We had a\nvery prosperous farm, orchard with trees. We had cattle, but my father was also\nwhat I would call it -------- transportation or something. What it was. There was\nno cars, it was primitive, there was no cars, no machineries but when anybody\n1\nwanted to go into the city my father drove two horses with a wagon that people\ngot on the wagon to go to the city.",
        "A: To Siget. And anybody wanted to come back, they also got on the wagon and\nthey came back and he was passing a few towns on the way until we got where\nwe were living. Also on the way to Siget in the morning there was country stores\nall in these villages, towns that my father stopped and got a list from the country\nstores whatever it needed and he went into Siget, bought it, brought it to them so\nthey would have the things they were looking for, they need.",
        "A: Every day except Shabbos.",
        "A: Yeah. So in other words there were many things that pertained to conduct a way\nof making a living. For instance, one way is to have transportation for people to\nbring them into the city and also back. And also on the way into the city, the\nfarmers who had cows or sheep that milk, they had it in containers and we took\nthe containers from them and we took it into the main creamery in the city and\nthey made cream, whipped cream, butter and then we brought the empty\ncontainers back and we dropped them off. We did this six days a week. One way\nof making a living was taking in the milk which was also from our farm and from\nthe other farmers and picking up the list from the country store...",
        "A: Of their needs, and a country store was not just anything like you have a store\nhere. I mean a country store over there, we bought petroleum, we bought\nwhiskey, we bought flour, we bought whatever in the world it was. A general\nstore everything that the farmers or the people in the villages needed. And that\nwas usually the only store and therefore there were no separate stores for this or\nseparate stores for that. So this is what we did.",
        "A: Yeah, it was. You could seat at least twenty people.",
        "A: About an hour and a half, two hours. Also it was big because of the hills and the\nmountains which you have to go through. There was very steep hill that it was\nvery difficult to get up in the winter time or even when you had on the way from\n2\nthe city that you were bringing back to the people flour and petroleum. This was\nvery heavy. When you loaded up the wagon it weighed like a railroad car and to\npull up the steep hills, to cross over into the villages, it was very, very difficult.",
        "A: The horses pushed and you put your elbow and you pushed along with them and a\nlot of times depending on the weather you just didn\u2019t have enough power to pull\nit. So we went to the nearby farm and they came in and lend us another horse or\ntwo that we put up to help pull over the mountain. Just as hard as it was going to\nget up on the mountain, it was just as difficult getting down, to hold back all that\nweight. And you got to the point where you were about holding it to the middle\nof the mountain going down and then you just lost control and it would just shoot\ndown and anything happen. It was God\u2019s will. Sometimes the horses were trying\nto hold it back. They held it back as much as they could and then they just used to\njust like slide down on the hind legs on the ground and the weight from the wagon\nwas just pulling them down and sometime one horse was holding back so hard\nthat they pulled the whole wagon into the ditch on the side where the water was\nrunning. Then we had a hard time. We had to unload it, put everything on the\nstreet and get the wagon out and load it up again. It was a very hard life but it\nwas home. I mean we had a very, very strong family unity. And we always --\nsometimes it was very little to eat and sometimes whatever it was we sat at a table\nand we shared. And my mother, may she rest in peace, she always fed everybody\nand sometimes there wasn\u2019t anything left and she just went without. And I saw\nthat myself.",
        "A: No, I was the fourth one. Then, of course, I had relatives. I had, of course,\ngrandparents. My mother\u2019s side lived in the same town where we lived. And, of\ncourse, my father\u2019s parents lived with us. My grandfather, both of my\ngrandfathers had died.",
        "A: They died before the problem started. But my grandmother, my father\u2019s mother,\nshe was in bed all the time, she was something wrong with her, and of course we\ncarried her to the train when we were leaving. And we took her and she was in\nthe wagon even when we went to Auschwitz. And of course my other\ngrandmother was still walking. Then my father had one brother and three sisters.",
        "A: Two of them were living in Ronadejus. The others were living in some other\ntowns. My mother had a brother and two sisters. Her brother luckily enough\nbefore all this trouble started, he emigrated to Argentina and his children, I mean\n3\nmy uncle, I happened to see him after the war. He moved from Argentina to\nIsrael and he died just about a couple of years ago now. But his children, my\ncousins, are still living now. But my mother\u2019s two sisters, the husbands and the\nchildren, they all perished in Auschwitz My father was, they were very poor\nwhen they got married. They didn\u2019t have anything. He started all of this so-\ncalled enterprises, whatever, a way that was needed and in order to be able to\nsupport the family and the money that he made from this -- taking all these things\nto the villages and into the town and everything else, we bought land. We had\nbeautiful orchards with apples, pears, plums. We ended up making our own\nwhiskey because I remember big, big drums like they have gas storage tanks that\nthey used to put in all the fruit. And there was a little thing coming out from the\nbottom after whatever long it took, and the whiskey was coming out and we made\nour own wine and we also made our own dried fruit. And we sold it not only to\nthe markets in Romania at the time but we also sold it to the neighboring\ncountries like Czechoslovakia and Hungary and this and that.",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I remember when I was a little boy that in the summertime, whatever\nmanure from the cows was piled up in big piles. And in the wintertime when the\nsnow was you chopped it up in chunks and you loaded it in a sled and you hauled\nit into the fields for fertilizer. During the daytime my father was taking care of\nwhatever he had to do the business of, I don\u2019t know what would you call that,\ntransportation or whatever. And at nighttime we worked in the fields.",
        "A: You\u2019d better believe it. I mean that was the kind of situation. There was no\nclock, there was no nothing. You devoted your whole time working in the fields.\nAnd then, of course, when the summer came, you have to plow it and you plowed\nit with the horses not with tractors. Every time you cleared more trees to make\nmore land, clearing for farm land to be able to. One time my oldest brother was\nalready taken from us into what they called forced labor by the Hungarians\nbecause during my time when I was going in school which reminds me another\nsituation. When I was going in school and I was four years in public school.",
        "A: Romanian public schools. I had very little time to do my homework because\nwhen I came home I had to do the chores in the fields.\n4",
        "A: Yes I had to clean all the stables and see that the milking cows were fed. And my\nsister did my homework. As a matter of fact, when we started school, I flunked\nthe first year because I never did my homework. But my sister that was a year\nyounger from me, she started school the following year and she did her homework\nand she did my homework. But I was bright enough that I really did very well not\nfrom studying at home, just for being in school and doing it when the teacher was\ndoing the stuff. Then the problem came when the Hungarian took over that part.\nI started the fifth year in school with a Hungarian teacher that only spoke\nHungarian. I never spoke Hungarian in my life.",
        "A: Yes and what happened was, I was very good in arithmetic. We used to have tests\nlike who could answer faster like five times five, five times three, eight times\nnine. I always was the winner. But we had the test in Hungarian and I lost\nbecause I had to transfer the Hungarian to Romanian or to Yiddish. Even today\nwhen I am figuring a bill, when I had my catering, people used to always be\namazed because I figured in Yiddish, always.",
        "A: Only Yiddish. We spoke Yiddish at home and I spoke Romanian in school. And\nthen in the fifth year I had to learn Hungarian. And it was a very hard thing. And\none of the things that really hurt me --\u2014- when we were leaving the house, when\nthey were taking us to --- they took us to the ghetto, there was one of the guys\nwho was my best friend all my life.",
        "A: No, a gentile. His father was the post office man. He delivered the mail. We\nwere very close friends. We were practically every day together. When I was\nleaving, when we were taken, I had on a red sweater with no sleeves. It was man-\nmade. The guy that was taking us told me to take my sweater off. Would you\nbelieve it I saw him take my sweater, he took it with a stick ---",
        "A: And he gave it to my best friend because my best friend asked him to get it for\nhim. And he was wearing a rifle but it was not a real one. It was made out of\nwood just so that he had the authority. This is something that I could never\nbelieve. I never went back there and if I ever do I\u2019m gonna take a sweater off\nhim. If it\u2019s the last thing in my life I\u2019m gonna do.\n5",
        "A: There was about, for that time of the world it was considered to be a lot. It was\ntwo hundred families. And there was about half of them, Jews. There was only\none main street that the whole town consisted of, but there was a lot of homes in\nthe back fields and in the woods. Most of the homes, I would say seventy-five\npercent that were built on the main road were Jewish people. The Jewish people\nhad more or less -- 1t was even in those days like we had a kitchen that we were,\nyou know the floor was nothing but a mud floor because I remember my mother\nonce a week used to bring mud and make it soft with water and just take the hand\nand go over and give it a fresh go-over. But still in all 1t had a table and chairs\nand we were eating with knives and forks and we had kosher dairy dishes and\nmeat dishes. My father was very religious. My mother was ---",
        "A: Well, I never knew the word Chassid at the time but I do know I never saw\nanybody anywhere in America or anywhere I have been that could have been\nmore religious than my father. My mother wore what they call a sheitl and I\nremember when my sisters got married they cut their hair. And they cried. I\nremember that. We lived, for instance, a lot of the gentiles that were living in that\narea, they had a house. But their house consisted of four walls and in the corner\nwas a bed and in the other corner was a stove which was heated with wood. In\nthe wintertime they kept this wood going, the stove. This is how they heated and\nthey all slept in one bed and all around, whatever. But we had beds. We were\ncivilized people. We had beds. Everybody had their own bed. We might had a\nroom where we had three kids sleeping in the same room, whatever, but we had\nbeds and we each had a bed.",
        "A: Yeah, one floor. In the summertime we still continued, for instance, we had our\nown, like they call here a pizza oven, we had one that was built out of brick. And\nwe heated it with wood, made it hot, and the oven got hot and my mother baked\nbread and also she put Friday in the cholent for Shabbos and she put it in the oven\nwith the coal created by the wood and you can imagine if a woman today would\nhave to go out and get wood and create the oven, this baker oven, which was like\na huge boiler which was built out of stone and brick. You bring the wood and you\nput it in and you light the fire and you create coal and when it\u2019s hot enough you\nput in all the pots and have like a 24 by 36 opening and you sealed it and you used\nwet mud to seal it so the heat will not escape, and then you opened that Saturday\nafter you come home from shul and that\u2019s what we ate Saturday, the cholent and\nthe kugel and all that and it was always very delicious. There\u2019s nothing ever\ncomparising to that.\n6",
        "A: No, it was a corner of the house. Like let\u2019s say when you come in from the front,\nthe front part like three-quarters was the kitchen and then there was a wall with a\ndoor that you went into the other room, that was the other corner of the house.\nThat corner was built where the baker-oven was built. It had a big chimney going\nup and this is how my mother baked the bread and put the food in for the cholent\nand things like that. And we had a wooden stove in the kitchen which was lined\nwith brick. This was how we cooked and this is how we heated the winter. When\nyou went to sleep and I\u2019m telling you it was bitter cold, none of the rooms were\never heated, wherever you went to sleep but you never had to worry because you\nhad feather quilts. You was really in no problem.",
        "A: Oh yes, I attended it\u2019s not a cheder. I mean I didn\u2019t have to be in public school\nuntil nine o\u2019clock so I started cheder in the morning like 6:30. Then when I\nfinished cheder my mother waited for me to give me something to eat and I was\neating while I walked to public school. And when I got out of public school again\nshe waited for me to give me something to eat and then I went to cheder till nine\no\u2019clock at night.",
        "A: Yeah and I also of course had a lot of Shabbos. You know they had teachers and\nlectures and things like that. And I spent a whole day in cheder, Sunday, because\nthere was no public school.",
        "A: Chores on top of that. And of course, then they took us to the ghetto.",
        "A: Well, it was across the river. It was in Czechoslovakia. It\u2019s called Slotyna,\nSolopvina in Yiddish. That\u2019s where they got all the Jews from the whole area\nbecause when the Hungarian came in, they already had occupied Czechoslovakia,\nit was Hungary. Then when they came in, took over the Carpathian Mountain it\nbecame Hungary, too. So all of it was already one and when they got the Jews\nfrom all the towns and from the big city, from Siget they formed the ghetto in\nwhat used to be Czechoslovakia. It used to be Slotyna and in Yiddish they used\nto refer to as Solopvina. They cramped us in. They took a section of the town, of\nthe thing, and they made a ghetto. They moved all the gentiles out and they took\nwhatever it was and they cramped us in, ten ina room. There was no such a thing\nas a bed or anything.\n7",
        "A: I am for one terribly ---",
        "A: One thing I just don\u2019t remember dates. I just know what happened. So when we\nwere in the ghetto in Solopvina we had tremendous suffering because aside from\neverything, sleeping on the floor and things like that, we just didn\u2019t have food.\nWe were really suffering. And so I endangered my life by sneaking out from the\nghetto. The way I did it, there was somebody going through because you see you\nhave to go through guards and they checked everything. The traffic still people\nwere going on the main road. We were not allowed to get near the main road.",
        "A: Yeah, oh sure, there was a fence around the ghetto and there was guards around\nthe ghetto and also where the main road was that went through the ghetto that was\nalso blocked off. If you had a house you had to block the windows, board it off.\nAnd there was a fence that had to be made higher so nobody could get over it.\nBut I went over it and I saw a wagon with two horses. There were just wagons\nand horses that the local people were still using. So what happened there is a long\npiece of wood that holds together the front wheels with the back wheels, that\u2019s in\nthe bottom like. And I put my legs onto that under the wagon and my hands and I\nwent through the checkpoint and when I got on the other side I went into the town\nwhere we were living. I guess whatever it was at that day I told them that we\nwere being held in such and such a place and that we don\u2019t have food and we\u2019re\nstarving and this and that. I was able to manage to get a wagon from somebody\nand I had a lot of people -- because you see my father was very honored and\nrespected because of all the transactions and all the things that we did for the town\nand for all the other towns so everybody knew because if you wanted to send\nsomething to the city you got my father to carry it. If you wanted to bring\nsomething home, you got my father to carry it. So we were very well known. So\nwhen I came into the town and told them we\u2019re starving and I had a wagon, I had\nfrom the farmers, they brought me all kinds of things and I loaded up a whole\nwagon.",
        "A: I got back to my old town but when I got into town I kept asking where the\nGestapo was to make sure I don\u2019t run into them. And some of the people even\nhelped me stay out so they couldn\u2019t reach me. And I loaded one of these big\nwagons and I mean full with everything, with corn and potatoes and mostly that.\nI found two horses that used to belong to us. Of course I recognized them and I\ngot them and I hitched them up and would you believe it I drove in through the\ncheckpoint and I was inside already and when I did, I wanted to get in. You know\neverything was blocked off.\n8",
        "A: The ghetto, the main road, everything was fences. In order for me to be able to do\nthis, I broke open whatever I was able to do, a gate. And I got in the ghetto and I\ndrove to where my mother and father were and what happened was my mother\nwas so worried and so nervous and upset she used to bite the back of her hand to\nkeep her --- she bit off her flesh because she was so upset. And when I got there I\nyelled quickly whoever was available to unload quickly the wagon. And when I\ndid that after it was unloaded I took the two horses and the wagon back to the\nmain road and I slapped them 1n the back and I let them go. And nobody ever\nfound out.",
        "A: Are you kidding? She would tie me up.",
        "A: Of course, because I was gone for two days. As far as she was concerned she\ndidn\u2019t know if I am alive or if I am dead because when I had to do this I had to do\nit on the QT because I had to find out if I go another half a mile in the town am I\nrunning in. They were looking for people like me that if you did something what\nthey didn\u2019t let you do they just hanged you and just let you hang in order to set an\nexample.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. He was in the Russian front line behind the enemy line digging\ntrenches and doing this kind of work and this is the only brother that survived. He\nis now in Israel. I know of another man who lives in Cleveland who was together\nwith my brother in the same labor force. So we were in this ghetto and we were\nthere until they brought more and more people, more Jews, till they rounded up all\nthe Jews from all over the area.",
        "A: I would say maybe a couple of months. I really don\u2019t remember dates because to\nme one day was just like another day. I never knew --- as a matter of fact I didn\u2019t\neven know the day that I was born because before I came to America there was a\nlady in Germany who says to me I was young, under age, and somebody says to\nme one day, would you like to go to America and I said what are you talking\n9\nabout. Anyway I said well they asked me the date I was born. But every time\nsomebody asked me I just used whatever data just came to my mind. The latest\nwas very easy. I used to say January first. So this lady asked me where I was\nborn and this lady asked me for my name and I never could believe she happened\nto write a letter to her organization UNRRA and one day she sees me in the street\nand she comes running after me and she says, look what I\u2019ve got, look what I\u2019ve\ngot. I\u2019ve got your birth certificate. They send it to her. And so that\u2019s what I\nknew the day I was born and things like that. But you see my brother, I am\nYegher and he is Taub. The reason for that is because when the Jewish people\ngot married, nobody ever realized that you have to go to City Hall to get a license\nso when my older sisters and my older brother was born they were named after\nmy mother because the laws didn\u2019t consider them married because they weren\u2019t\nmarried legal. But then when they found out they had to have from the city a\nmarriage certificate, then when I was born I became Yegher. So everybody\nwants to know why your brother Taub and why I am Yegher.",
        "A: Yes. Yegher is my father\u2019s name and my mother\u2019s name was Taub. That\u2019s why\nthey are named Taub. We\u2019re in the ghetto and every day you know how you must\nfeel. You had a beautiful whatever it was nice life, nice home, nice situation,\nhuman beings live whatever it was and all of a sudden you are cramped in like I\ndon\u2019t have to explain. You put twenty people in a room. You could just sit on the\nfloor, or whatever it is.",
        "A: There were houses like they have townhouses here, one floor you know. When\nthey brought the people in from the other towns they just unloaded whatever ---\nwe walked from the stations. And when we walked they decided you go here and\nyou go here and you go here. You split up the families and when it\u2019s full they say\ngo to the next house and you keep pushing in and pushing in until it\u2019s full. Once\nit\u2019s full they go to the next house and this is how they packed them in.",
        "A: Well, once you get food in a house nobody stayed guard because you could walk\naround outside the ghetto. So if three people from one family was in one house\nand three people from the other they just sort of stayed together. Until one day --\nyou know the life, one of the things that kept people from losing their mind like\nmy father, for instance, you pray every morning and you put tfillin and you daven\nevery night and you worry about the Shabbos and you keep things sort of\nsomething to do so you don\u2019t go out of your mind and this is what usually\nhappened the whole time.\n10",
        "A: No, we were just kept in. You could go out certain times even from the houses\nbut you have to stay inside and so on. So one day after being in the ghetto and I\ndon\u2019t have to tell you we had people getting all kinds of bacteria and sickness and\ndying and everything else. Even the world at that time didn\u2019t have the proper\nmedication what they have today. Even today you put twenty people, fifteen\npeople in a room and you\u2019re bound to have problems. And so until one day after\nbeing all this time in the ghetto and all this tremendous --- And the situation was\nthey never left you alone. The entire time from the minute this thing started they\nwere always trying to find a way how to beat you and how to keep you running\nand how to keep you scared and how to keep you from having no time to thing or\ntrying maybe make a plan of some kind. And they were constantly taking people\nfrom one house move them to the other house. For no reason at all they just came\nin beating people. And people were so scared and people were always crying and\npeople were always upset in situations like that. They created such a fear that we\nnever knew what\u2019s going on in the world outside. We never knew what the\nsituation is all about. We were just like sheep. Like animals we were herded into\none corner, herded into another corner, beaten into here, beaten into there, moved\ninto here, moved into there. When the time came they evacuated us from the\nghetto, I remember distinctly they told us that the front is lying where they were\nfighting the Russian was getting in danger because they were afraid that we will\nprovide information, we will turn espionage or traitors or partisans against them\nto help the Russians. But we never had a chance from nothing. We never had a\nchance. We didn\u2019t know a war, we didn\u2019t know nothing. We just didn\u2019t know\nfrom nothing. So they told us that the time has come that we\u2019re close to the front\nline and they have to evacuate us deeper into, away from the front.",
        "A: No, absolutely not. So what happened is, you know the Jewish people, they\nalways are so law abiding citizens. They are such a law abiding citizens. I don\u2019t\nknow if this has anything to do with this or not but while I was here in\nWashington, I worked in a place, in a restaurant called Duke Zieberts and on the\nway to work one day I hear on my radio that George Lincoln Rockwell is going to\nbe speaking on the mall. And so I went into work and when I finished my work I\nwalked down to see what\u2019s happened. I just couldn\u2019t believe I saw swastikas in\nAmerica. I saw a man like they used to be a Gestapo tall off the ground, the\nguards. I saw a man that looked like that and he\u2019s talking and he has a swastika.\nThere\u2019s people with swastikas all around and I said to myself, I am not going to\nbe like the Jews in Europe. They had the tallis and tfillin and when the Gestapo\ncame they said, Sh\u2019ma Yisrael. I\u2019m not going to be like that. I\u2019m going to go\ndown and I\u2019m going see what he says. And he was talking about whatever he was\nsaying. So I walked away and I started talking to the Jewish people in this area.\nAs a matter of fact I tried to contact B\u2019nai Brith, the Anti-Defamation League.\nAnd they told me, no problem, because this is America. That\u2019s what they call\nfreedom of speech. But I just couldn\u2019t believe this is freedom of speech. So I\n11\ntried to talk to -- I met in libraries in the Silver Spring area was Jewish War\nVeterans. And I\u2019m never going to forget there was one guy, Harvey Rosenberg,\nwho was a Jewish lawyer who told me this is freedom of speech, this is America,\nthat the swastikas is the American way of life. He was talking about having this\nbig rally the fourth of July, you know how many people are down there. So he\nwent down there July the third which was a Saturday and July the fourth was a\nSunday. I went down there and the park police had him roped off with ropes.\nHe\u2019s speaking on a loud speaker and he has his troopers with the Gestapo folded\nthe hands in each corner all the way around him and I said to myself, let me hear\nwhat he\u2019s got to say. If Harvey Rosenberg, a Jewish lawyer, I tried to tell him,\nwhat are you going to do? Are you going to wait until he comes to your house.\nYou can all let this man, this is not what it is. And he says to me, if he comes to\nmy house, I\u2019m going to kill him. And I says, well, I\u2019m glad to hear you at least\nsay you are not going to say Sh\u2019ma Yisrael. So I went down there and I honest\nand truly tell you for the first time in my life I was able to beat up a Nazi. I tore\nhis ear off and he tried to take my eyes out.",
        "A: No, one of his troopers. And the man I talked to, I\u2019m the one that started the riot.\nI had my hand on the rope. And I was trying to reason with him. He was a\nmarine that turned Nazi. So I said to him, why are you people doing this sort of\nthing. Didn\u2019t the world suffer enough for what Hitler did? And he says to me\nwho are you to talk like that. I says to him you see this number, I got this in\nAuschwitz. And he says to me, you big liar. How much did you pay to have this\nput on? And he said to me we are going to build bigger and better gas chambers\nthan Hitler did. When he told that to me I put my hand on the rope and I jumped\nin. And I started a riot. And when I started the riot I got arrested because for the\nfirst time in my life when I jumped in the guy got on top of me and put his fingers\nin my eyes and whatever I had to do. But I got him messed up in such a way that\nthe police took me off and they twisted my hand in back of me and they held me\nby my belt and by my hand in the back. And I says to the officer, officer I have\nnothing against you but you\u2019re breaking my arm. And I says, if you don\u2019t let me\nloose or you make me in pain, I says, I don\u2019t want to fight you. And he says to\nme, shut up, you did enough damage already. So I was booked. I put ten dollars\ndown as they call whatever it was, I don\u2019t know, and they let me go home. It was\nin the newspapers and the Nazi party called my house; they\u2019re going to kill me,\nkill my wife, kill my children. I had friends come over while I went to work to\nstay in the house with my kids.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember what year it was but it was all over the newspapers and\neverything else. And all of a sudden the whole town, the Washington area was\ntalking about David Yegher. And I had the best criminal lawyers who tried to\ndonate their time to defend me against this. So anyway when I went to court the\n12\njudge took one look at me and he says to me, Mr. David Yegher, I feel you had\nenough of the Nazis and you suffered enough of your life. What I'd like to do is\ngive you back your ten dollars. Go downstairs and we\u2019ll give you back your ten\ndollars and we\u2019ll make believe like this thing never happened. But anyway\nbecause of this, all these lawyers were trying to build a case by saying when you\ntell a Holocaust survivor that you\u2019re going to build bigger and better gas\nchambers that\u2019s not freedom of speech. That is not something that a man or that.\nHis permit was canceled and he could not talk Fourth of July. But he was gotten\nmore permits for other places; and he went to Cleveland and he went to this. But\nI was told by the Anti-Defamation League, we don\u2019t want you in jail. You got\naway with it once. But we don\u2019t want you to get involved again because the next\ntime you\u2019re not going to get off so easy. I still kept in touch and believe me I had\npeople come to my house and wanted me to give them the okay to kill them. And\nI said, no I don\u2019t want them killed. I don\u2019t want to be a martyr. And besides I\nwill not do anything but I would break the laws of the United States and as far as\nI\u2019m concerned, I will have no part of it. And I told him if you\u2019re going to, I\u2019m\ngoing to report you because the United States laws has to be uphold. So anyway\nthat\u2019s one of the situations that happened to me in Washington. So when they\ntook us from the ghetto they loaded us in closed railroad cars.",
        "A: Cattle cars -- and again as many as they could push in, they pushed in and they\nlocked the doors.",
        "A: It was around this time of year, around Pesach time, around this time of the year. I\nremember that much and we rode in these cattle cars for a long time. We didn\u2019t\nhave no food and we didn\u2019t have nothing and people go to the bathroom and God\nknows what else. And then they open the cattle cars and there were people with\nsticks. The minute they open the cars and you had to get off the cars, it was\nbetween tracks, like for no reason they were yelling, los, los, and beatings, for no\nreason. Everybody didn\u2019t have a chance to look or see or do anything.\nEverybody didn\u2019t have a chance to look or see or do anything. Everybody was\njust trying to bend down to prevent them from hitting you and they were beating\nyou all the time. We were going down in between these tracks and I saw\nsomebody in the front with a long stick like and he was saying this way, this way,\nto the left and to the right.",
        "A: Yes, I found that out. When we got there, I\u2019m the only one that was going to the\nright. My sisters were young, good healthy women, grew up on the farm, worked\nthe fields, but because they had their children, they went to the left -- my mother,\nmy younger brother. I went to the right with the man and I knew that the sister\n13\nwho was a year younger than me also went to the right but I talked to people after\nthe war that she ended up in the crematorium after all. But I was the only one.\nNow I\u2019m talking to you what I told you a whole generation of uncles and aunts\nand families and people and the whole town that I don\u2019t know if a dozen people\nsurvived from the whole town. And I landed in Auschwitz, Birkenau. But then\nwhile I was there it didn\u2019t take long for me to find out because the next morning I\nwas asking what happened to the people and somebody was showing me the\nsmoke.",
        "A: Yeah, that was there before me. So when I found out about what in the world was\nhappening with this and that, what can Ido? When I got there they shaved off my\nhair and they gave me a striped suit and they gave me a pair of shoes with wood\nsoles and cloth and that was it. And I was living, I saw in the Holocaust Museum\nthe bed, flat, which was eight or ten people in three layers. And when one turned,\neverybody had to turn. So I was in one of those. And one day I got separated\nfrom all the people that was from my area because somebody told me one day that\nthis is where the people get numbers and they are being shipped out to work\ninstead of sending them to the gas chambers. I saw a line one day: I was way\nacross in another barrack and I took my chance and I ran and I got in line. And\nsure enough I got a number and I was put in trucks and we were taken to a desert\nplace which was in Poland called Obershlazingen and I landed up in a place called\nGleiwitz. I since found out that Gleiwitz had four camps, concentration camps. It\nwas Gleiwitz one, Gleiwitz two, Gleiwitz three and Gleiwitz four. I was in\nGleiwitz two. And when we got there, there was nothing but mountains,\nwilderness. But the barracks were already built and it had electric wires around\nand with the Gestapo. And when we opened the gate, one gate it had where the\nGestapo came into in and out bringing out the people and one gate is to the side\nwhere you went to work. And then they also divided the camp though they didn\u2019t\nput electric wires was just a fence with two gates and they made women. Because\nafterwards, like after we got there, we dug down the mountain and we pushed it\nlike coal cars and we built a factory. They brought the machineries, I\u2019m never\ngoing to forget this, we built the whole thing. What we did is we mixed the\ncement by hand, seven shovels of sand, one shovel of cement. Then you kick it\nback and forth, then you make a hole in the middle, then you put so much water\nand you mix it. But this was like eight stories high. We brought the cement eight\nstories with a wheel barrel. I still have here, you see this, you were not allowed to\nstop and I was exhausted. I got to the fourth floor, I put the thing down for a\nsecond, he hit me with a piece of steel and cracked my skin. And so we were over\nthere and the women came in to monitor -- it was long tubes, steel, it had little\nfires and it was turning and it was creating some kind of black sword (?) and the\nwomen were taking care of that. They were taught how to put the sword and\nwhen it fills up, tie it up and put a new one in. There was a whole shift and we\nwere continue building more factory, more thing. And I lost my left ear, my\nmastoid because I was young, energetic, and after we came back from work, from\n14\nworking in the construction, building all day long, the Gestapo, they had the\nbarracks outside they wanted to have beautiful flower gardens and polish their\nshoes and things like that. And I was a farm boy, I knew how to work with dirt\nand make these things and I made a flower gardens and I did keeping up with\ntheir fields, whatever it is in front of the houses and I cleaned the floors and I used\nto get extra soup for that.",
        "A: In addition, of course, because when you were working in the factory, they did\nnot give you enough food for you to be able to continue working and continue\nliving. They have it calculated to give you just enough food to keep you alive but\nto extract from you all the strength so you become weak. And believe me the way\nthey did it there was the barracks all the way around the fences, there was one\nbarrack in the middle. They called the people out and you have to get in five ina\nrow. And then they make you run around this barrack, the center barrack. When\nyou ran around and then when you got weak and they started hitting you, you had\nto run faster, faster. The guy that was doing this, where he ran behind everybody,\nwhen he saw the people that he overtook, he stopped right there, those people\nwere not strong enough to live anymore, to produce work, they went to the trucks\nand went to the gas chambers. Because they had more people, they brought Jews\nfrom all over the world in Europe and they wanted the healthy one to make use of\ntheir strength. But I was always running fast and I was always able to keep up\nand that\u2019s how I survived. But what happened is when I did all this extra work I\ngot extra soup. And one day this same guy that was asking for volunteers and I\nalways went and I did and he dug a ladle and he gave me the soup and you saw all\nthe rest of the people just dying to get a bite of something and nobody could get\nnothing. You see them dying, starving. But then he asked for a volunteer to wash\nthe kettle out. And I was very gladly going to wash the kettle because this guy\ndidn\u2019t care about how he dipped out. The best stuff was in the bottom of the\nkettle.",
        "A: No, this was one of the Gestapo. And when I come there to volunteer to wash the\nkettle and I was one of the volunteers, I already got a bowl of soup, I heard him\nsay to me, you swine and he hit me on my side with his right hand and he busted\nmy ear drum. And since then I had nothing but pain and even after I got liberated,\nI went to doctors in Germany and doctors in everywhere and I finally ended up\nhere in Washington a place with the ear clinic where a doctor said to me, I have\none choice, have the operation because it\u2019s so deteriorated that it\u2019s going to affect\nmy brain and it\u2019s pressing against my brain and that I don\u2019t have much to live. So\nI authorized him to operate on me and he took the mastoid out completely and I\nhave a mastoid, a plastic one and I don\u2019t hear in my left ear. But thank God the\noperation was very successful. The doctor told me I would have to come in and\ncheck-ups and things like that. But thank God whatever it did it took over. I go\n15\nto see him every couple of years or so and I have no problem. So anyway I was in\nGleiwitz.",
        "A: No, no, by truck. We were working in Gleiwitz and building the factory and me\ndoing the side works and me getting a little soup a couple of times a week,\nbecause it wasn\u2019t every day. And so I was coming along.",
        "A: They ran the machinery and they as a matter of fact, when they got through for\nthe day, their faces, the whole thing, was covered with the dust, with black dust,\njust like your hair black. That\u2019s what the job they did. And afterwards one day\nwhile we\u2019re being there and I\u2019m telling you every day ----- I look outside in the\nstreet and I see people walking, cars and the highway and I said to myself, I don\u2019t\nknow, will I ever be able to walk free, will I ever be able to walk free. There was\nno such thing as trying to plan an escape because where are you going to go.\nThere\u2019s no place to go. They will catch you. And so we don\u2019t know anything\nwhat goes on in the world. We don\u2019t know nothing. And one day they tell us\nthey have to evacuate us. They opened up all the warehouses and everybody was\nrunning crazy, grabbing a loaf of bread.",
        "A: The winter, oh was it winter. We went, I don\u2019t remember, two or three days\nwalking through the woods up to here in snow. And when the nightfall came they\njust tell us freeze or die or something and we just kept on walking. And anybody\njust couldn\u2019t walk anymore, they just shot you and left you right there. And there\nis one thing that I had with me that was another guy by the name of Shia Spiegel\nwho was from Poland, from Bengene and he and I sort of teamed up to look out\nfor one another. Well, when everybody went crazy and got a loaf of bread, I took\na loaf of cheese, like a loaf of American cheese, five pounds and I put it in my\nbelt and covered over with this and I carried because two days later the bread was\ngone and you had to march. And if anybody had any bread they killed you for it,\nor food or something. So I used to reach inside and take a piece of cheese, break\noff a piece and hold it in my hand, and I had him lay down in my arms like this\nand I fed him and he ate the piece of cheese, or he did that to me and this is how\nwe survived. Then we came to a place where there were railroad cars where they\nwere going to transport us. Yeah, there is one more thing that I did. I became an\nexpert in concrete, and not just concrete, also to make the steel because the\nconcrete is usually reinforced by steel. I became an expert in steel. They\npromoted me to build the individual air shelters for the Gestapo all around the\ncamp. Basically it was built like four feet deep on the location, round. Then we\nhad a place where we had to design that we built forms like barrel sections with a\n16\nnarrow opening from the back. And lookout that was wide and narrow to the\nfront. And then we put a dome on it. We built this whole thing by hand and then\nwe loaded it on a two -wheel cart and we pushed it to the location. And when we\ngot to the location we left clamps that we put nuts and bolts to tie it together, the\nsection. Then we put the dome on it. That\u2019s what I was doing. That was my last\njob with a crew of people.",
        "A: They opened up everywhere. And everywhere people could go in and people ----\nwe went crazy trying to find food, all they could find. And so when we got to the\nrailroad, when they were evacuating us, they made us go into the wagon. It was\nopen; it was cold; it was snow so deep; it was absolutely blizzard. In our wagon\nthere was a hundred and eighty people because when they tell the people to go in I\nsaw this with my eyes: the Gestapo rook the rifle with the heavy side and hit\npeople over the shins, over the feet, so they will back up so they can get more\npeople up. And no matter how they did, they still couldn\u2019t get everybody on\nthere. What happened to the people then, I have no idea. But we left. When\nmidnight came the train took off. The first morning there were thirty people dead\nin our own wagon. We drove in this wagon for about eight days. Nobody ever\ngave us anything to eat. To get water, I made out of whatever I could find from\nstriped shirts, from coats like a rope with a hat and dragging it down on the\nground as the train was going to get snow for water.",
        "A: The open cars. Out of our wagon when we were unloaded in Oranienburg, there\nwere three people from my wagon left, everybody died. Three people in my\nwagon, Shia Spiegel, one, me and somebody else. And the only reason we\nsurvived because I got the snow for water and I got the cheese that I made him\nand he made me eat and nobody could ever find out.",
        "A: Right, a little piece at a time.",
        "A: First of all when there was enough people, people just dumped them overboard.\nBut then there was nobody to do it anymore so everybody that just died, they just\ndied. I saw a man dying who was out of his mind, shivering, things like that.\nAnd I found out that he was born in the town right next to my town and I just\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. And so when I got to Oranienburg I was still in pretty good\nshape. And as I was walking, this was I believe an air hangar for airplanes or\nsomething. And believe it or not, I come across somebody that we grew up\ntogether. We were together practically every day. And his name is David\n17\nYegher, too. And he lives in Lakewood, New Jersey right now. He wrote his\nbiography. He wrote it so the kids would have. He has it in there that I saved his\nlife. I don\u2019t know how I did it but I got some food for him. On top of being sick\nwhat it was he was also wounded from air raid. And I bandaged him up and I\nstayed with him until they were looking for healthy people and they picked me\nagain and guess where they sent me -- to Bergen-Belsen. I was in Bergen-Belsen\nand I saw like your eyes would never want to see. Just like flies people dying all\nover the streets and there was a wagon that was being pushed by people like us\npicking them up and just dumping them in the wagon and you see a hand or a leg\nor something stuck in the wheel or something and they just pushed the wagons\nand pushed the wagons. I didn\u2019t know where they were taking them but they\nwere just picking up the dead like you pick up logs or something. And again they\nare looking for somebody that is still in good health and I still was. That\u2019s when I\nlost, I separated from my friend because he was no longer able.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Spiegel. So when they took me to Bergen-Belsen and I was still with Spiegel,\nfrom Oranienburg to Belsen-Belsen, when I got to Bergen-Belsen, again they\nwere looking for people that were still in pretty good shape and I still was and\nthey took me to Oranienburg.",
        "A: No, no, no, from Oranienburg to Belsen-Belsen and from Belsen-Belsen they took\nme to Hamburg. They was a place called Desaoofa. Now, in Desaoofa where my\nstrength came to an end, they took me out in the morning to repair the railroads\nand the bridges that were bombed during the night. We always rode in some sort\nof a transport car, truck to get to the place or by train to where the place was\nbombed and we were repairing. But to come back, most of the time we couldn\u2019t\nride back because either the bridge was bombed, either the train was not available\nor something, we had to walk. So we walked and by the time we got to the place\ninto Desaoofa they had saved a kettle for soup for us because we were important\npeople to give us. But when we got there and they brought out the kettle of soup\nand we got in line, everybody got in line. And the guy was very nice; he took the\nsoup and he dumped it on the floor and we didn\u2019t get nothing to eat. And during\nthe night was air raids. We had to go down to the basement but the basement was\nfull of water when we get down. It took me four months to get me to the point\nwhere I could no longer stand on my feet. They loaded me into railroad cars that\nwe were told we\u2019re going back to Belsen-Belsen. The reason we were shipped to\nBergen-Belsen they should put us in the gas chambers or whatever in the\ncrematorium to get rid of us. But, God was with us. What happened was the\n18\nwhole time that they tried to reach Bergen-Belsen, there was air raids. They\nbombed this track, they bombed this track. They shifted us back and forth and\nthey never reached Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: Oh sure. As a matter of fact I was in one place whereby we were a little wooded\narea but we were not allowed to go into the shelters. But to the left of us -- there\nwas three corners. One was like a military, like a post office whatever it was and\none was an air shelter where all the Germans ran in and one was a bridge. Three\nbombs were direct hits. Our place was vibrating like you couldn\u2019t believe it. And\nthen they called us to come to the air shelter and to move the stuff. We removed\nthe dead bodies and things like that but nothing happened to us. So when they\ncouldn\u2019t get us anymore to Bergen-Belsen, they unloaded us in a place called\nZamposten. In this place, Zamposten, it wasn\u2019t a concentration camp, it was ----\nof course it was guarded, it didn\u2019t have electric wires whatever it was but it was a\nprisoner of war camp. And they unloaded us inn this place called Zamposten and\nthis was how shall I say it was like a ghost camp because there was no movement\nbecause everybody was weak and dying and so on.",
        "A: I was too weak to know. All I know is I was told that this is a prisoner of war\ncamp. I want you to know I am not a weakling. I want you to know my\ncondition, the way I felt and I\u2019m never going to forget that. I\u2019m always hunting,\nlooking to find something to eat. I finally found a potato and I finally dragged\nmyself to the trees to find some limbs to be able to build a fire to cook the potato,\nbake it or something.",
        "A: I found it someplace. But would you believe it I couldn\u2019t accomplish my goal\nbecause I didn\u2019t have the strength after I found a match. I couldn\u2019t have the\nstrength to light the match. Could you believe that. I was getting weaker and\nweaker and weaker by the minute and I was already in a situation that I didn\u2019t\nknow, I didn\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t get up, I couldn\u2019t move and I was ----- but I don\u2019t\nknow what happened in the next I don\u2019t even know how many days, I just don\u2019t\nremember. All I know is I was lifting my head one day and I saw the Germans\nrunning and the British running after them. Then I looked again and I saw the\nBritish running back and the Germans running after the British.",
        "A: From my barrack through the window. Then I saw the Germans and the British\nchasing them and that was the end But the next thing I knew, I remember, you\nsee the movies where there was people skin and bone, that\u2019s how I was. My thigh\n19\nright here I could take it around with my fingers. I remember one thing that\nsomebody coming with scissors and cutting off the striped pants and the shirt I\nhad on and lifting me up and putting me on a blanket which was put on a\nstretcher. I remember somebody putting some kind of powder or whatever it was\nand covering me with a blanket and that\u2019s all I know. I don\u2019t remember nothing\nelse until I came to in that used to be a German military barrack what they turned\ninto like a hospital. I remember them feeding me like you feed a baby with a\nbottle, the sweet milk. I remember them that after that giving me the broth from a\npotato. Then I remember them giving me the broth with a little potato init. And I\nhave started to recover really nice. Then I made a mistake because there were\nGermans, workers that were working for the military and somebody did me a\nfavor by giving me a piece of his sandwich. I had two bites and I swallowed it\nand I was dying. I remember one of the military doctors, because there was a few\ndoctors around trying to do whatever they\u2019re going to do and I heard one saying, I\ncan\u2019t let this one die because he is my challenge and he revived me. It took me\nfour months to be able to stand on my feet and being able. After that I just got up\none day and they told me where are you going to go, what are you going to eat,\nwhat are you going to be. I says, where I\u2019m going to go God knows, but I\u2019m\ngoing to go anywhere and everywhere to look for anybody that I can find to\nsurvive. And everywhere there was a camp that I heard of I somehow managed to\nget there by stopping in, begging for food, things like that. What can I tell you. I\nmet at the time people, German people, who fed me, who cried when they heard\nmy story. I also had people tell me that they are going to get even with America\nbecause they said the reason they lost the war was because America bombed their\ncities, their villages and their towns and they\u2019re going to get even with America. I\nwent in and I searched all over the Germany where it was under the British\noccupation. Then I wanted to know if I can find some more people. So I went\nacross the border. I just don\u2019t know. They were so strict of having people going\nacross the border.",
        "A: Between the British zone to the American zone. But I fooled all of them and I\nwent across to the American occupied territory. This is how I came to America,\nfrom the American zone.",
        "A: I came to the United States in 1948. It was April 17 that I came into the United\nStates.",
        "A: Yes I was going to various camps and I was living in various camps until one day\nthat lady found me. That changed my life. And of course, the rest is history.\n20\nWhen I landed in New York and I came in and I was sponsored by the United\nJewish Appeal. But I was sponsored to come to America I don\u2019t even know who\nthe people were that I was assigned to go west. So when I came to New York I\nran into some people. They knew of my people, I ran into some people that I\nknew at the Hotel Marseille, 103\" Street and Broadway. When they came to me\nand they told me that they have me assigned and when am I ready to go west and I\nsaid to them I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know west, east. All I know is that I found a few\npeople. It\u2019s not my relatives but it\u2019s some people, a few people that I knew and to\nme this is my family. And I said I like to stay here. And they said to me well,\nthey want me to know if I stay that I will be strictly on my own. They cannot be\nresponsible for me or give me any assistance or financial or anything like that.\nAnd I said to them, haven\u2019t you done enough for me already. You brought me out\nto America. I guarantee you that I won\u2019t be no burden to you. In a country like\nthis where you can go out and have a job and make a living. And they said okay\nyou\u2019re on your own and I\u2019ve been on my own. I worked, I got a job, I was\nworking in this place. Oh, I worked hard. I was making $50 a week and I worked\nfrom eight o\u2019clock in the morning until eleven o\u2019clock at night seven days a week.",
        "A: No, cooking. And so after working a year I got a raise, not money, but I mean I\ngot working six days.",
        "A: Yeah, then after working two years over there I heard about the Catskills and I\nheard about the places. I went to work as an assistant chef to a place which was\nvery well known at the time called Pioneer Country Club at Greenfield Park, New\nYork which was kosher, strictly kosher. They were so impressed with me, they\nhad a hotel, the Edwards Hotel in Florida, they were paying me some assistant\nchef $150, so I went from $50 to $150. But I went to Florida and worked for\nthem. As first chef I went from $150 to $400. I worked for them two years. Then\nI got to be so well known because the people who have eaten where they stayed\nand people came from other hotels because they liked the food so much that I had\ntwo agents who were signing up my jobs. I did that for ten years and believe it or\nnot I did that from 1950 to \u201951 actually. That was the first year I went until \u00b058\nwhen I came to Washington. I was in those years making a thousand dollars a\nweek because while I was in Germany hunting around and finding places where\nDP\u2019s were, DP camps, so I used to work in hotels and restaurants and I learned to\nbake and butcher and do everything and this was my profession. So when I came\nto Washington, I didn\u2019t realize then, I was the chef, one of the most popular, the\nbest restaurant in Washington, Duke Zieberts. I was there four and a half years.\nThen I went into business for myself and I operated Yegher\u2019s kosher caterers.\nWhen you work, whatever money you make, you know I had a family and kids,\nyou are just not able to save a lot of money but I was able to save up $3,000 and I\nwent into the business. I made a very good living and I sold it for $1,010,000\n21\ncash. I sold it and I went into the Pavilion in the Old Post Office and I left\nSeptember a year ago, the Pavilion.",
        "A: Well there was nothing to sell. My lease was up and while I was there I just\ndidn\u2019t make any money. It was just a very bad arrangement. Everybody that ever\ngoes in there has a hard time. It\u2019s just not a money proposition because it\u2019s so\nover-rated and it looks so glorious and looks so over, over, over promoted that\npeople just don\u2019t realize you just can\u2019t make a living. I know people there who\nare absolutely starving in business. They have no money to take care of their\nchildren and no money to live, just waiting for -- you know. So I managed to\nhold on because I didn\u2019t have to hire no chef. I didn\u2019t have to hire no expensive\nwhatever you want to call it and I was able to hold out until my lease is up and I\njust took my equipment and I came out here. My situation right here, I hope to be\nable to find a bank who\u2019s going to lend me money to build a road. What you see\nright here I own nineteen acres with all of them buildings and it\u2019s all free and\nclear.. And I\u2019m hoping to get a loan and then I\u2019m going to open and then I\u2019m\ngoing to retire.",
        "A: Well, it has a lot of ifs and buts about it. For this to be kosher, I would like it to\nbe kosher, but if it\u2019s not going to be kosher is because it will be determined that\nit\u2019s just not a market to support it. So it all depends, it all depends. I haven\u2019t\nreally decided yet but I will have to do -- remember one thing, I am a survivor.\nI\u2019m going to do whatever I have to do to survive.",
        "A: Oh, how can I forget, I mean it started little things, slowly. You have no idea.\nFirst you had to register. After you registered they imposed various restrictions.\nYou couldn\u2019t walk from one town to the other; you couldn\u2019t be out at night; you\ncouldn\u2019t have no windows facing the main road, have to be blocked.",
        "A: Yes, and they were deporting Jews what they called it where people had to\nevacuate because of the front lines and they needed people to work the fields. So\nthey came in with this clever thing by saying that all the Jews who don\u2019t have\nenough means of living and supporting themselves and what they have within\ntheir farm. For instance; we had no problems; we had enough food, we had\nenough things, we had enough things we never needed to leave the farm. We had\nwheat, bread, you know all the things in the summer, in the winter.\n22",
        "A: Self sufficient, and we even sold a lot. So there was no problem with us but there\nwere Jews taken who were very cleverly misrepresented because they were taking\nJews to Galicia and then we found out they weren\u2019t taking them to work, they\nwere taking them and they dug deep trenches and shot them all. But there were\nsome people that somebody, somehow, that the word got out. Wherever they did,\nthey did it in such a way by always giving you a reason. We need to evacuate the\npeople because the ones that don\u2019t have enough sufficient to sustain, to live,\nwhatever they have on their farm because they are not allowed to work, you\u2019re\nnot allowed to walk, you have to stay on your farm, those are the Jews that they\ntook. Then they come to the Jews and they said, well everybody of such and such\nage had to report to the military. That\u2019s when they took my brother. Then they\ncame again and they said no school, no Jews are allowed to go to school; no Jews\nare allowed to congregate; no Jews are allowed to go to the synagogue; no Jews\nare allowed to have communications of any kind with one another. Everything\nyou have on the farm you have to deliver to such and such a place, whatever the\ncrops and things like that. I remember my father dug a hole in the barn and put in\nsacks of wheat so we would have. In case whatever, 1n reserve or something. But\nwe didn\u2019t know that when you put in sacks of wheat in the ground and the wheat\ntouches the ground on the side, the wheat turns to dirt. It started cultivation and\ngrowing. When we uncovered it, whatever it had, lumber on the top and hay or\nsomething, there was only a little bit in the middle that was still useable.\nEverything else was all turned. We had no experience. We had known we would\nhave put lumber on the side, on the bottom but we didn\u2019t know. When we didn\u2019t\nhave wheat we ground the beans for flour and made some kind of bread out of\nbeans because we just couldn\u2019t get because even in the farm when you get\nwhatever you get in the winter time you have to be able to exchange and trade and\nmarket, you just cannot ---- We were lucky because we, now for instance,\npotatoes -- we dug a hole in the ground and we put straw on the outside and on the\nbottom and then we covered with straw and we put dirt on it, it was just like\nfields. Then we used to go and dig out potatoes. So we always found some\nthings. Every day of course you had to wear the Star of David.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember of they distributed it or you made it or you\ngot it, [have no idea. And as always there was never a let down. There was\nnever a let down one day that they would leave you alone. There was always this\nconstant harassment, nudging -- today you have to do this, today you have to do\nthis, today you have to do this constantly. And they wore you down, wore you\nout, wore you down.",
        "A: How old were you when decrees began\u201d",
        "A: I was thirteen years old.\n23",
        "A: What are you talking about? I only had four years of public school. That\u2019s it. I\nhad very little schooling but I did have training in Jewish, I went to cheder. I\nlearned in cheder. I know how to daven pretty good. I know all there is to know.\nI learned from my father. I was with him ----",
        "A: I mean he used to pray all the time and he used to be so observant and so religious\nand such a good person.",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t wear no beard but he used some kind of paste to dissolve the hair or\nsomething because you\u2019re not allowed to use a razor. But anyway ----",
        "A: Oh, I had anti-Semitism all the time. I grew up with that. Let me tell you\nsomething. I was a tough kid, and I mean I was a tough kid. I was not bothered\nby anybody because to me, I would never back down and even if I encountered ---\n--- I encountered a bunch of school, my younger age you know, and there was\nsomebody by the name of Kuza that they had thought, he got after the Jews at the\ntime, even before the Germans came. And they got surrounded me and they\nwanted me to say Treaska Kuza which means in Romanian long live Kuza. And I\nwouldn\u2019t say it.",
        "A: That was the guy like George Lincoln Rockwell over here. And Kuza organized\nmen who were going on the trains and when they found a Jew they threw him off\nthe train while the train was running, through the window, beat him up and things\nlike that. So anyway they tried to get me to say Treaska Kuza and I wouldn\u2019t say\nit. But I knew one thing. There was about five, six kids my age and I knew that if\nI took care of the leader that they would scatter. They had me surrounded and the\nguy who was the leader was telling to me to say Treaska Kuza and I got closer\nand closer to him and I used my right foot and I kicked him in the balls. He bent\nover screaming and when he did the rest of them, and I hit him afterwards, and I\nsaid who is next? And they all ran away. That was one thing and I was attacked\nanother time. I was a tough kid. Somebody was going to hit me and I took his\narm and I was going to put him over my shoulder, flip him over, but I did a\nterrible thing, what I did I had his hand backwards and I broke his arm. Nobody\nbothered me again. They knew I was a tough kid. When I went to school even I\nalso spoke very good Romanian and the teacher was trying to break up the Jewish\n24\nkids, there was two in a bench and so they got and they put one gentile and one\nJew because they wanted not that the Jewish kid to be able to talk in Yiddish and\ncarry on together. But there was me and one more kid from the other end of the\ntown. They let us sit together. Well they said because we spoke fluently,\nRomanian, so they didn\u2019t have to do it. But whatever it was -- I was a tough kid.",
        "A: Well, we were constantly harassed, no question about it, constantly harassed. I\nremember one time, I don\u2019t remember exactly what happened. Somebody, I don\u2019t\nknow, hit my father with a rifle and my father told my sister to go and get the\npolice because we were on pretty good terms with the police. My mother\nwouldn\u2019t let her out of the house. As a matter of fact it\u2019s a good thing she didn\u2019t\nbecause the guy was outside who hit my father, he was outside in the street and\nafter a few minutes if my sister, if anybody would have come out he would have\nshot us. But instead of shooting us he used his rifle to shoot and he shot the\ngeese. There was a flock of geese and he shot the geese with the bullets. And so\nmy mother, she wouldn\u2019t let my sister go out and she just stayed in the house\ndown until he left. What can I tell you. This transport that went from Gleiwitz to\nOranienburg that was a suffering. I\u2019m telling you. There were some people that\ngot off the train when the train had to slow down, whatever, and they started to\nrun away. They were just shot, they were just shot.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: You better believe it. You stay close together and when one side is warm you\nturn the other side to each other.",
        "A: No, no, no, you never think of that. You constantly think what to do to survive.\nYou constantly plan what to do, how to do, what to survive. You don\u2019t think of\nit\u2019s good, you don\u2019t think of it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just like somebody is out in the desert\nand they\u2019re dying from thirst and when you see them in the movies, when they\u2019re\nrunning, when they see water, what do you think these people are going to be\nthinking of? Their entire body and mind and soul and power and strength is just\nto get to that water. Well that\u2019s the kind of conditioned that you become that you\nconstantly like fatigue just thinking where can I find something to eat. You don\u2019t\nthink of nothing else. You just think, how can I survive the next hour. And you\n25\nare constantly thinking just of that. And there is nothing else because you are in\nsuch a pain for hunger , you\u2019re in such a pain trying to find something to eat that\nyou just don\u2019t ever have anything else on your mind. You\u2019re just frustrated, how\ncan I find something to eat to get rid of the pain. And that\u2019s the way the whole\nsituation is. And you constantly manipulate and maneuver and you constantly\nlook to find something, something that you can eat, constantly. You constantly\nplan where to be. When I used to do the side work all the time.",
        "A: The gardening and polishing the shoes and making the beds and things like that.\nThat\u2019s what it took and you\u2019re just so helpless, you\u2019re just so useless, you\u2019re just\nso without nothing you can do. It\u2019s just like you see so many people dying, you\nsee so many people starving, you see so many people, there\u2019s nothing you can do,\nthere\u2019s nothing you can do. It\u2019s just like you are walking along the roads and\nthere\u2019s an earthquake and you get covered and you\u2019re dying. What can you do?\nNothing! There\u2019s nothing you can do. And I don\u2019t know why is there always that\nsomebody always comes up in a generation and always has the right, he feels he\nhas the right to destroy the Jews. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know.\nAll of a sudden the Jewish life becomes so cheap and so nobody sets any value on\nit and Jewish life -- I mean I saw the crematoriums.",
        "A: Yes. I mean how in the world can ever be somebody ever able to do\nsystematically like a lumber factory, like a manufacturer that produces cars,\nsystematically gassing and burning human beings, never mind Jews, just\nsomebody. What in the world does ever anybody ever has gotten the idea that he\nhas the right to do that. How in the world? I just recently applied for the\nWiedergud Machel because I just never wanted anything from them because I\njust never wanted anything from them. But some of my friends just talked me\ninto it by saying, you\u2019re going to get old, you never know what\u2019s going to happen,\nwhy shouldn\u2019t you be able to get something out of it? They took enough from\nyou. So, but it\u2019s already too late. Anyway I filed with the Mead organization in\nNew York. They told me that they might be able to overturn something,\nwhatever. You can never tell. But the situation is ------ Because I\u2019m a Holocaust\nsurvivor and because of this area I have been approached many different ways,\nmany different times, especially when they had the Eichmann trials I had been\nfollowed by reporters. Wanted to know what I\u2019m going to say.",
        "A: Reaction. I was also on television. There was a guy here on Alan King show that\nhe was the one that hunted down Klaus Barbie. I was on TV because he wanted\nto have somebody to talk about.\n26",
        "A: Larry King, yeah. And so my last statement was that I hope that the world would\nlearn what a horrible thing the Nazis did to the world and to the Jews especially.\nAnd I hope that never again would anything ever be instituted something of that\nnature and whatever. So I had quite a few calls because I was in the kosher\ncatering and I was very well honored with dignity and respect. People knew me\nand they called mw to tell me what a wonderful thing I did and said. So we\u2019re\ngoing to have a Holocaust Museum here?",
        "A: And I hope to God that it will be there to be able to that the world never forgot\nwhat the world did and a lot of it could have been prevented but the world didn\u2019t\nlift a finger. And again we were alone and no defense, nobody. And the people\nthat could do, didn\u2019t. They made it that they didn\u2019t want to be involved. Well, I\nhope to God that the State of Israel will exist and be able to because God forbid\nthis time and God forbid if the State of Israel should ever be destroyed or\noverpowered that there wouldn\u2019t be no more State of Israel and this time we will\nnot escape. It will be the end of the Jewish for sure and that I can tell you because\nas many enemies we got now and as many ways they now know how to\nexterminate and will be absolutely merciless.\n27\n"
