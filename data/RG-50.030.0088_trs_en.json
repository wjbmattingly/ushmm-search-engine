        "Q: Can you tell us your name and where and when you were born?",
        "A: I would be delighted. My name is Israel Gruzin. I born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, they\nsay 1n a place I born in 1928, December the 28th but now I am putting myself on May the\nAth, and I am going to tell you the story.",
        "Q: You're going to tell us the story later?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about your life in Slobodka and about your family and your brothers\nand sisters, if you have any?",
        "A: I had a brother, of course. I was born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, in Vilajampole. We had a\nnormal life. My father was not a millionaire but he made a nice living. He was doing\nsome business with Russians and things like this, and 1t was binders from boot sales and\nselling this from the houtgarba(ph) to make leather out of it. I was going to school. I was\ngoing, of course, to Cheder, a Hebrew school and my brother the same thing. And we\nwas going on a normal life. Of course, we had the little- the Lithuanians was not always\nwith Jews. There was stories all over the place, but we had a normal life and living like\nnormal people, and then, of course, in 1940 came the Russians because the war started\nalready with the Germans. It was not a war yet, but when the Germans came to Poland --\nbut the Russians came to Lithuania and then the Russians occupied Lithuania close to a\nyear, and then the war started in 1940.",
        "Q: Tell me what changed when the Russians came.",
        "A: It was a little different because you will -- I was going to a, to Hebrew school and then all\nof a sudden I was going to a Jewish school. They are cutting down on the religious part.\nThey were trying to make all the children like sort like patriotic and, of course, when\nyou're young you think is the future. But my father was always against the regime\nbecause of Communism. In fact, he got arrested one time. One time he got a chicken he\nwas carrying this to the street and he was stopped. What do you have a chicken for? And\nhe was afraid to tell everything to go to officially. They arrested him and after a couple\nhours, but they let them out. They didn't want to get the men for the chicken. You can\nimagine my father didn't care much for the Communists. But I was not myself. I liked the\nmovie and things like that. But 1t was really normal. It was a little different with the new\nregime, but I was too young to see the difference.",
        "Q: Let me ask you to go back before the Russians came. You said there was a lot of\nAntisemitism?",
        "A: There was because I can experience to start with, because I remember my father bought a\nbicycle for my brother. I was the younger and he was a year older. We were riding one\ntime and I was saying, let me ride, let me ride, and all of sudden there was a few boys,\nnot Jewish, and one of them got a stick and put it right in the springs and he broke the\nbicycle, and like young boys, of course, we chasing them. You broke the bicycle. How\ncome you broke the bicycle? And where I was living in -- we got a little farther out --\nwas a church and we chased them to the church and, of course, course the police came\nout and let the two buys in and he put the foot in this door and he told us, go away you\nZyds. I told them and this time, of course, I spoke. I forgot \u2014Lithuanian, I was going born\nthere-- them I told him he broke the bicycle and he kept saying, go away. Of course, I\ncouldn\u2019t fight him. It was experience. We came back home and my father took this\nbicycle to the man that fixed the bicycle and fixed it. But you had a feeling like you were\nalways not so welcome, like because I'm Jewish.",
        "Q: Did you have Lithuanian friends?",
        "A: Like I said, I was neighbors with a few of them, but in general I was in the Cheder. But in\nthe area I was living there was Jewish people. But we had a few people from the\na restaurant there. His son was a little friendly with us, and we were playing as\nchildren, but didn't have too many Lithuanian friends.",
        "Q: Did you hear about the Germans and the Nazis while the Russians were there?",
        "A: Oh, of course, in 1933 when the Russians came into Poland. Of course, my father was a\nmiddle-aged man and he talked about it with my mother, and he showed the papers a\nlittle bit, in the Jewish papers and the Lithuanian papers what was going on in Poland, the\nliquidations and the killing over there. And it was we started. A lot of Jewish run away\nfrom Poland and come to Lithuania. In fact, when the army, the Polish army, fight the\nGermans they came to Lithuanian because some of them didn't want to stay with the\nGermans. But most of them was happy to have the Germans in Poland.",
        "Q: You were very young. Did you hear your parents talking about it and did you read the\nnewspapers?",
        "A: Yes. I couldn't understand a little bit and there was politic involved, and I could hear it\nand feel it, and when I see in the, whatever, I saw in the paper I realized this that we are\nnot welcome. Something is going to come back and my father kept saying what was the\nnext step. He didn't realize that the Germans were going to attack the Russians this time,\nbut when the war started and they start feeling that the Germans are coming. But my\nfather reading the papers and knowing what is going on. It's time to leave everything and\nrun because what is going on in Poland is maybe going to be the same thing here in\nLithuania. And we had a horse and wagon, and I have a lot of stories to tell. We had a\nsmall little horse and we are using it to take the coals from -- it was a little like a pony. It\nwas like a dog. You talk to him like a dog and this horse was doing things that were\nbelievable. And my father had two horses but my father took the smaller horse and the\nwagon and take the few things we can take with us, and we made the journey to run away\nfrom the Lithuania. And the Germans were always bombing the airport, and a lot of Jews\nstart running to get away from the army.",
        "Q: And this is in 1941?",
        "A: This is in 1941. And only the same time these bombs was falling and, of course, the\nLithuanians were so happy to see the Germans coming, they're sabotaging the Russian\nArmy tanks, putting on fire and burning 6 the tire and shooting on them. And all of\nsudden their own rifles and putting on the Lithuania uniform and really taking advantage\nof the situation and start right away with the Jews, of course, but we didn't have enough\n-- it was too fast. We left. They day they started throwing the bombs, my father took the\nhorse and wagon and we was going to get out of there. And we are running the streets\nwith the Russian Army and we were going to Latvia. A lot of people in this area. You can\ngo to Latvia and then to Minsk, and then from Minsk to White Russia, but we didn't make\nthe journey so far. We just took that horse and wagon. We have involved with the\nRussian Army and then, of course, the Germans were bombing the streets and we were\ngoing through the hole. I say the Holocaust, dead people right away from the first time,\nand my mother, in fact, was shot, slit. The bomb cut in her leg we were running in this\nway. We were going in the same direction as the Russian army. There was always fires\nand dead people on the streets and a lot of them couldn't make it. You know, the soldiers\nand a lot of people riding the horses didn't make it. We kept on going and then, of course,\nwe came to the border of Latvia. We came in at Minsk. There was a lot of Latvian people\nthere, but we hear right away from the Gentile people that something going on, terrible\nthings going on against the Jews, even in Minsk. But we were lucky and we were still\ngoing in the car with the Russians, the army. But the army was really practically 99\npercent in a chaos, didn't know what they are doing. One was running right and one was\nrunning left, and then I remember one thing, that we were running, going with the wagon\nand two Jewish guys came over and said you have to give us a ride. My father said, Look,\nI got a little tiny horse. We have four people. We won't make it. They took out a revolver\nand they point it at my father. They said, look, you are going to sit down and we are\ngoing with you. Also because we can\u2019t walk. They might look a little Communist\ninclined, I don't know. Maybe they are soldiers, and then we are running like this. Not\nrunning, driving and driving and driving and then, all of a sudden we had an attack with\nmachine guns and I felt -- I was in the wagon with my mother and my brother and my\nfather was driving the horse and the two men, and then all of a sudden we hear a\nsomething. We hear a scream and one of them says, Oy, Oy. We look and then he laying,\nfall back and a bullet went right in the man part, in this -- right in his, in the part, the men\npart, and it went in this -- excuse the expression -- right in where it aches for the men. He\ncould feel the bullet. He could touch it. The other man said, don't do nothing. Drive\nfaster the horse. Drive the horse, and then we were already in Latvia, and then we\nstopped and they are still with us two days, and then this man stopped some other people\nand, of course, speak fluent Russian and they made us stop for a day, like a half a day and\nthey said we should go closer to the water. And they took him out of the wagon and they\nsaid to us, they thanked us for the ride and giving them the ride and we left them right by\nthe water. And I said, how can you leave them by the water? And he said, I made\narrangements to the other side because the other side of the river, the Russian Army was\na little bit more organized. It could start to fight back. It made like a zone to fight back,\nand we left them there. My father didn't want to leave the man. After all, he didn't know\nhim and now the man is wounded, and they kept on saying -- I was a boy and I could see\nthat it was his part and there was a bullet, and the other man was going to take it out and\nmy father said, don't do it. You'll kill him. And anyway we left him by the edge of the\nwater and we started going farther. We are already -- my father and my brother and my\nmother alone, and my father kept the tallis, you know, the tallis what you 9 wear, and he\nkeep it on the wagon with him, and this he took with him. We are going there and then\nnobody to talk, but luckily my father was fluent in Latvian, is different, similar but\ndifferent. My mother didn't speak Latvia, and I, of course, didn't and my brother didn't.\nThen he hear some from -- somebody told us that we are Jewish. You are one of\nthem. The Germans were not even there yet. We didn't know what was going on. And go\nthere, make a left and a right there. And there was a farm and there was a Jew. Maybe he\ncan give you directions. Anyway, we came over there. He had a farm and two sons and\nall kinds of animals there, chickens and cows and pigs, and all this. And there was a little\ntown and the whole people looked like they like them over there because he was a very\nnice man. And my father said to him, what should we do? And he said, I am in the same\nboat like you are. The war was going on. We didn't know how long it was going to go. So\nstay with us for a while. And we stay for two or three days, and then on the other side of\nthe farm was close to the water, maybe a quarter of a mile. And my father said to him,\nmaybe we could go over to the other side. But we couldn't. He wanted to go over. The\nreason -- I skipped a little bit. The reason we came to this 10 place, he wanted to go to\nLatvia. The Russian go over to Latvia. There was bridge and the Russian Army exploded\nthe bridge because -- then the tanks and the army. Their own people. There was a lot of\nJewish, and on the bridge, we were lucky not to make the time on the bridge. If we were\non the bridge we would be exploded too. Right before our eyes we saw the bridge\ncollapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants,\nreally. With their rifles and they couldn't even walk. They got on the other side. We\nremained on our side and the people on the other side, there was still the army holding\nthe gun. But a couple days on the farm with this man I said to my father, let me see what\nwas going on. And we took the little boat. We really wanted to go over. He said, I can't\ntake anyone right now. I was going in the nighttime. I was not there and my father, said\noh, my God, what is going on there? They are fighting with the Germans and\nand the Jewish and he found out. And they couldn't make it back on the other side, but he\ncame back with this man from the farm. And he came back and said, look, he said, it is\nbad. I am taking my horse and wagon and I am going. He had some people that came to\nhim and said, ride it out from the 11 people. And we are left completely alone, and this\nwas like in evening and I said to my father -- and my father's name was Heim(ph) -- and\nhe shake hands with him. I got my family and you have yours. I have to go my way. I\ncan't take you where I'm going. We go where we can and then, of course, we made the\njourney to go back because we couldn't go to the other side. We were trying to go back\nfrom where we came. That's why I said the little horse was like a dog. We didn't know\nwhere to go and my father said to him, go horse. He didn't know where to go and he was\nafraid to ask for directions, things like this. And luckily like I said in the beginning, my\nfather speaks Latvia, and we starting to move back in one little town and , the small\ntowns. And all of a sudden we hear from the people, the Gentile people, the Germans are\nmoving slowly. And then all of a sudden we see a German truck with soldiers and oh, my\nfather said, we are already under the Germans. We caught from the Germans. We are\ngoing. My father was smart and took that horse and took some mud and smeared up the\nhorse and made the wagon look like farmers and look not like Jewish people, because he\nhide the tallis that he had. We are going there and people are greeting us. People thought\nwe are going from one , from one little 12 town to another little town. We are\ngoing back to where we go back to from there we went to . We saw where\nwe came to before we go with the Russians and we saw the bombs. We didn't\nsee the city. It was really wiped out. It was bombed. We didn't want to go but still some\nbuildings were still remaining there, and then all of a sudden we come in on the highways\nwhere the German Army with this music with this big truck of ___ and tanks. And we\nare five going farther than them. We are going farther and they are going backwards. And\nthey kept on saying in German , things like this. We knew how to speak\nGerman too and, of course, my father knew we are all right. But of course, my father\nknew more, but the Jewish and German is very similar. But in this experience we are\ngoing down to a house, a bag to grab it and saw it on the ground and it exploded. It was\nlike a bomb. They didn't know if we are Jewish or not, but they didn't care. They were\nsoldiers but when we came in to this town -- and we are still in and someone\nfrom the windows up from the top, what are you doing? Someone will recognize us. We\nare not Latvia. There was a Russian man that said to my father, this Russian. It is now six\no'clock. Nobody is allowed to be on the street. Move off to 13 the side because they are\ngoing to destroy you. My father understand stood Russian too and we moved over, right\nwhere we could in the corner, and the night came and wagons and the machine guns and\nthe airplanes and the bomb. And German Army is so powerful, and this was in the\nmorning. We saw people start moving. We saw civilian people also. Then we start going\nagain with our horse. The journey to go back to Lithuania. And my father stopped and\nasked an old lady. Why didn't you have the directions? Are you not from here? And he\nsaid, no, to her. No, we're not from here, and she said oh, my God. Don't tell them that\nyou are Jewish they. Are killing all the Jews and killing all the Jews. It's in this\nlittle town and this little town. And my father, of course, explained to us, he said to us, go\nand don't ask nobody. If you are going to ask a question, where you are going, you will\nnot be. Keep on going. I can give you good directions and you go over the highways.\nAnd we have to go where the army was. Don't ask for directions. My father didn't want to\nask for corrections, and he put in the tallis for good luck and they were driving by us. He\nput in the tallis, you know, for good luck and driving by ourself. And all of sudden we\nsee soldier and already the Partisans 14 and the Latvia people, they put in their uniform\nand they're running and the flowers they got for the Germans, and the womens get all\nkind of and they -- and then Partisans with rifles and knives came over to us, first\nwith bicycle and come off the street because my father was making sort of like, sort of\nlike . You should be too much with the hiding because the army is going there.\nThey stopped us and they said to him, where are you going? to my father, and my father\nsaid to him, oh, I know you. Because he spoke the language and they were drunk, really\ndrunk and bloody, full blood like , you know. My father said to him, I know your\nfather. Do you know? he said. He said, I have a little farm -- they were so drunk\nthey didn't know what was going on. And they asked my father, did you see any Jews?\nJews? I saw so many Jews not too far, half a kilometer. Full of Jews. People with a lot of\nfences, sitting and telling a story. Oh, for this one, let's drink. In Lithuania, oh, this one\nlet's, drink and, you know, opened up a bottle of some vodka. And my father was\ndrinking and said to my brother and myself and to my mother, keep on moving, move,\nmove, and he said keep on moving, to my brother, who was a little older. And my brother\ntook the horse and started moving, and made 15 him to drink. And he drink a little bit. He\nhad to take a sip and he said to them, take them . Keep on moving. Move away\nfrom the wagon we were maybe -- keep it moving so my brother was a little older and he\ntook the horse and he keeps moving. They made him to drink a little bit, a sip, what it\ntook, and he said to them, take them. My father says, keep moving with the wagon. We\nwere maybe two or three foot away from him and then my father start running to him and\nhe said oh, thank God. I get rid of them. Then we keep on going farther and we came into\na little town. It was called -- this was already before we came, we passed the border\nbecause there were no border because the Germans already took over everything. They\nopened up all the borders. It was not Latvia. No one was guiding there. We came into the\nborder there. Of course, we saw what was going on. We was scared. We saw dead people\nright and left, right and left. Jewish people and the Russian people were laying,\nslaughtered like so many pigs. First time I saw dead people and was the first time for me\nand of course, you see dead people more and more and more. We came to a little town\ncalled Milkinmeer(ph). It was not bombed. It was a nice little town. In fact, my uncle\ncame from there. 16 There was . There was a house full. We went riding for --\nlike I say, the horse was and my father didn't want to ask for directions, and we\ncame over there. We looked like farmers. He made it so we didn't, monotonous and tired\nand things like this. We came into this little town and we came to a big house that was\nmaybe four are or five stories, and the Partisans were standing with rifles, and there were\nonly Jews. They put them all in this house and screams and one of them from the\nwindow recognized when we went by, and someone screamed in, you are Jewish\nmove away, move away, and we looked up and , but luckily they didn't stop us.\nWe going farther. It took us another day and a half and two days before we came to the\nSlobodka. Someone was arriving there. This was after the bombs because we came a\nlittle later. It was raining in the streets and it was mostly red, like they killed animals. It\nwas from people. We didn't see too many because they pulled me away. And whatever. It\nwas really -- you could see blood in the streets instead of water. When we came\nwe came to our street. We were leaving. The horse was like a dog. This horse brought us\nby the door. When we leaving there was a house. There was a house, four-story house\nand there 17 was a gate like a door. You opened up and our house was in the back. The\nback was nice. There was a garden. My father was renting. This man was a he\nhad a drug store. He built his house. It was a modern house and we lived in the back of\nthe house, and before he was living on the property, not ours but there was a garden and\ntook kind of some land and build a big house in front of this, in front the street, and we\ncame to this to go into the gates. It was locked up. We couldn't go in. My father tried to\nopen it up. It was locked. The people came to the window and we recognized they were\nneighbors. Why did you come here? You know. My father said I just came from traveling\nback from Latvia. How can you do this? Nobody's on the street. It's empty. Everybody is\ndead. Somebody came down and let us in the gate they close it right up and\nstarted telling us these stories. And all the neighbors, this street and this street. You could\nsee to the window our street. This particular area they didn't make it here, they don't\ncome here. They are still afraid they are going to come here. The house was empty. The\nhouse was still there. Nobody touched the house and of course, we run back to the house\nand the next we stayed overnight in our house. And all of sudden we hear 18\nloudspeakers in this area and the streets were running full with Germans, you know,\nbecause when we came in it was so quiet. And there was loudspeakers and this\nwhere they are making the ___ but my father was, of course, a little see what\nwas going on. See if my mother's brother was there. He run away and escaped. They went\nto Russia. My father was going. I had my grandfather there and he was going to see his\nmother and father but he was still there, safe in the . It was next day they killed all\nthe people in Latvia. You were safe from the it was next door they killed all the\npeople. My grandmother, they hide her under the bed and they didn't find her. It was a\nlittle house, you know, they look and nobody was there. They didn't kill them this time\nbut they get them anyway. They had loudspeakers in the area. We could hear it. It was in\nthe area of the ghetto, but they took from all the Jews, and people start coming in the next\nday. My father go downtown to find out and I go with him. And the horses was so tired\nand couldn't go. We tried to give it a little bit water and it was walking. Was hard. Maybe\ngoing to take the horse and go we drive about ten blocks still Slobodka. We saw the -- we\nsaw the little spitting on the Jew and doing -- all 19 the Germans, already the\nsoldiers. It was not organized yet . All of a sudden we saw this, these uniforms.\nThey are talking, the Gestapo and the Nazi, and so the people start coming from\ndowntown. In our area there was no gates or wire or nothing and my father was driving\nand he wanted to see my grandfather. The problem we wanted to see if the uncle\nwas down in the city we. Drive for several blocks. We look where the used to\nbe. I had no window. They cut off the head from the robber and put it right in the\nwindow, and my father see, and myself too and my brother was going with me too\nbecause my mother was in the house and my father said, I'm not going. Father can see\nwhat was going on and we went back to our home. It was not taking too long. It was\nabout three, four days. All of a sudden the Germans were the army against the Jews. They\npull everybody from all the towns and all over and and they come in with trucks\nand big machines. And they bringing the wires and, you know, they came up with\nloudspeakers, everything, everybody has to go out and help building the gates and the\nwiring. And they went out and told them where to go. They got my brother and my father\nbut not me. Our house was about 500 foot away from the next street 1t was . 20\nThere was the fire. Already it was a street, a main highway. It was like a connection they\nmade. This was a big they made from the other side there was Jews too. They\nmade wires between two streets and they made the bricks over to go where we shouldn't\nbe. We have to build the ghetto ourself and then, of course, they get so organized. They\ncame in with, like I say, the Germans. The Germans alone didn't have a part in the\nbrutality because the and the Poles and the Latvia and have -- everybody was\nhelping the Germans to kill the Jews. Like I saying, they were killing already but\nsomehow we made it through the things. And of course, they putting everybody on the\nwires in this area and then they say five kilometers or ten kilometers and couldn't see on\nthe map. I couldn't decipher it. Then they put in all the people from the sides and put the\ngates, they told us it was going to be a couple weeks before the ghetto was created. But I\nalready had experience in Poland. Look like it. They, right away, they took the young\npeople for work and my uncle, rest in peace, he was one, the first one. And he was taken\nright away from the ghetto, and the second they came in with trucks and wagons and\nmade a liquidation. Young children and old people. They have a special area where they\nare 21 going to leave and, of course, they came in to my grandfather and grandmother\nand they put them right away on the truck, and some other people. And in fact, I was\nrunning to see my grandfather and when I get there, the Germans coming in and open up\nthe wires in this area. They didn't go around. They came in and closed up again. When I\nsee this area closing up with the rifle and the soldiers and the knives, then I turn back. I\nwas afraid because I knew not to go there because I was born there. There was a\nSlobodka the Jewish people they were going to be . This was still in the\nghetto this time but I knew not to go away, to go through there. It was like a little\ncorridor between the two buildings. But when I say they closing the up the area with my\ngrandmother and grandfather, I didn't go back there luckily. If not, I would be catched by\nthem and not even here. Then they started taking out people. We didn't know where and\nthen, of course, they took them right away to Nitenfort(ph) and they killed them. I'm\ntalking this was tons of people. I couldn't give a number, and this was going on for a little\nwhile. And right away the Germans came in with and the Jewish people to make\nyou going to there and you going to this, and they are started getting organized. I 22\nwould say three or four weeks this got already a , you know, Jews come\nand they got people. They are putting the star of and they making people in\ncharge. You do this and you do this. And people from the other parts, Latvia and\nnever had enough food -- got involved in this, start taking out people already from the\nghetto right away from work. The people going to work on the airport or the they\ncall this. It was before the Russian, but the Germans took it over and they took people for\nlabor. And I myself was supposed to go too, but somehow I had a chance to stay back.\nMore and more we get tougher and tougher. Every day was they put the people in\nour house and what we have? Kitchen and dining room and living room, a bedroom,\neverything was in a long straight. If you go to the kitchen, you go to the dining room -- it\nwas a long house. I couldn't compare the house like they have here. It was a nice but in\nthis house we are living four people, but they put in 15 people. They put in people if my\nwhatever we had. This was already in the ghetto. Then they started taking out. By\nthis time the make the Auschwitz. They start taking out people they had more room to\nrelease the prisoners. They came in and said there were too many people in your 23\nhouse. It was going on like this for a little, a house we have plenty of room for them. It\nwas going for a little while like this and then we are going to work. And I point out this\nthing that happened to me in the ghetto. In the beginning we had a cow and horse and\nwhen the ghetto start, there was a sign right away. Everything you possess you have to\ngive it away. Of course, we had a horse andI had __I have the . I left them.\nWhen I went when I left, when we were running away. The were still\nthere and I thought maybe ten or fifteen . There came a family from the ghetto.\nThey run away from friends. They used to get it was not kosher, whatever. It was\nthe -- they took the took the Germans you going to cook them and eat them. I said\nI didn't know what to do with the __. They took the horse. We had to give the horse.\nMy father hide it in the place where the horse was staying, and a couple weeks these\nloudspeakers come and everything you possess and everything you have from the living\nthing, even a chicken, even a fork, everything that alive you were not allowed to have.\nMy father had to give the horse to the Germans. We get shot if they catch us with it. One\nnight I go with my father and there was a lot of places where 24 they had, farmer people\nused to come rest, and then there was a few places like this. There was a police there, I\nremember, when we had to take the police over there and there was German, the ghetto\nand everybody had cows and animal and things. I will tell you about a cow. They left a\nfew cows in the ghetto for the milking. My father had to give up the horse. It was such a\nkind horse. He used to eat from the your hand. He was like a dog really, not a horse. The\nhorse was so frightened that he start kick and had kicked up the German he almost kill\nhim. He almost knocked down the German. He grabbed the gun against the horse, you\nknow, and he grabbed the gun against my father and, did you tell him to do this? And my\nfather said, I can talk to the horse. He touched the horse and looked him in the mouth and\nhe said, this is a good horse. We ask to use it. Of course, they took it away and kick my\nfather as a thank you and kick him away because my father was going to . It was\non our street. This was the horse and when the ghetto start, they leave a few cows in the\nghetto for the . This was supposed to be. They were nice in the beginning. Then\none of the Jews -- the police came to our house and said you are going to feed the cow.\nWe take the cow from the house, from this house, 25 whatever -- was in the cows was\nstanding, pull the cows out, not to far to the ; I went to the cow and he\nrun away and I was so hurt. I felt the cow was -- I was laying down underneath the cow\nwhen a Partisan who looked at the cow and saw the milk is getting bigger, and he looked\nunderneath the cow and maybe thought I was going to drink or something, and it was a\nlittle angry, the Partisan. The was not too far away and he shoot at me. The cow\ngot scared and the cow jumped away, kicked me. I started running into the ghetto and I\nwas chasing the cow, and the cow run until I grabbed the cow and pulled her and back\nput it back where the cow belonged. It was the the first few days. It was then,\nwhen the ghetto was going. On I went a few times to work. You also go to work and then\nthey block the ghetto altogether, and they -- and they made a big action. And this is the\nthing, that thing make this was a small ghetto from a big ghetto, and they -- I\nthink they, before they got liquidated we had experience with what they are doing. I will\ntell you about this too, then I will tell you about the action. When they liquidated they\ntook most of the people from the small ghetto and taking them to the Nitenfort(ph) taking\nthem to the Nitenfort(ph), but before they did it 26 there was a hospital in this small\nghetto. It was run by Jewish doctor and all kind of people that were capable to run a\nhospital. It was a regular hospital before. When our house was not too far away from the\ngates where they make, and then across the street there was a another ghetto and you can\nsee in the back of our house a few blocks away, not in blocks. There was a then.\nOver there was you can see they built a study for Jewish learning and farther away from\nthe hospital I -- like I say, our house was not so tall but the house in front was four or five\nstories. They closed up the small ghetto altogether. The military and the soldiers and the\nGermans and the Partisans were there. When I went up in the roof -- I was young when\nwe were living -- there was a little window to look out. I saw what was going on. They\nwere kicking people and punching them around and putting them in the sections. And\nwhen I say from far away, I saw them coming around the fire, and two or five wagons\naround the building, and then the Germans. And they put a store on the building. They\ntake the kerosene and gasoline and they put this building on fire, and they are jumping,\nlive people. I'm sure four, five hundred people in the building, maybe more. When they\nbring down the hospital, they were laughing. 27 I could see. I was not far away. When\npeople try to run to the window, they were shooting them. They were falling like a bag,\nlike nothing. We saw this was going on and this was the small hospital. That's the way\nthey liquidated the hospital. Then the big action came from the big ghetto and then, of\ncourse, they run around with the loudspeakers. And this time was already the ghetto\norganized. It was the Jew Police. In fact, my uncle -- he was not a plain person but he\nlooked like a bit, looked German. Here a room for you, going to watch this street. You\ncan watch the street. It should be quiet. People shouldn't stay in groups and talk. He was a\nquiet man, but thanks to him this life too, in concentration camp. But the way it\nlooked like because of him we went on the good side and my aunt went to the other side.\nAnd when they make the big action, they came out with loudspeakers and start saying\neverybody have to meet in this certain place. It was an empty place in the ghetto. They\nstage things like this. It was empty, where people used to play football. This was thought\nnothing but there was no . There was woods and cemetery not too far away, and\nthey put all the people, everybody young and old and not sick, everybody have to be\nthere. And they took out from 28 their houses, carry them out from the beds and, of\ncourse, they came back to the houses looked like the people were. There was thousand\nand thousand of people and they make a selection and they make people -- panicking\npeople. Can't take nothing with you. When people get lost from each other, you can hear\nthem saying mama, papa , you know, the Jewish name. There was a panic and this\nwas early in the morning. It was maybe five o'clock in the morning the day before. It was\nnot light outside. You have to go to this truck. We came to this place where it was\nstanding, couple trucks for the Germans and the Partisans, and there was the Germans\nstanding with the little stick. And everybody have to got to face him, and you right, left,\nright, left, and the Jewish Police have to take the group, 30 or 40 people, up to this man.\nThere was a few of them and it looked like my uncle, and he run over to us, because he\nwas this time a little room for us and he said follow me, beginning with me, and\nsomehow he thought maybe he could make a move or something. The Germans\nsaid we should go to the right side or the left side, I don't know, but we followed my\nuncle and we went to the right side. We saw the people go to the left. They are treating\nthem more awful then they are 29 treating us. On the right side we saw -- it was looser,\nthe ghetto, more and the left was closer the other side. And he separate into thousand and\nthousand of people, and they open up the gates and put the people back in the clean\nghetto, back where they burned the hospital. It was still there and they moved them in\nthere. And it was deep in the night and everything starts falling to quiet, and they came to\nthe right side and they said you can go if you have the houses where you live. Go back to\nyour homes and we are still in the ghetto and they was pulling on the people in the left\nside, and stopping the soldiers, the Partisans. And like I say, the Lithuanians\nwere maybe with the Germans and they put them in the other side, and we went\nback. Of course, in the panic and we missing -- my father is not here with my mother, and\nmy father and my brother were lucky this time and we were pulled back to our home.\nAnd like I say, we are not too far away from the smaller ghetto and other people going to\nhouses here. The whole night screaming and panicking and so like in the morning, they\nopened up in the morning and they put them all in the line and put them in the Nitenfort.\nThere was house, I don't know the number, but it was, you couldn't see from one end to\nthe 30 other, there was so many people. This was small babies and they did\neverything. This was a big action, they call it. It was big the action.",
        "Q: Did you know where they were going?",
        "A: We knew because, because we knew earlier because they killed our grandfather the\nNitenfort and you were going out to work and this faction -- so telling us what happened\nto us. I didn't see good people. There was maybe a few. I didn't see a good German where\nI was, but I won't go into it, and they took these people and start them marching them to\nthe Nitenfort, and we were still remaining in the ghetto. This was our luck, and in the\nmorning the ghetto was completely empty, the small ghetto, and we could hear in the\nnight the machine guns and the shooting, because the Nitenfort was not really far away\nfrom the ghetto. It was just really a couple kilometer up the hill. And sometimes playing,\nsometimes there I didn't know what was going to happen there, and you could see from\nthe Nitenfort and see Slobodka. It was not so far away. And we could hear the shooting\ngoing on and the killing and, of course, nobody came back from there. And sometime we\nknew what was going on even before they are taking people in the Germany and the\nAustria and marching them between the two lines, two ghettos. 31 They were killing\nthem over there too, and where were we going. We knew already. This night you don't\ntell people that they are going be killed. You couldn't make any move. If anybody move,\nyour would lose you're life. And now I was walking down, and I liked to carve. Now, I\nwas walking down, but I always like too carve and make airplanes and things like this.\nOne day in the ghetto time, I was already working on the airport and we were digging\nditches and doing some other thing. They had a lot of prisoners. The Russians treat them\nterrible. Germans, they so do the prisoners was to uS was you were\nJews. It was coming to us. That was the way they thought. But even to the Russian\nmilitary they lost a little bit of faith, are we going to be alive. It was going on and when\nditches -- going back to the ghetto -- I was not going to work. I was sitting outside and I\nwas carving a little airplane and all of a sudden the Germans came in. They were free to\ngo in their Jeeps and the Germans stopped. Four Germans walked to me and said to me\nwhat are you doing there? I am playing. I am making myself a toy. How do you\nknow to make an airplane? You know, to me and I spoke, I think little and I spoke\nGerman in a way too because it was similar, so I told him I always 32 like to play. Do\nyou have more knives? And I said, no, I have this one. No, I have this knife. And he said,\nyou go to the Jeep, and I said, I want to tell my mother. And he kicked me and put me in\nthe Jeep and I thought they were going to kill me, kill me. Downtown in the there\nisa school. People used to learn there. This was the headquarters for the\nGermans they put me in a basement and said to me, we aren't going to do nothing to you.\nWe want you to make airplanes for us. I didn't know what they wanted from me. I said,\ncan you tell my parents? One of them okay, I'll tell them. My mother and father\nthought I was dead. Because my mother and father thought I was dead. They took me out\nand -- this was going on all the time. I was there maybe a couple of days. I don't know\nwhether it was night or day because it was dark there, but it was light inside. And they\nbring me all kinds of tools and I made toys. I made a butterfly and an airplane and they\nkeep on saying, keep on doing, keep on doing. I was a couple days and they took from\neverybody. I had a imagination and I always like to look at the airplanes, and when I was\nyounger I dreamed of becoming pilot. Can you imagine me a pilot? But I had a dream.\nWho knows, if the war wouldn't be there 33 or something. And I was doing these\nairplanes for them and I took maybe four or five models. They gave me soft wood.\nI never worked with this. I tried to get out here and I even so I was doing. A few\ndays went by and they came and said, oh, come on, you know, in German. I think they\ngoing to shoot me or something. They take me back to the same German that picked me\nup and, you know, drop me off at the gate and said go, go. They opened up the\ngate and it was also the Jewish Police guard, and what happened to you? They took me\nthere and I was making the airplanes. I went in by foot not too far away from the grates\nwhere you go in into main gates to go in when you get out from the ghetto. Of\ncourse, my mother and my father was working there and they thought I was dead. And\nthen life still was going the same system like it was and the next day I had to go to work.\nWhen there in the ghetto a certain time, not all the time in the ghetto, and then all of\nsudden somebody came to the building. Back of the building had to be open. Didn't have\nto be closed anymore. Now, the place where we were living, the house was a lot of sacks.\nMy father had the horses there. It was a big area and we wait for the ghetto, to wait for\nthe ghetto. To come there was a beautiful wood and the 34 trees and this area, it was like\na place that you can unload some wood and coals there was not room. We did this for a\nlittle while. There was a garden. We cleaned up the garden made enough place\nto put in the roots, and they brought the horses, and they came from the street and they\nwas killing them in the sacks. This was the meat for us to eat in the ghetto.",
        "Q: They were killing horses to give to people to eat the food?",
        "A: The horses were wounded from the war, but also not enough. They used to\nbring them there, not far away from our horses.",
        "Q: You used to stay in this sack?",
        "A: Call it a sack.",
        "Q: A sack?",
        "A: A place where you have like a garage. It was not a garage. There was four of them like\nthis and they used to bring the horses there, and they would bring the people from the\nghetto and kill the horses and slaughter them and put them in the other place and cut it\napart and give it to the -- there was meat and some of the horses I'm sure were sick. Some\nof those horses couldn't even make it. They brought them in the ghetto and give it to the\nJewish people, and here's. Do what you want with it. But one day we 35 hear a knock on\nthe door. It was early in the morning they came in with the Jewish Police and a German.\nYou're family is chosen to be, to go to work. You are going to be in the ghetto and we are\ngoing to send you to the . They call it in a place where the castle is, and we\nthought they were going -- can take nothing with us. Whatever we had possessions. Of\ncourse, we had some stuff in there, in the ghetto that was going on. We had a farming\ncoat and we used to go by the wire and they would come back on business, and I didn't\nwant to keep it. Before I left the ghetto -- 1t was before the action -- and I remember my\nfather got a coat for my mother. It was a beautiful coat like a mink coat, and they walked\nover to the gates and there were the dying people and she said, what can I get for it? I\nhave a kilo of butter and things like this, and over the gate and the Partisans were\nguarding us. They looked away and they were making stuff like business, and take\neverything away that they could. And I remember my father was quarter pound\nof butter or meat for the coat. And other people sold beautiful things. A dead cat, you\nknow. You know, what was in the bag. A lot of people making dogs, or something\none put in a poison. The things that were coming over, you don't know what 36\nyou got in this. My father was lucky. He got a piece of meat because maybe it was\npoisoned and we tested. We needed it. We tested and it was butter. And then they took\nus. Like I say, we came back. I don't want to skip this little story the way they are treating\nus there.",
        "Q: Before you go to the castle, I'm just going to ask you a couple of questions before you get\nto the castle. What were you doing for food?",
        "A: We were given food, bringing into the ghetto. There was a certain place you could go in\nand pick it up. There was not food, but everybody made a little garden and some people\nused to go to work and bring food in the ghetto. It was going on like a business.",
        "Q: As a child did you feel hungry all the time?",
        "A: In fact, my mother had a piece of bread and I said to my mother I was hungry, but my\nbrother was hungry and I said, can I have a piece of bread, and she didn't keep it for\nherself. She keep it for us and I said to my brother, and she said my brother was hungry\nand gave me a little piece and she didn't take it. We were always hungry. And then they\ntook us from the ghetto out from our house.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Now, let's go back and talk about you as a boy in the ghetto. Let's talk about food. Were\nyou hungry a lot?",
        "A: We were hungry all the time. There was not much to eat and like I said, they gave away\nall other possessions that they had. They go to the gates and for food -- and but in\nthe ghetto someone was going out to work who somehow, some people were making was\nmake like a black market. Some of other people from taking out whatever they can for us.\nSome food in the ghetto was not enough, but it was not . When I was in the\nghetto, when I was in the ghetto for a long time right after the big action I didn't have too\nmuch. When I was in the ghetto, I couldn't remember the month, three quarters of year,\nand they took us to the castle like I say.",
        "Q: What about other children? Did you play with other children?",
        "A: Yes. In the ghetto I had friends, started a stamp collection. I still have some. We had a\nlittle time. Some of them came from other areas. They didn't have a home, have clothes. I\nwas still in my house. I had collections of stamps and some pictures of other guys, and\nacross the street I was living there was a place. This used to be a store like a supermarket\nand it was 38 very wealthy person, and there was a big yard and people used to come in\nthere and people stop in horses and wagons, not cars. We were more on the farm side,\nyou know. We used to stay over there and buy some food and things like this. They had\ntwo sons and we were friends and, in fact, the same age. One was the same age as I am\nand one was my brother's age and my father was and we were going up together.\nThis was before the war. I want to point this out because this was at ghetto and then they\nleft and I will tell you what happened. This was before the children used to come to our\nhouse and my mother used to make for dinner, and the children used to come eat with us\nbecause the reason why, because they had leftovers. The apple, the pear and normal\ncountry food was not this time. They used to come and eat the leftovers and my mother\nsaid we always cooking for them, and in the ghetto they were taken away. I didn't see\nthem. I saw them for a little while in the ghetto. We couldn't go, you know, across the\nstreet and find out where are you. They went somewhere else to work. I saw them right\nbefore the action. After the big action, I didn't see them. I didn't see the whole family. I\ndidn't know what happened to them. They were either taken -- I will tell you, we met his\n39 father in the concentration camp. We didn't know what happened to them. Houses\nwere taken away from people. There was people were sleeping there. There was no store\nanymore but this was in the ghetto time and I didn't know what happened to them until\nwe came in the concentration camp until -- I remember them?",
        "Q: Do you remember the games people children play. I know you had your stamps.",
        "A: People children used to play -- jumping on one foot and making -- I was already bigger\nby this time and the ghetto was around 12 to 13 years and -- you don't jump on one foot --\nand Hitler was not in this because we were looking for survival, and he asked me if I was\nafraid for my life. There was not a day I was not afraid for my life. I came back to the and\nbeginning. Like I mentioned in the beginning, in our house came a family from France,\nand they were eating the rabbits. But there was a boy. He was very intelligent, young\nman, my age, and they are burning our place and we were leaving. Like I say they\nburning some wood for the ghetto to bring, you know, to burn for the, for the office and\nthings like this. They also used to bring boxes from the military for wood for kindling\nlighting. In the boxes they had a lot of screws and nails and things like this, and this boy\nwas also 40 going to work. It was Sunday and I didn't go to work and this boy said, I\nhave a trick to make and, I said, fine. He said, let's take two of the bulbs and take two\nscrews put them together and put inside some and you see it will like explode.\nThis was in the ghetto time. We are going back to the ghetto. He also handy and he told\nme -- I was doing it and I took it, the knot and put a screw in one side, a metal screw and\nfilled up the knot with heavy powder and filled 1t with powder put another screw in the\nother side, and took a rope from side and tied it up and swung it and knocked it against\nthe wall. And in our backyard -- and there was in our backyard was a building for bricks,\nyou know, for the , you know, where you put the garbage cans and cans with\nemptying. We had just drop it in and sort it out. It was made out of brick. When I was\nswinging this string with this wire knot it exploded, but it gave such a shot that\nwe were not too far away from the gate and from the and the Germans were\nguarding. And like I say, they were on the other side and from nowheres we get such a\nshot and the smoke came out and I didn't know what happened to me. And there was\ncompletely exploded and the knot was going, and I see the wire in my hand, and it took\nme three 41 seconds, five seconds, ten seconds. Missiles were coming from out of the\nother side from the ghetto, and they cut the wire and came in right away from the army. I\ndon't know where they came and they surrounded the whole area and said who shot? And\nwhat happened, this piece of wire, this piece of metal fly so far and hit one the soldiers in\nthe helmet. And I didn't know what happened. And they said who shot all they\ncame in to our place where we were living and took everybody out the houses. And those\npeople are going to work some. Took my mother my father, everybody, who shot? And I\nwas the one who did it. And I spoke German and I was getting better in German. I was\ngetting better, got used the to the , you know, it seemed like the Jews were getting\nclose to German. I had to, when this shot was going, to kill us and I raised my hand and I\nsaid, I did it with this little French boy and somehow, you know, I spoke to him\nand one the Germans said -- and they were also Partisans there -- and they took us and\nput us with this man, and was almost big, big, man for the German and said,\nwhere is the gun? We said, we don't have a gun he said -- we are praying -- he\nsaid, how are you doing it? I had to demonstrate and, of course, when he saw what I'm\ngoing 42 to demonstrate, and he told the whole 50 or 60 soldiers and rifles, and one of\nthem with the knife out and sent them back out to go on. And there are new soldiers and I\nhave to demonstrate, and it didn't work I tried to bang it and bang it and, the German\nsaid, I'm going to show you. And he took it in the hand and knocked it and\nalmost knocked it off his hand and burned him. He had gloves and he said, I see how you\ndid it. He was really embarrassed to things like this. He didn't realize it was going to\nexplode but this guy from France, I know his father told them, I don't know how\nhe came in to idea and, of course, he realized that this was no or whatever, then\nrealized, and he felt a little bit bad and knocked it with a stone and made with a stone.\nAnd it made him a little bit more guilty, and somehow he could kill us like nothing and\nonly flying and you know, he had the power. He didn't have the chance\nof playing in the ghetto. This was my play and I didn't have much time to play because\nwe had to go to work.",
        "Q: What were you doing?",
        "A: I worked in the airport. They were putting in some stones and loading and unloading\ntrucks for the Germans, and some of them were load it out and put it 43 in the airplanes\nand . There was an airplane, you know, it was a big it up and I was\nworking. They gave us also -- you always to do something in the ghetto. I was there. I\nused to -- people made gardens and they used to take us to pull out the carrots and potatos\nand dig it up and plant a little around. Some backyards had a lot and belong not to the\npeople, but belong to the people in the committee, and they used to give it out to the\npeople. This was my work.",
        "Q: Were there other young boys your age? You were about 13?",
        "A: My brother was there and my brother was also involved same like me, but he was\nsomehow going more to work like I did. I used to go three times a week and he had to go\nfive times a week. He was a little older, and sometimes my father said go and he can stay.\nYou didn't have a choice what to do. But somehow I stayed behind in the ghetto. I had to\ndo something. I had to go to the and things like this. My brother was older by this\ntime and he got so survived.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the Jewish Police?",
        "A: I didn't see because when I was in the ghetto was in the beginning, you know. Some of\nthem is good 44 people. Everywhere some of them was showing a good face for the\nGermans and Lithuanian soldiers and pushing around and kicking around. Some of them\nhave to do it and some of them, you know, were nice. And so long as they have\nsomething to do. I didn't see too much bad from the police because like I say, I was at the\nend of it. Some of them were bad. I remember from the concentration camp, a couple, but\nthere was also the Germans, Jewish men, and who was not but I didn't have too\nmuch connection with the Jewish Police.",
        "Q: Your family knew Dr. Elkus(ph).",
        "A: My father knew him from in the army and Lithuanian and had he knew Dr. Elkuis\npersonally, and maybe he got is or something. He was a very famous\ndoctor, and in the camps he was doing something for my father. He operated on his foot.",
        "Q: Do you remember him from the ghetto or not?",
        "A: I remember Dr. Elkus -- he was a big man, he was doing his job. He was\norganizing people to go to work and things like this. He was on the committee as much as\nI can remember, but my father remembered him from the young years when we were\nfree. Then of course, when in the concentration camp with him.",
        "Q: Was there any schooling at all? Was there anybody 45 teaching?",
        "A: Yes. They called , you know, there was schools in the ghetto where they were\nteaching not just for our benefit but for their benefit. There was electrician school and\nthere was a school for mechanical things.",
        "Q: The Germans set it up?",
        "A: In the ghetto the Jews set it up and the Germans support it, but I didn't have a chance to\ngo to this place because I was deported to the this other place. The castle they call this.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you were deported to this castle?",
        "A: It was in the beginning of summer, like I say, in May or April like this.",
        "Q: In '41, no? It was '42. Like I say, I was half wartime in the castle then. I was in the ghetto,\nbut I came to the ghetto a few times. I will tell you this time. After I was in the ghetto I\nwas in the castle -- of course, they took us. I want to come back to this. They took us out\nfrom the house they brought us like a jail that was there, the was the name of itt,\nthe . | don't know what it was. There were people they are not being\nnice in the ghetto. 46 Some people have a little whiskey or something, or some of the\nGermans put them in for punishment. And this was in the ghetto. They put us in maybe\nwith about ten families and they get from other places and they put us in, stay here. We\nthought they were going to kill us. We asked the Jewish Police what are they going to do\nwith us? We couldn't take nothing for our house, nothing. He came in and he said, look, I\nam going to work. I will . We are going to the . My father knew the area.\nThere was a castle. There was a castle. This was from the president or the king of\nLithuania, and they took us there. We have to go by foot. It was about 15 or some\nkilometer. We were marching there. We didn't know where we were going. They came\nin. They walked out from the ghetto. We saw the ghetto farther and father away. We are\ngoing with guard of course. It was maybe a 100 families and there was young people.\nThere was not too many girls. Most of them were boys and the girls, of course, were also\nin the ghetto. But I saw girls before the war but but was girls -- but I was not --\ndidn't see too many girls in the area where I was. And they took us by foot to this castle\nand we came there, and there was a box built, a little house like. It was before they\nlooked 47 before, and we sat. And there was wires around. It was like a ghetto\nbut it was a little ten blocks. It was a place and there was a purpose for water outside, and\nthere was not too much. And there was what I call a garage, like a sack and there was a\nplace to keep the food and there was no place to play football there. It was very together.\nAnd a little farther you look out from the other side, you could see the . It was\nthe castle and not too far away, and you go in this one and you go in this one. Luckily, it\nwas still my father and my mother and my brother. We were lucky there. It was lucky\nI would say I was the lucky one to be with the family together, in this particular\narea and they took us the right next day and a was the man in charge and I\nremember he had this family too. I forgot his wife and in this group was only one small\nchild. They hide it in the ghetto and -- I don't know how they brought him in, hiding in a\nbox or something -- made him to come in. This little boy was around five years old.\nThere was no way for five year old to survive. But in the ghetto was a few people before\nthey made the they called us. They take all the children on the force and they had\nsome small children in the ghetto, hiding and things like this, and in this 48 castle\nthere was most of the people were my age, a little older, who, of course, the people like\nmy mother and my father. And there was a families. Not families, a few. There were\nsome families, lost their family already in the big action. I was really -- not all the people\n-- I was really this family was holding together. The rest was already torn apart.\nAnd they made us to go to work there. We go there and I was working in the castle and\nthere , and we making the rooms, rooms making ride around with horse\nand build a school and put in . We were always doing this type of work, but there\nwas a German almost it was a big man. A little bit less . He was the man\nin charge to make sure the people should go to work. That was his duty. But this man\nalso had barber used to cut the hair for the soldiers. He was he was was\nnot he was cutting the hair for the soldiers and then he and he choose me\nto take this like this. I should make sure and I be the first one back, and soap to\nbe clean and I was back, make sure everybody got a soap to be clean or this get a\nand I was in charge, like to give out the . In a way I was very obeying\norders. What did you want me to do? He was like a 49 German, like any German. But we\ndidn't feel the presence because we were away from the ghetto. I to do this and I was to\ntake other work. I was walking over to . He was a sculptor and he was make a\nface for Hitler and I have to assist him, but before I came to this in this camp and in this\ncastle, I was doing, I was doing all kind of work. And my mother was going out with the\nwomens to cut woods. They are cutting go down trees. The men were doing and a little\nbit other works, cement and things like this. In there in this castle they were building it so\nfast. They could do things overnight. They building a school and brought the -- this\nbrought in over there for Hitler to -- they brought in from France the a lot of\npeople young people my age, and we were a little bit younger, and little bit older. The\nolder boys were going to gentile they had to have duty. They learn to be a soldier too.\nThey have the right to have a rifle. There was a little called him. He was kind and\nhe was guarding me sometime and guarding everybody, but one day I saw him. I was\ngoing out with my mother this time in the field to cut the trees, and this time I was going\nto cut the tree and this was -- before I was telling you, I was telling you about the\nand he went -- my 50 mother was not pulling the saw so fast, and he took a stick and he\nbeat my mother. And I was not far away and I was running to him but other people were\nholding me. Father was not there and they were holding me back not to go, and hit my\nmother. And I remember this and this one was on duty. He was two days with the rifle\nand two days, I was working there in this castle for bring water, was water was\nthere is not water. You had to go to the water and bring it to the kitchen for the soldiers. I\nwas walking and I overhear you look like you're handy. You're going to help me\nout there. I was not there three months and there was a sculptor and he was making a face\nfor Hitler, and I was talking to him he was a because I was going on what's going\non\u2019? But everybody -- there was not one person in the German Army. Biggest one, he was\nvery intelligent man and he made a face of Hitler, this the sculptor and I was supplying\nhim with the clay, making the clay make forms. When day when I remember this boy was\nhitting on my mother and beating up my mother, and this was area in the area and\nsometimes we had to go out and fill up a bucket of water, and I say one day he\ncame in for duty and he was on the second floor -- no top floor -- where he was putting a\nsculptor 51 and he said to me go down -- in German -- bring me some\nwater and they show this fresh water coming in well. There was a kitchen\ndownstair and there was a smaller building, and there was a cook and there was a bunch\nof prostitutes, and there was and they were working for the Germans. And they\nwere having a good time with the soldier and this was all going on over there. When I go\ndown, he told me to go down with the bottle and I took the bottle with me and I\nand he bring the bottle over to -- and nobody's there. And he is downstairs 1n the kitchen\nthere and I took the bottle and opened up the nozzle and washed the bottle nice. I didn't\nknow if the German was watching me or not. I filled up the bottle and I closed it up and I\nclose it up and I taste it. I was thirsty and honestly, I was dropping it. I was afraid to spill\nit on the ground. I was dripping a little in my mouth and I felt a push and, you know, and\nmy mouth went right in the nozzle. And I opened my eyes and I see this beat up\nmy mother. He didn't have a rifle. He took a stick and was trying to make like the horse\ngoing faster -- I don't know how you say it in English -- the took the and he start\nwhipping me, you know, because when he pushed me I fell. I went up against him. I\nthought it cut 52 my throat, whatever. He took this stick and he was smashing me and\nbeating me up, and the girls, don't hit him, girls from the beat him, give him and\neveryone on his side, of course, and I had been very thirsty and, you know, the bottle I\nhad for the and he standing on the bucket -- and I don't know. He beat me so fast I\ncouldn't take it. I pulled the rope and I kicked him. When I kicked him -- and this was the\nbasement and he fall. He lost his grip and he fell in the basement. And soon as I did this,\nof course -- he was also a soldier. He run out. All the girls and a couple soldiers right\naway, and one of the them put a rifle. And they were German too. A little drunk and\nhaving a good time with the girls. They were going to shoot me. They were going to\nshoot me. It was a miracle at the time this was going on, one of Germans said, you know\nwhat you do? You pushed a German. And they were going to shoot me. There was no\nway to survive but he looked like -- he told me later -- there it is not to too far\naway and he said to them in German, what is going on here? And I told him. I was\nbleeding from my mouth a little bit and I told him I was cleaning the bottle and he said,\ndon't tell me. I saw everything. He saw what was going on. He saw that I didn't\ndrink from this 53 bottle. He said, I saw. I was laying down and dripping it from the\nbottle dry, in into my mouth and, of course, he was such a big man. All of them were --\nwith the revolver to my head, he was afraid to say a word against him. , you\nknow, let the boy go. He was walking with me and it's not his fault, it's his fault, he\nstarted up with him. That's what he said. I took the bottle and went up with him, and I\ntook the bottle and went up with him and he told me if I needed -- he didn't give me any\nwater. Are you okay? I okay. I felt like I should say, but I didn't. There was water like I\ntake for the clay, not for me to drink because there was no glass. I . There was\nwater that I used for the clay. It was clear water from the well for the clay -- and take\nanother clean water. No drinking water but this was clean water from the well. We had\nother water also but it was not drinking, for drinking. But I think I remember I took a\nlittle bit to the water and washed my face and then I walked with him over there for a\nlittle while, and then he was deported, you know, they took him away somewhere. To go\nI was walking again and with these people and they walk in the woods, and they\nsaw this whole thing until this was going on. But in same time I was going out my 54\ntooth was hurting me, and the men said to me in the ghetto, they have a tooth doctor, A\ndentis, you know, they had in the ghetto they had everything. They said we have to go\nbring some food for the camp. We are going to take you and your father this time and we\nwill take you to the dentist and see what they can do. He was a nice man. I went with my\nfather and we are there in the area and we came into the ghetto. I went -- I came into the\nghetto. They didn't let us in the ghetto. But the gates not too far away, wagon with a little\ntruck which belonged to the German and good for they -- and this camp and this was for\nthis one and there wasn't and we had to load it on. I wanted to go to the dentist,\nyou know, but somehow the police, they said to my father, don't go in the ghetto because\nthere is going to be a . There is going to be a selection and taking out all the\nchildren. Because when they closed up the gates nobody can go in the ghetto, nobody can\ncome out of the ghetto and the policeman told us we supposed to go out to the castle but\nwe couldn't go out. But luckily, I don't know, somehow it must have been the telephone\nand things like this, they delayed us for about an hour. And all of sudden they came and\nthey the trucks were full and they made the selection. 55 They went in every house over\nthere and they went deep in the ghetto, and I was right by the gates. I was on the other\nside of the gates, not where I was in the beginning. They were making the selection\nalready. Already they killed people. They -- whatever they could grab. They grabbed the\ngirl and raped her and they cry. Of course, I didn't see it but other people told us, and I\nknow from other people what was going on. And luckily, they had to let us out of the\ngate because they needed food for this place. He was driving the horse and you couldn't\ngoing by German. He was in camp where I was there and we went out and was the\nare you going on the selection in the ghetto. We came back to this. We were not\ntoo far from home. It was about a half hour, hour, not too far away from this place, and\nwe came home and told them what was going on. Selection again. Only for children.\nThey took children, older people, whatever. They couldn't -- they cleared it up. But the\nnext day this I got a note from, you know, the telephone call. The German on the\ntelephone. They are going to check it out in our camp too. There was maybe me, my\nbrother and a few other boys, but then and there was a little boy five years old, and\nthis five-year-old boy had a brother my age. So 56 like I say, and the mother was there.\nThe whole family was like sticking together. This this man that was in charge,\nhe came out. He said, look, I know you have a small son. There you just make\nyourself tall. I remember. I was a tall boy and I would survive. I will tell them you were\nimportant. He has a job he was doing. The -- he had a list of what they are doing. They\ncame in a Jeep, a military car, but Gestapo, the SS, everybody, had to take the barracks.\nThe little boy was in the same barrack where -- he was sleeping. They took the little boy\nand put him on the like they used to do this too. And a German officer or\nsomebody from the army or the ghetto, he looked at. He walked in and look at the little\nstick and I stood up straight and said you know, look, muscles, like a dog, you\nknow. Then I said , you know, small children here. The little one opened up his\nmouth and said to him -- I never forget this -- he said to him, no, there is no small\nchildren. All the children are sleeping, sleeping but he was looked like a German.\nI'm sure but somehow they in German but somehow made him so he said,\nyou know, to the little one, he didn't do nothing to him. And they walked out and\nfor now they did nothing. We thought 57 already this a miracle happening, but I think it\nwas in it was the next day or the same day came out a car with different\nGermans. They arrested the little boy and the man -- you take out a rifle to him big, little\nfor the camp, on the in and the mouth, where is the little boy? He couldn't run out\nof the place and he couldn't run out from the place. There was all the soldiers. They\npulled away this little boy from the -- and the Germans inthe __, like adog. I'm\ntalking about my horse. And like an animal and this little, mommy, mommy. You could\nsee it. You see sometimes in the films. I saw it with my own eyes. She passed out, the\nmother because the father was at work, you know ready to go, ready to go. I\nthink it was the money. They took him away and that's it. This was the experience 1n this\ncamp. We were walking there. There are so many stories to tell about this. It was not\n. | was beaten up a little bit too. And then the time came and we found out the\nRussians are coming closer to the area. You have to be liquidated. And they said to us,\nthis work will stop. And I have a story. Was going there with the time for this.\nWe stop this walk. Now, we said -- now, we're going to take you back to the ghetto and\nthis is going to be no more job for you. 58 We got to the ghetto. That's it. They going to\nkill us. It was a few days. They gave us a warning. We didn't have possessions. Just\nclothes, a few things, nothing to take with us. And they said I don't know where\n-- the German in charge look, I don't know. Where we going? We go to the ghetto. We\nare going like lambs. We couldn't fight because everybody was against you. If you go out\nto the line, they shoot you. If you go out to ask help for a little, they give you out. You\nhave to go like a lamb. There was no way to give resistance and they took us back like\nfoot, and the same way we came there and it was, of course, a year later they took us.",
        "Q: You were in the castle for a year you think?",
        "A: I was -- would say it was close to a year. I was in the ghetto until the big action.",
        "Q: How was the health of your mother and your father?",
        "A: Luckily, it was not so bad. Of course, we had aches and pains. Who cares? You know,\nyou want to survive. You couldn't complain. Now I complain all the time, sometimes to\nthe doctor, but you couldn't do this. But at this time my father was younger than me than\nI am now. In the 40 and 50, like this. Somehow he was -- he wanted to be alive, to\nsurvive. You gets along even if you have some health. You talk yourself 59 into this that\nit don't hurt.",
        "Q: What sort of food did you have in this castle?",
        "A: Not bad, because we were we organized food. The woman could cook a little bit in\nthis barracks. It was not bad. It was like the same way in the ghetto. But we had enough\nfood. I remember before I go farther -- I am stopping all the time. I remember there was a\ntime when they found a man wandering outside. They stopped him and they put him in\nthe camp where we are. They pull down the pant and he is circumcised. We got a Jew.\nThey beat him up to death. They beat him so he couldn't talk. He was a little bit crazy,\nand they called in and said they are going to kill him. All of is sudden a Kapo came\nthis was their son. He was not Jewish. They came to the German and had pictures\ntoo. They had a they show it was not a Jew. It was not Jew because this is how\nthey treat us, you know. He was a little bit mentally. He run away from the house. They\ntold him he was circumcised because he was sick or something. And they almost killed\nhim but ambulance came to take him out. This was the way. No respect for the Jews.\nAnyway, going back they tell us we have to leave -- ?",
        "Q: Let me ask you another question: How did you 60 sleep?",
        "A: In this particular place there was old mattress, smelling and things like that. A little boy\nwas hiding under. The mattress was straw. We had a roof. We went through the cold\nweather and it was really not comfortable, to say it was livable, but we managed\nit.",
        "Q: Did you have nightmares?",
        "A: Always get scared to see what was going on, everyone there, people were dying. In our\ncamp sometimes they couldn't make it or beaten up. It 1s not so paradise 1n this place\neither, but still was better than in the concentration camp, and we had nightmares. I still\nhave nightmares. I still remember things. Sometimes I watch a movie and I think I am\nliving there. This is -- I saw Schindler's List. It's nothing. It's much worser. I didn't see a\ngood German. I will tell you a little farther if I have the time. They put us -- and have to\ngo back to the ghetto -- and they march us back to the ghetto. And like I said, it was on\nthe left side of the -- and the ghetto was on the right and the gates were now moved\naround. Not the wire. It was original, but they moved it closer to move to the exit like\nyou go to it was right in a fork. We are going there 61 and praying to\nGod not to go to the left side, because the left side going to Nitenfort. Then they move us\nto start to go to the right and they move to the right, and certain three, four lines away\nfrom the front and I said to my mother get in the back because, you know, you\nfind out you are going to the right side, and then we walk in the ghetto. Soon as we get in\nthe ghetto we are nowhere right away. The police, the Kapos said you have to go\nto the right. In here and stay there. Don't move until you get orders. We don't know where\nto go, what to do, but my father had two, cousins in the ghetto and we didn't know. We\ncame back. We were sitting there, waiting for order and all of sudden I think was\nmaybe the police. He 1s of not policeman. He said you met my father and he said\nwhere are you? I'm staying in the barrack. You want to go. Maybe you should come to\nus. You want to go to them. We didn't know what to do. they have coming in and\nsurrounding the ghetto with machine guns. The whole army was there with loudspeakers.\nPeople are going to be liquidated to Germany for work it was most of them\nworking for.",
        "Q: They're announcing this?",
        "A: Yes. In the ghetto on loudspeakers, and it was 62 panicking. You see sometimes the\nmoving is chaos, but luckily, my father met his brother and said we should go over there.\nWe went over to the house where he was. A barrack, maybe 500 men living in one block.\nBut we couldn't get in. Of course, it was occupied. We were sitting outside the whole\nnight, holding together my mother, father, brother, and my aunt came outside and\neverybody should get out from the houses.",
        "Q: Is this because the bombs were coming?",
        "A: No, no bombs. It was like chaos. The people were hiding and running like it was a raid,\nan air raid. It was a raid for the Germans, and anything was trying to escape from the\nghettos, he shoot them right on the spot. They surrounded. The whole army was there.\nThey put and said, this, this, this, move the people. Let's go. Set up in a line and you're\ngoing. They took them on a ride. My mother, my father, my brother was in one side and\nmy uncle was on the other, and they took us from the ghetto and they took us to the place\nwhere the people are working, to the airport. But they didn't take us to the airport. They\nwas taking you can see it on the map if you have a map of this. They took us\ndown to the train and the trains -- we were walking maybe half a day, andthe \u2014_\u2014_\u2014swere\nlaughing, spitting on us, having a good 63 time. We didn't know where we are going. We\ndidn't believe them. We didn't go to the fork. We are going downtown, you know. It was\na little bit, but we saw the dead constant. We saw dead people. It 1s not simple what I am\nsaying. People are falling like flies. They are shooting people, people who can't work.\nThey take pistol out and shooting people came to work like dogs. We coming into this\ntrain station there. There was wagons like you have in the museum in Washington, full of\nstenching, stinking, you know, from the cow and they said one, two, three, four, five, in\nhere. And my father all together in here and somehow we managed, me, my father and\nmy mother. We went and my uncle and this family all in the same wagon?",
        "Q: Your brother too?",
        "A: My brother too. Of course, my two cousins cause one was dead already in the ghetto and\nbrother and about another 50 people. And we were sitting there a day. We didn't know\nwhat was going to be. It was hot outside like this time of the year, and then all of a\nsudden they said and came and closed up. They closed us up right away, like a cow. We\ncouldn't go out and there was wires on the little window and they announced the train\nstart moving, you know, like toot, 64 toot, start moving. It was going to take us to\nDanzig. We didn't know where we were going really and we didn't have any food,\nanything in this train this time. Absolutely nothing. And we were going a whole day and\npeople have to go and piss water and stool and there was nowhere to go, and there was a\nbucket and how much 50 people in a bucket? And some people were a little embarrassed,\nwomen and men, but in this time you didn't see these things. This was when you have to\ndo these things, trying to the little window to pull out the side and the Germans\nwere sitting on the roof and knocking them down banging over the head. And I remember\nwe were going and going and all of sudden the train stop, and there was a bucket of food,\nlike for the people, you know. I don't remember. It was like in a paper, a piece of bread.\nPeople were trying to grab and it one of the guys was there and said, wait a second. We\nall in the same boat. Let's try to be humanized, not like animals.",
        "Q: What said this?",
        "A: Another -- my father said, no. There was a man and my father said to him some who have\nthese whatever food was there and we was going traveling like this maybe three\ndays. And we saw to the front the wagon the city, 1s going to and places. 65\nPeople are leaving and and we go to the station where the train is, has to go to a\nstation sometimes stopping because they have to give it right of way to other trains. And\nthere was a life going on. Normal people are dressed and, you know, laughing, reading\nnewspaper and outside, and we were going to die. Of course, and then we came closer to\nthe German part and we came to Germany. We didn't know where we were going. We are\ngoing back and forth. And then all of sudden my cousin was -- one of the cars wanted to\njump to the train and get a ride, but somehow the wagon got caught, a little cut in the\nmiddle of night. He got open the top and trying to crawl and he have succeeded right on\nthe roofs. He could not escape from the train either. We are going and all of a sudden\nDanzig. We saw a sign the train stopped in Stutthof, and said to us we go\nout and we couldn't breathe anymore, and the urine and the stool and we didn't make it,\nbut we didn't make in, not in our pant. And we made it on the floor. It was full with the\ncows. It was a disaster. I think maybe another day we be choked on the fumes. They stop\nthe train and he said men men separate and fathers separate, and then, of\ncourse, they took away. I said bye to my mother and my aunt and all this, and 66 we had\na piece of bread and I gave to my mother, I remember and Reds came and\nbut some were a little younger because some came from the ghetto and they was\nmixed up. And in the ghetto there was a few youngsters my age. They went with the\nmother. Instead of I went with my father and my brother. I stayed with the men side, but\nit didn't take too long soon. They took out the was left more room with, because\nthey took out. They didn't put in new people. We saw people with the stripes. Already\nwas during the war, taking the people in the camp and we waved before the door closed\nup and waved to my mother and that's it. The train started blowing the whistle and going\nwith a run away full speed, we going again, maybe a day or two days. And there was a\nstop again and they give us water to drink and they put a bucket and one glass, I think,\nand there was a glass, a can they give us. Drink whatever and we came in the Dachau.\nWe saw to this camp, overheard. People knew about already about Dachau and things\nlike this. We came into Dachau and instead of no this one is. We shouldn't stay\nhere on this train. This is train is going to Landsberg, not to Dachau and this train is\ngoing this way. And then we going backwards, you know, they put another -- they going\nto the machine to 67 pull us out. We are in the camp, they pull us out and we are going\nback. And this would take maybe about three or four hour, and we came in away from\nDachau and came in a place and they and we walked out. We don't see nothing.\nAn empty spot. This was Landsberg blocks made out of cardboard you see like the tins,\nlike paper and right away they start kicking you. So the people, you know, with the\nnot the Jews, but they had Jewish stars with a '\"V\" like up sideway\nGermans also some of them and they were it -- and it almost people,\nyou know. Whatever they called them. You know, it was all kind of people there.\nMurderers. They put them in this place. The guy, the guy he was already a Meister over\nus the Kapo and they are doing the whole thing and some who have them\nthey put us right away kicking and kicking, and they take us to a big build and they said,\nyou are going to be unclothed and to clean us up. We don't know what is happening and\nhere I am holding with my brother and father and things like this. They coming in\nDachau hundreds of people. A whole big thing going on and we have to walk\nover to this building and stay alive. You are going to get a shower and a uniform, and\neverything you possesses if somebody has something from the 68 ghetto, whatever it is.\nThere was a new German at a table and give it to them. You have to be completely\nundressed when you go into the shower. We knew. We heard about the stories of the\ncrematorium and this, but somehow we didn't feel this a working camp and the guys said,\ndon't worry. You are going to work and you people was and they put us in over\nthere and everything. One was undressed and some of them had some ring hiding,\nwhatever, something, whatever they brought from ghetto. They all together.\nThere was 5,000 people in this camp and maybe there 1s a couple thousand people. They\ncall a transport in the train and they came from other places and put everything over\nthere. We have to undress and we have to go into in this . We have to wait but we\ndon't know. We don't see people coming out. There was another exit and we saw people\ncoming out dressed already. So we had a feeling this was -- so we go in and everybody\nwas undressed and Jewish people and men. There was there before us not just Jewish\npeople no. They had some spray. You started to spray you under the arm, on the\npart, the men part, over the hair. They try spray it right in your eye. They was laughing.\nThis was already a working camp. There was the . Anyway, they put us in the\nshowers. A 69 whole building sort of this. There was water coming out. It was ice cold.\nThis was terrible. People passed out, and then it was a little bit warm and we went\nthrough this one. And there was uniforms waiting on the other side and look. And they\nsaid, look, ____ some for them was too short. Everybody get a uniform. I got a uniform. I\nwas lost in it and this man said give me this one and I switched with him. There was no\nshirt or nothing. Just a uniform with stripes and little hat. They kicked us, of course, and\nthere were German people working there. And they put us 1n a line and said one, two,\nthree, four, you go in this part. And one, two, three, four, and number one 1s -- it\ntwo and somehow I stick with my, with my uncle. I don't know what's happen today. My\ncousin, he's disappeared I was holding onto my father and we falling. In the\nbeginning in one barrack and come back there was nothing for the dig. There was\ncardboard made. It was a digged out on the inside and there was made from cardboard\nand nothing. The was still warm, but you were making the box yourself and the\nbox then the next we have to stay there and we were sleeping there. There was a\nlittle, little bit straw under the bed. Lay down and no pillows or nothing. This was where\nwe sleep. This 70 was with the working camp. This was the building. Camp was built by\nthis time that we came in, and we stay overnight and sometime before we came to the\nbarracks -- I skipped something. I have to go back. They said to the people, where are\nyour possessions? All of the people before they go into the shower, they have had a ditch\nout like a toilet and you sit over this and behind, and they make the and you can\nsee it was falling. There was people before. There was a ditch there where people before.\nIt was a long ditch I would say around five or six hundred foot long. And when they\ncame out and said -- a lot of people, you know, saving diamond ring or some money,\nwhatever they had from the ghetto, throw it in the ditch to give to the Germans.\nSomehow they give to the Germans. Somehow they had work for it and they came out\nand they said they'd like to have all the doctors, the lawyers. I have special work for them\nand we have a lot of intelligent people there. My father was going but I can't. I'm too\nyoung, but my father didn't want to raise his hand to say he was not a doctor, but Jewish\npeople are a lot of intelligent people. But before the people, they tell them before they\ntold the people that had the uniform before they went to the back, undress I'm going to\ngive special 71 work for you. You are going to go inside and take out with your hand\nwhatever you find this. You have to take out the wastes from the people with their hand.\nAnd there was maybe a two foot or one foot and the fumes and the heat, and it was\ndrying from the sun. It was smelly in this area. You couldn't get -- you could get far\naway. People going in, half of them didn't go out. And they fall in. They pull them out,\ndead. And they fall in. We thought we never survive this. They came out smelling, you\nknow, the people that came out that survived. Of course, they didn't let them in. They\ntook I didn't see because they said one of them, this is the work that you Jews\nare going to get. For us this was intelligent. This is what you have to do. You have no\nright to be a doctor or a lawyer or whatever it was. Of course, I was not in the ditch. I\nstayed in the back, and in the morning we hear a whistle and there was a place to\ngo out and they said to us, make groups we are going to work in . It's about four or\nfive kilometers from this area. And at the same time you are going to make a building\nbarracks for us, you know, to give us a paradise. We going to be in heaven and they took\nthe group and this time I was lucky and stay with my father and brother and stay in the\nsame 72 line. There was a -- there was a man Bergman(ph) he was also from the ghetto.\nHe was a Kapo. He was nice to me. He was already with our group but he was an\nintelligent person and these in the was a leader in the Gestapo and he raised his\nhand. He spoke fluent German. You are going to be in charge and make group and make\nthe groups together and to tell for the people. And we had a number. This number is\ngoing with this one, and we are going to this field to work. It was an empty field. There\nwas nothing there. It was completely flat. We going to start from scratch and tell us what\nto do. And everybody have to take is a shovel and start digging. We are organized\nalready before us and there were some spots already built. And this was the work we are\ngoing to do and we work the whole day. And we didn't know what we are doing. And\nthey come with machinery and bulldozers, bulldozers and building up a mountain and we\ncouldn't understand why they building a mountain. There was fog in this area, and for a\nwhile you could see and they build a mountain and they have a plan what to do. They\ngoing to make a bunker. How you going to make a bunker from a mountain? They make\nit maybe to be two-mile long and quarter wide and this was our job there. Our job to put\nin with the 73 sand and bring it in and coming with bulldozers we create a\nmountain.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: You were describing this bunker, this mountain?",
        "A: Right. They are building up, of course, coming in with big train and filling 1t up and\nsoften up and build. You go up the mountain and then when this was done, they put like a\nlittle layer of grass and put in sticks, metal sticks. All that was maybe a mile was metal\nthat was maybe two or three foot long, all over. You couldn't pass by and then in the\nmachinery on each side of the mountain of the and start putting in cement and\nthere was machinery coming in with for other camp. And we had to stay with\nand build all this, like stages, like steps and push away the gate then run down.\nThey started from the and they made the gates from wood and, of course, they\ndoing this and filled up the hill and made the other up and build up and they\nbuild up maybe four or five foot ditch, and they cover up the whole mountain with\ncement. And then they came with the machinery and start digging up and move away the\nfarther away and start digging in two or three foot. It was very deep. You could\nsee down. It was 74 like the 15-floor deep in the floor and they started filling up with\ncement again. They made it I would say, the size of this room. I would say about 40 foot\nthick, thick cement all around, fully up to the hill of the mountain. And when they are\ndoing it they made a downstair and made like corridors, and you could walk in the\ncement and they came with bulldozer. Later on they come bury the whole thing in the\nground and from the outside stick out just the mountain and all this cement was built up\nso heavy. They put layers of grass and then when you looked at this, it look like a\nmountain, like a normal hill. Only sometimes we are were doing this type of work and we\nhad the Jewish -- this was really like we have the Jewish system -- it was really the time\npeople used to fall in the cement and never came out. And I think hundreds of people\nburied. Almost I fall 1n there but I was lucky this time again and wasn't working there.\nAnd my father was falling a lot because the work was so hard and stinking in the night\ntime, and from the cement and the powder and the water, and I can't even explain, and it\nwas going on. I can't even explain the way it was working. It is like you see a factory\nwith machines and not stopping, and it was going on and people dying. The guards would\nsay, give an 75 example, a hundred people from my group. Two is missing all the time.\nEvery day was dead people there. And there was the work we are doing there and when\nwe had the mountain down. And this and they came to start from the beginning and came\nwith machinery and dig out the inside and made another empty stadium answer inside,\nlike you see the dome where they play the football. That's the way it looked inside from\nthe ground. But before this was going on there was work I had to do. It was work we\nhave to going on constant until the end of liberation. It was not completely\nfinished. I am giving the picture of the way this is building it, and I was working with my\nfather there at this time. And there was a German that was in charge of our group, but\nsomehow I was away, say I was lucky. I was never lazy. It just like the way I was, work.\nBut I was watching him. He wasn't watching me. It was survival and my brother not so\nwatchful, always get a little and all this. But in the time we were working there,\nwe been through a lot of experiences. But to start with the experience that I will begin\nwith is we were working there one day. I was going out to work and there was a\nI men, already a Jewish man. He was putting together the groups. There was a\nman, a 76 German, came out and said, who speaks good German? I didn't speak so well\nGerman but I figure I raise my hand. You speak German? I got a job for you. He said I\nshould take this briefcase and come in there, and you going to have a job. You\ngoing to be the fire. You going to put fire in the ovens for the soldiers. They had maybe\n15 little boxes and had three or four soldiers which can go inside and warm up the hands.\nWe work also in the wintertime there. But doing this I felt a little bit free. I could go and\nafter bringing coals for the -- when I left my father and brother working on this bunker\nthat they were working. And one day my father came and they almost killed me. The\nsame German that was nice, my father told -- he told my father, he told me to leave the\njob. Nothing like this. Anyway, there was my father he was beaten up because I have left\nthe place. It was not his fault. It was not my fault. I lucky to get a better job. In this job I\nwas doing I was constantly going out and getting fire for the soldiers, putting in fire for\nthe ovens for the soldiers are and just by doing this I had a little bit there was\nsoldiers all around the area, and nobody was in back of -- he says I use today. Go and\ntake a bag and fill up the bag with coal and go back 77 with the coal. And meanwhile, I\npass by the place they were building the bunker and without a guard, and by doing this I\nwas putting the fire in the ovens. There was a lot of Germans used to peeling potatos, of\napple or something, and used to go into my pocket. But I didn't have the heart to eat it,\nand I used to always feel like I have a duty to give the food to my father and my brother\nbecause I had it much easier than they did. And this was going on for quite a while. I was\ndoing this type of work, but in the time this experience I had one day a German came to\nme come we me. Take my briefcase case and come with me. You come with me.\nThey took me out and I was going maybe for a mile, and this time the war was coming\nclose. Airplanes were coming to bomb Germany and this was the time of -- it was still a\nlong time for me. I thought it would never end. But really the Americans were getting\ninvolved already and bombing Berlin. And this German, I was walking with him and all\nof a sudden these two airplanes, these MIGS, it was two MIGS, MIGS or something,\nAmericans. They came so low because it was so empty at the -- came down with\nmachine, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta and on me and this German. And he was a big German and I don't\nknow, he had a big -- he was not maybe they had so many 78 titles but I don't\nknow. He was a big man too, and he was going to mail something. He thought maybe I\nwas going to -- I was going around and said to put the coals. Now, you go with me and he\nsaid to go with him. I go with him and take this briefcase when the airplanes came on us,\nthere was no way. There was a little tree far away, but this was nothing. They were\nbuilding -- they are building for to land for airplanes in the bunker. And then he said to\nme, stay still. And he just took his hat and the airplane go by and he took off his hat, and\ntook off his hat. He throw this on the ground and lay on his back and head to the side.\nAnd I thought he was dead. He's dead. I really thought he was dead. But he was not dead,\nbut then the airplane passed by. He said he talked to me to stay straight. You\nshouldn't move. You can look up if you want to see the airplane. He was so smart, but\nairplanes came down again and they saw him laying down and they raised up and stopped\nshooting. They raised up and they disappeared. Then I stand up and I am smarter than\nthem. He noticed it was . He could be dead. He was lucky that he didn't get a\nbullet. If he would be dead, I would not be alive either. This was one was experience.\nHowever, I will tell another experience. I was 79 walking around with another German\nsoldier and he was from the Wehrmacht, and he walked over to me one day. You thought\nI look like his brother. He was blonde with blue eyes, beautiful young man. I see\nnice man. He was a good looking man and I looked up at him. And he was so uniform --\nhe was not in SS. he was from the Wehrmacht, from the soldier, and then ghetto. I look\nlike his brother and he was on duty and he was guiding the people. They were walking\nand every group had a soldier to watch them, and everyone had a Meister soldier to\nwatch them and there was a Meister, the people that give you the orders to every day. I\nhave duty. I will give you a leave it and you pick it up, and this can't be a\nGerman. Was a good person, a good man but this was one was going on for a while and\nthen one day raid and this time we were walking there, and it was also full of the\nbunker they are building. A little farther away was like wood and one of us was going to\nthe truck and it was muddy and you go in muck. And I sat in this area I looked for my\nfather all the time and my brother. And every time I had something in my pocket and\nbring it to them and they were working in this area, and so bring it to them because they\nwere working in this area. The guard was standing farther away a 80 few other\nwith work other sections. Block number five, six, seven, eight and there were\nanother blocks to make. There was were a few other to make ten, nine, whatever and\nthere more barracks on the other side. Then I happened to be there in that area and all of a\nsudden the the raid was there and everybody had to lay. This good German was\nwith this group. I saw him before. I didn't talk to him so often. I looked like his brother.\nHe gave me a he told me a little bit, about the story, where he came, and I didn't\nknow he was from Germany. He was from or something. He told me a little bit\nabout his family. He don't know where his family is. He complained a little bit and this\nwas the raid. And everybody had to lay down and throw everything down and be still.\nThe airplanes were coming down. They was going down to look like bomb. Knew\nnothing, we were not too far away from Munich. This was not bombing. They was going\nto Berlin. Everybody lay down. There was a Jewish group, most of them were Jewish. I\nwas not in this group but I have to lay down at this, if I am and this German was a good\nGerman. And there was a few other soldiers and this good German, and a few other\nsoldiers standing there. And he was not sitting down on the ground. He was 81 standing\nnicely and leaning against a tree and the airplanes making noises, and all of a sudden the\nnoises stop and noises and then, all of stop. You have to wait, not to move until the noise\ncomes back. Then because the raid is over, when they pass by they can make you are\neven signals at a couple miles away. And they start working again. And then raid\nwas going on one. Men felt uncomfortable maybe going to 50 foot from one end to the\nother, start calling to go on the other side. My good friend took out a pistol and shot him\nright in the head and his head blow off. He had a bullet, and everybody gets\nfrightened. And I remember I was a little farther away from me but the blood was all\nover, and there was a drop of blood on me, a mark, my stomach. Oh, my God, I am going\nto be alive. It was a nice German and all of a sudden. The raid it is over and\neverybody stand up to go back to the place they work. I didn't see him the second day\nlater. I was supposed to come again because it was maybe going on for a month or\nsomething. Everything time there a piece of bread, whatever, cheese. The next day I was\nafraid to go over and pick it up, but I felt I was not I was a young fellow. I didn't have\nhad no, couldn't say. I was an intelligent person, so many schools and years, 82 but I\nlearned to be a human being before the war start. Wait a second. If I am not going to go\nto him he might shoot me or whatever, might shoot. And I had the going on -- he was\nnever there. When I put the wood and some of the __ said if I met him, you\nknow, I play dumb. Why? Should I? You, this swine is this pig. You know, he could kill\nus. All because of him we be bumped from the Americans two mile in the air. There were\nyou put up aluminium foil against raid. And anyway, I lost me a couple days but he was\nI was going a couple days and -- army we used to keep the solders not too often.\nThere was a couple and they was going and then this from there. Then I had the\nexperience they used to come in the camp and they putting the woman to works in the\narea and in our camp. They want the woman for the other camp and they were working\nthe kitchens there and cleaning for the soldiers and also working other places. The older\nlady with no hair look like boy and uniforms, and they used to make get a shower. Once\nin a while they build a nice -- 1t was a barrack but it was better than the first one. And\nthey had a little corridor and they were so even in a working camp. They put in\nthe people in the shower and most of them then we were all men and some men had a 83\ndesire, and they put a woman undressed, completely naked and she would going and\nmaneuver the water to make the water, to turn on the water. And there I was afraid. I was\nalive but some people were still 1n the -- men have a desire for a woman. You could see\nin the part, and have a desire and they would come in with a raincoat and came in with a\nstick and right, smacking the people on the part, and it was painful and some of them\ndied. Some of them pulled them out dead. Until they found out this the Jewish\nman was the leader. Some of them not coming to work they kill about 155 people that I\nremember. They thought this was none.",
        "Q: Did you see this?",
        "A: I saw it. I was there. Took a man and German man walked over and knocked him right\nover the part and passed out. And some of them, you know, come back to the bleeding\nagain, and some of this -- then they start playing around with the water, hot water, cold\nwater, and hot water, that this working camp. And it is a distinct -- and I had another\nexperience. In the same camp was mixed. They brought other people to work there,\nJewish people too, not too many and there came a -- police came from the I\ndon't know exactly. He was from Hungary or something. He came 84 in later and he\nsomehow had brought in a cross, you know, and people were sleeping. Before this\nbarrack was made out of wood, dig out a ditch, like this side come down like this, and\nwas ground and put the -- we didn't have straw. Didn't have a pillow and gave us a\nblanket to wrap up, blanket with straw, and this was our pillows. And this police was, of\ncourse -- a mahogany cross -- and it was this size with Jewish and fancy with a chain, and\nhe used to tell me story from the bible and he was a very learned person. We talked about\nthe Jewish religion Jewish and Christian religion. Somehow at this time we are suffering,\nwe all recall it was no different. I think, I think, the make is different but we all\nthe same people. And then he said to me and this barrack this man that was involved with\nthe for the work. He said that we should work three shifts. We should work eight\nhours and constantly working over there, day or night and sometimes in the day shift and\nsometimes in the middle shift, and sometimes I was in the night shift and the work after\nthe job, and one -- 1t was a Sunday this time -- and I came from the night shift, come in\nthe day shift, you know, to switch around. And I was another time I used to go away he\nsaid to me always, he called me Israel will you put this 85 away? And I dug out\nwith my hand a little hole and I keep this tied together and put it in a little straw\nuntil -- it was my -- I didn't care. Respect was having. Didn't bother me. He was with us\nmaybe a month or two months. They were switching around people from the barracks.\nMy brother and father was there too in the barrack, and then they took my father to a\ndifferent barrack and then they try to switch around barracks, together but the\npriest used to hide. It was a Sunday. I came from the day shift to start working for night\nand from day shift and we had to switch around shifts, but anyway, he put on the cross\nand there used to be a gentile people and make a mess for the gentile people and he was\ngoing to the -- he was going to the I said the ditch but we never -- it was snowing\noutside. It was like cold. We were there. It was raining and wet snow and it was really\nsnowing, and we walked out with this. I could hear scream and halt, halt, halt, because he\nwas close, but I didn't -- stop, stop, stop. Anyway, we heard scream and we hear shooting\nand, of course, there was a little window to look out and we keep going to the ditch to the\nwindow. There was this priest and the Germans and the soldiers around the camp, and\nthere was the like they were 86 watching like in a prison and they told him to\nstop, stop. And going out for the soldiers they could go in the camp for a second. There\nwere doors. They could open form them. For us they couldn't. And they walked in and he\nsaid he said, he made a noise. It was so quiet this time. It was snowing and they\ndropped him and they put him right away from the rifle and took him in the headquarters.\nMaybe a half hour later they brought him back to the camp and they said to the -- and\nbrought up a chair and which is go outside to put him in the chair. And it was\nsnowing and cold outside and some of them came from work. I just came from work. I\nwas wet and tired. Even I did my work not so bad but come back from working to the\nbarracks you get wet, you don't get an umbrella. Everybody had to go out and everybody\nhave to go out. There was people in this camp and one of the Germans put a chair and\nstand on the chair. I'm going to show you what Gods can do for you, and put the priest in\nthe chair. And everybody had to go by and spit on him and then one of the Germans took\nthis, this cross, opened up his mouth and turned it around and keeps -- everybody,\neveryone to go one turn. I made second turn. The man was already half dead and the first\ntime I went by, \"Hi\" to me 87 because I was think it was a miracle. I didn't know the\nGermans were so how come? They took the cross in his mouth and put it in his\nmouth and even bleeding to death, you know, and then one, the Germans there was what\nis going to happen to you? You believe in this God? You Jews are nothing. We are not\npeople at all. Every -- there was not too many and we -- this, this what you can expect.\nAnd we saw this and a lot of Jews coming from their shift and still working and we had a\nfeeling we would never survive. They do it even not to Jewish people. This is an\nexperience I had. I had another experience my brother, rest in peace. I was going with the\ncoals and they choose my brother to take the canister and go to the kitchen to bring the\nsoup for the group that were working. And there was a tall man. He was a tall man. My\nbrother was compared to the men, he was not so tall. We would not survive if we were\nlittle bit. He was shorter than the other guy and this guy was maybe 6'2\" and my brother\nwas 5'8\" and lucky because this was survival, because we were not too little. And he\nwent out to get the soup for the men to eat, and it was snowing and the weather was damp\nand wet and there was tracks going in from the trains where they were working. I -- it's\nhard to make a picture, what was going on. 88 Unbelievable things. Barracks with\nmachine and all kind of machinery was standing there, and you had to go to a factory.\nThere was building with a big thing, and my brother went to the kitchen like it and I was\nthere walking around, not too far away, because there was the oven, the wood to put in\nthe for soldiers, because they were guarding them, and I saw my brother going. I was\nhappy he got -- at least he have an easier job then. I was working hard too. The coals\nwere so heavy I thought I'd die. I couldn't pick it up sometimes. I was afraid not enough\ncoals, afraid not enough coal, and a few times the Germans said there was what you are\ntaking and smack a kick and all this stuff. They were not so gentle to me. I got beat up\nmore than one time. I took it, with somebody on your back all the time. And my brother\nwalked over to the -- not to too far away from the place that have to bring the soup. It\nwas a canister and it was wintertime and it was snowing. It was wet and this can slided,\nand he was short and it slide right on him, and the can kicked him over. And he fall down\nand this on up the gate and this soup spill on the ground. This the this German\nand my father was not run over to me, got this metal. This pipe, it was maybe about six,\nseven foot long and they gave it 89 right on my brother on the back one time. The second\ntime he turned away, only he collapsed. He was laying there and they said you it\nwas not his fault. He stepped in the truck rail from the truck and he fall down. And of\ncourse, I was there and the people and they run over to him, and I drop my sack of coals\nand my father, father said my brother's dead, he's dead. I feel bad about him\nbecause I was lucky. And he comes up, blood from the mouth, and we thought he was\ndying. He finished. But he survive and my father try to pick him up. And these Germans,\nwhat are you doing? Here, I said. I am taking the coal and this my father and brother. But\nthere was other German, so it's okay. They made another group to pick up the soup\nbecause there was enough -- not soup. It was water, and my father and I couldn't stay\nthere, and I see my brother start talking and I see he was going to be okay. And they\nwiping off the blood and he made it. And he had to make believe he was walking, and\nthey came back, go back to the camp. I wasn't going back to the camp, of course. I went\nin the barrack so I couldn't -- we didn't know what happened to him. This Dr. there\ntime was physician for the camp, and my father was -- I was mentioning that he had a\ncyst on his foot, and 90 he operated on him. And it was in the camp, sort of like a\nfirst aid, but I want to -- my brother was not anymore him. He was really weak but he had\nto fight and somehow he was going to come to -- it's going to come to a head. We saw the\nairplanes and the whole thing going on and we felt make we have a chance. Who knows\u2019?\nThis was going on for quite a while but when I was walking, making the coals, I was\nsomething to tell. You have to hear this. There was a wagon, a train standing outside with\n-- the guards were there. As and German came in again from the other camp, you\nknow, and he was a big man. He was a he all of sudden came. We found out he\ncame from Auschwitz and he was going to be in charge of soldiers, not over us. And he\ncame in and said he didn't make the this Bergman moved around, you know.\nAnd who is this, explained him over the face and the men from the also German a\nlittle higher from him came out, and there was a fight and beat up this Jew, he work for\nme. Anyway, they settle with each other and this German and the to make the fire.\nIt got his own no soldiers there. I came in one time to make the fire on the stove\ndid I know who he was? Stillin \u2018if I have with -- he told me if I was in\nAuschwitz, you wouldn't 91 be alive. And he start doing what he did in Auschwitz. He\ntold me the way they was burning the people. He was not it took. Mentioning one\ntime and show it to me and they put the people in there and put them on fire and he had a\nsatisfaction. And one was working, not a murderer. You could see on his face. Maybe he\nwas wounded or something in Auschwitz and the Auschwitz looked like it was\nliquidated. It was before they put him in our camp and when I was -- I was to make warm\nfor him. One time he said I should take his plate and 1t wash out and cook him some\nsoup. it was like a soup the soldiers had. I go outside. There was a train. I took\nthis sand and wiped it out in this bucket. I made it look like a mirror and I came back.\nAnd he said, how come this so clean? I said -- I told him the way I did it. I took the sand\nand washed it out. I put the soup in. He told me what to do. Put in a cup of water\nand I did what he said and I start putting fire in his -- he and we start cooking. Putting the\nfire in this oven and we start cooking. We start cooking it has to boil. Where is your can?\nI had a can always on to my -- I had a spoon. He said to me, take a little bit first. I should\neat of -- its hot. First eat and I almost burned my tongue and 92 I took it in the mouth and\nhe said know it's safe, like I didn't put in any poison or something. Meanwhile, I\nbought maybe three or four pots of the soup and he didn't want me to be there when he\nwas eating. And I came out and later on I came in washed the thing and I didn't see him. I\ntake off my little hat that I had and that's when any time I used to go to the bath\nand take off my jacket. When I had my uniform and put it by the ovenandifIhada |\nthey would die. But one day a man got crazy. Also from the camp and he worked in this\ntrain and started crying about -- the toot, toot, toot and one German soldiers asked, where\nyou going? He was going to Budapest. He was from -- he was going to Budapest and see\nhis wife and child. And somehow he went into him the soldiers were the big they\nhave rapport with him that everything was going on, and he try to escape and he was in\ncharge, the guard. Then the soldiers walked in and I was not there, and he looked like he\nand I was in there and he came out and to me I should go to back.\nMaybe he got something against. He think I did something wrong. There was a big kettle\npot twice as big as this table, heavy. Fill with water effort. There was a pump where the\ntrain, and where the train is filled up with 93 the water. I could hardly take it up. He said\nto me you I don't want to say you dirty dog. Take the kettle and put it on\nthe fire, and he force me to sit close and blow it. I took off my shirt so the water would\ncook fast. Realized the man outside. That I -- for a second I didn't know what they -- and\nI hear this man in the train. I thought he worked there. I didn't know he was crazy. The\nwater was boiling, really cooking. He said I should take it off from the oven. He pushed\nme away and strong like a lion and put took some rags and he took some rags there, was\nputting the boot and took the water and put it on the ground and he said to me if\nyou want to help no, I shouldn't help. He strong like a dog and he open the door,\nhold the door open, hold the little door open and he shove the man away about 10 feet,\naway from me, and the man was sitting in the train, toot, toot, toot, screaming. I go to\nBudapest. I realize he was not normal and he took this hot kettle and he walked over to\nhim so polite and said to him my friend, my brother, where were you going? And\nthe man said, I'm going to Budapest and to my family, and I will help you, and put up the\nkettle and raised it up like a helmet and right over the head and the water right over the\nhead and spilt it. The 94 water was still rolling around and he had very little clothes on\nanyway and the clothes came off of him, of his skin and he got red like a fire, and he was\nin pain. He was running. He didn't know where he was running and screaming and\nhave and he was and there was also the was a\nplace where the people get hurt on the job. There was a Jewish doctor, forget his name,\nbut he used to be a and he said he was running there, and he collapsed and\nyou know, he put him in this little and the doctor couldn't do nothing. The doctor\ngot out but when I came back hours later to put in the coals for the doctor also, because\nhe was there and I saw blood on the rail, window and scrape from the nail and the\nfingernails were hanging on the wood. He died from pain. It was what I saw they did to\nthe man. He wanted to go to Budapest.",
        "Q: Israel, we only have a few more minutes. Can you describe liberation? I know you were\non a death march.",
        "A: Right when the camp was going to be liquidated they said we have to go back to Dachau.\nSome people still remain in the camp but people who still capable to go, you know. They\nsaid they going to treat us, to switch us around with Sweden and ___ take. German told\n95 stories. from the into Dachau took maybe but a day, and my brother\nwas very sick already and he was beaten up, and stomach and bleeding from his mouth.\nHe held on and when we came to Dachau -- I had some wooden shoes and I couldn't\nmake it in the snow. My knees start getting numb and we came in the Dachau I saw the\nchimney. Lots people there, thousands of people, trains and all this and some people\nremain like in a race. And we go in the group. We were talking about we stay that\novernight, but we are in the group. We stay overnight and the morning I lay down on the\nthe place and I couldn't see nothing. I said to my father, I can't walk\nanymore. I can't move my knee and my father said to me if you can't walk they're\nare going to shoot you. That's what they are doing to the people. And somehow I fall\nasleep. And my brother was sick and father was also not so from working, you know, and\nhe was a and again, but again there was a raid and the Americans bomb again, a\nraid and the Americans were bombing -- Munich is not far away from Dachau -- and a\nbomb came in right not too far away from the camp and I just jumped. I hear a bang. I\ndidn't know and I stand up I said to my father, I move my knee and then in the morning --\nit was a little bit in the middle 96 night I could move my knee and in the morning they\ntake it, one, two, we have to go. They tell us have to go and some of them they put in\ntrains. There was not enough trains. They made us walk. We walked Dachau and walked\nthree days. They gave us a can of fruit and they gave us there was meat in there\nfrom the camp, and everybody got a can of some of the food and they came out with a\ndog and they had the dogs were going on other side of the group and were\nmatching from Dachau. This was after Dachau it was after liberation and I was\nliving there and the mountains we came out there. The people are dying\nlike flies, like a lot of people weren't making it. If you walk a little out of the line the dog\nwill grab you and bites you. You can't escape. I had wooden shoes, wooden shoes and I\nlost my shoe. I was running barefoot and it was April. I was liberated 2nd of May, one\no'clock. But we were walking down and people were dying like flies. We didn't know.\nWe thought they're going to kill us, and we came anyway. We come into. \u2014_\u2014sm wee are --\none thing after the war when I was there, we had to stop somewhere and there was a little\n. A woman came out, a German woman, with a hot-cooked meal and gave to the\nsoldiers. I to drink. It was 97 experience I have a little time. I was liberated I\ncame back to this place. But anyway going to this place they put us in a ditch. They put\nmachine guns and we know, there 1s finished. They're are going to kill us there. Luckily,\nthere was a raid again and it start snowing. We are there maybe around 2000 people in\nthe city and it was a whole and -- the snow came. The snow was so heavy we couldn't\nsee. We were snowed in. In the morning I came out from the snow and I looked. I\ncouldn't see my father. That's my father. I didn't see him. He was there and my brother\nand all of you had -- people start coming up and there was one soldier standing on the\nhill. All the machine guns, everything is going on. He answer. The leader, he\nsaid the Germans are going, and he show a little town a half kilometer, white flags\nhanging over the houses. And we felt something going on. And all thought was burning\nand machine guns and military going. And anyway, there was a dead horse -- but I can\ntell stories. People were so hungry they were eating the dead horse. I didn't eat the dead\nhorse. And we were walking into this little town and the Germans were there in the small\ntown and we walked in. And everybody, you go here, and they go there, here, sort of like\nin the like they have it in the 98 farms, little town. And there was boys in this\nhouse and things like this, and the woman was watching the house and sitting. She offer\nus to -- she don't know -- for us to eat or something. But they were afraid. We were\nafraid. We didn't know what was going on. We, finally, maybe 20 people in this place\nwhere the cows -- around one o'clock we hear people screaming. We go out. I say\nAmerican -- I saw 1s a white star. I didn't know what was Russians or what ever and\npeople running in the in to the place. The Americans are throwing disaster. There\nwas a-- people usedtoeat _\u2014_\u2014. I gota can of and a soldier opened up for me and\nI eat like I didn't have nothing to eat. And then the Americans came in and, of course,\nright away they said to remain where we are. And the next day all the people should get\nout of this place and we go to a place about two kilometers to the barracks where the\nGermans from the Navy and the soldiers. They it out and you'll the people that\nwere liberated put us over there. And in four days we were leaving. They put in the white\nflags. A train go by and it opened up the and the men said it was a rabbi\n, a priest, oh, what did they did to my people? And he felt so bad and he should not\nshoot, but he felt so 99 bad he took the machine gun and shot the first floor -- and look\nwhat they did to my people? I never forget this moment. It always stay with me and that's\nwhy I thank the Americans I am alive, everyone. We went down and this was the end of\nit. I didn't know what was happening. And we walked in this building and, of course,\nright away there were soldiers from the doctor and they start checking out the people and\nsoon my brother, they took him right away from us, and right away from us. She said --\nwe show him the way he acting, and right away he have to go right away in the hospital.",

And then we were liberate and my brother\nwas taken to the hospital, and then they was in the hospital and they tried to cure\nhim but he lost a kidney. And then he had TB in his foot and he couldn't move. And after\nthe liberation there was six years in the hospital. And everybody was already free and I\nwas at this time a young man.

        "A: I would be delighted. My name is Israel Gruzin. I born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, they\nsay 1n a place I born in 1928, December the 28th but now I am putting myself on May the\nAth, and I am going to tell you the story.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I had a brother, of course. I was born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, in Vilajampole. We had a\nnormal life. My father was not a millionaire but he made a nice living. He was doing\nsome business with Russians and things like this, and 1t was binders from boot sales and\nselling this from the houtgarba(ph) to make leather out of it. I was going to school. I was\ngoing, of course, to Cheder, a Hebrew school and my brother the same thing. And we\nwas going on a normal life. Of course, we had the little- the Lithuanians was not always\nwith Jews. There was stories all over the place, but we had a normal life and living like\nnormal people, and then, of course, in 1940 came the Russians because the war started\nalready with the Germans. It was not a war yet, but when the Germans came to Poland --\nbut the Russians came to Lithuania and then the Russians occupied Lithuania close to a\nyear, and then the war started in 1940.",
        "A: It was a little different because you will -- I was going to a, to Hebrew school and then all\nof a sudden I was going to a Jewish school. They are cutting down on the religious part.\nThey were trying to make all the children like sort like patriotic and, of course, when\nyou're young you think is the future. But my father was always against the regime\nbecause of Communism. In fact, he got arrested one time. One time he got a chicken he\nwas carrying this to the street and he was stopped. What do you have a chicken for? And\nhe was afraid to tell everything to go to officially. They arrested him and after a couple\nhours, but they let them out. They didn't want to get the men for the chicken. You can\nimagine my father didn't care much for the Communists. But I was not myself. I liked the\nmovie and things like that. But 1t was really normal. It was a little different with the new\nregime, but I was too young to see the difference.\nAntisemitism?",
        "A: There was because I can experience to start with, because I remember my father bought a\nbicycle for my brother. I was the younger and he was a year older. We were riding one\ntime and I was saying, let me ride, let me ride, and all of sudden there was a few boys,\nnot Jewish, and one of them got a stick and put it right in the springs and he broke the\nbicycle, and like young boys, of course, we chasing them. You broke the bicycle. How\ncome you broke the bicycle? And where I was living in -- we got a little farther out --\nwas a church and we chased them to the church and, of course, course the police came\nout and let the two buys in and he put the foot in this door and he told us, go away you\nZyds. I told them and this time, of course, I spoke. I forgot \u2014Lithuanian, I was going born\nthere-- them I told him he broke the bicycle and he kept saying, go away. Of course, I\ncouldn\u2019t fight him. It was experience. We came back home and my father took this\nbicycle to the man that fixed the bicycle and fixed it. But you had a feeling like you were\nalways not so welcome, like because I'm Jewish.",
        "A: Like I said, I was neighbors with a few of them, but in general I was in the Cheder. But in\nthe area I was living there was Jewish people. But we had a few people from the\na restaurant there. His son was a little friendly with us, and we were playing as\nchildren, but didn't have too many Lithuanian friends.",
        "A: Oh, of course, in 1933 when the Russians came into Poland. Of course, my father was a\nmiddle-aged man and he talked about it with my mother, and he showed the papers a\nlittle bit, in the Jewish papers and the Lithuanian papers what was going on in Poland, the\nliquidations and the killing over there. And it was we started. A lot of Jewish run away\nfrom Poland and come to Lithuania. In fact, when the army, the Polish army, fight the\nGermans they came to Lithuanian because some of them didn't want to stay with the\nGermans. But most of them was happy to have the Germans in Poland.",
        "A: Yes. I couldn't understand a little bit and there was politic involved, and I could hear it\nand feel it, and when I see in the, whatever, I saw in the paper I realized this that we are\nnot welcome. Something is going to come back and my father kept saying what was the\nnext step. He didn't realize that the Germans were going to attack the Russians this time,\nbut when the war started and they start feeling that the Germans are coming. But my\nfather reading the papers and knowing what is going on. It's time to leave everything and\nrun because what is going on in Poland is maybe going to be the same thing here in\nLithuania. And we had a horse and wagon, and I have a lot of stories to tell. We had a\nsmall little horse and we are using it to take the coals from -- it was a little like a pony. It\nwas like a dog. You talk to him like a dog and this horse was doing things that were\nbelievable. And my father had two horses but my father took the smaller horse and the\nwagon and take the few things we can take with us, and we made the journey to run away\nfrom the Lithuania. And the Germans were always bombing the airport, and a lot of Jews\nstart running to get away from the army.",
        "A: This is in 1941. And only the same time these bombs was falling and, of course, the\nLithuanians were so happy to see the Germans coming, they're sabotaging the Russian\nArmy tanks, putting on fire and burning 6 the tire and shooting on them. And all of\nsudden their own rifles and putting on the Lithuania uniform and really taking advantage\nof the situation and start right away with the Jews, of course, but we didn't have enough\n-- it was too fast. We left. They day they started throwing the bombs, my father took the\nhorse and wagon and we was going to get out of there. And we are running the streets\nwith the Russian Army and we were going to Latvia. A lot of people in this area. You can\ngo to Latvia and then to Minsk, and then from Minsk to White Russia, but we didn't make\nthe journey so far. We just took that horse and wagon. We have involved with the\nRussian Army and then, of course, the Germans were bombing the streets and we were\ngoing through the hole. I say the Holocaust, dead people right away from the first time,\nand my mother, in fact, was shot, slit. The bomb cut in her leg we were running in this\nway. We were going in the same direction as the Russian army. There was always fires\nand dead people on the streets and a lot of them couldn't make it. You know, the soldiers\nand a lot of people riding the horses didn't make it. We kept on going and then, of course,\nwe came to the border of Latvia. We came in at Minsk. There was a lot of Latvian people\nthere, but we hear right away from the Gentile people that something going on, terrible\nthings going on against the Jews, even in Minsk. But we were lucky and we were still\ngoing in the car with the Russians, the army. But the army was really practically 99\npercent in a chaos, didn't know what they are doing. One was running right and one was\nrunning left, and then I remember one thing, that we were running, going with the wagon\nand two Jewish guys came over and said you have to give us a ride. My father said, Look,\nI got a little tiny horse. We have four people. We won't make it. They took out a revolver\nand they point it at my father. They said, look, you are going to sit down and we are\ngoing with you. Also because we can\u2019t walk. They might look a little Communist\ninclined, I don't know. Maybe they are soldiers, and then we are running like this. Not\nrunning, driving and driving and driving and then, all of a sudden we had an attack with\nmachine guns and I felt -- I was in the wagon with my mother and my brother and my\nfather was driving the horse and the two men, and then all of a sudden we hear a\nsomething. We hear a scream and one of them says, Oy, Oy. We look and then he laying,\nfall back and a bullet went right in the man part, in this -- right in his, in the part, the men\npart, and it went in this -- excuse the expression -- right in where it aches for the men. He\ncould feel the bullet. He could touch it. The other man said, don't do nothing. Drive\nfaster the horse. Drive the horse, and then we were already in Latvia, and then we\nstopped and they are still with us two days, and then this man stopped some other people\nand, of course, speak fluent Russian and they made us stop for a day, like a half a day and\nthey said we should go closer to the water. And they took him out of the wagon and they\nsaid to us, they thanked us for the ride and giving them the ride and we left them right by\nthe water. And I said, how can you leave them by the water? And he said, I made\narrangements to the other side because the other side of the river, the Russian Army was\na little bit more organized. It could start to fight back. It made like a zone to fight back,\nand we left them there. My father didn't want to leave the man. After all, he didn't know\nhim and now the man is wounded, and they kept on saying -- I was a boy and I could see\nthat it was his part and there was a bullet, and the other man was going to take it out and\nmy father said, don't do it. You'll kill him. And anyway we left him by the edge of the\nwater and we started going farther. We are already -- my father and my brother and my\nmother alone, and my father kept the tallis, you know, the tallis what you 9 wear, and he\nkeep it on the wagon with him, and this he took with him. We are going there and then\nnobody to talk, but luckily my father was fluent in Latvian, is different, similar but\ndifferent. My mother didn't speak Latvia, and I, of course, didn't and my brother didn't.\nThen he hear some from -- somebody told us that we are Jewish. You are one of\nthem. The Germans were not even there yet. We didn't know what was going on. And go\nthere, make a left and a right there. And there was a farm and there was a Jew. Maybe he\ncan give you directions. Anyway, we came over there. He had a farm and two sons and\nall kinds of animals there, chickens and cows and pigs, and all this. And there was a little\ntown and the whole people looked like they like them over there because he was a very\nnice man. And my father said to him, what should we do? And he said, I am in the same\nboat like you are. The war was going on. We didn't know how long it was going to go. So\nstay with us for a while. And we stay for two or three days, and then on the other side of\nthe farm was close to the water, maybe a quarter of a mile. And my father said to him,\nmaybe we could go over to the other side. But we couldn't. He wanted to go over. The\nreason -- I skipped a little bit. The reason we came to this 10 place, he wanted to go to\nLatvia. The Russian go over to Latvia. There was bridge and the Russian Army exploded\nthe bridge because -- then the tanks and the army. Their own people. There was a lot of\nJewish, and on the bridge, we were lucky not to make the time on the bridge. If we were\non the bridge we would be exploded too. Right before our eyes we saw the bridge\ncollapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants,\nreally. With their rifles and they couldn't even walk. They got on the other side. We\nremained on our side and the people on the other side, there was still the army holding\nthe gun. But a couple days on the farm with this man I said to my father, let me see what\nwas going on. And we took the little boat. We really wanted to go over. He said, I can't\ntake anyone right now. I was going in the nighttime. I was not there and my father, said\noh, my God, what is going on there? They are fighting with the Germans and\nand the Jewish and he found out. And they couldn't make it back on the other side, but he\ncame back with this man from the farm. And he came back and said, look, he said, it is\nbad. I am taking my horse and wagon and I am going. He had some people that came to\nhim and said, ride it out from the 11 people. And we are left completely alone, and this\nwas like in evening and I said to my father -- and my father's name was Heim(ph) -- and\nhe shake hands with him. I got my family and you have yours. I have to go my way. I\ncan't take you where I'm going. We go where we can and then, of course, we made the\njourney to go back because we couldn't go to the other side. We were trying to go back\nfrom where we came. That's why I said the little horse was like a dog. We didn't know\nwhere to go and my father said to him, go horse. He didn't know where to go and he was\nafraid to ask for directions, things like this. And luckily like I said in the beginning, my\nfather speaks Latvia, and we starting to move back in one little town and , the small\ntowns. And all of a sudden we hear from the people, the Gentile people, the Germans are\nmoving slowly. And then all of a sudden we see a German truck with soldiers and oh, my\nfather said, we are already under the Germans. We caught from the Germans. We are\ngoing. My father was smart and took that horse and took some mud and smeared up the\nhorse and made the wagon look like farmers and look not like Jewish people, because he\nhide the tallis that he had. We are going there and people are greeting us. People thought\nwe are going from one , from one little 12 town to another little town. We are\ngoing back to where we go back to from there we went to . We saw where\nwe came to before we go with the Russians and we saw the bombs. We didn't\nsee the city. It was really wiped out. It was bombed. We didn't want to go but still some\nbuildings were still remaining there, and then all of a sudden we come in on the highways\nwhere the German Army with this music with this big truck of ___ and tanks. And we\nare five going farther than them. We are going farther and they are going backwards. And\nthey kept on saying in German , things like this. We knew how to speak\nGerman too and, of course, my father knew we are all right. But of course, my father\nknew more, but the Jewish and German is very similar. But in this experience we are\ngoing down to a house, a bag to grab it and saw it on the ground and it exploded. It was\nlike a bomb. They didn't know if we are Jewish or not, but they didn't care. They were\nsoldiers but when we came in to this town -- and we are still in and someone\nfrom the windows up from the top, what are you doing? Someone will recognize us. We\nare not Latvia. There was a Russian man that said to my father, this Russian. It is now six\no'clock. Nobody is allowed to be on the street. Move off to 13 the side because they are\ngoing to destroy you. My father understand stood Russian too and we moved over, right\nwhere we could in the corner, and the night came and wagons and the machine guns and\nthe airplanes and the bomb. And German Army is so powerful, and this was in the\nmorning. We saw people start moving. We saw civilian people also. Then we start going\nagain with our horse. The journey to go back to Lithuania. And my father stopped and\nasked an old lady. Why didn't you have the directions? Are you not from here? And he\nsaid, no, to her. No, we're not from here, and she said oh, my God. Don't tell them that\nyou are Jewish they. Are killing all the Jews and killing all the Jews. It's in this\nlittle town and this little town. And my father, of course, explained to us, he said to us, go\nand don't ask nobody. If you are going to ask a question, where you are going, you will\nnot be. Keep on going. I can give you good directions and you go over the highways.\nAnd we have to go where the army was. Don't ask for directions. My father didn't want to\nask for corrections, and he put in the tallis for good luck and they were driving by us. He\nput in the tallis, you know, for good luck and driving by ourself. And all of sudden we\nsee soldier and already the Partisans 14 and the Latvia people, they put in their uniform\nand they're running and the flowers they got for the Germans, and the womens get all\nkind of and they -- and then Partisans with rifles and knives came over to us, first\nwith bicycle and come off the street because my father was making sort of like, sort of\nlike . You should be too much with the hiding because the army is going there.\nThey stopped us and they said to him, where are you going? to my father, and my father\nsaid to him, oh, I know you. Because he spoke the language and they were drunk, really\ndrunk and bloody, full blood like , you know. My father said to him, I know your\nfather. Do you know? he said. He said, I have a little farm -- they were so drunk\nthey didn't know what was going on. And they asked my father, did you see any Jews?\nJews? I saw so many Jews not too far, half a kilometer. Full of Jews. People with a lot of\nfences, sitting and telling a story. Oh, for this one, let's drink. In Lithuania, oh, this one\nlet's, drink and, you know, opened up a bottle of some vodka. And my father was\ndrinking and said to my brother and myself and to my mother, keep on moving, move,\nmove, and he said keep on moving, to my brother, who was a little older. And my brother\ntook the horse and started moving, and made 15 him to drink. And he drink a little bit. He\nhad to take a sip and he said to them, take them . Keep on moving. Move away\nfrom the wagon we were maybe -- keep it moving so my brother was a little older and he\ntook the horse and he keeps moving. They made him to drink a little bit, a sip, what it\ntook, and he said to them, take them. My father says, keep moving with the wagon. We\nwere maybe two or three foot away from him and then my father start running to him and\nhe said oh, thank God. I get rid of them. Then we keep on going farther and we came into\na little town. It was called -- this was already before we came, we passed the border\nbecause there were no border because the Germans already took over everything. They\nopened up all the borders. It was not Latvia. No one was guiding there. We came into the\nborder there. Of course, we saw what was going on. We was scared. We saw dead people\nright and left, right and left. Jewish people and the Russian people were laying,\nslaughtered like so many pigs. First time I saw dead people and was the first time for me\nand of course, you see dead people more and more and more. We came to a little town\ncalled Milkinmeer(ph). It was not bombed. It was a nice little town. In fact, my uncle\ncame from there. 16 There was . There was a house full. We went riding for --\nlike I say, the horse was and my father didn't want to ask for directions, and we\ncame over there. We looked like farmers. He made it so we didn't, monotonous and tired\nand things like this. We came into this little town and we came to a big house that was\nmaybe four are or five stories, and the Partisans were standing with rifles, and there were\nonly Jews. They put them all in this house and screams and one of them from the\nwindow recognized when we went by, and someone screamed in, you are Jewish\nmove away, move away, and we looked up and , but luckily they didn't stop us.\nWe going farther. It took us another day and a half and two days before we came to the\nSlobodka. Someone was arriving there. This was after the bombs because we came a\nlittle later. It was raining in the streets and it was mostly red, like they killed animals. It\nwas from people. We didn't see too many because they pulled me away. And whatever. It\nwas really -- you could see blood in the streets instead of water. When we came\nwe came to our street. We were leaving. The horse was like a dog. This horse brought us\nby the door. When we leaving there was a house. There was a house, four-story house\nand there 17 was a gate like a door. You opened up and our house was in the back. The\nback was nice. There was a garden. My father was renting. This man was a he\nhad a drug store. He built his house. It was a modern house and we lived in the back of\nthe house, and before he was living on the property, not ours but there was a garden and\ntook kind of some land and build a big house in front of this, in front the street, and we\ncame to this to go into the gates. It was locked up. We couldn't go in. My father tried to\nopen it up. It was locked. The people came to the window and we recognized they were\nneighbors. Why did you come here? You know. My father said I just came from traveling\nback from Latvia. How can you do this? Nobody's on the street. It's empty. Everybody is\ndead. Somebody came down and let us in the gate they close it right up and\nstarted telling us these stories. And all the neighbors, this street and this street. You could\nsee to the window our street. This particular area they didn't make it here, they don't\ncome here. They are still afraid they are going to come here. The house was empty. The\nhouse was still there. Nobody touched the house and of course, we run back to the house\nand the next we stayed overnight in our house. And all of sudden we hear 18\nloudspeakers in this area and the streets were running full with Germans, you know,\nbecause when we came in it was so quiet. And there was loudspeakers and this\nwhere they are making the ___ but my father was, of course, a little see what\nwas going on. See if my mother's brother was there. He run away and escaped. They went\nto Russia. My father was going. I had my grandfather there and he was going to see his\nmother and father but he was still there, safe in the . It was next day they killed all\nthe people in Latvia. You were safe from the it was next door they killed all the\npeople. My grandmother, they hide her under the bed and they didn't find her. It was a\nlittle house, you know, they look and nobody was there. They didn't kill them this time\nbut they get them anyway. They had loudspeakers in the area. We could hear it. It was in\nthe area of the ghetto, but they took from all the Jews, and people start coming in the next\nday. My father go downtown to find out and I go with him. And the horses was so tired\nand couldn't go. We tried to give it a little bit water and it was walking. Was hard. Maybe\ngoing to take the horse and go we drive about ten blocks still Slobodka. We saw the -- we\nsaw the little spitting on the Jew and doing -- all 19 the Germans, already the\nsoldiers. It was not organized yet . All of a sudden we saw this, these uniforms.\nThey are talking, the Gestapo and the Nazi, and so the people start coming from\ndowntown. In our area there was no gates or wire or nothing and my father was driving\nand he wanted to see my grandfather. The problem we wanted to see if the uncle\nwas down in the city we. Drive for several blocks. We look where the used to\nbe. I had no window. They cut off the head from the robber and put it right in the\nwindow, and my father see, and myself too and my brother was going with me too\nbecause my mother was in the house and my father said, I'm not going. Father can see\nwhat was going on and we went back to our home. It was not taking too long. It was\nabout three, four days. All of a sudden the Germans were the army against the Jews. They\npull everybody from all the towns and all over and and they come in with trucks\nand big machines. And they bringing the wires and, you know, they came up with\nloudspeakers, everything, everybody has to go out and help building the gates and the\nwiring. And they went out and told them where to go. They got my brother and my father\nbut not me. Our house was about 500 foot away from the next street 1t was . 20\nThere was the fire. Already it was a street, a main highway. It was like a connection they\nmade. This was a big they made from the other side there was Jews too. They\nmade wires between two streets and they made the bricks over to go where we shouldn't\nbe. We have to build the ghetto ourself and then, of course, they get so organized. They\ncame in with, like I say, the Germans. The Germans alone didn't have a part in the\nbrutality because the and the Poles and the Latvia and have -- everybody was\nhelping the Germans to kill the Jews. Like I saying, they were killing already but\nsomehow we made it through the things. And of course, they putting everybody on the\nwires in this area and then they say five kilometers or ten kilometers and couldn't see on\nthe map. I couldn't decipher it. Then they put in all the people from the sides and put the\ngates, they told us it was going to be a couple weeks before the ghetto was created. But I\nalready had experience in Poland. Look like it. They, right away, they took the young\npeople for work and my uncle, rest in peace, he was one, the first one. And he was taken\nright away from the ghetto, and the second they came in with trucks and wagons and\nmade a liquidation. Young children and old people. They have a special area where they\nare 21 going to leave and, of course, they came in to my grandfather and grandmother\nand they put them right away on the truck, and some other people. And in fact, I was\nrunning to see my grandfather and when I get there, the Germans coming in and open up\nthe wires in this area. They didn't go around. They came in and closed up again. When I\nsee this area closing up with the rifle and the soldiers and the knives, then I turn back. I\nwas afraid because I knew not to go there because I was born there. There was a\nSlobodka the Jewish people they were going to be . This was still in the\nghetto this time but I knew not to go away, to go through there. It was like a little\ncorridor between the two buildings. But when I say they closing the up the area with my\ngrandmother and grandfather, I didn't go back there luckily. If not, I would be catched by\nthem and not even here. Then they started taking out people. We didn't know where and\nthen, of course, they took them right away to Nitenfort(ph) and they killed them. I'm\ntalking this was tons of people. I couldn't give a number, and this was going on for a little\nwhile. And right away the Germans came in with and the Jewish people to make\nyou going to there and you going to this, and they are started getting organized. I 22\nwould say three or four weeks this got already a , you know, Jews come\nand they got people. They are putting the star of and they making people in\ncharge. You do this and you do this. And people from the other parts, Latvia and\nnever had enough food -- got involved in this, start taking out people already from the\nghetto right away from work. The people going to work on the airport or the they\ncall this. It was before the Russian, but the Germans took it over and they took people for\nlabor. And I myself was supposed to go too, but somehow I had a chance to stay back.\nMore and more we get tougher and tougher. Every day was they put the people in\nour house and what we have? Kitchen and dining room and living room, a bedroom,\neverything was in a long straight. If you go to the kitchen, you go to the dining room -- it\nwas a long house. I couldn't compare the house like they have here. It was a nice but in\nthis house we are living four people, but they put in 15 people. They put in people if my\nwhatever we had. This was already in the ghetto. Then they started taking out. By\nthis time the make the Auschwitz. They start taking out people they had more room to\nrelease the prisoners. They came in and said there were too many people in your 23\nhouse. It was going on like this for a little, a house we have plenty of room for them. It\nwas going for a little while like this and then we are going to work. And I point out this\nthing that happened to me in the ghetto. In the beginning we had a cow and horse and\nwhen the ghetto start, there was a sign right away. Everything you possess you have to\ngive it away. Of course, we had a horse andI had __I have the . I left them.\nWhen I went when I left, when we were running away. The were still\nthere and I thought maybe ten or fifteen . There came a family from the ghetto.\nThey run away from friends. They used to get it was not kosher, whatever. It was\nthe -- they took the took the Germans you going to cook them and eat them. I said\nI didn't know what to do with the __. They took the horse. We had to give the horse.\nMy father hide it in the place where the horse was staying, and a couple weeks these\nloudspeakers come and everything you possess and everything you have from the living\nthing, even a chicken, even a fork, everything that alive you were not allowed to have.\nMy father had to give the horse to the Germans. We get shot if they catch us with it. One\nnight I go with my father and there was a lot of places where 24 they had, farmer people\nused to come rest, and then there was a few places like this. There was a police there, I\nremember, when we had to take the police over there and there was German, the ghetto\nand everybody had cows and animal and things. I will tell you about a cow. They left a\nfew cows in the ghetto for the milking. My father had to give up the horse. It was such a\nkind horse. He used to eat from the your hand. He was like a dog really, not a horse. The\nhorse was so frightened that he start kick and had kicked up the German he almost kill\nhim. He almost knocked down the German. He grabbed the gun against the horse, you\nknow, and he grabbed the gun against my father and, did you tell him to do this? And my\nfather said, I can talk to the horse. He touched the horse and looked him in the mouth and\nhe said, this is a good horse. We ask to use it. Of course, they took it away and kick my\nfather as a thank you and kick him away because my father was going to . It was\non our street. This was the horse and when the ghetto start, they leave a few cows in the\nghetto for the . This was supposed to be. They were nice in the beginning. Then\none of the Jews -- the police came to our house and said you are going to feed the cow.\nWe take the cow from the house, from this house, 25 whatever -- was in the cows was\nstanding, pull the cows out, not to far to the ; I went to the cow and he\nrun away and I was so hurt. I felt the cow was -- I was laying down underneath the cow\nwhen a Partisan who looked at the cow and saw the milk is getting bigger, and he looked\nunderneath the cow and maybe thought I was going to drink or something, and it was a\nlittle angry, the Partisan. The was not too far away and he shoot at me. The cow\ngot scared and the cow jumped away, kicked me. I started running into the ghetto and I\nwas chasing the cow, and the cow run until I grabbed the cow and pulled her and back\nput it back where the cow belonged. It was the the first few days. It was then,\nwhen the ghetto was going. On I went a few times to work. You also go to work and then\nthey block the ghetto altogether, and they -- and they made a big action. And this is the\nthing, that thing make this was a small ghetto from a big ghetto, and they -- I\nthink they, before they got liquidated we had experience with what they are doing. I will\ntell you about this too, then I will tell you about the action. When they liquidated they\ntook most of the people from the small ghetto and taking them to the Nitenfort(ph) taking\nthem to the Nitenfort(ph), but before they did it 26 there was a hospital in this small\nghetto. It was run by Jewish doctor and all kind of people that were capable to run a\nhospital. It was a regular hospital before. When our house was not too far away from the\ngates where they make, and then across the street there was a another ghetto and you can\nsee in the back of our house a few blocks away, not in blocks. There was a then.\nOver there was you can see they built a study for Jewish learning and farther away from\nthe hospital I -- like I say, our house was not so tall but the house in front was four or five\nstories. They closed up the small ghetto altogether. The military and the soldiers and the\nGermans and the Partisans were there. When I went up in the roof -- I was young when\nwe were living -- there was a little window to look out. I saw what was going on. They\nwere kicking people and punching them around and putting them in the sections. And\nwhen I say from far away, I saw them coming around the fire, and two or five wagons\naround the building, and then the Germans. And they put a store on the building. They\ntake the kerosene and gasoline and they put this building on fire, and they are jumping,\nlive people. I'm sure four, five hundred people in the building, maybe more. When they\nbring down the hospital, they were laughing. 27 I could see. I was not far away. When\npeople try to run to the window, they were shooting them. They were falling like a bag,\nlike nothing. We saw this was going on and this was the small hospital. That's the way\nthey liquidated the hospital. Then the big action came from the big ghetto and then, of\ncourse, they run around with the loudspeakers. And this time was already the ghetto\norganized. It was the Jew Police. In fact, my uncle -- he was not a plain person but he\nlooked like a bit, looked German. Here a room for you, going to watch this street. You\ncan watch the street. It should be quiet. People shouldn't stay in groups and talk. He was a\nquiet man, but thanks to him this life too, in concentration camp. But the way it\nlooked like because of him we went on the good side and my aunt went to the other side.\nAnd when they make the big action, they came out with loudspeakers and start saying\neverybody have to meet in this certain place. It was an empty place in the ghetto. They\nstage things like this. It was empty, where people used to play football. This was thought\nnothing but there was no . There was woods and cemetery not too far away, and\nthey put all the people, everybody young and old and not sick, everybody have to be\nthere. And they took out from 28 their houses, carry them out from the beds and, of\ncourse, they came back to the houses looked like the people were. There was thousand\nand thousand of people and they make a selection and they make people -- panicking\npeople. Can't take nothing with you. When people get lost from each other, you can hear\nthem saying mama, papa , you know, the Jewish name. There was a panic and this\nwas early in the morning. It was maybe five o'clock in the morning the day before. It was\nnot light outside. You have to go to this truck. We came to this place where it was\nstanding, couple trucks for the Germans and the Partisans, and there was the Germans\nstanding with the little stick. And everybody have to got to face him, and you right, left,\nright, left, and the Jewish Police have to take the group, 30 or 40 people, up to this man.\nThere was a few of them and it looked like my uncle, and he run over to us, because he\nwas this time a little room for us and he said follow me, beginning with me, and\nsomehow he thought maybe he could make a move or something. The Germans\nsaid we should go to the right side or the left side, I don't know, but we followed my\nuncle and we went to the right side. We saw the people go to the left. They are treating\nthem more awful then they are 29 treating us. On the right side we saw -- it was looser,\nthe ghetto, more and the left was closer the other side. And he separate into thousand and\nthousand of people, and they open up the gates and put the people back in the clean\nghetto, back where they burned the hospital. It was still there and they moved them in\nthere. And it was deep in the night and everything starts falling to quiet, and they came to\nthe right side and they said you can go if you have the houses where you live. Go back to\nyour homes and we are still in the ghetto and they was pulling on the people in the left\nside, and stopping the soldiers, the Partisans. And like I say, the Lithuanians\nwere maybe with the Germans and they put them in the other side, and we went\nback. Of course, in the panic and we missing -- my father is not here with my mother, and\nmy father and my brother were lucky this time and we were pulled back to our home.\nAnd like I say, we are not too far away from the smaller ghetto and other people going to\nhouses here. The whole night screaming and panicking and so like in the morning, they\nopened up in the morning and they put them all in the line and put them in the Nitenfort.\nThere was house, I don't know the number, but it was, you couldn't see from one end to\nthe 30 other, there was so many people. This was small babies and they did\neverything. This was a big action, they call it. It was big the action.",
        "A: We knew because, because we knew earlier because they killed our grandfather the\nNitenfort and you were going out to work and this faction -- so telling us what happened\nto us. I didn't see good people. There was maybe a few. I didn't see a good German where\nI was, but I won't go into it, and they took these people and start them marching them to\nthe Nitenfort, and we were still remaining in the ghetto. This was our luck, and in the\nmorning the ghetto was completely empty, the small ghetto, and we could hear in the\nnight the machine guns and the shooting, because the Nitenfort was not really far away\nfrom the ghetto. It was just really a couple kilometer up the hill. And sometimes playing,\nsometimes there I didn't know what was going to happen there, and you could see from\nthe Nitenfort and see Slobodka. It was not so far away. And we could hear the shooting\ngoing on and the killing and, of course, nobody came back from there. And sometime we\nknew what was going on even before they are taking people in the Germany and the\nAustria and marching them between the two lines, two ghettos. 31 They were killing\nthem over there too, and where were we going. We knew already. This night you don't\ntell people that they are going be killed. You couldn't make any move. If anybody move,\nyour would lose you're life. And now I was walking down, and I liked to carve. Now, I\nwas walking down, but I always like too carve and make airplanes and things like this.\nOne day in the ghetto time, I was already working on the airport and we were digging\nditches and doing some other thing. They had a lot of prisoners. The Russians treat them\nterrible. Germans, they so do the prisoners was to uS was you were\nJews. It was coming to us. That was the way they thought. But even to the Russian\nmilitary they lost a little bit of faith, are we going to be alive. It was going on and when\nditches -- going back to the ghetto -- I was not going to work. I was sitting outside and I\nwas carving a little airplane and all of a sudden the Germans came in. They were free to\ngo in their Jeeps and the Germans stopped. Four Germans walked to me and said to me\nwhat are you doing there? I am playing. I am making myself a toy. How do you\nknow to make an airplane? You know, to me and I spoke, I think little and I spoke\nGerman in a way too because it was similar, so I told him I always 32 like to play. Do\nyou have more knives? And I said, no, I have this one. No, I have this knife. And he said,\nyou go to the Jeep, and I said, I want to tell my mother. And he kicked me and put me in\nthe Jeep and I thought they were going to kill me, kill me. Downtown in the there\nisa school. People used to learn there. This was the headquarters for the\nGermans they put me in a basement and said to me, we aren't going to do nothing to you.\nWe want you to make airplanes for us. I didn't know what they wanted from me. I said,\ncan you tell my parents? One of them okay, I'll tell them. My mother and father\nthought I was dead. Because my mother and father thought I was dead. They took me out\nand -- this was going on all the time. I was there maybe a couple of days. I don't know\nwhether it was night or day because it was dark there, but it was light inside. And they\nbring me all kinds of tools and I made toys. I made a butterfly and an airplane and they\nkeep on saying, keep on doing, keep on doing. I was a couple days and they took from\neverybody. I had a imagination and I always like to look at the airplanes, and when I was\nyounger I dreamed of becoming pilot. Can you imagine me a pilot? But I had a dream.\nWho knows, if the war wouldn't be there 33 or something. And I was doing these\nairplanes for them and I took maybe four or five models. They gave me soft wood.\nI never worked with this. I tried to get out here and I even so I was doing. A few\ndays went by and they came and said, oh, come on, you know, in German. I think they\ngoing to shoot me or something. They take me back to the same German that picked me\nup and, you know, drop me off at the gate and said go, go. They opened up the\ngate and it was also the Jewish Police guard, and what happened to you? They took me\nthere and I was making the airplanes. I went in by foot not too far away from the grates\nwhere you go in into main gates to go in when you get out from the ghetto. Of\ncourse, my mother and my father was working there and they thought I was dead. And\nthen life still was going the same system like it was and the next day I had to go to work.\nWhen there in the ghetto a certain time, not all the time in the ghetto, and then all of\nsudden somebody came to the building. Back of the building had to be open. Didn't have\nto be closed anymore. Now, the place where we were living, the house was a lot of sacks.\nMy father had the horses there. It was a big area and we wait for the ghetto, to wait for\nthe ghetto. To come there was a beautiful wood and the 34 trees and this area, it was like\na place that you can unload some wood and coals there was not room. We did this for a\nlittle while. There was a garden. We cleaned up the garden made enough place\nto put in the roots, and they brought the horses, and they came from the street and they\nwas killing them in the sacks. This was the meat for us to eat in the ghetto.",
        "A: The horses were wounded from the war, but also not enough. They used to\nbring them there, not far away from our horses.",
        "A: Call it a sack.",
        "A: A place where you have like a garage. It was not a garage. There was four of them like\nthis and they used to bring the horses there, and they would bring the people from the\nghetto and kill the horses and slaughter them and put them in the other place and cut it\napart and give it to the -- there was meat and some of the horses I'm sure were sick. Some\nof those horses couldn't even make it. They brought them in the ghetto and give it to the\nJewish people, and here's. Do what you want with it. But one day we 35 hear a knock on\nthe door. It was early in the morning they came in with the Jewish Police and a German.\nYou're family is chosen to be, to go to work. You are going to be in the ghetto and we are\ngoing to send you to the . They call it in a place where the castle is, and we\nthought they were going -- can take nothing with us. Whatever we had possessions. Of\ncourse, we had some stuff in there, in the ghetto that was going on. We had a farming\ncoat and we used to go by the wire and they would come back on business, and I didn't\nwant to keep it. Before I left the ghetto -- 1t was before the action -- and I remember my\nfather got a coat for my mother. It was a beautiful coat like a mink coat, and they walked\nover to the gates and there were the dying people and she said, what can I get for it? I\nhave a kilo of butter and things like this, and over the gate and the Partisans were\nguarding us. They looked away and they were making stuff like business, and take\neverything away that they could. And I remember my father was quarter pound\nof butter or meat for the coat. And other people sold beautiful things. A dead cat, you\nknow. You know, what was in the bag. A lot of people making dogs, or something\none put in a poison. The things that were coming over, you don't know what 36\nyou got in this. My father was lucky. He got a piece of meat because maybe it was\npoisoned and we tested. We needed it. We tested and it was butter. And then they took\nus. Like I say, we came back. I don't want to skip this little story the way they are treating\nus there.",
        "A: We were given food, bringing into the ghetto. There was a certain place you could go in\nand pick it up. There was not food, but everybody made a little garden and some people\nused to go to work and bring food in the ghetto. It was going on like a business.",
        "A: In fact, my mother had a piece of bread and I said to my mother I was hungry, but my\nbrother was hungry and I said, can I have a piece of bread, and she didn't keep it for\nherself. She keep it for us and I said to my brother, and she said my brother was hungry\nand gave me a little piece and she didn't take it. We were always hungry. And then they\ntook us from the ghetto out from our house.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: We were hungry all the time. There was not much to eat and like I said, they gave away\nall other possessions that they had. They go to the gates and for food -- and but in\nthe ghetto someone was going out to work who somehow, some people were making was\nmake like a black market. Some of other people from taking out whatever they can for us.\nSome food in the ghetto was not enough, but it was not . When I was in the\nghetto, when I was in the ghetto for a long time right after the big action I didn't have too\nmuch. When I was in the ghetto, I couldn't remember the month, three quarters of year,\nand they took us to the castle like I say.",
        "A: Yes. In the ghetto I had friends, started a stamp collection. I still have some. We had a\nlittle time. Some of them came from other areas. They didn't have a home, have clothes. I\nwas still in my house. I had collections of stamps and some pictures of other guys, and\nacross the street I was living there was a place. This used to be a store like a supermarket\nand it was 38 very wealthy person, and there was a big yard and people used to come in\nthere and people stop in horses and wagons, not cars. We were more on the farm side,\nyou know. We used to stay over there and buy some food and things like this. They had\ntwo sons and we were friends and, in fact, the same age. One was the same age as I am\nand one was my brother's age and my father was and we were going up together.\nThis was before the war. I want to point this out because this was at ghetto and then they\nleft and I will tell you what happened. This was before the children used to come to our\nhouse and my mother used to make for dinner, and the children used to come eat with us\nbecause the reason why, because they had leftovers. The apple, the pear and normal\ncountry food was not this time. They used to come and eat the leftovers and my mother\nsaid we always cooking for them, and in the ghetto they were taken away. I didn't see\nthem. I saw them for a little while in the ghetto. We couldn't go, you know, across the\nstreet and find out where are you. They went somewhere else to work. I saw them right\nbefore the action. After the big action, I didn't see them. I didn't see the whole family. I\ndidn't know what happened to them. They were either taken -- I will tell you, we met his\n39 father in the concentration camp. We didn't know what happened to them. Houses\nwere taken away from people. There was people were sleeping there. There was no store\nanymore but this was in the ghetto time and I didn't know what happened to them until\nwe came in the concentration camp until -- I remember them?",
        "A: People children used to play -- jumping on one foot and making -- I was already bigger\nby this time and the ghetto was around 12 to 13 years and -- you don't jump on one foot --\nand Hitler was not in this because we were looking for survival, and he asked me if I was\nafraid for my life. There was not a day I was not afraid for my life. I came back to the and\nbeginning. Like I mentioned in the beginning, in our house came a family from France,\nand they were eating the rabbits. But there was a boy. He was very intelligent, young\nman, my age, and they are burning our place and we were leaving. Like I say they\nburning some wood for the ghetto to bring, you know, to burn for the, for the office and\nthings like this. They also used to bring boxes from the military for wood for kindling\nlighting. In the boxes they had a lot of screws and nails and things like this, and this boy\nwas also 40 going to work. It was Sunday and I didn't go to work and this boy said, I\nhave a trick to make and, I said, fine. He said, let's take two of the bulbs and take two\nscrews put them together and put inside some and you see it will like explode.\nThis was in the ghetto time. We are going back to the ghetto. He also handy and he told\nme -- I was doing it and I took it, the knot and put a screw in one side, a metal screw and\nfilled up the knot with heavy powder and filled 1t with powder put another screw in the\nother side, and took a rope from side and tied it up and swung it and knocked it against\nthe wall. And in our backyard -- and there was in our backyard was a building for bricks,\nyou know, for the , you know, where you put the garbage cans and cans with\nemptying. We had just drop it in and sort it out. It was made out of brick. When I was\nswinging this string with this wire knot it exploded, but it gave such a shot that\nwe were not too far away from the gate and from the and the Germans were\nguarding. And like I say, they were on the other side and from nowheres we get such a\nshot and the smoke came out and I didn't know what happened to me. And there was\ncompletely exploded and the knot was going, and I see the wire in my hand, and it took\nme three 41 seconds, five seconds, ten seconds. Missiles were coming from out of the\nother side from the ghetto, and they cut the wire and came in right away from the army. I\ndon't know where they came and they surrounded the whole area and said who shot? And\nwhat happened, this piece of wire, this piece of metal fly so far and hit one the soldiers in\nthe helmet. And I didn't know what happened. And they said who shot all they\ncame in to our place where we were living and took everybody out the houses. And those\npeople are going to work some. Took my mother my father, everybody, who shot? And I\nwas the one who did it. And I spoke German and I was getting better in German. I was\ngetting better, got used the to the , you know, it seemed like the Jews were getting\nclose to German. I had to, when this shot was going, to kill us and I raised my hand and I\nsaid, I did it with this little French boy and somehow, you know, I spoke to him\nand one the Germans said -- and they were also Partisans there -- and they took us and\nput us with this man, and was almost big, big, man for the German and said,\nwhere is the gun? We said, we don't have a gun he said -- we are praying -- he\nsaid, how are you doing it? I had to demonstrate and, of course, when he saw what I'm\ngoing 42 to demonstrate, and he told the whole 50 or 60 soldiers and rifles, and one of\nthem with the knife out and sent them back out to go on. And there are new soldiers and I\nhave to demonstrate, and it didn't work I tried to bang it and bang it and, the German\nsaid, I'm going to show you. And he took it in the hand and knocked it and\nalmost knocked it off his hand and burned him. He had gloves and he said, I see how you\ndid it. He was really embarrassed to things like this. He didn't realize it was going to\nexplode but this guy from France, I know his father told them, I don't know how\nhe came in to idea and, of course, he realized that this was no or whatever, then\nrealized, and he felt a little bit bad and knocked it with a stone and made with a stone.\nAnd it made him a little bit more guilty, and somehow he could kill us like nothing and\nonly flying and you know, he had the power. He didn't have the chance\nof playing in the ghetto. This was my play and I didn't have much time to play because\nwe had to go to work.",
        "A: I worked in the airport. They were putting in some stones and loading and unloading\ntrucks for the Germans, and some of them were load it out and put it 43 in the airplanes\nand . There was an airplane, you know, it was a big it up and I was\nworking. They gave us also -- you always to do something in the ghetto. I was there. I\nused to -- people made gardens and they used to take us to pull out the carrots and potatos\nand dig it up and plant a little around. Some backyards had a lot and belong not to the\npeople, but belong to the people in the committee, and they used to give it out to the\npeople. This was my work.",
        "A: My brother was there and my brother was also involved same like me, but he was\nsomehow going more to work like I did. I used to go three times a week and he had to go\nfive times a week. He was a little older, and sometimes my father said go and he can stay.\nYou didn't have a choice what to do. But somehow I stayed behind in the ghetto. I had to\ndo something. I had to go to the and things like this. My brother was older by this\ntime and he got so survived.",
        "A: I didn't see because when I was in the ghetto was in the beginning, you know. Some of\nthem is good 44 people. Everywhere some of them was showing a good face for the\nGermans and Lithuanian soldiers and pushing around and kicking around. Some of them\nhave to do it and some of them, you know, were nice. And so long as they have\nsomething to do. I didn't see too much bad from the police because like I say, I was at the\nend of it. Some of them were bad. I remember from the concentration camp, a couple, but\nthere was also the Germans, Jewish men, and who was not but I didn't have too\nmuch connection with the Jewish Police.",
        "A: My father knew him from in the army and Lithuanian and had he knew Dr. Elkuis\npersonally, and maybe he got is or something. He was a very famous\ndoctor, and in the camps he was doing something for my father. He operated on his foot.",
        "A: I remember Dr. Elkus -- he was a big man, he was doing his job. He was\norganizing people to go to work and things like this. He was on the committee as much as\nI can remember, but my father remembered him from the young years when we were\nfree. Then of course, when in the concentration camp with him.",
        "A: Yes. They called , you know, there was schools in the ghetto where they were\nteaching not just for our benefit but for their benefit. There was electrician school and\nthere was a school for mechanical things.",
        "A: In the ghetto the Jews set it up and the Germans support it, but I didn't have a chance to\ngo to this place because I was deported to the this other place. The castle they call this.",
        "A: It was in the beginning of summer, like I say, in May or April like this.\nbut it was a little ten blocks. It was a place and there was a purpose for water outside, and\nthere was not too much. And there was what I call a garage, like a sack and there was a\nplace to keep the food and there was no place to play football there. It was very together.\nAnd a little farther you look out from the other side, you could see the . It was\nthe castle and not too far away, and you go in this one and you go in this one. Luckily, it\nwas still my father and my mother and my brother. We were lucky there. It was lucky\nI would say I was the lucky one to be with the family together, in this particular\narea and they took us the right next day and a was the man in charge and I\nremember he had this family too. I forgot his wife and in this group was only one small\nchild. They hide it in the ghetto and -- I don't know how they brought him in, hiding in a\nbox or something -- made him to come in. This little boy was around five years old.\nThere was no way for five year old to survive. But in the ghetto was a few people before\nthey made the they called us. They take all the children on the force and they had\nsome small children in the ghetto, hiding and things like this, and in this 48 castle\nthere was most of the people were my age, a little older, who, of course, the people like\nmy mother and my father. And there was a families. Not families, a few. There were\nsome families, lost their family already in the big action. I was really -- not all the people\n-- I was really this family was holding together. The rest was already torn apart.\nAnd they made us to go to work there. We go there and I was working in the castle and\nthere , and we making the rooms, rooms making ride around with horse\nand build a school and put in . We were always doing this type of work, but there\nwas a German almost it was a big man. A little bit less . He was the man\nin charge to make sure the people should go to work. That was his duty. But this man\nalso had barber used to cut the hair for the soldiers. He was he was was\nnot he was cutting the hair for the soldiers and then he and he choose me\nto take this like this. I should make sure and I be the first one back, and soap to\nbe clean and I was back, make sure everybody got a soap to be clean or this get a\nand I was in charge, like to give out the . In a way I was very obeying\norders. What did you want me to do? He was like a 49 German, like any German. But we\ndidn't feel the presence because we were away from the ghetto. I to do this and I was to\ntake other work. I was walking over to . He was a sculptor and he was make a\nface for Hitler and I have to assist him, but before I came to this in this camp and in this\ncastle, I was doing, I was doing all kind of work. And my mother was going out with the\nwomens to cut woods. They are cutting go down trees. The men were doing and a little\nbit other works, cement and things like this. In there in this castle they were building it so\nfast. They could do things overnight. They building a school and brought the -- this\nbrought in over there for Hitler to -- they brought in from France the a lot of\npeople young people my age, and we were a little bit younger, and little bit older. The\nolder boys were going to gentile they had to have duty. They learn to be a soldier too.\nThey have the right to have a rifle. There was a little called him. He was kind and\nhe was guarding me sometime and guarding everybody, but one day I saw him. I was\ngoing out with my mother this time in the field to cut the trees, and this time I was going\nto cut the tree and this was -- before I was telling you, I was telling you about the\nand he went -- my 50 mother was not pulling the saw so fast, and he took a stick and he\nbeat my mother. And I was not far away and I was running to him but other people were\nholding me. Father was not there and they were holding me back not to go, and hit my\nmother. And I remember this and this one was on duty. He was two days with the rifle\nand two days, I was working there in this castle for bring water, was water was\nthere is not water. You had to go to the water and bring it to the kitchen for the soldiers. I\nwas walking and I overhear you look like you're handy. You're going to help me\nout there. I was not there three months and there was a sculptor and he was making a face\nfor Hitler, and I was talking to him he was a because I was going on what's going\non\u2019? But everybody -- there was not one person in the German Army. Biggest one, he was\nvery intelligent man and he made a face of Hitler, this the sculptor and I was supplying\nhim with the clay, making the clay make forms. When day when I remember this boy was\nhitting on my mother and beating up my mother, and this was area in the area and\nsometimes we had to go out and fill up a bucket of water, and I say one day he\ncame in for duty and he was on the second floor -- no top floor -- where he was putting a\nsculptor 51 and he said to me go down -- in German -- bring me some\nwater and they show this fresh water coming in well. There was a kitchen\ndownstair and there was a smaller building, and there was a cook and there was a bunch\nof prostitutes, and there was and they were working for the Germans. And they\nwere having a good time with the soldier and this was all going on over there. When I go\ndown, he told me to go down with the bottle and I took the bottle with me and I\nand he bring the bottle over to -- and nobody's there. And he is downstairs 1n the kitchen\nthere and I took the bottle and opened up the nozzle and washed the bottle nice. I didn't\nknow if the German was watching me or not. I filled up the bottle and I closed it up and I\nclose it up and I taste it. I was thirsty and honestly, I was dropping it. I was afraid to spill\nit on the ground. I was dripping a little in my mouth and I felt a push and, you know, and\nmy mouth went right in the nozzle. And I opened my eyes and I see this beat up\nmy mother. He didn't have a rifle. He took a stick and was trying to make like the horse\ngoing faster -- I don't know how you say it in English -- the took the and he start\nwhipping me, you know, because when he pushed me I fell. I went up against him. I\nthought it cut 52 my throat, whatever. He took this stick and he was smashing me and\nbeating me up, and the girls, don't hit him, girls from the beat him, give him and\neveryone on his side, of course, and I had been very thirsty and, you know, the bottle I\nhad for the and he standing on the bucket -- and I don't know. He beat me so fast I\ncouldn't take it. I pulled the rope and I kicked him. When I kicked him -- and this was the\nbasement and he fall. He lost his grip and he fell in the basement. And soon as I did this,\nof course -- he was also a soldier. He run out. All the girls and a couple soldiers right\naway, and one of the them put a rifle. And they were German too. A little drunk and\nhaving a good time with the girls. They were going to shoot me. They were going to\nshoot me. It was a miracle at the time this was going on, one of Germans said, you know\nwhat you do? You pushed a German. And they were going to shoot me. There was no\nway to survive but he looked like -- he told me later -- there it is not to too far\naway and he said to them in German, what is going on here? And I told him. I was\nbleeding from my mouth a little bit and I told him I was cleaning the bottle and he said,\ndon't tell me. I saw everything. He saw what was going on. He saw that I didn't\ndrink from this 53 bottle. He said, I saw. I was laying down and dripping it from the\nbottle dry, in into my mouth and, of course, he was such a big man. All of them were --\nwith the revolver to my head, he was afraid to say a word against him. , you\nknow, let the boy go. He was walking with me and it's not his fault, it's his fault, he\nstarted up with him. That's what he said. I took the bottle and went up with him, and I\ntook the bottle and went up with him and he told me if I needed -- he didn't give me any\nwater. Are you okay? I okay. I felt like I should say, but I didn't. There was water like I\ntake for the clay, not for me to drink because there was no glass. I . There was\nwater that I used for the clay. It was clear water from the well for the clay -- and take\nanother clean water. No drinking water but this was clean water from the well. We had\nother water also but it was not drinking, for drinking. But I think I remember I took a\nlittle bit to the water and washed my face and then I walked with him over there for a\nlittle while, and then he was deported, you know, they took him away somewhere. To go\nI was walking again and with these people and they walk in the woods, and they\nsaw this whole thing until this was going on. But in same time I was going out my 54\ntooth was hurting me, and the men said to me in the ghetto, they have a tooth doctor, A\ndentis, you know, they had in the ghetto they had everything. They said we have to go\nbring some food for the camp. We are going to take you and your father this time and we\nwill take you to the dentist and see what they can do. He was a nice man. I went with my\nfather and we are there in the area and we came into the ghetto. I went -- I came into the\nghetto. They didn't let us in the ghetto. But the gates not too far away, wagon with a little\ntruck which belonged to the German and good for they -- and this camp and this was for\nthis one and there wasn't and we had to load it on. I wanted to go to the dentist,\nyou know, but somehow the police, they said to my father, don't go in the ghetto because\nthere is going to be a . There is going to be a selection and taking out all the\nchildren. Because when they closed up the gates nobody can go in the ghetto, nobody can\ncome out of the ghetto and the policeman told us we supposed to go out to the castle but\nwe couldn't go out. But luckily, I don't know, somehow it must have been the telephone\nand things like this, they delayed us for about an hour. And all of sudden they came and\nthey the trucks were full and they made the selection. 55 They went in every house over\nthere and they went deep in the ghetto, and I was right by the gates. I was on the other\nside of the gates, not where I was in the beginning. They were making the selection\nalready. Already they killed people. They -- whatever they could grab. They grabbed the\ngirl and raped her and they cry. Of course, I didn't see it but other people told us, and I\nknow from other people what was going on. And luckily, they had to let us out of the\ngate because they needed food for this place. He was driving the horse and you couldn't\ngoing by German. He was in camp where I was there and we went out and was the\nare you going on the selection in the ghetto. We came back to this. We were not\ntoo far from home. It was about a half hour, hour, not too far away from this place, and\nwe came home and told them what was going on. Selection again. Only for children.\nThey took children, older people, whatever. They couldn't -- they cleared it up. But the\nnext day this I got a note from, you know, the telephone call. The German on the\ntelephone. They are going to check it out in our camp too. There was maybe me, my\nbrother and a few other boys, but then and there was a little boy five years old, and\nthis five-year-old boy had a brother my age. So 56 like I say, and the mother was there.\nThe whole family was like sticking together. This this man that was in charge,\nhe came out. He said, look, I know you have a small son. There you just make\nyourself tall. I remember. I was a tall boy and I would survive. I will tell them you were\nimportant. He has a job he was doing. The -- he had a list of what they are doing. They\ncame in a Jeep, a military car, but Gestapo, the SS, everybody, had to take the barracks.\nThe little boy was in the same barrack where -- he was sleeping. They took the little boy\nand put him on the like they used to do this too. And a German officer or\nsomebody from the army or the ghetto, he looked at. He walked in and look at the little\nstick and I stood up straight and said you know, look, muscles, like a dog, you\nknow. Then I said , you know, small children here. The little one opened up his\nmouth and said to him -- I never forget this -- he said to him, no, there is no small\nchildren. All the children are sleeping, sleeping but he was looked like a German.\nI'm sure but somehow they in German but somehow made him so he said,\nyou know, to the little one, he didn't do nothing to him. And they walked out and\nfor now they did nothing. We thought 57 already this a miracle happening, but I think it\nwas in it was the next day or the same day came out a car with different\nGermans. They arrested the little boy and the man -- you take out a rifle to him big, little\nfor the camp, on the in and the mouth, where is the little boy? He couldn't run out\nof the place and he couldn't run out from the place. There was all the soldiers. They\npulled away this little boy from the -- and the Germans inthe __, like adog. I'm\ntalking about my horse. And like an animal and this little, mommy, mommy. You could\nsee it. You see sometimes in the films. I saw it with my own eyes. She passed out, the\nmother because the father was at work, you know ready to go, ready to go. I\nthink it was the money. They took him away and that's it. This was the experience 1n this\ncamp. We were walking there. There are so many stories to tell about this. It was not\n. | was beaten up a little bit too. And then the time came and we found out the\nRussians are coming closer to the area. You have to be liquidated. And they said to us,\nthis work will stop. And I have a story. Was going there with the time for this.\nWe stop this walk. Now, we said -- now, we're going to take you back to the ghetto and\nthis is going to be no more job for you. 58 We got to the ghetto. That's it. They going to\nkill us. It was a few days. They gave us a warning. We didn't have possessions. Just\nclothes, a few things, nothing to take with us. And they said I don't know where\n-- the German in charge look, I don't know. Where we going? We go to the ghetto. We\nare going like lambs. We couldn't fight because everybody was against you. If you go out\nto the line, they shoot you. If you go out to ask help for a little, they give you out. You\nhave to go like a lamb. There was no way to give resistance and they took us back like\nfoot, and the same way we came there and it was, of course, a year later they took us.",
        "A: I was -- would say it was close to a year. I was in the ghetto until the big action.",
        "A: Luckily, it was not so bad. Of course, we had aches and pains. Who cares? You know,\nyou want to survive. You couldn't complain. Now I complain all the time, sometimes to\nthe doctor, but you couldn't do this. But at this time my father was younger than me than\nI am now. In the 40 and 50, like this. Somehow he was -- he wanted to be alive, to\nsurvive. You gets along even if you have some health. You talk yourself 59 into this that\nit don't hurt.",
        "A: Not bad, because we were we organized food. The woman could cook a little bit in\nthis barracks. It was not bad. It was like the same way in the ghetto. But we had enough\nfood. I remember before I go farther -- I am stopping all the time. I remember there was a\ntime when they found a man wandering outside. They stopped him and they put him in\nthe camp where we are. They pull down the pant and he is circumcised. We got a Jew.\nThey beat him up to death. They beat him so he couldn't talk. He was a little bit crazy,\nand they called in and said they are going to kill him. All of is sudden a Kapo came\nthis was their son. He was not Jewish. They came to the German and had pictures\ntoo. They had a they show it was not a Jew. It was not Jew because this is how\nthey treat us, you know. He was a little bit mentally. He run away from the house. They\ntold him he was circumcised because he was sick or something. And they almost killed\nhim but ambulance came to take him out. This was the way. No respect for the Jews.\nAnyway, going back they tell us we have to leave -- ?",
        "A: In this particular place there was old mattress, smelling and things like that. A little boy\nwas hiding under. The mattress was straw. We had a roof. We went through the cold\nweather and it was really not comfortable, to say it was livable, but we managed\nit.",
        "A: Always get scared to see what was going on, everyone there, people were dying. In our\ncamp sometimes they couldn't make it or beaten up. It 1s not so paradise 1n this place\neither, but still was better than in the concentration camp, and we had nightmares. I still\nhave nightmares. I still remember things. Sometimes I watch a movie and I think I am\nliving there. This is -- I saw Schindler's List. It's nothing. It's much worser. I didn't see a\ngood German. I will tell you a little farther if I have the time. They put us -- and have to\ngo back to the ghetto -- and they march us back to the ghetto. And like I said, it was on\nthe left side of the -- and the ghetto was on the right and the gates were now moved\naround. Not the wire. It was original, but they moved it closer to move to the exit like\nyou go to it was right in a fork. We are going there 61 and praying to\nGod not to go to the left side, because the left side going to Nitenfort. Then they move us\nto start to go to the right and they move to the right, and certain three, four lines away\nfrom the front and I said to my mother get in the back because, you know, you\nfind out you are going to the right side, and then we walk in the ghetto. Soon as we get in\nthe ghetto we are nowhere right away. The police, the Kapos said you have to go\nto the right. In here and stay there. Don't move until you get orders. We don't know where\nto go, what to do, but my father had two, cousins in the ghetto and we didn't know. We\ncame back. We were sitting there, waiting for order and all of sudden I think was\nmaybe the police. He 1s of not policeman. He said you met my father and he said\nwhere are you? I'm staying in the barrack. You want to go. Maybe you should come to\nus. You want to go to them. We didn't know what to do. they have coming in and\nsurrounding the ghetto with machine guns. The whole army was there with loudspeakers.\nPeople are going to be liquidated to Germany for work it was most of them\nworking for.",
        "A: Yes. In the ghetto on loudspeakers, and it was 62 panicking. You see sometimes the\nmoving is chaos, but luckily, my father met his brother and said we should go over there.\nWe went over to the house where he was. A barrack, maybe 500 men living in one block.\nBut we couldn't get in. Of course, it was occupied. We were sitting outside the whole\nnight, holding together my mother, father, brother, and my aunt came outside and\neverybody should get out from the houses.",
        "A: No, no bombs. It was like chaos. The people were hiding and running like it was a raid,\nan air raid. It was a raid for the Germans, and anything was trying to escape from the\nghettos, he shoot them right on the spot. They surrounded. The whole army was there.\nThey put and said, this, this, this, move the people. Let's go. Set up in a line and you're\ngoing. They took them on a ride. My mother, my father, my brother was in one side and\nmy uncle was on the other, and they took us from the ghetto and they took us to the place\nwhere the people are working, to the airport. But they didn't take us to the airport. They\nwas taking you can see it on the map if you have a map of this. They took us\ndown to the train and the trains -- we were walking maybe half a day, andthe \u2014_\u2014_\u2014swere\nlaughing, spitting on us, having a good 63 time. We didn't know where we are going. We\ndidn't believe them. We didn't go to the fork. We are going downtown, you know. It was\na little bit, but we saw the dead constant. We saw dead people. It 1s not simple what I am\nsaying. People are falling like flies. They are shooting people, people who can't work.\nThey take pistol out and shooting people came to work like dogs. We coming into this\ntrain station there. There was wagons like you have in the museum in Washington, full of\nstenching, stinking, you know, from the cow and they said one, two, three, four, five, in\nhere. And my father all together in here and somehow we managed, me, my father and\nmy mother. We went and my uncle and this family all in the same wagon?",
        "A: My brother too. Of course, my two cousins cause one was dead already in the ghetto and\nbrother and about another 50 people. And we were sitting there a day. We didn't know\nwhat was going to be. It was hot outside like this time of the year, and then all of a\nsudden they said and came and closed up. They closed us up right away, like a cow. We\ncouldn't go out and there was wires on the little window and they announced the train\nstart moving, you know, like toot, 64 toot, start moving. It was going to take us to\nDanzig. We didn't know where we were going really and we didn't have any food,\nanything in this train this time. Absolutely nothing. And we were going a whole day and\npeople have to go and piss water and stool and there was nowhere to go, and there was a\nbucket and how much 50 people in a bucket? And some people were a little embarrassed,\nwomen and men, but in this time you didn't see these things. This was when you have to\ndo these things, trying to the little window to pull out the side and the Germans\nwere sitting on the roof and knocking them down banging over the head. And I remember\nwe were going and going and all of sudden the train stop, and there was a bucket of food,\nlike for the people, you know. I don't remember. It was like in a paper, a piece of bread.\nPeople were trying to grab and it one of the guys was there and said, wait a second. We\nall in the same boat. Let's try to be humanized, not like animals.",
        "A: Another -- my father said, no. There was a man and my father said to him some who have\nthese whatever food was there and we was going traveling like this maybe three\ndays. And we saw to the front the wagon the city, 1s going to and places. 65\nPeople are leaving and and we go to the station where the train is, has to go to a\nstation sometimes stopping because they have to give it right of way to other trains. And\nthere was a life going on. Normal people are dressed and, you know, laughing, reading\nnewspaper and outside, and we were going to die. Of course, and then we came closer to\nthe German part and we came to Germany. We didn't know where we were going. We are\ngoing back and forth. And then all of sudden my cousin was -- one of the cars wanted to\njump to the train and get a ride, but somehow the wagon got caught, a little cut in the\nmiddle of night. He got open the top and trying to crawl and he have succeeded right on\nthe roofs. He could not escape from the train either. We are going and all of a sudden\nDanzig. We saw a sign the train stopped in Stutthof, and said to us we go\nout and we couldn't breathe anymore, and the urine and the stool and we didn't make it,\nbut we didn't make in, not in our pant. And we made it on the floor. It was full with the\ncows. It was a disaster. I think maybe another day we be choked on the fumes. They stop\nthe train and he said men men separate and fathers separate, and then, of\ncourse, they took away. I said bye to my mother and my aunt and all this, and 66 we had\na piece of bread and I gave to my mother, I remember and Reds came and\nbut some were a little younger because some came from the ghetto and they was\nmixed up. And in the ghetto there was a few youngsters my age. They went with the\nmother. Instead of I went with my father and my brother. I stayed with the men side, but\nit didn't take too long soon. They took out the was left more room with, because\nthey took out. They didn't put in new people. We saw people with the stripes. Already\nwas during the war, taking the people in the camp and we waved before the door closed\nup and waved to my mother and that's it. The train started blowing the whistle and going\nwith a run away full speed, we going again, maybe a day or two days. And there was a\nstop again and they give us water to drink and they put a bucket and one glass, I think,\nand there was a glass, a can they give us. Drink whatever and we came in the Dachau.\nWe saw to this camp, overheard. People knew about already about Dachau and things\nlike this. We came into Dachau and instead of no this one is. We shouldn't stay\nhere on this train. This is train is going to Landsberg, not to Dachau and this train is\ngoing this way. And then we going backwards, you know, they put another -- they going\nto the machine to 67 pull us out. We are in the camp, they pull us out and we are going\nback. And this would take maybe about three or four hour, and we came in away from\nDachau and came in a place and they and we walked out. We don't see nothing.\nAn empty spot. This was Landsberg blocks made out of cardboard you see like the tins,\nlike paper and right away they start kicking you. So the people, you know, with the\nnot the Jews, but they had Jewish stars with a '\"V\" like up sideway\nGermans also some of them and they were it -- and it almost people,\nyou know. Whatever they called them. You know, it was all kind of people there.\nMurderers. They put them in this place. The guy, the guy he was already a Meister over\nus the Kapo and they are doing the whole thing and some who have them\nthey put us right away kicking and kicking, and they take us to a big build and they said,\nyou are going to be unclothed and to clean us up. We don't know what is happening and\nhere I am holding with my brother and father and things like this. They coming in\nDachau hundreds of people. A whole big thing going on and we have to walk\nover to this building and stay alive. You are going to get a shower and a uniform, and\neverything you possesses if somebody has something from the 68 ghetto, whatever it is.\nThere was a new German at a table and give it to them. You have to be completely\nundressed when you go into the shower. We knew. We heard about the stories of the\ncrematorium and this, but somehow we didn't feel this a working camp and the guys said,\ndon't worry. You are going to work and you people was and they put us in over\nthere and everything. One was undressed and some of them had some ring hiding,\nwhatever, something, whatever they brought from ghetto. They all together.\nThere was 5,000 people in this camp and maybe there 1s a couple thousand people. They\ncall a transport in the train and they came from other places and put everything over\nthere. We have to undress and we have to go into in this . We have to wait but we\ndon't know. We don't see people coming out. There was another exit and we saw people\ncoming out dressed already. So we had a feeling this was -- so we go in and everybody\nwas undressed and Jewish people and men. There was there before us not just Jewish\npeople no. They had some spray. You started to spray you under the arm, on the\npart, the men part, over the hair. They try spray it right in your eye. They was laughing.\nThis was already a working camp. There was the . Anyway, they put us in the\nshowers. A 69 whole building sort of this. There was water coming out. It was ice cold.\nThis was terrible. People passed out, and then it was a little bit warm and we went\nthrough this one. And there was uniforms waiting on the other side and look. And they\nsaid, look, ____ some for them was too short. Everybody get a uniform. I got a uniform. I\nwas lost in it and this man said give me this one and I switched with him. There was no\nshirt or nothing. Just a uniform with stripes and little hat. They kicked us, of course, and\nthere were German people working there. And they put us 1n a line and said one, two,\nthree, four, you go in this part. And one, two, three, four, and number one 1s -- it\ntwo and somehow I stick with my, with my uncle. I don't know what's happen today. My\ncousin, he's disappeared I was holding onto my father and we falling. In the\nbeginning in one barrack and come back there was nothing for the dig. There was\ncardboard made. It was a digged out on the inside and there was made from cardboard\nand nothing. The was still warm, but you were making the box yourself and the\nbox then the next we have to stay there and we were sleeping there. There was a\nlittle, little bit straw under the bed. Lay down and no pillows or nothing. This was where\nwe sleep. This 70 was with the working camp. This was the building. Camp was built by\nthis time that we came in, and we stay overnight and sometime before we came to the\nbarracks -- I skipped something. I have to go back. They said to the people, where are\nyour possessions? All of the people before they go into the shower, they have had a ditch\nout like a toilet and you sit over this and behind, and they make the and you can\nsee it was falling. There was people before. There was a ditch there where people before.\nIt was a long ditch I would say around five or six hundred foot long. And when they\ncame out and said -- a lot of people, you know, saving diamond ring or some money,\nwhatever they had from the ghetto, throw it in the ditch to give to the Germans.\nSomehow they give to the Germans. Somehow they had work for it and they came out\nand they said they'd like to have all the doctors, the lawyers. I have special work for them\nand we have a lot of intelligent people there. My father was going but I can't. I'm too\nyoung, but my father didn't want to raise his hand to say he was not a doctor, but Jewish\npeople are a lot of intelligent people. But before the people, they tell them before they\ntold the people that had the uniform before they went to the back, undress I'm going to\ngive special 71 work for you. You are going to go inside and take out with your hand\nwhatever you find this. You have to take out the wastes from the people with their hand.\nAnd there was maybe a two foot or one foot and the fumes and the heat, and it was\ndrying from the sun. It was smelly in this area. You couldn't get -- you could get far\naway. People going in, half of them didn't go out. And they fall in. They pull them out,\ndead. And they fall in. We thought we never survive this. They came out smelling, you\nknow, the people that came out that survived. Of course, they didn't let them in. They\ntook I didn't see because they said one of them, this is the work that you Jews\nare going to get. For us this was intelligent. This is what you have to do. You have no\nright to be a doctor or a lawyer or whatever it was. Of course, I was not in the ditch. I\nstayed in the back, and in the morning we hear a whistle and there was a place to\ngo out and they said to us, make groups we are going to work in . It's about four or\nfive kilometers from this area. And at the same time you are going to make a building\nbarracks for us, you know, to give us a paradise. We going to be in heaven and they took\nthe group and this time I was lucky and stay with my father and brother and stay in the\nsame 72 line. There was a -- there was a man Bergman(ph) he was also from the ghetto.\nHe was a Kapo. He was nice to me. He was already with our group but he was an\nintelligent person and these in the was a leader in the Gestapo and he raised his\nhand. He spoke fluent German. You are going to be in charge and make group and make\nthe groups together and to tell for the people. And we had a number. This number is\ngoing with this one, and we are going to this field to work. It was an empty field. There\nwas nothing there. It was completely flat. We going to start from scratch and tell us what\nto do. And everybody have to take is a shovel and start digging. We are organized\nalready before us and there were some spots already built. And this was the work we are\ngoing to do and we work the whole day. And we didn't know what we are doing. And\nthey come with machinery and bulldozers, bulldozers and building up a mountain and we\ncouldn't understand why they building a mountain. There was fog in this area, and for a\nwhile you could see and they build a mountain and they have a plan what to do. They\ngoing to make a bunker. How you going to make a bunker from a mountain? They make\nit maybe to be two-mile long and quarter wide and this was our job there. Our job to put\nin with the 73 sand and bring it in and coming with bulldozers we create a\nmountain.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: Right. They are building up, of course, coming in with big train and filling 1t up and\nsoften up and build. You go up the mountain and then when this was done, they put like a\nlittle layer of grass and put in sticks, metal sticks. All that was maybe a mile was metal\nthat was maybe two or three foot long, all over. You couldn't pass by and then in the\nmachinery on each side of the mountain of the and start putting in cement and\nthere was machinery coming in with for other camp. And we had to stay with\nand build all this, like stages, like steps and push away the gate then run down.\nThey started from the and they made the gates from wood and, of course, they\ndoing this and filled up the hill and made the other up and build up and they\nbuild up maybe four or five foot ditch, and they cover up the whole mountain with\ncement. And then they came with the machinery and start digging up and move away the\nfarther away and start digging in two or three foot. It was very deep. You could\nsee down. It was 74 like the 15-floor deep in the floor and they started filling up with\ncement again. They made it I would say, the size of this room. I would say about 40 foot\nthick, thick cement all around, fully up to the hill of the mountain. And when they are\ndoing it they made a downstair and made like corridors, and you could walk in the\ncement and they came with bulldozer. Later on they come bury the whole thing in the\nground and from the outside stick out just the mountain and all this cement was built up\nso heavy. They put layers of grass and then when you looked at this, it look like a\nmountain, like a normal hill. Only sometimes we are were doing this type of work and we\nhad the Jewish -- this was really like we have the Jewish system -- it was really the time\npeople used to fall in the cement and never came out. And I think hundreds of people\nburied. Almost I fall 1n there but I was lucky this time again and wasn't working there.\nAnd my father was falling a lot because the work was so hard and stinking in the night\ntime, and from the cement and the powder and the water, and I can't even explain, and it\nwas going on. I can't even explain the way it was working. It is like you see a factory\nwith machines and not stopping, and it was going on and people dying. The guards would\nsay, give an 75 example, a hundred people from my group. Two is missing all the time.\nEvery day was dead people there. And there was the work we are doing there and when\nwe had the mountain down. And this and they came to start from the beginning and came\nwith machinery and dig out the inside and made another empty stadium answer inside,\nlike you see the dome where they play the football. That's the way it looked inside from\nthe ground. But before this was going on there was work I had to do. It was work we\nhave to going on constant until the end of liberation. It was not completely\nfinished. I am giving the picture of the way this is building it, and I was working with my\nfather there at this time. And there was a German that was in charge of our group, but\nsomehow I was away, say I was lucky. I was never lazy. It just like the way I was, work.\nBut I was watching him. He wasn't watching me. It was survival and my brother not so\nwatchful, always get a little and all this. But in the time we were working there,\nwe been through a lot of experiences. But to start with the experience that I will begin\nwith is we were working there one day. I was going out to work and there was a\nI men, already a Jewish man. He was putting together the groups. There was a\nman, a 76 German, came out and said, who speaks good German? I didn't speak so well\nGerman but I figure I raise my hand. You speak German? I got a job for you. He said I\nshould take this briefcase and come in there, and you going to have a job. You\ngoing to be the fire. You going to put fire in the ovens for the soldiers. They had maybe\n15 little boxes and had three or four soldiers which can go inside and warm up the hands.\nWe work also in the wintertime there. But doing this I felt a little bit free. I could go and\nafter bringing coals for the -- when I left my father and brother working on this bunker\nthat they were working. And one day my father came and they almost killed me. The\nsame German that was nice, my father told -- he told my father, he told me to leave the\njob. Nothing like this. Anyway, there was my father he was beaten up because I have left\nthe place. It was not his fault. It was not my fault. I lucky to get a better job. In this job I\nwas doing I was constantly going out and getting fire for the soldiers, putting in fire for\nthe ovens for the soldiers are and just by doing this I had a little bit there was\nsoldiers all around the area, and nobody was in back of -- he says I use today. Go and\ntake a bag and fill up the bag with coal and go back 77 with the coal. And meanwhile, I\npass by the place they were building the bunker and without a guard, and by doing this I\nwas putting the fire in the ovens. There was a lot of Germans used to peeling potatos, of\napple or something, and used to go into my pocket. But I didn't have the heart to eat it,\nand I used to always feel like I have a duty to give the food to my father and my brother\nbecause I had it much easier than they did. And this was going on for quite a while. I was\ndoing this type of work, but in the time this experience I had one day a German came to\nme come we me. Take my briefcase case and come with me. You come with me.\nThey took me out and I was going maybe for a mile, and this time the war was coming\nclose. Airplanes were coming to bomb Germany and this was the time of -- it was still a\nlong time for me. I thought it would never end. But really the Americans were getting\ninvolved already and bombing Berlin. And this German, I was walking with him and all\nof a sudden these two airplanes, these MIGS, it was two MIGS, MIGS or something,\nAmericans. They came so low because it was so empty at the -- came down with\nmachine, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta and on me and this German. And he was a big German and I don't\nknow, he had a big -- he was not maybe they had so many 78 titles but I don't\nknow. He was a big man too, and he was going to mail something. He thought maybe I\nwas going to -- I was going around and said to put the coals. Now, you go with me and he\nsaid to go with him. I go with him and take this briefcase when the airplanes came on us,\nthere was no way. There was a little tree far away, but this was nothing. They were\nbuilding -- they are building for to land for airplanes in the bunker. And then he said to\nme, stay still. And he just took his hat and the airplane go by and he took off his hat, and\ntook off his hat. He throw this on the ground and lay on his back and head to the side.\nAnd I thought he was dead. He's dead. I really thought he was dead. But he was not dead,\nbut then the airplane passed by. He said he talked to me to stay straight. You\nshouldn't move. You can look up if you want to see the airplane. He was so smart, but\nairplanes came down again and they saw him laying down and they raised up and stopped\nshooting. They raised up and they disappeared. Then I stand up and I am smarter than\nthem. He noticed it was . He could be dead. He was lucky that he didn't get a\nbullet. If he would be dead, I would not be alive either. This was one was experience.\nHowever, I will tell another experience. I was 79 walking around with another German\nsoldier and he was from the Wehrmacht, and he walked over to me one day. You thought\nI look like his brother. He was blonde with blue eyes, beautiful young man. I see\nnice man. He was a good looking man and I looked up at him. And he was so uniform --\nhe was not in SS. he was from the Wehrmacht, from the soldier, and then ghetto. I look\nlike his brother and he was on duty and he was guiding the people. They were walking\nand every group had a soldier to watch them, and everyone had a Meister soldier to\nwatch them and there was a Meister, the people that give you the orders to every day. I\nhave duty. I will give you a leave it and you pick it up, and this can't be a\nGerman. Was a good person, a good man but this was one was going on for a while and\nthen one day raid and this time we were walking there, and it was also full of the\nbunker they are building. A little farther away was like wood and one of us was going to\nthe truck and it was muddy and you go in muck. And I sat in this area I looked for my\nfather all the time and my brother. And every time I had something in my pocket and\nbring it to them and they were working in this area, and so bring it to them because they\nwere working in this area. The guard was standing farther away a 80 few other\nwith work other sections. Block number five, six, seven, eight and there were\nanother blocks to make. There was were a few other to make ten, nine, whatever and\nthere more barracks on the other side. Then I happened to be there in that area and all of a\nsudden the the raid was there and everybody had to lay. This good German was\nwith this group. I saw him before. I didn't talk to him so often. I looked like his brother.\nHe gave me a he told me a little bit, about the story, where he came, and I didn't\nknow he was from Germany. He was from or something. He told me a little bit\nabout his family. He don't know where his family is. He complained a little bit and this\nwas the raid. And everybody had to lay down and throw everything down and be still.\nThe airplanes were coming down. They was going down to look like bomb. Knew\nnothing, we were not too far away from Munich. This was not bombing. They was going\nto Berlin. Everybody lay down. There was a Jewish group, most of them were Jewish. I\nwas not in this group but I have to lay down at this, if I am and this German was a good\nGerman. And there was a few other soldiers and this good German, and a few other\nsoldiers standing there. And he was not sitting down on the ground. He was 81 standing\nnicely and leaning against a tree and the airplanes making noises, and all of a sudden the\nnoises stop and noises and then, all of stop. You have to wait, not to move until the noise\ncomes back. Then because the raid is over, when they pass by they can make you are\neven signals at a couple miles away. And they start working again. And then raid\nwas going on one. Men felt uncomfortable maybe going to 50 foot from one end to the\nother, start calling to go on the other side. My good friend took out a pistol and shot him\nright in the head and his head blow off. He had a bullet, and everybody gets\nfrightened. And I remember I was a little farther away from me but the blood was all\nover, and there was a drop of blood on me, a mark, my stomach. Oh, my God, I am going\nto be alive. It was a nice German and all of a sudden. The raid it is over and\neverybody stand up to go back to the place they work. I didn't see him the second day\nlater. I was supposed to come again because it was maybe going on for a month or\nsomething. Everything time there a piece of bread, whatever, cheese. The next day I was\nafraid to go over and pick it up, but I felt I was not I was a young fellow. I didn't have\nhad no, couldn't say. I was an intelligent person, so many schools and years, 82 but I\nlearned to be a human being before the war start. Wait a second. If I am not going to go\nto him he might shoot me or whatever, might shoot. And I had the going on -- he was\nnever there. When I put the wood and some of the __ said if I met him, you\nknow, I play dumb. Why? Should I? You, this swine is this pig. You know, he could kill\nus. All because of him we be bumped from the Americans two mile in the air. There were\nyou put up aluminium foil against raid. And anyway, I lost me a couple days but he was\nI was going a couple days and -- army we used to keep the solders not too often.\nThere was a couple and they was going and then this from there. Then I had the\nexperience they used to come in the camp and they putting the woman to works in the\narea and in our camp. They want the woman for the other camp and they were working\nthe kitchens there and cleaning for the soldiers and also working other places. The older\nlady with no hair look like boy and uniforms, and they used to make get a shower. Once\nin a while they build a nice -- 1t was a barrack but it was better than the first one. And\nthey had a little corridor and they were so even in a working camp. They put in\nthe people in the shower and most of them then we were all men and some men had a 83\ndesire, and they put a woman undressed, completely naked and she would going and\nmaneuver the water to make the water, to turn on the water. And there I was afraid. I was\nalive but some people were still 1n the -- men have a desire for a woman. You could see\nin the part, and have a desire and they would come in with a raincoat and came in with a\nstick and right, smacking the people on the part, and it was painful and some of them\ndied. Some of them pulled them out dead. Until they found out this the Jewish\nman was the leader. Some of them not coming to work they kill about 155 people that I\nremember. They thought this was none.",
        "A: I saw it. I was there. Took a man and German man walked over and knocked him right\nover the part and passed out. And some of them, you know, come back to the bleeding\nagain, and some of this -- then they start playing around with the water, hot water, cold\nwater, and hot water, that this working camp. And it is a distinct -- and I had another\nexperience. In the same camp was mixed. They brought other people to work there,\nJewish people too, not too many and there came a -- police came from the I\ndon't know exactly. He was from Hungary or something. He came 84 in later and he\nsomehow had brought in a cross, you know, and people were sleeping. Before this\nbarrack was made out of wood, dig out a ditch, like this side come down like this, and\nwas ground and put the -- we didn't have straw. Didn't have a pillow and gave us a\nblanket to wrap up, blanket with straw, and this was our pillows. And this police was, of\ncourse -- a mahogany cross -- and it was this size with Jewish and fancy with a chain, and\nhe used to tell me story from the bible and he was a very learned person. We talked about\nthe Jewish religion Jewish and Christian religion. Somehow at this time we are suffering,\nwe all recall it was no different. I think, I think, the make is different but we all\nthe same people. And then he said to me and this barrack this man that was involved with\nthe for the work. He said that we should work three shifts. We should work eight\nhours and constantly working over there, day or night and sometimes in the day shift and\nsometimes in the middle shift, and sometimes I was in the night shift and the work after\nthe job, and one -- 1t was a Sunday this time -- and I came from the night shift, come in\nthe day shift, you know, to switch around. And I was another time I used to go away he\nsaid to me always, he called me Israel will you put this 85 away? And I dug out\nwith my hand a little hole and I keep this tied together and put it in a little straw\nuntil -- it was my -- I didn't care. Respect was having. Didn't bother me. He was with us\nmaybe a month or two months. They were switching around people from the barracks.\nMy brother and father was there too in the barrack, and then they took my father to a\ndifferent barrack and then they try to switch around barracks, together but the\npriest used to hide. It was a Sunday. I came from the day shift to start working for night\nand from day shift and we had to switch around shifts, but anyway, he put on the cross\nand there used to be a gentile people and make a mess for the gentile people and he was\ngoing to the -- he was going to the I said the ditch but we never -- it was snowing\noutside. It was like cold. We were there. It was raining and wet snow and it was really\nsnowing, and we walked out with this. I could hear scream and halt, halt, halt, because he\nwas close, but I didn't -- stop, stop, stop. Anyway, we heard scream and we hear shooting\nand, of course, there was a little window to look out and we keep going to the ditch to the\nwindow. There was this priest and the Germans and the soldiers around the camp, and\nthere was the like they were 86 watching like in a prison and they told him to\nstop, stop. And going out for the soldiers they could go in the camp for a second. There\nwere doors. They could open form them. For us they couldn't. And they walked in and he\nsaid he said, he made a noise. It was so quiet this time. It was snowing and they\ndropped him and they put him right away from the rifle and took him in the headquarters.\nMaybe a half hour later they brought him back to the camp and they said to the -- and\nbrought up a chair and which is go outside to put him in the chair. And it was\nsnowing and cold outside and some of them came from work. I just came from work. I\nwas wet and tired. Even I did my work not so bad but come back from working to the\nbarracks you get wet, you don't get an umbrella. Everybody had to go out and everybody\nhave to go out. There was people in this camp and one of the Germans put a chair and\nstand on the chair. I'm going to show you what Gods can do for you, and put the priest in\nthe chair. And everybody had to go by and spit on him and then one of the Germans took\nthis, this cross, opened up his mouth and turned it around and keeps -- everybody,\neveryone to go one turn. I made second turn. The man was already half dead and the first\ntime I went by, \"Hi\" to me 87 because I was think it was a miracle. I didn't know the\nGermans were so how come? They took the cross in his mouth and put it in his\nmouth and even bleeding to death, you know, and then one, the Germans there was what\nis going to happen to you? You believe in this God? You Jews are nothing. We are not\npeople at all. Every -- there was not too many and we -- this, this what you can expect.\nAnd we saw this and a lot of Jews coming from their shift and still working and we had a\nfeeling we would never survive. They do it even not to Jewish people. This is an\nexperience I had. I had another experience my brother, rest in peace. I was going with the\ncoals and they choose my brother to take the canister and go to the kitchen to bring the\nsoup for the group that were working. And there was a tall man. He was a tall man. My\nbrother was compared to the men, he was not so tall. We would not survive if we were\nlittle bit. He was shorter than the other guy and this guy was maybe 6'2\" and my brother\nwas 5'8\" and lucky because this was survival, because we were not too little. And he\nwent out to get the soup for the men to eat, and it was snowing and the weather was damp\nand wet and there was tracks going in from the trains where they were working. I -- it's\nhard to make a picture, what was going on. 88 Unbelievable things. Barracks with\nmachine and all kind of machinery was standing there, and you had to go to a factory.\nThere was building with a big thing, and my brother went to the kitchen like it and I was\nthere walking around, not too far away, because there was the oven, the wood to put in\nthe for soldiers, because they were guarding them, and I saw my brother going. I was\nhappy he got -- at least he have an easier job then. I was working hard too. The coals\nwere so heavy I thought I'd die. I couldn't pick it up sometimes. I was afraid not enough\ncoals, afraid not enough coal, and a few times the Germans said there was what you are\ntaking and smack a kick and all this stuff. They were not so gentle to me. I got beat up\nmore than one time. I took it, with somebody on your back all the time. And my brother\nwalked over to the -- not to too far away from the place that have to bring the soup. It\nwas a canister and it was wintertime and it was snowing. It was wet and this can slided,\nand he was short and it slide right on him, and the can kicked him over. And he fall down\nand this on up the gate and this soup spill on the ground. This the this German\nand my father was not run over to me, got this metal. This pipe, it was maybe about six,\nseven foot long and they gave it 89 right on my brother on the back one time. The second\ntime he turned away, only he collapsed. He was laying there and they said you it\nwas not his fault. He stepped in the truck rail from the truck and he fall down. And of\ncourse, I was there and the people and they run over to him, and I drop my sack of coals\nand my father, father said my brother's dead, he's dead. I feel bad about him\nbecause I was lucky. And he comes up, blood from the mouth, and we thought he was\ndying. He finished. But he survive and my father try to pick him up. And these Germans,\nwhat are you doing? Here, I said. I am taking the coal and this my father and brother. But\nthere was other German, so it's okay. They made another group to pick up the soup\nbecause there was enough -- not soup. It was water, and my father and I couldn't stay\nthere, and I see my brother start talking and I see he was going to be okay. And they\nwiping off the blood and he made it. And he had to make believe he was walking, and\nthey came back, go back to the camp. I wasn't going back to the camp, of course. I went\nin the barrack so I couldn't -- we didn't know what happened to him. This Dr. there\ntime was physician for the camp, and my father was -- I was mentioning that he had a\ncyst on his foot, and 90 he operated on him. And it was in the camp, sort of like a\nfirst aid, but I want to -- my brother was not anymore him. He was really weak but he had\nto fight and somehow he was going to come to -- it's going to come to a head. We saw the\nairplanes and the whole thing going on and we felt make we have a chance. Who knows\u2019?\nThis was going on for quite a while but when I was walking, making the coals, I was\nsomething to tell. You have to hear this. There was a wagon, a train standing outside with\n-- the guards were there. As and German came in again from the other camp, you\nknow, and he was a big man. He was a he all of sudden came. We found out he\ncame from Auschwitz and he was going to be in charge of soldiers, not over us. And he\ncame in and said he didn't make the this Bergman moved around, you know.\nAnd who is this, explained him over the face and the men from the also German a\nlittle higher from him came out, and there was a fight and beat up this Jew, he work for\nme. Anyway, they settle with each other and this German and the to make the fire.\nIt got his own no soldiers there. I came in one time to make the fire on the stove\ndid I know who he was? Stillin \u2018if I have with -- he told me if I was in\nAuschwitz, you wouldn't 91 be alive. And he start doing what he did in Auschwitz. He\ntold me the way they was burning the people. He was not it took. Mentioning one\ntime and show it to me and they put the people in there and put them on fire and he had a\nsatisfaction. And one was working, not a murderer. You could see on his face. Maybe he\nwas wounded or something in Auschwitz and the Auschwitz looked like it was\nliquidated. It was before they put him in our camp and when I was -- I was to make warm\nfor him. One time he said I should take his plate and 1t wash out and cook him some\nsoup. it was like a soup the soldiers had. I go outside. There was a train. I took\nthis sand and wiped it out in this bucket. I made it look like a mirror and I came back.\nAnd he said, how come this so clean? I said -- I told him the way I did it. I took the sand\nand washed it out. I put the soup in. He told me what to do. Put in a cup of water\nand I did what he said and I start putting fire in his -- he and we start cooking. Putting the\nfire in this oven and we start cooking. We start cooking it has to boil. Where is your can?\nI had a can always on to my -- I had a spoon. He said to me, take a little bit first. I should\neat of -- its hot. First eat and I almost burned my tongue and 92 I took it in the mouth and\nhe said know it's safe, like I didn't put in any poison or something. Meanwhile, I\nbought maybe three or four pots of the soup and he didn't want me to be there when he\nwas eating. And I came out and later on I came in washed the thing and I didn't see him. I\ntake off my little hat that I had and that's when any time I used to go to the bath\nand take off my jacket. When I had my uniform and put it by the ovenandifIhada |\nthey would die. But one day a man got crazy. Also from the camp and he worked in this\ntrain and started crying about -- the toot, toot, toot and one German soldiers asked, where\nyou going? He was going to Budapest. He was from -- he was going to Budapest and see\nhis wife and child. And somehow he went into him the soldiers were the big they\nhave rapport with him that everything was going on, and he try to escape and he was in\ncharge, the guard. Then the soldiers walked in and I was not there, and he looked like he\nand I was in there and he came out and to me I should go to back.\nMaybe he got something against. He think I did something wrong. There was a big kettle\npot twice as big as this table, heavy. Fill with water effort. There was a pump where the\ntrain, and where the train is filled up with 93 the water. I could hardly take it up. He said\nto me you I don't want to say you dirty dog. Take the kettle and put it on\nthe fire, and he force me to sit close and blow it. I took off my shirt so the water would\ncook fast. Realized the man outside. That I -- for a second I didn't know what they -- and\nI hear this man in the train. I thought he worked there. I didn't know he was crazy. The\nwater was boiling, really cooking. He said I should take it off from the oven. He pushed\nme away and strong like a lion and put took some rags and he took some rags there, was\nputting the boot and took the water and put it on the ground and he said to me if\nyou want to help no, I shouldn't help. He strong like a dog and he open the door,\nhold the door open, hold the little door open and he shove the man away about 10 feet,\naway from me, and the man was sitting in the train, toot, toot, toot, screaming. I go to\nBudapest. I realize he was not normal and he took this hot kettle and he walked over to\nhim so polite and said to him my friend, my brother, where were you going? And\nthe man said, I'm going to Budapest and to my family, and I will help you, and put up the\nkettle and raised it up like a helmet and right over the head and the water right over the\nhead and spilt it. The 94 water was still rolling around and he had very little clothes on\nanyway and the clothes came off of him, of his skin and he got red like a fire, and he was\nin pain. He was running. He didn't know where he was running and screaming and\nhave and he was and there was also the was a\nplace where the people get hurt on the job. There was a Jewish doctor, forget his name,\nbut he used to be a and he said he was running there, and he collapsed and\nyou know, he put him in this little and the doctor couldn't do nothing. The doctor\ngot out but when I came back hours later to put in the coals for the doctor also, because\nhe was there and I saw blood on the rail, window and scrape from the nail and the\nfingernails were hanging on the wood. He died from pain. It was what I saw they did to\nthe man. He wanted to go to Budapest.",
        "A: Right when the camp was going to be liquidated they said we have to go back to Dachau.\nSome people still remain in the camp but people who still capable to go, you know. They\nsaid they going to treat us, to switch us around with Sweden and ___ take. German told\n95 stories. from the into Dachau took maybe but a day, and my brother\nwas very sick already and he was beaten up, and stomach and bleeding from his mouth.\nHe held on and when we came to Dachau -- I had some wooden shoes and I couldn't\nmake it in the snow. My knees start getting numb and we came in the Dachau I saw the\nchimney. Lots people there, thousands of people, trains and all this and some people\nremain like in a race. And we go in the group. We were talking about we stay that\novernight, but we are in the group. We stay overnight and the morning I lay down on the\nthe place and I couldn't see nothing. I said to my father, I can't walk\nanymore. I can't move my knee and my father said to me if you can't walk they're\nare going to shoot you. That's what they are doing to the people. And somehow I fall\nasleep. And my brother was sick and father was also not so from working, you know, and\nhe was a and again, but again there was a raid and the Americans bomb again, a\nraid and the Americans were bombing -- Munich is not far away from Dachau -- and a\nbomb came in right not too far away from the camp and I just jumped. I hear a bang. I\ndidn't know and I stand up I said to my father, I move my knee and then in the morning --\nit was a little bit in the middle 96 night I could move my knee and in the morning they\ntake it, one, two, we have to go. They tell us have to go and some of them they put in\ntrains. There was not enough trains. They made us walk. We walked Dachau and walked\nthree days. They gave us a can of fruit and they gave us there was meat in there\nfrom the camp, and everybody got a can of some of the food and they came out with a\ndog and they had the dogs were going on other side of the group and were\nmatching from Dachau. This was after Dachau it was after liberation and I was\nliving there and the mountains we came out there. The people are dying\nlike flies, like a lot of people weren't making it. If you walk a little out of the line the dog\nwill grab you and bites you. You can't escape. I had wooden shoes, wooden shoes and I\nlost my shoe. I was running barefoot and it was April. I was liberated 2nd of May, one\no'clock. But we were walking down and people were dying like flies. We didn't know.\nWe thought they're going to kill us, and we came anyway. We come into. \u2014_\u2014sm wee are --\none thing after the war when I was there, we had to stop somewhere and there was a little\n. A woman came out, a German woman, with a hot-cooked meal and gave to the\nsoldiers. I to drink. It was 97 experience I have a little time. I was liberated I\ncame back to this place. But anyway going to this place they put us in a ditch. They put\nmachine guns and we know, there 1s finished. They're are going to kill us there. Luckily,\nthere was a raid again and it start snowing. We are there maybe around 2000 people in\nthe city and it was a whole and -- the snow came. The snow was so heavy we couldn't\nsee. We were snowed in. In the morning I came out from the snow and I looked. I\ncouldn't see my father. That's my father. I didn't see him. He was there and my brother\nand all of you had -- people start coming up and there was one soldier standing on the\nhill. All the machine guns, everything is going on. He answer. The leader, he\nsaid the Germans are going, and he show a little town a half kilometer, white flags\nhanging over the houses. And we felt something going on. And all thought was burning\nand machine guns and military going. And anyway, there was a dead horse -- but I can\ntell stories. People were so hungry they were eating the dead horse. I didn't eat the dead\nhorse. And we were walking into this little town and the Germans were there in the small\ntown and we walked in. And everybody, you go here, and they go there, here, sort of like\nin the like they have it in the 98 farms, little town. And there was boys in this\nhouse and things like this, and the woman was watching the house and sitting. She offer\nus to -- she don't know -- for us to eat or something. But they were afraid. We were\nafraid. We didn't know what was going on. We, finally, maybe 20 people in this place\nwhere the cows -- around one o'clock we hear people screaming. We go out. I say\nAmerican -- I saw 1s a white star. I didn't know what was Russians or what ever and\npeople running in the in to the place. The Americans are throwing disaster. There\nwas a-- people usedtoeat _\u2014_\u2014. I gota can of and a soldier opened up for me and\nI eat like I didn't have nothing to eat. And then the Americans came in and, of course,\nright away they said to remain where we are. And the next day all the people should get\nout of this place and we go to a place about two kilometers to the barracks where the\nGermans from the Navy and the soldiers. They it out and you'll the people that\nwere liberated put us over there. And in four days we were leaving. They put in the white\nflags. A train go by and it opened up the and the men said it was a rabbi\n, a priest, oh, what did they did to my people? And he felt so bad and he should not\nshoot, but he felt so 99 bad he took the machine gun and shot the first floor -- and look\nwhat they did to my people? I never forget this moment. It always stay with me and that's\nwhy I thank the Americans I am alive, everyone. We went down and this was the end of\nit. I didn't know what was happening. And we walked in this building and, of course,\nright away there were soldiers from the doctor and they start checking out the people and\nsoon my brother, they took him right away from us, and right away from us. She said --\nwe show him the way he acting, and right away he have to go right away in the hospital.",

And then we were liberate and my brother\nwas taken to the hospital, and then they was in the hospital and they tried to cure\nhim but he lost a kidney. And then he had TB in his foot and he couldn't move. And after\nthe liberation there was six years in the hospital. And everybody was already free and I\nwas at this time a young man.
