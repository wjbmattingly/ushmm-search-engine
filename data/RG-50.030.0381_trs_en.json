They spoke Polish all the time, and so was\nGenta. But he learned by himself. When he has 21, he said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d It\u2019s interesting that the\nleaders, the Bundist leaders, the children never spoke Yiddish. Even the Erlich and Arthur (ph), you\nknow who they are, they were the great leaders of the Bund, both of them were killed by the\nRussians during the war, in 1941. Arthur (ph) was an engineer, and Erlich, his two sons, were here.\nVictor (ph), he is a professor at Yale, and the children never spoke Yiddish. It was very interesting.\nOf course, they were sent to the best schools, to gimnazjums, this and that. So this is why Michal\ndidn\u2019t speak Yiddish at all.\nAnd he never even spoke Yiddish because he was afraid that he will, that he, that he will make\nmistakes and he didn\u2019t want to make any mistakes, so but he could read. In the end, he could read.\nIn the end, he could read.",
        "Q: Did you sometimes speak Yiddish between each other?",
        "A: Michal and I? No, no, never. I likely spoke to -- started to speak Irene Polish, you know, not\nYiddish, she didn\u2019t know a word of Yiddish. She started to learn Yiddish here in the States, yeah,\nnot before. Because in Sweden, also, you know -- I\u2019m Swedish and Polish. This is how we spoke to\n[inaudible].",
        "Q: So what is happening in your life between 1937 and 1939? Are the two of you thinking about the\nwar possibly coming there, or --",
        "A: We wanted to come, 1939 was the World Fair in the States and we intended to come at that time.\nBut, we were a little late because he had an aunt here, too. His mother\u2019s sister. One was in Paris and\nthe other one was here. And we intended to come to the Worlds\u2019 Fair, it started in September, and\nhe for some reasons couldn\u2019t make it, you know. I don\u2019t know if it was exams or registration or\nwhatever it was, because he finished Politechnikum in 1939. Because he was also working, you\nknow, with being married is, is to support a wife. So, he -- we intended to come but for some\nreason, we were late. If we would have come at that time, he wouldn\u2019t be dead, you know? He\nwould stay here. But we were late.",
        "Q: Were you intending to come to the United States just for the Worlds\u2019 Fair, just a vacation?",
        "A: Just for, he would never leave, you know, he had to fight, fight for a better Poland, for the\nrighteous, you know, those kinds of things. He would never leave Poland at that time, thinking, you\nknow, what happened at that time. He would never leave Poland.",
        "Q: So then the war starts, yeah?",
        "A: Then the war starts, yes.",
        "Q: What is that like? What\u2019s the beginning like for you and your family?",
        "A: It was tragic. Meanwhile, you know, my sisters got married and were out of the house, Genia had\na marvelous husband, Dubnikow, and they had a son, Majus, because he was born, in, in, in the\nmonth of May so they called him Majus, you see. It wasn\u2019t religious business.\nThen Anka was married also, to Bachrach, a marvelous man, he just died 90, being 90 years old. He\nwas writing to the end of his day, this was Bachrach. And they had a daughter, Genia. They went\nthrough Shanghai, came to the States. Guta was married to Bernard Rosenfeld; he was a lawyer, a\nCommunist, and also marvelous man. So well educated, you know? We always had, as much as I\nknow literature, we always had some kind of, you know, games. I always, you know, lost. He was\nalways on top of everything. All kinds of literature and marvelous man. And my brother, who was\nalso married and had a son, before the war. So, everybody was really out, you know. And I was\nmarried, so this is when the war broke out. Was only my young, youngest sister with my mother.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: So \u2014 Krysia, she called her, little Krysia. But everybody took care of the household. And it so\nhappens that on the seventh or eighth of September, it was an order by the mayor, their Warsaw\nmayor, that all the men who were still at the age of military should get out of the city because the\nGermans were coming very close and they\u2019ll take all the men, so better you get out to the east, to\nRussia. The east side of Poland because maybe still the Poland will win the war with the Germans.\nAnd so did Michal and all the husbands. Only the oldest one, Genia and Dubnikow, they went\ntogether; they didn\u2019t leave. Anka stayed and Guta stayed and I stayed and all of them left. They\nwent, Michal left with his two friends. Jerzy Lipszyc was home, he was students, they were students\nstudying together in University. And Mietek Katowicz died, but I met Jerzy when I went with Irene\nto Poland, he came up.\nThey all left, they were all married, but they all left, left their wives. They went to the east side and\nafter a few weeks, maybe a month, may have been six weeks, I don\u2019t know, they all came back.\nMietek Katowicz\u2019s wife was pregnant. Michal came back, I think that Jerzy stayed a while. He was\nstill in London -- he got, his father was a doctor and he was very well off, you know, some kind of\ncontact he had but then he came back. So then, after a few weeks, they came back. Besides, Genia\ndid not come back, Bachrach didn\u2019t come back, but he sent for my sister and the baby somehow.\nPeople were traveling back and forth, you know, through the borders between Russia and Germany,\nback and forth. So Anka left to Vilna, they were in Vilna. Genia was in Dobno, this was Ukrainian,\nand then Guta left with Buziek, so it was her husband, also to the Ukraine. And I stayed, I was there\nand Krysia had a boyfriend and she also left. So when Michal came back, I took my mother to our\nhousehold and we stayed together. That was a very tragic situation at that time. I was sick. First of\nall, they bombarded Warsaw, I was so scared because Michal wasn\u2019t there and we went into the\ncellars and I was so scared to death. I got fever, I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening and Michal wasn\u2019t\nthere. It was very scary! Then suddenly he came back; they decided they cannot leave the wives and\nthey came back. And since then, and then was, you know, and then after a while I got pregnant and -",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: And then also we had to move from our apartment to the ghetto. So, at that time I was already\nvery sick and I was out of action. I was \u2014",
        "Q: What were you sick from?",
        "A: Thyroid because my eyes at that time became permanent, permanent, you know, I never had this\nkind of, this was with the sickness. My heart, I was sick, I was, I was very sick. But this was already\nafter Irene was born.",
        "Q: But you moved to the ghetto in 1940?",
        "A: No, this was already later, a little bit, \u201842, end of \u201840 or \u201841, something like -- because they did it\nin parts, you know. There was a small ghetto, a big ghetto. But at that time, we got tremendous\nroom from somebody they knew, my mo-- mother-in-law and my father-in-law, from people who\nhad a tremendous apartment, six rooms, something like that. And we got about two rooms, it was a\none room later but divided into two rooms over there when she went to Jerska. This is where we all\nlived together.",
        "Q: So now, who was together?",
        "A: My mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my mother, Michal, I, the baby and Genia. For a while also\ncame a sister, another sister, my mother-in-law\u2019s, Guta Schulman (ph). Her husband was also an\neditor in the Folks-tsaytung,\u2019 you know. Very nice man but he died before that. She was for a while\nin our apartment and she was together with my mother-in-law and my mother when the raid came\nand they were taken away. But this was later, already.",
        "Q: Rose, when the war starts, and then they start having decrees about the Jews, yes, and then\nfinally you have to go to the ghetto. What are people talking about? What kind of things?",
        "A: It was a tremendous shock to everybody because the Germans came into the streets, they were\nkilling just like that. They were tearing beards, you know, from the Jews. They were coming at\nnight and taking out people from the houses. There were raids around the few blocks and taking\npeople for work, to do this, to do that.\nBefore they started to take them to concentration camps. All kind of work. It was unbelievable what\nwas going on in the streets. The fear. People didn\u2019t have anything to eat. Immediately the stores\nwould close. The Germans took away everything they could. They came into the stores and into the\nhomes and just like that. Didn\u2019t do anything and it was terrible. There were keys, you know, to\nstand in line, to get something. The, the Jewish, the Judenrat\u00ae -- it wasn\u2019t the Judenrat yet but, you\nknow, the people who worked before in the Judenrat tried to keep everything together. But you\nknow about the story about Czerniak6w, who committed suicide, because they said you have to\ndeliver so and so, many people, for this, this and that. He couldn\u2019t do it because he knew it was for\n\u2019 People\u2019s paper (Yiddish).\n\u00ae Jewish Council (German).\neither camp or that, and he committed suicide. Others stayed, but then Jewish Police came. It was, it\nwas a terrible thing. You can\u2019t even imagine what was going on. And we didn\u2019t have, I know that\nmy mother-in-law was selling and selling and selling what we had. Anything goes! And people\ncame from the Aryan side, they let them in, they paid to the, even Germans were sending them, the\nguards were watching. They came in, they were buying up things. It was a tremendous tragedy,\ntragedy, completely tragic. And then, started to sh -- to sh -- to see that people in the streets, the\nchildren begging, running around. Some didn\u2019t have already any strength to run around. I was a lot\nsick at that time. First of all, I gave birth, you know, and then I started, you know, with my thyroid. I\nwas taken to the hospital.",
        "Q: When did you give birth? It was April 17, 1941?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a few months after the ghetto was sealed, that you\u2019re in the ghetto? And then you get\nsick?",
        "A: I got sick, yeah.",
        "Q: And what happened?",
        "A: I got sick after that, after I gave birth, I got sick. I was afraid what\u2019s going to happen. The stress,\nthyroid, the stress, you know. What will, what will happen happen to Irene, what about this, and\nMichal will be taken away. You just, you live without tomorrow. You saw the next hour, you live.\nAnd this was, was a terrible, the hospital. There was no, when I was operated on, there was no\nantibiotics at all. They cut me all over because I was full of, you know, infection here, full. And it\nwas one millimeter from my main vein and the doctor, Arik Heller, as I spoke, is in Sweden now, he\nwas at the operation. He was altogether, so that I am a miracle that I am alive. But this was, Irene\nwas about at that time a few months old. It was a terrible, you didn\u2019t know what tomorrow will\nbring. The raids were tremendous. They, they surrounded, you know, blocks and blocks and you\ncouldn\u2019t get out and everybody, the old people went, one side to the camps. The young ones went\nhere. They were, you couldn\u2019t even figure out what\u2019s going to happen. What should I do? Nobody\nknew. We, we knew one thing, we were all going to perish.",
        "Q: You knew that?",
        "A: Was going on everyday. They come up, you know, Michal was constantly running to the\nunderground, everyday. And keeping with them, what\u2019s going on and so on. The first thing he came\nback, I said, \u201cWhat about England? What about America? Did you hear anything? They\u2019re not\ngoing to help?\u201d That was all... We were all surprised. So this 1s, it was a tragic, it was a very tragic\ntime. They were killing and killing and killing. And more and more dead, in the streets. Constantly.\nAnd raids and then the Judenrat started to try to get a little organized and the Jewish Militia came\nand they were, they were so corrupted.\nBecause they said, \u201cIf you bring a certain amount of Jews, your family will stay alive.\u201d You know,\nthe oldest tricks. They believed in it, and they brought -- nothing helped. There were a few, you\nknow, the Bund underground killed a few policeman for that. One policeman helped us, but he was\nonce a Bundist and became a policeman, you know. They were also going, but this was later\nalready, towards the end. Umschlagplatz.\u2019 Michal holding Irene and I. If you want to hear it now,\nPll tell you, how they raided, you know? But this was the period of --",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: So, this is, and then when I was in the, in the hospital at that time, it wasn\u2019t a hospital, it was the,\nthe, the Pen Club, a tremendous apartment there and they made it a hospital in the ghetto. As I told\nyou, they didn\u2019t have any medications but they had to operate on me. And I was lying in the room\nfor the nurses, which is as, as narrow as this is, you know, but they put a cot there for me so I\nwouldn\u2019t be with all these people and the doctors came to me there, you know, too. There came a\nday when they said that they are going to take away the hospitals and my doctors were the best of\nthe surgeons in Warsaw because of the nurses and Gina, you know, knew them and she wanted\nthem to operate on me. They were taken the night before from their houses, away, and never heard\nof them bef-- later on. And the next day, the whole hospital will be evacuated, with the sick, you\nknow, to get away with them. So Gina and Michal came the day before and they put, we were on\nthe third floor, they put their hands like that, they put their hands and brought me up to the house at\nthat time.",
        "Q: What, what month is that? Do you have any --",
        "A: The 22nd of July.",
        "Q: Oh my! The beginning of the deportation.",
        "A: My birthday.",
        "Q: That\u2019s your birthday?",
        "A: The 22nd of July, this is the biggest evacuation for Treblinka. This is started the 22nd of July.",
        "Q: So are you in the hospital May and June, after, after the birth of Irene?",
        "A: Later.\n? Deportation area in the ghetto (German).",
        "Q: For a couple of months, or later?",
        "A: Later. Irene was born in April, yeah. This 1s, this is when it was, yeah. This is when it was.",
        "Q: Okay, all right. Let\u2019s take a break now.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll start with your --\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "Q: Rose, before we start with after you came out of the hospital, July 20th or 21st 1942, I wanted\nto ask you some questions about that.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Was there an argument in your family about whether you should learn the Polish language\nand where you should learn it?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a matter of learning my Polish languages, it came naturally from the moment I was\nborn and raised, we spoke Polish, you know. It was the parents spoke Yiddish. But the main,\nreally, conversations was among us, it was always in Polish. And when I went to school, I was\nsuppose to go to school, there was a, there was a question. Should I go to a Folkshule,'? which\nwas in Yiddish, or should I go to a public school in Polish? And my sister, the oldest one, was a\nteacher herself. Said, absolutely to the Polish school, because I don\u2019t want her to go into the\nstreet and be afraid that somebody\u2019s going to beat her up when she speaks Yiddish. And this was\nthe general atmosphere, you know. But some people, the Folkshule was very popular among the\nworkers, you know, the Bundists particular. There was also the Poale Zion schools in Yiddish.\nNellie\u2019s (ph) mother was the teacher in the Poale Zion, but in my family they said, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d\nmy sister said, the oldest one, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d And my mother and father, you know, went\nalong with my sister, you know. She was a teacher, she knew what\u2019s going on in the, in the\nschools and so on, and I went to a public school in Polish. Because this was if you speak\nYiddish, you know, you are always in risk. And they didn\u2019t want me to have this as a main\nlanguage.\n'0 Elementary school (Yiddish).",
        "Q: When, when you were working in the library, you were given an assignment to create a list of\n100 books. Could you tell us that story?",
        "A: Yes. As I told you before, I was cataloging, and, you know, putting in categories different\nbooks. And the workers came and, and always ask, \u201cCould you give me a good book, something\nto read?\u201d And when I spoke to the director of the library, he said to me, \u201cRozka, why won\u2019t you\nwrite out a list of 100 books so when the people come in and want to take a book out, they could\nsee the list, what they should take.\u201d\nAnd I decided to do that. So, I put down a list of 103 books I know exactly, from different\ncategories, categories and countries. And there was the Scandinavian countries and American\nliterature and, of course, Polish literature, French, all kind. Everything in translation, of course,\ninto Polish, not in the original languages. So I put down a list of 103 books, and Russian\nliterature was a very, very modern at the time, to read the Russian, the Russian literature\ntranslated into Polish. And I went to Mrs. Dobnow. Erlich. Dobnow was the daughter of the\nfamous historian Dubnow, wrote the history of the Jews. And she was herself a poet. She was\nwriting poetry in still Russian and knew excellent Polish literature -- altogether a very intelligent\nand very well educated. His two sons were professors, one of Columbia and the one is who\npassed away and the one is in Yale. And she was there, I made an appointment with her, and I\nsaid, \u201cMrs. Dubnow, I want to come and have your opinion,\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to rely on\nmyself, that this is right. So I left with her the list of 100 books and she studied it. Then she, I\ncalled her, and she said, \u201cWould you come up? Let\u2019s have a discussion about it.\u201d\u201d And there she\naccepted the 100 books, but one which was called, Cztowiek Zmienia S\u2019ku\u2019re.'! In English, it\n'l Bruno Jasienski\u2019s book\u2019s English title is A Man Changes His Skin.\nwould be \u201ca person changes his skin.\u201d It means that becoming \u2014 changing his ideas, his ideology.\nThis is what it means, that a person changes his skin. She didn\u2019t want to put it in. She didn\u2019t want\n\u2014 she was a little bit, you know... She was a Bundist, but she didn\u2019t want to start with the\nCommunists. This was my feeling at that time, as young as I was. And I felt it should be there.\nAnd we had a big discussion about it. And she told me, \"If you feel so strongly about it, let\u2019s\nleave it.\u201d It was written by Bruno Jasienski, who was a Communist once and he -- who believed\nin Christ that have to help people and so on. The funniest this was when I came to the United\nStates, and I came to visit her, so she says to me, \u201cIf you feel so strongly about it, let's leave it.\u201d\nThe funniest thing was when I came to the United States and I came to visit her. So she says to\nme, \u201cRozka, I remember how you argued with me about that book, that we had the discussion\nabout that book.\u201d I was beside myself. How could she remember such a stupid thing and the\nkhutspe\u2019\u201d of me, you know, to argue with her when she says let's take it out. I had three other\nbooks in case, but this was -- I was glad that she remembered.",
        "Q: So you did leave it in?",
        "A: True, yeah. She says, \u201cIf you feel so strongly about it.\u201d She let me in [indecipherable].\nNothing would happen, but she wanted to make her point and -- and I -- I stood up, you know, by\nthat.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about Michal, this is before the war, and your\nrelationships. You -- you used to help him with his homework?",
        "A: You see, they have projects for their exams, to make a project -- he was an engineer. And they\nmade -- a mechanical engineer, you know. They used to make all kind of machines and what is it\ncalled, what they have at when they build, you know the -- the buildings and they have the big...",
        "Q: A crane?",
        "A: The cranes, yeah. The cranes, you know. All kind of things which is connected with force,\nwith you know, pressure, so on, so on. And he used to make on big paper, he used to make all\n'2 Gall or nerve (Yiddish).\nthis kind of drawings. But he made it in pencil and this had to be done in -- in -- in ink. So when\nhe did it -- I was very scrupulous, you know, very always detailed. So he said, \u201cWhy don't you\ndo it in ink, because I have to do, I have to study for my exam,\u201d or something like that. And I did\nit. So I was working very diligently and very accurately and he was very happy about it, he had\nhelp. Other students, who had to work, you know, make a living, they had to give it to\nsomebody, you know. And it-interesting, they were called, you know how? Negroes, \u201cmurzyn\u201d\nin Polish. Because murzyn, murzynowac, it means, you know, to do it in black. This is what they\ncalled it. And they had to pay for that, a lot of money. But I was -- I wasn't paid. But I helped\nhim a lot you know, in that.",
        "Q: Rose, I asked you when you -- when you were growing up, whether you had Polish friends, or\nwhether you were involved in any way and you said no. But, was there a change in your life in\nthat respect when you met Michal?",
        "A: Oh, yes, because Michal was already -- you know, he went at that time to the university and\nhe belonged you know, to the -- to the Bund and they had a very close relationship with the PPS,\nthis is Polska Partia Socjalistyczna.'* This is like the Bund in Jew- in, you know, the Jewish. And\nthis is the Polska, this Polish party, Socjalistyczna. And over there, there was also a sport club\ncalled Skra,'* where you know, the Jutrznia and Skra used to meet. And Gina, Michal's sister,\nhad a lot of friends because she was also an athlete, Gina, in this sport club in Jutrznia and they\nmet -- they had all kind of, you know, sport games together. And she had very close friends in\nthe Polish club. And among them was one Marysia Sawicka, who was a tremendous help to us\nlater on in the -- on the Aryan side in the, you know, when we went out. And Michal also had a\nlot of friends there and he had a contact later on, when he was going out from the ghetto, you\nknow, for ammunition and so on, was the Polish friend from the pepperess. So it wasn't exact --\nat my age at that time, and my contacts wasn't the same as theirs were. And then we were all, you\nknow, we had the very good contact with them and they helped us tremendously.\n'S Polish Socialist Party (Polish).\n'4 Spark (Polish).",
        "Q: W-Were you surprised at his --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Not at all, no. Because we always felt that you know, we have to be brothers, whoever you\nare. Even was a song about it, black and white, you know, all kind of colors, we should be\nbrothers. No, absolutely not. This was our idea, you know, [indecipherable] so.",
        "Q: So in -- not only because it helped you, but you thought it was important that you were be --\nable to have this kind this relationship?",
        "A: Of course, yeah. Of course. And frankly, you know, also when I went to the Aryan side, I\ncont-I contacted a woman whom I knew, a Polish woman and asked her, you know, where to go,\nwhere to be and she helped us also. And there was a place -- friend of Wnorowska, she was a\nseamstress and we used to work there and we used to meet there and even Vladka you know, was\ncoming there also. A lot of people. This was my -- this was my, you know, contribution, this\naddress. Samarch (ph) was a marvelous person. No, on the contrary. But at -- as a child, you\nknow, as a youngster, I didn't have the contact with them. But it wasn't that -- that I would\nseparate.",
        "Q: It was just -- it just was coincidental then?",
        "A: Coincident, that's right, yeah, absolutely.",
        "Q: Okay. When, when we ended the last tape, we ended where you were taken out of the\nhospital by Gina and Michal be-because there was going to be an Aktion!\u00ae and it was the huge\ndeportat -- the beginning of the huge deportations.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you still very sick when they took you?",
        "A: No, I was better already. No, I could walk, you know, I could walk. It was still, you know, I\nwas very weak, but I could walk and I -- not that I could be on my own, but I could walk and I\n'S A military operation taken for military, eugenic, or racial ends (German).\ncould do certain things. But the raids were constantly terrible. And one of the raids, you know,\nwe all would have to come down. Michal got some kind of an Answeiss.'\u00b0 Know what's an\nAnsweiss? It is some kind of a permit from a certain place. This is through the Judenrat, we had\nsomebody there, you know and he got it that he's working here and there, which wasn't true. He\nwasn't working there, but that he's working, he 1s needed as engineer and so on. So -- so we all\nhad to go down and my in-laws and there was her sister also, Guta Schulman (ph), which I said\nand my mother, myself and Irene, holding her, and Michal. We all were standing in the court\nthere, but they said, who has Answeiss could take out his wife, or a child, you know, whatever it\nis. And Michal approached one of these and they let me out with Irene and the rest went -- went\nto the Umschlagplatz and this was my -- my mother was standing with me and I knew this 1s the\nend. I knew this is the end. It was. And we went back upstairs with Irene. Gina wasn't there. Gina\nwas very often, you know, in the Umschlagplatz going with her uniform as a nurse, smuggling\nout people, you know, whom she knew. She wasn't there. And then when she f-found out that our\narea was, you know, raided, she came running and she found us. She was beside herself, you\nknow, her parents were gone and my mother was gone.",
        "Q: Rose, did you know then where they were going?",
        "A: We knew already.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Because there was, yeah. There was a friend of ours, Frydrych, Zygmunt Frydrych. He went\nwith the train, you know, he got attached to the train somehow and he went up to Treblinka. And\nhe saw what's happening and he came back with this, you know, news that everybody's being\ngassed over there. He knew all right. So we knew already. The 22nd of July, we knew already\nwhat it is. There were times when they were promising, you know, before, that we'll give you a\nfew pounds of bread and then t -- something, sugar, or whatever it is and to come, you know, to\n'\u00a9 Permit (German).\nanother place and so the people went for it, they were hungry and they went for that. But we\nknew already.",
        "Q: Had -- had you all heard about the Idzodz (ph) group when, in 1941, when they -- when they\nstarted the war against Russia? That they were -- there were mass shootings, did you hear about\nthat?",
        "A: Of course, we knew already, we knew about it, yeah. We knew about it.",
        "Q: So you knew this was all a death sentence in some way?",
        "A: Oh, we knew, yeah, we knew. And then was the other time, after that -- I was only with --\nwith Michal, you know, Gina and -- and the baby. That's it. Another raid of the building and they\nwere running -- the Jewish policeman, they were running up the -- to look into the apartments,\nwhether somebody was hidden or not. And they would take down, because if still bring people,\nyou know, his family, it will be saved. This is how they brought the people. And we heard it will\nbe decided not to go down, Michal, and to keep Irene quiet, you know. We went in the very far\ncorner of the apartment, they cannot see us and we left the doors open, so they'll see that\nnobody's -- think that nobody's there. And we heard them running up -- there was another floor,\nrunning up and down and opening the doors and heaved around, looked in and I was keeping\nIrene on a table, dressed. We were all dressed to go. I was keeping her on the table and pushing\ninto her mouth, candies, so she cannot ta -- she cannot scream, she cannot talk, she cannot do\nanything. And I was pushing, you know, and pushing in -- into-- into that -- in that, her mouth.\nAnd she didn't -- not a sound. And they just glanced in and -- and went.",
        "Q: They didn't see anything?",
        "A: No, they didn't see us, of course not. And the -- Genia, heard again that. She came in and you\nknow, she was frantic. She started to cry, it's [inaudible].",
        "Q: It must have been terrifying.",
        "A: There is no expression for that. And then -- they know, when we decided -- I'll tell you, this\ncame a point when I couldn't make any more decisions. I didn't have the strength. Michal was\ndoing all the decisions, you know, all the time. I couldn't do that. And it was a raid. This was the\nlast time. And there were columns going the street and we had to go, it was -- it was the column,\nyou know. We couldn't already get out. And there was a wide street there, Zamenhoff Street,\ngoing to the Umschlagplatz. And there was one Jewish militia man, who was once in the Bund, I\nknew him too, Michal knew him, I knew him. And we were in the back, and he came over to us,\nhe was watching that nobody should escape. He came over to us and said, \u201cMichal, go to the\nfront, to the very front and I'll watch.\u201d And somehow, you know, he got to the very -- Michal\nwas carrying Irene and I was walking, you know -- hardly walking, but walking. And we came to\n-- and Michal told me, \u201cYou see on that corner, that Kupieka Street, there is a tremendous,\u201d oh,\nwhat's called? Kiosk, a wi -- a ra -- a round one, but very wide. He said, \u201cWhen we come to that\nkiosk,\u201d I was the first one at the sidewalk, \u201cyou go to the right.\u201d I said, \u201cI'm afr\u201d -- in the back,\nthe Germans were standing and shooting whoever would move, you know, they shoot. I said,\n\u201cMichal, I cannot do that.\u201d He said, \u201cYou're going to do that.\u201d And he gave me, when we came\nto the corner, he gave me such a push and I went to the front of that kiosk, because it was hidden\na little bit, you know, for the column and then Michal came with the baby. And we're standing,\nuntil everybody pass by. It's hard to describe. When they pass by, we cross the street and there\nwas an empty building already. Everything was open. And we hid there for awhile. Then we\npassed, you know, we came home, back. But this was already about two blocks from the\nUmschlagplatz, we go. But if he wouldn't the -- but he made all the decisions at that time, I\ncouldn't any more. And then he decided that we going out, after that. And that we're going to our\nex-mate, who was living in Prague. This is the vistalna, divided you know, Prague like Bronx,\nlet's say, in Manhattan. And she live in there and she was like, you know, in French they have the\nconcierge. So she was taking care of the buildings, cleaning and everything. And she knew\neverybody who comes in and who goes. She had no husband, she has a daughter. But we decided\nto go there. And how we went there, we went with the so-called platzufka (ph). Platzufka was\nthey were collecting people for work in different directions, coming out of the ghetto, going to\nthat place and then coming back. So we took the baby, and you could take the baby that time, to\ndifferent places to work. And we went out and on the other side, on the Aryan side, we stepped\nagain, away from the column in a certain moment.",
        "Q: And did he pick the moment?",
        "A: Always. I never did anything. I was a very passive at that time. I had the baby, I was thinking\nabout the baby, I wasn't too well and -- and so on. He always picked this. He always made all the\ndecis -- since that moment, he made always the -- the -- all -- all the decisions. And -- and we got\n-- we got into a streetcar and went there. When she looked at us, she paled -- she was pale. She\nwas afraid, you know, went there. And we told her that it's only for a few days until we find\nsomething. Didn't have any papers, nothing. We took off all the armbands and this is how we\ndid. In the column, as we were marching, we took off the -- the -- the bands, you know and --\nand this is how we got there. So she said that she'll find, you know -- he was running around with\ndifferent, you know, paper, no paper and said, \u201cI'll get a birth certificate of her sister,\u201d who is in\nGermany, working for the Germans, she was taken by the Germans. So as there is no reason, you\nknow, she wasn't afraid, she went over there. It was in a -- it was a country there, you know, a\nvillage called Gleboczyce and she got me the paper there and she said that I can go there, to this,\nyou know, village and I can stay with so and so. The name of that peasant was Patoka, a tall, old\nman, gray. She was very vivacious with her son and I went there with Irene, I stayed. Michal\ntook me there and he left for Warsaw, he couldn't stay there, Michal couldn't stay there, he\nshouldn't have, because the less people the better. And I was staying there for awhile, this 1s how\nwe got out on the Aryan side. I was staying there for -- for awhile.",
        "Q: How did you get there, did you walk?",
        "A: No, by train.",
        "Q: By train?",
        "A: Yeah, was all a risk. This is all a risk, you know. Every --",
        "Q: Did Michal -- did Michal have papers now too, or not?",
        "A: Not yet.",
        "Q: Not yet.",
        "A: Not yet, yeah. He had the Answeiss, you know, that he is working. This was so he looked as\nan Aryan, so there was no problems and -- no problem, was always a problem. Then one time,\nyou know, one of the workers from his factory met him in the street, they said, \u201cMr. engineer,\nwhat are you doing here?\u201d You know, he knew that he is Jewish. And he gave him shelter later\non, he was selate (ph). This is another story. But this is how we got into the country, you know,\nwith Irene, for a few days, you know. We'd worked there for a few weeks. And...",
        "Q: How were you at that time, during those few weeks? Were -- did Michal come back and\nforth?",
        "A: Yes, yes, he came back for -- back and forth, yeah.",
        "Q: Every few days, or?",
        "A: No, for a week, something like that, he had for a week, but never, you know, he could, he said\n-- he had things to do also, you know in -- in Warsaw. Preparing whatever -- he was very active\nwith the -- with the fighting organization, you know. He was very fight -- he was very active\nthere.",
        "Q: Did you know what he was doing at that time?",
        "A: Not exactly, not exactly. I knew that he is involved, but not exactly, he didn't tell me, you\nknow. So over there, how -- it was interesting. They loved Irene, the little baby and whenever --\nhe sometimes took her on his knee -- the -- the peasant, Mr. Patoka took -- took her on her knee\nand they were eating like, potato balls, you know, made. Take matzo balls, you know potato\nballs. So he took a piece into his mouth, he made it soft and gave it to her. I was looking at it and\nI was dying, you know. But, didn't say a word about it. There was a little wooden thing for them\nto give food to the -- to the pigs, they brought it in. So I washed it, I put in water and I bathed\nIrene. I took her to the fields and I -- I could pick the, what's called? Peas, the green peas in this,\nI took it out and I gave it. I took carrots, I-I grated them, I squeezed out juice to have for her, the\njuice the -- the -- the you know, the carrot juice, some vitamins. And when the -- the woman, the\npeasant, she saw this, she says, \u201cWe give it to the pigs, why do you give it to the baby?\u201d You\nknow, this kind of things, very primitive, but kind. And I think that the soltys, you know what's\nthe soltis, the eldest of the village, who was getting on everything, I think that he guessed who I\nam, but he never said anything. But one day, he came and he said, \u201c\u201cThe Germans are coming for\nthe boys and girls. It would be good for you to escape here from here with the child. I think I\nwrote about it, you read it. Michal isn't here, I have no address for Michal. He was one right\nhere, one right there, didn't know what to do. I had a few, you know, Polish zlotys, but didn't\nknow what to do and I had to go, because if he came to me and said it in a nice way, that he\ndidn't want me, you know, to -- he knew that I wouldn't survive with the child. He said I have to\ndisappear, I have to disappear. And he said, that peasant said there is a brother of the -- his wife\nin -- near Tuszcz. Tuszcz 1s -- was the station where the train stopped for Treblinka, you know.\nTuszcz, Malkinia and Treblinka, this was the -- the route. \u201cHe's a smith (ph), you know and so\nwe can take you there. And maybe until your husband will come, he'll find you.\u201d Well, it was\nquite a few miles. I was carrying Irene you know, with the rest of my, of my strengths. He was\ncarrying a little package what I had, you know, diapers, this. And we came there. Well, they\nwere very nice to us because, you know, he says my husband should come, you know and they'll\ntake me away, it's only a matter of a few days. So she was very nice. But somebody pass by from\nthe village where I was before, in the Gleb- Gleboczyce, who said, \u201cShe was there, why is she\nhere? She is probably Jewish.\u201d This was it. So she came in, the wife and said, \u201cYou cannot stay\nhere any more. You have to go.\u201d And then I decided to go to Warsaw. What do I do? I don't\nknow where, no address, no nothing. And Michal wouldn't know where I am. So I said, \u201cOkay,\ntomorrow I'll go. You'll take me there to the station and I'll go.\u201d So then I put Irene to sleep for a\nnap before the trip. Trip supposed to be one o'clock, two o'clock, I don't remember. And she slept\nand I was standing at the window and I was crying. And suddenly I see somebody passing by.\nMichal. And I started to run after him, until I came out. He was very fast walking, he didn't know\nanything, you know. And -- and he didn't hear me, and he didn't hear me screaming, \u201cMichal.\u201d\nSo I took a stone, I threw at him. So then he turned around, said, \u201cWhat you doing here?\u201d And I\ntold him the whole story. This was a miracle, complete miracle. So he came into the apartment\nand then the -- when the smith (ph), you know, he said, you know, was talking to him and just\nlooking him up and down and he said, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d And he says, \u201cOh, I am a mechanic,\nyou know, this, that.\u201d So he looks at his hand and said, \u201c\u201cYou are not a mechanic. Doesn't look\nlike it.\u201d And we left. I with Michal, we left. And he took me to pref -- you know, we're afraid of\nthe train, you know. People were -- this was a station where everybody was running here and\nthere. So he took me there, he took me to Warsaw, we took a -- a carriage, you know, a -- s-same\nis standing in Central Park. And we got off about two blocks before it's destination, which was a\nvery old -- she was a concierge, that woman and the -- for that building where he took me. And\nthis was a very narrow, little room where there were already three woman living. The -- the\nowner -- the -- the -- the concierge with a little boy and I come and with Irene and Michal. He\nfound it, somebody told him, but he lived not far away, one block away. He lived there, lived,\nyou know, slept. This was the -- the -- the worker where he -- whom he met in the street, what\nare you doing, and he gave him -- said threw he can stay with him. He was very nice too, that\nman. He was helping for awhile and then he changed his mind and started to talk. So we -- we\nwent there and I had the little narrow bed for Irene and myself and we contacted the -- Gina, she\nwas working in Warsaw. And Gina came, you know and what do we do? We cannot stay here,\neverybody will know. And we decided to separate Irene from us, for her to be safe. Cause we\nknew that we'll perish, this way, another way. It's impossible to live through the whole thing,\nimpossible. So let Irene stay, you know, at least. And we talked it over with Gina, and Gina said,\n\u201cT have somebody.\u201d And she said, where she gave her exam for nursing -- which was\ninternational -- the Ministry, she had to go through the Ministry of -- of Health and Education,\nDr. Zachert. \u201cShe seemed to me a very nice person,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen she -- when she examined\nme. I'll call her.\u201d She called her, she had already papers and she called her and she said that her --\nshe want to see her, because she want to -- advice from her. She said, \u201cOf course, come.\u201d A very\nnice person. And she went up and when she told her over the phone that she's on the Juzwiak. So\nshe said, \u201cYou are not Juzwiak. You are a Gina Klepfisz. Please come in.\u201d And she told her the\nstory, she has a brother and a sister-in-law and a baby and sad situation, what can we do? She\nwas also the director of the orphanage, Boduena. Priest Boduen was called. She says, \u201cI can take\nthe baby to the orphanage as an orphan, but not knowing that she's an orphan and she has to be\nleft in the street and I'll take her over.\u201d And here starts the whole thing.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\nBeginning of Tape 1, Side B",
        "Q: And here starts the whole thing... So, 1t was a very difficult decision, but we had to do it...\nLet's stop.",
        "A: All right, let's -- let's stop for a moment. Okay?",
        "Q: So, we talked with Michal, over and how it was going to -- we have to put a name on her and\nthe Dr. Zachert will wait in the square, so and so and somebody has to come with Irene. Just\nleave her and go away and she'll pick her up. So I said to Michal, \u201cI'm not going to do that, I\ncan't. You have to do it.\u201d And Gina was also there, in the square, someplace without Dr. Zachert.\nSo he said, \u201cOkay,\u201d he has to do it. Well, I said good-bye to Irene, he took her and left. I was\nbeside myself... So Michal went there, to the square. He saw from the far Dr. Zachert and he\nsaw Gina, too. And he went to Gina, he said, \u201cI'm not going to do that, you do it.\u201d And Gina did\nit. She went close to Dr. Zachert and sat down on the bench and said to Irka, \u201c\u201cWait here a\nsecond, I just go for something,\u201d you know, for what-whatever. \u201cBut sit here.\u201d And she was\nplaying with something. So she -- and she left. The moment she left, Dr. Zachert came and took\nthe baby. This is how she got to Boduena. So at least I knew that she was going to be safe, over\nthere. No raids, you know.",
        "Q: How old was she, Rose, then?",
        "A: A year and a half. But she talked already, you know and she was very bright and very bright,\nmusical, very bright. And she could sing, you know, with what we're singing, you know, the\nmelodies. And the words, sometimes. Then Gina asked Dr. Sachat what's going to happen to me?\nSo she says, \u201cI have a sister with thr -- with three children.\u201d They are also belong to the, you\nknow, the people's party, Partja Ludowa, which were more, you know, li -- Catholics, deep\nCatholics, you know. But -- believed in Christ, that have to help people and so on. And she said,\n\u201cMaybe she'll come there, you know, and be the housekeeper, the maid.\u201d And she -- she said that\nwe have to -- I -- \u201cShe'll have to be reviewed, to have a few reviews with them,\u201d you know, my\nPolish, my behavior, my -- of course, a big asticulation (ph) all with Jews have all together. \u201cAnd\nthis would be a good place for her. And they have to look at her, how she looks.\u201d My eyes were\nalready prominent at that time. You'll see another picture of me before that, was because of\nthyroid. Again, I immediately knew what it is, you know, when I got up in the morning and my\neyes were prominent. Never had this kind of eyes. So I went there, was there three times,\ninterview. Meanwhile, before that I was in that room, where I lived, you know, where I be --\ncame from, with all these women. They were prostitute and they had all her -- their business in\nthe streets. They came in the middle of the night, or whatever. I didn't know about it. I wouldn't\neven think about 1t, Michal didn't know about it. And one evening was very -- what -- was very\nrainy, you know and they couldn't do their business in the street, so they invited two -- two men,\nyou know. And there was like a curtain over their bed and I was sitting there and reading, what\ndo I do? I was reading something. Someone said, \u201cWhy can't she give?\u201d \u201cLeave her alone, she\nhas a husband.\u201d \u201cSo, what's this?\u201d But [indecipherable] have to go. So I told them that next time,\nthat when they have some guests in their house, to let me know and I will go out. And they did it\none day, it was very cold or something like that. And they said to me, \u201cTake only five, 10\nminutes, can come back, but don't go around.\u201d They were very good people, very good women,\nreally. They loved Irene. She didn't cry at night, you know, all the time. So they told me to go\nand I went out and I was walking around the block, it was evening, around the blocks, I wasn't\nafraid that somebody can catch me. And I was walking probably for a half an hour or more,\neven. And then I hear somebody grabs me. It was one of the -- said, \u201cWhat do you think, going\nin such a cold time, all around? Why don't you come back? I told you take only five, 10 minutes,\nthat's all. You -- you can get, you know, a pneumonia or something like that, come in.\u201d This\nwere the women. Then when -- also when I gave away the baby, you know, when I said it's\ngoing to my cousin, Hearanther (ph) says, \u201cWhy did you do that? We could take care of her if\nyou wouldn't, you know.\u201d And we said, \u201cI'm going to work, he is going to work,\u201d you know, if a\nJew wouldn't be able to take it, \u201cWe would take care of them.\u201d They were good women. And\nthey loved Irene, you know, because she didn't cry, they\nwere afraid in the beginning that, who knows, the baby will cry, but -- so this was the story\nbefore I went for the interviews.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in that room with those women, do -- do you have any recollection?",
        "A: About two weeks, probably. Probably two weeks, cause we arranged with Irene quite fast.\nWere afraid for every day, somebody would say, \u201cThat Jews,\u201d so they would take away it. So\nGina arranged it, you know and Dr. Sachat. And I was waiting for about two weeks, I would say.",
        "Q: And -- and while you were waiting to hear the news about whether you could go to this -- to\nthe sister, did you keep hearing that Irene was -- did you get news about Irene in the orphanage,\nor not?",
        "A: Not at that time.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Not at that time, no. No, not at that -- that time. But I knew that she will take care of her, I\nknew that.",
        "Q: You trusted them?",
        "A: I trust, absolutely yeah. I trust that she's safe there. This is why I did it. If I would have any\ndoubts, I wouldn't do it. Because if doubts, I can have outside too, I don't have to give her away.\nBut I was sure that she -- bombing, bombardment. The Germans are coming. So I went there for\nthe interviews and of course I passed it. And I was like a mother to the children, instead of my\nown. I tutored them. She told me -- and their sister, Dr. Sachat told me. He was an also engineer,\narchitect, the whole building was of architects, a co-op of architects. Intelligent, you know, nice\npeople. And you know, they said that the house was never in such an order, never 1n their life.\nThe oldest son was 14 years old, Mirek. Gorgeous, he was like really gorgeous, beautiful. He\nhelped me a lot. He didn't know, the children didn't know who I am, that I'm Jewish. Only the --\nthe parents and of course the sarachtinta (ph). They come very often, they used to come, you\nknow, for holidays they get together and this and that. And she said -- her name was Rouba...",
        "Q: This is the wife?",
        "A: The wife, yeah, yeah, Halina. Yes, and he was Yusef (ph). And Mirek, Ewa and Julek, the\nthree children. They loved me, because I was constantly spending time with them, tutoring,\nbecause the schools, was no, you know, there was -- Mirek was going to school, but it was\nunderground. They shouldn't have schools, children couldn't go to school. And to wash them and\nsew was sew, I was sewing for them, you know, every -- when they were sick, only they wanted\nme. And she, whenever I call, was going marketing. She said, \u201cMuireczku, you always have to go\nwith Miss, it was Miss Pani!\u2019 Lodziu, you know, I was Lodziu Lowakatya (ph).",
        "Q: What was your -- what was your new name?",
        "A: Lodziu Lowakatya (ph) Sheletska (ph), this is what I got in the country, that my -- I have the -\n- the Kennkarte.'* And always go marketing with, because it's difficult for her, you know, she's\ntiny. And he said, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d Whenever he used to leave the apartment, he used to bring\nme coal from the cellar and all kinds of the heaviest things he used to bring me. When he used to\nleave the house, he used come, \u201cPani Lodziu, may I go?\u201d You know, this way. He was very\nnice. And the children, the two younger children, she was going once a week to another town,\nwhere she had an uncle, a priest, Lowicz, to Lowicz, and bring food. Sour cream, butter, cheeses,\nyou know, all kind of things. A lot of it, he'd start to prepare for her when she's coming and she\ncould sell to the neighbors, because we couldn't get it. And she didn't take much money. Before\nthat, she had herself, what she made from them, she could pay for her own, to have for the\nfamily. So she was free to go for a few days, for two days, three days, because I took care of the\nfamily, you know. So it was a double thing. And not to make me feel bad, she was paying me 80\nzlotys a month that I\u2019m working for it, not that I\u2019m giving, you know, her this. Through her I had\na telephone there, Michal could call me. And I had a lot of contacts. Over there was living one\nwoman and also she was a teacher and she was very -- and she probably guessed, we never\ntalked about it, but I\u2019m sure she guessed who I am. What I am, you know, who I am. I found\n'7 Mrs. (Polish).\n'8 TD card (German).\nanother one, also a friend of hers and that woman, where I could put my friend, Halinka\nEllenbogen. She was also a maid someplace. She was always with swollen knees because she\nwas on the floor, you know, washing the floors. I never did this kind of thing. And she was\ncrying and this and that, but she looked very well, you know, like really Aryan. She used to come\nup to me and I gave her a place to live not far from me. She was also a teacher. And she had, and\nthen I gave her the place with Dr. Zachert in Boduen, so she saw Irene every day. And so she had\nthe apartment I arranged for her, she had the books and French literature, all kinds of things. She\nwas so proud of it -- after being a maid, you know, when we came to Florida. And the work she\nhad in Boduen, she could see Irene every day. And I got reports from her about Irene. But one\nday, in the beginning, I wanted to see Irene. So I started to walk there. It wasn\u2019t too far from me,\nit was far enough but not too bad. I could walk then have to take the train which I was avoiding.\nAnd the children were going from one side of the street to the other to play with the garden. And\nI knew from afar, I could see Irene. And one day I decided to go to her, to pick up her hand and I\nsaid, P\u2019ll help you to cross the street. And she gave her hand and she looked at me and she\nwalked with me and the nun came and she started screaming at me, \u201cYou know that you are not\nallowed to touch our children! You can give them some kind of infection!\u201d which is true. It was\ntyphus and syphilis and this kind, so I said, I\u2019m sorry. I never do it again. So I left Irene and I\nwalked away and she said,\u201d Mommy!\u201d I got scared. I was afraid that the nun heard it but she\ndidn\u2019t. I never went again. She recognized me. It was after a few months. She was crying the first\nthree months, I heard.\nDr. Zachert told me that. At night, she was crying. And then, I have a very sharp instinct, I don\u2019t\nknow how it happens but it is so. I can somehow feel out things. I was cooking something, I was\npreparing dinner, and I had a dish with peeled potatoes to put into the water, put into the pot.\nAnd I was thinking about Irka and I said, \u201cIrka is very sick.\u201d And everything fell down on the\nfloor. I didn\u2019t understand why. So then, I called, I didn\u2019t call, I called Dr. Zachert and I said, \u201cI\nhave a feeling that Irka is very sick.\u201d She said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s true. She still has a mark on her leg, she\ngot some kind of infection.\u201d And even the priest wanted to come, you know, she was very sick.\nAnd then, you know, somehow she got out of it, you know.",
        "Q: We have to change the tapes, so let\u2019s take a break, okay?",
        "A: Yes, please.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "Q: Rose, I want to go back a little because we forgot a very sweet story about Irene and milk and\na cow. Can you tell us that story?",
        "A: Yes. You know, the ghetto when it was established and they come down a little bit, they\nsettled down, and there were places where they had cows. They took them to the field during the\nday, close by, and then, you know, some never went out of the ghetto, too. And that I couldn\u2019t, I\nwas breastfeeding her, but not always I had enough and so once she needed milk. And my\ndoctors, they believed very much in fresh milk so my mother-in-law found out where the cows\nare. They wasn\u2019t too far from where we lived. And we decided to buy milk, fresh milk, as she,\nyou know, was selling a lot of things to have money for everyday, and so on. We took, we went\nthe first time, I went and bought milk and she asked me, \u201cWhich cow do you want?\u201d To me they\nlooked all the same, but I said, \u201cThis cow.\u201d So she gave me milk from this cow and from then\non, I was always buying from the same cow the milk because I was afraid maybe another cow\ncould get sick or something will happen to her and then it will be a reflection on Irene. So we\nhad the milk all the time, whenever I bought, from the same cow.",
        "Q: Was Irene hungry?",
        "A: Irene was never hungry. Maybe was in the orphanage, I don\u2019t think the children were hungry\nin the orphanage because they got some food, whether it was good food or bad food, I don\u2019t\nknow. But I am sure that she was never hungry. She needed a lot, let\u2019s see, other things like a\nfruit, a chocolate, which I always sent in, and Dr. Zachert used to give her. Even my husband,\nMichal, he went a few times to the orphanage and brought the chocolate and good things to Dr.\nZachert so she can give it to her. And she was giving to her, I gave it to her and she was giving\nvery quietly to Irene, I know, something special. But when he went there, she was screaming at\nhim, she said to never show up again. Because it was very dangerous for the child.\nNobody should know, only the director of the orphanage knew, the woman, that she is a Jewish\nchild, and I can -- only the mother -- can pick her up. This was her restriction, Dr. Zachert\u2019s,\nwhen Irene came to the orphanage. She said only I can pick her up and not to give the child to\nanybody because people adopt, you know how it is, she looked as a very Aryan child. She was\nblonde. You\u2019ll see the photographs of her when she\u2019s a little, a little child. So this is, you know,\nbut I don\u2019t think Irene was hungry.",
        "Q: So even in the ghetto she wasn\u2019t hungry?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no. And that... Look, she was the only child in our family, you know. We\ncould be hungry, I was not ever, not all the time, you know, I had enough, believe me. But Irene,\nno, Irene had even fresh milk from the same cow. No, she wasn\u2019t hungry. And later on, she got --\nI would have a very difficult time, but Irene usually had everything when it comes to food. Even,\neven her clothes, later on, I was sewing and Halinka was sewing for her, so we had, she was, I\ndon\u2019t think Irene suffered.",
        "Q: When you described the deportation of your mother, and your mother-in-law and father-in-\nlaw, there\u2019s a piece of the story that I think that, that you didn\u2019t tell us about Gina seeing them at\nthe gate?",
        "A: Yeah, Gina wasn\u2019t there when the raid was in the building, but she was in the hospital. But\nshe saw them later on in the Umschlagplatz, and Maria was carrying her father\u2019s -- I mean,\nIrene\u2019s great-grandfather, a golden watch which the men always carried in their vests, with the\nchains, the golden chains. And she took this watch and she gave it to Genia and said, \u201cThis\nwatch, this golden watch, is for Irene. Whenever she would be in need to have it, to buy her out\nof whatever happens, but this is for this child.\u201d And she gave it to Irene and then, she gave it to\nGina and Gina gave it to me. And later on, I gave it to Dr. Zachert for her when she was in the\norphanage. With the address of the Aunt here in the States, inside the watch I put in a little card\nwith the address of Irene\u2019s grandmother\u2019s sister, here in the States. But she was killed by the\nUkrainians in the Polish uprising.",
        "Q: Dr. Zachert?",
        "A: With her husband, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, hold on for a second. Rose, can you, can you tell us how Dr. Zachert and her husband\nwere killed?",
        "A: In the Polish uprising, it was 1944. The Ukrainians were there, the Latvians were there, the\nLithuanians on the side of Germany and they were behaving terrible. They were drinking and\nkilling and this was the case with Dr. Zachert because somebody told us what happened at that\ntime. They took all the people down, they lived in a very fine neighborhood, this is where I was,\nnot far from them. And they took them down on onto the court and just killed them and robbed\nthem. And at that time, also, you know, when the watch was then with them. But this was what\nthey were doing. Before I want to still tell you about going back, my life, this Rouba, that Halina\nEllenbogen used to come up to me, did I tell you that?",
        "Q: Was she the one who was living in the, yes, you told me.",
        "A: Yes, I told you about that. That she was, you know, I gave her the job and then, at that time,\nalso during that time, we used to go, you know, meeting, then I met Maria and Blanca, Maria\nRosenbloom (ph) and Blanca Rosenberg.",
        "Q: And how did you meet them?",
        "A: It was by pure accident. Halina Ellenbogen was before Madden Sanitarium (ph) a sanitarrum\nfor children, for sick children under the auspices of Bund. Madden (ph) was one of the great\nleaders from the Bund \u2014 really a theoretician of the Bund -- so there was a sanitarium named in\nhis name and during the war. She was there. Perelka is really her name, Ellenbogen. There was\nalso Boleck Ellenbogen and Anya (ph) Ellenbogen, so it was the family. And after the\nliquidation of the Madden Sanitarium, in fact, Michal came there and told them one night that\nthey can go out but they didn\u2019t hear; they were on another side of the -- and this was from\nWarsaw quite a few miles, about 10 or 15 miles.\nThey had to go by train, and they didn\u2019t hear him, but he went at night. Halina said that she\nheard him, but they couldn\u2019t come to that point because they were afraid. So they then came to\nWarsaw, there was one woman also, a teacher, in Madden Sanitartum, which was -- Irene was\nalso young and she took care of her and she came to look for work. And at that time Blanca and\nMaria were working at the Germans; she probably told you. And she came to ask for work.\nThere were Volksdeutscher!? Germans, or German, \u201creal Germans.\u201d And so she, Blanca, was the\nhead maid over the housekeeper, for the Germans, and she looked at her, and she said, \u201cMy\nname is Geneska (ph),\u201d which is a Polish name. So Blanca answered her, \u201cWe have a lot of\nGeneska\u2019s (ph) like that, you know.\u201d And through her, Halina came to Blanca and Maria and, as\nwe were meeting constantly, you know, Sundays we had all off. So we\u2019re meeting in one place,\neither at Anya (ph) Ellenbogen\u2019s, where she was working, her mistress was going out, so we\nbrought in Blanca and Maria also there. And sometimes we were going there because they could\nlisten to the radio, to the, you know, Germans could have radio, so we could listen to what\u2019s\ngoing on. So this is how I got, you know -- we were, I want to tell you, during that time we were\nmeeting, all these friends, and we\u2019re meeting Marysia Sevitzka, you know, and just Navel (ph)\nHalska (ph), who gave us a lot of help, particularly to Michal and Gina and when Gina was sick,\nthey were taking care of her. But this was during the Aryan side, until the Polish uprising in\n1944. And during, you know, the Polish uprising --",
        "Q: Could we, could we go back, because in some ways we are moving faster. There\u2019s a period\nbetween October-November, when Irene goes into the orphanage and you\u2019re working at that\nhouse. Between that time and then the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto, the Jewish, Jewish\nuprising, and how much you\u2019re seeing, Michal and --",
        "A: And the Jewish were uprising, the Warsaw ghetto uprising, you talking? How much I was\nseeing?",
        "Q: Seeing him, what did you know about what he was doing at that point?\n'? Ethnic German (German).",
        "A: Okay, yes. At that point, I knew already what he was doing. We were meeting constantly. We\nwere meeting and let\u2019s say, sometimes I was staying there overnight, too, that worker who met\nhim in the street and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He gave him a shelter then. It was a\nbasement, something like that \u2014 or maybe a low ground floor apartment. So he slept there, you\nknow. This was his place at that time. And we were meeting either there or other places,\nsometimes in a coffee shop which he knew was safe to go into a certain room, or whatever. And\nhe was writing a lot, what\u2019s going on, and he was meeting with the leaders from the\nunderground. And there was a special place also from the Bundists, on Sharavial (ph) Street and\nhe was leaving there, the happenings, you know, the events, which he was writing down\neveryday. And I remember sitting once with some coffee and he was writing, and I said, \u201cAren\u2019t\nyou afraid?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, this is, you know, we have to leave something. What\u2019s happening\nnow.\u201d He, he wrote everyday. He was very, very, you know, historically minded, and to let\npeople know what\u2019s happening. So we were meeting, I would say once a week for sure, when\nMrs. Rouba saw that I am very depressed or something, she says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and meet\nyour husband,\u201d because whenever I come back from these meetings, you know, I was elated. I\nwas -- started to believe this will be the end of it. He always could put me in such a mood, you\nknow, really. \u201cBe patient, you\u2019ll see, we will come through, we will take Irene,\u201d you know, these\nkind of things. And I was always looking forward for the weekend you know, to see him. We\nused to meet constantly. And he used to tell me what\u2019s going on, what he is doing, at that time.",
        "Q: So did you know that he was \u2014",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: --creating the explosion, that he was teaching people?",
        "A: I knew, I knew that, yeah. I knew that.",
        "Q: Were you torn about what he was doing?",
        "A: Yes. I had a big conflict because this was very dangerous, what he is doing. He was exposed,\nhe was going in and out because he looked well, but you know, there are always those, they\u2019 II\ncalled shmaltsovnik,\u201d\u00b0 you know. They take money, you know. And they can always spot you --\nand they even took Stefan, that I\u2019m talking about, was sleeping. He later on started to get money\nfrom other people and then, you know, telling all kinds of stories and he just cut off with him.",
        "Q: The man he was living with for a time?",
        "A: He wouldn\u2019t harm Michal, but other people that were coming, if Vladka was coming in there\ntoo, you know, was sometimes... Because, you know, the connections with, with all that. So, I\nhad a big conflict with that. What is more important? I and the child or this? I had a tremendous\nconflict. But to him it was important. He couldn\u2019t do otherwise.",
        "Q: Did you talk about the conflict together or couldn\u2019t -- did you not feel able to do that?",
        "A: No. I couldn\u2019t do it to him. And the last time he called me, we had the telephone, Mrs. Rouba\nhad the telephone, he called me. This was before the 17\" -- it was about the 16\" -- of April, it\nwas Irene\u2019s birthday and his, and he called me and he said that he\u2019s going back into the ghetto\nbecause they know that they will be coming, the Germans will come and surround the ghetto and\nthe fight will start. And I said at that time, \u201cMaybe you won\u2019t go.\u201d He said, \u201cI must go.\u201d I didn\u2019t\nsay anything anymore. This was it. And he wished me, you know, Irene, and all that. It was his\nbirthday, his 30\" birthday. And Irene was how much? Two years old. I had a tremendous\nconflict. For a long, long time, maybe up to now, who knows. But what\u2019s more important. You\n*0 A person who, for money or favor, betrayed Jews in hiding.\ncannot judge. We were very important to him, I know that. He left Irene. He felt when she was\nborn, that there\u2019s no other child who is more educated, more intelligent and prettier than she is,\nso? He was very proud, very proud of her. So this was, you know, we were meeting, and\nconstantly. In different places, we were meeting. And later on, when -- after the Warsaw ghetto\nuprising -- we started to meet with other people, and as I say, it was Blanca and Maria and Anya\n(ph) Ellenbogen, and Boleck Ellenbogen and Halina Ellenbogen.\nHalina is also not her name, but, Pearl is her name. And Halina was nearby me, over there, she\ngot the job and Anya (ph) was still working as a maid, and Bolek was working in the\nconstruction business. So, we, we used to meet. Sometimes we went to Marysia Sawicka\u2019s home\nand Navel (ph) Halska (ph). And there was a time when Michal was grabbed in the street and\ngoing to Treblinka. He was on the train, and he jumped. He jumped from the train and the\nGermans shoot and it was, it was -- he got it in his leg, the bullet, and he was, he couldn\u2019t walk,\nbut he hid someplace in the field where he jumped from and the first place he waited until the\nmorning. This was closer to the evening, middle of the morning, something. In the morning, he\nwent to Marysia Sawicka and Navel (ph) Halska (ph), they lived together. And they took him in,\nof course. Under, underneath, Gestapo lived. They had a big apartment, Gestapo. And there was\nno toilets there, you know, so they had to carry out everything. But they did it. They were\nmarvelous, they were really marvelous. They helped a lot, they give such a shelter to many\npeople, particularly to Gina when Gina got sick. Gina got sick and she died, you know, before\nthe Polish uprising. She died in 1942. She felt she had ulcers and she couldn\u2019t function. She was\nvery sick, and I wasn\u2019t the strongest either and a small child, so she felt that she had to take care\nof us. The only way being, and that is knowing what\u2019s the matter, she couldn\u2019t go for an\noperation. But this was a Polish, you know, hospital. And how much care she...Michal didn\u2019t tell\nme.\nShe talked to me about going for an operation, I said, \u201cNever.\u201d I said, \u201cOver my dead body\nyou\u2019re going to the hospital because I am afraid they might not give you good care.\u201d And Michal\ndid not tell me that she went to the hospital, but I found out that she died in the hospital after the\noperation. And this was in December, 1942. So another link of the family went.",
        "Q: Can, can you tell me a little bit more of what she was doing? She seemed to have been\nhelping an awful lot of people in the Umschlagplatz?",
        "A: And she was working in the hospital, too, in that stupid hospital, you know, created, it wasn\u2019t\na real hospital. It was just made a hospital. She was working there as a nurse. This is why I had\nthe privileges of being in the nursing room, in the nurses\u2019 room, you know, and having these\ndoctors operating on me.",
        "Q: How, how did she have the, who granted her the privilege of being at the Umschlagplatz, and\nhow did she start?",
        "A: On her own.",
        "Q: On her own?",
        "A: This is on her own. Of course, she put on her uniform, you know, had a special uniform with\nsuch, on her own, with her hat. You will see her hat, yeah. This is, you know, a sort of nurse.\nThis was on her own.",
        "Q: And the Germans didn\u2019t stop her?",
        "A: At that time, they let in, you know, still this was the beginning of this, they let in at that time.\nSo, she took them out, for this case, this case, you know. They always could find some kind of\nexcuse for the official people. She was like an official person. Gina was a marvelous person\nanyway. She loved this baby like, she was a joy for the whole family, in those circumstances.",
        "Q: You know, we\u2019ve talked privately about luck and about how everything was so arbitrary. One\ndidn\u2019t know from one moment to the next if one would be living.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. This was, for example, you know, as I was going to meet Michal, let\u2019s say, and\nwe always waited until the last moment before the police time...to get home. He was in one side\nof the city, I was in the other side, we didn\u2019t want to take the tram, and then I see the streets is\nempty.\nI was walking, you know, in the street and then from afar I see an SS man walking, you know,\nwith his arm and I don\u2019t know whether to pass or to cross the other side. If I cross, it will be\nsuspicious. I probably should go straight. And I went marching through him straight. And I\npassed. Behind me, about 20 yards behind me, was, I heard, you know, somebody walking.\nThere\u2019s another woman and he stopped her. Why not me, but her, who is probably Polish?\nBecause who would risk, you know, this kind of thing? He stopped her. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened, but he stopped her. If he, 1f he would stop me, it would be the end of me because all\nmy knowing the, the, the, the prayers, you know, and all that. I wouldn\u2019t pass. Because they can\nalways hook up to something, which I couldn\u2019t answer or be not true.",
        "Q: Did you look Jewish?",
        "A: I looked like nothing, I told you, I looked like nothing. Not this way, not this way, I looked\nlike somebody that doesn\u2019t matter, you know, doesn\u2019t pay attention to me. I was wearing a hat, I\nwas wearing a black coat. To look like nothing, you know.",
        "Q: Do you also try to look like nothing?",
        "A: Of course. Of course, yeah. Not to pay att -- not to call attention to myself. I was there dressed\nnormally, and Sundays, you know, it\u2019s the main thing. When I was going out to meet this one or\nthis one, this was that.",
        "Q: Could you tell us about this dream that you had?",
        "A: Yes. When Michal was still alive, we were getting the bulletin, it\u2019s called \u201cInformative\nBulletin\u201d from London, we use to get, and this was underground. And I was picking it up\nsomeplace, on certain street, for the whole building. It was a co-op building for the engineers,\narchitects, engineers, and they were all, you know, patriots, Polish patriots. Only the concierge\u2019\nwas a little shaky for me. And he didn\u2019t know, if he would know, I wouldn\u2019t be, you know, there.\nIf he would guess even, I wouldn\u2019t be, he would finish with me, to get some money from\nGestapo.\nAnd Michal was still alive and I was, I had a dream. I woke up and I was all wet. I dreamt that I\nsee in that bulletin, I see a news item about \u201cMichal Klepfisz, engineer, was caught while\nmaking arms\u2019, you know, and was, and he was killed, something like that. And I remember it\nwas page three; one, two, you know \u2014 the first page, the number three -- and I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nAnd truly enough, it was in 19 \u2014 late \u201943, I get the bulletin, Biuletyn Informacyjny,\u201d! Michal was\nalready dead. It was the end of the year, I don\u2019t remember which month, it was the same news\nitem! And he was awarded. It was the medal of Virtuti Militari, the only medal given, you know,\nto a Jew at the time of the Nazi occupation. How would this happen, I don\u2019t know, but this is a\nfact. Being still on the Aryan side, I had to have my Kennkarte, you know?",
        "Q: Let me, let me, can I stop you for a minute? How did you find out that he was killed? When\ndid you find out?",
        "A: I found out two weeks later, about 10 days later. Vladka came to tell me. It was a little\nunfortunate the way she did it, but she wanted the best, probably, but she told me. We met\nSunday, on my, you know, free day. She called me and was, because I didn\u2019t hear from him at\nall, and the fighting was going on and she got a contact from the ghetto. Marek Edelman (ph)\nwas in his group, with Michal, and the whole group was there. And she found out, you know,\nthey let her know. But she didn\u2019t tell me for a while, and she also, it was probably difficult for\nher to tell me. And we met in the street, in a park, and she told me about that.",
        "Q: So she knew longer than, for a longer time before she told you?",
        "A: A few days longer. I don\u2019t know how many days, you know, but it was later on.\n*! Information Bulletin (Polish).",
        "Q: What did you mean it was unfortunate how she told you?",
        "A: She started to talk about other things, you know, tried to make me laugh, this...you know, but\nforget about it. This 1s a -- but I couldn\u2019t comfort myself for a long time. This was the end, yeah.",
        "Q: Did the family help, that you were staying with? I mean, you were -- did you tell them?",
        "A: Yes. Because they knew I am beside myself. They were very warm, very sympathetic, you\nknow. The children didn\u2019t know. So the children never knew who I was. And, so this was that.",
        "Q: And then you had to start again in a way?",
        "A: On my own, without any advice. To make my own decisions and how to deal with the stress.\nAnd then came the offer, after a while, for the Hotel Polski. The director of that, you know,\nGuzik. He was very well known, he was in the Judenrat; he was personagrata (ph). He said that I\ncan go to France with Irene. The Jews paid thousands and thousands of dollars to get out and\nthey could.... They were all in that Hotel Polski, it was hotel. Whoever paid was in this hotel, the\nJews. And I went there twice, I remember, to visit some people, to find out what it is and how it\nis; who are going, who paid in and going. And there was a woman, Estusia Lipszyc, her husband\nwas also very famous Bundist and activist and she had a son and a daughter older overseas. And\nshe was going. She paid in because she sold, she was a dentist, she sold everything, you know,\nher cabinet, you know, this, everything. And she had the money and she paid in and she was\ngoing. So I came there and she saw me, she says, \u201cLook, I have two children, I am not afraid; I\nam going, that I want to be together.\u201d And I told her that I had the offer from Guzik, she says,\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take your child and go?!\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m scared, I don\u2019t know. I cannot make this\nkind of decision. Now she 1s in the orphanage, she is safe. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\nShe is safe now. And the main thing 1s her safety.\u201d I went once; I looked around at the people\nwho are going there, they were mostly Jews, so it was dangerous, but I took the risk, I wanted to\nknow.\nThen I went the second time, and I remember that I met I think Meed, his brother, I think, went\nthere also. And I think so. I think it was his brother. And I spoke again and I still, I couldn\u2019t\nmake the decision because Irene was safe. I felt. Whether it was true or not, I don\u2019t know, but\nthis is how I felt at that time. And I came back and I had to give an answer because the Guzik\nhad to know the amount of people to get out from Warsaw to France. Vittel, this was the town,\nVittel, the famous town, Vittel. And I spoke to Mrs. Rouba and him and they said to me, \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t trust the Germans. If you want to go, go, but we don\u2019t trust them.\u201d And this was somehow\nmy point, decision. They helped me to decide not to go and I did a good thing because all the\npeople went to Auschwitz from Hotel Polski. So, how do you know? This is luck. You make a\ndecision, you don\u2019t know right or wrong. And I didn\u2019t have anybody close to find out, to ask\nwhat should I do? But this was my decision. They helped me to do it. And this is how it was. So,\nthen came the -- we met with friends of mine, as I told you, with whom. And it was nice at that\ntime to see somebody friendly. And they were good company, you know, meaning (ph). They in\nthey were -- when the Germans, you know, they were working for the Germans, they had a\npicture of a Polish \u2014 Zeromski, you know, author, very famous, you can imagine, when we came\nin there. Then came the Polish uprising. This 1s 1944 and they came to our building, too. And\nthey took us out, the Rouba family, the whole Rouba family.\nMireck, the oldest one, went to fight. With the, you know, with the uprising. He was in the\nuprising. And one of the days, Halina told me, Halina Ellenbogen, when they were in the bunkers\nhiding, they were going from places to places. Who came there? Mireck. As Halina and I use to\ncome up to meet, to visit me there, Mireck came in and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cThe same thing as everybody else.\u201d He went out and an hour later he brought her sugar, a\nwhole box of sugar. She couldn\u2019t get over it. Then he was killed in the uprising. Mirek was\nkilled, the oldest son. And the mother said, \u201cGod gave and God took.\u201d She was a very religious,\nyou know, Catholic. Then they came to us to take us and she, with her husband, the two children\nand I went to a camp, to a big, big field where they were selling all kind of vegetables. They\nwere coming from countries and the villages to sell vegetables, a tremendous place. And they\ntook us there, the Ukrainians. They were wild. They wanted to kills us, you know, in that\napartment, so she gave them a bottle of vodka and they started to drink and we went down. And\nthis we, you know, we joined the other people and we were taken, walking, you know, to that\nzazielenic,\u201d~ it was called. Zazielenic is green, the vegetables were called zazielenic, you know.\nAnd it was an open place with tens of thousands of people were there guarded. We were taken to\nPruszkow. It was a transient camp. There were factories, not working factories.",
        "Q: Who brought you? The Germans who brought you?",
        "A: Ukrainians.",
        "Q: Ukrainians brought you?",
        "A: Ukrainians, yeah. They were, you know, the same as the -- I don\u2019t know if they were the\nsame people, but they killed the Zacherts, you know -- they came -- this was in our area, over\n*2 Greens, vegetables (Polish).\nthere. And we were there sleeping there, you know, just on the grass, were the two children. And\nthen they were taken to Pruszkow, to the factories there. So we had a roof under, but nothing else\nthere. And they said that people with children, who have children, can go out.\nBecause they were taking people for work to Germany, so with people with children can go out.\nSo we have two children over there. And there\u2019s he and she. But I don\u2019t have a child. So I was\nthere, I saw there a nun with a few children and I ask her whether she can give me a child and an\naddress where I can deliver the child later. And this way I will go out. She gave me -- she was\ngrateful that she can get rid of one child at least. She gave me this child and we all went out and\nwe went to Ro-bus (ph), an old, the next little town from Pruszkow . We walked. And we went\nthere and I was with this strange little girl. She was four or five years old. And what do we do\nnow\u201d There is no money, there is nothing. And I don\u2019t know what is going to happen to Irene\nbecause everything was being evacuated. I knew that I have to go back and find out what\u2019s\nhappened to Irene, to Pruszkow, at least. And I got an address from another convent, meanwhile,\nI was there a few days. I took the little girl. I brought her to that convent and I went back. I slept\nin the convent for a whole night, I didn\u2019t know who I am. I said that the parents, so and so and\nso, you know. And I went back and then I told the Roubas\u2019, \u201cI am going to Pruszkow. I have to\nfind out what\u2019s happened with Irene.\u201d She says, \u201cWhere are you going, where are you going to\nstay?\u201d She had a friend in Pruszkow, on Olowkowa, the street in the [Indecipherable] 11, and I\ngot the address from her.\nAnd one morning, she says, \u201cYou have no money, you have nothing.\u201d I says, \u201cWhat can I do, but\nI have to go.\u201d So when they were all sleeping still, I left her a note that I am going to this and this\naddress, that she knows where I am because she was worried about me. And I have to know\nwhat\u2019s, what\u2019s happening to her. I was hungry, but I was walking through fields with the wheat\nas I was taking out the kernels and I was eating this, and I came to that person, to that family, and\nI told her that I know Mrs. Rouba. She didn\u2019t know anything, that I am Jewish, you know, and I\ncame that I was, I know them. I didn\u2019t say that I was working there, but I know them. And I met\nthem. And that I was in the Polish uprising and my husband is in Germany, he 1s working. And\nmy daughter, my child, is in orphanage because we had to do, we had to do something to make a\nliving and she should be safe. Is in the orphanage in, the Polish orphanage, a Catholic orphanage,\nyou know. So everything is kosher. And I started to run around to find out, the convent. I found\nout the convent and I told them the story, I was fighting in the Polish uprising, my husband 1s in\nGermany and all the same story. And my child 1s in the orphanage. Is Boduena coming here? Did\nyou hear anything about Boduen? They said, \u201cYes, we know that they are going to be\nevacuated.\u201d So, \u201cGood. When?\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know, but leave me your address and I let you\nknow.\u201d They were very nice and very kind. So I left them the address, where I was, but I was\ngone everyday. I did not rely on that. To that Pruszkow, to that camp, the big gates where,\nbecause it was a factory before that, and the Germans were sending their armies there, you know,\narms, and they were pushing me all the time. I was going closer, maybe can take a look inside or\nwhatever. I was running. One day, I came over there, I was almost the whole day because I was\nafraid they will come and I wouldn\u2019t know, were they going or whatever. One day, I come in\nDecember, they said somebody was standing there, \u201cBoduena orphanage come, came already.\u201d\nSo I heard this, I said, \u201cThis is it.\u201d I was waiting, I was already further a little bit from the gate. I\nwas afraid that they would catch me there. So I going further down and I see after maybe an\nhour, one cart came out with children. You know, what\u2019s cart, the Polish peasants have a cart;\nthere\u2019s a board in the center and there is two like other boards, but a little length. And the\nchildren were from both sides sitting, the small children, you know. And they\u2019re heads were\ngoing like that onto the board. There was one cart that came out with a horse, you know, this\nwas, was drawn by a horse.\nAnd Irene wasn\u2019t there. Came another one. Wasn\u2019t there. The third one, I found her. There is one\nnun there with the children, in the cart. I let them go because I was afraid, near, near the\nGermans. I let them go and quite a while I was running after them on the other side so nobody\nwould, you know, be suspicious. And I -- then I protest up the, the cart. And I said to the nun,\n\u201cHere is my little child, I want to take her.\u201d She said, \u201cTake her.\u201d I said, \u201cChodz do mamusi.\u201d\n\u201cCome to Mommy.\u201d She stretched out her hands, you know, and I took her. And I run. This\nchild, a running nose with the diarrhea. I felt her head, I saw that she has fever. I took her home.\nI took her temperature, it was in Celsius, you know, 40 degrees, which is 104\u00b0 Fahrenheit. I\ndidn\u2019t know what to do. I have not a penny to my soul. I don\u2019t know anybody. What do I do?\nWell, I asked about a doctor. The people I lived with, you know, I was already there about a\nweek, probably. I asked a doctor about a doctor and they gave me a name of a doctor, a Polish\ndoctor. I went there. \u201cI was in the uprising, my husband 1s in Germany, my child was in\norphanage. I just brought her back, she is sick and she has a lot of fever.\u201d So he said bring her. I\nsaid, \u201cI have no money.\u201d He said, \u201cBring her.\u201d And when I left to look for the doctor, Irka (ph),\nIrene said to me, \u201cMommy, will you still come back?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d I took the\nchild. He said, \u201cShe has deep bronchitis. She has infection of all her intestines. You have to give\nher medication and ground apples and take ground meat, make balls, boil it without anything and\ngive it to her. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nI brought her back and there were a lot of, you know, fruit cartons that sell, so I use to see that\napples were on the ground, so one evening I went out and I picked up the apples. I ground them,\ngave them. I borrowed money from my, from where I lived, I said, \u201cIll sew something for you,\nPll be sewing and I will return it. I will return the money to you.\u201d And she gave me and I bought\nthe meat and then, medication, what do I do now? So there was like Kupat-Cholim\u201d? in Israel.\nKasa-chorych\u201d* it was called, and I went there. \u201cI was in the Polish uprising, my husband is in\nGermany and my child is very sick, I have no money. Can I get the medication?\u201d He said, \u201cOf\ncourse you will get it.\u201d They gave me the without the money. The doctor didn\u2019t take money; they\ndidn\u2019t take money, I bought it, you know? She came out. She came out from that and she was,\nshe was happy with me. There was a teenager, Halina, and I was there. There came a time when\nthey needed the papers, the Kennkarte, you know. And she got used to it, you know, Irene, she\nsettled down somehow. Then I needed a Kennkarte, the document, without this, you know, I am\nnothing. And one winter day, I decided to go for it because I had the birth certificate of the, you\n*3 Israel\u2019s National Health Organization.\n** Poland\u2019s National Health Service.\nknow, sister of our maid once, what she gave me from the, when I went to the village that, on\nthis basis I could get a Kennkarte, but the risk to go to the official bureau to get a Kennkarte is\nlike to go, you know, on to the guillotine. And this highway, I am in Pruszkow and this 1s in\nanother town. I cannot go by train, I have to walk on the highway. I gave her instructions, I said,\n\u201cIn case maybe something happens to me, this and this and this.\u201d \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cNothing will happen to you, go.\u201d And I went.\nI had no instructions to give, to leave her with anybody, you know? And I go with this highway.\nIt was quite a few miles. And I\u2019m the only one there, it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s terribly cold, I didn\u2019t have\nany, something too, too warm to wear anyway. And against me walks a woman and she passes\nme by with, we always started, not to look each other in the face, whoever I see, better not. And I\nsee a familiar face but I wasn\u2019t sure, I was afraid. And I go. A few steps further, you know, five\nor six steps, I turn around, the woman stands and turns around too. I decided to meet her. And we\ngo to each other and who 1s it? It was Halina Szefner, who was the professor of my husband\u2019s in\na gimnazjum who teach him French, and I knew her. I knew her husband too. He was a\njournalist. And you can imagine. I had so many pimples on my face because, you know, I didn\u2019t\neat right and all that. The first thing what she did with me, there was a kiosk selling little things,\nshe bought me yeast, to eat it. I get vitamins, you know, for the pimples. She gave me the\ncontacts. She looked like, I say again, like a thousand, like a ton you know, going, beautiful\nwoman. I have a photograph of her. She was so marvelous, really, gray hair, white hair, she\nlooked like a queen. She gave me the contacts of Mirek.",
        "Q: Mirek Edelman?",
        "A: Yeah. She came me the contacts, Mirek and Anielewicz, you know, the whole group. Not\nAnielewicz, but Antek, Antek and Sylvia. She gave me the contacts over there. And she used to\ncome, you know, and visit me and when she looked at Irene, she told me later, \u201cThis child 1s\nvery sick,\u201d she told me. I mean, Irene was quite well already. Can you imagine how she looked?\nAnyway, one day, so I had to contact with her already, and she let them know that I am some\nplace, you know? She let them know because she was in contact with them. And one day, I took\nIrene.\nFirst of all, I had to take her to Boduena. They were taking all the children to big factories of\nsilk, a little for sewing silk, you know, the little things, and the factories. All the children are, if\nIrene would go there she wouldn\u2019t come out alive, being so sick at that time. I decided to go to\ntell the director that I took Irene because it was her responsibility and I felt at that time, also\nstupid of me, but it was right to do that, because she would be worried, what happened to Irene,\nwho took her? Because she was told not to, not to give her to anybody. So, I went there to her,\nthis was the first trip I did by train. And I came back. And after I met Halina Szefner, I decided\nto go to see Mirek Edelman with the whole group. And, because they would give me help,\nmoney they would give me, they had money. And I went there, I went to the train and on the\nway, a mother of my friend who looked like a hundred Jews, I made like that [shaking head\n\u201cno\u2019\u2019]. | approached her. So we got off and we went to Mirek and Ala, his wife, and there was\nSylvia and Antek together. Well, you can imagine that he saw us. Mirek was with, with the last\nminute, you know, with Michal. By the way, Mirek buried Michal in the same court where he\nwas killed. Did I tell you how he was killed?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stop the tape and then start there, because we\u2019re at the end.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4",
        "Q: Rose, again I want to go back a little before we come to the point where we ended the last tape.\nYou talked about Gina dying from that operation. Can you tell us a little bit about the funeral?",
        "A: Yes, Dr. Zachert really was in touch with the doctor in the hospital when Gina was there. I called\nher up and I told her what happened, that Gina is there, being operated on, and so she was really,\nyou know, in touch with that. And when it came to the funeral, when I found out, Michal told me\nthat she died, I, I, I went to the hospital and I wanted to speak to the doctor. And I waited for quite a\nwhile until he saw me. I don\u2019t know whether he knew this was neglect, I don\u2019t know. I am afraid it\nwas a neglecting thing, you know, just. And I asked him what happened. So he started to give me\nsome medical terms, which I couldn\u2019t understand, I couldn\u2019t comprehend the whole thing. And\njustifying, you know, the fact that she, there was no rescue for her, something like that. And then it\nwas the matter of the funeral. And I spoke to Dr. Zachert and she told me that she spoke to her priest\nand told him who she was. She was Jewish, and the priest told her, \u201cLet her be buried by the name\nshe was alive and died.\u201d So this way, she was buried in Prague, of the other side of Wisla in Pol --\nWarsaw. And I didn\u2019t let Michal to come to the funeral because it was too dangerous for him, he\nwas so exposed, you know, and different that anybody could find him. But there were a few people.\nDr. Zachert didn\u2019t come either because she didn\u2019t, she was afraid, you know, to commit herself in\ncase something happened. And some people came who were on the Aryan side, to the funeral, at\nthat time. And she was buried under her name, Kazimiere (ph) Jozwiak and later on, after the war, I\nsent money to Poland to write down under Kazimiere (ph) Jozwiak was Gina Klepfisz. Otherwise\nshe would never be found in the cemetery under this name, which was registered as Jozwiak and\nthis is how she has now her stone there.",
        "Q: And you came to the funeral?",
        "A: Sure, of course I was there.",
        "Q: Was it dangerous for you, also?",
        "A: It was always dangerous to, to go into the street, particular to such a gathering. Any gathering.\nSomebody can find you out. It, it was always dangerous. But we were living like that. I was going\nout into the streets and do some shopping or whatever I was doing, it was dangerous. It was\ndangerous, you know, with my next door neighbor, whether he would sense something and say,\n\u2018Please check it out,\u201d or whatever, of the concierge, you know, who was taking care of the building.\nIt was always dangerous.",
        "Q: Did you know everybody who was at the funeral? Were these all people --",
        "A: Yes, I did know. Yes, I did know. I didn\u2019t meet them but I know -- I knew them. And then there\nwas through the connections, they found out, you know, that this was the funeral and they came.\nAnd it was Marysia Sawicka and Anna Wachalska was there, the two of them, which helped.",
        "Q: It helped you?",
        "A: Of course, they were, you know, they were Christians and it helped, for them being there, in\ncase, In, in, in a sense of safety. Polak, you know. They came to the funeral.",
        "Q: And how old was Gina?",
        "A: Gina was five years older than Michal. So if he was born in 1913, she was \u2014yes?\u20141908, and \u201942\nminus \u201942 -- so 34 years old. No. She was born 19...Ok.",
        "Q: 1908. That\u2019s 44 \u2014 no \u2014 34.",
        "A: 34, yeah. 34 years old, yeah.",
        "Q: This is the only funeral, the only grave?",
        "A: The only grave for both families. We don\u2019t have any body else.",
        "Q: So it means a lot?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When the Warsaw ghetto uprising was occurring, do you remember what it was like on the\noutside? Whether people were doing anything?",
        "A: Yes, I was with the family Rouba and he was going everyday to the city because he was doing\nsome work as an architect, you know, very little, but he tried to get, you know, to make some, earn\nsome money, and he brought all the news. And I was asking him all the time, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nSo he use to tell me the Germans are in this block and they are burning the buildings and people are\njumping from the windows and the constant, you know, smoke. He can see. He never went close to\nthe ghetto to see, or whatever, but he used to tell me which blocks are being, you know, surrounded\nby, by the Germans and how people are fighting and, and all that. The atmosphere was, some said,\n\u2018Ah, it\u2019s good that the Germans are finishing out the Jews.\u201d I never went there close by, I was afraid\nto go there. Because of Irene, you know, I had to be, somebody had to be for her. I knew that\nMichal was there, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. And there was a telephone from the ghetto\nstill coming out to some people, which I had contact with, and they didn\u2019t hear anything. If they\nknew, they didn\u2019t tell me. But the atmosphere among, among the Polacks were very divided. Some\nwas not interested, not were very, you know, nothing. Some said it was good, what was happening\nand some were very, you know, sympathetic. But in, in our home, he was coming constantly and\ntelling me, my heart was, I didn\u2019t know when and how. And I didn\u2019t know for a long time. Until\nBlanca came and told me this was it. I understood, otherwise he would call or come out or\nsomething like that, but I don\u2019t want to believe it. Just won\u2019t believe it, you know. If you don\u2019t hear\nit, you don\u2019t believe it. This was that. It was a very tragic time, absolutely tragic for me when I\nfound out, really.",
        "Q: There, there was a point when two Germans came to pick you up? When, when was that?",
        "A: It was when I was in Pruszkow and I went out to buy something. Germans raided up the areas\nagain for young people to go to Germany to work, they were slaves. And men and women. They\nwere young, young men and women. And I was -- I went out. Irene was, stayed home with the\npeople I lived with. And just to buy something, and suddenly, you know, there were four Germans\nand they said, \u201cYou come with us.\u201d My heart stood still. I knew that if I, they\u2019re going to take me to\nGermany, Irene is lost. So I started to tell them that I have a sick child, Krankenkind,\u201d> and\nKrankenhaus,\u201d\u00b0 I was afraid, I didn\u2019t know German and I am afraid that I would put in some\nYiddish words, you know. Krankenkind, Krankenhaus, my Krankenkind, Krankenhaus. So they say\nto me, \u201cWhere is your husband?\u201d So I didn\u2019t think long and I said -- Blanca was in Heidelberg \u2014 so\n*\u00b0 Sick child (German).\n6 Hospital (German).\nI said, \u201cIn Heidelberg.\u201d \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d And I said, \u201cHe\u2019s a mechanic.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat\nfirm?\u201d Blanca and Maria worked at Walter Kinzel, so I said, the Walter Kinzel. And it went just like\nthat, and they believed me. So one -- I had one soldier this side, one this, one front and in the back,\nthe big fish they caught, you know, me. So, one soldier said from the left side, \u201cLet her go, she has a\nsick child.\u201d When I heard that, I turned around and I run, I just run. And this was my quick thinking,\nyou know, knowing the Heidelberg know; the Walter Kinzel also, that I can get, you know, I can\nshoot! This was it, but he -- the answer, \u201cHe\u2019s a mechanic.\u201d And I run away and I came home. I\nwas, was out, you know, couldn\u2019t breathe.",
        "Q: When you spoke to them, do you think you sounded frightened?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how I sounded, I just was thinking quickly, and I said, I was scared to\ndeath! I didn\u2019t \u2014 I was...I didn\u2019t know what to do, I can only talk to them, you know. I was sure that\nI\u2019m going.",
        "Q: Michal had a very close friend, you had a, you both had a very close friend, Frydrych?",
        "A: Zygmunt Frydrych, yeah.",
        "Q: And they made a pact?",
        "A: Yes, they made the pact before, you know, the uprising, you know, when the uprising started.\nThey met and they said -- he had a wife and a child, Elza. She was born in 1936, was Elza. And\nwhoever lived through will take care of the other wife and the children. This was their pact. And\nFrydrych told me about it. Frydrych told me about it, yeah. It was after, when I met him, when I\nalready knew about, what Vladka told me, you know, and both of them, when Frydrych was killed\ntaking out people from the canals, after the Warsaw ghetto uprising, there was a certain village and\nthey were caught and there were five people were killed at that time and he was among them. And\nhis wife perished in Majdanek, she was taken before that. And Elza was with Polish people and she\nwas first in a convent, and then, you know, Mirek Edelman and a whole group were just following.\nElza stayed in the convent, and then after the Polish uprising, she was shifted to another place.\nThere were a few places and she was sick and tired of it. She was a young child, very bright,\nintelligent, beautiful. And in the end she settled, you know, they gave her to a Smith (ph) and they\nloved her and they really wanted her and she felt good with them. And all the time, you know,\nchanging places and loosing her security. She was very angry and bitter about that.\nAnd after the war, when they came for her, Mirek Edelman came with his wife, Ala, to take her\naway from that Polish family, she didn\u2019t want to go because her parents told her, \u201cRemember, never\ntell anybody that you are Jewish.\u201d And she didn\u2019t know after the war, after the war ended, she didn\u2019t\nknow anything, and the woman didn\u2019t want to give her away. She wanted to have her as her child,\nas a child of her own and so they gave her a lot of money and this way, they took Elza. And then it\nstarted the whole thing again, you know, from place to place. I was for her a mother. She loved\nIrene and the pact was following me, to take care of Elza. And there is a family here, Shatzkin, who\nadopted her. She had a tragic life she couldn\u2019t shed. Nervous breakdowns. And she always was\ncoming to me on the vacation, she was in Cornell when the vacation came. She always visited, not\nwith her parents, adopted parents, but with us, with Irene and me. And they were like siblings, you\nknow. To me she was like a daughter, really. But she had a few nervous breakdowns and, in the end,\nshe went to the hospital. Also, she got married, a professor from Columbia. He\u2019s better known now,\na historian. And that Sunday morning when she went to the hospital, she called me up and she said,\n\u2018\u201cRozka, I am going to meet my father and mother,\u201d because she knew that it will be drilling about\nher past, her childhood, and this and that. And then she committed suicide. In 1962, she committed\nsuicide. This was Elza. Irka was at that time in Europe. She didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t want to write to\nher. She could never forgive me that, but I didn\u2019t want to, I was afraid. I was really afraid. So she\nfound out, not from me, after she came back. It was a pure accident, from somebody else, not\nmyself. I prepared myself to tell her on the weekend I am home, to be with her. Doesn\u2019t work like\nthat. This was Elza, you know? Because they were good friends. Zygmunt was the one who brought\nback the news about Treblinka, you know. Very active, very active guy. Nice people. So little by\nlittle, everything was shrinking.",
        "Q: When we ended the last tape, you began to talk about meeting Marek Edelman in Lodz and his\ntelling you about how Michal died?",
        "A: I met Marek before, as I told you, I took Irene in there. We went to them and this is how I got\nthrough it. Halina Sheffner, you know. I went to them and this was the first time I saw him --\nMarek. You know, still during the war, after the uprising. He told me at that time what happened.\nWhat happened is that the whole group was on a attic trying to get through to another building.\nThey didn\u2019t know that there was a German with a gun, you know, standing -- I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s\ncalled.",
        "Q: A machine gun?",
        "A: A machine gun, yeah. In a corner or where ever it was. And suddenly they realized and they\ncouldn\u2019t get through to the other building through the attics so Michal was the one. Michal was with\nMarek Edelman, the same group, was the one who jumped on him and killed him and the same time\nhe killed him. So the group could pass through, they survived, but Michal was killed. And the same\nevening, Marek Edelman buried Michal in the court, which now, later on, were ruins because the\nbuildings were burned and so on. But he gave him the funeral, you know. He just buried him over\nthere in the court, yeah. And this is what he told me at that time, when I went to visit him. But since\nI visited Mirek there, I got the contacted there, they gave me some money that I could have and I\nwas, could pay off some, which I was only, anyway I was doing some sewing there at night, being\nin Pruszkow, you know.\nThey give some money for our living, so I said, \u201cI can sew and I can do something for you,\u201d and she\nwas very happy about it. So I was sitting and sewing sometimes to two o\u2019clock at night, three\no\u2019clock at night and Irene was sleeping. It was only, you know, two rooms, one bedroom, was there.\nI was in the bedroom with Irene in one bed, another bed somebody else was sleeping there. And this\nis how it was.",
        "Q: So how long were you in Pruszkow then?",
        "A: In Pruszk6w I was since the Polish uprising and they took us out to the Chleniec, I told you, until\nthe Soviet army came and, to Warsaw and then to us. In Warsaw, they were before, they came\nbefore and then they came to us and when I was seeing the, see the Soviet army, I was standing and\ncrying, you know, because I knew that we will stay alive already, so how much, you know, I have\nagainst them, I cannot forget that they brought me to freedom. And this was already with when\npeople, I had the contacts with the people so people already started to find out that I and Irene,\nwhich is a miracle that she was alive, with me. Found out that we are here and Boleck Ellenbogen\nhe was in Lublin at that time, a lot of --during Pol -- the Polish uprising, they just swim through the\nVistula, Wisla, to the other side, to the East side, and they could, you know, the Soviets were there\nalready. They just, just didn\u2019t come during the Polish uprising, they didn\u2019t want to, they want to kill\neach other, why not? So Boleck found out where we are and he was working for the Jewish\nCommittee over there already in Lublin. And one day, he already knew the address, my address, a\ncar stops by, not a car but a heavy, what I call \u2014 what they call the \u201cciezar\u00e9wka.\u2019\u201d\u2019 The big, you\nknow, they come with, with --",
        "Q: Not a truck?",
        "A: Truck, yeah. He came with a truck and he brought me some food. Brought me all the goodies in\nthe world could be for Irene, and I remember he brought also cigarettes. I didn\u2019t smoke at that time\nalready. And chocolate and sardines and all kinds of things, and it was like, you know, manna from\nheaven. And I remember, I started to give Irene little by little the goodies, and Halina came so I\ngave her the cigarettes because she was smoking, heavily smoking. And I gave her all the goodies\nso Irene was, couldn\u2019t even reach the table but she was looking how Halina was eating, I gave her\nthis and I gave her that, so she asked me, \u201cMommy, will Pani Halina eat everything?\u201d So I said,\n\u201cNo, there are things for you too, don\u2019t worry.\u201d So this was, you know -- and he came twice with\nthe truck, you know, from Lublin. And he brought me food. And the third time came Marek\n7 Merchandise truck (Polish).\nEdelman, who took us to L\u00e9dz. We couldn\u2019t get trains to get to took us, it\u2019s not so easy to say.\nThere was one train a day and there were thousands, thousands of people so he took me and Irene.\nHe threw Irene through the window, somebody picked her up, then me, he carrying me, pushed also\nthrough the window and he somehow got to through a door, I don\u2019t know how. This was the way,\nthis was Mirek, you know? Always caring. This is how people, a whole group of people cared, you\nknow, when they knew somebody 1s, and they picked up Elza as I told you. People cared. Take\nBoleck, you know, how he came with food and all that. Because, first of all, a child alive at this time\nwas like, you know, a miracle. I was the only mother. There was also Gabrish, you know, Chana\nFryshdorf. They were in the partisans. But he was born in a bunker, born in the Polish uprising, and\nshe went out and she also was in that, but this was 1944 already. He was just born then. And she\nwas for a while, the Polish uprising finished, you know, it was -- and for a while she was in a village\nsomeplace.\nHe was the -- she looked like, you know, a hundred Jews. And the little one, the babies, nothing.\nBut after a while she came to Lodz to find out, she went to Warsaw and the committee was,\naddresses and names, she found out to be in L6dz so she came to L\u00e9dz and she found us, Chana\nFryshdorf. Her husband was killed in the partisans. He went for a project, you know. They had for\nthe trains to dynamite a train or something and was killed by the Germans and she stayed, you\nknow, pregnant with, there was the child. And she came to Lodz and she found us. She went back.\nShe brought Gaby, he was very sick also. He had some kind, around his ears, some infections all\naround his neck. And we stayed together since then, you know, this is the way. Gabrish (ph) 1s like a\nbrother to her, to Irka because Irka was the big sister. Another three years older, you know, that\u2019s\nall. Do you know? We created families. It was like one of us cared about the other, you know? And\nI had two, two towels I gave her one towel; two apples, I gave her one apple. For Gaby, you know,\nthis is, this is how it was. And we lived together. It was a while in Lodz after the war, we lived\ntogether. The Ellenbogens and Chana Fryshdorf and Halinka.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you a question about Irene during this period. She seemed from your description,\nthe little that you say about her, rather than your, your feelings about what\u2019s happening, is that in\nsome ways she was a calm child. That she was very good, that there was not, that she wasn\u2019t\ncreating \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- any problems in a very dangerous situation. As if she understood.",
        "A: No. She was just, you know, a good child, you know, and she was listening and I explained to\nher certain things. You cannot do this because of that, you know, in a very light way, not to scare\nher for anything. But she was listening. She didn\u2019t give me any trouble as a child. She was, she only\ngave me trouble later! But as a child, no, no. She was very good.\nShe was very sporty, too. Boleck in Sweden put her on a, on a bicycle and went on a hill and said,\n\u201cYou just hold the brakes and go down, and then stop.\u201d She did it. Said to me, he said, \u201cYou go\nhome. You go in, I'll take care of her.\u201d So, this was that. She was going swimming there in Sweden.\nThat is why this is a different chapter already.",
        "Q: When you all meet in Lodz and you\u2019re essentially forming surrogate families because people\nhave lost, what is this like? Is there a lot of anger as well as pain about the world?",
        "A: We were so busy with every day life: how to get through, how to bring a -- let\u2019s say Chana and I.\nThen I got an apartment -- no -- I lived with Boleck, the Ellenbogens. My one removed cousin met\nme, he was in the Polish army. And he was always in the uniform. He wasn\u2019t in the army anymore,\nbut he was very tall, handsome, and he went to all these officers and he said, \u201cZychlinski, I am\nZychlinski, General Zychlinski,\u201d or something like that. \u201cI need an apartment.\u201d They gave him.\n\u201cThis was in my name because nobody could get apartments at that time. I said that \u201cI am a widow\nwith a child and I need an apartment.\u201d And then, you know it was a one bedroom apartment and I\ntook in the Ellenbogens. The apartment was in my name, and he was working for the Journal at that\ntime, and from Lodz for the Committee. And we lived together as a family. Whatever we had, you\nknow, brought in, we gave the money. I got some money, very little, but I remember that the Zared\n(ph) -- this is from the Bundist Committee -- they send me some money at that time and then my\nfamily, my aunt, Michal\u2019s aunt from the States, used to send me a few dollars here and there, but it\nwent all to the common, you know, account. That\u2019s all. And this is how we lived there. It was, you\nknow, a family. Boleck used to go with Irene, you know, for walks. We used to do some sewing and\nat home for somebody. Anna also with me, and this is how we lived.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to be in Poland during that period?",
        "A: Yes, once Irene was playing downstairs with the children and she came up and she said, \u201cMa!\nThis boy told -- called me \u2018zydowka,\u201d\u201d\u201d\u00ae -- you know -- Jewess. \u201cWhat does it mean, \u2018zydowka\u2019?\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t understand that. But this is an example, a child comes up. And then there were\nconstantly killings, they were killing, murders. And we decided to go away at that time. It was\nantisemitism, it was. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they finish up everybody?\u201d So it wasn\u2019t easy, but to Lodz came a\nlot of people. The same thing to Warsaw, the survivors looking for the families; they stayed here or\nthere. In all kind, but the atmosphere was very bad. Then we decided, the, the Jacob Patt came to\nPoland and he said that he can take, give some visas, you know? To Sweden. Sweden was taking in\npeople. And of course, I gave -- I was on the list with Irene because of Michal\u2019s aunt here. But to\ntell you about the atmosphere, to go by train to Gdynia, this is the port of Poland. There we could\ntake the boat to Sweden. Two women, Polish women, went with us, we with children. It was Chana\nFryshdorf, Gaby, and I was with Irene in our, in our train. In case something happens, \u201cThis 1s their\nchildren,\u201d because they were taking down people from the trains and killing. So, once came\nsomebody to our apartment with a gun and looking for somebody. Luckily, it was a mistake. You\nknow, Boleck was at that time; I was at that time, Irene was asleep, it was in the evening. To kill\nsomebody because they had some kind of account, who knows? But it was very dangerous. Kielce.\nYou know about Kielce? This was 1946! We left 1946, the first, the 31\u00b0 of March, I think so. So\nthis was very dangerous to live. So we had, it was us, some Polish people to go with us in case the\nchildren are not theirs. Always the children and if they take us, okay, but the children are there. So\nthis is how it was, you know, in Poland.\n*8 Jewess (Polish).",
        "Q: And what was it like in Sweden?",
        "A: Sweden was, Agonide (ph), it was Eden. Really Eden. Irene used to say that this was my\nhappiest years in my life. It was beautiful. Sweden was so, you know, like -- first of all, from\nStockholm we were, how many \u2014 21 minutes I think from Stockholm by train, a choo-choo train.\nBeautiful. It was really like Eden, you know. The children were wonderful there. This is where\nIrene was going bicycling and swimming and school. She spoke Swedish like a Swedish-born child\nimmediately. She went to school. The people were very nice to us. They always invited me and\nIrene for coffee and cookies and she was playing with the children then. She spoke. We didn\u2019t never\nlock the doors at night. When Chana said, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy some milk at the store,\u201d you know\ncountry store, and she gave her a little, you know, back with a few Swedish crowns, she said,\n\u201cWhere is your bag?\u201d A pocket book, Irene had. \u201cOh, I left it on the bench over there.\u201d I said, \u201cGo\nand pick it up.\u201d She said, \u201cNaw, [ll take it tomorrow.\u201d She found it tomorrow. So, this was the kind\nof life, you know. It was nature around. She was playing with Gaby and she was going by herself\nwith the bicycle, swimming over the, the, the, the trains, you know, were passing by, people were\nmarvelous there, really. And we had a whole group. I was always, I don\u2019t like to live in groups, so\nwe had two buildings. One was a big building with a lot of survivors and we were only three\nfamilies in this building, you know, where we lived. And it was marvelous. Everybody cared about\nthe other and we could go to the city with Chana and Chana\u2019s brother\u2019s wife took care of the\nchildren, to go to sleep, you know, or something like that.\nWe started to work, both. She was a very good children\u2019s dressmaker. So we went to the biggest\nstore in Melbourne, in Melbourne. This is Australia already. I was in Australia for a time. And this\nis in Stockholm, and we did some work for them. And then we sent it by mail, by, by, by the train,\nthey picked it up and they send it. This is how we, but it was very, very close. I created a library\nthere.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: In Stockholm.",
        "Q: Um-hm.",
        "A: This was the Jewish Labor Committee branch and there were lots of survivors in Sweden. And\neverybody was longing for a book, for Yiddish book, for a Polish book, or something like that. I\nwrote the Jewish Labor Committee to send me books, a lot of books. They sent hundreds of books,\nthey did send. And I made catalogs, you know, and addresses I had, I sent them the catalogs, copies\nof catalogs, everything by hand. And they wrote me what they want, with numbers, they wrote me\nback what they want, and then I prepared the books and the office of the Jewish Labor Committee\nsent them out in the morning. But this was in the evening, I was going to Stockholm. It wasn\u2019t\nduring the day, I was busy with, I had Irene and whatever I had to do. But this I was doing for over\nthree years in Sweden, you know. But we had a whole group of friends and, over there. And this is\nhow we \u2014 that we came here.",
        "Q: And when did you come here?",
        "A: I came here the 11th of April, 1949. I came here on the suppose to pass by United States and to\ngo to Australia, I had a permit to Australia, thinking that I would go to Australia. I had my family in\nAustralia, at that time. My sister was in Australia already.",
        "Q: Which sister was this?",
        "A: Anka, yes. Gina perished, you know. And I had only ten days. Chana Fryshdorf left two months\nbefore. Through a certain way, you know? But she couldn\u2019t take Gaby. When she comes to the\nStates she could claim Gaby, to bring him over there. So Gaby stayed with me for two months.\nAnd meanwhile, Sweden also, I was, you know, learning English because I knew where ever I land,\nI need to know the English. So a woman, a German woman was a teacher of English. She used to\ncome to our neglingon (ph), the place called, and giving lessons. So there were groups, but I had to\nbe alone. I went a full hour, not with a group, and I learned. I learned grammar, I read Steinbeck\nalready.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: But this was British English. Another thing, when I came here and I opened the radio and I\ncouldn\u2019t understand a word, I started to cry because this was the American English and I learned, I\nlearned British English. I couldn\u2019t speak, you know, but I was reading and writing. So this was also,\nyou know, what we did in Sweden. So I came here and I brought Gaby with me, which was a nice\nthing, on the boat. At that time, in 1949, it was an order from the immigration department that\nnobody can land in New York, only first have got to Ellis Island. This was order and no, even with\nvisas, not only passing by, cannot go. I didn\u2019t know about it. Nobody told me. Gaby was secured,\n\u201c\u2018bamaters (ph)\u201d as here, you know? She was legally, you know, here. But I didn\u2019t know about it at\nall. And during the passage, there was a young woman who really was with me constantly. She was\ngoing on a regular, not a legal visa, to her sister here. But she was so, she was from a camp or\nsomething, very depressed. But I took her under my wing, so, I said, \u201cYou have to go to the doctors,\nthere was this child, you go first to the doctors.\u201d I gave her one child, she go before me and I went\nafter that. This kind of thing. And her sister was also there when we arrived. They let them come on\nthe boat, you know, aboard. So, and I said that they keep her, they don\u2019t let her go, she has to go to\nEllis Island. From Ellis Island she can go to her sister. I wondered why, but I couldn\u2019t talk to her\nbecause I was the next one. So, Chana Fryshdorf was there with Bernard Goldstein (ph), was\nanother one, survivor, also.\nAnd so, first of all, I clear Gaby. I said, \u201cThe mother is here, she can pick him up,\u201d you know, the\nmother. And Gaby is through. Then I come and I supposed to go, Gaby shouldn\u2019t have gone to Ellis\nIsland as a child, but all the other passengers with visas, legal visas, had to go to Ellis Island, from\nEllis Island they had to release them. Next, I come. So, I give my passport, all these documents for\nclearing and he said, \u201cNow, you go to Ellis Island.\u201d He talked fast. So I said to him, it was my\nkhutspe, I said, \u201cYou speak very good English but too fast.\u201d He take the stamps, he put \u2018pass\u2019. Can\nyou imagine such a thing? I was the only one with Irene who passed. If I would go to Ellis Island, I\nwouldn\u2019t be here today, because I only had 10 days and they send everybody out. In transit, I was in\ntransit. But this is what I said, this is what works. My khutspe, I said, \u201cYou speak very good\nEnglish, but too fast.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what this Ellis Island, I didn\u2019t know what he is talking about.\nAnd I got stamped \u2018pass\u2019. So this is how I came here.",
        "Q: To New York?",
        "A: Yeah. Australia was for me too far. From what, and from whom, I don\u2019t know, up to now. I was\nfour times in Australia. Every 10 years I was going to Australia.",
        "Q: You -- it didn\u2019t str -- you mean you didn\u2019t feel as if you should be near your sister or that was\nimportant?",
        "A: No. I was afraid that for Irene it wouldn\u2019t be good somehow. I don\u2019t know why. Far, far away,\nAustralia. Who knows about Australia?",
        "Q: Makes sense. Was New York Eden, too, like Sweden?",
        "A: Oh, no. I had a very hard time, very hard time. Until I established myself -- who I am, what I am.\nWith Irene being a child and this English she didn\u2019t know at all. It was very difficult. She was very\nsensitive for me going away to work and being alone. It was a very difficult period for me. Very\ndifficult.",
        "Q: Were you more alone in New York or just \u2014 were there, were there other people?",
        "A: The circumstances, you know? The stretches of, between one and the other. It was, I got the\napartment amalgamated. It\u2019s a beautiful apartment but, you know, because they, they cared. The\nJewish Labor Committee brought me over. So this is -- I had a very difficult time here. The\nbeginning was very, I didn\u2019t know what to do and Irene, first of all, you know, Irene, I was afraid to\nleave her. The school, she was scared, she was very scared. See, we came in April, the 11th of\nApril, and Dr. Patt arranged for her to go to the workman\u2019s circle camp for the summer. In fact, she\nwent. She spoke the beautiful Swedish. She went to the camp, she lost the Swedish and came back\nwith an English, you know? Just like that.",
        "Q: Just like that. So then?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t, you know, when she came to school, I put her in school, nearby. This was nearby. So\nthe teacher wrote about her. Here today came to our class a little girl with two braids, with two bows\nand a bow on top, you know. Very, very, very sweet, something like that, you know. And she didn\u2019t\nknow. I remember that once was, you know, the fire alarm. You know, the children run out and I\nrun out because I was afraid, I heard it, that she\u2019ll be scared and this girl was scared of this. Again,\nyou know, because she knew about the bombarding and that. She was very much scared. It was not\ngood for her, for me going away in that sense. I started to work in the designing room because I was\nvery good with my hand always. Was working for a while and she was alone home and I had to rent\nthe bedroom. We were sleeping in the living room because the rent was fifty dollars and I couldn\u2019t\nspend the 50 dollars. So I was working, sewing, and it was very difficult, very difficult. And then I\nstarted to work at the YIVO,\u2019\u2019, you know, because of the director of the YIVO. With the\nConference of Claims, you know. They started to get the money and he knew me from Poland. Dr.\nFriedman, Philip Friedman.",
        "Q: Phil Friedman?",
        "A: Yes. He knew me from Poland. And he got in touch with me, he wanted me to work for him, so\nand I worked for him. Since then, I was working for eight years at the YIVO, on Holocaust all the\ntime. Then he died in 1960.",
        "Q: Is it that when you created the bibliography\u2019? Is that the first bibliography?",
        "A: Yes. You\u2019ll see my name there.",
        "Q: We saw it yesterday.\n*\u201d Yidisher Vinshaftlekher Institut [Yiddish Scientific Institute] (Yiddish).",
        "A: Really?",
        "Q: Yeah. In very large print.",
        "A: Yeah, and then took over, Dr. Robinson took it over, after his death. And I was working in the\npublic library, you know, looking for material constantly. For months, I was working at the public\nlibrary. And he -- Dr. Robinson -- used to come and put material. He gave me new material to work\non, constantly. So, until 1962 I was working in at the YIVO. And one day, Dr. Robinson\napproached me. I was his right hand, you know? Same thing as Friedman, also. And he approached\nme, said that somebody approached him from the Joint.\u00b0\u00b0 They need a person for the archives,\nwhether he has somebody. And he told me that I have chosen you. I was shocked. I said, \u201cDr.\nRobinson, why do you want to get rid of me? Is something wrong?\u201d He said no. He put his arms\naround me and said, \u201cI know you have a daughter. You have no insurance here. We\u2019ll probably\nfinish in 1964,\u201d because it was ten years the claims confidence gave money for this project and this\nwill be it. \u201cYou might stay in the YIVO, but you won\u2019t ever have the insurance, health insurance,\u201d\nor, you know, the wages -- I was making 60 dollars a week. And, but she had everything. Irene had\nalways everything, you know. She didn\u2019t feel it. And, \u201cThere is a good possibility for you.\u201d There\nwas 35 people in our plant. I was shocked: \u201cWhy do you want to get rid of me?\u201d Anyway, so I\nspoke to Dr. Patt. He was a very good friend of mine. Excellent friend who take care of Irka, you\nknow, Pel\u2019s (ph) wife. Meanwhile, I got sick again, you know, my thyroid.",
        "Q: Your thyroid again?",
        "A: Yes. And so I spoke to him, I said, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you yesterday\nthere.\u201d\u2019 And I trusted him because he took really good care of us. Hyman (ph) Helswise (ph) and his\nfriend, a very close friend was. And this way, you know, I left the YIVO. They made me a party.\nJoint Distribution Committee\nHave a beautiful crystal from that. There was a beautiful speech from Dr. Robinson, you know, and\nI went to the Joint. Then it\u2019s sad that it\u2019s a new era.",
        "Q: And life got better for you, also?",
        "A: Yes. I could make more money if I would have the khutspe to ask. If I made 4000 the YIVO, I\nasked for 5000. I could ask for 7000. I didn\u2019t. They grabbed me because of the recommendation of\nDr. Robinson, you know. He came once. I asked him to come and take a look what I am doing\nbecause I put in a new system. Completely. And he approved everything. So this way, you know, it\nwas because first of all I had insurance. For me, for her. That\u2019s very important. The work was very\ngratifying. So was at the YIVO, the working. Very gratifying for me. So this is a new era started.",
        "Q: And you were there for 23 years?",
        "A: Only.",
        "Q: Only!",
        "A: Only, yeah. Up to now I am in contact with \u2014 they constantly send me, you know, the Katzki\naffair. It was sixty years of Katzki and to my, executive director treated me, you know, also, and he\nsaid, \u201cMrs. Klepfisz, you don\u2019t know how much we are missing you here. Such a mess.\u201d They\ndidn\u2019t print one single catalog since my going away. I left six catalogs of described material at the\narchives. Six catalogs. No, not one.",

I understand how hard it has to be to face the deaths of so many people that are so\nclose to you. I guess what I\u2019m, I\u2019m wondering is, what allowed you to keep going under those\ncircumstances, especially after you found out that Michal was killed?",
        "A: Well, the child. Just the child, you know. I was just devastated with, with all my family gone.\nThis is the only thing, you know, which I can keep alive was the child. And everything in my power\nI did to keep her alive, you know? Because of that, I had to live. Otherwise I would be, I was\ncompletely devastated, you know. If not this, what\u2019s holding me, I would just give up. What will be\nwill be. I wouldn\u2019t do anything else.",

        "A: Well, Pll tell you something. If I would have to tell this story, you know, what really, with what\nhappened all the time it would take, I don\u2019t even know whether I could find the real words to\ndescribe. I don\u2019t think we have -- we don\u2019t have the vocabulary, all these words to describe what we\nlived through. And sometimes I wonder now, and I spoke about it to some friends. I really don\u2019t\nknow from where I took all the strength to get through all these years. I really don\u2019t know. And I\ncannot understand how I did it. I really can\u2019t understand how I did it. It was by, what kind of force\nwas pushing me to do this or that, to decide, all kinds of things, which came out good decisions, but\nI don\u2019t know. I really, and to describe the feelings, the life, what we went through, I don\u2019t think\nthere is a real vocabulary that has all the words for it.",
        "Q: Well, I know how hard this was for you and I know how much you didn\u2019t want to do it, but I\nwant to thank you for being willing to do it.",

The east side of Poland because maybe still the Poland will win the war with the Germans.\nAnd so did Michal and all the husbands. Only the oldest one, Genia and Dubnikow, they went\ntogether; they didn\u2019t leave. Anka stayed and Guta stayed and I stayed and all of them left. They\nwent, Michal left with his two friends.

So then, after a few weeks, they came back. Besides, Genia\ndid not come back, Bachrach didn\u2019t come back, but he sent for my sister and the baby somehow.\nPeople were traveling back and forth, you know, through the borders between Russia and Germany,\nback and forth. So Anka left to Vilna, they were in Vilna. Genia was in Dobno, this was Ukrainian,\nand then Guta left with Buziek, so it was her husband, also to the Ukraine. And I stayed, I was there\nand Krysia had a boyfriend and she also left. So when Michal came back, I took my mother to our\nhousehold and we stayed together.

        "A: And then also we had to move from our apartment to the ghetto. So, at that time I was already\nvery sick and I was out of action. I was \u2014",
        "A: Thyroid because my eyes at that time became permanent, permanent, you know, I never had this\nkind of, this was with the sickness. My heart, I was sick, I was, I was very sick. But this was already\nafter Irene was born.",

But at that time, we got tremendous\nroom from somebody they knew, my mo-- mother-in-law and my father-in-law, from people who\nhad a tremendous apartment, six rooms, something like that. And we got about two rooms, it was a\none room later but divided into two rooms over there when she went to Jerska. This is where we all\nlived together.",

Her husband was also an\neditor in the Folks-tsaytung,\u2019 you know. Very nice man but he died before that.

        "A: It was a tremendous shock to everybody because the Germans came into the streets, they were\nkilling just like that. They were tearing beards, you know, from the Jews. They were coming at\nnight and taking out people from the houses. There were raids around the few blocks and taking\npeople for work, to do this, to do that.\nBefore they started to take them to concentration camps. All kind of work. It was unbelievable what\nwas going on in the streets. The fear. People didn\u2019t have anything to eat. Immediately the stores\nwould close. The Germans took away everything they could. They came into the stores and into the\nhomes and just like that. Didn\u2019t do anything and it was terrible. There were keys, you know, to\nstand in line, to get something. The, the Jewish, the Judenrat\u00ae -- it wasn\u2019t the Judenrat yet but, you\nknow, the people who worked before in the Judenrat tried to keep everything together. But you\nknow about the story about Czerniak6w, who committed suicide, because they said you have to\ndeliver so and so, many people, for this, this and that. He couldn\u2019t do it because he knew it was for\n\u2019 People\u2019s paper (Yiddish).\n\u00ae Jewish Council (German).\neither camp or that, and he committed suicide. Others stayed, but then Jewish Police came. It was, it\nwas a terrible thing. You can\u2019t even imagine what was going on. And we didn\u2019t have, I know that\nmy mother-in-law was selling and selling and selling what we had. Anything goes! And people\ncame from the Aryan side, they let them in, they paid to the, even Germans were sending them, the\nguards were watching. They came in, they were buying up things. It was a tremendous tragedy,\ntragedy, completely tragic. And then, started to sh -- to sh -- to see that people in the streets, the\nchildren begging, running around. Some didn\u2019t have already any strength to run around. I was a lot\nsick at that time. First of all, I gave birth, you know, and then I started, you know, with my thyroid. I\nwas taken to the hospital.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I got sick, yeah.",
        "A: I got sick after that, after I gave birth, I got sick. I was afraid what\u2019s going to happen. The stress,\nthyroid, the stress, you know. What will, what will happen happen to Irene, what about this, and\nMichal will be taken away. You just, you live without tomorrow. You saw the next hour, you live.\nAnd this was, was a terrible, the hospital. There was no, when I was operated on, there was no\nantibiotics at all. They cut me all over because I was full of, you know, infection here, full. And it\nwas one millimeter from my main vein and the doctor, Arik Heller, as I spoke, is in Sweden now, he\nwas at the operation. He was altogether, so that I am a miracle that I am alive. But this was, Irene\nwas about at that time a few months old. It was a terrible, you didn\u2019t know what tomorrow will\nbring. The raids were tremendous. They, they surrounded, you know, blocks and blocks and you\ncouldn\u2019t get out and everybody, the old people went, one side to the camps. The young ones went\nhere. They were, you couldn\u2019t even figure out what\u2019s going to happen. What should I do? Nobody\nknew. We, we knew one thing, we were all going to perish.",
        "A: Was going on everyday. They come up, you know, Michal was constantly running to the\nunderground, everyday. And keeping with them, what\u2019s going on and so on. The first thing he came\nback, I said, \u201cWhat about England? What about America? Did you hear anything? They\u2019re not\ngoing to help?\u201d That was all... We were all surprised. So this 1s, it was a tragic, it was a very tragic\ntime. They were killing and killing and killing. And more and more dead, in the streets. Constantly.\nAnd raids and then the Judenrat started to try to get a little organized and the Jewish Militia came\nand they were, they were so corrupted.\nBecause they said, \u201cIf you bring a certain amount of Jews, your family will stay alive.\u201d You know,\nthe oldest tricks. They believed in it, and they brought -- nothing helped. There were a few, you\nknow, the Bund underground killed a few policeman for that.

        "A: So, this is, and then when I was in the, in the hospital at that time, it wasn\u2019t a hospital, it was the,\nthe, the Pen Club, a tremendous apartment there and they made it a hospital in the ghetto. As I told\nyou, they didn\u2019t have any medications but they had to operate on me. And I was lying in the room\nfor the nurses, which is as, as narrow as this is, you know, but they put a cot there for me so I\nwouldn\u2019t be with all these people and the doctors came to me there, you know, too. There came a\nday when they said that they are going to take away the hospitals and my doctors were the best of\nthe surgeons in Warsaw because of the nurses and Gina, you know, knew them and she wanted\nthem to operate on me. They were taken the night before from their houses, away, and never heard\nof them bef-- later on. And the next day, the whole hospital will be evacuated, with the sick, you\nknow, to get away with them. So Gina and Michal came the day before and they put, we were on\nthe third floor, they put their hands like that, they put their hands and brought me up to the house at\nthat time.",

        "A: Okay.\nTape 2",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a matter of learning my Polish languages, it came naturally from the moment I was\nborn and raised, we spoke Polish, you know. It was the parents spoke Yiddish. But the main,\nreally, conversations was among us, it was always in Polish. And when I went to school, I was\nsuppose to go to school, there was a, there was a question. Should I go to a Folkshule,'? which\nwas in Yiddish, or should I go to a public school in Polish? And my sister, the oldest one, was a\nteacher herself. Said, absolutely to the Polish school, because I don\u2019t want her to go into the\nstreet and be afraid that somebody\u2019s going to beat her up when she speaks Yiddish. And this was\nthe general atmosphere, you know. But some people, the Folkshule was very popular among the\nworkers, you know, the Bundists particular. There was also the Poale Zion schools in Yiddish.\nNellie\u2019s (ph) mother was the teacher in the Poale Zion, but in my family they said, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d\nmy sister said, the oldest one, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d And my mother and father, you know, went\nalong with my sister, you know. She was a teacher, she knew what\u2019s going on in the, in the\nschools and so on, and I went to a public school in Polish. Because this was if you speak\nYiddish, you know, you are always in risk. And they didn\u2019t want me to have this as a main\nlanguage.\n'0 Elementary school (Yiddish).",
        "A: Yes. As I told you before, I was cataloging, and, you know, putting in categories different\nbooks. And the workers came and, and always ask, \u201cCould you give me a good book, something\nto read?\u201d And when I spoke to the director of the library, he said to me, \u201cRozka, why won\u2019t you\nwrite out a list of 100 books so when the people come in and want to take a book out, they could\nsee the list, what they should take.\u201d\nAnd I decided to do that. So, I put down a list of 103 books I know exactly, from different\ncategories, categories and countries. And there was the Scandinavian countries and American\nliterature and, of course, Polish literature, French, all kind. Everything in translation, of course,\ninto Polish, not in the original languages. So I put down a list of 103 books, and Russian\nliterature was a very, very modern at the time, to read the Russian, the Russian literature\ntranslated into Polish. And I went to Mrs. Dobnow. Erlich. Dobnow was the daughter of the\nfamous historian Dubnow, wrote the history of the Jews. And she was herself a poet. She was\nwriting poetry in still Russian and knew excellent Polish literature -- altogether a very intelligent\nand very well educated. His two sons were professors, one of Columbia and the one is who\npassed away and the one is in Yale. And she was there, I made an appointment with her, and I\nsaid, \u201cMrs. Dubnow, I want to come and have your opinion,\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to rely on\nmyself, that this is right. So I left with her the list of 100 books and she studied it. Then she, I\ncalled her, and she said, \u201cWould you come up? Let\u2019s have a discussion about it.\u201d\u201d And there she\naccepted the 100 books, but one which was called, Cztowiek Zmienia S\u2019ku\u2019re.'! In English, it\n'l Bruno Jasienski\u2019s book\u2019s English title is A Man Changes His Skin.\nwould be \u201ca person changes his skin.\u201d It means that becoming \u2014 changing his ideas, his ideology.\nThis is what it means, that a person changes his skin. She didn\u2019t want to put it in. She didn\u2019t want\n\u2014 she was a little bit, you know... She was a Bundist, but she didn\u2019t want to start with the\nCommunists. This was my feeling at that time, as young as I was. And I felt it should be there.\nAnd we had a big discussion about it. And she told me, \"If you feel so strongly about it, let\u2019s\nleave it.\u201d It was written by Bruno Jasienski, who was a Communist once and he -- who believed\nin Christ that have to help people and so on. The funniest this was when I came to the United\nStates, and I came to visit her, so she says to me, \u201cIf you feel so strongly about it, let's leave it.\u201d\nThe funniest thing was when I came to the United States and I came to visit her. So she says to\nme, \u201cRozka, I remember how you argued with me about that book, that we had the discussion\nabout that book.\u201d I was beside myself. How could she remember such a stupid thing and the\nkhutspe\u2019\u201d of me, you know, to argue with her when she says let's take it out. I had three other\nbooks in case, but this was -- I was glad that she remembered.",
        "A: True, yeah. She says, \u201cIf you feel so strongly about it.\u201d She let me in [indecipherable].\nNothing would happen, but she wanted to make her point and -- and I -- I stood up, you know, by\nthat.",

And we're standing,\nuntil everybody pass by. It's hard to describe. When they pass by, we cross the street and there\nwas an empty building already. Everything was open. And we hid there for awhile.

When she looked at us, she paled -- she was pale. She\nwas afraid, you know, went there. And we told her that it's only for a few days until we find\nsomething. Didn't have any papers, nothing. We took off all the armbands and this is how we\ndid. In the column, as we were marching, we took off the -- the -- the bands, you know and --\nand this is how we got there.

And when the -- the woman, the\npeasant, she saw this, she says, \u201cWe give it to the pigs, why do you give it to the baby?\u201d You\nknow, this kind of things, very primitive, but kind. And I think that the soltys, you know what's\nthe soltis, the eldest of the village, who was getting on everything, I think that he guessed who I\nam, but he never said anything. But one day, he came and he said, \u201c\u201cThe Germans are coming for\nthe boys and girls. It would be good for you to escape here from here with the child. I think I\nwrote about it, you read it. Michal isn't here, I have no address for Michal. He was one right\nhere, one right there, didn't know what to do. I had a few, you know, Polish zlotys, but didn't\nknow what to do and I had to go, because if he came to me and said it in a nice way, that he\ndidn't want me, you know, to -- he knew that I wouldn't survive with the child. He said I have to\ndisappear, I have to disappear. And he said, that peasant said there is a brother of the -- his wife\nin -- near Tuszcz. Tuszcz 1s -- was the station where the train stopped for Treblinka, you know.\nTuszcz, Malkinia and Treblinka, this was the -- the route. \u201cHe's a smith (ph), you know and so\nwe can take you there. And maybe until your husband will come, he'll find you.\u201d Well, it was\nquite a few miles. I was carrying Irene you know, with the rest of my, of my strengths. He was\ncarrying a little package what I had, you know, diapers, this. And we came there. Well, they\nwere very nice to us because, you know, he says my husband should come, you know and they'll\ntake me away, it's only a matter of a few days. So she was very nice. But somebody pass by from\nthe village where I was before, in the Gleb- Gleboczyce, who said, \u201cShe was there, why is she\nhere? She is probably Jewish.\u201d This was it. So she came in, the wife and said, \u201cYou cannot stay\nhere any more. You have to go.\u201d And then I decided to go to Warsaw. What do I do? I don't\nknow where, no address, no nothing. And Michal wouldn't know where I am. So I said, \u201cOkay,\ntomorrow I'll go. You'll take me there to the station and I'll go.\u201d So then I put Irene to sleep for a\nnap before the trip. Trip supposed to be one o'clock, two o'clock, I don't remember. And she slept\nand I was standing at the window and I was crying. And suddenly I see somebody passing by.\nMichal. And I started to run after him, until I came out. He was very fast walking, he didn't know\nanything, you know. And -- and he didn't hear me, and he didn't hear me screaming, \u201cMichal.\u201d\nSo I took a stone, I threw at him. So then he turned around, said, \u201cWhat you doing here?\u201d And I\ntold him the whole story. This was a miracle, complete miracle. So he came into the apartment\nand then the -- when the smith (ph), you know, he said, you know, was talking to him and just\nlooking him up and down and he said, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d And he says, \u201cOh, I am a mechanic,\nyou know, this, that.\u201d So he looks at his hand and said, \u201c\u201cYou are not a mechanic. Doesn't look\nlike it.\u201d And we left. I with Michal, we left. And he took me to pref -- you know, we're afraid of\nthe train, you know. People were -- this was a station where everybody was running here and\nthere. So he took me there, he took me to Warsaw, we took a -- a carriage, you know, a -- s-same\nis standing in Central Park. And we got off about two blocks before it's destination, which was a\nvery old -- she was a concierge, that woman and the -- for that building where he took me. And\nthis was a very narrow, little room where there were already three woman living. The -- the\nowner -- the -- the -- the concierge with a little boy and I come and with Irene and Michal. He\nfound it, somebody told him, but he lived not far away, one block away. He lived there, lived,\nyou know, slept. This was the -- the -- the worker where he -- whom he met in the street, what\nare you doing, and he gave him -- said threw he can stay with him. He was very nice too, that\nman. He was helping for awhile and then he changed his mind and started to talk. So we -- we\nwent there and I had the little narrow bed for Irene and myself and we contacted the -- Gina, she\nwas working in Warsaw. And Gina came, you know and what do we do? We cannot stay here,\neverybody will know. And we decided to separate Irene from us, for her to be safe. Cause we\nknew that we'll perish, this way, another way. It's impossible to live through the whole thing,\nimpossible. So let Irene stay, you know, at least. And we talked it over with Gina, and Gina said,\n\u201cT have somebody.\u201d And she said, where she gave her exam for nursing -- which was\ninternational -- the Ministry, she had to go through the Ministry of -- of Health and Education,\nDr. Zachert. \u201cShe seemed to me a very nice person,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen she -- when she examined\nme. I'll call her.\u201d She called her, she had already papers and she called her and she said that her --\nshe want to see her, because she want to -- advice from her. She said, \u201cOf course, come.\u201d A very\nnice person. And she went up and when she told her over the phone that she's on the Juzwiak. So\nshe said, \u201cYou are not Juzwiak. You are a Gina Klepfisz. Please come in.\u201d And she told her the\nstory, she has a brother and a sister-in-law and a baby and sad situation, what can we do? She\nwas also the director of the orphanage, Boduena. Priest Boduen was called. She says, \u201cI can take\nthe baby to the orphanage as an orphan, but not knowing that she's an orphan and she has to be\nleft in the street and I'll take her over.\u201d And here starts the whole thing.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\nBeginning of Tape 1, Side B",
        "A: All right, let's -- let's stop for a moment. Okay?",
        "A: A year and a half. But she talked already, you know and she was very bright and very bright,\nmusical, very bright. And she could sing, you know, with what we're singing, you know, the\nmelodies. And the words, sometimes. Then Gina asked Dr. Sachat what's going to happen to me?\nSo she says, \u201cI have a sister with thr -- with three children.\u201d They are also belong to the, you\nknow, the people's party, Partja Ludowa, which were more, you know, li -- Catholics, deep\nCatholics, you know. But -- believed in Christ, that have to help people and so on. And she said,\n\u201cMaybe she'll come there, you know, and be the housekeeper, the maid.\u201d And she -- she said that\nwe have to -- I -- \u201cShe'll have to be reviewed, to have a few reviews with them,\u201d you know, my\nPolish, my behavior, my -- of course, a big asticulation (ph) all with Jews have all together. \u201cAnd\nthis would be a good place for her. And they have to look at her, how she looks.\u201d My eyes were\nalready prominent at that time. You'll see another picture of me before that, was because of\nthyroid. Again, I immediately knew what it is, you know, when I got up in the morning and my\neyes were prominent. Never had this kind of eyes. So I went there, was there three times,\ninterview. Meanwhile, before that I was in that room, where I lived, you know, where I be --\ncame from, with all these women. They were prostitute and they had all her -- their business in\nthe streets. They came in the middle of the night, or whatever. I didn't know about it. I wouldn't\neven think about 1t, Michal didn't know about it. And one evening was very -- what -- was very\nrainy, you know and they couldn't do their business in the street, so they invited two -- two men,\nyou know. And there was like a curtain over their bed and I was sitting there and reading, what\ndo I do? I was reading something. Someone said, \u201cWhy can't she give?\u201d \u201cLeave her alone, she\nhas a husband.\u201d \u201cSo, what's this?\u201d But [indecipherable] have to go. So I told them that next time,\nthat when they have some guests in their house, to let me know and I will go out. And they did it\none day, it was very cold or something like that. And they said to me, \u201cTake only five, 10\nminutes, can come back, but don't go around.\u201d They were very good people, very good women,\nreally. They loved Irene. She didn't cry at night, you know, all the time. So they told me to go\nand I went out and I was walking around the block, it was evening, around the blocks, I wasn't\nafraid that somebody can catch me. And I was walking probably for a half an hour or more,\neven. And then I hear somebody grabs me. It was one of the -- said, \u201cWhat do you think, going\nin such a cold time, all around? Why don't you come back? I told you take only five, 10 minutes,\nthat's all. You -- you can get, you know, a pneumonia or something like that, come in.\u201d This\nwere the women. Then when -- also when I gave away the baby, you know, when I said it's\ngoing to my cousin, Hearanther (ph) says, \u201cWhy did you do that? We could take care of her if\nyou wouldn't, you know.\u201d And we said, \u201cI'm going to work, he is going to work,\u201d you know, if a\nJew wouldn't be able to take it, \u201cWe would take care of them.\u201d They were good women. And\nthey loved Irene, you know, because she didn't cry, they\nwere afraid in the beginning that, who knows, the baby will cry, but -- so this was the story\nbefore I went for the interviews.",
        "A: About two weeks, probably. Probably two weeks, cause we arranged with Irene quite fast.\nWere afraid for every day, somebody would say, \u201cThat Jews,\u201d so they would take away it. So\nGina arranged it, you know and Dr. Sachat. And I was waiting for about two weeks, I would say.",
        "A: Not at that time.",
        "A: Not at that time, no. No, not at that -- that time. But I knew that she will take care of her, I\nknew that.",
        "A: I trust, absolutely yeah. I trust that she's safe there. This is why I did it. If I would have any\ndoubts, I wouldn't do it. Because if doubts, I can have outside too, I don't have to give her away.\nBut I was sure that she -- bombing, bombardment. The Germans are coming. So I went there for\nthe interviews and of course I passed it. And I was like a mother to the children, instead of my\nown. I tutored them. She told me -- and their sister, Dr. Sachat told me. He was an also engineer,\narchitect, the whole building was of architects, a co-op of architects. Intelligent, you know, nice\npeople. And you know, they said that the house was never in such an order, never 1n their life.\nThe oldest son was 14 years old, Mirek. Gorgeous, he was like really gorgeous, beautiful. He\nhelped me a lot. He didn't know, the children didn't know who I am, that I'm Jewish. Only the --\nthe parents and of course the sarachtinta (ph). They come very often, they used to come, you\nknow, for holidays they get together and this and that. And she said -- her name was Rouba...",
        "A: The wife, yeah, yeah, Halina. Yes, and he was Yusef (ph). And Mirek, Ewa and Julek, the\nthree children. They loved me, because I was constantly spending time with them, tutoring,\nbecause the schools, was no, you know, there was -- Mirek was going to school, but it was\nunderground. They shouldn't have schools, children couldn't go to school. And to wash them and\nsew was sew, I was sewing for them, you know, every -- when they were sick, only they wanted\nme. And she, whenever I call, was going marketing. She said, \u201cMuireczku, you always have to go\nwith Miss, it was Miss Pani!\u2019 Lodziu, you know, I was Lodziu Lowakatya (ph).",
        "A: Lodziu Lowakatya (ph) Sheletska (ph), this is what I got in the country, that my -- I have the -\n- the Kennkarte.'* And always go marketing with, because it's difficult for her, you know, she's\ntiny. And he said, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d Whenever he used to leave the apartment, he used to bring\nme coal from the cellar and all kinds of the heaviest things he used to bring me. When he used to\nleave the house, he used come, \u201cPani Lodziu, may I go?\u201d You know, this way. He was very\nnice. And the children, the two younger children, she was going once a week to another town,\nwhere she had an uncle, a priest, Lowicz, to Lowicz, and bring food. Sour cream, butter, cheeses,\nyou know, all kind of things. A lot of it, he'd start to prepare for her when she's coming and she\ncould sell to the neighbors, because we couldn't get it. And she didn't take much money. Before\nthat, she had herself, what she made from them, she could pay for her own, to have for the\nfamily. So she was free to go for a few days, for two days, three days, because I took care of the\nfamily, you know. So it was a double thing. And not to make me feel bad, she was paying me 80\nzlotys a month that I\u2019m working for it, not that I\u2019m giving, you know, her this. Through her I had\na telephone there, Michal could call me. And I had a lot of contacts. Over there was living one\nwoman and also she was a teacher and she was very -- and she probably guessed, we never\ntalked about it, but I\u2019m sure she guessed who I am. What I am, you know, who I am. I found\n'7 Mrs. (Polish).\n'8 TD card (German).\nanother one, also a friend of hers and that woman, where I could put my friend, Halinka\nEllenbogen. She was also a maid someplace. She was always with swollen knees because she\nwas on the floor, you know, washing the floors. I never did this kind of thing. And she was\ncrying and this and that, but she looked very well, you know, like really Aryan. She used to come\nup to me and I gave her a place to live not far from me. She was also a teacher. And she had, and\nthen I gave her the place with Dr. Zachert in Boduen, so she saw Irene every day. And so she had\nthe apartment I arranged for her, she had the books and French literature, all kinds of things. She\nwas so proud of it -- after being a maid, you know, when we came to Florida. And the work she\nhad in Boduen, she could see Irene every day. And I got reports from her about Irene. But one\nday, in the beginning, I wanted to see Irene. So I started to walk there. It wasn\u2019t too far from me,\nit was far enough but not too bad. I could walk then have to take the train which I was avoiding.\nAnd the children were going from one side of the street to the other to play with the garden. And\nI knew from afar, I could see Irene. And one day I decided to go to her, to pick up her hand and I\nsaid, P\u2019ll help you to cross the street. And she gave her hand and she looked at me and she\nwalked with me and the nun came and she started screaming at me, \u201cYou know that you are not\nallowed to touch our children! You can give them some kind of infection!\u201d which is true. It was\ntyphus and syphilis and this kind, so I said, I\u2019m sorry. I never do it again. So I left Irene and I\nwalked away and she said,\u201d Mommy!\u201d I got scared. I was afraid that the nun heard it but she\ndidn\u2019t. I never went again. She recognized me. It was after a few months. She was crying the first\nthree months, I heard.\nDr. Zachert told me that. At night, she was crying. And then, I have a very sharp instinct, I don\u2019t\nknow how it happens but it is so. I can somehow feel out things. I was cooking something, I was\npreparing dinner, and I had a dish with peeled potatoes to put into the water, put into the pot.\nAnd I was thinking about Irka and I said, \u201cIrka is very sick.\u201d And everything fell down on the\nfloor. I didn\u2019t understand why. So then, I called, I didn\u2019t call, I called Dr. Zachert and I said, \u201cI\nhave a feeling that Irka is very sick.\u201d She said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s true. She still has a mark on her leg, she\ngot some kind of infection.\u201d And even the priest wanted to come, you know, she was very sick.\nAnd then, you know, somehow she got out of it, you know.",
        "A: Yes, please.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "A: Yes. You know, the ghetto when it was established and they come down a little bit, they\nsettled down, and there were places where they had cows. They took them to the field during the\nday, close by, and then, you know, some never went out of the ghetto, too. And that I couldn\u2019t, I\nwas breastfeeding her, but not always I had enough and so once she needed milk. And my\ndoctors, they believed very much in fresh milk so my mother-in-law found out where the cows\nare. They wasn\u2019t too far from where we lived. And we decided to buy milk, fresh milk, as she,\nyou know, was selling a lot of things to have money for everyday, and so on. We took, we went\nthe first time, I went and bought milk and she asked me, \u201cWhich cow do you want?\u201d To me they\nlooked all the same, but I said, \u201cThis cow.\u201d So she gave me milk from this cow and from then\non, I was always buying from the same cow the milk because I was afraid maybe another cow\ncould get sick or something will happen to her and then it will be a reflection on Irene. So we\nhad the milk all the time, whenever I bought, from the same cow.",
        "A: Irene was never hungry. Maybe was in the orphanage, I don\u2019t think the children were hungry\nin the orphanage because they got some food, whether it was good food or bad food, I don\u2019t\nknow. But I am sure that she was never hungry. She needed a lot, let\u2019s see, other things like a\nfruit, a chocolate, which I always sent in, and Dr. Zachert used to give her. Even my husband,\nMichal, he went a few times to the orphanage and brought the chocolate and good things to Dr.\nZachert so she can give it to her. And she was giving to her, I gave it to her and she was giving\nvery quietly to Irene, I know, something special. But when he went there, she was screaming at\nhim, she said to never show up again. Because it was very dangerous for the child.\nNobody should know, only the director of the orphanage knew, the woman, that she is a Jewish\nchild, and I can -- only the mother -- can pick her up. This was her restriction, Dr. Zachert\u2019s,\nwhen Irene came to the orphanage. She said only I can pick her up and not to give the child to\nanybody because people adopt, you know how it is, she looked as a very Aryan child. She was\nblonde. You\u2019ll see the photographs of her when she\u2019s a little, a little child. So this is, you know,\nbut I don\u2019t think Irene was hungry.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no. And that... Look, she was the only child in our family, you know. We\ncould be hungry, I was not ever, not all the time, you know, I had enough, believe me. But Irene,\nno, Irene had even fresh milk from the same cow. No, she wasn\u2019t hungry. And later on, she got --\nI would have a very difficult time, but Irene usually had everything when it comes to food. Even,\neven her clothes, later on, I was sewing and Halinka was sewing for her, so we had, she was, I\ndon\u2019t think Irene suffered.",
        "A: Yeah, Gina wasn\u2019t there when the raid was in the building, but she was in the hospital. But\nshe saw them later on in the Umschlagplatz, and Maria was carrying her father\u2019s -- I mean,\nIrene\u2019s great-grandfather, a golden watch which the men always carried in their vests, with the\nchains, the golden chains. And she took this watch and she gave it to Genia and said, \u201cThis\nwatch, this golden watch, is for Irene. Whenever she would be in need to have it, to buy her out\nof whatever happens, but this is for this child.\u201d And she gave it to Irene and then, she gave it to\nGina and Gina gave it to me. And later on, I gave it to Dr. Zachert for her when she was in the\norphanage. With the address of the Aunt here in the States, inside the watch I put in a little card\nwith the address of Irene\u2019s grandmother\u2019s sister, here in the States. But she was killed by the\nUkrainians in the Polish uprising.",
        "A: With her husband, yeah.",
        "A: In the Polish uprising, it was 1944. The Ukrainians were there, the Latvians were there, the\nLithuanians on the side of Germany and they were behaving terrible. They were drinking and\nkilling and this was the case with Dr. Zachert because somebody told us what happened at that\ntime. They took all the people down, they lived in a very fine neighborhood, this is where I was,\nnot far from them. And they took them down on onto the court and just killed them and robbed\nthem. And at that time, also, you know, when the watch was then with them. But this was what\nthey were doing. Before I want to still tell you about going back, my life, this Rouba, that Halina\nEllenbogen used to come up to me, did I tell you that?",
        "A: Yes, I told you about that. That she was, you know, I gave her the job and then, at that time,\nalso during that time, we used to go, you know, meeting, then I met Maria and Blanca, Maria\nRosenbloom (ph) and Blanca Rosenberg.",
        "A: It was by pure accident. Halina Ellenbogen was before Madden Sanitarium (ph) a sanitarrum\nfor children, for sick children under the auspices of Bund. Madden (ph) was one of the great\nleaders from the Bund \u2014 really a theoretician of the Bund -- so there was a sanitarium named in\nhis name and during the war. She was there. Perelka is really her name, Ellenbogen. There was\nalso Boleck Ellenbogen and Anya (ph) Ellenbogen, so it was the family. And after the\nliquidation of the Madden Sanitarium, in fact, Michal came there and told them one night that\nthey can go out but they didn\u2019t hear; they were on another side of the -- and this was from\nWarsaw quite a few miles, about 10 or 15 miles.\nThey had to go by train, and they didn\u2019t hear him, but he went at night. Halina said that she\nheard him, but they couldn\u2019t come to that point because they were afraid. So they then came to\nWarsaw, there was one woman also, a teacher, in Madden Sanitartum, which was -- Irene was\nalso young and she took care of her and she came to look for work. And at that time Blanca and\nMaria were working at the Germans; she probably told you. And she came to ask for work.\nThere were Volksdeutscher!? Germans, or German, \u201creal Germans.\u201d And so she, Blanca, was the\nhead maid over the housekeeper, for the Germans, and she looked at her, and she said, \u201cMy\nname is Geneska (ph),\u201d which is a Polish name. So Blanca answered her, \u201cWe have a lot of\nGeneska\u2019s (ph) like that, you know.\u201d And through her, Halina came to Blanca and Maria and, as\nwe were meeting constantly, you know, Sundays we had all off. So we\u2019re meeting in one place,\neither at Anya (ph) Ellenbogen\u2019s, where she was working, her mistress was going out, so we\nbrought in Blanca and Maria also there. And sometimes we were going there because they could\nlisten to the radio, to the, you know, Germans could have radio, so we could listen to what\u2019s\ngoing on. So this is how I got, you know -- we were, I want to tell you, during that time we were\nmeeting, all these friends, and we\u2019re meeting Marysia Sevitzka, you know, and just Navel (ph)\nHalska (ph), who gave us a lot of help, particularly to Michal and Gina and when Gina was sick,\nthey were taking care of her. But this was during the Aryan side, until the Polish uprising in\n1944. And during, you know, the Polish uprising --",
        "A: And the Jewish were uprising, the Warsaw ghetto uprising, you talking? How much I was\nseeing?",
        "A: Okay, yes. At that point, I knew already what he was doing. We were meeting constantly. We\nwere meeting and let\u2019s say, sometimes I was staying there overnight, too, that worker who met\nhim in the street and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He gave him a shelter then. It was a\nbasement, something like that \u2014 or maybe a low ground floor apartment. So he slept there, you\nknow. This was his place at that time. And we were meeting either there or other places,\nsometimes in a coffee shop which he knew was safe to go into a certain room, or whatever. And\nhe was writing a lot, what\u2019s going on, and he was meeting with the leaders from the\nunderground. And there was a special place also from the Bundists, on Sharavial (ph) Street and\nhe was leaving there, the happenings, you know, the events, which he was writing down\neveryday. And I remember sitting once with some coffee and he was writing, and I said, \u201cAren\u2019t\nyou afraid?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, this is, you know, we have to leave something. What\u2019s happening\nnow.\u201d He, he wrote everyday. He was very, very, you know, historically minded, and to let\npeople know what\u2019s happening. So we were meeting, I would say once a week for sure, when\nMrs. Rouba saw that I am very depressed or something, she says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and meet\nyour husband,\u201d because whenever I come back from these meetings, you know, I was elated. I\nwas -- started to believe this will be the end of it. He always could put me in such a mood, you\nknow, really. \u201cBe patient, you\u2019ll see, we will come through, we will take Irene,\u201d you know, these\nkind of things. And I was always looking forward for the weekend you know, to see him. We\nused to meet constantly. And he used to tell me what\u2019s going on, what he is doing, at that time.",
        "A: I know.",
        "A: I knew, I knew that, yeah. I knew that.",
        "A: Yes. I had a big conflict because this was very dangerous, what he is doing. He was exposed,\nhe was going in and out because he looked well, but you know, there are always those, they\u2019 II\ncalled shmaltsovnik,\u201d\u00b0 you know. They take money, you know. And they can always spot you --\nand they even took Stefan, that I\u2019m talking about, was sleeping. He later on started to get money\nfrom other people and then, you know, telling all kinds of stories and he just cut off with him.",
        "A: He wouldn\u2019t harm Michal, but other people that were coming, if Vladka was coming in there\ntoo, you know, was sometimes... Because, you know, the connections with, with all that. So, I\nhad a big conflict with that. What is more important? I and the child or this? I had a tremendous\nconflict. But to him it was important. He couldn\u2019t do otherwise.",
        "A: No. I couldn\u2019t do it to him. And the last time he called me, we had the telephone, Mrs. Rouba\nhad the telephone, he called me. This was before the 17\" -- it was about the 16\" -- of April, it\nwas Irene\u2019s birthday and his, and he called me and he said that he\u2019s going back into the ghetto\nbecause they know that they will be coming, the Germans will come and surround the ghetto and\nthe fight will start. And I said at that time, \u201cMaybe you won\u2019t go.\u201d He said, \u201cI must go.\u201d I didn\u2019t\nsay anything anymore. This was it. And he wished me, you know, Irene, and all that. It was his\nbirthday, his 30\" birthday. And Irene was how much? Two years old. I had a tremendous\nconflict. For a long, long time, maybe up to now, who knows. But what\u2019s more important. You\n*0 A person who, for money or favor, betrayed Jews in hiding.\ncannot judge. We were very important to him, I know that. He left Irene. He felt when she was\nborn, that there\u2019s no other child who is more educated, more intelligent and prettier than she is,\nso? He was very proud, very proud of her. So this was, you know, we were meeting, and\nconstantly. In different places, we were meeting. And later on, when -- after the Warsaw ghetto\nuprising -- we started to meet with other people, and as I say, it was Blanca and Maria and Anya\n(ph) Ellenbogen, and Boleck Ellenbogen and Halina Ellenbogen.\nHalina is also not her name, but, Pearl is her name. And Halina was nearby me, over there, she\ngot the job and Anya (ph) was still working as a maid, and Bolek was working in the\nconstruction business. So, we, we used to meet. Sometimes we went to Marysia Sawicka\u2019s home\nand Navel (ph) Halska (ph). And there was a time when Michal was grabbed in the street and\ngoing to Treblinka. He was on the train, and he jumped. He jumped from the train and the\nGermans shoot and it was, it was -- he got it in his leg, the bullet, and he was, he couldn\u2019t walk,\nbut he hid someplace in the field where he jumped from and the first place he waited until the\nmorning. This was closer to the evening, middle of the morning, something. In the morning, he\nwent to Marysia Sawicka and Navel (ph) Halska (ph), they lived together. And they took him in,\nof course. Under, underneath, Gestapo lived. They had a big apartment, Gestapo. And there was\nno toilets there, you know, so they had to carry out everything. But they did it. They were\nmarvelous, they were really marvelous. They helped a lot, they give such a shelter to many\npeople, particularly to Gina when Gina got sick. Gina got sick and she died, you know, before\nthe Polish uprising. She died in 1942. She felt she had ulcers and she couldn\u2019t function. She was\nvery sick, and I wasn\u2019t the strongest either and a small child, so she felt that she had to take care\nof us. The only way being, and that is knowing what\u2019s the matter, she couldn\u2019t go for an\noperation. But this was a Polish, you know, hospital. And how much care she...Michal didn\u2019t tell\nme.\nShe talked to me about going for an operation, I said, \u201cNever.\u201d I said, \u201cOver my dead body\nyou\u2019re going to the hospital because I am afraid they might not give you good care.\u201d And Michal\ndid not tell me that she went to the hospital, but I found out that she died in the hospital after the\noperation. And this was in December, 1942. So another link of the family went.",
        "A: And she was working in the hospital, too, in that stupid hospital, you know, created, it wasn\u2019t\na real hospital. It was just made a hospital. She was working there as a nurse. This is why I had\nthe privileges of being in the nursing room, in the nurses\u2019 room, you know, and having these\ndoctors operating on me.",
        "A: On her own.",
        "A: This is on her own. Of course, she put on her uniform, you know, had a special uniform with\nsuch, on her own, with her hat. You will see her hat, yeah. This is, you know, a sort of nurse.\nThis was on her own.",
        "A: At that time, they let in, you know, still this was the beginning of this, they let in at that time.\nSo, she took them out, for this case, this case, you know. They always could find some kind of\nexcuse for the official people. She was like an official person. Gina was a marvelous person\nanyway. She loved this baby like, she was a joy for the whole family, in those circumstances.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. This was, for example, you know, as I was going to meet Michal, let\u2019s say, and\nwe always waited until the last moment before the police time...to get home. He was in one side\nof the city, I was in the other side, we didn\u2019t want to take the tram, and then I see the streets is\nempty.\nI was walking, you know, in the street and then from afar I see an SS man walking, you know,\nwith his arm and I don\u2019t know whether to pass or to cross the other side. If I cross, it will be\nsuspicious. I probably should go straight. And I went marching through him straight. And I\npassed. Behind me, about 20 yards behind me, was, I heard, you know, somebody walking.\nThere\u2019s another woman and he stopped her. Why not me, but her, who is probably Polish?\nBecause who would risk, you know, this kind of thing? He stopped her. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened, but he stopped her. If he, 1f he would stop me, it would be the end of me because all\nmy knowing the, the, the, the prayers, you know, and all that. I wouldn\u2019t pass. Because they can\nalways hook up to something, which I couldn\u2019t answer or be not true.",
        "A: I looked like nothing, I told you, I looked like nothing. Not this way, not this way, I looked\nlike somebody that doesn\u2019t matter, you know, doesn\u2019t pay attention to me. I was wearing a hat, I\nwas wearing a black coat. To look like nothing, you know.",
        "A: Of course. Of course, yeah. Not to pay att -- not to call attention to myself. I was there dressed\nnormally, and Sundays, you know, it\u2019s the main thing. When I was going out to meet this one or\nthis one, this was that.",
        "A: Yes. When Michal was still alive, we were getting the bulletin, it\u2019s called \u201cInformative\nBulletin\u201d from London, we use to get, and this was underground. And I was picking it up\nsomeplace, on certain street, for the whole building. It was a co-op building for the engineers,\narchitects, engineers, and they were all, you know, patriots, Polish patriots. Only the concierge\u2019\nwas a little shaky for me. And he didn\u2019t know, if he would know, I wouldn\u2019t be, you know, there.\nIf he would guess even, I wouldn\u2019t be, he would finish with me, to get some money from\nGestapo.\nAnd Michal was still alive and I was, I had a dream. I woke up and I was all wet. I dreamt that I\nsee in that bulletin, I see a news item about \u201cMichal Klepfisz, engineer, was caught while\nmaking arms\u2019, you know, and was, and he was killed, something like that. And I remember it\nwas page three; one, two, you know \u2014 the first page, the number three -- and I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nAnd truly enough, it was in 19 \u2014 late \u201943, I get the bulletin, Biuletyn Informacyjny,\u201d! Michal was\nalready dead. It was the end of the year, I don\u2019t remember which month, it was the same news\nitem! And he was awarded. It was the medal of Virtuti Militari, the only medal given, you know,\nto a Jew at the time of the Nazi occupation. How would this happen, I don\u2019t know, but this is a\nfact. Being still on the Aryan side, I had to have my Kennkarte, you know?",
        "A: I found out two weeks later, about 10 days later. Vladka came to tell me. It was a little\nunfortunate the way she did it, but she wanted the best, probably, but she told me. We met\nSunday, on my, you know, free day. She called me and was, because I didn\u2019t hear from him at\nall, and the fighting was going on and she got a contact from the ghetto. Marek Edelman (ph)\nwas in his group, with Michal, and the whole group was there. And she found out, you know,\nthey let her know. But she didn\u2019t tell me for a while, and she also, it was probably difficult for\nher to tell me. And we met in the street, in a park, and she told me about that.",
        "A: A few days longer. I don\u2019t know how many days, you know, but it was later on.\n*! Information Bulletin (Polish).",
        "A: She started to talk about other things, you know, tried to make me laugh, this...you know, but\nforget about it. This 1s a -- but I couldn\u2019t comfort myself for a long time. This was the end, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Because they knew I am beside myself. They were very warm, very sympathetic, you\nknow. The children didn\u2019t know. So the children never knew who I was. And, so this was that.",
        "A: On my own, without any advice. To make my own decisions and how to deal with the stress.\nAnd then came the offer, after a while, for the Hotel Polski. The director of that, you know,\nGuzik. He was very well known, he was in the Judenrat; he was personagrata (ph). He said that I\ncan go to France with Irene. The Jews paid thousands and thousands of dollars to get out and\nthey could.... They were all in that Hotel Polski, it was hotel. Whoever paid was in this hotel, the\nJews. And I went there twice, I remember, to visit some people, to find out what it is and how it\nis; who are going, who paid in and going. And there was a woman, Estusia Lipszyc, her husband\nwas also very famous Bundist and activist and she had a son and a daughter older overseas. And\nshe was going. She paid in because she sold, she was a dentist, she sold everything, you know,\nher cabinet, you know, this, everything. And she had the money and she paid in and she was\ngoing. So I came there and she saw me, she says, \u201cLook, I have two children, I am not afraid; I\nam going, that I want to be together.\u201d And I told her that I had the offer from Guzik, she says,\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take your child and go?!\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m scared, I don\u2019t know. I cannot make this\nkind of decision. Now she 1s in the orphanage, she is safe. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\nShe is safe now. And the main thing 1s her safety.\u201d I went once; I looked around at the people\nwho are going there, they were mostly Jews, so it was dangerous, but I took the risk, I wanted to\nknow.\nThen I went the second time, and I remember that I met I think Meed, his brother, I think, went\nthere also. And I think so. I think it was his brother. And I spoke again and I still, I couldn\u2019t\nmake the decision because Irene was safe. I felt. Whether it was true or not, I don\u2019t know, but\nthis is how I felt at that time. And I came back and I had to give an answer because the Guzik\nhad to know the amount of people to get out from Warsaw to France. Vittel, this was the town,\nVittel, the famous town, Vittel. And I spoke to Mrs. Rouba and him and they said to me, \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t trust the Germans. If you want to go, go, but we don\u2019t trust them.\u201d And this was somehow\nmy point, decision. They helped me to decide not to go and I did a good thing because all the\npeople went to Auschwitz from Hotel Polski. So, how do you know? This is luck. You make a\ndecision, you don\u2019t know right or wrong. And I didn\u2019t have anybody close to find out, to ask\nwhat should I do? But this was my decision. They helped me to do it. And this is how it was. So,\nthen came the -- we met with friends of mine, as I told you, with whom. And it was nice at that\ntime to see somebody friendly. And they were good company, you know, meaning (ph). They in\nthey were -- when the Germans, you know, they were working for the Germans, they had a\npicture of a Polish \u2014 Zeromski, you know, author, very famous, you can imagine, when we came\nin there. Then came the Polish uprising. This 1s 1944 and they came to our building, too. And\nthey took us out, the Rouba family, the whole Rouba family.\nMireck, the oldest one, went to fight. With the, you know, with the uprising. He was in the\nuprising. And one of the days, Halina told me, Halina Ellenbogen, when they were in the bunkers\nhiding, they were going from places to places. Who came there? Mireck. As Halina and I use to\ncome up to meet, to visit me there, Mireck came in and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cThe same thing as everybody else.\u201d He went out and an hour later he brought her sugar, a\nwhole box of sugar. She couldn\u2019t get over it. Then he was killed in the uprising. Mirek was\nkilled, the oldest son. And the mother said, \u201cGod gave and God took.\u201d She was a very religious,\nyou know, Catholic. Then they came to us to take us and she, with her husband, the two children\nand I went to a camp, to a big, big field where they were selling all kind of vegetables. They\nwere coming from countries and the villages to sell vegetables, a tremendous place. And they\ntook us there, the Ukrainians. They were wild. They wanted to kills us, you know, in that\napartment, so she gave them a bottle of vodka and they started to drink and we went down. And\nthis we, you know, we joined the other people and we were taken, walking, you know, to that\nzazielenic,\u201d~ it was called. Zazielenic is green, the vegetables were called zazielenic, you know.\nAnd it was an open place with tens of thousands of people were there guarded. We were taken to\nPruszkow. It was a transient camp. There were factories, not working factories.",
        "A: Ukrainians.",
        "A: Ukrainians, yeah. They were, you know, the same as the -- I don\u2019t know if they were the\nsame people, but they killed the Zacherts, you know -- they came -- this was in our area, over\n*2 Greens, vegetables (Polish).\nthere. And we were there sleeping there, you know, just on the grass, were the two children. And\nthen they were taken to Pruszkow, to the factories there. So we had a roof under, but nothing else\nthere. And they said that people with children, who have children, can go out.\nBecause they were taking people for work to Germany, so with people with children can go out.\nSo we have two children over there. And there\u2019s he and she. But I don\u2019t have a child. So I was\nthere, I saw there a nun with a few children and I ask her whether she can give me a child and an\naddress where I can deliver the child later. And this way I will go out. She gave me -- she was\ngrateful that she can get rid of one child at least. She gave me this child and we all went out and\nwe went to Ro-bus (ph), an old, the next little town from Pruszkow . We walked. And we went\nthere and I was with this strange little girl. She was four or five years old. And what do we do\nnow\u201d There is no money, there is nothing. And I don\u2019t know what is going to happen to Irene\nbecause everything was being evacuated. I knew that I have to go back and find out what\u2019s\nhappened to Irene, to Pruszkow, at least. And I got an address from another convent, meanwhile,\nI was there a few days. I took the little girl. I brought her to that convent and I went back. I slept\nin the convent for a whole night, I didn\u2019t know who I am. I said that the parents, so and so and\nso, you know. And I went back and then I told the Roubas\u2019, \u201cI am going to Pruszkow. I have to\nfind out what\u2019s happened with Irene.\u201d She says, \u201cWhere are you going, where are you going to\nstay?\u201d She had a friend in Pruszkow, on Olowkowa, the street in the [Indecipherable] 11, and I\ngot the address from her.\nAnd one morning, she says, \u201cYou have no money, you have nothing.\u201d I says, \u201cWhat can I do, but\nI have to go.\u201d So when they were all sleeping still, I left her a note that I am going to this and this\naddress, that she knows where I am because she was worried about me. And I have to know\nwhat\u2019s, what\u2019s happening to her. I was hungry, but I was walking through fields with the wheat\nas I was taking out the kernels and I was eating this, and I came to that person, to that family, and\nI told her that I know Mrs. Rouba. She didn\u2019t know anything, that I am Jewish, you know, and I\ncame that I was, I know them. I didn\u2019t say that I was working there, but I know them. And I met\nthem. And that I was in the Polish uprising and my husband is in Germany, he 1s working. And\nmy daughter, my child, is in orphanage because we had to do, we had to do something to make a\nliving and she should be safe. Is in the orphanage in, the Polish orphanage, a Catholic orphanage,\nyou know. So everything is kosher. And I started to run around to find out, the convent. I found\nout the convent and I told them the story, I was fighting in the Polish uprising, my husband 1s in\nGermany and all the same story. And my child 1s in the orphanage. Is Boduena coming here? Did\nyou hear anything about Boduen? They said, \u201cYes, we know that they are going to be\nevacuated.\u201d So, \u201cGood. When?\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know, but leave me your address and I let you\nknow.\u201d They were very nice and very kind. So I left them the address, where I was, but I was\ngone everyday. I did not rely on that. To that Pruszkow, to that camp, the big gates where,\nbecause it was a factory before that, and the Germans were sending their armies there, you know,\narms, and they were pushing me all the time. I was going closer, maybe can take a look inside or\nwhatever. I was running. One day, I came over there, I was almost the whole day because I was\nafraid they will come and I wouldn\u2019t know, were they going or whatever. One day, I come in\nDecember, they said somebody was standing there, \u201cBoduena orphanage come, came already.\u201d\nSo I heard this, I said, \u201cThis is it.\u201d I was waiting, I was already further a little bit from the gate. I\nwas afraid that they would catch me there. So I going further down and I see after maybe an\nhour, one cart came out with children. You know, what\u2019s cart, the Polish peasants have a cart;\nthere\u2019s a board in the center and there is two like other boards, but a little length. And the\nchildren were from both sides sitting, the small children, you know. And they\u2019re heads were\ngoing like that onto the board. There was one cart that came out with a horse, you know, this\nwas, was drawn by a horse.\nAnd Irene wasn\u2019t there. Came another one. Wasn\u2019t there. The third one, I found her. There is one\nnun there with the children, in the cart. I let them go because I was afraid, near, near the\nGermans. I let them go and quite a while I was running after them on the other side so nobody\nwould, you know, be suspicious. And I -- then I protest up the, the cart. And I said to the nun,\n\u201cHere is my little child, I want to take her.\u201d She said, \u201cTake her.\u201d I said, \u201cChodz do mamusi.\u201d\n\u201cCome to Mommy.\u201d She stretched out her hands, you know, and I took her. And I run. This\nchild, a running nose with the diarrhea. I felt her head, I saw that she has fever. I took her home.\nI took her temperature, it was in Celsius, you know, 40 degrees, which is 104\u00b0 Fahrenheit. I\ndidn\u2019t know what to do. I have not a penny to my soul. I don\u2019t know anybody. What do I do?\nWell, I asked about a doctor. The people I lived with, you know, I was already there about a\nweek, probably. I asked a doctor about a doctor and they gave me a name of a doctor, a Polish\ndoctor. I went there. \u201cI was in the uprising, my husband 1s in Germany, my child was in\norphanage. I just brought her back, she is sick and she has a lot of fever.\u201d So he said bring her. I\nsaid, \u201cI have no money.\u201d He said, \u201cBring her.\u201d And when I left to look for the doctor, Irka (ph),\nIrene said to me, \u201cMommy, will you still come back?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d I took the\nchild. He said, \u201cShe has deep bronchitis. She has infection of all her intestines. You have to give\nher medication and ground apples and take ground meat, make balls, boil it without anything and\ngive it to her. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nI brought her back and there were a lot of, you know, fruit cartons that sell, so I use to see that\napples were on the ground, so one evening I went out and I picked up the apples. I ground them,\ngave them. I borrowed money from my, from where I lived, I said, \u201cIll sew something for you,\nPll be sewing and I will return it. I will return the money to you.\u201d And she gave me and I bought\nthe meat and then, medication, what do I do now? So there was like Kupat-Cholim\u201d? in Israel.\nKasa-chorych\u201d* it was called, and I went there. \u201cI was in the Polish uprising, my husband is in\nGermany and my child is very sick, I have no money. Can I get the medication?\u201d He said, \u201cOf\ncourse you will get it.\u201d They gave me the without the money. The doctor didn\u2019t take money; they\ndidn\u2019t take money, I bought it, you know? She came out. She came out from that and she was,\nshe was happy with me. There was a teenager, Halina, and I was there. There came a time when\nthey needed the papers, the Kennkarte, you know. And she got used to it, you know, Irene, she\nsettled down somehow. Then I needed a Kennkarte, the document, without this, you know, I am\nnothing. And one winter day, I decided to go for it because I had the birth certificate of the, you\n*3 Israel\u2019s National Health Organization.\n** Poland\u2019s National Health Service.\nknow, sister of our maid once, what she gave me from the, when I went to the village that, on\nthis basis I could get a Kennkarte, but the risk to go to the official bureau to get a Kennkarte is\nlike to go, you know, on to the guillotine. And this highway, I am in Pruszkow and this 1s in\nanother town. I cannot go by train, I have to walk on the highway. I gave her instructions, I said,\n\u201cIn case maybe something happens to me, this and this and this.\u201d \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cNothing will happen to you, go.\u201d And I went.\nI had no instructions to give, to leave her with anybody, you know? And I go with this highway.\nIt was quite a few miles. And I\u2019m the only one there, it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s terribly cold, I didn\u2019t have\nany, something too, too warm to wear anyway. And against me walks a woman and she passes\nme by with, we always started, not to look each other in the face, whoever I see, better not. And I\nsee a familiar face but I wasn\u2019t sure, I was afraid. And I go. A few steps further, you know, five\nor six steps, I turn around, the woman stands and turns around too. I decided to meet her. And we\ngo to each other and who 1s it? It was Halina Szefner, who was the professor of my husband\u2019s in\na gimnazjum who teach him French, and I knew her. I knew her husband too. He was a\njournalist. And you can imagine. I had so many pimples on my face because, you know, I didn\u2019t\neat right and all that. The first thing what she did with me, there was a kiosk selling little things,\nshe bought me yeast, to eat it. I get vitamins, you know, for the pimples. She gave me the\ncontacts. She looked like, I say again, like a thousand, like a ton you know, going, beautiful\nwoman. I have a photograph of her. She was so marvelous, really, gray hair, white hair, she\nlooked like a queen. She gave me the contacts of Mirek.",
        "A: Yeah. She came me the contacts, Mirek and Anielewicz, you know, the whole group. Not\nAnielewicz, but Antek, Antek and Sylvia. She gave me the contacts over there. And she used to\ncome, you know, and visit me and when she looked at Irene, she told me later, \u201cThis child 1s\nvery sick,\u201d she told me. I mean, Irene was quite well already. Can you imagine how she looked?\nAnyway, one day, so I had to contact with her already, and she let them know that I am some\nplace, you know? She let them know because she was in contact with them. And one day, I took\nIrene.\nFirst of all, I had to take her to Boduena. They were taking all the children to big factories of\nsilk, a little for sewing silk, you know, the little things, and the factories. All the children are, if\nIrene would go there she wouldn\u2019t come out alive, being so sick at that time. I decided to go to\ntell the director that I took Irene because it was her responsibility and I felt at that time, also\nstupid of me, but it was right to do that, because she would be worried, what happened to Irene,\nwho took her? Because she was told not to, not to give her to anybody. So, I went there to her,\nthis was the first trip I did by train. And I came back. And after I met Halina Szefner, I decided\nto go to see Mirek Edelman with the whole group. And, because they would give me help,\nmoney they would give me, they had money. And I went there, I went to the train and on the\nway, a mother of my friend who looked like a hundred Jews, I made like that [shaking head\n\u201cno\u2019\u2019]. | approached her. So we got off and we went to Mirek and Ala, his wife, and there was\nSylvia and Antek together. Well, you can imagine that he saw us. Mirek was with, with the last\nminute, you know, with Michal. By the way, Mirek buried Michal in the same court where he\nwas killed. Did I tell you how he was killed?\nTape 4",
        "A: Yes, Dr. Zachert really was in touch with the doctor in the hospital when Gina was there. I called\nher up and I told her what happened, that Gina is there, being operated on, and so she was really,\nyou know, in touch with that. And when it came to the funeral, when I found out, Michal told me\nthat she died, I, I, I went to the hospital and I wanted to speak to the doctor. And I waited for quite a\nwhile until he saw me. I don\u2019t know whether he knew this was neglect, I don\u2019t know. I am afraid it\nwas a neglecting thing, you know, just. And I asked him what happened. So he started to give me\nsome medical terms, which I couldn\u2019t understand, I couldn\u2019t comprehend the whole thing. And\njustifying, you know, the fact that she, there was no rescue for her, something like that. And then it\nwas the matter of the funeral. And I spoke to Dr. Zachert and she told me that she spoke to her priest\nand told him who she was. She was Jewish, and the priest told her, \u201cLet her be buried by the name\nshe was alive and died.\u201d So this way, she was buried in Prague, of the other side of Wisla in Pol --\nWarsaw. And I didn\u2019t let Michal to come to the funeral because it was too dangerous for him, he\nwas so exposed, you know, and different that anybody could find him. But there were a few people.\nDr. Zachert didn\u2019t come either because she didn\u2019t, she was afraid, you know, to commit herself in\ncase something happened. And some people came who were on the Aryan side, to the funeral, at\nthat time. And she was buried under her name, Kazimiere (ph) Jozwiak and later on, after the war, I\nsent money to Poland to write down under Kazimiere (ph) Jozwiak was Gina Klepfisz. Otherwise\nshe would never be found in the cemetery under this name, which was registered as Jozwiak and\nthis is how she has now her stone there.",
        "A: Sure, of course I was there.",
        "A: It was always dangerous to, to go into the street, particular to such a gathering. Any gathering.\nSomebody can find you out. It, it was always dangerous. But we were living like that. I was going\nout into the streets and do some shopping or whatever I was doing, it was dangerous. It was\ndangerous, you know, with my next door neighbor, whether he would sense something and say,\n\u2018Please check it out,\u201d or whatever, of the concierge, you know, who was taking care of the building.\nIt was always dangerous.",
        "A: Yes, I did know. Yes, I did know. I didn\u2019t meet them but I know -- I knew them. And then there\nwas through the connections, they found out, you know, that this was the funeral and they came.\nAnd it was Marysia Sawicka and Anna Wachalska was there, the two of them, which helped.",
        "A: Of course, they were, you know, they were Christians and it helped, for them being there, in\ncase, In, in, in a sense of safety. Polak, you know. They came to the funeral.",
        "A: Gina was five years older than Michal. So if he was born in 1913, she was \u2014yes?\u20141908, and \u201942\nminus \u201942 -- so 34 years old. No. She was born 19...Ok.",
        "A: 34, yeah. 34 years old, yeah.",
        "A: The only grave for both families. We don\u2019t have any body else.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I was with the family Rouba and he was going everyday to the city because he was doing\nsome work as an architect, you know, very little, but he tried to get, you know, to make some, earn\nsome money, and he brought all the news. And I was asking him all the time, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nSo he use to tell me the Germans are in this block and they are burning the buildings and people are\njumping from the windows and the constant, you know, smoke. He can see. He never went close to\nthe ghetto to see, or whatever, but he used to tell me which blocks are being, you know, surrounded\nby, by the Germans and how people are fighting and, and all that. The atmosphere was, some said,\n\u2018Ah, it\u2019s good that the Germans are finishing out the Jews.\u201d I never went there close by, I was afraid\nto go there. Because of Irene, you know, I had to be, somebody had to be for her. I knew that\nMichal was there, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. And there was a telephone from the ghetto\nstill coming out to some people, which I had contact with, and they didn\u2019t hear anything. If they\nknew, they didn\u2019t tell me. But the atmosphere among, among the Polacks were very divided. Some\nwas not interested, not were very, you know, nothing. Some said it was good, what was happening\nand some were very, you know, sympathetic. But in, in our home, he was coming constantly and\ntelling me, my heart was, I didn\u2019t know when and how. And I didn\u2019t know for a long time. Until\nBlanca came and told me this was it. I understood, otherwise he would call or come out or\nsomething like that, but I don\u2019t want to believe it. Just won\u2019t believe it, you know. If you don\u2019t hear\nit, you don\u2019t believe it. This was that. It was a very tragic time, absolutely tragic for me when I\nfound out, really.",
        "A: It was when I was in Pruszkow and I went out to buy something. Germans raided up the areas\nagain for young people to go to Germany to work, they were slaves. And men and women. They\nwere young, young men and women. And I was -- I went out. Irene was, stayed home with the\npeople I lived with. And just to buy something, and suddenly, you know, there were four Germans\nand they said, \u201cYou come with us.\u201d My heart stood still. I knew that if I, they\u2019re going to take me to\nGermany, Irene is lost. So I started to tell them that I have a sick child, Krankenkind,\u201d> and\nKrankenhaus,\u201d\u00b0 I was afraid, I didn\u2019t know German and I am afraid that I would put in some\nYiddish words, you know. Krankenkind, Krankenhaus, my Krankenkind, Krankenhaus. So they say\nto me, \u201cWhere is your husband?\u201d So I didn\u2019t think long and I said -- Blanca was in Heidelberg \u2014 so\n*\u00b0 Sick child (German).\n6 Hospital (German).\nI said, \u201cIn Heidelberg.\u201d \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d And I said, \u201cHe\u2019s a mechanic.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat\nfirm?\u201d Blanca and Maria worked at Walter Kinzel, so I said, the Walter Kinzel. And it went just like\nthat, and they believed me. So one -- I had one soldier this side, one this, one front and in the back,\nthe big fish they caught, you know, me. So, one soldier said from the left side, \u201cLet her go, she has a\nsick child.\u201d When I heard that, I turned around and I run, I just run. And this was my quick thinking,\nyou know, knowing the Heidelberg know; the Walter Kinzel also, that I can get, you know, I can\nshoot! This was it, but he -- the answer, \u201cHe\u2019s a mechanic.\u201d And I run away and I came home. I\nwas, was out, you know, couldn\u2019t breathe.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how I sounded, I just was thinking quickly, and I said, I was scared to\ndeath! I didn\u2019t \u2014 I was...I didn\u2019t know what to do, I can only talk to them, you know. I was sure that\nI\u2019m going.",
        "A: Zygmunt Frydrych, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, they made the pact before, you know, the uprising, you know, when the uprising started.\nThey met and they said -- he had a wife and a child, Elza. She was born in 1936, was Elza. And\nwhoever lived through will take care of the other wife and the children. This was their pact. And\nFrydrych told me about it. Frydrych told me about it, yeah. It was after, when I met him, when I\nalready knew about, what Vladka told me, you know, and both of them, when Frydrych was killed\ntaking out people from the canals, after the Warsaw ghetto uprising, there was a certain village and\nthey were caught and there were five people were killed at that time and he was among them. And\nhis wife perished in Majdanek, she was taken before that. And Elza was with Polish people and she\nwas first in a convent, and then, you know, Mirek Edelman and a whole group were just following.\nElza stayed in the convent, and then after the Polish uprising, she was shifted to another place.\nThere were a few places and she was sick and tired of it. She was a young child, very bright,\nintelligent, beautiful. And in the end she settled, you know, they gave her to a Smith (ph) and they\nloved her and they really wanted her and she felt good with them. And all the time, you know,\nchanging places and loosing her security. She was very angry and bitter about that.\nAnd after the war, when they came for her, Mirek Edelman came with his wife, Ala, to take her\naway from that Polish family, she didn\u2019t want to go because her parents told her, \u201cRemember, never\ntell anybody that you are Jewish.\u201d And she didn\u2019t know after the war, after the war ended, she didn\u2019t\nknow anything, and the woman didn\u2019t want to give her away. She wanted to have her as her child,\nas a child of her own and so they gave her a lot of money and this way, they took Elza. And then it\nstarted the whole thing again, you know, from place to place. I was for her a mother. She loved\nIrene and the pact was following me, to take care of Elza. And there is a family here, Shatzkin, who\nadopted her. She had a tragic life she couldn\u2019t shed. Nervous breakdowns. And she always was\ncoming to me on the vacation, she was in Cornell when the vacation came. She always visited, not\nwith her parents, adopted parents, but with us, with Irene and me. And they were like siblings, you\nknow. To me she was like a daughter, really. But she had a few nervous breakdowns and, in the end,\nshe went to the hospital. Also, she got married, a professor from Columbia. He\u2019s better known now,\na historian. And that Sunday morning when she went to the hospital, she called me up and she said,\n\u2018\u201cRozka, I am going to meet my father and mother,\u201d because she knew that it will be drilling about\nher past, her childhood, and this and that. And then she committed suicide. In 1962, she committed\nsuicide. This was Elza. Irka was at that time in Europe. She didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t want to write to\nher. She could never forgive me that, but I didn\u2019t want to, I was afraid. I was really afraid. So she\nfound out, not from me, after she came back. It was a pure accident, from somebody else, not\nmyself. I prepared myself to tell her on the weekend I am home, to be with her. Doesn\u2019t work like\nthat. This was Elza, you know? Because they were good friends. Zygmunt was the one who brought\nback the news about Treblinka, you know. Very active, very active guy. Nice people. So little by\nlittle, everything was shrinking.",
        "A: I met Marek before, as I told you, I took Irene in there. We went to them and this is how I got\nthrough it. Halina Sheffner, you know. I went to them and this was the first time I saw him --\nMarek. You know, still during the war, after the uprising. He told me at that time what happened.\nWhat happened is that the whole group was on a attic trying to get through to another building.\nThey didn\u2019t know that there was a German with a gun, you know, standing -- I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s\ncalled.",
        "A: A machine gun, yeah. In a corner or where ever it was. And suddenly they realized and they\ncouldn\u2019t get through to the other building through the attics so Michal was the one. Michal was with\nMarek Edelman, the same group, was the one who jumped on him and killed him and the same time\nhe killed him. So the group could pass through, they survived, but Michal was killed. And the same\nevening, Marek Edelman buried Michal in the court, which now, later on, were ruins because the\nbuildings were burned and so on. But he gave him the funeral, you know. He just buried him over\nthere in the court, yeah. And this is what he told me at that time, when I went to visit him. But since\nI visited Mirek there, I got the contacted there, they gave me some money that I could have and I\nwas, could pay off some, which I was only, anyway I was doing some sewing there at night, being\nin Pruszkow, you know.\nThey give some money for our living, so I said, \u201cI can sew and I can do something for you,\u201d and she\nwas very happy about it. So I was sitting and sewing sometimes to two o\u2019clock at night, three\no\u2019clock at night and Irene was sleeping. It was only, you know, two rooms, one bedroom, was there.\nI was in the bedroom with Irene in one bed, another bed somebody else was sleeping there. And this\nis how it was.",
        "A: In Pruszk6w I was since the Polish uprising and they took us out to the Chleniec, I told you, until\nthe Soviet army came and, to Warsaw and then to us. In Warsaw, they were before, they came\nbefore and then they came to us and when I was seeing the, see the Soviet army, I was standing and\ncrying, you know, because I knew that we will stay alive already, so how much, you know, I have\nagainst them, I cannot forget that they brought me to freedom. And this was already with when\npeople, I had the contacts with the people so people already started to find out that I and Irene,\nwhich is a miracle that she was alive, with me. Found out that we are here and Boleck Ellenbogen\nhe was in Lublin at that time, a lot of --during Pol -- the Polish uprising, they just swim through the\nVistula, Wisla, to the other side, to the East side, and they could, you know, the Soviets were there\nalready. They just, just didn\u2019t come during the Polish uprising, they didn\u2019t want to, they want to kill\neach other, why not? So Boleck found out where we are and he was working for the Jewish\nCommittee over there already in Lublin. And one day, he already knew the address, my address, a\ncar stops by, not a car but a heavy, what I call \u2014 what they call the \u201cciezar\u00e9wka.\u2019\u201d\u2019 The big, you\nknow, they come with, with --",
        "A: Truck, yeah. He came with a truck and he brought me some food. Brought me all the goodies in\nthe world could be for Irene, and I remember he brought also cigarettes. I didn\u2019t smoke at that time\nalready. And chocolate and sardines and all kinds of things, and it was like, you know, manna from\nheaven. And I remember, I started to give Irene little by little the goodies, and Halina came so I\ngave her the cigarettes because she was smoking, heavily smoking. And I gave her all the goodies\nso Irene was, couldn\u2019t even reach the table but she was looking how Halina was eating, I gave her\nthis and I gave her that, so she asked me, \u201cMommy, will Pani Halina eat everything?\u201d So I said,\n\u201cNo, there are things for you too, don\u2019t worry.\u201d So this was, you know -- and he came twice with\nthe truck, you know, from Lublin. And he brought me food. And the third time came Marek\n7 Merchandise truck (Polish).\nEdelman, who took us to L\u00e9dz. We couldn\u2019t get trains to get to took us, it\u2019s not so easy to say.\nThere was one train a day and there were thousands, thousands of people so he took me and Irene.\nHe threw Irene through the window, somebody picked her up, then me, he carrying me, pushed also\nthrough the window and he somehow got to through a door, I don\u2019t know how. This was the way,\nthis was Mirek, you know? Always caring. This is how people, a whole group of people cared, you\nknow, when they knew somebody 1s, and they picked up Elza as I told you. People cared. Take\nBoleck, you know, how he came with food and all that. Because, first of all, a child alive at this time\nwas like, you know, a miracle. I was the only mother. There was also Gabrish, you know, Chana\nFryshdorf. They were in the partisans. But he was born in a bunker, born in the Polish uprising, and\nshe went out and she also was in that, but this was 1944 already. He was just born then. And she\nwas for a while, the Polish uprising finished, you know, it was -- and for a while she was in a village\nsomeplace.\nHe was the -- she looked like, you know, a hundred Jews. And the little one, the babies, nothing.\nBut after a while she came to Lodz to find out, she went to Warsaw and the committee was,\naddresses and names, she found out to be in L6dz so she came to L\u00e9dz and she found us, Chana\nFryshdorf. Her husband was killed in the partisans. He went for a project, you know. They had for\nthe trains to dynamite a train or something and was killed by the Germans and she stayed, you\nknow, pregnant with, there was the child. And she came to Lodz and she found us. She went back.\nShe brought Gaby, he was very sick also. He had some kind, around his ears, some infections all\naround his neck. And we stayed together since then, you know, this is the way. Gabrish (ph) 1s like a\nbrother to her, to Irka because Irka was the big sister. Another three years older, you know, that\u2019s\nall. Do you know? We created families. It was like one of us cared about the other, you know? And\nI had two, two towels I gave her one towel; two apples, I gave her one apple. For Gaby, you know,\nthis is, this is how it was. And we lived together. It was a while in Lodz after the war, we lived\ntogether. The Ellenbogens and Chana Fryshdorf and Halinka.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. She was just, you know, a good child, you know, and she was listening and I explained to\nher certain things. You cannot do this because of that, you know, in a very light way, not to scare\nher for anything. But she was listening. She didn\u2019t give me any trouble as a child. She was, she only\ngave me trouble later! But as a child, no, no. She was very good.\nShe was very sporty, too. Boleck in Sweden put her on a, on a bicycle and went on a hill and said,\n\u201cYou just hold the brakes and go down, and then stop.\u201d She did it. Said to me, he said, \u201cYou go\nhome. You go in, I'll take care of her.\u201d So, this was that. She was going swimming there in Sweden.\nThat is why this is a different chapter already.",
        "A: We were so busy with every day life: how to get through, how to bring a -- let\u2019s say Chana and I.\nThen I got an apartment -- no -- I lived with Boleck, the Ellenbogens. My one removed cousin met\nme, he was in the Polish army. And he was always in the uniform. He wasn\u2019t in the army anymore,\nbut he was very tall, handsome, and he went to all these officers and he said, \u201cZychlinski, I am\nZychlinski, General Zychlinski,\u201d or something like that. \u201cI need an apartment.\u201d They gave him.\n\u201cThis was in my name because nobody could get apartments at that time. I said that \u201cI am a widow\nwith a child and I need an apartment.\u201d And then, you know it was a one bedroom apartment and I\ntook in the Ellenbogens. The apartment was in my name, and he was working for the Journal at that\ntime, and from Lodz for the Committee. And we lived together as a family. Whatever we had, you\nknow, brought in, we gave the money. I got some money, very little, but I remember that the Zared\n(ph) -- this is from the Bundist Committee -- they send me some money at that time and then my\nfamily, my aunt, Michal\u2019s aunt from the States, used to send me a few dollars here and there, but it\nwent all to the common, you know, account. That\u2019s all. And this is how we lived there. It was, you\nknow, a family. Boleck used to go with Irene, you know, for walks. We used to do some sewing and\nat home for somebody. Anna also with me, and this is how we lived.",
        "A: Yes, once Irene was playing downstairs with the children and she came up and she said, \u201cMa!\nThis boy told -- called me \u2018zydowka,\u201d\u201d\u201d\u00ae -- you know -- Jewess. \u201cWhat does it mean, \u2018zydowka\u2019?\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t understand that. But this is an example, a child comes up. And then there were\nconstantly killings, they were killing, murders. And we decided to go away at that time. It was\nantisemitism, it was. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they finish up everybody?\u201d So it wasn\u2019t easy, but to Lodz came a\nlot of people. The same thing to Warsaw, the survivors looking for the families; they stayed here or\nthere. In all kind, but the atmosphere was very bad. Then we decided, the, the Jacob Patt came to\nPoland and he said that he can take, give some visas, you know? To Sweden. Sweden was taking in\npeople. And of course, I gave -- I was on the list with Irene because of Michal\u2019s aunt here. But to\ntell you about the atmosphere, to go by train to Gdynia, this is the port of Poland. There we could\ntake the boat to Sweden. Two women, Polish women, went with us, we with children. It was Chana\nFryshdorf, Gaby, and I was with Irene in our, in our train. In case something happens, \u201cThis 1s their\nchildren,\u201d because they were taking down people from the trains and killing. So, once came\nsomebody to our apartment with a gun and looking for somebody. Luckily, it was a mistake. You\nknow, Boleck was at that time; I was at that time, Irene was asleep, it was in the evening. To kill\nsomebody because they had some kind of account, who knows? But it was very dangerous. Kielce.\nYou know about Kielce? This was 1946! We left 1946, the first, the 31\u00b0 of March, I think so. So\nthis was very dangerous to live. So we had, it was us, some Polish people to go with us in case the\nchildren are not theirs. Always the children and if they take us, okay, but the children are there. So\nthis is how it was, you know, in Poland.\n*8 Jewess (Polish).",
        "A: Sweden was, Agonide (ph), it was Eden. Really Eden. Irene used to say that this was my\nhappiest years in my life. It was beautiful. Sweden was so, you know, like -- first of all, from\nStockholm we were, how many \u2014 21 minutes I think from Stockholm by train, a choo-choo train.\nBeautiful. It was really like Eden, you know. The children were wonderful there. This is where\nIrene was going bicycling and swimming and school. She spoke Swedish like a Swedish-born child\nimmediately. She went to school. The people were very nice to us. They always invited me and\nIrene for coffee and cookies and she was playing with the children then. She spoke. We didn\u2019t never\nlock the doors at night. When Chana said, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy some milk at the store,\u201d you know\ncountry store, and she gave her a little, you know, back with a few Swedish crowns, she said,\n\u201cWhere is your bag?\u201d A pocket book, Irene had. \u201cOh, I left it on the bench over there.\u201d I said, \u201cGo\nand pick it up.\u201d She said, \u201cNaw, [ll take it tomorrow.\u201d She found it tomorrow. So, this was the kind\nof life, you know. It was nature around. She was playing with Gaby and she was going by herself\nwith the bicycle, swimming over the, the, the, the trains, you know, were passing by, people were\nmarvelous there, really. And we had a whole group. I was always, I don\u2019t like to live in groups, so\nwe had two buildings. One was a big building with a lot of survivors and we were only three\nfamilies in this building, you know, where we lived. And it was marvelous. Everybody cared about\nthe other and we could go to the city with Chana and Chana\u2019s brother\u2019s wife took care of the\nchildren, to go to sleep, you know, or something like that.\nWe started to work, both. She was a very good children\u2019s dressmaker. So we went to the biggest\nstore in Melbourne, in Melbourne. This is Australia already. I was in Australia for a time. And this\nis in Stockholm, and we did some work for them. And then we sent it by mail, by, by, by the train,\nthey picked it up and they send it. This is how we, but it was very, very close. I created a library\nthere.",
        "A: In Stockholm.",
        "A: This was the Jewish Labor Committee branch and there were lots of survivors in Sweden. And\neverybody was longing for a book, for Yiddish book, for a Polish book, or something like that. I\nwrote the Jewish Labor Committee to send me books, a lot of books. They sent hundreds of books,\nthey did send. And I made catalogs, you know, and addresses I had, I sent them the catalogs, copies\nof catalogs, everything by hand. And they wrote me what they want, with numbers, they wrote me\nback what they want, and then I prepared the books and the office of the Jewish Labor Committee\nsent them out in the morning. But this was in the evening, I was going to Stockholm. It wasn\u2019t\nduring the day, I was busy with, I had Irene and whatever I had to do. But this I was doing for over\nthree years in Sweden, you know. But we had a whole group of friends and, over there. And this is\nhow we \u2014 that we came here.",
        "A: I came here the 11th of April, 1949. I came here on the suppose to pass by United States and to\ngo to Australia, I had a permit to Australia, thinking that I would go to Australia. I had my family in\nAustralia, at that time. My sister was in Australia already.",
        "A: Anka, yes. Gina perished, you know. And I had only ten days. Chana Fryshdorf left two months\nbefore. Through a certain way, you know? But she couldn\u2019t take Gaby. When she comes to the\nStates she could claim Gaby, to bring him over there. So Gaby stayed with me for two months.\nAnd meanwhile, Sweden also, I was, you know, learning English because I knew where ever I land,\nI need to know the English. So a woman, a German woman was a teacher of English. She used to\ncome to our neglingon (ph), the place called, and giving lessons. So there were groups, but I had to\nbe alone. I went a full hour, not with a group, and I learned. I learned grammar, I read Steinbeck\nalready.",
        "A: But this was British English. Another thing, when I came here and I opened the radio and I\ncouldn\u2019t understand a word, I started to cry because this was the American English and I learned, I\nlearned British English. I couldn\u2019t speak, you know, but I was reading and writing. So this was also,\nyou know, what we did in Sweden. So I came here and I brought Gaby with me, which was a nice\nthing, on the boat. At that time, in 1949, it was an order from the immigration department that\nnobody can land in New York, only first have got to Ellis Island. This was order and no, even with\nvisas, not only passing by, cannot go. I didn\u2019t know about it. Nobody told me. Gaby was secured,\n\u201c\u2018bamaters (ph)\u201d as here, you know? She was legally, you know, here. But I didn\u2019t know about it at\nall. And during the passage, there was a young woman who really was with me constantly. She was\ngoing on a regular, not a legal visa, to her sister here. But she was so, she was from a camp or\nsomething, very depressed. But I took her under my wing, so, I said, \u201cYou have to go to the doctors,\nthere was this child, you go first to the doctors.\u201d I gave her one child, she go before me and I went\nafter that. This kind of thing. And her sister was also there when we arrived. They let them come on\nthe boat, you know, aboard. So, and I said that they keep her, they don\u2019t let her go, she has to go to\nEllis Island. From Ellis Island she can go to her sister. I wondered why, but I couldn\u2019t talk to her\nbecause I was the next one. So, Chana Fryshdorf was there with Bernard Goldstein (ph), was\nanother one, survivor, also.\nAnd so, first of all, I clear Gaby. I said, \u201cThe mother is here, she can pick him up,\u201d you know, the\nmother. And Gaby is through. Then I come and I supposed to go, Gaby shouldn\u2019t have gone to Ellis\nIsland as a child, but all the other passengers with visas, legal visas, had to go to Ellis Island, from\nEllis Island they had to release them. Next, I come. So, I give my passport, all these documents for\nclearing and he said, \u201cNow, you go to Ellis Island.\u201d He talked fast. So I said to him, it was my\nkhutspe, I said, \u201cYou speak very good English but too fast.\u201d He take the stamps, he put \u2018pass\u2019. Can\nyou imagine such a thing? I was the only one with Irene who passed. If I would go to Ellis Island, I\nwouldn\u2019t be here today, because I only had 10 days and they send everybody out. In transit, I was in\ntransit. But this is what I said, this is what works. My khutspe, I said, \u201cYou speak very good\nEnglish, but too fast.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what this Ellis Island, I didn\u2019t know what he is talking about.\nAnd I got stamped \u2018pass\u2019. So this is how I came here.",
        "A: Yeah. Australia was for me too far. From what, and from whom, I don\u2019t know, up to now. I was\nfour times in Australia. Every 10 years I was going to Australia.",
        "A: No. I was afraid that for Irene it wouldn\u2019t be good somehow. I don\u2019t know why. Far, far away,\nAustralia. Who knows about Australia?",
        "A: Oh, no. I had a very hard time, very hard time. Until I established myself -- who I am, what I am.\nWith Irene being a child and this English she didn\u2019t know at all. It was very difficult. She was very\nsensitive for me going away to work and being alone. It was a very difficult period for me. Very\ndifficult.",
        "A: The circumstances, you know? The stretches of, between one and the other. It was, I got the\napartment amalgamated. It\u2019s a beautiful apartment but, you know, because they, they cared. The\nJewish Labor Committee brought me over. So this is -- I had a very difficult time here. The\nbeginning was very, I didn\u2019t know what to do and Irene, first of all, you know, Irene, I was afraid to\nleave her. The school, she was scared, she was very scared. See, we came in April, the 11th of\nApril, and Dr. Patt arranged for her to go to the workman\u2019s circle camp for the summer. In fact, she\nwent. She spoke the beautiful Swedish. She went to the camp, she lost the Swedish and came back\nwith an English, you know? Just like that.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t, you know, when she came to school, I put her in school, nearby. This was nearby. So\nthe teacher wrote about her. Here today came to our class a little girl with two braids, with two bows\nand a bow on top, you know. Very, very, very sweet, something like that, you know. And she didn\u2019t\nknow. I remember that once was, you know, the fire alarm. You know, the children run out and I\nrun out because I was afraid, I heard it, that she\u2019ll be scared and this girl was scared of this. Again,\nyou know, because she knew about the bombarding and that. She was very much scared. It was not\ngood for her, for me going away in that sense. I started to work in the designing room because I was\nvery good with my hand always. Was working for a while and she was alone home and I had to rent\nthe bedroom. We were sleeping in the living room because the rent was fifty dollars and I couldn\u2019t\nspend the 50 dollars. So I was working, sewing, and it was very difficult, very difficult. And then I\nstarted to work at the YIVO,\u2019\u2019, you know, because of the director of the YIVO. With the\nConference of Claims, you know. They started to get the money and he knew me from Poland. Dr.\nFriedman, Philip Friedman.",
        "A: Yes. He knew me from Poland. And he got in touch with me, he wanted me to work for him, so\nand I worked for him. Since then, I was working for eight years at the YIVO, on Holocaust all the\ntime. Then he died in 1960.",
        "A: Yes. You\u2019ll see my name there.",
        "A: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, and then took over, Dr. Robinson took it over, after his death. And I was working in the\npublic library, you know, looking for material constantly. For months, I was working at the public\nlibrary. And he -- Dr. Robinson -- used to come and put material. He gave me new material to work\non, constantly. So, until 1962 I was working in at the YIVO. And one day, Dr. Robinson\napproached me. I was his right hand, you know? Same thing as Friedman, also. And he approached\nme, said that somebody approached him from the Joint.\u00b0\u00b0 They need a person for the archives,\nwhether he has somebody. And he told me that I have chosen you. I was shocked. I said, \u201cDr.\nRobinson, why do you want to get rid of me? Is something wrong?\u201d He said no. He put his arms\naround me and said, \u201cI know you have a daughter. You have no insurance here. We\u2019ll probably\nfinish in 1964,\u201d because it was ten years the claims confidence gave money for this project and this\nwill be it. \u201cYou might stay in the YIVO, but you won\u2019t ever have the insurance, health insurance,\u201d\nor, you know, the wages -- I was making 60 dollars a week. And, but she had everything. Irene had\nalways everything, you know. She didn\u2019t feel it. And, \u201cThere is a good possibility for you.\u201d There\nwas 35 people in our plant. I was shocked: \u201cWhy do you want to get rid of me?\u201d Anyway, so I\nspoke to Dr. Patt. He was a very good friend of mine. Excellent friend who take care of Irka, you\nknow, Pel\u2019s (ph) wife. Meanwhile, I got sick again, you know, my thyroid.",
        "A: Yes. And so I spoke to him, I said, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you yesterday\nthere.\u201d\u2019 And I trusted him because he took really good care of us. Hyman (ph) Helswise (ph) and his\nfriend, a very close friend was. And this way, you know, I left the YIVO. They made me a party.\nJoint Distribution Committee\nHave a beautiful crystal from that. There was a beautiful speech from Dr. Robinson, you know, and\nI went to the Joint. Then it\u2019s sad that it\u2019s a new era.",
        "A: Yes. I could make more money if I would have the khutspe to ask. If I made 4000 the YIVO, I\nasked for 5000. I could ask for 7000. I didn\u2019t. They grabbed me because of the recommendation of\nDr. Robinson, you know. He came once. I asked him to come and take a look what I am doing\nbecause I put in a new system. Completely. And he approved everything. So this way, you know, it\nwas because first of all I had insurance. For me, for her. That\u2019s very important. The work was very\ngratifying. So was at the YIVO, the working. Very gratifying for me. So this is a new era started.",
        "A: Only.",
        "A: Only, yeah. Up to now I am in contact with \u2014 they constantly send me, you know, the Katzki\naffair. It was sixty years of Katzki and to my, executive director treated me, you know, also, and he\nsaid, \u201cMrs. Klepfisz, you don\u2019t know how much we are missing you here. Such a mess.\u201d They\ndidn\u2019t print one single catalog since my going away. I left six catalogs of described material at the\narchives. Six catalogs. No, not one.",
        "A: So they won\u2019t go back to work, sure. I wouldn\u2019t go back.",
        "A: Well, the child. Just the child, you know. I was just devastated with, with all my family gone.\nThis is the only thing, you know, which I can keep alive was the child. And everything in my power\nI did to keep her alive, you know? Because of that, I had to live. Otherwise I would be, I was\ncompletely devastated, you know. If not this, what\u2019s holding me, I would just give up. What will be\nwill be. I wouldn\u2019t do anything else.",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you something. If I would have to tell this story, you know, what really, with what\nhappened all the time it would take, I don\u2019t even know whether I could find the real words to\ndescribe. I don\u2019t think we have -- we don\u2019t have the vocabulary, all these words to describe what we\nlived through. And sometimes I wonder now, and I spoke about it to some friends. I really don\u2019t\nknow from where I took all the strength to get through all these years. I really don\u2019t know. And I\ncannot understand how I did it. I really can\u2019t understand how I did it. It was by, what kind of force\nwas pushing me to do this or that, to decide, all kinds of things, which came out good decisions, but\nI don\u2019t know. I really, and to describe the feelings, the life, what we went through, I don\u2019t think\nthere is a real vocabulary that has all the words for it.",
        "A: I thank you Joan for being very kind, very subtle and delicate in this respect. I want to thank you\nfor that.\nEnd of Tape 4\nConclusion of Interview\n"
