And it\u2019s hard to make a living there,\nin Israel right now. And my uncle wrote the letter to come over here. I didn\u2019t know what he is\ndoing. He brought me into his house, you know, the big f -- big house, took me in and my wife,\nand at that time I came, I had my son with me. We stayed with them. It didn\u2019t work out too good,\nbecause he, my uncle, is -- his niece was a single girl. When they brought me in over here, they\nalways had in the mind I\u2019m going to come in, marry that girl. When I brought my wife, wasn\u2019t so\n-- they weren\u2019t too happy. So when I find out what it 1s, I decided to move to go someplace else.\nSo a friend of mine was from my own town, and he knew that I\u2019m not getting along, but no\nfights, just I know that it\u2019s not a good feeling there. So he said, move into my house. He has a\none bedroom house, and I moved in in the living room, we had a bed on the floor and we stayed\ntogether for a little bit. Then I got in -- I met a guy that is looking for a job, so I find out the guy\nhas a [indecipherable], and his wife was my older sister\u2019s best girlfriend in Koretz. So when he\nfinds I\u2019m over here, so he can start talk to me, what do you want to do in America? I says, I will\ndo anything, I just want a job. So he took me out one day, he drove around with me. He said, I\u2019m\nbuilding here and I\u2019m building -- it was a big building. And then we pass by a lumber yard that\nsays a -- a few Jewish people working over there, I -- I couldn\u2019t speak nothing in English, you\nknow. He said, maybe you want to work over here, I says good. So, next morning I went to work\nover there. And I worked there for a few months, and before [indecipherable] he came into me\none day, he says, everybody likes you over here. I want you to be the buyer to buy the lumber. I\nsaid, buy the lumber for what? I don\u2019t know how to talk. How do you gonna buy it? He said,\nwell, I'll hire, I got a girl over here, a Polish girl, and she\u2019ll work with you together. You do the\nbuying. I says, you\u2019re making fun of me. He said no. So, before I turn around they made me the\nforeman, then I started doing the buying in the lumber yard.",

        "A: Mostly Jewish, and Polish.",
        "Q: But you -- so you knew Polish?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But -- but not English or German?",
        "A: No, not enough English, nothing. So, we worked there for awhile, and came back\nChristmastime, and I couldn\u2019t go, I couldn\u2019t drive, I didn\u2019t have no license or nothing. So a guy\nused to pick me up all the time, take me back to work. And this was about 20 miles. But the guy\nwas nice to doing it, because [indecipherable] the boss in there. But by about two years I was\nworking over there, and everybody find out with me I\u2019m a good worker. And they don\u2019t pay me\ntoo much. As [indecipherable] pay me 50 dollars a week, seven days a week, and I didn\u2019t care, I\nmake maybe [indecipherable] somebody else [indecipherable] 75 dollars a week. So I go back to\nhim, I tell, Harry, I says 75 dollars. He says, Do-Don\u2019t worry about, Pll give you 75. And then I\nwant -- had -- need a car, so I got -- I got [indecipherable] license, I bought an old car, and I have\nto pay for the car, it\u2019s 800 dollars. I haven\u2019t got no money. So they say, we\u2019re gonna loan you the\nmoney, and we\u2019ll take off 20 dollars a week for your salaries. Okay. So it goes by a week, two,\nthree, they\u2019re not taking out the money. So I go back to him, I says, wait a minute, I can\u2019t afford\nit, you didn\u2019t take out the money. [indecipherable] the money, you\u2019re supposed to take it from\nthe -- my salary. Said, no, no, no, you cannot do it. He says, you have to pay right now for the\nfour weeks. Well, okay, I have to, I have to, take it all, the whole thing, you know. And then\n[indecipherable] he said no, don\u2019t worry about it, the car is a present for you. You know, that\nmade -- made a -- a big deal, yeah. And [indecipherable] open up the lumber yard\n[indecipherable] the two partners. They fight -- fighting between them and he come to me and\nsays to me, you know what? We closing up the place. I want you to go into business. You take\nover the place. I says, I\u2019m gonna take over the place? I ain\u2019t got no money. Then he says, well,\nwe'll work it out somehow. So, he went, he brought me another guy, he says, that guy\u2019s gonna\ngo in partners with you. So another guy comes in the partners and start talking to me. He say,\nwe\u2019re gonna go into business, does he have any money. I says no, do you have any money? He\nsays no. So what are we going? Says well, the people what you deal with them with buying, go\ninto Mr. Martin, tell him that you want to go into business. So I go and tell the guys they\u2019re\ngonna go in business. He says okay -- I-I -- I was buying for them. He says, show me your\nstatement. I said, what\u2019s a statement? I didn\u2019t know nothing [indecipherable]. So I stayed with\nthem for awhile, then I stay with a partner, and going to the -- to the banker that didn\u2019t know me\nfrom somebody -- from the other people. I said the same thing, I want to go into business, but I\nneed money. Said the same thing, give me a statement. So, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019 re talking\nabout. Make the story short, the guy gave me 3,000 dollars credit, [indecipherable] give me\n3,000 dollars credit. And we got [indecipherable] in the business, had good customers, the\n[indecipherable] was a big builder and he paid me every week.

He brought me into his house, you know, the big f -- big house, took me in and my wife,\nand at that time I came, I had my son with me. We stayed with them. It didn\u2019t work out too good,\nbecause he, my uncle, is -- his niece was a single girl. When they brought me in over here, they\nalways had in the mind I\u2019m going to come in, marry that girl. When I brought my wife, wasn\u2019t so\n-- they weren\u2019t too happy.

So they say, we\u2019re gonna loan you the\nmoney, and we\u2019ll take off 20 dollars a week for your salaries. Okay. So it goes by a week, two,\nthree, they\u2019re not taking out the money. So I go back to him, I says, wait a minute, I can\u2019t afford\nit, you didn\u2019t take out the money. [indecipherable] the money, you\u2019re supposed to take it from\nthe -- my salary. Said, no, no, no, you cannot do it. He says, you have to pay right now for the\nfour weeks. Well, okay, I have to, I have to, take it all, the whole thing, you know. And then\n[indecipherable] he said no, don\u2019t worry about it, the car is a present for you. You know, that\nmade -- made a -- a big deal, yeah. And [indecipherable] open up the lumber yard\n[indecipherable] the two partners. They fight -- fighting between them and he come to me and\nsays to me, you know what? We closing up the place. I want you to go into business. You take\nover the place. I says, I\u2019m gonna take over the place? I ain\u2019t got no money. Then he says, well,\nwe'll work it out somehow. So, he went, he brought me another guy, he says, that guy\u2019s gonna\ngo in partners with you. So another guy comes in the partners and start talking to me. He say,\nwe\u2019re gonna go into business, does he have any money. I says no, do you have any money? He\nsays no. So what are we going? Says well, the people what you deal with them with buying, go\ninto Mr. Martin, tell him that you want to go into business. So I go and tell the guys they\u2019re\ngonna go in business. He says okay -- I-I -- I was buying for them. He says, show me your\nstatement. I said, what\u2019s a statement? I didn\u2019t know nothing [indecipherable]. So I stayed with\nthem for awhile, then I stay with a partner, and going to the -- to the banker that didn\u2019t know me\nfrom somebody -- from the other people. I said the same thing, I want to go into business, but I\nneed money. Said the same thing, give me a statement. So, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019 re talking\nabout. Make the story short, the guy gave me 3,000 dollars credit, [indecipherable] give me\n3,000 dollars credit. And we got [indecipherable] in the business, had good customers, the\n[indecipherable] was a big builder and he paid me every week.
