        "Question: Good morning, Peter.",
        "Answer: Good morning, Joan.",
        "Q: Nice to have you here.",
        "A: It\u2019s great to be here.",
        "Q: Peter, can you just tell me what your name was at birth, was it --",
        "A: It was Peter -- Peter Black, has been all my life.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Boston, Massachusetts --",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: -- and grew up in the suburbs of Boston.",
        "Q: And what -- what month and year were you born?",
        "A: December 29\", 1950.",
        "Q: And tell me just a little bit about your -- your family background, and your childhood, just a\nbit.",
        "A: I grew up in a Boston Jewish family, non-Jewish, no temple, as my son will say now. And I\nstayed in Boston til I was 17 and went to the University of Wisconsin for undergraduate school,\nfinished my graduate studies at Columbia University. I was certainly satisfied growing up in\nBoston, but anxious to get away, as any teenager might be.",
        "Q: And were you always interested in history?",
        "A: Yes. I did actually begin with a -- after the traditional dinosaub session as a young child.",
        "Q: What\u2019s dinosaub?",
        "A: Dinosaub session. As in dinosaurs, those beasts that rock the --",
        "Q: Aha, dinosaurs, I see, it\u2019s your Boston accent.",
        "A: Yeah, rock the earth --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- millions of years before. I went through a Civil War interest period, and about the time of\nthe appearance of William Shirer\u2019s book, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\u201d I began to\nbecome interested in the military history of World War II, and that matured into an interest in the\npolitical history of the second World War, and the Nazi regime by my high school years.",
        "Q: And when you went to University of Wisconsin, was George Masse there?",
        "A: George Masse was there, my decision to go to Wisconsin was dictated in part by the desire to\nget away, and in part by the strength of the history department there. And I worked with a\nscholar on the Nazi regime, and particularly, the particular interest in the SS, Robert Kale.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Who had been teaching at Wisconsin until very recently --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- he retired just a couple of years ago.",
        "Q: So did you t -- also take any courses with George Masse?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t take any courses with George Masse and that was because I decided to take a junior\nyear abroad and took most of my German history courses in Germany at the University of Bohn.\nBy the time I came back and was eligible for the upperclassman courses for -- that Mosse and\nHammereau, who was also another major scholar at the University of Wisconsin, were teaching,\nI had already run out of my requirements, and had to take other than history courses or non-\nEuropean history courses to complete the degree.",
        "Q: Did you ever sneak in and watch him lecture?",
        "A: Yes, on occasion, on occasion.",
        "Q: And what did you think?",
        "A: I thought he was great.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He was a wonderful lecturer and I certainly used his source material at the time. At that time\nhe was perhaps most famous for his book, \u201cThe Crisis of German Ideology,\u201d which came out in\nthe mid-60\u2019s.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And this book was in part instrumental in educating me as to the root of the nat -- roots of the\nNazi ideology, that is the intellectual roots of the Nazi ideology.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So when you went to Columbia, why w -- why the choice to Columbia, not to stay at\nWisconsin, do you think?",
        "A: I had wanted to stay at Wisconsin, but at the time my professor, Professor Kale was going\nthrough a difficult personal time, and he -- as it turned out wisely for me, said that he was not\ngoing to take on any new students at this time and advised that -- advised strongly that I should\ngo to Columbia. At Columbia I worked under Professor Ishtvan Dayak, who was an east\nEuropean scholar, but had excellent contacts in the former countries of the hap -- the former\ncountries that made up the old Hapsburg monarchy. And between the Columbia University name\nand Dayak\u2019s contacts, it eventually opened up some doors in central and eastern Europe that\nmight not have been opened had I stayed at Wisconsin.",
        "Q: And how did you continue your work at Columbia? What was your major -- this -- this --",
        "A: I came to Columbia with the idea of majoring in central and east European history. There was\nmore financial aid available for east European history. This was the early 70\u2019s, in the time of\nd\u00e9tente, and it was very -- very important that young people study the history of this region, in\nfact there were national defense scholarships for study of east European languages and I obtained\none for studying Romanian. But primarily I went with the idea of studying German policy in\nAustria and in eastern Europe and that became my field of concentration.",
        "Q: Let me go back a little bit. Was there any -- besides the intellectual connection, and -- and the\ninterest starting from Shirer\u2019s book, was there a personal connection in your family to World\nWar II and the Holocaust that wa -- was also important for you, or --",
        "A: No, no, this was -- this was purely coming at it through history, and -- and frankly through\nmilitary history. My family had, for the most part, had the good fortune, or perhaps the bad\nfortune to be the victims of pogroms or Tsarist draft notices, and fled to the New World at the\nbeginning of this century. So with rare exceptions, particularly some cousins in Romania, who\nmanaged to survive the war in Romania, most of the family was over in the United States before\nWorld War I.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So when -- you graduated Columbia when? [indecipherable]",
        "A: I got the PhD in 1981.",
        "Q: 1981. And you decided not to teach, or -- si -- wa -- I had [indecipherable] you moved into --",
        "A: Well that -- that -- that wasn\u2019t my decision exactly. The 70\u2019s was a very difficult time for new\ngraduates coming out and obtaining teaching jobs. I had had a couple of the -- they call them\nthousand dollar courses now, at that time I think they were 500 dollar courses. I\u2019d taught a\ncourse on early modern European history, and I was scheduled to teach a course on World War IT\nand on eastern Europe at Columbia when I was called by a representative of the U.S. attorney\u2019s\noffice in New York, and asked whether I would be interested in working for a short term period,\ngathering evidence for a case against a Nazi offender. In this particular case it was a Latvian\nauxiliary policeman named Boleslaus Maikovskis, who -- whose case had been publicized on\n\u201c60 Minutes\u201d some six months earlier, in the spring of 1978. So I was not only aware of the case,\nI was also -- I was also interested in the work, and should -- little anecdote that goes with that\ncall, at the time I received the call, I was working in a fairly dead end job putting data onto\ncomputer sheets on the other side of the justice department\u2019s suit against the telephone company\nat that time, the AT & T, which was the telephone company at that time. And it was a pretty\ndead-end job and I was home sick, suffering from a kidney stone, and about ready to go to the\nhospital when the call came in. And I had been feeling very sorry for myself, and thinking idly\nthat it was too bad that I was too young to have been around at the time of the Nuremberg Trials.\nSo it was almost like a stroke of a -- a divine stroke that that call came in at that time, and when\nasked if I was interested in working on such a project, I said, just let me pass the kidney stone,\nPll be right in for an interview.",
        "Q: Le -- let me ask you a question a bit about graduate school, just t -- t-to know what the texture\nwas at the -- at the time. Were there a lot of people studying World War II, and the Nazis and the\n-- the Holocaust, or the structure of the Nazi regime, or were you an oddity at the time at\nColumbia? I mean, what -- what was it like?",
        "A: Columbia didn\u2019t have at that time, a specific World War II scholar. It did have a strong\neastern European department, but its modern -- its eastern European modernist, Voytek Mastney,\nwho was my professor my first year at Columbia didn\u2019t get tenure and had to leave at the end of\n1972 - 1973. He went on to post-war studies in Communism. And that was the focus at\nColumbia University, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t -- there wasn\u2019t a generation of\nscholars, not studying the Holocaust per se, because that was still very much a political term, and\nnot the term of [indecipherable] for this period as yet, certainly not in academic parlance. But\nthere were a group of scholars who had been spawned and encouraged by the availability of\ncaptured German records on microfilm at the national archives. They were first available in an\neasy to use format on the microfilm in the early 1960\u2019s. And this was also the time in which the\noriginals, which had been captured by the U.S. army, were returned to the Federal Republic of\nGermany in the mid-60\u2019s, according to treaty. And we -- I was sort of at the tail end of that\ngeneration of young scholars who were interested in the Nazi regime, and interested in the\norganizations of the Nazi regime, and also fascinated with the personnel files of the individuals,\nfascinated with the ideas of -- of motivate -- what made these people tick, and how did they\noperate as individuals and as an organization. And that spawned my interest in the SS, and my\ninterest in doing a biography.",
        "Q: Was -- was Hillberg\u2019s work important to you at that time, or not?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: It was.",
        "A: Hillberg\u2019s work came out in 1961 --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and he was one of the earliest part of that generation. Hillberg had actually worked with the\ncaptured German records, analyzed as a document analyst in the late 40\u2019s and early 50\u2019s, and\nwrote his book based on that documentation before it was microfilmed, and you can tell that\nfrom the citations in his book, he still has the original file folder numbers there. And his book\nfirst came out in 1961 and by the time I was ready to get serious when I started college in \u201968, a\npaperback version was out, and easily available even to a poor graduate student.",
        "Q: Right, right, that Bible -- that Bible-looking --",
        "A: Yes, it was a Bible even then.",
        "Q: Right, yes. All right, so you get the call, and you obviously passed your kidney stone.",
        "A: I did, not without difficulty, but I did.",
        "Q: Right. So then what happened? What\u2019s the next -- what\u2019s the next step? Your --",
        "A: Well basically I went in to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the southern district of New York in\nsouth Manhattan, was interviewed by an attorney there, and he gave me the information a -- his\nname was Tom Balout, was a lawyer from Connecticut who\u2019s long since gone into private\npractice. And he told me a little bit about the Maikovskis case, and about the problems with the\nMaikovskis case, and he explained to me that the members of the special litigation unit in\nWashington, D.C., which had been formed the year earlier, 1977, and which had recently, in the\nspring of 1978 expanded to a staff of approximately four lawyers, two paralegals and one part-\ntime historian, needed someone who was based in New York, who could conduct research in the\narchives in New York, the main one of which was the Yiddish institute for Jewish research,\nwhich at that time was located on the corner of East 81\u2018 Street, and I believe it was Fifth\nAvenue.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they had been canvassing a-around in Washington for contacts, and one of the attorneys\nat the time, George Parker, had talked to my first advisor at Columbia, Voytek Mastney, who\nwas on a stint with Johns Hopkins at the time. And Mastney recom -- recommended me as a\npossibility, that\u2019s how they got my name. And I came in, and --",
        "Q: So did you go down to Washington to talk with these folks, or did you s --",
        "A: No, I was hired from New York.",
        "Q: From New York, so -- okay.",
        "A: And I was based in the New York office from -- from my start date in September \u201978, until\nshortly after the office was moved from the immigration service, was called the special litigation\nunit, under the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and it was moved into the criminal\ndivision in May, 1979. Six months after that I had already requested a transfer, and I requested\nalso to be able to work pa -- full time. And they were interested in me, and they brought me\ndown on January first, 1980.",
        "Q: And by that time Ryan, Alan Ryan was -- was -- was OSI formed at that point?",
        "A: OSI was for --",
        "Q: Was taken out of --",
        "A: -- OSI was formed in May 1979, and -- under a temporary director, Walter Rockler, who had\nbeen a Nuremberg prosecutor. I believe -- I\u2019m not sure, I believe he was a prosecutor in the\nDeutshe Bank case at Nuremberg. And he was brought in by the criminal division to reorganize\nthe special litigation unit, expand its staff, and deploy it effectively as a central agency to\ninvestigate and if necessary litigate all of the Nazi offender cases in the United States. Rockler\nwas the director from September -- I\u2019m sorry, he was the director from May 1979 until\napproximately March 1980. I believe it was a nine month detail, or a 10 month detail. And Ryan\nwas brought on as the deputy sometime in -- he was there when I moved down to Washington, so\nit must have been sometime in 1979. And then he -- he came -- Ryan came from the solicitor\ngeneral\u2019s office in the Department of Justice, and he took over as director when Rockler\nwithdrew and went back to private practice in March 1980.",
        "Q: Right. So tell me a little bit about this first case that you did in New York. What -- what --\nwhat were they asking you to do? They were asking you to go to the archives and find -- can you\ntalk about that?",
        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t -- they didn't really know what to ask me to do. They asked me to find\nevidence about this case, and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what they wanted me to do either, so I did --\nwhat I did know how to do was go to then -- go to the published records, the Nuremberg trial\nrecords, and put together, I think it was about a 10 or a 15 or 20 page essay on the Latvian\nauxiliary police in -- in -- under German occupation in 1941. Maikovskis was accused of having\nbeen a precinct chief in an eastern region of Latvia, around Rezekne, Rossitten in German. And\nhe had been accused of participating in killings of local Jews in the summer and autumn of 1941.\nAnd I went to some of the basic sources, there\u2019s a lengthy Nuremberg document which was\nwritten by the commander of the security police, in SD in the Baltic States, the former\nEinsatzgruppen chief, Walter Stahlecker, which was a lengthy report of about, oh, 250 pages\ndealing with the German occupation of the Baltic States and the operations of the police, in\nparticular the auxiliary police. We also had in New York, copies of the Einsatzgruppen reports,\nwhich were on microfilm at the time, and I reviewed those and gathered the material that were\nrelevant to Latvian auxiliary police killings of Jews and others in Latvia in the summer of 1941,\nand I put it together in a basic historical essay that I would write as a college paper at that time.\nThis was before I had the PhD., and in fact it was at the time when I was writing the PhD.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And the attorney was pleasantly surprised, and particularly by the speed in which it was\ngathered. It wasn\u2019t such a big thing to a historian, but it was obviously something that was very\nhelpful to the attorney. And the reason for that was that the case had run into a snag. The original\nallegations had come from witnesses, primarily Israeli witnesses, who had Maikovskis little --\nliterally in every location in Latvia, killing people. And the U.S. attorneys had gone over to\nLatvia to take depositions of former Soviet -- Soviet Latvian citizens who had been Maikovskis\u2019s\ncomrades, and who placed Maikovskis solely in one area of Latvia, in southeastern Latvia by\nRezekne. And the judge in the case was extremely hostile to the idea of deporting someone for\nNazi offenses. Not -- and th-th-there\u2019s no reason to believe that he was sympathetic to the Nazis,\nhe just didn\u2019t like the idea of throwing someone out of the United States on the basis of old\nevidence and evidence that had came in part from the Soviet Union. And the judges hostility\nmade it difficult for the attorneys to use the witness evidence, which, as it turned out, was a good\nthing for the Maikovskis case because the government eventually withdrew the charges against\nMaikovskis in the complaint, in -- in the order to show cause, Maikovskis was a alien, he wasn\u2019t\na citizen. The -- the charges that placed Maikovskis anywhere outside of Rezekne were\nwithdrawn, and the case then focused solely on what was going on in Rezekne. And with a\ncombination of documents in U.S. archives, which gave the general picture of what was going on\nin the Soviet -- in -- in -- in German occupied Latvia, in that region, and the statements, the\ndepositions, complete with cross examination of Soviet witnesses -- that is Soviet citizens who\nhad been comrades of Maikovskis, who described from their eyewitness point of view what had\nhappened, enabled us to secure Maikovskis\u2019s order of deportation. If I remember correctly, we\nlost -- the judge was hostile enough to rule against us, but we won on appeal, at the board of\nimmigration appeals. And Maikovskis eventually fled to West Germany before he was actually\ndeported.",
        "Q: Deported, I see. We -- do you know if he was ever tried in Germany? Or did he si --",
        "A: Th-The German -- the -- the Germans investigated Maikovskis, and here -- I\u2019m not sure, I\nthink they actually -- I\u2019m not sure if they indicted him, but he was placed under investigation,\nand the investigation was still ongoing when he died. He was an older man, I think he was born\nin 1909, if I remember correctly.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did you go to the hearing on the -- in this particular --",
        "A: The U.S. -- the U.S. hearing, yes --",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: -- I was present at the hearing, which was -- took place in -- in New York in -- I -- it was\neither the summer of \u201981 or the summer of \u201982.",
        "Q: W-When you first got involved in this, had -- di-did you know about the legal basis on which\nall of these cases were going to be tried, and --",
        "A: I knew nothing more because I -- I\u2019m -- I was not a great newspaper reader at the time, and I\nknew nothing more than what I had heard on the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program. I don\u2019t remember what I\nheard on the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program, but I suspect it probably wasn\u2019t too erudite about the legal\nramifications. I learned most of what I learned about the law on the job.",
        "Q: So te -- tell me what -- what the tri -- the trials, or the ability to -- I don\u2019t -- do one -- does one\ncall it an indictment, or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- bringing a case.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not a criminal procedure?",
        "A: I used the word indictment for the German case because it was a criminal proceeding --",
        "Q: Criminal pro -- right.",
        "A: -- in -- in Germany, but the proceedings in the United States are all civil cases, and there --\nthey\u2019re of two types. There\u2019s a denaturalization, if the individual is a U.S. citizen, there\u2019s a\ndenaturalization process, and -- and the equivalent of the indictment is called a complaint. The\ngovernment makes a complaint, and the government ts the plaintiff, and the defendant is the\nperson against whom the -- in this case the Nazi offender. If the individual is a -- just a\npermanent resident, is -- is an alien, then it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an order to show cause for deportation.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The complaint is filed in the U.S. District Court, because the U.S. District Court has the\nauthority to confer and revoke citizenship. And the -- the order to show cause is filed in\nimmigration court, because it becomes a immigration and naturaliz -- I-Immigration and\nNaturalization Service matter for non-citizens.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s why these are separate, be -- because the jurisdiction over this particular kind of\nprocess --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- is in one place, and the other is in the other place.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely. And -- and there -- a --a citizen has different rights than an alien, obviously.\nAnd there\u2019s a procedure -- 1-in terms of a citizen, we -- we, that is the OSI had to go through a\nprocess of denaturalization, and then the whole set of appeals and then deportation. After the\ndenaturalization, appeals had been exhausted. If a person had been denaturalized, and the appeals\nwere exhausted, and those appeals could go all the way up to the Supreme Court, then the\nprocess would start again, because the person was now an alien.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The process would start again in immigration court, and go through that series of appeals,\nwhich could again go up to the Supreme Court before someone was actually deported or\nremoved from the country.",
        "Q: The -- this particular process, to not have it be a criminal prosecution, is this because of\nsomething in international law, or was this a decision the United States government made, not to\nmake this a criminal proceeding, but rather to talk about willful misrepresentation, that someone\nmisrepresented who they were, and we wouldn\u2019t have let them into the country before. Why not\ntry these people for what they actually did?",
        "A: I think there were a lot of factors involved in that. One clearly was, unlike the -- the Great\nBritain, which decided to go the criminal route, the Australians and the brit -- and the Canadians\nalso decided, with total lack of success, to go the criminal proceedings route. The United States\nhad a Constitution of 200 years, and to create a criminal jurisdiction for trying these cases in the\nUnited States, under criminal procedures would -- was, as I understand it, possible, but would\nhave involved considerable difficulty, and considerable delay in setting up the apparatus. It also\nwould have held the government to an extremely strict standard, as it did in the cases of\nAustralia, Great Britain and Canada, of proving potentially, an individual case of murder. The --\non the other hand, the immigration procedures were in place, and had been in place, particularly\nsince many of the offenders had come in under the Displaced Persons Act, and the Refugee\nRelief Act of the -- the -- the legislation that was extant in the late 40\u2019s and early 50\u2019s. And there\nwas legislation on the books already that if these applicants for immigration, and later for\nnaturalization gave willful, false statements about their past, that they could be denaturalized,\nand ultimately deported. They would return to their pre-immigration status. That 1s, as an alien,\nwhich now the truth was known, was ineligible to enter the United States. And an ineligible alien\nface -- who is in the United States, faces deportation. U.S. immigration law, sometimes for many\nof the wrong reasons, is extremely harsh, and does not make many exceptions. And it was\nevidently decided -- this is not first-hand knowledge of -- of mine, it was evidently decided that\nthis would be an appropriate process to deal with the issue of Nazi offenders living in the United\nStates. It was hoped, I think initially, that for many of these individuals, that the nations where\nthey had committed their offenses, would request their extradition. And in fact, there was some\nprecedent for that. There was an outstanding request on the part of the former Yugoslav\ngovernment, for the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich, since the early\n50\u2019s. And in 1972, the West German government requested and obtained the extradition of a\nLong Island housewife named Hermine Braunsteiner-Ryan, who had been a camp guard at the\nLublin Majdanek concentration camp, and who had evaded justice afterwards, married an\nAmerican serviceman, and had come over to live in the United States, and who was sort of the\nepitome of the quiet neighbor that Allan Ryan tried to reflect in the title of his book in 1983.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s an -- I\u2019m -- yeah.",
        "A: So there\u2019s some precedent for the idea that the nations on whose soil these individuals had\ncommitted their crimes, would want these people back in order to try them. And of course, we\nfound -- we, that is the United States government, found very quickly that most of these nations,\nregardless of whether they made bellicose statements about dealing with Nazi offenders, were\nnot terribly excited about having them back, and this is something that we found out quite\nquickly in the Trifa case, where the Romanians really had no interest in having Valerian at the\ntime, Viarel Trifa back to Romania to try him for anything. The Soviet Union was often prepared\nto take people back in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, but the United States government was not prepared\nat that time to send individuals back to the Soviet Union.",
        "Q: So this had to be somewhat frustrating, because th-the results are -- could be seen as kind of\nminimal. People could escape to other countries if they were not extradited back to the original\ncountry to be tried.",
        "A: Yeah, the opportunity to escape was quite available to anyone, particularly to citizens. There\nwas no authority to the uni -- for the United States government to imprison a citizen of the\nUnited States during a denaturalization proceeding. The immigration and naturalization service\ncan imprison an individual who is about to be ordered deported, and of whom it can be surmised\nthat he will se -- seek to flee to avoid deportation. The INS can put someone in the slammer for\nthat. But the United States government did not have the authority to imprison an individual who\nfaced denaturalization proceedings.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so those individuals could leave, in fact, with their citizenship, and the worst they faced\nwas a in absentia denaturalization proceeding.",
        "Q: So you wa -- you might continue --",
        "A: We would continue the proceedings --",
        "Q: -- the com -- the -- cedure -- procedure, uh-huh.",
        "A: -- to denaturalize, regardless of whether the individual was in the United States, because it\nwas our intention that in the cases of those who fled, they were ineligible to enter the United\nStates, and denaturalization would render them, now under the Holzman amendment, ineligible\nto ever return --",
        "Q: To return.",
        "A: -- to the United States.",
        "Q: Just a -- just as a technical point, if you would do a case like that, would there be a defense\nattorney there, or you would simply do your case before the judge with --",
        "A: Often there was a defense attorney, yes.",
        "Q: -- and -- uh-huh.",
        "A: Often there was a di -- an attorney representing the interests of the defendant, who sometimes\nstill had property in the United States.",
        "Q: I see, I see. Can you talk a -- a bit about how you understand the -- the law, starting with the\nDisplaced Persons Act, and until you get to actually -- well, when 1s it, the Holzman amendment\nis in 1980 passing --",
        "A: Holzman amendment is passed, if I\u2019m correct -- if I\u2019m correct, it was passed in -- by Congress\nin 1978, and ratified in 1980. So it became effective in 1980. It really goes back to United States\nimmigration policy at the end of World War II. The United States clearly saw that it had been\nremiss -- the United States government at the time, and -- and -- and this was backed by popular\nsupport, that it had been remiss in granting sanctuary to refugees prior to World War II, and there\nwas a concerted effort to provide special immigration legislation for refugees after World War II,\nthat would exceed the narrowly restricted quotas which developed out of the 1924 Immigration\nand Naturalization Act. And the first of these special -- first of two -- actually three special laws,\nwas the Displaced Persons Act, which was passed in 1948, and took effect from 1948 until the\nlast day of 1952. And it created a separate category, over and above the quotas, of displaced\npersons who were eligible beyond the quotas to receive visas to immigrate to the United States.\nAnd if memory serves me correct, some 400,000 people -- I think just under 400,000 people\nimmigrated to the United States under the Displaced Persons Act from various countries in\nEurope. There were -- the Displaced Persons Act also provided for the establishment of a DP\ncommission, which operated in Europe and administered displaced person\u2019s camps to provide\nsanctuary for survivors of the Holocaust, refugees from Communist takeovers in eastern Europe,\nand displaced persons uprooted by the Nazis during their occupation of eastern Europe who\ncould -- could not, or would not be repatriated, to give them a place where they could find shelter\nand food, and in the case of kids, find some education and training, while they awaited the\ncompletion of the application process for a visa. When the Displaced Persons Act expired, the\nU.S. Congress, and again, backed by considerable public support, and this was -- keep in mind\nthis was the time of the McCarthy era, despite the concerns with Communism, a refugee relief\nact was passed, which permitted further refugees, some of those who were ineligible under the\nDisplaced Persons Act, to come to the United States on special visas that went over and beyond\nthe numbers and the quotas. And these visas, the last big blup of visas, came in December 1956,\nand spilled over to January 1957 to accommodate the refugees from Hungary, from the\nHungarian revolution of 1956. Now each of these decrees, each of these laws, as well as a 1945\nregulation, if I remember correctly, there were increasingly less strict restrictions on eligibility to\nthose who were either German, or received some benefit from the Nazi regime, or had\ncollaborated with the Nazi regime. There was a regulation -- a -- a State Department regulation\nalready in 1945, barring Nazi collaborators from coming into the United States. The Displaced\nPersons Act had fairly stringent restrictions on Nazi collaborators, those who assisted in\npersecution on the basis of race, religion and national origin, from entering the United States.\nThe Refugee Relief Act also had similar, except somewhat vaguer language, but still had\nlanguage that excluded persons who personally participated in persecution from entering the\nUnited States. Now, initially, as an example of how the legislation was relaxed in this aspect 1s\nthe following; under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, SS membership rendered one ineligible\nfrom entering the United States, regardless of what you had done in the SS -- what -- what an\nindividual had done as a member of the SS. Membership in the SS alone, was enough to exclude\nfrom the United States. In -- under the amendment of 1950, which mems -- mere membership in\nthe SS was no longer sufficient to exclude. One had to, as a member of the SS, have participated\nin persecution. The amendment in 1950 also allowed for nationals of, for instance, the Baltic\nStates to enter as displaced persons, even if they had served in collaborative units, like the\nLatvian legion of the Waffen SS. Latvians could come before, through the Displaced Persons\nAct, but they can -- could not have been affiliated with Nazi organizations. Under the DP Act as\namended, they were now no longer ineligible.",
        "Q: And why --",
        "A: But their membership -- they did -- they were required to tell the truth --",
        "Q: About the membership.",
        "A: -- about the membership, so as not to cut off an avenue of inquiry about their activities. So in\nother words it -- it remained against the law for a Latvian who had been a member of the Waffen\nSS to say that he was a bookkeeper during the war, when in fact he\u2019d been a member of the\nWaffen SS, even if it had -- it w -- would later have been found that he had done nothing more\nthan been a combat soldier. If he had admitted under the DP Act as amended that he was a\nWaffen SS combat soldier, and nothing more could be found against him, then he was eligible to\nenter the United States. But having concealed that information, that was already concealing,\nomitting, giving false statement, to obtain a federal benefit, which --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- brought a whole other exclusionary process to bear.",
        "Q: So, before we get to the -- the -- the next amendment, why do you think they made this\nchange?",
        "A: I-I\u2019m sure there were many factors involved. The one that comes to mind is that there was a --\na shortage of agricultural labor in the United States, and a lot of the east European refugees from\nCommunism were farmers, and farmer\u2019s sons. And the -- and al -- and many of them were also\nethnic Germans from eastern Europe. And I have no doubt that the idea of providing sanctuary to\nindividuals who were escaping Communist regimes was a significant factor in amending the\nDisplaced Persons Act. There was also a feeling even at the time that for those who served in\ncombat units that were affiliated with Nazi Germany, that particularly for Ukrainians, for\nmembers of the Baltic states, whose annexation by the Soviet Union the United States never\nrecognized, that these people had had very bad choices, and that the one that they chose was only\nmarginally less worse than the -- the other that was available to them. And so I think 1 -- th -- a\ncombination of factors led to the amendment of the Displaced Persons Act, and also led to the --\nthe slight differences in the Refugee Relief Act.",
        "Q: And so then what is the next change that happens? Is it --",
        "A: After -- after the Refugee Relief Act expired, at the end of -- in 1952, and a new Immigration\nand Naturalization Act had been passed, which was slightly less restrictive, and here I\u2019m -- here\nI\u2019m speaking off the top of my head -- slightly less restrictive than the \u201824 act, but it was a quota\nact again. And that came back into force, and remained in force until 1986 or \u201996, the new\nimmigration act -- the new immigration act, I think it was 1996, replaced the \u201952 act. Under these\nacts, all of these acts, the \u00b052 act in particular, but also the other special immigration legislation,\nthat an individual who was ordered deported, could apply for what was called discretionary\nrelief, for a number of reasons, whether they\u2019ve been a good citizen, and they were -- when they\n-- while they lived in the United States, if their wi -- were married to U.S. citizens, if they had\nchildren who were U.S. citizens, if they had close relatives who were dependent on them who\nwere U.S. citizens. And another very important and applicable one in these cases, if by\ndeportation to the country from whence they came, they would be subjected to political\npersecution. And this was a particularly applicable part of the statute for the Communist regimes,\nand was applied in the case of the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich who\ncame in the -- into the United States under a false name, was clearly involved in persecution. He\ncame even before the DP act, he came under the 1924 act, I believe. And he was actually ordered\ndeported in 1953 at the conclusion of a proceeding, but the order of deportation was stayed\nbecause he was successfully able to argue that he would be persecuted in a Communist\nYugoslavia, and would not get a fair trial. And this very much stems from the -- the -- the Cold\nWar atmosphere of the time, and this was an atmosphere that continued affecting the few cases\nthat actually were prosecuted, or were litigated during the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s, until the Vietnam era.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And what was the change with the Holzman Amendment?",
        "A: The Holzman Amendment, which was passed in 1978 radically changed this in that for\npersons who participated in persecution on the basis of race, religion, national origin and\npolitical opinion, they added political opinion under Holzman, under the aegis of Nazi Germany\nor its allies, or in territories occupied by Nazi Germany between January 30\", 1933, and May\neighth, 1945, if found to be deportable, if found to be ineligible to enter the United States, could\nnot apply for discretionary relief on any basis. And so this there -- this therefore opened the door\nfor an actual result to these cases, you didn\u2019t have to go through the litigation only to find that\nthe individual could apply for and get discretionary relief, either because his children were U.S.\ncitizens, or because he could claim political persecution from a Communist country. Now, did it\nmean that we were -- we, the U.S. government were willing to deport these people just to any\ncountry, as a practice? Not yet, but at least legally the possibility was there to obtain an order of\ndeportation and actually carry it out.",
        "Q: And the Cold War is still going on, so what allowed Holzman\u2019s amendment to actually be\npassed when people still had a very -- I don\u2019t know, shall we call it a rigid view, or at least a\nCold War view of eastern European countries under the Soviet Union?",
        "A: Again, I think it was a combination of factors. Clearly important was the precedent of the\nBraunsteiner-Ryan case in 1972, which sparked questions about how many other Nazi criminals\nwere living in our midst, so to speak. And that created a certain degree of public pressure, in part\nfrom Jewish groups, and survivor groups, which unlike 1945 - 1950, where they were\nimmigrants with no -- no confidence to say what they wanted, and no strong desire to relive the\nimmediate past as opposed to dealing with creating a new life and a future, were now established\nU.S. citizens, quite conscious and aware of their rights to lobby congressmen, to get some results\non this. A second key factor was the development of a -- the process of d\u00e9tente between the\nUnited States and the Soviet Union. The year that Braunsteiner-Ryan was extradited, 1972, was\nalso the year that President Nixon visited Moscow and ushered in the era of d\u00e9tente, which lasted\nmore or less until the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. This was also a time at which we in the\nUnited States, and to a greater degree, prosecutors in West Germany were beginning to see\nglimpses of the types of usable evidence, credible evidence that existed behind the iron curtain.\nIn the 50\u2019s this stuff just was not available in any way. In the 60\u2019s, particularly in the early 60\u2019s,\ntrickles of documentary material captured by the Red army, came into the public domain through\nwest German trials, and also through Soviet propaganda pamphlets in the late 60\u2019s and early\n70\u2019s, denouncing the western powers for harboring Nazi criminals. Now the pamphlets were --\nwere -- were nonsense, and -- and often many of the statements in the pamphlets were nonsense,\nas well as the interpretations. But the documents that were photocopied, if genuine, and one\ncouldn\u2019t tell if they were genuine unless they subjected -- subjected them to careful forensic\ntesting, were not only interesting in themselves, but fascinating as examples of the type of\nmaterial that had survived the war, and that was in Soviet hands. One of the key driving forces\nbehind the office of special investigation\u2019s success, was an early agreement 1n 1980 with the\nSoviet Union to take videotaped depositions from Soviet citizens, all of whom were comrades of\nthe defendants in the United States, and of whom, while it might be questioned what kinds of\npressures they were in the Soviet Union, it couldn\u2019t be questioned that they knew the defendants\ninvolved, whereas with the survivor witnesses, defense attorneys could raise questions as to how\nthey could possibly know that this was the man who did this, that and the other thing. The\ncomrades who worked with them on a daily basis, and who may have known them from their\nhometowns couldn\u2019t be questioned. They -- their knowledge of the defendants as members of\nthese units was much more credible, even if it was coming from behind the Iron Curtain. We also\nwere unable at that time to get unrestricted access to Soviet records, but we were able to get\naccess to copies of documentation, at least pertaining to our defendants at that time, and in\nresponse to the general objection of the defense that these documents were always forged by the\nSoviet Union, the Soviet authorities quickly understood that in order for the United States\ngovernment to be credible, that they would have to fork over the originals. And this started\nalready in 1980 - 1981, where the Soviet authorities would have the original document sent to\nthe Soviet embassy or Soviet consulate, depending on where the trial was taking place, in the\nUnited States, where the document could then be examined by the government\u2019s forensics\nexaminers for handwriting, for paper, for typing quality, for signatures. And also by teams hired\nby the defense. And at no time did the Soviets ever represent to OSI that a document was\ngenuine when it was not genuine.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Never. Never. In some of their pamphlet literature, they would leave things out, but when we\n-- when we in the United States government asked where\u2019s the beef, the Soviet Union always\nprovided the beef.",
        "Q: So from all of these laws and amendments, the essential question, if I have it correctly, when\nyou make a complaint, is was there willful misrepresentation of a person\u2019s past in connection\nwith the Nazi regime, 1s that --",
        "A: A basic --",
        "Q: Is that --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- in general.",
        "A: That\u2019s a little too general. It\u2019s not simply willful misrepresentation. It 1 -- it\u2019s actually material\nmisrepresentation, and the materiality must go to the fact that had the information been known, it\nwould or might have led to an investigation that would or might have uncovered facts that would\nhave re -- rendered the defendant ineligible. So in other words, there had to be some basis that\nwould render the individual ineligible beyond the simple fact of lying.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Beyond the simple fact of --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t lying about anything, it had to be lying about that which was materially relevant.",
        "A: Yes. And in the Nazi offender cases, that involved participation and persecution on the basis\nof race, religion, national origin or political opinion. Now that -- that -- that\u2019s how the\nimmigration statute read, and that -- the natu -- the natural -- denaturalization complaints were\nworded somewhat differently, you had to prove that a person was of bad moral character because\nthey materially misrepresented, because they illegally procured a visa, having materially\nmisrepresented, and that misrepresentation was material because it concealed information or data\nthat might have led to uncovering this person\u2019s participation and persecution. So it was a\nparticipation and persecution that was the --",
        "Q: That was central.",
        "A: -- vital issue.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s not --",
        "A: You never --",
        "Q: -- not membership?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So if one is -- was a member of the Nazi party, that\u2019s not sufficient. If -- if they --",
        "A: If it\u2019s something -- if it was something as general and as amorphous as the Nazi party, or even\nthe SS, or even a given military unit, yes. But there were some units whose raison d\u2019etre was\ninvolved in persecuting people in the basis of race, religion, national origin and political opinion.\nA -- a-- a example that the Supreme Court examined in the Federenko case was that of a\nconcentration camp guard. And the Supreme Court ruled that by the very daily duties of a\nconcentration camp guard, even if he did nothing personally against a prisoner; never shot a\nprisoner, never beat a prisoner, never so much as looked at a prisoner, by standing there on the\nperimeter of the camp with a rifle in his hand, he is acting as a deterrent fra -- for the prisoners\nfrom escaping, and that this was participation in persecution. So there were certain units that if\nyou could prove, if we the U.S. government could prove that the individual was a member of that\nunit, and carried out the normal daily routine of that unit, we would -- that -- that person could be\nproven, if we could prove those facts, a judge could make a finding that that person participated\nin persecution. Or that that person was a -- a person of bad moral character because he\nparticipated in persecution.",
        "Q: Right. So different from a criminal trial. Had -- had the United States government gone to do\ncriminal trials, you would have had to prove the actual event of the person doing something,\nwhereas within the context of the naturalization trial, 1f you could prove the connection with a\ntype of action that was common, even if you couldn\u2019t prove this person did it, but if they were\nconcentration camp guards, they were part of the Waffen SS, if they were --",
        "A: It -- if it was understood that by carrying out his daily duties --",
        "Q: He could be.",
        "A: -- he was doing it.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: That -- no, he was doing it.",
        "Q: He was doing it.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t that he could do it. A concentration camp guard, by standing there with a rifle, is\nassisting-- it -- it\u2019s participation, assistance, advocation and acquiescence. Now I -- I don\u2019t think\nwe ever were able to deport anyone or denaturalize anyone because he --",
        "Q: Advocated.",
        "A: -- or she acquiesced.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Advocation, no, advocation, the Trifa case was based a lot on advocation of persecution. But\nacquiescence alone usually didn\u2019t cut it as a matter of discretion on whether to file a case. But in\nterms of participation and assistance, a gar -- a cordon guard at a mass killing, or a camp guard,\nis certainly helping the leadership of that tex -- mass killing, or the leadership of that camp to\npersecute people, and that was assistance in persecution. Now had the United States gone the\ncriminal route, it\u2019s hard to know what would have happened, and it\u2019s a route not taken, but the\nstandard of evidence would have been beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas the standard of\nevidence in the civil cases was clear and convincing. Judges often held the United States\ngovernment fairly close to a beyond a reasonable doubt, but we could make this culpability as a\nreflection of membership, or membership being culpability, membership in an organization that\ndid as its daily business the persecution of individuals on the basis of race, religion, national\norigin and political opinion. That we could do. It\u2019s conceivable that in a criminal case, with the\nway we have conspiracy -- you know, prosecutions against conspiracy where the -- where the\ndriver of the escape vehicle is as much guilty as the individual who fires the gun of the murder\nthat\u2019s committed in the bank, it\u2019s conceivable we might have gone that way, but the standards\nwould have been higher, and it may well have been very difficult to obtain convictions.",
        "Q: Right. We\u2019re going to have to take a break for --",
        "A: Shortly.",
        "Q: -- tape.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Peter, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s start with part of what we ended up with from the last tape and talk about\nwhat does it mean to talk about acquiescence within the context of a complaint, wa --",
        "A: Well, the sta -- the Holzman Statute refers to four patterns of activity related to persecution;\nassistance, participation, or maybe participation is a better one to start with, assistance,\nadvocation, and acquiescence. Acquiescence as I understood while I was working with OSI, and\nas I think my colleagues on the legal side of it understood it, was basically standing by without\nany specific official or unofficial relation to the events, and letting it happen. And to my\nknowledge we never -- we never filed a case based on acquiescence alone. It was always at least\nsome active participation, assistance or advocation that met the standard for us to make a\ndecision to file a complaint or an order to show cause.",
        "Q: So somebody who was standing by, wasn\u2019t connected with a -- a unit of some kind, but was\nwatching, common folks.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That would not be considered --",
        "A: No, no, we would not have, to best of my knowledge we wouldn\u2019t -- and I certainly would\nhave advised against -- as a historian I would have ad-advised against on the basis of the\nevidence, filing a case against, for instance, a bystander who watched an execution. Now, a\nbystander who took a rifle and -- and started shooting, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a little bit different, that\nbecomes participation or assistance. There might be other problems with the proof in that case,\nbecause if 1t was just a by -- 1 -- if we\u2019re just dealing with a bystander, his connection to an\nofficial organization would be difficult if not impossible to prove. But in terms of just standing\nand watching an act of persecution take place, this was not sufficient by itself.",
        "Q: And advocation does not mean simply intellectual advocation. Th-There seems to be some\nimplication of some kind of act, not simply believing that this -- whatever I\u2019m watching should\nbe done, right? I mean, it\u2019s --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- not an ideolo -- it\u2019s not an ideological advocation.",
        "A: As we looked at it, 1-in the United States we -- we tend to have a tradition of not holding\npeople criminally or civilly responsible for the things that they believe in, no matter how bad\nthey are. But advocation in this sense we looked at very much in -- in a way that would be\nsimilar to a -- a -- potentially a criminal case, in that the person was advocating in a public\nforum, where the statements that the person was making, whether it was a speech, or in the print\nmedia, or over the radio, would be calculated to incite racial hatred, and from which actual\nevents took place that involved killing, or persec -- other persecution of individuals on the basis\nof race, religion, national origin or political opinion. And we did have cases against several\npropagandists. Viarel Trifa was perhaps the best known in the early years, but there were others,\nVerence Korair, wa -- who, as a Hungarian newspaper editor in Transylvania, and Vladamir\nSokolof wrote for a Russian paper in central Russia that was published by the Wehrmacht for the\nlocal population.",

And when I came down to Washington in 1980 to\nbegin full time work, we were all of a sudden a staff of over 40, each -- almost each of us with\nhis or her own office, although I shared an office with two others, which reflected the status of\nthe historians in that early period. And we -- we had roughly, if I remember correctly, around 20\nattorneys, around 10 or 15 investigators and then the remaining 10 or 15 were a combination of\nhistorians, paralegals and other support staff. And at the time, Rockler, Walter Rockler, who was\nthe first director of the OSI, gathered together a number of attorneys, private -- from private\npractice or other government agencies, and a number of investigators, almost all from other\nfederal agencies ranging from the custom service to state department security to the INS for that\nmatter.

        "A: Specifically.",
        "Q: Specifically, right. But how -- were the historians sort of the low people on the totem pole in\nthis group?",
        "A: I-In terms of the professional staff support staff at this point we were, in fact, the low persons\non the totem pole. Generally the United States government when it -- when it prosecutes, it has\ninvestigators develop cases, and then attorneys prosecute them. And in many ways the attorneys\nand the investigators, most of whom were very, very good, came with those ideas in mind of how\nthings should run. And I remember being interviewed -- the historians were originally under the\ninvestigative wing, and I was interviewed by the chief of investigations in the new unit, when I\nwas applying to come down as a full time worker, to move to Washington. And his question to\nme -- or, it was more of a statement than a question, well you\u2019re not going to be able to write any\nbooks down here. And the idea, the implication was that what a historian did was go to a library\nand read books. And unfortunately he was even wrong on that particular thing because see that\ntome -- I wrote that Trifa tome --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- within a year after he made that statement. But what happened was, as we got the cases, we\nbegan to investigate them as a historian would investigate them. And in order to -- they were like\nlittle biographies, and I ha -- of course, had written a biography for my dissertation, and it was a\nbiography of an individual, the chief of the Nazi security police SD, Ernst Karltenbrunner, who\nhad left very little of himself behind. And I had to go at his biography by dealing with the\norganizations to which he belonged, and by dealing with the individuals with whom he\nassociated. And in many ways, OSI, on a much lower level, dealt with that type of investigative\nprocess. And so what the historians started to do, and now again my colleague, my former\ncolleague David Marlowe and I talked about this quite a bit when we were both at OSI as young\nhistorians, what we started to do was to gather documentation, primary source documentation.\nWe understood, as historians what kinds of documentation bore what weight of reliability. We\u2019d\ngather documentation on the institutions that were relevant to the charges in the complaint. We\u2019d\ngather information on the individual, but we\u2019d also gather information on the comrades of the\nindividuals. And this served two purposes. On the one hand we wanted to talk to those comrades\nif they were still alive, because they could tell us things that the victims of the defendant\ncouldn\u2019t, and they could also tell us about the daily routine, which th -- which information the\ndefendant was not going to give us. We couldn\u2019t get it from any other source other than the hints\nthat were left in the documentation. And for a second reason is that the personnel material, and\nthe administrative material of the organization that these people belonged to, whether it was a\nconcentration camp, or a security police unit, or an auxiliary police unit, gave us a fairly\naccurate, and fairly reliable picture of what the daily life of this defendant was, so that an expert\nwitness could get up in front of a judge and say with complete conviction that on a daily basis,\non a normal day, so and so rotated into these particular guard assignments, and this was part of\nhis daily duty. Now, maybe he didn\u2019t do it on this day or that day, but if you take a period of\ntime, whether it was a week or three months, he was doing it in this order at least some time, and\nthat this was part of the daily routine, the standard operating procedure of this particular unit in\nthis ti -- particular place. And so in gathering this type of documentation, we were able to put\ntogether cases that were based on paper.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And were not subject to the inaccuries -- inaccuracies and shifts of personal memory. The\nattorneys and the investigators were often used to working primarily with live bodies, with\nwitnesses, whether it was an expert witness, an expert historical witness, and expert forensic\ntechnician, a survivor witness, even a -- a perpetrator witness. But a live body who could say\nwhat happened, meaning more than the paper documentation. And because of some of the\nproblems with the early witness statements, particularly survivor statements, we came to rely on\nin part, I think, because the -- of the historians work, more solidly on the documentation and the\nwitnesses, particularly the survivor witnesses became much more important to show to the judge\nwhat it was the victims underwent as a result of the defendants participation, assistance or\nadvocation in persecution. And it changed remo -- this was something that historians and\nattorneys in particular, and invest -- investigators to a certain degree, sort of worked towards\nwithout consciously saying this is how we\u2019re going to change it, this was just -- it just became a -\n-a--] won\u2019t say instinctual dynamic, but a professional dynamic in that the historians wanted to\nknow everything they could about the way a place operated, and how the people operated within\na place. And the attorneys and the investigators wanted to win cases. And the combination of\nthose two elements produced cases that we could put on that were based primarily on paper, that\nwent through an expert historical witness. But the witness\u2019s testimony alone was usually not\nenough. We tried as much as possible to have the elements of the expert witness testimony\nbacked at every point by a specific piece of paper that the judge could read and say yes, I can see\nwhy he comes to that opinion. So that the judge, if the judge chose, could go back and pick apart\nthe component parts of the expert\u2019s testimony. And that was the idea that we developed. And by\nwe, I say both historians and attorneys working together, that we developed, in terms of putting\ntogether a case that we felt would be as airtight as possible.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want to keep saying that we\u2019re going to go back, but in a way I\u2019m going back. Ho-\nHow in heaven\u2019s name do cases come? Wi -- did it change over the years, or what --",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. Yet -- 1-in the early days, in -- in some of the more famous cases that\ncame about in this way, it could come either from rumors from the old country, like Trifa was --\ncharges surfaced against Trifa both from the ra -- Communist Romanian regime, but also from\nRomanian \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the moment he stepped off the boat as a displaced person in 1950.\nAndrea Artukovich was uncovered by, I believe, I -- I can\u2019t remember, but I think he was\nactually seen and denounced by someone. There were people who would pick up on rumors. The\nSoviets would float pamphlet literature in the United States denouncing this person or that\nperson. Maikovskis was denounced in the early 60\u2019s, after having been tried and sentenced to\ndeath in absentia, in a typical Soviet style trial in the early 1960\u2019s. And the response of the early\nauthorities in the seven -- in the early 70\u2019s was to follow these leads and be reactive to what was\ncoming in from the outside. When the OSI hired full-time historians to work on the cases that\nwere floating around, and the OSI inherited 300 -- approximately 350 from the INS, many of\nwhich had been kicking around since the 50\u2019s and the 60\u2019s uninvestigated, particularly after the\nArtukovich fiasco in the mid-50\u2019s. The historians, in their search for documentation relating to\nthe place or places where the defendants served, and relating to the units in which the defendants\nserved, came across rosters of individuals, many of them with birthdates and birthplaces. And\nearly on, beginning even in 1980, the investigators were running lists -- post-war lists developed\nby American authorities of war crime suspects through the Immigration and Naturalization\nService to see whether matches had taken place, or whether there were hits, we called them hits.\nThat the indi -- an individual of the same name, and same birth year at least, and it\u2019s o-often the\nsame birthdate, of this war crime suspect had actually entered the United States on such and such\na date. Once we started collecting rosters, this became a -- a -- a fairly large operation, and we\nwere the first and only unit outside of the federal republic of Germany, and the Soviet Union to\ninvestigate in this way. And so we began, I would say, certainly by 1982 - 1983, 95 percent if not\nbetter of our cases originated in this way. The historians would gather rosters in the course of one\na -- investigation, in order to identify other members of that unit, 1n part as potential sources for\nwitnesses, and in part as potential evidence for that particular investigation. And then would run\nthose names through the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to determine whether these\npeople came to the United States. And if we could determine whether they came to the United\nStates then th-they either became witnesses themselves that we wanted to talk to about their\ncomrades, or they became -- and in most cases they did become subjects.",
        "Q: It would seem sort of, I don\u2019t know, nor -- natural to me that these people would have\nchanged their names. They would have come in with no identification, say, the war, I don\u2019t have\nany identification, this is my name, and then you\u2019d never find them.",
        "A: You would think that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You would think that, and it -- 1t certainly happened in the case of Artukovich, he did change\nhis name, and he did get in under a false name. However, most of the people who came in were\nsmall fry. Most of them were certainly aware that there was some documentation about\nthemselves, had existed at one time. Some of them were under the impression that the Nazis\ndestroyed personnel documentation. Others understood that in the late 40\u2019s and the early 50\u2019s,\nthat where the documentation was, was in a place that at that time was inaccessible to --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: -- to western investigators. And at the time of the Displaced Persons Act and the Refugee\nRelief Act, those who applied would have to go through a background check to determine\nwhether they were eligible. And these background checks were conducted by the counter-\nintelligence corps of the United States army. And they would make a check to the usual sources\nof documentation that were available at the time. These included the Berlin document center, and\nthe German armed forces information agency, as well as regional German police agencies. Now,\nmost of these people, most of the OSI subjects, 90 percent if not better, were from eastern\nEurope and most of them were small fry, and most of them were either non-German, or were\nethnic Germans from the east. So if they were not at a certain level, or had not been members of\nthe SS or the Nazi party, the Berlin document center check would surface nothing, and the armed\nforces information check would surface, if anything, possibly and -- the name of an army unit or\na police unit, and nothing more. When the individual was called in, if all the inve -- all the vice\nconsul had, or the counter-intelligence corps investigator had was the number of a police unit,\nwell, the investigator was essentially at the mercy of what the applicant had to say about what\nthose duties were. I mean, you could be guarding buildings in a police unit, and under the\namended Displaced Persons Act, that would not render you ineligible. There was just no access\nto the type of documentation that became available only beginning with the west German trials\nin the 60\u2019s, and to the United States investigators after the period of d\u00e9tente in the early 70\u2019s.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know if you can comment on this, so obviously you\u2019ll say no if you can\u2019t. We\u2019ve\nknown, I don\u2019t know for how many years about Operation Paper Clip, and the ways in which\ncertain people were brought in by the government in order to help us, especially in science. And\ntheir past was whited out. Was it ever -- was there ever a time that you got -- as OSI got --\nsomebody slipped the information and that you were now in a position to know that we were\nprotecting a Nazi, and then what happened?",
        "A: With Operation Paper Clip, we actually did have one case involving an Operation Paper Clip\nsubject, Arthur Rudolf, whom we did end up -- he denaturalized himself essentially, by default.\nThe difference with Operation Paper Clip, and the problem with Operation Paper Clip for the --\nfor proc -- litigation in this context was that these individuals were brought specifically to the\nUnited States, not despite what they\u2019d done, but because of what they\u2019d done. And this, if you go\nback to the context of that time, the purpose of bringing them to the United States was number\none, to obtain whatever missile expertise they might have, and also to deprive the Soviet Union\nof that missile expertise. Which, whatever the morality of the situation 1s, looking back at it at\nthat time, it was not an unreasonable decision given the national security interests at the time.\nThis, obviously, did present a problem in the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s when we were looking into these\ninvestigations, because one could not say that the person gave false information. Another issue\nthat was problematic is that many of these people had, in the broader context, a rather marginal\nconnection with the persecution. The connection was generally at its worst responsibility for\nforced laborers, perhaps denouncing a forced laborer for -- for not working hard enough, as a\nresult of which that forced laborer would be sent to a concentration camp, or sent to a worse\nconcentration camp, or a worst case scenario, executed. This was clearly something that was not\na priority for U.S. officials in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s when they were trying people, they were trying\npeople who were shooting people. They were trying people who were direct, hands-on killers,\nand they had plenty of them. By the 1980\u2019s, because the big fry were either already tried, or die -\n- had died, there was a broader and more intensive public and legal concentration on different\ntypes of connections with Nazi crimes, and the connection with forced labor was clearly one of\nthose. The ro -- for the roc -- for the majority of the rocket scientists, their connection with the\nforced labor was in comparison to that of a concentration camp guard, or a police official,\nrelatively marginal. So the cases were that much tougher to prove, even without the problem of\nwhy the men were brought in.",
        "Q: Okay. So now you got a case. Now what happens? Is there a team and you sit around and you\nstrategize, Peter, you have to do this, we need this from you. Or do you just get the case and then\nyou all go off in your own separate directions? What happens?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- it -- 1t -- it\u2019s much more systematic than that. Cases are developed through the OSI\nresearch and development department. This is a department that grew out of the investigative\nwing of the unit in the mid-1980\u2019s, and it is responsible for the -- it -- 1-1t -- 1t functions among\nmany other things, as a transmission belt for these names that are dredged up by the historians,\nbased on the original documentation to and from the INS. If a hit occurs where a person of the\nsame name and same birthdate as someone who is a suspect of being a member of a unit\ninvolved in Nazi offenses, has also entered the United States, the research and development unit\nalso takes several other steps to determine whether the person is still in the United States,\nwhether the person is still alive, and whether the person is in good health. And also to make\ncertain that the individual who resides in the United States is identical with the individual whose\nname a-appears on the roster that -- that was originated in the Nazi era. Once all of those bases\nare covered, so to speak, then the research and development -- the chief of the research and\ndevelopment, I think her -- her name is Elizabeth White, we had Dr. Black and Dr. White, and\nshe then opens a case, gives it an OSI number and it becomes an investigation. The case is then\nassigned to an attorney and to a historian, and to a paralegal. And together the historian does the\ninvestigations, and OSI has some minimal investigative personnel to locate people, locate\nwitnesses, locate files from federal agencies. But the historian does the investigation, works at\nthe investigation to a point where the attorneys consider it ready for what we call a pre-filing\ninterview. Cause we assume that all defendants are innocent until proven guilty, and that there\ncould be some explanation for whatever it is we\u2019ve put together. We obviously, if we get to the\npoint where we want to talk to someone, we obviously feel that we have a -- a good -- we being\nthe U.S. government, feels that we have a good case, that we can litigate if necessary, but there\u2019s\nalways a possibility that there\u2019s a reasonable explanation for the documentation that we find in\nour hands. And so we usually attempt to interview the subject of the OSI investigation prior to\nfiling a case. And as citizens -- if they\u2019re citizens, the subject can refuse to speak to us. Doesn\u2019t\nhave to come. It\u2019s a civil case, the subject does not have to appear. If the subject is an alien, the\nsubject must appear, but he does not have to say anything to us, other than name, rank and serial\nnumber, if he wants. Based on that pre-filing interview, depending on what the unit gets, and\ndepending on what that means for the case, the direction of OSI makes a determination of\nwhether a case, a complaint, or an order to show cause should be filed. And then once that\ndetermination is made, the -- the documentation is drafted, and a case is filed in court.",
        "Q: Let me a -- let me ask you how the priorities are set. You\u2019ve got a -- you can have hundreds\nof rosters, maybe thousands of rosters, and maybe you can make hundreds of possible\nconnections. Who is the person who decides? Is there sort of a hierarchy of importance? Or is it\nsimply whatever comes up first, well this works, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s take it, I mean how --",
        "A: It -- no, this -- generally the hierarchy of importance revolves around the likelihood of an\nindividual belonging to a specific unit that is in its daily routine involved in persecution. So we\nwill go the u -- the United States government will push names for instance, of concentration\ncamp guards before they might push the names of a -- an obscure police unit in an area that\nwe\u2019re not sure that there was persecution, at least Holzman type persecution. We will push\nTrawniki train guards fairly quickly, though if we have Trawniki train guards who came in late\n1943 or early 1944, they might not have the same priority as a Trawniki train guard who was at\nBelzec.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Or at Sobibor. Then of course, we\u2019re gonna -- we\u2019re going to put a higher priority. The\npriority -- priorities that are assigned tend to reflect our experience in what constitutes a\nwinnable case.",
        "Q: But the -- the role of the historian here, because at least in the beginning, I\u2019m assuming that\nthe lawyers and the paralegals don\u2019t know much of this history, and that you historians are the\nones who can say look, this is really more important. Or am I -- or am I wrong? Did -- did they\ncome in with a lot of knowledge as well?",
        "A: They\u2019re -- OSI has several attorneys who\u2019ve been around for --",
        "Q: Now for a period -- right.",
        "A: -- a long time. So they have -- they have a good sense -- and -- and they\u2019ve prosecuted a lot of\ncases, and so they have a good sense of what constitutes a winnable case. And they can also\nimpart that good sense to the newer attorneys, who -- there\u2019s much more turnover among the\nattorneys than there is among the historians. But the process of opening cases 1s a process that\u2019s\nmore or less run by my former colleague, Elizabeth White. She is the one who makes a\ndetermination on whether a case should be opened or not. It does go through her superior, her\ndirect superior who 1s the director of the office, Eli Rosenbaum, and he -- he needs to approve,\nbut I don\u2019t know of any cases where he has rejected a recommendation from her that a case be\nfiled. She\u2019s --",
        "Q: Would -- would she go to you and -- and ask your advice on whether a case should be opened,\nor did she really --",
        "A: She\u2019s been around long enough -- she was a -- she was trained in German and European\nhistory and she\u2019s been with the office since 1983. And she\u2019s been running the R and D section\nsince the departure of David Marwell in 1988. So she\u2019s quite capable --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and knowledgeable in her own right to know what constitutes a -- a -- a unit, based on the\ndocumentation that exists, what constitutes a unit that -- who\u2019s an -- individuals are likely to\nparticipating in persecution.",
        "Q: So if we would take an example like the Trifa case which -- I think we ought talk about the\nnotion of advocacy here, and propaganda and -- as well. But how -- you wrote this huge tome, I\ndon\u2019t know, six or sev -- 800 pages, it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s very heavy, Peter.",
        "A: It is heavy.",
        "Q: At what -- do you write a short version of that in order to say to the lawyers and the\ninvestigators, look, here is a lot of information, we really should move ahead. So -- or did you do\nall of that before the actual complaint is filed? I mean, how --",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question, and -- and -- and actually the Trifa case is probably not a good\nexample --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, then pick another one.",
        "A: -- because it\u2019s an early case.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I -- I didn\u2019t -- I -- I feel I should explain why that tome is so big. It has to do with some of\nthe specifics of the Trifa case. Trifa was not a case which was developed by OSI. It was a case\nthat was developed through denunciation. And Trifa in his defense was able to make statements\nthat were half-truths, that required a significant amount of documentation to develop an\nunderstanding among the attorneys of what the actual truth was. Trifa, for example, was able to\nsay he was incarcerated in a concentration camp during the war. And what did that mean? He\nwas able to say that the Romanian Iron Guard was anti-German. What did that mean? He could\nsay that the Germans didn\u2019t trust the Iron Guard. What did that -- all of those things were -- were\ntruth, but they weren\u2019t the whole truth. And the whole truth was dependent on a rather acute\nanalysis of what the documentation was, what the conditions were like for the Iron Guards when\nthey were in German captivity. It was clear from the documentation. But it took 40 pages of that\nparticular part of the case to explain to the prosecuting attorneys, and also -- who would then\nexplain it to the judge, through the expert witness, of what exactly was the nature of the\npersecution of Trifa. The same is true for the Iron Guards anti-German behavior, or the Iron\nGuards rebellion against the Fascist Romanian military dictatorship which was backed by the\nGermans. And for Trifa\u2019s own particular role in persecution, which was -- had to be shifted from\nthe original emphasis on physical mistreatment of individuals, which came from witnesses, many\nof whom didn\u2019t, as it turned out, pan out, to a more -- persecution based more on advocation,\nparticularly within the student rubric, and student organizations of exclusion and discrimination\nagainst Jews and Gypsies and Greeks in Romania. And also towards a print advocation of -- with\nintent to instill hatred of these minority groups, and to help to create an atmosphere in which the\nauthorities could, with reasonable support from the general population, engage in physical\npersecution of these individuals. And if you\u2019ll notice in that particular tome at the end of each\nsection, there is a contrast between Trifa\u2019s statements, and what evidence exists, based on the\nhistorical context in the chapters, that would contradict what Trifa -- Trifa\u2019s version of events.\nAnd that was an unusual case.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: A -- amuch more normal type of reporting, and in fact it became institutionalized in the 90\u2019s\nwhen courts began demanding an expert witness report, which was essentially a historical\nbiography of the official duties of the defendant. And I -- I don\u2019t remember exactly which year\nwe -- the courts began to require these reports, but I think it was in the early 90\u2019s. A much better\nexample is the Schellong report, Conrad Schellong, who was a -- who was a concentration camp\nguard and security officer at Dachau in the years before the war, and I can tell you now that\nsomeone in OSI when I first at -- was assigned to the case was disappointed that he was only\nthere before the war, and even said something to the effect, well before the war they were just\nlike prisons, weren\u2019t they? And that signaled to me as a historian that even before we went\noutside to deal with judges and defense attorneys, we had to lay a context for what Dachau was,\nand a context to prove, in a sense, that the people who were in Dachau, despite Nazi euphemisms\nand misstatements about who they were and why they were there, were in that camp for reasons\nof race, religion, national origin and political opinion --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and were being persecuted for those reasons. And a key hooker to that was dealing with the\ninstrument, the legal police instrument of schutzhaft, or protective detention is the loose\ntranslation. And by dealing with the regulations of protective detention, which was imposed by\nthe Gestapo outside the concentration camp, and had little to do with the individual\u2019s sojourn\nwithin the camp, except to bring him or her in, or bring him or her out if he or she managed to\nsurvive. But the schutzhaft provided the proof that the people who were in that camp were in that\ncamp because of their race, because they were Jewish in 1938, because of their national origin,\nbecause of their religious convictions, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, or because of their political opinion;\nSocialists, Communists and -- and what have you. And that was quite clearly expressed in\nschutzhaft orders and in the discussion of what schutzhaft was and how schutzhaft was supposed\nto be applied in the documentation of the Gestapo, of the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and of\nthe concentration camp commandants themselves. And so we -- we as historians were\nresponsible for putting together a context of how the prisoners came into the concentration camp,\nby what pseudo-legal means they came into the concentration camp, of how the guards were\nrecruited, of what their duties were, and of how their daily duties involved keeping these people\nin a place where they were being persecuted on the basis of race, religion and so forth. And\nthrough that, if we could prove all of those facts, and we could prove that the defendant was a\nmember of this unit, then we could prove -- then -- then a judge could reach a finding that this\nindividual persecuted, or assisted -- participated in persecution. And the purpose in writing a\nreport, and people always used to joke about my long reports -- the purpose of writing the report\nwas not only to inform the attorneys, but also to solidify in the mind of the historian, what the\nframework of this inquiry was going to be, and so that the historian could be sure that all relevant\ndocumentation, some of it -- some of which was often obscure and by itself meaningless, how it\nfit in. And y -- we could use the report even though we didn\u2019t show the reports to the expert\nwitnesses until the courts began to require us to provide an expert witness report, we didn\u2019t show\n-- these were work product. But we would use the framework established by that report to work\nout the testimony of the expert witness, and then test it against the expert witnesses, cause after\nall, he was an independent individual, or she -- a-and I think most of our expert witnesses were\nmale.",

I -- certainly in 1978, when the legislation was drafted, the focus on sexual\npreference, and on persecution for sexual pref -- on the basis of sexual preference, was\nunfortunately not as consciously not this -- not of the same conscious concern to U.S. authorities\nor anyone else, frankly, as it is today. We -- there\u2019s also, if you notice in the legislation, there\u2019s\nno provision for the persecution of people who were engaged in what the Nazis called asocial\nbehavior.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we\u2019re certainly not going to be able to pass this legislation if we count locking up\npanhandlers, or flashers or what have you, whatever asocial behavior you choose to -- to focus\non, you\u2019re not going to be able to pass this legisla -- we want to pass this legis -- we want to pass\nthis legislation in very clear and convincing areas that we know at the time, in the context of the\n70\u2019s that there will be a consensus among Americans that this is wrong, that we don\u2019t want\npeople who engage in this activity, persecution of these people, for these reasons in our United\nStates. Do I know that for -- do I know that for -- whether that was really behind -- in the minds?\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s speculation.

        "Q: Peter, can we talk about the -- the -- the way in which evidence 1s gathered? For instance, in\nthe Trifa case, did all the -- the huge tome that you wrote, was that all information you got from\nthe archives in the United States, or were you able to get things from Romania?",
        "A: There was a combination. Actually, I was not the first assigned to the Trifa case, it had pre-\ndated OSI, and in fact pre-dated the SLU, the Special Litigation Unit in the INS, had actually\nbeen filed in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, I believe it was, in 1975. Some of the early\nresearch for the SLU, in records both in the national archives and in Romania, were done by\nnone other than Paul Shapiro, who worked as a contractor for the SLU for a short time in \u201978 -\n\u00b079. I\u2019m -- maybe \u201977 - \u201978. When I was hired and brought down to Washington, I had a look at\nthe existing evidence, and there was still a s -- a number of gaps that needed to be filled at that\npoint, primarily from material that was held at the United States National Archives, and\nprimarily from captured German records, SS records, and German foreign office records. And\nwhat I did was to gather the rest of that material and pull that material, together with the material\nthat had been gathered from Romania, and with some newer material that had been gathered\nfrom the Library of Congress, which had the monetoral officiale, which was the legal gazette of\nthe Antonescu regime in Romania. And -- cause we weren\u2019t at war with Romania during the\nperiod that the Iron Guard was in power in the autumn and winter of 1940 and 1941. And I\nintegrated the information from these various sources, into a narrative that was broken down into\nthe topics that were relevant to our -- the components of our complaint and the defenses that\nTrifa had made against the charges of the government.",
        "Q: So how is that huge document used by the lawyers? You -- you would write this, and then\nthey would take it over?",
        "A: In this particular case, the lawyers used it as a cheat sheet in a way, for developing a line that\n-- their line of questioning of the expert witness on direct examination. And they also used -- it\nwas written in such a way so that the attorneys could use that which they needed, to deal with\nrebuttal questions that came up on cross-examination, the -- the questions, if he says this to this,\nor if the pro -- if the defense attorney asks the expert to explain this, this 1s what -- this 1s a -- a\nreasonable response if the independent expert agrees. And sometimes the defense attorney would\nnot ask the question, and you wouldn\u2019t need to introduce the e -- there was no reason to\nintroduce the evidence on direct examination. Let me see if I can think of a good exa -- good\nexample. We could argue -- here\u2019s an example, I -- I don\u2019t remember if this exactly was in my\nmind at the time, or this be -- was an issue at the trial, but Trifa claimed that he was persecuted\nby the Nazis, that he was a concentration camp prisoner. Our direct examination involved his\nsojourn with the other Iron Guard leaders in the Birkenbrook SS house, where -- from where he\nhad a special vacation for his stomach ulcers, where he was at spas, and going to movies, and\nwriting home about -- home to his buddies at Birkenbrook about his stomach illnesses, and his\nmedicines, and what the weather was like, not -- not exactly the regular concentration camp\nprisoner\u2019s life.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: After Coriasima, the Iron Guard leader escaped from Birkenbrook, and was tracked down in\nRome and brought back. At the behest of the foreign ministry, the SS did put the -- the Iron\nGuard leaders in a concentration camp, I believe it was at Buchenwald, but I can\u2019t remember\nwhere -- which camp at the moment. I think Seymour went to Sachsenhausen and the rest of\nthem went to Buchenwald. But even here, and this was the issue that was brought up for rebuttal;\nif he says, oh I was in a concentration camp, and I was treated poorly, even here there is evidence\nthat the Iron Guard leaders were clearly prominent persons, kept in a separate compound, they\nhad a radio they could listen to, and they even had a -- a -- Jehovah\u2019s Witness as a -- as a-- a\nperson who would clean their -- their rooms, and what have you. Again, it was not the typical\nconcentration camp existence, and they were clearly not in there because of Nazi persecution of\ntheir politics, they were in there because the Nazis needed to keep tabs on them for foreign\npolicy reasons, and they also wanted to keep them in reserve in the event that the Antonescu\nregime ever tried to desert the axis, as it did in 1944. So it was that type of evidence that I felt,\nand other historians working on their cases felt that the attorneys ought to have, either for\nrebuttal purposes, or for their general background. And in some cases it was information that the\nexpert witness might not have, but might be able to evaluate in a useful way, to frame his or her\ntestimony.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Wh-When the law -- when the lawyers would get this information from you, like --\nlike with the big book, would you then have a conversa -- would they sit with you and say, I\ndon\u2019t quite understand what this means, or how I can use it, I mean, was it transparent to them,\nhow to use these things, or would there be conversations between you --",
        "A: This would be an ongoing --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- it would be an ongoing conversation that we would have, and it would often be a\nconversation that we would have in the context of selecking -- selecting specific documents, and\ngiving them priority as to how we ought to use them. As I remember it, in our cases, in the cases\nI worked on, there were four levels of priority. We selected documents that we were definitely\ngoing to introduce as evidence on direct examination, through the vehicle of the expert witness.\nAnd this involved a whole procedure of making sure that they were properly translated, making\nsure that they were properly certified as to the chain of custody, which was particularly for\nmaterials from the Soviet Union, and the eastern bloc, these were -- this could be a very, very\ncomplicated process. The second level required similar preparation because these were\ndocuments that were selected to be used if necessary to rebut possible defenses, or\ndocumentation submitted in support of possible defenses. So in other words, you had to have\nthese documents ready as if you wanted to move them into evidence, whether you moved them\ninto evidence or not. But a decision to move them into evidence would be made, perhaps very\nclose to trial, or maybe during the trial itself. The third level of priority were those documents\nthat we felt that the expert witness should see. That we would not use them as evidence, they\nwere not appropriate as evidence, either because they were not relevant, or because, for instance,\nthey involved a witness statement where the witness was no longer alive and couldn\u2019t be cross\nexamined, and it was not an old enough document to come in under an ancient documents\nexception to the hearsay rule. Or 1t was simply general background and general context that the\nexpert witness should either see for the first time, or refresh his memory and have it as part of the\ncontext of the case, but it was not necessary to introduce as evidence. It was something that the\nexpert could talk about without having to document it. An example of that might be -- an\nexample of that might be a report about a specific event that occurred in 1941, that was written in\n1944, either by the government that perpetrated the event, or that was presiding over the event,\nor by the successor government. Was something that the expert probably should be aware of, but\nit was not something that was appropriate to use as evidence. And then the fourth rung were\nthose documents that were either exonerating, or in some way that could potentially adversely\naffect the case, so that the expert witness would have an opportunity to know what they were,\nand to reconcile them with the theory of the case as developed through this cooperation between\nthe expert witness and the prosecution team.",
        "Q: Wa -- I want to ask you more about that, but can you explain the hearsay rule?",
        "A: Well a -- I\u2019m not a lawyer here --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- an -- and we moved documentation, historical documentation, not only contemporaneous\nGerman and other axis documentation, but even post-war interrogations under an -- an exception\nto the hearsay rule, which is called the ancient documents exception. And I believe to remember\nthat the -- the year -- I think there\u2019s a year limit, and there is a requirement that the document is\nnot created in the interests of the present proceeding. So in other words, it has to be old enough,\nfirst of all, so that there\u2019s no shadow of a doubt as to whether the document was created for this\nproceeding. And by the same token, it had to be totally d -- think of a good word -- totally de-\nlinked from the existing proceeding, cause technically even an order, written right prior to an\noperation, is a hearsay document. The document only says what it says, it\u2019s not proof that the\norder was carried out, it\u2019s not -- the signature isn\u2019t proof that the person who signed it actually\nsigned it, unless you test the handwriting, nor 1s it proof that the person who actually signed it\nread it, and intended that order to be -- to be implemented. But the expert witness could argue on\nthe basis of his experience, on the basis of his having seen many similar documents, that this was\na normal document of the type created by this type of agency in this type of situation. And that\u2019s\nhow this document came to be. And this went for post-war interrogation protocols as well, which\nwere na -- not even word for word testimony. They were summaries that were written by police\nor prosecutors of what the witness said, and then the witness later signed it, which is the normal\nway of procedure in -- in continental law. There\u2019s no word for word witness testimony in a pre-\ntrial interrogation. The witness talks, the prosecutor or police interrogator summarizes it, types it\nup, and the witness is -- 1s -- reads it and then either signs to 1t or makes whatever changes the\nwitness deems are a-appropriate and accurate.",
        "Q: So -- so this is why in the Hajda case, the early testimony of the sister and the father, in a\ntotally separate, de-linked case could be accepted as to what they said about the -- the brother\nand the son.",
        "A: It may -- it -- 1t made it appropriate to move that info -- those documents into evidence. It\ncame in under an exception to the hearsay rule. Now, as -- as far as the weight that\u2019s given to that\ndocumentation, in that case, both the prosecution, first -- when we first got the material, and the\njudge finally gave it what weight, as evidence he or she saw fit. And in this case, in -- in that\nparticular case, because of some certain specific -- specificity of language of the sister\u2019s -- of the\nsister\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s unit, we -- we ga -- we, the prosecution and the judge as\nwell, gave it considerable weight, because she used a term that she couldn\u2019t have known, or\nwouldn\u2019t have used. It was a foreign term, and it was a specific unit, and she got part of that term\nright. She just wouldn\u2019t have known it if he wasn\u2019t, in fact, in that unit.",

        "A: Hillberg is an expert witness.",
        "Q: A-Are their usual functions to add to this kind of general picture, more than focusing on the\nparticular person, placing that person\u2019s unit, or what that unit might have done in the larger\ncontext? Is that what the --",
        "A: The expert offers evidence on -- provided it\u2019s there --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the expert offers evidence -- excuse me -- on what the unit did, o-on the big picture, first of\nall, so we -- usually the -- the -- the way it\u2019s laid out is we deal with ideological issues, what the\nGerman aims were at the very top, what the specific conditions and administrative structures\nwere in the particular region involved, and then getting down to the particular organization or\norganizations in chronological sequence as much as possible. And then going down as far as the\ndocumentation permits the expert to make a judgment. For instance, if the expert sees a month\u2019s\nworth of guard rotation assignments at a concentration camp, that expert can talk about those\nrotations, because he\u2019s seen enough evidence to convince him of how -- or -- or to define for him\nwhat the daily routine was like. If there\u2019s no evidence, he can speak about -- if there\u2019s no\nevidence -- well, let me -- let me retract that. If there\u2019s -- if we don\u2019t have the daily rotations, but\nonly have evidence of the concentration camp within the system, then the expert, if he feels so\ncomfortable in doing so, can talk about how -- what the normal routine was within the\nconcentration camp system, and how in his expert opinion there\u2019s no reason to assume that for\nthis particular concentration camp, it went any way differently. He cannot -- or I wouldn\u2019t, as an\nexpert witness, try to get into the detail as to who was rotated where at what time, or even what\nthe specific places of rotation were. That you\u2019d have to do on the basis of the evidence. You\ncan\u2019t know that if you don\u2019t have the -- 1-1f -- 1f there\u2019s a gap in that documentation. And for\ninstance, to give you an example, in the Schellong case, we didn\u2019t have that documentation for\nDachau. We only knew that he was a security officer, and we knew that there were regular\nfunctions for security officers in concentration camps. And the expert testified as to that. We did\nhave rotation rosters for the guards at Sachsenburg, where Schellong was at before he went to\nDachau. And there the expert could talk very specifically that Conrad Schellong, on such and\nsuch a day, was outside the bunker. Or that he checked in on the bunker as security officer every\nthree or four hours, whatever the -- the case might have been. For instance in the Hajda case, we\ncould talk because we had, through a three tiered level of documentation, contemporaneous\ndocumentation of individuals who were in the Trawniki system, and who served at the Treblinka\nlabor camp, individuals who after the war testified in western countries, where there was --\nwhere you didn\u2019t have the baggage of what the Soviet system was like, that they had indeed been\nthere, and done this, that and the other thing, and then of course, the Soviet protocols, in so far as\nthe information contained therein was consistent with the original documentation, and the\ntestimony in the western protocols. And through a s -- a combination of those three types of\nsources, we were able to identify where virtually every single individual who served at the\nTreblinka labor camp between March 1943, and its dissolution in July 1944, where they were.\nWe were able even to determine what happened to the people who appeared on one roster and\nwere no longer on the other roster. One was sent back because he was a chronic drunk, and we\nhad documentation -- his own testimony in that case, that he became an alcoholic at Treblinka\none. A post-war testimony in a German proceeding, a west German proceeding. In another case,\nan individual deserted, and we found the -- the German wanted list, indicating that this indi --\nindividual had deserted and was being sought at a time between the dates of the two rosters. And\nso the expert was able to speak in significant detail about who was at Treblinka one, when, and\nwhat they were doing there; and in a way that was very convincing to the judge.",
        "Q: W-What is unique about the Trifa complaint in your -- in your view? Is it not common that\none is making a complaint against someone who 1s an advocate, but not necessarily who actually\ndid the persecution, but was so -- is that what\u2019s interesting about that case?",
        "A: I think Trifa\u2019s -- the interest for Trifa -- we had a couple of journalists. Trifa was primarily a\njournalist, he was also a student leader. He was unique among OSI subjects -- well not u-unique,\nbut rare among OSI subjects in that he was in the highest level of leadership. He was next to the -\n- he was in that group that was close to the -- the leader Horia Sima himself. But he was -- he\nwas unique in that much of what he said in his defense, in contrast to it being an outright lie, did\ncontain a grain of truth. And -- but was significant more for what he omitted to say, than what he\nactually admitted. In other words, Trifa was a concentration camp prisoner, or was ca -- I take\nthat back, I\u2019m going to withdraw that. He was, for a time, confined in a concentration camp. He\nwas in the custody of the Germans. He was a member of a movement that the Germans didn\u2019t\nfully trust, and that rebelled against the regime that the Germans supported. All of these issues --\nI can\u2019t think at the moment of another defendant that, given the hope of prosecutorial ignorance,\nhad a better defense in that he could rely on half-truths, rather than simply claiming to be in\nanother place other than he was, or claiming to have been a combat soldier when he really was a\nconcentration camp guard, or simply denying ever having served with the Germans, or 1n the\nHajda case, as you saw, rather unwisely claiming that the information, though accurate as to his\nperson, wasn\u2019t him, that somebody else was using his birth data, for reasons that no one could\never explain.",

        "A: Trifa, Trifa.",
        "Q: And he actually came to trial?",
        "A: Trifa came to trial twice -- I take that back, I withdraw that. He came to -- he was supposed to\ncome to trial twice, both times -- once before the trial at denat stage, and once during the trial at\nthe deport stage, he threw in the towel.",
        "Q: At both times?",
        "A: At both times. Shortly before denaturalization, Trifa voluntarily turned in his certificate, and\nrenounced his citizenship. Didn\u2019t stop him from appealing the decision afterwards. His attorney,\na-- am--aman by the name of Woods, I think, I can\u2019t recall his first name, at that time wrote a\ngigantic tome in defense of Trifa, and criticizing Trifa for withdrawing, and bitterly attacking the\ngovernment for persecuting Trifa, which was another issue that we -- we had to deal with in\nputting together the deportation case, because we had every reason to believe that once Trifa\nappealed the denaturalization decision, which came as a result of his voluntary act of throwing in\nthe towel, we had every reason to believe that he would fight at deportation. And he did take it to\ntrial at deportation, and I\u2019m still convinced -- I was at the trial, I\u2019m still convinced that due to the\ntremendous talent of the lead attorney on the case, Kathleen Coleman, who still works for the\nJustice Department, and the way she was orchestrating -- well, I co -- wouldn\u2019t say orchestrating,\nthe way she was permitting the expert witness, Bayla Vargo, to explain the context of what this\ndocumentation relating to Trifa really meant, that of everyone in the courtroom, Trifa probably\nknew best where the testimony was going.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And after two days of it -- the expert was on the stand for two days, Trifa\u2019s lawyers\napproached Allen Ryan who was at the trial and again ultimately offered to throw in the towel\nand agreed to an order of deportation.",
        "Q: And why would somebody do that? To not pay money to his lawyer, or to --",
        "A: Th -- [ha -- I don\u2019t know exactly, but this -- this is only speculation on my part that Trifa --\nTrifa, perhaps even better than the judge, saw that -- saw what the prosecution was proving, what\nwe were capable of proving in the courtroom. There could be other reasons, Trifa may have felt\nthat this was too much of an embarrassment. This may have been an issue at the denaturalization\nstage, after all, he was the head of the Romanian American Orthodox church, he wasn\u2019t just a\nprivate citizen. Which certainly helped in terms of funding to pay his lawyers, but might have\nbeen a problem in terms of his parishioners. There may have been problems in the church. Other\nchurch leaders may have been a little upset at Trifa\u2019s posi -- Trifa being who he was, and what\nthat was doing to the reputation of the rom -- Romanian American church, but I don\u2019t know that.\nI don\u2019t know what went into that ultimate decision to throw in the towel.",
        "Q: Peter, you said you were at the trial, that y --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that -- the tri -- the deportation, cause the --",
        "A: The deportation hearing, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have a role there as part of the staff, are you simply an observer?",
        "A: No, we definitely -- the historian is definitely a part of the prosecution team. This was\nsomething that came to be established fairly early on. I was at the -- the first case that I went to\ntrial with was the Schellong case, which went, I believe in the summer of 1981, and I also was at\nthe trial in the Maikovskis case. And the role the historian played there was a -- ultimately, other\nthan the expert, the case historian has the strongest knowledge of the historical documentation,\nwe're talking in the Trifa case we had over 700 exhibits, and the historian, more than the\nattorney could pull not only the exhibits that were geared for exhibits, but the exhibits that were\nthere as background, that were -- m-might become important for one reason or another during the\ncourse of the trial. Only the historian had that knowledge at his -- or in Elizabeth White\u2019s case,\nhers -- her fingertrip -- her fingertips.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And this was something that relieved the attorney of having to worry about that. And it\nrelieved the paralegal, who could read the translations but could not read the original documents,\nand if there was a discrepancy it relieved the paralegal of having to worry about that, and\nallowed him or her to concentrate on the location, the physical location of the individual exhibits.\nThere was another function as well. One -- one never knew what kinds of defenses would come\nup, what kinds of issues would come up at trial. There might be an unanticipated defense, an\nunanticipated piece of evidence, something that the -- that the defense would introduce at the last\nmoment, whether it\u2019d been turned over in discovery or not. One could never know whether the\njudge would let it in, regardless of what the rules were, and the rules were pretty lax in\nimmigration court. And the historian had to be there 1n order, if it were in a foreign language, to\nread the language, and also to analyze the context of the document so that the prosecution could\nbe ready to move forward, regardless of the issue. And so it was -- it was very much to manage\nthe knowledge --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- manage the data, not -- not the knowledge but the data contained in the documents, and also\nas a preventative, a prophylactic measure a-against surprises in -- in terms of evidence that the\ndefense might present, or materials that the defense might present that the prosecution didn\u2019t\nanticipate.",
        "Q: Now what languages are you fluent in, so if --",
        "A: I could read German, in which most of the documentation was involved, and during periods in\nmy career, I could read some kitchen Polish and kitchen Romanian. I\u2019ve forgotten both of the\nlast two. I can still pick out certain words, but if there was something that was purported to be a\npolice document for instance, depending on the letterhead, you could get a se -- an immediate\nsense of whether this was a genuine document or not, and be in a position to advise the attorney,\nlook, we need to have a recess, we need to fax this back to the office, we need to get somebody\nto look at it and translate it, to -- to take those steps, if necessary, to get the contents of the\ndocument available to the prosecution team.",
        "Q: What did the room look like? What kind of a room was it? Was it a courtroom courtroom, or\nwas it a --",
        "A: Yes, it was a courtroom. It was a courtroom -- in every case it was a courtroom not so\ndifferent than the kinds that you see on court TV.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so you would sit at -- at the left or right side [indecipherable]",
        "A: The historian would be, in most cases, at the very beginning, there was a sort of an attorney -\nnot attorney thing, and the attorneys wanted to sit at the table, and the historian was to be in the\nfront row of the audience --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- but given the practical momentum or -- or dynamic of how a trial went, the attorneys\nquickly -- the lead attorneys quickly insisted that the historian be there --",
        "Q: Be there.",
        "A: -- be there. And the attorneys -- you would often have two or three attorneys in a case, and\neach attorney was responsible for different witnesses and different parts of the presentation,\nyou'd have a -- an introductory argument most of the time, you\u2019d have a closing argument.\nYou\u2019d have one attorney responsible for the expert witness, which was after all the crux of the\nprosecution\u2019s case. That same attorney, or possibly another attorney would be responsible for the\ntestimony of the defendant, if the defendant was either called -- occasionally we called the\ndefendant as a prosecution witness, but more often the defendant testified in his own behalf, and\nthe government\u2019s attorney then had an opportunity to cross examine. Then you had another\nattorney, more often a -- a -- a more junior attorney responsible for survivor witnesses and for\nwitnesses who testified as to the immigration process, th-the qualifications for certification as\nrefugee, the qualifications for certification as a displaced person, and the vice counsels.",
        "Q: And could other people be there? Was this -- this was an open hearing?",
        "A: These were public trials.",
        "Q: They were public trials?",
        "A: Yes, they were public trials. I don\u2019t recall -- certainly none of the cases I was involved in was\na see -- was a Si -- was a Closed trial.",
        "Q: Reporters could come as well?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And report on what was going on?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Were expert witnesses rehearsed, or were they supposed to be to --",
        "A: They were prepped the way any witness would be prepped in any kind of civil or criminal\ncase. Our witnesses -- w-we\u2019d go over the questions we wanted to ask them, and listen to their\nanswers, and there were often times when the answer we were expecting was not one that the\nexpert was comfortable with, and there was a dynamic, and h-here the historian played a\nsignificant role, often in the evening before trial, and in the evenings between the -- betwe --\nbetween testimony of the expert witness in finding a common ground where the prosecution and\nthe expert witness could both be comfortable with what the expert witness was saying, because\nthere would be disputes and the expert witness was truly an independent witness and if he\nwouldn\u2019t say what the lawyer expected him to say, that was a problem. And none of the OSI\nattorneys wanted to be accused of coaching a witness to say something that wasn\u2019t true. And the\nstaff historian often played a role, using his or her knowledge of the documentation at finding\nsomething that both expert witness and prosecuting attorney could feel comfortable with.",
        "Q: Right. So of course, the attorney doesn\u2019t want to be surprised at trial. You need to have a real\nsense of what\u2019s going to happen.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely, and there is also a process of preparing the expert witness for cross\nexamine questions -- cross examination questions that he might get, and they -- the whole\nprocess of prepping for that. But this is something that\u2019s not unusual and happens in all\nproceedings and the defense does it with their witnesses as well.",
        "Q: Right. Not -- not that I\u2019m going to ask you to name names, I\u2019d never ask you to do that, but I\nwould imagine you folks had favorite expert witnesses, and people you said we\u2019re not going to\nuse this person again, or this is -- were there qualities that you needed in an expert witness\nbesides his expert -- or her -- not that you had any, but in this case, males, their expert --\nknowing something doesn\u2019t mean they will be effective in the courtroom.",
        "A: Yes, th-the expert had to be comfortable enough with the material to be able to speak, offer\nhis opinions with confidence.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And -- and in a sense that\u2019s really what it was, it was an issue -- the expert had to be an\nexpert, had to be comfortable enough with the data to be able to get up there and speak with\nconfidence. And you can\u2019t just, in my experience -- and I worked well with all of the experts that\nI worked with, the one I worked with most often was a gentleman named Charlie Sidmore, and I\nworked with him in the Hajda case, as you saw from the transcript. But it -- 1t had to -- there had\nto be enough knowledge, enough familiarity with the material on the part of the expert, which\nmeant the expert really had to do some work, and independent work, so that he could get up on\nthe stand and feel really comfortable about what he was saying and even if he did make a\nmistake, which we\u2019re all human and we do make a mistake, that we could make sure that it was\ncleared up on a follow-up question, or on redirect examination, if the mistake was made on cross\nexamination. Cause the -- the -- the nature of these cases, and the level at which the information\nwas relevant -- most historians deal with the upper levels of an agency, and where we were\ndealing with people on the ground that are -- is generally not of much historical -- broader\nhistorical significance, given the complexity of the documentation, experts would forget this or\nthat, or the other thing, and a follow-up question was often all one needed to trigger off what the\nexpert already knew.",
        "Q: I\u2019m interested to hear what happens to you when you\u2019re an expert witness, and I\u2019m wondering\nif you can comment on this. Most people you have as expert witnesses are academics, I imagine,\nof -- of some kind. Am I right?",
        "A: All have an academic background.",
        "Q: Academic background.",
        "A: All are trained as academics. We had at least one expert witness who was not -- did not hold a\nuniversity position in the most recent 10 years of his career, but he continued to be academically\nactive.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In other words, they were all experts in the sense that they continued to work with primary\nsource documents, they continued to write history, they continued to analyze documentation, and\nthey kept up on the latest research in the field in which they were expert.",
        "Q: Is it uncomfortable in some ways for academics to do it in a court setting, because ambiguity\nis not what you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019re loo -- you\u2019re looking for a very specific kind of clarity.\nNow maybe it\u2019s my bias, because I was a philosopher, being -- living with ambiguity is sort of\nthe rule, and maybe as an historian that\u2019s not quite as true, but --",
        "A: I -- I think -- 1-it\u2019s been my experience, at least from what I\u2019ve observed with experts on the\nstand, that there are times when the moo -- th-the rules of the courtroom, as to what gets in, what\n-- what -- what doesn\u2019t get in, can be frustrating to the effort to explain the context of a situation.\nBut I noticed in -- and I\u2019m thinking of at least two or three expert witnesses, who were able to\novercome quickly, that discomfort and work with the rules of -- of evidence.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And in a sense, 1-it just requires you to know your material very, very well. To get a sense of\nthe dynamic of the questioning. To not be flustered by interruptions by the defense, because the\ndefense attorney\u2019s job is to try to disrupt as much as possible, the train of thought of the expert,\nand to try to -- even the most decent of defense attorneys -- to try to catch the expert witnesses --\nwitness, in errors of fact or interpretation that would serve to undermine his whole testimony.\nAnd those experts who accepted that, were competent enough in their material not to get\nflustered by those interruptions and kept going back and kept listening to, and following the\ndirection of the questions, usually got most of what the -- they intended to say, out.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And in -- in -- in that sense, the expert testimony, taken together with the trial record offered a\nfairly good picture of the history of this particular defendant.",
        "Q: Now what about the use of survivor testimonies, or I don\u2019t know how you call them, other\nkinds of witnesses, they\u2019re not considered expert witnesses, but experiential witnesses.",
        "A: Eyewitnesses, in a sense.",
        "Q: Eyewitness, yeah.",
        "A: W-We use two types -- actually three types of eyewitnesses. There were two -- there was a\ntraditional type of eyewitness, whether it was a survivor, or a fellow perpetrator who actually\nsaw specific events at hand. We also used, a-a-and in this case survivor witnesses who may not\nhave probably 1-1in many cases, most cases, didn\u2019t know the defendant, had no idea what the\ndefendant did, but could talk in general about what his or her perception of what the guards were\ndoing was, and also more important, what life was like. There\u2019s no one, no book, no perpetrator\ntestimony, no historian can possibly get across with the same intensity as a survivor talking, what\nit felt like to the survivor. And it -- when the survivor talks, in that sense, if one ac-accepts the\ntestimony as being no more than what it 1s, that survivor\u2019s memory, some of the inaccuracies that\ninevitably come up in human memory, even when they can\u2019t be reconciled with an explanation,\nstill don\u2019t detract from the image of what life was like in a concentration camp, or in a line\nwaiting to be shot at a pit. That this is something that -- this kind of testimony lends an\nimmediacy that the dry documentation just can\u2019t give. But it also is less immu -- less vulnerable\nto attack than testimony, I saw him do it, because that raises all sorts of questions of how the\nwitness knew who he was. And remember, he was most often wearing a uniform, and a cap, and\nlooked pretty much like the next him and the next him after that. And how does this witness\nremember this particular person as opposed to anyone else? And in a trial with a dynamic where\nthe defense attorney has the opportunity and must have the opportunity to question that witness\u2019s\nmemory, to try to trip that witness, to try to ask questions, well isn\u2019t it possible that you could be\nmistaken? How do you really know that it was this person and not someone else? And in that ki -\n- type of dynamic, that kind of testimony, unless there was some reason for the survivor witness\nto have known the man, the way you would -- the way you would judge the credibility of any\neyewitness, in any criminal case, the eyewitnesses -- the survivor testimony was often much\nmore effective to give a picture of the climate of persecution, to offer evidence as to the identity\nof the people who are being persecuted through their own persons. This was stuff that they knew.\nThis was stuff that they would not be mistaken about and could not be mistaken about. Then we\nhad a third type of witness, we had to develop how the process of certifying refugees, and how\nthe refugees applied for visas, we had to establish that particular process. And we did that by\nlocating individuals who had actually worked on those processes. In other words, displaced\npersons -- officials from the displaced persons commission. Officials from the counter-\nintelligence corps, state department visa officials. In -- in -- I -- I can\u2019t remember a single case\nfrankly, where any one of these officials remembered the specific case that they were asked to\ntestify. Well, after all, during the DP act there were 400,000 visas. That meant 400,000\ninvestigations and 400,000 pre-application interviews. And no reasonable individual could be\nexpected to remember one person as opposed to another, particularly if there wasn\u2019t a -- a\nspecific hooker about that -- that case. But what we could ask them about was what was the\nregular procedure? Did you swear it was -- was -- was the applicant required to swear to the truth\nof what he was saying? What did the applicant need in order to become eligible to be a displaced\nperson, to receive a visa? What were the exclusionary measures? How were they implemented?\nAnd in that way, the witness could take -- offer the judge testimony on how things actually\nworked. And we used those witnesses -- the OSI used those witnesses to introduce\ndocumentation regulations of the international refugee organization, regulations of the d --\nDisplaced Persons Commission. Visa regulations, advisory reports and what have you, that were\nrelevant to the process of how a displaced person entered the United States and what information\nhe was required to offer about his person in order to complete his application.",
        "Q: Right. We\u2019re not -- it\u2019s Hajda, right?",
        "A: Hajda, yeah.",
        "Q: Hajda. In the Hajda case you had two survivors from Treblinka, who interestingly enough\ncould mention the names of two other guards, but of course did not know -- Hajda was -- was\ninteresting, and th-the emphasis on the testimony was apparently not very much. There was an\nargument about inclusion of the testimony and the judge agreed to include it, but then didn\u2019t use\nit very much in the final decision. And so, was it to give it a -- a taste of what this place was like,\nso that one could make a connection between what Hajda must have been doing, had he been\nthere?",
        "A: I -- I -- I think the judge wanted to hear that. And -- a-and that certainly was the purpose of\nthose witness -- they couldn\u2019t say anything about Hajda personally, neither of them, as I\nremember. They -- they -- even though it was a small camp, there were only roughly a hundred,\n120 guards there at any one time. I-In that particular camp, the -- the commandant was a\npsychopath who often personally took pleasure in torturing individual prisoners, so he was a\nperson who was fairly well known, even by name, to the prisoners of the camp. It was a small\nprison camp too, there were under a thousand people in the camp, under a thousand Jews. And\nthere was one guard, a particularly cruel guard, who had the bad luck to have a patch over his\neye. And so he was remembered, not necessarily by name, but they all remembered the one with\nthe patch over his eye, and that\u2019s natural. And in fact, the one with the patch over his eye, bad as\nhe was, often got blamed for virtually everything because a -- a -- a -- a survivor witness, in\nremembering bad things that happened also remembered the guy with the patch over his eye, and\nthat the guy with the patch over his eye was a bad guy, and so the connection was made. And in\nmany cases they were right, and in some cases they weren\u2019t right. But Hajda was just one guard\namong many and it -- in -- in that case it was very typical of the survivor\u2019s relationship to the\nnormal -- normal in quotes -- prisoner guar -- the normal guard, that he was a person in a\nuniform, that unless there was some reason to know him on a daily basis, like a prisoner worked\nin a tailor shop and the guard commonly came to the tailor shop to get his boots fixed, there was\nsome relationship that was ongoing. But just a guard on the perimeter was someone that the\nwitness, after 40 years, couldn\u2019t be expected -- it wouldn\u2019t be fair to burden the witness with\ntrying to remember that particular person. And so in this particular case it was made easy for us\nbecause the defendant stipulated to all of the horrors in the Treblinka one camp.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: He stipulated to that, he said, okay I can see all of that. The issue was, was Bronislaw Hajda\nthe person who was listed as Bronislaw Hajda in the -- in the documentation. And this is why the\njudge was so concerned about the prosecution\u2019s efforts to document exactly what happened to\neach person who was on those two and -- and -- and later three and four when you take Battalion\nStreibel into the process, rosters to document their whereabouts, to convince as in this case the\nOSI did, to convince the judge that the information ab -- of the -- 1 -- contained in these rosters,\nthe personal data and the information as to where these people were, was accurate, and did refer\nto these particular people. And the judge was convinced of that.",
        "Q: Do you ever remember a case where an eyewitness, who was a survivor, who was at the\nplace, was actually able to identify a particular person and be accepted for that, not because it\nwas a vague remembrance, but was there ever an instance where that was the case, th-that it\nworked, people --",
        "A: There was one case that I was on, the Bruno Blach case, where I was personally convinced\nthat the survivor knew -- identified correctly, the individual as a guard. I was never quite certain\nthat he correctly identified the individual as the person who committed a killing, which he did\nidentify. But the reasons that his particular recognition of this person struck me as viable, and I\nsaw him -- I saw him look at the photo spread, and in fact was -- when -- when the person was\nextradited to West Germany, the defendant was extradited to West Germany, I had to testify as a\nwitness, an eyewitness to that identification process. There was no question that the face, the\nlikeness of that picture registered with the -- with the witness in that case, in my mind. I was\nwatching him when he looked at the photo spread, and I knew which photo was the defendant.\nAnd I was not asking the questions, an investigator was asking the questions, I was watching.\nAnd I saw him -- I -- I saw him when he hit that particular photo, flinch. And this was a very\nsmall camp, it was a sub-camp of Mauthausen, about 2000 prisoners, maybe a hundred guards\nand a small squad of guards with canines, about 15 of them. And this was one of the guys with a\ncanine. He was a Sudaten German, and he also had a particularly handsome face. He was -- he\nwas just striking looking. He was someone that one might remember in the context of a small\ngroup of people in a small camp, where the individual who was a Polish prisoner was -- was\nthere for two years, both in -- both prisoner and guard were there for two years. The prisoners all\nworked in one factory, the guards all escorted them every day to that one factory. I don\u2019t know to\nthis day whether the identification of this person as the killer in this case, was accurate. I don\u2019t\nknow to this day. Under interrogation later in the West German proceeding against this\nindividual, the evidence became so contradictory, even as to the identity of the victim of that\nshooting, that the defendant was ultimately acquitted in a criminal trial of the specific murder.\nBut there\u2019s no question in my mind that that face was known to the witness. But that was the\nonly case that I worked on in which I was convinced completely that an eyewitness recognized\nthe defendant.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I think we\u2019re going to take a break and then go through what you consider to be the\nmost important pieces of these cases that we\u2019ve been mentioning, okay?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: All right, you can stop now.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Okay. Peter, I wa -- ga -- I -- I want to have us have some discussion about these four trials\nthat we said we would talk about. But before we do that I wanted to ask you a question about the\ndenaturalization process.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Is the denaturalization process answering a question, is this person of moral character? And is\nthe lack of moral character based on the fact that there was a material misrepresentation in the\ndenaturalization process -- or the naturalization process? Is that where it comes from, or 1s it a\njudgment of who they were during the war?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s the -- the bad moral character is a judgment based on the material misrepresentation.\nThat because one lied, the violation is that one made false statements to obtain a federal benefit -",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- which citizenship is. And that that indicated that this was a person of bad moral character.\nBut the false statements, again, had to be material.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And in these specific cases, they had to cons -- they had to relate to information concealed\nthat could have or would have led to -- led to the uncovery of persecution.",
        "Q: Now this -- this I know is a hypothetical question because I\u2019m not sure it ever -- it ever\nhappened, but I\u2019m wondering what you -- you think might happen in a case like this. Suppose\nsomebody was in some sense a war criminal. They were members of these organizations which if\nthey identified themselves as part of them, would have denied them citizenship. So let\u2019s say they\ndid come under false pretenses, and you find this out, and you start a complaint, and what the\nperson does is confess, but also talk about how they hated what they did, or they changed their\nwhat -- that they -- they\u2019re a different person. Is there ever -- could there ever be an instance\nwhere somebody could be considered -- I don\u2019t know, do I say becomes --",
        "A: Reformed?",
        "Q: -- reformed? Would that matter, or if someone tried to become -- admitted who they were\nhonestly, and said, but I renounce that. They say it honestly to the people who --",
        "A: Now if it -- there\u2019s really two questions. If someone 1s at -- and 1 -- this goes for any\nimmigrant, there\u2019s -- there\u2019s nothing special about the Nazi cases in this. If someone admits to an\nactivity or an affiliation that would make that person ineligible to enter the United States, and if\nit was a long time ago, or if the person could convince the -- the consular official that he or she\ndid in fact renounce that, there\u2019s obviously discretion. There\u2019s -- there\u2019s dis -- there\u2019s discretion\nto permit, to give a visa anyway, the -- each official has discretion. Now, if the person lied and\ngot in on the basis of concealing the information, the theory as I understand it, and it\u2019s probably\nbest to ask the attorneys when you do interview them, the theory as I understand it 1s that\nbecause you lied, in theory if we prove that you lied, your status goes back to where you were\nbefore you obtained the visa, which is as an alien about which we can then determine whether\nyou are eligible to enter the United States. Now, the burden of proof is on the government once\nyou\u2019re here. In other words, the OSI always had the burden of proof in its cases against\nindividuals who are here. But if you\u2019re an alien seeking entry into the United States, the burden\nof proof that you\u2019re eligible is upon the alien. So the alien must convince and demonstrate to the\nimmigration official, and to the consular official, that he is a person, or she is a person eligible to\nenter the United States. We\u2019ve never had to my knowledge, and I can -- I\u2019ve never had a case\nthat I worked on where individuals -- I should maybe strike that, there was one individual who\nconfessed and said that he was sorry, but I couldn\u2019t be sure that he wasn\u2019t just saying that\nbecause now he was caught, and that this was an effort to sort of get some mitigating\ncircumstance. I\u2019ve never had a situation here in the United States where we ran into an individual\nwho was torn up about what he had done because of what it was that he had done --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- not because of the situation he found himself vis-a-vis the immigration authorities. May\nhave played a role, but we have not had people actually come in without us finding them to\nconfess and say that they wish they hadn't done it.",
        "Q: Is -- was --",
        "A: So it\u2019s hard to separate --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- the confession from the circumstance in which the defendant or subject finds himself. Been\nthrough some rocky times, and there have been some instances where the families of defendants\nhad no idea, had no clue what the father had done, or had been during the second World War.\nAnd this is certainly a hard thing for the families to suddenly have to deal with this, and they deal\nwith it -- and they\u2019ve dealt with it, at least as far as I\u2019ve seen, in very different -- in different\nways, from outright aggression against the government to really despair over who they are and\nwhere they came from. But no, we\u2019ve never had a situation where we could be sure -- where I\ncould be sure, I can only speak for myself, that the remorse was unconnected to the situation of\nhaving been caught in the lie.",
        "Q: I hadn\u2019t thought about the families, now that you mention it. In most cases, would you say\nthat the families resent the government and are angry at the government and don\u2019t believe the\ngovernment?",
        "A: In some cases.",
        "Q: Some cases.",
        "A: I-I think it varies.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I think it varies. What -- what I was saying was that in some cases the children and -- and\npossibly even the spouse, particularly if the subject met the spouse after the war, or met her here\nin the United States, they have no clue that subject X -- that husband and father X was a\nconcentration camp guard, or was a shooter in a -- in a police squad in the east. And it\u2019s got to be\nshocking information if you had no idea before that.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: There are some cases where the spouse at least knows, or suspects, and perhaps there are\nsome cases where the children know to a c -- to a certain degree, but I have seen cases where\nthey didn\u2019t. And that this was a complete surprise.",
        "Q: And th -- and you\u2019ve seen cases where the -- the children or the spouse had to separate out\nthemselves from the father, that -- that this was so awful that they couldn\u2019t -- or were they\nalways filled with ambivalence because --",
        "A: That -- that\u2019s pretty hard to determine --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- because the only time that we -- we the historians, at any rate, saw the families, if at all,\nwas at the pre -- in -- pre-filing interview, if there was one. At the post-filing deposition, where\nthe testimony of the defendant is -- is obtained on the record, or sometimes at trial, but\nsometimes not. So often we -- if -- 1f a spouse or a son, wa -- who would now be grown, was --\nwas present, we\u2019d sometimes see the reaction of the spouse or the son to what they were hearing.\nAnd sometimes it was -- seemed apparent, or sometimes it seemed likely that they were hearing\nthis for the first time. But it\u2019s hard to know what would happen, at least in my ey -- since I didn\u2019t\nfollow the families in many of the -- these cases, it\u2019s hard to know what their ultimate -- what the\nultimate affect of this case was on the family life.",
        "Q: In most of the cases, if not all of the cases that you were a part of, since people were here in\nthis country for a number of years before you made a complaint against them, were most of them\nliving honest, upright lives? Not members of racist groups, or neo-Nazi groups, or --",
        "A: Most of them were living fairly ordinary middle class, or lower middle class lives. There were\na few that had made it quite well, and there were a few that were sort of on the margins. But with\nrare exceptions, they were not, as such, lawbreakers, in the United States.",
        "Q: And -- and did you -- do you folks working at OSI sort of have little question marks in your\nhead? I mean, what does this -- what does this mean about that particular era? These people\ncome and they radically -- they become -- I don\u2019t want to say normal citizens, cause I don\u2019t\nknow what in heaven\u2019s name that really means, but they\u2019re not criminals any more. And they\nlive a life that is not a bad life.",
        "A: Well, that -- that\u2019s an interesting question. The way I look at it is -- 1s another way, in that it\u2019s\nimportant for all of us, I think, as ordinary, if that --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- is a meaningful word, as ordinary citizens of a society, that there be at least the potential, if\nwe do something like what was done during the second World War, regardless of the\ncircumstances in which the individual found himself, whether he was compelled to do it, or\nwhether he did it out of his own a -- a -- as a volunteer, that there be some possibility of legal\nconsequence for that, no matter how many years go by, in terms of that type of crime, I -- I feel -\n- in a recent news reports of the proceedings against the Chilean -- former Chilean dictator,\nAugusto Pinochet, that this -- though there are legal problems at every stage, there\u2019s serious legal\nproblems, the idea that our world, as a world society now, is no longer prepared to sweep\nresponsibility for crimes in an official position, where an official abuses the law and causes death\nand suffering to people in his care, or her care, if in the future, that -- that there shouldn\u2019t be\nsome, somewhere down the line, the possibility of legal consequence for that. So I\u2019m quite\ncomfortable with that for these particular crimes. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a believer that\npeople can\u2019t -- that I believe that people can\u2019t be re -- rehabilitated, but I do believe that people\nneed to take responsibility for what they\u2019ve done.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Even if it\u2019s something that they were compelled to do. I guess the ideal for me personally,\nwould be to get to a point where each one of us has a sense that there are certain things that\nwe\u2019re not going to do, that it -- it\u2019s better to die than to do.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And there was one statement, Soviet protocol of a former Trawniki man, who made this\nstatement, and regardless of what you might say about Soviet protocols, this clearly wasn\u2019t -- it\nwas so unusual that it clearly wasn\u2019t canned. The individual involved had been a Soviet soldier\nwho was captured and was selected out of a Soviet prisoner of war camp, where he probably\nwould have starved had he not been selected for service at Trawniki. And he stated, after having\nserved as a Trawniki trained guard -- and I can\u2019t remember where he served, he stated to his\ninterrogator after the war, to his Soviet interrogator, that it would have been better for me had I\ndied in that prison camp. And if we are at a stage where there are things of that nature, that we as\nhuman beings will not do to other human beings, even faced with death, dictatorships are going\nto have a hard time carrying out mass murders. And one element of that is at least having some\npotential of legal consequence for participation in that kind of crime.",
        "Q: Now, I know you\u2019re not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but the other part of the question 1s --\nand I -- y-you certainly don\u2019t even have to try to answer it if it doesn\u2019t make sense, is how do\npeople do that kind of thing, and then become a non-criminal, and -- do you -- do you know what\nI mean? It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s -- it --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- what -- what is it about what you see in these people? Is it just -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s opportunistic. I\ndon\u2019t mean that they took the opportunity -- or some -- some well may have, to do certain things,\nbut it\u2019s opportunistic within a certain situation. It\u2019s not opportunistic, it\u2019s not the best way to be\nin another situation, so they become like everybody else. So it\u2019s -- I-I -- I don\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t\nactually thought about this before reading all this stuff, but it\u2019s curious to me, the sort of --",
        "A: I -- is the question you\u2019re asking, how can someone who\u2019s done something like this --",
        "Q: Just --",
        "A: -- just turn it all off --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- and become a normal citizen? Obviously it\u2019s different --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- for different people, but clearly this was an extraordinary time. And many of those who\nparticipated in it as perpetrators, as well as those who experienced it as victims, recognize that it\nwas an extraordinary time in which things were done that you don\u2019t normally do. Many of the\nperpetrators, certainly most of the perpetrators that were prosecuted by OSI were youngsters.\nTeenagers, or late teens, early 20\u2019s when this process began for them. So it was, sadly, a part of\ntheir maturing process, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily a part of their quote normal unquote behavior.\nOnce it was over, once there was no authority, no compuls -- no authority to encourage, or\ncompulsion to compel to participate in those acts, for many it was not that hard to rationalize\nwhat had happened, and even to say, well from now on I\u2019m going to be a good citizen. From now\non -- even perhaps because of this past, I\u2019m going to be very careful about the laws in my new\ncountry. For the perpetrators, in many ways, those who came to the new world, they were\nstarting, particularly the young ones, they were starting as much of a new life, sadly, as the\nsurvivors, with much less right to do so.",
        "Q: Yeah, right. The tri -- trif -- Trifa case.",
        "A: Trifa, yeah.",
        "Q: Go back and forth in my pronunciations. That is a case about -- primarily about a propaganda,\nso what I\u2019d like to do is see how we can contrast each of these four -- for what\u2019s sort of at the\ncenter of the accusation to get a -- a sense of the range of OSI [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I thought of these particular four cases, in fact three are fairly similar. Schellong\nis a concentration camp guard at an officer level. Bartesch is a concentration camp guard at -- at\nthe grunt level.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And Hajda is also a concentration camp guard at the grunt level in a different system.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true, right.",
        "A: When I chose those cases, the -- the thing they had in common, other than the fact that I was\nassigned to them, and they were meaningful to me because I was with each one of them, in a\nsense, from beginning -- well, Trifa not quite, but from beginning to end, was that each in its\nown way reflected a rather unique feature of advancing the role of the historian, or advancing the\nnature of the research that went into dev -- the development of these cases. Schellong was the\nfirst concentration camp case.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The -- that -- the first WVHA concentration camp case --",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: -- that we had. We\u2019d had -- Federenko was a Treblinka guard before that, we\u2019d had -- I don\u2019t\nthink we\u2019d had another concentration camp case before that. So the whole WVHA system, the\nwhole concept of protective arrest, the camps in the era before the war, this was something that\nhistorically new ground had to be broken in terms of how we presented that evidence. It was also\nmy first case, so it was the first -- 1t was my learning process, and I worked together with two\nexcellent attorneys, Joe Lynch and Janet DeCosta, who were very flexible about giving me the\nautonomy to do what I felt needed to be done. It was an excellent working relationship, and I --\nfor me, it developed the model of the working relationship between the do -- two professions,\nwhich despite all the names and epithets we call one another, look at evidence in not always so\ndissimilar ways. A-An-And certainly are capable and have in many cases, collaborated quite well\nin the presentation, not only of a good case, but of a fairly good historical record as well.",
        "Q: How would you characterize that relationship, since it became a model for you? What -- what\n-- what are you --",
        "A: The attorneys that I have worked with on cases, it\u2019s a very good relationship, it\u2019s based on\nmutual respect, it\u2019s based on a mutual understanding of what each of us -- and -- and each of us\nas representatives of our profession, can contribute to the development of this case, and the p-\npresent -- an-and the successful presentation of the case before a judge. And it\u2019s a good dynamic,\nI think. It worked -- it -- it worked very, very well from the first case, the Schellong case, to the\nlast case I worked on, which was the Hajda case, there were rarely -- I-I\u2019m not -- that\u2019s not to say\nthat there weren\u2019t arguments and -- and screaming matches from time to time which were -- were\n-- were a part of the workplace.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But there was always a -- a mutual understanding that we needed one another --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- very much, 1n order to do what our common aim was, was to u-u-uncover the individual\u2019s\nresponsibility for the violation and to make possible the appropriate adjudication of the case.\nAnd that was a common goal, and despite whatever conflicts there were, there was always that\nreturn to the cooperation, and in -- in my case, I -- I have to say there were relatively fle -- few\nconflicts.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, that it -- it was a -- a normal and healthy working relationship from -- for 20 years.",
        "Q: Was the Schellong case a difficult case?",
        "A: The Schellong case was actually a fairly simple case. It was -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I think it, if I\nremember correctly, Schellong was identified as being in the United States in approximately\nMarch 1980, and he was removed from the United States in \u201983 or \u201984. That was after\ndenaturalization, deport, and all the -- all the -- all the appeals processes in between. Which is a\nrelatively short time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The trial was in the summer of 1981, it\u2019s 18 months, which isn\u2019t -- it isn\u2019t a very long time to\nput together a case. So the mechanics of the case -- most of the material was in the United States,\nsome of it was in the Federal Republic of Germany, but most of it was in the United States, easy\nto get ahold of, easy to have certified, easy to have translated. What was special about the case\nfrom my perspective, was the fact that it was this learning process, of learning what was needed\nof me, as a historian, to make this case go. And learning -- learning to understand the perspective\nof the attorneys, to understand, at least in what they would call a minimal way, how the rules of\nthe courtroom affect the presentation of evidence, and how to reconcile, as much as possible, the\nhistorical record with the rules of evidence. And I think where we were successful in doing that,\nwe had not only winning cases, but cases that -- that offer something to history as well. With\nTrifa, I -- I mentioned it earlier, that -- that Trifa had special aspects to his defense which\nrequired a much broader and deeper analysis of each particular segment of that case, and they\nwere broken down essentially into the 10 segments that you -- that you had to carry around and\nread over the last couple of weeks.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: With Bartesch, which we haven\u2019t talked much about --",
        "Q: Cou -- cou -- li -- before we get to Bartesch, I want to --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- ask you something about Schellong, because it was --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- interesting to me in reading the judgment about Schellong is that he was training people. He\nwas --",
        "A: Yes, at Dachau.",
        "Q: Dachau. And -- however, it was very clear in the judgment that there was no proof that he did\nanything to a prisoner, that he had anything to do -- he was not part of the commandant\u2019s staff,\nand so I wonder -- suppose he had trained these people outside of Dachau. Would that have been\nas much of a problem?",
        "A: If the --",
        "Q: I mean -- or more -- it wouldn\u2019t create a -- a -- more of a problem in terms of making a\ncomplaint against him.",
        "A: If the purpose of the training was to train concentration camp guards, if the concentration\ncamp guards are assisting 1n persecution, certainly the person who trains them 1s also assisting in\npersecution. It s -- would have been an issue if, as a practical matter -- that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s theory, as\na practical matter, if he had been training them in basic guard detail, where the guardi -- 1-it\ncould be guarding prisoners or guarding buildings at a site away from the concentration camp,\nthat would have been a harder case to make.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: The case that would have had to have been made would have been the case that he was\ntraining these men to be concentration camp guards, and this is what it means to be a\nconcentration camp guard. And that would, in our estimation when we brought the case, would\nconstitute participation in persecution, or assistance in persecution.",
        "Q: Who ra -- I\u2019m now trying to remember, I don\u2019t know whether you remember who raised the\nquestion of the fact that he never -- there\u2019s no evidence that he beat a prisoner, or that he was\nactually having much to do with prisoners at all. Was it your side, or was it that he\n[indecipherable] can\u2019t remember?",
        "A: I can\u2019t recall that. I suspect it was the defense at that point --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- but it -- that was really the issue to a certain degree, that was decided by the Supreme Court\nin Federenko, which was -- the Supreme Court decision came down in 1980 in Federenko, which\nwas right before the Schellong case, that it didn\u2019t matter whether Federenko personally beat,\nassaulted or -- or -- or hurt a prisoner in any way. Just the fact that he was guarding was --",
        "Q: Was enough.",
        "A: -- constituted assistance in persecution, that a camp guard, a member of a camp guard unit, by\ndoing his daily duties, was assisting in persecution.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that was the issue that was ultimately decided in Schellong, and that was the issue that --\nthat -- that form that pr -- precedent comes from Federenko that formed the precedent for the e --\nevery subsequent case that involved a concentration camp.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s go to Bartesch.",
        "A: Bartesch was unique for me in that it was the one case where there was credible evidence,\nperhaps not beyond a reasonable doubt evidence, but certainly clear and convincing evidence\nthat he, Martin Bartesch shot someone on whom a name could be pinned. And it was also\ninteresting in how that evidence came up, and how it was found. We had a series of\nconcentration camp cases related to Mauthausen, and th -- and this is a -- a good example of how\nOSI operates. The Bruno Blach case, which I was assigned to, involved a sub-camp of\nMauthausen, and that case was already under investigation as early as 1980. In investigating that\ncase during the mid-80\u2019s when I investigated it, I went to the National Archives, to look through\neach of the U.S. military trials of Mauthausen personnel, that U.S. military personnel had\nconducted at the site of the Dachau concentration camp, in the records of the Judge Advocate\nGeneral. Here -- at that time it was downtown here in -- well, no, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sorry, at that time it\nwas at Sootland, at the Sootland repository, now they\u2019re up in College Park, Maryland. And in\nthe process of looking through all of that stuff, Bruno Blach was never at the main camp except\nfor one day, he was transferred right away to a sub-camp called Wiener Neudorf. But in the\nprocess of identifying everyone whom I could, who went through the Mauthausen system, I\ngathered documentation from all of the Mauthausen and sub-camp trials so that I could put\ntogether an effective report eventually on how a person like Bruno Blach would come from\nDachau, where he was before, via Mauthausen to Wiener Neudorf. Among the records that I\nfound and didn\u2019t pay too much attention to at the time was a -- oh, it must have been about a\nhundred, 120 page document called an unnatural death book, unnatiirliches Todesfalle. U-Un --\nc-cases of unnatural death. Which was a log kept by the authorities of the central camp of\nMauthausen of all unnatural deaths that were unplanned unnatural. That didn\u2019t mean that they\nweren\u2019t planned, but 1t meant a -- a prisoner -- 1f some guards were having fun, and pushed a\nprisoner towards the wire, the guard shot, he was dead. That was recorded. I found it useful, has -\n- has names of guards, I copied it, but filed it because there were -- I did actually do more than\nfile it because there were a couple of cases of shootings in Wiener Neudorf. Not by Bruno Blach,\nbut by others and that\u2019s evidence that if an expert witness wants to say prisoners were shot trying\nto escape at Wiener Neudorf, and the judge or the defense asks well, what do you base that on?\nWhat evidence? And then you have this log. Here so and so was shot on such and such a day,\nand by the way by this ga -- by this particular guard. Not Bruno Blach, but we have records of\nthis. Now as it turned out, during that search I also found a Nuremberg document, 2176 PS,\nwhich was a collection of records that Mauthausen camp prisoners secured from destruction after\nthe war, upon liberation, and turned over to the U.S. army investigator investigating crimes at\nMauthausen from the day that the camp was liberated. He was a major named Eugene Cohen,\nwho we actually found after the war and talked to after the war, although this case never went to\ntrial, and so he -- therefore he was not a witness. But among these records were a series of rosters\nof Mauthausen guards, both at the main camp and at some of the sub-camps. And those rosters\ncontained birthdates and ranks, and even last known addresses, what address that they had before\nthey came to Mauthausen, before they entered German service. And so -- a-and again in -- in\naccordance with standard operating procedure at OSI we turned these over to the research and\ndevelopment department, and they ran them through the INS. And Martin Bartesch came up\nalong with three others as a hit. And we then, in going back -- I had the Mauthausen cases\noriginally, in the mid-80\u2019s. In going back through the documentation, I came back to this book of\nunnatural cases of death, and started reading each of the entries. And sure enough, Bartesch,\nMartin was assigned as a guard who shot a French Jewish teenager on such and such a date, I\nthink it was October 1943. Bartesch himself was a teenager at that time. Bartesch was born, I\nbelieve in October 1926. I think 1t was October of \u201926, and so he was not quite 17, or just turned\n17 when he shot a teenager, who I believe was 15 or 16 or 17, about the same age. And we also\nfound another one of the cases, another one of the subjects who had come up on the roster was\nalso on the list as having shot another French Jew at around the same time. And in that other\ncase, which was the case of Stefan Riley, that individual actually confessed to having shot at a\nperson whose name he didn\u2019t know, when confronted with that information. Both cases never\nwent to trial because both individuals I believe -- Bartesch before -- Bartesch went without a\nlawyer, quickly. In fact, I think it was the same lawyer who later turned up in the Hajda case.\nBartesch was also from Chicago, so the fact that this guy represented Bartesch, made him known\nto Hajda as well, later, I think. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know that for sure, but I do -- I do think\nCollins was also Bartesch\u2019s lawyer. Bartesch pled -- refused to talk to us, as was his right as a\ncitizen. And was protected from doing so by his attorney, and fled to Austria before --",
        "Q: Before the denaturalization?",
        "A: -- I think even bef -- it\u2019s conceivable that it was even before we filed, but it might have been\nafter we filed, just don\u2019t remember any more. But he did flee to Austria, and I believe he was\ndenaturalized after -- yes, he was a citizen. I believe he was denaturalized after his departure.\nRiley, who was the other concentration camp guard, both each at different sub-camps, I believe -\n- no, they both shot at Mauthausen, but they each went to different sub-camps later.

        "Q: And Bartesch? What happened to him there?",
        "A: Bartesch, I don\u2019t -- I think the Austrians -- I don\u2019t really know. I think the Austrians did a pro\nforma, opened a pro forma case, but Bartesch died shortly after, even though he was still a\nrelatively young man. Riley, I -- I -- is presumably dead by now, but at the last I heard he was\nstill alive, which would be late 80\u2019s.",
        "Q: And the Hajda case is an interesting --",
        "A: The Hajda case was significant for me for two reasons. Three reasons, really. It was the first\ncase that I as a historian with the attorney, the partner this time was someone I -- one of my very\nbest and closest friends in the off -- in the OSI, Ned Stuttman. This was the first case that we had\nactually gone to trial with using primarily evidence that came as a result of the collapse of the\nCommunist regimes in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. This case was built, not\nexclusively, but at least three-quarters -- 75 percent of the evidence was evidence that was taken\nfrom witnesses, or found in documentation that had been held behind the Iron Curtain since\n1945. And it also represented our first, as an office, our first extensive use of post-war Soviet\nprotocols, of witness interrogations, where we no longer had the witness alive to be cross-\nexamined. And we used them very, very carefully in that we didn\u2019t accept them all at face value.\nWe were up front about our doubts about the conditions under which this testimony was taken.\nWe were also up front about the possibility that Soviet investigators at that time had specific\ninformation that was going into that protocol whether the witness said it or not. But we used\nthem where the evidence contained in them was consistent with documentation, whether it was\ntestimony given in the west, or captured German documentation, either captured by the western\npowers or by the Soviets, where the information was consistent, we could regard this evidence in\nthe protocols as cooperative evidence. In other words, it didn\u2019t stand alone, but just because it\nwas protocols taken, quite frankly, by Soviet intelligence agents, didn\u2019t mean necessarily that we\nas investigators could, a priori say this is all phony, this is all fake. We had to look at that\nevidence the way any historian -- and here in a sense the lawyers went the way of the historians,\nthe way any historian looks at any evidence, with no a priori preconceptions, a priori suspicions\nbut testing those elements of the testimony that made good historical sense, and being aware of\nthose elements of the testimony which one should rightfully have doubts about. And I can give\nyou an example. There were statements of former Treblinka guards, who identified Hajda, and\nthere was a whole issue, as you probably saw, about the spelling of Hajda, because the Polish --\nthe s -- the -- the sound of Hajda, there\u2019s no H in Russian, and the interrogations were always in\nRussian. There\u2019s no H. The Russians replace H with the Cyrillic equivalent of the --",
        "Q: G.",
        "A: -- the English, or the Roman G, and so it was always Gajda, and there were any variation of\nGajda, it could be G-a-1-d-a. It could be G-a-y-d-a, it could be G-a-y apostrophe d-a. And there\nwas any number of variations of that. And then of course there were the obvio -- the -- the\nmisspellings, and the mistranslations, and the -- the misspellings in the translation. But there\nwere certain testimonies that identified Hajda as a Pole. Now the Russians -- the Soviets didn\u2019t\nhave Hajda. Hajda was in the United States, they didn\u2019t have him. He was only of interest to\nthem in that he was a name, another identification. There\u2019s no evidence that they even knew that\nhe was in the United States, although the Soviets knew about many of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s who were in\nthe United States. There was no interest because he was Polish, and because Poland was also a\nCommunist country, that the Soviets were interested in extraditing him. But there were some\nwitnesses who testified that Hajda was a Pole, even though most of the rest of the people -- a\nPole was an anomaly among the Trawniki men. There were very small Polish recruiting drives,\nand there were only two of them who ever served at Treblinka one, two Poles. And not every\nwitness said Hajda was a Pole. If every witness had said Hajda was a Pole, then one would have\nbeen suspicious. If every witness had gotten the first name right, one would be suspicious. But\nsome of them got the first name, some didn\u2019t. Some got the wrong first name. Some didn\u2019t\nremember a first name at all, they just remembered a g -- a Hajda who was a Pole. And in a\ngroup of a hundred guards, that is more credible. On the other hand, you would get testimonies\nwhere the Soviet interrogator was clearly asking to identify what people were involved in the\nmassacre of the surviving Jewish prisoners when the camp was evacuated in July 1944. And\nthere you\u2019d have a list of 40 names. So and so -- I know so and so participated in the murder of\n350 prisoners on the day that the camp was evacuated. The next guy would -- the s -- the exact\nsame thing. The next guy would the exact same thing. And then you get Hajda\u2019s name, the exact\nsame thing. As a historian, I tended to discount. Didn\u2019t mean that Hajda didn\u2019t participate, but I\ndiscounted that evidence as something that Soviet interrogators were interested in getting it\nbecause of the r -- the repeated question, it was just plugging a name into this statement, that they\nwanted. It was the oddities, the things that were different, that could be corroborated by other\nevidence, and Hajda\u2019s Polish origins were corroborated by personnel documents, and his place of\nbirth. That could be used in these statements. We, in prosecuting the case, never charged that\nHajda personally participated in the killings. We did charge that he was there at the time the\nkillings happened, and we did describe, as you read, in -- in some detail, what the guards, the\nhundred of them, you know, there were a hundred, hundred and 10, were doing while these\nkillings were taking place. So the judge had the data to make a judgment that well, we don\u2019t\nknow what Hajda was doing, but we know he was participating in some way, because guards\nweren\u2019t sitting around. They were all doing one thing, either guarding the people who were\nguarding the perimeter of the camp while the people were being taken out to the woods in groups\nto be shot, guarding those who were left in the camp while the rest were being taken out to be\nshot, escorting groups to the camp, or actually shooting them. It was one of those things, all the\nguards were involved in that because that\u2019s what they were doing on that day. And that was\nbased on the Soviet protocols, and the primary source documentation. And we were able to prove\nthat Hajda was there because of a group of documents from the successor unit of the Trawniki\ntraining camp, the Battalion Streibel. There was a group of 20 men, all still working with the\ncommandant of Treblinka one, who as well was evacuated. Every one of those 20 men were on\nrosters at Treblinka one. So it made no sense, it made no common sense, this was a common\nsense issue for Hajda not to have been there at the time of the killings, and still be on that post-\nevacuation roster with 20 other men who are all at the camp throughout, from 1943 through its\nevacuation in 1944.",
        "Q: Now, his lawyer, Collins, if I remember correctly, was making a big deal that on the\npersonnel [indecipherable] you don\u2019t have a fingerprint and you don\u2019t have a phot -- a\nphotograph, am I right? And yet you have fingerprints from almost all the other people. Was\nthere some significance to that or didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, there -- this was a -- a particular problem, it was -- it was an interesting case. It was --\nwas one of the reasons why we had to go into such detail concerning the personnel data of each\nof the people on the two Treblinka rosters, the one from March 22\" in which -- when Hajda was\nsent to Treblinka one, and the sort of inventory roster of 1944, approximately March 30\" -- 30\",\n1944. Hajda\u2019s personnel file was missing. We didn\u2019t have his personnel file. When we finally --\nwhen our investigator -- our historical investigators, those who could read Russian, finally got\naccess to the records of the Trawniki trained guards in the federal security -- the archive of this\nFederal Security Service of the Russian Federation in the early 90\u2019s, they found the notes of the\nKGB investigator who saw that file, and the notes that he took were consistent with the type of\ninformation that was on other personnel files. So it was clear that there was a personnel file of\nHajda. And later we were able to actually track where that file went. It went with a bunch of\npersonnel files to Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union in 1949. And tragically,\ntragically, this was very frustrating. It was, a-according to the Ukrainian authorities, 1t was\ndestroyed in the spring of 1992. The case was filed in the summer of 1992. So before we made a\nrequest of the Ukrainians, 1t was destroyed, as the Ukrainian says, part of a normal documents\ndestruction process.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: If Iremember correctly.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But there was -- the father\u2019s testimony in itself wouldn\u2019t have been enough. The father used\nlanguage that -- well, I don\u2019t remember exactly what the father said, but the father\u2019s knowledge\nwas a little less direct. He only said that his son was in service with the Germans, or it was some\n-- something vague like that, I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was. The sister, if I remember\ncorrectly, used a ter -- the German term Wachmannschaft, which happened to be the term\ndescribing -- Wachmannschaft was something -- it was the term that described a part of the\nBattalion Streibel. And she used the term Wachmannschaften in Jedrzejow. And Jedrzejow is\ncity in central -- south central Poland, along the vistu -- Vistula River, where the Trawniki men\nwere evacuated in July 1944, in order to press gang forced Polish laborers into building\nfortifications along the vis -- Vistula. You -- you\u2019ll remember from your history that the Red\nArmy was stopped on the Vistula in front of Warsaw, and all up and down the Vistula, the\noffense ran out of steam, and the next offensive didn\u2019t come until January 1945. So these\nTrawniki men had, between July 1944, late July 1944, and the middle of January 1945, they were\non the Vistula River, supervising local forced labor, digging fortifications on the west side of the\nVistula. She knew either -- and I can\u2019t remember now, either she visited him or she got a letter\nfrom him that he was in the Wachmannschaften in Jedrzeyow. Now there was nothing that was\nparticularly horrible about -- yeah, bad things happened there, but it wasn\u2019t like Treblinka. It\nwasn\u2019t like Belzec, it wasn\u2019t like Trawniki. It was a later time that seemed to be no conceivable\nreason for Polish investigators in 1945 -- remember, this was January \u201945, this was before the\nSoviet offensive that liberated Jedrzejow. This family is in -- near Zakopane, on the other side of\nthe Vistula, they\u2019re being interrogated, and here she is saying that he is in the\nWachmannschaften in Jedrzejow. Now he was in a company, but the headquarters of the Streibel\nbattalion was in fact at that time in Jedrzejow. And that was convincing to me as a historian, to\nthe attorneys as prosecutors and ultimately to the expert and to the judge, that in fact, Bronislaw\nHajda was in the Streibel battalion, and gave a tremendous amount of authenticity to our use of\nall of those rosters, because the Streibel bat -- if the Streibel battalion rosters, which contained\nsimilar information to the Treblinka rosters, were valid -- and -- an-and not -- not only in the\nsense of authenticity, but in terms of the accuracy of the information, the accuracy of the\npersonnel data, and the accuracy of where these place -- where these units were stationed, that\ngave greater credibility, because of the names on the Streibel battalion rosters, to the names on\nthe Treblinka rosters. And it gave an e -- extra added push of credibility to the paper. And that\u2019s\nhow paper and witness testimony can corroborate one another, whereas a reasonable person\nmight have questions about either one, but the exact fit, that just wouldn\u2019t happen if you were\nforging.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t forge it that well. You could take a blank personnel form and forge someone\u2019s\nname, birth data. That kind of document you could forge very easily. As I said before, the\nSoviets never sent us one of those. They may have made them but they never sent us one of\nthose. And we tested plenty. But that kind of connection, that this woman, interrogated by Polish\nauthorities in January 1945, while her brother, and the German authorities were still in\nJedrzejow, that she would know Wachmannschaft in Jedrzejow in January 1945, that\u2019s not\nsomething forgers hit -- at that time, could have created. Now, we tested that document, and\nfound it to be a document that did -- our experts found it to be a document that did originate in\n1945, and from Polish authorities.",

        "A: -- of collaboration.

        "A: Yes, I do take a -- a strong professional and personal satisfaction in having worked at OSI. I\nlearned a lot at OSI. I learned through, as I said when I -- at my good-bye dinner, and -- and there\nmay have been some surprised to hear it, I said that working with the attorneys over that many\nyears had taught me how to be a better historian. And certainly the need to prove things from\nscratch had taught me how to question assumptions that we so easily take for granted, that may\nor may not be based on actual evidence. And to really look at the evidence, and draw one\u2019s\nconclusion from the primary source evidence. To give you an example of that, it\u2019s common\nknowledge -- and I put that in quotations, that the Nazis like to give their auxiliaries alcohol\nbefore sending them out on a mission. Everybody says that, and in fact, witnesses talk about\nauxiliaries being drunk while they were shooting. But, in all the hundreds of statements of\nTrawniki men that I read, and in all the documents of Trawniki -- relating to Trawniki trained\nguards, there\u2019s nothing about issuing of alcohol rations prior to an operation. And in fact, when\nyou think of it, it makes no sense. You don\u2019t give men whom you\u2019re going to put rifles in their\nhands, and whom you may not entirely trust, alcohol to drink, for fear of nothing else that they\u2019 II\nshoot each other, or they\u2019! shoot you instead of the people they\u2019re supposed to shoot. But why\nwere -- why did witne -- were witnesses wrong when they saw some of them drunk? No, not in\nthe cases of the Trawniki men, because of during the shooting and during deportations, the\nTrawniki were constantly extorting on their own whatever valuables, whether it be cash or booze\nthat the victims had. Sometimes it was cash and they turned it into booze, so that some of the\nauxiliaries did have booze, and did partake of booze prior to a operation, and that\u2019s -- so what the\nwitnesses saw, what the survivors saw, what they perceived to have seen was not entirely\ninaccurate. But the assumption that was drawn, that everybody just kind of believed, was\ninaccurate.",

        "Q: Peter, at the end of the last tape you were describing your sense of service to the OSI.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, I wanted to continue 1-1n terms of professionally satisfying, it was professionally\nsatisfying cause of reasons that I had discussed, in terms of learning how to become a better\nhistorian, in terms of getting access to records that might not have thought, or been able to get\naccess to had I not been with the Justice Department. Becoming interested in areas such as the\nauxiliary police, and Poland, and the Trawniki trained guards that might not have come across\nmy radar screen as serious interests had I not been at OSI. The a-ability to put these pieces\ntogether in -- in original formulations. Subjects that nobody had written about because there was\nno public evidence available for people to construct a thesis on. This was all professionally very\nsatisfying as a historian, I think prepared me in many ways, broadened me in many, many ways,\nthat made me perhaps better pra -- prepared to take over the position of the senior historian at the\nHolocaust Memorial Museum. Personally, I find it very satisfying because as a federal civil\nservant I felt that I was doing a service to the American people in the sense that, having grown\nup in the Vietnam generation, I was contributing to a process where individuals who committed\ncrimes during wartime, with all the excuses that one has to commit acts of atrocity during\nwartime, were being called to account, despite the fact that they were small fry. Despite the fact\nthat in some cases they were compelled to be in the positions where they eventually committed\ntheir crimes. Despite the fact that decades and decades had passed, and that there was some\nreason for them to feel that this would never come back to haunt them. That this was a process, a\njudicial process, a fair process by which people who had committed crimes could be called to\naccount. And if there is a potential for that in the future, conceivably the perpetrators of the\nfuture might stop to think twice before perpetrating crimes along the lines of these crimes that\nwere perpetrated during the second World War. And if that potential of legal consequence even\nworks to prevent one killing, I feel that it would be worth that effort, both for the future in terms\nof prevention, and in terms of bringing closure to the past.",

After all, denaturalization, deportation\nis a certain form of punishment, but --",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we shouldn\u2019t go back to these things. I feel, in a sense, that a certain degree of justice has\nbeen done, not only to the victims of these perpetrators, but also in the process of immigration as\nan American , these people, by posing as displaced persons took a slot that might have gone to a\nperson who was really in need, who was not fleeing prosecution, as opposed to persecution -- or\nwho was fleeing prosecution, excuse me, rather than persecution.

        "A: I -- | -- I think that efforts to represent a judicial process as a history of the events that are\nrelevant to the crime is a mistake, although it\u2019s one commonly made. I certainly came to OSI, or\nthe SLU at that time with the excitement of being able to write history and convey history to a\nbroader public, to historians, but also to a broader public through the legal process, and I\u2019ve\ncome to realize that a legal proceeding is just that, it has a specific purpose, and that is to\nascertain a violation or a crime, a civil case violation and criminal case a crime, to ascertain a\ndefendant, to assign or determine what the responsibility of the defendant is, and to determine an\nappropriate punishment for the crime. I think as a result of that, or at least as a result of an\ninvestigation, a part of the historical record, whether it\u2019s through witness testimony, perpetrator\nor survivor, or through documentation that otherwise would not have been uncovered, or would\nnot have been uncovered as quickly, can push forward a broader but different process of trying to\nunderstand and analyze what happened. I think a trial deals with an individual, or in rare cases a\nsmall group of individuals, to determine their responsibility for very specific events, and to\nunderstand a broader historical process requires a different process. And to expect the justice\nsystem to fulfill that latter purpose, to understand why things happened on a deeper level, those\nwho expect that are going to be disappointed by the judicial process because they\u2019re putting too\nmuch on it, that this is a subject of a broader and more intensive inquiry.",
        "Q: But suppose I would say to you, most of the guilty never get tried, for-forgetting maybe in\nmost crimes, but in this particular kind of crime, in war crimes, they don\u2019t get tried.

We still have had\nRwanda and Cambodia and Bosnia and Sierra Leone, and -- and on and on and on, it doesn\u2019t --\nso what --",
        "A: There\u2019s obviously no guarantee. I don\u2019t think the argument that most of the guilty don\u2019t get\ntried is any reason not to try the ones a-a-and obtain convictions against the ones who you can\ntry. Because one couldn\u2019t try Al Capone for murder, didn\u2019t mean it was a bad thing to try him for\ntax evasion. And I think it\u2019s very important to set a standard, a fair standard for prosecuting, a-a-\nand in this sense, war crimes like this -- or I hate to call the -- I -- P'Il call them Nazi offenses\nrather than war crimes, are not different from other criminal acts in terms of the need to establish\na consistent and fair process to try these individuals and judge them, and if found guilty, and the\n-- the innocent -- the -- the acquittals are as important as the guilty verdicts for the survival of the\nsystem and for an expectation that the system will be fair, that this is an important process. It has\nalready, to a certain degree, the idea of trying people for crimes committed in other countries,\ndecades after the event, 1s catching on. Pinochet is -- is an example, it\u2019s an interesting example.\nAnd again, if this becomes a habit of political behavior and a legal response to regimes that\nviolate human rights, this might make the world a better place. And because there\u2019s no guarantee\nthat the world will be a better place, doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t stop trying.",
        "Q: And hence, are you in favor of an international criminal court, rather than having sp-sp-Spain\nand England saying, we\u2019re going to -- your -- your -- we\u2019re going to extradite you, whoever you\nare, whether it\u2019s Pinochet or it\u2019s somebody else, that it --",
        "A: It -- it would be great if there were an international criminal court that could review all of\nthese cases. I think when that fails, one should use the systems that one has in process. It would\nhave been great if the United States could have tried these criminals as criminals --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- under criminal proceedings. But the chances, because of the way our Constitution 1s\nwritten, because of Constitutional precedent, because of real concerns about expos facto\nprosecutions, about jurisdiction, the chances that a criminal trial of these individuals could have\ntaken place in the United States may have ended up as an excuse for doing nothing. What was\nthere was immigration legislation, and a -- a -- a legal response to violations of immigration\nlegislation that did ultimately provide a framework in which perpetrators of Nazi offenses could\nbe uncovered, tried in a process that allowed for extensive appeals, a-available to any immigrant\nand could ultimately have a process where they would be removed from the United States\nbecause as Nazi offenders, they were ineligible to enter at the time they entered.",
        "Q: Wou -- would you if you -- if you could advocate, would you advocate that the United States\nsign the international tribunal agreement that other countries have signed? Would you think that\nthat was -- or are you not sure?",
        "A: Pm not -- I -- I would prefer to have an international criminal tribunal. I\u2019m not sure at this\npoint that such a one would be any freer of the international and political pressures that a\nnational tribunal is subject to. And I\u2019m not certain as well that the precedents are strong enough\nyet for an international criminal tribunal to really have teeth, the way a national tribunal --\nPinochet will probably -- if he is ever punished, will probably receive perhaps a more appropriate\npunishment in Chile, more than anywhere else.",
        "Q: Well, but one is not in conflict with the other because if the country wishes to prosecute\nsomeone like they\u2019re doing in Chile, then the international court would not come into play. Isn\u2019t\n-- isn\u2019t the idea if the national country is will to do it --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- then it\u2019s hands off for the international tri -- in terms of what has been written so far.",
        "A: Yes, but keep in mind that the Chileans were not ready --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to enter this process until the Spaniards requested -- started the process by -- by using an\nestablished procedure, Spanish citizens were killed by Pinochet.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: The Spaniards -- if you interpret that law, 1-1f you interpret that yo-you -- that murder against\none citizen, that a country has a right to protect its own citizens --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that a nation can try someone, even the head of a foreign state that kills its citizens illegally.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And in a sense the Spaniards used what was existing legislation. Never been tried before, but\nit was existing criminal legislation to make an extradition request that set off a chain of events\nthat ultimately, without an international court, has led to an investigation in Chile that might --\nmight end in an indictment. And even if Pinochet isn\u2019t punished, in my mind the fact that there is\nsuch an investigation for these events, a generation later, is an important thing. It wouldn\u2019t have\nhappened a generation ago.",
        "Q: Okay, then I want to ask you, the -- the other side of the question. Some countries like South\nAfrica have decided to have a truth and reconciliation commission, and I -- I am one of those\npeople who think of apartheid as a form of genocide. It\u2019s not physical genocide in the sense of\nthe Nazis, but it -- it is a form of a murder of a cultural and psychological and -- and in some\ncases, real murder. But the country decided rather than going and setting up trials, that they\nwould ask people to talk the truth, and seek amnesty if it wa -- and not everybody\u2019s going to get\nit who is speaking the truth, if they don\u2019t speak enough truth.",
        "A: Or if the truth they speak is the zi -- is Just too --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] is not -- is not -- right. Now it\u2019s in-in-interesting thing to think about, does a\njustice system, a legal system give one truth in the same way that a truth and recons -- and they\ndon\u2019t call it truth and justice, they call it a truth and reconciliation system commission, because\nthey\u2019re trying to do something more to the society than what a legal system can do. So what do\nyou think about that?",
        "A: You know, I -- 1 -- 1 -- it\u2019s not clear what the effects of the South African experiment will be\nin terms of healing the society. It\u2019s not clear whether, for instance, a truth and reconciliation\nprocess would heal those in Argentina now, who are calling for justice for their disappeared\nrelatives 20 years after the event. On the other hand, given the problems that individual nations\nhave had policing themselves, I wouldn\u2019t exclude it as an alternative method of trying to bring\nsome closure where the society is not prepared to adjudicate it through existing criminal\nprocedures, or where the absence of existing criminal procedures to handle cases like that\nprecludes efforts to actually adjudicate or to prosecute wrongdoers by their peers, who may have\nbeen their former allies or compatriots. It\u2019s an interesting experien -- experiment, and I think it\u2019s\ntoo early to tell if -- I think we need -- we\u2019re going to need another 10 or 20 years to see what the\neffects of it are, because if you keep in mind that not everybody who\u2019s morally responsible is\nlegally --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- responsible enough to obtain a conviction.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Whereas the truth and reconciliation process might offer the opportunity to bring some of the\nmoral responsibility out into the open. Might. But it\u2019s too early to -- I\u2019d have to reserve judgment\non that. I think it\u2019s an interesting experien -- e-experiment, particularly if a society is not ready to\nhand down indictments.",
        "Q: What do you think the effect of the Nuremberg trials are? We\u2019re 55 years later. Do we know\nthat?",
        "A: I think the effect of the Nuremberg trials has been positive, even 55 years later, and I\u2019m\nlooking at two issues. Not only the post-Nuremberg Nazi offender trials, whatever country they\nmight be in, that still go to this day, and that will go until the last perpetrator dies. But also if you\nlook at the Gulf War, it\u2019s really difficult for a nation to attack its neighbor, and annex it any\nmore, without provoking some sort of international reaction. And I suspect that that -- the ability\nto actually fight a war, whether we agree with American intervention or not, to reverse the Iraqi\noccupation and annexation of Kuwait was something that would not necessarily have been\npossible or easy prior to 1945.",
        "Q: But if there weren\u2019t oil, would we have done it? We don\u2019t do it in Africa.",
        "A: Has it -- has it --",
        "Q: We don\u2019t do it in the Congo.",
        "A: Has it really happened where one country has simply annexed another?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The way Iraq annexed Kuwait? I mean, it\u2019s true, the oil -- the oil heightened interest and atten\n-- and attention, there\u2019s no question about that. But the response, the capacity to respond as a\nUnited Nations, rather than just one country defending its interests, defending its economic\ninterests, the capacity to respond as a United Nations seemed much more difficult as it was,\nmuch more realizable than the League of Nations capacity to respond to Nazi aggression.",
        "Q: But Peter, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s go back to Bosnia for a moment. Even if one doesn\u2019t think that Bosnia\ndeclaring itself a state and croa -- Croatia declaring itself a state, the -- the western world,\nanyway, accepted their dec-declaration of independence. And then Milosevic and the Serbs, and\nthe Bosni -- they attack. We don\u2019t do anything for four years, four and a half years. Nothing.",
        "A: I think it --",
        "Q: So the --",
        "A: I think because this was the disintegration of a state in a civil war, the issues were much more\nmurky than they were in the case of Iraq and Kuwait. I don\u2019t think it was only oil. I think the\ninternational issue was much more murky, and the United States and other powers were\nuncertain as to whether there was still a Yugoslavia or whether these new states emerging from\nthe break-up of Yugoslavia were legitimate states. The first --",
        "Q: But we accepted that, right?",
        "A: The first nation to accept them --",
        "Q: Germany.",
        "A: -- was Germany, but Germany had other than humanitarian reasons to do that.",
        "Q: Well --",
        "A: Germany was following a traditional pro-Croatian policy.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s more similar to the response of had the British or the French recognized the\nconfederate states of America, which after all, declared their independence of the union, and\ndetermined to defend itself --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- against the central government that was seeking to essentially destroy that confederate\nnation and reunite it with the United States. Britain and France -- the situation was at that time\nalso very murky. But there was no Nuremberg at that time.",
        "Q: Right. But you know it better than I do, that the world we live in now is probably going to be\nvery easy to declare that\u2019s a civil war, that\u2019s a civil war, that\u2019s a civil war. This is not like\nKuwait, this is not like Germany marching into Poland. I want to say Austria. S -- and so\nconsequently, the murkiness gets built into a decision not to do anything. It helps -- it -- 1t helps\nto say it\u2019s murky, when if you actually look at the situation, why shouldn\u2019t one go into certain\nso-called civil wars? Do you know what I mean? I think if -- I think that the term is used as an --\nas an excuse not to do something.",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t think that Nuremberg, that the Nuremberg trials really provides much of a precedent\nof what to do with a nation that is breaking up. The nur -- the international military tribunal was\nestablished to deal with a nation that planned and conceived and waged an aggressive war --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- against other nations. You\u2019ve really got to look at this as -- as a progression. Prior to World\nWar II there was no international apparatus to deal with that. After World War II, with -- with all\nits ineffectiveness, we do now have a United Nations which is going to respond when one\ncountry attacks another. Now, the next step is what do when a country disintegrates, or when one\nminority in a country starts butchering another minority in a country. That\u2019s something that\nperhaps the development of an international court, and the devel -- certainly the development of\nmore cohesive international reaction. Certainly the development of a quicker response in terms\nof providing shelter for refugees, which is something we ought to have learned from the last\nworld war. That all of these initiatives are going to have to come into play in the future. Whether\nwe'll be able to prevent all killings, we as human beings, I\u2019m not talking about we as the United\nStates, but we as citizens of the world, will be able to prevent killings is something no one\u2019s\ngoing to be able to guarantee. But to work towards mitigating killings, to work towards\nproviding sanctuary -- speedy sanctuary for people who might be the victims of killings, and that\n-- that is something that we certainly could have done more quickly in Rwanda at least, and quite\nprobably in Yugoslavia as well. But there -- each situation is different, and we, as citizens of the\nworld again, not just we the United States, or we the west, we as citizens of the world are going\nto have to work towards strategies for dealing with internal disturbances, internal civil wars,\ninternal persecution, in a way that is effective.",
        "Q: I mean, when you mentioned Rwanda, that becomes even more complicated. It\u2019s not just that\nthere was a genocide in the country, then the genocidiers leave and go to the Congo and become",
        "A: And spilled into another country.",
        "Q: -- helped by Novato, and then Rwanda supports Cabilla going in and then bi -- Cabilla\nbecomes who he is. And now you have incursions back and forth, so it\u2019s no longer a so-called\ncivil war.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: No.",

This is\nsomething that we now have to deal with in the 21\u2018 century and we now have to develop a\nmeans of preventing, if possible, mitigating if possible, and -- and ultimately adjudicating if\npossible, in a way that is credible to the -- the victims, and credible 1-1f you understand what I\nmean, to the perpetrators as well.",

I\u2019d taught a\ncourse on early modern European history, and I was scheduled to teach a course on World War IT\nand on eastern Europe at Columbia when I was called by a representative of the U.S. attorney\u2019s\noffice in New York, and asked whether I would be interested in working for a short term period,\ngathering evidence for a case against a Nazi offender. In this particular case it was a Latvian\nauxiliary policeman named Boleslaus Maikovskis, who -- whose case had been publicized on\n\u201c60 Minutes\u201d some six months earlier, in the spring of 1978. So I was not only aware of the case,\nI was also -- I was also interested in the work, and should -- little anecdote that goes with that\ncall, at the time I received the call, I was working in a fairly dead end job putting data onto\ncomputer sheets on the other side of the justice department\u2019s suit against the telephone company\nat that time, the AT & T, which was the telephone company at that time. And it was a pretty\ndead-end job and I was home sick, suffering from a kidney stone, and about ready to go to the\nhospital when the call came in. And I had been feeling very sorry for myself, and thinking idly\nthat it was too bad that I was too young to have been around at the time of the Nuremberg Trials.\nSo it was almost like a stroke of a -- a divine stroke that that call came in at that time, and when\nasked if I was interested in working on such a project, I said, just let me pass the kidney stone,\nPll be right in for an interview.",

He went on to post-war studies in Communism. And that was the focus at\nColumbia University, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t -- there wasn\u2019t a generation of\nscholars, not studying the Holocaust per se, because that was still very much a political term, and\nnot the term of [indecipherable] for this period as yet, certainly not in academic parlance.

        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t -- they didn't really know what to ask me to do. They asked me to find\nevidence about this case, and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what they wanted me to do either, so I did --\nwhat I did know how to do was go to then -- go to the published records, the Nuremberg trial\nrecords, and put together, I think it was about a 10 or a 15 or 20 page essay on the Latvian\nauxiliary police in -- in -- under German occupation in 1941. Maikovskis was accused of having\nbeen a precinct chief in an eastern region of Latvia, around Rezekne, Rossitten in German. And\nhe had been accused of participating in killings of local Jews in the summer and autumn of 1941.\nAnd I went to some of the basic sources, there\u2019s a lengthy Nuremberg document which was\nwritten by the commander of the security police, in SD in the Baltic States, the former\nEinsatzgruppen chief, Walter Stahlecker, which was a lengthy report of about, oh, 250 pages\ndealing with the German occupation of the Baltic States and the operations of the police, in\nparticular the auxiliary police. We also had in New York, copies of the Einsatzgruppen reports,\nwhich were on microfilm at the time, and I reviewed those and gathered the material that were\nrelevant to Latvian auxiliary police killings of Jews and others in Latvia in the summer of 1941,\nand I put it together in a basic historical essay that I would write as a college paper at that time.\nThis was before I had the PhD., and in fact it was at the time when I was writing the PhD.",
        "A: And the attorney was pleasantly surprised, and particularly by the speed in which it was\ngathered. It wasn\u2019t such a big thing to a historian, but it was obviously something that was very\nhelpful to the attorney. And the reason for that was that the case had run into a snag. The original\nallegations had come from witnesses, primarily Israeli witnesses, who had Maikovskis little --\nliterally in every location in Latvia, killing people. And the U.S. attorneys had gone over to\nLatvia to take depositions of former Soviet -- Soviet Latvian citizens who had been Maikovskis\u2019s\ncomrades, and who placed Maikovskis solely in one area of Latvia, in southeastern Latvia by\nRezekne. And the judge in the case was extremely hostile to the idea of deporting someone for\nNazi offenses. Not -- and th-th-there\u2019s no reason to believe that he was sympathetic to the Nazis,\nhe just didn\u2019t like the idea of throwing someone out of the United States on the basis of old\nevidence and evidence that had came in part from the Soviet Union. And the judges hostility\nmade it difficult for the attorneys to use the witness evidence, which, as it turned out, was a good\nthing for the Maikovskis case because the government eventually withdrew the charges against\nMaikovskis in the complaint, in -- in the order to show cause, Maikovskis was a alien, he wasn\u2019t\na citizen. The -- the charges that placed Maikovskis anywhere outside of Rezekne were\nwithdrawn, and the case then focused solely on what was going on in Rezekne. And with a\ncombination of documents in U.S. archives, which gave the general picture of what was going on\nin the Soviet -- in -- in -- in German occupied Latvia, in that region, and the statements, the\ndepositions, complete with cross examination of Soviet witnesses -- that is Soviet citizens who\nhad been comrades of Maikovskis, who described from their eyewitness point of view what had\nhappened, enabled us to secure Maikovskis\u2019s order of deportation. If I remember correctly, we\nlost -- the judge was hostile enough to rule against us, but we won on appeal, at the board of\nimmigration appeals. And Maikovskis eventually fled to West Germany before he was actually\ndeported.",

        "A: -- in -- in Germany, but the proceedings in the United States are all civil cases, and there --\nthey\u2019re of two types. There\u2019s a denaturalization, if the individual is a U.S. citizen, there\u2019s a\ndenaturalization process, and -- and the equivalent of the indictment is called a complaint. The\ngovernment makes a complaint, and the government ts the plaintiff, and the defendant is the\nperson against whom the -- in this case the Nazi offender. If the individual is a -- just a\npermanent resident, is -- is an alien, then it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an order to show cause for deportation.",
        "A: The complaint is filed in the U.S. District Court, because the U.S. District Court has the\nauthority to confer and revoke citizenship. And the -- the order to show cause is filed in\nimmigration court, because it becomes a immigration and naturaliz -- I-Immigration and\nNaturalization Service matter for non-citizens.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely. And -- and there -- a --a citizen has different rights than an alien, obviously.\nAnd there\u2019s a procedure -- 1-in terms of a citizen, we -- we, that is the OSI had to go through a\nprocess of denaturalization, and then the whole set of appeals and then deportation. After the\ndenaturalization, appeals had been exhausted. If a person had been denaturalized, and the appeals\nwere exhausted, and those appeals could go all the way up to the Supreme Court, then the\nprocess would start again, because the person was now an alien.",
        "A: The process would start again in immigration court, and go through that series of appeals,\nwhich could again go up to the Supreme Court before someone was actually deported or\nremoved from the country.",
        "A: I think there were a lot of factors involved in that. One clearly was, unlike the -- the Great\nBritain, which decided to go the criminal route, the Australians and the brit -- and the Canadians\nalso decided, with total lack of success, to go the criminal proceedings route. The United States\nhad a Constitution of 200 years, and to create a criminal jurisdiction for trying these cases in the\nUnited States, under criminal procedures would -- was, as I understand it, possible, but would\nhave involved considerable difficulty, and considerable delay in setting up the apparatus. It also\nwould have held the government to an extremely strict standard, as it did in the cases of\nAustralia, Great Britain and Canada, of proving potentially, an individual case of murder. The --\non the other hand, the immigration procedures were in place, and had been in place, particularly\nsince many of the offenders had come in under the Displaced Persons Act, and the Refugee\nRelief Act of the -- the -- the legislation that was extant in the late 40\u2019s and early 50\u2019s. And there\nwas legislation on the books already that if these applicants for immigration, and later for\nnaturalization gave willful, false statements about their past, that they could be denaturalized,\nand ultimately deported. They would return to their pre-immigration status. That 1s, as an alien,\nwhich now the truth was known, was ineligible to enter the United States. And an ineligible alien\nface -- who is in the United States, faces deportation. U.S. immigration law, sometimes for many\nof the wrong reasons, is extremely harsh, and does not make many exceptions. And it was\nevidently decided -- this is not first-hand knowledge of -- of mine, it was evidently decided that\nthis would be an appropriate process to deal with the issue of Nazi offenders living in the United\nStates. It was hoped, I think initially, that for many of these individuals, that the nations where\nthey had committed their offenses, would request their extradition. And in fact, there was some\nprecedent for that. There was an outstanding request on the part of the former Yugoslav\ngovernment, for the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich, since the early\n50\u2019s. And in 1972, the West German government requested and obtained the extradition of a\nLong Island housewife named Hermine Braunsteiner-Ryan, who had been a camp guard at the\nLublin Majdanek concentration camp, and who had evaded justice afterwards, married an\nAmerican serviceman, and had come over to live in the United States, and who was sort of the\nepitome of the quiet neighbor that Allan Ryan tried to reflect in the title of his book in 1983.",
        "A: So there\u2019s some precedent for the idea that the nations on whose soil these individuals had\ncommitted their crimes, would want these people back in order to try them. And of course, we\nfound -- we, that is the United States government, found very quickly that most of these nations,\nregardless of whether they made bellicose statements about dealing with Nazi offenders, were\nnot terribly excited about having them back, and this is something that we found out quite\nquickly in the Trifa case, where the Romanians really had no interest in having Valerian at the\ntime, Viarel Trifa back to Romania to try him for anything. The Soviet Union was often prepared\nto take people back in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, but the United States government was not prepared\nat that time to send individuals back to the Soviet Union.",
        "A: Yeah, the opportunity to escape was quite available to anyone, particularly to citizens. There\nwas no authority to the uni -- for the United States government to imprison a citizen of the\nUnited States during a denaturalization proceeding. The immigration and naturalization service\ncan imprison an individual who is about to be ordered deported, and of whom it can be surmised\nthat he will se -- seek to flee to avoid deportation. The INS can put someone in the slammer for\nthat. But the United States government did not have the authority to imprison an individual who\nfaced denaturalization proceedings.",
        "A: And so those individuals could leave, in fact, with their citizenship, and the worst they faced\nwas a in absentia denaturalization proceeding.",
        "A: We would continue the proceedings --",
        "A: -- to denaturalize, regardless of whether the individual was in the United States, because it\nwas our intention that in the cases of those who fled, they were ineligible to enter the United\nStates, and denaturalization would render them, now under the Holzman amendment, ineligible\nto ever return --",
        "A: -- to the United States.",
        "A: Often there was a defense attorney, yes.",
        "A: Often there was a di -- an attorney representing the interests of the defendant, who sometimes\nstill had property in the United States.",
        "A: Holzman amendment is passed, if I\u2019m correct -- if I\u2019m correct, it was passed in -- by Congress\nin 1978, and ratified in 1980. So it became effective in 1980. It really goes back to United States\nimmigration policy at the end of World War II. The United States clearly saw that it had been\nremiss -- the United States government at the time, and -- and -- and this was backed by popular\nsupport, that it had been remiss in granting sanctuary to refugees prior to World War II, and there\nwas a concerted effort to provide special immigration legislation for refugees after World War II,\nthat would exceed the narrowly restricted quotas which developed out of the 1924 Immigration\nand Naturalization Act. And the first of these special -- first of two -- actually three special laws,\nwas the Displaced Persons Act, which was passed in 1948, and took effect from 1948 until the\nlast day of 1952. And it created a separate category, over and above the quotas, of displaced\npersons who were eligible beyond the quotas to receive visas to immigrate to the United States.\nAnd if memory serves me correct, some 400,000 people -- I think just under 400,000 people\nimmigrated to the United States under the Displaced Persons Act from various countries in\nEurope. There were -- the Displaced Persons Act also provided for the establishment of a DP\ncommission, which operated in Europe and administered displaced person\u2019s camps to provide\nsanctuary for survivors of the Holocaust, refugees from Communist takeovers in eastern Europe,\nand displaced persons uprooted by the Nazis during their occupation of eastern Europe who\ncould -- could not, or would not be repatriated, to give them a place where they could find shelter\nand food, and in the case of kids, find some education and training, while they awaited the\ncompletion of the application process for a visa. When the Displaced Persons Act expired, the\nU.S. Congress, and again, backed by considerable public support, and this was -- keep in mind\nthis was the time of the McCarthy era, despite the concerns with Communism, a refugee relief\nact was passed, which permitted further refugees, some of those who were ineligible under the\nDisplaced Persons Act, to come to the United States on special visas that went over and beyond\nthe numbers and the quotas. And these visas, the last big blup of visas, came in December 1956,\nand spilled over to January 1957 to accommodate the refugees from Hungary, from the\nHungarian revolution of 1956. Now each of these decrees, each of these laws, as well as a 1945\nregulation, if I remember correctly, there were increasingly less strict restrictions on eligibility to\nthose who were either German, or received some benefit from the Nazi regime, or had\ncollaborated with the Nazi regime. There was a regulation -- a -- a State Department regulation\nalready in 1945, barring Nazi collaborators from coming into the United States. The Displaced\nPersons Act had fairly stringent restrictions on Nazi collaborators, those who assisted in\npersecution on the basis of race, religion and national origin, from entering the United States.\nThe Refugee Relief Act also had similar, except somewhat vaguer language, but still had\nlanguage that excluded persons who personally participated in persecution from entering the\nUnited States. Now, initially, as an example of how the legislation was relaxed in this aspect 1s\nthe following; under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, SS membership rendered one ineligible\nfrom entering the United States, regardless of what you had done in the SS -- what -- what an\nindividual had done as a member of the SS. Membership in the SS alone, was enough to exclude\nfrom the United States. In -- under the amendment of 1950, which mems -- mere membership in\nthe SS was no longer sufficient to exclude. One had to, as a member of the SS, have participated\nin persecution. The amendment in 1950 also allowed for nationals of, for instance, the Baltic\nStates to enter as displaced persons, even if they had served in collaborative units, like the\nLatvian legion of the Waffen SS. Latvians could come before, through the Displaced Persons\nAct, but they can -- could not have been affiliated with Nazi organizations. Under the DP Act as\namended, they were now no longer ineligible.",
        "A: But their membership -- they did -- they were required to tell the truth --",
        "A: -- about the membership, so as not to cut off an avenue of inquiry about their activities. So in\nother words it -- it remained against the law for a Latvian who had been a member of the Waffen\nSS to say that he was a bookkeeper during the war, when in fact he\u2019d been a member of the\nWaffen SS, even if it had -- it w -- would later have been found that he had done nothing more\nthan been a combat soldier. If he had admitted under the DP Act as amended that he was a\nWaffen SS combat soldier, and nothing more could be found against him, then he was eligible to\nenter the United States. But having concealed that information, that was already concealing,\nomitting, giving false statement, to obtain a federal benefit, which --",
        "A: -- brought a whole other exclusionary process to bear.",
        "A: I-I\u2019m sure there were many factors involved. The one that comes to mind is that there was a --\na shortage of agricultural labor in the United States, and a lot of the east European refugees from\nCommunism were farmers, and farmer\u2019s sons. And the -- and al -- and many of them were also\nethnic Germans from eastern Europe. And I have no doubt that the idea of providing sanctuary to\nindividuals who were escaping Communist regimes was a significant factor in amending the\nDisplaced Persons Act. There was also a feeling even at the time that for those who served in\ncombat units that were affiliated with Nazi Germany, that particularly for Ukrainians, for\nmembers of the Baltic states, whose annexation by the Soviet Union the United States never\nrecognized, that these people had had very bad choices, and that the one that they chose was only\nmarginally less worse than the -- the other that was available to them. And so I think 1 -- th -- a\ncombination of factors led to the amendment of the Displaced Persons Act, and also led to the --\nthe slight differences in the Refugee Relief Act.",
        "A: After -- after the Refugee Relief Act expired, at the end of -- in 1952, and a new Immigration\nand Naturalization Act had been passed, which was slightly less restrictive, and here I\u2019m -- here\nI\u2019m speaking off the top of my head -- slightly less restrictive than the \u201824 act, but it was a quota\nact again. And that came back into force, and remained in force until 1986 or \u201996, the new\nimmigration act -- the new immigration act, I think it was 1996, replaced the \u201952 act. Under these\nacts, all of these acts, the \u00b052 act in particular, but also the other special immigration legislation,\nthat an individual who was ordered deported, could apply for what was called discretionary\nrelief, for a number of reasons, whether they\u2019ve been a good citizen, and they were -- when they\n-- while they lived in the United States, if their wi -- were married to U.S. citizens, if they had\nchildren who were U.S. citizens, if they had close relatives who were dependent on them who\nwere U.S. citizens. And another very important and applicable one in these cases, if by\ndeportation to the country from whence they came, they would be subjected to political\npersecution. And this was a particularly applicable part of the statute for the Communist regimes,\nand was applied in the case of the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich who\ncame in the -- into the United States under a false name, was clearly involved in persecution. He\ncame even before the DP act, he came under the 1924 act, I believe. And he was actually ordered\ndeported in 1953 at the conclusion of a proceeding, but the order of deportation was stayed\nbecause he was successfully able to argue that he would be persecuted in a Communist\nYugoslavia, and would not get a fair trial. And this very much stems from the -- the -- the Cold\nWar atmosphere of the time, and this was an atmosphere that continued affecting the few cases\nthat actually were prosecuted, or were litigated during the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s, until the Vietnam era.",
        "A: The Holzman Amendment, which was passed in 1978 radically changed this in that for\npersons who participated in persecution on the basis of race, religion, national origin and\npolitical opinion, they added political opinion under Holzman, under the aegis of Nazi Germany\nor its allies, or in territories occupied by Nazi Germany between January 30\", 1933, and May\neighth, 1945, if found to be deportable, if found to be ineligible to enter the United States, could\nnot apply for discretionary relief on any basis. And so this there -- this therefore opened the door\nfor an actual result to these cases, you didn\u2019t have to go through the litigation only to find that\nthe individual could apply for and get discretionary relief, either because his children were U.S.\ncitizens, or because he could claim political persecution from a Communist country. Now, did it\nmean that we were -- we, the U.S. government were willing to deport these people just to any\ncountry, as a practice? Not yet, but at least legally the possibility was there to obtain an order of\ndeportation and actually carry it out.",
        "A: Again, I think it was a combination of factors. Clearly important was the precedent of the\nBraunsteiner-Ryan case in 1972, which sparked questions about how many other Nazi criminals\nwere living in our midst, so to speak. And that created a certain degree of public pressure, in part\nfrom Jewish groups, and survivor groups, which unlike 1945 - 1950, where they were\nimmigrants with no -- no confidence to say what they wanted, and no strong desire to relive the\nimmediate past as opposed to dealing with creating a new life and a future, were now established\nU.S. citizens, quite conscious and aware of their rights to lobby congressmen, to get some results\non this. A second key factor was the development of a -- the process of d\u00e9tente between the\nUnited States and the Soviet Union. The year that Braunsteiner-Ryan was extradited, 1972, was\nalso the year that President Nixon visited Moscow and ushered in the era of d\u00e9tente, which lasted\nmore or less until the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. This was also a time at which we in the\nUnited States, and to a greater degree, prosecutors in West Germany were beginning to see\nglimpses of the types of usable evidence, credible evidence that existed behind the iron curtain.\nIn the 50\u2019s this stuff just was not available in any way. In the 60\u2019s, particularly in the early 60\u2019s,\ntrickles of documentary material captured by the Red army, came into the public domain through\nwest German trials, and also through Soviet propaganda pamphlets in the late 60\u2019s and early\n70\u2019s, denouncing the western powers for harboring Nazi criminals. Now the pamphlets were --\nwere -- were nonsense, and -- and often many of the statements in the pamphlets were nonsense,\nas well as the interpretations. But the documents that were photocopied, if genuine, and one\ncouldn\u2019t tell if they were genuine unless they subjected -- subjected them to careful forensic\ntesting, were not only interesting in themselves, but fascinating as examples of the type of\nmaterial that had survived the war, and that was in Soviet hands. One of the key driving forces\nbehind the office of special investigation\u2019s success, was an early agreement 1n 1980 with the\nSoviet Union to take videotaped depositions from Soviet citizens, all of whom were comrades of\nthe defendants in the United States, and of whom, while it might be questioned what kinds of\npressures they were in the Soviet Union, it couldn\u2019t be questioned that they knew the defendants\ninvolved, whereas with the survivor witnesses, defense attorneys could raise questions as to how\nthey could possibly know that this was the man who did this, that and the other thing. The\ncomrades who worked with them on a daily basis, and who may have known them from their\nhometowns couldn\u2019t be questioned. They -- their knowledge of the defendants as members of\nthese units was much more credible, even if it was coming from behind the Iron Curtain. We also\nwere unable at that time to get unrestricted access to Soviet records, but we were able to get\naccess to copies of documentation, at least pertaining to our defendants at that time, and in\nresponse to the general objection of the defense that these documents were always forged by the\nSoviet Union, the Soviet authorities quickly understood that in order for the United States\ngovernment to be credible, that they would have to fork over the originals. And this started\nalready in 1980 - 1981, where the Soviet authorities would have the original document sent to\nthe Soviet embassy or Soviet consulate, depending on where the trial was taking place, in the\nUnited States, where the document could then be examined by the government\u2019s forensics\nexaminers for handwriting, for paper, for typing quality, for signatures. And also by teams hired\nby the defense. And at no time did the Soviets ever represent to OSI that a document was\ngenuine when it was not genuine.",
        "A: Never. Never. In some of their pamphlet literature, they would leave things out, but when we\n-- when we in the United States government asked where\u2019s the beef, the Soviet Union always\nprovided the beef.",
        "A: A basic --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s a little too general. It\u2019s not simply willful misrepresentation. It 1 -- it\u2019s actually material\nmisrepresentation, and the materiality must go to the fact that had the information been known, it\nwould or might have led to an investigation that would or might have uncovered facts that would\nhave re -- rendered the defendant ineligible. So in other words, there had to be some basis that\nwould render the individual ineligible beyond the simple fact of lying.",
        "A: Beyond the simple fact of --",
        "A: Yes. And in the Nazi offender cases, that involved participation and persecution on the basis\nof race, religion, national origin or political opinion. Now that -- that -- that\u2019s how the\nimmigration statute read, and that -- the natu -- the natural -- denaturalization complaints were\nworded somewhat differently, you had to prove that a person was of bad moral character because\nthey materially misrepresented, because they illegally procured a visa, having materially\nmisrepresented, and that misrepresentation was material because it concealed information or data\nthat might have led to uncovering this person\u2019s participation and persecution. So it was a\nparticipation and persecution that was the --",
        "A: -- vital issue.",
        "A: You never --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: If it\u2019s something -- if it was something as general and as amorphous as the Nazi party, or even\nthe SS, or even a given military unit, yes. But there were some units whose raison d\u2019etre was\ninvolved in persecuting people in the basis of race, religion, national origin and political opinion.\nA -- a-- a example that the Supreme Court examined in the Federenko case was that of a\nconcentration camp guard. And the Supreme Court ruled that by the very daily duties of a\nconcentration camp guard, even if he did nothing personally against a prisoner; never shot a\nprisoner, never beat a prisoner, never so much as looked at a prisoner, by standing there on the\nperimeter of the camp with a rifle in his hand, he is acting as a deterrent fra -- for the prisoners\nfrom escaping, and that this was participation in persecution. So there were certain units that if\nyou could prove, if we the U.S. government could prove that the individual was a member of that\nunit, and carried out the normal daily routine of that unit, we would -- that -- that person could be\nproven, if we could prove those facts, a judge could make a finding that that person participated\nin persecution. Or that that person was a -- a person of bad moral character because he\nparticipated in persecution.",
        "A: It -- if it was understood that by carrying out his daily duties --",
        "A: -- he was doing it.",
        "A: That -- no, he was doing it.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t that he could do it. A concentration camp guard, by standing there with a rifle, is\nassisting-- it -- it\u2019s participation, assistance, advocation and acquiescence. Now I -- I don\u2019t think\nwe ever were able to deport anyone or denaturalize anyone because he --",
        "A: -- or she acquiesced.",
        "A: Advocation, no, advocation, the Trifa case was based a lot on advocation of persecution. But\nacquiescence alone usually didn\u2019t cut it as a matter of discretion on whether to file a case. But in\nterms of participation and assistance, a gar -- a cordon guard at a mass killing, or a camp guard,\nis certainly helping the leadership of that tex -- mass killing, or the leadership of that camp to\npersecute people, and that was assistance in persecution. Now had the United States gone the\ncriminal route, it\u2019s hard to know what would have happened, and it\u2019s a route not taken, but the\nstandard of evidence would have been beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas the standard of\nevidence in the civil cases was clear and convincing. Judges often held the United States\ngovernment fairly close to a beyond a reasonable doubt, but we could make this culpability as a\nreflection of membership, or membership being culpability, membership in an organization that\ndid as its daily business the persecution of individuals on the basis of race, religion, national\norigin and political opinion. That we could do. It\u2019s conceivable that in a criminal case, with the\nway we have conspiracy -- you know, prosecutions against conspiracy where the -- where the\ndriver of the escape vehicle is as much guilty as the individual who fires the gun of the murder\nthat\u2019s committed in the bank, it\u2019s conceivable we might have gone that way, but the standards\nwould have been higher, and it may well have been very difficult to obtain convictions.",
        "A: Shortly.\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Well, the sta -- the Holzman Statute refers to four patterns of activity related to persecution;\nassistance, participation, or maybe participation is a better one to start with, assistance,\nadvocation, and acquiescence. Acquiescence as I understood while I was working with OSI, and\nas I think my colleagues on the legal side of it understood it, was basically standing by without\nany specific official or unofficial relation to the events, and letting it happen. And to my\nknowledge we never -- we never filed a case based on acquiescence alone. It was always at least\nsome active participation, assistance or advocation that met the standard for us to make a\ndecision to file a complaint or an order to show cause.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, we would not have, to best of my knowledge we wouldn\u2019t -- and I certainly would\nhave advised against -- as a historian I would have ad-advised against on the basis of the\nevidence, filing a case against, for instance, a bystander who watched an execution. Now, a\nbystander who took a rifle and -- and started shooting, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a little bit different, that\nbecomes participation or assistance. There might be other problems with the proof in that case,\nbecause if 1t was just a by -- 1 -- if we\u2019re just dealing with a bystander, his connection to an\nofficial organization would be difficult if not impossible to prove. But in terms of just standing\nand watching an act of persecution take place, this was not sufficient by itself.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: As we looked at it, 1-in the United States we -- we tend to have a tradition of not holding\npeople criminally or civilly responsible for the things that they believe in, no matter how bad\nthey are. But advocation in this sense we looked at very much in -- in a way that would be\nsimilar to a -- a -- potentially a criminal case, in that the person was advocating in a public\nforum, where the statements that the person was making, whether it was a speech, or in the print\nmedia, or over the radio, would be calculated to incite racial hatred, and from which actual\nevents took place that involved killing, or persec -- other persecution of individuals on the basis\nof race, religion, national origin or political opinion. And we did have cases against several\npropagandists. Viarel Trifa was perhaps the best known in the early years, but there were others,\nVerence Korair, wa -- who, as a Hungarian newspaper editor in Transylvania, and Vladamir\nSokolof wrote for a Russian paper in central Russia that was published by the Wehrmacht for the\nlocal population.",

It was really in -- in all of these cases an individual who held a\nresponsible position either as a journalist or as a propaganda official, or as a newspaper editor\nwho was responsible for content of speech or print media that incited to racial hatred and from\nwhich we could argue reasonably that actions of persecution created an atmosphere in which acts\nof persecu -- acts of persecution could be justified.",

        "A: Yes. I got most of the writing done between 1979 -- during the year 1979, which enabled me\nto be editing at the time I was working full time. I worked part time from \u201978 to \u201980, while I was\nin New York.",
        "A: The organization had moved over from the immigration service to the criminal division. It\nmade a physical move into -- in the old days with the immigration service we were in a gigantic\nroom, separated by small partitions and there were maybe -- oh, if I remember, maybe between\n10 and 15 of us, from attorney to secretary. And when I came down to Washington in 1980 to\nbegin full time work, we were all of a sudden a staff of over 40, each -- almost each of us with\nhis or her own office, although I shared an office with two others, which reflected the status of\nthe historians in that early period. And we -- we had roughly, if I remember correctly, around 20\nattorneys, around 10 or 15 investigators and then the remaining 10 or 15 were a combination of\nhistorians, paralegals and other support staff. And at the time, Rockler, Walter Rockler, who was\nthe first director of the OSI, gathered together a number of attorneys, private -- from private\npractice or other government agencies, and a number of investigators, almost all from other\nfederal agencies ranging from the custom service to state department security to the INS for that\nmatter. And this unit was melded together in a relatively short period of nine months, into a\nfairly effective investigative -- combination investigative and litigative unit.",

I\u2019ve never been a great fan of meetings, and --\nbut I don\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t -- I do remember the meeting at which it was announced that we were\ngoing to file two new cases, and it may have been the first two that were filed subsequent to my\narrival in Washington, and that was the case against Kairys, who was a camp guard at the\nTreblinka labor camp, and against Swubsakof who was a member of a auxiliary SS unit fr --\nfrom -- operative in the Caucasus. That second case was ultimately dropped. But I do remember\na meeting at which it was announced that those two cases were filed, and that had to be\nsometime during 1980.",
        "A: Specifically.",
        "A: I-In terms of the professional staff support staff at this point we were, in fact, the low persons\non the totem pole. Generally the United States government when it -- when it prosecutes, it has\ninvestigators develop cases, and then attorneys prosecute them. And in many ways the attorneys\nand the investigators, most of whom were very, very good, came with those ideas in mind of how\nthings should run. And I remember being interviewed -- the historians were originally under the\ninvestigative wing, and I was interviewed by the chief of investigations in the new unit, when I\nwas applying to come down as a full time worker, to move to Washington. And his question to\nme -- or, it was more of a statement than a question, well you\u2019re not going to be able to write any\nbooks down here. And the idea, the implication was that what a historian did was go to a library\nand read books. And unfortunately he was even wrong on that particular thing because see that\ntome -- I wrote that Trifa tome --",
        "A: -- within a year after he made that statement. But what happened was, as we got the cases, we\nbegan to investigate them as a historian would investigate them. And in order to -- they were like\nlittle biographies, and I ha -- of course, had written a biography for my dissertation, and it was a\nbiography of an individual, the chief of the Nazi security police SD, Ernst Karltenbrunner, who\nhad left very little of himself behind. And I had to go at his biography by dealing with the\norganizations to which he belonged, and by dealing with the individuals with whom he\nassociated. And in many ways, OSI, on a much lower level, dealt with that type of investigative\nprocess. And so what the historians started to do, and now again my colleague, my former\ncolleague David Marlowe and I talked about this quite a bit when we were both at OSI as young\nhistorians, what we started to do was to gather documentation, primary source documentation.\nWe understood, as historians what kinds of documentation bore what weight of reliability. We\u2019d\ngather documentation on the institutions that were relevant to the charges in the complaint. We\u2019d\ngather information on the individual, but we\u2019d also gather information on the comrades of the\nindividuals. And this served two purposes. On the one hand we wanted to talk to those comrades\nif they were still alive, because they could tell us things that the victims of the defendant\ncouldn\u2019t, and they could also tell us about the daily routine, which th -- which information the\ndefendant was not going to give us. We couldn\u2019t get it from any other source other than the hints\nthat were left in the documentation. And for a second reason is that the personnel material, and\nthe administrative material of the organization that these people belonged to, whether it was a\nconcentration camp, or a security police unit, or an auxiliary police unit, gave us a fairly\naccurate, and fairly reliable picture of what the daily life of this defendant was, so that an expert\nwitness could get up in front of a judge and say with complete conviction that on a daily basis,\non a normal day, so and so rotated into these particular guard assignments, and this was part of\nhis daily duty. Now, maybe he didn\u2019t do it on this day or that day, but if you take a period of\ntime, whether it was a week or three months, he was doing it in this order at least some time, and\nthat this was part of the daily routine, the standard operating procedure of this particular unit in\nthis ti -- particular place. And so in gathering this type of documentation, we were able to put\ntogether cases that were based on paper.",
        "A: And were not subject to the inaccuries -- inaccuracies and shifts of personal memory. The\nattorneys and the investigators were often used to working primarily with live bodies, with\nwitnesses, whether it was an expert witness, an expert historical witness, and expert forensic\ntechnician, a survivor witness, even a -- a perpetrator witness. But a live body who could say\nwhat happened, meaning more than the paper documentation. And because of some of the\nproblems with the early witness statements, particularly survivor statements, we came to rely on\nin part, I think, because the -- of the historians work, more solidly on the documentation and the\nwitnesses, particularly the survivor witnesses became much more important to show to the judge\nwhat it was the victims underwent as a result of the defendants participation, assistance or\nadvocation in persecution. And it changed remo -- this was something that historians and\nattorneys in particular, and invest -- investigators to a certain degree, sort of worked towards\nwithout consciously saying this is how we\u2019re going to change it, this was just -- it just became a -\n-a--] won\u2019t say instinctual dynamic, but a professional dynamic in that the historians wanted to\nknow everything they could about the way a place operated, and how the people operated within\na place. And the attorneys and the investigators wanted to win cases. And the combination of\nthose two elements produced cases that we could put on that were based primarily on paper, that\nwent through an expert historical witness. But the witness\u2019s testimony alone was usually not\nenough. We tried as much as possible to have the elements of the expert witness testimony\nbacked at every point by a specific piece of paper that the judge could read and say yes, I can see\nwhy he comes to that opinion. So that the judge, if the judge chose, could go back and pick apart\nthe component parts of the expert\u2019s testimony. And that was the idea that we developed. And by\nwe, I say both historians and attorneys working together, that we developed, in terms of putting\ntogether a case that we felt would be as airtight as possible.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. Yet -- 1-in the early days, in -- in some of the more famous cases that\ncame about in this way, it could come either from rumors from the old country, like Trifa was --\ncharges surfaced against Trifa both from the ra -- Communist Romanian regime, but also from\nRomanian \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the moment he stepped off the boat as a displaced person in 1950.\nAndrea Artukovich was uncovered by, I believe, I -- I can\u2019t remember, but I think he was\nactually seen and denounced by someone. There were people who would pick up on rumors. The\nSoviets would float pamphlet literature in the United States denouncing this person or that\nperson. Maikovskis was denounced in the early 60\u2019s, after having been tried and sentenced to\ndeath in absentia, in a typical Soviet style trial in the early 1960\u2019s. And the response of the early\nauthorities in the seven -- in the early 70\u2019s was to follow these leads and be reactive to what was\ncoming in from the outside. When the OSI hired full-time historians to work on the cases that\nwere floating around, and the OSI inherited 300 -- approximately 350 from the INS, many of\nwhich had been kicking around since the 50\u2019s and the 60\u2019s uninvestigated, particularly after the\nArtukovich fiasco in the mid-50\u2019s. The historians, in their search for documentation relating to\nthe place or places where the defendants served, and relating to the units in which the defendants\nserved, came across rosters of individuals, many of them with birthdates and birthplaces. And\nearly on, beginning even in 1980, the investigators were running lists -- post-war lists developed\nby American authorities of war crime suspects through the Immigration and Naturalization\nService to see whether matches had taken place, or whether there were hits, we called them hits.\nThat the indi -- an individual of the same name, and same birth year at least, and it\u2019s o-often the\nsame birthdate, of this war crime suspect had actually entered the United States on such and such\na date. Once we started collecting rosters, this became a -- a -- a fairly large operation, and we\nwere the first and only unit outside of the federal republic of Germany, and the Soviet Union to\ninvestigate in this way. And so we began, I would say, certainly by 1982 - 1983, 95 percent if not\nbetter of our cases originated in this way. The historians would gather rosters in the course of one\na -- investigation, in order to identify other members of that unit, 1n part as potential sources for\nwitnesses, and in part as potential evidence for that particular investigation. And then would run\nthose names through the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to determine whether these\npeople came to the United States. And if we could determine whether they came to the United\nStates then th-they either became witnesses themselves that we wanted to talk to about their\ncomrades, or they became -- and in most cases they did become subjects.",
        "A: You would think that.",
        "A: You would think that, and it -- 1t certainly happened in the case of Artukovich, he did change\nhis name, and he did get in under a false name. However, most of the people who came in were\nsmall fry. Most of them were certainly aware that there was some documentation about\nthemselves, had existed at one time. Some of them were under the impression that the Nazis\ndestroyed personnel documentation. Others understood that in the late 40\u2019s and the early 50\u2019s,\nthat where the documentation was, was in a place that at that time was inaccessible to --",
        "A: -- to western investigators. And at the time of the Displaced Persons Act and the Refugee\nRelief Act, those who applied would have to go through a background check to determine\nwhether they were eligible. And these background checks were conducted by the counter-\nintelligence corps of the United States army. And they would make a check to the usual sources\nof documentation that were available at the time. These included the Berlin document center, and\nthe German armed forces information agency, as well as regional German police agencies. Now,\nmost of these people, most of the OSI subjects, 90 percent if not better, were from eastern\nEurope and most of them were small fry, and most of them were either non-German, or were\nethnic Germans from the east. So if they were not at a certain level, or had not been members of\nthe SS or the Nazi party, the Berlin document center check would surface nothing, and the armed\nforces information check would surface, if anything, possibly and -- the name of an army unit or\na police unit, and nothing more. When the individual was called in, if all the inve -- all the vice\nconsul had, or the counter-intelligence corps investigator had was the number of a police unit,\nwell, the investigator was essentially at the mercy of what the applicant had to say about what\nthose duties were. I mean, you could be guarding buildings in a police unit, and under the\namended Displaced Persons Act, that would not render you ineligible. There was just no access\nto the type of documentation that became available only beginning with the west German trials\nin the 60\u2019s, and to the United States investigators after the period of d\u00e9tente in the early 70\u2019s.",
        "A: With Operation Paper Clip, we actually did have one case involving an Operation Paper Clip\nsubject, Arthur Rudolf, whom we did end up -- he denaturalized himself essentially, by default.\nThe difference with Operation Paper Clip, and the problem with Operation Paper Clip for the --\nfor proc -- litigation in this context was that these individuals were brought specifically to the\nUnited States, not despite what they\u2019d done, but because of what they\u2019d done. And this, if you go\nback to the context of that time, the purpose of bringing them to the United States was number\none, to obtain whatever missile expertise they might have, and also to deprive the Soviet Union\nof that missile expertise. Which, whatever the morality of the situation 1s, looking back at it at\nthat time, it was not an unreasonable decision given the national security interests at the time.\nThis, obviously, did present a problem in the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s when we were looking into these\ninvestigations, because one could not say that the person gave false information. Another issue\nthat was problematic is that many of these people had, in the broader context, a rather marginal\nconnection with the persecution. The connection was generally at its worst responsibility for\nforced laborers, perhaps denouncing a forced laborer for -- for not working hard enough, as a\nresult of which that forced laborer would be sent to a concentration camp, or sent to a worse\nconcentration camp, or a worst case scenario, executed. This was clearly something that was not\na priority for U.S. officials in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s when they were trying people, they were trying\npeople who were shooting people. They were trying people who were direct, hands-on killers,\nand they had plenty of them. By the 1980\u2019s, because the big fry were either already tried, or die -\n- had died, there was a broader and more intensive public and legal concentration on different\ntypes of connections with Nazi crimes, and the connection with forced labor was clearly one of\nthose. The ro -- for the roc -- for the majority of the rocket scientists, their connection with the\nforced labor was in comparison to that of a concentration camp guard, or a police official,\nrelatively marginal. So the cases were that much tougher to prove, even without the problem of\nwhy the men were brought in.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- it -- 1t -- it\u2019s much more systematic than that. Cases are developed through the OSI\nresearch and development department. This is a department that grew out of the investigative\nwing of the unit in the mid-1980\u2019s, and it is responsible for the -- it -- 1-1t -- 1t functions among\nmany other things, as a transmission belt for these names that are dredged up by the historians,\nbased on the original documentation to and from the INS. If a hit occurs where a person of the\nsame name and same birthdate as someone who is a suspect of being a member of a unit\ninvolved in Nazi offenses, has also entered the United States, the research and development unit\nalso takes several other steps to determine whether the person is still in the United States,\nwhether the person is still alive, and whether the person is in good health. And also to make\ncertain that the individual who resides in the United States is identical with the individual whose\nname a-appears on the roster that -- that was originated in the Nazi era. Once all of those bases\nare covered, so to speak, then the research and development -- the chief of the research and\ndevelopment, I think her -- her name is Elizabeth White, we had Dr. Black and Dr. White, and\nshe then opens a case, gives it an OSI number and it becomes an investigation. The case is then\nassigned to an attorney and to a historian, and to a paralegal. And together the historian does the\ninvestigations, and OSI has some minimal investigative personnel to locate people, locate\nwitnesses, locate files from federal agencies. But the historian does the investigation, works at\nthe investigation to a point where the attorneys consider it ready for what we call a pre-filing\ninterview. Cause we assume that all defendants are innocent until proven guilty, and that there\ncould be some explanation for whatever it is we\u2019ve put together. We obviously, if we get to the\npoint where we want to talk to someone, we obviously feel that we have a -- a good -- we being\nthe U.S. government, feels that we have a good case, that we can litigate if necessary, but there\u2019s\nalways a possibility that there\u2019s a reasonable explanation for the documentation that we find in\nour hands. And so we usually attempt to interview the subject of the OSI investigation prior to\nfiling a case. And as citizens -- if they\u2019re citizens, the subject can refuse to speak to us. Doesn\u2019t\nhave to come. It\u2019s a civil case, the subject does not have to appear. If the subject is an alien, the\nsubject must appear, but he does not have to say anything to us, other than name, rank and serial\nnumber, if he wants. Based on that pre-filing interview, depending on what the unit gets, and\ndepending on what that means for the case, the direction of OSI makes a determination of\nwhether a case, a complaint, or an order to show cause should be filed. And then once that\ndetermination is made, the -- the documentation is drafted, and a case is filed in court.",
        "A: It -- no, this -- generally the hierarchy of importance revolves around the likelihood of an\nindividual belonging to a specific unit that is in its daily routine involved in persecution. So we\nwill go the u -- the United States government will push names for instance, of concentration\ncamp guards before they might push the names of a -- an obscure police unit in an area that\nwe\u2019re not sure that there was persecution, at least Holzman type persecution. We will push\nTrawniki train guards fairly quickly, though if we have Trawniki train guards who came in late\n1943 or early 1944, they might not have the same priority as a Trawniki train guard who was at\nBelzec.",
        "A: Or at Sobibor. Then of course, we\u2019re gonna -- we\u2019re going to put a higher priority. The\npriority -- priorities that are assigned tend to reflect our experience in what constitutes a\nwinnable case.",
        "A: They\u2019re -- OSI has several attorneys who\u2019ve been around for --",
        "A: -- a long time. So they have -- they have a good sense -- and -- and they\u2019ve prosecuted a lot of\ncases, and so they have a good sense of what constitutes a winnable case. And they can also\nimpart that good sense to the newer attorneys, who -- there\u2019s much more turnover among the\nattorneys than there is among the historians. But the process of opening cases 1s a process that\u2019s\nmore or less run by my former colleague, Elizabeth White. She is the one who makes a\ndetermination on whether a case should be opened or not. It does go through her superior, her\ndirect superior who 1s the director of the office, Eli Rosenbaum, and he -- he needs to approve,\nbut I don\u2019t know of any cases where he has rejected a recommendation from her that a case be\nfiled. She\u2019s --",
        "A: She\u2019s been around long enough -- she was a -- she was trained in German and European\nhistory and she\u2019s been with the office since 1983. And she\u2019s been running the R and D section\nsince the departure of David Marwell in 1988. So she\u2019s quite capable --",
        "A: -- and knowledgeable in her own right to know what constitutes a -- a -- a unit, based on the\ndocumentation that exists, what constitutes a unit that -- who\u2019s an -- individuals are likely to\nparticipating in persecution.",
        "A: It is heavy.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question, and -- and -- and actually the Trifa case is probably not a good\nexample --",
        "A: -- because it\u2019s an early case.",
        "A: But I -- I didn\u2019t -- I -- I feel I should explain why that tome is so big. It has to do with some of\nthe specifics of the Trifa case. Trifa was not a case which was developed by OSI. It was a case\nthat was developed through denunciation. And Trifa in his defense was able to make statements\nthat were half-truths, that required a significant amount of documentation to develop an\nunderstanding among the attorneys of what the actual truth was. Trifa, for example, was able to\nsay he was incarcerated in a concentration camp during the war. And what did that mean? He\nwas able to say that the Romanian Iron Guard was anti-German. What did that mean? He could\nsay that the Germans didn\u2019t trust the Iron Guard. What did that -- all of those things were -- were\ntruth, but they weren\u2019t the whole truth. And the whole truth was dependent on a rather acute\nanalysis of what the documentation was, what the conditions were like for the Iron Guards when\nthey were in German captivity. It was clear from the documentation. But it took 40 pages of that\nparticular part of the case to explain to the prosecuting attorneys, and also -- who would then\nexplain it to the judge, through the expert witness, of what exactly was the nature of the\npersecution of Trifa. The same is true for the Iron Guards anti-German behavior, or the Iron\nGuards rebellion against the Fascist Romanian military dictatorship which was backed by the\nGermans. And for Trifa\u2019s own particular role in persecution, which was -- had to be shifted from\nthe original emphasis on physical mistreatment of individuals, which came from witnesses, many\nof whom didn\u2019t, as it turned out, pan out, to a more -- persecution based more on advocation,\nparticularly within the student rubric, and student organizations of exclusion and discrimination\nagainst Jews and Gypsies and Greeks in Romania. And also towards a print advocation of -- with\nintent to instill hatred of these minority groups, and to help to create an atmosphere in which the\nauthorities could, with reasonable support from the general population, engage in physical\npersecution of these individuals. And if you\u2019ll notice in that particular tome at the end of each\nsection, there is a contrast between Trifa\u2019s statements, and what evidence exists, based on the\nhistorical context in the chapters, that would contradict what Trifa -- Trifa\u2019s version of events.\nAnd that was an unusual case.",
        "A: A -- amuch more normal type of reporting, and in fact it became institutionalized in the 90\u2019s\nwhen courts began demanding an expert witness report, which was essentially a historical\nbiography of the official duties of the defendant. And I -- I don\u2019t remember exactly which year\nwe -- the courts began to require these reports, but I think it was in the early 90\u2019s. A much better\nexample is the Schellong report, Conrad Schellong, who was a -- who was a concentration camp\nguard and security officer at Dachau in the years before the war, and I can tell you now that\nsomeone in OSI when I first at -- was assigned to the case was disappointed that he was only\nthere before the war, and even said something to the effect, well before the war they were just\nlike prisons, weren\u2019t they? And that signaled to me as a historian that even before we went\noutside to deal with judges and defense attorneys, we had to lay a context for what Dachau was,\nand a context to prove, in a sense, that the people who were in Dachau, despite Nazi euphemisms\nand misstatements about who they were and why they were there, were in that camp for reasons\nof race, religion, national origin and political opinion --",
        "A: -- and were being persecuted for those reasons. And a key hooker to that was dealing with the\ninstrument, the legal police instrument of schutzhaft, or protective detention is the loose\ntranslation. And by dealing with the regulations of protective detention, which was imposed by\nthe Gestapo outside the concentration camp, and had little to do with the individual\u2019s sojourn\nwithin the camp, except to bring him or her in, or bring him or her out if he or she managed to\nsurvive. But the schutzhaft provided the proof that the people who were in that camp were in that\ncamp because of their race, because they were Jewish in 1938, because of their national origin,\nbecause of their religious convictions, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, or because of their political opinion;\nSocialists, Communists and -- and what have you. And that was quite clearly expressed in\nschutzhaft orders and in the discussion of what schutzhaft was and how schutzhaft was supposed\nto be applied in the documentation of the Gestapo, of the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and of\nthe concentration camp commandants themselves. And so we -- we as historians were\nresponsible for putting together a context of how the prisoners came into the concentration camp,\nby what pseudo-legal means they came into the concentration camp, of how the guards were\nrecruited, of what their duties were, and of how their daily duties involved keeping these people\nin a place where they were being persecuted on the basis of race, religion and so forth. And\nthrough that, if we could prove all of those facts, and we could prove that the defendant was a\nmember of this unit, then we could prove -- then -- then a judge could reach a finding that this\nindividual persecuted, or assisted -- participated in persecution. And the purpose in writing a\nreport, and people always used to joke about my long reports -- the purpose of writing the report\nwas not only to inform the attorneys, but also to solidify in the mind of the historian, what the\nframework of this inquiry was going to be, and so that the historian could be sure that all relevant\ndocumentation, some of it -- some of which was often obscure and by itself meaningless, how it\nfit in. And y -- we could use the report even though we didn\u2019t show the reports to the expert\nwitnesses until the courts began to require us to provide an expert witness report, we didn\u2019t show\n-- these were work product. But we would use the framework established by that report to work\nout the testimony of the expert witness, and then test it against the expert witnesses, cause after\nall, he was an independent individual, or she -- a-and I think most of our expert witnesses were\nmale.",
        "A: I think all of them were male, I can\u2019t remember a female expert witness.",
        "A: No, they wouldn\u2019t -- in the early days they would not get the report.",
        "A: The report was work product for the attorney and for the historian. But the attorney -- the\nareas that the attorney wanted to cover in the testimony were informed by the contents and\ncontext that was reflected in the report.\npoint, and that -- so it didn\u2019t matter that there were homosexuals who were being persecuted in\nthe concentration camps. Cause there\u2019s no reference.",
        "A: You know, again, and here\u2019s something that I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- I -- I\u2019m not sure of why it\nisn\u2019t in there. I -- certainly in 1978, when the legislation was drafted, the focus on sexual\npreference, and on persecution for sexual pref -- on the basis of sexual preference, was\nunfortunately not as consciously not this -- not of the same conscious concern to U.S. authorities\nor anyone else, frankly, as it is today. We -- there\u2019s also, if you notice in the legislation, there\u2019s\nno provision for the persecution of people who were engaged in what the Nazis called asocial\nbehavior.",
        "A: Whether it was panhandling on the street, or flashing, or what have you.",
        "A: And part of the problem, no doubt, rests with -- the drafters of the legislation may well have\nfelt, well we\u2019re probably not going to pass this legislation at this time if we say that it\u2019s wrong to\npersecute homosexuals when we have many states that still have sodomy laws on the books.",
        "A: And we\u2019re certainly not going to be able to pass this legislation if we count locking up\npanhandlers, or flashers or what have you, whatever asocial behavior you choose to -- to focus\non, you\u2019re not going to be able to pass this legisla -- we want to pass this legis -- we want to pass\nthis legislation in very clear and convincing areas that we know at the time, in the context of the\n70\u2019s that there will be a consensus among Americans that this is wrong, that we don\u2019t want\npeople who engage in this activity, persecution of these people, for these reasons in our United\nStates. Do I know that for -- do I know that for -- whether that was really behind -- in the minds?\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s speculation. But I suspect that wherever there was the possibility that we the\nUnited States might prosecute the same things, this would clearly present an argument for any\ndefendant to say you [indecipherable]",

        "A: -- we used evidence of that to indicate persecution on the basis of race. This was impossible\nto do, obviously, in the case of German homosexuals.",
        "A: Because the persecution was not on the basis of race, it was not on the basis of religion, it was\nnot on the basis of national origin. It was not even on the basis of political opinion, at least not\ndirectly. And it is also true that for those homosexuals who were willing to make the attitude\nadjustment, that they could get out, if they ceased practicing their homosexual activity, which\nwas not so true for the Communists, at least on the higher levels, or certainly not for the Jews at a\nlater time.\ninclination, would that matter if somebody said, look, look at how you treat Communists here,\nit\u2019s an outlaw party, or you know, you imprison people because of it, or you think they\u2019re\nconpriri -- conspiring to overthrow the government. So I persecuted them, who cares? Why --\nyou know, same thing. Is [indecipherable]",

        "A: -- in a concentration camp, it -- it would have been a problem, I think --",
        "A: -- because it would have been an issue that would have been much harder to argue because of\nthe United States own recent past, and recent hysteria.

That being said, I don\u2019t recall, at least\nit\u2019s not -- it hasn\u2019t been in my history books, and there\u2019s no reason to assume that even at its\nworst, the United States government treated Communists the way the Nazi government treated\nCommunists. But it would have been a harder issue to argue --",

        "A: Whether you can make an argument that will convince, in this case, a judge.

        "A: Good.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: There was a combination. Actually, I was not the first assigned to the Trifa case, it had pre-\ndated OSI, and in fact pre-dated the SLU, the Special Litigation Unit in the INS, had actually\nbeen filed in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, I believe it was, in 1975. Some of the early\nresearch for the SLU, in records both in the national archives and in Romania, were done by\nnone other than Paul Shapiro, who worked as a contractor for the SLU for a short time in \u201978 -\n\u00b079. I\u2019m -- maybe \u201977 - \u201978. When I was hired and brought down to Washington, I had a look at\nthe existing evidence, and there was still a s -- a number of gaps that needed to be filled at that\npoint, primarily from material that was held at the United States National Archives, and\nprimarily from captured German records, SS records, and German foreign office records. And\nwhat I did was to gather the rest of that material and pull that material, together with the material\nthat had been gathered from Romania, and with some newer material that had been gathered\nfrom the Library of Congress, which had the monetoral officiale, which was the legal gazette of\nthe Antonescu regime in Romania. And -- cause we weren\u2019t at war with Romania during the\nperiod that the Iron Guard was in power in the autumn and winter of 1940 and 1941. And I\nintegrated the information from these various sources, into a narrative that was broken down into\nthe topics that were relevant to our -- the components of our complaint and the defenses that\nTrifa had made against the charges of the government.",
        "A: In this particular case, the lawyers used it as a cheat sheet in a way, for developing a line that\n-- their line of questioning of the expert witness on direct examination. And they also used -- it\nwas written in such a way so that the attorneys could use that which they needed, to deal with\nrebuttal questions that came up on cross-examination, the -- the questions, if he says this to this,\nor if the pro -- if the defense attorney asks the expert to explain this, this 1s what -- this 1s a -- a\nreasonable response if the independent expert agrees. And sometimes the defense attorney would\nnot ask the question, and you wouldn\u2019t need to introduce the e -- there was no reason to\nintroduce the evidence on direct examination. Let me see if I can think of a good exa -- good\nexample. We could argue -- here\u2019s an example, I -- I don\u2019t remember if this exactly was in my\nmind at the time, or this be -- was an issue at the trial, but Trifa claimed that he was persecuted\nby the Nazis, that he was a concentration camp prisoner. Our direct examination involved his\nsojourn with the other Iron Guard leaders in the Birkenbrook SS house, where -- from where he\nhad a special vacation for his stomach ulcers, where he was at spas, and going to movies, and\nwriting home about -- home to his buddies at Birkenbrook about his stomach illnesses, and his\nmedicines, and what the weather was like, not -- not exactly the regular concentration camp\nprisoner\u2019s life.",
        "A: After Coriasima, the Iron Guard leader escaped from Birkenbrook, and was tracked down in\nRome and brought back. At the behest of the foreign ministry, the SS did put the -- the Iron\nGuard leaders in a concentration camp, I believe it was at Buchenwald, but I can\u2019t remember\nwhere -- which camp at the moment. I think Seymour went to Sachsenhausen and the rest of\nthem went to Buchenwald. But even here, and this was the issue that was brought up for rebuttal;\nif he says, oh I was in a concentration camp, and I was treated poorly, even here there is evidence\nthat the Iron Guard leaders were clearly prominent persons, kept in a separate compound, they\nhad a radio they could listen to, and they even had a -- a -- Jehovah\u2019s Witness as a -- as a-- a\nperson who would clean their -- their rooms, and what have you. Again, it was not the typical\nconcentration camp existence, and they were clearly not in there because of Nazi persecution of\ntheir politics, they were in there because the Nazis needed to keep tabs on them for foreign\npolicy reasons, and they also wanted to keep them in reserve in the event that the Antonescu\nregime ever tried to desert the axis, as it did in 1944. So it was that type of evidence that I felt,\nand other historians working on their cases felt that the attorneys ought to have, either for\nrebuttal purposes, or for their general background. And in some cases it was information that the\nexpert witness might not have, but might be able to evaluate in a useful way, to frame his or her\ntestimony.",
        "A: This would be an ongoing --",
        "A: -- it would be an ongoing conversation that we would have, and it would often be a\nconversation that we would have in the context of selecking -- selecting specific documents, and\ngiving them priority as to how we ought to use them. As I remember it, in our cases, in the cases\nI worked on, there were four levels of priority. We selected documents that we were definitely\ngoing to introduce as evidence on direct examination, through the vehicle of the expert witness.\nAnd this involved a whole procedure of making sure that they were properly translated, making\nsure that they were properly certified as to the chain of custody, which was particularly for\nmaterials from the Soviet Union, and the eastern bloc, these were -- this could be a very, very\ncomplicated process. The second level required similar preparation because these were\ndocuments that were selected to be used if necessary to rebut possible defenses, or\ndocumentation submitted in support of possible defenses. So in other words, you had to have\nthese documents ready as if you wanted to move them into evidence, whether you moved them\ninto evidence or not. But a decision to move them into evidence would be made, perhaps very\nclose to trial, or maybe during the trial itself. The third level of priority were those documents\nthat we felt that the expert witness should see. That we would not use them as evidence, they\nwere not appropriate as evidence, either because they were not relevant, or because, for instance,\nthey involved a witness statement where the witness was no longer alive and couldn\u2019t be cross\nexamined, and it was not an old enough document to come in under an ancient documents\nexception to the hearsay rule. Or 1t was simply general background and general context that the\nexpert witness should either see for the first time, or refresh his memory and have it as part of the\ncontext of the case, but it was not necessary to introduce as evidence. It was something that the\nexpert could talk about without having to document it. An example of that might be -- an\nexample of that might be a report about a specific event that occurred in 1941, that was written in\n1944, either by the government that perpetrated the event, or that was presiding over the event,\nor by the successor government. Was something that the expert probably should be aware of, but\nit was not something that was appropriate to use as evidence. And then the fourth rung were\nthose documents that were either exonerating, or in some way that could potentially adversely\naffect the case, so that the expert witness would have an opportunity to know what they were,\nand to reconcile them with the theory of the case as developed through this cooperation between\nthe expert witness and the prosecution team.",
        "A: Well a -- I\u2019m not a lawyer here --",
        "A: -- an -- and we moved documentation, historical documentation, not only contemporaneous\nGerman and other axis documentation, but even post-war interrogations under an -- an exception\nto the hearsay rule, which is called the ancient documents exception. And I believe to remember\nthat the -- the year -- I think there\u2019s a year limit, and there is a requirement that the document is\nnot created in the interests of the present proceeding. So in other words, it has to be old enough,\nfirst of all, so that there\u2019s no shadow of a doubt as to whether the document was created for this\nproceeding. And by the same token, it had to be totally d -- think of a good word -- totally de-\nlinked from the existing proceeding, cause technically even an order, written right prior to an\noperation, is a hearsay document. The document only says what it says, it\u2019s not proof that the\norder was carried out, it\u2019s not -- the signature isn\u2019t proof that the person who signed it actually\nsigned it, unless you test the handwriting, nor 1s it proof that the person who actually signed it\nread it, and intended that order to be -- to be implemented. But the expert witness could argue on\nthe basis of his experience, on the basis of his having seen many similar documents, that this was\na normal document of the type created by this type of agency in this type of situation. And that\u2019s\nhow this document came to be. And this went for post-war interrogation protocols as well, which\nwere na -- not even word for word testimony. They were summaries that were written by police\nor prosecutors of what the witness said, and then the witness later signed it, which is the normal\nway of procedure in -- in continental law. There\u2019s no word for word witness testimony in a pre-\ntrial interrogation. The witness talks, the prosecutor or police interrogator summarizes it, types it\nup, and the witness is -- 1s -- reads it and then either signs to 1t or makes whatever changes the\nwitness deems are a-appropriate and accurate.",
        "A: It may -- it -- 1t made it appropriate to move that info -- those documents into evidence. It\ncame in under an exception to the hearsay rule. Now, as -- as far as the weight that\u2019s given to that\ndocumentation, in that case, both the prosecution, first -- when we first got the material, and the\njudge finally gave it what weight, as evidence he or she saw fit. And in this case, in -- in that\nparticular case, because of some certain specific -- specificity of language of the sister\u2019s -- of the\nsister\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s unit, we -- we ga -- we, the prosecution and the judge as\nwell, gave it considerable weight, because she used a term that she couldn\u2019t have known, or\nwouldn\u2019t have used. It was a foreign term, and it was a specific unit, and she got part of that term\nright. She just wouldn\u2019t have known it if he wasn\u2019t, in fact, in that unit.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- that has not happened as yet.",
        "A: In fact, I will serve as an expert witness for OSI this coming year in a case, and I am as -- as\nfar as I know, the first former staff member, but I am a former staff member, because the expert\nis an independent expert --",
        "A: -- and the historians on staff at this point, up to this point are -- have still been considered in a\nself-censoring way by the prosecuting agency, as part of the prosecution --",
        "A: -- and therefore vulnerable to charges by the defense that they -- they know who they\u2019re\ngetting, th -- they know where their salaries come from, and they\u2019ll testify accordingly.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Hillberg is an expert witness.",
        "A: The expert offers evidence on -- provided it\u2019s there --",
        "A: -- the expert offers evidence -- excuse me -- on what the unit did, o-on the big picture, first of\nall, so we -- usually the -- the -- the way it\u2019s laid out is we deal with ideological issues, what the\nGerman aims were at the very top, what the specific conditions and administrative structures\nwere in the particular region involved, and then getting down to the particular organization or\norganizations in chronological sequence as much as possible. And then going down as far as the\ndocumentation permits the expert to make a judgment. For instance, if the expert sees a month\u2019s\nworth of guard rotation assignments at a concentration camp, that expert can talk about those\nrotations, because he\u2019s seen enough evidence to convince him of how -- or -- or to define for him\nwhat the daily routine was like. If there\u2019s no evidence, he can speak about -- if there\u2019s no\nevidence -- well, let me -- let me retract that. If there\u2019s -- if we don\u2019t have the daily rotations, but\nonly have evidence of the concentration camp within the system, then the expert, if he feels so\ncomfortable in doing so, can talk about how -- what the normal routine was within the\nconcentration camp system, and how in his expert opinion there\u2019s no reason to assume that for\nthis particular concentration camp, it went any way differently. He cannot -- or I wouldn\u2019t, as an\nexpert witness, try to get into the detail as to who was rotated where at what time, or even what\nthe specific places of rotation were. That you\u2019d have to do on the basis of the evidence. You\ncan\u2019t know that if you don\u2019t have the -- 1-1f -- 1f there\u2019s a gap in that documentation. And for\ninstance, to give you an example, in the Schellong case, we didn\u2019t have that documentation for\nDachau. We only knew that he was a security officer, and we knew that there were regular\nfunctions for security officers in concentration camps. And the expert testified as to that. We did\nhave rotation rosters for the guards at Sachsenburg, where Schellong was at before he went to\nDachau. And there the expert could talk very specifically that Conrad Schellong, on such and\nsuch a day, was outside the bunker. Or that he checked in on the bunker as security officer every\nthree or four hours, whatever the -- the case might have been. For instance in the Hajda case, we\ncould talk because we had, through a three tiered level of documentation, contemporaneous\ndocumentation of individuals who were in the Trawniki system, and who served at the Treblinka\nlabor camp, individuals who after the war testified in western countries, where there was --\nwhere you didn\u2019t have the baggage of what the Soviet system was like, that they had indeed been\nthere, and done this, that and the other thing, and then of course, the Soviet protocols, in so far as\nthe information contained therein was consistent with the original documentation, and the\ntestimony in the western protocols. And through a s -- a combination of those three types of\nsources, we were able to identify where virtually every single individual who served at the\nTreblinka labor camp between March 1943, and its dissolution in July 1944, where they were.\nWe were able even to determine what happened to the people who appeared on one roster and\nwere no longer on the other roster. One was sent back because he was a chronic drunk, and we\nhad documentation -- his own testimony in that case, that he became an alcoholic at Treblinka\none. A post-war testimony in a German proceeding, a west German proceeding. In another case,\nan individual deserted, and we found the -- the German wanted list, indicating that this indi --\nindividual had deserted and was being sought at a time between the dates of the two rosters. And\nso the expert was able to speak in significant detail about who was at Treblinka one, when, and\nwhat they were doing there; and in a way that was very convincing to the judge.",
        "A: I think Trifa\u2019s -- the interest for Trifa -- we had a couple of journalists. Trifa was primarily a\njournalist, he was also a student leader. He was unique among OSI subjects -- well not u-unique,\nbut rare among OSI subjects in that he was in the highest level of leadership. He was next to the -\n- he was in that group that was close to the -- the leader Horia Sima himself. But he was -- he\nwas unique in that much of what he said in his defense, in contrast to it being an outright lie, did\ncontain a grain of truth. And -- but was significant more for what he omitted to say, than what he\nactually admitted. In other words, Trifa was a concentration camp prisoner, or was ca -- I take\nthat back, I\u2019m going to withdraw that. He was, for a time, confined in a concentration camp. He\nwas in the custody of the Germans. He was a member of a movement that the Germans didn\u2019t\nfully trust, and that rebelled against the regime that the Germans supported. All of these issues --\nI can\u2019t think at the moment of another defendant that, given the hope of prosecutorial ignorance,\nhad a better defense in that he could rely on half-truths, rather than simply claiming to be in\nanother place other than he was, or claiming to have been a combat soldier when he really was a\nconcentration camp guard, or simply denying ever having served with the Germans, or 1n the\nHajda case, as you saw, rather unwisely claiming that the information, though accurate as to his\nperson, wasn\u2019t him, that somebody else was using his birth data, for reasons that no one could\never explain.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Trifa, Trifa.",
        "A: Trifa came to trial twice -- I take that back, I withdraw that. He came to -- he was supposed to\ncome to trial twice, both times -- once before the trial at denat stage, and once during the trial at\nthe deport stage, he threw in the towel.",
        "A: At both times. Shortly before denaturalization, Trifa voluntarily turned in his certificate, and\nrenounced his citizenship. Didn\u2019t stop him from appealing the decision afterwards. His attorney,\na-- am--aman by the name of Woods, I think, I can\u2019t recall his first name, at that time wrote a\ngigantic tome in defense of Trifa, and criticizing Trifa for withdrawing, and bitterly attacking the\ngovernment for persecuting Trifa, which was another issue that we -- we had to deal with in\nputting together the deportation case, because we had every reason to believe that once Trifa\nappealed the denaturalization decision, which came as a result of his voluntary act of throwing in\nthe towel, we had every reason to believe that he would fight at deportation. And he did take it to\ntrial at deportation, and I\u2019m still convinced -- I was at the trial, I\u2019m still convinced that due to the\ntremendous talent of the lead attorney on the case, Kathleen Coleman, who still works for the\nJustice Department, and the way she was orchestrating -- well, I co -- wouldn\u2019t say orchestrating,\nthe way she was permitting the expert witness, Bayla Vargo, to explain the context of what this\ndocumentation relating to Trifa really meant, that of everyone in the courtroom, Trifa probably\nknew best where the testimony was going.",
        "A: And after two days of it -- the expert was on the stand for two days, Trifa\u2019s lawyers\napproached Allen Ryan who was at the trial and again ultimately offered to throw in the towel\nand agreed to an order of deportation.",
        "A: Th -- [ha -- I don\u2019t know exactly, but this -- this is only speculation on my part that Trifa --\nTrifa, perhaps even better than the judge, saw that -- saw what the prosecution was proving, what\nwe were capable of proving in the courtroom. There could be other reasons, Trifa may have felt\nthat this was too much of an embarrassment. This may have been an issue at the denaturalization\nstage, after all, he was the head of the Romanian American Orthodox church, he wasn\u2019t just a\nprivate citizen. Which certainly helped in terms of funding to pay his lawyers, but might have\nbeen a problem in terms of his parishioners. There may have been problems in the church. Other\nchurch leaders may have been a little upset at Trifa\u2019s posi -- Trifa being who he was, and what\nthat was doing to the reputation of the rom -- Romanian American church, but I don\u2019t know that.\nI don\u2019t know what went into that ultimate decision to throw in the towel.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The deportation hearing, yeah.",
        "A: No, we definitely -- the historian is definitely a part of the prosecution team. This was\nsomething that came to be established fairly early on. I was at the -- the first case that I went to\ntrial with was the Schellong case, which went, I believe in the summer of 1981, and I also was at\nthe trial in the Maikovskis case. And the role the historian played there was a -- ultimately, other\nthan the expert, the case historian has the strongest knowledge of the historical documentation,\nwe're talking in the Trifa case we had over 700 exhibits, and the historian, more than the\nattorney could pull not only the exhibits that were geared for exhibits, but the exhibits that were\nthere as background, that were -- m-might become important for one reason or another during the\ncourse of the trial. Only the historian had that knowledge at his -- or in Elizabeth White\u2019s case,\nhers -- her fingertrip -- her fingertips.",
        "A: And this was something that relieved the attorney of having to worry about that. And it\nrelieved the paralegal, who could read the translations but could not read the original documents,\nand if there was a discrepancy it relieved the paralegal of having to worry about that, and\nallowed him or her to concentrate on the location, the physical location of the individual exhibits.\nThere was another function as well. One -- one never knew what kinds of defenses would come\nup, what kinds of issues would come up at trial. There might be an unanticipated defense, an\nunanticipated piece of evidence, something that the -- that the defense would introduce at the last\nmoment, whether it\u2019d been turned over in discovery or not. One could never know whether the\njudge would let it in, regardless of what the rules were, and the rules were pretty lax in\nimmigration court. And the historian had to be there 1n order, if it were in a foreign language, to\nread the language, and also to analyze the context of the document so that the prosecution could\nbe ready to move forward, regardless of the issue. And so it was -- it was very much to manage\nthe knowledge --",
        "A: -- manage the data, not -- not the knowledge but the data contained in the documents, and also\nas a preventative, a prophylactic measure a-against surprises in -- in terms of evidence that the\ndefense might present, or materials that the defense might present that the prosecution didn\u2019t\nanticipate.",
        "A: I could read German, in which most of the documentation was involved, and during periods in\nmy career, I could read some kitchen Polish and kitchen Romanian. I\u2019ve forgotten both of the\nlast two. I can still pick out certain words, but if there was something that was purported to be a\npolice document for instance, depending on the letterhead, you could get a se -- an immediate\nsense of whether this was a genuine document or not, and be in a position to advise the attorney,\nlook, we need to have a recess, we need to fax this back to the office, we need to get somebody\nto look at it and translate it, to -- to take those steps, if necessary, to get the contents of the\ndocument available to the prosecution team.",
        "A: Yes, it was a courtroom. It was a courtroom -- in every case it was a courtroom not so\ndifferent than the kinds that you see on court TV.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The historian would be, in most cases, at the very beginning, there was a sort of an attorney -\nnot attorney thing, and the attorneys wanted to sit at the table, and the historian was to be in the\nfront row of the audience --",
        "A: -- but given the practical momentum or -- or dynamic of how a trial went, the attorneys\nquickly -- the lead attorneys quickly insisted that the historian be there --",
        "A: -- be there. And the attorneys -- you would often have two or three attorneys in a case, and\neach attorney was responsible for different witnesses and different parts of the presentation,\nyou'd have a -- an introductory argument most of the time, you\u2019d have a closing argument.\nYou\u2019d have one attorney responsible for the expert witness, which was after all the crux of the\nprosecution\u2019s case. That same attorney, or possibly another attorney would be responsible for the\ntestimony of the defendant, if the defendant was either called -- occasionally we called the\ndefendant as a prosecution witness, but more often the defendant testified in his own behalf, and\nthe government\u2019s attorney then had an opportunity to cross examine. Then you had another\nattorney, more often a -- a -- a more junior attorney responsible for survivor witnesses and for\nwitnesses who testified as to the immigration process, th-the qualifications for certification as\nrefugee, the qualifications for certification as a displaced person, and the vice counsels.",
        "A: These were public trials.",
        "A: Yes, they were public trials. I don\u2019t recall -- certainly none of the cases I was involved in was\na see -- was a Si -- was a Closed trial.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: They were prepped the way any witness would be prepped in any kind of civil or criminal\ncase. Our witnesses -- w-we\u2019d go over the questions we wanted to ask them, and listen to their\nanswers, and there were often times when the answer we were expecting was not one that the\nexpert was comfortable with, and there was a dynamic, and h-here the historian played a\nsignificant role, often in the evening before trial, and in the evenings between the -- betwe --\nbetween testimony of the expert witness in finding a common ground where the prosecution and\nthe expert witness could both be comfortable with what the expert witness was saying, because\nthere would be disputes and the expert witness was truly an independent witness and if he\nwouldn\u2019t say what the lawyer expected him to say, that was a problem. And none of the OSI\nattorneys wanted to be accused of coaching a witness to say something that wasn\u2019t true. And the\nstaff historian often played a role, using his or her knowledge of the documentation at finding\nsomething that both expert witness and prosecuting attorney could feel comfortable with.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely, and there is also a process of preparing the expert witness for cross\nexamine questions -- cross examination questions that he might get, and they -- the whole\nprocess of prepping for that. But this is something that\u2019s not unusual and happens in all\nproceedings and the defense does it with their witnesses as well.",
        "A: Yes, th-the expert had to be comfortable enough with the material to be able to speak, offer\nhis opinions with confidence.",
        "A: And -- and in a sense that\u2019s really what it was, it was an issue -- the expert had to be an\nexpert, had to be comfortable enough with the data to be able to get up there and speak with\nconfidence. And you can\u2019t just, in my experience -- and I worked well with all of the experts that\nI worked with, the one I worked with most often was a gentleman named Charlie Sidmore, and I\nworked with him in the Hajda case, as you saw from the transcript. But it -- 1t had to -- there had\nto be enough knowledge, enough familiarity with the material on the part of the expert, which\nmeant the expert really had to do some work, and independent work, so that he could get up on\nthe stand and feel really comfortable about what he was saying and even if he did make a\nmistake, which we\u2019re all human and we do make a mistake, that we could make sure that it was\ncleared up on a follow-up question, or on redirect examination, if the mistake was made on cross\nexamination. Cause the -- the -- the nature of these cases, and the level at which the information\nwas relevant -- most historians deal with the upper levels of an agency, and where we were\ndealing with people on the ground that are -- is generally not of much historical -- broader\nhistorical significance, given the complexity of the documentation, experts would forget this or\nthat, or the other thing, and a follow-up question was often all one needed to trigger off what the\nexpert already knew.",
        "A: All have an academic background.",
        "A: All are trained as academics. We had at least one expert witness who was not -- did not hold a\nuniversity position in the most recent 10 years of his career, but he continued to be academically\nactive.",
        "A: In other words, they were all experts in the sense that they continued to work with primary\nsource documents, they continued to write history, they continued to analyze documentation, and\nthey kept up on the latest research in the field in which they were expert.",
        "A: I -- I think -- 1-it\u2019s been my experience, at least from what I\u2019ve observed with experts on the\nstand, that there are times when the moo -- th-the rules of the courtroom, as to what gets in, what\n-- what -- what doesn\u2019t get in, can be frustrating to the effort to explain the context of a situation.\nBut I noticed in -- and I\u2019m thinking of at least two or three expert witnesses, who were able to\novercome quickly, that discomfort and work with the rules of -- of evidence.",
        "A: And in a sense, 1-it just requires you to know your material very, very well. To get a sense of\nthe dynamic of the questioning. To not be flustered by interruptions by the defense, because the\ndefense attorney\u2019s job is to try to disrupt as much as possible, the train of thought of the expert,\nand to try to -- even the most decent of defense attorneys -- to try to catch the expert witnesses --\nwitness, in errors of fact or interpretation that would serve to undermine his whole testimony.\nAnd those experts who accepted that, were competent enough in their material not to get\nflustered by those interruptions and kept going back and kept listening to, and following the\ndirection of the questions, usually got most of what the -- they intended to say, out.",
        "A: And in -- in -- in that sense, the expert testimony, taken together with the trial record offered a\nfairly good picture of the history of this particular defendant.",
        "A: Eyewitnesses, in a sense.",
        "A: W-We use two types -- actually three types of eyewitnesses. There were two -- there was a\ntraditional type of eyewitness, whether it was a survivor, or a fellow perpetrator who actually\nsaw specific events at hand. We also used, a-a-and in this case survivor witnesses who may not\nhave probably 1-1in many cases, most cases, didn\u2019t know the defendant, had no idea what the\ndefendant did, but could talk in general about what his or her perception of what the guards were\ndoing was, and also more important, what life was like. There\u2019s no one, no book, no perpetrator\ntestimony, no historian can possibly get across with the same intensity as a survivor talking, what\nit felt like to the survivor. And it -- when the survivor talks, in that sense, if one ac-accepts the\ntestimony as being no more than what it 1s, that survivor\u2019s memory, some of the inaccuracies that\ninevitably come up in human memory, even when they can\u2019t be reconciled with an explanation,\nstill don\u2019t detract from the image of what life was like in a concentration camp, or in a line\nwaiting to be shot at a pit. That this is something that -- this kind of testimony lends an\nimmediacy that the dry documentation just can\u2019t give. But it also is less immu -- less vulnerable\nto attack than testimony, I saw him do it, because that raises all sorts of questions of how the\nwitness knew who he was. And remember, he was most often wearing a uniform, and a cap, and\nlooked pretty much like the next him and the next him after that. And how does this witness\nremember this particular person as opposed to anyone else? And in a trial with a dynamic where\nthe defense attorney has the opportunity and must have the opportunity to question that witness\u2019s\nmemory, to try to trip that witness, to try to ask questions, well isn\u2019t it possible that you could be\nmistaken? How do you really know that it was this person and not someone else? And in that ki -\n- type of dynamic, that kind of testimony, unless there was some reason for the survivor witness\nto have known the man, the way you would -- the way you would judge the credibility of any\neyewitness, in any criminal case, the eyewitnesses -- the survivor testimony was often much\nmore effective to give a picture of the climate of persecution, to offer evidence as to the identity\nof the people who are being persecuted through their own persons. This was stuff that they knew.\nThis was stuff that they would not be mistaken about and could not be mistaken about. Then we\nhad a third type of witness, we had to develop how the process of certifying refugees, and how\nthe refugees applied for visas, we had to establish that particular process. And we did that by\nlocating individuals who had actually worked on those processes. In other words, displaced\npersons -- officials from the displaced persons commission. Officials from the counter-\nintelligence corps, state department visa officials. In -- in -- I -- I can\u2019t remember a single case\nfrankly, where any one of these officials remembered the specific case that they were asked to\ntestify. Well, after all, during the DP act there were 400,000 visas. That meant 400,000\ninvestigations and 400,000 pre-application interviews. And no reasonable individual could be\nexpected to remember one person as opposed to another, particularly if there wasn\u2019t a -- a\nspecific hooker about that -- that case. But what we could ask them about was what was the\nregular procedure? Did you swear it was -- was -- was the applicant required to swear to the truth\nof what he was saying? What did the applicant need in order to become eligible to be a displaced\nperson, to receive a visa? What were the exclusionary measures? How were they implemented?\nAnd in that way, the witness could take -- offer the judge testimony on how things actually\nworked. And we used those witnesses -- the OSI used those witnesses to introduce\ndocumentation regulations of the international refugee organization, regulations of the d --\nDisplaced Persons Commission. Visa regulations, advisory reports and what have you, that were\nrelevant to the process of how a displaced person entered the United States and what information\nhe was required to offer about his person in order to complete his application.",
        "A: Hajda, yeah.",
        "A: I -- I -- I think the judge wanted to hear that. And -- a-and that certainly was the purpose of\nthose witness -- they couldn\u2019t say anything about Hajda personally, neither of them, as I\nremember. They -- they -- even though it was a small camp, there were only roughly a hundred,\n120 guards there at any one time. I-In that particular camp, the -- the commandant was a\npsychopath who often personally took pleasure in torturing individual prisoners, so he was a\nperson who was fairly well known, even by name, to the prisoners of the camp. It was a small\nprison camp too, there were under a thousand people in the camp, under a thousand Jews. And\nthere was one guard, a particularly cruel guard, who had the bad luck to have a patch over his\neye. And so he was remembered, not necessarily by name, but they all remembered the one with\nthe patch over his eye, and that\u2019s natural. And in fact, the one with the patch over his eye, bad as\nhe was, often got blamed for virtually everything because a -- a -- a -- a survivor witness, in\nremembering bad things that happened also remembered the guy with the patch over his eye, and\nthat the guy with the patch over his eye was a bad guy, and so the connection was made. And in\nmany cases they were right, and in some cases they weren\u2019t right. But Hajda was just one guard\namong many and it -- in -- in that case it was very typical of the survivor\u2019s relationship to the\nnormal -- normal in quotes -- prisoner guar -- the normal guard, that he was a person in a\nuniform, that unless there was some reason to know him on a daily basis, like a prisoner worked\nin a tailor shop and the guard commonly came to the tailor shop to get his boots fixed, there was\nsome relationship that was ongoing. But just a guard on the perimeter was someone that the\nwitness, after 40 years, couldn\u2019t be expected -- it wouldn\u2019t be fair to burden the witness with\ntrying to remember that particular person. And so in this particular case it was made easy for us\nbecause the defendant stipulated to all of the horrors in the Treblinka one camp.",
        "A: He stipulated to that, he said, okay I can see all of that. The issue was, was Bronislaw Hajda\nthe person who was listed as Bronislaw Hajda in the -- in the documentation. And this is why the\njudge was so concerned about the prosecution\u2019s efforts to document exactly what happened to\neach person who was on those two and -- and -- and later three and four when you take Battalion\nStreibel into the process, rosters to document their whereabouts, to convince as in this case the\nOSI did, to convince the judge that the information ab -- of the -- 1 -- contained in these rosters,\nthe personal data and the information as to where these people were, was accurate, and did refer\nto these particular people. And the judge was convinced of that.",
        "A: There was one case that I was on, the Bruno Blach case, where I was personally convinced\nthat the survivor knew -- identified correctly, the individual as a guard. I was never quite certain\nthat he correctly identified the individual as the person who committed a killing, which he did\nidentify. But the reasons that his particular recognition of this person struck me as viable, and I\nsaw him -- I saw him look at the photo spread, and in fact was -- when -- when the person was\nextradited to West Germany, the defendant was extradited to West Germany, I had to testify as a\nwitness, an eyewitness to that identification process. There was no question that the face, the\nlikeness of that picture registered with the -- with the witness in that case, in my mind. I was\nwatching him when he looked at the photo spread, and I knew which photo was the defendant.\nAnd I was not asking the questions, an investigator was asking the questions, I was watching.\nAnd I saw him -- I -- I saw him when he hit that particular photo, flinch. And this was a very\nsmall camp, it was a sub-camp of Mauthausen, about 2000 prisoners, maybe a hundred guards\nand a small squad of guards with canines, about 15 of them. And this was one of the guys with a\ncanine. He was a Sudaten German, and he also had a particularly handsome face. He was -- he\nwas just striking looking. He was someone that one might remember in the context of a small\ngroup of people in a small camp, where the individual who was a Polish prisoner was -- was\nthere for two years, both in -- both prisoner and guard were there for two years. The prisoners all\nworked in one factory, the guards all escorted them every day to that one factory. I don\u2019t know to\nthis day whether the identification of this person as the killer in this case, was accurate. I don\u2019t\nknow to this day. Under interrogation later in the West German proceeding against this\nindividual, the evidence became so contradictory, even as to the identity of the victim of that\nshooting, that the defendant was ultimately acquitted in a criminal trial of the specific murder.\nBut there\u2019s no question in my mind that that face was known to the witness. But that was the\nonly case that I worked on in which I was convinced completely that an eyewitness recognized\nthe defendant.",
        "A: Sure.\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s the -- the bad moral character is a judgment based on the material misrepresentation.\nThat because one lied, the violation is that one made false statements to obtain a federal benefit -",
        "A: -- which citizenship is. And that that indicated that this was a person of bad moral character.\nBut the false statements, again, had to be material.",
        "A: And in these specific cases, they had to cons -- they had to relate to information concealed\nthat could have or would have led to -- led to the uncovery of persecution.\nperson does is confess, but also talk about how they hated what they did, or they changed their\nwhat -- that they -- they\u2019re a different person. Is there ever -- could there ever be an instance\nwhere somebody could be considered -- I don\u2019t know, do I say becomes --",
        "A: Reformed?",
        "A: Now if it -- there\u2019s really two questions. If someone 1s at -- and 1 -- this goes for any\nimmigrant, there\u2019s -- there\u2019s nothing special about the Nazi cases in this. If someone admits to an\nactivity or an affiliation that would make that person ineligible to enter the United States, and if\nit was a long time ago, or if the person could convince the -- the consular official that he or she\ndid in fact renounce that, there\u2019s obviously discretion. There\u2019s -- there\u2019s dis -- there\u2019s discretion\nto permit, to give a visa anyway, the -- each official has discretion. Now, if the person lied and\ngot in on the basis of concealing the information, the theory as I understand it, and it\u2019s probably\nbest to ask the attorneys when you do interview them, the theory as I understand it 1s that\nbecause you lied, in theory if we prove that you lied, your status goes back to where you were\nbefore you obtained the visa, which is as an alien about which we can then determine whether\nyou are eligible to enter the United States. Now, the burden of proof is on the government once\nyou\u2019re here. In other words, the OSI always had the burden of proof in its cases against\nindividuals who are here. But if you\u2019re an alien seeking entry into the United States, the burden\nof proof that you\u2019re eligible is upon the alien. So the alien must convince and demonstrate to the\nimmigration official, and to the consular official, that he is a person, or she is a person eligible to\nenter the United States. We\u2019ve never had to my knowledge, and I can -- I\u2019ve never had a case\nthat I worked on where individuals -- I should maybe strike that, there was one individual who\nconfessed and said that he was sorry, but I couldn\u2019t be sure that he wasn\u2019t just saying that\nbecause now he was caught, and that this was an effort to sort of get some mitigating\ncircumstance. I\u2019ve never had a situation here in the United States where we ran into an individual\nwho was torn up about what he had done because of what it was that he had done --",
        "A: -- not because of the situation he found himself vis-a-vis the immigration authorities. May\nhave played a role, but we have not had people actually come in without us finding them to\nconfess and say that they wish they hadn't done it.",
        "A: So it\u2019s hard to separate --",
        "A: -- the confession from the circumstance in which the defendant or subject finds himself. Been\nthrough some rocky times, and there have been some instances where the families of defendants\nhad no idea, had no clue what the father had done, or had been during the second World War.\nAnd this is certainly a hard thing for the families to suddenly have to deal with this, and they deal\nwith it -- and they\u2019ve dealt with it, at least as far as I\u2019ve seen, in very different -- in different\nways, from outright aggression against the government to really despair over who they are and\nwhere they came from. But no, we\u2019ve never had a situation where we could be sure -- where I\ncould be sure, I can only speak for myself, that the remorse was unconnected to the situation of\nhaving been caught in the lie.",
        "A: In some cases.",
        "A: I-I think it varies.",
        "A: I think it varies. What -- what I was saying was that in some cases the children and -- and\npossibly even the spouse, particularly if the subject met the spouse after the war, or met her here\nin the United States, they have no clue that subject X -- that husband and father X was a\nconcentration camp guard, or was a shooter in a -- in a police squad in the east. And it\u2019s got to be\nshocking information if you had no idea before that.",
        "A: There are some cases where the spouse at least knows, or suspects, and perhaps there are\nsome cases where the children know to a c -- to a certain degree, but I have seen cases where\nthey didn\u2019t. And that this was a complete surprise.",
        "A: That -- that\u2019s pretty hard to determine --",
        "A: -- because the only time that we -- we the historians, at any rate, saw the families, if at all,\nwas at the pre -- in -- pre-filing interview, if there was one. At the post-filing deposition, where\nthe testimony of the defendant is -- is obtained on the record, or sometimes at trial, but\nsometimes not. So often we -- if -- 1f a spouse or a son, wa -- who would now be grown, was --\nwas present, we\u2019d sometimes see the reaction of the spouse or the son to what they were hearing.\nAnd sometimes it was -- seemed apparent, or sometimes it seemed likely that they were hearing\nthis for the first time. But it\u2019s hard to know what would happen, at least in my ey -- since I didn\u2019t\nfollow the families in many of the -- these cases, it\u2019s hard to know what their ultimate -- what the\nultimate affect of this case was on the family life.",
        "A: Most of them were living fairly ordinary middle class, or lower middle class lives. There were\na few that had made it quite well, and there were a few that were sort of on the margins. But with\nrare exceptions, they were not, as such, lawbreakers, in the United States.",
        "A: Well, that -- that\u2019s an interesting question. The way I look at it is -- 1s another way, in that it\u2019s\nimportant for all of us, I think, as ordinary, if that --",
        "A: -- is a meaningful word, as ordinary citizens of a society, that there be at least the potential, if\nwe do something like what was done during the second World War, regardless of the\ncircumstances in which the individual found himself, whether he was compelled to do it, or\nwhether he did it out of his own a -- a -- as a volunteer, that there be some possibility of legal\nconsequence for that, no matter how many years go by, in terms of that type of crime, I -- I feel -\n- in a recent news reports of the proceedings against the Chilean -- former Chilean dictator,\nAugusto Pinochet, that this -- though there are legal problems at every stage, there\u2019s serious legal\nproblems, the idea that our world, as a world society now, is no longer prepared to sweep\nresponsibility for crimes in an official position, where an official abuses the law and causes death\nand suffering to people in his care, or her care, if in the future, that -- that there shouldn\u2019t be\nsome, somewhere down the line, the possibility of legal consequence for that. So I\u2019m quite\ncomfortable with that for these particular crimes. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a believer that\npeople can\u2019t -- that I believe that people can\u2019t be re -- rehabilitated, but I do believe that people\nneed to take responsibility for what they\u2019ve done.",
        "A: Even if it\u2019s something that they were compelled to do. I guess the ideal for me personally,\nwould be to get to a point where each one of us has a sense that there are certain things that\nwe\u2019re not going to do, that it -- it\u2019s better to die than to do.",
        "A: And there was one statement, Soviet protocol of a former Trawniki man, who made this\nstatement, and regardless of what you might say about Soviet protocols, this clearly wasn\u2019t -- it\nwas so unusual that it clearly wasn\u2019t canned. The individual involved had been a Soviet soldier\nwho was captured and was selected out of a Soviet prisoner of war camp, where he probably\nwould have starved had he not been selected for service at Trawniki. And he stated, after having\nserved as a Trawniki trained guard -- and I can\u2019t remember where he served, he stated to his\ninterrogator after the war, to his Soviet interrogator, that it would have been better for me had I\ndied in that prison camp. And if we are at a stage where there are things of that nature, that we as\nhuman beings will not do to other human beings, even faced with death, dictatorships are going\nto have a hard time carrying out mass murders. And one element of that is at least having some\npotential of legal consequence for participation in that kind of crime.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I -- is the question you\u2019re asking, how can someone who\u2019s done something like this --",
        "A: -- just turn it all off --",
        "A: -- and become a normal citizen? Obviously it\u2019s different --",
        "A: -- for different people, but clearly this was an extraordinary time. And many of those who\nparticipated in it as perpetrators, as well as those who experienced it as victims, recognize that it\nwas an extraordinary time in which things were done that you don\u2019t normally do. Many of the\nperpetrators, certainly most of the perpetrators that were prosecuted by OSI were youngsters.\nTeenagers, or late teens, early 20\u2019s when this process began for them. So it was, sadly, a part of\ntheir maturing process, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily a part of their quote normal unquote behavior.\nOnce it was over, once there was no authority, no compuls -- no authority to encourage, or\ncompulsion to compel to participate in those acts, for many it was not that hard to rationalize\nwhat had happened, and even to say, well from now on I\u2019m going to be a good citizen. From now\non -- even perhaps because of this past, I\u2019m going to be very careful about the laws in my new\ncountry. For the perpetrators, in many ways, those who came to the new world, they were\nstarting, particularly the young ones, they were starting as much of a new life, sadly, as the\nsurvivors, with much less right to do so.",
        "A: Trifa, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I thought of these particular four cases, in fact three are fairly similar. Schellong\nis a concentration camp guard at an officer level. Bartesch is a concentration camp guard at -- at\nthe grunt level.",
        "A: And Hajda is also a concentration camp guard at the grunt level in a different system.",
        "A: When I chose those cases, the -- the thing they had in common, other than the fact that I was\nassigned to them, and they were meaningful to me because I was with each one of them, in a\nsense, from beginning -- well, Trifa not quite, but from beginning to end, was that each in its\nown way reflected a rather unique feature of advancing the role of the historian, or advancing the\nnature of the research that went into dev -- the development of these cases. Schellong was the\nfirst concentration camp case.",
        "A: The -- that -- the first WVHA concentration camp case --",
        "A: -- that we had. We\u2019d had -- Federenko was a Treblinka guard before that, we\u2019d had -- I don\u2019t\nthink we\u2019d had another concentration camp case before that. So the whole WVHA system, the\nwhole concept of protective arrest, the camps in the era before the war, this was something that\nhistorically new ground had to be broken in terms of how we presented that evidence. It was also\nmy first case, so it was the first -- 1t was my learning process, and I worked together with two\nexcellent attorneys, Joe Lynch and Janet DeCosta, who were very flexible about giving me the\nautonomy to do what I felt needed to be done. It was an excellent working relationship, and I --\nfor me, it developed the model of the working relationship between the do -- two professions,\nwhich despite all the names and epithets we call one another, look at evidence in not always so\ndissimilar ways. A-An-And certainly are capable and have in many cases, collaborated quite well\nin the presentation, not only of a good case, but of a fairly good historical record as well.",
        "A: The attorneys that I have worked with on cases, it\u2019s a very good relationship, it\u2019s based on\nmutual respect, it\u2019s based on a mutual understanding of what each of us -- and -- and each of us\nas representatives of our profession, can contribute to the development of this case, and the p-\npresent -- an-and the successful presentation of the case before a judge. And it\u2019s a good dynamic,\nI think. It worked -- it -- it worked very, very well from the first case, the Schellong case, to the\nlast case I worked on, which was the Hajda case, there were rarely -- I-I\u2019m not -- that\u2019s not to say\nthat there weren\u2019t arguments and -- and screaming matches from time to time which were -- were\n-- were a part of the workplace.",
        "A: But there was always a -- a mutual understanding that we needed one another --",
        "A: -- very much, 1n order to do what our common aim was, was to u-u-uncover the individual\u2019s\nresponsibility for the violation and to make possible the appropriate adjudication of the case.\nAnd that was a common goal, and despite whatever conflicts there were, there was always that\nreturn to the cooperation, and in -- in my case, I -- I have to say there were relatively fle -- few\nconflicts.",
        "A: I mean, that it -- it was a -- a normal and healthy working relationship from -- for 20 years.",
        "A: The Schellong case was actually a fairly simple case. It was -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I think it, if I\nremember correctly, Schellong was identified as being in the United States in approximately\nMarch 1980, and he was removed from the United States in \u201983 or \u201984. That was after\ndenaturalization, deport, and all the -- all the -- all the appeals processes in between. Which is a\nrelatively short time.",
        "A: The trial was in the summer of 1981, it\u2019s 18 months, which isn\u2019t -- it isn\u2019t a very long time to\nput together a case. So the mechanics of the case -- most of the material was in the United States,\nsome of it was in the Federal Republic of Germany, but most of it was in the United States, easy\nto get ahold of, easy to have certified, easy to have translated. What was special about the case\nfrom my perspective, was the fact that it was this learning process, of learning what was needed\nof me, as a historian, to make this case go. And learning -- learning to understand the perspective\nof the attorneys, to understand, at least in what they would call a minimal way, how the rules of\nthe courtroom affect the presentation of evidence, and how to reconcile, as much as possible, the\nhistorical record with the rules of evidence. And I think where we were successful in doing that,\nwe had not only winning cases, but cases that -- that offer something to history as well. With\nTrifa, I -- I mentioned it earlier, that -- that Trifa had special aspects to his defense which\nrequired a much broader and deeper analysis of each particular segment of that case, and they\nwere broken down essentially into the 10 segments that you -- that you had to carry around and\nread over the last couple of weeks.",
        "A: With Bartesch, which we haven\u2019t talked much about --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yes, at Dachau.\nand so I wonder -- suppose he had trained these people outside of Dachau. Would that have been\nas much of a problem?",
        "A: If the --",
        "A: If the purpose of the training was to train concentration camp guards, if the concentration\ncamp guards are assisting 1n persecution, certainly the person who trains them 1s also assisting in\npersecution. It s -- would have been an issue if, as a practical matter -- that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s theory, as\na practical matter, if he had been training them in basic guard detail, where the guardi -- 1-it\ncould be guarding prisoners or guarding buildings at a site away from the concentration camp,\nthat would have been a harder case to make.",
        "A: The case that would have had to have been made would have been the case that he was\ntraining these men to be concentration camp guards, and this is what it means to be a\nconcentration camp guard. And that would, in our estimation when we brought the case, would\nconstitute participation in persecution, or assistance in persecution.",
        "A: I can\u2019t recall that. I suspect it was the defense at that point --",
        "A: -- but it -- that was really the issue to a certain degree, that was decided by the Supreme Court\nin Federenko, which was -- the Supreme Court decision came down in 1980 in Federenko, which\nwas right before the Schellong case, that it didn\u2019t matter whether Federenko personally beat,\nassaulted or -- or -- or hurt a prisoner in any way. Just the fact that he was guarding was --",
        "A: -- constituted assistance in persecution, that a camp guard, a member of a camp guard unit, by\ndoing his daily duties, was assisting in persecution.",
        "A: And that was the issue that was ultimately decided in Schellong, and that was the issue that --\nthat -- that form that pr -- precedent comes from Federenko that formed the precedent for the e --\nevery subsequent case that involved a concentration camp.",
        "A: Bartesch was unique for me in that it was the one case where there was credible evidence,\nperhaps not beyond a reasonable doubt evidence, but certainly clear and convincing evidence\nthat he, Martin Bartesch shot someone on whom a name could be pinned. And it was also\ninteresting in how that evidence came up, and how it was found. We had a series of\nconcentration camp cases related to Mauthausen, and th -- and this is a -- a good example of how\nOSI operates. The Bruno Blach case, which I was assigned to, involved a sub-camp of\nMauthausen, and that case was already under investigation as early as 1980. In investigating that\ncase during the mid-80\u2019s when I investigated it, I went to the National Archives, to look through\neach of the U.S. military trials of Mauthausen personnel, that U.S. military personnel had\nconducted at the site of the Dachau concentration camp, in the records of the Judge Advocate\nGeneral. Here -- at that time it was downtown here in -- well, no, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sorry, at that time it\nwas at Sootland, at the Sootland repository, now they\u2019re up in College Park, Maryland. And in\nthe process of looking through all of that stuff, Bruno Blach was never at the main camp except\nfor one day, he was transferred right away to a sub-camp called Wiener Neudorf. But in the\nprocess of identifying everyone whom I could, who went through the Mauthausen system, I\ngathered documentation from all of the Mauthausen and sub-camp trials so that I could put\ntogether an effective report eventually on how a person like Bruno Blach would come from\nDachau, where he was before, via Mauthausen to Wiener Neudorf. Among the records that I\nfound and didn\u2019t pay too much attention to at the time was a -- oh, it must have been about a\nhundred, 120 page document called an unnatural death book, unnatiirliches Todesfalle. U-Un --\nc-cases of unnatural death. Which was a log kept by the authorities of the central camp of\nMauthausen of all unnatural deaths that were unplanned unnatural. That didn\u2019t mean that they\nweren\u2019t planned, but 1t meant a -- a prisoner -- 1f some guards were having fun, and pushed a\nprisoner towards the wire, the guard shot, he was dead. That was recorded. I found it useful, has -\n- has names of guards, I copied it, but filed it because there were -- I did actually do more than\nfile it because there were a couple of cases of shootings in Wiener Neudorf. Not by Bruno Blach,\nbut by others and that\u2019s evidence that if an expert witness wants to say prisoners were shot trying\nto escape at Wiener Neudorf, and the judge or the defense asks well, what do you base that on?\nWhat evidence? And then you have this log. Here so and so was shot on such and such a day,\nand by the way by this ga -- by this particular guard. Not Bruno Blach, but we have records of\nthis. Now as it turned out, during that search I also found a Nuremberg document, 2176 PS,\nwhich was a collection of records that Mauthausen camp prisoners secured from destruction after\nthe war, upon liberation, and turned over to the U.S. army investigator investigating crimes at\nMauthausen from the day that the camp was liberated. He was a major named Eugene Cohen,\nwho we actually found after the war and talked to after the war, although this case never went to\ntrial, and so he -- therefore he was not a witness. But among these records were a series of rosters\nof Mauthausen guards, both at the main camp and at some of the sub-camps. And those rosters\ncontained birthdates and ranks, and even last known addresses, what address that they had before\nthey came to Mauthausen, before they entered German service. And so -- a-and again in -- in\naccordance with standard operating procedure at OSI we turned these over to the research and\ndevelopment department, and they ran them through the INS. And Martin Bartesch came up\nalong with three others as a hit. And we then, in going back -- I had the Mauthausen cases\noriginally, in the mid-80\u2019s. In going back through the documentation, I came back to this book of\nunnatural cases of death, and started reading each of the entries. And sure enough, Bartesch,\nMartin was assigned as a guard who shot a French Jewish teenager on such and such a date, I\nthink it was October 1943. Bartesch himself was a teenager at that time. Bartesch was born, I\nbelieve in October 1926. I think 1t was October of \u201926, and so he was not quite 17, or just turned\n17 when he shot a teenager, who I believe was 15 or 16 or 17, about the same age. And we also\nfound another one of the cases, another one of the subjects who had come up on the roster was\nalso on the list as having shot another French Jew at around the same time. And in that other\ncase, which was the case of Stefan Riley, that individual actually confessed to having shot at a\nperson whose name he didn\u2019t know, when confronted with that information. Both cases never\nwent to trial because both individuals I believe -- Bartesch before -- Bartesch went without a\nlawyer, quickly. In fact, I think it was the same lawyer who later turned up in the Hajda case.\nBartesch was also from Chicago, so the fact that this guy represented Bartesch, made him known\nto Hajda as well, later, I think. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know that for sure, but I do -- I do think\nCollins was also Bartesch\u2019s lawyer. Bartesch pled -- refused to talk to us, as was his right as a\ncitizen. And was protected from doing so by his attorney, and fled to Austria before --",
        "A: -- I think even bef -- it\u2019s conceivable that it was even before we filed, but it might have been\nafter we filed, just don\u2019t remember any more. But he did flee to Austria, and I believe he was\ndenaturalized after -- yes, he was a citizen.

        "A: Bartesch, I don\u2019t -- I think the Austrians -- I don\u2019t really know. I think the Austrians did a pro\nforma, opened a pro forma case, but Bartesch died shortly after, even though he was still a\nrelatively young man. Riley, I -- I -- is presumably dead by now, but at the last I heard he was\nstill alive, which would be late 80\u2019s.",
        "A: The Hajda case was significant for me for two reasons. Three reasons, really. It was the first\ncase that I as a historian with the attorney, the partner this time was someone I -- one of my very\nbest and closest friends in the off -- in the OSI, Ned Stuttman. This was the first case that we had\nactually gone to trial with using primarily evidence that came as a result of the collapse of the\nCommunist regimes in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. This case was built, not\nexclusively, but at least three-quarters -- 75 percent of the evidence was evidence that was taken\nfrom witnesses, or found in documentation that had been held behind the Iron Curtain since\n1945. And it also represented our first, as an office, our first extensive use of post-war Soviet\nprotocols, of witness interrogations, where we no longer had the witness alive to be cross-\nexamined. And we used them very, very carefully in that we didn\u2019t accept them all at face value.\nWe were up front about our doubts about the conditions under which this testimony was taken.\nWe were also up front about the possibility that Soviet investigators at that time had specific\ninformation that was going into that protocol whether the witness said it or not. But we used\nthem where the evidence contained in them was consistent with documentation, whether it was\ntestimony given in the west, or captured German documentation, either captured by the western\npowers or by the Soviets, where the information was consistent, we could regard this evidence in\nthe protocols as cooperative evidence. In other words, it didn\u2019t stand alone, but just because it\nwas protocols taken, quite frankly, by Soviet intelligence agents, didn\u2019t mean necessarily that we\nas investigators could, a priori say this is all phony, this is all fake. We had to look at that\nevidence the way any historian -- and here in a sense the lawyers went the way of the historians,\nthe way any historian looks at any evidence, with no a priori preconceptions, a priori suspicions\nbut testing those elements of the testimony that made good historical sense, and being aware of\nthose elements of the testimony which one should rightfully have doubts about. And I can give\nyou an example. There were statements of former Treblinka guards, who identified Hajda, and\nthere was a whole issue, as you probably saw, about the spelling of Hajda, because the Polish --\nthe s -- the -- the sound of Hajda, there\u2019s no H in Russian, and the interrogations were always in\nRussian. There\u2019s no H. The Russians replace H with the Cyrillic equivalent of the --",
        "A: -- the English, or the Roman G, and so it was always Gajda, and there were any variation of\nGajda, it could be G-a-1-d-a. It could be G-a-y-d-a, it could be G-a-y apostrophe d-a. And there\nwas any number of variations of that. And then of course there were the obvio -- the -- the\nmisspellings, and the mistranslations, and the -- the misspellings in the translation. But there\nwere certain testimonies that identified Hajda as a Pole. Now the Russians -- the Soviets didn\u2019t\nhave Hajda. Hajda was in the United States, they didn\u2019t have him. He was only of interest to\nthem in that he was a name, another identification. There\u2019s no evidence that they even knew that\nhe was in the United States, although the Soviets knew about many of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s who were in\nthe United States. There was no interest because he was Polish, and because Poland was also a\nCommunist country, that the Soviets were interested in extraditing him. But there were some\nwitnesses who testified that Hajda was a Pole, even though most of the rest of the people -- a\nPole was an anomaly among the Trawniki men. There were very small Polish recruiting drives,\nand there were only two of them who ever served at Treblinka one, two Poles. And not every\nwitness said Hajda was a Pole. If every witness had said Hajda was a Pole, then one would have\nbeen suspicious. If every witness had gotten the first name right, one would be suspicious. But\nsome of them got the first name, some didn\u2019t. Some got the wrong first name. Some didn\u2019t\nremember a first name at all, they just remembered a g -- a Hajda who was a Pole. And in a\ngroup of a hundred guards, that is more credible. On the other hand, you would get testimonies\nwhere the Soviet interrogator was clearly asking to identify what people were involved in the\nmassacre of the surviving Jewish prisoners when the camp was evacuated in July 1944. And\nthere you\u2019d have a list of 40 names. So and so -- I know so and so participated in the murder of\n350 prisoners on the day that the camp was evacuated. The next guy would -- the s -- the exact\nsame thing. The next guy would the exact same thing. And then you get Hajda\u2019s name, the exact\nsame thing. As a historian, I tended to discount. Didn\u2019t mean that Hajda didn\u2019t participate, but I\ndiscounted that evidence as something that Soviet interrogators were interested in getting it\nbecause of the r -- the repeated question, it was just plugging a name into this statement, that they\nwanted. It was the oddities, the things that were different, that could be corroborated by other\nevidence, and Hajda\u2019s Polish origins were corroborated by personnel documents, and his place of\nbirth. That could be used in these statements. We, in prosecuting the case, never charged that\nHajda personally participated in the killings. We did charge that he was there at the time the\nkillings happened, and we did describe, as you read, in -- in some detail, what the guards, the\nhundred of them, you know, there were a hundred, hundred and 10, were doing while these\nkillings were taking place. So the judge had the data to make a judgment that well, we don\u2019t\nknow what Hajda was doing, but we know he was participating in some way, because guards\nweren\u2019t sitting around. They were all doing one thing, either guarding the people who were\nguarding the perimeter of the camp while the people were being taken out to the woods in groups\nto be shot, guarding those who were left in the camp while the rest were being taken out to be\nshot, escorting groups to the camp, or actually shooting them. It was one of those things, all the\nguards were involved in that because that\u2019s what they were doing on that day. And that was\nbased on the Soviet protocols, and the primary source documentation. And we were able to prove\nthat Hajda was there because of a group of documents from the successor unit of the Trawniki\ntraining camp, the Battalion Streibel. There was a group of 20 men, all still working with the\ncommandant of Treblinka one, who as well was evacuated. Every one of those 20 men were on\nrosters at Treblinka one. So it made no sense, it made no common sense, this was a common\nsense issue for Hajda not to have been there at the time of the killings, and still be on that post-\nevacuation roster with 20 other men who are all at the camp throughout, from 1943 through its\nevacuation in 1944.\nphotograph, am I right? And yet you have fingerprints from almost all the other people. Was\nthere some significance to that or didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, there -- this was a -- a particular problem, it was -- it was an interesting case. It was --\nwas one of the reasons why we had to go into such detail concerning the personnel data of each\nof the people on the two Treblinka rosters, the one from March 22\" in which -- when Hajda was\nsent to Treblinka one, and the sort of inventory roster of 1944, approximately March 30\" -- 30\",\n1944. Hajda\u2019s personnel file was missing. We didn\u2019t have his personnel file. When we finally --\nwhen our investigator -- our historical investigators, those who could read Russian, finally got\naccess to the records of the Trawniki trained guards in the federal security -- the archive of this\nFederal Security Service of the Russian Federation in the early 90\u2019s, they found the notes of the\nKGB investigator who saw that file, and the notes that he took were consistent with the type of\ninformation that was on other personnel files. So it was clear that there was a personnel file of\nHajda. And later we were able to actually track where that file went. It went with a bunch of\npersonnel files to Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union in 1949. And tragically,\ntragically, this was very frustrating. It was, a-according to the Ukrainian authorities, 1t was\ndestroyed in the spring of 1992. The case was filed in the summer of 1992. So before we made a\nrequest of the Ukrainians, 1t was destroyed, as the Ukrainian says, part of a normal documents\ndestruction process.",

        "A: But there was -- the father\u2019s testimony in itself wouldn\u2019t have been enough. The father used\nlanguage that -- well, I don\u2019t remember exactly what the father said, but the father\u2019s knowledge\nwas a little less direct. He only said that his son was in service with the Germans, or it was some\n-- something vague like that, I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was. The sister, if I remember\ncorrectly, used a ter -- the German term Wachmannschaft, which happened to be the term\ndescribing -- Wachmannschaft was something -- it was the term that described a part of the\nBattalion Streibel. And she used the term Wachmannschaften in Jedrzejow. And Jedrzejow is\ncity in central -- south central Poland, along the vistu -- Vistula River, where the Trawniki men\nwere evacuated in July 1944, in order to press gang forced Polish laborers into building\nfortifications along the vis -- Vistula. You -- you\u2019ll remember from your history that the Red\nArmy was stopped on the Vistula in front of Warsaw, and all up and down the Vistula, the\noffense ran out of steam, and the next offensive didn\u2019t come until January 1945. So these\nTrawniki men had, between July 1944, late July 1944, and the middle of January 1945, they were\non the Vistula River, supervising local forced labor, digging fortifications on the west side of the\nVistula. She knew either -- and I can\u2019t remember now, either she visited him or she got a letter\nfrom him that he was in the Wachmannschaften in Jedrzeyow. Now there was nothing that was\nparticularly horrible about -- yeah, bad things happened there, but it wasn\u2019t like Treblinka. It\nwasn\u2019t like Belzec, it wasn\u2019t like Trawniki. It was a later time that seemed to be no conceivable\nreason for Polish investigators in 1945 -- remember, this was January \u201945, this was before the\nSoviet offensive that liberated Jedrzejow. This family is in -- near Zakopane, on the other side of\nthe Vistula, they\u2019re being interrogated, and here she is saying that he is in the\nWachmannschaften in Jedrzejow. Now he was in a company, but the headquarters of the Streibel\nbattalion was in fact at that time in Jedrzejow. And that was convincing to me as a historian, to\nthe attorneys as prosecutors and ultimately to the expert and to the judge, that in fact, Bronislaw\nHajda was in the Streibel battalion, and gave a tremendous amount of authenticity to our use of\nall of those rosters, because the Streibel bat -- if the Streibel battalion rosters, which contained\nsimilar information to the Treblinka rosters, were valid -- and -- an-and not -- not only in the\nsense of authenticity, but in terms of the accuracy of the information, the accuracy of the\npersonnel data, and the accuracy of where these place -- where these units were stationed, that\ngave greater credibility, because of the names on the Streibel battalion rosters, to the names on\nthe Treblinka rosters. And it gave an e -- extra added push of credibility to the paper. And that\u2019s\nhow paper and witness testimony can corroborate one another, whereas a reasonable person\nmight have questions about either one, but the exact fit, that just wouldn\u2019t happen if you were\nforging.",

As I said before, the\nSoviets never sent us one of those. They may have made them but they never sent us one of\nthose. And we tested plenty. But that kind of connection, that this woman, interrogated by Polish\nauthorities in January 1945, while her brother, and the German authorities were still in\nJedrzejow, that she would know Wachmannschaft in Jedrzejow in January 1945, that\u2019s not\nsomething forgers hit -- at that time, could have created. Now, we tested that document, and\nfound it to be a document that did -- our experts found it to be a document that did originate in\n1945, and from Polish authorities.",

But even if -- even if the Polish authorities had beaten the hell out of her\nto get that information, there\u2019s no way that they could have known in January 1945 that this was\na Wachmannschaft, that that\u2019s what the unit was called -- basically means guard unit, or that it\nwas stationed in Jedrzejow.",

        "A: Almost exactly.",
        "A: Yes, I do take a -- a strong professional and personal satisfaction in having worked at OSI. I\nlearned a lot at OSI. I learned through, as I said when I -- at my good-bye dinner, and -- and there\nmay have been some surprised to hear it, I said that working with the attorneys over that many\nyears had taught me how to be a better historian. And certainly the need to prove things from\nscratch had taught me how to question assumptions that we so easily take for granted, that may\nor may not be based on actual evidence. And to really look at the evidence, and draw one\u2019s\nconclusion from the primary source evidence. To give you an example of that, it\u2019s common\nknowledge -- and I put that in quotations, that the Nazis like to give their auxiliaries alcohol\nbefore sending them out on a mission. Everybody says that, and in fact, witnesses talk about\nauxiliaries being drunk while they were shooting. But, in all the hundreds of statements of\nTrawniki men that I read, and in all the documents of Trawniki -- relating to Trawniki trained\nguards, there\u2019s nothing about issuing of alcohol rations prior to an operation. And in fact, when\nyou think of it, it makes no sense. You don\u2019t give men whom you\u2019re going to put rifles in their\nhands, and whom you may not entirely trust, alcohol to drink, for fear of nothing else that they\u2019 II\nshoot each other, or they\u2019! shoot you instead of the people they\u2019re supposed to shoot. But why\nwere -- why did witne -- were witnesses wrong when they saw some of them drunk? No, not in\nthe cases of the Trawniki men, because of during the shooting and during deportations, the\nTrawniki were constantly extorting on their own whatever valuables, whether it be cash or booze\nthat the victims had. Sometimes it was cash and they turned it into booze, so that some of the\nauxiliaries did have booze, and did partake of booze prior to a operation, and that\u2019s -- so what the\nwitnesses saw, what the survivors saw, what they perceived to have seen was not entirely\ninaccurate. But the assumption that was drawn, that everybody just kind of believed, was\ninaccurate.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, I wanted to continue 1-1n terms of professionally satisfying, it was professionally\nsatisfying cause of reasons that I had discussed, in terms of learning how to become a better\nhistorian, in terms of getting access to records that might not have thought, or been able to get\naccess to had I not been with the Justice Department. Becoming interested in areas such as the\nauxiliary police, and Poland, and the Trawniki trained guards that might not have come across\nmy radar screen as serious interests had I not been at OSI. The a-ability to put these pieces\ntogether in -- in original formulations. Subjects that nobody had written about because there was\nno public evidence available for people to construct a thesis on. This was all professionally very\nsatisfying as a historian, I think prepared me in many ways, broadened me in many, many ways,\nthat made me perhaps better pra -- prepared to take over the position of the senior historian at the\nHolocaust Memorial Museum. Personally, I find it very satisfying because as a federal civil\nservant I felt that I was doing a service to the American people in the sense that, having grown\nup in the Vietnam generation, I was contributing to a process where individuals who committed\ncrimes during wartime, with all the excuses that one has to commit acts of atrocity during\nwartime, were being called to account, despite the fact that they were small fry. Despite the fact\nthat in some cases they were compelled to be in the positions where they eventually committed\ntheir crimes. Despite the fact that decades and decades had passed, and that there was some\nreason for them to feel that this would never come back to haunt them. That this was a process, a\njudicial process, a fair process by which people who had committed crimes could be called to\naccount. And if there is a potential for that in the future, conceivably the perpetrators of the\nfuture might stop to think twice before perpetrating crimes along the lines of these crimes that\nwere perpetrated during the second World War. And if that potential of legal consequence even\nworks to prevent one killing, I feel that it would be worth that effort, both for the future in terms\nof prevention, and in terms of bringing closure to the past.",

And that this 1s something that\nif we are going to have the immigration laws that we do, that we shouldn\u2019t make an exception, a\nlenient exception for Nazi offenders. There are some of these people who were real small fries,\nand I -- I can\u2019t say that I feel glee that their lives in America are destroyed by the processes that\nwe institute against them. And frankly for their families, particularly the families that knew\nnothing about what the defendant had done, this is -- this can be really tragic. On the other hand,\nI go back to the people -- 1f people are going to kill in a wartime situation, and they\u2019re going to\nkill illegally, at some point it\u2019s very important for all of us who survive those things, and who\nmight have to undergo them in the future, that we know that that won\u2019t ever go away, that there\nwill be some consequence for that action during the second World War, that there will some\nconsequence for those who commit crimes during the Yugoslav civil war, that there will be some\nconsequence for those who committed crimes in Rwanda.

        "A: I -- | -- I think that efforts to represent a judicial process as a history of the events that are\nrelevant to the crime is a mistake, although it\u2019s one commonly made. I certainly came to OSI, or\nthe SLU at that time with the excitement of being able to write history and convey history to a\nbroader public, to historians, but also to a broader public through the legal process, and I\u2019ve\ncome to realize that a legal proceeding is just that, it has a specific purpose, and that is to\nascertain a violation or a crime, a civil case violation and criminal case a crime, to ascertain a\ndefendant, to assign or determine what the responsibility of the defendant is, and to determine an\nappropriate punishment for the crime. I think as a result of that, or at least as a result of an\ninvestigation, a part of the historical record, whether it\u2019s through witness testimony, perpetrator\nor survivor, or through documentation that otherwise would not have been uncovered, or would\nnot have been uncovered as quickly, can push forward a broader but different process of trying to\nunderstand and analyze what happened. I think a trial deals with an individual, or in rare cases a\nsmall group of individuals, to determine their responsibility for very specific events, and to\nunderstand a broader historical process requires a different process. And to expect the justice\nsystem to fulfill that latter purpose, to understand why things happened on a deeper level, those\nwho expect that are going to be disappointed by the judicial process because they\u2019re putting too\nmuch on it, that this is a subject of a broader and more intensive inquiry.\ngroup of people?

I don\u2019t think the argument that most of the guilty don\u2019t get\ntried is any reason not to try the ones a-a-and obtain convictions against the ones who you can\ntry. Because one couldn\u2019t try Al Capone for murder, didn\u2019t mean it was a bad thing to try him for\ntax evasion. And I think it\u2019s very important to set a standard, a fair standard for prosecuting, a-a-\nand in this sense, war crimes like this -- or I hate to call the -- I -- P'Il call them Nazi offenses\nrather than war crimes, are not different from other criminal acts in terms of the need to establish\na consistent and fair process to try these individuals and judge them, and if found guilty, and the\n-- the innocent -- the -- the acquittals are as important as the guilty verdicts for the survival of the\nsystem and for an expectation that the system will be fair, that this is an important process. It has\nalready, to a certain degree, the idea of trying people for crimes committed in other countries,\ndecades after the event, 1s catching on. Pinochet is -- is an example, it\u2019s an interesting example.\nAnd again, if this becomes a habit of political behavior and a legal response to regimes that\nviolate human rights, this might make the world a better place.

On the other hand, given the problems that individual nations\nhave had policing themselves, I wouldn\u2019t exclude it as an alternative method of trying to bring\nsome closure where the society is not prepared to adjudicate it through existing criminal\nprocedures, or where the absence of existing criminal procedures to handle cases like that\nprecludes efforts to actually adjudicate or to prosecute wrongdoers by their peers, who may have\nbeen their former allies or compatriots. It\u2019s an interesting experien -- experiment, and I think it\u2019s\ntoo early to tell if -- I think we need -- we\u2019re going to need another 10 or 20 years to see what the\neffects of it are, because if you keep in mind that not everybody who\u2019s morally responsible is\nlegally --",
        "A: -- responsible enough to obtain a conviction.",
        "A: Whereas the truth and reconciliation process might offer the opportunity to bring some of the\nmoral responsibility out into the open. Might. But it\u2019s too early to -- I\u2019d have to reserve judgment\non that. I think it\u2019s an interesting experien -- e-experiment, particularly if a society is not ready to\nhand down indictments.",
        "A: I think the effect of the Nuremberg trials has been positive, even 55 years later, and I\u2019m\nlooking at two issues. Not only the post-Nuremberg Nazi offender trials, whatever country they\nmight be in, that still go to this day, and that will go until the last perpetrator dies. But also if you\nlook at the Gulf War, it\u2019s really difficult for a nation to attack its neighbor, and annex it any\nmore, without provoking some sort of international reaction. And I suspect that that -- the ability\nto actually fight a war, whether we agree with American intervention or not, to reverse the Iraqi\noccupation and annexation of Kuwait was something that would not necessarily have been\npossible or easy prior to 1945.",
        "A: Has it -- has it --",
        "A: Has it really happened where one country has simply annexed another?",
        "A: The way Iraq annexed Kuwait? I mean, it\u2019s true, the oil -- the oil heightened interest and atten\n-- and attention, there\u2019s no question about that. But the response, the capacity to respond as a\nUnited Nations, rather than just one country defending its interests, defending its economic\ninterests, the capacity to respond as a United Nations seemed much more difficult as it was,\nmuch more realizable than the League of Nations capacity to respond to Nazi aggression.",
        "A: I think it --",
        "A: I think because this was the disintegration of a state in a civil war, the issues were much more\nmurky than they were in the case of Iraq and Kuwait. I don\u2019t think it was only oil. I think the\ninternational issue was much more murky, and the United States and other powers were\nuncertain as to whether there was still a Yugoslavia or whether these new states emerging from\nthe break-up of Yugoslavia were legitimate states. The first --",
        "A: The first nation to accept them --",
        "A: -- was Germany, but Germany had other than humanitarian reasons to do that.",
        "A: Germany was following a traditional pro-Croatian policy.",
        "A: And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s more similar to the response of had the British or the French recognized the\nconfederate states of America, which after all, declared their independence of the union, and\ndetermined to defend itself --",
        "A: -- against the central government that was seeking to essentially destroy that confederate\nnation and reunite it with the United States. Britain and France -- the situation was at that time\nalso very murky. But there was no Nuremberg at that time.",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t think that Nuremberg, that the Nuremberg trials really provides much of a precedent\nof what to do with a nation that is breaking up. The nur -- the international military tribunal was\nestablished to deal with a nation that planned and conceived and waged an aggressive war --",
        "A: -- against other nations. You\u2019ve really got to look at this as -- as a progression. Prior to World\nWar II there was no international apparatus to deal with that. After World War II, with -- with all\nits ineffectiveness, we do now have a United Nations which is going to respond when one\ncountry attacks another. Now, the next step is what do when a country disintegrates, or when one\nminority in a country starts butchering another minority in a country. That\u2019s something that\nperhaps the development of an international court, and the devel -- certainly the development of\nmore cohesive international reaction. Certainly the development of a quicker response in terms\nof providing shelter for refugees, which is something we ought to have learned from the last\nworld war. That all of these initiatives are going to have to come into play in the future. Whether\nwe'll be able to prevent all killings, we as human beings, I\u2019m not talking about we as the United\nStates, but we as citizens of the world, will be able to prevent killings is something no one\u2019s\ngoing to be able to guarantee. But to work towards mitigating killings, to work towards\nproviding sanctuary -- speedy sanctuary for people who might be the victims of killings, and that\n-- that is something that we certainly could have done more quickly in Rwanda at least, and quite\nprobably in Yugoslavia as well. But there -- each situation is different, and we, as citizens of the\nworld again, not just we the United States, or we the west, we as citizens of the world are going\nto have to work towards strategies for dealing with internal disturbances, internal civil wars,\ninternal persecution, in a way that is effective.",
        "A: And spilled into another country.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, and the world is -- the -- there\u2019s -- your -- you\u2019re absolutely right, and that\u2019s -- this -- this\nis a different situation that the Nuremberg Tribunal was never set up to address. This is\nsomething that we now have to deal with in the 21\u2018 century and we now have to develop a\nmeans of preventing, if possible, mitigating if possible, and -- and ultimately adjudicating if\npossible, in a way that is credible to the -- the victims, and credible 1-1f you understand what I\nmean, to the perpetrators as well.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, there\u2019s -- without question, that\u2019s true.",
        "A: Hm. I think in many ways, at the moment -- I'll probably think about and think of 10 things\nthat I\u2019d want to say, but I\u2019m going to be around for awhile, so if -- if it comes again -- but at the\nmoment I think we\u2019ve covered --",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s been a pleasure for me, and I hope that this -- this tape will be helpful in the future.",
