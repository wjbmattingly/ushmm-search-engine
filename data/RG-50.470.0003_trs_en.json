JIM CACIOPPO\nPage l\nJim Cacioppo interview 2/10/95\nSWB: Jim, tell me how it is that you came to Mauthausen and\njust take me right up to the camp the way you drove in and\ntell me what you Saw.\nJIM CACIOPPO: On uh, the first day of the false report of\nthe war's end, we were, I th-th-, I think at Lens, Austria.\nAnd I remember a wild celebration going\u2019 on. The war is\nover. And uh, there were many of the striped uniform, uh,\nconcentration camp people on the streets. And I was called\nin to drive a half track for major Tuthill, two radio\noperators, Major Tuthill and I, to follow a Russian _ staff\ncar, and we took off like mad, following the Russians, and\nI'm not sure what day we were led to Mauthausen, and uh I\nremember driving up the road to the camp, there were be ex\nprisoners going up and down the road. I remember ten\nAustralian soldiers coming up to the track and asking us for\nfood. We gave them our rations, I remember them cutting\ntheir mouths trying to lick the cans out, and we gave then\nall the rations we had. Went on up the hill and parked just\noutside the gate.\nSWB: And then what did you do?\nJIM CACIOPPO: Well we were billeted in what I guess\u2019 were",
        "offices for the camp or uh, guard quarters. And uh, I\nremember the prisoners, their physical condition, so many of\nthem that, on the ground, couldn't rise, they had to _ be\nlifted to their feet. A kitchen came that day or the next\nand food was given to them. Many of them died from eating.\nW-jJ-1it was just too rich for them and, kitchens changed to a\nthin soup.

There were a lot of bodies in the\nguarry, 100 maybe, 200 I don't know.\nSWB: Did people talk to you, did they react to you?\nJIM CACIOPPO: Oh they, yes, they were very glad to see us,\nso many of them, uh, I remember being taken to the gas\nchambers, led to the gas chambers, and uh crematoriums by\nprisoners, and uh, I remember a pile of weapons, rifles,\npistols, and uh, I re- I remember a prisoner digging through\nfor pistols to give to us. And uh, it seemed to be a big\nthing for him that he was, I remember two Polish men, who\nhad been prisoners, I-I was called out probably the next",
        "morning, I was called out to guard the two Polish men anda\nyoung boy who was fourteen, fifteen years old. They had\nkilled a, one of the German guards. And I sat out there in\nthe sunshine with the three of them for quite a while that\nmorning, and we were really enjoying being together. They\nasked if the boy could go get some water, and I-I remember\nthinking he won't come back, and he didn't, but I wasn't at\nany trouble. It was forgotten. I don't think anything was\never done about him. But I spent I think most of the\nmorning with those there and uh, my first encounter with\nanything, anything like that that uh, I remember the rock\nquarry, rock quarry was still 100 or 200 bodies in the\nguarry, and I remember the engineers digging graves, and I,\nI don't know where, I think on the road up to the camp, they\nwere digging three four five graves that were 100 to _ 150\nfeet long. I remember civilians from the surrounding\nvillages I guess, bringing wagon loads of bodies to the\ngraves and then placing them in the graves. Our army\nchaplains uh giving the last rites to the bodies as they\nwere placed in there. I suppose we were there for... a\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. JIM CACIOPPO\nPage 3",

What did you see there?\nJIM CACIOPPO: I-I hadn't, no experience with a thing like\nthat and-and didn't see how it could happen, how-how a\npeople could be in any way associated with a thing Jlike\nthat. I suppose there are people in this country that are\nthe same. It's uh, th-th-th the ovens and the gas chambers,\nit was a horrible thing. It was new to al- to all of us\nand... we knew of no mistreatment of people, mistreatment of\nprisoners of war, or anything. And it was, it was\nSickening, that uh...\nSWB: We're just about to run out, so I want to put on\nanother roll of film.\n[CAMERA RELOAD]",

You mean, former guards?\nYes, I went through, I remember walking through the cell\nblocks, and uh, seeing the, quite a few of the ex-guards had\nbeen captured and were in the cells. In fact, the one that\nwas killed by the two Poles was killed in his cell. I think\nhe was shot, I'm not sure, I don't know.\nSWB: What did, did you go in and look at any of them or\ntalk to any of them?\nJIM CACIOPPO: The German guards? No. Uh, I was just full\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int.

        "SWB: What about revenge, other instances of revenge, did\nyou know of any, did you witness any?\nJIM CACIOPPO: No.\nSWB: When you came into the camp, can you tell me roughly\nhow many Americans there were and then how many prisoners\nthere were I mean, just a sense of the, of what it was like.\nJIM CACIOPPO: Prisoners, uh r-, many many hundreds, uh.\nAnd a lot of them I think had left the camp. Because we did\nsee them on the roads. We saw them in Lens, and I don't know\nif they were from Mauthausen, Gousen, Or where. Uh,\nAmericans, I don't know. I lived with them all the time.\nSWB: When you guys came to the camp, what was your purpose\nthere?\nJIM CACIOPPO: I really didn't know, I was just driving for\nMajor Tuthill, liaison, whatever it was and. I-I-I believe\nmajor Tuthill was responsible for sending for hospitals,\ndoctors, kitchens, food. I-I remember kitchens a day or two\nlater or maybe the next day, I'm not sure.\nSWB: Describe to me again the condition of the prisoners.\nJIM CACIOPPO: Some of them seemed healthy.
