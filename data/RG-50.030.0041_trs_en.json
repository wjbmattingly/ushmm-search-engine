But if you still have somebody who loves you, cares about you, who look after you, even\nif you don't have nothing to eat, even when you don't have, when you live three or four\nfamilies in two rooms, you know there's somebody there who will protect you. So when\nyou're a child you don't pay much attention. You play hop...hop scotch, you go to, I mean,\nthere were no schools, but we had little classes. People were teaching us. People, all the\npeople were getting together, having meetings until somebody talk about them, tell the\nGermans; then when they start, because the ghetto was closed and they were watching us.\nMine dad could go back to Sosnowiec everyday to work.

Mine uncles, mine uncles, the Germans took them\nright away to a place and...I forgot how they called the place and I remember they were, they\nwere hitting on the head of mine uncles. I know, because I went there because I was a little\nkid. I could run around every where. They didn't know who I was. They didn't caught me, so\nI just saw what's happening and report it at home. But they could not get them out. And they\nsend them out to I know, they killed them right away there. Two of mine uncles. And one\nuncle they sent right away to a concentration camp.

And I was working from seven\nin the evening to seven in the morning. And I remember at night I had to come back home,\ngoing to the cemetery by myself. But I wasn't scared. I was singing, and my father was\nwaiting on the other corner for me. I remember good, I remember good things too, because\npeople were getting together. People were caring about each other. We didn't have much,\nbecause they took everything away from us. When then came to Poland, right away they\ntook, they came to the houses, and you know, they confiscate everything. I remember when\nthey came to mine house; and uh my grandmother give my mother a silver something, silver\ntea and coffee set. And they took 1t away. And my mother went, she didn't allow them. And\nmy father said, \"Give it to them. I will get you new ones when, God permit, we leave here\nalive.\" Back of my mind too. Just a little thing, but when we went to...when we went to\nSrodula, to the ghetto, just allowed to take so much and so much. Just a few pounds. And\nthree or four families lived in two rooms.

Mine father in the ghetto was\nworking in the kitchen; and I remember when he was telling how to my mother that they\nwere taking out children, sick children, because I wouldn't be... because when the Germans,\nwhen the Germans came, they dispose right away of sick, sick, sick children.

I didn't want to, but I\nhad to. And my mother said, \"You have to go with them.\" And I went. And she went with\nmine brother. And it was whole place with young girls, with young people; and I remember\nthe Germans said to me, in German, \"[Eine puppe sehr giit (ph)].\" They're going to be very\ngood to us. We're going to have a wonderful time, all of us. And uh right from there they put\nus 1n those cattle wagons; and they picked up other people on the way from other cities, and\nit was horrible.

        "A: Was no...was no water, no windows. We were closed up. People were praying. People didn't\nknow where to go to use the bathroom. They give us a bucket. And we were like little\nsardines put together. We didn't have place to move. I don't know if we were gone three days\nor four days. I don't remember. People...people were dying. Holding hands, and just\nholding...holding hands. And we came to Klettendorf--no, we came to [Guntebrecher (ph)],\nto Germany; and I remember they let us out, like you know, when you sit so many days,\nwhen you stand and you can move. And the Germans, the Germans was screaming and\nbeating us with the guns and with those, with those...those.... I don't know how you call it,\nthey keep them in , yes, clubs ?. And it was just...(DISRUPTION) And I\nremember when we came to Guentherbriicke, ' this was our first arbeit , arbeit lager;\nwhich was bad too, but it was not like our death.

And uh I just met them, and I didn't know that they knew my mother; but I\nwas just going to everybody, and I was just touching and thanking and introducing myself.\nAnd they said to me, \"Your mother, we worked with her.\" And so was a friendship, and so I\nknew right away somebody.",

        "A: When I came to Klettendorf, when I was doing... was working with a shovel and uh, a\nlaborer. Very hard work. But I was always dreaming, I was always pretending; and I wanted\nto , 1 went home to my parents. And I was singing, you know, one of Jewish songs we\nsing, tell stories. And I was dancing, and tap dancing.",
        "Q: What were the living conditions like in the camp?",
        "A: What conditions? We were existing, not even existing. We, the food - I remember I took a\npiece of bread, a tiny piece of bread, and I took it to a lady. And I said to her, \"Cut in very\nthin...very thin slices.\" So I would have it for a long time. And uh later I, I got a better job. I\nmean they sent me to put boxes together. We called it Sentung (ph), sending ammunition and\nthings to other cities. And I had to put it together. And I was singing... remember my father\nwas singing German songs; and I knew a few, and I was singing. And there was one German\n' Forced labor camp near Breslau (Pol: Wroc_ aw).\nwho was...he said, \"How do you know those songs?\" I said, \"Because my father was\nsinging.\" And uh he like it so much he gave me a piece of bread.",
        "Q: Can you sing one of the songs for us?",
        "A: Oh, I can't sing, I can't sing. And uh later, I was sent out from this concentration camp to\nanother one, to Klettendorf. In Klettendorf...let me think a minute. In Klettendorf, for me\nwas a man's concentration camp and a woman's concentration camp. And in Klettendorf\nwhen it was, I... became sick. I mean, I didn't have... was malnutritious, and I was working\nvery hard. And I was working, and uh I was a mechanic. I was supposed to be on mechanic.\nThe German who had the place wanted me to repair a car. What do I know about a car? So\nhe took a piece of iron and put it on my coat. He's going to kill. And was there another\nGerman who said, \" .\" You know, \"Leave her alone. She doesn't know how to\nrepair a car.\" So he said something to him in German. But he didn't do anything to me,\nbecause the other one was a soldier. So he...and I told this when I came home, you know,\nto...to the barracks, to my , to the lady who took us to take care of us. So she\ndidn't let me go to work anymore the next day. She said that I am sick or something\nhappened, she needs me there, you know. And they send me someplace else; because I was\nafraid if I go back to work I'm not going to come home alive. That was horrible.",
        "Q: How many people lived 1n one barracks?",
        "A: Many people; because we slept on the floor and we had uh straw, on the straw. We didn't\nhave, we just had uh those things with , not really dresses, made like paper. No\nstockings, no shoes, just rags around our feet. And it was very cold, extremely cold. Oh,\nsomething burst into my mind. When I was in Klettendorf, I had prisoners of war...Russian\nprisoners. I remember once, and we just worked maybe ten or fifteen girls with some\nGerman who were taking care of us. And if they didn't see what you were doing, we...all the\nbread of...we didn't have nothing, but we sent all to the men. Because, I mean, we couldn't\nmove without them. It was, it was horrible. And this, in same concen...in this same lager\nwhat I was, I met a guy...I met many guys, many Hollanders from Holland. But to\nto the arbeit lagers too; because they had Jewish professors in Holland, as they want\nto prod the students to boycott the Jewish professors, and they didn't want to. So for the\npunishment, they sent them to concen...to the lagers. And I met those guys, I met all of them.\nThey were wonderful people. And one was Elias Kohn (ph), who's helping me out, who's\nhelping everybody, who's wonderful, a wonderful human being. He risked his life to come...I\nmean, in this...in this Klettendorf he didn't have to do, but then he was sent to another\nconcentration camp, to ammunition factory. He risked his life, and he came and he made a\npicture. He made many pictures. This was made in 1945, uh 1944, the eleventh month. I was\nworking 1n ammunition factory. We, my whole body was grey-blue. And I scratched myself;\nand being hungry, not having what to sleep, not having what to eat, being, you know,\nmissing everybody the way I did, I got very sick. We didn't have any doctors. We didn't have\nany nurses. But we had uh a lady who was married to a doctor, who was kind and took care\nof me. He said for me to stay on the hot water, and when I felt...she took a razor blade\nbecause we didn't have any scalpels, and she cut me under my arm and she let the pus out\nand my whole body was.... And I was fainting; and she...somehow she took care of me. She\nsaid, she told me...I didn't know this because I didn't know then, but then I met her in 19...I\nmean, I met her ten or fifteen years ago in New York at a wedding. She was telling my\nhusband that she was nursing with me with little spoons with water, because we didn't have\nmuch to eat. And everybody contribute. All the guys were very supportive, helping each\nother. You know, everybody give something away, they don't have much; and this helped me\nback to life. And I was screaming, \"I have to be alive because I have to go home.\" I knew\nthat I didn't have anybody, but I was hoping so hard that I believe in it. And when I come\nhome, I'm going to have a mother and a father. And that's what I told everybody. And\neverybody agreed with me. Nobody disagreed, and everybody said, \"Of course, you will.\" I\nmean, the doctors didn't have to do anything. They just talked to you and told you, and you\nbelieved them. Maybe this will help you.",
        "Q: How did this Dutch man help you?",
        "A: He was bringing, bringing food for us. He was telling us what was going on. He thinks even\nwhen you don't, didn't believe it, 1t was your only hope. You grabbed it. And we loved him,\nall the girls loved him. Even came to see us after the war, too.",
        "Q: How long were you in that particular camp?",
        "A: I couldn't tell you. I went to the camp, was 1943; and I was...I was two years in the camps\ntogether. But with the ghetto together, it was--the whole war, six years. You know,\nsometimes I sit and I don't believe it myself. But it's the truth.",
        "Q: Can you tell us more about the relationship between the young women together in the camp?",
        "A: We were very supportive of each other. I had four girl friends. These are Klara Kartush (ph)\nin Detroit, Tonya, Tonya...I forget her maiden name--Jablon (ph). And Sara Stapler(ph).\nThose girls were wonderful. They even took care of me when I was very sick. Because they\nhad a transport they sent out in 19...1n 1945, before the war ended, they sent a transport of\ngirls. I couldn't go because I was very sick. So they left me; and those girls didn't go. They\nsaid, \"We're going to save you.\" I didn't want to ask. They said, \"You have to lie down,\nbecause we're going...we're going close the whole lager.\" But what happened...the good thing\nhappened that the Russians came the night before, and we were liberated the 8th of May.\nAnd they were supposed to kill us the 9th. Get rid of us. And you know, we were scared to\ntell them that we are sick because doesn't matter what. Right away, dead. (PAUSE) I\nremember I was standing and I was dreaming, I was pretending; I was looking at everything\nwas so beautiful outside green, and we were cooped up. And people were going to work, and\ntaking, and couldn't understand this. In the morning, we had to go to work. (PAUSE) We\nhad to go and march, too. And they were clubbing us. They were hitting us. Some people\ngot, some people got...not hurt, but killed.",
        "Q: Were you yourself ever hit?",
        "A: Many times. One time I stole a potato. I was working in a garden. I saw a potato and I put in\nmy arm. Had a bandage, but I put the potato in my hand; and they caught me and I was\nbeaten. Everybody was standing looking as they were beating me with - (PAUSE) - yeah.",
        "Q: What happened after you were liberated?",
        "A: When I was liberated, I was with my girl friends. I was liberated with the girls in\nLudwigsdorf, in Ludwigsdorf in ammunition factory. And I was uh very sick. I couldn't go\nany place; so we went to Walgenbuch (ph). We took our apartment, and we stayed there for\ntwo, three weeks. I felt better. And uh somebody brought me a letter from Poland, from my\ncousin, to come back home...to come home. \"We're going to teach, you're going to go back\nto school.\" And I was very eager to do this. So three weeks later, I went back to Poland\nwithout papers, with nothing. I went back to Sosnowiec. Hoping, hoping that I have\nsomebody there. Can you imagine, I was sitting in the train...I was sitting with a priest with\nsome girls. And I remember I didn't have anywhere to put mine head, so I put on his knee;\nand when he started talking about the Jews, I picked up mine head and said, \"I'm Jewish.\nAnd I'm . I'm Jewish and I'm coming from concentration camp.\" And I said,\n\"You better close your mouth, because you don't know what you're talking about.\" He got\nup...he throw me down, and he got up and went away. Coming back from...to Sosnowiec, I\ndidn't have any money. I didn't have any baggage. I just had whatever I was wearing. Mine\nheart was pumping. I was overwhelmed. I was very happy; but I was excited and I was\nhappy and I was scared and I didn't trust. I was afraid to trust. And I went back when my\ncousin wrote me the letter to the factory there. Was one of mine cousins and the people\nworking. And he said to me, \"This is yours. And stay with me, and we will take care of you.\"\nDidn't say anything about a school, what he wrote to me. And I stayed a week. I stayed two\nweeks. I was, I was going around. I was going to the place where we were living. They didn't\nallow me to come in. I mean, to me they didn't say this, but to some other Jewish girls they\nsaid . \"You are still alive; they didn't get rid of\nyou.\" And I told mine cousin that I'm going back to Germany. He didn't like it. One evening,\nI didn't say anything to him. I met another girl who came from concentration camp looking\nfor her parents in another city--and twin cities, so it's another B_dzin. She didn't meet\nanybody. She was younger than I was. I mean, she was not quite sixteen and I was sixteen\nand a half. We went together, and just left. We went to the Polish grentz (ph -border ?). They\ndidn't let us go. They let us go. We just ran through it. To the Czech, to the Czechoslovakia\n. She knew how to speak Czech; and she told them that I am...I don't hear and I can't\nspeak. For two days like that. Later we came to the DP camp where I met my husband.",
        "Q: Do you recall any of the details of how the Russians came to liberate the camp where you\nwere, the ammunition factory?",
        "A: Yes, I remember this. It was...see, this was...my girlfriend was telling me. Gisza Klein (ph)\nwas born in Odessa, but before the war they came to visit the grandmother and they couldn't\ngo back. And what she told me when the Russians came, they opened the doors and she greet\nthem. She said, \"Strastvitye, tovarishi.\" [Trans: \"Hello, comrades.\"|] She spoke Russian.\nAnd she says they came in. That's what she was telling.

Why don't we have cousins like other people\nhave?\" And I was trying to explain. I was sitting with them when they were a little bit older,\nsitting at a table and telling them.

She was telling my\nhusband that she was nursing with me with little spoons with water, because we didn't have\nmuch to eat. And everybody contribute. All the guys were very supportive, helping each\nother. You know, everybody give something away, they don't have much; and this helped me\nback to life. And I was screaming, \"I have to be alive because I have to go home.\" I knew\nthat I didn't have anybody, but I was hoping so hard that I believe in it. And when I come\nhome, I'm going to have a mother and a father. And that's what I told everybody. And\neverybody agreed with me. Nobody disagreed, and everybody said, \"Of course, you will.\" I\nmean, the doctors didn't have to do anything. They just talked to you and told you, and you\nbelieved them. Maybe this will help you.",
        "A: He was bringing, bringing food for us. He was telling us what was going on. He thinks even\nwhen you don't, didn't believe it, 1t was your only hope. You grabbed it. And we loved him,\nall the girls loved him. Even came to see us after the war, too.",
        "A: I couldn't tell you. I went to the camp, was 1943; and I was...I was two years in the camps\ntogether. But with the ghetto together, it was--the whole war, six years. You know,\nsometimes I sit and I don't believe it myself. But it's the truth.",
        "A: We were very supportive of each other. I had four girl friends. These are Klara Kartush (ph)\nin Detroit, Tonya, Tonya...I forget her maiden name--Jablon (ph). And Sara Stapler(ph).\nThose girls were wonderful. They even took care of me when I was very sick. Because they\nhad a transport they sent out in 19...1n 1945, before the war ended, they sent a transport of\ngirls. I couldn't go because I was very sick. So they left me; and those girls didn't go. They\nsaid, \"We're going to save you.\" I didn't want to ask. They said, \"You have to lie down,\nbecause we're going...we're going close the whole lager.\" But what happened...the good thing\nhappened that the Russians came the night before, and we were liberated the 8th of May.\nAnd they were supposed to kill us the 9th. Get rid of us. And you know, we were scared to\ntell them that we are sick because doesn't matter what. Right away, dead. (PAUSE) I\nremember I was standing and I was dreaming, I was pretending; I was looking at everything\nwas so beautiful outside green, and we were cooped up. And people were going to work, and\ntaking, and couldn't understand this. In the morning, we had to go to work. (PAUSE) We\nhad to go and march, too. And they were clubbing us. They were hitting us. Some people\ngot, some people got...not hurt, but killed.",
        "A: Many times. One time I stole a potato. I was working in a garden. I saw a potato and I put in\nmy arm. Had a bandage, but I put the potato in my hand; and they caught me and I was\nbeaten. Everybody was standing looking as they were beating me with - (PAUSE) - yeah.",
        "A: When I was liberated, I was with my girl friends. I was liberated with the girls in\nLudwigsdorf, in Ludwigsdorf in ammunition factory. And I was uh very sick. I couldn't go\nany place; so we went to Walgenbuch (ph). We took our apartment, and we stayed there for\ntwo, three weeks. I felt better. And uh somebody brought me a letter from Poland, from my\ncousin, to come back home...to come home. \"We're going to teach, you're going to go back\nto school.\" And I was very eager to do this. So three weeks later, I went back to Poland\nwithout papers, with nothing. I went back to Sosnowiec. Hoping, hoping that I have\nsomebody there. Can you imagine, I was sitting in the train...I was sitting with a priest with\nsome girls. And I remember I didn't have anywhere to put mine head, so I put on his knee;\nand when he started talking about the Jews, I picked up mine head and said, \"I'm Jewish.\nAnd I'm . I'm Jewish and I'm coming from concentration camp.\" And I said,\n\"You better close your mouth, because you don't know what you're talking about.\" He got\nup...he throw me down, and he got up and went away. Coming back from...to Sosnowiec, I\ndidn't have any money. I didn't have any baggage. I just had whatever I was wearing. Mine\nheart was pumping. I was overwhelmed. I was very happy; but I was excited and I was\nhappy and I was scared and I didn't trust. I was afraid to trust. And I went back when my\ncousin wrote me the letter to the factory there. Was one of mine cousins and the people\nworking. And he said to me, \"This is yours. And stay with me, and we will take care of you.\"\nDidn't say anything about a school, what he wrote to me. And I stayed a week. I stayed two\nweeks. I was, I was going around. I was going to the place where we were living. They didn't\nallow me to come in. I mean, to me they didn't say this, but to some other Jewish girls they\nsaid . \"You are still alive; they didn't get rid of\nyou.\" And I told mine cousin that I'm going back to Germany. He didn't like it. One evening,\nI didn't say anything to him. I met another girl who came from concentration camp looking\nfor her parents in another city--and twin cities, so it's another B_dzin. She didn't meet\nanybody. She was younger than I was. I mean, she was not quite sixteen and I was sixteen\nand a half. We went together, and just left. We went to the Polish grentz (ph -border ?). They\ndidn't let us go. They let us go. We just ran through it. To the Czech, to the Czechoslovakia\n. She knew how to speak Czech; and she told them that I am...I don't hear and I can't\nspeak. For two days like that. Later we came to the DP camp where I met my husband.",
        "A: Yes, I remember this. It was...see, this was...my girlfriend was telling me. Gisza Klein (ph)\nwas born in Odessa, but before the war they came to visit the grandmother and they couldn't\ngo back. And what she told me when the Russians came, they opened the doors and she greet\nthem. She said, \"Strastvitye, tovarishi.\" [Trans: \"Hello, comrades.\"|] She spoke Russian.\nAnd she says they came in. That's what she was telling. And I remember that I went looking\nfor food for this little...we had many sick people. We went looking for food to the Germans,\nand they refused to give it to us. They gave us a few eggs and a little milk for the very sick\npeople with, with uh, what they had uh something with a long - (tuberculosis). Tuberculosis.\nNo doctors. Sick people. And I remember they got...they got a few of those Germans. Not I,\nbecause I don't have the strength to do anything cause I couldn't walk. My legs were like\n, | think. Some...some of my friends said that I'm a miracle, that I survived what I\nsurvived.",
        "A: Yes. But one was very nice to all of us. He always give us hope, all the girls; and the girls\ntook care of him after the war by helping him.",
        "A: One of the Germans, a German man. He was always decent to.... He had a big family; and\nhe...when he came, he was...he didn't give us...he didn't have anything himself. But he give\nus hope. So we still have good people. I believe that we have good people. And I still trust\npeople. And I promise myself one thing in concentration camp: when I'm going to be alive\nand I'm going to get through, the first I'm going to grab I'm going to throw in the\nriver. The first I grabbed I hugged and I kissed and I give her all my clothes; and I\ngive away my bread. You cannot do things like that when you're not brought up this way. It's\ninstilled in you. Yes.",
        "A: I met my husband in Landsberg-am-Lech in July when I, when I came to Landsberg. I was\nliberated in June. I was in Poland for three weeks. From Poland I went next to Germany; and\nI went traveling and I went to Landsberg, to a DP camp, displaced person camp. My husband\nwas a policeman there. That's where I met him.",
        "A: He's from Warsaw, yes. And I know him three months, and I got married.\n(PAUSE)",
        "A: Oh, I don't remember. (Laughter) I met him because somebody wanted to hit me. (Laughter)\nIn our...1n our ...he came to protect us. He was a policeman. It was a group of people from\nall countries. We had people from Greece, from Romania, different people, diff... well, you\nknow. Different men. So one just put a knife, and said if I don't marry him he's going to kill\nme. (Laughter) So we called the police; and then my husband came. Yeah.",
        "A: We stayed in Germany - wait, let me tell you this. So Joe was born. Joseph, our first baby,\nwas born in Germany, in Landsberg . He was born Decem--no, he was born 1946.\nAnd to us, you know, our children are more than children to us. This is our future, our hope.\nSo you can imagine, this was mine baby and this was my doll. Not just him, but everybody.\nWe care very much about each other. (PAUSE) We had to...we didn't have anybody.\nAnyhow, all the Jews are kinship to each other. Yes.",
        "A: I stayed...we stayed in Germany for--'45 to '49--four years. And uh we registered to go to\nIsrael. My husband registered to go to Israel before he met me; but I don't know, he...he was\ntelling me those things. But it took such a long time, I forgot what he was telling me. But we\nregistered to go to America. And it took a few years. They called us in, and we were sent to\nRichmond in 1949. Forty years ago. That's when I was born--forty years ago.",
        "A: Maria? Maria was stolen. She was an import. We brought her, too. And she was born in\nRichmond; and when she was two and one half, not quite three, whenever I took her to the\ngrocery store and she saw a lady, she asked her would she be my grandmother. You know, I\ndidn't mind; but she remembers. My kids always asking, \"Mama, why don't we have\ngrandparents? Why don't we have uncles? Why don't we have cousins like other people\nhave?\" And I was trying to explain. I was sitting with them when they were a little bit older,\nsitting at a table and telling them. But I always broke down, and I start crying. I couldn't\nfinish. Even now I cannot tell everything. But they don't ask too much, because they read\nand know and listen.",
        "A: It's going to come back to me later. Now I can't think, you know. Yes. Things like that\nshould never happen. People should care about each other.",
        "A: You're very welcome. Thank you.\n"
