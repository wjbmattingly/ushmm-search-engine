        "Question: Hello Maria, welcome to Washington.",
        "Answer: Thank you, Joan.",
        "Q: Could you tell me the name that you were born with and when and where you were born?",
        "A: Yes. I was born December 26, 1918, which in Poland is Christmas, so I\u2019m a Christmas child.\nAnd I was born in the city of Kolomyja, which at the time I was born was Poland, it was newly\ncreated Poland. Before then, it was Hapsberg, Austria. Therefore, my parents spoke German and I\nwas brought up in the German language. My parents eventually learned some Polish but they didn\u2019t\nlike the language, so at home the language was German. When I came to school I naturally had to\nlearn Polish so at the age of five-and-a-half I entered a Polish school in Kolo-mier (ph) and I said\nsomething in Polish which didn\u2019t sound right because it was not my initial language. So the\nchildren, including the teacher, started laughing, making fun of me. Naturally, it was quite\ntraumatic. I ran home crying, crying I\u2019Il never go to school again. Well, I did go back. And I\u2019ve\nbeen a student for many, many years later. Interesting enough, when I thought about this experience\nmany years ago, I think it played an important role in my later life choice of Polish as the aid of\nconcentrations university, strange as 1t may sound. But there are some dynamics that turned it\nupright anyway so this was my experience. Actually, I was writing still, I still am, and German and\nPolish are pretty much my languages even though, although they have both deteriorated. Well, the\nway I remember Kolomyyja, it was a small town, although it wasn\u2019t small to the eyes of a child. And\nlater when I visited the smaller towns, the villages around, it seemed that Kolomyja was big. It\u2019s an\ninteresting thing about Kolomyja that, as I write about it just years later, many years later, that Ta-\npan-gee (ph) was an important city during the earlier centuries. It\u2019s very old. They just celebrated\nseven hundred and fifty years of the birth of the town and they say it goes back even further. It was\nransacked, it was demolished, it was burned all the way, many times, first by the Tartars, then by the\nMongols, or vise-versa, then by the Cossacks. There were endless destruction\u2019s and occupations of\nKolomyja. I do not know how far my father\u2019s family goes back. The name was Hiersch (ph) and I\nwas born as Matylda Hirsch.\nMy parents wanted to Polonaise my name because that was important for them, I assume, as many\nparents do, but at home I was called Mattie because my parents spoke German. My father spoke\nYiddish with many of his helpers in the store and business with some of the people in the\ncommunity, but my mother was very snobbish about it. She came from another city called Chad-\nno-vich (ph). Czernowitz was a bigger city, it was a very snobbish city, it was, they called\nthemselves small Paris, little Paris. Her parents lived there. Actually, I knew only her father\nbecause her mother died just before I was born and I was named after her mother. So she had that\nair of Czernowitz about her and she despised Kolomyja and she despised Ukrainian town and she\ndespised the Polish people and she didn\u2019t want to hear any of the Yiddish language. So, sadly\nenough, I was brought up in the German language and German was the language, but certainly I\nspoke Polish later and, with my girlfriends it was always Polish. There was a city itself, I saw it\nonly forty years ago for the first time I went back. It\u2019s a handsome city now and as I read some of\nit\u2019s history, it had a rich history, over the centuries it was a town in which a lot of trade was going\non. It was on the tracks between Poland and Austria and Romania, so apparently business and trade\nwas very important. My own father came from a whole generation of people who owned the same\nstore, the same business. This was porcelain and enamel and glass. So we always had the very\nbeautiful table settings because of their availability. I remember that when my older sister got\nmarried, and her husband didn\u2019t have a profession, so my father took him into the business. But\nsmartly gave him a special division of it, so he became the importer of chandeliers. It all sounds\nvery, very strange but this was back in our time. My father was Orthodox, my mother came also\nfrom a religious family, but not as Orthodox. So there was a little bit cheating, I suppose, but she\nwore a wig because it was important in our home town. My father was a follower of Rabbi, he was\na Hasidic, a follower of a Rabbi called Wishnitz, he came from the city of Vinnitsa. Apparently he\nwas important in the Rabbinical dynasty and as a child I remember the Wishnitz (ph) Rabbi coming\nand staying in our home and I didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: I was crushed by the, by the tone of all these people. He would come, I was very young then, he\nwould come Thursday night for Sukkotbat. So on Thursday night, from the railway station, he\nwould come escorted by about 200 hus-a-dem (ph), some from his own entourage\u2019 and some from\nour home town, and because it was dark, 1t was evening, they would come with, the German name\ncomes back, \u201cFalken\u2019\u2019, these lightings, strobes carried in the street, torches, right? Now it comes\nback. I sometimes think in German from my childhood years. So they were full of torches and to\nthe dark night of my home town, which was very Anti-Semitic, although I wasn\u2019t exposed to it, I\nsensed it, and the women would stand on the balcony and greet them, saw them coming in. Since I\nwas so young, to me this was an overwhelming picture and I said I didn\u2019t like it. They all came into\nour house, which was big and he would give him the biggest room. In front of his room was a\nGabbai, a Gabbai was the assistant of the man who collected the quitels, and quitels is something\nthat a Jew would write out on a paper asking the Rabbi for advice. So together with the paper I\nassume that the Rabbi got the money too. I suspect it so. But anyway, the Gabbai stood in front of\nour living room where the Rabbi held court and he would see people. Hundreds of people would\nwalk through our home. And to me this was overwhelming, very unhappy kind of experience. I\nwas the youngest and I think on me it worked more than on my sisters because I was already born\ninto Poland, it made a difference. Since I\u2019m the youngest, my experience of learning school and\notherwise was different than that of my older sisters. It shows you the meaning of history.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the difference in age between you and your sisters?",
        "A: Five years each, five years each. My older sister was Cyla, C-Y-L-A if you want it, and there\nwas a difference of twenty years between us all. I\u2019m not sure, but something like it. She married\nJacob Goldstein, a man from Lvov who didn\u2019t have money and didn\u2019t have much of a profession,\nbut he was the son of a Talmudist and to my father, that was important. So, there was a\ntremendous wedding, all my sisters had tremendous weddings except me, and their only son,\nMenek, survived the war. I don\u2019t know whether I should go into, she was killed in the last days of\nthe ghetto and her husband was transported to the Belzec Extermination Camp in 1942.\nAnyway, that was my sister, Cyla, and she lived a pretty middle-class, it was pretty prosperous. Her\nhobby was to do petite work, petite point, and I remember her beautiful pictures on the walls, all her\nown work. This was her hobby. She was well known in town, she had girlfriends and when their\nson was born, it was a great thing because he was the only boy in the family, until then we had\nnothing but girls. Now the next sister was Frieda, her name, my sister Cyla, was Cyla Goldstein,\nthat was her name and her son is Menek Goldstein, and he survived. My next sister was Frieda.\nShe was very beautiful. Frieda married a man who was a cousin, a second cousin. He came from\nCal-es-sa-bot (ph), from a resort town, very well known spot in Europe. His father was a brother of\nmy father, but that was of a different mother so they were step-brothers. And therefore, it was\npermitted for them to marry, even so, they worried that they\u2019re offspring may suffer from it and be\nmentally retarded, whatever. She ain\u2019t, she\u2019s a doctor of eye diseases. She turned out to be okay.\nBut this wedding, I remember vaguely. I only remember my dress, I don\u2019t know why. It was the\nmost beautiful dress I\u2019ve ever had. And their wedding was held in Stanislawow, a city a little bit\nbigger than Kolomyja. This is somehow, I still remember. No, she lived in Karlsbad (ph) which\nmeans she lived in a privileged place because Karlsbad (ph) was a beautiful international spot and\nhe was making a good living, he had many patients so it was sort of high life. Anyway, in 1938\nHitler occupied .. .",
        "Q: Wait, you\u2019ve missed a sister.",
        "A: Oh, you want to go this way, sure. Then the younger sister, also five years younger, is Frania.\nFrania survived. By the way, my sister Frieda survived and in Czechoslovakia they got out of\nDorosig into Palestine. She\u2019s still alive, she\u2019s unfortunately in a nursing home now and her husband\ndied a few years ago. Then, there\u2019s my sister, Frania. She\u2019s alive, she lives in my neighborhood,\nher husband was killed, and they\u2019re child, Laszek, Alex, was about three years old in the ghetto and\nmiraculously he survived and he lives in New York City. Though she later re-married and her\nsecond husband adopted him so his name is Alex Gitterman.\nAnd then comes me. I was the youngest. No, my sisters still had a background of Hapsberg,\nAustria, although Frania was very young then. In 1916 I believe, my parents ran from Kolomyja\nbecause of the war. And they came to, they ran to a place which is near Sigit, Marmorosk I think,\nwhich is where Wiesel comes from, which was a border of Romania and Hungary. There were\nlarge Jewish communities there. My father went into hiding there because the Austrian army was\nbusy trying to find men to fight their war, they needed my father naturally, so they lived a very, very\ndifficult kind of life. I think they lived in Mon-room-a-vot (ph). And at that time I still had another\nsister, whom I never met, she died right there. She was between Cyla and Frieda and I think she\nwas fourteen years old when she developed a serious appendix condition and there was no time to\nget to the hospital, she died right in my father\u2019s arms, I understand. Some things that I heard about\nyears later, my parents didn\u2019t talk about it, but it was always in the air and I suspected that\nsomething happened there, but I say, I was born after, I didn\u2019t know. Only about ten years ago,\nwalking in the beautiful woods of Switzerland, my mother\u2019s younger brother told me about it. They\ntalked about her in some ways, her name was Yetta, but it was hushed-hushed and it was never quite\nthere. I\u2019m sure that my childhood was spent in a family which suffered from depression, yet it was\nnot, it was covered over. Probably because my father was a Hasidic and in the Hasidic tradition, joy\nand pain are mixed. So, I think so, in looking back at it that my childhood was very complex\nbecause it was a Hasidic family and my mother was, had that air of a bigger city with more\ncivilization and the country in which I lived was Polish Anti-Semitic, so I would think I have the\nstrength of all of that in some way in my own personality. But, I remember there were times of\nwhen my mother would cry and this was the anniversary, not only of the deaths of my sister and her\ndaughter, but the death of her mother. They all lived in that hiding place near Sigit there and my\ngrandmother, her mother, died of a heart attack, apparently still a young woman, so for my mother it\nmust have been a horrible loss. She would go to visit her father later, she once took me to\nCzernowitz and this I remember. These things are very vague in my memory because they were not\ntalked about, but it was there in the air and from time to time I would overhear something.\nThere\u2019s a good possibility I tried to protect myself from the pain too. So I grew up in this family in\nwhich I was extremely important because only years back later, I could understand the importance\nof me. Because I had to replace all these losses, I\u2019m sure. So, I was an extremely overprotected\nchild to the extent that I hated it, I was embarrassed by it. When I sneezed, there was immediately a\ndoctor around me. When I went to school, and I forgot my breakfast, somebody from the store\nwould knock at the door of my class and bring me the breakfast. My mother was extremely anxious\nabout me and my parents over-protected me in a way which probably helped them some way but\nalso did not. So my sister Frania, I think, was a little bit jealous, I never knew about it because no\nmatter what I did was fine. Which means I wasn\u2019t prepared for the hardships of life that later came\nmy way. I was a child who could never do wrong. And they thought I was bright and I did\nextremely well in school. To the end of my sister because she didn\u2019t do so well, she was pretty and\nshe liked to go with boys and she wasn\u2019t so interested in studies. I was, all of my, the grades were\nalways above \u2018A\u2019, you know? Once I brought a \u2018B\u2019, I cried for weeks! I got a \u2018B\u2019 in mathematics\nwhich was unbelievable because it was always \u2018A\u2019s in other subjects and my preferred subject was\nPolish literature, romantic Polish literature.",
        "Q: Did this create a problem between you and your mother?",
        "A: No. I was a child who was smart. I don\u2019t think I was pretty, my sisters were pretty, my two\nsisters, Frania and Frieda were very pretty, but I never experienced a sense that I wasn\u2019t okay.\nLooks didn\u2019t matter. I was accepted. I say I was, scholastically, I did so extremely well. My sister,\nFrania, still remembers with pain that when my mother would go to the teachers for the periodic\nvisitations, they would say, how come your daughter, Frania, cannot do that well? I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t\ndo her any good, but that\u2019s what she remembers. But she was very pretty.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your violin playing?",
        "A: Oh, how do you know this? As, I must have been six years old, eight years old, I\u2019m not sure.\nMy parents hired a violin teacher for Frania and myself. And we didn\u2019t like it. But anyway, I\nmastered in playing the Hatikva so every Saturday night, many guests, our house was full of guests\nalways.\nI think I still carry this tradition to some extent. We had to play, the ha-tic-fa (ph) had to play, a few\nother things. It was not something that I really liked very much. Probably I couldn\u2019t identify with\nthe teacher. We also had a teacher of Hebrew. Darlis Bate (ph). And him we hated! He was a\npoor, old Jew who didn\u2019t know to teach. My sister and I use to bribe him, give him a zloty and he\nwould go, he would leave earlier. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t learn much so until these days, I cannot\nread any of the Hebrew text and I\u2019m sorry about it, I wish I could. But this was my mother, my\nmother looked away because it wasn\u2019t as important to her and as girls, we were not suppose to learn\nmuch of the Hebrew text. We never was suppose to go to synagogue until you're married so I never\nwent to synagogue because when I married, the war was on and I\u2019ve never gone to a synagogue. I\nremember, right after the war, there was some gathering of the American soldiers and I was\nincluded and it was in a synagogue in Heidelberg, I\u2019m not even sure, but occasionally I go now to\nreligious service but a synagogue is not part of my life and this is because of my background.",
        "Q: Were your friends primarily, if not all together, Jewish?",
        "A: All were Jewish. Well, in primary school, what you call, elementary school, there were non-\nJewish students too. I do not recall contact with them. I had two close friends, both were neighbors\non both sides of our house. We use to visit with each other. My main preoccupation was with\nreading. When my girlfriends would come and to ask where I was, my mother or whoever was\naround would say, you'll find her in a book!\nThis was my childhood, I was an avid reader. But I liked to play with them and both of them were\nkilled, but we use to go away a lot. I think this too established my pattern of traveling later in life.\nFor ten weeks, every year, my parents would remove me from school a little earlier. It had to start\nthe 15th of June and I wouldn\u2019t come back until sometime in September. Every year we would go\nto the mountains. My mother believed that we didn\u2019t look well enough, that we needed all the fresh\nair. She believed in these things. So we went to the Carpatian Mountains because my home town is\nsurrounded by the Carpatian Mountains, Kolomyja is the entry to the Carpatian Mountains. We\nwould go to different places, the names may mean nothing, but from time to time they crop up.\nLosuv, Garemcze, Delatyn, these were the places. The way we would go, it was so funny, my\nfather would stay behind and he would come one week. But we would go for the ten weeks and we\ntook everything along because these were pretty primitive villas. My mother insisted on a villa\nwhich was inside and which was always surrounded by trees; apple trees, pear trees and plumb\ntrees. Poland has a lot of very delicious fruit so there had to be trees, that was the requirements of\nhiring a villa. And it had to be close to the street but not too close, close to the street so we could\nlook and see some traffic but not too close so nobody would come close to us. And it had to be on a\nlittle river. On a little stream. And we would go swimming there, not swimming really, sitting\nunder the stones. My sister, Cyla, made it into her real hobby. She would go every morning, sit\nunder these stones in which you had a, what do you call it, little water fall and she would sit there\nfor hours hoping she would loose weight this way. She was overweight and she wanted to loose\nweight, this was her idea. One day, she decided she really wants to do it more professionally so\nthere was a man from Warsaw, a Polish man, who ran a special spa for the loosing weight. He was\nAnti-Semitic to the core. His name was Dr. Tarnovsky, but Jewish middle-class women like all the\nothers went there to loose weight. Well, she didn\u2019t like that too much so one day they had an\nafternoon off and she went to the village and she moved into Konditorai, a cafe. Konitorai I knew\nwas a very special institution. It\u2019s coffee and hot chocolate and there was beautiful pastries. So, she\neats here pastry and drinks the chocolate and here walks in Dr. Tarnovsky and he sees that thing, he\nwalks over to her and he slaps her, right across her face.\nWell, this was an awakening for her. She never went back to that spa anymore. But this was the\nsituation. Part of it was, anti-Semitism in Poland just had its full way, in different ways, but I\npersonally did not experience it in elementary school, perhaps not in elementary school but in High\nSchool. Until I come to that, I remember these different locations of our traveling to for this\nsummer, and it was a whole trip. In front of us was always a carriage with horses which would\ncarry our beddings, our dishes, our household kosher which meant you needed double dishes, and\nsome furnishings. This was in front and in the back was Fiakev, a drosh-ka (ph), with my mother,\nmy father if it was for the week-end and all children. There was a maid, a woman to clean and it\nhad to be a Jewish maid to cook because we were Kosher. So coming to these places, my mother\nbelieved in good air, fresh air and food. So she wanted us to drink milk from the cow. And she\nwould bribe us. So food was always something which they had to beg us to eat. I would get either\na zloty or a big piece of chocolate to drink that milk and I always managed to avoid drinking that\nmilk. It was a game going on, I still hate milk for this reason. I was so ostioperosis probably\nbecause I didn\u2019t drink enough milk.",
        "Q: This time away from, did this make all of you much closer than you would have been?",
        "A: We were a very close family, always a very close family. Close in the family was a prescription\nI\u2019m sure of my family, probably because it\u2019s a Jewish tradition but probably because they had\nsuffered losses. So, to my parents, the business was important to my father and he was a very good\nbusinessman, family was all that mattered, always. And to us it still does. Now we have fragments\nof the family but family is still very important to us, to all of us. So I was brought up with this, I\nwas suffocated by it, I really didn\u2019t like that much closeness. And with my colleagues who had\nmore space, and I always wanted more space. My whole traveling in my life was always getting\nmore space. These were the consequences of that emotional overcrowding, extremely so.",
        "Q: Were there political discussions that you remember as you grew up?",
        "A: By the way, yes. I wasn\u2019t involved politically until sometime later in my gymnasium years.\nYes, the Kolomyja, like most towns in Poland, had a lot of political divisions among the Jewish\npeople. There was the Main Zionist, and there were Left Zionist, the Communist, the Socialist, the\nLiberals, the Divisionists, you name it. Amazing, a small city like Kolomyja which only had 40,000\npeople, half of them were Jewish, they had about a few Jewish newspapers. It was a highly literate\ncity. I wasn\u2019t among them because my parents protection some how or other excluded me. My\nparents protection and my need for the Polish patriotism somehow excluded me much from it, as\nstrange as it is. But I had liberal ideas. My parents, my father worried about it, that I was going\nvery liberal at one point. But I didn\u2019t join a particular group. However, there were many, many\ngroups. Most of the Jewish people in Kolomyja as in most of Poland were poor. There were people\nwho were really poor and then there was the middle class, upper middle class, and a very few who\nwere really extremely rich. There must have been, but in my home town the middle class and upper\nmiddle class were the rich people. I remember, I still have a great pain when I think about the\npoverty in my home town. My first memory is of the water carriers. We lived in a house in which\nthe apartment was on top of the business and there were wide staircases. And the water carriers, all\nwhom were Jewish, they were carrying up the water, big cans, because there was no other way of\ngetting water. The water came from a main fountain in the city, on Mokra Street. Mokra Street is\nwell known because there are survivors like Dov Noi, who\u2019s well know, he comes from\nMokraStreet. Many people lived on MokraStreet. It was the poorest neighborhood and there was a\nbig fountain and the water carriers possibly were on the lowest rank of the Jewish community. And\nthey carried that water upstairs. I remember once, on a very cold day, and Kolomyja being in the\nUkraine, a cold, cold climate. I asked my mother, how come this man has ice on his hands?\nDoesn\u2019t he like to wear gloves? This was my awakening, that some people didn\u2019t have money for\ngloves. The poverty was everywhere and when I think of that poverty, I think of them like of the\nclosest family because there was no right for them to suffer such an end as these people did. They\nreally never had any life. There was a lot of stigma about being poor and there was a lot of\nsukkotme.\nIn my High School, which was a Jewish Gymnasium, it was one of the sets of gymnasiums, it was a\nchain of, called Zyowskie Towarzystowo szkoty Ludowei Sreduig, it was a chain of Jewish\nGymnasiums established in Poland, which was run by the Jewish parents, who established it. They\npaid for it, 1t was extremely expensive. Somehow or other, because there was no gymnasium for\nJewish girls after elementary school, ten parents got together and established it. My parents and\nnine others. And they took in one parent who didn\u2019t have money. Their name was Neiman and she\nwas Sophia Neiman. I still remember the pain and the stigma and the sense of sukkotme. She wore\nclothes which came from America, which means she had a coat which was red. Only American\nchildren wore red coat, we never wore red coat. In High School you wore navy. And this was such\na stigmatic thing. And another thing I remember is that outside was a school building, was an old\nJew who was selling some food, potatonik, and you could buy it with butter or with margarine.\nMargarine was half price of butter, and she would buy the margarine potato. All these things stay\nwith me because it was so unjust. Well, of the ten students, we were ten students and ten teachers.\nAll teachers were Jewish. They came from Warsaw, from the big cities. We had to be more pious\nthan the Pope in achieving our accreditation because the commission would come down from\nWarsaw and we had to be good. So we had ten teachers to ten students. And of the ten students,\nmiraculously, unbelievably, all survived! All the teachers were killed. I wanted to bring you\npictures, some how I couldn\u2019t get 1t down from my wall, it was heavy. But I be jumping a little bit.\nThis was the gymnasium years and it was all Jewish students, all Jewish teachers. It was considered\na high level gymnasium. It is described in the book about Poland by Dr. Sylvia Helliard, you may\nknow about it, called \u201cAn Air of Destruction\u201d. She has quite a bit about these schools.",
        "Q: Were you all close, all the students, including the one who was somewhat stigmatized or what\nabout that one?",
        "A: Well, she was not stigmatized by us, we just felt the stigma. I felt the stigma. For reason, I don\u2019t\nknow why, I still don\u2019t know why I identified with the underdog. Some way or other I assume it\neventually led me to social work, but I didn\u2019t know the origins of it.",
        "Q: But you, of course, were living in very privileged ways?",
        "A: I lived by comparison, I\u2019m sure here in America it now would not be because of it, but by\ncomparison with the others, and I had a lot of pain about it. Probably was a part of my rebelling\nagainst my parents, whatever it was that came into it, that I became very liberal. The pain about\nwitnessing so much poverty still stays with me whenever I think about what happened. But\nanyway.. So, this was the gymnasium years, we had to study a lot. We had to study Latin, eight\nyears of Latin, that\u2019s a lot of Latin. We had to study, the only thing we didn\u2019t like is religion. Of\ncourse because the teacher wasn\u2019t great. I had marvelous teachers of Polish literature, one of them\nbecame my role model. I think she played an important part in my choice of this profession later.\nWe had a teacher of German literature, we had mathematics, which was not my subject somehow or\nother. But I couldn\u2019t afford to have a \u2018B\u2019 ever so my parents hired a tutor. I fell in love with the\ntutor, my first adolescent crush, and a learned it and I passed exams very well. Then we had a lot of\ngym. I wasn\u2019t great in gym, just passing. What else did we have? Certainly geography and history,\nhistory was always my great interest and remained so. Geography and history. In the University, I\nhad to decide, study was history. I believe that you don\u2019t understand people without history. In\nthose days, I didn\u2019t understand it but now I teach my students that you do not understand people\nwithout knowing history of their people. Well, we\u2019ll come to it later, but anyway, I consider it as\npart of the web of the personality, historic events. Those days I did not understand it this way, just\nliked history. Every single strut in the roadway, you know, I had to memorize. We had to, we had\nto decide a in High School and I was very good at it because I memorized Mickiewicz, Schen-\nkavitch (ph), Krasinski, these were the very famous, and later came the positivists and I was really,\nthis was my life! It still is, reading, I\u2019m still an addict in reading. I don\u2019t remember now because\nmy mind doesn\u2019t work well but in those days I absorbed it all.",
        "Q: What attracted you to the positivists?",
        "A: It was lit, oh sure, it was after the romantics who needed a pause! Orzeszkowa, Aun-jus-kov-a\n(ph). The other day, they had a few months ago, they had a film festival of Polish movies and there\nwas a marvelous, marvelous movie of Orzeszkowa, I forgot what it was, it was fantastically well\ndone, but the positivists. And then when I came to the, this was all in High School. It\u2019s amazing, I\ndidn\u2019t have any conflict with Poles at that point. I studied so many years in high school, we were\ntotally isolated. We didn\u2019t experience it.\nI didn\u2019t know, my father had some customers who were Polish, but I didn\u2019t have any contact. So,\nanti-Semitism was nothing that was experienced personally except that it wasn\u2019t it, but you knew it\nwas there.",
        "Q: Did your parents talk about it?",
        "A: No. I knew that my father would bribe the tax accountants, when they came, the tax man. He\nwould send them fantastic sets of porcelain for Christmas, as I remember, because of our discussion\nwhat to choose for these people, so they were bribed. He would give some of them discounts, I\nknow, that later saved my life in strange ways. The Ukrainians were very poor. This was a Polish\nregime and Ukrainians were both illiterate and poor. They were peasants, they would come into\nstore barefoot, I remember that. And they would always buy dishes which were considered very\ninferior, fiance (ph), ceramic. They were painted. They would buy big dishes, painted, big dishes\nfor soup, or whatever else. But the fine porcelain was always for the Polish and for some of the\nJewish families too. But my father did more than this, handling the people from the city, but from\nall over they came. It was an established business for the Province. And the provincial peasants\nwere very, very many. So we got both the Ukrainian peasants would come in and the Polish people\nwere the aristocracy, in a way. And then there were Jewish people with money. This was the\nclientele and there were many helpers in the store and that\u2019s where I picked up Yiddish because they\nspoke Yiddish to a very large extent. We had a bookkeeper who survived the war, we had my\nbrother-in-law, my older sister\u2019s, her husband later joined and he had the presentation of chandeliers\nand enamel bath tubs.",
        "Q: Enamel what?",
        "A: Bath tubs. Tubs for the bath. This was all new because there was no way of having any, water\ndidn\u2019t come into the apartment so you had to pour it, so the bath tubs we had for that luxury of\ntaking a bath. And he was doing very well this way but it was part of the business. So that\u2019s where,\nYiddish you could hear in the store, they spoke Yiddish, these boys. One of them survived, I met\nhim after the war, I couldn\u2019t believe it, but, the rest were all killed. I remember seeing them over\nthe, over in the ghetto.\nBut, I, so I was sort of isolated or protected from actual confrontation with anti-Semitism, but as I\nsaid, it was always in the air. For instance, on Yom Kipper my parents would go to synagogue,\nnaturally, we girls stayed home. And we always barricaded ourselves. We were afraid always to\nstand in the window or on the balcony, the balcony was a big part of our life. We lived on the main\nstreet called Kol-soy-o1 (ph), you could see people walk back and forth and my mother was very\norientated towards clothes, she was critical of this, this dress is too long and this is too short and this\nis too bright and so on, but on Yom Kipper night, some of these nights it was forbidden for us to\nshow our faces, this I remembered. We worried, although we never experienced it, that some of the\nPolish or Ukrainian goons will come and knock out windows so there was this sense of panic all the\ntime. In our town there were so many Jews, half of the population was Jewish. You could see the\ndifference. Suddenly it was very dark, it was very quiet, all the stores were closed, most stores\nbelonged to the Jews. No body moved, nothing moved. And then you always thought, somebody\nwill come, knock at the door, knock out the window, it happened occasionally but I myself did not\nexperience this. But I do recall the feeling of some anxiety, perhaps even panic, that it might\nhappen. So I say, I knew about it, but not in a personal way. Yom Kipper was very difficult, we all\npassed it, I didn\u2019t after a certain age, but Yom Kipper I remember as it was dark in the apartment.\nThere was a very severe fast. The breaking of the fast, people were very tired or slowly coming out\nof synagogues, they were praying all day there. This I remember with a great deal of pain. The\nKlezmar would come, to pray for us, a happy, ah, these people were very poor. These are older\nJews. Very poor, and they would go from house to house. It was my job, because I was the\nyoungest at home, I didn\u2019t go to synagogue and because I was there while my parents had to come\nfrom the synagogue, to give them some food to break the fast. I remember as a child carrying that\ntray of honey cake. And they would pray, they would pray and then they would go, sometimes they\ncame back later at dinner time. I still mourn these Klezmar because they were so poor. It was so\nwrong that a night like that, after fast, they had to go and pray. The Klas-mas(ph) music has not\nsurvived, the type of pain when I hear, it\u2019s not good, it\u2019s not authentic enough for me.\nI must be honest, there\u2019s very few people who remember how it was. They played in short sleeved\noutfits, I can\u2019t even, Perlman plays. He\u2019s doing it well I suppose but he\u2019s not good enough for me\nbecause I remember the authentic players. Who could teach these young people here, they all went\nto the ovens. This is the story of the Klezmar in our home town, they always played at weddings,\nthe weddings for my family were very big, and none of them survived from what I know. Anyway,\nit was not right that people who have suffered so much poverty and so much indignity should ever\nhave to end up this way. It wasn\u2019t fair. But in our home town, this was the story, this was true for\nmany of the other little towns too, all over Poland, particularly in these places. So, this was Yom\nKipper, my parents would come home, always with headaches, tired, but breaking the fast was\nunlike here where you often have loks or these things, or there has to be hot chicken soup and the\nKlezmar would come back to play and then they ate with us a little, but it was a difficult, a very\ndifficult holiday for us. There was no joy at all. Then came Sukkot and Sukkot I remember very\nvividly because the Sukkot(ph) in our home was big. The entry to the apartment was a very big\nhallway and it didn\u2019t have windows but it had ceiling window, there was a name for it? When\nthere\u2019s a windows in the ceiling, you know what I mean?",
        "Q: Sky light?",
        "A: Sky light. There was a very big room with a sky light and actually two of the other rooms, one\nwas a children\u2019s room, also had a sky light. Anyway, the sky light in the foyer, the very big foyer\nwas removed for Sukkot and branches of trees, 1t was covered with tree branches because Sukkot is\na special holiday. My father would being in many people from the synagogue and they danced,\neverybody! By the way, every Sukkotbot, I had to bring an Oye Nak-a-dom (ph) home and Oye\n(ph) was a guest from the synagogue. There wasn\u2019t a time that there wouldn\u2019t come an Oye (ph),\nmy father had to bring an Oye (ph). Somebody who was poor, who was stranded in the city and\nneeded a meal. A shabbat meal. Once my father came without an Oye (ph) and I remember how\nupset my mother was and he had, poor man, he had to go back to the synagogue and find an Oye\n(ph). There were always some poor people stranded. One Oye (ph) Ill never forget. It must have\nbeen 1938 by then because he told us that he came from Zbaszyn. Zbaszyn was a place, you know\nabout it, to which the Polish Jews were thrown by the Germans and he somehow or other, he\nwandered and wandered around, he came to Kolomyja, a long way from Zbonsheen, which was on\nthe Zbaszyn border and he began to tell us a little bit about what happened.\nBut I think it was hushed over in some way, at least I don\u2019t remember details. I remember that Oye\n(ph). Another steady one, every Sukkot-bot (ph) was the matchmaker in town. My sisters got\nmarried by matchmaker, through a matchmaker. The matchmaker, he was treated very well, but he\nalways said, he\u2019s not going to eat, he just came for Kiddish. But, to eat you had to wash your hands\nso he refused to wash his hands because he only came for Kiddish. So the Kiddish was a lot of\nappetizers, three or four appetizers, and a lot of sweets and he was not eating, but he came, every\nSukkot-bot (ph) he came because my father had daughters to marry off. And he knew there would\nbe money there so all my sisters married and when it came to me, he looked me\nover. The coming of age, he noticed my body, that it was getting ready for marriage. He started\nlooking at me more seriously, but I escaped him. So I never married through a matchmaker, I\nmarried my husband, very independent wife. But the matchmaker was at our shabbat table every\nSaturday without eating. I always laughed because he ate about three appetizers you know. The\nJewish food was gefilte fish and it was pitch\u00e9 and it was something else, chopped liver, three, four\nappetizers and he ate all of them without washing his hands, which means he didn\u2019t eat. We all\nlaugh about it, we still remember the shabbat and they all went into the ovens. But, this was part of\nmy childhood which I resisted to a large extent because I wanted to be very Polish to him. Without\nbeing with Poles. Had a very mixed up mixture, but go ahead.",
        "Q: Did you loose the little accent that you had when you first went to school, so instead of speaking\nPolish?",
        "A: Yes. My Polish is fine. I lost the accent and I must have made some sort of silent determination\nthat I\u2019m going to beat them at it. My Polish saved my life in some ways, in some places, some\noccasions when somebody looked suspiciously at me and I knew he was suspecting because I look\nJewish, I would open my mouth, which helped occasionally because I spoke very good Polish.\nNow my Polish ain\u2019t so good. But my German is better now, amazingly so. Yes.",
        "Q: You went to University in 1936?",
        "A: 1936 I entered University again.",
        "Q: And how did that happen, was this usual for young women?",
        "A: No, not at all. Very few, there was no gymnasium for Jewish women, there was only the\ngymnasium with the nuns, the Ursulanki nuns ran a Catholic, high school for Catholic girls and all\nPolish girls were Catholic.\nSo there was nothing for me but that when my parents together with nine others created the\ngymnasium. I came to the University, I certainly wanted to go to University and I wanted to study\nPolish literature, there was no question about what I wanted to study. I was the youngest at home,\nthe only one at home. My sisters were married by then. And lived away. So for them, the lose of\ntheir mezunka, the youngest is the mezunka, usually the favorite child in many Jewish families, but\nwith me it was doubly so. They were extremely unhappy about it, they wouldn\u2019t hear about it.\nWell, how could I make my parents hear me this way? I went on a hunger strike. For my parents, a\nchild wouldn\u2019t eat, was the greatest tragedy. They could not stand my, they couldn\u2019t stand the\nseparation from me, I suppose. They worried about a girl going away to a big city, what will\nhappen to her? They worried about kashrut, where will I eat there? And they worried about\nthemselves, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sure they couldn\u2019t face each other all alone. All the sisters were gone\nand they were still young people but they felt as if they felt old. So my father made a decision to go\nto his Rabbi. At that time the Rabbi didn\u2019t come to us anymore. He was old and he didn\u2019t travel, I\nsuppose. He lived some where near Sigit, somewhere very far, it was Romania at that point. And to\ngo to Romania from Poland you needed passports by then, you needed visas, you needed foreign\ncurrency, it was both the Polish government and the Romanian government made it very difficult.\nBut my father found a way and he went to the Rabbi. To consult with him, what to do about this\nstubborn, little daughter. So the Rabbi, in his wisdom, I doubt if his experience was questioned, he\nsaid, if she is as smart as a boy, you treat her as if she were a boy, send her to study. Father came\nback and I went to study. And that is the story on how I went to study. My parents outfitted me and\nI was always outfitted for every occasion, and I went to live off and they made arrangements with a\ndistant relative to house me. She was in Boughf, Lemberg. She was married to a man who didn\u2019t\nmake a living, the name was Fisch, so there was hidden poverty, a little hidden poverty. I had a\nsmall room there, kept extremely well for me. The woman worked very hard, again, I had a lot of\npain because she treated me exceptionally. I had to have the best meat and the best food and they\nskimped and it was very painful for me to look at all these things. But that\u2019s how it was and she\nwas getting 100 zlotys a month, which in those days was much money, and the whole family lived\noff it. There was one daughter, a little younger than I. So this was what they lived off.\nThe first day, I get outfitted, my new outfit, and I go to the University and I\u2019m small and I look very\nyoung. I look much younger than my seventeen and a half years, I looked a little childish in a way.",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: Seventeen and a half. Close to eighteen, in fact, when the Rabbi, when he married me later he\nwondered whether my father was telling my age, I looked so young. But, I come to the University,\nit looked so big. It looked so tremendous and here in front of the big door stand two Polish goons\nand Endeki, Polish Fascists. And there are big posters in front of the door saying, this is a week\nwithout Jews. This, as I remember, is October, 1936. A week without Jews, I don\u2019t understand\nwhat they\u2019re talking about, so I\u2019m trying to get through and I see they\u2019re hostile faces. Anyway, I\ncame to my classroom and I recall they wanted me to sit down on the left benches. The classrooms\nwere very big, at least to the eyes of the young girl from a small town, and they arranged that all\nPolish students were to sit on the right side and the Jewish students were to take the ghetto benches,\nthe left side. Before I went to them, I already had some information from the Jewish-Polish society\nof students, and they told me about it, and they told me Jewish students will not take the left\nbenches, the ghetto benches, but we will stand. So I looked for the Jewish students, there was no\nbody else, I was the only Jewish student. And to the right side were about, 200 perhaps, Polish\nstudents and I\u2019m the little thing standing at the door. To cut it short, for the next three years, I stood\nat that door. I took all my University classes in the standing position. I never sat down. It was\ngetting worse every day. There were weeks without Jews, there were special treatment of Jews.\nThe professors were unbelievably anti-semetic. The professors stood and they could see around,\nthey were a little high on the podium, and it was a requirement of each student to hand over the\nindexes, it was a little book in which you would put a signature that you had attended classes, we\nhad to have that to attend every class in Polish literature. And as I put, and he would pause at the\nend of the session, he would put his signature. One of them, Professor Tasycki, he was the expert in\nthe Polish language, not literature, but language for say, phonics. He saw my name, Matylda\nHirsch, he took a look, he threw it at the floor.\nAnd the students applauded. I don\u2019t know what made me go back. I just don\u2019t know. It was sheer\nanger, I suppose. Or sheer sukkotme of going home without finishing it. I was so defenseless. I\nwas in such a fright. Everyday, I would literally vomit with anxiety, of entering that University. At\none point, they pushed me and they pushed me down and something I held on that I didn\u2019t break my\nbody. One point I remember, a highlight in my University studies. Professor Julius Kleiner, may\nhis memory be blessed. The saying was that he was half Jewish, a quarter Jewish, one-eighth\nJewish, whatever 1t was. He was a very famous professor, an expert on the famous poet, Julius\nSlowacki. His name was Julius Kleiner, and it was the same, Julius and Julius. He introduced us to\nsome understanding of the influence of Freud on literature. To me, it was all very new. But he was\nextremely prestigious lecturer of Polish literature, particularly about Slowacki. And he saw me,\nevery time, standing at the doorway, all alone, as I was very insignificant little looking, very small.\nOne day, he moves from his katedra, all the way down to the doorway, I thought he was walking\nout, he takes me under his arm, he brings me up to the podium and he asked me to take the chair.\nWell! I refused to take the chair. I just stood, he finished his lecture, as he walked down, the\nstudents threw eggs at him. Lucky they didn\u2019t throw stones. Many times, they carried stones. Most\nof the time, by the way, he was later killed, I believe, but I have lost contact. The Endecki would\ntake, would carry sticks, what do you call it? Sticks? With a Gillette at the bottom of it.",
        "Q: A razor.",
        "A: A razor, yes. And they would always try to hurt some Jewish student. Once he killed one. This\nwas a friend of my husband\u2019s, came later. Well, these were the days, I would get home extremely\ndepressed. Would study in this extremely small room, which they kept very clean, special for me. I\nwould study, my mind was everywhere else, but I still had all these papers, sometimes were very\ngood. We had a professor of Polish phonetics, this was a woman, she was a docent, a docent meant\nan associate professor, docent to Professor Taszcki, so she didn\u2019t have as much power as he but she\nwas a miserable creature, she looked like a monkey. She was horrible in every way and she focused\non me. And she focused on my podzigbienie.\nwhich means, old church Slavonic. The old church Slavonic, she wanted to test it in some way and\nshe made experiments. Only years later did I realize that these were experiments taken out of racial\nbooks, but I wasn\u2019t aware of it. She put powder on our, what do you call that part? Of the most\npodzigbienie, I\u2019m saying it in Polish, podzigbienie, and she would have us pronounce vocals. And\nshe wanted to study it and photograph, all were experiments, which I couldn\u2019t understand, but she\nwanted to tell us how we pronounce this vowel, how we pronounce, what is the other, the\nconsonant. This was all taken of Nazi books, which occurred to me only many years later. This\nwas Professor Dluga was her name. Terrible creature! And who does she play with? The one\nJewish student, that was me.\nTape II",
        "Q: Maria, we were talking about the three, it was three years, in Lvov, four years before you\ngraduated?",
        "A: It was four years, but the fourth year the Russians were there and the University has changed\ntotally by then.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a little bit about the three years. What gave you the strength to go to school, I\nmean, talking about throwing up everyday before you go, I mean, was extraordinary stress!",
        "A: I did not throw up everyday but I felt nauseous and I threw up occasionally, but the nausea was\npart of the anxiety. I felt some sense of resistance, that I cannot leave. The Jewish organization\nhelped us to a large extent because I knew this was happening to other students too. The thing that\nmobilized my anger rather than my anxiety was a funeral of a student in the medical studies. He\nwas literally killed in the classroom. His name just escapes me, I wish I could remember, but he\nwas a close friend of a man who later became my husband. This was a tremendous funeral,\nsomewhere or other, I felt this solidarity of people and I wasn\u2019t alone. It was very unfortunate that\nin the study of Polish literature I was the only Jew and that feeling of isolation was the worst part of\nall of it. But then, I suddenly found myself in that procession of hundreds of students and I got this\nsense of strength from the numbers. But it was extremely difficult and I always prayed that the\nclass be over and vacation come, each time there was a holiday, naturally I would go home. My\nparents were overjoyed in seeing me, I never told them the story of what was going on. I recall,\nthey would bring back the big, big pots and pans when I came because for themselves, they were on\ndiets, and the cooking was very limited, so when I came there were again celebrations. There was\nsome joy in the house again. I think it was in my, let me see, it was in my third year of studies,\nsecond or third, I can\u2019t remember, that I went to the library to pick up a Polish book and the\nlibrarian told me that the book was just checked out. I said, who took it? She said, this man, this\nyoung student. I walk over to the student and I say, I need this book. He says, he wants to read it\ntoo. And I said, are you a student of Polish literature? He say, no, he studies pharmacology, the\nmedical school. So I said, but I\u2019m a student of Polish literature and I need the book for an exam.\nHe says, well, you're quite stubborn about it. I say, yes, please help me with it. We started talking.\nHe was from my home town, I never knew him, but I knew of his parents because people knew of\nthe businesses.\nHis parents had a apotheketer (ph), pharmacy and everybody knew the pharmacy and I did. So he\nwas one of their sons, the youngest son. Well, arguing over the book, we became lovers. And this\nchanged my life immediately. I wasn\u2019t alone. Nunek and I were going home, at least for vacations,\nmy father was very unhappy when I declared I wanted to marry him. Because his family, unlike my\nown, was extremely assimilated to the extent that I think they would eat on Yom Kippur, which was\nunusual. They carried it to an extreme. His father was for generations, they had that pharmacy.\nThey prided themselves in being extremely assimilated Jews. Well again, in my _ usual\nstubbornness, my parents had to give in, so my father remembered that as a very young child, he\nwent to the chedet together with this man who had a few classes there, so they patched it up in some\nway and they came and there was an engagement. It was 1938 or 1939. We became engaged and\nmy life naturally changed because I wasn\u2019t alone, he was just about to finish his study, I had another\ntwo years to go. That summer..",
        "Q: Tell me when you met?",
        "A: I met him, I think 1t was 1938, two years after.",
        "Q: Was he your first man?",
        "A: My first boyfriend. Well, I had some boyfriends before. My first crush was on the teacher, then\nI had a boy that, my parents arranged for me to meet boys in their house, which means dancing, so it\nwas always chaperoned. And I remember a crush on a young man who was later killed. And this\nwas my first crush, but my first intimate relationship was this boy, my fiancee, Nunek Najder. It\nwasn\u2019t engaged really, we started living together in a way, yes.",
        "Q: What attracted you to him, do you think?",
        "A: He loved Polish literature and yet he was in a different profession, so definitely yes, he was very\nassimilated and I always struggled with this thing, you know? We had a lot in common because of\nPolish literature. And we belonged to the Jewish Student Association, life changed. I wasn\u2019t alone.\nAnd I think, my later years, being alone was a real tragedy. When I was hiding, later. But, Nunek\nwas extremely affectionate with me, extremely devoted to me. We just seemed to be the right kind\nof a couple, both young, he was two years older than I. We would go home for vacations and there\nwere always celebrations about it.\nOne day, for a long vacation one summer we decided to go into the wild mountains. I was very\nmuch into hiking. Until a few years ago I was into it. And he too. This was the major sport for\nmany young, Jewish people. He didn\u2019t belong to an organization, he was the assimilated sort of\ncategory of Jews. But when he saw what was happening in the University, he became extremely\nangry at those Poles. But one day we decided to go to a new, brand new hostel on one of the\nhighest mountains on the Carpatian Mountains, this was called the Chomiak. It was just discovered\nrecently and they built a hostel there. Hard to get there, after a point we were able to go by a car,\nlater had the march and was very far away. It was brand new, it smelled delicious I remember, there\nwas one more couple from Warsaw, Polish people. And I recall the distance we had from them and,\nwe were the only four people, very far away. No body could get there. I do recall that they had a\nsort of sense of superiority over us. They knew immediately that we were Jewish, although I looked\nJewish, my husband never did and he spoke Polish beautifully. He came from a family of long, of\nlong history of assimilated Jews. But somehow or the other, they sensed it. So although we ate\ntogether, there was a sense of distance and there was our sense of looking up at them. This I still\nremember. Well, it was a great experience, to be all alone in this stunning part of the mountains,\nthis 1s above Bor-auk-na (ph), Bor-auk-na (ph) was a village and from there we went to the\nChomiak. Later on, Chomiak became a popular place. When the vacation was over, it was the Ist\nof September, 1939. Vacation was over, we went back to the village to take the train to Kolomyyja.\nIt was a Sunday afternoon, we saw many, no, don\u2019t remember why I think it was a Sunday, I\nthought it was Sunday because many Ukrainian peasants were trying to read posters. When we\ncame to the posters, it was a Declaration of War. That Germany has just declared war on Poland. It\nwas September Ist, 1939. Shows you how totally unprepared we were for it. People lived in\nWarsaw, not the cities, knew much more. We seemed to have been totally isolated from it,\nparticularly when we were up in the mountains there for many weeks.",
        "Q: Were you aware of what was going on in Germany?",
        "A: We knew a little, what was going on in Germany, it was Nazi Germany. We didn\u2019t know how\nmuch impact they had on our, on Polish students.\nActually, when I later studied it, the tactics of the Polish students were cut out of text books from\nthe Nazi literature. We didn\u2019t know enough. When you lived in the western part of Poland you\ncertainly knew more about it. You didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t, and my husband didn\u2019t know either. But I recall\nthat day, later in the afternoon, I don\u2019t know why I think it was Sunday, the only reason that I think\nso is that when peasants just be all together in the center of the square. We read this, we didn\u2019t\nreally realize the importance of it. We were Polish patriots, strangely enough. Both of us had\nmilitary preparation, I had it in my high school days. All boys and all girls had to have military\npreparation. Which meant we were taught how to wear uniforms, how to march. He had to be\ntaught, I\u2019m sure, how to shoot. I wasn\u2019t, but to march in parades and to march in case of a war. We\nknew all these things, there was, forgot the name, Polskin, gosh how could I remember, forget these\nnames, anyway it was war preparation, that every high school student had to participate in. We took\nthe train and we thought perhaps we\u2019ll go into the war, perhaps we\u2019ll march, we just didn\u2019t\nunderstand any of it. When I came home I saw the gloom on my parents face, they knew more.\nThey had participated in World War I and they knew that war is not only songs and marches. This\nwas September Ist, 1939. Within weeks, the Russian army moved in. I didn\u2019t know then, but there\nwas a pact between Ribintrope (ph) and Molotov (ph) and they declared that Poland should be\ndivided. Our part of Poland fell to the Soviets. This was within two or three weeks that the Soviet\narmy marched in. I remember the night when they marched in. It was very, what was the word for\nit? The song sounded very attractive, it was mesmerizing. They were marching and their songs\nwere beautiful, I still remember their songs. And I was very much pulled somewhat or other, I\nalways was liberal, I was always poor. Many of their ideas, 1t seemed that, they were bring some\nemployment and dignity to the poor people. But, on the other hand, I could see from my parents\nexpression that they were worried and we didn\u2019t know what the future would be, so it was strong. I\nremember distinctly that night when they marched in and I recall the song, they sang these songs,\nfor some reason. Well, we went back to Lvov to study. My husband was just finished then, I think.",
        "Q: Can you sing one of the songs?",
        "A: Gosh, [singing], oh, I can\u2019t remember anymore. If tomorrow is war, we will defend Stalin and\neverywhere we will be the victors. So, it had a mesmerizing quality for some reason because I was\nin conflict. But I did go back to finish my studies. The University was totally different by then. By\nthe way, I was married by, this was 1940, I was just married by then. Well, come back to my\nwedding for a minute, it was already a very quiet wedding. I never wanted a wedding in a white\ngown, I was a very feminist kind of a woman, liberal kind of a women. I was not interested in all\nthese trappings of the bourgeoisie, which was very much the bad and good part of my background,\nmainly through my mother.\nSo I always dreamed that I'll just escape with my husband or I\u2019Il have a very small wedding, but\nanyway when the time came it was, the Soviets had just come in at that point and I was married, I\ncan\u2019t remember the month which 1s insane, but I know it was 1940. It was the year when I was just\nabout to graduate. The Rabbi of our town was a close friend of my father, Rabbi Lowe (ph). His\nnephew is the chief Rabbi of Israel now. The other nephew was chief counsel of Israel for New\nYork, the United States, I knew both of them, I met them later. But that Rabbi questioned my\nfather, he said, you say she\u2019s of age to marry? She looks like a child. I just happened to look very\nyoung. So the outfit for my wedding was a nice little navy suit and flat-heel shoes and a little veil, I\nthink. The wedding was in our own apartment in our parents home. There were hardly any guests,\nthe Soviets had just come 1n and the business was already taken over by the Soviets. My father kept\nsaying that he cannot give me much a dowry because of the war, because the Soviets have taken\nover everything, but after the war he will re1mburse me for it, Pll get more dowry than any of the\nother girls, and all the girls got good dowries. And I didn\u2019t think of a dowry at all, to me this was all\nvery uninteresting. All I remember that, the day of the wedding, later we took the train and went\nback to study and, in Re-volf (ph), and sitting on the train I wore that wedding band and he did too\nand a Polish woman sits there across from us, she says, these days children have such a way of\nlying. You wear wedding bands, you're both children! He looked very young too, strange as it all\nsounds now. But we finished our studies and the University was a totally different institutions. The\nSoviets have changed it totally. While anti-Semitism was somewhat there, it certainly was there, it\nwas not official but there are no more Jewish students in my department. I mean, there was no\nquestion in what I mixed with others. What I recall was extremely cold winter of 1940. The\nSoviets suddenly did not have any steam anymore, everything was just taken away, including the\nsteam, how they managed that I don\u2019t know. But whatever they could put their eyes on was taken\nback to Russia. I recall going to the opera house, we were involved in opera, and seeing the Russian\nladies in nightgowns because they thought these were evening gowns, and I recall in our, when they\ntook our store they removed everything so my father still removed some dishes for bartering later\nwhich helped us for a long time. The Soviets nationalized the store, actually local people who\nbecame communist, who were communist, but now became very important officials, they came to\nhelp the Soviet soldiers to nationalize the store. For my father it was a terrible tragedy because to\nhim the business was his life to a very large extent and suddenly he was without anything. The\nsame happened to my father-in-law, his was also nationalized by the Soviets. To these\npeople, they suddenly became old, and they were really not older at that point but everything was\ntaken away from them, they felt. So, the study was very different. I had my final exams, they had\nto be in the Russian language. We all had to study from the green book, I remember under my arm,\nand every student had it under their arm, every University student has this green book. Very cheap\npaper in green cover, it was called the korr-up-tik qual for Bolshovitski Party (ph), which means\nThe Short Course of the Bolshevik Party and was full of propaganda which I didn\u2019t realize at that\ntime that it was propaganda, but it was about Stalin and it was about the Revolution. One chapter I\nliked very much was the Marxist dialectic philosophy, it was very well written. It seemed to have\nsome, no, actually the Hagalien (ph) dialectic philosophy, it made sense. It had some large\nexpressions to be a lot of propaganda. But we had to study every page and every word of it and the\nfinal exam, when they examined me in Polish literature, I had to talk in Russian. I mastered the\nlanguage very quickly. I forgot 1t very quickly too, you know I hardly know any. But this was a\nyear in Re-volf (ph), the final year. I was a newly wedded woman, my parents were depressed over\nwhat happened, what was going on, they were forever feared that they may be deported, that the\nRussians would deport them. At one point, they actually would go home from time to time, at one\npoint they came to take my parents away. They always did it in the middle of the night. They were\nclassified as bourgeois and this was a very bad certification and, in the middle of the night they\ncame always with their rifles, rifling at the door. We always were afraid. And they took them to the\nrailway station to take them to Siberia. I recall I was home at that point and my sisters was home at\nthat point, and we ran to the railway station. It was a lot of bribes to get them back home. I wish we\ndidn\u2019t, but that\u2019s what happened. The bribes were always vodka and chof-socks (ph). Chof-socks\n(ph) were watches, they loved watches. The Soviets had absolutely nothing, it\u2019s unbelievable, how\nthey took everything, taken back to Russia. For the first time they saw goods, which they haven\u2019t\nseen. We didn\u2019t realize how the revolution had changed life there in those politics in poverty,\nunless among the highest officials, I suppose. So, they always ordered leather coats and when they\nordered leather coats, they had to be to the floor because they figured when they go back and the\nwinter is cold, they will cut and make a pair of boots, this was . So, chof-socks (ph)\nand leather coats and our fine porcelain, all of it went somewhere with the Russian families\neventually back to Russia. This was the Soviets, but I finished school and then they didn\u2019t permit\nme to live in Re-volf (ph), didn\u2019t permit me or my husband, because we were categorize as\nbourgeois. And the Soviet law was that if you were in this category, you weren\u2019t quite an animal in\nSocialism but you were somewhere not to be trusted so you had to live fifty miles away from a large\ncity. Everybody wanted to live in a large city, so they punished us. Instead of taking us to Siberia\nlike they wanted to take my parents, who were considered useless, they figured two young people,\nthese professionals, will be useful. So the law was that you had to move fifty miles away from Re-\nvolf (ph) and there were these centers. They had a very bright idea, good idea, is to open up\nhospitals and pharmacies in the villages of the Polish Ukraine, which had nothing. There was never\na school there, never a hospital, never a pharmacy, and the Soviets had a network of these things,\nvery smart, the Poles never give them any credit for it. But they did, so they opened up a hospital in\na place called Glen-na-novaria (ph). You never heard of it, I never heard of it. It was a real loss, it\nwas a village in where there was no sidewalk. When a train, your shoe got stuck right in the mud.\nIt had a name, mud was a part of the name, so this is where they sent us to work. My husband, they\nwanted to open a pharmacy, how did they open a pharmacy? They took from the Russian church,\nfrom the parochial house, they took the house and they opened a pharmacy. My husband opened\nthe pharmacy and me, they wanted to teach in school and, because I wasn\u2019t prepared to teach young\nchildren, I was prepared to teach at gymnasium, I had a Masters Degree by then, my gis-trof-o-\nsovisia (ph) which was a high Degree. So I was not versed in high school or anything, so they said I\ncould be an assistant to my husband. I learned how to make ca-go-cheekie (ph), was a little\nmedication against headaches. And I would wrap it. Very often at night we heard them, heard the\nSoviet soldiers knock at the door with the rifle. Each time we were prepared they would take us to\nSiberia. What they wanted were condoms. In the middle of the night, they would rifle at the door\nfor condoms. This was 1940. I thought we were lucky to have jobs, we had enough food. There\nwere three Jewish families, us, a Jewish doctor from Germany who was somehow or other came\nthere and opened a hospital, it was all public works, and a Jewish teacher from Ha-riza (ph). That\u2019s\nwhere all your Ukrainian peasants, everybody was illiterate there, absolutely illiterate. So the three\nof us, sometimes they played cards, I was reading books always, but anyway, one day we went to\nvacation and my father, you know, was so desperate about once more to stand behind a pharmacy\ncounter. Once more to be an upper taker. So with a great deal of difficulty, we arranged for him to\ncome to our place in Glen-na-novaria (ph) for two weeks vacation and we would go to their home in\nKolomyja. It took us a lot of work to arrange that exchange. Well, it happened. We went there,\nhome, we stayed in their home for two weeks and my father and mother-in-law went to our little\nplace and took over the pharmacy to the greatest joy for this old man. And we were suppose to,\nafter two weeks vacations we were suppose to go back. And it was the 21st of June, 1941, and you\nknow the rest of the story. We didn\u2019t expect any of it. We said good-bye to my parents, we had\nrailway tickets to go the next day back to Re-volf (ph) and from there by horse and carriage to go to\nGlen-na-novaria (ph) and, in the middle of the night, I hear a lot of noise. I look out of the window,\nit was one in the morning, I see Soviet women and children being put on trucks. I woke my\nhusband, I say, they must be going to summer camps. But it seemed to be so noisy and so many\ntrucks, middle of the night. I opened the radio and here Hitler\u2019s voice comes across. Today I\ndeclared war on Bolshevism and the Jews. And I knew things were very bad. The first thing in the\nmorning, we ran to the railway station to get to that place. The trains did not run anymore. Nothing\nfor civilians. We were stuck in Kolomyyja, his parents were stuck in that little hole. Two weeks\nlater we got a card, they were both shot. The Germans walked into the pharmacy, they were\nrenounced as Jews and they were shot. This was the end of my husband\u2019s parents. We were stuck\nin Kolomyja and first the Hungarians came to cover our city. I remember them wearing these very\nhigh hats with feathers. They didn\u2019t do much harm at that point yet. Somehow or other I recall a\ntruck of children, a truck with children. I had no idea who these children were, but the children, the\ntruck was covered but you could hear cries. We were living then at the home of my parents and I\nremember my father said to me and my sister, my sister had run away from Nova-som (ph), from\nthe western part where the Germans had been already for two years, she came to our home town.\nAnd the Russians first were looking for her to send her to Siberia but anyway she got out of it and\nthe Hungarians were there and my father said, bring the children a little hot water, it was a cold day.\nSo we run with a china of hot water and we hear the whimper of the children and suddenly shots\ncome. They were directed at us, at my sister and myself. I remember we threw this hot water, the\nchina, on the sidewalk. This was my first confrontation with real terror. But the Hungarians by and\nway were pretty innocent at the beginning, a least we didn\u2019t know. Within a few weeks, the\nGermans marched in. And now I know from history but those days I didn\u2019t know that right in the\nback of the soldiers came the SS. They always were out and we didn\u2019t know the difference between\nan SS and a soldier and everything has been blamed on the SS but I now know that the soldiers were\nindistinguisukkotble from the SS because they participated as much. But anyway, everyday there\nwas a new directive, a new poster. Today the Jews have to register and tonight the Jews have to\nobserve curfew, and then Jews had to deliver all the gold and silver and then Jews have to deliver all\nthe fur coats. And I remember standing in a long, long line on a very cold day, shivering and\ndelivering fur coats. When I got married my parents bartered some of their porcelain things with a\nfurrier who made two fur coats for me, not one but two, during the last year of my studies. It helped\nimmensely because the University was so cold and I recall taking classes everyday bundled up in\nthat fur coat. Anyway, with these two fur coats I stood in line, we all stood in line to deliver to the\nGermans. And I recall coming to the window, the German official, and he would register my name\nand address and the fur coat, the length of the fur coat, what it was made of. One was a tweed lined\nwith beaver, the other was a sealskin coat, and he gave me a receipt of it and I figured, well, if after\nthe Winter passes I\u2019Il get it back, whatever. My ivory tables endless. And then came the ax-e-on-a\n(ph), the activists. All these names, we didn\u2019t know, we called them ax-e-on-a (ph) because the\nGermans called it ax-e-on-a (ph). The raids. There was not a ghetto yet. I remember in the\nbeginning, one of the raids was suddenly we saw people being dragged with ropes around their\nbodies. This was the action against the intellectuals, the doctors. We knew the Jewish doctor so\nwell. This was a diversion, when sometime in 1940 when the Soviets were there, I was an assured\nvacation, Passover vacation at home. We were married then and my husband left at 6:00 in the\nmorning I was suppose to take a later train, I do not remember why. I leaned out of the window,\nthis was 1940 in Kolomyja and it was a sukkotrp, cool morning and I felt a terrible pain in my\nbreast, in my lungs, my chest. And within a few hours, the doctors were there and they told me I\nhave pneumonia, double pneumonia. In those days there was no treatment for pneumonia. My\nhusband came back immediately, my father-in-law who still knew a lot about ;\nanyway, they got together. Sulfur was a way of treatment, but the medical knowledge at that point\nwas if you lived seven days, I was pretty much unconscious with an extremely high fever, if you\nlived seven days, if you lived through the seven days you survive, otherwise you die at the seventh\nday. So they put cups, what they called cups, glass cups on my chest, which I hated, but worse, they\nbrought leeches. And the leeches were always used medicinally by a barber, I don\u2019t know why.\nThe barber has a jar of leeches. I can\u2019t remember, half conscious as I was, I kept sukkotking my\nhead, I don\u2019t want leeches but he put leeches. And whether the hot cups or the leeches or my\nfather\u2019s prayers, whichever it was I woke up saying, I\u2019m hungry, and this was the end of my\npneumonia. Almost the whole town was involved in my pneumonia. The three doctors were day\nand night and at my bed. Their names I do remember, Dr. Tye-sukkot (ph), Dr. Fry-gar (ph) and\nDr. Fleish (ph), all three of them. When I got well, and I recovered pretty quickly I was young, and\nmy mother took good care of me, I recovered, they insisted that the town should see me. They took\na fee-ak-a (ph), and-drosh-kind (ph) and a pair of horses and here were the three doctors with me\nand we traveled across the city so everybody knew I was truly alive. In those days, you didn\u2019t pick\nup a phone [to call anyone]. because I would like the names of these doctors to be\nremembered somehow or another, they were all killed. Dr. Fleish\u2019s (ph) daughter went to school\nwith me, gymnasium, is still alive in Stockholm. So coming back to the German times, this I\nremember, famous doctors were in that aux-own-der (ph) being dragged. We didn\u2019t know where\npeople were being dragged, there were all kinds of rumors. Later we found they went, dragged\noutside of town to a forest called Sukkotp-a-roth-sa (ph) and they were shot there. They had\nmachine guns there. There were all kinds of rumors that they went somewhere but somewhere or\nother it began to bother us that perhaps really the rumors that they were killed were true. We didn\u2019t\nquite want to believe it. Every few weeks there was another action. One a very sad one was a moc-\nrow-seat (ph), a very poor neighborhood where they dragged out all the Jews and for some reason\nthey focused on them and then there were, food was already beginning to be rationed, there was\nlittle food. And in 1942, it was Passover, 1942, when the posters on the wall announced that all\nJews have to go to the ghetto.",
        "Q: Can I ask you a little bit about part of this period?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: First of all, you couldn\u2019t go back to where you were living. Did you live with your parents?",
        "A: I lived with, we stayed with my parents. We occasionally stayed with his parents when the\nGermans came in. But we mainly stayed with my parents. My oldest sister, was also,\nshe had her own apartment, she and her husband and Menek lived there. We stayed with my\nparents at a big place. Occasionally we stayed with the Knight-ess (ph). This was the beginning\nwhen the Germans came and, go ahead.",
        "Q: Did you talk together about what happening or whether?",
        "A: Yes, we were very, very worried. We could see what was going on. We began to, well, we\nnever saw that all be killed, this was very hard. Some of us would disappear, we thought, the way\nthey did. People talked about the fact that these Jews were taken to the Ukraine, to the west-eastern\npart of the Ukraine to work on farms and we latched on to these stories, we really wanted to believe\nthat. Under no circumstances did we think that it would lead to gas chambers. We had no idea,\nwhen you read the memos today and they said, we knew they were going to Treblinka, they knew\nthey were going, we didn\u2019t know where they were going, it was a fact. But there were massive raids\non people. And sometimes there was shooting right in front of us so we knew that things were\nterribly bad. And there was beginning to be massive starvation. People were going hungry, but\nthere was always somebody who disappeared. You heard somebody, a cousin, an uncle, somebody\njust, just, he was taken away. The word, the expression was taken away and many survivors still\ntalk this way because we really didn\u2019t know the word, we don\u2019t know where they were killed, most\nof the time we don\u2019t know exactly when because taken away is the right expression for it because\nall we knew is we saw them disappear, being taken away. The Ukrainians were extremely involved\nwith the Germans. Actually, they were shooting as much, they were rounding us up as much. But\nthe round ups, called ax-see-on (ph), were the most characteristic part of that period. You were\nafraid of ax-see-on (ph) and you were beginning to think about hiding places. It never occurred to\nus that we would disperse among the native population. We just didn\u2019t think of it. Everybody knew\nme, I\u2019m Maria Heirsh from Kolomyja, where would I go? Then came the arm bands, the white arm\nbands we had to wear. The yellow stars we had to wear. The names that we had to take, the\nidentity cards that came, the cam-carda (ph). Where with my name was Sarah, the man, I can\u2019t\nremember the name for the man, there was another Jewish name, biblical name for man, which\nmeans we were identified this way. You couldn\u2019t move without a cam-carda (ph), you couldn\u2019t be\nout, you couldn\u2019t be in the street after 6:00, you couldn\u2019t walk on the sidewalks, everyday there\nwere new restrictions of various serious natures. There was a you-den-rot (ph) established, they\nasked my father to serve but he didn\u2019t want to serve, the chairman of the you-den-rot (ph) was a Mr.\nHorowitz. A Jewish police was established, my husband\u2019s brother volunteered for 1t because you\nfirst thought you would save Jews, later he was involved in all kinds, I assume of horrible things,\nalthough he didn\u2019t witness them. It was getting worse everyday. We didn\u2019t know what a ghetto\nwas. By the way, when the Soviets withdrew and the Germans were just about to come in my father\nin strange ways looked forward to it. He remembered the Austrians and he thought the Germans\nwould be part of it. With the Russians he couldn\u2019t communicate, they took away everything from\nhim. It was the Germans he favored since he speaks German and he remembers this. Austria the\nwhole while was for them the best part of their lives. Hammsburg, Austria - the Kaiser was good to\nthem. I remember as a child when the picture of Kaiser Franz Joseph came down in our living room\nand they hung up the picture of Marsukkotll Pil-sook-ski (ph) and I was happy about it. And they\ndid it for their children, I think. But they were very much attached to the German language, to the\nAustrians, so they didn\u2019t think that the Germans could be so bad because they really didn\u2019t know\nterribly much what was going on in Germany. And in Germany they didn\u2019t have extermination\ncamps, people immigrated. We knew someone from Bonn-sheen (ph) but our knowledge was\nlimited. The Soviets kept the knowledge away to a very large extent too. They didn\u2019t tell us what\nwas going on in western Poland because then they already had some camps. They didn\u2019t tell, the\nRussians kept it very sealed, very tightly. Any news from western Germany where many Jews\nlived. Some of them escaped during the Soviet period like my sister did, my sister Frania.",
        "Q: When the Germans came in and started the ax-see-on (ph) and you saw things on the street, even\nthough you didn\u2019t think it would be exterminations because who if any could have thought of that,\ndid you see certain groups or certain people or were men more vulnerable than women did you\nthink, or were they going to be the target?",
        "A: It was mixed, first were men which reinforced our false beliefs that they were taken to work.\nMen, to a large extent. But there was special categories taken. At one point I saw the doctors, then\ncame some of the lawyers, fathers of students with whom I went to school, one of them lives in\nCalifornia still, one is in Florida, they both were there. Their fathers were lawyers. Then it came\nfor some workers, special workers, we were told the SS needs these workers. But you could see\nsometimes shooting in the streets. Oh, the children came much later and this was a real awakening\nat that point. But, there were food limitations, severe food limitations. We were beginning to be\nquite hungry, not starved yet, but hungry. I remember the first day of Passover, this is in my mind\nvery much, 1942. There was an announcement that we all had to go to the ghetto and they\nestablished three ghettos and they assigned to us the very poor part of the city. We were permitted\nto take on carriages, I don\u2019t know why they permitted some of these carriages still, permitted to take\nwhatever we could in carriages. I remember I took a pillow, we took some dishes, a few potatoes,\nthat\u2019s all we had. And we settled in that one-room house at the end of the town, it seemed to me, a\nvery extremely poor neighborhood. It was pretty dark, it was the first at night. It must\nhave been five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, was still enough time to prepare something for dinner. I\nrecall peeling potatoes, the potatoes I saved. And suddenly I felt smoke and I looked around and the\nghetto was on fire. And we began to run. We saw people being shot, we saw houses on fire\nincluding our own. We began to run, we didn\u2019t know where to run, people are running we are\nrunning with them. They were running to the other part of the ghetto. In the other part of the ghetto\nlived my sister Frania and her husband and their child. My husband stayed behind, he wanted to\njust catch something, still save something. As we came there he arrived a few hours later, I\nremember, and his eyebrows were all burned and he came with a half-burned chicken. He caught a\nchicken in order to feel us. It was terribly bad but we left, we were alive. And each time these\nthings happen, we touched ourselves and touched each other. We are alive. This was Passover. I\nwent to my sister\u2019s place, she had a small place there. We all crowded in there, whatever food they\nhad we ate it together. We later found that many people from that part, whom they caught, they\ntook them away and that\u2019s all we knew, they took them away. And most of the time they took them\nto sukkotp-a-rof-ska (ph) and sometimes in the distance you could hear this shooting. Still, it would\nbe somebody they perhaps shot, they obviously must have taken for work, by then they took all of\nthe children and families, whole families. This was the ax-see-on (ph) of Passover. Later on, we\nfound out, and dreaded holidays, we knew they were always were around holidays. Was easy for\nthem to drag all the Jews. Finally we got a little apartment assigned to us in that other part of the\nghetto. One, your windows of that went to the air outside, but the inside of it was the ghetto. Very\nsmall and my husband and I got an extremely small, it was a little porch and my parents got another\none in that building. Things were getting worse everyday. I recall getting up in the morning and\nlooking at the panorama of the ghetto, what it was like. People were laying, some dead of typhoid\nfever or starvation. An older Jew with a little carriage and a horse, which we later named the\nMessiah horse, would take these bodies on, put these dead bodies on that little carriage and drive\nthem out of town for burial. We called the horse the Messiah horse because it was the horse of\nliberation. By then we felt that dying, what you call of natural death, was a blessing. Some of my\nuncles had this death. I recall these bodies in the littered ghetto, they were littering the ghetto. I\nrecall sometimes getting up the morning and seeing distorted faces hanging on the street lanterns.\nAnd these distorted faces sometimes I saw the face of a teacher, of a relative, of a stranger. This\nwas the work of the SS or the common soldiers who knew where and what. At night they would\nraid the ghetto, they would come in for a sport kind of thing, and would just find a few Jews and\nhang them on the street lanterns. This I couldn\u2019t understand. This jolted me. I could understand\nthey would take away people because they need people to work in the factories, on the farms. Why\ndid they hang these teachers of mine? By then I was pretty much fully aware of the tragedy, of the\nwhole tragedy of it. Then came a tremendous ax-see-on (ph). This was in September, 1942. There\nwere little ones in between. There was an announcement that all men have to report to the auto-\nbites-on (ph), that they have to take along some food and then they will be sent to the Ukraine for\nwork. By then we were sophisticated enough not to trust them. Only men, not women. We figured\nstill, if they want men only it must be for work, but on the other hand, everybody to register. There\nwere thousands of Jews in the ghetto. By the way, our ghetto became augmented because the Jews\nfrom the providence\u2019s like your friends Alice Shick-ee (ph), Kos-off (ph), Kou-tee (ph), Uram-\nsukkot (ph), all these places were bringing, the Jews were brought into my home town, in the ghetto,\nwere all herded into the ghetto so the overcrowding was unbelievable. That all of them, all men had\nto register, we knew this much, every man in the ghetto. Well, I remember that dilemma that\nevening before. Who should go? The man in my family was my father, my husband, my two\nbrothers-in-law, Frania\u2019s husband and Cyla\u2019s husband. Menek was too young to be, they unified in\nthat Menek wouldn\u2019t go. We decided our father shouldn\u2019t go because we were afraid that he\nwouldn\u2019t be taken to work. I recall this very sad day, he came in and I couldn\u2019t recognize him. He\ntook off his beard, he sukkotved his beard to look younger and he looked horrible. He was beyond\nrecognition because my father, you see his photo, was a very handsome man and the beard was part\nof the handsomeness. And he looked about 100 years older but he decided he wanted to go. My\nhusband we thought would be safe because he was permitted while in the ghetto, he was permitted\nto work outside of the ghetto in his pharmacy. They didn\u2019t know it to operate it so he had a Red\nCross on part of his work clothes band, on part of his white band, he was permitted to go during the\nday so the Germans could have access to the pharmacy, but in the evening he had to come back to\nthe ghetto. Each evening, he was checked, he was trying to smuggle a little food for us, but each\nevening he was checked. One day he was beaten up terribly because he tried to bring a few grains\nof rye, he had put them into his collar of his coat and they found it and they beat him up mercilessly.\nBut basically he was our contact with the outside world to some extent because he worked there and\nwe decided to, he would be safe. There was no question, they\u2019re not going to take him because him\nthey needed. The man decided to go, I don\u2019t know what made for the decision, probably there was\nstill some sort of hope that they would go for work or something, and that, how could they hide?\nWe had a hiding place in that place. My husband really installed us there, before he went, he put\nmy mother, my sister Cyla who then had typhoid fever, her son, Menek, my other sister on the other\nside, me and Blancka Rosenberg. He put us into that cellar downstairs and he covered the opening\nof the floor with a little rug, put a table on top of it and was sitting then that day. [ll\nnever forget that day, it was a horrible day. The men were gone. We hoped they would return, we\nworried about our father mainly because he was older and we worried about him more than the\nothers. We thought they would return or go to work somewhere. Sitting there waiting, there were a\nfew other families there, and Blanca\u2019s child wasn\u2019t there anymore, I don\u2019t believe so, no. She was\nalone. And suddenly we hear some footsteps on top of that hiding place, with dogs. And boots,\nGerman boots. And the dogs stopped and started smelling and we knew this was the end. I still\ndon\u2019t know what happened that they walked away. Something distracted them, perhaps they didn\u2019t\ntrust the dogs enough. I do recall that moment when everybody stopped breathing. It must have\nbeen a second but it felt like eternity. And how the mouths of these babies were covered with\npillows and I was sure the babies would suffocate. They didn\u2019t, it was a moment. By then we knew\nthat our days are counted, that they meant us too, not only the men. We were sitting there for hours,\nI say it felt like eternity, and suddenly we felt smoke. The house was burning, they set the house to\nfire. We decided we have to go up. We walked out, our house was not on fire for some reason.\nThe neighboring houses were made of wood, our house was not as made. So, there was smoke all\nover. The Germans seemed to have been at the end of their day. There were dead bodies all over.\nWe could still hear some shooting. The Ukrainians were walking into the apartments, taking out\neverything they could. Polish guns, Ukrainian guns. We were alive, our men were not there. I\nremember the moment my sister, Frania with her baby, with her child, she had typhoid fever.\nSomehow or other, late evening, the men come back. Who came back? Unbelievably, my father\ncame back and my husband came back. The husbands of my sisters did not come back. We didn\u2019t\nknow what happened to them. We comforted each other. They were sending the Ukraine\u2019s to\nwork. The young men will be given food, they will be laborers. We didn\u2019t quite believe it, a part of\nus believed, another part didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t know where they were going. All the stories that\nsurvivors say they knew, we didn\u2019t know, nobody knew. We found out later through an escapee\nthat they went to Belzec, the extermination camp at Belzec which was not far from Re-vof (ph) and\nwhich eventually swallowed so many of the Jews from our town and from the neighboring towns.\nAnd I\u2019ve read a passage about it in the book by Hillberk and I found a long chapter about it many\nyears ago in the book of the American historian called Oln-ingst Pol-ece fie (ph). What was his\nname?",
        "Q: Browning.",
        "A: Christopher Browning. He has a whole chapter on that deportation day but I want to mix it in\nright now because I like to remember what I remember because this was all later. We had no idea.\nFor many of us after the war, we didn\u2019t know that they, where they were killed. We found out this\nmuch, much later. But there they were taken, that is where they were taken, they were taken to the\nextermination camp. This was the first time that we knew, we didn\u2019t know exactly, but some\nwitnesses came back. Some people escaped from the train and they were telling us. These were gas\nchambers, but he didn\u2019t know because he escaped. This came, this was later and I\u2019m trying very\ncareful to disassociate these two sources of information, what we knew then and what we knew\nlater. But this is what swallowed my two brothers-in-law. Menek\u2019s father and Alex\u2019s father, both\nyoung men, one was only 29, the other I believe was 32. I always thought, how did they shove\nthese young men into gas chambers, but they did. We never saw them again. My sister Frania was\nthen, was very high, typhoid fever, and she kept the baby next to her body and he was not infected,\nnobody understands how this happened. We were all starved, we were hungry. After that ax-see-on\n(ph) the Germans arranged for us to have a soup kitchen. It\u2019s reviewed in the Reich. There were\nstill thousands of Jews left, they were still being brought in from the provincial towns. There\nseemed always to be more Jews. Later I found out that on that day 8,000 Jews were removed but\nthere were more. I think they wanted to appease us, they wanted to appease us by making sure we\nwill not hide, that there is still some life going on. And actually after every ax-see-on (ph) which,\nafter this extreme tension, this extreme pain, this extreme depression, a depression hung over the\nghetto for hours. After that you somehow recovered. You got up in the morning and looked out, it\nwas quiet, you went back to whatever you were trying to do, a little cooking, whatever. By then it\nwas potato peels. You went back to pray. You went back to whatever work. I worked in a factory\nwhere Blancka worked, in a tre-po-tosh (ph) factory, they were making uniforms for the German\nsoldiers. Going out of the ghetto was permitted with a special permission. Each evening we have to\ncome back. Jews were still permitted to go out to these work places, they always had to come back.\nAfter each raid, after each ax-see-on (ph) there were days that you couldn\u2019t talk to each other. You\nchecked out who was still alive but then there was some normalcy. Normalcy of life. Amazing, but\nit was there. People tried to go back. I think the soup kitchen, which they introduced so late\nthrough the yood-en-rod (ph) was a way of appeasing us, of making sure we would not be afraid to\nleave our homes, which would make their work easier, but these are hindsight. We didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened then. All we knew, the yood-en-rod (ph) asked my father, it was so important to\nmake sure that everybody would get the right kind of portions, that soup, so they asked my father to\nsupervise that soup kitchen, to stand to dish out that. He was too weak by then, he just didn\u2019t want\nthe job. His legs were swollen. He asked them whether they would permit his youngest daughter to\ndo it and they did and so it was my job. This I\u2019ll never forget again. Originally to, they gave us\nsome horse meat. They made hamburgers of horse meat, they put in some horse meat in the ghetto.\nThe women there were making this into hamburgers. It took me a long time to get use to eating it.\nBut soup, and I remember the long, long lines of Jews. Sometimes I would recognize relatives,\nsometimes recognize the teachers, sometimes I recognize the father of another student. They didn\u2019t\nlook like human beings, the way they shuffled their feet, the way they asked and the pleading tone,\nged-dak (ph), ged-dak (ph) means sick. The soup was, had a little vegetables but it was watered,\nthere was a little bit, a few beans, a few other vegetables and everybody wanted to ged-dak (ph). It\nwas my job to be fair about it and to make sure everybody would get their right amount of food.\nThis lasted perhaps two weeks. One day, it was close to this slaughter house in which was a Jewish\nslaughter house in which chicken were always killed. There was a scream and I figured what are\nthe Germans bring, chicken, they are killing the chicken? A few hours later they found they\nslaughtered in this slaughter house, they slaughtered our children. This was the end of the\nsupplication, this was the end of me, this was just the end of me. I ran home. Couldn\u2019t talk. I\ncouldn\u2019t tell anybody what I heard. The rumor came later and everybody heard it. This was the end\nof my soup kitchen standing, I think it was the end of the total soup kitchen. The soup kitchen, the\npeople stay with me, the people who looked like sukkotdows of their earlier selves. These people\nwho were begging, ged-dak (ph). I wish they wouldn\u2019t be forgotten. This was the ghetto. I would\nlike for a break, thank you.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "Q: Maria, when you came back from that horrendous experience, I mean, both the soup kitchen and\nthen listening to the children, the people being slaughtered. You said you came back and you\ndidn\u2019t, to the house, and you didn\u2019t tell anyone. How were you able to keep it inside and, or not\nshow anything, or?",
        "A: I remember, I threw myself on the bed. We had a very small place, one room. I threw myself on\nthe bed and I sobbed and sobbed for hours. And then I went, and then my husband came in and I\nthink we began to talk, and then the news was all over. The city knew by then, the ghetto, but\nimmediately I just couldn\u2019t put into words, I couldn\u2019t talk, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t realize the extent of it. I\nremember it was chronological I\u2019m not sure that I remember exactly when it happened, but\nsometime in 1942, all of these things were towards the end of 1942. A woman came to our\napartment, to this small apartment that my husband and I stayed, and I recall she fell on her knees\npleading with him to give her something. I cannot remember whether he did or didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what this was all about. I found out later that she pleaded with him to give her cyanide\nfor the child. She\u2019s alive, this woman is alive and I think the child is alive, somewhere in Australia.\nThis I heard many years later. I\u2019m trying to remember, she was from a in Kolomyja,\nMrs. Hermann, I remember. Apparently the news came that the children would be taken away. I\nthink the full tragedy fell upon me at that point. When I heard children, that they\u2019re planning to\nremove the children, then I knew that this was the end and there really 1s no way of escaping, there\u2019s\nno more talk about going to the Ukraine for work or anything. That night, it was after that\nbutchering, that night sort of brought the full awareness, the full confrontation with the truth as to\nwhat was happening. By then, I think Blancka who worked in that factory at was\nLydia, the Polish woman who was the manager of the factory, it was about that time that she came\nhome saying that Lydia is ready to give her papers to run away. I still didn\u2019t understand the\nbusiness of running away, I couldn\u2019t understand any of it. A day later she brought papers and she\nshowed me, she had a ken-card-da (ph), she had something which showed that she was, the name\nwas Bruen-flower Per-nash-ik (ph) and we encouraged her to go away although I wasn\u2019t sure\nbecause at one point earlier one of my colleagues was trying to get through the ghetto wall and she\nwas shot on the spot. So there was a great deal of conflict that we were encouraging about, we\nalready knew by then that things were going very, very bad. She had lost all her family by then, so\nwe thought, perhaps she should go. She asked me that I should join, I wasn\u2019t ready to do anything.\nMy husband started talking about it. He was nearly everyday on the other side and somehow or\nother he began working toward my escape without my knowledge of it because I didn\u2019t want to hear\nabout it. This was towards the end of 1942. By then, we began to talk about it, that you need some\nhiding places outside of the ghetto. The number of the people was narrowing down very much,\nthere were just a few thousand people left. At it\u2019s height, I think there were 30,000 Jews in the\nghetto. So we knew that things are narrowing very much, but there was some peace. They didn\u2019t\ndo anything for a while. Somehow or other we started talking about perhaps we could get some\nhiding places on the outside. We had a friend and a woman who was a customer in our store, not\nquite a customer, she was a Polish woman, a very fine lady who was poor. So, when she\nestablished a relation, my father who would give her some of the dishes whatever for, a little\nmoney, during the ghetto days she occasionally smuggled some food for us. Her name was Wein-a-\nrof-ska (ph), and her place was across from the house in which originally my sister Cyla and her\nhusband lived. Somehow or other, he was in touch with her. I found out these things much later.\nBut he was also in touch with another couple. Well, \u2019'm jumping a little bit ahead of time here, but\nactually came December of 1942 when we began to talk seriously about it. That I should be the ice\nbreaker in a way, I should be the first one in the family to get out, to jon Blancka, and then my\nsister and her child will come.",
        "Q: How would you describe peoples relationships with each other as things are getting so terrible?\nAnd you describe this soup kitchen almost like they\u2019re ghosts walking towards you?",
        "A: Families are different. I\u2019ve seen a lot of, it\u2019s painful to talk about it because I saw in families,\nhow people were grabbing the portion of food. These were families like my own where we always\nkept passing the food, I\u2019m not hungry. Particularly my parents, we were this kind of family, close\nfamily, always passing the food to the next one, we\u2019re not hungry. But in some families, they were\nfighting for the bite of food. The people looked liked ghost, they were, all of us were in this, in this\narea there was no food left. I remember when we started cooking the potato chips, potato peels.\nMy mother cooked it in water, she added a little salt to it. This was the lunch. Lydia Wen-a-rof-\nska (ph), this is the Polish woman who sometimes smuggled in, 1n some way she smuggled in a\nlittle flour, so the flour had to be stretched. It was mixed with, sometimes you had only potatoes.\nBut the starvation was everywhere, definitely. I recall, somewhere or other I was younger and I\nthink this helped because my parents legs were very swollen, particularly my father, he couldn\u2019t get\ninto his shoes, he wore slippers my then. I took a look at them at one point and I knew they\ncould\u2019nt\u2019t stretch it because of the starvation. But more than that, I was just worried that they will\nbe shot. Sometimes I saw these weak people in the house, they didn\u2019t even bother to take them out,\nthey shot them right there. So it was at that time, but you want me to come back to Lydia, right? To\nLydia, I guess?",
        "Q: I want to ask you, was your father still praying, was he still religious in a certain way?",
        "A: Yes, he was still praying. Many of the orthodox Jews were still praying. I hope he prayed when\nhe was going to death, I hope so, because praying you know, somehow or other gets into another\norbit. I read about it later, that many of the Has-sid-ims (ph) they went into the fire while praying so\nthey didn\u2019t feel what was going on. I suppose that some of these behaviors anesthetized them, I am\nnot sure it happened to my father but, I wish it would. They were, I\u2019Il tell you in a minute how they\nwere killed, and that horrible death, but anyway, working 1n that part, in the ta-kosh (ph) factory we\ncame home every day but then there were days that we were not permitted to leave the ghetto\nanymore. And when Blancka left, she somehow or other, she put something into the mind of my\nhusband in particular, that there is a way out. But whether he\u2019d thought about it earlier I\u2019m not sure,\nhe didn\u2019t sukkotre it with me. By the way, he looked extremely non-Jewish while I looked Jewish.\nI didn\u2019t know I looked Jewish until I got to the other side, but he did and his Polish was perfect too,\nso he had some ideas at that point, I think. He started talking about me and I didn\u2019t want to hear\nabout it. Finally, the arrangement was that I would be the first one to go to meet Blancka, then my\nsister and her baby would come, and then he would arrange for my oldest sister and her son and my\nparents, he will arrange a hiding place outside of town, through the help of this Lydia Wen-a-rof-ska\n(ph), and then he will come. And he got himself papers too. I can\u2019t remember the name, but he said\nhe had papers. He had, he brought in papers one day, sometime in December, he brought in papers\nwith the name of Julianna Gol-ska (ph), he showed me, that\u2019s me. He told me he obtained it\nthrough the help of some non-Jewish family and this was authentic. Actually a girl who looked like\nme, who had died, and he purchased the papers, who he got them through I still don\u2019t know. There\nwas so little talk about it. Perhaps he talked more and the fright on my part really obstructed my\nthinking about it, or my memory about it. I recall, the only way, I still don\u2019t know how I decided to\ngo. The only way, because he worked so skillfully on me, that he\u2019ll join me in two weeks, he\u2019ll\ncome and meanwhile he had arranged all these things, and it seemed, he told me the idea thing, that\nI will be the path breaker, that I\u2019Il be the one to lead the way and they will all survive this way.\nWhether I really believed it, I wanted to believe it, I still don\u2019t know. It was a very hard decision\nbut there was no time for decision. Somehow or other they told me tomorrow, these people will\npick you up in the morning at 6:00 in the morning. It was Christmas, 1942, the people I personally\ndidn\u2019t know but my family did. They were landowners, Polish landowners, sort of an aristocracy,\nwho had business with my father. My father use to give them these fine porcelain things and they\nremembered him and they wanted to do something for the family. How we got hold of them, I still\ndon\u2019t know. Perhaps my father talked to him, some of these things I wish I knew but I do not. It\nwas Christmas morning, he brought in the night before a krosh-ock (ph), a krosh-ock (ph) is a\nUkrainian fur coat, which is a peasant coat, which is skin on the outside and lambs wool inside.\nVery, you have it on the photos you see of Kolomyyja, peasant girls always wore these things, it was\nwarm. I remember he buttoned me up. I remember he put into this sleeve, he put into five dollars\ninto the sleeve of this krosh-ock (ph) we called it, the coat. I said good-bye to my family the night\nbefore, at 6:00 in the morning, Christmas morning, 1942, these people were waiting outside in a pair\nof sleighs with horses. I wish I could remember details, all I know is I went through the wall, which\nwas not very far, the wall of the ghetto. I saw a policeman walking back and forth, he didn\u2019t see\nme. I recall removing the white arm band and all I know, I was in their carriage and they passed on\nthe Aryan side and the windows of my parents room was through the Aryan side and I saw\nsilhouettes of my parents in the window behind curtains. And I had the strange sense that I\u2019Il never\nsee them again. Despite the promises my husband made. And I remember how I tried totally to\ndeny that feeling, to stop that feeling, to stop thinking about it and to concentrate on the ride, and I\nwas sure that somebody will identify me, after all, people knew me in the town, I supposed so. But\nI was with these Polish people twice my age, they brought me to the railway station. The man went\nout, he bought me a ticket to Re-volf (ph), I got on the train and I remember very little about the\ntrain ride except that I arrived in Re-volf (ph) in the home of their niece or cousin, it was a\nChristmas party. Exactly what I needed at that point, but I came there, I was introduced as their\nfriend from Kolomyja and it was a lot of festivity going on, there was food on the table. I tried to\njoin and then in the evening I left. I was suppose to come back to their home. And suddenly I saw a\nmiddle-aged man following me. I remember he was dressed in a very warm way, there was a sort\nof kerchief on his head, and he said, Madame, he said in Polish to me, Mrs. Nei-dat (ph), you are the\nwife of the night of Kolomyja you look very cute, something of this sort, and I started\nrunning, and he ran after me. It was a cold night of Christmas in Re-volf (ph) and I think my young,\nand I could hear his breath against me, and this must have been a scene of running, nobody else was\nin the streets, there was quite a bit of sleet, it was cold, Christmas night. But I was young and I was\na good runner and somehow or other, I still don\u2019t believe how this happened, he couldn\u2019t follow my\nsteps. And he stopped somewhere, I ran into a courtyard, then another courtyard, and I saw him\nagain, and I could hear his breath and then everything stopped. I never went back to these people.\nBut I had an address of, Blancka gave me some address on High-lit-ska (ph) Street and I went there\nand I made up a whole story and she wasn\u2019t there, I hoped to meet her, and without her and being all\nalone, it was the first experience, all I wanted the next day was to go home, to go back to the ghetto.\nAnd I got in touch with that friend who helped her, Ad-ja (ph) was his name, a German Jew\noriginally who had come from Kolomyja and he was very well entrenched as a Pole, he looked like\nPolish nobility, and I let him know I was here, he came to see me. We locked the door, and I told\nhim, I don\u2019t want to hear about anything, all he can do for me was to go to the station and buy me a\nticket, I was afraid to run around the station, and all I want is to go back to Kolomyja. The man\nsaved my life in strange ways by talking to six hours, he literally out-talked me. By then, I was\ntotally, totally passive and totally listless. I pleaded, all I want is to die with my people in the ghetto\nand no argument really made sense to me, I wanted to get to Kolomyja and I wanted to die with my\npeople, and he kept saying that Pll never get to my people, you will not be able to get into the\nghetto, they will shoot me at the station, and nothing penetrated. Perhaps it did and I didn\u2019t want to\nhear it. I remember that after six hours, I couldn\u2019t hear anymore. And he didn\u2019t go to the railway\nstation and I passed another day and he made up a whole story, he was my fiancee, he was\nsomebody that was interested in me, and he will visit again. And then later was very interested in\nhim, he looked like Polish nobility, I was figuring there was some money too, I stayed another day\nand another day. And I had a story, the story was that I came to study , | take a\ncourse. So, the classes are not held every day and it\u2019s pretty flexible. Anyway, with\nthe Czech she looked away, she didn\u2019t know, I still don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know these things, but\nshe kept me. A few days later Blancka arrives. Things fell through for her in Warsaw, she had only\nbeen to Warsaw, they caught into Warsaw, and there things broke. So she came\nback here and we started a life together in that apartment, in that furnished room, and he would visit\nus and was, she always was a charismatic student and so on. And one day, and this is after\nChristmas naturally, I had news from the ghetto, from Maria Roman-o-rof-ski (ph), through that\nwoman who pushed food into the ghetto, and that everything was still the same, no change, they\nwere still alive. And one day, Blanca\u2019s looking for work, everybody said I shouldn\u2019t walk in the\nstreets so easily, but then people were conscious I looked Jewish, I didn\u2019t know, but Blancka looked\nPolish, so she went for a newspaper very early in the morning to see what the , what or\nwhere were jobs, to look for a job. And she hears somebody, calls her Blancka, and she got very\nfrightened naturally because by then her name was Broom-ka Ba-nat-chek (ph). She took a look in\nthe doorway, sits my sister with the baby and her sister-in-law and they look like chimney sweeps,\nall covered with ashes from the ghetto, from running away from the fires in the ghetto. She brought\nthem upstairs to her room and the story came out. The story came out that on the 2nd of February,\nwhich I always remember for other reasons too, this was the time that Stalingrad was taken over by\nthe Soviets, this was the first German defeat and was a change in the war, I didn\u2019t know then what,\nall I knew is that on the 2nd of February, the night of the 2nd of February, my parents and my older\nsister and Menek were sitting in another part of the ghetto by then, in their room, all dressed. For\ndays they expected, they expected the SS or the Germans to come and take them. There was no\nway out by then, it was a very cold night. And Menek told me years later that somebody came in\nfrom the neighbor\u2019s to tell about Stalingrad and that my father\u2019s spirit was lifted, and I\u2019m so grateful\nfor that moment, that his spirit was lifted. But it was 2 o\u2019clock in the morning or so, they came, and\nthey took all out of them, they took them out. I found out later that they women were separated, my\nmother and my sister, her daughter and her distant cousin, a young girl, , Lou-\nchie (ph) was her name, they were separated and the men, my father and his grandson, Menek, were\ntaken separate. And hungry they were, they were ill, they were not dressed well, it was terribly\ncold, sleet in the night, in the middle of the night, they dragged them through the streets of\nKolomyyja, they dragged them to Chap-a-rot-ska (ph) to be killed there. Frania, who lived in another\npart of the ghetto, but then her husband had been taken away, she was with the child and she was\nwith her sister and her husband\u2019s sister-in-law, this woman left her baby in the ghetto, she ran\nwithout the baby. She and my sister and Alex Schlessing, Alex\u2019s name was Elee-ow (ph) then, they\nran through the fire. The ghetto was set on fire, they ran through the fire and half burned all, all\ncovered with ashes, they found themselves at a neighboring railway station, they bought tickets and\ncame to Re-volf (ph). And they didn\u2019t know where to go, they didn\u2019t have an address or anything,\nso they saw one light, lit up, so they went into that building to find out about a hotel and the building\nwas the criminal polizer, the police, the German police, nothing but. Somebody prayed for them.\nThey said, there are no hotels, they walked out. And they sat in a doorway and that is where\nBlancka met them and she found them. My sister told us of the terrible details, that the parents were\nseparated, and what happened to her and that they could hear the shots. And she thinks, she thought\nperhaps Menek escaped, she wasn\u2019t sure. Nobody knew. All I remember, this was late afternoon,\nlistening to the story, all I recall was that all I hoped for was that the floor would open up and I will\ndisappear. I didn\u2019t want to live. She didn\u2019t know enough about my husband, he was separated from\nmy father and Menek. She thought she heard something, that he was taken to prison, that they were\nbeating him, she wasn\u2019t sure, nobody knew. I still don\u2019t know. Apparently, they either killed him\nin prison or took him to Chap-a-rof-sa (ph). That was the night, the last night after that, no Jew was\nleft in Kolomyja. My nephew, Menek, wrote up about that night. I recall that I couldn\u2019t stand just\nbeing alive. I stretched on that floor, Frania too, and I wanted nothing but for the floor to open and\nthe floor didn\u2019t open, that hard floor was there. I couldn\u2019t even cry. I couldn\u2019t take it in in any way.\nExcept Blancka woke me from that stupor I think sometime later saying that the landlady wants to\nbring us some tea. And this meant we had to get up, wash up, and look pretty. And I recall looking\nat the mirror and putting on lipstick and not believing it\u2019s me. She brought in tea. We had to make\narrangements for my sister\u2019s place, they slept over that night, we made up a cock-eyed story and\nlater we tried to find a place for them. They found other people from my home town, other women,\nthe men were all killed by then. And the story of many came out much later. What happened to\nhim is a really fantastic story. He was together with my father, being marched from that horrible\nnight, and there was shooting and the dogs were barking and the dogs were biting some people.\nAnd he was blaming my father in a way, saying, I told you we should have run away earlier, we\nshould have gone to the place, whatever, and my father said to him, something from the Talmud, he\nsaid, the Talmud says if the sword is around your neck, a miracle may happen. He was then 15 or\n16 years old, he interpreted this as a sign from his grandfather he should run away, so he ran away.\nFor years he was trying to get hold of that quotation, found out about it rather recently, but he ran\naway and the people were being marched, they were marched to Sukkotp-a-rot-ska (ph). By then it\nwas early morning and the neighbors could look out and some saw the Jews. And he was wounded\nin his leg, a shot came to, a bullet got into his leg. He fell on snow and ice. A Ukrainian policeman\nstepped over him and said to the Germans very stoically, he\u2019s dead. And as that colonnade of\npeople marched and marched for hours, he was lying there, then he felt himself alive, just bleeding,\nso he crouched, he approached a house he knew in the ghetto where he had worked somewhere and\nhe saw a baby in the fireplace. This is a story he told me about five years ago, he couldn\u2019t talk\nabout it. And he didn\u2019t know whether the parents who ran, left the baby, hid the baby there because\napparently there was no fire before, or whether the Ukrainians or Germans put the baby into the\nfireplace and set the fireplace afire. This he kept secret. Somehow or other, he jumped from that\nplace because he heard the SS marching, and the Ukrainians, he jumped in the attic to another place.\nHe was jumping most of the time, he heard the shots and through in that snow he\ngot outside of the ghetto to the house of the Polish woman, Bron-ra-off-ska (ph), who use to live\nacross the street from their home and who use to take care of the plants of the flower plants of my\nsister-in-law when my sister went on vacation. This Polish woman was poor and she supported\nherself by renting rooms to Ukrainian gymnasium students. So she had a husband and she had two\nstudents who lived there because they went to the gymnasium and they paid her something, that\u2019s\nhow she lived. Very early morning, he appeared at the door of this woman. I\u2019m sure he looked\nmore animal than human, and he heard the shots going on the Chap-a-rot-ska (ph), he knew this was\nhis mother, he knew this was his grandparents, and he pleaded with the woman to let him in for the\nnight, he was bleeding. And she said she can\u2019t, she\u2019s afraid because the Ukrainian students were\nthere. Somehow or other, I think, out of pity for this child-animal, she let him in for one night. She\nput him in the barn. Next morning she came to take him out and she was one who my father helped\noccasionally with some of the dishes to give her for a little money, I don\u2019t know what moved her,\nshe didn\u2019t have the heart to take him out. She left him, she covered him with straw and under straw\nhe lived there for about six or seven months. She kept him there. She lived with great danger, her\nhusband she apparently let on many months later. The Ukrainian students never knew about it.\nEvery night she would smuggle a little food downstairs. He was immobilized, he didn\u2019t move, it\nwas then. One day, he remembers, it was Spring by then. Well, that night, he says, all\nhe kept thinking, which of these bullets killed his mother and his grandfather and his grandmother\nbecause that\u2019s all he could hear, all night and all day the shooting was going on. This was the last of\nthe Kolomyja Jews and he remembers that all he was, felt guilty that he wasn\u2019t there. But he was\ncovered in snow, by straw. And one day, toward the Spring in March, he saw the snow coming\ndown the windows so it was a little light. Until then, he didn\u2019t see any daylight because snow and\nice covered the windows. And he looked around and he saw some books. These Ukrainian students\napparently when graduating they threw the books into the basement. One of the books he took was\na chemistry book. He started reading. That is why he\u2019s one of the foremost bio-chemist. He\u2019s the\none who is the developer of the , , Menek Goldstein. This was the\nbeginning of it, the chemistry book. He lived hungry there because very little food she could afford\nto give him, she was afraid, every night would bring down a little bit, he was a growing boy. And\nhe lived in extreme terror of discovery, always afraid of the Ukrainians. And one day, the woman\ncomes in, she says, there is a denouncement, somebody denounced that she\u2019s harboring a Jew, he\nhas to disappear. That night, it was Spring of 1944, that he had to leave the basement, the shed.\nAnd he remembered that Selik (ph), my husband\u2019s brother, had told him some time ago that he and\nsome others would have a hiding place. In the middle of the night he ran to that hiding place, they\ndidn\u2019t want to let him in. They didn\u2019t want another person, they were afraid. But my brother-in-law\ninsisted, he had a gun with him because he was a policeman, so they let him in. So he was liberated\nthere by the Soviets. When the Soviets came he couldn\u2019t walk so they carried him. The Soviet\nsoldiers carried him on their arms to the , to the municipality to show what\nhappened. Later on, is a long story. But, there\u2019s the story of Menek. Later on still begins a long\nstory, but that\u2019s one of, this is how Menek survived and how he depicted it in his statement about\nthe last night in Kolomyja. And us he told little details each time, each time we commemorate in a\nquiet way. My sister, Menek and I, we commemorate February 2nd. We don\u2019t have any\ncelebration, we don\u2019t do anything much, but we don\u2019t go to cinemas and we don\u2019t do any\nentertainment, we have dinner together and we sit down and over the years always some detail\ncomes out. Some of these details just came out within a few years. He couldn\u2019t talk about that\nbaby, he couldn\u2019t talk about some of the things. But that book of chemistry had such an influence.\nIt\u2019s a long story about Menek, another time perhaps. So I worked because I wanted to make sure\nthat the story of the last day in the ghetto, my parents horrible deaths, how they dragged them 1n that\nterrible, on ice, how they were falling around and I hoped they never reached that ;\nthat they died on the road, but I'll never know. They were separated, men and women. Can you\nimagine what happened to my father all alone. Menek ran away, he didn\u2019t know Menek would\nsurvive to tell this story but he did. So, this was the end of the ghetto. I knew these details from my\nsister in that house, that evening, and I said, we have to get up because this lady decided to give us\ntea, we have to make up and look human. Then we found a place for her and then started all kinds\nof troubles because somebody told her that she is harboring Jews and had to run away from the\nplace. Anyway, it was, one day I walked with my sister and her child, and she was in grave danger\nbecause the boy was circumcised and with two of her friends, women friends from the ghetto, and\ntheir children. And we were looking for the place for them to live because they were denounced by\nthen. My sister had some diamonds sewn into the buttons of her sweater, she never removed the\nsweater. Each time things happened, she sold the diamonds somehow or other. Kept all of us,\nBlancka and me alive too. At one point, I needed new documents and the diamonds bought it. We\nneed an apartment and the diamonds bought it. We were looking for something and I notice a girl\nwho looks at me very much, it was a former student from my home, a Ukrainian girl. And before I\nknow, I notice that she is bringing over a Ukrainian policeman. It was very dangerous and I\nmotioned to Branch and to the other women, it\u2019s not good, we have to do something, we have to\ndisappear, but how do we disappear? He\u2019s looking at us. So we decided to disappear in the next\nstore, which was a millenary store, selling hats. This is 6 o\u2019clock in the evening and we try on every\nhat in the store hoping that this man will disappear. Well, sitting there and trying on hats is exactly\nwhat we need at that point, he did not disappear. The store closed, we had to move. He did\napproach us, in very quiet words, voice, not to make any noise, he said, come with me, I know your\nJewisses. He started marching us out, what helped us most was it was dark. The darkness helped\nall of us at that point. And he took us somewhere in an isolated area, he had a revolver with him\nand he said, I\u2019m going to shoot you. So we started pleading. I started pleading with him that he\nshouldn\u2019t shoot my sister, if he has to shoot someone, me, because she had a baby, she had a child.\nAnyway, he decided not to shoot but to take everything we had. Rings, jewelry, whatever we had,\nthere were five women of us. He got everything. He even took my coat. We couldn\u2019t go back to\nthat place were we lived anymore, we had to find new places. This was continuous when they\ncaught us, we had to. Finally we got a place, things quieted down a little bit. It was a better time.\nBlancka and I got jobs in a German hospital. This was a hospital for the treatment of returned\nsoldiers from the front. They had frost bite, they were sick, they had wounds, so Blancka became\ntheir scrub woman and I was assigned to the apothotacary (ph) which was very good for me because\nI knew something and I was handy about things, but I never disclosed that I knew German or\nanything so I was dumb. It was quite a period in our lives except we sukkotred a room somewhere,\na furnished room, and I developed a terrible pain in my feet. I couldn\u2019t walk, I couldn\u2019t walk to the\ntoilet. And the question was, what do I do, how does one go to a doctor? Finally things are so bad\nthat they decided I have to go to a doctor. It was Polish doctor and he said, I have flat feet. Which I\ngot because I was so swollen, I ate only potatoes, breads, whatever it was. And I swell up to such\nan extent, I weigh so much more . Anyway, he put me into some shoes which I wore\nthrough the rest of the war. It helped immensely. And things were pretty smooth at one point.\nFrania was also set up somewhere and one day, 1n that apothecary, the Ukrainian girl walks in. She\nmust have followed me or whatever. And she knew Stodge (ph), the chief of the Upper Taker (ph)\nGerman men in uniforms in the military hospital. And she says, I know from that she\u2019s\nJewish. And he paled, I could see the blood was running down his face and immediately he reaches\nout for the telephone, I assume to call the military police, and I jumped through the window, it was a\nground floor. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know how I did it, I did it! How did I walk out of the ghetto, I\njumped through, how did I did it, I don\u2019t know? And I run into Blanca\u2019s other, to her and I say, let\u2019s\nescape, and we run away, told our story, couldn\u2019t get back anymore because we knew that we\nwould be denounced. We found out hours later, we find posters with our names and also 1n it they\nsaid Jewish Women and they masquerade for, they\u2019re trying to fool the German government, and so\nmuch money is offered for our capture and so on. We sat in doorways, Ed-au (ph), somehow it\ninvolved Ed-au (ph), he was with us, he helped. He got us tickets at night we went to the railway\nstation, we got tickets to go to Warsaw. I never knew anything in Warsaw, I knew nobody.\nBlancka had been at Warsaw, she knew the city. On the train people were talking about soap being\nmade of Jews, we don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about, we had no idea about these things. I\nhad a strange, weird feeling but I never understood what they talk was about. Jewish muscles are\nbeing turned into soap. Some primitive, very under-educated women sitting in the train with us.\nWe, our arrival, who I thought was a night train, the night train was the best things because it was\ndark, we arrive in Warsaw, and to just try to get through the railway station to a tram, and suddenly\nI feel two hands on my shoulders and I see two hands on Blanca\u2019s shoulders. These are Polish\nSecret Agents, they introduce themselves, they\u2019re secret agents and in a very polite way, apol-solum\npan-ya (ph) which means, would you kindly follow me. We followed them right across the railway\nstation, we see criminal polic-eye (ph), the police! There were all kinds of polic-eye (ph), there was\ncriminal police, there was shoo-pol (ph), there was Gestapo. This is Good Friday, 1943. We come\nto that station, there\u2019s a lot of people there. And they bring in men and we see the flames over the\nghetto and to hear the ghetto is fighting. The ghettos being burned, we don\u2019t hear about the fights,\nbeing burned and the Jews, they are escaping. And we see men being brought in and separated from\nus immediately, brought to another room, we don\u2019t see them ever coming back. Apparently\nbecause they are mounted to trucks or cars and ships and somebody immediately. And they try to\nexamine us. They say we are Jewish people. Blancka has a document, I have a document. Where\nare you going? Where are you from? All kinds of lies, so they don\u2019t believe us, and I say, let\ncall youll find out about us. But there were no telephone arranged to\nmake these calls, or they couldn\u2019t get us, whatever it was. A police comes in. Blancka suddenly\ndisappears. I have no, where she goes. I am alone. A priest comes in and he starts examining me,\nin the catechism, it so happened that I studied it during those months. And he says, I pass. One\nquestion he asked, which I didn\u2019t know, I later asked many Poles about it, even after the war, very\nfew of them knew. I forgot the name of it, , 1f you give birth to a baby, viv-ia\n(ph) it\u2019s called, the priest, you're not quite clean. The priest has to come out of the church and with\nhis belt he has to bring you in. So, very few Poles know it, very few good Catholics know it.\nAnyway, he asked that question which I didn\u2019t know. The rest, I knew everything very well, and I\nstuck to my guns. My grandparents name is this and my parents name is that and I live on that\nstreet, and so on. I just told them believe me. Blancka disappeared and I don\u2019t see her anymore.\nThe documents we had to leave right there, 1f you had documents they\u2019re not on the desk anymore,\nmy documents are there. My ken-carp (ph), my passport, my money is there. Towards the evening,\nand I hear some noises and I see the flames of the ghetto, and they talk about it. Says the ghetto is\nbeing burned, flames over the ghetto. Towards the evening, one of the Polish policeman, his name\nis Stau-ck (ph), and he interrogated me a lot, he says, come with me. I\u2019m going to mail a letter. He\ntakes me to the railway station, he mails a letter, no, he takes me to the post office right across the\nrailway station and he disappears. And here am I alone, in the street, probably the most dangerous\nplace in the world for any person, right across the railway station. With the ghetto flames coming\nright our way, there was a sewer next to me. I see many Polish and Ukrainians, no, Polish and\nGermans, right there watching the sewers and the top of the sewer comes off and Jews from the\nghetto trying to escape and they\u2019re being shot on the spot or taken away. And my instinct is to run\naway but I don\u2019t have a document, I don\u2019t know the city, I don\u2019t have a penny and whether I felt I\nwas at the end of the rope, I do not know. I am totally immobilized. I wait for this man. I didn\u2019t\ncare, I knew escaping I would be caught immediately, I would be shot right because the people from\nthe sewers were bring shot right there. And I stand there in that place, which is so unbelievable for\nme, that I\u2019m standing there and waiting for my death. And he comes out, the policeman, Stau-ck\n(ph), and he says, come with me. He takes me back to the police station and he says, you prove to\nme you're not Jewish, you would have run away. He returns to me the documents and the money,\nwhat little money I had, and he says to me, come with me. He puts me in the car, he goes with me,\nhe says, you have no place to stay I will get you a place to stay overnight. I figure he probably is\nputting me at a place where I\u2019Il be denounced or whatever. He brings me there, it is right at the\nborder of the ghetto. He opens the door, the landlady opens the door and she opens another door, it\nwas French doors I remember, and there sits Blancka. He re-united us until today\u2019s day, we don\u2019t\nknow who this man is. He came back next day, he told Blancka that I look Jewish, no, he didn\u2019t say\nJewish, he says, it\u2019s better if you try to get out, let her stay home and it will stop something, the\nmessage was that I looked Jewish. We later wondered, we still don\u2019t know, that perhaps he was\nwith the Polish underground, I wish I knew. Certain things I so wish I knew. I stayed there. The\nscreams from the ghetto were coming out, all night. The trucks were being loaded with people and\nthere was shooting going right there and the flames were very close. I don\u2019t know why he brought\nus there, perhaps he felt this was safe place, perhaps these were safe homes that they had for the\nunderground, I say, this all comes from later reading. I don\u2019t know what happened. He came back\na few times, he told Blancka to go to the are-bites-aumph (ph) and look for a job and indeed, one\nday, she found a job through the are-bites-aumph (ph) and she became a maid, a cook in a German\nhousehold. The people\u2019s name was Kinsel (ph). The man was the chief representative of taxation\nfor all of the government. There were twenty people working for him, they all were CPA\u2019s or\naccountants. Blancka was cooking lunch for them and one day she tells me she needs help, she\ncannot do so much, so they say go and look for help, she says she has somebody she knows, she\nbrings me and they have this scene in the book, I think. I played the role beautifully of being a real\nmaid from the worst parts of the city where I cannot speak any German, my mother is a laundress\nfrom that, I\u2019m use to violence, I\u2019m use to, I look a little bit like a whore, they said, when they\ninterviewed me. I didn\u2019t understand what in German, I had to, ask Blancka put it, the translation.\nAnd they look at me and they say, they\u2019re not sure I belong here, I look like a whore, I look like a\nthief. And with this background , SO Blancka says perhaps she\u2019ll try out for a few\ndays. Anyway, when I came back to the kitchen we started laughing in unbelievable ways. And\nsince then, I was there to clean the rooms and she was my supervisor, she had a better job, she was\nthe hausfrau, you know, she was the cook and she was the house maid, . The\ntrouble was when they wanted to send me to buy something, I was afraid to walk in the street. So, I\nwould walk in the streets like this, with my nose up, because my nose was a give-away. I had\nfantasies of getting plastic surgery on my nose but first I didn\u2019t have a penny to do it and then I was\nafraid of these doctors. So I didn\u2019t do it. But the nose was a give-away. Polish girls in Warsaw\nlook very different, broad cheeks, blonde, we may look different now but in those days, you could\nsee a Slavonic face. And besides, there were people just seeming to do nothing but looking at you\nto see whether they can catch a Jew. I remember a child once attacking me, saying I\u2019m Jewish and I\nopened my big mouth and I said, I\u2019m going to call the police, you know, I threatened him. This\nhappened to me a few times, whenever I was accused of something, I would open a big mouth, but I\nwas in danger all of the time. We lived with these people in a very good neighborhood because the\nGermans occupied the best part of town. We had a room to ourselves and they would travel very\noften to Germany, they had a baby. And for us these were the best days, when they went away\nbecause we could invite some people, we found people like Lod-joy (ph) and High-lin-ka (ph) and\nBoil-it (ph), we found the underground. I recall distinctly the day when I found out there was an\nunderground. This was one of the great days in my life. My depression, my sense of extreme\nterror, lifted. I knew if I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m going to die in some way knowing that Germans are\nbeing killed. There is a resistance movement. It was a fantastic experience. Until then, I didn\u2019t\nknow about any resistance. They were the first ones to introduce me to it. There\u2019s the Polish\nresistance and Jewish resistance fighters and they\u2019re actually attacking Germans. To be connected\nwith this was, lifted me up in ways that I didn\u2019t know until that was possible. I wasn\u2019t afraid\nbecause I was not afraid of dying. So many times that I wanted to die, I think that dying, it 1s the\nway to die, I was afraid of the way in which they\u2019ll kill me. If I\u2019m detected as a Jew, there are\nparticular kinds of brutalities against people who cheated the German government, these are the\nGerman SS. So they had horrible ways of killing you and this is what I wanted to avoid. But to be\ndead, it really did not matter. At no time did I believe I would survive, at no time did I believe this\nwas possible. We didn\u2019t see the end of the war yet.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a somewhat frivolous question perhaps. Did you rehearse being this maid before\nyou walked into the Kensel (ph) house? Who was this character?",
        "A: I rehearsed to some extent, I can\u2019t remember that I rehearsed. I was prepared in a way, that I'll\nwear a, what do you call it, a dish towel around my body. That I'll speak that Polish slang. I knew\nabout enough Polish, although I didn\u2019t think they will know the difference, really, but that I will be\nlooking down at them with some sort of suspicion. That I will take the job that fits me or I will not\nbe interested, the job may be too heavy, I'll see. That I come from Mok-ul-tof (ph), Mok-ul-tof (ph)\nwas a place, was a suburb which was working people with a lot of crime in it and prostitution and\nopen bars and so on. And that my mother is a washer woman there. And this gave them, Blancka\ntranslated it all, and then they sent me out and then they called in Blancka saying that they\u2019re not\nsure that they, that I belong, really. This is background, I look a little like a thief, that I may steal.\nAnd there was a guest of theirs there, no, she looks more like a prostitute. So Blancka says she\ndidn\u2019t know, but she\u2019ll hire me for a few days, see what happens. And then there were twenty\npeople working for this company, some of them were Jewish we found out later. They were the\nCPA\u2019s and the accountants. And work, being sent on errands was a death sentence to me because I\nknew I'll never come back, but they sent me to buy this and buy that. And these kids in the street,\nsaying Jud-ifka (ph), looking at me saying Jud-ifka (ph), the Jewiss. How these kids knew\nimmediately, it is in the blood stream. When people are trained for generations to identify enemy\npeople they know. Same, I am sure it was here, with whites and blacks for centuries. So every kid\nin the street identified me that easily. And whenever I came home safe, it was a miracle. Our\ngreatest enemies were the people who, nos-trouch (ph), trouch (ph) is like a door man, but actually\nlike a concierge, but lesser in status. They were saying we had to register and he was on the out\nlook for Jews because finding these Jews, there was money. So there were always some stories, that\nthe Jew was caught and there were always posters in the streets, they will offer $50, $100, whatever\nit is, if they would find the Jew. So there was a searching for Jews going on continually.",
        "Q: There was a word that was used for these posters?",
        "A: Sch-mol-siv-a-nik (ph). Sch-mol (ph) means fat. They assumed that people would live off the\nfat. And they\u2019re job, and there were too many of them, terribly many, might have happened in other\ncountries too but in Warsaw it was a gang of Sch-mol-siv-a-nik\u2019s (ph). Some of them might have\nbeen rich, some poor, some just hated Jews, some just wanted the money, whatever it was, they\u2019re\njob was to find a Jew and to extort money from him. Sometimes they delivered you later to the\npolice station but sometimes they let you go. Sometimes they took your documents in addition to\nthe money. But Sch-mol-siv-a-nik (ph) was a profession at that point. They stood in the streets of\nWarsaw and they observed you and they approached you. Once on a tram, I saw a man looking\nvery suspiciously at me. And I jumped and I broke my nose and I bled in the street and the tram\nwent further. And Blancka later came out on the stop and she found me lying in the street bleeding,\nwent to a pharmacy, I broke my nose. We couldn\u2019t go to a doctor, you were afraid. You were\nafraid of those Polish doctors too, and rightly so. I recovered, and then the same happened over and\nover again. Stel-ma Hov-en-jev-ens (ph), the book about the story about Stel-ma Hovich (ph), his\nbrother by the way just published a fantastic memoir on the Holocaust, not to be missed. I'll give\nyou later the full title of it, I spoke to him on the telephone. Stel-ma Hovich (ph) survived to\nbecome a big shot in Soviet occupied Poland as a chief bookkeeper for the government. He met my\nsister, he told her that I might be alive, he wasn\u2019t sure. That from that house people were taken to\nGermany, he wasn\u2019t sure. He later found his brother, the brother that has that fantastic story about\nhe and his brother ran away from Treblinka. He later joined his brother in Italy. A woman with\nwhom he was involved rejected him, that was how the story goes, he came to Italy. He was\ndepressed, he committed suicide. That was Stel-ma Hovich (ph), you ought to read the book, it\u2019s a\nfantastic memoir. But this was one later of how other people working in this place were Jewish,\nBlancka recognized someone from her home town. They were all afraid of me because I\nmasqueraded as a main of the worst background, worth Polish background, they were afraid of me.\nBut she told Stel-ma Hovich (ph) and a certain, years later, but anyway. So to move from it, one\nday, a man that I had seen in Germany, and Blancka made very good strudels, oh, there is\nsomething? To stop?",
        "Q: No, we have a few more minutes.",
        "A: That\u2019s all we have?",
        "Q: Five more minutes.",
        "A: For the rest of my story?",
        "Q: No. Just the tape.",
        "A: Oh, good, fine. This man like her strudel and he offered to take her to Heidelburg to be a maid\nfor his family. Blancka decided to go.",
        "Q: Let me go back to something and maybe we\u2019ll be able to stop the tape. I want to ask you about\nhow you met people in the resistance, how you met Voler (ph) and others?",
        "A: Sure. There was somebody in our house who was always under, always live under disguise. I\nforgot her name now, but she introduced us to Hele-inka (ph) and Bowl-ick (ph) and they loved our\nplace because it was a safe place in a German neighborhood, German people living in it, so\noccasionally they would come up. Particularly when the people for whom we worked were in\nGermany and the place was closed. On a Sunday, they would come up and they would teach us to\nsing partisan songs, from the Bont (ph), I couldn\u2019t believe it, the whole thing! I say this was the\nhappiest days in my life during the Holocaust because I felt, I didn\u2019t feel the fear, I didn\u2019t feel the\nfear at all, I just felt the sense of resistance. And I think if I\u2019m not mistaken, Blancka once brought\nsome documents for children because it was such a safe place, so we had all of the\ntime.",
        "Q: So this is Latka-mead (ph)?",
        "A: Latka-mead (ph), I think she brought some documents for children into our old room but I\u2019m not\nsure, at this point Bowl-ick (ph) and Hele-inka (ph) were very much a part of our lives and Henrich\n(ph), he died later. There was another man who wrote the beautiful memoir of , Bear\nWitness, Bernard (ph). He too was involved in some way. So it was like I knew life, an\nunbelievable kind of new life where we felt even if we died there was a resistance. The Germans\nare losing. So Sunday afternoon, occasionally, these people were away, they would come and we\nwould listen to the in British radio, which was certainly not permitted. And we would sing these\nsongs and one day, against our expectations, these people, the Germans, come back earlier from a\nweekend. They use to go to Berlin, come back earlier for a weekend and here is this group, we are\nsinging and they\u2019re listening to the British radio. Well, that fright was unbelievable, but they\nwalked in. We hid these people under our beds, we finally got them out, it wasn\u2019t so simple. We\nhad many such occasions where we smuggled people in and then we had to offer them under the\nbed to a hiding place, and then to smuggle out through the door, all of these things were extremely\nanxiety provoking. Scenarios, but they were a part of our life at that point. Until the man came\nsaying he was taking Blancka to Germany if she wants to go and she registered for a trip, the\nseparation was very difficult for us. I remember, we went to Bowl-ick\u2019s (ph) home for a sort of a\nparty, a get away party, and when I walked out of the party I was drunk and I kept saying in the\ntram, I\u2019m Jewish, that\u2019s all I needed to say. And they following day she left and I was left alone, it\nwas a terrible loss for me naturally, but she, we thought about the past, how to join her, everything\nwas very uncertain.",
        "Q: Maria, you talked about how difficult it was when Blancka was leaving for Hiedelburg. Tell me\nsomething about your relationship and what it meant to be able to be together in a situation like this?",
        "A: Extremely important to have another body. Not to be alone. Being alone, being isolated was\none of the great dangers. You just couldn\u2019t hardly survive without having someone with you. I\nremember days when I was very much isolated whenever things happened. Blancka had to run, I\nhad to run you know? It was, it felt, you really couldn\u2019t live through it. But when Blancka left, it\nwas a great loss to me. We maintained correspondence in some way, she was able to write from\nGermany, and there was always some hope that perhaps I'll find myself there, although I didn\u2019t\nbelieve it. She encouraged me to go but how could I go? For me the greatest danger was to go to\nthe official employment bureau to ask for a job because to go to Germany you had to apply for a job\nthere. There had to be proof for a job there. For me just to show myself, show my face in these\noffices was very dangerous. So we maintained our contact mainly through correspondence at that\npoint, but until then, we were extremely inter-dependent. Her looks were helpful, I had more sense\nof danger I think, of reality, I was quick this way for some reason. I think we complemented each\nother very well this way, but we were very close to each other and as I say, we were intimate in our\nrelationship and I knew of the losses she suffered. She knew very much of my family life. She\ntried to steal some oranges in the hospital to bring to Lash-ick (ph) so we were very intertwined,\nextremely so. And her absence left a tremendous void in my life, but more than that, a sense of\ndanger too, that I\u2019m all alone here. I had no idea the war was coming to an end. Coming back to it,\nI remember Bowl-ick (ph) and Helene Ko-vet-all-lich-al (ph) and Lod-ja (ph), we had intermittent\ncontact. From the time she had left until I joined her wasn\u2019t that long. I\u2019m trying to remember, I\ncan\u2019t remember exactly when she left but somehow within the next few months the Germans started\nrunning. We heard about it, that the Soviets are approaching. Even before that, Blancka and I\ncelebrated each victory on the part of the Soviets. At one point, we heard that Kolomyja was\nliberated and this came through the radio, the British radio, no, another city, I\u2019m sorry. On the\nBritish radio, on that radio we heard it later in Germany. So we celebrated each time, quietly. We\nhad such a double life, an official life and a life between each other. We were extremely close, I\nwould say, in a very intimate kind of relationship. We maintained it later for many decades too.\nBut when she left, it was pretty, I did have some correspondence, I heard a little of it, that she was\nworking in a household there. She didn\u2019t seem to be in danger of any kind, danger of detection. It\nwas very soon afterwards we heard rumors that the Soviets are approaching, they are taking over\nlarge parts of Poland, the eastern part. And one day, I remember, the German family for whom I\nworked just took off to their town in Germany and they didn\u2019t come back. And within a few days,\nthe office workers also left. And then I was all alone when I heard that the Soviets are approaching\nWarsaw, they\u2019re in Prague, in the suburb of Prague. Being all alone, the telephone stopped\nworking, I would have like to call Lodz, I would like to call Helena but I couldn\u2019t, but I was all\nalone, I figured, well, in a few hours or so the Soviets are going to be here, so walk out of the\napartment. This was a German section, the Germans were not there anymore. There were Poles,\nand I knew the Soviets are coming in. I didn\u2019t really think about my sister, Frania, she was involved\nwith the child, I didn\u2019t know about Menek, although we did have some intermittent communication.\nAt one point, pretty much everything stopped, we didn\u2019t know. But I knew that I\u2019m going to be free\nin a few hours. But the Soviets did not come in. And I was all alone in that big apartment, not\nunderstanding why they take so much time. The following morning, I began to hear some shooting.\nI later found out there was an uprising, the Poles started an uprising against the Soviets. This was\nbeyond my belief! Well, before I knew, the Germans were coming back and the Poles seemed to be\nfighting both the Germans and the Soviets. I walked out in the street to see what\u2019s happening, I was\nterribly isolated by then. I saw people running. All the Polish people from the neighborhoods were\nrunning. I joined them, I didn\u2019t know why people were running. And so we kept running, we\nmoved slowly into sewers. Suddenly I\u2019m in sewers. And then the Polish people began to talk about\nwhat happened. That there was an uprising, that the Soviets didn\u2019t come tn, that the Germans are\nback. And that the city is being burned down. Well, I didn\u2019t feel a minute anymore about being,\nthe part about being Jewish. This did not, somehow or other, I can\u2019t remember, that Helin-ka (ph)\nand BowIl-ick (ph) joined me. I think we ran together but this is what I\u2019d like know, to see Helin-ka\n(ph) to find out these details. I don\u2019t remember whether we, how many days we were in the sewers,\nbut it seemed like an eternity naturally. And from time to time, the sewer door would open and you\ncould see a street and you could hear some shooting and then it would close again and we were\nagain in the sewers. I don\u2019t remember how we were fed but somebody, there was some crumbs of\nfood going around.",
        "Q: Were you in the water?",
        "A: In the water, that high up. And these were not the sewers of the ghetto, these were the sewers of\nthe city of Warsaw, Polish people. Some were in uniforms, some were civilians, all age groups. I\ndidn\u2019t know how far we were going, what it was I thought a day, but it was more than a day\ndefinitely. It was a good many days, the idea was, I found out later, that we will be going up to the\nvestibular where we will get out and get a boat to go to the Soviets, to Prague. Finally we arrived at\nthe vestibular and Bowl-ick (ph) and Hel-inka (ph) and I, by the way, we wrapped around ourselves\na blanket so we wouldn\u2019t be separated because there were lots of people there, we were afraid we\nwould be torn apart. And to come out in that bright sunshine, this was September of 1944, August,\nend of August, beginning of September, 1944. And we tried to get into a boat, there were many\npeople coming out of the sewers, and we see the city is pretty much in flames, and we try to get on a\nboat. We cannot get in, it\u2019s filled, Bowl-ick (ph) got on the boat, Hel-inka (ph) and I still waited for\nanother boat to come. The Soviets are right across the vestibular, some people were trying to swim\nit. Suddenly from no where the Germans appeared, the vestibular is at the bottom of the city. The\nimportant part of the hill, the old city. Suddenly, there are Germans in the old city and\nfrom no where I feel a bullet in my back. They shot me through my coat, I was in a coat, and I\u2019m\nbleeding. And the same bullet goes into the arm of Hel-inka (ph). I fell to the ground, she didn\u2019t I\nthink. I was pretty unconscious, I was bleeding. And then they have us get up, I still don\u2019t\nunderstand how it was possible for me to be bleeding and get up, and we are being marched. We\nwere apparently, I found out later, the last group of the Polish uprisers. And they are dragging us\nthrough the city of Warsaw. We see the city in flames, and they are dragging me, I can hardly drag.\nAnd all of us have to put out a handkerchief or something to show to the Germans our surrender.\nWe had to show something white, flags we didn\u2019t have, so everybody raises a hand with a little shirt\nor something, we\u2019re surrendering. I couldn\u2019t walk, people helped me or what, I don\u2019t remember.\nAll I recall, at one point, I was extremely thirsty, probably from loss of blood, and I bent down to\npick up an apple. Poland is full of orchards, of apple orchards, 1t was the season for it. I tried to get\nan apple into my mouth and a German soldier hits me right in my back, march! He didn\u2019t know I\nwas Jewish, but then I was totally unafraid of being detected as a Jew. I was a Pole. They marched\nus to a place outside of town called Poroskov. In Poroskov they had a special detention camp for all\nthe Poles who fought in the uprising and other Poles too. Lodz eventually was in Poroskov too but I\ndidn\u2019t know at that time. I was so sick that I wish I knew these details because I didn\u2019t function\nmentally anymore. But I recall waking up, there are somehow or other bodies on top of me. It was\nso crowded there that they pushed people, we fell asleep and the bodies, somehow or other I\nsneaked out of it. Before I know it, I was on some transport being marched again to a place to be, to\na place to be, anti-loused, means cleaned of lice, a de-lousing station. And then they put us on a\ntrain and I\u2019m on a train with Hel-linka (ph) holding onto each other and with lots of other Poles.\nPolish families, not children, Polish men. On that train, and by then it is September I know, on the\ntrain were the only two women and the men are all in Polish uniforms, they were fighters. The train\nwas moving very slowly, I had no idea where we were moving, we fall asleep all of us. Sometime\nin the middle of the night, or 1t was very early morning, one of the fighters wakes up and he starts\ntalking to the other one, the Jews brought all the tragedy and the Jews will take over Poland because\nof the Soviets and they got us into all that trouble. And one of these guys looks at the other and\nsays, you know what, these two girls across from us, they look Jewish. You better tell. By then it\nwas about four in the morning or so and it was just light, it was just coming, and then they fell\nasleep. And without saying another word to Hel-linka (ph), we motioned to each other that we\u2019re\ngoing to jump from the train. I\u2019m sure that the motivation was not to escape from that, the\nmotivation I believe, but I\u2019m not sure, was to just die. Before these Germans come to take us. We\nunderstood by then that the train was being shipped out to Stutthof, which was a detention camp\nwhere Polish people were shipped in order to work for the Germans. And we knew the beginning\nof the day will bring the greatest horrors to us when the Germans arrived to take us out. So without\nsaying a word to each other, the window was open, the train was moving very slowly, I can\u2019t\nremember who jumped first. And I can\u2019t remember anything else except that I wake up in the home\nof a Polish woman in a town called Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph). I never heard of the town,\nit\u2019s south of Warsaw. These women had attended me, given me a clean bed, attended to my\nwounds, told me the story of what happened after I woke up. I don\u2019t know, it was a few days that I\nwas pretty unconscious. She said that when we jumped out a priest thought we were dead. He was\ngoing to the cemetery to bury some body, he saw these two girls from the Warsaw uprising, so he\nfigured he\u2019s going to bury us, with a decent Catholic burial. When he noted that we were breathing.\nSo first he buried these people who he meant to bury, then he brought us to this Polish woman on\nthe outskirts of Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph). Poor woman but a very decent soul. She was\nvery happy to be able to be of service to these Polish revolutionaries, the Poles who fought, the\nPolish fighters who fought for independence of Warsaw. So she treated us beautifully, I could see\nhow poor she was but she treated us extremely well, and one day a neighbor comes in and she opens\nthe door to our room and she wants to tell him, these are two girls who were in the Polish resistance\nmovement. He takes a look at us and he says, she look Jewish. That night, Hel-linka (ph) was sick\nof me because she looked Polish, she said good-bye to me and I haven\u2019t seen her until years after\nthe war. I saw her again about two years after the war. Hel-linka (ph) had blue eyes and she was\nblonde and she wanted out. I stayed on, I didn\u2019t know what to do. The Polish woman was\nabsolutely an angel, she said you have to go, you can\u2019t be here. She wrapped up for me half her\nbread in a kerchief and two apples and early morning I leave. I didn\u2019t know where I was going but,\nit didn\u2019t matter. At that time, nothing mattered anymore. I knew I wasn\u2019t afraid at all because I\nwasn\u2019t Jewish anymore, nobody would think of me as Jewish at that point. Poland was falling\napart. I kept walking, so I walked into town.",
        "Q: You just said that it didn\u2019t matter that you were Jewish because people were, but this man\nnoticed and this woman?",
        "A: That man noticed, but on the whole people were already running and life didn\u2019t matter to me. I\nwas all alone, I was wounded, I had a pain in my back. I had nothing. I didn\u2019t know where to go, I\ndon\u2019t think I had documents at that point because I was running in the sewers, I don\u2019t remember\nwhat happened. And I don\u2019t remember because I was on the high fever. So I walk into that town, I\nsee Thom-ma-sla-sov-en-sky (ph), I never heard of it before, there are two Thom-ma-slick\u2019s (ph),\none is\nthe other is the home of Rabbi Lowengers (ph) brother. They preeminently gave\ntestimony about their experiences as children in camps. So I walk in, I hardly walk, but I walk with\nthe apples and the bread. I see an apothecary for pharmacy. European pharmacies are very\ndifferent than ours, they\u2019re very formal. I had nothing to loose, I walk in, I say I am a, I ran away\nfrom the uprising, I fought in the uprising because this was my new identity. The man, and I know\na little bit about pharmacological work because my husband was a pharmacist, I use to help him, he\nis delighted to see me, he says. Well, first I wanted to rest up, I wanted to meet my family,\ntomorrow you come to work. You can do bottles, you can wash up, fine. He sends me upstairs to\nhis family, a nice home they made, his wife was charming to me, the maid makes a luxurious bed\nfor me, I felt so guilty to get into that bed with beautifully clean linen. I haven\u2019t seen that in a long\ntime, starched linen I remember. And they invite me for dinner and everything\u2019s fine. And I sleep\nthrough the night and in the morning the maid comes in saying, she\u2019s very sorry but her landlady\ntold her how sorry she was but I cannot stay here any longer. I think, ah-oh, they discovered where\nI was. So I say, what happened? She says, in the morning when you got up I made the bed, I\nnoticed there were lice in your bed. And my landlady says you should go because you were\nwounded. You should go to the clinic to clean out your wound. Well, I still remember laughing to\nmyself, lice! Anything is better than being discovered as a Jew! I dragged myself to that clinic and\nthey started working on me and the doctor without any anesthesia they cleaned my wound, it was\nextremely painful I remember. I screamed from pain. And they took out the lice, they cleaned me\nout totally. And I hear the nurse saying to the doctor, you know, she looks Jewish. Here I\u2019m in the\nhospital, in the emergency room. Nothing happened and nothing mattered at that point, I walked\nout, I knew I was bandaged. I didn\u2019t have lice. I figured should I go back there, it\u2019s really not the\nplace for me to go back, I\u2019m afraid. By then it was very late evening, I was extremely tired. I was\nstill so very sick. I ate those apples and the rest of the bread and I stretched out on a bench. It was a\ncold night, it was by then I think the end of September, beginning of October. It was raining,\ndrizzling, and I fell asleep and nothing matters. Sometime in the middle of the night, somebody\npushes me. I open my eyes. A German soldier, a German policeman. Come, he says to me. I\nwasn\u2019t afraid. He didn\u2019t know in the middle of the night that I was Jewish or anything, he was\ncollecting all these homeless people to ship them out to Germany. So he brings me again to a place\nfor cleaning, de-lousing, clean, I walk out clean. I think they gave me something fresh to wear, I\ndon\u2019t remember. And he brings me to an assembly hall where there are lots of Polish women. All\nthese women, collected from the street, are being shipped to Germany to work. By then the\nGermans were loosing the war, their men where coming home on crutches. Their women were sent\nto the front to work. They didn\u2019t have enough workers so they were collecting Polish people all\nover. I\u2019m among Poles, therefore nobody knows I\u2019m Jewish. But, we get on a train, and then the\nman who is a greeter tells us we are going to go to Germany to work but before we do we are going\nto stop in Pat-o-vich-a (ph), which is a border town which by then was Germany. And he takes us\nout and he says, I want you to sit in this corner, we were a few hundred people by then, to sit in this\ncorner and to wait for the evening. We are going to take an evening train and I\u2019Il come back in the\nevening. We know you\u2019ll sit and rest here, will being some food. I took a look at the group and I\ndidn\u2019t know whether I looked at them or they looked at me but it didn\u2019t look to me kosher that I\ncould survive with these Polish groups. So I said, if I have to be back and see if I could walk away\na little bit, so I walked away. And here I could see Germany falling apart. Many Polish people of\nGerman extraction, falk-stoich-er (ph), are coming into the station. They are running from the\nSoviets. And at the station there are many soup kitchens supervised by German nurses, like the\nGerman Red Cross. So I hear their story about how the Soviets are after them, how they ran away\nfrom rape and all kinds of things, so I figured, I\u2019m also falk-stoich-er (ph), why not? I speak\nGerman better than they. So I go over and I ask for soup and I tell them that I\u2019m running from the\nSoviets so they give me one cup of soup and another cup of soup and a third cup of soup. I\nremember milk so distinctly, finally I am full, ?ve eaten good food. And this is a Sunday afternoon\nI believe and I walk out of the station. Pat-o-vich-a (ph) is not touched, it 1s a German city, it\u2019s an\nindustrial city, it was the biggest textile city after Manchester, I knew about it. And I see the stores\nfull of fabrics, I couldn\u2019t believe what\u2019s going on here. I came from the ashes, literally from the\nashes of Poland. And I walk and I don\u2019t know where to walk, I figure I have to walk away from\nthat Polish group. Let\u2019s see if I can get to Heidleburg because I\u2019m wanted in Germany, and since\neverybody\u2019s running. I\u2019m not Jewish, everybody\u2019s running, the German, the falk-stoich-er (ph) are\nrunning, the Poles are running. The Poles couldn\u2019t run they are too but the\nGermans were running from their home. So I see a Hitler parade, and believe it or not, this is the\nfunniest thing in my life! I joined the Hitler parade and I go like this, Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!\n. First they had soldiers in brown shoes, but then people talked, it was Sunday\nafternoon, I think it was for Hitler\u2019s birthday, I\u2019m not sure, but it was a special occasion. So I\nwalked with them until the evening, then they disperse.",
        "Q: What\u2019s your state of mind when you joined this parade?",
        "A: Oh, I was so exhilarated. I was absolutely exhilarated. Imagine me to join a Hitler parade! I\u2019m\nin Germany! This still brings to me laughter whenever I think about that moment! How did I do it,\nbut what else could I do? I was in the safest place to be for me. In a Hitler parade! I\u2019m together\nwith all these Germans saluting the flag and all the things, and there are speeches and so on. Many\nhours pass and the evening comes and they begin to disperse, so I have no place to go. I figured\nthese Poles must have left, but I\u2019m not sure. So I circle around the station. I wasn\u2019t afraid because\npeople were on the march by then you see. They were refugees. This was the best feeling for me. I\ncome back, indeed, the people are gone. So I take a look, what am I going to do? Now I'll try to\nget on a train and find my way to Heidleburg, I knew Blancka was there. I had some idea of where,\nthe place where people from Bolm-sukkot (ph) worked. I got to, it\u2019s late evening by then, I get on a\ntrain and I suddenly notice the military train from Russia, the Germans, all military, I\u2019m the only\nwoman. I say, oh, that\u2019s very dangerous, so I hide in the restroom. In an hour or so, they need the\nrestroom and start yelling to get out, I get out, they look at me, and by sheer luck because I have to\nthink it was luck you know, the train stops. It was the city of Dresden. So I walk out at the station\nand the train goes away, it goes wherever they went. I walk, it was very quiet I remember. It was\nby then, was morning, early morning hours. I walk into town and I sit down in a cafe, I didn\u2019t have\nmoney but I figure I would sit down, rest stop. And so the new bombs came. This was the great\nbombing of Dresden, it was an earlier bombing. You see R-A-F, this was the British Air Force.\nThe best feeling in this world, that I\u2019m going to die of a bomb, what can be better? I remember\neven bombs in Warsaw. At one point, the British were bombing Warsaw and I stayed in a\nhousehold there, not with the Germans, it was in a Polish place, I had a furnished room, and people\nwere running to shelter. So these people called me, come! Come with us to the shelter! And I did\neverything possible not to go to the shelter, I wanted to be killed by a bomb. Couldn\u2019t be a better\ndeath. And I recall doing this, putting my feet up and my head into my legs, hoping that when a\nbomb kills me that it will kill all of me rather than just some legs or the head separates. This was\nmy dream, to be killed that way. I really didn\u2019t want to live, so when people say they tried to\nsurvive, they wanted to live, I really didn\u2019t want to live but I didn\u2019t want to die detected by the\nGermans. I was afraid of that death. But I\u2019ve seen before how people were killed and their leg was\nhung there and I was there and this to me was a horror, so I remember that night of bombing. I\ndidn\u2019t go to the shelter but I waited for the bomb, the bomb didn\u2019t come to me. So this is Desden,\nand I sit in a cafe and the second floor of that cafe 1s coming down and I\u2019m sitting there literally,\nseeing the bombs, and things happen, it\u2019s like an earth-sukkotke, you know? It sounds like an earth-\nsukkotke. And I see many people are dead in the street and here I walk out alive. I was meant to\nlive and that\u2019s all they can say, why I wasn\u2019t killed I don\u2019t know. So hours later, I walked down to\nthe railway station. I still have in mind if I\u2019m alive I want to go to Heidleburg, so I get a train. It\nwas some sort of a civilian train. Nobody looked at documents, nobody looked at tickets, 1t was so\nchaotic. It was mainly refugees from the falk-stoic-er (ph), from everywhere, and Germans too\nfrom the cities, there were bombs, they were moving west, that\u2019s how it was going. But mainly\nfrom the eastern part of Germany, which was originally Poland. Finally I see this train stops at\nFrankfurt and before I get out bombs come over Frankfurt, this was a little bit too much,\nunbelievable. But this was the time of the greatest bombing of Germany. So the railway station is\nall in fire again and many passengers walk out alive and many passengers are killed right there.\nAnd I\u2019m alive. It\u2019s fantastic! So I figured, now I have to go from Frankfurt to Heidleburg, certainly\nno trains anymore, the railway station is all in flames. I see people walking, I follow them, they are\nwalking to the highway to hitchhike. So I hitchhike too, I\u2019m a German you know! I\u2019m a falk-\nstoich-er (ph), poor, dear soul. I\u2019m better qualified to be falk-stoich-er (ph) than anybody else here\nbecause those who live for generations in Poland is falk-stoich-er (ph), that and German, they didn\u2019t\nspeak German they didn\u2019t know a thing. I\u2019m certainly much more , SO I go with them.\nAnd they start hitchhiking, so I get on a truck, I remember the truck goes only a little place, he\nleaves me there, I had to hitchhike again. Must have been six modes of transportation, finally a\ntrain goes somewhere between Mannheim and Heidleburg. I arrive at Heidleburg, I arrive intact in\nHeidleburg. I walk into the ladies room to wash up and I wash up and I look in the mirror and I see\na chimney behind me, a chimney sweep, and I figure how does a man come into this? I look\naround, he\u2019s gone. So, I wash my hands again, I look again and I see the chimney sweep is back!\nAnd I look back, it\u2019s not a chimney sweep. What happened? I did this with my hands and I noticed\nit was me, not a chimney sweep! I was so black, I was so totally black covered with soot. And it\nwas my face, it was not a chimney sweep. . I wash my face, I suddenly had a\nface and it was me. I still have that sense of terror in me when I think about it. I walk out, the city\nis normal and beautiful and it was the month of October. And in Poland, October as you recall here\nis lovely, the weather is lovely, it\u2019s not cold. I\u2019m without stockings and wooden shoes and the coat\nthrough which went the bullet. And I walk and I cannot believe my eyes. And I see some Germans,\nformer soldiers on crutches, a few women. And I just keep walking towards the necht-a-some-a-\nrisa (ph) because in walking toward the station\u2019s center, usually it goes down the center of the street,\nyou just walk. Here I see the neck-er (ph) and I figure how can I find out where Blancka is? I\nremember the name of her employer. So I stop a little girl and I say to her, do you know Mr. Alber\n(ph)? And she says, My papa! Like that. There are miracles in this world. My papa! She takes me\nby my hand and she brings me to Blancka. Blancka nearly fainted when she saw me the way I\nlooked. She took me to the basement to wash me up and put something around my wounds, I was\nnot in such good sukkotpe yet, and she figured I should wait a few days before I go to work. She\nhad meanwhile arranged for me to work for a couple, for a family, in the neighborhood. This was\nno one else but Professor A-had-es (ph), he was a dean of the medical school in Heidleburg. A high\nranking German official in a uniform, he was about 7\u2019 tall. He has a wife with four children, a\nstunning house, absolutely beautiful house. There were bedrooms and attics. They hired me on the\nspot, I started working. The work was impossible for me, I was not well yet you see? And they\ngave me an attic room. I had to get the children, clean everything, there were many floors there,\nbeautiful, their house. And in the morning I would have to get the children to school, each child\nleaving for school with the, Heil Hitler, Maria! This was the greeting, the morning greeting. The\nlady of the house was sort of neutral. She didn\u2019t trust me with cooking, there was nothing to cook.\nIt was toward the end of the war, the Germans had very little, but they had a garden. Everyday, I\nhad to go to the garden and dig out potatoes and leek. And everyday, we had an elegant lunch of\npotatoes and leeks. I would scrape it off, prepare it, but she would cook it because you put a little\nbit butter and a little flour and make it look like more of a meal. It was served in beautiful porcelain\nwith silverware, you would never think what you were eating, it was great food. Everyday the same\nuntil the end of the war. We had all, for getting rations of food. Everybody was assigned that many\ngrams of bread, so I had a little. He registered me as a falk-stoich-er (ph), which was great. So\nwhich means I was entitled to a little bit more bread. So, I would get whatever amount of bread,\njust a little bit less than they did. On Sunday, everybody had pork. A roast of pork and the\nProfessor would slice it, trying to be fair to everyone. Then he would slice a somewhat thinner part,\nthis 1s for Maria! He didn\u2019t know much German, I knew, because just spoke it haltingly in a way,\nbecause she gets a little less. But, I still had a portion. This was one soup, they didn\u2019t have either,\nexcept that he went a few times to Yugoslavia on trips. And he would bring some peaches from\nthere and he brought some assortment of foods. Well, this household was a very elegant household.\nThey would have culture evenings, evenings of culture. At which point they would invite about 20,\n30 people like a symphony orchestra they would play. These were doctors most of them, famous\nlawyers, jewelers, you know? And I would set up the chairs and everybody would get a little bit\ncoffee or something but everything was very elegant. The setting was always very elegant. One\nday, he comes home from one of his sudden trips and he brings some very special food and the lady\nwraps it up on a tray and she says to me to go to that neighbor, to bring a present from the El-hades\n(ph) family. I walk there, one of the most stunning houses I\u2019ve ever seen, I couldn\u2019t believe the\ngarden at that house. I ring the bell and the maid says, no, no, the maid\u2019s entrance is through the\nkitchen. I come into the kitchen and I leave that present. Then I find out who now was this family,\nwas Speer. Albert Speer\u2019s parents. I didn\u2019t know. They gave me the name Speer, the name Speer\ndidn\u2019t mean anything to me. They want the movement between history and personal experience but\nthat\u2019s true for all survivors. Well, it was an extremely beautiful neighborhood, something like our\nScotishville (ph), a very fine section of the city. And Blancka worked in her household and I\nworked in mine. For me the work was unbelievably heavy, I couldn\u2019t do it. I just didn\u2019t have the\nstrength of rolling out these very heavy rugs, carpets. Putting them on the snow and beating them\non the snow because most Europeans believed that when you beat these heavy carpets on the snow\nthat they get special treatment. To roll it up, to carry it from this, one day I remember I saw planes,\nallied planes flying over, very much over me. I could nearly talk to them, I felt it was so, but I felt\nthat day I remember, gee, the Americans are coming, or the British, or whoever it was, but I won\u2019t\nlive to see them, I was so sick of work, I was so tired of work. One day I fell off the stairway, they\nhad stairways to different floors. And I ripped my face and I think I had a few days of rest and a\nhospital, the best time of my life! I needed the rest so bad. To dig out in the cold snow, to dig out\npotatoes everyday. To take care of four children. To do the laundry. To clean the house. To beat\nthose carpets. All of this was a little bit too much for one person. Blancka was with six children\nand the German lord\u2019s point was if a woman has a family of six children they were entitled to one\nand a half help. If they had four children you were entitled to a foreign worker, I was a foreign\nworker. If you had eight children you were entitled to two, if you had six you were entitled to one\nand a half. So Blancka had another half there, that half later we found out was also Jewish. She still\nlives in Tacoma, Washington, I knew her. Blancka and I were very closely related in terms of our\ndays off. Our day off was Wednesday afternoon and occasionally we would go to the University,\nsneak in, but most of the time we would go to this beautiful forest because their houses, the suburb\nwas in forest. Most beautiful section of the city. There was a lovely cafe called Bros-pron-eur (ph).\nIt was cut out of an idyllic kind of a place. It wasn\u2019t true, it wasn\u2019t possible. That is the place when\nwe heard that the Germans have plans, according to their plans that they withdrew, they withdrew\nfrom our home town. These were the news we would get, we knew that they were loosing. But it\nwas still very much inside Germany and little by little I felt I probably will not survive the heavy\nlabor. I was not afraid of being detected because I was only afraid of the Poles, I was not, the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t know the difference, that\u2019s a fact. But going down to market for them and all\nthese things, it was uphill, it was very difficult to carry all of that. But I thought I would survive the\nwar if I could survive my health. I couldn\u2019t take that heavy labor. Well, one day, the man of the\nhouse comes in and he says, it looks as though there is some fighting going on, we would be better\noff being in the basement at night. Not to stay above because you could see all the airplanes. I\ndidn\u2019t listen to the radio, I didn\u2019t know much, but I got it from their faces that things are not going\nwell for the Germans. I didn\u2019t know how close. So he said that night we should stay in the\nbasement. So we all go down to the basement and sometime early morning I see this man, who\nalways wore the high military uniform, he use to be in Berlin with Hitler, you know, he was a very\nbig shot. But he\u2019s in his civilian clothes, it hangs on him it just looks like a diminished man. And\nhe drive out of the garage with this car and the car has a little white flag. And I still don\u2019t\nunderstand what was going on. Later in the morning, he comes back with a little bandage over his\nhand, he was wounded slightly in the street fight. He and the mayor of the city and somebody else\nwent to Mannheim to surrender the city of Heidleburg to the Americans. That\u2019s a great moment, I\nhave to celebrate.",
        "Q: Do you want to stop for a minute?",
        "A: Okay. It\u2019s one of the joys, memories. I couldn\u2019t believe it. He came back and within hours we\nheard some people were moving, rushing, we went down to the highway, we saw American tanks\nrolling. You couldn\u2019t see anybody, you just saw the tanks, they were closed up. Blancka and I\nstand next to the fields and suddenly one of the roofs of the tanks opens up and a young soldier,\nAmerican soldier, in Yiddish which he thought was German, so he says, Fraulines! Fraulines!\nFraulines! We had to make now, Munich, he wanted the road. So we hear this German Jewish and\nto say, Yidden! Yidden! Yidden! We\u2019re Jews! Well he is, but he has to keep rolling, so he throws\nus two cartons of cigarettes, of the cigarettes the war was over, you know? Well, I go back and I\nfigure this the end of my working for the Germans. Although the war was still going on, but I\u2019m\nnot going back to work there. I went back and I refused to work, but I still have my little room. So,\nHerr Professor in his civilian outfit by then, it was like a diminished man, an unbelievable change,\nwhat happens to the uniform, the high ranking uniform when you have to leave it? He comes up,\nthe Herr Professor, this is his wife, he sends her up to talk to me. And he wants me, he\u2019s concerned\nthat his wife said I\u2019m not working. And that he wants me to, he wants to know what my plans are.\nI say, I don\u2019t know, I guess Pll go back to Poland. So he says, you know what? It\u2019s not so good for\nyou to go back to Poland. After all you're an ethnic German, the Poles may not treat you so well. I\nsaid, Pll take a chance. He says, but I have a better plan for you. Here in the village is a mort-k-eye\n(ph), a store of smoke products. I have contacts there, they know me well, they will arrange for you\nto be a sales girl there. You will have a . And he notice along these lines and I figure\nI\u2019m crossing inside and finally I say to him, Herr Professor, you know what? I\u2019m neither falk-\nstoich-er (ph), nor Polish, \u2019m a Jew! And tall as the man 1s, he stretches out on the floor and\nfainted! And my floor was smooth because it was a maid\u2019s room, an attic maid\u2019s room. Well, he\nrevived. He went down, this was the end of my job. No more talking about jobs or anything. I\ndon\u2019t know how they dealt with that news, I have no idea because I realized at that point the danger\nsoon to be there. Although the Germans occupied the city by then, I didn\u2019t know how much they\noccupied. They were marching.",
        "Q: You mean the Americans were marching?",
        "A: The Americans, yes. So I figured something may happen. A night or two nights before, he\nwanted me to dig a hole in the garden where he put some guns. He hid guns there. And Blanca\u2019s\npeople hid wine. Bottles of wine. They were prepared for the Americans, you know, so the\nAmericans may want, he hid guns there. And I figured it\u2019s not good for me to be there at this point.\nWe didn\u2019t know where to go. I said to Blancka, I say, I\u2019m not working anymore. She says, I\u2019m not\nworking either. We go down to look at these tanks and the tanks keep rolling, but we have no\nmoney, there\u2019s no money, there\u2019s nothing to buy. We went into town, everything is closed.\nHeidelburg 1s totally closed up, not one store is open. And so we decided to live in these fields near\nthe highway. We slept there and we ate grass. I\u2019ll never forget after the war, the first few days we\nate grass. It\u2019s hard to believe it. We decided not to go back. And there was nothing to do but on\nthe third day I think we realized perhaps we could do something with these cigarettes. So we\nwalked into town and indeed, we knocked at the doors and we told, cigarettes, cigarettes, trading\nsomething, and they gave us some food. Finally we found our way to a place, an American Red\nCross club. That place was to serve donuts and coffee to American soldiers. It must have been\nwithin a week or two, I don\u2019t remember. We told the guys that we were Jewish and that we were\nslave laborers here and could they do something for us, could they give us a job? They agreed to\nhave us serve the boys. So if I speak English in a funny way, that\u2019s the place where I picked up my\nEnglish. I never went to school, this was my school. I served coffee and donuts and Blancka too.\nWas a great life. We got a furnished room because for the donuts we were able to trade. We\nbrought dozens of donuts to a place where they had a furnished room all ready. Then we decided\nwe need to learn English. So we went to a German woman who was a teacher of English. Gave her\na dozen of donuts and she taught us English. To the beauty parlor for donuts, everything was for\ndonuts because there was no food and we had access to as many donuts as we wanted to. So this\nput us on our feet. One day, a man comes in, in an outfit from Auschwitz, I didn\u2019t know about\nAuschwitz, I had no idea where he was from, but he wore one of these pajamas and he told us he\nwas in Auschwitz, told us his story. And he says, he needs to talk to the military governor, he needs\nsome document to go and find his wife, but he doesn\u2019t speak English. So I said, I speak English, I'll\ntake you there. I come to the military governor and he has refugee assistant and I interpret for this\nman and the military governor turns to his assistant and says, what language does she speak? That\nwas my English. I stopped going for English lessons to this woman, she taught me in a way that\nwas no English! I thought I spoke English. Slowly I learned the language and slowly a man came\nin from underground, Mr. Volinger (ph), and he started helping us in whatever way. Eventually,\nthey organized, the American Red Cross organized a transport of trucks to go to Trencin-sch-stat\n(ph) and to bring back the Jews from Heidleburg, from, and they were inthe \u2014_\u2014_\u2014_\u2014._Heidleburg,\nFrankfort, Manchester, some other towns, Offenbach. And they ask if anybody speaks Russian, I\nvolunteer to speak Russian. So they attach me, they put me in a uniform, some American soldiers\nuniform, and I go with them to Trencin-sch-stat (ph) and I say, before you go we have to cross\nRussian borders. We have to take cha-socks (ph), watches and a lot of Vodka. They don\u2019t\nunderstand, I say, trust me. That is what we will need. Well, the minute we cross the border into\nCzechoslovakia, they immediately saw these soldiers and they don\u2019t let us through. We need a\nstamp and that stamp, a round stamp, a green stamp. I say, don\u2019t bother with them, just give them\nthe cha-socks (ph), well, they salute us, we go further. We get to Karlsbad, where my sister use to\nlive. We come there, they cannot let us through because we don\u2019t have the right kind of a stamp.\nWe have a square stamp, they want a round stamp. And I say, where is your supervisor? Oh, he\u2019s\ntaking a bath. A bath? We\u2019ll wait. They say, oh no, he likes to be in the spa the whole day and the\nwhole night. So, I figure that\u2019s no way, this cost a lot of Vodka and cha-socks (ph), but we went\nfurther. Finally, it was evening, we arrive in Tilsit-en-shot (ph), it\u2019s high up. This scene I'll never\nforget again. We come with a convoy of trucks, of busses actually. And we had a list of people\nwho were deported to Trencin-en-shot (ph), hundreds of thousands of names, I don\u2019t know. They\nhad, the Red Cross had collected it. There\u2019s a big, big courtyard, it\u2019s towards the evening, and we\nsee people sort of sukkotking. These people were in a coma of dying. The Soviets brought in food\nwhich they couldn\u2019t digest. It was a terrible scene and I have that list and they cannot read the list,\nthey don\u2019t know who\u2019s alive, who\u2019s not. Before I know, a Soviet policeman, a soldier policeman,\nputs his hands on my shoulders, he says, please follow me. He gets me into the big castle, an empty\nroom, a tremendous room in the castle. It\u2019s all dark. He says, wait here, I should wait. He locks the\ndoor on the outside and I\u2019m all alone in that place. It was a horror. My only thought was, in the\nmorning, the truck will pick me up and I\u2019ll go to Siberia because that was the Russian way. I didn\u2019t\nwant to lie down, I was standing because I was afraid of rats. I was standing there the whole night,\nwaiting for the morning to be taken out, no matter where. He comes in the morning, he takes me\nout, he brings me back to the American Red Cross. Until today, I don\u2019t know what happened. I\nassume, because I spoke Russian and I wore an American uniform, that they took me for a spy. Or\nperhaps these guys intervened for me, I still don\u2019t know. We came back with a handful of people,\nthe worst of people from Heidleburg from these places. All I recall, when I crossed the border into\nGerman territory, I nearly kissed the land. That was how you do with Soviet Russia. There, I met\ntwo girls in Russian uniforms from my home town. They were in the army, they work with the\nvictorious armies, they were marching. And they told me that they saw Blanca\u2019s husband in\nKrakow\u2019. So, I told that he come back from Russia, so I went back to Heidleburg, I told Blancka\nabout it, she could hardly wait. She wanted to go to Krakow\u2019 to meet her husband, naturally. So we\nboth leave the job at the American Red Cross. There was a big repatriation movement then, they\nwere patroiting all of these people to Poland and there was a truck load of Poles coming back from\nGermany as slave labors into Poland. And all that talk you hear is anti-Semitic talk in that truck.\nWe were just about to cross the border into Czechoslovakia to go to Poland and I hear these\ncomments and it was a stop for us. I say to Blancka, you know what? I\u2019m not going back to\nPoland. I couldn\u2019t go back to Poland, I couldn\u2019t hear that talk. Here I was already in America, in a\nway, the American Red Cross. She was quite desperate about our separation, but she went, she\nwanted to find her husband. She comes to herself later, she found her husband with\nanother woman. He married a woman in Russia. Anyway, so I went back to Heidleburg. I stayed a\nwhile. Somehow or other, they had displaced persons camps, you know? I was going from one into\nanother. One day, I work for Ohrdruf, from the Red Cross they sent me to Ohrdruf because I spoke\nlanguages. I knew a little English by then, I knew Polish, I knew German, so I was useful in an\noffice. And somebody approaches me saying, is there a Maria Neider here? Maria Neider! Menek\nphoned. He literally walked through Poland and Germany from, so this was, how do you know\u2019?\nIt\u2019s Menek and he brought news that Frania is alive and he mentioned that they all came to\nGermany and I got them a house near Heidleburg because I had the rations, food, I had all that stuff.\nI\u2019m in the uniform, you saw my years of . And they sent me to A-rose-en (ph), after I\nworked in Frankfort first. Frankfort on Hurst, that was the only building that was the G.I. farm and\nfactory. The only buildings the Americans left intact in Frankfort because they thought they\u2019 Il need\nit for their military government later, so 1t was. So I worked there, Menek found me there. And\nthen they transported all of unknown people to A-rose-en (ph). They had the Germans leave the\ncity, this was a suburb of the city of Castle (ph). There was big castles there, big village. And Own-\nRae (ph) took over the town. And they sent me there and I had an apartment with another woman\nfrom America, she was of Polish origin, Maria Leiberskint. We lived there and life was pretty good.\nAnd my sister lived in Heidleburg, I would commute and bring food, I would always bring all these\nthings. I had a very interesting job, it was in the tracing, we were tracing children who were\ndispersed into Germany. No Jewish children were in question. But representatives of different\ngovernments, Polish, Yugoslavian, Hungarian, Croatian, you just name it, they came to our zone to\nclaim the children. They wanted to find their children. And the job of the Onrah (ph) personnel\nwhich I supervised for no good reason but that I knew the languages and I had an education, all of\nthis worked in my favor. They were field workers to find children. Many of these children didn\u2019t\nspeak any of their native languages, you had to identify them by some symbols or whatever.\nSometimes they uttered a word, sometimes they wore a cross which looked like a Slavonic thing.\nSome of these things, we found many of them. And we would always bring them to the attention of\nthese liaisons from their countries and they were shipped immediately to their countries. Today I\nam not sure I would do that as easily because you wanted to put children and were already observed\nby German families, what that separation meant, but those days there was no question that these\nchildren have to be removed from Germany, the belong to their families. Sometimes the families\nwere not available, but they belonged to their nations, to their countries. So these things, my staff\nwent to schools to find them, to churches, to orphanages, certainly it was most difficult with\nfamilies because families didn\u2019t want to tell us and it was detective work to find, because these kids\nwere so assimilated into Germany that they spoke German. Depending on the age too, all the\nchildren we could find easily. This was my job for a very, this was 1945, 1946, and there was\nplenty of food. I had a uniform of an American, Under Second Class because the First Class was\nthose who came from the States or from the other countries. These were Second Class, locally hired\npeople, but we had all the privileges. And one day, a man comes and sits with me in that restaurant\nthere where we had very good conditions, we had a PX, privileges, cigarettes, coffee and so on.\nAnd everybody was exchanging them for all kinds of goods. I started smoking, I became addicted\nthen. And the coffee I use to bring to my sister so she had something, anyway, I fed a whole family\non this. But, one day, a man in another type of uniform sits next to me and to begin talking. He\nsaid he\u2019s a president from the Joint Distribution Committee, and he says, as I talk to you, you\nbelong to the Joint. This was the end of wandering for me, I go to Stuttgart to work with the Joint.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "A: Okay?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see, you\u2019ve now changed your job to JDC?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me something, was JDC one of the places that, or group that were going into Poland to try\nand find Jewish children who were or had been in hiding?",
        "A: Not at that point at all. That\u2019s modern history. Joint Distribution Committee was established as\npart of Onrah (ph), they were administered and dependent on Onrah (ph). Their job was to identify,\nrehabilitate and help with the settlement of all the Jewish victims of Nazism. People were coming\nout of concentration camps so they established, and from Poland some came, from other countries.\nThe large concentration of Jews who survived was in Germany. The others we didn\u2019t touch, that\nwas Russia by then. From all the concentration camps, from all the death camps in Germany. In\nGermany there were no death camps, but concentration camps, they all came to the bigger cities of\nGermany. Particularly they gravitated towards the American occupied zone, which was Frankfort\nand Heidleburg and so on. Some went to the British zone, those who were liberated from Bergen-\nBelsen. Very few wanted to be in the Russian zone and very few wanted to be in the French zone\neven, but some did. There were concentration camps in the French zone too. Anyway, it was a job\nof the Joint to find these people, start feeding them, locating their relatives perhaps in other\ncountries, help them with immigration, so they took out the Jewish displaced persons from the other\ncamps because there was quite a bit of anti-Semitism in these camps. And they brought them into\ntheir own camps, they established Joint camps. You know, the anti-Semitism in these camps was an\ninteresting phenomenon. And they hired me as a second status employee of the Joint. I also had to\nwear a uniform. I was extremely absorbed in this work. It was to me one of the great experiences\nof my life, to be able to serve people who survived. I knew little about the concentration camp\nexperience, they didn\u2019t talk about it. My job was mainly to help them with immigration. I was\nstationed in Stuttgart, they brought me to Stuffgart. The Director of that office was a Flora Levine,\nan American woman and I was her assistant. And I recall hundreds of young people standing in line\ntrying to get to me to get a referral to the visa department because I had to process them, help them.\nI also helped with some of the counseling problems if they needed it. I spoke German, I spoke\nYiddish, I spoke Polish, I was ideal for this job in this respect. It was a job of great satisfaction. I\ncouldn\u2019t stop working, I worked literally day and night and everyday I would take these documents\nto the American Consulate in Stuttgart and he would put a stamp and here was a visa. One of the\njobs was also to help them reunite with families in America so they would get affidavits. This 1s\nanother long story. We worked very closely with what was Ny-anni-no (ph) and then was called\nUnited Service for New Americans, and Patrick was director of it, a matter later in another capacity.\nIt was extremely committed and devoted work, I\u2019ve never worked for an agency in which were such\ncommitment. I found a boyfriend there, we were suppose to be married, I later decided I didn\u2019t\nwant him. He followed me, I mean, he was an American social worker from Brooklyn, and we met\nlater in the United States but by then I withdrew from the relationship. It was a period of extreme\ninvestment and work and helping and I\u2019ve never been in this situation before. My was\nsuppose to lead to teaching in the gymnasium level. Somehow or other, this was social work. I\ndidn\u2019t know it was social work. So I represented the Joint in different places. One of the places was\nto go to the deport camp, sometimes for whatever problems. I traveled around the displaced persons\ncamps in all of the American zone. I had to go to births, I had to go to a wedding in the camps\nbecause there was tremendous activity in terms of marriage, in terms of having children. Nobody\nunderstood at all and years later I understood, it was part of the need for replenishment, for not\nbeing alone, for not facing the new world all alone, so that everyday there was a wedding, everyday\nthere was a birth and I was a representative of the Joint, I was invited. Once I went to a very\nmeaningful, extremely sad occasion. In Bergen-Belsen, I think a few months after liberation,\nperhaps a year after liberation, the Palestine Agency send a monument to be put on the grounds of\nBergen-Belsen. There was a reunion of all the inmates of Bergen-Belsen. I went as a representative\nof the Joint. This moment Ill never forget. When the Rabbi said Ka-dish (ph), there came a moan\nfrom the people, nobody cried. There was a moan, you could hear it on the steps of Russia. This\nstays with me, that moan of people. Nobody could talk, nobody could cry. There was, it was all in\nthat moan of people. Another time I remember that moan was, I just heard two years earlier, when\nin Bremen-hoffin (ph), when I was taking the boat to America, we stayed in Bremen-hoffin (ph) a\nfew weeks, waiting for the boat. The boat in which I came was the Ernie-pile (ph), that was then\nname, these are military boats, broken military boats. And again, I was a representative of this, this\nPll come to later because it was later. But anyway, so this was the work in the Joint. Extremely\ngratifying. They treated me beautifully, they send me once to Paris for a week of vacation. In those\ndays, people didn\u2019t travel to Paris on vacation, I did. They send me to Switzerland once, anyway, it\nwas all part of the job.",
        "Q: Maria, you said that people didn\u2019t talk about their camp experiences. Did you try to get them to\ntalk?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. My friends boyfriend was a man who was the son of a, who came from a\nGerman concentration, it was in Dachau or Buchenwald, I can\u2019t remember. This was in Stuttgart\nwhen I worked for the Joint. And I accidentally met him and we stayed together for a while. We\nwere very close to each other in every way. He taught me to play tennis. But, we never talked\nabout his experiences. He told me about his father, who was a very famous in\nBerlin, Bebo (ph) was the name. His mother was survived, he survived in the camp. We never\ntalked about the camp. He was lately a symphony orchestra, associate directory of the Detroit\nSymphony. He always wanted to be in the field of music, he had a career ahead of him. I didn\u2019t\nknow what I wanted to be. All I wanted was to work for the Joint for the rest of my life. I mean,\nworking with people, this was like, this was a true sense of doing something valuable. Doing\nsomething meaningful after the job as a maid. This was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I\ndidn\u2019t imagine I\u2019 Il have another life.",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to think of how to ask this question. In most people who have, including yourself,\nwho have suffered so much and lost so much, and of course there\u2019s a desperation to begin anew.\nBut there\u2019s also problems in trying to do it. Did you see, not trends in problems, but did you see\ncertain kinds of things that women, when they gave birth, was this difficult for them to be having\nchildren? Even though that may have been one of their deepest desires, and the relationships\nbetween men and women?",
        "Q: I think there was tremendous group support which helped. These children were born in the\nsukkotdow of the chimneys, literally so. I still don\u2019t understand what courage these women had to\nstart families. I still admire their courage. They forever have been psychoanalyzed as not loving\nthese children because of the traumatic birth of these children. I have seen it differently, always. I\nthink these families, these women survived emotionally only because of denial. Because they didn\u2019t\nwant to think about it, because they didn\u2019t talk about it. And the power of denial can be very, very\nfunctional and adaptive. I always teach my students this, so we don\u2019t understand it. Very difficult\nto teach mental health practitioners about it. I do a lot of lecturing on the Holocaust and this is one\nof the major lessons. That denial can be a very adaptive mechanism, very helpful and very useful.\nIn those days, the denial helped. My own denial, here I had such an intimate boyfriend. We didn\u2019t\ntalk about his camp experiences. Here I interviewed hundreds, little more than hundreds of these\nyoung men. Some of them came from, one place only recently discovered, from the city of Radom.\nI knew they were from the city of Radom and I only discovered recently that the camp in which\nthey worked was close to Stuttgart, so I got them all from Radom for some reason. But I wanted to\nknow what their first name, their second name, what they want to do in America and all these things\nbut we, where, what camp were they but the camp was a name and nothing else. There was no\ndigging into it in any way. There was a young, beautiful woman from the Joint from Brooklyn,\nbeautiful! She was the assistant of that man, my boyfriend, that, Omn (ph), the city of Omn (ph).\nAnd one day, a horrible thing happened. She stuck her head, she opened up the gas stove in her\napartment in Omn (ph), she stuck her head in and suffocated. Nobody understood the nature of her\ndeath. I suspect that it was a very strong identification with the victims. Rebecca was her name, or\nher second name, I don\u2019t remember, but she should be remembered. But there wasn\u2019t suicides\nthere, occasionally you heard a displaced person, a Jewish displaced person killed some German. It\nwas all rare. The movement was towards life. The pain would arrive, Sukkot-bot (ph) evening in\nlighting candles. And naming a child. This was the most painful decision for most families. How\ndo you name a child? A Jewish child is named after dead family members. How can you name a\nchild a hundred names? These were the big decisions and the big pain. You named a child where a\nboy could have had a name of a woman, of a mother. But these young people, they tended toward\ndenial to an extreme extent. Some of it later in life was dysfunctional, but at that point, it helped\nhaving a marriage. I had to attend many marriages, I was a representative of the Joint. Having a\nRabbi at it, having a little party afterwards, having a birth, getting visa, getting together on that boat.\nMy sister got on the boat, and her son and her second husband. She married in Krakow\u2019 right after\nthe war. He adopted the child and here they go together with Menek to America, okay? On one of\nthe boats. In the winter of 1946, I certainly helped with the arrangements, this was my job. And\nhere in Bremen-hoffin (ph) and I get a frantic call from Menek. What happened? He was on the\nboat and waiting, you were forever waiting for the boat to arrive and on the boat you were waiting\nfor no good reason, you're waiting. These were all military boats, hundred of Jewish displaced\npersons. Many Jewish people. This was the Truman quota. We had no relatives in America.\nNobody could sent us an affidavit but beginning of 1946, Truman offered a certain number of\naffidavits and we were included in it. That\u2019s how I came to America. And so did my sister. What\nhappened, they called out Menek\u2019s name to come to the pursers office. There he was told that\nretroactively the Stuttgart consulate noticed in viewing his x-rays that he had tuberculosis and he\u2019s\nnot permitted to enter America. They removed him from the boat. Here was an orphan, both his\nparents were killed. My sister was on her way. I ordered my visa to go a few weeks later. Well, I\npicked him up in Bremen-hoffen (ph), I brought him to sanitarium in German. A horrible thing,\nsanitar1um for tubercular conditions, all Germans in the Sch-wa-daltz (ph), in the Black Forest. He\nwas terribly sick, all he wanted to die. Every Sunday, this American boyfriend of mine and me\nwent to visit him. Bring him food. He always pleaded with me to take the food back. All he\nwanted was a pill of cyanide. Every Sunday night I would go home with that pain, what to do?\nEventually, I extended my visa. I got him through the Joint into Switzerland, into a Joint sanitarium\nnear Lu-gone-au (ph). There he got better, he got well. American wouldn\u2019t let him in, it had to be\nfive years after the illness is arrested totally. So we got stuck in Switzerland and the Swiss didn\u2019t\nwant him and America didn\u2019t want him. There was no money and he was hungry often. We were\nin America by then, we would send him a little money, very little, we were making a little money,\nbut we sukkotred. One day, he advises us there is a new drug out, they say, his lung was collapsing,\nhe had , everything. People were dying, all these kids from Auschwitz. They were\nteen-agers, they were dying left and right. He knew he was going to die, but he heard there was a\nnew drug called streptomycin. Can we send it. 1947, streptomycin had a tremendous price for us.\nWe couldn\u2019t, it was still experimental, whatever, we couldn\u2019t afford it. Somehow or other we made\nit and we send it to him. This began his healing process. The Joint had ideas that you have to train\nthese young people for jobs that are available so according to them, this was the time that they\nneeded book binders. So he went to them to become a book binder. Since then, I\u2019ve always been\ntelling my students that you have to do rehabilitation towards not what is available but as part of the\nvalue system and his value system, a book binder was not for him. In his value system there was a\nprofessional, to be a businessman, a professional, but not a book binder. So he didn\u2019t like book\nbinder, they kicked him out, they didn\u2019t want to entrance him. That was the Joint, but eventually\nthey helped him a little bit, very little. The Swiss police was after him all the time, when 1s he\nleaving the country? Finally he got a little better, he got himself into the University of Brussels, he\npassed tests! Believe it or not, he passed tests. He didn\u2019t know the languages but he had a good\nmind for mathematics, for chemistry, he was a very learned person, but I still don\u2019t know. They\naccepted him on a trial basis. He graduated Cum-sad-laud, Smugla-cum-laud I remember, in\nSwitzerland. Many days he was hungry there. The Jewish community of Switzerland was very\nugly. They didn\u2019t want to help these kids at all. He had a close friend who is now a doctor in, he\nretired, but he was a doctor in New Jersey. They had no money to live on. They were hungry. So\nthe Jewish community in Brussels decided, no, he was in , decided that they get them\na night job to guard in the cemetery Jewish bodies since the people brought at night and they cannot\nbe buried, they needed a Jewish guard. So these two kids, who came out of the Holocaust, they\ngave the job. Ill never forget it, P\u2019Il never forgive them for it. The Swiss Jewish community. They\nhave no sense. They were horrible to, total lack of charisma, total lack of passion or anything, so\nthey give them this job. So, this helps them a little bit. A Jewish woman, a survivor opened a little\nkitchen, a kitchen where she fed, we sent a little money to this person. But anyway, despite all of it,\nhe was apparently brilliant, we didn\u2019t know it because he was not a great student in gymnasium.\nThe motivation was how he did so very well. And every year they would tell him he\u2019s not ready yet\nto go to America. Finally, finally after many, many years he came to America. By then he was\nestablished in Switzerland. He had a degree, he started working. He hated America when he came\nbut he made it eventually. So this is the aftermath period, 1s really not known well and I\u2019m very\nglad that they\u2019re beginning to teach a little about it. This was a period of extreme stress but stress\nwhich was pushed down. Stress which was swallowed. To run away, my own trip to the United\nStates was September 24th, 1947. I came to Bremen-hoffin (ph) and the boat wasn\u2019t ready. The\nboat had not come yet. So what do you do on September 21st, whatever it was, in September in\nBremen-hoffin (ph), everything was closed, you couldn\u2019t buy anything. I had a lot of German\nmarks because German marks were very available. So I remember, I wanted to spend it before\nleaving. So I went to a beauty parlor and I got a permanent. And it took so hard work, I came to\nAmerica, I had to pay $10 to remove it. But this is the way, what money meant in those days. I got\non the boat and the Joint assigned me as an escort to the people there, which means I had to be\nresponsible for them getting, each one getting $10, each of them getting a prayer book, in time for\nthe Holidays, each of them making sure that they would get kosher food. I had to be distributing, I\nwas the mach-hack (ph). I was still a young woman but I had these jobs, as a representative of the\nJoint. I recall sitting on that boat and waiting, finally the boat moved. The anchor was cut, this is\nanother memorable moment in my life. Suddenly when the anchor was caught, it was cut. A\nmoment came from the people on that boat, they realized this was, what they were leaving behind.\nThey were leaving all their families buried there. And it wasn\u2019t important where they were going,\nbut what they were leaving. This stays with me, this moment, these moments of separation stay\nwith me. These are still the most difficult moments in the lives of survivors. But I recall distinctly\nthe moment of Bergen-Beelines, I recall the moment of the anchor cutting. Then, I still feel that\npain when I think about it because I didn\u2019t realize what that moment really meant. Leaving the\npeople behind. And going to American in those days, they swore they would never come back to\nEurope. Many, many people stuck to it, they could never go back to Europe. People were getting\nsick on the boat, it was a fourteen days ride. I was the only one to show in the dining room, there\nwas marvelous food but there was, I remember this waitress that, eat more! Eat more! There was\nso much food. The Joint gave each of us $10, make sure to distribute everything. There was a guy\nwho told me he use to be related to the, who makes candy, kosher candy in America, who was it?\nNot Manaschevits, who was the other group? I forgot, no the other bar, you know, the Jewish. He\ntold me that for the rest of my life that P\u2019Il be getting chocolate from them, I never did anyway.\nPeople were already beginning to think, but you know they got very sick, they were laying sick.\nThey could take the seaside, er, ride. I was well up to a point, the last few days I was sick too. And\nthen suddenly there is a great, jubilant voice all over. We see the Statue of Liberty. This too are\ngreat moments. It was Saturday night and they wouldn\u2019t unload us because on Sunday the workers\ndidn\u2019t work at the dock or whatever it is. It didn\u2019t matter. We were all well by then. People\u2019s\nsickness stopped since the voyage stopped. And that Statue of Liberty was the greatest sight in the\nworld! Well, I was, my sister was there waiting for me, and my brother-in-law and another friend,\nthey took me to the Bronx, they had an apartment. They wrote me to Germany, they live on Garden\nStreet in the Bronx and I thought it was a palatial place. Right across from the zoo. I saw them\nbarefoot.",
        "Q: Where, near the Bronx Zoo?",
        "A: Yes. Right across, off Southern Blvd. between 183rd Street. I had the bare feet, I walk up, a\nhorrible place, but anyway, all I wanted was to run back, but where do you go back, ever? Well,\neventually it worked out. We were struggling financially, very much. Sending half of our earnings,\nwent to Menek later because for weeks he was hungry there. It is unbelievable. The Swiss Jewish\nCommunity, I cannot forgive for it. But then I got a job, I immediately got a job. I don\u2019t know how\nimmediately I got the job. The Joint send me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal. By the way, later on\nI suddenly get a check of a lot of money, $1300, in 1947, $1300 was a fantastic amount of money in\nmy book! They paid me for the time I worked in Germany. They never told me they would pay\nme. This happens to be their good personnel policies, this I found out later. Loy-ja (ph) worked for\nthem for years. She still feels it, she has been treated extremely well. They send me no job, they\nsend me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal as a clerk. Very dull work, terribly dull work. But I\nremember the day when a telegram was sent to every employee, that they reached their quota of\n$250 million dollars, in 1947, signed by Morgan-tow (ph). Henry Morgan-tow (ph) was the chief of\nthe UJA then. And here it said that the executive director was Henry Montor (ph), I don\u2019t know if\nyou know the name, it was a big name in those days. You deal with forty, sixty bro-ter (ph), Henry\nMontor(ph) was in charge of the UJA. One day, he has a fall out with his, with Morgan-tow (ph) so\nthey had to separate. So Morgan-tow (ph) remains as the director of the UJA and Montor (ph) goes\nto another organization called the Palestine Economic Operation. They have been in business for a\nlong time, about the waterways in Palestine. The Director of Personnel at the UJA, Montor (ph)\ntook her with him, to the other organization. And she took me. So I ended up there. It was ina\nhotel which doesn\u2019t exist anymore across the Waldolf Astoria, 1t was a fine job, the rooms were air\nconditioned. They made me the archivist there. For some reason I like it because I was very quick\nin getting the files they needed. It was a good time until one day I had, I lived already in the city by\nthere, until one day I get this call from the United Service for New Americans, which is known\nNYANA, New York Association for New Americans. They\u2019ve always been in the business of\nhelping refugees. And they say, when I first came to America I had one visit with them, asking for\nwork, and they said, what I want to do? So I said, what I want to do was what I did for the Joint in\nGermany. They say, oh no, this is social work, for this you need a degree. They were stupid\nbecause I had languages and all these displaced persons they were serving they needed a person like\nme that spoke these languages, they didn\u2019t even stop. So they say, a new school of social work is\nopening up in Adell-fy (ph) and the Dean was with honor in Austria and he wants to give a Jewish\nscholarship to a displaced person. And we have many, many candidates who are more qualified\nthan you are, but we will include you if you want to. I thought about it, I didn\u2019t want to give up the\njob, I had a good paying job. This was another experience, which doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Since it\nwas a new school, they had to be more pious than the Pope. So they interviewed each candidate for\nsix days, for five days. Every day another interview. Until it came to Dr. Serrett (ph), who was a\nvery famous psychiatrist for the National Schools of Social Work. I didn\u2019t know a thing about\nsocial work. And he interviewed me, he wanted to know my childhood and everything. Just to put\nit on record. They were so limited, they never asked me about my Holocaust experience. My\nchildhood, my relation with my mother, my relation with my father, my relation with my siblings.\nThis took hours and hours, everyday an interview. The final one with Dr. Serrett (ph) and he\napparently approved so I got in. But to the sukkotme of the psychiatry profession, that nobody\nasked about the Holocaust. It was a non-subject in those days. This was 1949, 1950. Well, for\nsome reason he chose me and I got in and I was very unhappy. I didn\u2019t understand what this study\nwas all about. He usually came from the study of sociology, psychology, I was student of Polish\nliterature. They talked language which I didn\u2019t understand and I figured, how can I withdraw, how\nwill I get my old job back? It was very painful to me until the second semester, things began to go\nextremely well, let\u2019s put it this way. Nothing helps like a little success and a teacher just read my\npaper, which I thought was nothing, they all thought was excellent. Anyway, it was great and I was\ngraded very well. So this is how I got into the profession. I had no money. I lived in a, it was\namazing, with a Jewish family in, near Columbia University. Six dollars a week, I remember. I\ndidn\u2019t have enough money to live. My scholarship was paid by the University but there was a\nfoundation for Jewish girls and they were giving me $25 a week, which would have lasted except\nthat my field work in social work, three days a week you have to be in the field. And this idiot\narranged my field work to be New Jersey. So I had a lot of expenses and the school was in Adel-fy\n(ph) so $20 or whatever, $18 of that money went for travel. When I was finally selected by the\ncommittee to enter the school, the dean congratulated me and he asked me whether I want to study\ncase work, and I didn\u2019t know what case work was, so I say, what does social work have to do with\ncheese? Because case in German means cheese! He started laughing and was still laughing when I\nleft, this was my preparation for social work, but I made it. And I did well. My second placement,\nthey helped me, also in New Jersey. They couldn\u2019t find a place for me in New York, they were\nvery stupid about it. It was in a State Psychiatric Hospital. Which means that I had room and board\nthere. I lived there, and every psychiatric condition I immediately absorbed as my own. So one\nweek I was schizophrenic, the next week I was manic depressive. It was very hard on me but it was\nthe second year and I hadn\u2019t done very well, so I graduated anyway. Since then I\u2019ve had good jobs\nand been a social worker since then. I retired. I actually worked for Washington, for the Federal\nGovernment, I worked for nine years for the National Institute of Mental Health. These were\nspecial projects and drug addition. And I was a supervisor in a big agency then and I use to\ncommute and come to Washington and they were very large with money. This was the end of\n1950\u2019s, early 1960\u2019s. Johnson\u2019s programs spent a lot of money for rehabilitation, for human\nservices. They insisted I should travel first class because I had a high rank, GS-12 in those days\nwere the high rank. It was not becoming for a person with this GS grade to, not to go in important\nways. Anyway, there was a lot of stupid money spending. We didn\u2019t rehabilitate too many people I\ncan tell you, but it was an easy job and prestigious job. They sent me to be trained at Lexington,\nKentucky where they had the United States Public Health Hospital for tubercular diseases later on.\nOur job was to visit every agency and hospital in New York City, open up the doors for drug\naddicts. We did it, 1t was a whole new thing. A new ball game for me totally, but we accomplished\na lot in this respect, not that drug addicts were not rehabilitated easily but I have been involved in it\nfor many years. And then one day, again, I was re-married in 1962 and my husband was a teacher.\nHe had long vacations, he wanted his wife to go on vacations but I only had four weeks. One day\nwe came back from a summer vacation, there\u2019s a letter from the then Dean of the School of Social\nWork at Tall-a-dot (ph) who remembered me because he was my research professor at Adel-fy (ph).\nIt was a new school then, he asked that I join the faculty it was that easy. In these days, you would\nhave to have all kinds of qualifications. What happened, somewhere or other, for many years after I\ngraduated, they used that paper for a record to teach from so they remembered me this way. It was\nvery hard at Hunter from the first. I didn\u2019t want to give up my job as an AMH but they were very\ngenerous with me so they permitted me to work half time only for five years. The first five years\nwere full time, and then four years later, half time for Washington and half time for Hunter and then\nthe Washim Project came to an end and they paid me, I still get a little pension from them, which is\nnice. I belong to the Federal Employees Retirement Section, or whatever it is. So, I\u2019ve connections\nto Washington no doubt! I\u2019ve been at Hunter from 1962, first five years were half time. And I went\nthere, I retired in 1970, my marriage dissolved in 1970, we separated for the new divorce and in\n1974 he died. He was younger than I, he got leukemia and he died. And I retired from Hunter in\n1989, but I still teach the Holocaust course so I remain very much in, connected to the Holocaust\ncourse. I started it on my sabbatical year because I was emotionally more ready to confront that\nmaterial. Until then, it was always with me, but I couldn\u2019t quite read. I started digging into it and\nsince then I cannot leave it, now and forever involved in it.",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: This was, my sabbatical was 1978 and I started teaching in 1979 and I have been teaching it still\nsince. It\u2019s always been an important part of my life and since then I have been lecturing all over\nbecause it\u2019s the only school of social in the country which offers it, which is unusual. Yes, which is\nvery unique, so I\u2019m still with it.",
        "Q: Were you unhappy to leave the case work that you were doing and go into teaching? Did you do\nit because your husband wanted you to do it?",
        "A: By then I was not doing any, I didn\u2019t care, I was a supervisor. I had a big job, I published, I\nwrote something on drug addition and I didn\u2019t want to leave because it was a very well paying job at\nthat point and it was a prestigious job. My husband wanted me to but this was not the major thing.\nI was not a little woman ever in my life. I think my parents sort of made me feel I\u2019m okay and this\nreally helped I think. I\u2019ve never succumbed this way, but my husband wanted it. What was very\nnice was the prospect of long vacations. We always traveled for ten years which was great. But,\nno, there was always something in teaching that was prestigious. I didn\u2019t think they would take me\nbut they did and there were lots of times there too, all kinds of politics in the University so I don\u2019t\nneed to tell you about it, very often they want me out. Eventually I made my way in and eventually\nI did well, but I had rough years there too. The work was overwhelmingly big, a lot of work. And\nthere\u2019s so much competition there. If you were on good terms with one, the other one was angry to\nyou. Not because of me but because of perhaps they didn\u2019t like the other person because politics of\nthe University are something to write books about. But basically, it\u2019s a decent school, it was a\ndecent school and of all the jobs I had there admissions work, you know, you do everything. I had\nfaculty advisement. The favorite thing for me was always teaching. I liked accompanying the\nstudents and this saved me always, always. There were rough years too. When I retired they did\nsomething awfully nice for me. They established a collection of Holocaust literature in my name.\nAnd it\u2019s there which 1s, and I wanted it in the name, I had a conflict of which name it should go, I\nwanted my parents too and I wanted my husband too. So first we had it Maria Herr Schneider\nRosenbloom, they said, but what became Maria Herr Rosenbloom. And occasionally I lectured\nfrom it, books I bought, that is continuous sort of input which is great, couldn\u2019t be better. My\nparents will be remembered this way, my family will be remembered this way, it\u2019s marvelous I\nthink. But since then I\u2019ve always been in private practice a little bit. But always Holocaust related.",
        "Q: Private practice?",
        "A: Yes. Always Holocaust related, always. The first ttme I work with Holocaust survivors was in a\npsychiatric, I was working in psychiatry because it was a natural thing for me. I was trained in a\nway, so my first job was the psychiatric clinic of the Bathesda Hospital. And there I was the only\nYiddish speaking person, none of the psychiatrists spoke Yiddish, or wanted to speak Yiddish. So I\nwas very much involved with every patient, nearly every patient. Many of these people were\nconsidered refugees from Europe. These were all concentration camp survivors. Nobody knew the\nterm. I remember many, many fantastic situations from there. One man refused shock treatment so\nthey sent him to see me, see Miss Schneider. Because I speak the same. And in my stupidity I\nthought, why not? He says his mother-in-law disapproves, I said, I'll talk to your mother-in-law.\nAnd his boss, he doesn\u2019t want his boss to know, so I say, okay, I can talk to him too. I exhaust all of\nthe possibilities and he says to me, to tell me the truth. I don\u2019t want to make con-a-des-ot-rich (ph),\nshocking, no, electric shock treatment of me. Some of these scenes were unbelievable. One\nwoman, this I\u2019ll never forget. She should be remembered somewhere as a result. One woman, an\nfrom the Lower East Side, I didn\u2019t know her background very much, but she told me\nthat she needed an apartment. They were in a horrible walk up and they so needed to, it was very\ndifficult, it was after the war, apartments were not available. So I did everything possible to move\nthis family. Finally, on Grant Street on the Lower East Side, projects came up. Lower income\nprojects and I got an apartment for them in a new building. With elevators, with everything. The\nday they move, to move, she runs into the clinic desperate, insisting she must see me. Crying,\nfalling down on the floor. I\u2019ve never seen such, what happened? She cannot live there, she moved\nin and she, I have to being her back to the old place. She cannot live there and I don\u2019t understand\nwhat was going on. This goes on for a while, that she cries, I must do something for her, she\ndoesn\u2019t want to live there anymore. She didn\u2019t say commit suicide, but she doesn\u2019t want to live\nanymore. Finally, I still didn\u2019t understand, finally she says, the incinerators. I, that was a moment\nof awakening for me. I didn\u2019t know about this revulsion, nobody talked about these things in those\ndays. She could not live with the reminder of Auschwitz. She couldn\u2019t live with the incinerators.\nSo, this was a point of learning for me. Then I started taking histories which included the history,\nuntil then, he was born in Chop-kov (ph) and Poland and he went through the war, he was in a\ncamp, he was in a war camp. That was the level of knowledge. But since then, I\u2019ve got a lot of\nexperience. For four years I worked in psychiatric clinic. Gave me a lot of experience in working\nwith survivors. One woman left her child in the hospital, she didn\u2019t want the child. I went on a\nhome visit, she and her husband thought, she delivered there, they didn\u2019t want the child. Who\nwould defend such a thing? And then I heard them speak. She was in a camp and she saw some\nhorrible fate of children. And he was so identified with her that he literally repeated all her words\nand all her ideas, he assumed all her ideations. In those days we had a term for it, a-folly-adert (ph),\nhe thought exactly like his wife. So these were things none of the doctors understood any of it\nbecause it was a non-subject. The Holocaust was a non-subject truly until Ish-metz (ph) story came\nthrough. I was very lucky to have this experience and I always stayed with it in a way. I started\nattending meetings. There was some, what was his name? A psychiatrist, Christal (ph) and Freidel-\nlander (ph), they began to talk about it. And then when I established a course I became very much\ndevoted. But I\u2019ve always had patients of this background, very few, but always to see some people\nwith this kind of background. I still see one, what do you call it? Load-man-ish (ph), doesn\u2019t really\nmatter really, you know, but I\u2019ve always kept a foot in the door with this so I\u2019ve been always into it.\nIt helps in my teaching. I need to bring the past experience, the survivor agencies.\nI never left the Holocaust. It\u2019s strange, but somehow or other, it became a central part of my life. I\nam sure the central part of every survivor\u2019s life, but I\u2019m more aware of it. You never leave the\nHolocaust behind really. Those you see or those you don\u2019t see. Those who talk and those who\ndon\u2019t talk. It is the same coin, it\u2019s just the reverse side. But if they don\u2019t want to talk or whether\nthey talk obsessently about it, it\u2019s the same. You don\u2019t exorcise it, it is with you. Some remember,\nsome don\u2019t want to remember. You don\u2019t want to remember because it\u2019s so central to your life.\nThe pain is so strong. Sometimes people don\u2019t stop talking about it. With me and with all of us it\nhas been a central, we are very aware of the centrality of this experience in our lives. The question\nalways arises how is it possible, you know, but you can build on the trauma. I always think of the\nMexican cities, the Mayans, who talk about these things. You can build on ruins, that be my point.\nYou never resolve it, you don\u2019t work it through. I teach my students this way, it\u2019s new teaching to\nmany of us, but they will learn it. You don\u2019t work through this kind of a trauma. You don\u2019t come\nto terms with it ever, I think. But you work on top of it and you try to build some meaningful lives.\nAnd this is really what\u2019s important, this helps you I think. Although I\u2019ve seen many people have\ndone very, very, obtained riches and I don\u2019t consider their lives very meaningful but they kept\ngoing. It\u2019s really building on top of the trauma, like building on top of a ruin. Starting up, what\nyou're doing is there. It doesn\u2019t have to destroy your life, that\u2019s my point.",
        "Q: So the meaning that you build is always above what happened? It\u2019s not that you integrated this\nmeaning?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think your fully integrated with the Holocaust ever. But I do think that to have, to give\nsome meaning to it. To whatever you do, like our lecturing, people come to see you, you have to\ngive testimony. We all find some meaning in doing something so the people will not be forgotten.\nThis helps us. Now, I never feel that this is beneficial emotionally because survivors refuse to get\nany emotional benefits from the tragedy. But to find some meaning in it, either through\nremembering, through testimonies, through writing, through supporting the State of Israel, through\nsupporting the Museum. All of these things give some meaning and they help in going on, I think\nso. It\u2019s mainly helping in transmitting something to the new generations. But there are many\nvictims of the Holocaust. People could never really start living again. Some have ended up in the\nState hospitals. I give lectures there, at Manhattan State Hospital, Lochin State Hospital, some of\nthe doctors told me that they have casualties of the Holocaust for forty years, they came. Nobody\nunderstood it there. Their tragedies, nobody understood them or somehow or other nobody helped\nthem and they may be there or may be dead but, many people have nightmares. My sister still\nsuffers from nightmares. I have enough of repressive potential in me that I don\u2019t suffer from that\nbut many people have nightmares, many people have suffered continuous migraine headaches,\nmany people have extreme fears, many have many phobias. Many, many gastro-intestinal\nsymptoms from eating glass which was put into bread in Bergen-Belsen. There are many, many\nphysical and psychological manifestations but, by and large, while we have a large number of these\npeople that are still alive, we have many more, we have many more who have done well. Who use\nthis experience in more positive ways, particularly the second generation are very impressive this\nway. They try to give some meaning to their parental experiences. I teach along these lines, which\nmeans I don\u2019t deny the tragedy and I don\u2019t bely some of the consequences of psycho-pathology\nnature, but I think that the positives of it, the strength of survivors, is quite impressive. Even if they\nhave conflicts of all kinds. Many have literally risen from ashes, let\u2019s face it. And have formed\ngood families. In some families, the Holocaust has led to a lot of conflict, has lead to prejudices,\nhas lead to exclusion. But by and large, survivors have had to pave the way. Take a look at the\nArmenians. They didn\u2019t have an Armenian Genocide Museum until the survivors built one in\nWashington, or whatever. We are taught a lot of people have suffered massive tragedies to find the\nmeaning in the tragedy. I think that Holocaust survivors have truly lead the way to it. You and I,\nwe are starting so much more.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one question here. Given what happened after the Holocaust. If I just name,\nCambodia or Bosnia, or Rwanda, Tibet. What, is there a conflict in you about the world you may\nhave learned, maybe it was a lesson you never had to learn, about how wrong this is, but, there\nseems to be something in the world that repeats. And now the world has learned how to do this.\nAnd it hasn\u2019t said, we won\u2019t do it. Only certain people have said it, we won\u2019t do it. Is there a kind\nof conflict in you about, what meaning can you create after the Holocaust if such things can keep\nrepeating?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure I know, definitely, I do not know. However, in my course, I integrate the lessons,\nlike some of the experiences in Rwanda. The newest, at earlier times when I first started teaching, it\nwas Cambodia. Actually, every one of these events triggers off the students questions about it, so I\nwant students to look at it, that it continues. What will ever stop it I definitely do not know. I do\nnot think it is a psychological thing, I think that it\u2019s in politics, in economics, in geographic\ndislocations, there are many, many things that brings it to that eruption. I think that Yugoslavia was\nsomewhat of a different kind of ball game. I don\u2019t compare with it with Rwanda or with Cambodia.\nI have on my bookcase here a book from a girl who survived Cambodia. She has a Polish name,\nShe-man-ski (ph) and she\u2019s of Polish parentage I think. You know the name? It\u2019s called, The\nStones Cry Out. And it is as tragic as the Holocaust. And Rwanda certainly is, we\u2019re just so far\nremoved. The lesson we haven\u2019t learned is to be identified, 1s to feel with them. Important as you\nare, I think affect is important, to feel 1s very important. This, I don\u2019t know very well, how we can\ntransmit it. That it appears in the New York Times, a very few in this, and then it disappears. Some\nof these things should be held forever in the country for the people. We should never forget\nRwanda. Whom do I know that really knows about it?",
        "Q: One small question, at the end. For example, you mentioned a last name of yours, it appears,\nSchneider. Is that Schneider?",
        "A: Neider, my husband\u2019s name. Never Schneider! His parents name has the German spelling\nwhich is N-E-I-D-R. His parents already Polandized it, an A-J. I had a job once in a very anti-\nSemitic hotel in the Androdic\u2019s (ph). These people hired me, they were Jewish people with a\nJewish name, they hired me because my name sounded very non-Jewish, Maria Nedja.",
        "Q: Maria, thank you very much.",
        "A: Thank you for listening.\n{Viewing pictures]",
        "A: This is my father and this picture was taken sometime in the 1930\u2019s. I think he was in his late\n40\u2019s then or early 50\u2019s, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Samuel Hirsch. Okay. This is a picture taken when I was an adolescent, I think, a teen-ager. To\nmy right is my sister, Frania, five years older and to my left is Menek\u2019s aunt, his father\u2019s sister, she\nwas killed in the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Where is Menek?",
        "A: Oh, Menek is sitting right there. Menek is right there at our feet.",
        "Q: And who\u2019s the person in the middle?",
        "A: That\u2019s me! To my left or to the left is my picture taken in early 1943 upon escape from the\nghetto. I wear a Ukrainian shirt and my name then was U-lee-ana Gol-ska (ph). The next picture\nwas taken a few months later, I believe. I had to change my name to Kash-e-mair Shul-ko-vif-ka\n(ph), both are 1943. This is my husband, Noonik Neider. This picture was taken sometime in the\nmiddle 1930\u2019s. He was killed on February 2nd, or a day later, 1943. This is my sister, Frania, and\nher son, I believe three years old. I think this was taken sometime in Re-volf (ph) in 1943, I assume\nSO.",
        "Q: And her son\u2019s name?",
        "A: Her son\u2019s name, the Jewish name was Ale-ya-ho (ph), his name under assumed identity was\nLash-ick, now he is Dr. Alex Gutterman. A professor of social work at Columbia. This is me in an\narmy uniform in 1946 in Auto-en-sign (ph), Germany. This was called script money, it was money\nused by the American military personnel and those attached to them, like ANRA or the Joint\nDistribution Committee. It was not available to the population in general.",
        "Q: Available in DP camps?",
        "A: No, it was not available to DP camps, it was only available to people who were with the\nAmerican army or the attach\u00e9\u2019 personnel like ANRA and the Joint, and it was possible for them to\nuse the money to buy in military stores called PX. This is our house in Kolomyja which I\nphotographed, unfortunately, I cut off half of it. I photographed it in Kolomyja four years ago when\nI first visited for the first time after the war. It was an extremely difficult trip for me and when I\nwalked up the staircase, I walked up and down, I couldn\u2019t quite make it to the apartment. Somehow\nor other I pushed myself extremely much and I finally went in. Downstairs in the olden days was\nthe business. The first floor was occupied by the family and on top of the floor was a very big attic\nwhich was the maga-zeln (ph) where they kept all the business things. But too, this balcony was a\nvery important part of our life. It was overseeing the car-so (ph) so we could see what was going on\nin town, who was dressed well, who was not, and so on. To the right, the right windows were what\nyou called the salon or living room. To the left were the, was the bedroom of my parents. In the\nback were rooms which had no windows but sky lights. One of the rooms was considered the living\nroom one summer and the other was the children\u2019s room. And in the back of that was a very big\nhallway which was used in the summer for all kinds of gatherings. On top of it was a tremendous\nattic and this attic I say was part of the business. Now we lived there, the apartment has been\ndivided and was given right after the war by the Soviets, was given to their two Generals so, one of\nthe General\u2019s still lived there, he didn\u2019t want to let me in and the other part belongs to a widow of\nthe General. She too refused to let me in, but with a lot of persuasion from the guide, she did open\nthe door. I could see inside, it was very neglected and I could see one of our rugs still hanging on\nher wall.",

        "Q: I think there was tremendous group support which helped. These children were born in the\nsukkotdow of the chimneys, literally so. I still don\u2019t understand what courage these women had to\nstart families. I still admire their courage. They forever have been psychoanalyzed as not loving\nthese children because of the traumatic birth of these children. I have seen it differently, always. I\nthink these families, these women survived emotionally only because of denial. Because they didn\u2019t\nwant to think about it, because they didn\u2019t talk about it. And the power of denial can be very, very\nfunctional and adaptive. I always teach my students this, so we don\u2019t understand it. Very difficult\nto teach mental health practitioners about it. I do a lot of lecturing on the Holocaust and this is one\nof the major lessons. That denial can be a very adaptive mechanism, very helpful and very useful.\nIn those days, the denial helped. My own denial, here I had such an intimate boyfriend. We didn\u2019t\ntalk about his camp experiences. Here I interviewed hundreds, little more than hundreds of these\nyoung men. Some of them came from, one place only recently discovered, from the city of Radom.\nI knew they were from the city of Radom and I only discovered recently that the camp in which\nthey worked was close to Stuttgart, so I got them all from Radom for some reason. But I wanted to\nknow what their first name, their second name, what they want to do in America and all these things\nbut we, where, what camp were they but the camp was a name and nothing else. There was no\ndigging into it in any way. There was a young, beautiful woman from the Joint from Brooklyn,\nbeautiful! She was the assistant of that man, my boyfriend, that, Omn (ph), the city of Omn (ph).\nAnd one day, a horrible thing happened. She stuck her head, she opened up the gas stove in her\napartment in Omn (ph), she stuck her head in and suffocated. Nobody understood the nature of her\ndeath. I suspect that it was a very strong identification with the victims. Rebecca was her name, or\nher second name, I don\u2019t remember, but she should be remembered. But there wasn\u2019t suicides\nthere, occasionally you heard a displaced person, a Jewish displaced person killed some German. It\nwas all rare. The movement was towards life.

        "Answer: Thank you, Joan.",
        "A: Yes. I was born December 26, 1918, which in Poland is Christmas, so I\u2019m a Christmas child.\nAnd I was born in the city of Kolomyja, which at the time I was born was Poland, it was newly\ncreated Poland. Before then, it was Hapsberg, Austria. Therefore, my parents spoke German and I\nwas brought up in the German language. My parents eventually learned some Polish but they didn\u2019t\nlike the language, so at home the language was German. When I came to school I naturally had to\nlearn Polish so at the age of five-and-a-half I entered a Polish school in Kolo-mier (ph) and I said\nsomething in Polish which didn\u2019t sound right because it was not my initial language. So the\nchildren, including the teacher, started laughing, making fun of me. Naturally, it was quite\ntraumatic. I ran home crying, crying I\u2019Il never go to school again. Well, I did go back. And I\u2019ve\nbeen a student for many, many years later. Interesting enough, when I thought about this experience\nmany years ago, I think it played an important role in my later life choice of Polish as the aid of\nconcentrations university, strange as 1t may sound. But there are some dynamics that turned it\nupright anyway so this was my experience. Actually, I was writing still, I still am, and German and\nPolish are pretty much my languages even though, although they have both deteriorated. Well, the\nway I remember Kolomyyja, it was a small town, although it wasn\u2019t small to the eyes of a child. And\nlater when I visited the smaller towns, the villages around, it seemed that Kolomyja was big. It\u2019s an\ninteresting thing about Kolomyja that, as I write about it just years later, many years later, that Ta-\npan-gee (ph) was an important city during the earlier centuries. It\u2019s very old. They just celebrated\nseven hundred and fifty years of the birth of the town and they say it goes back even further. It was\nransacked, it was demolished, it was burned all the way, many times, first by the Tartars, then by the\nMongols, or vise-versa, then by the Cossacks. There were endless destruction\u2019s and occupations of\nKolomyja. I do not know how far my father\u2019s family goes back. The name was Hiersch (ph) and I\nwas born as Matylda Hirsch.\nMy parents wanted to Polonaise my name because that was important for them, I assume, as many\nparents do, but at home I was called Mattie because my parents spoke German. My father spoke\nYiddish with many of his helpers in the store and business with some of the people in the\ncommunity, but my mother was very snobbish about it. She came from another city called Chad-\nno-vich (ph). Czernowitz was a bigger city, it was a very snobbish city, it was, they called\nthemselves small Paris, little Paris. Her parents lived there. Actually, I knew only her father\nbecause her mother died just before I was born and I was named after her mother. So she had that\nair of Czernowitz about her and she despised Kolomyja and she despised Ukrainian town and she\ndespised the Polish people and she didn\u2019t want to hear any of the Yiddish language. So, sadly\nenough, I was brought up in the German language and German was the language, but certainly I\nspoke Polish later and, with my girlfriends it was always Polish. There was a city itself, I saw it\nonly forty years ago for the first time I went back. It\u2019s a handsome city now and as I read some of\nit\u2019s history, it had a rich history, over the centuries it was a town in which a lot of trade was going\non. It was on the tracks between Poland and Austria and Romania, so apparently business and trade\nwas very important. My own father came from a whole generation of people who owned the same\nstore, the same business. This was porcelain and enamel and glass. So we always had the very\nbeautiful table settings because of their availability. I remember that when my older sister got\nmarried, and her husband didn\u2019t have a profession, so my father took him into the business. But\nsmartly gave him a special division of it, so he became the importer of chandeliers. It all sounds\nvery, very strange but this was back in our time. My father was Orthodox, my mother came also\nfrom a religious family, but not as Orthodox. So there was a little bit cheating, I suppose, but she\nwore a wig because it was important in our home town. My father was a follower of Rabbi, he was\na Hasidic, a follower of a Rabbi called Wishnitz, he came from the city of Vinnitsa. Apparently he\nwas important in the Rabbinical dynasty and as a child I remember the Wishnitz (ph) Rabbi coming\nand staying in our home and I didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: I was crushed by the, by the tone of all these people. He would come, I was very young then, he\nwould come Thursday night for Sukkotbat. So on Thursday night, from the railway station, he\nwould come escorted by about 200 hus-a-dem (ph), some from his own entourage\u2019 and some from\nour home town, and because it was dark, 1t was evening, they would come with, the German name\ncomes back, \u201cFalken\u2019\u2019, these lightings, strobes carried in the street, torches, right? Now it comes\nback. I sometimes think in German from my childhood years. So they were full of torches and to\nthe dark night of my home town, which was very Anti-Semitic, although I wasn\u2019t exposed to it, I\nsensed it, and the women would stand on the balcony and greet them, saw them coming in. Since I\nwas so young, to me this was an overwhelming picture and I said I didn\u2019t like it. They all came into\nour house, which was big and he would give him the biggest room. In front of his room was a\nGabbai, a Gabbai was the assistant of the man who collected the quitels, and quitels is something\nthat a Jew would write out on a paper asking the Rabbi for advice. So together with the paper I\nassume that the Rabbi got the money too. I suspect it so. But anyway, the Gabbai stood in front of\nour living room where the Rabbi held court and he would see people. Hundreds of people would\nwalk through our home. And to me this was overwhelming, very unhappy kind of experience. I\nwas the youngest and I think on me it worked more than on my sisters because I was already born\ninto Poland, it made a difference. Since I\u2019m the youngest, my experience of learning school and\notherwise was different than that of my older sisters. It shows you the meaning of history.",
        "A: Five years each, five years each. My older sister was Cyla, C-Y-L-A if you want it, and there\nwas a difference of twenty years between us all. I\u2019m not sure, but something like it. She married\nJacob Goldstein, a man from Lvov who didn\u2019t have money and didn\u2019t have much of a profession,\nbut he was the son of a Talmudist and to my father, that was important. So, there was a\ntremendous wedding, all my sisters had tremendous weddings except me, and their only son,\nMenek, survived the war. I don\u2019t know whether I should go into, she was killed in the last days of\nthe ghetto and her husband was transported to the Belzec Extermination Camp in 1942.\nAnyway, that was my sister, Cyla, and she lived a pretty middle-class, it was pretty prosperous. Her\nhobby was to do petite work, petite point, and I remember her beautiful pictures on the walls, all her\nown work. This was her hobby. She was well known in town, she had girlfriends and when their\nson was born, it was a great thing because he was the only boy in the family, until then we had\nnothing but girls. Now the next sister was Frieda, her name, my sister Cyla, was Cyla Goldstein,\nthat was her name and her son is Menek Goldstein, and he survived. My next sister was Frieda.\nShe was very beautiful. Frieda married a man who was a cousin, a second cousin. He came from\nCal-es-sa-bot (ph), from a resort town, very well known spot in Europe. His father was a brother of\nmy father, but that was of a different mother so they were step-brothers. And therefore, it was\npermitted for them to marry, even so, they worried that they\u2019re offspring may suffer from it and be\nmentally retarded, whatever. She ain\u2019t, she\u2019s a doctor of eye diseases. She turned out to be okay.\nBut this wedding, I remember vaguely. I only remember my dress, I don\u2019t know why. It was the\nmost beautiful dress I\u2019ve ever had. And their wedding was held in Stanislawow, a city a little bit\nbigger than Kolomyja. This is somehow, I still remember. No, she lived in Karlsbad (ph) which\nmeans she lived in a privileged place because Karlsbad (ph) was a beautiful international spot and\nhe was making a good living, he had many patients so it was sort of high life. Anyway, in 1938\nHitler occupied .. .",
        "A: Oh, you want to go this way, sure. Then the younger sister, also five years younger, is Frania.\nFrania survived. By the way, my sister Frieda survived and in Czechoslovakia they got out of\nDorosig into Palestine. She\u2019s still alive, she\u2019s unfortunately in a nursing home now and her husband\ndied a few years ago. Then, there\u2019s my sister, Frania. She\u2019s alive, she lives in my neighborhood,\nher husband was killed, and they\u2019re child, Laszek, Alex, was about three years old in the ghetto and\nmiraculously he survived and he lives in New York City. Though she later re-married and her\nsecond husband adopted him so his name is Alex Gitterman.\nAnd then comes me. I was the youngest. No, my sisters still had a background of Hapsberg,\nAustria, although Frania was very young then. In 1916 I believe, my parents ran from Kolomyja\nbecause of the war. And they came to, they ran to a place which is near Sigit, Marmorosk I think,\nwhich is where Wiesel comes from, which was a border of Romania and Hungary. There were\nlarge Jewish communities there. My father went into hiding there because the Austrian army was\nbusy trying to find men to fight their war, they needed my father naturally, so they lived a very, very\ndifficult kind of life. I think they lived in Mon-room-a-vot (ph). And at that time I still had another\nsister, whom I never met, she died right there. She was between Cyla and Frieda and I think she\nwas fourteen years old when she developed a serious appendix condition and there was no time to\nget to the hospital, she died right in my father\u2019s arms, I understand. Some things that I heard about\nyears later, my parents didn\u2019t talk about it, but it was always in the air and I suspected that\nsomething happened there, but I say, I was born after, I didn\u2019t know. Only about ten years ago,\nwalking in the beautiful woods of Switzerland, my mother\u2019s younger brother told me about it. They\ntalked about her in some ways, her name was Yetta, but it was hushed-hushed and it was never quite\nthere. I\u2019m sure that my childhood was spent in a family which suffered from depression, yet it was\nnot, it was covered over. Probably because my father was a Hasidic and in the Hasidic tradition, joy\nand pain are mixed. So, I think so, in looking back at it that my childhood was very complex\nbecause it was a Hasidic family and my mother was, had that air of a bigger city with more\ncivilization and the country in which I lived was Polish Anti-Semitic, so I would think I have the\nstrength of all of that in some way in my own personality. But, I remember there were times of\nwhen my mother would cry and this was the anniversary, not only of the deaths of my sister and her\ndaughter, but the death of her mother. They all lived in that hiding place near Sigit there and my\ngrandmother, her mother, died of a heart attack, apparently still a young woman, so for my mother it\nmust have been a horrible loss. She would go to visit her father later, she once took me to\nCzernowitz and this I remember. These things are very vague in my memory because they were not\ntalked about, but it was there in the air and from time to time I would overhear something.\nThere\u2019s a good possibility I tried to protect myself from the pain too. So I grew up in this family in\nwhich I was extremely important because only years back later, I could understand the importance\nof me. Because I had to replace all these losses, I\u2019m sure. So, I was an extremely overprotected\nchild to the extent that I hated it, I was embarrassed by it. When I sneezed, there was immediately a\ndoctor around me. When I went to school, and I forgot my breakfast, somebody from the store\nwould knock at the door of my class and bring me the breakfast. My mother was extremely anxious\nabout me and my parents over-protected me in a way which probably helped them some way but\nalso did not. So my sister Frania, I think, was a little bit jealous, I never knew about it because no\nmatter what I did was fine. Which means I wasn\u2019t prepared for the hardships of life that later came\nmy way. I was a child who could never do wrong. And they thought I was bright and I did\nextremely well in school. To the end of my sister because she didn\u2019t do so well, she was pretty and\nshe liked to go with boys and she wasn\u2019t so interested in studies. I was, all of my, the grades were\nalways above \u2018A\u2019, you know? Once I brought a \u2018B\u2019, I cried for weeks! I got a \u2018B\u2019 in mathematics\nwhich was unbelievable because it was always \u2018A\u2019s in other subjects and my preferred subject was\nPolish literature, romantic Polish literature.",
        "A: No. I was a child who was smart. I don\u2019t think I was pretty, my sisters were pretty, my two\nsisters, Frania and Frieda were very pretty, but I never experienced a sense that I wasn\u2019t okay.\nLooks didn\u2019t matter. I was accepted. I say I was, scholastically, I did so extremely well. My sister,\nFrania, still remembers with pain that when my mother would go to the teachers for the periodic\nvisitations, they would say, how come your daughter, Frania, cannot do that well? I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t\ndo her any good, but that\u2019s what she remembers. But she was very pretty.",
        "A: Oh, how do you know this? As, I must have been six years old, eight years old, I\u2019m not sure.\nMy parents hired a violin teacher for Frania and myself. And we didn\u2019t like it. But anyway, I\nmastered in playing the Hatikva so every Saturday night, many guests, our house was full of guests\nalways.\nI think I still carry this tradition to some extent. We had to play, the ha-tic-fa (ph) had to play, a few\nother things. It was not something that I really liked very much. Probably I couldn\u2019t identify with\nthe teacher. We also had a teacher of Hebrew. Darlis Bate (ph). And him we hated! He was a\npoor, old Jew who didn\u2019t know to teach. My sister and I use to bribe him, give him a zloty and he\nwould go, he would leave earlier. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t learn much so until these days, I cannot\nread any of the Hebrew text and I\u2019m sorry about it, I wish I could. But this was my mother, my\nmother looked away because it wasn\u2019t as important to her and as girls, we were not suppose to learn\nmuch of the Hebrew text. We never was suppose to go to synagogue until you're married so I never\nwent to synagogue because when I married, the war was on and I\u2019ve never gone to a synagogue. I\nremember, right after the war, there was some gathering of the American soldiers and I was\nincluded and it was in a synagogue in Heidelberg, I\u2019m not even sure, but occasionally I go now to\nreligious service but a synagogue is not part of my life and this is because of my background.",
        "A: All were Jewish. Well, in primary school, what you call, elementary school, there were non-\nJewish students too. I do not recall contact with them. I had two close friends, both were neighbors\non both sides of our house. We use to visit with each other. My main preoccupation was with\nreading. When my girlfriends would come and to ask where I was, my mother or whoever was\naround would say, you'll find her in a book!\nThis was my childhood, I was an avid reader. But I liked to play with them and both of them were\nkilled, but we use to go away a lot. I think this too established my pattern of traveling later in life.\nFor ten weeks, every year, my parents would remove me from school a little earlier. It had to start\nthe 15th of June and I wouldn\u2019t come back until sometime in September. Every year we would go\nto the mountains. My mother believed that we didn\u2019t look well enough, that we needed all the fresh\nair. She believed in these things. So we went to the Carpatian Mountains because my home town is\nsurrounded by the Carpatian Mountains, Kolomyja is the entry to the Carpatian Mountains. We\nwould go to different places, the names may mean nothing, but from time to time they crop up.\nLosuv, Garemcze, Delatyn, these were the places. The way we would go, it was so funny, my\nfather would stay behind and he would come one week. But we would go for the ten weeks and we\ntook everything along because these were pretty primitive villas. My mother insisted on a villa\nwhich was inside and which was always surrounded by trees; apple trees, pear trees and plumb\ntrees. Poland has a lot of very delicious fruit so there had to be trees, that was the requirements of\nhiring a villa. And it had to be close to the street but not too close, close to the street so we could\nlook and see some traffic but not too close so nobody would come close to us. And it had to be on a\nlittle river. On a little stream. And we would go swimming there, not swimming really, sitting\nunder the stones. My sister, Cyla, made it into her real hobby. She would go every morning, sit\nunder these stones in which you had a, what do you call it, little water fall and she would sit there\nfor hours hoping she would loose weight this way. She was overweight and she wanted to loose\nweight, this was her idea. One day, she decided she really wants to do it more professionally so\nthere was a man from Warsaw, a Polish man, who ran a special spa for the loosing weight. He was\nAnti-Semitic to the core. His name was Dr. Tarnovsky, but Jewish middle-class women like all the\nothers went there to loose weight. Well, she didn\u2019t like that too much so one day they had an\nafternoon off and she went to the village and she moved into Konditorai, a cafe. Konitorai I knew\nwas a very special institution. It\u2019s coffee and hot chocolate and there was beautiful pastries. So, she\neats here pastry and drinks the chocolate and here walks in Dr. Tarnovsky and he sees that thing, he\nwalks over to her and he slaps her, right across her face.\nWell, this was an awakening for her. She never went back to that spa anymore. But this was the\nsituation. Part of it was, anti-Semitism in Poland just had its full way, in different ways, but I\npersonally did not experience it in elementary school, perhaps not in elementary school but in High\nSchool. Until I come to that, I remember these different locations of our traveling to for this\nsummer, and it was a whole trip. In front of us was always a carriage with horses which would\ncarry our beddings, our dishes, our household kosher which meant you needed double dishes, and\nsome furnishings. This was in front and in the back was Fiakev, a drosh-ka (ph), with my mother,\nmy father if it was for the week-end and all children. There was a maid, a woman to clean and it\nhad to be a Jewish maid to cook because we were Kosher. So coming to these places, my mother\nbelieved in good air, fresh air and food. So she wanted us to drink milk from the cow. And she\nwould bribe us. So food was always something which they had to beg us to eat. I would get either\na zloty or a big piece of chocolate to drink that milk and I always managed to avoid drinking that\nmilk. It was a game going on, I still hate milk for this reason. I was so ostioperosis probably\nbecause I didn\u2019t drink enough milk.",
        "A: We were a very close family, always a very close family. Close in the family was a prescription\nI\u2019m sure of my family, probably because it\u2019s a Jewish tradition but probably because they had\nsuffered losses. So, to my parents, the business was important to my father and he was a very good\nbusinessman, family was all that mattered, always. And to us it still does. Now we have fragments\nof the family but family is still very important to us, to all of us. So I was brought up with this, I\nwas suffocated by it, I really didn\u2019t like that much closeness. And with my colleagues who had\nmore space, and I always wanted more space. My whole traveling in my life was always getting\nmore space. These were the consequences of that emotional overcrowding, extremely so.",
        "A: By the way, yes. I wasn\u2019t involved politically until sometime later in my gymnasium years.\nYes, the Kolomyja, like most towns in Poland, had a lot of political divisions among the Jewish\npeople. There was the Main Zionist, and there were Left Zionist, the Communist, the Socialist, the\nLiberals, the Divisionists, you name it. Amazing, a small city like Kolomyja which only had 40,000\npeople, half of them were Jewish, they had about a few Jewish newspapers. It was a highly literate\ncity. I wasn\u2019t among them because my parents protection some how or other excluded me. My\nparents protection and my need for the Polish patriotism somehow excluded me much from it, as\nstrange as it is. But I had liberal ideas. My parents, my father worried about it, that I was going\nvery liberal at one point. But I didn\u2019t join a particular group. However, there were many, many\ngroups. Most of the Jewish people in Kolomyja as in most of Poland were poor. There were people\nwho were really poor and then there was the middle class, upper middle class, and a very few who\nwere really extremely rich. There must have been, but in my home town the middle class and upper\nmiddle class were the rich people. I remember, I still have a great pain when I think about the\npoverty in my home town. My first memory is of the water carriers. We lived in a house in which\nthe apartment was on top of the business and there were wide staircases. And the water carriers, all\nwhom were Jewish, they were carrying up the water, big cans, because there was no other way of\ngetting water. The water came from a main fountain in the city, on Mokra Street. Mokra Street is\nwell known because there are survivors like Dov Noi, who\u2019s well know, he comes from\nMokraStreet. Many people lived on MokraStreet. It was the poorest neighborhood and there was a\nbig fountain and the water carriers possibly were on the lowest rank of the Jewish community. And\nthey carried that water upstairs. I remember once, on a very cold day, and Kolomyja being in the\nUkraine, a cold, cold climate. I asked my mother, how come this man has ice on his hands?\nDoesn\u2019t he like to wear gloves? This was my awakening, that some people didn\u2019t have money for\ngloves. The poverty was everywhere and when I think of that poverty, I think of them like of the\nclosest family because there was no right for them to suffer such an end as these people did. They\nreally never had any life. There was a lot of stigma about being poor and there was a lot of\nsukkotme.\nIn my High School, which was a Jewish Gymnasium, it was one of the sets of gymnasiums, it was a\nchain of, called Zyowskie Towarzystowo szkoty Ludowei Sreduig, it was a chain of Jewish\nGymnasiums established in Poland, which was run by the Jewish parents, who established it. They\npaid for it, 1t was extremely expensive. Somehow or other, because there was no gymnasium for\nJewish girls after elementary school, ten parents got together and established it. My parents and\nnine others. And they took in one parent who didn\u2019t have money. Their name was Neiman and she\nwas Sophia Neiman. I still remember the pain and the stigma and the sense of sukkotme. She wore\nclothes which came from America, which means she had a coat which was red. Only American\nchildren wore red coat, we never wore red coat. In High School you wore navy. And this was such\na stigmatic thing. And another thing I remember is that outside was a school building, was an old\nJew who was selling some food, potatonik, and you could buy it with butter or with margarine.\nMargarine was half price of butter, and she would buy the margarine potato. All these things stay\nwith me because it was so unjust. Well, of the ten students, we were ten students and ten teachers.\nAll teachers were Jewish. They came from Warsaw, from the big cities. We had to be more pious\nthan the Pope in achieving our accreditation because the commission would come down from\nWarsaw and we had to be good. So we had ten teachers to ten students. And of the ten students,\nmiraculously, unbelievably, all survived! All the teachers were killed. I wanted to bring you\npictures, some how I couldn\u2019t get 1t down from my wall, it was heavy. But I be jumping a little bit.\nThis was the gymnasium years and it was all Jewish students, all Jewish teachers. It was considered\na high level gymnasium. It is described in the book about Poland by Dr. Sylvia Helliard, you may\nknow about it, called \u201cAn Air of Destruction\u201d. She has quite a bit about these schools.",
        "A: Well, she was not stigmatized by us, we just felt the stigma. I felt the stigma. For reason, I don\u2019t\nknow why, I still don\u2019t know why I identified with the underdog. Some way or other I assume it\neventually led me to social work, but I didn\u2019t know the origins of it.",
        "A: I lived by comparison, I\u2019m sure here in America it now would not be because of it, but by\ncomparison with the others, and I had a lot of pain about it. Probably was a part of my rebelling\nagainst my parents, whatever it was that came into it, that I became very liberal. The pain about\nwitnessing so much poverty still stays with me whenever I think about what happened. But\nanyway.. So, this was the gymnasium years, we had to study a lot. We had to study Latin, eight\nyears of Latin, that\u2019s a lot of Latin. We had to study, the only thing we didn\u2019t like is religion. Of\ncourse because the teacher wasn\u2019t great. I had marvelous teachers of Polish literature, one of them\nbecame my role model. I think she played an important part in my choice of this profession later.\nWe had a teacher of German literature, we had mathematics, which was not my subject somehow or\nother. But I couldn\u2019t afford to have a \u2018B\u2019 ever so my parents hired a tutor. I fell in love with the\ntutor, my first adolescent crush, and a learned it and I passed exams very well. Then we had a lot of\ngym. I wasn\u2019t great in gym, just passing. What else did we have? Certainly geography and history,\nhistory was always my great interest and remained so. Geography and history. In the University, I\nhad to decide, study was history. I believe that you don\u2019t understand people without history. In\nthose days, I didn\u2019t understand it but now I teach my students that you do not understand people\nwithout knowing history of their people. Well, we\u2019ll come to it later, but anyway, I consider it as\npart of the web of the personality, historic events. Those days I did not understand it this way, just\nliked history. Every single strut in the roadway, you know, I had to memorize. We had to, we had\nto decide a in High School and I was very good at it because I memorized Mickiewicz, Schen-\nkavitch (ph), Krasinski, these were the very famous, and later came the positivists and I was really,\nthis was my life! It still is, reading, I\u2019m still an addict in reading. I don\u2019t remember now because\nmy mind doesn\u2019t work well but in those days I absorbed it all.",
        "A: It was lit, oh sure, it was after the romantics who needed a pause! Orzeszkowa, Aun-jus-kov-a\n(ph). The other day, they had a few months ago, they had a film festival of Polish movies and there\nwas a marvelous, marvelous movie of Orzeszkowa, I forgot what it was, it was fantastically well\ndone, but the positivists. And then when I came to the, this was all in High School. It\u2019s amazing, I\ndidn\u2019t have any conflict with Poles at that point. I studied so many years in high school, we were\ntotally isolated. We didn\u2019t experience it.\nI didn\u2019t know, my father had some customers who were Polish, but I didn\u2019t have any contact. So,\nanti-Semitism was nothing that was experienced personally except that it wasn\u2019t it, but you knew it\nwas there.",
        "A: No. I knew that my father would bribe the tax accountants, when they came, the tax man. He\nwould send them fantastic sets of porcelain for Christmas, as I remember, because of our discussion\nwhat to choose for these people, so they were bribed. He would give some of them discounts, I\nknow, that later saved my life in strange ways. The Ukrainians were very poor. This was a Polish\nregime and Ukrainians were both illiterate and poor. They were peasants, they would come into\nstore barefoot, I remember that. And they would always buy dishes which were considered very\ninferior, fiance (ph), ceramic. They were painted. They would buy big dishes, painted, big dishes\nfor soup, or whatever else. But the fine porcelain was always for the Polish and for some of the\nJewish families too. But my father did more than this, handling the people from the city, but from\nall over they came. It was an established business for the Province. And the provincial peasants\nwere very, very many. So we got both the Ukrainian peasants would come in and the Polish people\nwere the aristocracy, in a way. And then there were Jewish people with money. This was the\nclientele and there were many helpers in the store and that\u2019s where I picked up Yiddish because they\nspoke Yiddish to a very large extent. We had a bookkeeper who survived the war, we had my\nbrother-in-law, my older sister\u2019s, her husband later joined and he had the presentation of chandeliers\nand enamel bath tubs.",
        "A: Bath tubs. Tubs for the bath. This was all new because there was no way of having any, water\ndidn\u2019t come into the apartment so you had to pour it, so the bath tubs we had for that luxury of\ntaking a bath. And he was doing very well this way but it was part of the business. So that\u2019s where,\nYiddish you could hear in the store, they spoke Yiddish, these boys. One of them survived, I met\nhim after the war, I couldn\u2019t believe it, but, the rest were all killed. I remember seeing them over\nthe, over in the ghetto.\nBut, I, so I was sort of isolated or protected from actual confrontation with anti-Semitism, but as I\nsaid, it was always in the air. For instance, on Yom Kipper my parents would go to synagogue,\nnaturally, we girls stayed home. And we always barricaded ourselves. We were afraid always to\nstand in the window or on the balcony, the balcony was a big part of our life. We lived on the main\nstreet called Kol-soy-o1 (ph), you could see people walk back and forth and my mother was very\norientated towards clothes, she was critical of this, this dress is too long and this is too short and this\nis too bright and so on, but on Yom Kipper night, some of these nights it was forbidden for us to\nshow our faces, this I remembered. We worried, although we never experienced it, that some of the\nPolish or Ukrainian goons will come and knock out windows so there was this sense of panic all the\ntime. In our town there were so many Jews, half of the population was Jewish. You could see the\ndifference. Suddenly it was very dark, it was very quiet, all the stores were closed, most stores\nbelonged to the Jews. No body moved, nothing moved. And then you always thought, somebody\nwill come, knock at the door, knock out the window, it happened occasionally but I myself did not\nexperience this. But I do recall the feeling of some anxiety, perhaps even panic, that it might\nhappen. So I say, I knew about it, but not in a personal way. Yom Kipper was very difficult, we all\npassed it, I didn\u2019t after a certain age, but Yom Kipper I remember as it was dark in the apartment.\nThere was a very severe fast. The breaking of the fast, people were very tired or slowly coming out\nof synagogues, they were praying all day there. This I remember with a great deal of pain. The\nKlezmar would come, to pray for us, a happy, ah, these people were very poor. These are older\nJews. Very poor, and they would go from house to house. It was my job, because I was the\nyoungest at home, I didn\u2019t go to synagogue and because I was there while my parents had to come\nfrom the synagogue, to give them some food to break the fast. I remember as a child carrying that\ntray of honey cake. And they would pray, they would pray and then they would go, sometimes they\ncame back later at dinner time. I still mourn these Klezmar because they were so poor. It was so\nwrong that a night like that, after fast, they had to go and pray. The Klas-mas(ph) music has not\nsurvived, the type of pain when I hear, it\u2019s not good, it\u2019s not authentic enough for me.\nI must be honest, there\u2019s very few people who remember how it was. They played in short sleeved\noutfits, I can\u2019t even, Perlman plays. He\u2019s doing it well I suppose but he\u2019s not good enough for me\nbecause I remember the authentic players. Who could teach these young people here, they all went\nto the ovens. This is the story of the Klezmar in our home town, they always played at weddings,\nthe weddings for my family were very big, and none of them survived from what I know. Anyway,\nit was not right that people who have suffered so much poverty and so much indignity should ever\nhave to end up this way. It wasn\u2019t fair. But in our home town, this was the story, this was true for\nmany of the other little towns too, all over Poland, particularly in these places. So, this was Yom\nKipper, my parents would come home, always with headaches, tired, but breaking the fast was\nunlike here where you often have loks or these things, or there has to be hot chicken soup and the\nKlezmar would come back to play and then they ate with us a little, but it was a difficult, a very\ndifficult holiday for us. There was no joy at all. Then came Sukkot and Sukkot I remember very\nvividly because the Sukkot(ph) in our home was big. The entry to the apartment was a very big\nhallway and it didn\u2019t have windows but it had ceiling window, there was a name for it? When\nthere\u2019s a windows in the ceiling, you know what I mean?",
        "A: Sky light. There was a very big room with a sky light and actually two of the other rooms, one\nwas a children\u2019s room, also had a sky light. Anyway, the sky light in the foyer, the very big foyer\nwas removed for Sukkot and branches of trees, 1t was covered with tree branches because Sukkot is\na special holiday. My father would being in many people from the synagogue and they danced,\neverybody! By the way, every Sukkotbot, I had to bring an Oye Nak-a-dom (ph) home and Oye\n(ph) was a guest from the synagogue. There wasn\u2019t a time that there wouldn\u2019t come an Oye (ph),\nmy father had to bring an Oye (ph). Somebody who was poor, who was stranded in the city and\nneeded a meal. A shabbat meal. Once my father came without an Oye (ph) and I remember how\nupset my mother was and he had, poor man, he had to go back to the synagogue and find an Oye\n(ph). There were always some poor people stranded. One Oye (ph) Ill never forget. It must have\nbeen 1938 by then because he told us that he came from Zbaszyn. Zbaszyn was a place, you know\nabout it, to which the Polish Jews were thrown by the Germans and he somehow or other, he\nwandered and wandered around, he came to Kolomyja, a long way from Zbonsheen, which was on\nthe Zbaszyn border and he began to tell us a little bit about what happened.\nBut I think it was hushed over in some way, at least I don\u2019t remember details. I remember that Oye\n(ph). Another steady one, every Sukkot-bot (ph) was the matchmaker in town. My sisters got\nmarried by matchmaker, through a matchmaker. The matchmaker, he was treated very well, but he\nalways said, he\u2019s not going to eat, he just came for Kiddish. But, to eat you had to wash your hands\nso he refused to wash his hands because he only came for Kiddish. So the Kiddish was a lot of\nappetizers, three or four appetizers, and a lot of sweets and he was not eating, but he came, every\nSukkot-bot (ph) he came because my father had daughters to marry off. And he knew there would\nbe money there so all my sisters married and when it came to me, he looked me\nover. The coming of age, he noticed my body, that it was getting ready for marriage. He started\nlooking at me more seriously, but I escaped him. So I never married through a matchmaker, I\nmarried my husband, very independent wife. But the matchmaker was at our shabbat table every\nSaturday without eating. I always laughed because he ate about three appetizers you know. The\nJewish food was gefilte fish and it was pitch\u00e9 and it was something else, chopped liver, three, four\nappetizers and he ate all of them without washing his hands, which means he didn\u2019t eat. We all\nlaugh about it, we still remember the shabbat and they all went into the ovens. But, this was part of\nmy childhood which I resisted to a large extent because I wanted to be very Polish to him. Without\nbeing with Poles. Had a very mixed up mixture, but go ahead.",
        "A: Yes. My Polish is fine. I lost the accent and I must have made some sort of silent determination\nthat I\u2019m going to beat them at it. My Polish saved my life in some ways, in some places, some\noccasions when somebody looked suspiciously at me and I knew he was suspecting because I look\nJewish, I would open my mouth, which helped occasionally because I spoke very good Polish.\nNow my Polish ain\u2019t so good. But my German is better now, amazingly so. Yes.",
        "A: 1936 I entered University again.",
        "A: No, not at all. Very few, there was no gymnasium for Jewish women, there was only the\ngymnasium with the nuns, the Ursulanki nuns ran a Catholic, high school for Catholic girls and all\nPolish girls were Catholic.\nSo there was nothing for me but that when my parents together with nine others created the\ngymnasium. I came to the University, I certainly wanted to go to University and I wanted to study\nPolish literature, there was no question about what I wanted to study. I was the youngest at home,\nthe only one at home. My sisters were married by then. And lived away. So for them, the lose of\ntheir mezunka, the youngest is the mezunka, usually the favorite child in many Jewish families, but\nwith me it was doubly so. They were extremely unhappy about it, they wouldn\u2019t hear about it.\nWell, how could I make my parents hear me this way? I went on a hunger strike. For my parents, a\nchild wouldn\u2019t eat, was the greatest tragedy. They could not stand my, they couldn\u2019t stand the\nseparation from me, I suppose. They worried about a girl going away to a big city, what will\nhappen to her? They worried about kashrut, where will I eat there? And they worried about\nthemselves, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sure they couldn\u2019t face each other all alone. All the sisters were gone\nand they were still young people but they felt as if they felt old. So my father made a decision to go\nto his Rabbi. At that time the Rabbi didn\u2019t come to us anymore. He was old and he didn\u2019t travel, I\nsuppose. He lived some where near Sigit, somewhere very far, it was Romania at that point. And to\ngo to Romania from Poland you needed passports by then, you needed visas, you needed foreign\ncurrency, it was both the Polish government and the Romanian government made it very difficult.\nBut my father found a way and he went to the Rabbi. To consult with him, what to do about this\nstubborn, little daughter. So the Rabbi, in his wisdom, I doubt if his experience was questioned, he\nsaid, if she is as smart as a boy, you treat her as if she were a boy, send her to study. Father came\nback and I went to study. And that is the story on how I went to study. My parents outfitted me and\nI was always outfitted for every occasion, and I went to live off and they made arrangements with a\ndistant relative to house me. She was in Boughf, Lemberg. She was married to a man who didn\u2019t\nmake a living, the name was Fisch, so there was hidden poverty, a little hidden poverty. I had a\nsmall room there, kept extremely well for me. The woman worked very hard, again, I had a lot of\npain because she treated me exceptionally. I had to have the best meat and the best food and they\nskimped and it was very painful for me to look at all these things. But that\u2019s how it was and she\nwas getting 100 zlotys a month, which in those days was much money, and the whole family lived\noff it. There was one daughter, a little younger than I. So this was what they lived off.\nThe first day, I get outfitted, my new outfit, and I go to the University and I\u2019m small and I look very\nyoung. I look much younger than my seventeen and a half years, I looked a little childish in a way.",
        "A: Seventeen and a half. Close to eighteen, in fact, when the Rabbi, when he married me later he\nwondered whether my father was telling my age, I looked so young. But, I come to the University,\nit looked so big. It looked so tremendous and here in front of the big door stand two Polish goons\nand Endeki, Polish Fascists. And there are big posters in front of the door saying, this is a week\nwithout Jews. This, as I remember, is October, 1936. A week without Jews, I don\u2019t understand\nwhat they\u2019re talking about, so I\u2019m trying to get through and I see they\u2019re hostile faces. Anyway, I\ncame to my classroom and I recall they wanted me to sit down on the left benches. The classrooms\nwere very big, at least to the eyes of the young girl from a small town, and they arranged that all\nPolish students were to sit on the right side and the Jewish students were to take the ghetto benches,\nthe left side. Before I went to them, I already had some information from the Jewish-Polish society\nof students, and they told me about it, and they told me Jewish students will not take the left\nbenches, the ghetto benches, but we will stand. So I looked for the Jewish students, there was no\nbody else, I was the only Jewish student. And to the right side were about, 200 perhaps, Polish\nstudents and I\u2019m the little thing standing at the door. To cut it short, for the next three years, I stood\nat that door. I took all my University classes in the standing position. I never sat down. It was\ngetting worse every day. There were weeks without Jews, there were special treatment of Jews.\nThe professors were unbelievably anti-semetic. The professors stood and they could see around,\nthey were a little high on the podium, and it was a requirement of each student to hand over the\nindexes, it was a little book in which you would put a signature that you had attended classes, we\nhad to have that to attend every class in Polish literature. And as I put, and he would pause at the\nend of the session, he would put his signature. One of them, Professor Tasycki, he was the expert in\nthe Polish language, not literature, but language for say, phonics. He saw my name, Matylda\nHirsch, he took a look, he threw it at the floor.\nAnd the students applauded. I don\u2019t know what made me go back. I just don\u2019t know. It was sheer\nanger, I suppose. Or sheer sukkotme of going home without finishing it. I was so defenseless. I\nwas in such a fright. Everyday, I would literally vomit with anxiety, of entering that University. At\none point, they pushed me and they pushed me down and something I held on that I didn\u2019t break my\nbody. One point I remember, a highlight in my University studies. Professor Julius Kleiner, may\nhis memory be blessed. The saying was that he was half Jewish, a quarter Jewish, one-eighth\nJewish, whatever 1t was. He was a very famous professor, an expert on the famous poet, Julius\nSlowacki. His name was Julius Kleiner, and it was the same, Julius and Julius. He introduced us to\nsome understanding of the influence of Freud on literature. To me, it was all very new. But he was\nextremely prestigious lecturer of Polish literature, particularly about Slowacki. And he saw me,\nevery time, standing at the doorway, all alone, as I was very insignificant little looking, very small.\nOne day, he moves from his katedra, all the way down to the doorway, I thought he was walking\nout, he takes me under his arm, he brings me up to the podium and he asked me to take the chair.\nWell! I refused to take the chair. I just stood, he finished his lecture, as he walked down, the\nstudents threw eggs at him. Lucky they didn\u2019t throw stones. Many times, they carried stones. Most\nof the time, by the way, he was later killed, I believe, but I have lost contact. The Endecki would\ntake, would carry sticks, what do you call it? Sticks? With a Gillette at the bottom of it.",
        "A: A razor, yes. And they would always try to hurt some Jewish student. Once he killed one. This\nwas a friend of my husband\u2019s, came later. Well, these were the days, I would get home extremely\ndepressed. Would study in this extremely small room, which they kept very clean, special for me. I\nwould study, my mind was everywhere else, but I still had all these papers, sometimes were very\ngood. We had a professor of Polish phonetics, this was a woman, she was a docent, a docent meant\nan associate professor, docent to Professor Taszcki, so she didn\u2019t have as much power as he but she\nwas a miserable creature, she looked like a monkey. She was horrible in every way and she focused\non me. And she focused on my podzigbienie.\nwhich means, old church Slavonic. The old church Slavonic, she wanted to test it in some way and\nshe made experiments. Only years later did I realize that these were experiments taken out of racial\nbooks, but I wasn\u2019t aware of it. She put powder on our, what do you call that part? Of the most\npodzigbienie, I\u2019m saying it in Polish, podzigbienie, and she would have us pronounce vocals. And\nshe wanted to study it and photograph, all were experiments, which I couldn\u2019t understand, but she\nwanted to tell us how we pronounce this vowel, how we pronounce, what is the other, the\nconsonant. This was all taken of Nazi books, which occurred to me only many years later. This\nwas Professor Dluga was her name. Terrible creature! And who does she play with? The one\nJewish student, that was me.\nTape II",
        "A: It was four years, but the fourth year the Russians were there and the University has changed\ntotally by then.",
        "A: I did not throw up everyday but I felt nauseous and I threw up occasionally, but the nausea was\npart of the anxiety. I felt some sense of resistance, that I cannot leave. The Jewish organization\nhelped us to a large extent because I knew this was happening to other students too. The thing that\nmobilized my anger rather than my anxiety was a funeral of a student in the medical studies. He\nwas literally killed in the classroom. His name just escapes me, I wish I could remember, but he\nwas a close friend of a man who later became my husband. This was a tremendous funeral,\nsomewhere or other, I felt this solidarity of people and I wasn\u2019t alone. It was very unfortunate that\nin the study of Polish literature I was the only Jew and that feeling of isolation was the worst part of\nall of it. But then, I suddenly found myself in that procession of hundreds of students and I got this\nsense of strength from the numbers. But it was extremely difficult and I always prayed that the\nclass be over and vacation come, each time there was a holiday, naturally I would go home. My\nparents were overjoyed in seeing me, I never told them the story of what was going on. I recall,\nthey would bring back the big, big pots and pans when I came because for themselves, they were on\ndiets, and the cooking was very limited, so when I came there were again celebrations. There was\nsome joy in the house again. I think it was in my, let me see, it was in my third year of studies,\nsecond or third, I can\u2019t remember, that I went to the library to pick up a Polish book and the\nlibrarian told me that the book was just checked out. I said, who took it? She said, this man, this\nyoung student. I walk over to the student and I say, I need this book. He says, he wants to read it\ntoo. And I said, are you a student of Polish literature? He say, no, he studies pharmacology, the\nmedical school. So I said, but I\u2019m a student of Polish literature and I need the book for an exam.\nHe says, well, you're quite stubborn about it. I say, yes, please help me with it. We started talking.\nHe was from my home town, I never knew him, but I knew of his parents because people knew of\nthe businesses.\nHis parents had a apotheketer (ph), pharmacy and everybody knew the pharmacy and I did. So he\nwas one of their sons, the youngest son. Well, arguing over the book, we became lovers. And this\nchanged my life immediately. I wasn\u2019t alone. Nunek and I were going home, at least for vacations,\nmy father was very unhappy when I declared I wanted to marry him. Because his family, unlike my\nown, was extremely assimilated to the extent that I think they would eat on Yom Kippur, which was\nunusual. They carried it to an extreme. His father was for generations, they had that pharmacy.\nThey prided themselves in being extremely assimilated Jews. Well again, in my _ usual\nstubbornness, my parents had to give in, so my father remembered that as a very young child, he\nwent to the chedet together with this man who had a few classes there, so they patched it up in some\nway and they came and there was an engagement. It was 1938 or 1939. We became engaged and\nmy life naturally changed because I wasn\u2019t alone, he was just about to finish his study, I had another\ntwo years to go. That summer..",
        "A: I met him, I think 1t was 1938, two years after.",
        "A: My first boyfriend. Well, I had some boyfriends before. My first crush was on the teacher, then\nI had a boy that, my parents arranged for me to meet boys in their house, which means dancing, so it\nwas always chaperoned. And I remember a crush on a young man who was later killed. And this\nwas my first crush, but my first intimate relationship was this boy, my fiancee, Nunek Najder. It\nwasn\u2019t engaged really, we started living together in a way, yes.",
        "A: He loved Polish literature and yet he was in a different profession, so definitely yes, he was very\nassimilated and I always struggled with this thing, you know? We had a lot in common because of\nPolish literature. And we belonged to the Jewish Student Association, life changed. I wasn\u2019t alone.\nAnd I think, my later years, being alone was a real tragedy. When I was hiding, later. But, Nunek\nwas extremely affectionate with me, extremely devoted to me. We just seemed to be the right kind\nof a couple, both young, he was two years older than I. We would go home for vacations and there\nwere always celebrations about it.\nOne day, for a long vacation one summer we decided to go into the wild mountains. I was very\nmuch into hiking. Until a few years ago I was into it. And he too. This was the major sport for\nmany young, Jewish people. He didn\u2019t belong to an organization, he was the assimilated sort of\ncategory of Jews. But when he saw what was happening in the University, he became extremely\nangry at those Poles. But one day we decided to go to a new, brand new hostel on one of the\nhighest mountains on the Carpatian Mountains, this was called the Chomiak. It was just discovered\nrecently and they built a hostel there. Hard to get there, after a point we were able to go by a car,\nlater had the march and was very far away. It was brand new, it smelled delicious I remember, there\nwas one more couple from Warsaw, Polish people. And I recall the distance we had from them and,\nwe were the only four people, very far away. No body could get there. I do recall that they had a\nsort of sense of superiority over us. They knew immediately that we were Jewish, although I looked\nJewish, my husband never did and he spoke Polish beautifully. He came from a family of long, of\nlong history of assimilated Jews. But somehow or the other, they sensed it. So although we ate\ntogether, there was a sense of distance and there was our sense of looking up at them. This I still\nremember. Well, it was a great experience, to be all alone in this stunning part of the mountains,\nthis 1s above Bor-auk-na (ph), Bor-auk-na (ph) was a village and from there we went to the\nChomiak. Later on, Chomiak became a popular place. When the vacation was over, it was the Ist\nof September, 1939. Vacation was over, we went back to the village to take the train to Kolomyyja.\nIt was a Sunday afternoon, we saw many, no, don\u2019t remember why I think it was a Sunday, I\nthought it was Sunday because many Ukrainian peasants were trying to read posters. When we\ncame to the posters, it was a Declaration of War. That Germany has just declared war on Poland. It\nwas September Ist, 1939. Shows you how totally unprepared we were for it. People lived in\nWarsaw, not the cities, knew much more. We seemed to have been totally isolated from it,\nparticularly when we were up in the mountains there for many weeks.",
        "A: We knew a little, what was going on in Germany, it was Nazi Germany. We didn\u2019t know how\nmuch impact they had on our, on Polish students.\nActually, when I later studied it, the tactics of the Polish students were cut out of text books from\nthe Nazi literature. We didn\u2019t know enough. When you lived in the western part of Poland you\ncertainly knew more about it. You didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t, and my husband didn\u2019t know either. But I recall\nthat day, later in the afternoon, I don\u2019t know why I think it was Sunday, the only reason that I think\nso is that when peasants just be all together in the center of the square. We read this, we didn\u2019t\nreally realize the importance of it. We were Polish patriots, strangely enough. Both of us had\nmilitary preparation, I had it in my high school days. All boys and all girls had to have military\npreparation. Which meant we were taught how to wear uniforms, how to march. He had to be\ntaught, I\u2019m sure, how to shoot. I wasn\u2019t, but to march in parades and to march in case of a war. We\nknew all these things, there was, forgot the name, Polskin, gosh how could I remember, forget these\nnames, anyway it was war preparation, that every high school student had to participate in. We took\nthe train and we thought perhaps we\u2019ll go into the war, perhaps we\u2019ll march, we just didn\u2019t\nunderstand any of it. When I came home I saw the gloom on my parents face, they knew more.\nThey had participated in World War I and they knew that war is not only songs and marches. This\nwas September Ist, 1939. Within weeks, the Russian army moved in. I didn\u2019t know then, but there\nwas a pact between Ribintrope (ph) and Molotov (ph) and they declared that Poland should be\ndivided. Our part of Poland fell to the Soviets. This was within two or three weeks that the Soviet\narmy marched in. I remember the night when they marched in. It was very, what was the word for\nit? The song sounded very attractive, it was mesmerizing. They were marching and their songs\nwere beautiful, I still remember their songs. And I was very much pulled somewhat or other, I\nalways was liberal, I was always poor. Many of their ideas, 1t seemed that, they were bring some\nemployment and dignity to the poor people. But, on the other hand, I could see from my parents\nexpression that they were worried and we didn\u2019t know what the future would be, so it was strong. I\nremember distinctly that night when they marched in and I recall the song, they sang these songs,\nfor some reason. Well, we went back to Lvov to study. My husband was just finished then, I think.",
        "A: Gosh, [singing], oh, I can\u2019t remember anymore. If tomorrow is war, we will defend Stalin and\neverywhere we will be the victors. So, it had a mesmerizing quality for some reason because I was\nin conflict. But I did go back to finish my studies. The University was totally different by then. By\nthe way, I was married by, this was 1940, I was just married by then. Well, come back to my\nwedding for a minute, it was already a very quiet wedding. I never wanted a wedding in a white\ngown, I was a very feminist kind of a woman, liberal kind of a women. I was not interested in all\nthese trappings of the bourgeoisie, which was very much the bad and good part of my background,\nmainly through my mother.\nSo I always dreamed that I'll just escape with my husband or I\u2019Il have a very small wedding, but\nanyway when the time came it was, the Soviets had just come in at that point and I was married, I\ncan\u2019t remember the month which 1s insane, but I know it was 1940. It was the year when I was just\nabout to graduate. The Rabbi of our town was a close friend of my father, Rabbi Lowe (ph). His\nnephew is the chief Rabbi of Israel now. The other nephew was chief counsel of Israel for New\nYork, the United States, I knew both of them, I met them later. But that Rabbi questioned my\nfather, he said, you say she\u2019s of age to marry? She looks like a child. I just happened to look very\nyoung. So the outfit for my wedding was a nice little navy suit and flat-heel shoes and a little veil, I\nthink. The wedding was in our own apartment in our parents home. There were hardly any guests,\nthe Soviets had just come 1n and the business was already taken over by the Soviets. My father kept\nsaying that he cannot give me much a dowry because of the war, because the Soviets have taken\nover everything, but after the war he will re1mburse me for it, Pll get more dowry than any of the\nother girls, and all the girls got good dowries. And I didn\u2019t think of a dowry at all, to me this was all\nvery uninteresting. All I remember that, the day of the wedding, later we took the train and went\nback to study and, in Re-volf (ph), and sitting on the train I wore that wedding band and he did too\nand a Polish woman sits there across from us, she says, these days children have such a way of\nlying. You wear wedding bands, you're both children! He looked very young too, strange as it all\nsounds now. But we finished our studies and the University was a totally different institutions. The\nSoviets have changed it totally. While anti-Semitism was somewhat there, it certainly was there, it\nwas not official but there are no more Jewish students in my department. I mean, there was no\nquestion in what I mixed with others. What I recall was extremely cold winter of 1940. The\nSoviets suddenly did not have any steam anymore, everything was just taken away, including the\nsteam, how they managed that I don\u2019t know. But whatever they could put their eyes on was taken\nback to Russia. I recall going to the opera house, we were involved in opera, and seeing the Russian\nladies in nightgowns because they thought these were evening gowns, and I recall in our, when they\ntook our store they removed everything so my father still removed some dishes for bartering later\nwhich helped us for a long time. The Soviets nationalized the store, actually local people who\nbecame communist, who were communist, but now became very important officials, they came to\nhelp the Soviet soldiers to nationalize the store. For my father it was a terrible tragedy because to\nhim the business was his life to a very large extent and suddenly he was without anything. The\nsame happened to my father-in-law, his was also nationalized by the Soviets. To these\npeople, they suddenly became old, and they were really not older at that point but everything was\ntaken away from them, they felt. So, the study was very different. I had my final exams, they had\nto be in the Russian language. We all had to study from the green book, I remember under my arm,\nand every student had it under their arm, every University student has this green book. Very cheap\npaper in green cover, it was called the korr-up-tik qual for Bolshovitski Party (ph), which means\nThe Short Course of the Bolshevik Party and was full of propaganda which I didn\u2019t realize at that\ntime that it was propaganda, but it was about Stalin and it was about the Revolution. One chapter I\nliked very much was the Marxist dialectic philosophy, it was very well written. It seemed to have\nsome, no, actually the Hagalien (ph) dialectic philosophy, it made sense. It had some large\nexpressions to be a lot of propaganda. But we had to study every page and every word of it and the\nfinal exam, when they examined me in Polish literature, I had to talk in Russian. I mastered the\nlanguage very quickly. I forgot 1t very quickly too, you know I hardly know any. But this was a\nyear in Re-volf (ph), the final year. I was a newly wedded woman, my parents were depressed over\nwhat happened, what was going on, they were forever feared that they may be deported, that the\nRussians would deport them. At one point, they actually would go home from time to time, at one\npoint they came to take my parents away. They always did it in the middle of the night. They were\nclassified as bourgeois and this was a very bad certification and, in the middle of the night they\ncame always with their rifles, rifling at the door. We always were afraid. And they took them to the\nrailway station to take them to Siberia. I recall I was home at that point and my sisters was home at\nthat point, and we ran to the railway station. It was a lot of bribes to get them back home. I wish we\ndidn\u2019t, but that\u2019s what happened. The bribes were always vodka and chof-socks (ph). Chof-socks\n(ph) were watches, they loved watches. The Soviets had absolutely nothing, it\u2019s unbelievable, how\nthey took everything, taken back to Russia. For the first time they saw goods, which they haven\u2019t\nseen. We didn\u2019t realize how the revolution had changed life there in those politics in poverty,\nunless among the highest officials, I suppose. So, they always ordered leather coats and when they\nordered leather coats, they had to be to the floor because they figured when they go back and the\nwinter is cold, they will cut and make a pair of boots, this was . So, chof-socks (ph)\nand leather coats and our fine porcelain, all of it went somewhere with the Russian families\neventually back to Russia. This was the Soviets, but I finished school and then they didn\u2019t permit\nme to live in Re-volf (ph), didn\u2019t permit me or my husband, because we were categorize as\nbourgeois. And the Soviet law was that if you were in this category, you weren\u2019t quite an animal in\nSocialism but you were somewhere not to be trusted so you had to live fifty miles away from a large\ncity. Everybody wanted to live in a large city, so they punished us. Instead of taking us to Siberia\nlike they wanted to take my parents, who were considered useless, they figured two young people,\nthese professionals, will be useful. So the law was that you had to move fifty miles away from Re-\nvolf (ph) and there were these centers. They had a very bright idea, good idea, is to open up\nhospitals and pharmacies in the villages of the Polish Ukraine, which had nothing. There was never\na school there, never a hospital, never a pharmacy, and the Soviets had a network of these things,\nvery smart, the Poles never give them any credit for it. But they did, so they opened up a hospital in\na place called Glen-na-novaria (ph). You never heard of it, I never heard of it. It was a real loss, it\nwas a village in where there was no sidewalk. When a train, your shoe got stuck right in the mud.\nIt had a name, mud was a part of the name, so this is where they sent us to work. My husband, they\nwanted to open a pharmacy, how did they open a pharmacy? They took from the Russian church,\nfrom the parochial house, they took the house and they opened a pharmacy. My husband opened\nthe pharmacy and me, they wanted to teach in school and, because I wasn\u2019t prepared to teach young\nchildren, I was prepared to teach at gymnasium, I had a Masters Degree by then, my gis-trof-o-\nsovisia (ph) which was a high Degree. So I was not versed in high school or anything, so they said I\ncould be an assistant to my husband. I learned how to make ca-go-cheekie (ph), was a little\nmedication against headaches. And I would wrap it. Very often at night we heard them, heard the\nSoviet soldiers knock at the door with the rifle. Each time we were prepared they would take us to\nSiberia. What they wanted were condoms. In the middle of the night, they would rifle at the door\nfor condoms. This was 1940. I thought we were lucky to have jobs, we had enough food. There\nwere three Jewish families, us, a Jewish doctor from Germany who was somehow or other came\nthere and opened a hospital, it was all public works, and a Jewish teacher from Ha-riza (ph). That\u2019s\nwhere all your Ukrainian peasants, everybody was illiterate there, absolutely illiterate. So the three\nof us, sometimes they played cards, I was reading books always, but anyway, one day we went to\nvacation and my father, you know, was so desperate about once more to stand behind a pharmacy\ncounter. Once more to be an upper taker. So with a great deal of difficulty, we arranged for him to\ncome to our place in Glen-na-novaria (ph) for two weeks vacation and we would go to their home in\nKolomyja. It took us a lot of work to arrange that exchange. Well, it happened. We went there,\nhome, we stayed in their home for two weeks and my father and mother-in-law went to our little\nplace and took over the pharmacy to the greatest joy for this old man. And we were suppose to,\nafter two weeks vacations we were suppose to go back. And it was the 21st of June, 1941, and you\nknow the rest of the story. We didn\u2019t expect any of it. We said good-bye to my parents, we had\nrailway tickets to go the next day back to Re-volf (ph) and from there by horse and carriage to go to\nGlen-na-novaria (ph) and, in the middle of the night, I hear a lot of noise. I look out of the window,\nit was one in the morning, I see Soviet women and children being put on trucks. I woke my\nhusband, I say, they must be going to summer camps. But it seemed to be so noisy and so many\ntrucks, middle of the night. I opened the radio and here Hitler\u2019s voice comes across. Today I\ndeclared war on Bolshevism and the Jews. And I knew things were very bad. The first thing in the\nmorning, we ran to the railway station to get to that place. The trains did not run anymore. Nothing\nfor civilians. We were stuck in Kolomyyja, his parents were stuck in that little hole. Two weeks\nlater we got a card, they were both shot. The Germans walked into the pharmacy, they were\nrenounced as Jews and they were shot. This was the end of my husband\u2019s parents. We were stuck\nin Kolomyja and first the Hungarians came to cover our city. I remember them wearing these very\nhigh hats with feathers. They didn\u2019t do much harm at that point yet. Somehow or other I recall a\ntruck of children, a truck with children. I had no idea who these children were, but the children, the\ntruck was covered but you could hear cries. We were living then at the home of my parents and I\nremember my father said to me and my sister, my sister had run away from Nova-som (ph), from\nthe western part where the Germans had been already for two years, she came to our home town.\nAnd the Russians first were looking for her to send her to Siberia but anyway she got out of it and\nthe Hungarians were there and my father said, bring the children a little hot water, it was a cold day.\nSo we run with a china of hot water and we hear the whimper of the children and suddenly shots\ncome. They were directed at us, at my sister and myself. I remember we threw this hot water, the\nchina, on the sidewalk. This was my first confrontation with real terror. But the Hungarians by and\nway were pretty innocent at the beginning, a least we didn\u2019t know. Within a few weeks, the\nGermans marched in. And now I know from history but those days I didn\u2019t know that right in the\nback of the soldiers came the SS. They always were out and we didn\u2019t know the difference between\nan SS and a soldier and everything has been blamed on the SS but I now know that the soldiers were\nindistinguisukkotble from the SS because they participated as much. But anyway, everyday there\nwas a new directive, a new poster. Today the Jews have to register and tonight the Jews have to\nobserve curfew, and then Jews had to deliver all the gold and silver and then Jews have to deliver all\nthe fur coats. And I remember standing in a long, long line on a very cold day, shivering and\ndelivering fur coats. When I got married my parents bartered some of their porcelain things with a\nfurrier who made two fur coats for me, not one but two, during the last year of my studies. It helped\nimmensely because the University was so cold and I recall taking classes everyday bundled up in\nthat fur coat. Anyway, with these two fur coats I stood in line, we all stood in line to deliver to the\nGermans. And I recall coming to the window, the German official, and he would register my name\nand address and the fur coat, the length of the fur coat, what it was made of. One was a tweed lined\nwith beaver, the other was a sealskin coat, and he gave me a receipt of it and I figured, well, if after\nthe Winter passes I\u2019Il get it back, whatever. My ivory tables endless. And then came the ax-e-on-a\n(ph), the activists. All these names, we didn\u2019t know, we called them ax-e-on-a (ph) because the\nGermans called it ax-e-on-a (ph). The raids. There was not a ghetto yet. I remember in the\nbeginning, one of the raids was suddenly we saw people being dragged with ropes around their\nbodies. This was the action against the intellectuals, the doctors. We knew the Jewish doctor so\nwell. This was a diversion, when sometime in 1940 when the Soviets were there, I was an assured\nvacation, Passover vacation at home. We were married then and my husband left at 6:00 in the\nmorning I was suppose to take a later train, I do not remember why. I leaned out of the window,\nthis was 1940 in Kolomyja and it was a sukkotrp, cool morning and I felt a terrible pain in my\nbreast, in my lungs, my chest. And within a few hours, the doctors were there and they told me I\nhave pneumonia, double pneumonia. In those days there was no treatment for pneumonia. My\nhusband came back immediately, my father-in-law who still knew a lot about ;\nanyway, they got together. Sulfur was a way of treatment, but the medical knowledge at that point\nwas if you lived seven days, I was pretty much unconscious with an extremely high fever, if you\nlived seven days, if you lived through the seven days you survive, otherwise you die at the seventh\nday. So they put cups, what they called cups, glass cups on my chest, which I hated, but worse, they\nbrought leeches. And the leeches were always used medicinally by a barber, I don\u2019t know why.\nThe barber has a jar of leeches. I can\u2019t remember, half conscious as I was, I kept sukkotking my\nhead, I don\u2019t want leeches but he put leeches. And whether the hot cups or the leeches or my\nfather\u2019s prayers, whichever it was I woke up saying, I\u2019m hungry, and this was the end of my\npneumonia. Almost the whole town was involved in my pneumonia. The three doctors were day\nand night and at my bed. Their names I do remember, Dr. Tye-sukkot (ph), Dr. Fry-gar (ph) and\nDr. Fleish (ph), all three of them. When I got well, and I recovered pretty quickly I was young, and\nmy mother took good care of me, I recovered, they insisted that the town should see me. They took\na fee-ak-a (ph), and-drosh-kind (ph) and a pair of horses and here were the three doctors with me\nand we traveled across the city so everybody knew I was truly alive. In those days, you didn\u2019t pick\nup a phone [to call anyone]. because I would like the names of these doctors to be\nremembered somehow or another, they were all killed. Dr. Fleish\u2019s (ph) daughter went to school\nwith me, gymnasium, is still alive in Stockholm. So coming back to the German times, this I\nremember, famous doctors were in that aux-own-der (ph) being dragged. We didn\u2019t know where\npeople were being dragged, there were all kinds of rumors. Later we found they went, dragged\noutside of town to a forest called Sukkotp-a-roth-sa (ph) and they were shot there. They had\nmachine guns there. There were all kinds of rumors that they went somewhere but somewhere or\nother it began to bother us that perhaps really the rumors that they were killed were true. We didn\u2019t\nquite want to believe it. Every few weeks there was another action. One a very sad one was a moc-\nrow-seat (ph), a very poor neighborhood where they dragged out all the Jews and for some reason\nthey focused on them and then there were, food was already beginning to be rationed, there was\nlittle food. And in 1942, it was Passover, 1942, when the posters on the wall announced that all\nJews have to go to the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I lived with, we stayed with my parents. We occasionally stayed with his parents when the\nGermans came in. But we mainly stayed with my parents. My oldest sister, was also,\nshe had her own apartment, she and her husband and Menek lived there. We stayed with my\nparents at a big place. Occasionally we stayed with the Knight-ess (ph). This was the beginning\nwhen the Germans came and, go ahead.",
        "A: Yes, we were very, very worried. We could see what was going on. We began to, well, we\nnever saw that all be killed, this was very hard. Some of us would disappear, we thought, the way\nthey did. People talked about the fact that these Jews were taken to the Ukraine, to the west-eastern\npart of the Ukraine to work on farms and we latched on to these stories, we really wanted to believe\nthat. Under no circumstances did we think that it would lead to gas chambers. We had no idea,\nwhen you read the memos today and they said, we knew they were going to Treblinka, they knew\nthey were going, we didn\u2019t know where they were going, it was a fact. But there were massive raids\non people. And sometimes there was shooting right in front of us so we knew that things were\nterribly bad. And there was beginning to be massive starvation. People were going hungry, but\nthere was always somebody who disappeared. You heard somebody, a cousin, an uncle, somebody\njust, just, he was taken away. The word, the expression was taken away and many survivors still\ntalk this way because we really didn\u2019t know the word, we don\u2019t know where they were killed, most\nof the time we don\u2019t know exactly when because taken away is the right expression for it because\nall we knew is we saw them disappear, being taken away. The Ukrainians were extremely involved\nwith the Germans. Actually, they were shooting as much, they were rounding us up as much. But\nthe round ups, called ax-see-on (ph), were the most characteristic part of that period. You were\nafraid of ax-see-on (ph) and you were beginning to think about hiding places. It never occurred to\nus that we would disperse among the native population. We just didn\u2019t think of it. Everybody knew\nme, I\u2019m Maria Heirsh from Kolomyja, where would I go? Then came the arm bands, the white arm\nbands we had to wear. The yellow stars we had to wear. The names that we had to take, the\nidentity cards that came, the cam-carda (ph). Where with my name was Sarah, the man, I can\u2019t\nremember the name for the man, there was another Jewish name, biblical name for man, which\nmeans we were identified this way. You couldn\u2019t move without a cam-carda (ph), you couldn\u2019t be\nout, you couldn\u2019t be in the street after 6:00, you couldn\u2019t walk on the sidewalks, everyday there\nwere new restrictions of various serious natures. There was a you-den-rot (ph) established, they\nasked my father to serve but he didn\u2019t want to serve, the chairman of the you-den-rot (ph) was a Mr.\nHorowitz. A Jewish police was established, my husband\u2019s brother volunteered for 1t because you\nfirst thought you would save Jews, later he was involved in all kinds, I assume of horrible things,\nalthough he didn\u2019t witness them. It was getting worse everyday. We didn\u2019t know what a ghetto\nwas. By the way, when the Soviets withdrew and the Germans were just about to come in my father\nin strange ways looked forward to it. He remembered the Austrians and he thought the Germans\nwould be part of it. With the Russians he couldn\u2019t communicate, they took away everything from\nhim. It was the Germans he favored since he speaks German and he remembers this. Austria the\nwhole while was for them the best part of their lives. Hammsburg, Austria - the Kaiser was good to\nthem. I remember as a child when the picture of Kaiser Franz Joseph came down in our living room\nand they hung up the picture of Marsukkotll Pil-sook-ski (ph) and I was happy about it. And they\ndid it for their children, I think. But they were very much attached to the German language, to the\nAustrians, so they didn\u2019t think that the Germans could be so bad because they really didn\u2019t know\nterribly much what was going on in Germany. And in Germany they didn\u2019t have extermination\ncamps, people immigrated. We knew someone from Bonn-sheen (ph) but our knowledge was\nlimited. The Soviets kept the knowledge away to a very large extent too. They didn\u2019t tell us what\nwas going on in western Poland because then they already had some camps. They didn\u2019t tell, the\nRussians kept it very sealed, very tightly. Any news from western Germany where many Jews\nlived. Some of them escaped during the Soviet period like my sister did, my sister Frania.",
        "A: It was mixed, first were men which reinforced our false beliefs that they were taken to work.\nMen, to a large extent. But there was special categories taken. At one point I saw the doctors, then\ncame some of the lawyers, fathers of students with whom I went to school, one of them lives in\nCalifornia still, one is in Florida, they both were there. Their fathers were lawyers. Then it came\nfor some workers, special workers, we were told the SS needs these workers. But you could see\nsometimes shooting in the streets. Oh, the children came much later and this was a real awakening\nat that point. But, there were food limitations, severe food limitations. We were beginning to be\nquite hungry, not starved yet, but hungry. I remember the first day of Passover, this is in my mind\nvery much, 1942. There was an announcement that we all had to go to the ghetto and they\nestablished three ghettos and they assigned to us the very poor part of the city. We were permitted\nto take on carriages, I don\u2019t know why they permitted some of these carriages still, permitted to take\nwhatever we could in carriages. I remember I took a pillow, we took some dishes, a few potatoes,\nthat\u2019s all we had. And we settled in that one-room house at the end of the town, it seemed to me, a\nvery extremely poor neighborhood. It was pretty dark, it was the first at night. It must\nhave been five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, was still enough time to prepare something for dinner. I\nrecall peeling potatoes, the potatoes I saved. And suddenly I felt smoke and I looked around and the\nghetto was on fire. And we began to run. We saw people being shot, we saw houses on fire\nincluding our own. We began to run, we didn\u2019t know where to run, people are running we are\nrunning with them. They were running to the other part of the ghetto. In the other part of the ghetto\nlived my sister Frania and her husband and their child. My husband stayed behind, he wanted to\njust catch something, still save something. As we came there he arrived a few hours later, I\nremember, and his eyebrows were all burned and he came with a half-burned chicken. He caught a\nchicken in order to feel us. It was terribly bad but we left, we were alive. And each time these\nthings happen, we touched ourselves and touched each other. We are alive. This was Passover. I\nwent to my sister\u2019s place, she had a small place there. We all crowded in there, whatever food they\nhad we ate it together. We later found that many people from that part, whom they caught, they\ntook them away and that\u2019s all we knew, they took them away. And most of the time they took them\nto sukkotp-a-rof-ska (ph) and sometimes in the distance you could hear this shooting. Still, it would\nbe somebody they perhaps shot, they obviously must have taken for work, by then they took all of\nthe children and families, whole families. This was the ax-see-on (ph) of Passover. Later on, we\nfound out, and dreaded holidays, we knew they were always were around holidays. Was easy for\nthem to drag all the Jews. Finally we got a little apartment assigned to us in that other part of the\nghetto. One, your windows of that went to the air outside, but the inside of it was the ghetto. Very\nsmall and my husband and I got an extremely small, it was a little porch and my parents got another\none in that building. Things were getting worse everyday. I recall getting up in the morning and\nlooking at the panorama of the ghetto, what it was like. People were laying, some dead of typhoid\nfever or starvation. An older Jew with a little carriage and a horse, which we later named the\nMessiah horse, would take these bodies on, put these dead bodies on that little carriage and drive\nthem out of town for burial. We called the horse the Messiah horse because it was the horse of\nliberation. By then we felt that dying, what you call of natural death, was a blessing. Some of my\nuncles had this death. I recall these bodies in the littered ghetto, they were littering the ghetto. I\nrecall sometimes getting up the morning and seeing distorted faces hanging on the street lanterns.\nAnd these distorted faces sometimes I saw the face of a teacher, of a relative, of a stranger. This\nwas the work of the SS or the common soldiers who knew where and what. At night they would\nraid the ghetto, they would come in for a sport kind of thing, and would just find a few Jews and\nhang them on the street lanterns. This I couldn\u2019t understand. This jolted me. I could understand\nthey would take away people because they need people to work in the factories, on the farms. Why\ndid they hang these teachers of mine? By then I was pretty much fully aware of the tragedy, of the\nwhole tragedy of it. Then came a tremendous ax-see-on (ph). This was in September, 1942. There\nwere little ones in between. There was an announcement that all men have to report to the auto-\nbites-on (ph), that they have to take along some food and then they will be sent to the Ukraine for\nwork. By then we were sophisticated enough not to trust them. Only men, not women. We figured\nstill, if they want men only it must be for work, but on the other hand, everybody to register. There\nwere thousands of Jews in the ghetto. By the way, our ghetto became augmented because the Jews\nfrom the providence\u2019s like your friends Alice Shick-ee (ph), Kos-off (ph), Kou-tee (ph), Uram-\nsukkot (ph), all these places were bringing, the Jews were brought into my home town, in the ghetto,\nwere all herded into the ghetto so the overcrowding was unbelievable. That all of them, all men had\nto register, we knew this much, every man in the ghetto. Well, I remember that dilemma that\nevening before. Who should go? The man in my family was my father, my husband, my two\nbrothers-in-law, Frania\u2019s husband and Cyla\u2019s husband. Menek was too young to be, they unified in\nthat Menek wouldn\u2019t go. We decided our father shouldn\u2019t go because we were afraid that he\nwouldn\u2019t be taken to work. I recall this very sad day, he came in and I couldn\u2019t recognize him. He\ntook off his beard, he sukkotved his beard to look younger and he looked horrible. He was beyond\nrecognition because my father, you see his photo, was a very handsome man and the beard was part\nof the handsomeness. And he looked about 100 years older but he decided he wanted to go. My\nhusband we thought would be safe because he was permitted while in the ghetto, he was permitted\nto work outside of the ghetto in his pharmacy. They didn\u2019t know it to operate it so he had a Red\nCross on part of his work clothes band, on part of his white band, he was permitted to go during the\nday so the Germans could have access to the pharmacy, but in the evening he had to come back to\nthe ghetto. Each evening, he was checked, he was trying to smuggle a little food for us, but each\nevening he was checked. One day he was beaten up terribly because he tried to bring a few grains\nof rye, he had put them into his collar of his coat and they found it and they beat him up mercilessly.\nBut basically he was our contact with the outside world to some extent because he worked there and\nwe decided to, he would be safe. There was no question, they\u2019re not going to take him because him\nthey needed. The man decided to go, I don\u2019t know what made for the decision, probably there was\nstill some sort of hope that they would go for work or something, and that, how could they hide?\nWe had a hiding place in that place. My husband really installed us there, before he went, he put\nmy mother, my sister Cyla who then had typhoid fever, her son, Menek, my other sister on the other\nside, me and Blancka Rosenberg. He put us into that cellar downstairs and he covered the opening\nof the floor with a little rug, put a table on top of it and was sitting then that day. [ll\nnever forget that day, it was a horrible day. The men were gone. We hoped they would return, we\nworried about our father mainly because he was older and we worried about him more than the\nothers. We thought they would return or go to work somewhere. Sitting there waiting, there were a\nfew other families there, and Blanca\u2019s child wasn\u2019t there anymore, I don\u2019t believe so, no. She was\nalone. And suddenly we hear some footsteps on top of that hiding place, with dogs. And boots,\nGerman boots. And the dogs stopped and started smelling and we knew this was the end. I still\ndon\u2019t know what happened that they walked away. Something distracted them, perhaps they didn\u2019t\ntrust the dogs enough. I do recall that moment when everybody stopped breathing. It must have\nbeen a second but it felt like eternity. And how the mouths of these babies were covered with\npillows and I was sure the babies would suffocate. They didn\u2019t, it was a moment. By then we knew\nthat our days are counted, that they meant us too, not only the men. We were sitting there for hours,\nI say it felt like eternity, and suddenly we felt smoke. The house was burning, they set the house to\nfire. We decided we have to go up. We walked out, our house was not on fire for some reason.\nThe neighboring houses were made of wood, our house was not as made. So, there was smoke all\nover. The Germans seemed to have been at the end of their day. There were dead bodies all over.\nWe could still hear some shooting. The Ukrainians were walking into the apartments, taking out\neverything they could. Polish guns, Ukrainian guns. We were alive, our men were not there. I\nremember the moment my sister, Frania with her baby, with her child, she had typhoid fever.\nSomehow or other, late evening, the men come back. Who came back? Unbelievably, my father\ncame back and my husband came back. The husbands of my sisters did not come back. We didn\u2019t\nknow what happened to them. We comforted each other. They were sending the Ukraine\u2019s to\nwork. The young men will be given food, they will be laborers. We didn\u2019t quite believe it, a part of\nus believed, another part didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t know where they were going. All the stories that\nsurvivors say they knew, we didn\u2019t know, nobody knew. We found out later through an escapee\nthat they went to Belzec, the extermination camp at Belzec which was not far from Re-vof (ph) and\nwhich eventually swallowed so many of the Jews from our town and from the neighboring towns.\nAnd I\u2019ve read a passage about it in the book by Hillberk and I found a long chapter about it many\nyears ago in the book of the American historian called Oln-ingst Pol-ece fie (ph). What was his\nname?",
        "A: Christopher Browning. He has a whole chapter on that deportation day but I want to mix it in\nright now because I like to remember what I remember because this was all later. We had no idea.\nFor many of us after the war, we didn\u2019t know that they, where they were killed. We found out this\nmuch, much later. But there they were taken, that is where they were taken, they were taken to the\nextermination camp. This was the first time that we knew, we didn\u2019t know exactly, but some\nwitnesses came back. Some people escaped from the train and they were telling us. These were gas\nchambers, but he didn\u2019t know because he escaped. This came, this was later and I\u2019m trying very\ncareful to disassociate these two sources of information, what we knew then and what we knew\nlater. But this is what swallowed my two brothers-in-law. Menek\u2019s father and Alex\u2019s father, both\nyoung men, one was only 29, the other I believe was 32. I always thought, how did they shove\nthese young men into gas chambers, but they did. We never saw them again. My sister Frania was\nthen, was very high, typhoid fever, and she kept the baby next to her body and he was not infected,\nnobody understands how this happened. We were all starved, we were hungry. After that ax-see-on\n(ph) the Germans arranged for us to have a soup kitchen. It\u2019s reviewed in the Reich. There were\nstill thousands of Jews left, they were still being brought in from the provincial towns. There\nseemed always to be more Jews. Later I found out that on that day 8,000 Jews were removed but\nthere were more. I think they wanted to appease us, they wanted to appease us by making sure we\nwill not hide, that there is still some life going on. And actually after every ax-see-on (ph) which,\nafter this extreme tension, this extreme pain, this extreme depression, a depression hung over the\nghetto for hours. After that you somehow recovered. You got up in the morning and looked out, it\nwas quiet, you went back to whatever you were trying to do, a little cooking, whatever. By then it\nwas potato peels. You went back to pray. You went back to whatever work. I worked in a factory\nwhere Blancka worked, in a tre-po-tosh (ph) factory, they were making uniforms for the German\nsoldiers. Going out of the ghetto was permitted with a special permission. Each evening we have to\ncome back. Jews were still permitted to go out to these work places, they always had to come back.\nAfter each raid, after each ax-see-on (ph) there were days that you couldn\u2019t talk to each other. You\nchecked out who was still alive but then there was some normalcy. Normalcy of life. Amazing, but\nit was there. People tried to go back. I think the soup kitchen, which they introduced so late\nthrough the yood-en-rod (ph) was a way of appeasing us, of making sure we would not be afraid to\nleave our homes, which would make their work easier, but these are hindsight. We didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened then. All we knew, the yood-en-rod (ph) asked my father, it was so important to\nmake sure that everybody would get the right kind of portions, that soup, so they asked my father to\nsupervise that soup kitchen, to stand to dish out that. He was too weak by then, he just didn\u2019t want\nthe job. His legs were swollen. He asked them whether they would permit his youngest daughter to\ndo it and they did and so it was my job. This I\u2019ll never forget again. Originally to, they gave us\nsome horse meat. They made hamburgers of horse meat, they put in some horse meat in the ghetto.\nThe women there were making this into hamburgers. It took me a long time to get use to eating it.\nBut soup, and I remember the long, long lines of Jews. Sometimes I would recognize relatives,\nsometimes recognize the teachers, sometimes I recognize the father of another student. They didn\u2019t\nlook like human beings, the way they shuffled their feet, the way they asked and the pleading tone,\nged-dak (ph), ged-dak (ph) means sick. The soup was, had a little vegetables but it was watered,\nthere was a little bit, a few beans, a few other vegetables and everybody wanted to ged-dak (ph). It\nwas my job to be fair about it and to make sure everybody would get their right amount of food.\nThis lasted perhaps two weeks. One day, it was close to this slaughter house in which was a Jewish\nslaughter house in which chicken were always killed. There was a scream and I figured what are\nthe Germans bring, chicken, they are killing the chicken? A few hours later they found they\nslaughtered in this slaughter house, they slaughtered our children. This was the end of the\nsupplication, this was the end of me, this was just the end of me. I ran home. Couldn\u2019t talk. I\ncouldn\u2019t tell anybody what I heard. The rumor came later and everybody heard it. This was the end\nof my soup kitchen standing, I think it was the end of the total soup kitchen. The soup kitchen, the\npeople stay with me, the people who looked like sukkotdows of their earlier selves. These people\nwho were begging, ged-dak (ph). I wish they wouldn\u2019t be forgotten. This was the ghetto. I would\nlike for a break, thank you.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "A: I remember, I threw myself on the bed. We had a very small place, one room. I threw myself on\nthe bed and I sobbed and sobbed for hours. And then I went, and then my husband came in and I\nthink we began to talk, and then the news was all over. The city knew by then, the ghetto, but\nimmediately I just couldn\u2019t put into words, I couldn\u2019t talk, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t realize the extent of it. I\nremember it was chronological I\u2019m not sure that I remember exactly when it happened, but\nsometime in 1942, all of these things were towards the end of 1942. A woman came to our\napartment, to this small apartment that my husband and I stayed, and I recall she fell on her knees\npleading with him to give her something. I cannot remember whether he did or didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what this was all about. I found out later that she pleaded with him to give her cyanide\nfor the child. She\u2019s alive, this woman is alive and I think the child is alive, somewhere in Australia.\nThis I heard many years later. I\u2019m trying to remember, she was from a in Kolomyja,\nMrs. Hermann, I remember. Apparently the news came that the children would be taken away. I\nthink the full tragedy fell upon me at that point. When I heard children, that they\u2019re planning to\nremove the children, then I knew that this was the end and there really 1s no way of escaping, there\u2019s\nno more talk about going to the Ukraine for work or anything. That night, it was after that\nbutchering, that night sort of brought the full awareness, the full confrontation with the truth as to\nwhat was happening. By then, I think Blancka who worked in that factory at was\nLydia, the Polish woman who was the manager of the factory, it was about that time that she came\nhome saying that Lydia is ready to give her papers to run away. I still didn\u2019t understand the\nbusiness of running away, I couldn\u2019t understand any of it. A day later she brought papers and she\nshowed me, she had a ken-card-da (ph), she had something which showed that she was, the name\nwas Bruen-flower Per-nash-ik (ph) and we encouraged her to go away although I wasn\u2019t sure\nbecause at one point earlier one of my colleagues was trying to get through the ghetto wall and she\nwas shot on the spot. So there was a great deal of conflict that we were encouraging about, we\nalready knew by then that things were going very, very bad. She had lost all her family by then, so\nwe thought, perhaps she should go. She asked me that I should join, I wasn\u2019t ready to do anything.\nMy husband started talking about it. He was nearly everyday on the other side and somehow or\nother he began working toward my escape without my knowledge of it because I didn\u2019t want to hear\nabout it. This was towards the end of 1942. By then, we began to talk about it, that you need some\nhiding places outside of the ghetto. The number of the people was narrowing down very much,\nthere were just a few thousand people left. At it\u2019s height, I think there were 30,000 Jews in the\nghetto. So we knew that things are narrowing very much, but there was some peace. They didn\u2019t\ndo anything for a while. Somehow or other we started talking about perhaps we could get some\nhiding places on the outside. We had a friend and a woman who was a customer in our store, not\nquite a customer, she was a Polish woman, a very fine lady who was poor. So, when she\nestablished a relation, my father who would give her some of the dishes whatever for, a little\nmoney, during the ghetto days she occasionally smuggled some food for us. Her name was Wein-a-\nrof-ska (ph), and her place was across from the house in which originally my sister Cyla and her\nhusband lived. Somehow or other, he was in touch with her. I found out these things much later.\nBut he was also in touch with another couple. Well, \u2019'm jumping a little bit ahead of time here, but\nactually came December of 1942 when we began to talk seriously about it. That I should be the ice\nbreaker in a way, I should be the first one in the family to get out, to jon Blancka, and then my\nsister and her child will come.",
        "A: Families are different. I\u2019ve seen a lot of, it\u2019s painful to talk about it because I saw in families,\nhow people were grabbing the portion of food. These were families like my own where we always\nkept passing the food, I\u2019m not hungry. Particularly my parents, we were this kind of family, close\nfamily, always passing the food to the next one, we\u2019re not hungry. But in some families, they were\nfighting for the bite of food. The people looked liked ghost, they were, all of us were in this, in this\narea there was no food left. I remember when we started cooking the potato chips, potato peels.\nMy mother cooked it in water, she added a little salt to it. This was the lunch. Lydia Wen-a-rof-\nska (ph), this is the Polish woman who sometimes smuggled in, 1n some way she smuggled in a\nlittle flour, so the flour had to be stretched. It was mixed with, sometimes you had only potatoes.\nBut the starvation was everywhere, definitely. I recall, somewhere or other I was younger and I\nthink this helped because my parents legs were very swollen, particularly my father, he couldn\u2019t get\ninto his shoes, he wore slippers my then. I took a look at them at one point and I knew they\ncould\u2019nt\u2019t stretch it because of the starvation. But more than that, I was just worried that they will\nbe shot. Sometimes I saw these weak people in the house, they didn\u2019t even bother to take them out,\nthey shot them right there. So it was at that time, but you want me to come back to Lydia, right? To\nLydia, I guess?",
        "A: Yes, he was still praying. Many of the orthodox Jews were still praying. I hope he prayed when\nhe was going to death, I hope so, because praying you know, somehow or other gets into another\norbit. I read about it later, that many of the Has-sid-ims (ph) they went into the fire while praying so\nthey didn\u2019t feel what was going on. I suppose that some of these behaviors anesthetized them, I am\nnot sure it happened to my father but, I wish it would. They were, I\u2019Il tell you in a minute how they\nwere killed, and that horrible death, but anyway, working 1n that part, in the ta-kosh (ph) factory we\ncame home every day but then there were days that we were not permitted to leave the ghetto\nanymore. And when Blancka left, she somehow or other, she put something into the mind of my\nhusband in particular, that there is a way out. But whether he\u2019d thought about it earlier I\u2019m not sure,\nhe didn\u2019t sukkotre it with me. By the way, he looked extremely non-Jewish while I looked Jewish.\nI didn\u2019t know I looked Jewish until I got to the other side, but he did and his Polish was perfect too,\nso he had some ideas at that point, I think. He started talking about me and I didn\u2019t want to hear\nabout it. Finally, the arrangement was that I would be the first one to go to meet Blancka, then my\nsister and her baby would come, and then he would arrange for my oldest sister and her son and my\nparents, he will arrange a hiding place outside of town, through the help of this Lydia Wen-a-rof-ska\n(ph), and then he will come. And he got himself papers too. I can\u2019t remember the name, but he said\nhe had papers. He had, he brought in papers one day, sometime in December, he brought in papers\nwith the name of Julianna Gol-ska (ph), he showed me, that\u2019s me. He told me he obtained it\nthrough the help of some non-Jewish family and this was authentic. Actually a girl who looked like\nme, who had died, and he purchased the papers, who he got them through I still don\u2019t know. There\nwas so little talk about it. Perhaps he talked more and the fright on my part really obstructed my\nthinking about it, or my memory about it. I recall, the only way, I still don\u2019t know how I decided to\ngo. The only way, because he worked so skillfully on me, that he\u2019ll join me in two weeks, he\u2019ll\ncome and meanwhile he had arranged all these things, and it seemed, he told me the idea thing, that\nI will be the path breaker, that I\u2019Il be the one to lead the way and they will all survive this way.\nWhether I really believed it, I wanted to believe it, I still don\u2019t know. It was a very hard decision\nbut there was no time for decision. Somehow or other they told me tomorrow, these people will\npick you up in the morning at 6:00 in the morning. It was Christmas, 1942, the people I personally\ndidn\u2019t know but my family did. They were landowners, Polish landowners, sort of an aristocracy,\nwho had business with my father. My father use to give them these fine porcelain things and they\nremembered him and they wanted to do something for the family. How we got hold of them, I still\ndon\u2019t know. Perhaps my father talked to him, some of these things I wish I knew but I do not. It\nwas Christmas morning, he brought in the night before a krosh-ock (ph), a krosh-ock (ph) is a\nUkrainian fur coat, which is a peasant coat, which is skin on the outside and lambs wool inside.\nVery, you have it on the photos you see of Kolomyyja, peasant girls always wore these things, it was\nwarm. I remember he buttoned me up. I remember he put into this sleeve, he put into five dollars\ninto the sleeve of this krosh-ock (ph) we called it, the coat. I said good-bye to my family the night\nbefore, at 6:00 in the morning, Christmas morning, 1942, these people were waiting outside in a pair\nof sleighs with horses. I wish I could remember details, all I know is I went through the wall, which\nwas not very far, the wall of the ghetto. I saw a policeman walking back and forth, he didn\u2019t see\nme. I recall removing the white arm band and all I know, I was in their carriage and they passed on\nthe Aryan side and the windows of my parents room was through the Aryan side and I saw\nsilhouettes of my parents in the window behind curtains. And I had the strange sense that I\u2019Il never\nsee them again. Despite the promises my husband made. And I remember how I tried totally to\ndeny that feeling, to stop that feeling, to stop thinking about it and to concentrate on the ride, and I\nwas sure that somebody will identify me, after all, people knew me in the town, I supposed so. But\nI was with these Polish people twice my age, they brought me to the railway station. The man went\nout, he bought me a ticket to Re-volf (ph), I got on the train and I remember very little about the\ntrain ride except that I arrived in Re-volf (ph) in the home of their niece or cousin, it was a\nChristmas party. Exactly what I needed at that point, but I came there, I was introduced as their\nfriend from Kolomyja and it was a lot of festivity going on, there was food on the table. I tried to\njoin and then in the evening I left. I was suppose to come back to their home. And suddenly I saw a\nmiddle-aged man following me. I remember he was dressed in a very warm way, there was a sort\nof kerchief on his head, and he said, Madame, he said in Polish to me, Mrs. Nei-dat (ph), you are the\nwife of the night of Kolomyja you look very cute, something of this sort, and I started\nrunning, and he ran after me. It was a cold night of Christmas in Re-volf (ph) and I think my young,\nand I could hear his breath against me, and this must have been a scene of running, nobody else was\nin the streets, there was quite a bit of sleet, it was cold, Christmas night. But I was young and I was\na good runner and somehow or other, I still don\u2019t believe how this happened, he couldn\u2019t follow my\nsteps. And he stopped somewhere, I ran into a courtyard, then another courtyard, and I saw him\nagain, and I could hear his breath and then everything stopped. I never went back to these people.\nBut I had an address of, Blancka gave me some address on High-lit-ska (ph) Street and I went there\nand I made up a whole story and she wasn\u2019t there, I hoped to meet her, and without her and being all\nalone, it was the first experience, all I wanted the next day was to go home, to go back to the ghetto.\nAnd I got in touch with that friend who helped her, Ad-ja (ph) was his name, a German Jew\noriginally who had come from Kolomyja and he was very well entrenched as a Pole, he looked like\nPolish nobility, and I let him know I was here, he came to see me. We locked the door, and I told\nhim, I don\u2019t want to hear about anything, all he can do for me was to go to the station and buy me a\nticket, I was afraid to run around the station, and all I want is to go back to Kolomyja. The man\nsaved my life in strange ways by talking to six hours, he literally out-talked me. By then, I was\ntotally, totally passive and totally listless. I pleaded, all I want is to die with my people in the ghetto\nand no argument really made sense to me, I wanted to get to Kolomyja and I wanted to die with my\npeople, and he kept saying that Pll never get to my people, you will not be able to get into the\nghetto, they will shoot me at the station, and nothing penetrated. Perhaps it did and I didn\u2019t want to\nhear it. I remember that after six hours, I couldn\u2019t hear anymore. And he didn\u2019t go to the railway\nstation and I passed another day and he made up a whole story, he was my fiancee, he was\nsomebody that was interested in me, and he will visit again. And then later was very interested in\nhim, he looked like Polish nobility, I was figuring there was some money too, I stayed another day\nand another day. And I had a story, the story was that I came to study , | take a\ncourse. So, the classes are not held every day and it\u2019s pretty flexible. Anyway, with\nthe Czech she looked away, she didn\u2019t know, I still don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know these things, but\nshe kept me. A few days later Blancka arrives. Things fell through for her in Warsaw, she had only\nbeen to Warsaw, they caught into Warsaw, and there things broke. So she came\nback here and we started a life together in that apartment, in that furnished room, and he would visit\nus and was, she always was a charismatic student and so on. And one day, and this is after\nChristmas naturally, I had news from the ghetto, from Maria Roman-o-rof-ski (ph), through that\nwoman who pushed food into the ghetto, and that everything was still the same, no change, they\nwere still alive. And one day, Blanca\u2019s looking for work, everybody said I shouldn\u2019t walk in the\nstreets so easily, but then people were conscious I looked Jewish, I didn\u2019t know, but Blancka looked\nPolish, so she went for a newspaper very early in the morning to see what the , what or\nwhere were jobs, to look for a job. And she hears somebody, calls her Blancka, and she got very\nfrightened naturally because by then her name was Broom-ka Ba-nat-chek (ph). She took a look in\nthe doorway, sits my sister with the baby and her sister-in-law and they look like chimney sweeps,\nall covered with ashes from the ghetto, from running away from the fires in the ghetto. She brought\nthem upstairs to her room and the story came out. The story came out that on the 2nd of February,\nwhich I always remember for other reasons too, this was the time that Stalingrad was taken over by\nthe Soviets, this was the first German defeat and was a change in the war, I didn\u2019t know then what,\nall I knew is that on the 2nd of February, the night of the 2nd of February, my parents and my older\nsister and Menek were sitting in another part of the ghetto by then, in their room, all dressed. For\ndays they expected, they expected the SS or the Germans to come and take them. There was no\nway out by then, it was a very cold night. And Menek told me years later that somebody came in\nfrom the neighbor\u2019s to tell about Stalingrad and that my father\u2019s spirit was lifted, and I\u2019m so grateful\nfor that moment, that his spirit was lifted. But it was 2 o\u2019clock in the morning or so, they came, and\nthey took all out of them, they took them out. I found out later that they women were separated, my\nmother and my sister, her daughter and her distant cousin, a young girl, , Lou-\nchie (ph) was her name, they were separated and the men, my father and his grandson, Menek, were\ntaken separate. And hungry they were, they were ill, they were not dressed well, it was terribly\ncold, sleet in the night, in the middle of the night, they dragged them through the streets of\nKolomyyja, they dragged them to Chap-a-rot-ska (ph) to be killed there. Frania, who lived in another\npart of the ghetto, but then her husband had been taken away, she was with the child and she was\nwith her sister and her husband\u2019s sister-in-law, this woman left her baby in the ghetto, she ran\nwithout the baby. She and my sister and Alex Schlessing, Alex\u2019s name was Elee-ow (ph) then, they\nran through the fire. The ghetto was set on fire, they ran through the fire and half burned all, all\ncovered with ashes, they found themselves at a neighboring railway station, they bought tickets and\ncame to Re-volf (ph). And they didn\u2019t know where to go, they didn\u2019t have an address or anything,\nso they saw one light, lit up, so they went into that building to find out about a hotel and the building\nwas the criminal polizer, the police, the German police, nothing but. Somebody prayed for them.\nThey said, there are no hotels, they walked out. And they sat in a doorway and that is where\nBlancka met them and she found them. My sister told us of the terrible details, that the parents were\nseparated, and what happened to her and that they could hear the shots. And she thinks, she thought\nperhaps Menek escaped, she wasn\u2019t sure. Nobody knew. All I remember, this was late afternoon,\nlistening to the story, all I recall was that all I hoped for was that the floor would open up and I will\ndisappear. I didn\u2019t want to live. She didn\u2019t know enough about my husband, he was separated from\nmy father and Menek. She thought she heard something, that he was taken to prison, that they were\nbeating him, she wasn\u2019t sure, nobody knew. I still don\u2019t know. Apparently, they either killed him\nin prison or took him to Chap-a-rof-sa (ph). That was the night, the last night after that, no Jew was\nleft in Kolomyja. My nephew, Menek, wrote up about that night. I recall that I couldn\u2019t stand just\nbeing alive. I stretched on that floor, Frania too, and I wanted nothing but for the floor to open and\nthe floor didn\u2019t open, that hard floor was there. I couldn\u2019t even cry. I couldn\u2019t take it in in any way.\nExcept Blancka woke me from that stupor I think sometime later saying that the landlady wants to\nbring us some tea. And this meant we had to get up, wash up, and look pretty. And I recall looking\nat the mirror and putting on lipstick and not believing it\u2019s me. She brought in tea. We had to make\narrangements for my sister\u2019s place, they slept over that night, we made up a cock-eyed story and\nlater we tried to find a place for them. They found other people from my home town, other women,\nthe men were all killed by then. And the story of many came out much later. What happened to\nhim is a really fantastic story. He was together with my father, being marched from that horrible\nnight, and there was shooting and the dogs were barking and the dogs were biting some people.\nAnd he was blaming my father in a way, saying, I told you we should have run away earlier, we\nshould have gone to the place, whatever, and my father said to him, something from the Talmud, he\nsaid, the Talmud says if the sword is around your neck, a miracle may happen. He was then 15 or\n16 years old, he interpreted this as a sign from his grandfather he should run away, so he ran away.\nFor years he was trying to get hold of that quotation, found out about it rather recently, but he ran\naway and the people were being marched, they were marched to Sukkotp-a-rot-ska (ph). By then it\nwas early morning and the neighbors could look out and some saw the Jews. And he was wounded\nin his leg, a shot came to, a bullet got into his leg. He fell on snow and ice. A Ukrainian policeman\nstepped over him and said to the Germans very stoically, he\u2019s dead. And as that colonnade of\npeople marched and marched for hours, he was lying there, then he felt himself alive, just bleeding,\nso he crouched, he approached a house he knew in the ghetto where he had worked somewhere and\nhe saw a baby in the fireplace. This is a story he told me about five years ago, he couldn\u2019t talk\nabout it. And he didn\u2019t know whether the parents who ran, left the baby, hid the baby there because\napparently there was no fire before, or whether the Ukrainians or Germans put the baby into the\nfireplace and set the fireplace afire. This he kept secret. Somehow or other, he jumped from that\nplace because he heard the SS marching, and the Ukrainians, he jumped in the attic to another place.\nHe was jumping most of the time, he heard the shots and through in that snow he\ngot outside of the ghetto to the house of the Polish woman, Bron-ra-off-ska (ph), who use to live\nacross the street from their home and who use to take care of the plants of the flower plants of my\nsister-in-law when my sister went on vacation. This Polish woman was poor and she supported\nherself by renting rooms to Ukrainian gymnasium students. So she had a husband and she had two\nstudents who lived there because they went to the gymnasium and they paid her something, that\u2019s\nhow she lived. Very early morning, he appeared at the door of this woman. I\u2019m sure he looked\nmore animal than human, and he heard the shots going on the Chap-a-rot-ska (ph), he knew this was\nhis mother, he knew this was his grandparents, and he pleaded with the woman to let him in for the\nnight, he was bleeding. And she said she can\u2019t, she\u2019s afraid because the Ukrainian students were\nthere. Somehow or other, I think, out of pity for this child-animal, she let him in for one night. She\nput him in the barn. Next morning she came to take him out and she was one who my father helped\noccasionally with some of the dishes to give her for a little money, I don\u2019t know what moved her,\nshe didn\u2019t have the heart to take him out. She left him, she covered him with straw and under straw\nhe lived there for about six or seven months. She kept him there. She lived with great danger, her\nhusband she apparently let on many months later. The Ukrainian students never knew about it.\nEvery night she would smuggle a little food downstairs. He was immobilized, he didn\u2019t move, it\nwas then. One day, he remembers, it was Spring by then. Well, that night, he says, all\nhe kept thinking, which of these bullets killed his mother and his grandfather and his grandmother\nbecause that\u2019s all he could hear, all night and all day the shooting was going on. This was the last of\nthe Kolomyja Jews and he remembers that all he was, felt guilty that he wasn\u2019t there. But he was\ncovered in snow, by straw. And one day, toward the Spring in March, he saw the snow coming\ndown the windows so it was a little light. Until then, he didn\u2019t see any daylight because snow and\nice covered the windows. And he looked around and he saw some books. These Ukrainian students\napparently when graduating they threw the books into the basement. One of the books he took was\na chemistry book. He started reading. That is why he\u2019s one of the foremost bio-chemist. He\u2019s the\none who is the developer of the , , Menek Goldstein. This was the\nbeginning of it, the chemistry book. He lived hungry there because very little food she could afford\nto give him, she was afraid, every night would bring down a little bit, he was a growing boy. And\nhe lived in extreme terror of discovery, always afraid of the Ukrainians. And one day, the woman\ncomes in, she says, there is a denouncement, somebody denounced that she\u2019s harboring a Jew, he\nhas to disappear. That night, it was Spring of 1944, that he had to leave the basement, the shed.\nAnd he remembered that Selik (ph), my husband\u2019s brother, had told him some time ago that he and\nsome others would have a hiding place. In the middle of the night he ran to that hiding place, they\ndidn\u2019t want to let him in. They didn\u2019t want another person, they were afraid. But my brother-in-law\ninsisted, he had a gun with him because he was a policeman, so they let him in. So he was liberated\nthere by the Soviets. When the Soviets came he couldn\u2019t walk so they carried him. The Soviet\nsoldiers carried him on their arms to the , to the municipality to show what\nhappened. Later on, is a long story. But, there\u2019s the story of Menek. Later on still begins a long\nstory, but that\u2019s one of, this is how Menek survived and how he depicted it in his statement about\nthe last night in Kolomyja. And us he told little details each time, each time we commemorate in a\nquiet way. My sister, Menek and I, we commemorate February 2nd. We don\u2019t have any\ncelebration, we don\u2019t do anything much, but we don\u2019t go to cinemas and we don\u2019t do any\nentertainment, we have dinner together and we sit down and over the years always some detail\ncomes out. Some of these details just came out within a few years. He couldn\u2019t talk about that\nbaby, he couldn\u2019t talk about some of the things. But that book of chemistry had such an influence.\nIt\u2019s a long story about Menek, another time perhaps. So I worked because I wanted to make sure\nthat the story of the last day in the ghetto, my parents horrible deaths, how they dragged them 1n that\nterrible, on ice, how they were falling around and I hoped they never reached that ;\nthat they died on the road, but I'll never know. They were separated, men and women. Can you\nimagine what happened to my father all alone. Menek ran away, he didn\u2019t know Menek would\nsurvive to tell this story but he did. So, this was the end of the ghetto. I knew these details from my\nsister in that house, that evening, and I said, we have to get up because this lady decided to give us\ntea, we have to make up and look human. Then we found a place for her and then started all kinds\nof troubles because somebody told her that she is harboring Jews and had to run away from the\nplace. Anyway, it was, one day I walked with my sister and her child, and she was in grave danger\nbecause the boy was circumcised and with two of her friends, women friends from the ghetto, and\ntheir children. And we were looking for the place for them to live because they were denounced by\nthen. My sister had some diamonds sewn into the buttons of her sweater, she never removed the\nsweater. Each time things happened, she sold the diamonds somehow or other. Kept all of us,\nBlancka and me alive too. At one point, I needed new documents and the diamonds bought it. We\nneed an apartment and the diamonds bought it. We were looking for something and I notice a girl\nwho looks at me very much, it was a former student from my home, a Ukrainian girl. And before I\nknow, I notice that she is bringing over a Ukrainian policeman. It was very dangerous and I\nmotioned to Branch and to the other women, it\u2019s not good, we have to do something, we have to\ndisappear, but how do we disappear? He\u2019s looking at us. So we decided to disappear in the next\nstore, which was a millenary store, selling hats. This is 6 o\u2019clock in the evening and we try on every\nhat in the store hoping that this man will disappear. Well, sitting there and trying on hats is exactly\nwhat we need at that point, he did not disappear. The store closed, we had to move. He did\napproach us, in very quiet words, voice, not to make any noise, he said, come with me, I know your\nJewisses. He started marching us out, what helped us most was it was dark. The darkness helped\nall of us at that point. And he took us somewhere in an isolated area, he had a revolver with him\nand he said, I\u2019m going to shoot you. So we started pleading. I started pleading with him that he\nshouldn\u2019t shoot my sister, if he has to shoot someone, me, because she had a baby, she had a child.\nAnyway, he decided not to shoot but to take everything we had. Rings, jewelry, whatever we had,\nthere were five women of us. He got everything. He even took my coat. We couldn\u2019t go back to\nthat place were we lived anymore, we had to find new places. This was continuous when they\ncaught us, we had to. Finally we got a place, things quieted down a little bit. It was a better time.\nBlancka and I got jobs in a German hospital. This was a hospital for the treatment of returned\nsoldiers from the front. They had frost bite, they were sick, they had wounds, so Blancka became\ntheir scrub woman and I was assigned to the apothotacary (ph) which was very good for me because\nI knew something and I was handy about things, but I never disclosed that I knew German or\nanything so I was dumb. It was quite a period in our lives except we sukkotred a room somewhere,\na furnished room, and I developed a terrible pain in my feet. I couldn\u2019t walk, I couldn\u2019t walk to the\ntoilet. And the question was, what do I do, how does one go to a doctor? Finally things are so bad\nthat they decided I have to go to a doctor. It was Polish doctor and he said, I have flat feet. Which I\ngot because I was so swollen, I ate only potatoes, breads, whatever it was. And I swell up to such\nan extent, I weigh so much more . Anyway, he put me into some shoes which I wore\nthrough the rest of the war. It helped immensely. And things were pretty smooth at one point.\nFrania was also set up somewhere and one day, 1n that apothecary, the Ukrainian girl walks in. She\nmust have followed me or whatever. And she knew Stodge (ph), the chief of the Upper Taker (ph)\nGerman men in uniforms in the military hospital. And she says, I know from that she\u2019s\nJewish. And he paled, I could see the blood was running down his face and immediately he reaches\nout for the telephone, I assume to call the military police, and I jumped through the window, it was a\nground floor. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know how I did it, I did it! How did I walk out of the ghetto, I\njumped through, how did I did it, I don\u2019t know? And I run into Blanca\u2019s other, to her and I say, let\u2019s\nescape, and we run away, told our story, couldn\u2019t get back anymore because we knew that we\nwould be denounced. We found out hours later, we find posters with our names and also 1n it they\nsaid Jewish Women and they masquerade for, they\u2019re trying to fool the German government, and so\nmuch money is offered for our capture and so on. We sat in doorways, Ed-au (ph), somehow it\ninvolved Ed-au (ph), he was with us, he helped. He got us tickets at night we went to the railway\nstation, we got tickets to go to Warsaw. I never knew anything in Warsaw, I knew nobody.\nBlancka had been at Warsaw, she knew the city. On the train people were talking about soap being\nmade of Jews, we don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about, we had no idea about these things. I\nhad a strange, weird feeling but I never understood what they talk was about. Jewish muscles are\nbeing turned into soap. Some primitive, very under-educated women sitting in the train with us.\nWe, our arrival, who I thought was a night train, the night train was the best things because it was\ndark, we arrive in Warsaw, and to just try to get through the railway station to a tram, and suddenly\nI feel two hands on my shoulders and I see two hands on Blanca\u2019s shoulders. These are Polish\nSecret Agents, they introduce themselves, they\u2019re secret agents and in a very polite way, apol-solum\npan-ya (ph) which means, would you kindly follow me. We followed them right across the railway\nstation, we see criminal polic-eye (ph), the police! There were all kinds of polic-eye (ph), there was\ncriminal police, there was shoo-pol (ph), there was Gestapo. This is Good Friday, 1943. We come\nto that station, there\u2019s a lot of people there. And they bring in men and we see the flames over the\nghetto and to hear the ghetto is fighting. The ghettos being burned, we don\u2019t hear about the fights,\nbeing burned and the Jews, they are escaping. And we see men being brought in and separated from\nus immediately, brought to another room, we don\u2019t see them ever coming back. Apparently\nbecause they are mounted to trucks or cars and ships and somebody immediately. And they try to\nexamine us. They say we are Jewish people. Blancka has a document, I have a document. Where\nare you going? Where are you from? All kinds of lies, so they don\u2019t believe us, and I say, let\ncall youll find out about us. But there were no telephone arranged to\nmake these calls, or they couldn\u2019t get us, whatever it was. A police comes in. Blancka suddenly\ndisappears. I have no, where she goes. I am alone. A priest comes in and he starts examining me,\nin the catechism, it so happened that I studied it during those months. And he says, I pass. One\nquestion he asked, which I didn\u2019t know, I later asked many Poles about it, even after the war, very\nfew of them knew. I forgot the name of it, , 1f you give birth to a baby, viv-ia\n(ph) it\u2019s called, the priest, you're not quite clean. The priest has to come out of the church and with\nhis belt he has to bring you in. So, very few Poles know it, very few good Catholics know it.\nAnyway, he asked that question which I didn\u2019t know. The rest, I knew everything very well, and I\nstuck to my guns. My grandparents name is this and my parents name is that and I live on that\nstreet, and so on. I just told them believe me. Blancka disappeared and I don\u2019t see her anymore.\nThe documents we had to leave right there, 1f you had documents they\u2019re not on the desk anymore,\nmy documents are there. My ken-carp (ph), my passport, my money is there. Towards the evening,\nand I hear some noises and I see the flames of the ghetto, and they talk about it. Says the ghetto is\nbeing burned, flames over the ghetto. Towards the evening, one of the Polish policeman, his name\nis Stau-ck (ph), and he interrogated me a lot, he says, come with me. I\u2019m going to mail a letter. He\ntakes me to the railway station, he mails a letter, no, he takes me to the post office right across the\nrailway station and he disappears. And here am I alone, in the street, probably the most dangerous\nplace in the world for any person, right across the railway station. With the ghetto flames coming\nright our way, there was a sewer next to me. I see many Polish and Ukrainians, no, Polish and\nGermans, right there watching the sewers and the top of the sewer comes off and Jews from the\nghetto trying to escape and they\u2019re being shot on the spot or taken away. And my instinct is to run\naway but I don\u2019t have a document, I don\u2019t know the city, I don\u2019t have a penny and whether I felt I\nwas at the end of the rope, I do not know. I am totally immobilized. I wait for this man. I didn\u2019t\ncare, I knew escaping I would be caught immediately, I would be shot right because the people from\nthe sewers were bring shot right there. And I stand there in that place, which is so unbelievable for\nme, that I\u2019m standing there and waiting for my death. And he comes out, the policeman, Stau-ck\n(ph), and he says, come with me. He takes me back to the police station and he says, you prove to\nme you're not Jewish, you would have run away. He returns to me the documents and the money,\nwhat little money I had, and he says to me, come with me. He puts me in the car, he goes with me,\nhe says, you have no place to stay I will get you a place to stay overnight. I figure he probably is\nputting me at a place where I\u2019Il be denounced or whatever. He brings me there, it is right at the\nborder of the ghetto. He opens the door, the landlady opens the door and she opens another door, it\nwas French doors I remember, and there sits Blancka. He re-united us until today\u2019s day, we don\u2019t\nknow who this man is. He came back next day, he told Blancka that I look Jewish, no, he didn\u2019t say\nJewish, he says, it\u2019s better if you try to get out, let her stay home and it will stop something, the\nmessage was that I looked Jewish. We later wondered, we still don\u2019t know, that perhaps he was\nwith the Polish underground, I wish I knew. Certain things I so wish I knew. I stayed there. The\nscreams from the ghetto were coming out, all night. The trucks were being loaded with people and\nthere was shooting going right there and the flames were very close. I don\u2019t know why he brought\nus there, perhaps he felt this was safe place, perhaps these were safe homes that they had for the\nunderground, I say, this all comes from later reading. I don\u2019t know what happened. He came back\na few times, he told Blancka to go to the are-bites-aumph (ph) and look for a job and indeed, one\nday, she found a job through the are-bites-aumph (ph) and she became a maid, a cook in a German\nhousehold. The people\u2019s name was Kinsel (ph). The man was the chief representative of taxation\nfor all of the government. There were twenty people working for him, they all were CPA\u2019s or\naccountants. Blancka was cooking lunch for them and one day she tells me she needs help, she\ncannot do so much, so they say go and look for help, she says she has somebody she knows, she\nbrings me and they have this scene in the book, I think. I played the role beautifully of being a real\nmaid from the worst parts of the city where I cannot speak any German, my mother is a laundress\nfrom that, I\u2019m use to violence, I\u2019m use to, I look a little bit like a whore, they said, when they\ninterviewed me. I didn\u2019t understand what in German, I had to, ask Blancka put it, the translation.\nAnd they look at me and they say, they\u2019re not sure I belong here, I look like a whore, I look like a\nthief. And with this background , SO Blancka says perhaps she\u2019ll try out for a few\ndays. Anyway, when I came back to the kitchen we started laughing in unbelievable ways. And\nsince then, I was there to clean the rooms and she was my supervisor, she had a better job, she was\nthe hausfrau, you know, she was the cook and she was the house maid, . The\ntrouble was when they wanted to send me to buy something, I was afraid to walk in the street. So, I\nwould walk in the streets like this, with my nose up, because my nose was a give-away. I had\nfantasies of getting plastic surgery on my nose but first I didn\u2019t have a penny to do it and then I was\nafraid of these doctors. So I didn\u2019t do it. But the nose was a give-away. Polish girls in Warsaw\nlook very different, broad cheeks, blonde, we may look different now but in those days, you could\nsee a Slavonic face. And besides, there were people just seeming to do nothing but looking at you\nto see whether they can catch a Jew. I remember a child once attacking me, saying I\u2019m Jewish and I\nopened my big mouth and I said, I\u2019m going to call the police, you know, I threatened him. This\nhappened to me a few times, whenever I was accused of something, I would open a big mouth, but I\nwas in danger all of the time. We lived with these people in a very good neighborhood because the\nGermans occupied the best part of town. We had a room to ourselves and they would travel very\noften to Germany, they had a baby. And for us these were the best days, when they went away\nbecause we could invite some people, we found people like Lod-joy (ph) and High-lin-ka (ph) and\nBoil-it (ph), we found the underground. I recall distinctly the day when I found out there was an\nunderground. This was one of the great days in my life. My depression, my sense of extreme\nterror, lifted. I knew if I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m going to die in some way knowing that Germans are\nbeing killed. There is a resistance movement. It was a fantastic experience. Until then, I didn\u2019t\nknow about any resistance. They were the first ones to introduce me to it. There\u2019s the Polish\nresistance and Jewish resistance fighters and they\u2019re actually attacking Germans. To be connected\nwith this was, lifted me up in ways that I didn\u2019t know until that was possible. I wasn\u2019t afraid\nbecause I was not afraid of dying. So many times that I wanted to die, I think that dying, it 1s the\nway to die, I was afraid of the way in which they\u2019ll kill me. If I\u2019m detected as a Jew, there are\nparticular kinds of brutalities against people who cheated the German government, these are the\nGerman SS. So they had horrible ways of killing you and this is what I wanted to avoid. But to be\ndead, it really did not matter. At no time did I believe I would survive, at no time did I believe this\nwas possible. We didn\u2019t see the end of the war yet.",
        "A: I rehearsed to some extent, I can\u2019t remember that I rehearsed. I was prepared in a way, that I'll\nwear a, what do you call it, a dish towel around my body. That I'll speak that Polish slang. I knew\nabout enough Polish, although I didn\u2019t think they will know the difference, really, but that I will be\nlooking down at them with some sort of suspicion. That I will take the job that fits me or I will not\nbe interested, the job may be too heavy, I'll see. That I come from Mok-ul-tof (ph), Mok-ul-tof (ph)\nwas a place, was a suburb which was working people with a lot of crime in it and prostitution and\nopen bars and so on. And that my mother is a washer woman there. And this gave them, Blancka\ntranslated it all, and then they sent me out and then they called in Blancka saying that they\u2019re not\nsure that they, that I belong, really. This is background, I look a little like a thief, that I may steal.\nAnd there was a guest of theirs there, no, she looks more like a prostitute. So Blancka says she\ndidn\u2019t know, but she\u2019ll hire me for a few days, see what happens. And then there were twenty\npeople working for this company, some of them were Jewish we found out later. They were the\nCPA\u2019s and the accountants. And work, being sent on errands was a death sentence to me because I\nknew I'll never come back, but they sent me to buy this and buy that. And these kids in the street,\nsaying Jud-ifka (ph), looking at me saying Jud-ifka (ph), the Jewiss. How these kids knew\nimmediately, it is in the blood stream. When people are trained for generations to identify enemy\npeople they know. Same, I am sure it was here, with whites and blacks for centuries. So every kid\nin the street identified me that easily. And whenever I came home safe, it was a miracle. Our\ngreatest enemies were the people who, nos-trouch (ph), trouch (ph) is like a door man, but actually\nlike a concierge, but lesser in status. They were saying we had to register and he was on the out\nlook for Jews because finding these Jews, there was money. So there were always some stories, that\nthe Jew was caught and there were always posters in the streets, they will offer $50, $100, whatever\nit is, if they would find the Jew. So there was a searching for Jews going on continually.",
        "A: Sch-mol-siv-a-nik (ph). Sch-mol (ph) means fat. They assumed that people would live off the\nfat. And they\u2019re job, and there were too many of them, terribly many, might have happened in other\ncountries too but in Warsaw it was a gang of Sch-mol-siv-a-nik\u2019s (ph). Some of them might have\nbeen rich, some poor, some just hated Jews, some just wanted the money, whatever it was, they\u2019re\njob was to find a Jew and to extort money from him. Sometimes they delivered you later to the\npolice station but sometimes they let you go. Sometimes they took your documents in addition to\nthe money. But Sch-mol-siv-a-nik (ph) was a profession at that point. They stood in the streets of\nWarsaw and they observed you and they approached you. Once on a tram, I saw a man looking\nvery suspiciously at me. And I jumped and I broke my nose and I bled in the street and the tram\nwent further. And Blancka later came out on the stop and she found me lying in the street bleeding,\nwent to a pharmacy, I broke my nose. We couldn\u2019t go to a doctor, you were afraid. You were\nafraid of those Polish doctors too, and rightly so. I recovered, and then the same happened over and\nover again. Stel-ma Hov-en-jev-ens (ph), the book about the story about Stel-ma Hovich (ph), his\nbrother by the way just published a fantastic memoir on the Holocaust, not to be missed. I'll give\nyou later the full title of it, I spoke to him on the telephone. Stel-ma Hovich (ph) survived to\nbecome a big shot in Soviet occupied Poland as a chief bookkeeper for the government. He met my\nsister, he told her that I might be alive, he wasn\u2019t sure. That from that house people were taken to\nGermany, he wasn\u2019t sure. He later found his brother, the brother that has that fantastic story about\nhe and his brother ran away from Treblinka. He later joined his brother in Italy. A woman with\nwhom he was involved rejected him, that was how the story goes, he came to Italy. He was\ndepressed, he committed suicide. That was Stel-ma Hovich (ph), you ought to read the book, it\u2019s a\nfantastic memoir. But this was one later of how other people working in this place were Jewish,\nBlancka recognized someone from her home town. They were all afraid of me because I\nmasqueraded as a main of the worst background, worth Polish background, they were afraid of me.\nBut she told Stel-ma Hovich (ph) and a certain, years later, but anyway. So to move from it, one\nday, a man that I had seen in Germany, and Blancka made very good strudels, oh, there is\nsomething? To stop?",
        "A: That\u2019s all we have?",
        "A: For the rest of my story?",
        "A: Oh, good, fine. This man like her strudel and he offered to take her to Heidelburg to be a maid\nfor his family. Blancka decided to go.",
        "A: Sure. There was somebody in our house who was always under, always live under disguise. I\nforgot her name now, but she introduced us to Hele-inka (ph) and Bowl-ick (ph) and they loved our\nplace because it was a safe place in a German neighborhood, German people living in it, so\noccasionally they would come up. Particularly when the people for whom we worked were in\nGermany and the place was closed. On a Sunday, they would come up and they would teach us to\nsing partisan songs, from the Bont (ph), I couldn\u2019t believe it, the whole thing! I say this was the\nhappiest days in my life during the Holocaust because I felt, I didn\u2019t feel the fear, I didn\u2019t feel the\nfear at all, I just felt the sense of resistance. And I think if I\u2019m not mistaken, Blancka once brought\nsome documents for children because it was such a safe place, so we had all of the\ntime.",
        "A: Latka-mead (ph), I think she brought some documents for children into our old room but I\u2019m not\nsure, at this point Bowl-ick (ph) and Hele-inka (ph) were very much a part of our lives and Henrich\n(ph), he died later. There was another man who wrote the beautiful memoir of , Bear\nWitness, Bernard (ph). He too was involved in some way. So it was like I knew life, an\nunbelievable kind of new life where we felt even if we died there was a resistance. The Germans\nare losing. So Sunday afternoon, occasionally, these people were away, they would come and we\nwould listen to the in British radio, which was certainly not permitted. And we would sing these\nsongs and one day, against our expectations, these people, the Germans, come back earlier from a\nweekend. They use to go to Berlin, come back earlier for a weekend and here is this group, we are\nsinging and they\u2019re listening to the British radio. Well, that fright was unbelievable, but they\nwalked in. We hid these people under our beds, we finally got them out, it wasn\u2019t so simple. We\nhad many such occasions where we smuggled people in and then we had to offer them under the\nbed to a hiding place, and then to smuggle out through the door, all of these things were extremely\nanxiety provoking. Scenarios, but they were a part of our life at that point. Until the man came\nsaying he was taking Blancka to Germany if she wants to go and she registered for a trip, the\nseparation was very difficult for us. I remember, we went to Bowl-ick\u2019s (ph) home for a sort of a\nparty, a get away party, and when I walked out of the party I was drunk and I kept saying in the\ntram, I\u2019m Jewish, that\u2019s all I needed to say. And they following day she left and I was left alone, it\nwas a terrible loss for me naturally, but she, we thought about the past, how to join her, everything\nwas very uncertain.",
        "A: Extremely important to have another body. Not to be alone. Being alone, being isolated was\none of the great dangers. You just couldn\u2019t hardly survive without having someone with you. I\nremember days when I was very much isolated whenever things happened. Blancka had to run, I\nhad to run you know? It was, it felt, you really couldn\u2019t live through it. But when Blancka left, it\nwas a great loss to me. We maintained correspondence in some way, she was able to write from\nGermany, and there was always some hope that perhaps I'll find myself there, although I didn\u2019t\nbelieve it. She encouraged me to go but how could I go? For me the greatest danger was to go to\nthe official employment bureau to ask for a job because to go to Germany you had to apply for a job\nthere. There had to be proof for a job there. For me just to show myself, show my face in these\noffices was very dangerous. So we maintained our contact mainly through correspondence at that\npoint, but until then, we were extremely inter-dependent. Her looks were helpful, I had more sense\nof danger I think, of reality, I was quick this way for some reason. I think we complemented each\nother very well this way, but we were very close to each other and as I say, we were intimate in our\nrelationship and I knew of the losses she suffered. She knew very much of my family life. She\ntried to steal some oranges in the hospital to bring to Lash-ick (ph) so we were very intertwined,\nextremely so. And her absence left a tremendous void in my life, but more than that, a sense of\ndanger too, that I\u2019m all alone here. I had no idea the war was coming to an end. Coming back to it,\nI remember Bowl-ick (ph) and Helene Ko-vet-all-lich-al (ph) and Lod-ja (ph), we had intermittent\ncontact. From the time she had left until I joined her wasn\u2019t that long. I\u2019m trying to remember, I\ncan\u2019t remember exactly when she left but somehow within the next few months the Germans started\nrunning. We heard about it, that the Soviets are approaching. Even before that, Blancka and I\ncelebrated each victory on the part of the Soviets. At one point, we heard that Kolomyja was\nliberated and this came through the radio, the British radio, no, another city, I\u2019m sorry. On the\nBritish radio, on that radio we heard it later in Germany. So we celebrated each time, quietly. We\nhad such a double life, an official life and a life between each other. We were extremely close, I\nwould say, in a very intimate kind of relationship. We maintained it later for many decades too.\nBut when she left, it was pretty, I did have some correspondence, I heard a little of it, that she was\nworking in a household there. She didn\u2019t seem to be in danger of any kind, danger of detection. It\nwas very soon afterwards we heard rumors that the Soviets are approaching, they are taking over\nlarge parts of Poland, the eastern part. And one day, I remember, the German family for whom I\nworked just took off to their town in Germany and they didn\u2019t come back. And within a few days,\nthe office workers also left. And then I was all alone when I heard that the Soviets are approaching\nWarsaw, they\u2019re in Prague, in the suburb of Prague. Being all alone, the telephone stopped\nworking, I would have like to call Lodz, I would like to call Helena but I couldn\u2019t, but I was all\nalone, I figured, well, in a few hours or so the Soviets are going to be here, so walk out of the\napartment. This was a German section, the Germans were not there anymore. There were Poles,\nand I knew the Soviets are coming in. I didn\u2019t really think about my sister, Frania, she was involved\nwith the child, I didn\u2019t know about Menek, although we did have some intermittent communication.\nAt one point, pretty much everything stopped, we didn\u2019t know. But I knew that I\u2019m going to be free\nin a few hours. But the Soviets did not come in. And I was all alone in that big apartment, not\nunderstanding why they take so much time. The following morning, I began to hear some shooting.\nI later found out there was an uprising, the Poles started an uprising against the Soviets. This was\nbeyond my belief! Well, before I knew, the Germans were coming back and the Poles seemed to be\nfighting both the Germans and the Soviets. I walked out in the street to see what\u2019s happening, I was\nterribly isolated by then. I saw people running. All the Polish people from the neighborhoods were\nrunning. I joined them, I didn\u2019t know why people were running. And so we kept running, we\nmoved slowly into sewers. Suddenly I\u2019m in sewers. And then the Polish people began to talk about\nwhat happened. That there was an uprising, that the Soviets didn\u2019t come tn, that the Germans are\nback. And that the city is being burned down. Well, I didn\u2019t feel a minute anymore about being,\nthe part about being Jewish. This did not, somehow or other, I can\u2019t remember, that Helin-ka (ph)\nand BowIl-ick (ph) joined me. I think we ran together but this is what I\u2019d like know, to see Helin-ka\n(ph) to find out these details. I don\u2019t remember whether we, how many days we were in the sewers,\nbut it seemed like an eternity naturally. And from time to time, the sewer door would open and you\ncould see a street and you could hear some shooting and then it would close again and we were\nagain in the sewers. I don\u2019t remember how we were fed but somebody, there was some crumbs of\nfood going around.",
        "A: In the water, that high up. And these were not the sewers of the ghetto, these were the sewers of\nthe city of Warsaw, Polish people. Some were in uniforms, some were civilians, all age groups. I\ndidn\u2019t know how far we were going, what it was I thought a day, but it was more than a day\ndefinitely. It was a good many days, the idea was, I found out later, that we will be going up to the\nvestibular where we will get out and get a boat to go to the Soviets, to Prague. Finally we arrived at\nthe vestibular and Bowl-ick (ph) and Hel-inka (ph) and I, by the way, we wrapped around ourselves\na blanket so we wouldn\u2019t be separated because there were lots of people there, we were afraid we\nwould be torn apart. And to come out in that bright sunshine, this was September of 1944, August,\nend of August, beginning of September, 1944. And we tried to get into a boat, there were many\npeople coming out of the sewers, and we see the city is pretty much in flames, and we try to get on a\nboat. We cannot get in, it\u2019s filled, Bowl-ick (ph) got on the boat, Hel-inka (ph) and I still waited for\nanother boat to come. The Soviets are right across the vestibular, some people were trying to swim\nit. Suddenly from no where the Germans appeared, the vestibular is at the bottom of the city. The\nimportant part of the hill, the old city. Suddenly, there are Germans in the old city and\nfrom no where I feel a bullet in my back. They shot me through my coat, I was in a coat, and I\u2019m\nbleeding. And the same bullet goes into the arm of Hel-inka (ph). I fell to the ground, she didn\u2019t I\nthink. I was pretty unconscious, I was bleeding. And then they have us get up, I still don\u2019t\nunderstand how it was possible for me to be bleeding and get up, and we are being marched. We\nwere apparently, I found out later, the last group of the Polish uprisers. And they are dragging us\nthrough the city of Warsaw. We see the city in flames, and they are dragging me, I can hardly drag.\nAnd all of us have to put out a handkerchief or something to show to the Germans our surrender.\nWe had to show something white, flags we didn\u2019t have, so everybody raises a hand with a little shirt\nor something, we\u2019re surrendering. I couldn\u2019t walk, people helped me or what, I don\u2019t remember.\nAll I recall, at one point, I was extremely thirsty, probably from loss of blood, and I bent down to\npick up an apple. Poland is full of orchards, of apple orchards, 1t was the season for it. I tried to get\nan apple into my mouth and a German soldier hits me right in my back, march! He didn\u2019t know I\nwas Jewish, but then I was totally unafraid of being detected as a Jew. I was a Pole. They marched\nus to a place outside of town called Poroskov. In Poroskov they had a special detention camp for all\nthe Poles who fought in the uprising and other Poles too. Lodz eventually was in Poroskov too but I\ndidn\u2019t know at that time. I was so sick that I wish I knew these details because I didn\u2019t function\nmentally anymore. But I recall waking up, there are somehow or other bodies on top of me. It was\nso crowded there that they pushed people, we fell asleep and the bodies, somehow or other I\nsneaked out of it. Before I know it, I was on some transport being marched again to a place to be, to\na place to be, anti-loused, means cleaned of lice, a de-lousing station. And then they put us on a\ntrain and I\u2019m on a train with Hel-linka (ph) holding onto each other and with lots of other Poles.\nPolish families, not children, Polish men. On that train, and by then it is September I know, on the\ntrain were the only two women and the men are all in Polish uniforms, they were fighters. The train\nwas moving very slowly, I had no idea where we were moving, we fall asleep all of us. Sometime\nin the middle of the night, or 1t was very early morning, one of the fighters wakes up and he starts\ntalking to the other one, the Jews brought all the tragedy and the Jews will take over Poland because\nof the Soviets and they got us into all that trouble. And one of these guys looks at the other and\nsays, you know what, these two girls across from us, they look Jewish. You better tell. By then it\nwas about four in the morning or so and it was just light, it was just coming, and then they fell\nasleep. And without saying another word to Hel-linka (ph), we motioned to each other that we\u2019re\ngoing to jump from the train. I\u2019m sure that the motivation was not to escape from that, the\nmotivation I believe, but I\u2019m not sure, was to just die. Before these Germans come to take us. We\nunderstood by then that the train was being shipped out to Stutthof, which was a detention camp\nwhere Polish people were shipped in order to work for the Germans. And we knew the beginning\nof the day will bring the greatest horrors to us when the Germans arrived to take us out. So without\nsaying a word to each other, the window was open, the train was moving very slowly, I can\u2019t\nremember who jumped first. And I can\u2019t remember anything else except that I wake up in the home\nof a Polish woman in a town called Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph). I never heard of the town,\nit\u2019s south of Warsaw. These women had attended me, given me a clean bed, attended to my\nwounds, told me the story of what happened after I woke up. I don\u2019t know, it was a few days that I\nwas pretty unconscious. She said that when we jumped out a priest thought we were dead. He was\ngoing to the cemetery to bury some body, he saw these two girls from the Warsaw uprising, so he\nfigured he\u2019s going to bury us, with a decent Catholic burial. When he noted that we were breathing.\nSo first he buried these people who he meant to bury, then he brought us to this Polish woman on\nthe outskirts of Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph). Poor woman but a very decent soul. She was\nvery happy to be able to be of service to these Polish revolutionaries, the Poles who fought, the\nPolish fighters who fought for independence of Warsaw. So she treated us beautifully, I could see\nhow poor she was but she treated us extremely well, and one day a neighbor comes in and she opens\nthe door to our room and she wants to tell him, these are two girls who were in the Polish resistance\nmovement. He takes a look at us and he says, she look Jewish. That night, Hel-linka (ph) was sick\nof me because she looked Polish, she said good-bye to me and I haven\u2019t seen her until years after\nthe war. I saw her again about two years after the war. Hel-linka (ph) had blue eyes and she was\nblonde and she wanted out. I stayed on, I didn\u2019t know what to do. The Polish woman was\nabsolutely an angel, she said you have to go, you can\u2019t be here. She wrapped up for me half her\nbread in a kerchief and two apples and early morning I leave. I didn\u2019t know where I was going but,\nit didn\u2019t matter. At that time, nothing mattered anymore. I knew I wasn\u2019t afraid at all because I\nwasn\u2019t Jewish anymore, nobody would think of me as Jewish at that point. Poland was falling\napart. I kept walking, so I walked into town.",
        "A: That man noticed, but on the whole people were already running and life didn\u2019t matter to me. I\nwas all alone, I was wounded, I had a pain in my back. I had nothing. I didn\u2019t know where to go, I\ndon\u2019t think I had documents at that point because I was running in the sewers, I don\u2019t remember\nwhat happened. And I don\u2019t remember because I was on the high fever. So I walk into that town, I\nsee Thom-ma-sla-sov-en-sky (ph), I never heard of it before, there are two Thom-ma-slick\u2019s (ph),\none is\nthe other is the home of Rabbi Lowengers (ph) brother. They preeminently gave\ntestimony about their experiences as children in camps. So I walk in, I hardly walk, but I walk with\nthe apples and the bread. I see an apothecary for pharmacy. European pharmacies are very\ndifferent than ours, they\u2019re very formal. I had nothing to loose, I walk in, I say I am a, I ran away\nfrom the uprising, I fought in the uprising because this was my new identity. The man, and I know\na little bit about pharmacological work because my husband was a pharmacist, I use to help him, he\nis delighted to see me, he says. Well, first I wanted to rest up, I wanted to meet my family,\ntomorrow you come to work. You can do bottles, you can wash up, fine. He sends me upstairs to\nhis family, a nice home they made, his wife was charming to me, the maid makes a luxurious bed\nfor me, I felt so guilty to get into that bed with beautifully clean linen. I haven\u2019t seen that in a long\ntime, starched linen I remember. And they invite me for dinner and everything\u2019s fine. And I sleep\nthrough the night and in the morning the maid comes in saying, she\u2019s very sorry but her landlady\ntold her how sorry she was but I cannot stay here any longer. I think, ah-oh, they discovered where\nI was. So I say, what happened? She says, in the morning when you got up I made the bed, I\nnoticed there were lice in your bed. And my landlady says you should go because you were\nwounded. You should go to the clinic to clean out your wound. Well, I still remember laughing to\nmyself, lice! Anything is better than being discovered as a Jew! I dragged myself to that clinic and\nthey started working on me and the doctor without any anesthesia they cleaned my wound, it was\nextremely painful I remember. I screamed from pain. And they took out the lice, they cleaned me\nout totally. And I hear the nurse saying to the doctor, you know, she looks Jewish. Here I\u2019m in the\nhospital, in the emergency room. Nothing happened and nothing mattered at that point, I walked\nout, I knew I was bandaged. I didn\u2019t have lice. I figured should I go back there, it\u2019s really not the\nplace for me to go back, I\u2019m afraid. By then it was very late evening, I was extremely tired. I was\nstill so very sick. I ate those apples and the rest of the bread and I stretched out on a bench. It was a\ncold night, it was by then I think the end of September, beginning of October. It was raining,\ndrizzling, and I fell asleep and nothing matters. Sometime in the middle of the night, somebody\npushes me. I open my eyes. A German soldier, a German policeman. Come, he says to me. I\nwasn\u2019t afraid. He didn\u2019t know in the middle of the night that I was Jewish or anything, he was\ncollecting all these homeless people to ship them out to Germany. So he brings me again to a place\nfor cleaning, de-lousing, clean, I walk out clean. I think they gave me something fresh to wear, I\ndon\u2019t remember. And he brings me to an assembly hall where there are lots of Polish women. All\nthese women, collected from the street, are being shipped to Germany to work. By then the\nGermans were loosing the war, their men where coming home on crutches. Their women were sent\nto the front to work. They didn\u2019t have enough workers so they were collecting Polish people all\nover. I\u2019m among Poles, therefore nobody knows I\u2019m Jewish. But, we get on a train, and then the\nman who is a greeter tells us we are going to go to Germany to work but before we do we are going\nto stop in Pat-o-vich-a (ph), which is a border town which by then was Germany. And he takes us\nout and he says, I want you to sit in this corner, we were a few hundred people by then, to sit in this\ncorner and to wait for the evening. We are going to take an evening train and I\u2019Il come back in the\nevening. We know you\u2019ll sit and rest here, will being some food. I took a look at the group and I\ndidn\u2019t know whether I looked at them or they looked at me but it didn\u2019t look to me kosher that I\ncould survive with these Polish groups. So I said, if I have to be back and see if I could walk away\na little bit, so I walked away. And here I could see Germany falling apart. Many Polish people of\nGerman extraction, falk-stoich-er (ph), are coming into the station. They are running from the\nSoviets. And at the station there are many soup kitchens supervised by German nurses, like the\nGerman Red Cross. So I hear their story about how the Soviets are after them, how they ran away\nfrom rape and all kinds of things, so I figured, I\u2019m also falk-stoich-er (ph), why not? I speak\nGerman better than they. So I go over and I ask for soup and I tell them that I\u2019m running from the\nSoviets so they give me one cup of soup and another cup of soup and a third cup of soup. I\nremember milk so distinctly, finally I am full, ?ve eaten good food. And this is a Sunday afternoon\nI believe and I walk out of the station. Pat-o-vich-a (ph) is not touched, it 1s a German city, it\u2019s an\nindustrial city, it was the biggest textile city after Manchester, I knew about it. And I see the stores\nfull of fabrics, I couldn\u2019t believe what\u2019s going on here. I came from the ashes, literally from the\nashes of Poland. And I walk and I don\u2019t know where to walk, I figure I have to walk away from\nthat Polish group. Let\u2019s see if I can get to Heidleburg because I\u2019m wanted in Germany, and since\neverybody\u2019s running. I\u2019m not Jewish, everybody\u2019s running, the German, the falk-stoich-er (ph) are\nrunning, the Poles are running. The Poles couldn\u2019t run they are too but the\nGermans were running from their home. So I see a Hitler parade, and believe it or not, this is the\nfunniest thing in my life! I joined the Hitler parade and I go like this, Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!\n. First they had soldiers in brown shoes, but then people talked, it was Sunday\nafternoon, I think it was for Hitler\u2019s birthday, I\u2019m not sure, but it was a special occasion. So I\nwalked with them until the evening, then they disperse.",
        "A: Oh, I was so exhilarated. I was absolutely exhilarated. Imagine me to join a Hitler parade! I\u2019m\nin Germany! This still brings to me laughter whenever I think about that moment! How did I do it,\nbut what else could I do? I was in the safest place to be for me. In a Hitler parade! I\u2019m together\nwith all these Germans saluting the flag and all the things, and there are speeches and so on. Many\nhours pass and the evening comes and they begin to disperse, so I have no place to go. I figured\nthese Poles must have left, but I\u2019m not sure. So I circle around the station. I wasn\u2019t afraid because\npeople were on the march by then you see. They were refugees. This was the best feeling for me. I\ncome back, indeed, the people are gone. So I take a look, what am I going to do? Now I'll try to\nget on a train and find my way to Heidleburg, I knew Blancka was there. I had some idea of where,\nthe place where people from Bolm-sukkot (ph) worked. I got to, it\u2019s late evening by then, I get on a\ntrain and I suddenly notice the military train from Russia, the Germans, all military, I\u2019m the only\nwoman. I say, oh, that\u2019s very dangerous, so I hide in the restroom. In an hour or so, they need the\nrestroom and start yelling to get out, I get out, they look at me, and by sheer luck because I have to\nthink it was luck you know, the train stops. It was the city of Dresden. So I walk out at the station\nand the train goes away, it goes wherever they went. I walk, it was very quiet I remember. It was\nby then, was morning, early morning hours. I walk into town and I sit down in a cafe, I didn\u2019t have\nmoney but I figure I would sit down, rest stop. And so the new bombs came. This was the great\nbombing of Dresden, it was an earlier bombing. You see R-A-F, this was the British Air Force.\nThe best feeling in this world, that I\u2019m going to die of a bomb, what can be better? I remember\neven bombs in Warsaw. At one point, the British were bombing Warsaw and I stayed in a\nhousehold there, not with the Germans, it was in a Polish place, I had a furnished room, and people\nwere running to shelter. So these people called me, come! Come with us to the shelter! And I did\neverything possible not to go to the shelter, I wanted to be killed by a bomb. Couldn\u2019t be a better\ndeath. And I recall doing this, putting my feet up and my head into my legs, hoping that when a\nbomb kills me that it will kill all of me rather than just some legs or the head separates. This was\nmy dream, to be killed that way. I really didn\u2019t want to live, so when people say they tried to\nsurvive, they wanted to live, I really didn\u2019t want to live but I didn\u2019t want to die detected by the\nGermans. I was afraid of that death. But I\u2019ve seen before how people were killed and their leg was\nhung there and I was there and this to me was a horror, so I remember that night of bombing. I\ndidn\u2019t go to the shelter but I waited for the bomb, the bomb didn\u2019t come to me. So this is Desden,\nand I sit in a cafe and the second floor of that cafe 1s coming down and I\u2019m sitting there literally,\nseeing the bombs, and things happen, it\u2019s like an earth-sukkotke, you know? It sounds like an earth-\nsukkotke. And I see many people are dead in the street and here I walk out alive. I was meant to\nlive and that\u2019s all they can say, why I wasn\u2019t killed I don\u2019t know. So hours later, I walked down to\nthe railway station. I still have in mind if I\u2019m alive I want to go to Heidleburg, so I get a train. It\nwas some sort of a civilian train. Nobody looked at documents, nobody looked at tickets, 1t was so\nchaotic. It was mainly refugees from the falk-stoic-er (ph), from everywhere, and Germans too\nfrom the cities, there were bombs, they were moving west, that\u2019s how it was going. But mainly\nfrom the eastern part of Germany, which was originally Poland. Finally I see this train stops at\nFrankfurt and before I get out bombs come over Frankfurt, this was a little bit too much,\nunbelievable. But this was the time of the greatest bombing of Germany. So the railway station is\nall in fire again and many passengers walk out alive and many passengers are killed right there.\nAnd I\u2019m alive. It\u2019s fantastic! So I figured, now I have to go from Frankfurt to Heidleburg, certainly\nno trains anymore, the railway station is all in flames. I see people walking, I follow them, they are\nwalking to the highway to hitchhike. So I hitchhike too, I\u2019m a German you know! I\u2019m a falk-\nstoich-er (ph), poor, dear soul. I\u2019m better qualified to be falk-stoich-er (ph) than anybody else here\nbecause those who live for generations in Poland is falk-stoich-er (ph), that and German, they didn\u2019t\nspeak German they didn\u2019t know a thing. I\u2019m certainly much more , SO I go with them.\nAnd they start hitchhiking, so I get on a truck, I remember the truck goes only a little place, he\nleaves me there, I had to hitchhike again. Must have been six modes of transportation, finally a\ntrain goes somewhere between Mannheim and Heidleburg. I arrive at Heidleburg, I arrive intact in\nHeidleburg. I walk into the ladies room to wash up and I wash up and I look in the mirror and I see\na chimney behind me, a chimney sweep, and I figure how does a man come into this? I look\naround, he\u2019s gone. So, I wash my hands again, I look again and I see the chimney sweep is back!\nAnd I look back, it\u2019s not a chimney sweep. What happened? I did this with my hands and I noticed\nit was me, not a chimney sweep! I was so black, I was so totally black covered with soot. And it\nwas my face, it was not a chimney sweep. . I wash my face, I suddenly had a\nface and it was me. I still have that sense of terror in me when I think about it. I walk out, the city\nis normal and beautiful and it was the month of October. And in Poland, October as you recall here\nis lovely, the weather is lovely, it\u2019s not cold. I\u2019m without stockings and wooden shoes and the coat\nthrough which went the bullet. And I walk and I cannot believe my eyes. And I see some Germans,\nformer soldiers on crutches, a few women. And I just keep walking towards the necht-a-some-a-\nrisa (ph) because in walking toward the station\u2019s center, usually it goes down the center of the street,\nyou just walk. Here I see the neck-er (ph) and I figure how can I find out where Blancka is? I\nremember the name of her employer. So I stop a little girl and I say to her, do you know Mr. Alber\n(ph)? And she says, My papa! Like that. There are miracles in this world. My papa! She takes me\nby my hand and she brings me to Blancka. Blancka nearly fainted when she saw me the way I\nlooked. She took me to the basement to wash me up and put something around my wounds, I was\nnot in such good sukkotpe yet, and she figured I should wait a few days before I go to work. She\nhad meanwhile arranged for me to work for a couple, for a family, in the neighborhood. This was\nno one else but Professor A-had-es (ph), he was a dean of the medical school in Heidleburg. A high\nranking German official in a uniform, he was about 7\u2019 tall. He has a wife with four children, a\nstunning house, absolutely beautiful house. There were bedrooms and attics. They hired me on the\nspot, I started working. The work was impossible for me, I was not well yet you see? And they\ngave me an attic room. I had to get the children, clean everything, there were many floors there,\nbeautiful, their house. And in the morning I would have to get the children to school, each child\nleaving for school with the, Heil Hitler, Maria! This was the greeting, the morning greeting. The\nlady of the house was sort of neutral. She didn\u2019t trust me with cooking, there was nothing to cook.\nIt was toward the end of the war, the Germans had very little, but they had a garden. Everyday, I\nhad to go to the garden and dig out potatoes and leek. And everyday, we had an elegant lunch of\npotatoes and leeks. I would scrape it off, prepare it, but she would cook it because you put a little\nbit butter and a little flour and make it look like more of a meal. It was served in beautiful porcelain\nwith silverware, you would never think what you were eating, it was great food. Everyday the same\nuntil the end of the war. We had all, for getting rations of food. Everybody was assigned that many\ngrams of bread, so I had a little. He registered me as a falk-stoich-er (ph), which was great. So\nwhich means I was entitled to a little bit more bread. So, I would get whatever amount of bread,\njust a little bit less than they did. On Sunday, everybody had pork. A roast of pork and the\nProfessor would slice it, trying to be fair to everyone. Then he would slice a somewhat thinner part,\nthis 1s for Maria! He didn\u2019t know much German, I knew, because just spoke it haltingly in a way,\nbecause she gets a little less. But, I still had a portion. This was one soup, they didn\u2019t have either,\nexcept that he went a few times to Yugoslavia on trips. And he would bring some peaches from\nthere and he brought some assortment of foods. Well, this household was a very elegant household.\nThey would have culture evenings, evenings of culture. At which point they would invite about 20,\n30 people like a symphony orchestra they would play. These were doctors most of them, famous\nlawyers, jewelers, you know? And I would set up the chairs and everybody would get a little bit\ncoffee or something but everything was very elegant. The setting was always very elegant. One\nday, he comes home from one of his sudden trips and he brings some very special food and the lady\nwraps it up on a tray and she says to me to go to that neighbor, to bring a present from the El-hades\n(ph) family. I walk there, one of the most stunning houses I\u2019ve ever seen, I couldn\u2019t believe the\ngarden at that house. I ring the bell and the maid says, no, no, the maid\u2019s entrance is through the\nkitchen. I come into the kitchen and I leave that present. Then I find out who now was this family,\nwas Speer. Albert Speer\u2019s parents. I didn\u2019t know. They gave me the name Speer, the name Speer\ndidn\u2019t mean anything to me. They want the movement between history and personal experience but\nthat\u2019s true for all survivors. Well, it was an extremely beautiful neighborhood, something like our\nScotishville (ph), a very fine section of the city. And Blancka worked in her household and I\nworked in mine. For me the work was unbelievably heavy, I couldn\u2019t do it. I just didn\u2019t have the\nstrength of rolling out these very heavy rugs, carpets. Putting them on the snow and beating them\non the snow because most Europeans believed that when you beat these heavy carpets on the snow\nthat they get special treatment. To roll it up, to carry it from this, one day I remember I saw planes,\nallied planes flying over, very much over me. I could nearly talk to them, I felt it was so, but I felt\nthat day I remember, gee, the Americans are coming, or the British, or whoever it was, but I won\u2019t\nlive to see them, I was so sick of work, I was so tired of work. One day I fell off the stairway, they\nhad stairways to different floors. And I ripped my face and I think I had a few days of rest and a\nhospital, the best time of my life! I needed the rest so bad. To dig out in the cold snow, to dig out\npotatoes everyday. To take care of four children. To do the laundry. To clean the house. To beat\nthose carpets. All of this was a little bit too much for one person. Blancka was with six children\nand the German lord\u2019s point was if a woman has a family of six children they were entitled to one\nand a half help. If they had four children you were entitled to a foreign worker, I was a foreign\nworker. If you had eight children you were entitled to two, if you had six you were entitled to one\nand a half. So Blancka had another half there, that half later we found out was also Jewish. She still\nlives in Tacoma, Washington, I knew her. Blancka and I were very closely related in terms of our\ndays off. Our day off was Wednesday afternoon and occasionally we would go to the University,\nsneak in, but most of the time we would go to this beautiful forest because their houses, the suburb\nwas in forest. Most beautiful section of the city. There was a lovely cafe called Bros-pron-eur (ph).\nIt was cut out of an idyllic kind of a place. It wasn\u2019t true, it wasn\u2019t possible. That is the place when\nwe heard that the Germans have plans, according to their plans that they withdrew, they withdrew\nfrom our home town. These were the news we would get, we knew that they were loosing. But it\nwas still very much inside Germany and little by little I felt I probably will not survive the heavy\nlabor. I was not afraid of being detected because I was only afraid of the Poles, I was not, the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t know the difference, that\u2019s a fact. But going down to market for them and all\nthese things, it was uphill, it was very difficult to carry all of that. But I thought I would survive the\nwar if I could survive my health. I couldn\u2019t take that heavy labor. Well, one day, the man of the\nhouse comes in and he says, it looks as though there is some fighting going on, we would be better\noff being in the basement at night. Not to stay above because you could see all the airplanes. I\ndidn\u2019t listen to the radio, I didn\u2019t know much, but I got it from their faces that things are not going\nwell for the Germans. I didn\u2019t know how close. So he said that night we should stay in the\nbasement. So we all go down to the basement and sometime early morning I see this man, who\nalways wore the high military uniform, he use to be in Berlin with Hitler, you know, he was a very\nbig shot. But he\u2019s in his civilian clothes, it hangs on him it just looks like a diminished man. And\nhe drive out of the garage with this car and the car has a little white flag. And I still don\u2019t\nunderstand what was going on. Later in the morning, he comes back with a little bandage over his\nhand, he was wounded slightly in the street fight. He and the mayor of the city and somebody else\nwent to Mannheim to surrender the city of Heidleburg to the Americans. That\u2019s a great moment, I\nhave to celebrate.",
        "A: Okay. It\u2019s one of the joys, memories. I couldn\u2019t believe it. He came back and within hours we\nheard some people were moving, rushing, we went down to the highway, we saw American tanks\nrolling. You couldn\u2019t see anybody, you just saw the tanks, they were closed up. Blancka and I\nstand next to the fields and suddenly one of the roofs of the tanks opens up and a young soldier,\nAmerican soldier, in Yiddish which he thought was German, so he says, Fraulines! Fraulines!\nFraulines! We had to make now, Munich, he wanted the road. So we hear this German Jewish and\nto say, Yidden! Yidden! Yidden! We\u2019re Jews! Well he is, but he has to keep rolling, so he throws\nus two cartons of cigarettes, of the cigarettes the war was over, you know? Well, I go back and I\nfigure this the end of my working for the Germans. Although the war was still going on, but I\u2019m\nnot going back to work there. I went back and I refused to work, but I still have my little room. So,\nHerr Professor in his civilian outfit by then, it was like a diminished man, an unbelievable change,\nwhat happens to the uniform, the high ranking uniform when you have to leave it? He comes up,\nthe Herr Professor, this is his wife, he sends her up to talk to me. And he wants me, he\u2019s concerned\nthat his wife said I\u2019m not working. And that he wants me to, he wants to know what my plans are.\nI say, I don\u2019t know, I guess Pll go back to Poland. So he says, you know what? It\u2019s not so good for\nyou to go back to Poland. After all you're an ethnic German, the Poles may not treat you so well. I\nsaid, Pll take a chance. He says, but I have a better plan for you. Here in the village is a mort-k-eye\n(ph), a store of smoke products. I have contacts there, they know me well, they will arrange for you\nto be a sales girl there. You will have a . And he notice along these lines and I figure\nI\u2019m crossing inside and finally I say to him, Herr Professor, you know what? I\u2019m neither falk-\nstoich-er (ph), nor Polish, \u2019m a Jew! And tall as the man 1s, he stretches out on the floor and\nfainted! And my floor was smooth because it was a maid\u2019s room, an attic maid\u2019s room. Well, he\nrevived. He went down, this was the end of my job. No more talking about jobs or anything. I\ndon\u2019t know how they dealt with that news, I have no idea because I realized at that point the danger\nsoon to be there. Although the Germans occupied the city by then, I didn\u2019t know how much they\noccupied. They were marching.",
        "A: The Americans, yes. So I figured something may happen. A night or two nights before, he\nwanted me to dig a hole in the garden where he put some guns. He hid guns there. And Blanca\u2019s\npeople hid wine. Bottles of wine. They were prepared for the Americans, you know, so the\nAmericans may want, he hid guns there. And I figured it\u2019s not good for me to be there at this point.\nWe didn\u2019t know where to go. I said to Blancka, I say, I\u2019m not working anymore. She says, I\u2019m not\nworking either. We go down to look at these tanks and the tanks keep rolling, but we have no\nmoney, there\u2019s no money, there\u2019s nothing to buy. We went into town, everything is closed.\nHeidelburg 1s totally closed up, not one store is open. And so we decided to live in these fields near\nthe highway. We slept there and we ate grass. I\u2019ll never forget after the war, the first few days we\nate grass. It\u2019s hard to believe it. We decided not to go back. And there was nothing to do but on\nthe third day I think we realized perhaps we could do something with these cigarettes. So we\nwalked into town and indeed, we knocked at the doors and we told, cigarettes, cigarettes, trading\nsomething, and they gave us some food. Finally we found our way to a place, an American Red\nCross club. That place was to serve donuts and coffee to American soldiers. It must have been\nwithin a week or two, I don\u2019t remember. We told the guys that we were Jewish and that we were\nslave laborers here and could they do something for us, could they give us a job? They agreed to\nhave us serve the boys. So if I speak English in a funny way, that\u2019s the place where I picked up my\nEnglish. I never went to school, this was my school. I served coffee and donuts and Blancka too.\nWas a great life. We got a furnished room because for the donuts we were able to trade. We\nbrought dozens of donuts to a place where they had a furnished room all ready. Then we decided\nwe need to learn English. So we went to a German woman who was a teacher of English. Gave her\na dozen of donuts and she taught us English. To the beauty parlor for donuts, everything was for\ndonuts because there was no food and we had access to as many donuts as we wanted to. So this\nput us on our feet. One day, a man comes in, in an outfit from Auschwitz, I didn\u2019t know about\nAuschwitz, I had no idea where he was from, but he wore one of these pajamas and he told us he\nwas in Auschwitz, told us his story. And he says, he needs to talk to the military governor, he needs\nsome document to go and find his wife, but he doesn\u2019t speak English. So I said, I speak English, I'll\ntake you there. I come to the military governor and he has refugee assistant and I interpret for this\nman and the military governor turns to his assistant and says, what language does she speak? That\nwas my English. I stopped going for English lessons to this woman, she taught me in a way that\nwas no English! I thought I spoke English. Slowly I learned the language and slowly a man came\nin from underground, Mr. Volinger (ph), and he started helping us in whatever way. Eventually,\nthey organized, the American Red Cross organized a transport of trucks to go to Trencin-sch-stat\n(ph) and to bring back the Jews from Heidleburg, from, and they were inthe \u2014_\u2014_\u2014_\u2014._Heidleburg,\nFrankfort, Manchester, some other towns, Offenbach. And they ask if anybody speaks Russian, I\nvolunteer to speak Russian. So they attach me, they put me in a uniform, some American soldiers\nuniform, and I go with them to Trencin-sch-stat (ph) and I say, before you go we have to cross\nRussian borders. We have to take cha-socks (ph), watches and a lot of Vodka. They don\u2019t\nunderstand, I say, trust me. That is what we will need. Well, the minute we cross the border into\nCzechoslovakia, they immediately saw these soldiers and they don\u2019t let us through. We need a\nstamp and that stamp, a round stamp, a green stamp. I say, don\u2019t bother with them, just give them\nthe cha-socks (ph), well, they salute us, we go further. We get to Karlsbad, where my sister use to\nlive. We come there, they cannot let us through because we don\u2019t have the right kind of a stamp.\nWe have a square stamp, they want a round stamp. And I say, where is your supervisor? Oh, he\u2019s\ntaking a bath. A bath? We\u2019ll wait. They say, oh no, he likes to be in the spa the whole day and the\nwhole night. So, I figure that\u2019s no way, this cost a lot of Vodka and cha-socks (ph), but we went\nfurther. Finally, it was evening, we arrive in Tilsit-en-shot (ph), it\u2019s high up. This scene I'll never\nforget again. We come with a convoy of trucks, of busses actually. And we had a list of people\nwho were deported to Trencin-en-shot (ph), hundreds of thousands of names, I don\u2019t know. They\nhad, the Red Cross had collected it. There\u2019s a big, big courtyard, it\u2019s towards the evening, and we\nsee people sort of sukkotking. These people were in a coma of dying. The Soviets brought in food\nwhich they couldn\u2019t digest. It was a terrible scene and I have that list and they cannot read the list,\nthey don\u2019t know who\u2019s alive, who\u2019s not. Before I know, a Soviet policeman, a soldier policeman,\nputs his hands on my shoulders, he says, please follow me. He gets me into the big castle, an empty\nroom, a tremendous room in the castle. It\u2019s all dark. He says, wait here, I should wait. He locks the\ndoor on the outside and I\u2019m all alone in that place. It was a horror. My only thought was, in the\nmorning, the truck will pick me up and I\u2019ll go to Siberia because that was the Russian way. I didn\u2019t\nwant to lie down, I was standing because I was afraid of rats. I was standing there the whole night,\nwaiting for the morning to be taken out, no matter where. He comes in the morning, he takes me\nout, he brings me back to the American Red Cross. Until today, I don\u2019t know what happened. I\nassume, because I spoke Russian and I wore an American uniform, that they took me for a spy. Or\nperhaps these guys intervened for me, I still don\u2019t know. We came back with a handful of people,\nthe worst of people from Heidleburg from these places. All I recall, when I crossed the border into\nGerman territory, I nearly kissed the land. That was how you do with Soviet Russia. There, I met\ntwo girls in Russian uniforms from my home town. They were in the army, they work with the\nvictorious armies, they were marching. And they told me that they saw Blanca\u2019s husband in\nKrakow\u2019. So, I told that he come back from Russia, so I went back to Heidleburg, I told Blancka\nabout it, she could hardly wait. She wanted to go to Krakow\u2019 to meet her husband, naturally. So we\nboth leave the job at the American Red Cross. There was a big repatriation movement then, they\nwere patroiting all of these people to Poland and there was a truck load of Poles coming back from\nGermany as slave labors into Poland. And all that talk you hear is anti-Semitic talk in that truck.\nWe were just about to cross the border into Czechoslovakia to go to Poland and I hear these\ncomments and it was a stop for us. I say to Blancka, you know what? I\u2019m not going back to\nPoland. I couldn\u2019t go back to Poland, I couldn\u2019t hear that talk. Here I was already in America, in a\nway, the American Red Cross. She was quite desperate about our separation, but she went, she\nwanted to find her husband. She comes to herself later, she found her husband with\nanother woman. He married a woman in Russia. Anyway, so I went back to Heidleburg. I stayed a\nwhile. Somehow or other, they had displaced persons camps, you know? I was going from one into\nanother. One day, I work for Ohrdruf, from the Red Cross they sent me to Ohrdruf because I spoke\nlanguages. I knew a little English by then, I knew Polish, I knew German, so I was useful in an\noffice. And somebody approaches me saying, is there a Maria Neider here? Maria Neider! Menek\nphoned. He literally walked through Poland and Germany from, so this was, how do you know\u2019?\nIt\u2019s Menek and he brought news that Frania is alive and he mentioned that they all came to\nGermany and I got them a house near Heidleburg because I had the rations, food, I had all that stuff.\nI\u2019m in the uniform, you saw my years of . And they sent me to A-rose-en (ph), after I\nworked in Frankfort first. Frankfort on Hurst, that was the only building that was the G.I. farm and\nfactory. The only buildings the Americans left intact in Frankfort because they thought they\u2019 Il need\nit for their military government later, so 1t was. So I worked there, Menek found me there. And\nthen they transported all of unknown people to A-rose-en (ph). They had the Germans leave the\ncity, this was a suburb of the city of Castle (ph). There was big castles there, big village. And Own-\nRae (ph) took over the town. And they sent me there and I had an apartment with another woman\nfrom America, she was of Polish origin, Maria Leiberskint. We lived there and life was pretty good.\nAnd my sister lived in Heidleburg, I would commute and bring food, I would always bring all these\nthings. I had a very interesting job, it was in the tracing, we were tracing children who were\ndispersed into Germany. No Jewish children were in question. But representatives of different\ngovernments, Polish, Yugoslavian, Hungarian, Croatian, you just name it, they came to our zone to\nclaim the children. They wanted to find their children. And the job of the Onrah (ph) personnel\nwhich I supervised for no good reason but that I knew the languages and I had an education, all of\nthis worked in my favor. They were field workers to find children. Many of these children didn\u2019t\nspeak any of their native languages, you had to identify them by some symbols or whatever.\nSometimes they uttered a word, sometimes they wore a cross which looked like a Slavonic thing.\nSome of these things, we found many of them. And we would always bring them to the attention of\nthese liaisons from their countries and they were shipped immediately to their countries. Today I\nam not sure I would do that as easily because you wanted to put children and were already observed\nby German families, what that separation meant, but those days there was no question that these\nchildren have to be removed from Germany, the belong to their families. Sometimes the families\nwere not available, but they belonged to their nations, to their countries. So these things, my staff\nwent to schools to find them, to churches, to orphanages, certainly it was most difficult with\nfamilies because families didn\u2019t want to tell us and it was detective work to find, because these kids\nwere so assimilated into Germany that they spoke German. Depending on the age too, all the\nchildren we could find easily. This was my job for a very, this was 1945, 1946, and there was\nplenty of food. I had a uniform of an American, Under Second Class because the First Class was\nthose who came from the States or from the other countries. These were Second Class, locally hired\npeople, but we had all the privileges. And one day, a man comes and sits with me in that restaurant\nthere where we had very good conditions, we had a PX, privileges, cigarettes, coffee and so on.\nAnd everybody was exchanging them for all kinds of goods. I started smoking, I became addicted\nthen. And the coffee I use to bring to my sister so she had something, anyway, I fed a whole family\non this. But, one day, a man in another type of uniform sits next to me and to begin talking. He\nsaid he\u2019s a president from the Joint Distribution Committee, and he says, as I talk to you, you\nbelong to the Joint. This was the end of wandering for me, I go to Stuttgart to work with the Joint.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "A: Okay?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not at that point at all. That\u2019s modern history. Joint Distribution Committee was established as\npart of Onrah (ph), they were administered and dependent on Onrah (ph). Their job was to identify,\nrehabilitate and help with the settlement of all the Jewish victims of Nazism. People were coming\nout of concentration camps so they established, and from Poland some came, from other countries.\nThe large concentration of Jews who survived was in Germany. The others we didn\u2019t touch, that\nwas Russia by then. From all the concentration camps, from all the death camps in Germany. In\nGermany there were no death camps, but concentration camps, they all came to the bigger cities of\nGermany. Particularly they gravitated towards the American occupied zone, which was Frankfort\nand Heidleburg and so on. Some went to the British zone, those who were liberated from Bergen-\nBelsen. Very few wanted to be in the Russian zone and very few wanted to be in the French zone\neven, but some did. There were concentration camps in the French zone too. Anyway, it was a job\nof the Joint to find these people, start feeding them, locating their relatives perhaps in other\ncountries, help them with immigration, so they took out the Jewish displaced persons from the other\ncamps because there was quite a bit of anti-Semitism in these camps. And they brought them into\ntheir own camps, they established Joint camps. You know, the anti-Semitism in these camps was an\ninteresting phenomenon. And they hired me as a second status employee of the Joint. I also had to\nwear a uniform. I was extremely absorbed in this work. It was to me one of the great experiences\nof my life, to be able to serve people who survived. I knew little about the concentration camp\nexperience, they didn\u2019t talk about it. My job was mainly to help them with immigration. I was\nstationed in Stuttgart, they brought me to Stuffgart. The Director of that office was a Flora Levine,\nan American woman and I was her assistant. And I recall hundreds of young people standing in line\ntrying to get to me to get a referral to the visa department because I had to process them, help them.\nI also helped with some of the counseling problems if they needed it. I spoke German, I spoke\nYiddish, I spoke Polish, I was ideal for this job in this respect. It was a job of great satisfaction. I\ncouldn\u2019t stop working, I worked literally day and night and everyday I would take these documents\nto the American Consulate in Stuttgart and he would put a stamp and here was a visa. One of the\njobs was also to help them reunite with families in America so they would get affidavits. This 1s\nanother long story. We worked very closely with what was Ny-anni-no (ph) and then was called\nUnited Service for New Americans, and Patrick was director of it, a matter later in another capacity.\nIt was extremely committed and devoted work, I\u2019ve never worked for an agency in which were such\ncommitment. I found a boyfriend there, we were suppose to be married, I later decided I didn\u2019t\nwant him. He followed me, I mean, he was an American social worker from Brooklyn, and we met\nlater in the United States but by then I withdrew from the relationship. It was a period of extreme\ninvestment and work and helping and I\u2019ve never been in this situation before. My was\nsuppose to lead to teaching in the gymnasium level. Somehow or other, this was social work. I\ndidn\u2019t know it was social work. So I represented the Joint in different places. One of the places was\nto go to the deport camp, sometimes for whatever problems. I traveled around the displaced persons\ncamps in all of the American zone. I had to go to births, I had to go to a wedding in the camps\nbecause there was tremendous activity in terms of marriage, in terms of having children. Nobody\nunderstood at all and years later I understood, it was part of the need for replenishment, for not\nbeing alone, for not facing the new world all alone, so that everyday there was a wedding, everyday\nthere was a birth and I was a representative of the Joint, I was invited. Once I went to a very\nmeaningful, extremely sad occasion. In Bergen-Belsen, I think a few months after liberation,\nperhaps a year after liberation, the Palestine Agency send a monument to be put on the grounds of\nBergen-Belsen. There was a reunion of all the inmates of Bergen-Belsen. I went as a representative\nof the Joint. This moment Ill never forget. When the Rabbi said Ka-dish (ph), there came a moan\nfrom the people, nobody cried. There was a moan, you could hear it on the steps of Russia. This\nstays with me, that moan of people. Nobody could talk, nobody could cry. There was, it was all in\nthat moan of people. Another time I remember that moan was, I just heard two years earlier, when\nin Bremen-hoffin (ph), when I was taking the boat to America, we stayed in Bremen-hoffin (ph) a\nfew weeks, waiting for the boat. The boat in which I came was the Ernie-pile (ph), that was then\nname, these are military boats, broken military boats. And again, I was a representative of this, this\nPll come to later because it was later. But anyway, so this was the work in the Joint. Extremely\ngratifying. They treated me beautifully, they send me once to Paris for a week of vacation. In those\ndays, people didn\u2019t travel to Paris on vacation, I did. They send me to Switzerland once, anyway, it\nwas all part of the job.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. My friends boyfriend was a man who was the son of a, who came from a\nGerman concentration, it was in Dachau or Buchenwald, I can\u2019t remember. This was in Stuttgart\nwhen I worked for the Joint. And I accidentally met him and we stayed together for a while. We\nwere very close to each other in every way. He taught me to play tennis. But, we never talked\nabout his experiences. He told me about his father, who was a very famous in\nBerlin, Bebo (ph) was the name. His mother was survived, he survived in the camp. We never\ntalked about the camp. He was lately a symphony orchestra, associate directory of the Detroit\nSymphony. He always wanted to be in the field of music, he had a career ahead of him. I didn\u2019t\nknow what I wanted to be. All I wanted was to work for the Joint for the rest of my life. I mean,\nworking with people, this was like, this was a true sense of doing something valuable. Doing\nsomething meaningful after the job as a maid. This was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I\ndidn\u2019t imagine I\u2019 Il have another life.\nchildren? Even though that may have been one of their deepest desires, and the relationships\nbetween men and women?\ndo you name a child? A Jewish child is named after dead family members. How can you name a\nchild a hundred names? These were the big decisions and the big pain. You named a child where a\nboy could have had a name of a woman, of a mother. But these young people, they tended toward\ndenial to an extreme extent. Some of it later in life was dysfunctional, but at that point, it helped\nhaving a marriage. I had to attend many marriages, I was a representative of the Joint. Having a\nRabbi at it, having a little party afterwards, having a birth, getting visa, getting together on that boat.\nMy sister got on the boat, and her son and her second husband. She married in Krakow\u2019 right after\nthe war. He adopted the child and here they go together with Menek to America, okay? On one of\nthe boats. In the winter of 1946, I certainly helped with the arrangements, this was my job. And\nhere in Bremen-hoffin (ph) and I get a frantic call from Menek. What happened? He was on the\nboat and waiting, you were forever waiting for the boat to arrive and on the boat you were waiting\nfor no good reason, you're waiting. These were all military boats, hundred of Jewish displaced\npersons. Many Jewish people. This was the Truman quota. We had no relatives in America.\nNobody could sent us an affidavit but beginning of 1946, Truman offered a certain number of\naffidavits and we were included in it. That\u2019s how I came to America. And so did my sister. What\nhappened, they called out Menek\u2019s name to come to the pursers office. There he was told that\nretroactively the Stuttgart consulate noticed in viewing his x-rays that he had tuberculosis and he\u2019s\nnot permitted to enter America. They removed him from the boat. Here was an orphan, both his\nparents were killed. My sister was on her way. I ordered my visa to go a few weeks later. Well, I\npicked him up in Bremen-hoffen (ph), I brought him to sanitarium in German. A horrible thing,\nsanitar1um for tubercular conditions, all Germans in the Sch-wa-daltz (ph), in the Black Forest. He\nwas terribly sick, all he wanted to die. Every Sunday, this American boyfriend of mine and me\nwent to visit him. Bring him food. He always pleaded with me to take the food back. All he\nwanted was a pill of cyanide. Every Sunday night I would go home with that pain, what to do?\nEventually, I extended my visa. I got him through the Joint into Switzerland, into a Joint sanitarium\nnear Lu-gone-au (ph). There he got better, he got well. American wouldn\u2019t let him in, it had to be\nfive years after the illness is arrested totally. So we got stuck in Switzerland and the Swiss didn\u2019t\nwant him and America didn\u2019t want him. There was no money and he was hungry often. We were\nin America by then, we would send him a little money, very little, we were making a little money,\nbut we sukkotred. One day, he advises us there is a new drug out, they say, his lung was collapsing,\nhe had , everything. People were dying, all these kids from Auschwitz. They were\nteen-agers, they were dying left and right. He knew he was going to die, but he heard there was a\nnew drug called streptomycin. Can we send it. 1947, streptomycin had a tremendous price for us.\nWe couldn\u2019t, it was still experimental, whatever, we couldn\u2019t afford it. Somehow or other we made\nit and we send it to him. This began his healing process. The Joint had ideas that you have to train\nthese young people for jobs that are available so according to them, this was the time that they\nneeded book binders. So he went to them to become a book binder. Since then, I\u2019ve always been\ntelling my students that you have to do rehabilitation towards not what is available but as part of the\nvalue system and his value system, a book binder was not for him. In his value system there was a\nprofessional, to be a businessman, a professional, but not a book binder. So he didn\u2019t like book\nbinder, they kicked him out, they didn\u2019t want to entrance him. That was the Joint, but eventually\nthey helped him a little bit, very little. The Swiss police was after him all the time, when 1s he\nleaving the country? Finally he got a little better, he got himself into the University of Brussels, he\npassed tests! Believe it or not, he passed tests. He didn\u2019t know the languages but he had a good\nmind for mathematics, for chemistry, he was a very learned person, but I still don\u2019t know. They\naccepted him on a trial basis. He graduated Cum-sad-laud, Smugla-cum-laud I remember, in\nSwitzerland. Many days he was hungry there. The Jewish community of Switzerland was very\nugly. They didn\u2019t want to help these kids at all. He had a close friend who is now a doctor in, he\nretired, but he was a doctor in New Jersey. They had no money to live on. They were hungry. So\nthe Jewish community in Brussels decided, no, he was in , decided that they get them\na night job to guard in the cemetery Jewish bodies since the people brought at night and they cannot\nbe buried, they needed a Jewish guard. So these two kids, who came out of the Holocaust, they\ngave the job. Ill never forget it, P\u2019Il never forgive them for it. The Swiss Jewish community. They\nhave no sense. They were horrible to, total lack of charisma, total lack of passion or anything, so\nthey give them this job. So, this helps them a little bit. A Jewish woman, a survivor opened a little\nkitchen, a kitchen where she fed, we sent a little money to this person. But anyway, despite all of it,\nhe was apparently brilliant, we didn\u2019t know it because he was not a great student in gymnasium.\nThe motivation was how he did so very well. And every year they would tell him he\u2019s not ready yet\nto go to America. Finally, finally after many, many years he came to America. By then he was\nestablished in Switzerland. He had a degree, he started working. He hated America when he came\nbut he made it eventually. So this is the aftermath period, 1s really not known well and I\u2019m very\nglad that they\u2019re beginning to teach a little about it. This was a period of extreme stress but stress\nwhich was pushed down. Stress which was swallowed. To run away, my own trip to the United\nStates was September 24th, 1947. I came to Bremen-hoffin (ph) and the boat wasn\u2019t ready. The\nboat had not come yet. So what do you do on September 21st, whatever it was, in September in\nBremen-hoffin (ph), everything was closed, you couldn\u2019t buy anything. I had a lot of German\nmarks because German marks were very available. So I remember, I wanted to spend it before\nleaving. So I went to a beauty parlor and I got a permanent. And it took so hard work, I came to\nAmerica, I had to pay $10 to remove it. But this is the way, what money meant in those days. I got\non the boat and the Joint assigned me as an escort to the people there, which means I had to be\nresponsible for them getting, each one getting $10, each of them getting a prayer book, in time for\nthe Holidays, each of them making sure that they would get kosher food. I had to be distributing, I\nwas the mach-hack (ph). I was still a young woman but I had these jobs, as a representative of the\nJoint. I recall sitting on that boat and waiting, finally the boat moved. The anchor was cut, this is\nanother memorable moment in my life. Suddenly when the anchor was caught, it was cut. A\nmoment came from the people on that boat, they realized this was, what they were leaving behind.\nThey were leaving all their families buried there. And it wasn\u2019t important where they were going,\nbut what they were leaving. This stays with me, this moment, these moments of separation stay\nwith me. These are still the most difficult moments in the lives of survivors. But I recall distinctly\nthe moment of Bergen-Beelines, I recall the moment of the anchor cutting. Then, I still feel that\npain when I think about it because I didn\u2019t realize what that moment really meant. Leaving the\npeople behind. And going to American in those days, they swore they would never come back to\nEurope. Many, many people stuck to it, they could never go back to Europe. People were getting\nsick on the boat, it was a fourteen days ride. I was the only one to show in the dining room, there\nwas marvelous food but there was, I remember this waitress that, eat more! Eat more! There was\nso much food. The Joint gave each of us $10, make sure to distribute everything. There was a guy\nwho told me he use to be related to the, who makes candy, kosher candy in America, who was it?\nNot Manaschevits, who was the other group? I forgot, no the other bar, you know, the Jewish. He\ntold me that for the rest of my life that P\u2019Il be getting chocolate from them, I never did anyway.\nPeople were already beginning to think, but you know they got very sick, they were laying sick.\nThey could take the seaside, er, ride. I was well up to a point, the last few days I was sick too. And\nthen suddenly there is a great, jubilant voice all over. We see the Statue of Liberty. This too are\ngreat moments. It was Saturday night and they wouldn\u2019t unload us because on Sunday the workers\ndidn\u2019t work at the dock or whatever it is. It didn\u2019t matter. We were all well by then. People\u2019s\nsickness stopped since the voyage stopped. And that Statue of Liberty was the greatest sight in the\nworld! Well, I was, my sister was there waiting for me, and my brother-in-law and another friend,\nthey took me to the Bronx, they had an apartment. They wrote me to Germany, they live on Garden\nStreet in the Bronx and I thought it was a palatial place. Right across from the zoo. I saw them\nbarefoot.",
        "A: Yes. Right across, off Southern Blvd. between 183rd Street. I had the bare feet, I walk up, a\nhorrible place, but anyway, all I wanted was to run back, but where do you go back, ever? Well,\neventually it worked out. We were struggling financially, very much. Sending half of our earnings,\nwent to Menek later because for weeks he was hungry there. It is unbelievable. The Swiss Jewish\nCommunity, I cannot forgive for it. But then I got a job, I immediately got a job. I don\u2019t know how\nimmediately I got the job. The Joint send me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal. By the way, later on\nI suddenly get a check of a lot of money, $1300, in 1947, $1300 was a fantastic amount of money in\nmy book! They paid me for the time I worked in Germany. They never told me they would pay\nme. This happens to be their good personnel policies, this I found out later. Loy-ja (ph) worked for\nthem for years. She still feels it, she has been treated extremely well. They send me no job, they\nsend me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal as a clerk. Very dull work, terribly dull work. But I\nremember the day when a telegram was sent to every employee, that they reached their quota of\n$250 million dollars, in 1947, signed by Morgan-tow (ph). Henry Morgan-tow (ph) was the chief of\nthe UJA then. And here it said that the executive director was Henry Montor (ph), I don\u2019t know if\nyou know the name, it was a big name in those days. You deal with forty, sixty bro-ter (ph), Henry\nMontor(ph) was in charge of the UJA. One day, he has a fall out with his, with Morgan-tow (ph) so\nthey had to separate. So Morgan-tow (ph) remains as the director of the UJA and Montor (ph) goes\nto another organization called the Palestine Economic Operation. They have been in business for a\nlong time, about the waterways in Palestine. The Director of Personnel at the UJA, Montor (ph)\ntook her with him, to the other organization. And she took me. So I ended up there. It was ina\nhotel which doesn\u2019t exist anymore across the Waldolf Astoria, 1t was a fine job, the rooms were air\nconditioned. They made me the archivist there. For some reason I like it because I was very quick\nin getting the files they needed. It was a good time until one day I had, I lived already in the city by\nthere, until one day I get this call from the United Service for New Americans, which is known\nNYANA, New York Association for New Americans. They\u2019ve always been in the business of\nhelping refugees. And they say, when I first came to America I had one visit with them, asking for\nwork, and they said, what I want to do? So I said, what I want to do was what I did for the Joint in\nGermany. They say, oh no, this is social work, for this you need a degree. They were stupid\nbecause I had languages and all these displaced persons they were serving they needed a person like\nme that spoke these languages, they didn\u2019t even stop. So they say, a new school of social work is\nopening up in Adell-fy (ph) and the Dean was with honor in Austria and he wants to give a Jewish\nscholarship to a displaced person. And we have many, many candidates who are more qualified\nthan you are, but we will include you if you want to. I thought about it, I didn\u2019t want to give up the\njob, I had a good paying job. This was another experience, which doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Since it\nwas a new school, they had to be more pious than the Pope. So they interviewed each candidate for\nsix days, for five days. Every day another interview. Until it came to Dr. Serrett (ph), who was a\nvery famous psychiatrist for the National Schools of Social Work. I didn\u2019t know a thing about\nsocial work. And he interviewed me, he wanted to know my childhood and everything. Just to put\nit on record. They were so limited, they never asked me about my Holocaust experience. My\nchildhood, my relation with my mother, my relation with my father, my relation with my siblings.\nThis took hours and hours, everyday an interview. The final one with Dr. Serrett (ph) and he\napparently approved so I got in. But to the sukkotme of the psychiatry profession, that nobody\nasked about the Holocaust. It was a non-subject in those days. This was 1949, 1950. Well, for\nsome reason he chose me and I got in and I was very unhappy. I didn\u2019t understand what this study\nwas all about. He usually came from the study of sociology, psychology, I was student of Polish\nliterature. They talked language which I didn\u2019t understand and I figured, how can I withdraw, how\nwill I get my old job back? It was very painful to me until the second semester, things began to go\nextremely well, let\u2019s put it this way. Nothing helps like a little success and a teacher just read my\npaper, which I thought was nothing, they all thought was excellent. Anyway, it was great and I was\ngraded very well. So this is how I got into the profession. I had no money. I lived in a, it was\namazing, with a Jewish family in, near Columbia University. Six dollars a week, I remember. I\ndidn\u2019t have enough money to live. My scholarship was paid by the University but there was a\nfoundation for Jewish girls and they were giving me $25 a week, which would have lasted except\nthat my field work in social work, three days a week you have to be in the field. And this idiot\narranged my field work to be New Jersey. So I had a lot of expenses and the school was in Adel-fy\n(ph) so $20 or whatever, $18 of that money went for travel. When I was finally selected by the\ncommittee to enter the school, the dean congratulated me and he asked me whether I want to study\ncase work, and I didn\u2019t know what case work was, so I say, what does social work have to do with\ncheese? Because case in German means cheese! He started laughing and was still laughing when I\nleft, this was my preparation for social work, but I made it. And I did well. My second placement,\nthey helped me, also in New Jersey. They couldn\u2019t find a place for me in New York, they were\nvery stupid about it. It was in a State Psychiatric Hospital. Which means that I had room and board\nthere. I lived there, and every psychiatric condition I immediately absorbed as my own. So one\nweek I was schizophrenic, the next week I was manic depressive. It was very hard on me but it was\nthe second year and I hadn\u2019t done very well, so I graduated anyway. Since then I\u2019ve had good jobs\nand been a social worker since then. I retired. I actually worked for Washington, for the Federal\nGovernment, I worked for nine years for the National Institute of Mental Health. These were\nspecial projects and drug addition. And I was a supervisor in a big agency then and I use to\ncommute and come to Washington and they were very large with money. This was the end of\n1950\u2019s, early 1960\u2019s. Johnson\u2019s programs spent a lot of money for rehabilitation, for human\nservices. They insisted I should travel first class because I had a high rank, GS-12 in those days\nwere the high rank. It was not becoming for a person with this GS grade to, not to go in important\nways. Anyway, there was a lot of stupid money spending. We didn\u2019t rehabilitate too many people I\ncan tell you, but it was an easy job and prestigious job. They sent me to be trained at Lexington,\nKentucky where they had the United States Public Health Hospital for tubercular diseases later on.\nOur job was to visit every agency and hospital in New York City, open up the doors for drug\naddicts. We did it, 1t was a whole new thing. A new ball game for me totally, but we accomplished\na lot in this respect, not that drug addicts were not rehabilitated easily but I have been involved in it\nfor many years. And then one day, again, I was re-married in 1962 and my husband was a teacher.\nHe had long vacations, he wanted his wife to go on vacations but I only had four weeks. One day\nwe came back from a summer vacation, there\u2019s a letter from the then Dean of the School of Social\nWork at Tall-a-dot (ph) who remembered me because he was my research professor at Adel-fy (ph).\nIt was a new school then, he asked that I join the faculty it was that easy. In these days, you would\nhave to have all kinds of qualifications. What happened, somewhere or other, for many years after I\ngraduated, they used that paper for a record to teach from so they remembered me this way. It was\nvery hard at Hunter from the first. I didn\u2019t want to give up my job as an AMH but they were very\ngenerous with me so they permitted me to work half time only for five years. The first five years\nwere full time, and then four years later, half time for Washington and half time for Hunter and then\nthe Washim Project came to an end and they paid me, I still get a little pension from them, which is\nnice. I belong to the Federal Employees Retirement Section, or whatever it is. So, I\u2019ve connections\nto Washington no doubt! I\u2019ve been at Hunter from 1962, first five years were half time. And I went\nthere, I retired in 1970, my marriage dissolved in 1970, we separated for the new divorce and in\n1974 he died. He was younger than I, he got leukemia and he died. And I retired from Hunter in\n1989, but I still teach the Holocaust course so I remain very much in, connected to the Holocaust\ncourse. I started it on my sabbatical year because I was emotionally more ready to confront that\nmaterial. Until then, it was always with me, but I couldn\u2019t quite read. I started digging into it and\nsince then I cannot leave it, now and forever involved in it.",
        "A: This was, my sabbatical was 1978 and I started teaching in 1979 and I have been teaching it still\nsince. It\u2019s always been an important part of my life and since then I have been lecturing all over\nbecause it\u2019s the only school of social in the country which offers it, which is unusual. Yes, which is\nvery unique, so I\u2019m still with it.",
        "A: By then I was not doing any, I didn\u2019t care, I was a supervisor. I had a big job, I published, I\nwrote something on drug addition and I didn\u2019t want to leave because it was a very well paying job at\nthat point and it was a prestigious job. My husband wanted me to but this was not the major thing.\nI was not a little woman ever in my life. I think my parents sort of made me feel I\u2019m okay and this\nreally helped I think. I\u2019ve never succumbed this way, but my husband wanted it. What was very\nnice was the prospect of long vacations. We always traveled for ten years which was great. But,\nno, there was always something in teaching that was prestigious. I didn\u2019t think they would take me\nbut they did and there were lots of times there too, all kinds of politics in the University so I don\u2019t\nneed to tell you about it, very often they want me out. Eventually I made my way in and eventually\nI did well, but I had rough years there too. The work was overwhelmingly big, a lot of work. And\nthere\u2019s so much competition there. If you were on good terms with one, the other one was angry to\nyou. Not because of me but because of perhaps they didn\u2019t like the other person because politics of\nthe University are something to write books about. But basically, it\u2019s a decent school, it was a\ndecent school and of all the jobs I had there admissions work, you know, you do everything. I had\nfaculty advisement. The favorite thing for me was always teaching. I liked accompanying the\nstudents and this saved me always, always. There were rough years too. When I retired they did\nsomething awfully nice for me. They established a collection of Holocaust literature in my name.\nAnd it\u2019s there which 1s, and I wanted it in the name, I had a conflict of which name it should go, I\nwanted my parents too and I wanted my husband too. So first we had it Maria Herr Schneider\nRosenbloom, they said, but what became Maria Herr Rosenbloom. And occasionally I lectured\nfrom it, books I bought, that is continuous sort of input which is great, couldn\u2019t be better. My\nparents will be remembered this way, my family will be remembered this way, it\u2019s marvelous I\nthink. But since then I\u2019ve always been in private practice a little bit. But always Holocaust related.",
        "A: Yes. Always Holocaust related, always. The first ttme I work with Holocaust survivors was in a\npsychiatric, I was working in psychiatry because it was a natural thing for me. I was trained in a\nway, so my first job was the psychiatric clinic of the Bathesda Hospital. And there I was the only\nYiddish speaking person, none of the psychiatrists spoke Yiddish, or wanted to speak Yiddish. So I\nwas very much involved with every patient, nearly every patient. Many of these people were\nconsidered refugees from Europe. These were all concentration camp survivors. Nobody knew the\nterm. I remember many, many fantastic situations from there. One man refused shock treatment so\nthey sent him to see me, see Miss Schneider. Because I speak the same. And in my stupidity I\nthought, why not? He says his mother-in-law disapproves, I said, I'll talk to your mother-in-law.\nAnd his boss, he doesn\u2019t want his boss to know, so I say, okay, I can talk to him too. I exhaust all of\nthe possibilities and he says to me, to tell me the truth. I don\u2019t want to make con-a-des-ot-rich (ph),\nshocking, no, electric shock treatment of me. Some of these scenes were unbelievable. One\nwoman, this I\u2019ll never forget. She should be remembered somewhere as a result. One woman, an\nfrom the Lower East Side, I didn\u2019t know her background very much, but she told me\nthat she needed an apartment. They were in a horrible walk up and they so needed to, it was very\ndifficult, it was after the war, apartments were not available. So I did everything possible to move\nthis family. Finally, on Grant Street on the Lower East Side, projects came up. Lower income\nprojects and I got an apartment for them in a new building. With elevators, with everything. The\nday they move, to move, she runs into the clinic desperate, insisting she must see me. Crying,\nfalling down on the floor. I\u2019ve never seen such, what happened? She cannot live there, she moved\nin and she, I have to being her back to the old place. She cannot live there and I don\u2019t understand\nwhat was going on. This goes on for a while, that she cries, I must do something for her, she\ndoesn\u2019t want to live there anymore. She didn\u2019t say commit suicide, but she doesn\u2019t want to live\nanymore. Finally, I still didn\u2019t understand, finally she says, the incinerators. I, that was a moment\nof awakening for me. I didn\u2019t know about this revulsion, nobody talked about these things in those\ndays. She could not live with the reminder of Auschwitz. She couldn\u2019t live with the incinerators.\nSo, this was a point of learning for me. Then I started taking histories which included the history,\nuntil then, he was born in Chop-kov (ph) and Poland and he went through the war, he was in a\ncamp, he was in a war camp. That was the level of knowledge. But since then, I\u2019ve got a lot of\nexperience. For four years I worked in psychiatric clinic. Gave me a lot of experience in working\nwith survivors. One woman left her child in the hospital, she didn\u2019t want the child. I went on a\nhome visit, she and her husband thought, she delivered there, they didn\u2019t want the child. Who\nwould defend such a thing? And then I heard them speak. She was in a camp and she saw some\nhorrible fate of children. And he was so identified with her that he literally repeated all her words\nand all her ideas, he assumed all her ideations. In those days we had a term for it, a-folly-adert (ph),\nhe thought exactly like his wife. So these were things none of the doctors understood any of it\nbecause it was a non-subject. The Holocaust was a non-subject truly until Ish-metz (ph) story came\nthrough. I was very lucky to have this experience and I always stayed with it in a way. I started\nattending meetings. There was some, what was his name? A psychiatrist, Christal (ph) and Freidel-\nlander (ph), they began to talk about it. And then when I established a course I became very much\ndevoted. But I\u2019ve always had patients of this background, very few, but always to see some people\nwith this kind of background. I still see one, what do you call it? Load-man-ish (ph), doesn\u2019t really\nmatter really, you know, but I\u2019ve always kept a foot in the door with this so I\u2019ve been always into it.\nIt helps in my teaching. I need to bring the past experience, the survivor agencies.\nI never left the Holocaust. It\u2019s strange, but somehow or other, it became a central part of my life. I\nam sure the central part of every survivor\u2019s life, but I\u2019m more aware of it. You never leave the\nHolocaust behind really. Those you see or those you don\u2019t see. Those who talk and those who\ndon\u2019t talk. It is the same coin, it\u2019s just the reverse side. But if they don\u2019t want to talk or whether\nthey talk obsessently about it, it\u2019s the same. You don\u2019t exorcise it, it is with you. Some remember,\nsome don\u2019t want to remember. You don\u2019t want to remember because it\u2019s so central to your life.\nThe pain is so strong. Sometimes people don\u2019t stop talking about it. With me and with all of us it\nhas been a central, we are very aware of the centrality of this experience in our lives. The question\nalways arises how is it possible, you know, but you can build on the trauma. I always think of the\nMexican cities, the Mayans, who talk about these things. You can build on ruins, that be my point.\nYou never resolve it, you don\u2019t work it through. I teach my students this way, it\u2019s new teaching to\nmany of us, but they will learn it. You don\u2019t work through this kind of a trauma. You don\u2019t come\nto terms with it ever, I think. But you work on top of it and you try to build some meaningful lives.\nAnd this is really what\u2019s important, this helps you I think. Although I\u2019ve seen many people have\ndone very, very, obtained riches and I don\u2019t consider their lives very meaningful but they kept\ngoing. It\u2019s really building on top of the trauma, like building on top of a ruin. Starting up, what\nyou're doing is there. It doesn\u2019t have to destroy your life, that\u2019s my point.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think your fully integrated with the Holocaust ever. But I do think that to have, to give\nsome meaning to it. To whatever you do, like our lecturing, people come to see you, you have to\ngive testimony. We all find some meaning in doing something so the people will not be forgotten.\nThis helps us. Now, I never feel that this is beneficial emotionally because survivors refuse to get\nany emotional benefits from the tragedy. But to find some meaning in it, either through\nremembering, through testimonies, through writing, through supporting the State of Israel, through\nsupporting the Museum. All of these things give some meaning and they help in going on, I think\nso. It\u2019s mainly helping in transmitting something to the new generations. But there are many\nvictims of the Holocaust. People could never really start living again. Some have ended up in the\nState hospitals. I give lectures there, at Manhattan State Hospital, Lochin State Hospital, some of\nthe doctors told me that they have casualties of the Holocaust for forty years, they came. Nobody\nunderstood it there. Their tragedies, nobody understood them or somehow or other nobody helped\nthem and they may be there or may be dead but, many people have nightmares. My sister still\nsuffers from nightmares. I have enough of repressive potential in me that I don\u2019t suffer from that\nbut many people have nightmares, many people have suffered continuous migraine headaches,\nmany people have extreme fears, many have many phobias. Many, many gastro-intestinal\nsymptoms from eating glass which was put into bread in Bergen-Belsen. There are many, many\nphysical and psychological manifestations but, by and large, while we have a large number of these\npeople that are still alive, we have many more, we have many more who have done well. Who use\nthis experience in more positive ways, particularly the second generation are very impressive this\nway. They try to give some meaning to their parental experiences. I teach along these lines, which\nmeans I don\u2019t deny the tragedy and I don\u2019t bely some of the consequences of psycho-pathology\nnature, but I think that the positives of it, the strength of survivors, is quite impressive. Even if they\nhave conflicts of all kinds. Many have literally risen from ashes, let\u2019s face it. And have formed\ngood families. In some families, the Holocaust has led to a lot of conflict, has lead to prejudices,\nhas lead to exclusion. But by and large, survivors have had to pave the way. Take a look at the\nArmenians. They didn\u2019t have an Armenian Genocide Museum until the survivors built one in\nWashington, or whatever. We are taught a lot of people have suffered massive tragedies to find the\nmeaning in the tragedy. I think that Holocaust survivors have truly lead the way to it. You and I,\nwe are starting so much more.\nseems to be something in the world that repeats. And now the world has learned how to do this.\nAnd it hasn\u2019t said, we won\u2019t do it. Only certain people have said it, we won\u2019t do it. Is there a kind\nof conflict in you about, what meaning can you create after the Holocaust if such things can keep\nrepeating?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure I know, definitely, I do not know. However, in my course, I integrate the lessons,\nlike some of the experiences in Rwanda. The newest, at earlier times when I first started teaching, it\nwas Cambodia. Actually, every one of these events triggers off the students questions about it, so I\nwant students to look at it, that it continues. What will ever stop it I definitely do not know. I do\nnot think it is a psychological thing, I think that it\u2019s in politics, in economics, in geographic\ndislocations, there are many, many things that brings it to that eruption. I think that Yugoslavia was\nsomewhat of a different kind of ball game. I don\u2019t compare with it with Rwanda or with Cambodia.\nI have on my bookcase here a book from a girl who survived Cambodia. She has a Polish name,\nShe-man-ski (ph) and she\u2019s of Polish parentage I think. You know the name? It\u2019s called, The\nStones Cry Out. And it is as tragic as the Holocaust. And Rwanda certainly is, we\u2019re just so far\nremoved. The lesson we haven\u2019t learned is to be identified, 1s to feel with them. Important as you\nare, I think affect is important, to feel 1s very important. This, I don\u2019t know very well, how we can\ntransmit it. That it appears in the New York Times, a very few in this, and then it disappears. Some\nof these things should be held forever in the country for the people. We should never forget\nRwanda. Whom do I know that really knows about it?",
        "A: Neider, my husband\u2019s name. Never Schneider! His parents name has the German spelling\nwhich is N-E-I-D-R. His parents already Polandized it, an A-J.

This was called script money, it was money\nused by the American military personnel and those attached to them, like ANRA or the Joint\nDistribution Committee. It was not available to the population in general.",
        "A: No, it was not available to DP camps, it was only available to people who were with the\nAmerican army or the attach\u00e9\u2019 personnel like ANRA and the Joint, and it was possible for them to\nuse the money to buy in military stores called PX. This is our house in Kolomyja which I\nphotographed, unfortunately, I cut off half of it. I photographed it in Kolomyja four years ago when\nI first visited for the first time after the war. It was an extremely difficult trip for me and when I\nwalked up the staircase, I walked up and down, I couldn\u2019t quite make it to the apartment. Somehow\nor other I pushed myself extremely much and I finally went in. Downstairs in the olden days was\nthe business. The first floor was occupied by the family and on top of the floor was a very big attic\nwhich was the maga-zeln (ph) where they kept all the business things. But too, this balcony was a\nvery important part of our life. It was overseeing the car-so (ph) so we could see what was going on\nin town, who was dressed well, who was not, and so on. To the right, the right windows were what\nyou called the salon or living room. To the left were the, was the bedroom of my parents. In the\nback were rooms which had no windows but sky lights. One of the rooms was considered the living\nroom one summer and the other was the children\u2019s room. And in the back of that was a very big\nhallway which was used in the summer for all kinds of gatherings. On top of it was a tremendous\nattic and this attic I say was part of the business. Now we lived there, the apartment has been\ndivided and was given right after the war by the Soviets, was given to their two Generals so, one of\nthe General\u2019s still lived there, he didn\u2019t want to let me in and the other part belongs to a widow of\nthe General. She too refused to let me in, but with a lot of persuasion from the guide, she did open\nthe door. I could see inside, it was very neglected and I could see one of our rugs still hanging on\nher wall.",
