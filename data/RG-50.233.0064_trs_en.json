        "Q: It\u2019s July 31, and my name is Kevin Wayne, with the United States Holocaust\nMuseum. I am here with Walter Lachman, a Berlin survivor of the Holocaust and\nwe are going to interview him and discuss some of his experiences during World\nWar II. And we can start very basically with some demographic information,\nyour name and if your name was different at the time, to mention that as well as\nyour date of birth and place of birth",
        "A: I was born Wolfgang, I guess after Mozart, Louis Lachman on May 26, 1928 in\nBerlin. My father was Max Lachman who was born in the year 1900, also in\nBerlin. He was the son of Louis Lachman and Anna Lachman and by profession\nwas an engineer. He had gone to the University of Berlin and become an\nengineer. My mother was Frieda Schwartz whose father was Gustav Schwartz\nand Recha Schwartz was her mother and was also born in Berlin and they were\nthe proprietors of a wholesale handkerchief and kerchief business. My\ngrandfather served in the first World War as a master sergeant and served in\nvarious theaters of war -- most notably in the French campaigns in Verdun and so\non and so forth. My father joined the German army in 1918 just before the war\nended. While he never saw service in the first world war, he was very active in\nwhat was the campaign by the German army against the Spartacus uprising -- this\nwas an uprising led by Karl Lebclech of basically communist agitators and it was\nput down in 1919, Lebclech was killed. My father fought in that ... against these\nSpartacus revolutionaries and received the Iron Cross, second class for his efforts.\nMy father married in probably 19... ?\u2019m not sure, probably 1926 or 1925 uh...\nfor various reasons, personal and to himself, he chose not to pursue his\nengineering career any further and entered my grandfather\u2019s business to work\nalong with him.",
        "Q: What kind of engineering was he involved with before that?",
        "A: He was a mechanical engineer. My grandfather\u2019s business was apparently a very\nthriving .. uh .. place. After I was born in 1928, I remember being there and\nseeing lots of things being shipped out. Big boxes and big storage rooms -- as it\nturned out, when I was first born, we lived in the same building that the business\nwas in. The business was on the ground floor and we lived on -- 1t was an\napartment house and we lived in an apartment. I guess on the third floor above\nthat. Afterwards we moved to what was presumably a better building in the\nwestern section of Berlin which 1s now -- what was until recently, the American\nor the Western zone of Berlin. The business had originally been what was East\nBerlin. Um -- I had always led a very sheltered, quite comfortable childhood.\nGenerally, we had the apartment in the city, we also had a fairly small, little\nsummer house outside of Berlin in a place called Neuenhagen -- it\u2019s really like a\nlittle suburb outside of the city, and we used to go there for weekends when we\nweren\u2019t away. As a general rule, my parents uh .. my mother and my father and\nmy grandmother, went on a vacation every summer. My father stayed with us for\nthe first week -- we would go to Italy or Switzerland or Czechoslovakia -- Marin\nBada Kalspark ?? sticks in my mind or Cantina in Italy and my father stayed with\nus for the first week and at the end of the summer he came and picked us up, so he\nspent a week with us sort of at either end of the vacation. I don\u2019t know how\nimportant it is to this whole narrative, but it will tell you something about my\nbackground.",
        "Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?",
        "A: No. I was an only child, from I was told later, I was born by Caesarean section\nand in those days, women chose not to have any more children if they had one by\nCaesarean section. I .. at least that is what I was told, I don\u2019t know how factual\nthat is. Uh.. I like to get to my schooling now. I started going to school -- I\nbelieve in 1933 -- it was just about the time that Hitler came to power and I\nstarted going to a public school -- I remember having to sing the German anthem\nof course, every morning before class. And also the National Socialist anthem\nand soon after that, there was a time when Germany agitated for the return of the\nSaar provinces back to Germany and we had to sing a special song for the return\nof the Saar -- the coal producing -- the steel producing area that had been annexed\nby France -- demilitarized rather.",
        "Q: So you sang these three songs?",
        "A: Sang three songs, and I must say that the first two or three years of school really\nproceeding relatively uneventfully -- I can\u2019t recall that there was any particular\nprejudice or any particular hatred or any particular problems that I experienced.",
        "Q: Did you also attend religious school?",
        "A: Not when I was that small. Later on. As far as religion is concerned -- we were\nmembers of an orthodox congregation that at some point in time during my\nyounger years, my father chose for whatever reason -- my father and mother -- I\nsuppose it was a joint decision -- chose to join a reform movement and we went to\na large -- very elegant reform synagogue. Maybe that had something to do with\nour move to the Western part, I really don\u2019t know how that came about but\nwhatever -- that is what happened.",
        "Q: Prior to that move, had you been living with your grandparents?",
        "A: No. I skipped that. My grandfather had died probably six months after I was\nborn. He died of tuberculosis and I do not remember him at all other than from\npictures.",
        "Q: This was your mother\u2019s father?",
        "A: Yes. That was my mother\u2019s father. And neither do I remember my father\u2019s\nfather, who had apparently had died before I was born. I do remember my\nfather\u2019s mother and I do remember my mother\u2019s mother. My father\u2019s mother\nlived near us but we never spent as much time with her as we spent with my\nmother\u2019s mother. I don\u2019t know why that is but I suppose that 1s sort of par for the\ncourse, it happens everywhere. And uh .. my mother\u2019s mother really did go along\non all vacations with us -- and sort of -- while she did not live with us -- she lived\nin her own place -- we saw her much more frequently. Every Friday night we\nwent to her house for Friday night dinner which for some traditional reason was\nnot chicken but rather was roast beef -- or whatever -- roast beef and roast\npotatoes or something like that. I am not quite sure. Oh, I would like to talk\nbriefly about my first memories of the Hitler rise to power and socialism and what\nI overheard in our house. -- Um... the first, the first real memory that I have of a\ndiscussing about Hitler was -- or about National Socialists -- was one night when\nwe were visiting my uncle -- this was my mother\u2019s brother -- who also lived in\nBerlin -- who also had been born in Berlin -- but by the way, they did not live too\nfar away from where the Reichstag was. We saw the sky turning red and over the\nradio we heard that there was a fire in the Reichstag and at the time, I remember a\nconversation that my parents had with my uncle about that particular event and\nabout how they thought that 1t probably was a staged event and so on and so forth.\nMy father was fairly conservative, fairly nationalistic German. I think now that if\nthere is a political equivalent in this country now you would probably say that he\nwas very much a conservative republican and he felt that this ... first of all, I\nthink ... basically I suspect, that while he never said so, he probably felt some\nsympathy for some of the things that Hitler stood for. Not of course with the\npersecution of the Jews but with national pride which my father I believe shared\nand he always ... I remember one of the things that he always used to say was,\n\u201cWell, this is an aberration and this man will mellow and change his mind about\nthe Jews, particularly the Jews that had served Germany in the war and so on and\nso forth, or else he will be replaced with someone from his party that doesn\u2019t\nbelieve in all that nonsense and if it doesn\u2019t work out, we will leave on the \u201clast\ntrain\u2019\u201d.\u201d Whatever that \u201clast train\u201d meant, we never caught it. We didn\u2019t make that\nlast train. I am trying to think back now, I am trying to be a little bit ... go more a\nlittle bit in time. Probably about \u201935 or \u00b036, things started changing in Germany\nand Jewish children could no longer attend the regular public schools and I had to\ngo to what was a Jewish school and that school was in the backyard of a\nsynagogue in a fairly old building in the older part of town. And it was necessary\nfor me to either take a subway ---- to take an elevator train, or walk. And, I still\nremember some of my teachers and uh -- that was not .. I think the school was\nvery good. Uh .. I think I missed some of my friends from the public school but I\ngot used to it very quickly and that\u2019s when I started, in addition to having regular\nschooling, I started to have religious instruction also. Peculiarly enough, even so\nthat we belonged then to a reformed synagogue, the religious instruction that I\nreceived was Conservative Judaism -- the reform synagogue did not have any\nreligious school. Uh .. I went to that school for a couple of years and then, you\nknow, I was probably seven, eight years, nine years old and while one is not ...\nreally does not .. is not too politically cognizant of what is going on. I did hear a\nlot of conversation about Jewish doctors being no longer allowed to treat non-\nJewish patients, Jewish attorneys no longer being allowed to practice cases, other\nrestrictions. Also, my father complaining that some of his gentile customers no\nlonger would buy from him or were afraid to buy from him and uh ... there was a\ngeneral deterioration in the quality of life ... not the quality of life so much but\nthe economic aspects of life. As far as I can recall, the quality of our life really\ncontinued pretty much as it had before. We continued to take our summer\nvacations, we continued to go to our summer house in Neunehagen, my parents\ncontinued to go to concerts and to the opera and when I reached this age, they\ntook me once in a while and all those things were opened up to us and we\ncontinued to have a ... I believe an automobile and I believe there came a time\nwhen we could no longer drive the automobile because Jews could no longer\ndrive pleasure vehicles, and my father had to sell it and was pretty disgruntled\nabout that. But meanwhile, he kept saying, \u201cWell this will go away and this will\nblow over and this is just temporary\u201d and his business was still fairly good so he\nwasn\u2019t complaining. So things pretty much continued.",
        "Q: Did he take over that business? Was it pretty much ...",
        "A: Yes, he was really running the business. Since my grandfather died, he was really\nrunning the business. He was doing it. Maybe this was really ... for all I know,\nhe might have gone in the business because my grandfather was sick or was dying\nor something like that ... that there would be continuity for the business -- that\nmight have very well been the reason. Um ... when I left grammar school, which\nwas probably around 1937 or 1938, I don\u2019t remember exactly anymore, we had to\ngo to a different school -- what was known as an upper school -- a Gymnasium\nkind of thing -- but it was not called a Gymnasium because there were not\nsupposed to be Jewish Gymnasium. It was called Jude Schule Nacht Liebplan\nund UberSchule -- UberSchule meaning an upper school kind of a thing. And\nthat was in the Western part of the city. And I really believe that this is when I\nhad my first, first personal contact with prejudice because for some reason or\nother, there were a lot of young kids, non-Jewish young kids who would wait for\nus in order to harass us and beat us up on the way to school and there was just\nreally almost no escaping it and every day it was a challenge to try and devise a\nway to go to school a little different -- different street, different side of the street\nor get off at a different elevator stop -- to try to avoid that. And very often we\nwere successful, very often we were not. Most of the time, I had to go alone\nbecause where I lived there was no other kid that was going to that school and it\nbecame a daily challenge and I really remember being afraid every day to go to\nschool and crying to my mother that I don\u2019t want to go and I\u2019m afraid and this and\nthat and the other thing and my parents said you have to go, you have to go to\nschool. I really don\u2019t know why my parents didn\u2019t accompany me to school but I\nsuppose you can\u2019t do that every day anyways. But somehow, I made school every\nday. I mean, nobody really got hurt seriously, we would just get knocked around a\nlittle bit -- but I was afraid of it. I was never really strong or a very athletic child.\nIn fact my parents tried to encourage that aspect in me and had me join the\nMaccabean soccer league and I had boxing lessons and stuff like that which I was\nnever really good at. I was just as bad at my piano lessons, I was never any good\nat that either. In any event, that became a problem. Then came the Kristallnacht\non November 9, 1938, and at that time, my father\u2019s business was all smeared up\non the outside with \u201cJewish Store\u201d kind of a thing. Even so, it wasn\u2019t really a\nstore -- it was a wholesale business -- people couldn\u2019t really go in and buy. It was\npainted with big letters and people were standing outside and discouraging\ncustomers from going in. Many of the synagogues were burned down -- in fact,\nmost of them. And that was a turning point in the general prosecution er ..\npersecution of the Jews. It really, from then on, everybody\u2019s life sort of became\nmiserable who was still left.",
        "Q: Was your school vandalized?",
        "A: No. The school was not vandalized -- the school was fine. There was no problem\nwith the school. Uh..",
        "Q: Did your father go to work and open the store?",
        "A: My father, yeah, my father went to work. I think he probably closed for a day or\ntwo but he still had one or two non-Jewish employees who stayed really with him\nuntil the end and in fact, I had been corresponding with one of them soon after the\nwar and I sent him some food packages when I was in Munich after the war but\n... Llost track of him and of course he has to have been dead for many years now.\nAnd uh ... my whole life started to change after November 9\". First of all, that\nsummer -- my mother -- we had been on vacation, I believe in the Hartz\nMountains which are mountains in lower Saxony and my mother became ill,\nwhile we were on vacation and she had to be brought back in an ambulance. I\nremember that. I guess it was some sort of bleeding if one sort or another and she\ndied soon the after of Leukemia.",
        "Q: The summer before Kristallnacht?",
        "A: That was the summer of 1939, so it was really a sort of double whammy that year.\nFirst my mother dying and then Kristallnacht was that November. My father --\nsoon after, my father became ill or at least did not feel well. I think that a lot of it\nhad to do with -- probably a lot of it had to do with my mother\u2019s dying -- it had to\ndo with the deterioration of the business -- the general hopelessness if the\nsituation and he still kept saying \u201cThis won\u2019t last -- this won\u2019t last.\u201d But then he\nstarted, I believe, trying to get us out of the country. But after 1939, it was really\nquite difficult -- the European countries like France and Britain would not take uh\n.. Jewish refugees at that time. For the United States, you had to have a relative\nwho guaranteed your financial support. We knew nobody here so that was\nimpossible. My father made some tentative tries to get to a South American\ncountry and I will tell you more about that later. I think he made some contacts in\nChile and I think some work was done along those lines, hoping to get to Chile.",
        "Q: Was your father ever taken for forced labor?",
        "A: No. He was not. He was never in any concentration camp, he was never in any\nforced labor -- he was never really hurt in any way. Uh... my father, I remember\nliving of course with my father and we still had a maid, or a servant in those days.\nThat was a problem too, I believe that sooner or later, we weren\u2019t allowed any\nmore to have a non-Jewish servant living in the household so I think she became a\nday person who would come in. My father became ill and died on December 19,\n1940 of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis was then, still a very dread disease. Today of\ncourse, it has been eradicated -- or maybe it\u2019s coming to the fore again -- I don\u2019t\nknow. But in any event, people would die of tuberculosis and people would talk\nof tuberculosis like we talk of cancer today.",
        "Q: Do you recall him being ill in the house?",
        "A: Yes, I recall him being ill and I recall him coughing and I recall him going to the\nhospital and I recall visiting him. Of course, you couldn\u2019t go to the regular\nhospital, you had to go to the Jewish hospital -- he went to the Jewish hospital in\nBerlin and died in that hospital. After my father had died, my grandmother\nliquidated their apartment and I moved in with her. That\u2019s my mother\u2019s mother.\nMy father\u2019s mother had died in between somewhere -- somewhere along the line -\n- probably I would say 1935 or 1936, somewhere along that line. But as I said\nearlier, we weren\u2019t really that close to her. So from 1940, after December 1940, I\nmoved in with my grandmother and moved in with her. I remember my Bar\nMitzvah -- which was a very small affair -- but I did have a Bar Mitzvah -- and I\nguess because of my grandmother, it was in an orthodox synagogue. But it was a\nvery small thing in our apartment afterwards with some people coming over.\nNobody could have big festivities any more -- you couldn\u2019t go to restaurants any\nmore and you couldn\u2019t go to concerts any more. My grandmother wasn\u2019t\ninvolved in that kind of thing anyhow -- all that stuff after my mother died. Uh..\nI continued with my schooling while I live with my grandmother and we received\na notice in January 1942 to report for resettlement on let\u2019s say on about the 20\" of\nthat month. I can\u2019t be sure of the correct date, but around the 20\" or 21\u00b0 of\nJanuary 1942. We reported to a very large -- one of the few synagogues that had\nbeen left standing.",
        "Q: That\u2019s where you were told to report?",
        "A: That\u2019s where we were told to report. One of the few synagogues that had been\nleft standing and they cleared out all the benches and chairs and everybody was\non blankets -- sitting on blankets on the floor and slept there for a day or two\nwhile we were being registered. We were allowed to bring, I think one suitcase\neach and uh .. I remember my grandmother had me put on double clothing -- two\npairs of pants and two shirts and things like that and she took a hundred mark note\nand wrapped it up -- wrapped a yarn around it so it would look like some extra\nsewing material and gave me that to keep in my pocket which turned out to make\nno sense at all but you know, those are things that people do when they don\u2019t\nknow where they are going.",
        "Q: Did you pack something special?",
        "A: No, my grandmother did the packing. Incidentally -- while I was living with my\ngrandmother, she was pursuing this uh ... this Chilean trip or immigration and\nnothing ultimately came of it. I remember even taking lessons because uh .. to\nlearn how to make marzipan so that she would be able to have something that you\ncan make a living in if she came to another country and I would help her do that\nsomehow, it never came out too well when I did it. We practiced cooking\nmarzipan in the house so that we would have something professional or a trade if\nwe ever got to Chile but obviously, nothing ever came of it so as we received our\nnotice in 1942, we registered and there were probably about a thousand people\nand they would -- as I read now, -- they would .. each of the transports would be\nabout a thousand people would be put .. would be sent away.\nQ; How did this notification come to you?",
        "A: It came in the mail.",
        "Q: Just in the mail?",
        "A: It came in the mail. My grandmother, amazingly enough, did an inventory of all\nour household goods that we had to leave and I still have the inventory so I am\ntrying to collect from the German government for that but who knows? Whatever\n-- whether anything will come of that or not. Maybe nothing ever will. It\u2019s\namazing to see all these things -- she was very meticulous, I mean even to the\nextent of phonograph records as to how many were left behind and so on and so\nforth.",
        "Q: How much leave time did you have?",
        "A: We had about ... I would say it was about a week, ten days. That\u2019s really all we\nhad. And we couldn\u2019t take very much so you didn\u2019t need much lead time -- I\nbelieve the suitcase could weigh no more than 30 kgs which is about 60 pounds --\nit is less than we usually take on a vacation trip now -- so you really couldn\u2019t take\nvery much. It turns out later on that we lost everything anyway so it doesn\u2019t make\na difference -- the whole thing was academic. Um ... my last memories of Berlin\nuh .. were that, as we were leaving the synagogue, my ... the principal of my ...\nof the high school that I had gone to was standing at the exit point and gave each\nperson a hard candy and he said goodbye to me and I was surprised that he\nremembered me and then we were put on a truck -- an open truck and the last\nsight that I remember of Berlin is that victory column that site in the middle of the\nTiergarten, it\u2019s just a monument -- nothing really special -- I believe it remembers\n-- it commemorates a victory in the war of 1870-71 against the French. Um...\nwe were brought to a railroad yard and uh ... in freight cars -- you know, in\nregular freight cars ... and they were locked and we started our journey. Many of\nthe people, I remember, were fairly old -- I was the only child in that particular\ncar -- the only youngster. I must have been about fourteen -- about thirteen and a\nhalf years old. It was soon after my Bar Mitzvah. My Bar Mitzvah had been in\nMay 1941 -- June 1941, so this must have been like since months after my Bar\nMitzvah. And uh .. there were pails for toilet needs which were emptied from\ntime to time -- the journey took, I believe, about seven or eight days. It was\ngetting colder, the food was relatively inadequate -- this was 1n the middle of\nwinter -- this was in January and we were headed East so obviously freight cars\nhave no heating facilities -- but there were enough of us in the car so there was a\ncertain amount of human warmth.",
        "Q: You were with your grandmother?",
        "A: I was still with my grandmother and incidentally, while we were at the gathering\npoint of the synagogue, I remember seeing my first person dying -- which is really\nsort of indelible in my mind -- I saw many, many more after that but there was a\nman on one of those blankets near us and all of a sudden, he started -- well, I\nguess he had a heart attack and just died. I mean, nobody did anything to him --\nhe just died and that sort of stuck in my mind -- I had never seen that before and it\nwas sort of a frightening thing to a thirteen and a half year old.\nQ For your mother and father when they passed away, was it still possible to have a\nnormal funeral service?\nA Yes, it was. There was a normal .. you know there is a Jewish cemetery in Berlin\nand one of the peculiarities of the German Jewish community was there was one\nvery large cemetery which catered to all the different religious -- religious Jewish\ndenominations so it is a very gigantic place -- it\u2019s still in existence -- I have been\nback there two or three times and it is a very lovely, peaceful place. And there is\na very large family plot that accommodates both my mother and my father, my\ngrandfather, my mother\u2019s brother, who died also of asthma probably somewhere\nin the 30\u2019s -- that plot is still there. O.K. -- how are we doing with the tape?",
        "Q: We're O.K.",
        "A: O.K., we are on the cattle car -- or freight car or whatever you want to call that\nthing. A number of people in the car died, but after you see your first person\ndying, you sort of become immune to that.",
        "Q: Did you pass those bodies out at certain points or ...",
        "A: No. They left them. They left them until we got to where we were going. As it\nturned out, we arrived in Riga, which was then the capitol of Latvia and uh .. we\n... aS we got off the cattle cars or freight cars -- it was very cold, and there was a\ngreat deal of snow which was higher than I had ever seen it and we were told to\nput our luggage on sleds which were waiting nearby -- the sleds -- I think they had\nhorses -- and we put the luggage on those sleds and I guess that was the last we\nsaw of them. That was the end of that. Where they took it, we\u2019ll never know --\nbut it was gone. We were then put on other trucks and were driven to what had\nbeen the ghetto in Latvia -- I mean I know all this, but of course we didn\u2019t realize\nthis when we went there but I knew that subsequently. Apparently, from what I\nknow now, that had been the section of the city that had been a closed ghetto for\nthe Latvian Jews who in December of 1941, had all been taken to the surrounding\nforest and killed and uh ... we went into those apartments and uh ... and were told\nto make yourself at home -- you decide where you want to be. Of course, there\nwas very little room -- generally about three or four people, sometimes five\npeople to each room -- kitchens being included as a room.",
        "Q: The Riga 377 ? was an enclosed ghetto?",
        "A: It was a closed ghetto, not an open ghetto. You know apparently in those days,\nfrom what I know now, there were open ghettos where people could come and go\nas they wished and there were closed ghettos where there were fences around\nthem and you had to pass a gate and you could only go out in order to work and\nthat was for a specific work purpose -- you could not go out. Riga had been --\nhad always been a closed ghetto from the beginning.",
        "Q: So they brought you in the ghetto and they said \u201cFind a place\u2019?",
        "A: They brought us to ... they would count out a hundred people and say \u201cHere 1s a\nbuilding, this is it -- go to it.\u201d And it was amazing, in some places, there was still\nfood on the table, of course everything was cold -- there were no in apartment\ntoilets -- it had been a very poor part of the city. But there were toilets on each\nfloor but because it had been left unattended for month or six weeks, all the toilet\nfacilities were frozen and that became a real problem I remember during the first\nfew months. Because, as you know, nothing unfreezes, it never gets above\nfreezing -- so it was really a ... that was one of our little problems. Uh ... we sort\nof ... we didn\u2019t know what to do for the first few days, nobody really paid any\nattention to us -- they would give us food, they brought it around in kettles -- in\ncommunity kitchens and what have you, but ... I would say that probably for the\nbeginning, the food was fairly adequate, there was enough of it.",
        "Q: So you would go outside to ...",
        "A: Yeah. We would go outside to get the food.",
        "Q: Was there some type of Jewish council?",
        "A: There was nothing at the beginning. All these things formed as we stayed there\nfor a while. First of all, the biggest trauma that I experienced probably in my\nentire concentration camp life, was during the first two weeks of it and during the\nlast three months of it. So let me go into the first two weeks of it so that I can tell\nyou best as to what I recall best about it. As I said, I was with my grandmother\nwho was in those days, probably in her early sixties and uh ... if I remember\ncorrectly, fairly old looking. It really fits the image -- she had gray hair and she\nwas a little lady, maybe a little on the heavy side, not too ... but maybe a little on\nthe heavy side. We were together in a kitchen with two other people, with a\nsingle woman and a single man. I don\u2019t remember exactly how we slept -- all I\nremember is that nobody really had any purpose. I mean, everything was aimless,\nwe just would -- I would -- you know being a thirteen and a half year old kid, I\nwas kind of curious and I would walk around and scavenge around and look for\nthings and try to get into building that were not -- that were not occupied which of\ncourse you weren\u2019t supposed to do, but I really hadn\u2019t quite gotten used to the\nidea of imprisonment yet. Uh .. I would say that about the fourth or fifth day that\nwe were there, when we went out to get our meal, they asked us for volunteers to\nhelp to sort clothes ad I said to my grandmother, \u201cI think I\u2019d like to go\u201d and she\nsaid, no, don\u2019t go and I said \u201c\u2018yeah, I want to do this. I have nothing to do.\u201d So I\ndid, and I remember that they brought us into a big hall and we had to sort.\nApparently those were the clothes of the Latvian Jews which we of course didn\u2019t\nknow. And we had to put sweaters with sweaters and pants with pants -- stuff like\nthat. I mean, something that a thirteen and a half year old could easily do.",
        "Q: Were there other children there, that you recall?",
        "A: Not really. By that .. you know, the last few years, the only time I really saw\nchildren was at school. I mean, there was no way that you could play with other\nchildren, you know that ... and I really would spend more time with adults than I\nwould spend with children anyways. So uh...",
        "Q: How long did the sorting go on?",
        "A: Oh, that was just a day. It was just a day\u2019s job, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. And you\nknow, when I made my way back, to this kitchen where we were living but my\ngrandmother wasn\u2019t there and uh ... I asked for her but nobody knew where she\nwas. And then it turned out that a number of the older people had been taken\naway. And apparently the first, I know now ... but as far as I was concerned, she\nhad just disappeared. But we know now that the Germans in Latvia first\nexperimented with those trucks whereby they would direct the exhaust into the\ntruck and uh .. while they were driving the people would suffocate and then they\nwould just unload them and ... you know, go for the next load. Of course, later\non, that turned out to be a very tedious and slow process and they couldn\u2019t handle\nvery many people. They could only take like twenty or thirty people in each truck\nand there wasn\u2019t really an efficient way for the Germans to do the job so they\nsubsequently abandoned that method and used the shower rooms and what have\nyou. So uh.. the first few days without my grandmother were really an extremely\ndifficult time for me because I had always been a sheltered kid, had always been\nwith adults, had always been with my family and uh .. it was really very traumatic\n-- to be all of a sudden by yourself and to ... it was a mixture of feeling lonely and\nfeeling afraid and feeling scared and uh .. I wasn\u2019t really as much worried about\nmy life as I was just at a loss about what happens now? Where do I go? Who is\ngoing to take care of me? And the realization that I would have to take care of\nmyself or I wouldn\u2019t exist. I continued living in that kitchen with these two single\npeople for a ... for some time. I remember sleeping on the floor while they\nshared a bed. They turned out .. they became lovers later on which amazingly\nenough that people would think about those kind of things in the ghetto but I\nguess, love is a pretty powerful influence, it comes right after food.",
        "Q: Was this kitchen heated at all?",
        "A: Yes, there was heat. There was heat and there was, really I must say, there was\nheat and from what I can recollect, there was really adequate food. We were not\nstarved. There was never really like a whole lot but there was enough.",
        "Q: Twice a day you would get food?",
        "A: Yeah, twice a day we would get food and I continued working sorting the clothes\n-- I continued doing that and uh .. we worked no more than eight hours so it was a\nrelatively normal workday. Most of the work that I did was done in the ghetto but\nI know that there were other groups that assembled -- there was a large square in\nthe ghetto -- that assembled, and they were marched out of the ghetto to do work.",
        "Q: As a young boy, what was your impression of the S.S. or the guards?",
        "A: Well, you know, one of the overriding and important thoughts that you have is\nthat you worry about nothing other than keeping yourself alive and you go from\nday to day and that impulse intensifies, becomes more important. You hide from\nthose that you feel can hurt you, you are anxious not to share anything that you\nhave with those that are with you. There are stories now about many friendships\nhaving formed in the ghettos and in the concentration camps. I have never\nexperienced that and as far as I am concerned, I was very selfish and very self-\ncontained. I was never able to get an advantage in any way whereby I could work\na little less or get a little extra food, I was very anxious to preserve that for myself\nand not tell anybody else about it and so, if anything, that mentality was probably\none of the ugliest aspects of our imprisonment because we became totally\noblivious to those around us -- sometimes to the extent that if you saw somebody\nwho was being kicked or beaten or abused or killed or hanged -- one of the\nfeelings that would come to your mind first was boy, am I glad it\u2019s not me. And\nrather than feeling sorry for the first that this was being done to, and I think this\nwas one of the, one of the dehumanizing and ugliest aspects of the whole ... of\nthat whole situation. So, let me go back to the kitchen.",
        "Q: Do you recall the couple\u2019s names?",
        "A: I recall their last names. It happened to be Levy in both instances. He was\nHermann Levy I believe but I don\u2019t know what her name was. I mean .. there\nwere .. again, we were .. we really lived along side each other not with each other.\nWe didn\u2019t share anything and we talked but it wasn\u2019t ... 1t was just like strangers\ntalking at a bus stop, that kind of thing. We really lived, just happened to be in\nthe same place. After ... the ghetto life sort of normalized itself if you can speak\nof such a thing. There was a council of elders that had been formed and there was\na ghetto hospital and there was even, would you believe, a synagogue -- that was\nnot a synagogue, per se but there were services being held in somebody\u2019s room\nand uh .. whenever I could, I started going to services -- which were not well\nattended incidentally -- uh .. from what I understand, the hospital in the ghetto\nperformed abortions because children were not allowed to be born.",
        "Q: Some woman : Excuse me, were there mostly Germans in the ghettos at this\npoint?",
        "A: Yes, at that point there were mostly Germans and a few Latvian Jews and some\nCzechoslovakian Jews. In fact, we lived in buildings .. the building that I lived in\nwas a Berlin building and then there was a Hamburg building and so on and so\nforth and there was a group from Cologne and various parts of Germany. One of\nthe ladies who lived in the building became the secretary to one of the elders --\nthe Jewish elders -- Alteste Rat as it was called. And through her, I became .. I\ngot a job as a messenger for the Alteste Rat, of course there was no phone so\nwhen messages had to be brought from one place to another, somebody had to\ncarry them and she arranged for me to have that job. And uh .. I did that for\nprobably, I would say a year. Then that summer, it petered out and I went back to\nsorting clothes and uh .. subsequently, I had gotten a little bit stronger and quite a\nbit leaner -- I had been a fat kid and I lost most of that -- so one of the guards\nnoticed me and I was sent to a ... I went on a fairly extended trip, cutting lumber\nin what was then Russia in a place called the Germans call it Pleskau, P-L-E-S-\nK-A-U, the Russian name today is Pskov P-s-k-o-v. And we were probably there\nfor a.. oh, I would say a week or two weeks or something like that.",
        "Q: You were transported out of the ghetto ..",
        "A: Transported out of the ghetto to that place, cutting down trees, which I had never\ndone before -- but that was all right. We .. we lived in abandoned farmhouse I\nremember. We also -- I was also put on -- they call Commando -- to a place\ncalled Rzekne and while I was there, I was ... I came in contact with Boleslav\nMichovsky who has become fairly well known in this country because he was the\ncarpenter in Minneola that was accused of the war crimes -- as a war criminal and\nthen I guess he lost -- was stripped of his citizenship and was supposed to be\ndeported and he is now on trial in Germany for his crimes. Probably now he 1s in\nhis eighties so he will probably never ... never make it but in any event, that ..\nthat became a fairly celebrated case.\nEnd of Side A.\nStart again at 000 on Side B.",
        "A: O.K.",
        "Q: What did you do on that commando?",
        "A: I think we also did lumber, we also did wood.",
        "Q: Did everyone survive those commandos?",
        "A: Yeah, you know I haven\u2019t really spoken much about guards about suffering per se\nbecause, there really, in all fairness to the Germans, we didn\u2019t have much contact\nwith the guards. There were very few S.S. men or guards in the ghetto -- I mean\nwe were just sort of like in a steam cooker -- we were left to cook by ourselves.\nThere were obviously people -- guards at the gates uh ... I don\u2019t remember any\nspecific acts of cruelty or harassment in the ghetto. There were at work, if we\ndidn\u2019t work fast enough, they would kick us or prod us with a shovel or rifle or\nsomething like that but it really wasn\u2019t the real gruesome things that you hear\nabout --those really all came later and in the various concentration camps. Uh...\nI am going to try to put this in a proper time frame now. I stayed in the ghetto\nprobably from the beginning of February 1942 until uh ... late in 1943 or maybe\neven the beginning of \u201944 and uh .. no, no, it wasn\u2019t that long -- excuse me, I\u2019m\nsorry. It was from the beginning of \u201942 until probably early \u201943. Then the\nGermans were beginning to liquidate the ghettos and were moving people into\nlabor camps and concentration camps. Uh.. I would say it was somewhere in \u00b043,\nearly \u201943, maybe middle of \u201943. It seems to me that it was either spring or\nsummer, that the spring and summer in Russia are very short and don\u2019t last long.\nUh ... we were brought from the ghetto to a concentration camp called\nKaiserwald, and from there, where we really stayed a relatively short time, and\nthen were brought to a factory in Riga that specialized in receiving, sorting,\ncleaning and rehabilitating uniforms for the German army from the front -- 1t was\ncalled ABA 701 -- ABA standing for Armee Bekleidung Amt ( Mr. Lachman\nspells these words out ) Amt being bureau. And there we had much more contact\nwith the guards and there was a great deal more harassment and a great deal more\nsupervision and of course that was beginning to be real concentration camp like\nwhere instead of, this was a big old factory building -- 1t was a factory that had\nmanufactured blue color, blue dye and everything in that place was still blue -- I\nremember that like it was yesterday -- it was called Riga Ultramarine, they had\nmade artificial, I guess, artificial blue color.",
        "Q: What was your job there?",
        "A: Sorting. Just sorting and I was .. I was somehow ... I stayed with that sorting\nstuff, I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I became a specialist -- I don\u2019t know (laughs).\nBut there we were constantly supervised by the S.S. people and constantly\nharassed and constantly kicked and constantly you know ... annoyed. And uh...\nwe Slept in the typical concentration camp arrangement where there were like ...\nthey weren\u2019t beds ... they were like big platforms, one on top of the other, three\nhigh or four high. Everybody would lie in the ... on the platform and it was so\ncrowded that you know, you couldn\u2019t really turn. You had to lie on your side and\nof course, men were separated from women in that situation. There were\ncommunal baths and it was really like a concentration camp arrangement.\nIncidentally, let me go back to the ghetto for a minute. Uh .. from time to time,\npeople would try to escape from the ghetto and as they were caught they would be\nbrought back and hanged and everybody would have to march by in the morning\nand they would generally leave hanging there for, especially in the winter time\nwhen everything froze, sometimes four or six weeks just sort of as a memento so\nthat everybody could see it every day and I guess that was supposed to discourage\nus from running away. I must tell you that I really never had any thoughts about\nrunning away or anything like that because I couldn\u2019t envision myself ... I had a\ndifficult time enough getting along -- I had no contacts. I didn\u2019t speak Latvian -- I\nonly spoke German. I mean there was just no way. Also our hair was cropped\nclose and through the middle we had a shaven strip that was re-shaven probably\nevery two or three weeks so ... and the women were completely shaven. Their\nheads were completely shaven so you would stand out from the population. I\ndon\u2019t know how people ... I guess some people did get away -- you know, not\nmany but I guess some people did. I mean there are many recorded instances\nknown of people who actually ran away from .. especially from ghettos and\njoining partisans or undergrounds or what have you. I don\u2019t know that there was\nmuch of an underground in Latvia because the Latvians really, from everything\nwe could see, were really very much pro German and very much anti Russian and\nI think the Latvians were probably rooting for the Germans to win and uh .. I\nwould say that the Latvians were basically more -- more the Latvians than the\nLithuanians-- were probably more, more antagonistic towards us than many of the\nGermans were so I couldn\u2019t envision escaping into that element. Uh ... let me go\nback to where I was -- to the living conditions in that ABA 701.",
        "Q: A quick question?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- You were obviously growing this whole time, were you able to find new\nclothing for yourself? Through your sorting were you able to pull through any ...",
        "A: Well, you couldn\u2019t ... well, I'll tell you -- I did that once and it wasn\u2019t such a\ngood thing. Uh ... it turned out to be a mistake. Uh... well, you know, we had\nuniforms. We had those blue and white striped uniforms. Incidentally, for one\nreason or another, amazingly enough, I still have my uniform cap. I still have\nthat. The original uniform cap.",
        "Q: That was once you were in this ABA --",
        "A: In the ghetto, you wore civilian clothes and I don\u2019t know how I made out. I really\ndon\u2019t .. you know, it was so long ago, some of that stuff just, just doesn\u2019t stick\nout. Um.. while I was in that ABA 701, I stole a pair of shoes because my shoes\nwere just completely gone and uh .. I muddied them up a little bit, you know the\noutsides so that they would look old. But of course, you couldn\u2019t disguise that\nand I was found out and uh .. I was called to the commander and first got a good\nbeating and then he said, \u201cWell, I guess we will have to execute you.\u201d So, I went\nback and I said well, I guess this is it. But somewhere later on, one of the guards\ncame back and said \u201c Well, he\u2019s changed his mind, all you have to do ..\u201d, he gave\nme an iron bar to carry and I had to carry it, you know there was a four floor\nbuilding, I had to carry that bar up and down the stairs for I don\u2019t know how many\ntimes .. fifty times, maybe a hundred times -- I don\u2019t know what it was, but that\nwas my punishment and of course I got a pair of wooden shoes which was the\nworst punishment because I had to wear those for the next couple of years and it\nwas really hard to walk on them. But..",
        "Q: Where did you find those shoes that you took?",
        "A: I took them from the ones, all the things that came in, the things that I was sorting.\nUh .. before long, there wasn\u2019t really a whole lot of sorting to do, so instead of\nsorting clothes they switched us to loading and unloading ships, that came into the\nRiga harbor and uh .. that was a lousy job because first of all, it was cold and it\nwas wet and we then worked twelve hour shifts -- you either worked the night\nshift or the day shift and there was really no place to hide -- you were outside --\nand the worst of it all was that the Russians used to come and bomb the harbor all\nthe time and we had really no protection -- all you could do was try to get off the\nship as quickly as you could and you know they had these flares that they would\ndrop and the sky would be lit up and they had machine gun ships and they ... in\nthose days, the Russians we were really beginning to make substantial progress\nand were moving against the Germans -- pretty well down into Russia.",
        "Q: Were these troop ships or just cargo ships?",
        "A: Cargo ships -- no troop ships. We were loading and unloading ammunition. We\nwere loading and unloading supplies -- if we were loading supplies, sometimes\nwe would try to steal some of the food if we could and again, anybody that got\ncaught really got into serious problems. Uh .. I remember taking a package once\nof something and under great personal peril and when I unpacked it, I found out it\nwas mustard -- that just goes to show you that you never know about all those\nthings -- so instead of food, I got mustard. Um ..I was very angry at that time\nbecause I had taken a tremendous chance to do it. It seems silly now but I didn\u2019t\nlaugh then.",
        "Q: Your food rations at that point had decreased?",
        "A: The food rations at that point had deteriorated and uh .. things were really getting\ntougher every day. But as long as we could work and I guess we were a pretty\ngood working group, they would keep us going. We were concerned because\nespecially the ones that were older than I could see that the tide of the war was\nturning against the Germans and uh .. they were -- they would say, well, gee, what\nare they going to do with us if they have to get out of here. ---I would like to take\na minute or two and talk about some of the older people who were in the camp\nbecause, you know, I had uh .. I was young. I was 14 or 15, 16, whatever age I\nwas at that time, I never had the opportunity to acquire any personal dignity if you\nknow what that means -- in other words, I never had a real position in life where I\nhad self respect, where people looked up to me, where people felt this is a great\nguy or what have you. So, probably on the whole, the whole ghetto and\nconcentration life was easier for me than for some of these people. I remember\none of the people that worked with us in that ABA 701, had been the chief\ngynecologist in one of the leading hospitals in Berlin. Now you know, I can just\nimagine what scrounging for food -- the loss of dignity, being kicked around,\nbeing cursed at -- I sort of took that in stride. I had grown up with it. I had been\ncursed at on the way to school so you kind of become accustomed to it -- you\ndon\u2019t like it -- but you figure out that\u2019s the way life is. But I wonder how life was\nfor those people and it must have been much more difficult than it was for me and\nuh .. well, I didn\u2019t have any particular empathy for him at that time. Now I can\nthink back, I feel that that must have been a degradation to him a great deal worse\nthan it was for me. Uh.. O.K. -- so much about that. So, let\u2019s get back to the end\nof the German occupation of Riga. By that time, as I said, the Russians were\nraiding us almost every night -- by raiding \u201cus\u201d -- raiding the Germans. And of\ncourse the Russians didn\u2019t know we were there. In fact, towards the end, the\nGermans were parking trains -- there was a train track right through that ABA 701\n-- that old factory that we were at, and the Germans were parking trains that were\nloaded with ammunition right along side us, so we didn\u2019t care -- it didn\u2019t make\nany difference but they obviously did that on purpose. Uh .. for one reason or\nanother, the Germans decided to keep us instead of shooting us which was really,\nreally was amazing because in retrospect, I know many people were not as\nfortunate. The Germans withdrew all their forces in Latvia to a uh .. toa\nbridgehead in Libau -- German name, the Latvian name that it goes by now is\nLiepaja. It is a port that is not on the Gulf of Riga but is on the Baltic Sea. It is\nalso in Latvia. It is really not far from Riga. And they brought us there and that\nwas a smaller group. They took some of the people that had worked on that ABA\n701 and brought them back to Kaiserwald or Stuthoff near Danzig which 1s also a\nlarge concentration camp. And they took probably 80 of us. And again, I don\u2019t\nknow why .. how I was selected to be part of it -- I wasn\u2019t a better worker than\nanybody else -- I wasn\u2019t a particularly strong or healthy individual -- I was\nprobably as emaciated as everybody else. I think a lot of it was God\u2019s providence\nand luck. So I was amongst these eighty people that were brought to that place\nLibau or Liepaja and we were housed in I guess it had been an old mansion -- it\nwas near the ocean, on a beautiful street -- but there was barbed wire around it.\nWe were loading and unloading ships -- mostly at that point, we were not\nunloading anything more -- we were loading. The Germans were trying to carry\nback everything that they could carry back. I remember, we were dismantling\neven the tin roofs -- putting the sheets of tin in wooden enclosures and they were\nbeing shipped back to Germany. They were just stripping the place and we were\nthere for ... that must have been late \u201944, that must have been, I would say, early\nFall to late Fall \u201944, and we were there for several months doing that particular\nthing. One of the unfortunate things that happened there was that one of the\nRussian bombs hit the building that we were in and probably fifteen or so of us\nwere killed. Uh .. which was really too bad. Uh .. again, you don\u2019t feel -- I did\nnot feel, particularly sorry for them, I felt particularly glad that 1t wasn\u2019t me.\nAnd, that is one thing that I won\u2019t forgive the Germans for -- is that\ndehumanization of people -- of this complete destruction of the human spirit and\nof the human compassion and you know, that was awful. It was hard to come\nback and maybe you didn\u2019t come back all the way. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure.\nMaybe, I will never be as compassionate of a person as you, I have no idea. But\nin any event, we were there for a while and again, those of us ... the older people\ntend to be more concerned with the future -- the people of my age really were\nworried with day to day. \u201cHow am I going to have food today? How can I work\nthe least today? How can I get the best night\u2019s sleep? How can I ...?\u201d That was\nabout it. \u201cHow can I keep my behind clear so that nobody kicks me around?\u201d\nThat kind of thing. And again, people were worried about what will they do with\nus when this is over with. And again, it was perhaps divine providence or perhaps\nluck or whatever, they decided to take us back to Germany. As they were\nevacuating the bridgehead in Libau, they put us on a.. a .. in the hold of a ship full\nof freight, by that time we were down to about fifty or sixty people, and brought\nus back to Germany.",
        "Q: How long was that journey?",
        "A: I would say three or four days. I remember that there was no food on that trip and\nthat was kind of gruesome but at least we were getting back. I think probably\nthey didn\u2019t want to leave us or didn\u2019t want to leave our bodies for the Russians to\nfind. I think really that was probably the rationale because I can\u2019t think of any\nother reason why they would take us back, because by that time, they didn\u2019t need\nus anymore. By that time, they had no more use for our labor because that was\nearly \u00b045 and you know .. the thing had completely disintegrated. It was either\nDecember \u00b044 or January \u00b045, I don\u2019t know which but it was probably December\n\"44, by that time, Germany was in such disarray that there was no work to be done\nanymore. As I said, the last time .. while we were in Libau towards the end, we\nwere dismantling buildings and shipping them back which was really one of those\nnonsense jobs kind of a thing. There was no reason for it. What were they going\nto do with sheets of metal? You know, there was no need for it any more. Uh...\nI remember the ship coming in ... of course we were 1n the hold, we couldn\u2019t see\nanything and uh ... when they let us off the ship in Hamburg, I remember terrible\ndevastation in the harbor in Hamburg. It really looked .. we were amazed, I mean\nwe hadn\u2019t been back to Germany ... this was Germany that was so destroyed. Uh\n... and, I really think they didn\u2019t know what to do with us when they got us back.\nIt was the kind of thing where somebody says, \u201cwhat did you bring us here, where\ndid you get these guys? What am I supposed to do with them?\u201d That kind of\nthing. You know. So uh... for want of a place, they brought us to a jail -- a city\njail, in Hamburg and they put all of us in two cells. Which was awful crowded\nand uh .. we had just nothing to do for probably .. they kept us there for I would\nsay three or four weeks. We got very inadequate food, they did take us out a few\ntimes and the only thing we did when they took us out -- we were collecting shell\nfragments from the anti-aircraft guns that had fallen -- you know they were really\njagged fragments. I don\u2019t know if you have ever seen an anti-aircraft shell -- they\nare jagged pieces of metal. You have to be careful when you pick them up\nbecause they are really sharp in some instances and we put them on, in Europe\nthey use these trailer trucks that are open trailers in the back but we no longer had\ntrucks because they didn\u2019t have any gasoline so we had to pull the trailers. But\nagain .. this was a nonsense job -- it was really not a job that meant anything\nbecause nothing was going anywhere -- nothing was functioning anymore. You\nknow .. Germany for all practical purposes, really had stopped functioning in\nthose days. Uh... I suppose, somewhere in the middle or towards the end of\nJanuary, uh .. maybe the director of the prison wanted to get rid of us and said \u201c\nlook, take these guys away, I don\u2019t want them here\u201d or somebody said, \u201c\u201cWhat do\nwe do with these people?\u201d So, they put us in two small trucks and took us to\nBergen-Belsen which is not far from Hamburg.",
        "Q: How long were you in that jail?",
        "A: I would say about a month. Maybe three weeks. You know, you lose track of\ntime and uh .. even if I did remember, I don\u2019t remember anymore now. Uh...\nwhen we went to -- they took us to Bergen-Belsen, 1n Bergen-Belsen, they gave\nus anew number. My old concentration camp number -- which incidentally I was\nnever tattooed, I don\u2019t know why, maybe they weren\u2019t doing it that day that I got\nmy number or something but the old number had been 12360 and I was then\ngiven the number 15713. Um... we got a new number, we got put in barracks and\nuh .. we got locked in and that was the end of that. We just didn\u2019t hear or see\nfrom anybody any more. It was just like a .. you were left to your own devices.\nWe got some food but we got very little water uh .. I remember there were these\npools in the camp which were supposed to be water pools that were used .. that\nwere supposed to be used if there was a fire uh .. they were supposed to pump\nwater out of those pools with a fire truck and we would drink that water. Later\non, we found dead bodies in those pools -- there was ... you know -- 1t was just a\nnightmare and people were sick. I contracted typhus -- I had terrible diarrhea, I\nmean just every day, you would drag yourself outside of the barrack and sit out\nthere all day long, leaning up against something and when it got dark, you drag\nyourself back in. There was no more roll call. You know, during the\nconcentration camp -- every morning there was roll call and all that kind of stuff.\nPeople would come to make sure that nobody escaped. I mean order, total order\nhad broken down, it was just a question of .. the only question that was in our\nminds, \u2018How can we survive this? How can we keep this up? How can we stay\nwell enough until this is over?\u201d And you know, every day, hundreds of people\nwere dying -- dozens of people. We would try to at least, we couldn\u2019t bury them -\n- we weren\u2019t strong enough for that -- we would drag them towards a place where\nthey would all be together. I mean there was no brutality by guards -- there were\nno guards -- there was nobody there. They just put you in a room and locked the\ndoors and they would once in a while give us some food -- some watery soup that\nwas sort of shoved through the gate and anybody that was strong enough to get to\nthe gate could get some but a lot of people couldn\u2019t even get up and um .. would\njust die where they lay. Um ... I was in Bergen-Belsen probably for three\nmonths. On the day that I now know was April 15, 1945, we saw tanks with stars\non them coming through the barbed wire and uh .. that was the British army and\nuh .. the German guards were either -- the ones that hadn\u2019t melted away, I imagine\na lot of them had run away -- were taken prisoner and the British came in and I\nguess they were pretty horrified by what they saw because they just couldn\u2019t cope\nwith it. You know, this was an advancing army, they don\u2019t -- how could they\nhave medical facilities for uh .. I believe the records indicate that there were\n13,000 unburied dead were found in the camp -- 23,000 unburied dead were\nfound in the camp -- 13,000 were to die from the time that the British took over\nuntil they were finally able to bring sanitation and what have you into the camp.\nUh .. the British couldn\u2019t really do anything for us for the first couple of weeks --\nthey did bring us food but it was rich food that we really couldn\u2019t eat -- but at\nleast we got water. There was no medical attention because how could you have\nenough doctors to take care of all these people. And again, it was probably fate or\ndivine providence that I got better. And a number of us got better. We were then\n... the British decided to burn .. oh, the British used the German guard to bury all\nthe unburied dead. We saw that and it was sort of satisfaction to us, I guess. Uh ..\nthey burned down the camp because they thought that all the barracks had been so\npolluted and so full of excrement and blood and whatever -- there was just no way\nto preserve it and they moved us into a nearby um .. what had been German army\ncamp, in fact, when I went back to Bergen-Belsen -- it is again a German army\ncamp. You know .. they were two story buildings, it was a parade ground and\ntypical kind of thing. And we were in there and that\u2019s when I would say -- I\nprobably had a recuperation period of three to four months -- we got medical care.\nWe got adequate ... we certainly got food. We were treated like human beings.\nAnd it\u2019s amazing how fast you snap back and start thinking in terms of enjoying\nyour life. I had missed really all my childhood -- really missed all my teenage\nyears. Those were the days when I first -- when I all of a sudden became\ninterested in girls. You know after I got better and I guess the girls became\ninterested in boys and we would talk and you know .. there would be the normal\numm ... social ... intercourse between people where you would spend time\ntogether and enjoy each other\u2019s company. Uh... one of the people who worked for\nthe British Red Cross, a lady -- I spoke some English because I had taken English\nin school, and probably spoke more than a passable English -- not really great but\nmore than passable. She came into the barracks one day and said is there anyone\nhere who speaks English and I said yeah, I speak English. So she needed, she was\nrunning a supply uh .. warehouse .. the British call it a Supply Dump but it\u2019s\nreally not a dump, it\u2019s a warehouse for the refugees. It was organized by the\nBritish Red Cross and order of St. John and I became an interpreter for her and\nlater became attached to the British army as an interpreter and that\u2019s why I am\nwearing the uniform in these pictures. And amazingly enough, I kept in touch\nwith this lady -- Mrs. Payton for all these years. She just passed away probably a\nyear ago or two years ago. We would exchange Christmas gifts and letters and\nphone calls and she came to visit us once and what have you. And uh .. I worked\nfor this British Supply D ump as an interpreter and those were wonderful\ndays -- it was like .. well .. like being let out of a cage. You know, it was\namazing. We could get the normal haircuts and we could wear normal clothes,\nwe could talk to other people. We felt that we were equal to -- well, you know,\nafter things like that, you really don\u2019t feel that you are equal to anybody and you\nfeel always in intimidation of people in uniform or the sense of awe of that and\nprobably to some extent, I have never lost that entirely. Uh .. the respect for\nauthority 1f you know what I mean. If somebody tells you that you are not\nsupposed to do it, you just don\u2019t do it or else.",
        "Q: How long did you work with the British?",
        "A: I worked for the British probably until late 42. Late .. excuse me. I\u2019ve got my\ndates all wrong. Late \u201945, I\u2019m sorry, late \u201945, maybe early \u201946. Uh... then, I\nstarted really thinking seriously about what are you going to do with yourself.\nWhere do you go from here? Uh .. most of the people that were with me at the\ntime, the young people -- almost everybody who survived was young. There were\nno old people. I would say everybody was between 15 and 30. There was\nnobody older that made it. Most of the young people wanted to go to Israel which\nwas then Palestine. Uh .. I felt that Israel was an agriculture society which was\nwhat it was and that was not what I wanted to do. Uh... I wanted to go\nsomewhere else -- I wasn\u2019t sure. For some crazy reason, I ... my father\u2019s sister\nand her husband had gone to the United States before the war and for some crazy\nreason I remember their address. I don\u2019t know how I ever possibly did that but I\ndid do it, O.K. And I wrote them a letter and made contact with them. So, I had\nan opportunity to go to the United States -- some other people who did not want to\ngo to Israel wanted to go to Australia and you know, and we pretty much, except\nfor Israel, could decide where we wanted to go. We could stay in Germany, some\nof the people who had been from Eastern Europe had wanted to go back. Not\nmany of them, but some did. So...",
        "Q: Did you think of returning to Berlin?",
        "A: No. No. I wanted to have no part of Germany, wanted to have no part of Europe.\nI wanted to go somewhere else.",
        "Q: Some woman: Your uncle was in Germany.",
        "A: My uncle was in Israel.",
        "Q: woman: He went back to Germany.",
        "A: That was later. I knew I had an uncle in Israel but I just did not want to go ... I\njust didn\u2019t want to go to Israel. I don\u2019t know why .. yes, I do know why. I didn\u2019t\nwant to work on a farm. I didn\u2019t want to do that. I wanted to work in some kind\nof a trade or business enterprise or that kind of thing. Uh ... so .. uh, I decided\nthat if I wanted to go .. I finally decided that I wanted to go to America, to the\nUnited States, and in order to do that, I had to really get into what was then the\nAmerican Zone of occupation. It was very difficult to get from the British zone of\noccupation to the United States. So, this Mrs. Payton wrote a recommendation for\nme to the United Nations Headquarters in Munich and also a friend of mine who\nwas a Canadian captain who I also met after the war in Germany did the same\nthing. And uh .. I had to get permission to take a train -- you know, everything\nwas still in disarray. So I went to Munich and started working for the United\nNations --, the United Nations Legal and Rehabilitation Administration doing the\nsame thing again in a warehouse for relief supplies and I applied for going to the\nUnited States and came here in September 1946. I had the relatives -- my father\u2019s\nsister lived in Springfield, Massachusetts. I had some other relatives who lived in\nSpringfield Illinois and we were given, before we left Germany, we were given\nten dollars as money for -- we came on one of the tube ships the \u201cS.S. Marlin\u201d -- I\nremember that. I remember having our first oranges aboard ship and orange juice.\nI never had orange juice before in my life and you know, just to see oranges in\nbins -- you know ... I hadn\u2019t seen those in ten years. I hadn\u2019t seen eggs in ten\nyears -- well, not ten years but five anyway. So, you know, this was an amazing\nsight. It is hard for anyone to imagine that kind of stuff. And uh .. since I had\nseven dollars left out of the ten dollars, when I came here, and that was not\nenough to go to Springfield, Illinois, so I chose to go to Springfield,\nMassachusetts. Which was that train fare here and that\u2019s basically.",
        "Q: You landed in New York?",
        "A: I came to New York City first. I did not like New York City, inside or outside. I\nhad some relatives in New York. I guess it was the sister of my grandmother or\nsomething like that and I stayed with her for a couple of weeks. First of all, it was\nvery difficult to find a job in New York because that was the time when all the\nGI\u2019s were being demobilized and of course, they had first right -- as well they\nshould -- for all the jobs. And uh .. I went to Springfield and I guess I hung\naround for about two or three weeks doing nothing and just enjoying this\nwonderful country and all the opportunities and I decided that I wanted to work in\neither a wholesale or a retail business. Springfield had kind of a small main street\nand I went from one end to the other trying to find a job in one of the stores and I\ndid not find one. Later that night, somebody called my aunt who I stayed with in\nSpringfield and said, \u201cwell, there\u2019s a person who has a store in an outlying section\nof Springfield who is looking for a stock boy\u201d. I found a job there as a stock boy\n-- then you know, my problem was schooling. I never had more than eight years\nof schooling, so uh, what I need to do was first to get my school equivalency\ncertificate. Which, I don\u2019t know if you have that here but in Massachusetts, you\ngo to the department of education. They devise a plan for you -- evening courses\nthat you have to take, correspondence courses that the State Department of\nEducation gives and I, they devised a plan for me whereby I would get the high\nschool equivalency certificate which I did. Meanwhile I continued working\nduring the day, in that store. I then ended up at Northeastern University at night,\nthere was a Springfield division of Northeastern University -- it was a high school\nequivalency certificate and I went to Northeastern for six years -- always\ncontinuing to work at my job -- gradually advancing from stock boy to sales\nperson. Then I started going for my Masters to American International College --\nanother local college in Springfield. I never got my Masters -- I hope to take\nsome courses now and maybe get it. I ultimately advanced to buyer and then\ngeneral manager and then subsequently the business was sold to a large\ncorporation and I became president then became president for some other\ndepartment stores -- so, I at the height of my career, I ran eleven small New\nEngland Department stores for the Van Heusen shirt corporation and in 1982, I\nhad an opportunity to buy the original store that I had started working at as a stock\nboy, which I did and I just sold it in March of 1992 and I am retired. That\u2019s\nbasically it. I talked for a long time. If you still have ...",
        "Q: Sure -- there\u2019s plenty of tape.",
        "A: Not about Belsen per se. I had wanted to go back to Belsen to see what it was like\nand I was really ... I didn\u2019t do it with an easy heart. I wasn\u2019t sure really what I\nwould find, but I thought it would be a very lonesome place with maybe just a\nfew old guys like myself standing there and saying Kaddish -- that\u2019s a Jewish\nprayer for the dead. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re Jewish -- if you know. So, uh...\ninstead we got there on a Sunday morning -- it had been turned into a memorial\npark and I was really amazed to see probably two hundred young Germans --\nsome with children going there and just looking around. Visiting this memorial\npark, you have all the mass graves that are still there which say \u201cHere lie five\nthousand\u2019, \u201cHere lie five hundred\u201d. \u201cHere lie a thousand\u201d. And so on and so\nforth. But these people had taken their Sundays to go and look at this and it made\nme feel that was kind of a nice thing. That at least these people wanted to know\nabout this period of history.\n"

    "answers": [
        "A: I was born Wolfgang, I guess after Mozart, Louis Lachman on May 26, 1928 in\nBerlin. My father was Max Lachman who was born in the year 1900, also in\nBerlin. He was the son of Louis Lachman and Anna Lachman and by profession\nwas an engineer. He had gone to the University of Berlin and become an\nengineer. My mother was Frieda Schwartz whose father was Gustav Schwartz\nand Recha Schwartz was her mother and was also born in Berlin and they were\nthe proprietors of a wholesale handkerchief and kerchief business. My\ngrandfather served in the first World War as a master sergeant and served in\nvarious theaters of war -- most notably in the French campaigns in Verdun and so\non and so forth. My father joined the German army in 1918 just before the war\nended. While he never saw service in the first world war, he was very active in\nwhat was the campaign by the German army against the Spartacus uprising -- this\nwas an uprising led by Karl Lebclech of basically communist agitators and it was\nput down in 1919, Lebclech was killed. My father fought in that ... against these\nSpartacus revolutionaries and received the Iron Cross, second class for his efforts.\nMy father married in probably 19... ?\u2019m not sure, probably 1926 or 1925 uh...\nfor various reasons, personal and to himself, he chose not to pursue his\nengineering career any further and entered my grandfather\u2019s business to work\nalong with him.",
        "A: He was a mechanical engineer. My grandfather\u2019s business was apparently a very\nthriving .. uh .. place. After I was born in 1928, I remember being there and\nseeing lots of things being shipped out. Big boxes and big storage rooms -- as it\nturned out, when I was first born, we lived in the same building that the business\nwas in. The business was on the ground floor and we lived on -- 1t was an\napartment house and we lived in an apartment. I guess on the third floor above\nthat. Afterwards we moved to what was presumably a better building in the\nwestern section of Berlin which 1s now -- what was until recently, the American\nor the Western zone of Berlin. The business had originally been what was East\nBerlin. Um -- I had always led a very sheltered, quite comfortable childhood.\nGenerally, we had the apartment in the city, we also had a fairly small, little\nsummer house outside of Berlin in a place called Neuenhagen -- it\u2019s really like a\nlittle suburb outside of the city, and we used to go there for weekends when we\nweren\u2019t away. As a general rule, my parents uh .. my mother and my father and\nmy grandmother, went on a vacation every summer. My father stayed with us for\nthe first week -- we would go to Italy or Switzerland or Czechoslovakia -- Marin\nBada Kalspark ?? sticks in my mind or Cantina in Italy and my father stayed with\nus for the first week and at the end of the summer he came and picked us up, so he\nspent a week with us sort of at either end of the vacation. I don\u2019t know how\nimportant it is to this whole narrative, but it will tell you something about my\nbackground.",
        "A: No. I was an only child, from I was told later, I was born by Caesarean section\nand in those days, women chose not to have any more children if they had one by\nCaesarean section. I .. at least that is what I was told, I don\u2019t know how factual\nthat is. Uh.. I like to get to my schooling now. I started going to school -- I\nbelieve in 1933 -- it was just about the time that Hitler came to power and I\nstarted going to a public school -- I remember having to sing the German anthem\nof course, every morning before class. And also the National Socialist anthem\nand soon after that, there was a time when Germany agitated for the return of the\nSaar provinces back to Germany and we had to sing a special song for the return\nof the Saar -- the coal producing -- the steel producing area that had been annexed\nby France -- demilitarized rather.",
        "A: Sang three songs, and I must say that the first two or three years of school really\nproceeding relatively uneventfully -- I can\u2019t recall that there was any particular\nprejudice or any particular hatred or any particular problems that I experienced.",
        "A: Not when I was that small. Later on. As far as religion is concerned -- we were\nmembers of an orthodox congregation that at some point in time during my\nyounger years, my father chose for whatever reason -- my father and mother -- I\nsuppose it was a joint decision -- chose to join a reform movement and we went to\na large -- very elegant reform synagogue. Maybe that had something to do with\nour move to the Western part, I really don\u2019t know how that came about but\nwhatever -- that is what happened.",
        "A: No. I skipped that. My grandfather had died probably six months after I was\nborn. He died of tuberculosis and I do not remember him at all other than from\npictures.",
        "A: Yes. That was my mother\u2019s father. And neither do I remember my father\u2019s\nfather, who had apparently had died before I was born. I do remember my\nfather\u2019s mother and I do remember my mother\u2019s mother. My father\u2019s mother\nlived near us but we never spent as much time with her as we spent with my\nmother\u2019s mother. I don\u2019t know why that is but I suppose that 1s sort of par for the\ncourse, it happens everywhere. And uh .. my mother\u2019s mother really did go along\non all vacations with us -- and sort of -- while she did not live with us -- she lived\nin her own place -- we saw her much more frequently. Every Friday night we\nwent to her house for Friday night dinner which for some traditional reason was\nnot chicken but rather was roast beef -- or whatever -- roast beef and roast\npotatoes or something like that. I am not quite sure. Oh, I would like to talk\nbriefly about my first memories of the Hitler rise to power and socialism and what\nI overheard in our house. -- Um... the first, the first real memory that I have of a\ndiscussing about Hitler was -- or about National Socialists -- was one night when\nwe were visiting my uncle -- this was my mother\u2019s brother -- who also lived in\nBerlin -- who also had been born in Berlin -- but by the way, they did not live too\nfar away from where the Reichstag was. We saw the sky turning red and over the\nradio we heard that there was a fire in the Reichstag and at the time, I remember a\nconversation that my parents had with my uncle about that particular event and\nabout how they thought that 1t probably was a staged event and so on and so forth.\nMy father was fairly conservative, fairly nationalistic German. I think now that if\nthere is a political equivalent in this country now you would probably say that he\nwas very much a conservative republican and he felt that this ... first of all, I\nthink ... basically I suspect, that while he never said so, he probably felt some\nsympathy for some of the things that Hitler stood for. Not of course with the\npersecution of the Jews but with national pride which my father I believe shared\nand he always ... I remember one of the things that he always used to say was,\n\u201cWell, this is an aberration and this man will mellow and change his mind about\nthe Jews, particularly the Jews that had served Germany in the war and so on and\nso forth, or else he will be replaced with someone from his party that doesn\u2019t\nbelieve in all that nonsense and if it doesn\u2019t work out, we will leave on the \u201clast\ntrain\u2019\u201d.\u201d Whatever that \u201clast train\u201d meant, we never caught it. We didn\u2019t make that\nlast train. I am trying to think back now, I am trying to be a little bit ... go more a\nlittle bit in time. Probably about \u201935 or \u00b036, things started changing in Germany\nand Jewish children could no longer attend the regular public schools and I had to\ngo to what was a Jewish school and that school was in the backyard of a\nsynagogue in a fairly old building in the older part of town. And it was necessary\nfor me to either take a subway ---- to take an elevator train, or walk. And, I still\nremember some of my teachers and uh -- that was not .. I think the school was\nvery good. Uh .. I think I missed some of my friends from the public school but I\ngot used to it very quickly and that\u2019s when I started, in addition to having regular\nschooling, I started to have religious instruction also. Peculiarly enough, even so\nthat we belonged then to a reformed synagogue, the religious instruction that I\nreceived was Conservative Judaism -- the reform synagogue did not have any\nreligious school. Uh .. I went to that school for a couple of years and then, you\nknow, I was probably seven, eight years, nine years old and while one is not ...\nreally does not .. is not too politically cognizant of what is going on. I did hear a\nlot of conversation about Jewish doctors being no longer allowed to treat non-\nJewish patients, Jewish attorneys no longer being allowed to practice cases, other\nrestrictions. Also, my father complaining that some of his gentile customers no\nlonger would buy from him or were afraid to buy from him and uh ... there was a\ngeneral deterioration in the quality of life ... not the quality of life so much but\nthe economic aspects of life. As far as I can recall, the quality of our life really\ncontinued pretty much as it had before. We continued to take our summer\nvacations, we continued to go to our summer house in Neunehagen, my parents\ncontinued to go to concerts and to the opera and when I reached this age, they\ntook me once in a while and all those things were opened up to us and we\ncontinued to have a ... I believe an automobile and I believe there came a time\nwhen we could no longer drive the automobile because Jews could no longer\ndrive pleasure vehicles, and my father had to sell it and was pretty disgruntled\nabout that. But meanwhile, he kept saying, \u201cWell this will go away and this will\nblow over and this is just temporary\u201d and his business was still fairly good so he\nwasn\u2019t complaining. So things pretty much continued.",
        "A: Yes, he was really running the business. Since my grandfather died, he was really\nrunning the business. He was doing it. Maybe this was really ... for all I know,\nhe might have gone in the business because my grandfather was sick or was dying\nor something like that ... that there would be continuity for the business -- that\nmight have very well been the reason. Um ... when I left grammar school, which\nwas probably around 1937 or 1938, I don\u2019t remember exactly anymore, we had to\ngo to a different school -- what was known as an upper school -- a Gymnasium\nkind of thing -- but it was not called a Gymnasium because there were not\nsupposed to be Jewish Gymnasium. It was called Jude Schule Nacht Liebplan\nund UberSchule -- UberSchule meaning an upper school kind of a thing. And\nthat was in the Western part of the city. And I really believe that this is when I\nhad my first, first personal contact with prejudice because for some reason or\nother, there were a lot of young kids, non-Jewish young kids who would wait for\nus in order to harass us and beat us up on the way to school and there was just\nreally almost no escaping it and every day it was a challenge to try and devise a\nway to go to school a little different -- different street, different side of the street\nor get off at a different elevator stop -- to try to avoid that. And very often we\nwere successful, very often we were not. Most of the time, I had to go alone\nbecause where I lived there was no other kid that was going to that school and it\nbecame a daily challenge and I really remember being afraid every day to go to\nschool and crying to my mother that I don\u2019t want to go and I\u2019m afraid and this and\nthat and the other thing and my parents said you have to go, you have to go to\nschool. I really don\u2019t know why my parents didn\u2019t accompany me to school but I\nsuppose you can\u2019t do that every day anyways. But somehow, I made school every\nday. I mean, nobody really got hurt seriously, we would just get knocked around a\nlittle bit -- but I was afraid of it. I was never really strong or a very athletic child.\nIn fact my parents tried to encourage that aspect in me and had me join the\nMaccabean soccer league and I had boxing lessons and stuff like that which I was\nnever really good at. I was just as bad at my piano lessons, I was never any good\nat that either. In any event, that became a problem. Then came the Kristallnacht\non November 9, 1938, and at that time, my father\u2019s business was all smeared up\non the outside with \u201cJewish Store\u201d kind of a thing. Even so, it wasn\u2019t really a\nstore -- it was a wholesale business -- people couldn\u2019t really go in and buy. It was\npainted with big letters and people were standing outside and discouraging\ncustomers from going in. Many of the synagogues were burned down -- in fact,\nmost of them. And that was a turning point in the general prosecution er ..\npersecution of the Jews. It really, from then on, everybody\u2019s life sort of became\nmiserable who was still left.",
        "A: No. The school was not vandalized -- the school was fine. There was no problem\nwith the school. Uh..",
        "A: My father, yeah, my father went to work. I think he probably closed for a day or\ntwo but he still had one or two non-Jewish employees who stayed really with him\nuntil the end and in fact, I had been corresponding with one of them soon after the\nwar and I sent him some food packages when I was in Munich after the war but\n... Llost track of him and of course he has to have been dead for many years now.\nAnd uh ... my whole life started to change after November 9\". First of all, that\nsummer -- my mother -- we had been on vacation, I believe in the Hartz\nMountains which are mountains in lower Saxony and my mother became ill,\nwhile we were on vacation and she had to be brought back in an ambulance. I\nremember that. I guess it was some sort of bleeding if one sort or another and she\ndied soon the after of Leukemia.",
        "A: That was the summer of 1939, so it was really a sort of double whammy that year.\nFirst my mother dying and then Kristallnacht was that November. My father --\nsoon after, my father became ill or at least did not feel well. I think that a lot of it\nhad to do with -- probably a lot of it had to do with my mother\u2019s dying -- it had to\ndo with the deterioration of the business -- the general hopelessness if the\nsituation and he still kept saying \u201cThis won\u2019t last -- this won\u2019t last.\u201d But then he\nstarted, I believe, trying to get us out of the country. But after 1939, it was really\nquite difficult -- the European countries like France and Britain would not take uh\n.. Jewish refugees at that time. For the United States, you had to have a relative\nwho guaranteed your financial support. We knew nobody here so that was\nimpossible. My father made some tentative tries to get to a South American\ncountry and I will tell you more about that later. I think he made some contacts in\nChile and I think some work was done along those lines, hoping to get to Chile.",
        "A: No. He was not. He was never in any concentration camp, he was never in any\nforced labor -- he was never really hurt in any way. Uh... my father, I remember\nliving of course with my father and we still had a maid, or a servant in those days.\nThat was a problem too, I believe that sooner or later, we weren\u2019t allowed any\nmore to have a non-Jewish servant living in the household so I think she became a\nday person who would come in. My father became ill and died on December 19,\n1940 of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis was then, still a very dread disease. Today of\ncourse, it has been eradicated -- or maybe it\u2019s coming to the fore again -- I don\u2019t\nknow. But in any event, people would die of tuberculosis and people would talk\nof tuberculosis like we talk of cancer today.",
        "A: Yes, I recall him being ill and I recall him coughing and I recall him going to the\nhospital and I recall visiting him. Of course, you couldn\u2019t go to the regular\nhospital, you had to go to the Jewish hospital -- he went to the Jewish hospital in\nBerlin and died in that hospital. After my father had died, my grandmother\nliquidated their apartment and I moved in with her. That\u2019s my mother\u2019s mother.\nMy father\u2019s mother had died in between somewhere -- somewhere along the line -\n- probably I would say 1935 or 1936, somewhere along that line. But as I said\nearlier, we weren\u2019t really that close to her. So from 1940, after December 1940, I\nmoved in with my grandmother and moved in with her. I remember my Bar\nMitzvah -- which was a very small affair -- but I did have a Bar Mitzvah -- and I\nguess because of my grandmother, it was in an orthodox synagogue. But it was a\nvery small thing in our apartment afterwards with some people coming over.\nNobody could have big festivities any more -- you couldn\u2019t go to restaurants any\nmore and you couldn\u2019t go to concerts any more. My grandmother wasn\u2019t\ninvolved in that kind of thing anyhow -- all that stuff after my mother died. Uh..\nI continued with my schooling while I live with my grandmother and we received\na notice in January 1942 to report for resettlement on let\u2019s say on about the 20\" of\nthat month. I can\u2019t be sure of the correct date, but around the 20\" or 21\u00b0 of\nJanuary 1942. We reported to a very large -- one of the few synagogues that had\nbeen left standing.",
        "A: That\u2019s where we were told to report. One of the few synagogues that had been\nleft standing and they cleared out all the benches and chairs and everybody was\non blankets -- sitting on blankets on the floor and slept there for a day or two\nwhile we were being registered. We were allowed to bring, I think one suitcase\neach and uh .. I remember my grandmother had me put on double clothing -- two\npairs of pants and two shirts and things like that and she took a hundred mark note\nand wrapped it up -- wrapped a yarn around it so it would look like some extra\nsewing material and gave me that to keep in my pocket which turned out to make\nno sense at all but you know, those are things that people do when they don\u2019t\nknow where they are going.",
        "A: No, my grandmother did the packing. Incidentally -- while I was living with my\ngrandmother, she was pursuing this uh ... this Chilean trip or immigration and\nnothing ultimately came of it. I remember even taking lessons because uh .. to\nlearn how to make marzipan so that she would be able to have something that you\ncan make a living in if she came to another country and I would help her do that\nsomehow, it never came out too well when I did it. We practiced cooking\nmarzipan in the house so that we would have something professional or a trade if\nwe ever got to Chile but obviously, nothing ever came of it so as we received our\nnotice in 1942, we registered and there were probably about a thousand people\nand they would -- as I read now, -- they would .. each of the transports would be\nabout a thousand people would be put .. would be sent away.\nQ; How did this notification come to you?",
        "A: It came in the mail.",
        "A: It came in the mail. My grandmother, amazingly enough, did an inventory of all\nour household goods that we had to leave and I still have the inventory so I am\ntrying to collect from the German government for that but who knows? Whatever\n-- whether anything will come of that or not. Maybe nothing ever will. It\u2019s\namazing to see all these things -- she was very meticulous, I mean even to the\nextent of phonograph records as to how many were left behind and so on and so\nforth.",
        "A: We had about ... I would say it was about a week, ten days. That\u2019s really all we\nhad. And we couldn\u2019t take very much so you didn\u2019t need much lead time -- I\nbelieve the suitcase could weigh no more than 30 kgs which is about 60 pounds --\nit is less than we usually take on a vacation trip now -- so you really couldn\u2019t take\nvery much. It turns out later on that we lost everything anyway so it doesn\u2019t make\na difference -- the whole thing was academic. Um ... my last memories of Berlin\nuh .. were that, as we were leaving the synagogue, my ... the principal of my ...\nof the high school that I had gone to was standing at the exit point and gave each\nperson a hard candy and he said goodbye to me and I was surprised that he\nremembered me and then we were put on a truck -- an open truck and the last\nsight that I remember of Berlin is that victory column that site in the middle of the\nTiergarten, it\u2019s just a monument -- nothing really special -- I believe it remembers\n-- it commemorates a victory in the war of 1870-71 against the French. Um...\nwe were brought to a railroad yard and uh ... in freight cars -- you know, in\nregular freight cars ... and they were locked and we started our journey. Many of\nthe people, I remember, were fairly old -- I was the only child in that particular\ncar -- the only youngster. I must have been about fourteen -- about thirteen and a\nhalf years old. It was soon after my Bar Mitzvah. My Bar Mitzvah had been in\nMay 1941 -- June 1941, so this must have been like since months after my Bar\nMitzvah. And uh .. there were pails for toilet needs which were emptied from\ntime to time -- the journey took, I believe, about seven or eight days. It was\ngetting colder, the food was relatively inadequate -- this was 1n the middle of\nwinter -- this was in January and we were headed East so obviously freight cars\nhave no heating facilities -- but there were enough of us in the car so there was a\ncertain amount of human warmth.",
        "A: I was still with my grandmother and incidentally, while we were at the gathering\npoint of the synagogue, I remember seeing my first person dying -- which is really\nsort of indelible in my mind -- I saw many, many more after that but there was a\nman on one of those blankets near us and all of a sudden, he started -- well, I\nguess he had a heart attack and just died. I mean, nobody did anything to him --\nhe just died and that sort of stuck in my mind -- I had never seen that before and it\nwas sort of a frightening thing to a thirteen and a half year old.\nQ For your mother and father when they passed away, was it still possible to have a\nnormal funeral service?\nA Yes, it was. There was a normal .. you know there is a Jewish cemetery in Berlin\nand one of the peculiarities of the German Jewish community was there was one\nvery large cemetery which catered to all the different religious -- religious Jewish\ndenominations so it is a very gigantic place -- it\u2019s still in existence -- I have been\nback there two or three times and it is a very lovely, peaceful place. And there is\na very large family plot that accommodates both my mother and my father, my\ngrandfather, my mother\u2019s brother, who died also of asthma probably somewhere\nin the 30\u2019s -- that plot is still there. O.K. -- how are we doing with the tape?",
        "A: O.K., we are on the cattle car -- or freight car or whatever you want to call that\nthing. A number of people in the car died, but after you see your first person\ndying, you sort of become immune to that.",
        "A: No. They left them. They left them until we got to where we were going. As it\nturned out, we arrived in Riga, which was then the capitol of Latvia and uh .. we\n... aS we got off the cattle cars or freight cars -- it was very cold, and there was a\ngreat deal of snow which was higher than I had ever seen it and we were told to\nput our luggage on sleds which were waiting nearby -- the sleds -- I think they had\nhorses -- and we put the luggage on those sleds and I guess that was the last we\nsaw of them. That was the end of that. Where they took it, we\u2019ll never know --\nbut it was gone. We were then put on other trucks and were driven to what had\nbeen the ghetto in Latvia -- I mean I know all this, but of course we didn\u2019t realize\nthis when we went there but I knew that subsequently. Apparently, from what I\nknow now, that had been the section of the city that had been a closed ghetto for\nthe Latvian Jews who in December of 1941, had all been taken to the surrounding\nforest and killed and uh ... we went into those apartments and uh ... and were told\nto make yourself at home -- you decide where you want to be. Of course, there\nwas very little room -- generally about three or four people, sometimes five\npeople to each room -- kitchens being included as a room.",
        "A: It was a closed ghetto, not an open ghetto. You know apparently in those days,\nfrom what I know now, there were open ghettos where people could come and go\nas they wished and there were closed ghettos where there were fences around\nthem and you had to pass a gate and you could only go out in order to work and\nthat was for a specific work purpose -- you could not go out. Riga had been --\nhad always been a closed ghetto from the beginning.",
        "A: They brought us to ... they would count out a hundred people and say \u201cHere 1s a\nbuilding, this is it -- go to it.\u201d And it was amazing, in some places, there was still\nfood on the table, of course everything was cold -- there were no in apartment\ntoilets -- it had been a very poor part of the city. But there were toilets on each\nfloor but because it had been left unattended for month or six weeks, all the toilet\nfacilities were frozen and that became a real problem I remember during the first\nfew months. Because, as you know, nothing unfreezes, it never gets above\nfreezing -- so it was really a ... that was one of our little problems. Uh ... we sort\nof ... we didn\u2019t know what to do for the first few days, nobody really paid any\nattention to us -- they would give us food, they brought it around in kettles -- in\ncommunity kitchens and what have you, but ... I would say that probably for the\nbeginning, the food was fairly adequate, there was enough of it.",
        "A: Yeah. We would go outside to get the food.",
        "A: There was nothing at the beginning. All these things formed as we stayed there\nfor a while. First of all, the biggest trauma that I experienced probably in my\nentire concentration camp life, was during the first two weeks of it and during the\nlast three months of it. So let me go into the first two weeks of it so that I can tell\nyou best as to what I recall best about it. As I said, I was with my grandmother\nwho was in those days, probably in her early sixties and uh ... if I remember\ncorrectly, fairly old looking. It really fits the image -- she had gray hair and she\nwas a little lady, maybe a little on the heavy side, not too ... but maybe a little on\nthe heavy side. We were together in a kitchen with two other people, with a\nsingle woman and a single man. I don\u2019t remember exactly how we slept -- all I\nremember is that nobody really had any purpose. I mean, everything was aimless,\nwe just would -- I would -- you know being a thirteen and a half year old kid, I\nwas kind of curious and I would walk around and scavenge around and look for\nthings and try to get into building that were not -- that were not occupied which of\ncourse you weren\u2019t supposed to do, but I really hadn\u2019t quite gotten used to the\nidea of imprisonment yet. Uh .. I would say that about the fourth or fifth day that\nwe were there, when we went out to get our meal, they asked us for volunteers to\nhelp to sort clothes ad I said to my grandmother, \u201cI think I\u2019d like to go\u201d and she\nsaid, no, don\u2019t go and I said \u201c\u2018yeah, I want to do this. I have nothing to do.\u201d So I\ndid, and I remember that they brought us into a big hall and we had to sort.\nApparently those were the clothes of the Latvian Jews which we of course didn\u2019t\nknow. And we had to put sweaters with sweaters and pants with pants -- stuff like\nthat. I mean, something that a thirteen and a half year old could easily do.",
        "A: Not really. By that .. you know, the last few years, the only time I really saw\nchildren was at school. I mean, there was no way that you could play with other\nchildren, you know that ... and I really would spend more time with adults than I\nwould spend with children anyways. So uh...",
        "A: Oh, that was just a day. It was just a day\u2019s job, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. And you\nknow, when I made my way back, to this kitchen where we were living but my\ngrandmother wasn\u2019t there and uh ... I asked for her but nobody knew where she\nwas. And then it turned out that a number of the older people had been taken\naway. And apparently the first, I know now ... but as far as I was concerned, she\nhad just disappeared. But we know now that the Germans in Latvia first\nexperimented with those trucks whereby they would direct the exhaust into the\ntruck and uh .. while they were driving the people would suffocate and then they\nwould just unload them and ... you know, go for the next load. Of course, later\non, that turned out to be a very tedious and slow process and they couldn\u2019t handle\nvery many people. They could only take like twenty or thirty people in each truck\nand there wasn\u2019t really an efficient way for the Germans to do the job so they\nsubsequently abandoned that method and used the shower rooms and what have\nyou. So uh.. the first few days without my grandmother were really an extremely\ndifficult time for me because I had always been a sheltered kid, had always been\nwith adults, had always been with my family and uh .. it was really very traumatic\n-- to be all of a sudden by yourself and to ... it was a mixture of feeling lonely and\nfeeling afraid and feeling scared and uh .. I wasn\u2019t really as much worried about\nmy life as I was just at a loss about what happens now? Where do I go? Who is\ngoing to take care of me? And the realization that I would have to take care of\nmyself or I wouldn\u2019t exist. I continued living in that kitchen with these two single\npeople for a ... for some time. I remember sleeping on the floor while they\nshared a bed. They turned out .. they became lovers later on which amazingly\nenough that people would think about those kind of things in the ghetto but I\nguess, love is a pretty powerful influence, it comes right after food.",
        "A: Yes, there was heat. There was heat and there was, really I must say, there was\nheat and from what I can recollect, there was really adequate food. We were not\nstarved. There was never really like a whole lot but there was enough.",
        "A: Yeah, twice a day we would get food and I continued working sorting the clothes\n-- I continued doing that and uh .. we worked no more than eight hours so it was a\nrelatively normal workday. Most of the work that I did was done in the ghetto but\nI know that there were other groups that assembled -- there was a large square in\nthe ghetto -- that assembled, and they were marched out of the ghetto to do work.",
        "A: Well, you know, one of the overriding and important thoughts that you have is\nthat you worry about nothing other than keeping yourself alive and you go from\nday to day and that impulse intensifies, becomes more important. You hide from\nthose that you feel can hurt you, you are anxious not to share anything that you\nhave with those that are with you. There are stories now about many friendships\nhaving formed in the ghettos and in the concentration camps. I have never\nexperienced that and as far as I am concerned, I was very selfish and very self-\ncontained. I was never able to get an advantage in any way whereby I could work\na little less or get a little extra food, I was very anxious to preserve that for myself\nand not tell anybody else about it and so, if anything, that mentality was probably\none of the ugliest aspects of our imprisonment because we became totally\noblivious to those around us -- sometimes to the extent that if you saw somebody\nwho was being kicked or beaten or abused or killed or hanged -- one of the\nfeelings that would come to your mind first was boy, am I glad it\u2019s not me. And\nrather than feeling sorry for the first that this was being done to, and I think this\nwas one of the, one of the dehumanizing and ugliest aspects of the whole ... of\nthat whole situation. So, let me go back to the kitchen.",
        "A: I recall their last names. It happened to be Levy in both instances. He was\nHermann Levy I believe but I don\u2019t know what her name was. I mean .. there\nwere .. again, we were .. we really lived along side each other not with each other.\nWe didn\u2019t share anything and we talked but it wasn\u2019t ... 1t was just like strangers\ntalking at a bus stop, that kind of thing. We really lived, just happened to be in\nthe same place. After ... the ghetto life sort of normalized itself if you can speak\nof such a thing. There was a council of elders that had been formed and there was\na ghetto hospital and there was even, would you believe, a synagogue -- that was\nnot a synagogue, per se but there were services being held in somebody\u2019s room\nand uh .. whenever I could, I started going to services -- which were not well\nattended incidentally -- uh .. from what I understand, the hospital in the ghetto\nperformed abortions because children were not allowed to be born.",
        "A: Yes, at that point there were mostly Germans and a few Latvian Jews and some\nCzechoslovakian Jews. In fact, we lived in buildings .. the building that I lived in\nwas a Berlin building and then there was a Hamburg building and so on and so\nforth and there was a group from Cologne and various parts of Germany. One of\nthe ladies who lived in the building became the secretary to one of the elders --\nthe Jewish elders -- Alteste Rat as it was called. And through her, I became .. I\ngot a job as a messenger for the Alteste Rat, of course there was no phone so\nwhen messages had to be brought from one place to another, somebody had to\ncarry them and she arranged for me to have that job. And uh .. I did that for\nprobably, I would say a year. Then that summer, it petered out and I went back to\nsorting clothes and uh .. subsequently, I had gotten a little bit stronger and quite a\nbit leaner -- I had been a fat kid and I lost most of that -- so one of the guards\nnoticed me and I was sent to a ... I went on a fairly extended trip, cutting lumber\nin what was then Russia in a place called the Germans call it Pleskau, P-L-E-S-\nK-A-U, the Russian name today is Pskov P-s-k-o-v. And we were probably there\nfor a.. oh, I would say a week or two weeks or something like that.",
        "A: Transported out of the ghetto to that place, cutting down trees, which I had never\ndone before -- but that was all right. We .. we lived in abandoned farmhouse I\nremember. We also -- I was also put on -- they call Commando -- to a place\ncalled Rzekne and while I was there, I was ... I came in contact with Boleslav\nMichovsky who has become fairly well known in this country because he was the\ncarpenter in Minneola that was accused of the war crimes -- as a war criminal and\nthen I guess he lost -- was stripped of his citizenship and was supposed to be\ndeported and he is now on trial in Germany for his crimes. Probably now he 1s in\nhis eighties so he will probably never ... never make it but in any event, that ..\nthat became a fairly celebrated case.\nEnd of Side A.\nStart again at 000 on Side B.",
        "A: O.K.",
        "A: I think we also did lumber, we also did wood.",
        "A: Yeah, you know I haven\u2019t really spoken much about guards about suffering per se\nbecause, there really, in all fairness to the Germans, we didn\u2019t have much contact\nwith the guards. There were very few S.S. men or guards in the ghetto -- I mean\nwe were just sort of like in a steam cooker -- we were left to cook by ourselves.\nThere were obviously people -- guards at the gates uh ... I don\u2019t remember any\nspecific acts of cruelty or harassment in the ghetto. There were at work, if we\ndidn\u2019t work fast enough, they would kick us or prod us with a shovel or rifle or\nsomething like that but it really wasn\u2019t the real gruesome things that you hear\nabout --those really all came later and in the various concentration camps. Uh...\nI am going to try to put this in a proper time frame now. I stayed in the ghetto\nprobably from the beginning of February 1942 until uh ... late in 1943 or maybe\neven the beginning of \u201944 and uh .. no, no, it wasn\u2019t that long -- excuse me, I\u2019m\nsorry. It was from the beginning of \u201942 until probably early \u201943. Then the\nGermans were beginning to liquidate the ghettos and were moving people into\nlabor camps and concentration camps. Uh.. I would say it was somewhere in \u00b043,\nearly \u201943, maybe middle of \u201943. It seems to me that it was either spring or\nsummer, that the spring and summer in Russia are very short and don\u2019t last long.\nUh ... we were brought from the ghetto to a concentration camp called\nKaiserwald, and from there, where we really stayed a relatively short time, and\nthen were brought to a factory in Riga that specialized in receiving, sorting,\ncleaning and rehabilitating uniforms for the German army from the front -- 1t was\ncalled ABA 701 -- ABA standing for Armee Bekleidung Amt ( Mr. Lachman\nspells these words out ) Amt being bureau. And there we had much more contact\nwith the guards and there was a great deal more harassment and a great deal more\nsupervision and of course that was beginning to be real concentration camp like\nwhere instead of, this was a big old factory building -- 1t was a factory that had\nmanufactured blue color, blue dye and everything in that place was still blue -- I\nremember that like it was yesterday -- it was called Riga Ultramarine, they had\nmade artificial, I guess, artificial blue color.",
        "A: Sorting. Just sorting and I was .. I was somehow ... I stayed with that sorting\nstuff, I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I became a specialist -- I don\u2019t know (laughs).\nBut there we were constantly supervised by the S.S. people and constantly\nharassed and constantly kicked and constantly you know ... annoyed. And uh...\nwe Slept in the typical concentration camp arrangement where there were like ...\nthey weren\u2019t beds ... they were like big platforms, one on top of the other, three\nhigh or four high. Everybody would lie in the ... on the platform and it was so\ncrowded that you know, you couldn\u2019t really turn. You had to lie on your side and\nof course, men were separated from women in that situation. There were\ncommunal baths and it was really like a concentration camp arrangement.\nIncidentally, let me go back to the ghetto for a minute. Uh .. from time to time,\npeople would try to escape from the ghetto and as they were caught they would be\nbrought back and hanged and everybody would have to march by in the morning\nand they would generally leave hanging there for, especially in the winter time\nwhen everything froze, sometimes four or six weeks just sort of as a memento so\nthat everybody could see it every day and I guess that was supposed to discourage\nus from running away. I must tell you that I really never had any thoughts about\nrunning away or anything like that because I couldn\u2019t envision myself ... I had a\ndifficult time enough getting along -- I had no contacts. I didn\u2019t speak Latvian -- I\nonly spoke German. I mean there was just no way. Also our hair was cropped\nclose and through the middle we had a shaven strip that was re-shaven probably\nevery two or three weeks so ... and the women were completely shaven. Their\nheads were completely shaven so you would stand out from the population. I\ndon\u2019t know how people ... I guess some people did get away -- you know, not\nmany but I guess some people did. I mean there are many recorded instances\nknown of people who actually ran away from .. especially from ghettos and\njoining partisans or undergrounds or what have you. I don\u2019t know that there was\nmuch of an underground in Latvia because the Latvians really, from everything\nwe could see, were really very much pro German and very much anti Russian and\nI think the Latvians were probably rooting for the Germans to win and uh .. I\nwould say that the Latvians were basically more -- more the Latvians than the\nLithuanians-- were probably more, more antagonistic towards us than many of the\nGermans were so I couldn\u2019t envision escaping into that element. Uh ... let me go\nback to where I was -- to the living conditions in that ABA 701.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Well, you couldn\u2019t ... well, I'll tell you -- I did that once and it wasn\u2019t such a\ngood thing. Uh ... it turned out to be a mistake. Uh... well, you know, we had\nuniforms. We had those blue and white striped uniforms. Incidentally, for one\nreason or another, amazingly enough, I still have my uniform cap. I still have\nthat. The original uniform cap.",
        "A: In the ghetto, you wore civilian clothes and I don\u2019t know how I made out. I really\ndon\u2019t .. you know, it was so long ago, some of that stuff just, just doesn\u2019t stick\nout. Um.. while I was in that ABA 701, I stole a pair of shoes because my shoes\nwere just completely gone and uh .. I muddied them up a little bit, you know the\noutsides so that they would look old. But of course, you couldn\u2019t disguise that\nand I was found out and uh .. I was called to the commander and first got a good\nbeating and then he said, \u201cWell, I guess we will have to execute you.\u201d So, I went\nback and I said well, I guess this is it. But somewhere later on, one of the guards\ncame back and said \u201c Well, he\u2019s changed his mind, all you have to do ..\u201d, he gave\nme an iron bar to carry and I had to carry it, you know there was a four floor\nbuilding, I had to carry that bar up and down the stairs for I don\u2019t know how many\ntimes .. fifty times, maybe a hundred times -- I don\u2019t know what it was, but that\nwas my punishment and of course I got a pair of wooden shoes which was the\nworst punishment because I had to wear those for the next couple of years and it\nwas really hard to walk on them. But..",
        "A: I took them from the ones, all the things that came in, the things that I was sorting.\nUh .. before long, there wasn\u2019t really a whole lot of sorting to do, so instead of\nsorting clothes they switched us to loading and unloading ships, that came into the\nRiga harbor and uh .. that was a lousy job because first of all, it was cold and it\nwas wet and we then worked twelve hour shifts -- you either worked the night\nshift or the day shift and there was really no place to hide -- you were outside --\nand the worst of it all was that the Russians used to come and bomb the harbor all\nthe time and we had really no protection -- all you could do was try to get off the\nship as quickly as you could and you know they had these flares that they would\ndrop and the sky would be lit up and they had machine gun ships and they ... in\nthose days, the Russians we were really beginning to make substantial progress\nand were moving against the Germans -- pretty well down into Russia.",
        "A: Cargo ships -- no troop ships. We were loading and unloading ammunition. We\nwere loading and unloading supplies -- if we were loading supplies, sometimes\nwe would try to steal some of the food if we could and again, anybody that got\ncaught really got into serious problems. Uh .. I remember taking a package once\nof something and under great personal peril and when I unpacked it, I found out it\nwas mustard -- that just goes to show you that you never know about all those\nthings -- so instead of food, I got mustard. Um ..I was very angry at that time\nbecause I had taken a tremendous chance to do it. It seems silly now but I didn\u2019t\nlaugh then.",
        "A: The food rations at that point had deteriorated and uh .. things were really getting\ntougher every day. But as long as we could work and I guess we were a pretty\ngood working group, they would keep us going. We were concerned because\nespecially the ones that were older than I could see that the tide of the war was\nturning against the Germans and uh .. they were -- they would say, well, gee, what\nare they going to do with us if they have to get out of here. ---I would like to take\na minute or two and talk about some of the older people who were in the camp\nbecause, you know, I had uh .. I was young. I was 14 or 15, 16, whatever age I\nwas at that time, I never had the opportunity to acquire any personal dignity if you\nknow what that means -- in other words, I never had a real position in life where I\nhad self respect, where people looked up to me, where people felt this is a great\nguy or what have you. So, probably on the whole, the whole ghetto and\nconcentration life was easier for me than for some of these people. I remember\none of the people that worked with us in that ABA 701, had been the chief\ngynecologist in one of the leading hospitals in Berlin. Now you know, I can just\nimagine what scrounging for food -- the loss of dignity, being kicked around,\nbeing cursed at -- I sort of took that in stride. I had grown up with it. I had been\ncursed at on the way to school so you kind of become accustomed to it -- you\ndon\u2019t like it -- but you figure out that\u2019s the way life is. But I wonder how life was\nfor those people and it must have been much more difficult than it was for me and\nuh .. well, I didn\u2019t have any particular empathy for him at that time. Now I can\nthink back, I feel that that must have been a degradation to him a great deal worse\nthan it was for me. Uh.. O.K. -- so much about that. So, let\u2019s get back to the end\nof the German occupation of Riga. By that time, as I said, the Russians were\nraiding us almost every night -- by raiding \u201cus\u201d -- raiding the Germans. And of\ncourse the Russians didn\u2019t know we were there. In fact, towards the end, the\nGermans were parking trains -- there was a train track right through that ABA 701\n-- that old factory that we were at, and the Germans were parking trains that were\nloaded with ammunition right along side us, so we didn\u2019t care -- it didn\u2019t make\nany difference but they obviously did that on purpose. Uh .. for one reason or\nanother, the Germans decided to keep us instead of shooting us which was really,\nreally was amazing because in retrospect, I know many people were not as\nfortunate. The Germans withdrew all their forces in Latvia to a uh .. toa\nbridgehead in Libau -- German name, the Latvian name that it goes by now is\nLiepaja. It is a port that is not on the Gulf of Riga but is on the Baltic Sea. It is\nalso in Latvia. It is really not far from Riga. And they brought us there and that\nwas a smaller group. They took some of the people that had worked on that ABA\n701 and brought them back to Kaiserwald or Stuthoff near Danzig which 1s also a\nlarge concentration camp. And they took probably 80 of us. And again, I don\u2019t\nknow why .. how I was selected to be part of it -- I wasn\u2019t a better worker than\nanybody else -- I wasn\u2019t a particularly strong or healthy individual -- I was\nprobably as emaciated as everybody else. I think a lot of it was God\u2019s providence\nand luck. So I was amongst these eighty people that were brought to that place\nLibau or Liepaja and we were housed in I guess it had been an old mansion -- it\nwas near the ocean, on a beautiful street -- but there was barbed wire around it.\nWe were loading and unloading ships -- mostly at that point, we were not\nunloading anything more -- we were loading. The Germans were trying to carry\nback everything that they could carry back. I remember, we were dismantling\neven the tin roofs -- putting the sheets of tin in wooden enclosures and they were\nbeing shipped back to Germany. They were just stripping the place and we were\nthere for ... that must have been late \u201944, that must have been, I would say, early\nFall to late Fall \u201944, and we were there for several months doing that particular\nthing. One of the unfortunate things that happened there was that one of the\nRussian bombs hit the building that we were in and probably fifteen or so of us\nwere killed. Uh .. which was really too bad. Uh .. again, you don\u2019t feel -- I did\nnot feel, particularly sorry for them, I felt particularly glad that 1t wasn\u2019t me.\nAnd, that is one thing that I won\u2019t forgive the Germans for -- is that\ndehumanization of people -- of this complete destruction of the human spirit and\nof the human compassion and you know, that was awful. It was hard to come\nback and maybe you didn\u2019t come back all the way. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure.\nMaybe, I will never be as compassionate of a person as you, I have no idea. But\nin any event, we were there for a while and again, those of us ... the older people\ntend to be more concerned with the future -- the people of my age really were\nworried with day to day. \u201cHow am I going to have food today? How can I work\nthe least today? How can I get the best night\u2019s sleep? How can I ...?\u201d That was\nabout it. \u201cHow can I keep my behind clear so that nobody kicks me around?\u201d\nThat kind of thing. And again, people were worried about what will they do with\nus when this is over with. And again, it was perhaps divine providence or perhaps\nluck or whatever, they decided to take us back to Germany. As they were\nevacuating the bridgehead in Libau, they put us on a.. a .. in the hold of a ship full\nof freight, by that time we were down to about fifty or sixty people, and brought\nus back to Germany.",
        "A: I would say three or four days. I remember that there was no food on that trip and\nthat was kind of gruesome but at least we were getting back. I think probably\nthey didn\u2019t want to leave us or didn\u2019t want to leave our bodies for the Russians to\nfind. I think really that was probably the rationale because I can\u2019t think of any\nother reason why they would take us back, because by that time, they didn\u2019t need\nus anymore. By that time, they had no more use for our labor because that was\nearly \u00b045 and you know .. the thing had completely disintegrated. It was either\nDecember \u00b044 or January \u00b045, I don\u2019t know which but it was probably December\n\"44, by that time, Germany was in such disarray that there was no work to be done\nanymore. As I said, the last time .. while we were in Libau towards the end, we\nwere dismantling buildings and shipping them back which was really one of those\nnonsense jobs kind of a thing. There was no reason for it. What were they going\nto do with sheets of metal? You know, there was no need for it any more. Uh...\nI remember the ship coming in ... of course we were 1n the hold, we couldn\u2019t see\nanything and uh ... when they let us off the ship in Hamburg, I remember terrible\ndevastation in the harbor in Hamburg. It really looked .. we were amazed, I mean\nwe hadn\u2019t been back to Germany ... this was Germany that was so destroyed. Uh\n... and, I really think they didn\u2019t know what to do with us when they got us back.\nIt was the kind of thing where somebody says, \u201cwhat did you bring us here, where\ndid you get these guys? What am I supposed to do with them?\u201d That kind of\nthing. You know. So uh... for want of a place, they brought us to a jail -- a city\njail, in Hamburg and they put all of us in two cells. Which was awful crowded\nand uh .. we had just nothing to do for probably .. they kept us there for I would\nsay three or four weeks. We got very inadequate food, they did take us out a few\ntimes and the only thing we did when they took us out -- we were collecting shell\nfragments from the anti-aircraft guns that had fallen -- you know they were really\njagged fragments. I don\u2019t know if you have ever seen an anti-aircraft shell -- they\nare jagged pieces of metal. You have to be careful when you pick them up\nbecause they are really sharp in some instances and we put them on, in Europe\nthey use these trailer trucks that are open trailers in the back but we no longer had\ntrucks because they didn\u2019t have any gasoline so we had to pull the trailers. But\nagain .. this was a nonsense job -- it was really not a job that meant anything\nbecause nothing was going anywhere -- nothing was functioning anymore. You\nknow .. Germany for all practical purposes, really had stopped functioning in\nthose days. Uh... I suppose, somewhere in the middle or towards the end of\nJanuary, uh .. maybe the director of the prison wanted to get rid of us and said \u201c\nlook, take these guys away, I don\u2019t want them here\u201d or somebody said, \u201c\u201cWhat do\nwe do with these people?\u201d So, they put us in two small trucks and took us to\nBergen-Belsen which is not far from Hamburg.",
        "A: I would say about a month. Maybe three weeks. You know, you lose track of\ntime and uh .. even if I did remember, I don\u2019t remember anymore now. Uh...\nwhen we went to -- they took us to Bergen-Belsen, 1n Bergen-Belsen, they gave\nus anew number. My old concentration camp number -- which incidentally I was\nnever tattooed, I don\u2019t know why, maybe they weren\u2019t doing it that day that I got\nmy number or something but the old number had been 12360 and I was then\ngiven the number 15713. Um... we got a new number, we got put in barracks and\nuh .. we got locked in and that was the end of that. We just didn\u2019t hear or see\nfrom anybody any more. It was just like a .. you were left to your own devices.\nWe got some food but we got very little water uh .. I remember there were these\npools in the camp which were supposed to be water pools that were used .. that\nwere supposed to be used if there was a fire uh .. they were supposed to pump\nwater out of those pools with a fire truck and we would drink that water. Later\non, we found dead bodies in those pools -- there was ... you know -- 1t was just a\nnightmare and people were sick. I contracted typhus -- I had terrible diarrhea, I\nmean just every day, you would drag yourself outside of the barrack and sit out\nthere all day long, leaning up against something and when it got dark, you drag\nyourself back in. There was no more roll call. You know, during the\nconcentration camp -- every morning there was roll call and all that kind of stuff.\nPeople would come to make sure that nobody escaped. I mean order, total order\nhad broken down, it was just a question of .. the only question that was in our\nminds, \u2018How can we survive this? How can we keep this up? How can we stay\nwell enough until this is over?\u201d And you know, every day, hundreds of people\nwere dying -- dozens of people. We would try to at least, we couldn\u2019t bury them -\n- we weren\u2019t strong enough for that -- we would drag them towards a place where\nthey would all be together. I mean there was no brutality by guards -- there were\nno guards -- there was nobody there. They just put you in a room and locked the\ndoors and they would once in a while give us some food -- some watery soup that\nwas sort of shoved through the gate and anybody that was strong enough to get to\nthe gate could get some but a lot of people couldn\u2019t even get up and um .. would\njust die where they lay. Um ... I was in Bergen-Belsen probably for three\nmonths. On the day that I now know was April 15, 1945, we saw tanks with stars\non them coming through the barbed wire and uh .. that was the British army and\nuh .. the German guards were either -- the ones that hadn\u2019t melted away, I imagine\na lot of them had run away -- were taken prisoner and the British came in and I\nguess they were pretty horrified by what they saw because they just couldn\u2019t cope\nwith it. You know, this was an advancing army, they don\u2019t -- how could they\nhave medical facilities for uh .. I believe the records indicate that there were\n13,000 unburied dead were found in the camp -- 23,000 unburied dead were\nfound in the camp -- 13,000 were to die from the time that the British took over\nuntil they were finally able to bring sanitation and what have you into the camp.\nUh .. the British couldn\u2019t really do anything for us for the first couple of weeks --\nthey did bring us food but it was rich food that we really couldn\u2019t eat -- but at\nleast we got water. There was no medical attention because how could you have\nenough doctors to take care of all these people. And again, it was probably fate or\ndivine providence that I got better. And a number of us got better. We were then\n... the British decided to burn .. oh, the British used the German guard to bury all\nthe unburied dead. We saw that and it was sort of satisfaction to us, I guess. Uh ..\nthey burned down the camp because they thought that all the barracks had been so\npolluted and so full of excrement and blood and whatever -- there was just no way\nto preserve it and they moved us into a nearby um .. what had been German army\ncamp, in fact, when I went back to Bergen-Belsen -- it is again a German army\ncamp. You know .. they were two story buildings, it was a parade ground and\ntypical kind of thing. And we were in there and that\u2019s when I would say -- I\nprobably had a recuperation period of three to four months -- we got medical care.\nWe got adequate ... we certainly got food. We were treated like human beings.\nAnd it\u2019s amazing how fast you snap back and start thinking in terms of enjoying\nyour life. I had missed really all my childhood -- really missed all my teenage\nyears. Those were the days when I first -- when I all of a sudden became\ninterested in girls. You know after I got better and I guess the girls became\ninterested in boys and we would talk and you know .. there would be the normal\numm ... social ... intercourse between people where you would spend time\ntogether and enjoy each other\u2019s company. Uh... one of the people who worked for\nthe British Red Cross, a lady -- I spoke some English because I had taken English\nin school, and probably spoke more than a passable English -- not really great but\nmore than passable. She came into the barracks one day and said is there anyone\nhere who speaks English and I said yeah, I speak English. So she needed, she was\nrunning a supply uh .. warehouse .. the British call it a Supply Dump but it\u2019s\nreally not a dump, it\u2019s a warehouse for the refugees. It was organized by the\nBritish Red Cross and order of St. John and I became an interpreter for her and\nlater became attached to the British army as an interpreter and that\u2019s why I am\nwearing the uniform in these pictures. And amazingly enough, I kept in touch\nwith this lady -- Mrs. Payton for all these years. She just passed away probably a\nyear ago or two years ago. We would exchange Christmas gifts and letters and\nphone calls and she came to visit us once and what have you. And uh .. I worked\nfor this British Supply D ump as an interpreter and those were wonderful\ndays -- it was like .. well .. like being let out of a cage. You know, it was\namazing. We could get the normal haircuts and we could wear normal clothes,\nwe could talk to other people. We felt that we were equal to -- well, you know,\nafter things like that, you really don\u2019t feel that you are equal to anybody and you\nfeel always in intimidation of people in uniform or the sense of awe of that and\nprobably to some extent, I have never lost that entirely. Uh .. the respect for\nauthority 1f you know what I mean. If somebody tells you that you are not\nsupposed to do it, you just don\u2019t do it or else.",
        "A: I worked for the British probably until late 42. Late .. excuse me. I\u2019ve got my\ndates all wrong. Late \u201945, I\u2019m sorry, late \u201945, maybe early \u201946. Uh... then, I\nstarted really thinking seriously about what are you going to do with yourself.\nWhere do you go from here? Uh .. most of the people that were with me at the\ntime, the young people -- almost everybody who survived was young. There were\nno old people. I would say everybody was between 15 and 30. There was\nnobody older that made it. Most of the young people wanted to go to Israel which\nwas then Palestine. Uh .. I felt that Israel was an agriculture society which was\nwhat it was and that was not what I wanted to do. Uh... I wanted to go\nsomewhere else -- I wasn\u2019t sure. For some crazy reason, I ... my father\u2019s sister\nand her husband had gone to the United States before the war and for some crazy\nreason I remember their address. I don\u2019t know how I ever possibly did that but I\ndid do it, O.K. And I wrote them a letter and made contact with them. So, I had\nan opportunity to go to the United States -- some other people who did not want to\ngo to Israel wanted to go to Australia and you know, and we pretty much, except\nfor Israel, could decide where we wanted to go. We could stay in Germany, some\nof the people who had been from Eastern Europe had wanted to go back. Not\nmany of them, but some did. So...",
        "A: No. No. I wanted to have no part of Germany, wanted to have no part of Europe.\nI wanted to go somewhere else.",
        "A: My uncle was in Israel.",
        "A: That was later. I knew I had an uncle in Israel but I just did not want to go ... I\njust didn\u2019t want to go to Israel. I don\u2019t know why .. yes, I do know why. I didn\u2019t\nwant to work on a farm. I didn\u2019t want to do that. I wanted to work in some kind\nof a trade or business enterprise or that kind of thing. Uh ... so .. uh, I decided\nthat if I wanted to go .. I finally decided that I wanted to go to America, to the\nUnited States, and in order to do that, I had to really get into what was then the\nAmerican Zone of occupation. It was very difficult to get from the British zone of\noccupation to the United States. So, this Mrs. Payton wrote a recommendation for\nme to the United Nations Headquarters in Munich and also a friend of mine who\nwas a Canadian captain who I also met after the war in Germany did the same\nthing. And uh .. I had to get permission to take a train -- you know, everything\nwas still in disarray. So I went to Munich and started working for the United\nNations --, the United Nations Legal and Rehabilitation Administration doing the\nsame thing again in a warehouse for relief supplies and I applied for going to the\nUnited States and came here in September 1946. I had the relatives -- my father\u2019s\nsister lived in Springfield, Massachusetts. I had some other relatives who lived in\nSpringfield Illinois and we were given, before we left Germany, we were given\nten dollars as money for -- we came on one of the tube ships the \u201cS.S. Marlin\u201d -- I\nremember that. I remember having our first oranges aboard ship and orange juice.\nI never had orange juice before in my life and you know, just to see oranges in\nbins -- you know ... I hadn\u2019t seen those in ten years. I hadn\u2019t seen eggs in ten\nyears -- well, not ten years but five anyway. So, you know, this was an amazing\nsight. It is hard for anyone to imagine that kind of stuff. And uh .. since I had\nseven dollars left out of the ten dollars, when I came here, and that was not\nenough to go to Springfield, Illinois, so I chose to go to Springfield,\nMassachusetts. Which was that train fare here and that\u2019s basically.",
        "A: I came to New York City first. I did not like New York City, inside or outside. I\nhad some relatives in New York. I guess it was the sister of my grandmother or\nsomething like that and I stayed with her for a couple of weeks. First of all, it was\nvery difficult to find a job in New York because that was the time when all the\nGI\u2019s were being demobilized and of course, they had first right -- as well they\nshould -- for all the jobs. And uh .. I went to Springfield and I guess I hung\naround for about two or three weeks doing nothing and just enjoying this\nwonderful country and all the opportunities and I decided that I wanted to work in\neither a wholesale or a retail business. Springfield had kind of a small main street\nand I went from one end to the other trying to find a job in one of the stores and I\ndid not find one. Later that night, somebody called my aunt who I stayed with in\nSpringfield and said, \u201cwell, there\u2019s a person who has a store in an outlying section\nof Springfield who is looking for a stock boy\u201d. I found a job there as a stock boy\n-- then you know, my problem was schooling. I never had more than eight years\nof schooling, so uh, what I need to do was first to get my school equivalency\ncertificate. Which, I don\u2019t know if you have that here but in Massachusetts, you\ngo to the department of education. They devise a plan for you -- evening courses\nthat you have to take, correspondence courses that the State Department of\nEducation gives and I, they devised a plan for me whereby I would get the high\nschool equivalency certificate which I did. Meanwhile I continued working\nduring the day, in that store. I then ended up at Northeastern University at night,\nthere was a Springfield division of Northeastern University -- it was a high school\nequivalency certificate and I went to Northeastern for six years -- always\ncontinuing to work at my job -- gradually advancing from stock boy to sales\nperson. Then I started going for my Masters to American International College --\nanother local college in Springfield. I never got my Masters -- I hope to take\nsome courses now and maybe get it. I ultimately advanced to buyer and then\ngeneral manager and then subsequently the business was sold to a large\ncorporation and I became president then became president for some other\ndepartment stores -- so, I at the height of my career, I ran eleven small New\nEngland Department stores for the Van Heusen shirt corporation and in 1982, I\nhad an opportunity to buy the original store that I had started working at as a stock\nboy, which I did and I just sold it in March of 1992 and I am retired. That\u2019s\nbasically it. I talked for a long time. If you still have ...",
        "A: Not about Belsen per se. I had wanted to go back to Belsen to see what it was like\nand I was really ... I didn\u2019t do it with an easy heart. I wasn\u2019t sure really what I\nwould find, but I thought it would be a very lonesome place with maybe just a\nfew old guys like myself standing there and saying Kaddish -- that\u2019s a Jewish\nprayer for the dead. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re Jewish -- if you know. So, uh...\ninstead we got there on a Sunday morning -- it had been turned into a memorial\npark and I was really amazed to see probably two hundred young Germans --\nsome with children going there and just looking around. Visiting this memorial\npark, you have all the mass graves that are still there which say \u201cHere lie five\nthousand\u2019, \u201cHere lie five hundred\u201d. \u201cHere lie a thousand\u201d. And so on and so\nforth. But these people had taken their Sundays to go and look at this and it made\nme feel that was kind of a nice thing. That at least these people wanted to know\nabout this period of history.\n"
