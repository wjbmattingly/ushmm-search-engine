        "A: My father\u2019s name was Josef (ph) and my mother\u2019s name was Chaya (ph). I was born, I was the\nfifth child; we were eight children. I was one of the youngest. We were four girls, four sisters\nand three brothers and one was a twin. I was the, one, two, three, four... I was the fifth child,\nlike I said before. And I had a very healthy, happy upbringing. My mother was in business. My\nfather, at that point already, couldn\u2019t work because he was sick, so he used to help in the house\nwith the children and he helped Mom in the business. And we were loved, getting along sisters\nand brothers, very good. And it was great. I went to school. My mother always believed in a\nprivate school. She never believed in a public school. So, we were taught Hebrew and Yiddish\nand Polish.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s business?",
        "A: Food business. We had a food store.",

        "Q: Okay. So, the two youngest were the twins?",
        "A: The two youngest were the twins, yes. And it was a very happy home. I had a grandmother that\nlived with an aunt in the same building. And we were always playing together, my aunt\u2019s\nchildren and us. And never had a problem. It was a very happy house. My mother used to tell\njokes and did birthdays and everything for the kids. She was a very hard working woman.\nPeople used to say that I looked like her and I care like her. It was never a dull moment, all this\nhappiness.",
        "Q: Was your family religious?",
        "A: I would say not orthodox, but conservative, conservative.",
        "Q: They go to services every Saturday?",
        "A: Not every Saturday, no. Holidays mostly. If something special came up, but I wouldn\u2019t say\nevery Saturday, no.",
        "Q: And can you say something about your father and his, what he was like?",
        "A: My father was, I could only say my father never hit us. He didn\u2019t know what means. He had\npatience. He was very good to us. He was like playing the part of the mother, because my father\nwas in the... he had... he used to make skins. But this didn\u2019t... he couldn\u2019t carry this on,\n2\nbecause he had problems breathing, had a weak heart. So he couldn\u2019t continue to doing that part.\nSo, that\u2019s when he had to quit his work and he stayed home with the children and helped out\nMom at the store. He was a very lovable man, good, caring, very caring for the family. He was\nnot born in Biatystok. He was born in Sokolka, which 1s not too far. My mother was born in\nBialystok. And we were surrounded, always, by love and by friends and by family. We didn\u2019t\nknow from any hardships because we always had what to eat, being my mother was in business.\nAnd we got along with everybody. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: What language did you speak in the home?",
        "A: We spoke mostly Yiddish with the parents and then Polish, of course, in the streets and the\nschool. And Hebrew.",
        "Q: Was it an all Jewish school that you attended?",
        "A: Yes. Yes it was.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in Poland before the war began, in Bialystok?",
        "A: I had very little... the only time I experienced is when, the ghetto, when we were in the ghetto.\nOtherwise, I really didn\u2019t, because we were, like I said, I went to Hebrew school and my friends\nwere mostly Jewish. But the neighbors on the block, just enough to say a hello and good-bye\nand they had their life, and we had our life. I never had any problem. My father used to have\nproblems, because he used to love soccer and every Saturday they had a soccer game. And after\nwe finished our lunch, we used to go. But he always took along a cane, in case they hit him or\nthey throw stones or whatever. If the game... if that team lost, you couldn\u2019t get home, because\nthey used to be very mad. And that\u2019s what they used to do. They used to throw stones, hit you,\nso he always took a cane along with him. But he wouldn\u2019t miss a game. He loved it. He loved\nthat sport. And that\u2019s it. Mom took care on the kids, he was at home and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all\nabout.",
        "Q: What did you, did you and your family... were you aware of Hitler from the time that he rose to\npower in Germany? And did you feel threatened by what was happening in Germany?",
        "A: Actually when you heard the stories, when you heard what\u2019s going on... we, of course you\nstarted to get scared, but we didn\u2019t know so much what, what\u2019s going on. And my father, may\nhe rest in peace, always said, he was a medic in the First World War and he always says that the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t do that. They may put you to work, but they will never harm you in any way.\nAnd like anything else, you listen to your parents, whatever they told you. I mean, you didn\u2019t\nhave much of a chance to run any place. We were on the... in our town, first came in the\nRussians. And we were with the Russians maybe a year. And we were on the... they evicted a\nlot of people that were in business for themselves. So, they put us on a truck to go, I don\u2019t know\nwhere, to Siberia or whatever.",
        "Q: The Russians did?\n3",
        "A: Yes, the Russians did that, because my mother had a house and we had a store, so we were\nalready like, rich, you know what I\u2019m saying? So that\u2019s what happened. And my mother gave\nthem some money and they took us off the truck and we remained home. Had we known what\nwas going on, that we wouldn\u2019t stay home, of course we would have gone to Russia better. But\nthat\u2019s what it was. And then a year later, this was 1939, when the Germans came in. The\nRussians left and the Germans came in. And we were with them for a while from the beginning,\nthen they started to make all kinds of things. When the men went to the Temple, like on a\nSaturday, they burned down the whole Temple with the people inside, whoever it was there.\nThen one Saturday they took away all the men. They left the women, but all the men. And\nthat\u2019s when the trouble started. A while later, they put us into the ghetto and this was terrible.\nThe ghetto was terrible.",
        "Q: Okay, before we get to that, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the time before the war\nstarted. When the war started it was 1939, you were about sixteen years old? Is that right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me something about what your interests were? I mean you were a young woman,\nyou\u2019re just coming into your... you\u2019re getting close to adulthood. Can you take me back into\nthat time and just recall what your life was like?",
        "A: Well, like I said before, I have... I admired my sisters. I always looked up to them. My oldest\nsister was a designer. She was very good at it. She used to design for me clothes. She used to\nmake me dresses. My second sister, she was 1n the house. My third one, she loved school, but\nshe was sick. And I always used to complain to Mom, that she\u2019s... takes advantage of me. She\nhits me. Whatever she has, I cannot have it. Like we used to come from school on a Friday.\nShe wanted something special. She wanted some kind of pastry and she always got it. And\nmilk, she did not want it to eat, but it was in the house. I was forced to eat everything, whatever\nthey cooked for me. And I rebelled. And I came to my Mom\u2019s store. This was after months.\nAnd I came to my Mom\u2019s store and I started to cry. And I said to her, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You\ndon\u2019t love me.\u201d I mean, what could a child think? I don\u2019t know how old was I, maybe seven or\neight. And I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t love me.\u201d I says, \u201cHow could you say that to me?\u201d My mother\nsaid... I said, \u201c\u201cYou see, you yourself said when Fulma touches me...\u201d in other words, she gives\nme a...",
        "Q: A pinch?",
        "A: A pinch, exactly, I was looking for that. And that place hair wouldn\u2019t grow, that\u2019s what she used\nto say, because she was strong in her hand. And when I would go to school with her, she has,\nshe walks and I run, and I couldn\u2019t catch up with her. \u201cSo, how could you tell me that she is sick\nand I am well?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d my mother said, \u201cOh, I see you have already brains.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d She\nsays to me, \u201cHow many fingers do you have?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Everybody\nhas ten fingers.\u201d So, she said, \u201cIf you hurt one, if you cut one, does it hurt you?\u201d I said, \u201cOf\ncourse, what kind of talk is that?\u201d That\u2019s when she sat me down on her lap and she explained it\ntome. \u201cI love you all the same, but she happen to be sick, that\u2019s why she gets everything. I\ndon\u2019t want to upset her.\u201d So, again, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. How could you do that to me?\u201d\n4\nSo, she said, \u201cWatch.\u201d She had, what do you... now it\u2019s going to come back to me. I\u2019m getting\nall excited. Epilepsy.",
        "Q: Oh, mm hmm.",
        "A: And most of these things happened during the night and I never saw it. So when she told me\nthat, I trusted her, my mom. But I... still I had to see it for myself, that kind of child was I. And\nsure enough when the light came up and I used to see everybody running to her bed and foam\ncame out of her mouth. And from then on, you couldn\u2019t do nothing to her, she was the best\nsister. She couldn\u2019t be wrong in any place. I looked into her eyes. This all I have to thank my\nmom, that she explained it to me properly, because otherwise I would grow up hating her, how\nshe dared do that to me. That kind of mom we had, very smart and outgoing in every way.",
        "Q: What was the sister\u2019s name again?",
        "A: Shayna. She was the third one and I was under her. And...",
        "Q: What were your interests? Did you have any dreams?",
        "A: My interest? To go school. And that\u2019s what it was. I didn\u2019t have any other ambitions, but to go\nto school at that point, because I had older sisters to care for. You know what I\u2019m saying? We\ndidn\u2019t jump to any conclusions ahead. That\u2019s the way we were raised. My oldest sister got\nmarried. And she had two children. The other sister got married in the ghetto. And my\nbrothers, my brother got married in the ghetto. And they all had children in the ghetto. And\nthat\u2019s what it... 1t was kind of hard on us. And my sick sister, she too got married in the ghetto\nand she had a baby.",
        "Q: Had you started dating by the time the war started?",
        "A: Not dating, actually not dating, just having friends. We used to belong to organization, and...\nZionist organization.",
        "Q: What was the name of it?",
        "A: Jabotinsky'? Would you know? Mmhmm. Yes, yes, yes. And that\u2019s... we used to be together,\nlike, and go on, you know, like hikes and things like that, but of course, everything was\nsupervised. And that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Okay, now tell me a little bit more about the Russian occupation. The way I understand it, it\nstarted in 1939. The Germans occupied for a week and then the Russians came in.",
        "A: Uh huh. They were more than a week. They were there for maybe a year.\n' Refers to Vladimir Jabotinsky (1880-1940), a Zionist leader who established the Revisionist movement, and was\nthe head of Betar, the Revisionist youth movement.\n5",
        "Q: After the... so the Germans came in, and then they occupied just for a little while and then the\nRussians occupied for...",
        "A: No, just the opposite. First were the Russians, first were the Russians and then came the\nGermans.",
        "Q: The Germans returned and occupied again and established the ghetto later on.",
        "A: Right. Uh huh, right.",
        "Q: During that time that the Russians were occupying, you mentioned that your... did your family\nactually lose their store?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we lost everything, yes. Yes, at that time. Short time after we went into ghetto.",
        "Q: And what, how did you feed, how did your family support itself during that time, before the\nghetto, that it lost the store?",
        "A: Before the ghetto, I, it wasn\u2019t a long time, let\u2019s put it this way. We didn\u2019t feel the pinch in\nanything, because like I said before, my mother took care on everything. In the ghetto we felt\nthe pinch, yes, definitely, but not before.",
        "Q: Do you remember when the Germans came in and occupied Bialystok?",
        "A: Oh sure, oh sure.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about that day?",
        "A: The day, we heard planes coming back and forth and they threw bombs. We were right, not far\nfrom there. And we still thought that they were practicing. The Russians are practicing because\nwe didn\u2019t believe that this was the Germans already. A short time after, you saw already riding\non the motorcycles, you know, and coming into town and that\u2019s what it was. And that\u2019s when\nthe trouble started.",
        "Q: Were they brutalizing the Jews of Biatystok?",
        "A: What? The Germans?",
        "Q: The Germans.",
        "A: Of course, of course.",
        "Q: Did you witness any brutality?",
        "A: I mean, thank God, we were lucky at that point, that nobody was missing from the family, but a\nlot of people didn\u2019t have their husbands already. They took them away, or their sons. They used\n6\nto pick them up from the street and, and take them out. But at that point, we were yet, the whole\nfamily was together yet, until the, the selection that they made. That they put us into the ghetto\nand I had to go out to get some food, because nobody else could. My brother wouldn\u2019t go out,\nhe was afraid. And so my father couldn\u2019t carry anything, so I used to take off the yellow star that\nwe wore. And I was blond. And I took it off and I went out through the... they had like a hole\nthey made. And I went underneath and I went to the Poles, the ones that used to do business\nwith my mother. And I used to buy from them potatoes. And I used to bring it in underneath\nthe... on the way back, the same way like I came out. And I did it quite often for the family,\nthey should have what to eat.",
        "Q: How did you get money to buy the food? Was that saved from before?",
        "A: Oh, money left, we had money from before. Yeah, money we already had.",
        "Q: So, it wasn\u2019t taken away when you went into the ghetto?",
        "A: No, no, no. No, the money, at that point, they didn\u2019t take nothing. When we came into\nAuschwitz, that\u2019s when they took everything away. You hid it, you know, in certain places.\nYou know, you prepared yourself. But at that point we still had money.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little more about going into the ghetto. What were your living quarters like?\nOr do you remember, how you were... do you even remember being informed that you had to\nmove and what your family\u2019s response was to that?",
        "A: Yes. Like I said before, I was not of the ones that listened into everything. I had older ones than\nme, listening in, you know, but you followed whatever they, they told you. It was one bedroom\nthat we had in that... in the ghetto. And that\u2019s what everybody was together. But my sister, my\noldest sister and my... my oldest sister and my second sister, they were married already and they\nhad babies, so they couldn\u2019t go with us when we were hiding, because they were afraid that they\ngoing to give out. Because if the kids start crying, the SS will hear.",
        "Q: You were hiding in the ghetto or before?",
        "A: This is the last time, before they, they made those selections, so we were in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: From there they took us, they took you out.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s from there where they took you. First they put you all into a ghetto, in order to be\neasier for the Germans, that we should be all together. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. They\ntook... So we were separated. My mom went with the... with the younger ones, the ones that\nhad the babies. And my father went with the older, like me and my brother, that had no children.\n7",
        "Q: Okay, before we go on... I definitely want to hear about that, but I wanted to focus on the time in\nthe ghetto and going into the ghetto. So just on that early time, right as you were going in, did\nyour whole entire family, beside... go into that same bedroom?",
        "A: You had no alternative. Now my oldest sister, she was married; she had two children. So she\nwent with her husband, but not too far. And my other sister was not with us already. And\nneither did my brother, because he was married. So, it was just the younger ones, that we were\nall together.",
        "Q: Five children, five children and your parents.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: In that bedroom.",
        "A: In one bed, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: And when you were in the ghetto, did you work in any way?",
        "A: No, I never worked, no. No, I never worked. I was going... I didn\u2019t go to school already then,\nbecause you weren\u2019t allowed to go already. But I was home with my parents, because I had to\nwatch them.",
        "Q: Do you remember the, the...",
        "A: It was a lot of things on my head. Let\u2019s put it this way, because I knew my father was sick and\nthey had to get certain things and I had to... I had to be the one to go out and get it. So, every\ntime you, one of you went out, you wasn\u2019t sure if you were going to come back, but I would\nnever say no. Never.",
        "Q: So, you were the main, of the children that were left with your parents...",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: ...you were the main caregiver?",
        "A: Right. Caregiver. Not God forbid that it was sick, bedridden. But as far as providing food, and\nI remember my sister was having a baby in ghetto. And at that point already, they wouldn\u2019t take\nno money, the doctors. So, I had to go get the doctor. My mother sent me, so I went, of course.\nAnd he came. And I had to be the one to, to stay with them in the room. They chased off my\nmom, everybody from the room and she was having the baby.\n8",
        "Q: Which sister?",
        "A: Shayna. That\u2019s the second one. Daniel\u2019, could you bring me a little water, please? And the\ntissues, please, if you don\u2019t mind.",
        "Q: Do you want to take a break?",
        "A: For just a few minutes.",
        "Q: Sure.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n? J.L.\u2019s grandson, who was in the room for part of the interview.\n9\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Justine Lerner. Okay. You were telling me a little\nbit more about the ghetto. Did any of your brothers or sisters do any work in the ghetto, in any\nof the ghetto industries?",
        "A: None of them. None of them, no. No. No. My brother, like I said, didn\u2019t go out, out of the\nghetto, you know. And of course neither did my father or my mom. The only one that I went\nout, and I used to bring in the provisions, whatever, whatever it was able to, mainly potatoes and\nflour. Sugar, my mother, she knew that something\u2019s coming up. So, the main doctors didn\u2019t\ntake, if you needed a doctor, money was no good, because they couldn\u2019t buy nothing for the\nmoney. The main thing was sugar and flour. And that\u2019s what she saved up a lot of it. So, she\npaid the doctor, when my sister was giving birth, that\u2019s what it took, 1s sugar and flour. And\nnone of them worked, no, no.",
        "Q: Was it frightening to be sneaking in and out of the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes, it was, let\u2019s put it this way. I had no fear. I knew I had to do it, because I could not give it\nover to somebody else. It was my job and I did it very, very nice. I went out, like I said before, I\nwasn\u2019t sure if Ill ever get back, but that\u2019s it. You have to do what you have to do. And I was\nalways successful. I went in the same way and I came out the same way. And that\u2019s it. The\nfamily was happy and I was happy that I was able to do it.",
        "Q: Did you have any close calls?",
        "A: Not in the ghetto. I was fine. In the camps, yes, but not in the ghetto. In the ghetto I was fine. I\nwent in okay and I came out okay. And it\u2019s not like... my mother made meals and we ate and...\nthe best she knew how, I mean whatever she had left, you know? But we never felt hungry or\nanything like that.",
        "Q: Were you aware of any organized, underground resistance in the ghetto?",
        "A: No, no really don\u2019t... we were, we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t... how do I say? We didn\u2019t mingle with\npeople, you know what I\u2019m saying? Because we were a close family, and we were mostly by\nourselves. But I knew that people were working for the Germans, but we didn\u2019t know how could\nthey do it! You understand what I\u2019m trying...? How could they do a thing like that? When I\ncame to the, when I came to the concentration camp, to Auschwitz, then I saw what was going\non. Up till then, I did not know. Like I said before, my father always used to say the Germans\nare educated. They wouldn\u2019t do things like that. The only thing they could do is to put you to\nwork. But not to hit or... or do certain things uncalled for. Those are vicious killers, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Do you remember when, approximately, you entered the ghetto? What month and year?",
        "A: No, I really don\u2019t remember that. I really don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. And do you have a sense of approximately how long you were in the ghetto?\n10",
        "A: Not too long, I would say. People remained after they took us away, of course. Maybe three\nmonths, or four months the most. That\u2019s all. And of course you couldn\u2019t take nothing with you,\nbecause you had to carry it. Just like a pillow case, that\u2019s where you put some, your belongings\ninto it. You went. Because they didn\u2019t give you enough time. So, you wrapped whatever you\ncould. And like I said before, I was not with my mother. I was with my father then and my two\nsisters, my older sister and my younger one. My, my younger brother and my older brother and\nthat\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: Did you witness any actions in the ghetto or any round-ups during the time that you were there?",
        "A: No, we just read a bit or, or were told. But I never witnessed anything like that, no, thank God.\nLike I said before, we were lucky at that point, yet. We were all together.",
        "Q: When did you go into hiding and why? How did that come about?",
        "A: Because they said, I mean they didn\u2019t say, but you heard rumors that\u2019s going be a selection, that\nthey\u2019re going to take people away from... from the ghetto. And they\u2019re going to ship them to\nAuschwitz. So everybody went in either to a basement or they built something underneath and\nthat\u2019s the way they\u2019re hiding. You took some water with you or some bread and that\u2019s what\nhappened. And you were sitting up and waiting that somebody should knock on the door or\nwhatever. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. We heard them walking upstairs, Germans with\nthe boots, and we were underneath. And from nowheres they found out. And they knocked on\nthe door and that\u2019s what happened. They took us out from there.",
        "Q: You were in the same building as where you had lived?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You were hiding in the same building?",
        "A: No, no, this was a different building across the street. Yeah, my mother and my sisters were in\nthe same building underneath.",
        "Q: And you, will you repeat who exactly you were with? You were with your father...",
        "A: My father, my oldest sister, because her children were older, my father and my sister and her two\nolder children and my brother and me.",
        "Q: Okay, so, four of you, okay, and plus the children.",
        "A: Plus the children, yes. My... what did I want to say, I forgot. Yeah. And we got out and they\nput us on the trains. And... crowded. A lot of people. And we were riding, like I said before,\nmy father kept telling us, you see all the way, close to Auschwitz already.",
        "Q: And this was taking place in the winter time?\n11",
        "A: In January, February, yes, when the snow was falling on us. And we were sitting. A lot of...\nthere was no room to go to the bathroom, you should excuse me, a lot of people made on\nthemselves. It was just like, cattle have a better, better look than we had. It was just unbearable.\nAnd my brother, the oldest brother jumped the train. He didn\u2019t want to come into Auschwitz and\nthey were standing there and shooting. So, I never heard from him, so I don\u2019t know if he got\nshot or he got killed afterwards. My father to the last minute still had good ideas, that they\u2019re not\ngoing to hurt us, they\u2019re going to put us to work. But it was not so. The minute we arrived to\nAuschwitz, we still saw people standing and digging ditches. And he said, \u201cWhat did I tell you\nchildren? They\u2019re more civilized than anything else. They\u2019re not going to do these things.\nThey\u2019re not going to kill.\u201d And as soon as the train stopped it became like a terrible wind. And\nthey separated us, the women this way and the men that way. Didn\u2019t see my father anymore.\nDidn\u2019t see my sister, she was next to me, but she wouldn\u2019t part with her children, so you pulled\nher out on this side. So, I ran out from my side and I went to see... to be with my sister. And the\nSS, they had canes. They took the cane and put around my neck and pulled me out. They pulled\nme back to that line. So, I ran again over to my sister. I think I was scared, I didn\u2019t know which\nway. I wanted to be with her. So he took me out for the second time and he opened up my head.\nHit me with the cane over the head and that was the end of it. I never saw them afterwards. So,\nwhen you come into Auschwitz, you had to get undressed and of course, I started to cry very\nmuch. I wanted to go to my sister. I didn\u2019t tell them what, what I was crying. And an SS\nwoman comes over to me and she says to me, \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d Disoriented.\nEverything... it was unbelievable what they could put people in. And she says to me, \u201cWhy are\nyou crying?\u201d So I said to her, \u201cI want to go back to my sister.\u201d And she said, \u201cYou are going to\nsee her tomorrow.\u201d She was a good one. And then another SS woman came over, said, \u201cWhy\nare you crying?\u201d I cried harder. I said, \u201cBecause I want to go to your sister... to my sister.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cYou'll never see her again.\u201d And since that point, I never cried again. Because first they,\nthey cut your hair, and then they tattooed, and my hand got swollen like this. And lonesome, you\nhave nobody. I was really transport from the same town, but they were no, not related to me.\nAnd I had nobody. And the following day when they took us to work, we saw the smoke coming\nout of the chimney and I put two and two together and I knew exactly what was going on, that\nthey not around anymore. That\u2019s exactly how it was.",
        "Q: Did you have any friends from Biatystok outside of your family?",
        "A: Oh surely, and I met a lot of them. Not from the first day when we got there, but they had\nanother transport and that\u2019s when I met a lot of people from Biatystok, yes. I knew them. I went\nto school with them. My mother knew their mothers. They were in business. And that\u2019s it, we\nstayed together. We tried to hold onto one another.",
        "Q: So you, did you talk together about what was going on there and try to figure out...?",
        "A: We all knew the same things. You couldn\u2019t figure out anything. You couldn\u2019t escape as far as\nthis is concerned. You had to listen, and you had to be strong, and you had to help one another\nthe best you were able to. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. I was always helping and one day,\none morning... 1t was called the block, the place where you were staying. And every day\nsomebody else had to go to get coffee in the morning. And... two people, because it looked like\n12\na garbage barrel. With two and you had to carry. And that morning was my,\nmy turn to go to get the coffee in the morning. Had to go to the kitchen. And sure enough I\nwent and the other girl went and from nowhere a girl came along and she had a, a plate like a...\nyou know, like a... I don\u2019t know what, how to... like she used to get the soup there. You know?\nThey used to carry with you all the time. And she stopped the, the pot to get some coffee. And\nan SS woman saw her through the window. She came running out with the dog, and she poured\nthe hot coffee, boiling coffee on my leg. And the skin came off right away. And... and that\u2019s it,\nand there was nobody to talk to. Nobody to, nobody to complain. Because nobody would listen\nto you. They would gas you. So, after being three weeks like that, and without medication. I\nused to put on, they had like a little blanket to cover yourself, whatever it was. And I used to, I\nripped up a piece and I made like a, like a bandage. And it used to get stuck during the night and\nin the morning I used to take it off and I went to work like that. And couldn\u2019t go on no more.\nAnd I said, after three weeks, \u201cI can\u2019t go on no more to work. I cannot carry on.\u201d I said,\n\u2018\u201cWhatever\u2019s going happen, it\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019ll remain on the block.\u201d And you were not\nallowed to go to... to remain on the, on the block, because they would kill you. They would gas\nyou the same day. So, I went to work and we were digging ditches and they moved away from\nthere and I threw myself into the ditches and I figured Ill let me lay there. It\u2019s like a grave. Let\nme remain there. But somehow they walked away and I crept out and I went on Revier. The\nRevier meant, like a hospital. And they wouldn\u2019t accept no Jews, of course. So, I went in there\nand they accepted me. They asked me who did it. I said, \u201cI burned myself.\u201d I was not allowed\nto say that the SS woman did it to me. I says, \u201cI burned myself,\u201d and that\u2019s it. And they accepted\nme. You didn\u2019t get no help or medication or anything like that, but at least you had the rest.\nYou didn\u2019t have to get up six o\u2019clock in the morning and stand outside for Zahl Appell. They\nused to count everyone in the morning. And this took an hour if it rained or snowed, whatever,\nthey didn\u2019t care, because they were dressed. And so, I said to myself, at least I don\u2019t have to go\nthrough this. And that\u2019s the way I remained for two, three weeks, and then they had a big\nselection. And, and I don\u2019t know if you ever saw it, it\u2019s... the beds were like boards, you know\nwhat I\u2019m saying? Straight boards. And you were... it was down and up. It was two, two layers,\nthe boards. And I was upstairs. And they said everybody should go down because they had like\na selection.",
        "Q: Was this in the Revier or in the block?",
        "A: No, this was at the Revier. Revier means a hospital, that\u2019s what they used to call it. Yes. This\nwas at the Revier. And the SS came in and they said, \u201cEverybody come down from the bed.\nUsed to call it colliers (ph). And... and everybody should go down. I touched my next door girl\nand the other side and they were dead. They came from Greece and they couldn\u2019t... they\ncouldn\u2019t take the climate, because they were used to warm climate. And it, at that point it was\nnot warm in, in Auschwitz. It was winter time. And they just, they used to fly, lay, they fell like\nflies. They went to bed and they never got up. And I said to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d\nThis is all your head, you\u2019re talking to yourself. I don\u2019t stand a chance by going down, because\nyou had to take off whatever you wore and parade through them naked. And if they like the way\nyou looked, they put you one way and if they didn\u2019t, they gassed you. So, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going\nto give them satisfaction. I\u2019m not going down.\u201d And I remained like that on the bed. Somebody\ncarried on with you, you know, tell you not to do it. And the Doctor, Doctor Mengele was a very\ntall fellow. And he touched one, two, and here I was laying in the middle. And he didn\u2019t touch\n13\nme, because I was still warm. They could have taken me down and killed me. And I remained\nlike that, so this actually saved my life.",
        "Q: How did you know it was Doctor Mengele?",
        "A: Oh, you could tell. They announced it, too. They announced everything. You knew. Yeah, you\ncouldn\u2019t do nothing about it, but you knew. And then somehow, I, I don\u2019t remember it was from\nGreece or from a different country, that gave them a lot of... I think 1t was from Greece. And\nthey shouldn\u2019t gas. They stopped gassing for a while. And that\u2019s the way I remained on the...\non the Revier. And it saved me because I didn\u2019t have to get up in the morning, like I said before,\nto stand outside and wait for the Zahl Appell. And I got the same, how did we used to call it?\nSame amount of food that I would get when I worked outside. That piece of bread and that soup.\nAnd I was friendly with a girl, she was not far from Auschwitz, we were sleeping together and\neating together and between the two of us... she lives in England now. Between the two of us,\nwe had two slices of bread, so we were rich. So one slice we have to... we used to save it up for\nthe night meal and for the morning, we took along the other one to work. We never finished\nboth slices of bread. One we put away.",
        "Q: Was she in the Revier with you?",
        "A: Oh yes, she was all over. No. She was not... after. After. No, not in the Revier. She was not\nwith me in the Revier.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Halina.",
        "Q: Halina, what was her last name?",
        "A: Oh, what was her last name? I know, I have to take a look in the book, because... She lives in\nEngland.",
        "Q: Okay, we can check later, if you\u2019d like.",
        "A: Yeah, I have to take a look in the book, so. You want it now, shall I take a look?",
        "Q: Sure. You can say it. What was her name?",
        "A: Halina Lichtenstein.",
        "Q: Okay, thank you. Can you, were you about to say something else or shall I ask a question now?",
        "A: Ask me a question.",
        "Q: Okay, you mentioned before you got the burn on your leg, that you were working, you were\ndigging ditches. Were you working outside of the camp?\n14",
        "A: Outside, outside, yes, we used to go from the Zah/ Appell from in the morning, they used to take\nyou to work by groups. I don\u2019t know how many people they needed that day. So, like they\ncounted off thirty, forty, sixty, whatever they needed, and we marched. We followed them and\nwhatever they said to do, that\u2019s what you had to do that day. A lot of times they brought back a\nlot of girls, back dead ones, because they didn\u2019t like the way they looked, or for no reason at all.\nAnd they brought them back on... on two pieces of wood, actually. And that\u2019s they put them\nback, because they had to account, each and everyone they took out from the gate, to bring the\nsame amount back, even if dead. But they had to bring you back. And that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: Were you living in the... do you remember where your barrack was? Was it in...",
        "A: Oh sure. Twenty-one was the, from there they used to take you to gas. But this must have been\nfour or five.",
        "Q: In Birkenau?",
        "A: In Birkenau and then we went to Auschwitz. From Birkenau it was a terrible place. First of all\nwhen I arrived there we didn\u2019t have no water yet. We had a lot of mud and I lost a shoe. If you\nput your foot in, you couldn\u2019t take it out, you had to leave the shoe. And it was horrible. It was\nnot to be believed that you could do that to people. And mostly young people, because they\nnever chose elderly, because they didn\u2019t, they only needed you to work. And the elderly, of\ncourse, didn\u2019t have no strength, so they gassed them right away. But the younger ones, they... as\nlong as they needed you, they used you and then after that they killed you. And that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Do you remember the prisoner functionaries, Kapos...?",
        "A: Oh sure, I remember the Kapos very well, yes.",
        "Q: Will you tell me about, what your experience was with them?",
        "A: I had very bad experience with them. Like I said, we were in Birkenau and the first thing in the\nmorning, after they, of course, cut my hair, put the number on and did everything else what they\nhad to, separated us, of course, from the loved ones. And six o\u2019clock in the morning or five\no\u2019clock in the morning, these four people from Czechoslovakia, they came before us. And they\nwere real meanies. Mean. They had nothing nice about them. And the first thing out of their\nmouth at six o\u2019clock in the morning was \u201cPolska koovi stavach (ph).\u201d I... 1, the first time in my\nlife, by that point, I heard. It meant, to explain it, \u201cPolish whores, get up.\u201d And I was so\nbewildered with that saying, because I didn\u2019t know even what a whore meant at that point. And\nthat was my first greeting with the Kapos. And from then on, like I said, there was nobody that\ntold you, but you figured out already what\u2019s going on and, and that\u2019s it. You cannot go under\ntheir nails, you cannot ask for anything, because you\u2019re not going to get it and you have to obey.\nYou have to leave at a certain time your room and then that\u2019s it. You couldn\u2019t stay there. To\nremain on the bed? Never, because they would gas you right away. And like I said, luck was\nwith me, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s luck, or... I always said, that through my life, through my stories I\nalways feel that somebody carries on with you. Or whatever it happens in life, that somebody\n15\ncarries on with you. It\u2019s God will. I shouldn\u2019t have gotten off the bed. Had I gotten off the bed,\nthey would have taken me immediately. But like I said, my brain told me, you\u2019ll never make it.\nAnd don\u2019t get undressed and don\u2019t go through him. And I remained. And like I said before, I\nwas in the Revier after a few weeks. And of course they didn\u2019t treat me, but at least I had the\nchance to... not to go outside. And then I got a better job. So the woman that took care on me,\nshe was a Polish woman\u2014not took care, but she spoke to me, let\u2019s put it this way\u2014on the\nRevier, was a very nice person. So one day I approached her after being there maybe three or\nfour months. So I, I asked her if... she used to come in the morning, she was wearing a white\ncoat. And she was clean and she had a short hair cut. She was really pretty woman.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: She was a Polish... Magda, I think it was. And I, I approached her one morning. And I said to\nher, \u201cWhat do you do with the water after you finish washing yourself?\u201d And she looked at me.\nShe says, \u201cWhy? Do you want to drink it?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, who drinks dirty water?\u201d I said, \u201cI\nwant to wash myself around the way you do. I want to be clean. I want to look good like you\ndo.\u201d So, something went into her head and she, every day that she came in, in the morning, she\nbrought me a, you know, a basin, a small basin with water with the soap and the dirt and\neverything when she washed herself. And I used to wash myself around. And I felt so good, like\na million dollars. So I said to myself, how could I help the woman? I had no money. I can\u2019t\ngive her no money. I can\u2019t give her nothing that I have of me. What could I do? I said, okay,\nI\u2019m going to help her to clean out. She was cleaning out under the beds, the walk. And I said, I\nhave to help her. Before she gets here, I\u2019m going to do it and when she comes she won\u2019t have so\nmuch work. So, I told her. But when I went down, I could, I fainted from laying so long on the\nbed. That I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t do. So I got up, and somebody helped me to go back on the bed.\nWhen she came in that day, I told her what happened. She says, \u201cIf you want to live, you must\nget off that bed.\u201d I said, \u201cSure I want to live.\u201d So, she said, \u201cBut let\u2019s do it...\u201d\u201d\" excuse me. \u201cYou\nstart doing it before the SS comes 1n, before they change.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know what time it was,\nfour or five o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t know. So I climbed down again from the bed and I was able to stand\nfor a minute. So this was really a big accomplishment. And I took a chair and I pushed it. And I\nwas walking, like jumping, I couldn\u2019t put down yet the foot all the way on the bottom, on the\nfloor like. But every day I tried, until I got stronger.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n16\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Justine Lerner. Okay, go ahead with the\nstory about cleaning.",
        "A: About cleaning for that woman. And she appreciated it very, very much. And she thought it was\nvery clever of me to do a thing like that. And she used to give me an extra piece of bread. And\nat that point, she told me that I cannot remain on the bed. I have to get off and they were, they\nwere trying out... there was a period of time that they didn\u2019t gas. They got a lot of money. I\nthink it was from Turkey or I can\u2019t remember exactly from where it was. And this was to, to\nhold off the, the selections. And she said they were trying, they were looking for, for nurses.\nThat pretty soon they were going to ask who wants to become a nurse. So, she said to me, \u201cI\nwould advise you to volunteer for that.\u201d So, that\u2019s exactly what I did. I volunteered and I was\ntransferred from this into a different, a better place, not too far from one another. And I didn\u2019t\nget as a nurse, but I got as... when the new arrivals came on, when they took off their clothes,\nthe personal things you had to leave there too, everything. And you had to go through to look for\ndiamonds, or for money people used to sew in their clothes. And that\u2019s what was my job.",
        "Q: This is the Canada commando?",
        "A: Oh yeah, that\u2019s right. You know that. Yes, yes, Canada, yes, right, right, right. So that\u2019s where\nI worked. And of course the SS stood right by and there was big boxes like, how do you... like\npiggy banks, but of course it was not a piggy bank, but it was a, big boxes with locks on top.\nAnd they used to... had to put in all the, whatever you got, put it right in there. And this was my\njob. And then you had to bring in the clothes to the zone or whatever they call it. It\u2019s like a, they\nused to... like cleaners, they used to clean the clothes. They went through the heat, and that\u2019s\nwhat... I don\u2019t know what they did with it afterwards, but that\u2019s what it was. And that\u2019s what I\nwas working for. And this helped me, too, not to get outside with my leg. And of course, it\nhealed by now, but I... 1t left me a terrible scar. It... it grew like wild flesh on it, but I was\nhappy that I could walk on it. And that\u2019s what it was. When I came out of there, when people\nsaw me that they knew me, they didn\u2019t believe that I\u2019m alive, because months I was not with\nthem.",
        "Q: Did you go back to living in the same barrack that you were living in, sleeping in before you\nwent to the Revier?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go to that barrack because I was in a different place already. And... but it was a\nbetter place, because there, like I said before, you didn\u2019t have to stand outside in... for the Zah/\nAppell. They knew exactly where we are and where we\u2019re working and that\u2019s what it happened.",
        "Q: So, there was not more Zahl Appell at all?",
        "A: No, no more in the morning, no more Zah/l Appells, no. You didn\u2019t have... they didn\u2019t have to\ncount you already, because they knew there were so many people, so many people are working\nthere and that\u2019s what it was. My luck that I had the job.\n17",
        "Q: Is this where you met, you mentioned that you had a friend...?",
        "A: Halina?",
        "Q: Halina.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s where I met her. Halina Lichtenstein, yes, we became very good friends, like sisters.\nAnd like I was telling you before, we never finished the bread and everybody used to be envious.\nHow could we do it? I says, that\u2019s exactly what happened. We\u2019re not vultures. We thought\ntomorrow, we\u2019re going to live maybe till tomorrow, so we\u2019ll have the bread for tomorrow. A lot\nof people didn\u2019t do that. They... whatever they gave them, who knows if they\u20191l make it to\ntomorrow? In the meantime, they ate it up. And I never cut my bread. I always gave her, she\nshould do it. Because thinking, God forbid, maybe I\u2019m taking a bigger slice for myself. Would\nnever do that. That was in my mind. That\u2019s the way I was raised. And we were wonderful, we\nwere just like family.",
        "Q: Was she from Biatystok, too?",
        "A: No, she was from Bendin (ph), that\u2019s near Auschwitz, not too far from Auschwitz. So she was\nfrom around there, yes.",
        "Q: Do you think it helped you to survive, to have that little bit of humanity and kindness in your\nlife? Did that help you to have hope for your future?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It has to do... I never changed as far as helping people. All my life I suffered for\nthat. I never changed. I think it has to do with the upbringing, to do, be good, to help. Even\nnow, all my life I\u2019ve been like that, after the war too. If somebody... My mother was that way.\nIf somebody needed a donation, or to marry off a child and they had no money, my mother was\nalways there helping. She knew already the people, and they always gave her and she always put\nit in anonymous, not to know or to thank you what you did. This is a wonderful thing. And I do\nit the same way. All my life I\u2019ve been doing it. I got... my hair was cut off, but later on towards\nthe end, they allowed you a little hair to grow. And when the transfers from Bialystok came, and\nlike I said before, I had a good job already and I was trying to help. And they told me that the\nblock elteste (ph), in other words, this was the one that was watching them, the Kapo, she wanted\na doll. Like I said before, we were working, we were working with the clothes and, and so I told\nsomebody else, if they came along, you find a doll, put 1t away. Hide it. I took the doll and I\nthrew it over the, the fence. And they caught me. And they pulled me out. And they cut my\nhair, again, because at that point already we had, you know, they let you have a little hair\nalready. And of course, when they take the hair off, they take all the beauty away, especially to a\nwoman. And they put me on a, on a pail in the middle of everybody, like at Zah/ Appell, and\nthey gave me sixteen, uh, with a belt.",
        "Q: Lashes?",
        "A: Lashes. And that\u2019s it, you couldn\u2019t cry, and you couldn\u2019t say anything. And that\u2019s that. You\nwere guilty. You took it and that\u2019s what it was. So you would think I forgot already? No. Then\n18\nsomebody else needed something else, but that\u2019s the way Iam. I can\u2019t help myself, always good\nto people. I always shared.",
        "Q: Were you injured by that to the point where it was hard to work? Or did you recover?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t injured. No, I was not injured, but I was ashamed. The shame was there, but not the\ninjury. It hurt for a bit, the backside hurt, of course, but not ashamed. I was ashamed rather than\npain, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "Q: Did you have dreams and fantasies, things that you would do to escape in your mind, at least?",
        "A: No, I knew I could never make it. No, no, no. I was just like a lamb. I was following whatever\nthey said. I helped people, yes. I have a friend, that I saved her. She lives in Brooklyn yet.\nCalled me last week. Sonja Rotenberg (ph) is her name. She had malaria, and there was a\nselection going through. And she, and I was working that time. She said to me, \u201cJustine, Jospe,\nJospele, help me, help me, help me.\u201d So I took a beet, and I rubbed her cheeks, and I put her on\na clean nightgown. And instead of going through this way and shaking, I put a mattress under\nher, she could quiet down. And instead of going this way, she went that way. And all her life...\nshe\u2019s in Brooklyn. And always, forever, said, \u201cShe was the one that saved my life. She was the\none that saved my life.\u2019 And I always did things that seemed possible, let\u2019s put it this way, just to\nhelp out somebody. But that\u2019s my nature, I can\u2019t help it.",
        "Q: When... what would... do you remember what you would talk about with your friend, like with\nHalina or any other friends when you weren\u2019t working?",
        "A: I remember a lot... you couldn\u2019t talk while you were working. I\u2019m talking about already after\nthe war we were together in France.",
        "Q: Did you have a chance to talk together while you weren\u2019t working while you were in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Here and there a word, but you couldn\u2019t make the conversation, because they were watching and\nnobody wanted we should get hurt. You know what I\u2019m saying? So if it was important you said\none word, but otherwise you wouldn\u2019t talk. You couldn\u2019t have a conversation, especially when\nthey were standing and watching you. Uh uh.",
        "Q: Did you work, how many days a week did you work?",
        "A: Every day. There was no Sabbath, no Sunday, no, every day you worked.",
        "Q: From morning until...",
        "A: From morning until, they had to bring you back at a certain time, five or six o\u2019clock, depends the\ntime of the year. If the day was longer, you worked longer. If the day was getting dark, you had\nto return back.\n19",
        "Q: Did you have any hope that you would survive? Did you have an idea that it would end\nsometime?",
        "A: Not at this point. Not from the beginning, you had no hope. Later on you started to have hope.\nBut not from that point.",
        "Q: How did you start to have hope? Did you get any news from the outside world?",
        "A: You didn\u2019t have to get news. First of all, they were evacuating us from Auschwitz, because the\nRussians came close and they did not... the Germans did not want to fall into the Russian hands.\nSo, they evacuated us to Ravensbriick. Ravensbriick was another camp, but it was not as bad as\nAuschwitz. They didn\u2019t have the gassing chambers. It was just a concentration camp and there I\ngot a job in the kitchen. And I was dishing out food and everybody came over, \u201cJospele, Jospele,\ngive me some food.\u201d Just pour it in. You know, because I, it was not mine to begin with, and\nthey were hungry. So I always did that. In that respect I was lucky, I always got good jobs. And\nthen from Ravensbrick they transferred us to Switau. That\u2019s where we were liberated. And\nthere, I was already there with nine, nine girls. All of us were Jewish girls. And somehow, like I\nsaid before, this was not a concentration camp. They couldn\u2019t gas you there. It was just\nworking, a camp, a concentration, but without the, without the, what do you call that? The gas\nchambers. So, now we were there nine girls and there were a lot of Polish women that were\nfrom Auschwitz. And they exactly knew that we are Jews. So, one day we spoke among\nourselves and we decided that we\u2019re not going to go in, all of us, together to wash in the\nmorning, because we didn\u2019t want to be with anybody that should identify us. So, we ran in and\nwe washed ourselves, like three of them and three stood outside. And that\u2019s the way we made it\nup. Sure enough, one day all of the Polish, and they were even anti-Semites. They were very\nmean. It\u2019s not that we took anything away, but they had to squeal, they had to tell that we are\nnot, that we are not gentiles, we are Jews. And sure enough, one day they found out. And they\nwent and they squealed. And they called us all out. These, these, these, you know, the numbers\nthey called and we had to go in the front. And they said to us, \u201cAre you Jewish? Are you\nJews?\u201d We said, \u201cNo.\u201d We made it up before, because we felt that it\u2019s the end. That was what\nit was trying to come. We heard the, you know, that\u2019s a battlefield going on. We heard the\nshooting. We heard the cannonen (ph), they used to call it, the... everything, but we didn\u2019t know\nexactly when it\u2019s going to be the end. We knew it\u2019s nearby. So, that\u2019s the way we made up, that\nwe... each one was going to say, \u201cMy mother was Jewish, my father was a gentile.\u201d The other\none said, \u201cMy father was gentile, my mother was Jewish.\u201d You know, all of us denying. And\nthey looked, and they looked, and they looked and thank God, they didn\u2019t kill us. But... and\nthen from there we went to Switau. This was the last camp.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to, sorry, \u2019'm going to interrupt you a little bit, because I wanted to hear about how\nyou got from... I don\u2019t want get too far ahead of it, because I wanted to hear about...",
        "A: Hmm. I\u2019m making it already finished. (Laughter.)",
        "Q: ...Yeah. There was a time...",
        "A: You got to go?\n20\nDaniel Lerner (Justine\u2019s grandson): Yeah.",
        "Q: Would you tell me about, let\u2019s go back to the time that you were in Auschwitz and you\u2019re getting\nready to leave. Did you leave on a forced march? How did that happen?",
        "A: We left, they put us back on buses, open buses. And I remember like now it was snowing. And\nwe all climbed up on the buses. And they were taking us... we didn\u2019t know where, but we got to\nRavensbruck.",
        "Q: This was winter 1945? Is that right?",
        "A: \u201845, right. We stayed in Ravensbrick not too long, maybe six months. And from there we went\nto last one, Switau, the Czechs. And that was, that\u2019s where we were liberated from.",
        "Q: So, you were, you didn\u2019t have to march out of...?",
        "A: No, no. Some of them from the beginning, they took them by foot. We went by train, by bus.\nYeah, they loaded us up on the buses and we traveled by bus, because it was a few selections\nfrom Auschwitz, two or three, because a lot of them went by foot and they ran away from there.\nThat my friend\u2019s... her husband did that. He escaped, because he knew the area. It was, Bendin\nwas not too far from Auschwitz. And he knew exactly the area, the woods, and that\u2019s where he\nescaped to.",
        "Q: Who, who... I\u2019m sorry. Will you repeat who escaped?",
        "A: That\u2019s my friend\u2019s husband. Halina, the one that is England now, her husband did that.",
        "Q: She was married at the time?",
        "A: She was married before the war, right. Right. She was a little older than I was. She was married\nbefore the war. And that\u2019s what her husband escaped into the woods, because they knew the\narea very well.",
        "Q: Were you with Halina on the buses away from...?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember. She had to be together, because we were on the last\none. We were in Switau together.",
        "Q: Were you in Ravensbruck together?",
        "A: In Ravensbrick together, too, yeah. So we were there together, right.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about the journey by bus?\n21",
        "A: It was not a bus like a bus. It was like a truck, you know. The journey was terrible, because it\nwas like unknown, you didn\u2019t know where you were going. And that\u2019s all I could remember\nactually from that.",
        "Q: What kind of a bus was it? Was it closed?",
        "A: Open, open like cattle, you know, like an open big bus. A truck better than a bus. A truck I\nwould say, an open truck, yes.",
        "Q: And were you with people who were from the Canada Commando that you worked with?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: All women or women and men?",
        "A: All women. There was no men down there, all women. Different blocks had men, but no, we\nwere all women.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you can think of to tell me about your time in Auschwitz? Was there\nanything striking that happened to you? Anything you want to say?",
        "A: The only thing I could remember 1s like I said, they burned my leg and when they cut my hair\noff. And they hit me. Otherwise, oh sure when I came out of the Revier, out of the hospital,\npeople didn\u2019t want to believe that I\u2019m alive, because they, they didn\u2019t see me for months. So,\nthis was a shock to a lot of them, even my cousin, but we stayed together. And nothing else, I\nmean I witnessed a lot, but nothing else that I could really say, that unusual, you know what I\u2019m\nsaying? Everybody else there lived the same thing.",
        "Q: You had a cousin who was in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yes, yes. The only two, my mother and her mother were sisters and she came with the second\ntransport, but she was ten years younger than I was. She was, I think, the youngest thing in\nAuschwitz. She passed away three years ago. She had a heart attack.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Her name was Leah Weitzenfeld (ph), and she was married in New York.",
        "Q: Weitzenfeld was her maiden name?",
        "A: Weitzenfeld was her maiden name, yes, Leah Weitzenfeld, yes. And she has two children, a son,\nwho\u2019s a pharmacist and he married a pharmacist. And we are in touch. They live in Brooklyn,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Did you try, did you have any information at all when you were in Auschwitz about what had\nhappened to your family? Was there any way to find out?\n22",
        "A: No, no. When the second transport came, or the third one it would have to be, they said that they\nsaw my mother coming into Auschwitz. The people from Biatystok, interviewed them. And\nthey said... and that\u2019s when I got hit, when they wanted a doll for the Block elteste (ph), for the\nKapo. And that\u2019s when I tried to organize and give it to her. And that\u2019s what happened. And\nthat\u2019s when they said, in that transport my mother was, but I did not see her. I did not see\nanybody, no. That was last time. When I met them at, when we arrived in Auschwitz, I never\nsaw them again. Always hoping, always searching, always looking, but of course, nothing.\nWhen I was in Paris, we lived in Paris for a year, after the war, of course. And I was always\ngoing on the trains, looking. In Europe the trains are much better than... you never saw a train,\ndid you? Oh, in Washington they have beautiful trains. Here, because it was riding in\nWashington on the train. But by us in New York, the trains were horrible. And I always used to\nrun from train to train. That\u2019s what I did in Paris, looking, the searching. From the back, look\nlike my sister, from the back look like my brother. Always thinking, looking into their eyes, but\nof course, it was not them. But I always thought, yes, yes, I\u2019m going to find somebody. But\nthat\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Now, going back again, just a little bit. I don\u2019t know whether this question is going to be clear,\nbut you described before you arrived in Auschwitz how, what a close-knit family you were.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You were all very close and you were dependent on your parents to a certain degree to kind of\ntell you what was going on and to give you a sense of how things, like what the future might be.\nAnd you talked about how you trusted your father and your father always believed that things\nwould turn out all right. It must have been a terrible shock to arrive and be suddenly separated\nfrom everyone you knew and yet somehow, somehow you survived that. Can you say something\nabout how you adjusted to that extreme change?",
        "A: I always felt, this I told my friends in Paris also, that this was my mother\u2019s and my father\u2019s last\nwish, that somebody has to remain from the family and carry on. And I was the one to survive\nand that\u2019s what I have to do. I have to build back what we lost. That\u2019s the way I lived after the\nwar. But of course, it\u2019s just like a, like a made up story, but it\u2019s, this helped me a lot in my life.\nLike I\u2019m not doing it, but somebody else tells me to do it.",
        "Q: That was what kept you going in the camp?",
        "A: That\u2019s what kept me going. My friend told me that, too. Halina, the one from England. There\nwas a time in my life when I was in Paris, I\u2019m going way ahead. This was after the war and we\nwere liberated. And the Americans liberated us. And each of us from the nine girls that there\nwere, had family in the United States. I had an uncle. This one had a sister and this one had in\nSouth America. Every one of us had family and they advised us that we shouldn\u2019t go back to\nPoland. They asked us, what do we want to do. And we said, we want to go to Poland to look\nfor the family. And they advised us not to go back to Poland, because at that point already\neverything was shared up already, what belongs to whom. Poland belonged to Russia already.\nAnd they told us not to go, because we\u2019ll never get out of there. So, the only thing they advised,\n23\nadvised us, excuse me, is we should go back to Paris. Excuse me. So, the Americans, the ones\nthat liberated, advised us not to go back to Paris, uh, not to go back to Poland. We should go to\nParis, from there the organizations will take over and we\u2019ll find our family and then we\u2019ll be able\nto get to them. So that\u2019s exactly what happened. They gave us a paper and they put us on,\nbecause we had no clothes. So, they gave us a paper, and they gave us uniforms that the WACs\nwore and they put us on the train. And we were going to Paris from Switau, from the Czechs, we\nwere going to Paris. And on the way they took us off the train one stop and they said that we\nshouldn\u2019t talk to them, we should just give them the paper. And sure enough on the, the next\nstop they put us back on and we came to Paris. And there Rothschild gave us, it was a hotel.\nAnd they gave us the hotel for the misplaced people. And that\u2019s what it was. We slept two ina\nroom and downstairs was a kitchen. So, and we used to be able to come down and eat. Now, I\ndon\u2019t remember how long I was there, but I just couldn\u2019t go down with a dish again and eat. So,\nI cried so much. But it was more tears in the dish than it was food. And I decide I\u2019m going to\ncook for myself. And each floor, they had like a two burner. So, that\u2019s what happened. I bought\nsome potatoes and that\u2019s what I used to cook. But of course, there was like a line. You know,\nyou had to wait quite a while, but it was for me better not to go downstairs, but to cook and eat\nfor myself. And so, that\u2019s where I got in with my friend. I slept with Halina, with my girlfriend.\nMy cousin and another friend was in the other room. We were... we had nine rooms, one after\nthe other. And at one point practically everybody found their family already and they were\nleaving. And of course, me, I didn\u2019t find my family, didn\u2019t find my uncle. And the only thing 1s,\nI said to myself and I said to them too, either he\u2019s very rich, he doesn\u2019t want to identify himself,\nor he died, one of the two, so many years. So...",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to, I\u2019m sorry to do this, but I\u2019m going to interrupt you again, because I\u2019m going to\nforget...",
        "A: We skipped too much.",
        "Q: Yeah, we need to go back.",
        "A: We need to go back, yes.",
        "Q: And find out a little bit. But we\u2019ll remember...",
        "A: Where we stopped...",
        "Q: ...where we left off.",
        "A: Yes, in Paris.",
        "Q: And come back to that, okay?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You were, we were talking a little while ago about the trip from Auschwitz to Ravensbrick.\n24",
        "A: Ravensbrick, right.",
        "Q: And you had mentioned a little earlier a little bit about Ravensbriick, but would you tell me more\nabout the conditions there and what the living conditions were like, where you slept and so forth?\nAnd then I'll ask you a few questions about Ravensbrick.",
        "A: The sleeping conditions were practically the same, but the only thing is, there we already had\nwater. You could wash yourself whenever you wanted. And of course the food was the same,\nbut we didn\u2019t have the...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n25\nTape 2, Side B",
        "Q: Tape two, side B of an interview with Justine Lerner. You were telling me about arriving.",
        "A: Ravensbrick, yeah. And we didn\u2019t have it on our heads that there is gas chamber. So you were\na little bit more at ease than you were in Auschwitz. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the only\nthing.",
        "Q: You were with your cousin at that point, too?",
        "A: My cousin, I don\u2019t remember her being in Ravensbriick, because I think we were not. In\nAuschwitz we were together. And then after the war, in the last one we were together. In the\nlast one we were, but Ravensbrtick, I don\u2019t remember if she was with me.",
        "Q: Do you know how long the journey from Auschwitz to Ravensbriick took?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. It had to be a few hours, maybe five or six hours for sure.",
        "Q: Did you have the sense at that time that the war was coming close to an end?",
        "A: Only from, because you were talking among yourself. I mean, here and there somebody passed\nby and they heard a radio. So this came the news, but otherwise we were not allowed to have\nany, any news. But like I said, you heard, heard the guns, I mean you had to be deaf not to hear\nit, because it was nearby. But of course, we did not know when we were going to be liberated.\nWe knew it was close, but how close we did not know. Because at one point like we used to\nhear \u201croooh, roooh\u201d all night long and then all of a sudden it got quiet. So we figured it out,\ngeniuses, that they pushed them back. You know what I\u2019m saying? And then again, and then\nagain it was too quiet. But we knew that the end is near, but we didn\u2019t know how near it was.",
        "Q: You said you got a job in the kitchen? Is that right?",
        "A: Always the kitchen. I love the kitchen. (Laughing.) I... how did it happen? By luck, like I said\nbefore, nothing unusual, just picked, you know. And that\u2019s it. And like I said before, everybody\nput in their, their thing and took out some food and of course, I didn\u2019t stop them. And that\u2019s it.\nAnd that\u2019s what people appreciated. Always was there for the undertaker, I always let them do.",
        "Q: Did people look out for you, too? You talk about how you were looking out for other people.\nDo you think people were looking out for you too, as a result?",
        "A: I always had belief that they would. I always believed that they would. I had very dear friends\nand that\u2019s what actually helped me in actual life, because family we didn\u2019t have. And we were\nlike sisters and brothers. When you first came to the, to the United States and prior to that, we\nwere looking for one another and when we found each other it was like, like you found\nsomebody from the family. And don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s over fifty years and we still, the ones that are\nalive, we are very, very close. There is no week that I shouldn\u2019t speak to them. And helping in\n26\nevery way that we could, if God forbid somebody\u2019s sick. When it happened to me, only my\nfriend from concentration camp helped me.",
        "Q: When you were, when you had... when you were attacked?",
        "A: Yes, when I was attacked and left in the house. So, I was all alone. My husband had passed\naway and my tenant moved out that day, the one that lived upstairs. And there was nobody,\nnobody. And that day I was supposed to go to a funeral, also from, one from concentration\ncamp. She lost her son of cancer, young fellow. And I was going to go to the funeral. And I\nhad a ride. She didn\u2019t live too far from me, a few blocks. And when I came down on the block\nthey told that they just left. They didn\u2019t wait for me. I was very disappointed and hurt, and\nunbelievable, how could you not wait? I don\u2019t know if up to today, if they forgot or they just\ndidn\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know. Because right after this it happened. And I never... I don\u2019t know\nthem so well. But being she lives on the block, I was going to go with their neighbor, which they\nwere also survivors of the Holocaust. But like I said, I didn\u2019t know them so close. So I really\ndon\u2019t know if they did it deliberately or if they forgot, because I never was able to discuss it with\nthem. So, when I came there on the block and it was very short for me, maybe two blocks. So\nthe neighbor said to me, \u201cWhom you looking for?\u201d So, I told her. She said, \u201cThey just left.\nEverybody left.\u201d So, I came home and I got undressed. This was on a Friday, and started to\nprepare for dinner. And I opened up the window. And the, I had a, a, you know, what they call\nthat? For the air to come through. Like a shade or whatever it\u2019s called. And not thinking, not\nthinking, that God forbid somebody\u2019s going to climb in through that, open up the window and\nget in. And he hit me in the head, cut my face. I don\u2019t know, he broke my arms, they were\nhanging, both of them. He did something terrible. And my friend... me and his wife, she passed\naway, we were the best of friends from concentration camp. I\u2019m now friends with her daughters,\nalways was. They live in New York... he knew that I was supposed to go to the funeral. He\ndidn\u2019t go. And he kept calling. Called in the evening and no answer. So he couldn\u2019t figure it\nout what\u2019s going on. Then he thought maybe I went to, the woman that lost her son, to their\ndaughter, to stay with them, help out. So, Sunday he came along to the house and I lived on the\ncorner. And he walked around, parked the car and he walked around this way. \u201cJustine, Justine,\nwhere are you?\u201d And I don\u2019t know from what and when. I yelled out, \u201cHere Iam. Save me,\nhelp me.\u201d And that\u2019s when he heard my voice. Across the street was sitting women, neighbors.\nSo they, he asked the neighbors, \u201cDid you see Justine?\u201d And she said \u201cNo, but I\u2019m wondering,\nthe light is on. She never used to leave the light on. The light is on and I haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d So,\nwhen he heard that, he ran over to them and they climbed through the window, the kitchen\nwindow, because I had a porch, like a terrace like this, but higher. And they went in, one of\nthem went in through the window and they found me laying on the floor in my bedroom in a\npuddle of blood. And that\u2019s when they called the police. And the police called an ambulance\nand that\u2019s why they put me into a hospital, a trauma hospital. And they called my son and that\u2019s\nwhat happened.",
        "Q: How long had you been lying there before somebody found you?",
        "A: Twenty-four hours.",
        "Q: Oh, my.\n27",
        "A: Twenty-four hours, from Friday, I don\u2019t know what time Friday. But from Friday till Sunday. It\nhad to be Friday maybe twelve or one o\u2019clock in the afternoon. And that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s... we\u2019ll come back to that time again later, but let\u2019s again go back to the time that you\nwere in Ravensbruck. And you, you started working in the kitchen. Was there brutality on the\npart of the guards? Or were things starting to ease off?",
        "A: No, no, we didn\u2019t find it so bad. It was like a paradise away from Auschwitz in Ravensbriick. It\nwas much better, much better, different people, different looks. And like I said before, the gas\nchambers were not on top of our heads, on top of it. And we had experience already. We were\nabout already a few years. So, it was much easier than Auschwitz.",
        "Q: You had enough to eat? Did you have enough to eat?",
        "A: Like we were... I don\u2019t know. We never complained about the food. Never. We never. You,\nyou didn\u2019t have the room to complain, but I think it was much better than in Auschwitz.\nAuschwitz was the worst.",
        "Q: How long were you in, do you have any sense of how long you were in Ravensbriick?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t, maybe five months at most, I think.",
        "Q: And then how did it happen that you went from there to Switau?",
        "A: They used to take people to different camps, so that\u2019s where they took us to Switzerland. Uh, to\nSwitau. That\u2019s in the Czechs, Czechoslovakia, yes, that\u2019s where it was.",
        "Q: And that was a camp?",
        "A: It was a camp, yeah, but they did not have, like I said before, they did not have the gas chambers\nthere. Just working camp, you know? But no, no gas chambers, no smoke coming out from the\nroof.",
        "Q: How many of you were in that transport? Was there a large transport from Ravensbriick?",
        "A: Nine, we were nine girls.",
        "Q: Only nine girls.",
        "A: Only nine girls. No, I mean the Jewish girls. We stayed together, we were only nine. There was\na lot of them coming from Ravensbriick to Switau, but we stayed together. We were, like I said\nbefore, the only nine Jewish girls, Jewish girls that were there.",
        "Q: So in Ravensbriick, you nine Jewish girls stuck together there, too?\n28",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. We stuck together a long time, yes, yes.",
        "Q: So when you were deported on the buses from Auschwitz to Ravensbrick, were those buses,\nwere the people on the bus mostly non-Jewish prisoners?",
        "A: Mostly of them. Mostly, but maybe there were a lot of Jews too, that we didn\u2019t know. You\nknow what I\u2019m saying? But we stayed together. Yeah. Everybody had somebody that, you\nknow, was holding onto somebody. And that\u2019s exactly what it was.",
        "Q: What were you doing in Switau?",
        "A: The same thing like we did in Auschwitz, nothing worked that you could say that you worked at\na machine, you did something, something that you learned a trade or anything... nothing like\nthat. We just were working and digging and that\u2019s it. And first, one day you digged and the\nsecond day you covered it. It\u2019s... that was the work, labor, that was nothing special that you did.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea what the goal was in the labor? Was something being built or arranged?\nOr were you in the dark about that?",
        "A: In the dark about everything. No. You didn\u2019t have a radio, you didn\u2019t have nothing. You only\ndepended on the, on the people that heard news. If you passed by, you heard a radio, so you\nlistened in on a word or two. That\u2019s what you....but you didn\u2019t have no first class news. No,\nyou did not know.",
        "Q: How were the living conditions there in Switau?",
        "A: The same thing like in Ravensbrick, this was the same thing. It was a little more scary like I\nsaid because they pulled us out, you know, and we had to tell them. But otherwise it was the\nsame conditions.",
        "Q: So people there...",
        "A: You had more bedrooms maybe. It was a little more elaborate than Auschwitz. You had the\nwater, you had to go to the bathrooms. So this was... when we first came to Auschwitz, we\ndidn\u2019t have that.",
        "Q: You could clean yourself in Switau?",
        "A: In Switau, yes, you were able to do that.",
        "Q: You could... every day could you clean yourself?",
        "A: Every day, yes, yes, you could clean yourself, yes. They had a big washroom maybe three times\nas big as that room, for the ladies, for the women to go into. So they had a basin and they had\nsoap. You could wash yourself around, yes. Yeah, it meant a lot. Because, well, you liked to\nstay clean, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, 1t means a lot to you.\n29",
        "Q: Was it all women there in Switau?",
        "A: Yes, all women. There was no men there. There was no men there.",
        "Q: Do you have any sense of how many people were there?",
        "A: Oh, thousands, I\u2019m sure. Thousands, I\u2019m sure. But it was not comparing to Auschwitz. No.\nNone of them could you compare to Auschwitz. Mm-mm. The men\u2019s camps some of them you\ncould compare, like Dachau or another one, say you could compare to Auschwitz. But\nAuschwitz was the worst.",
        "Q: You mentioned a little earlier and I didn\u2019t fully understand... you were talking about how you\nwere trying to conceal your Jewish identity, you and the other girls. So when you arrived in\nSwitau, people, the camp authorities didn\u2019t know that you were Jewish?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Is that right, they didn\u2019t know?",
        "A: No, they did not know. But the Poles, of course, they find out and they... they didn\u2019t know what\nit means, the triangle. Because the Jews had a triangle by the number. And they knew it. And\nbecause no matter discreet you could be, but they were always on top of you. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. And they were very mean. I mean, what did it hurt them that somebody else should\nremain alive? But that\u2019s in their upbringing, hate, hate, hate. And that\u2019s the way they have to\nlive with them for the rest of their lives.",
        "Q: Did that surprise you, the anti-Semitism that the Poles were showing?",
        "A: The Poles, everybody knows that they are very anti-Semite. They had no love for us and I had\nno love for them. I had love for the ones that my mother used to do business with, but they\nchanged too, during the war. They did. When I asked for something else like this, \u201cWe don\u2019t\nhave it, we don\u2019t have it.\u201d They did not go out of their way to help. But yes, a lot of them, I\nheard from stories, my friend for instance, that the people used to leave the children, like infants\na few months old. And they wanted to place them in a home in... by Poles, when they knew,\nthey gave the money for keeping. And the children never returned back to the... I mean the\nparents didn\u2019t survive, but the kids never returned back to their home, they remained Catholics,\nthe way they raised them.",
        "Q: Did you have any sense of faith during the war years?",
        "A: A sense of what?",
        "Q: Faith.\n30",
        "A: I would say that I had. I always believed that somebody above carries on with you. Whatever\nhappens in your life, somebody\u2019s there to, to help you. Yeah, faith means a big thing to me, yes.",
        "Q: And that wasn\u2019t destroyed by what you saw at Auschwitz?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t say that I became more pious, you know, more, but I would say I\u2019m on the same level\nlike I was. A lot of people made fun out of me, too. Some of them turned out to have no religion\nat all. I always believed. I always kept a kosher home, when I was there. After the war, up till\ntoday, I wouldn\u2019t mix certain foods, like we are not allowed to have cheese and meat. I would...\nI wouldn\u2019t touch that. It goes against me. I was raised that way. I was brought up that way.\nAnd that\u2019s the way I tried to keep it. Now I have my different town. It\u2019s very hard to get certain\nfoods. So I used to have separate dishes all my life. I used to conduct myself very, very nice,\ndidn\u2019t mix up anything. Now, I don\u2019t do that. To be honest, I don\u2019t do that. But I will not, still\nnot eat the meat and the dairy together. Goes against me.",
        "Q: You said that people made fun of you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: They made fun of you for having faith or...?",
        "A: For having faith.",
        "Q: In the camps?",
        "A: No. No, out of camps. When we were... after the war I\u2019m talking. In the camp, no, no. After\nthe war. And those were all, we were all among our own, but some of them, like I said before,\nlost their faith completely and some of them didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: What would they make fun of you about?",
        "A: Not fun exactly, it\u2019s fun... because... \u201cOh, stop being stupid,\u201d or things like that. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t\nmean a thing.\u201d You know what I\u2019m saying? They had no religion in them at all. I couldn\u2019t do\nthat. I like to go to the Temple when a holiday came along or anything that came up. I felt that\u2019s\nmy place. Even my husband was not a believer and he came out from a very pious family. But\nhe saw what\u2019s happening, he lost it completely. But I was different, I was holding onto this.",
        "Q: So when you, it was discovered that you were Jews, you and the other girls who were in Switau.\nThe Poles told the authorities of the camp that you were Jewish.",
        "A: We were hiding that we are Jewish. And we were hiding and not telling the truth, that\u2019s what it\nwas. A day or two later they took us out from the Zah/ Appell, there where you stood there to be\ncounted. And they called out all the numbers. I don\u2019t know how they knew the numbers. They\nmust have pointed it out, days. And they called us all out. And we had made up, we figured\nsomething, because once they found us and they started to ask us questions. So, we knew right\naway that they were going to... they not going to keep our secret. And they were in Auschwitz\n31\nthe same like we were. But those were mostly people that had, either they were, what do you\ncall that, politics\u00ae or... because they wouldn\u2019t take them Poles just to Auschwitz, or they were\nprostitutes or whatever, something like that, that\u2019s why they were, stayed in Auschwitz. But they\nhad to give out, they had to squeal. And that\u2019s what happened. They called us all out. We were\nnine people and they started to ask questions. I said, you know, \u201cMy father was Jewish, my\nmother was Irish,\u201d whatever. And the other one said her mother was Jewish, her father was not.\nEach one, we made up among ourselves that\u2019s what we were going to say. And that\u2019s exactly\nwhat happened. And they spared us the life. They really did.",
        "Q: They believed you and they...",
        "A: They believed us.",
        "Q: Did you, did they do anything...?",
        "A: That we were mixed, mixed. They used to call us mischling, something like that, to that effect.\nMixed marriages. And it was practical because a lot of people did get married, you know, like\nthis. But they didn\u2019t touch us. They didn\u2019t do nothing. Of course, we didn\u2019t know, we were\nshivering. But that\u2019s what it was. And the minute they spotted us, they started to ask us\nquestions. How, how, how come we had the triangle?",
        "Q: Did anything happen to you after that? Did they do anything to....Was there any more\nharassment from the Poles in the group?",
        "A: We stayed away from them. We tried to stay away from them as far as possible. We shouldn\u2019t\nmeet. But of course, sometimes you couldn\u2019t help it. You had to walk through the same path\nlike they did, but we knew exactly not to say anything, not to talk, you know. Be proud and go\non and that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s right. No, they were very mean people, a mean machine. That\u2019s it.\nThey had no conscience.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you found out that they had squealed?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t find out that they squealed, but we understood. Because that\u2019s the only ones that met\nus. Nobody else knew us. And that\u2019s what happened. We knew right away. The minute they\nstarted to ask questions about the triangle, we knew that we are finished. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. Because nobody else would know that Jewish people have a triangle. They had\nnumbers just like we did, but of course they didn\u2019t have....So they compared right away and they\nknew what was going on. Because nobody else would think up a thing like that.",
        "Q: What were the questions that... you said that during the Zahl Appell they were asking you\nquestions and you responded with talking about how you had...",
        "A: Mixed marriages.",
        "Q: Mixed marriages. What kinds of questions were they asking you?\n3 Political prisoners\n32",
        "A: Are you Jewish? And I said, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s a mixed marriage. My mother was gentile and my\nfather was Jewish.\u201d And they bought it. And all of us said the same thing. So, that\u2019s the only\nway we could get out of it. Because of course, Jews they didn\u2019t keep. They, they, I don\u2019t know\nwhat they did with them. Did they kill them back in the... I really can\u2019t say, but that\u2019s what it\nwas. And that\u2019s what came to our mind to say, that all mixed marriages. And for that they had a\nlittle bit more respect, I guess.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day of liberation?",
        "A: Oh, sure. I remember like now. Everything that happened in my life, I\u2019m always in the\nbathroom. Any excitement. I\u2019m always . And all of a sudden you hear screaming.\nIt was a lot of hills, in Switau, I mean in the Czechs, a lot of hills. So everybody started to\nscream, \u201cThe Americans are here! The Americans are here!\u201d What you heard them coming with\nmotorcycles up the hill, you know, up and down, a lot of them. And they were wearing masks,\nlike to see through, the dust shouldn\u2019t go into their eyes, I guess, and mouth. I mean, that\u2019s the\nway I assumed. And they all came to a certain spot. Like in the middle of the... and they, and\nthey stopped. And they announced that the Americans... that they are the Americans and they\ncame to liberate us. And we shouldn\u2019t be afraid. And of course, they had the business of picking\nup the Germans, too, that watched us. And I ran out from the bathroom with my pants down and\nI came to the spot and I pulled it up. And it was like a miracle, like, like you see it in the movies.\nYou couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t see it otherwise, and unbelievable too, that we are free. And they\nsaid to us, \u201cWe came to liberate you. Be very, very careful not...\u2019 \u2014this was on the second or\non the third day, I remember\u2014 \u201cnot to pick up any food and conserves.\u201d They had a lot of\nthings, the German, in jars. And we shouldn\u2019t eat no meat, because our stomachs are not used to\nit, because a lot of people fell and they died from it. And we should be very careful, if possible,\nwe should mostly eat rice and drink water. And they were just like, like sisters and brothers we\nfound. And among of them was a chaplain and he said to us, not to us, to everybody, to the\nwhole camp, whoever is Jewish should come forward. And we were still hesitating, because we\ndidn\u2019t trust anybody already. And a few minutes later we stepped out, all of us. He said not to\nbe afraid, they\u2019ll try to help us in every way. And this was a few days later, about two, three\ndays later, maybe. And that we shouldn\u2019t go back to Poland like I said before, because the\nRussians are there already. Everything was already arranged. And that they\u2019ll help us and\neverybody from among the nine of us had family in the United States, so we should come to, go\nto Paris and from there the organizations will take over. And they\u2019Il find the family.",
        "Q: What language was he speaking?",
        "A: Yiddish.",
        "Q: Yiddish.",
        "A: This was a chaplain from the Army.",
        "Q: Did you speak English at all?\n33",
        "A: Hello and good-bye. (Laughing.) No, I did not. I spoke Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish and that\u2019s\nit. I didn\u2019t speak English at that time. And they brought us to Paris and like I said before the\norganizations took over and Rothschild gave us a hotel and that\u2019s where we stayed until we left\nParis.",
        "Q: So how long did you stay in Switau after the liberation?",
        "A: In Switau maybe three or four days.",
        "Q: What was your physical condition like at that time?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. The impact in you was driving you, you know, you were healthy, but underneath\nyou were not healthy, because when I came to Paris\u2014this was months later\u2014TI used to go and I\nused to fall, had no strength in my legs. But at that point, I was strong like a bull, I didn\u2019t, you\nknow, that drive, that drives you to do, to survive, and to go on. And after a while when you find\nout that\u2019s when it all starts. You find out that you have nobody and you get disappointed and it\u2019s\nharder to take. But with a little help from your friends... that\u2019s what it did. Like my friend, the\none that\u2019s in England, I got very depressed after while when I knew that this one is leaving and\nthat one is leaving and I\u2019m staying, I\u2019m going to remain alone in Paris. And I didn\u2019t want to go\nout. I didn\u2019t want to see anybody and... and I didn\u2019t care. That everything was finished, and\nthere\u2019s nothing more to go...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n34\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: Continuation of an interview with Justin Lerner. This is tape number three, side A. You were\ntalking about being in Paris?",
        "A: Yes. And I started to get very depressed and didn\u2019t want to go on. There was no use in life\nalready. And then my friend, that she\u2019s now in England, said to me, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure that\nthe mother\u2019s wish was somebody should survive. And you are the one that survived and if you\ndon\u2019t want to go on, open up the window and throw yourself out and get it over with. But don\u2019t\nmake everybody miserable and yourself.\u201d And this few words put so much sense into my mind.\nI took a turn around and I said, \u201cShe\u2019s right, ve got to go on. I\u2019ve got to do it for them.\u201d And\nthat\u2019s the way I live all my life. That they would want me to be that way. And that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Did you feel a lot of anger after the war ended, at the Germans? Or at the world? Or at\nanybody? What did....",
        "A: Anger was not the word for it. Disgraced. Anger, I knew I can do nothing, but how could\npeople live like that? To do that, one to another? This was hard to understand. And to kill\neverybody, not to have anybody. To be alone in the whole world. That\u2019s what bugged. But we\nall of us had the same thing, the same actually lookout on life. You got to build, you got to start\nfrom scratch and be productive and do what your parents wanted you to do. And that\u2019s exactly\nhow I went on all my life like that.",
        "Q: Do you... go ahead.",
        "A: The, the will to live and to carry on and to bring a new people into this world, that\u2019s what we\ntried to. And to help one another. And we very seldom spoke about anything like that. Took us\nyears. When they erected the monument in, in Washington, so we went to Washington. And we\nwent like eight or nine friends. And I remember being at the cemetery, Arlington Cemetery in\nWashington. And... and we had a lot of soldiers down there, came to, interviewed us. They had\nthe American flag going around and they had people from the media. And in the back of me,\nthey had, they were taking pictures and they were talking, speeches. And there was a big, heavy\ncable. And all of a sudden a young gentleman touches me and he says to me, be careful. I\nshouldn\u2019t go back, because the cable, Ill fall. And the answer was I cannot fall anymore. I was\nfallen enough. And somehow, that youngster, I will never forget him, did not disappear from us.\nAnd he started to make conversations. And he ask us, where do we go from here? From the\ncemetery? And I told him, we are going to the Capital that time. And he says, \u201cCould I come\nalong with you?\u201d I says, \u201cWhat are you, you know, hanging around us? Somebody send you?\u201d\nAnd it turned out that... I said, \u201cDo you go to school? Do you go to college? Do you have to\nwrite thesis?\u201d I... we couldn\u2019t understand. He took us by train home, because he had a... he had\na small car, so we couldn\u2019t go in, all of us, into the car. So left the car where it was parked on\nthe cemetery, not far from there and he took us by train to go to the Washington, to the, where\nthe monument is going to be erected. Because he asked us, where do we have to go? And for\nthe first time we went on a train. A beautiful train in Washington. And then we went to the\nCapitol. We had lunch there and we paid for his lunch. And he wanted to spend with us a\nwhole, a whole evening, but we were going from there on. But he found us so interesting. And\n35\nhe was in law school and wanted, like you, and he wanted to know more and more about it. But\nhe was a very nice gentleman. He had company that night coming, so he couldn\u2019t stay with us in\nthe evening, because we had everything set up for us. You know we were there for three days.\nBut it was very interesting. And... and that\u2019s it. And that... because he wanted to know more\nand more and more. How do we feel out of life? How do... our outlook on life. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s\ntime to cry and it\u2019s time to love, and that\u2019s the way it goes. Time for life and time to... and\nthat\u2019s it. That\u2019s our motto. You got to go on till the end, there\u2019s no alternative. You can\u2019t go\nbackwards. You got to go forward.\u201d",
        "Q: You mentioned earlier, that you were staying in a hotel in Paris?",
        "A: Yes, Paris, Rothschild gave us the hotel.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of the hotel, by any chance?",
        "A: It was on Rue Giparteau (ph). That was the address. And this was Rothschild gave this to us,\nwithout charge, no money, no nothing. Yes.",
        "Q: Were you still with all of your friends, the girls?",
        "A: All of my friends, yes. We were there, yes, but like I said, I remained the last one. They all left\nbefore me. And it was... it was nice, I mean, it was livable. We had... everybody had the same.\nYou had two beds in every room and a bathroom, which was very nice. And of course, no\ncharge, because we had no money to pay them. And we got the meals downstairs and... and\nthose were your headquarters. If you had to go to... and a lot of times people came, helping you,\nasking you questions. \u201cWhere are you from? What was your family name?\u201d Reporters. \u201cHow\nmany in your family?\u201d You know. All kinds of questions till you get tired of answering, too.\nAnd nothing came out of it. And then towards the end, I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, because it\nbrings too much hurt in you. And one night, I make... I was sitting in my room and I think it\nwas with Halina, yeah, or maybe she went down, I was alone. And all of a sudden I heard\nscreaming on the corridor. And I said, \u201cOh my God, the Germans came back?\u201d You didn\u2019t\nknow. You were like a lamb. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Finally I opened up the door. I\nwanted to see what was going on. And there was my husband, at that time I didn\u2019t know him\nyet, and kissing my two friends, the two sisters. And they were crying and screaming and they\nintroduced me to him. \u201cThis 1s,\u201d how did they call it? \u201cA /andsman,\u201d this means from the same\ntown. And they met him. He came looking for people that survived. He heard that there was\npeople there and he was still in the Army and that\u2019s when he came over. So, they introduced me\nto him and I went into the house, to my room and I said \u201cGood night, nice knowing you,\u201d and I\nleft. And he used to come to them every single day. He used to bring them soap, a piece of\nchocolate and sardines. And if they had too much, they gave it to me. They shared with me a\nlittle bit, which was very nice of them. And that\u2019s when I found out more about it. And a short\ntime later, they left. They went to South America, to Paraguay, which they had family there.\nAnd at this point everything was ready and they left. And my husband came around a few times,\nbut I didn\u2019t pay no attention to him. And then he was discharged from the Army and he went\nback to the States. And he came in twice more. And the girls had made up with me, the two\nsisters, they knew I had nobody. At that point I didn\u2019t find my uncle yet... that if I want to come\n36\nto South America where they are, they have a brother, that is, that is, his wife was left in Poland.\nHe left before the war, and the wife didn\u2019t get a chance to go out. And that they would want me\nvery much in the family. And that\u2019s when all the trouble started. And I said, that\u2019s nice, that\nwas very nice of them. But of course, they meant more for themselves than for me. And then\nmy husband, I told him the story about what happened and after a while he came out and he told\nme the truth. They had mentioned to me that he was married before the war and they had one\nchild. And my husband knew that he had two children. And he must have been old like my\nfather.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, who was married before the war?",
        "A: The two friends, the two sisters that left for South America, to Paraguay. This was their brother\nand they wanted me for a sister-in-law. And they think I didn\u2019t have anybody and they knew me\nfrom concentration camp. So, they wanted me, I should come out to them. And they have a\nbrother that the wife didn\u2019t... did not survive. And they wanted me, I should...",
        "Q: They thought they could make a match.",
        "A: ...a match. So, I didn\u2019t know anything. So, I said, \u201cLet him write to me and we\u2019|l see later\nwhat\u2019s going to be.\u201d But I never got a letter from them. I only got telegrams. I should come out\nthere. And they send, they bought me the passage to go and everything and like a dummy, I\ndidn\u2019t know from nothing. I\u2019m going to Paraguay.",
        "Q: What were the names of your friends in Paraguay?",
        "A: Sure, Sonja and what was the other one? Sonja Braun (ph), Braun is her name. And what was\nthe other one? I can\u2019t remember her name.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Maybe it\u2019s going to come back to me like before, but right now I can\u2019t think of her name.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: And that they want me there very, very much. And like I said, \u201cTell him to write to me and we\u2019 ll\nsee what\u2019s going to be. Or send a picture on top of it.\u201d But this never materialized. I only got\nlike right away telegrams and telegrams and that they\u2019re making out the papers. And they\u2019re\ngoing to send me... I have to go and get a visa. And they\u2019re going to pay for the fare and\neverything. They knew I had no money. And then when my husband came back and he asked\nme, did I find my uncle. And I said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going\nto Paraguay, that Sonja and,\u201d oh I can\u2019t think of her name, the other one, \u201cwants me there. And\nthey want me, they have a brother for me.\u201d And he knew the whole family, what was going on.\nThen it came out a few months later, didn\u2019t tell me right away, the truth. That he was married, I\nsaid, I knew, but he had two children. They only said he had one. And the age they didn\u2019t tell\nme. And he was almost the age like my father. And that\u2019s what happened. And then, so my\nhusband said to me, \u201cGive me the, all the particulars that you knew about your uncle. Give it to\n37\nme.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired. I don\u2019t want it, anything else.\u201d The only thing is I could think\nis he\u2019s very rich, the same speech, or he\u2019s passed away. I remembered the children, their names,\nI remembered his name. I remembered his wife\u2019s name. But I did not remember the address\nwhere he lived. This my mother told us just before the war broke, before we were, we were\nseparated, that we should all remember. And that\u2019s what happened, the address I forgot where\nhe lived. And that\u2019s what it was so hard for him to find me, for me to find him, rather. Excuse\nme. And the papers that he read, there was a lot of Jewish papers them years. So, instead of The\nDay they called it, you read Good Morning. So, I put it in this paper and he read the other paper.\nSo, so I gave my husband all the particulars, he went back to the States. And that\u2019s it. And two\ndays later or three days later, I get a letter, my uncle. And he sent me twenty dollars, he put it\ninto the envelope. But he just found out from the soldier, Mr. Lerner, that I\u2019m alive and he\u2019s\ngoing send out papers for me that I should come to the States here. And being nobody survived\nwith me, my cousin, that was his sister, too. It was one brother and two sisters, so I was from\none sister and my cousin was from the other sister. And he wants very, very much I should come\nto the United States. And that\u2019s the way it started. So, in the interim I, I sent him a letter. That I\nwas mad, because I took it very wrong that he doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge himself. This was\nmy pride, but it was not so. He was very, you know, devoted and healthy, happy that I\u2019m alive,\nthat somebody\u2019s alive from the family. And interested, very, I should come and he\u2019Il try to help\nin every way. And that he\u2019s sending out papers. But then from there instead of sending me\nletters, they sent me telegrams. And they bought me already the, the, everything, they paid the\nfare in for me to go by plane to South America. And I started to put... and then he came again,\nmy husband. I was over a year in Paris. And by that time, he came again, once more. He joined\nthe Merchant Marines and he went back and forth. And he told me... and I told him what\u2019s on\nmy mind. And when he told me that... yeah, a picture came from them. And he was in the back.\nBecause I wrote them, \u201cI never got a picture, I never got a letter, I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going\non. You don\u2019t keep your promise. I\u2019m not going to keep my promise.\u201d You know, that\u2019s the\nway I was talking to my... writing to my friends.",
        "Q: Your friends in Paraguay, you\u2019re talking about now?",
        "A: Right, right, them two, yes. And then I got a picture from them all. The ones that I knew. When\nmy husband came, I showed him the picture and he said that\u2019s not him. He was very short. But\nthey put a stool in the back, that\u2019s why he was in the back. So, that\u2019s when I put two and two\ntogether. And I went back... yeah and between... I had to go through Spain to go to them,\nthrough Spain, I had to stop in Spain. So, I had to have a visa from Spain. In the interim, Spain\nand Paris, and France didn\u2019t... had some kind of delay or whatever. They had some kind of\nargument. This was right after the war and they wouldn\u2019t allow anybody. So, I had to be stuck\nagain in Paris. And that\u2019s what happened. I went back to ORT, ORT is a Jewish organization\nthat they knew the whole story. And I went back to them and I told them, \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d And\nthe girl said to me, \u201cWhat are you crazy or something? You couldn\u2019t wait to get out of Paris\nalready to go and now all of a sudden you change your mind.\u201d And I told her the whole story,\nwhat was going on. And she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I cannot help you. You\u2019ll have to go from\nParaguay, if you don\u2019t like it there, you\u2019ll have to go whatever you want from there. But in the\ninterim you must go.\u201d I said, \u201cThere 1s no such thing with must.\u201d I went... I said, \u201cI want to see\nsomebody higher than you, different authority. And there came a gentleman and I told him the\nstory. And he says, \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d And that\u2019s when I... I had a friend in Paris that went with me\n38\nwith all these things. Halina\u2019s friend, she came from the same town. And she was very nice to\nus. She used to call us in for dinner and whatever we had to go, she went along with us. She\nwas very, very helping. And then I decided I\u2019m not going to go. And I waited in Paris and my\nhusband wanted to marry me. And I said, to myself, \u201cOkay.\u201d It was over a year. I couldn\u2019t find\nanybody. And we decided to get married. But in order for me and him, go together to the\nUnited States, we had to get married in Paris. So we had a beautiful wedding in Paris, invited all\nmy friends. And after a while we came over here.",
        "Q: Had you had any feelings for your husband before that point? Did you ...?",
        "A: Oh sure, it took me over a year. I didn\u2019t want to... he was coming back and forth, but I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what was going on. You know what I\u2019m saying? He had feelings, and I had feelings,\nbut I wasn\u2019t ready yet, let\u2019s put it this way. Because I was still searching and looking and once I\npromised, I didn\u2019t want to break my promise on top of it. Once I heard what he told me, I\nbelieved him and that\u2019s what happened. They were very nice and very good, but they wanted\ngood for their brother, too, so they wanted me. Because they knew I wouldn\u2019t have to go any\nplace else. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out. And that\u2019s what happened. But I\u2019m happy. Got\nmarried already after a while and had a child, which I was very happy for the whole story. But\nwe got to see them after the war.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yeah. We went to South America. My husband had a sister in Argentina. And from there\nwe went to, to see them. I didn\u2019t want to go, but my husband insisted and we went. And that\u2019s\nwhat happened. And after that they came quite a few times to New York, so they came to see\nme, too.",
        "Q: Did you talk to your husband about what had happened to you during the war? Did you tell him\nstories?",
        "A: Oh sure, all along, sure. He knew everything, because he only hung out with people that lived\nthrough the war, because we were always together.",
        "Q: You mentioned, did he, was he born in the United States or was he born in Europe?",
        "A: No, he was thirteen years old, that he came to, his father was, left before, five years prior to that.\nAnd then he came with the rest of the family.",
        "Q: Where was his family from?",
        "A: The same place where my girlfriends, my two friends. Where was he born? Not too far from\nBialystok. Oh God, your mind escapes you. Lomza. Lomza. That\u2019s not too far from Bialystok.\nThat\u2019s where he was raised and born, down there. His mother was still in Europe. His father\nwas in the United States. So he went to visit her in 1939, just before the war broke out. And\nthat\u2019s when he met all these people again, because they were from the same town and they were\n39\nvery close. So, when the war ended, that\u2019s when he met them in Paris. He came searching.\nThat\u2019s exactly where he met them.",
        "Q: Was your husband the first man that you had ever dated, or had ever been involved with\nromantically?",
        "A: I would say we went out in Poland, actually, before the war broke out. Like I said, I belonged to\nthe Jabotinski, to the... but yes, to be exactly, yes. Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that difficult for you to be, becoming involved with someone after having gone through\nwhat you had just been through?",
        "A: Well, I was not, not like today the girls, they go and they sleep with their men. We didn\u2019t do\nthese things. I would never do that. Had to wait to get married in order to be near each other. I\nstayed at Rue Giparteau (ph) and he was in a hotel. But it was, you have to trust somebody in\norder to, to be honest with somebody, I mean. You look nice and you look good and had all\nkinds of promises, and that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: You had lost so much of your childhood and of your teenage years, that young women are\nnormally, you know...",
        "A: Wild, and... yes.",
        "Q: ... Just learning about each other and having fun.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t have that, definitely not. We did not have that. We had no, a broken childhood,\nactually. That\u2019s what it was. Yes, and that\u2019s why when I see a kid of twelve, thirteen years old,\nincluding my grand-daughter doing the hair, streaking. I say, \u201cIs that necessary?\u201d I can\u2019t see it\nfor dust. I cannot see it. Because we were... I didn\u2019t put on lipstick until my wedding day. Did\nnot. Now I cover all up all the things. (Laughing.) But them years? No. Never smoked, never\ndid anything like that.",
        "Q: Had you had a fantasy of getting married? Had you ever thought about it?",
        "A: Yeah, a fantasy, of course. But you didn\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s not like over here, you talk to your\nfriends. \u201cThis happened, that\u2019... no, we didn\u2019t... I was not of that age, you know, to talk about\nthings like that. Because like I said, I had younger, older sisters than me. But no, I didn\u2019t have\nsuch fantasies, no, like the kids today, no. My fantasy was just to bring in food in the house and\nwe should have what to eat, and... and we should all be together. This was my childhood. It\u2019s\ndifferent.",
        "Q: What about your hopes and dreams for yourself after the war and you got over your depression\nand you made the decision that you were going to go on living your life? Did you want to\ncontinue your education? Or did you want to have children? What was the thing that was in\nyour...?\n40",
        "A: The education, at that point, I did not go, because you started to build a life for yourself. And of\ncourse, I wanted to go have a child. And we were just starting out, so it was not actually for me\nto go to school. That\u2019s the way I looked at it. I just wanted to help my husband and build a\nhome. And I used to go to school at night, night school they had them years. And I was helping\nmy husband. We were working like hand to hand, and to become somebody, to make something\nout of yourself. And then we wanted to have a baby, so it took me almost seven years until I had\nmy son. And this was a big thing, because all my friends had children already. So, it\u2019s another\nthing. But thank God, he was born and I was very proud of him. And he was the whole life to\nme and to my husband, both of us. And we only saw that he should have a better life than we\ndid. And he should go to college and he should be somebody. That\u2019s it. That was my main\nthing.",
        "Q: Before we go on to that, when you were in Paris and you had the opportunity to come to the\nU.S., had you had any thoughts before that or any dreams of going to Palestine?",
        "A: No. I... my cousin went to Palestine, because she was younger than me, ten years. And she\nwent with a child\u2019s transport from Paris. And I wanted to go with her very, very much, because\nonce I found her, I didn\u2019t want to let go. And especially I was older. And, but I couldn\u2019t go,\nbecause this was just a child\u2019s transport. So, I said to myself, I could always go to Israel later on.\nSo, I remained in Paris and she went on to Israel. But at the end, I brought her here. She\nfinished her schooling. She was in a kibbutz. And she finished her schooling, she became a\nnurse, and then I took her here. But she was sick. I didn\u2019t even know. It was not an easy life,\nnot easy, because she saw her mother gassing. They put her in the twenty-fifth block they called\nit, when they got her. And she noticed the smoke coming out right away. They gassed her.",
        "Q: In Auschwitz?",
        "A: In Auschwitz, and she couldn\u2019t cope with it. I didn\u2019t know at that point. At that point we were\nall the same. But when she went to Israel, and that\u2019s when it all came out. She was lonely, and I\nbrought her to me. And she stayed with me a while, but she, she did not listen. I thought she\nwas mean, but she was sick already. What did I know about mental health? I didn\u2019t know about\nall these things. And then I married her off, but she did not stay with me anymore. She, she\nmoved out. She went to my uncle...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\n4]\nTape 3, Side B",
        "Q: Tape three, side B of an interview with Justine Lerner.",
        "A: And she went to my aunt, to my uncle\u2019s house, to stay with them for a while. But of course I had\nsaid to my aunt, \u201cCall me one night.\u201d\u2019 And she came, when I brought her, I was pregnant with\nmy son. And like I said before, it took me seven years almost. And she... when he was born... I\nwas maybe in my ninth month already when she got over here, and if I said to her, \u201cI want to\nspend more time with the kids.\u201d She came... I got her a job to work in a hospital, but not as a\nnurse, as a nurse\u2019s aide, because she didn\u2019t have the diploma. And they wouldn\u2019t acknowledge it\nat that time from Israel, all the years, you had to go through a test, which she wasn\u2019t ready for it.\nAnd no matter what I said, she took it, everything she took wrong. If I said day, she said night.\nNo matter what, how I tried, no matter what I did. If I jumped off the roof, she would keep...\nbut I didn\u2019t know like, she was sick. Couldn\u2019t understand. When I slept, she used to come into\nme in the bed. She was scared. She used to come in to sleep with us. And I said to myself,\nwhat\u2019s going on here? So, I took her to a doctor, took her to a family doctor, of course. Who\nknew about psychiatrists them years? And he prescribed a pill and she took it and that\u2019s it, but it\nwas not enough. She needed more than that. So I got her a... a room on my block and said,\n\u201cYou could come to eat by me, but not, not sleeping.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly how it was. And then\nshe, she was keeping company, already she met a nice fellow. But she had a hard life, she did\nnot know what....She had one, what do they call that? One attack after the other. She wound up\nin a mental hospital. And she couldn\u2019t deal with life. And that was a very big strain on me,\npunishing myself, what I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know what was going on. And I couldn\u2019t be to\nher a mother and I couldn\u2019t be to her the father. I could only be like the way I am, warm and,\nand everything else. Caring. But she didn\u2019t buy it. She didn\u2019t... she didn\u2019t understand. She\ndidn\u2019t have a happy life. She had a wonderful husband, a good, educated man. But she, herself,\ndidn\u2019t live the way it\u2019s supposed to, and she left two children. The boy I\u2019m very... very, very\nnice, and the girl is just like the mom.",
        "Q: This is the same cousin that you mentioned earlier, you were in Auschwitz with?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right, right. And that\u2019s the way it went on.",
        "Q: How did you get from Paris, how and when did you get from Paris to the United States?",
        "A: In \u201847, 1947. We got married and then we came to, to the States.",
        "Q: Did you come by ship?",
        "A: No, we came by plane. I came by ship. (Laughing.) They, they were transporting the soldiers\nback home. But being I was a G.I. bride, so I had the same privileges, but of course, you had to\nwait for a boat. So one day my husband goes down to get a paper and he comes back and he\n42\nshows me that the boat that we\u2019re supposed to go\u2014it was Marine Flasher (ph)\u2014I remember it\nlike now, got a... on fire in the, in the dock. And I thought he was kidding me. I thought he\nwasn\u2019t telling me the truth. So I looked at the picture. I didn\u2019t know how to read. So I looked at\nthe picture and that\u2019s exactly how it was. And then we had to wait three months for another ship,\nfor another boat. And on one side I remember was the men, and on the other side was the ladies,\ngated off, you know. And I was not a good, I couldn\u2019t take the ship. I was very sick, dizzy and\nsea sick, couldn\u2019t take the water. And I was laying more than I, than I was walking around. And\nhe tried to bring me food. And there was a matron watching us and she took a look at the tray.\nHe put down from everything, this was a joke. Put down from everything and the matron took a\nlook at it and she says, \u201cIf you bring her so much food, she\u2019s not sick enough to get up and eat.\u201d\n(Laughing.) So... but instead of going, we were supposed to go like nine days or ten, we went\nfifteen days. It was a broken up ship and was... got filled full of water. We thought we going to\ndrown. And then they fixed it in Halifax and then we came to the United States.",
        "Q: Was it a U.S. military ship?",
        "A: It had to be. I don\u2019t think she was in use in the military or they retired her. But that\u2019s what they\ntook and that\u2019s what we came back. Yeah. It was not a luxury ship, that\u2019s for sure.",
        "Q: What were your expectations of the United States or your ideas about it before you came?",
        "A: Before I came, dreaming, just tall buildings, you know, to see, how different would it be? How\nwould people accept me? My husband had a father, that we lived together. And he was very,\nvery nice to me. I adored that man. He was a very nice, pious man, very lovely and respectful,\nvery respectful. And it was just a pleasure to be with him. We moved into him. And he wanted\nto give us everything, whatever he had. He wanted to give us his room. There were two\nbedrooms. I says, \u201cPa, how could I take your bedroom? It\u2019s yours.\u201d So, we slept the two of us,\nhis bedroom was big and to the front, ours was like in a driveway. But I was happy that\nsomebody accepted us and I was very grateful. And you go on with your, whatever you have to\ndo. I went down in the morning to get breakfast, it was local, on the same block, a grocery,\ntoday you don\u2019t see it. Today you have supermarkets, big ones. That time everything was, and\nfrom the beginning when I went into the store everybody gave me their next. And then I figured\nout why, because they wanted to see if Ihave horns. (Laughing.) If I... how do I speak. It was\na pleasure. I didn\u2019t have to wait on lines, but it didn\u2019t last long. Because after a while they heard\nthat I\u2019m the same like they are, so they let me go to wait in line. And I used to shop, and bring\nhome the food, and make three meals a day, and it was just like my mother did, the same thing.",
        "Q: Where did you live? Where was this?",
        "A: On Newport Street, 448 Newport Street in Brooklyn. Yeah. It was a nice area. You were able\nto get a bus and a train. You know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have so many cars like they have now. You must have a car, otherwise you can\u2019t\nmove. No such thing.\n43",
        "Q: And when you said people wanted to see whether you had horns, were you talking about people\nwho were...",

That they wanted to see if I have horns, how\ndo I talk, how do I move myself different than they are. Curiosity I would say more than\nanything else. But then when they found out that I\u2019m just like them, they didn\u2019t let me go ahead\nof them anymore. I had to wait in line. And that\u2019s it.",

        "Q: Your friends had the feeling that they were discriminated against because they were survivors or\nbecause they were Jewish?",
        "A: Oh, they were Jewish, because they were survivors. They mixed with different kind of people. I\nreally don\u2019t know. A lot of them felt that way. I never did that.

And I said if I want to live\nhere, I have to learn. Have to learn to read and write and that\u2019s what I did. I went at night. And\none day I came home and I see the light is on, because my father-in-law\u2019s windows were to the\nfront. And as I was walking home, and I see... I got scared. I said, I hope he feels all right. And\nI come upstairs. We lived on the first floor. And I come upstairs and he\u2019s sitting and learning. I\nsays, \u201cPa, what are you doing? Do you feel all right? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m jealous\non you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re here such a short time and you\u2019re learning English.

I saw, at that point, was Ellis Island, them years, but of course\nI didn\u2019t see... the tall buildings amazed me very, very much, just to keep it up. And we had\nsomebody picking us up from the, from the boat and that\u2019s it. And my husband took me to, to\nhis friends. I mean not right away, but days after and we all became like friends. I fitted in right\naway, they did like me very much. And that\u2019s the way we remained friends all our lives. I had a\ngood life. And if 1t wasn\u2019t good, you have to make it good.

        "A: Uh uh, didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to be different than anybody else. I was always wanted to\nbe like somebody else. The number, couldn\u2019t live with it. I had to take it out. And I did and I\nwas very happy. And once I took it out, I\u2019m like everybody else. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s in my\nheart, but on the outside I look alike. If I] open up my mouth, of course you\u2019ll see ma\nforeigner, but I was never ashamed of being a foreigner. But I couldn\u2019t live with the number,\nbecause this made me different than everybody else. This I couldn\u2019t accept. So, when my son\nstarted to go to school, I said, that\u2019s when I\u2019Il take it off. And exactly I did that. And like I said\nbefore, I... if you ask me, \u201cOh that\u2019s what the 2\u201d No, this is my number and I\u2019m\nvery proud of it. In the hospital, whenever I was, that\u2019s my number. If somebody rang the bell\nand it was in the morning, I could open up the door in a house dress or my nightgown, but I\ncould not, would not let you see my number. Had to take a dish towel from the kitchen or\nsomething to put it on top. It was like unacceptable in my, in my life. I can\u2019t do it. One time a\nchild caught me and she asked me, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d And I told her, \u201cOh it\u2019s my telephone\n* German: grammatical.\n45\nnumber.\u201d I always found an excuse, I figured how the age, how she\u2019s going to accept it. Of\ncourse, she didn\u2019t accept that, she understood something. She says, \u201cNobody puts a telephone\nnumber,\u201d but I said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember, so I didn\u2019t want to lose it. So, that\u2019s why I put it there.\u201d\nBut you couldn\u2019t catch me the second time already without anything. I used to put on a tape to\ncover it if I had to go out. All the time until I took it off. It was like a, I don\u2019t know, it was like a\ndisbelief, a hurt. Not everybody felt the same way like me. A lot of my friends still have it, but I\njust couldn\u2019t live with it. I took it differently. And that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Did you talk to your son about your, did you talk to your son about your experiences during the\nHolocaust?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t talk to him directly, let\u2019s put it this way, to sit down like I\u2019m sitting down with you and\ntalking about it. Here and there I had the picture together. Because he always saw me crying.\nLike a holiday came, any occasion and it hurted him. I remember when my son was six, five or\nsix years old. And he came into the house and I don\u2019t know, I was sitting and crying. It had to\nbe some kind of a holiday, because this was the worst time of my life, not to have family sit at\nthe table, just the three of us. It was very hard for me, because like I said before, I was... I had a\nbig family and warm family, and I was missing it a lot. And he said to me, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\nWhat happened?\u201d \u201cNothing happened, Joel. I don\u2019t feel good. I\u2019m just crying. Everything is\nokay.\u201d And I wouldn\u2019t tell him. He took me around and he said to me, \u201cMa, when I get bigger\nI\u2019m going to marry you, don\u2019t cry.\u201d (Laughing.) I never forgot that. And boys have like\nprotected me then already. You know what I\u2019m saying? But he knew, I\u2019m sure that he knows\neverything, what went on. Here and there he heard it. But I never sat down, like I\u2019m sitting\ndown with you and telling, never.",

And she preaches in school and college, now.\nShe tells everybody the story. And she\u2019s very much into it. And I said, \u201cWhat the heck, let me\ntell my story, too.\u201d And that\u2019s it. I always said they have enough without me, but I guess each\nand everyone brings a different story to it.",

        "Q: ...that haunted you? Or did you have nightmares?",
        "A: Oh yes. Nightmares I didn\u2019t have. I am blessed, what I think, that a lot of people don\u2019t want to\nbelieve me. Even when they attacked me. I don\u2019t have no nightmares. I\u2019m not scared. This is\n46\nsomething in me, that I have no nightmares. My husband used to have nightmares. My friends\ntold me that their husbands had nightmares, but I never had nightmares. No, I can\u2019t say that.",
        "Q: But you did think a lot about that time in your own mind?",
        "A: Oh sure. Oh, in my own mind, all my life, I live with it. Like I said before, mostly holidays was\nvery painful. And feeling sorry for myself and hating myself. Why did I have to be the one to\nsurvive? But there\u2019s no answer for me. That\u2019s the way God wanted it and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all\nabout.",

        "Q: Tell me about your, what your husband did as a profession in the years that you spent in\nBrooklyn. Initially, how did he build his own life?",
        "A: My husband was in the real estate, not the big buildings, of course, but multiple dwellings, that\nthey called it. It was... we bought a house, an apartment building, four bedrooms, three\nbedrooms and he held that house. He did alterations. They fixed it. A lot of them were closed\nup. You brought them back to life. And not in the best areas, in the... for the poor people, let\u2019s\nput it this way. Middle class, no, it was lower than middle class. And it was working them. He\nwent for the plumber, he went for the electrician. He brought them back to life, those\napartments. And that\u2019s the way he used to used to build them up. Them years if you put in a\nnew gas range or you put in radiators they had in the walls for the heat, so you got a raise. And\nthat\u2019s the way he was working it. And from this he made, from one house, then he bought\nanother house, then he bought another house and paid the bank the mortgages, and... and I took\ncare on it. And that was his job. And I used to take the complaints in the house. So, this was\nmy job. And that\u2019s the way we built it up. He used to come home for lunch and dinner. We had\na real family life.",
        "Q: Did you feel like, you were talking a little bit earlier about how it was important for you to not\nfeel different than everybody else. Did you feel, did you come to feel like you belonged 1n this\ncountry and that you were an American?",

        "A: Yes, 1t was. I was very proud of myself that I made it. And I always felt if you live in a country,\nyou have to be able to know what\u2019s going on. Quite a few times I went, they called me for jury\nduty. And I told them, I says, \u201cCan\u2019t you get somebody better, more educated than me?\u201d And\nthey said, \u201cNo. You have a brain, you\u2019re using it, that\u2019s what\u2019s important. You know how to\nread and write?\u201d That\u2019s what it is. And one time, I was... they picked me on a case about\nweights and measures, and... and I told them... so, we made... they settled it out of court. And\nthey said, \u201cYou could go home.\u201d I asked the judge, I was there a whole week. \u201cThe money that\nwe're going to get, do we have to declare it?\u201d And he turned around and he said to me, \u201cLet\nyour conscience be the guidance.\u201d (Laughing.) And I\u2019m still laughing about it. Whatever they\ngive you. I don\u2019t remember exactly, seven or eight dollars a day. But the way he answered it. I\nsaid, \u201cDo I have to declare it?\u201d Like afraid to be good. You know what I am saying? To do\nwhat is the right thing to do. That was always me... I was always. And I asked him. He said,\n\u201cLet your conscience be the guide.\u201d I said thank you, and I went on.",
        "Q: So, did you report it or not?",
        "A: No, I did not, had no conscience. I think it was about sixty or seventy dollars I made that week.\nDon\u2019t forget I had to take off transportation, too. (Laughing.) But it was very funny. I thought\nit was very funny.",

If I didn\u2019t have no children yet, she wanted to go someplace, I babysat.\nWe always, always helping ways. If I made something and I knew that the kids are going to like,\nI used to bring over some food, and they enjoyed it. Things like European things, but they loved\nit, certain things that she didn\u2019t know how to make. And I had a lot of friends, American born,\nhere, but they were people, they were... I never had a problem. Never. They were them and I\nwas me, that\u2019s it. Maybe because they considered themselves an American and had friends. So\nmaybe that\u2019s what it was, but I never, never found any fault.",

I don\u2019t know why you have that\nfeeling in you.\u201d She was persecuted and this and that. I said, \u201cI was not sitting on my beautiful\nchair and watching television all my life, too.

And he\ndid two people the same day, me and another woman a block away. So, I mean... and it was not\na black boy. It was a white boy. So the mother is there. I should say that I feel sorry for the\nmother? No. That this would be a lie. She goes every day to court when it went on the case. I\nwas not there. My son was not there. So we had a lawyer, but they couldn\u2019t fight it without us.\nHe left me a cripple for the rest of my life and all the pain that I have with me, but nothing\nhelped.

Daniel\u2019s going to go along maybe later on a little bit. And I always visit\nthem, because I lived in Brooklyn and they know I have the love for them and they have their\nlove for me. I know they are very busy. I would like to see them more often. But I understand\nthat not only do they have their life, but I can\u2019t demand anything from them, because I\u2019m not\ngoing to get it. I should be thankful whatever I got and that\u2019s the way I go on. They respect me\nand I respect them and that\u2019s what it is. A lot of people cannot see it, the way I see it. I cannot\ndemand from anybody. Ill do myself. But my friend just lost her husband not long ago and he\nused to be, he used to take her all over and help her with every way. And she couldn\u2019t walk two\nblocks. Now of course, she finds it very, very hard. She has one daughter and the daughter is\ngetting tired of it already. She has a family too and she works. I said, \u201cBetty, get a hold of\nyourself. She has her life too. You can\u2019t demand too much, because you\u2019re not going to get it.\nThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault that, you know, you got spoiled all your life. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s\nall about. That\u2019s it. You, you can work. You can\u2019t go, walk? Get a cab, go whatever you have\nto do. There\u2019s no alternative. If you don\u2019t drive that\u2019s what you have to do.\u201d And I cannot lay\non anybody... I\u2019m always appreciative whatever you do, it\u2019s good, it\u2019s okay. I may think\ndifferently, but I\u2019m not going to give it out. I can\u2019t do that. I still know between right and wrong\nand I\u2019m a happy bird. I\u2019m very happy, all my life, like a stupid... [laughing] I\u2019m a happy-go-\nlucky.",
        "Q: You came to Kentucky after your attack, you were attacked in New York. And that was 1997?\nIs that right?",
        "A: Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah, it\u2019s going to be two years in June.",
        "Q: What were your ideas and expectations of Kentucky and what were your first impressions?",
        "A: I had no expectations. I didn\u2019t know at that point what was going on in my life. I... my husband\nnever wanted to move to Kentucky. He didn\u2019t like Kentucky. It was not for him. But being the\nneighborhood started to change, so I started to talk to him about it. He didn\u2019t want to listen to\nme. \u201cThat\u2019s my home and that\u2019s the way I\u2019m going to be there.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t have too much\nexpectations. I knew what was going on in Kentucky. The money talks. He found out, he felt\nlike that... if you want to meet somebody, you go out for lunch. My husband was from a\n52\ndifferent era, he knew his wife 1s going to make lunch and you come to the house. And I found it\nvery hard, too with that thing. Because they don\u2019t want to cook, everything 1s going out and he\nwas not used to a life like this.",
        "Q: You mean in Kentucky...?",
        "A: In Kentucky, in Kentucky, yes, yes, yes. So, he was not too much for Kentucky, but after he\npassed away, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I knew I couldn\u2019t stay too long where I was, because the\nneighborhood was changing. A lot of my friends moved away. So, where did they go? Either\nthey went to Florida or they went to New Jersey. And I figured Ill find out. So I went to\nFlorida for the winter for four months, and I... I still was undecided what to do. And then this\nthing came up and... and here Iam. And that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: What were your first impressions of Kentucky? You moved to Louisville, right?",
        "A: Yeah. What was my impression? I mean, I knew I\u2019Il never make a friend over here, because\nthat\u2019s my age. You make friends when you\u2019re young and you hold onto them. When you are an\nolder person, I don\u2019t want to hear their problems and they don\u2019t want to hear my problems. You\ntalk about sicknesses. Especially if I don\u2019t drive, that\u2019s a disability already. I cannot... I have to\nwait for somebody to take me. And I don\u2019t like that. I was always used to walk and do my own\nthing. And solve my own problems. I was a private person. I didn\u2019t like anybody to feel sorry\nfor me or whatever. So... but here I have no alternative. I have a woman that helps me. She\ntakes me all over, wherever I have to go. She makes the appointments for me with my doctors\nand that\u2019s it. I do my own cooking, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a lonely life.",
        "Q: Did you make any connections with the Jewish community, the Holocaust survivors?",
        "A: I never went to the Holocaust... I didn\u2019t even know that they had one over here. I would like\nyou to, if you have an address, to leave it and I'll find out more about it. This I would like very\nmuch. I didn\u2019t even know that they have a Holocaust... the Jewish, JCC, the Jewish...",
        "Q: Community Center?",
        "A: ... Community Center. I went after my husband passed away, and I came down for a holiday\nover here by myself. And my son took me around to show me I should settle over here in\nLouisville. So we made an appointment with the JCC that I should go over there, you know, and\nthey\u2019 Il tell me what I could do, what, what kind of facilities they have for senior citizens and all\nthat thing. So, he dropped me off at ten o\u2019clock in the morning. This was before I got hurt,\nbefore my accident. He dropped me off at ten o\u2019clock in the morning and she showed me the\nbuilding. She showed me all the things what they have for senior citizens. And he says, \u201cMa,\nyou\u2019re going to have lunch over here and I\u2019Il pick you up after lunch.\u201d I says, fine. So, the lady\ntakes me for a walk and shows me the building. And then she showed me downstairs where all\nthe senior citizens meet. And they were making a journal, because a journal comes out like\nevery month. And I was helping them to put the journal together. And I was very happy. And\nof course, I was the youngest one, you could imagine. (Laughing.) One didn\u2019t hear, one didn\u2019t\nsee, but I took everything fine, it\u2019s good. And I had my pocketbook with me, and I said to the\n53\nwoman that I was working with, I said, where could I, where do you leave your bags? Where do\nyou put your pocketbook? She says, \u201cPut it next to me on my... at the table. I\u2019Il sit over here\nand you\u2019ll sit next to me. We\u2019ll have lunch together.\u201d I says, fine, thank you. And it must have\nbeen maybe about ten to twelve. And the lady comes over, \u201cWhose bag is that? I said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nmine. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my seat.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I'll take it away. I didn\u2019t\nknow. The other one told me, that lady told me I could sit over here, no big deal.\u201d And it threw\nme off so much, that I just... I wasn\u2019t used to it. I said, \u201cAh, that\u2019s not for me. Let them stay\nwith them. I\u2019m not going to come back.\u201d And since then, I went again. I went to a concert there\nnot long ago. I try, but somehow, I don\u2019t get... 1t\u2019s not for me. I can\u2019t be like that, them... it\u2019s\nlike anything else, I don\u2019t know them. Let\u2019s put it this way. And to get acquainted at this point\nand to have their lunches, which I don\u2019t care for, it brings back too many memories. So, I\u2019d\nrather stay home. And here they have a pool and maybe I\u2019Il join the pool. I'll go over. [Pll take\na look. And that\u2019s it.",

        "Q: So, are mostly the people that you spend time with are Teresa, who\u2019s your caregiver and the\nmembers of your family?",
        "A: Right. Right. Well, I made friends with a lady over here. She\u2019s not Jewish, she\u2019s gentile, but\nwe have a lot in common and we\u2019re very good... so I go with her sometimes to a movie.\nTeresa\u2019s off, Saturday she works a few hours and Sundays she\u2019s off. So that\u2019s the days, she took\nme, that lady, to her daughter\u2019s. They had the Derby party. So, I brought a bottle of wine. I\nwent there, and they were very, very hospitable, very, very nice. I had a good time. But\notherwise, I stick to my family. And of course, my friends in New York. I talk to them.\nSaturday and Sunday, I\u2019m busy with the telephone. I mean during the week, too, but... I keep in\ntouch.",

My mother was in business. My\nfather, at that point already, couldn\u2019t work because he was sick, so he used to help in the house\nwith the children and he helped Mom in the business. And we were loved, getting along sisters\nand brothers, very good. And it was great. I went to school. My mother always believed in a\nprivate school. She never believed in a public school. So, we were taught Hebrew and Yiddish\nand Polish.",

He was like playing the part of the mother, because my father\nwas in the... he had... he used to make skins. But this didn\u2019t... he couldn\u2019t carry this on,\n2\nbecause he had problems breathing, had a weak heart. So he couldn\u2019t continue to doing that part.\nSo, that\u2019s when he had to quit his work and he stayed home with the children and helped out\nMom at the store. He was a very lovable man, good, caring, very caring for the family. He was\nnot born in Biatystok. He was born in Sokolka, which 1s not too far. My mother was born in\nBialystok. And we were surrounded, always, by love and by friends and by family.

But the neighbors on the block, just enough to say a hello and good-bye\nand they had their life, and we had our life. I never had any problem. My father used to have\nproblems, because he used to love soccer and every Saturday they had a soccer game. And after\nwe finished our lunch, we used to go. But he always took along a cane, in case they hit him or\nthey throw stones or whatever. If the game... if that team lost, you couldn\u2019t get home, because\nthey used to be very mad. And that\u2019s what they used to do. They used to throw stones, hit you,\nso he always took a cane along with him. But he wouldn\u2019t miss a game. He loved it. He loved\nthat sport.

        "A: Actually when you heard the stories, when you heard what\u2019s going on... we, of course you\nstarted to get scared, but we didn\u2019t know so much what, what\u2019s going on. And my father, may\nhe rest in peace, always said, he was a medic in the First World War and he always says that the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t do that. They may put you to work, but they will never harm you in any way.\nAnd like anything else, you listen to your parents, whatever they told you. I mean, you didn\u2019t\nhave much of a chance to run any place. We were on the... in our town, first came in the\nRussians. And we were with the Russians maybe a year. And we were on the... they evicted a\nlot of people that were in business for themselves. So, they put us on a truck to go, I don\u2019t know\nwhere, to Siberia or whatever.\n3",
        "A: Yes, the Russians did that, because my mother had a house and we had a store, so we were\nalready like, rich, you know what I\u2019m saying? So that\u2019s what happened. And my mother gave\nthem some money and they took us off the truck and we remained home. Had we known what\nwas going on, that we wouldn\u2019t stay home, of course we would have gone to Russia better. But\nthat\u2019s what it was. And then a year later, this was 1939, when the Germans came in. The\nRussians left and the Germans came in. And we were with them for a while from the beginning,\nthen they started to make all kinds of things. When the men went to the Temple, like on a\nSaturday, they burned down the whole Temple with the people inside, whoever it was there.\nThen one Saturday they took away all the men. They left the women, but all the men. And\nthat\u2019s when the trouble started. A while later, they put us into the ghetto and this was terrible.\nThe ghetto was terrible.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, like I said before, I have... I admired my sisters. I always looked up to them. My oldest\nsister was a designer. She was very good at it. She used to design for me clothes. She used to\nmake me dresses. My second sister, she was 1n the house. My third one, she loved school, but\nshe was sick. And I always used to complain to Mom, that she\u2019s... takes advantage of me. She\nhits me. Whatever she has, I cannot have it. Like we used to come from school on a Friday.\nShe wanted something special. She wanted some kind of pastry and she always got it. And\nmilk, she did not want it to eat, but it was in the house. I was forced to eat everything, whatever\nthey cooked for me. And I rebelled. And I came to my Mom\u2019s store. This was after months.\nAnd I came to my Mom\u2019s store and I started to cry. And I said to her, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You\ndon\u2019t love me.\u201d I mean, what could a child think? I don\u2019t know how old was I, maybe seven or\neight. And I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t love me.\u201d I says, \u201cHow could you say that to me?\u201d My mother\nsaid... I said, \u201c\u201cYou see, you yourself said when Fulma touches me...\u201d in other words, she gives\nme a...",
        "A: A pinch, exactly, I was looking for that. And that place hair wouldn\u2019t grow, that\u2019s what she used\nto say, because she was strong in her hand. And when I would go to school with her, she has,\nshe walks and I run, and I couldn\u2019t catch up with her. \u201cSo, how could you tell me that she is sick\nand I am well?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d my mother said, \u201cOh, I see you have already brains.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d She\nsays to me, \u201cHow many fingers do you have?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Everybody\nhas ten fingers.\u201d So, she said, \u201cIf you hurt one, if you cut one, does it hurt you?\u201d I said, \u201cOf\ncourse, what kind of talk is that?\u201d That\u2019s when she sat me down on her lap and she explained it\ntome. \u201cI love you all the same, but she happen to be sick, that\u2019s why she gets everything. I\ndon\u2019t want to upset her.\u201d So, again, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. How could you do that to me?\u201d\n4\nSo, she said, \u201cWatch.\u201d She had, what do you... now it\u2019s going to come back to me. I\u2019m getting\nall excited. Epilepsy.",
        "A: And most of these things happened during the night and I never saw it. So when she told me\nthat, I trusted her, my mom. But I... still I had to see it for myself, that kind of child was I. And\nsure enough when the light came up and I used to see everybody running to her bed and foam\ncame out of her mouth. And from then on, you couldn\u2019t do nothing to her, she was the best\nsister. She couldn\u2019t be wrong in any place. I looked into her eyes. This all I have to thank my\nmom, that she explained it to me properly, because otherwise I would grow up hating her, how\nshe dared do that to me. That kind of mom we had, very smart and outgoing in every way.",
        "A: Shayna. She was the third one and I was under her. And...",
        "A: My interest? To go school. And that\u2019s what it was. I didn\u2019t have any other ambitions, but to go\nto school at that point, because I had older sisters to care for. You know what I\u2019m saying? We\ndidn\u2019t jump to any conclusions ahead. That\u2019s the way we were raised. My oldest sister got\nmarried. And she had two children. The other sister got married in the ghetto. And my\nbrothers, my brother got married in the ghetto. And they all had children in the ghetto. And\nthat\u2019s what it... 1t was kind of hard on us. And my sick sister, she too got married in the ghetto\nand she had a baby.",

        "A: Right. Uh huh, right.",
        "A: Oh yeah, we lost everything, yes. Yes, at that time. Short time after we went into ghetto.",
        "A: Before the ghetto, I, it wasn\u2019t a long time, let\u2019s put it this way. We didn\u2019t feel the pinch in\nanything, because like I said before, my mother took care on everything. In the ghetto we felt\nthe pinch, yes, definitely, but not before.",
        "A: Oh sure, oh sure.",
        "A: The day, we heard planes coming back and forth and they threw bombs. We were right, not far\nfrom there. And we still thought that they were practicing. The Russians are practicing because\nwe didn\u2019t believe that this was the Germans already. A short time after, you saw already riding\non the motorcycles, you know, and coming into town and that\u2019s what it was. And that\u2019s when\nthe trouble started.",
        "A: What? The Germans?",
        "A: Of course, of course.",
        "A: I mean, thank God, we were lucky at that point, that nobody was missing from the family, but a\nlot of people didn\u2019t have their husbands already. They took them away, or their sons. They used\n6\nto pick them up from the street and, and take them out. But at that point, we were yet, the whole\nfamily was together yet, until the, the selection that they made. That they put us into the ghetto\nand I had to go out to get some food, because nobody else could. My brother wouldn\u2019t go out,\nhe was afraid. And so my father couldn\u2019t carry anything, so I used to take off the yellow star that\nwe wore. And I was blond. And I took it off and I went out through the... they had like a hole\nthey made. And I went underneath and I went to the Poles, the ones that used to do business\nwith my mother. And I used to buy from them potatoes. And I used to bring it in underneath\nthe... on the way back, the same way like I came out. And I did it quite often for the family,\nthey should have what to eat.",
        "A: Oh, money left, we had money from before. Yeah, money we already had.",
        "A: No, no, no. No, the money, at that point, they didn\u2019t take nothing. When we came into\nAuschwitz, that\u2019s when they took everything away. You hid it, you know, in certain places.\nYou know, you prepared yourself. But at that point we still had money.",
        "A: Yes. Like I said before, I was not of the ones that listened into everything. I had older ones than\nme, listening in, you know, but you followed whatever they, they told you. It was one bedroom\nthat we had in that... in the ghetto. And that\u2019s what everybody was together. But my sister, my\noldest sister and my... my oldest sister and my second sister, they were married already and they\nhad babies, so they couldn\u2019t go with us when we were hiding, because they were afraid that they\ngoing to give out. Because if the kids start crying, the SS will hear.",
        "A: This is the last time, before they, they made those selections, so we were in the ghetto.",

And that\u2019s exactly what happened. They\ntook... So we were separated. My mom went with the... with the younger ones, the ones that\nhad the babies. And my father went with the older, like me and my brother, that had no children.\n7",
        "A: You had no alternative. Now my oldest sister, she was married; she had two children. So she\nwent with her husband, but not too far. And my other sister was not with us already. And\nneither did my brother, because he was married. So, it was just the younger ones, that we were\nall together.",

        "A: It was a lot of things on my head. Let\u2019s put it this way, because I knew my father was sick and\nthey had to get certain things and I had to... I had to be the one to go out and get it. So, every\ntime you, one of you went out, you wasn\u2019t sure if you were going to come back, but I would\nnever say no. Never.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. Caregiver. Not God forbid that it was sick, bedridden. But as far as providing food, and\nI remember my sister was having a baby in ghetto. And at that point already, they wouldn\u2019t take\nno money, the doctors. So, I had to go get the doctor. My mother sent me, so I went, of course.\nAnd he came. And I had to be the one to, to stay with them in the room. They chased off my\nmom, everybody from the room and she was having the baby.\n8",
        "A: Shayna. That\u2019s the second one. Daniel\u2019, could you bring me a little water, please? And the\ntissues, please, if you don\u2019t mind.",
        "A: For just a few minutes.\n? J.L.\u2019s grandson, who was in the room for part of the interview.\n9\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: None of them. None of them, no. No. No. My brother, like I said, didn\u2019t go out, out of the\nghetto, you know. And of course neither did my father or my mom. The only one that I went\nout, and I used to bring in the provisions, whatever, whatever it was able to, mainly potatoes and\nflour. Sugar, my mother, she knew that something\u2019s coming up. So, the main doctors didn\u2019t\ntake, if you needed a doctor, money was no good, because they couldn\u2019t buy nothing for the\nmoney. The main thing was sugar and flour. And that\u2019s what she saved up a lot of it. So, she\npaid the doctor, when my sister was giving birth, that\u2019s what it took, 1s sugar and flour. And\nnone of them worked, no, no.",
        "A: Yes, it was, let\u2019s put it this way. I had no fear. I knew I had to do it, because I could not give it\nover to somebody else. It was my job and I did it very, very nice. I went out, like I said before, I\nwasn\u2019t sure if Ill ever get back, but that\u2019s it. You have to do what you have to do. And I was\nalways successful. I went in the same way and I came out the same way. And that\u2019s it. The\nfamily was happy and I was happy that I was able to do it.",
        "A: Not in the ghetto. I was fine. In the camps, yes, but not in the ghetto. In the ghetto I was fine. I\nwent in okay and I came out okay. And it\u2019s not like... my mother made meals and we ate and...\nthe best she knew how, I mean whatever she had left, you know? But we never felt hungry or\nanything like that.",
        "A: No, no really don\u2019t... we were, we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t... how do I say? We didn\u2019t mingle with\npeople, you know what I\u2019m saying? Because we were a close family, and we were mostly by\nourselves. But I knew that people were working for the Germans, but we didn\u2019t know how could\nthey do it! You understand what I\u2019m trying...? How could they do a thing like that? When I\ncame to the, when I came to the concentration camp, to Auschwitz, then I saw what was going\non. Up till then, I did not know. Like I said before, my father always used to say the Germans\nare educated. They wouldn\u2019t do things like that. The only thing they could do is to put you to\nwork. But not to hit or... or do certain things uncalled for. Those are vicious killers, that\u2019s it.",
        "A: No, I really don\u2019t remember that. I really don\u2019t remember.\n10",
        "A: Not too long, I would say. People remained after they took us away, of course. Maybe three\nmonths, or four months the most. That\u2019s all. And of course you couldn\u2019t take nothing with you,\nbecause you had to carry it. Just like a pillow case, that\u2019s where you put some, your belongings\ninto it. You went. Because they didn\u2019t give you enough time. So, you wrapped whatever you\ncould. And like I said before, I was not with my mother. I was with my father then and my two\nsisters, my older sister and my younger one. My, my younger brother and my older brother and\nthat\u2019s what happened.",
        "A: No, we just read a bit or, or were told. But I never witnessed anything like that, no, thank God.\nLike I said before, we were lucky at that point, yet. We were all together.",
        "A: Because they said, I mean they didn\u2019t say, but you heard rumors that\u2019s going be a selection, that\nthey\u2019re going to take people away from... from the ghetto. And they\u2019re going to ship them to\nAuschwitz. So everybody went in either to a basement or they built something underneath and\nthat\u2019s the way they\u2019re hiding. You took some water with you or some bread and that\u2019s what\nhappened. And you were sitting up and waiting that somebody should knock on the door or\nwhatever. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. We heard them walking upstairs, Germans with\nthe boots, and we were underneath. And from nowheres they found out. And they knocked on\nthe door and that\u2019s what happened. They took us out from there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, this was a different building across the street. Yeah, my mother and my sisters were in\nthe same building underneath.",
        "A: My father, my oldest sister, because her children were older, my father and my sister and her two\nolder children and my brother and me.",
        "A: Plus the children, yes. My... what did I want to say, I forgot. Yeah. And we got out and they\nput us on the trains. And... crowded. A lot of people. And we were riding, like I said before,\nmy father kept telling us, you see all the way, close to Auschwitz already.\n11",
        "A: In January, February, yes, when the snow was falling on us. And we were sitting. A lot of...\nthere was no room to go to the bathroom, you should excuse me, a lot of people made on\nthemselves. It was just like, cattle have a better, better look than we had. It was just unbearable.\nAnd my brother, the oldest brother jumped the train. He didn\u2019t want to come into Auschwitz and\nthey were standing there and shooting. So, I never heard from him, so I don\u2019t know if he got\nshot or he got killed afterwards. My father to the last minute still had good ideas, that they\u2019re not\ngoing to hurt us, they\u2019re going to put us to work. But it was not so. The minute we arrived to\nAuschwitz, we still saw people standing and digging ditches. And he said, \u201cWhat did I tell you\nchildren? They\u2019re more civilized than anything else. They\u2019re not going to do these things.\nThey\u2019re not going to kill.\u201d And as soon as the train stopped it became like a terrible wind. And\nthey separated us, the women this way and the men that way. Didn\u2019t see my father anymore.\nDidn\u2019t see my sister, she was next to me, but she wouldn\u2019t part with her children, so you pulled\nher out on this side. So, I ran out from my side and I went to see... to be with my sister. And the\nSS, they had canes. They took the cane and put around my neck and pulled me out. They pulled\nme back to that line. So, I ran again over to my sister. I think I was scared, I didn\u2019t know which\nway. I wanted to be with her. So he took me out for the second time and he opened up my head.\nHit me with the cane over the head and that was the end of it. I never saw them afterwards. So,\nwhen you come into Auschwitz, you had to get undressed and of course, I started to cry very\nmuch. I wanted to go to my sister. I didn\u2019t tell them what, what I was crying. And an SS\nwoman comes over to me and she says to me, \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d Disoriented.\nEverything... it was unbelievable what they could put people in. And she says to me, \u201cWhy are\nyou crying?\u201d So I said to her, \u201cI want to go back to my sister.\u201d And she said, \u201cYou are going to\nsee her tomorrow.\u201d She was a good one. And then another SS woman came over, said, \u201cWhy\nare you crying?\u201d I cried harder. I said, \u201cBecause I want to go to your sister... to my sister.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cYou'll never see her again.\u201d And since that point, I never cried again. Because first they,\nthey cut your hair, and then they tattooed, and my hand got swollen like this. And lonesome, you\nhave nobody. I was really transport from the same town, but they were no, not related to me.\nAnd I had nobody. And the following day when they took us to work, we saw the smoke coming\nout of the chimney and I put two and two together and I knew exactly what was going on, that\nthey not around anymore. That\u2019s exactly how it was.",
        "A: Oh surely, and I met a lot of them. Not from the first day when we got there, but they had\nanother transport and that\u2019s when I met a lot of people from Biatystok, yes. I knew them. I went\nto school with them. My mother knew their mothers. They were in business. And that\u2019s it, we\nstayed together. We tried to hold onto one another.",
        "A: We all knew the same things. You couldn\u2019t figure out anything. You couldn\u2019t escape as far as\nthis is concerned. You had to listen, and you had to be strong, and you had to help one another\nthe best you were able to. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. I was always helping and one day,\none morning... 1t was called the block, the place where you were staying. And every day\nsomebody else had to go to get coffee in the morning. And... two people, because it looked like\n12\na garbage barrel. With two and you had to carry. And that morning was my,\nmy turn to go to get the coffee in the morning. Had to go to the kitchen. And sure enough I\nwent and the other girl went and from nowhere a girl came along and she had a, a plate like a...\nyou know, like a... I don\u2019t know what, how to... like she used to get the soup there. You know?\nThey used to carry with you all the time. And she stopped the, the pot to get some coffee. And\nan SS woman saw her through the window. She came running out with the dog, and she poured\nthe hot coffee, boiling coffee on my leg. And the skin came off right away. And... and that\u2019s it,\nand there was nobody to talk to. Nobody to, nobody to complain. Because nobody would listen\nto you. They would gas you. So, after being three weeks like that, and without medication. I\nused to put on, they had like a little blanket to cover yourself, whatever it was. And I used to, I\nripped up a piece and I made like a, like a bandage. And it used to get stuck during the night and\nin the morning I used to take it off and I went to work like that. And couldn\u2019t go on no more.\nAnd I said, after three weeks, \u201cI can\u2019t go on no more to work. I cannot carry on.\u201d I said,\n\u2018\u201cWhatever\u2019s going happen, it\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019ll remain on the block.\u201d And you were not\nallowed to go to... to remain on the, on the block, because they would kill you. They would gas\nyou the same day. So, I went to work and we were digging ditches and they moved away from\nthere and I threw myself into the ditches and I figured Ill let me lay there. It\u2019s like a grave. Let\nme remain there. But somehow they walked away and I crept out and I went on Revier. The\nRevier meant, like a hospital. And they wouldn\u2019t accept no Jews, of course. So, I went in there\nand they accepted me. They asked me who did it. I said, \u201cI burned myself.\u201d I was not allowed\nto say that the SS woman did it to me. I says, \u201cI burned myself,\u201d and that\u2019s it. And they accepted\nme. You didn\u2019t get no help or medication or anything like that, but at least you had the rest.\nYou didn\u2019t have to get up six o\u2019clock in the morning and stand outside for Zahl Appell. They\nused to count everyone in the morning. And this took an hour if it rained or snowed, whatever,\nthey didn\u2019t care, because they were dressed. And so, I said to myself, at least I don\u2019t have to go\nthrough this. And that\u2019s the way I remained for two, three weeks, and then they had a big\nselection. And, and I don\u2019t know if you ever saw it, it\u2019s... the beds were like boards, you know\nwhat I\u2019m saying? Straight boards. And you were... it was down and up. It was two, two layers,\nthe boards. And I was upstairs. And they said everybody should go down because they had like\na selection.",
        "A: No, this was at the Revier. Revier means a hospital, that\u2019s what they used to call it. Yes. This\nwas at the Revier. And the SS came in and they said, \u201cEverybody come down from the bed.\nUsed to call it colliers (ph). And... and everybody should go down. I touched my next door girl\nand the other side and they were dead. They came from Greece and they couldn\u2019t... they\ncouldn\u2019t take the climate, because they were used to warm climate. And it, at that point it was\nnot warm in, in Auschwitz. It was winter time. And they just, they used to fly, lay, they fell like\nflies. They went to bed and they never got up. And I said to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d\nThis is all your head, you\u2019re talking to yourself. I don\u2019t stand a chance by going down, because\nyou had to take off whatever you wore and parade through them naked. And if they like the way\nyou looked, they put you one way and if they didn\u2019t, they gassed you. So, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going\nto give them satisfaction. I\u2019m not going down.\u201d And I remained like that on the bed. Somebody\ncarried on with you, you know, tell you not to do it. And the Doctor, Doctor Mengele was a very\ntall fellow. And he touched one, two, and here I was laying in the middle. And he didn\u2019t touch\n13\nme, because I was still warm. They could have taken me down and killed me. And I remained\nlike that, so this actually saved my life.",
        "A: Oh, you could tell. They announced it, too. They announced everything. You knew. Yeah, you\ncouldn\u2019t do nothing about it, but you knew. And then somehow, I, I don\u2019t remember it was from\nGreece or from a different country, that gave them a lot of... I think 1t was from Greece. And\nthey shouldn\u2019t gas. They stopped gassing for a while. And that\u2019s the way I remained on the...\non the Revier. And it saved me because I didn\u2019t have to get up in the morning, like I said before,\nto stand outside and wait for the Zahl Appell. And I got the same, how did we used to call it?\nSame amount of food that I would get when I worked outside. That piece of bread and that soup.\nAnd I was friendly with a girl, she was not far from Auschwitz, we were sleeping together and\neating together and between the two of us... she lives in England now. Between the two of us,\nwe had two slices of bread, so we were rich. So one slice we have to... we used to save it up for\nthe night meal and for the morning, we took along the other one to work. We never finished\nboth slices of bread. One we put away.",
        "A: Oh yes, she was all over. No. She was not... after. After. No, not in the Revier. She was not\nwith me in the Revier.",
        "A: Halina.",
        "A: Oh, what was her last name? I know, I have to take a look in the book, because... She lives in\nEngland.",
        "A: Yeah, I have to take a look in the book, so. You want it now, shall I take a look?",
        "A: Halina Lichtenstein.",
        "A: Ask me a question.\n14",
        "A: Outside, outside, yes, we used to go from the Zah/ Appell from in the morning, they used to take\nyou to work by groups. I don\u2019t know how many people they needed that day. So, like they\ncounted off thirty, forty, sixty, whatever they needed, and we marched. We followed them and\nwhatever they said to do, that\u2019s what you had to do that day. A lot of times they brought back a\nlot of girls, back dead ones, because they didn\u2019t like the way they looked, or for no reason at all.\nAnd they brought them back on... on two pieces of wood, actually. And that\u2019s they put them\nback, because they had to account, each and everyone they took out from the gate, to bring the\nsame amount back, even if dead. But they had to bring you back. And that\u2019s what happened.",
        "A: Oh sure. Twenty-one was the, from there they used to take you to gas. But this must have been\nfour or five.",
        "A: In Birkenau and then we went to Auschwitz. From Birkenau it was a terrible place. First of all\nwhen I arrived there we didn\u2019t have no water yet. We had a lot of mud and I lost a shoe. If you\nput your foot in, you couldn\u2019t take it out, you had to leave the shoe. And it was horrible. It was\nnot to be believed that you could do that to people. And mostly young people, because they\nnever chose elderly, because they didn\u2019t, they only needed you to work. And the elderly, of\ncourse, didn\u2019t have no strength, so they gassed them right away. But the younger ones, they... as\nlong as they needed you, they used you and then after that they killed you. And that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Oh sure, I remember the Kapos very well, yes.",
        "A: I had very bad experience with them. Like I said, we were in Birkenau and the first thing in the\nmorning, after they, of course, cut my hair, put the number on and did everything else what they\nhad to, separated us, of course, from the loved ones. And six o\u2019clock in the morning or five\no\u2019clock in the morning, these four people from Czechoslovakia, they came before us. And they\nwere real meanies. Mean. They had nothing nice about them. And the first thing out of their\nmouth at six o\u2019clock in the morning was \u201cPolska koovi stavach (ph).\u201d I... 1, the first time in my\nlife, by that point, I heard. It meant, to explain it, \u201cPolish whores, get up.\u201d And I was so\nbewildered with that saying, because I didn\u2019t know even what a whore meant at that point. And\nthat was my first greeting with the Kapos. And from then on, like I said, there was nobody that\ntold you, but you figured out already what\u2019s going on and, and that\u2019s it. You cannot go under\ntheir nails, you cannot ask for anything, because you\u2019re not going to get it and you have to obey.\nYou have to leave at a certain time your room and then that\u2019s it. You couldn\u2019t stay there. To\nremain on the bed? Never, because they would gas you right away. And like I said, luck was\nwith me, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s luck, or... I always said, that through my life, through my stories I\nalways feel that somebody carries on with you. Or whatever it happens in life, that somebody\n15\ncarries on with you. It\u2019s God will. I shouldn\u2019t have gotten off the bed. Had I gotten off the bed,\nthey would have taken me immediately. But like I said, my brain told me, you\u2019ll never make it.\nAnd don\u2019t get undressed and don\u2019t go through him. And I remained. And like I said before, I\nwas in the Revier after a few weeks. And of course they didn\u2019t treat me, but at least I had the\nchance to... not to go outside. And then I got a better job. So the woman that took care on me,\nshe was a Polish woman\u2014not took care, but she spoke to me, let\u2019s put it this way\u2014on the\nRevier, was a very nice person. So one day I approached her after being there maybe three or\nfour months. So I, I asked her if... she used to come in the morning, she was wearing a white\ncoat. And she was clean and she had a short hair cut. She was really pretty woman.",
        "A: She was a Polish... Magda, I think it was. And I, I approached her one morning. And I said to\nher, \u201cWhat do you do with the water after you finish washing yourself?\u201d And she looked at me.\nShe says, \u201cWhy? Do you want to drink it?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, who drinks dirty water?\u201d I said, \u201cI\nwant to wash myself around the way you do. I want to be clean. I want to look good like you\ndo.\u201d So, something went into her head and she, every day that she came in, in the morning, she\nbrought me a, you know, a basin, a small basin with water with the soap and the dirt and\neverything when she washed herself. And I used to wash myself around. And I felt so good, like\na million dollars. So I said to myself, how could I help the woman? I had no money. I can\u2019t\ngive her no money. I can\u2019t give her nothing that I have of me. What could I do? I said, okay,\nI\u2019m going to help her to clean out. She was cleaning out under the beds, the walk. And I said, I\nhave to help her. Before she gets here, I\u2019m going to do it and when she comes she won\u2019t have so\nmuch work. So, I told her. But when I went down, I could, I fainted from laying so long on the\nbed. That I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t do. So I got up, and somebody helped me to go back on the bed.\nWhen she came in that day, I told her what happened. She says, \u201cIf you want to live, you must\nget off that bed.\u201d I said, \u201cSure I want to live.\u201d So, she said, \u201cBut let\u2019s do it...\u201d\u201d\" excuse me. \u201cYou\nstart doing it before the SS comes 1n, before they change.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know what time it was,\nfour or five o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t know. So I climbed down again from the bed and I was able to stand\nfor a minute. So this was really a big accomplishment. And I took a chair and I pushed it. And I\nwas walking, like jumping, I couldn\u2019t put down yet the foot all the way on the bottom, on the\nfloor like. But every day I tried, until I got stronger.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n16\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: About cleaning for that woman. And she appreciated it very, very much. And she thought it was\nvery clever of me to do a thing like that. And she used to give me an extra piece of bread. And\nat that point, she told me that I cannot remain on the bed. I have to get off and they were, they\nwere trying out... there was a period of time that they didn\u2019t gas. They got a lot of money. I\nthink it was from Turkey or I can\u2019t remember exactly from where it was. And this was to, to\nhold off the, the selections. And she said they were trying, they were looking for, for nurses.\nThat pretty soon they were going to ask who wants to become a nurse. So, she said to me, \u201cI\nwould advise you to volunteer for that.\u201d So, that\u2019s exactly what I did. I volunteered and I was\ntransferred from this into a different, a better place, not too far from one another. And I didn\u2019t\nget as a nurse, but I got as... when the new arrivals came on, when they took off their clothes,\nthe personal things you had to leave there too, everything. And you had to go through to look for\ndiamonds, or for money people used to sew in their clothes. And that\u2019s what was my job.",
        "A: Oh yeah, that\u2019s right. You know that. Yes, yes, Canada, yes, right, right, right. So that\u2019s where\nI worked. And of course the SS stood right by and there was big boxes like, how do you... like\npiggy banks, but of course it was not a piggy bank, but it was a, big boxes with locks on top.\nAnd they used to... had to put in all the, whatever you got, put it right in there. And this was my\njob. And then you had to bring in the clothes to the zone or whatever they call it. It\u2019s like a, they\nused to... like cleaners, they used to clean the clothes. They went through the heat, and that\u2019s\nwhat... I don\u2019t know what they did with it afterwards, but that\u2019s what it was. And that\u2019s what I\nwas working for. And this helped me, too, not to get outside with my leg. And of course, it\nhealed by now, but I... 1t left me a terrible scar. It... it grew like wild flesh on it, but I was\nhappy that I could walk on it. And that\u2019s what it was. When I came out of there, when people\nsaw me that they knew me, they didn\u2019t believe that I\u2019m alive, because months I was not with\nthem.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go to that barrack because I was in a different place already. And... but it was a\nbetter place, because there, like I said before, you didn\u2019t have to stand outside in... for the Zah/\nAppell. They knew exactly where we are and where we\u2019re working and that\u2019s what it happened.",
        "A: No, no more in the morning, no more Zah/l Appells, no. You didn\u2019t have... they didn\u2019t have to\ncount you already, because they knew there were so many people, so many people are working\nthere and that\u2019s what it was. My luck that I had the job.\n17",
        "A: Halina?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s where I met her. Halina Lichtenstein, yes, we became very good friends, like sisters.\nAnd like I was telling you before, we never finished the bread and everybody used to be envious.\nHow could we do it? I says, that\u2019s exactly what happened. We\u2019re not vultures. We thought\ntomorrow, we\u2019re going to live maybe till tomorrow, so we\u2019ll have the bread for tomorrow. A lot\nof people didn\u2019t do that. They... whatever they gave them, who knows if they\u20191l make it to\ntomorrow? In the meantime, they ate it up. And I never cut my bread. I always gave her, she\nshould do it. Because thinking, God forbid, maybe I\u2019m taking a bigger slice for myself. Would\nnever do that. That was in my mind. That\u2019s the way I was raised. And we were wonderful, we\nwere just like family.",
        "A: No, she was from Bendin (ph), that\u2019s near Auschwitz, not too far from Auschwitz. So she was\nfrom around there, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It has to do... I never changed as far as helping people. All my life I suffered for\nthat. I never changed. I think it has to do with the upbringing, to do, be good, to help. Even\nnow, all my life I\u2019ve been like that, after the war too. If somebody... My mother was that way.\nIf somebody needed a donation, or to marry off a child and they had no money, my mother was\nalways there helping. She knew already the people, and they always gave her and she always put\nit in anonymous, not to know or to thank you what you did. This is a wonderful thing. And I do\nit the same way. All my life I\u2019ve been doing it. I got... my hair was cut off, but later on towards\nthe end, they allowed you a little hair to grow. And when the transfers from Bialystok came, and\nlike I said before, I had a good job already and I was trying to help. And they told me that the\nblock elteste (ph), in other words, this was the one that was watching them, the Kapo, she wanted\na doll. Like I said before, we were working, we were working with the clothes and, and so I told\nsomebody else, if they came along, you find a doll, put 1t away. Hide it. I took the doll and I\nthrew it over the, the fence. And they caught me. And they pulled me out. And they cut my\nhair, again, because at that point already we had, you know, they let you have a little hair\nalready. And of course, when they take the hair off, they take all the beauty away, especially to a\nwoman. And they put me on a, on a pail in the middle of everybody, like at Zah/ Appell, and\nthey gave me sixteen, uh, with a belt.",
        "A: Lashes. And that\u2019s it, you couldn\u2019t cry, and you couldn\u2019t say anything. And that\u2019s that. You\nwere guilty. You took it and that\u2019s what it was. So you would think I forgot already? No. Then\n18\nsomebody else needed something else, but that\u2019s the way Iam. I can\u2019t help myself, always good\nto people. I always shared.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t injured. No, I was not injured, but I was ashamed. The shame was there, but not the\ninjury. It hurt for a bit, the backside hurt, of course, but not ashamed. I was ashamed rather than\npain, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "A: No, I knew I could never make it. No, no, no. I was just like a lamb. I was following whatever\nthey said. I helped people, yes. I have a friend, that I saved her. She lives in Brooklyn yet.\nCalled me last week. Sonja Rotenberg (ph) is her name. She had malaria, and there was a\nselection going through. And she, and I was working that time. She said to me, \u201cJustine, Jospe,\nJospele, help me, help me, help me.\u201d So I took a beet, and I rubbed her cheeks, and I put her on\na clean nightgown. And instead of going through this way and shaking, I put a mattress under\nher, she could quiet down. And instead of going this way, she went that way. And all her life...\nshe\u2019s in Brooklyn. And always, forever, said, \u201cShe was the one that saved my life. She was the\none that saved my life.\u2019 And I always did things that seemed possible, let\u2019s put it this way, just to\nhelp out somebody. But that\u2019s my nature, I can\u2019t help it.",
        "A: I remember a lot... you couldn\u2019t talk while you were working. I\u2019m talking about already after\nthe war we were together in France.",
        "A: Here and there a word, but you couldn\u2019t make the conversation, because they were watching and\nnobody wanted we should get hurt. You know what I\u2019m saying? So if it was important you said\none word, but otherwise you wouldn\u2019t talk. You couldn\u2019t have a conversation, especially when\nthey were standing and watching you. Uh uh.",
        "A: Every day. There was no Sabbath, no Sunday, no, every day you worked.",
        "A: From morning until, they had to bring you back at a certain time, five or six o\u2019clock, depends the\ntime of the year. If the day was longer, you worked longer. If the day was getting dark, you had\nto return back.\n19",
        "A: Not at this point. Not from the beginning, you had no hope. Later on you started to have hope.\nBut not from that point.",
        "A: You didn\u2019t have to get news. First of all, they were evacuating us from Auschwitz, because the\nRussians came close and they did not... the Germans did not want to fall into the Russian hands.\nSo, they evacuated us to Ravensbriick. Ravensbriick was another camp, but it was not as bad as\nAuschwitz. They didn\u2019t have the gassing chambers. It was just a concentration camp and there I\ngot a job in the kitchen. And I was dishing out food and everybody came over, \u201cJospele, Jospele,\ngive me some food.\u201d Just pour it in. You know, because I, it was not mine to begin with, and\nthey were hungry. So I always did that. In that respect I was lucky, I always got good jobs. And\nthen from Ravensbrick they transferred us to Switau. That\u2019s where we were liberated. And\nthere, I was already there with nine, nine girls. All of us were Jewish girls. And somehow, like I\nsaid before, this was not a concentration camp. They couldn\u2019t gas you there. It was just\nworking, a camp, a concentration, but without the, without the, what do you call that? The gas\nchambers. So, now we were there nine girls and there were a lot of Polish women that were\nfrom Auschwitz. And they exactly knew that we are Jews. So, one day we spoke among\nourselves and we decided that we\u2019re not going to go in, all of us, together to wash in the\nmorning, because we didn\u2019t want to be with anybody that should identify us. So, we ran in and\nwe washed ourselves, like three of them and three stood outside. And that\u2019s the way we made it\nup. Sure enough, one day all of the Polish, and they were even anti-Semites. They were very\nmean. It\u2019s not that we took anything away, but they had to squeal, they had to tell that we are\nnot, that we are not gentiles, we are Jews. And sure enough, one day they found out. And they\nwent and they squealed. And they called us all out. These, these, these, you know, the numbers\nthey called and we had to go in the front. And they said to us, \u201cAre you Jewish? Are you\nJews?\u201d We said, \u201cNo.\u201d We made it up before, because we felt that it\u2019s the end. That was what\nit was trying to come. We heard the, you know, that\u2019s a battlefield going on. We heard the\nshooting. We heard the cannonen (ph), they used to call it, the... everything, but we didn\u2019t know\nexactly when it\u2019s going to be the end. We knew it\u2019s nearby. So, that\u2019s the way we made up, that\nwe... each one was going to say, \u201cMy mother was Jewish, my father was a gentile.\u201d The other\none said, \u201cMy father was gentile, my mother was Jewish.\u201d You know, all of us denying. And\nthey looked, and they looked, and they looked and thank God, they didn\u2019t kill us. But... and\nthen from there we went to Switau. This was the last camp.",
        "A: Hmm. I\u2019m making it already finished. (Laughter.)",
        "A: You got to go?\n20\nDaniel Lerner (Justine\u2019s grandson): Yeah.",
        "A: We left, they put us back on buses, open buses. And I remember like now it was snowing. And\nwe all climbed up on the buses. And they were taking us... we didn\u2019t know where, but we got to\nRavensbruck.",
        "A: \u201845, right. We stayed in Ravensbrick not too long, maybe six months. And from there we went\nto last one, Switau, the Czechs. And that was, that\u2019s where we were liberated from.",
        "A: No, no. Some of them from the beginning, they took them by foot. We went by train, by bus.\nYeah, they loaded us up on the buses and we traveled by bus, because it was a few selections\nfrom Auschwitz, two or three, because a lot of them went by foot and they ran away from there.\nThat my friend\u2019s... her husband did that. He escaped, because he knew the area. It was, Bendin\nwas not too far from Auschwitz. And he knew exactly the area, the woods, and that\u2019s where he\nescaped to.",
        "A: That\u2019s my friend\u2019s husband. Halina, the one that is England now, her husband did that.",
        "A: She was married before the war, right. Right. She was a little older than I was. She was married\nbefore the war. And that\u2019s what her husband escaped into the woods, because they knew the\narea very well.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember. She had to be together, because we were on the last\none. We were in Switau together.",
        "A: In Ravensbrick together, too, yeah. So we were there together, right.\n21",
        "A: It was not a bus like a bus. It was like a truck, you know. The journey was terrible, because it\nwas like unknown, you didn\u2019t know where you were going. And that\u2019s all I could remember\nactually from that.",
        "A: Open, open like cattle, you know, like an open big bus. A truck better than a bus. A truck I\nwould say, an open truck, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: All women. There was no men down there, all women. Different blocks had men, but no, we\nwere all women.",
        "A: The only thing I could remember 1s like I said, they burned my leg and when they cut my hair\noff. And they hit me. Otherwise, oh sure when I came out of the Revier, out of the hospital,\npeople didn\u2019t want to believe that I\u2019m alive, because they, they didn\u2019t see me for months. So,\nthis was a shock to a lot of them, even my cousin, but we stayed together. And nothing else, I\nmean I witnessed a lot, but nothing else that I could really say, that unusual, you know what I\u2019m\nsaying? Everybody else there lived the same thing.",
        "A: Yes, yes. The only two, my mother and her mother were sisters and she came with the second\ntransport, but she was ten years younger than I was. She was, I think, the youngest thing in\nAuschwitz. She passed away three years ago. She had a heart attack.",
        "A: Her name was Leah Weitzenfeld (ph), and she was married in New York.",
        "A: Weitzenfeld was her maiden name, yes, Leah Weitzenfeld, yes. And she has two children, a son,\nwho\u2019s a pharmacist and he married a pharmacist. And we are in touch. They live in Brooklyn,\nyeah.\n22",
        "A: No, no. When the second transport came, or the third one it would have to be, they said that they\nsaw my mother coming into Auschwitz. The people from Biatystok, interviewed them. And\nthey said... and that\u2019s when I got hit, when they wanted a doll for the Block elteste (ph), for the\nKapo. And that\u2019s when I tried to organize and give it to her. And that\u2019s what happened. And\nthat\u2019s when they said, in that transport my mother was, but I did not see her. I did not see\nanybody, no. That was last time. When I met them at, when we arrived in Auschwitz, I never\nsaw them again. Always hoping, always searching, always looking, but of course, nothing.\nWhen I was in Paris, we lived in Paris for a year, after the war, of course. And I was always\ngoing on the trains, looking. In Europe the trains are much better than... you never saw a train,\ndid you? Oh, in Washington they have beautiful trains. Here, because it was riding in\nWashington on the train. But by us in New York, the trains were horrible. And I always used to\nrun from train to train. That\u2019s what I did in Paris, looking, the searching. From the back, look\nlike my sister, from the back look like my brother. Always thinking, looking into their eyes, but\nof course, it was not them. But I always thought, yes, yes, I\u2019m going to find somebody. But\nthat\u2019s it.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I always felt, this I told my friends in Paris also, that this was my mother\u2019s and my father\u2019s last\nwish, that somebody has to remain from the family and carry on. And I was the one to survive\nand that\u2019s what I have to do. I have to build back what we lost. That\u2019s the way I lived after the\nwar. But of course, it\u2019s just like a, like a made up story, but it\u2019s, this helped me a lot in my life.\nLike I\u2019m not doing it, but somebody else tells me to do it.",
        "A: That\u2019s what kept me going. My friend told me that, too. Halina, the one from England. There\nwas a time in my life when I was in Paris, I\u2019m going way ahead. This was after the war and we\nwere liberated. And the Americans liberated us. And each of us from the nine girls that there\nwere, had family in the United States. I had an uncle. This one had a sister and this one had in\nSouth America. Every one of us had family and they advised us that we shouldn\u2019t go back to\nPoland. They asked us, what do we want to do. And we said, we want to go to Poland to look\nfor the family. And they advised us not to go back to Poland, because at that point already\neverything was shared up already, what belongs to whom. Poland belonged to Russia already.\nAnd they told us not to go, because we\u2019ll never get out of there. So, the only thing they advised,\n23\nadvised us, excuse me, is we should go back to Paris. Excuse me. So, the Americans, the ones\nthat liberated, advised us not to go back to Paris, uh, not to go back to Poland. We should go to\nParis, from there the organizations will take over and we\u2019ll find our family and then we\u2019ll be able\nto get to them. So that\u2019s exactly what happened. They gave us a paper and they put us on,\nbecause we had no clothes. So, they gave us a paper, and they gave us uniforms that the WACs\nwore and they put us on the train. And we were going to Paris from Switau, from the Czechs, we\nwere going to Paris. And on the way they took us off the train one stop and they said that we\nshouldn\u2019t talk to them, we should just give them the paper. And sure enough on the, the next\nstop they put us back on and we came to Paris. And there Rothschild gave us, it was a hotel.\nAnd they gave us the hotel for the misplaced people. And that\u2019s what it was. We slept two ina\nroom and downstairs was a kitchen. So, and we used to be able to come down and eat. Now, I\ndon\u2019t remember how long I was there, but I just couldn\u2019t go down with a dish again and eat. So,\nI cried so much. But it was more tears in the dish than it was food. And I decide I\u2019m going to\ncook for myself. And each floor, they had like a two burner. So, that\u2019s what happened. I bought\nsome potatoes and that\u2019s what I used to cook. But of course, there was like a line. You know,\nyou had to wait quite a while, but it was for me better not to go downstairs, but to cook and eat\nfor myself. And so, that\u2019s where I got in with my friend. I slept with Halina, with my girlfriend.\nMy cousin and another friend was in the other room. We were... we had nine rooms, one after\nthe other. And at one point practically everybody found their family already and they were\nleaving. And of course, me, I didn\u2019t find my family, didn\u2019t find my uncle. And the only thing 1s,\nI said to myself and I said to them too, either he\u2019s very rich, he doesn\u2019t want to identify himself,\nor he died, one of the two, so many years. So...",
        "A: We skipped too much.",
        "A: We need to go back, yes.",
        "A: Where we stopped...",
        "A: Yes, in Paris.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Ravensbrick, right.",
        "A: The sleeping conditions were practically the same, but the only thing is, there we already had\nwater. You could wash yourself whenever you wanted. And of course the food was the same,\nbut we didn\u2019t have the...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n25\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: Ravensbrick, yeah. And we didn\u2019t have it on our heads that there is gas chamber. So you were\na little bit more at ease than you were in Auschwitz. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the only\nthing.",
        "A: My cousin, I don\u2019t remember her being in Ravensbriick, because I think we were not. In\nAuschwitz we were together. And then after the war, in the last one we were together. In the\nlast one we were, but Ravensbrtick, I don\u2019t remember if she was with me.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. It had to be a few hours, maybe five or six hours for sure.",
        "A: Only from, because you were talking among yourself. I mean, here and there somebody passed\nby and they heard a radio. So this came the news, but otherwise we were not allowed to have\nany, any news. But like I said, you heard, heard the guns, I mean you had to be deaf not to hear\nit, because it was nearby. But of course, we did not know when we were going to be liberated.\nWe knew it was close, but how close we did not know. Because at one point like we used to\nhear \u201croooh, roooh\u201d all night long and then all of a sudden it got quiet. So we figured it out,\ngeniuses, that they pushed them back. You know what I\u2019m saying? And then again, and then\nagain it was too quiet. But we knew that the end is near, but we didn\u2019t know how near it was.",
        "A: Always the kitchen. I love the kitchen. (Laughing.) I... how did it happen? By luck, like I said\nbefore, nothing unusual, just picked, you know. And that\u2019s it. And like I said before, everybody\nput in their, their thing and took out some food and of course, I didn\u2019t stop them. And that\u2019s it.\nAnd that\u2019s what people appreciated. Always was there for the undertaker, I always let them do.",
        "A: I always had belief that they would. I always believed that they would. I had very dear friends\nand that\u2019s what actually helped me in actual life, because family we didn\u2019t have. And we were\nlike sisters and brothers. When you first came to the, to the United States and prior to that, we\nwere looking for one another and when we found each other it was like, like you found\nsomebody from the family. And don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s over fifty years and we still, the ones that are\nalive, we are very, very close. There is no week that I shouldn\u2019t speak to them. And helping in\n26\nevery way that we could, if God forbid somebody\u2019s sick. When it happened to me, only my\nfriend from concentration camp helped me.",
        "A: Yes, when I was attacked and left in the house. So, I was all alone. My husband had passed\naway and my tenant moved out that day, the one that lived upstairs. And there was nobody,\nnobody. And that day I was supposed to go to a funeral, also from, one from concentration\ncamp. She lost her son of cancer, young fellow. And I was going to go to the funeral. And I\nhad a ride. She didn\u2019t live too far from me, a few blocks. And when I came down on the block\nthey told that they just left. They didn\u2019t wait for me. I was very disappointed and hurt, and\nunbelievable, how could you not wait? I don\u2019t know if up to today, if they forgot or they just\ndidn\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know. Because right after this it happened. And I never... I don\u2019t know\nthem so well. But being she lives on the block, I was going to go with their neighbor, which they\nwere also survivors of the Holocaust. But like I said, I didn\u2019t know them so close. So I really\ndon\u2019t know if they did it deliberately or if they forgot, because I never was able to discuss it with\nthem. So, when I came there on the block and it was very short for me, maybe two blocks. So\nthe neighbor said to me, \u201cWhom you looking for?\u201d So, I told her. She said, \u201cThey just left.\nEverybody left.\u201d So, I came home and I got undressed. This was on a Friday, and started to\nprepare for dinner. And I opened up the window. And the, I had a, a, you know, what they call\nthat? For the air to come through. Like a shade or whatever it\u2019s called. And not thinking, not\nthinking, that God forbid somebody\u2019s going to climb in through that, open up the window and\nget in. And he hit me in the head, cut my face. I don\u2019t know, he broke my arms, they were\nhanging, both of them. He did something terrible. And my friend... me and his wife, she passed\naway, we were the best of friends from concentration camp. I\u2019m now friends with her daughters,\nalways was. They live in New York... he knew that I was supposed to go to the funeral. He\ndidn\u2019t go. And he kept calling. Called in the evening and no answer. So he couldn\u2019t figure it\nout what\u2019s going on. Then he thought maybe I went to, the woman that lost her son, to their\ndaughter, to stay with them, help out. So, Sunday he came along to the house and I lived on the\ncorner. And he walked around, parked the car and he walked around this way. \u201cJustine, Justine,\nwhere are you?\u201d And I don\u2019t know from what and when. I yelled out, \u201cHere Iam. Save me,\nhelp me.\u201d And that\u2019s when he heard my voice. Across the street was sitting women, neighbors.\nSo they, he asked the neighbors, \u201cDid you see Justine?\u201d And she said \u201cNo, but I\u2019m wondering,\nthe light is on. She never used to leave the light on. The light is on and I haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d So,\nwhen he heard that, he ran over to them and they climbed through the window, the kitchen\nwindow, because I had a porch, like a terrace like this, but higher. And they went in, one of\nthem went in through the window and they found me laying on the floor in my bedroom in a\npuddle of blood. And that\u2019s when they called the police. And the police called an ambulance\nand that\u2019s why they put me into a hospital, a trauma hospital. And they called my son and that\u2019s\nwhat happened.",
        "A: Twenty-four hours.\n27",
        "A: Twenty-four hours, from Friday, I don\u2019t know what time Friday. But from Friday till Sunday. It\nhad to be Friday maybe twelve or one o\u2019clock in the afternoon. And that\u2019s what happened.",
        "A: No, no, we didn\u2019t find it so bad. It was like a paradise away from Auschwitz in Ravensbriick. It\nwas much better, much better, different people, different looks. And like I said before, the gas\nchambers were not on top of our heads, on top of it. And we had experience already. We were\nabout already a few years. So, it was much easier than Auschwitz.",
        "A: Like we were... I don\u2019t know. We never complained about the food. Never. We never. You,\nyou didn\u2019t have the room to complain, but I think it was much better than in Auschwitz.\nAuschwitz was the worst.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t, maybe five months at most, I think.",
        "A: They used to take people to different camps, so that\u2019s where they took us to Switzerland. Uh, to\nSwitau. That\u2019s in the Czechs, Czechoslovakia, yes, that\u2019s where it was.",
        "A: It was a camp, yeah, but they did not have, like I said before, they did not have the gas chambers\nthere. Just working camp, you know? But no, no gas chambers, no smoke coming out from the\nroof.",
        "A: Nine, we were nine girls.",
        "A: Only nine girls. No, I mean the Jewish girls. We stayed together, we were only nine. There was\na lot of them coming from Ravensbriick to Switau, but we stayed together. We were, like I said\nbefore, the only nine Jewish girls, Jewish girls that were there.\n28",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. We stuck together a long time, yes, yes.",
        "A: Mostly of them. Mostly, but maybe there were a lot of Jews too, that we didn\u2019t know. You\nknow what I\u2019m saying? But we stayed together. Yeah. Everybody had somebody that, you\nknow, was holding onto somebody. And that\u2019s exactly what it was.",
        "A: The same thing like we did in Auschwitz, nothing worked that you could say that you worked at\na machine, you did something, something that you learned a trade or anything... nothing like\nthat. We just were working and digging and that\u2019s it. And first, one day you digged and the\nsecond day you covered it. It\u2019s... that was the work, labor, that was nothing special that you did.",
        "A: In the dark about everything. No. You didn\u2019t have a radio, you didn\u2019t have nothing. You only\ndepended on the, on the people that heard news. If you passed by, you heard a radio, so you\nlistened in on a word or two. That\u2019s what you....but you didn\u2019t have no first class news. No,\nyou did not know.",
        "A: The same thing like in Ravensbrick, this was the same thing. It was a little more scary like I\nsaid because they pulled us out, you know, and we had to tell them. But otherwise it was the\nsame conditions.",
        "A: You had more bedrooms maybe. It was a little more elaborate than Auschwitz. You had the\nwater, you had to go to the bathrooms. So this was... when we first came to Auschwitz, we\ndidn\u2019t have that.",
        "A: In Switau, yes, you were able to do that.",
        "A: Every day, yes, yes, you could clean yourself, yes. They had a big washroom maybe three times\nas big as that room, for the ladies, for the women to go into. So they had a basin and they had\nsoap. You could wash yourself around, yes. Yeah, it meant a lot. Because, well, you liked to\nstay clean, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, 1t means a lot to you.\n29",
        "A: Yes, all women. There was no men there. There was no men there.",
        "A: Oh, thousands, I\u2019m sure. Thousands, I\u2019m sure. But it was not comparing to Auschwitz. No.\nNone of them could you compare to Auschwitz. Mm-mm. The men\u2019s camps some of them you\ncould compare, like Dachau or another one, say you could compare to Auschwitz. But\nAuschwitz was the worst.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, they did not know. But the Poles, of course, they find out and they... they didn\u2019t know what\nit means, the triangle. Because the Jews had a triangle by the number. And they knew it. And\nbecause no matter discreet you could be, but they were always on top of you. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. And they were very mean. I mean, what did it hurt them that somebody else should\nremain alive? But that\u2019s in their upbringing, hate, hate, hate. And that\u2019s the way they have to\nlive with them for the rest of their lives.",
        "A: The Poles, everybody knows that they are very anti-Semite. They had no love for us and I had\nno love for them. I had love for the ones that my mother used to do business with, but they\nchanged too, during the war. They did. When I asked for something else like this, \u201cWe don\u2019t\nhave it, we don\u2019t have it.\u201d They did not go out of their way to help. But yes, a lot of them, I\nheard from stories, my friend for instance, that the people used to leave the children, like infants\na few months old. And they wanted to place them in a home in... by Poles, when they knew,\nthey gave the money for keeping. And the children never returned back to the... I mean the\nparents didn\u2019t survive, but the kids never returned back to their home, they remained Catholics,\nthe way they raised them.",
        "A: A sense of what?\n30",
        "A: I would say that I had. I always believed that somebody above carries on with you. Whatever\nhappens in your life, somebody\u2019s there to, to help you. Yeah, faith means a big thing to me, yes.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t say that I became more pious, you know, more, but I would say I\u2019m on the same level\nlike I was. A lot of people made fun out of me, too. Some of them turned out to have no religion\nat all. I always believed. I always kept a kosher home, when I was there. After the war, up till\ntoday, I wouldn\u2019t mix certain foods, like we are not allowed to have cheese and meat. I would...\nI wouldn\u2019t touch that. It goes against me. I was raised that way. I was brought up that way.\nAnd that\u2019s the way I tried to keep it. Now I have my different town. It\u2019s very hard to get certain\nfoods. So I used to have separate dishes all my life. I used to conduct myself very, very nice,\ndidn\u2019t mix up anything. Now, I don\u2019t do that. To be honest, I don\u2019t do that. But I will not, still\nnot eat the meat and the dairy together. Goes against me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: For having faith.",
        "A: No. No, out of camps. When we were... after the war I\u2019m talking. In the camp, no, no. After\nthe war. And those were all, we were all among our own, but some of them, like I said before,\nlost their faith completely and some of them didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Not fun exactly, it\u2019s fun... because... \u201cOh, stop being stupid,\u201d or things like that. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t\nmean a thing.\u201d You know what I\u2019m saying? They had no religion in them at all. I couldn\u2019t do\nthat. I like to go to the Temple when a holiday came along or anything that came up. I felt that\u2019s\nmy place. Even my husband was not a believer and he came out from a very pious family. But\nhe saw what\u2019s happening, he lost it completely. But I was different, I was holding onto this.",
        "A: We were hiding that we are Jewish. And we were hiding and not telling the truth, that\u2019s what it\nwas. A day or two later they took us out from the Zah/ Appell, there where you stood there to be\ncounted. And they called out all the numbers. I don\u2019t know how they knew the numbers. They\nmust have pointed it out, days. And they called us all out. And we had made up, we figured\nsomething, because once they found us and they started to ask us questions. So, we knew right\naway that they were going to... they not going to keep our secret. And they were in Auschwitz\n31\nthe same like we were. But those were mostly people that had, either they were, what do you\ncall that, politics\u00ae or... because they wouldn\u2019t take them Poles just to Auschwitz, or they were\nprostitutes or whatever, something like that, that\u2019s why they were, stayed in Auschwitz. But they\nhad to give out, they had to squeal. And that\u2019s what happened. They called us all out. We were\nnine people and they started to ask questions. I said, you know, \u201cMy father was Jewish, my\nmother was Irish,\u201d whatever. And the other one said her mother was Jewish, her father was not.\nEach one, we made up among ourselves that\u2019s what we were going to say. And that\u2019s exactly\nwhat happened. And they spared us the life. They really did.",
        "A: They believed us.",
        "A: That we were mixed, mixed. They used to call us mischling, something like that, to that effect.\nMixed marriages. And it was practical because a lot of people did get married, you know, like\nthis. But they didn\u2019t touch us. They didn\u2019t do nothing. Of course, we didn\u2019t know, we were\nshivering. But that\u2019s what it was. And the minute they spotted us, they started to ask us\nquestions. How, how, how come we had the triangle?",
        "A: We stayed away from them. We tried to stay away from them as far as possible. We shouldn\u2019t\nmeet. But of course, sometimes you couldn\u2019t help it. You had to walk through the same path\nlike they did, but we knew exactly not to say anything, not to talk, you know. Be proud and go\non and that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s right. No, they were very mean people, a mean machine. That\u2019s it.\nThey had no conscience.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t find out that they squealed, but we understood. Because that\u2019s the only ones that met\nus. Nobody else knew us. And that\u2019s what happened. We knew right away. The minute they\nstarted to ask questions about the triangle, we knew that we are finished. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. Because nobody else would know that Jewish people have a triangle. They had\nnumbers just like we did, but of course they didn\u2019t have....So they compared right away and they\nknew what was going on. Because nobody else would think up a thing like that.",

So, that\u2019s the only\nway we could get out of it. Because of course, Jews they didn\u2019t keep. They, they, I don\u2019t know\nwhat they did with them. Did they kill them back in the... I really can\u2019t say, but that\u2019s what it\nwas. And that\u2019s what came to our mind to say, that all mixed marriages. And for that they had a\nlittle bit more respect, I guess.",
        "A: Oh, sure. I remember like now. Everything that happened in my life, I\u2019m always in the\nbathroom. Any excitement. I\u2019m always . And all of a sudden you hear screaming.\nIt was a lot of hills, in Switau, I mean in the Czechs, a lot of hills. So everybody started to\nscream, \u201cThe Americans are here! The Americans are here!\u201d What you heard them coming with\nmotorcycles up the hill, you know, up and down, a lot of them. And they were wearing masks,\nlike to see through, the dust shouldn\u2019t go into their eyes, I guess, and mouth. I mean, that\u2019s the\nway I assumed. And they all came to a certain spot. Like in the middle of the... and they, and\nthey stopped. And they announced that the Americans... that they are the Americans and they\ncame to liberate us. And we shouldn\u2019t be afraid. And of course, they had the business of picking\nup the Germans, too, that watched us. And I ran out from the bathroom with my pants down and\nI came to the spot and I pulled it up. And it was like a miracle, like, like you see it in the movies.\nYou couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t see it otherwise, and unbelievable too, that we are free. And they\nsaid to us, \u201cWe came to liberate you. Be very, very careful not...\u2019 \u2014this was on the second or\non the third day, I remember\u2014 \u201cnot to pick up any food and conserves.\u201d They had a lot of\nthings, the German, in jars. And we shouldn\u2019t eat no meat, because our stomachs are not used to\nit, because a lot of people fell and they died from it. And we should be very careful, if possible,\nwe should mostly eat rice and drink water. And they were just like, like sisters and brothers we\nfound. And among of them was a chaplain and he said to us, not to us, to everybody, to the\nwhole camp, whoever is Jewish should come forward. And we were still hesitating, because we\ndidn\u2019t trust anybody already. And a few minutes later we stepped out, all of us. He said not to\nbe afraid, they\u2019ll try to help us in every way. And this was a few days later, about two, three\ndays later, maybe. And that we shouldn\u2019t go back to Poland like I said before, because the\nRussians are there already. Everything was already arranged. And that they\u2019ll help us and\neverybody from among the nine of us had family in the United States, so we should come to, go\nto Paris and from there the organizations will take over. And they\u2019Il find the family.",

        "A: Hello and good-bye. (Laughing.) No, I did not. I spoke Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish and that\u2019s\nit. I didn\u2019t speak English at that time. And they brought us to Paris and like I said before the\norganizations took over and Rothschild gave us a hotel and that\u2019s where we stayed until we left\nParis.",
        "A: In Switau maybe three or four days.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. The impact in you was driving you, you know, you were healthy, but underneath\nyou were not healthy, because when I came to Paris\u2014this was months later\u2014TI used to go and I\nused to fall, had no strength in my legs. But at that point, I was strong like a bull, I didn\u2019t, you\nknow, that drive, that drives you to do, to survive, and to go on. And after a while when you find\nout that\u2019s when it all starts. You find out that you have nobody and you get disappointed and it\u2019s\nharder to take. But with a little help from your friends... that\u2019s what it did. Like my friend, the\none that\u2019s in England, I got very depressed after while when I knew that this one is leaving and\nthat one is leaving and I\u2019m staying, I\u2019m going to remain alone in Paris. And I didn\u2019t want to go\nout. I didn\u2019t want to see anybody and... and I didn\u2019t care.

        "A: Yes. And I started to get very depressed and didn\u2019t want to go on. There was no use in life\nalready. And then my friend, that she\u2019s now in England, said to me, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure that\nthe mother\u2019s wish was somebody should survive. And you are the one that survived and if you\ndon\u2019t want to go on, open up the window and throw yourself out and get it over with. But don\u2019t\nmake everybody miserable and yourself.\u201d And this few words put so much sense into my mind.\nI took a turn around and I said, \u201cShe\u2019s right, ve got to go on. I\u2019ve got to do it for them.\u201d And\nthat\u2019s the way I live all my life. That they would want me to be that way. And that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Anger was not the word for it. Disgraced. Anger, I knew I can do nothing, but how could\npeople live like that? To do that, one to another? This was hard to understand. And to kill\neverybody, not to have anybody. To be alone in the whole world. That\u2019s what bugged. But we\nall of us had the same thing, the same actually lookout on life. You got to build, you got to start\nfrom scratch and be productive and do what your parents wanted you to do. And that\u2019s exactly\nhow I went on all my life like that.",
        "A: The, the will to live and to carry on and to bring a new people into this world, that\u2019s what we\ntried to. And to help one another. And we very seldom spoke about anything like that. Took us\nyears. When they erected the monument in, in Washington, so we went to Washington. And we\nwent like eight or nine friends. And I remember being at the cemetery, Arlington Cemetery in\nWashington. And... and we had a lot of soldiers down there, came to, interviewed us. They had\nthe American flag going around and they had people from the media. And in the back of me,\nthey had, they were taking pictures and they were talking, speeches. And there was a big, heavy\ncable. And all of a sudden a young gentleman touches me and he says to me, be careful. I\nshouldn\u2019t go back, because the cable, Ill fall. And the answer was I cannot fall anymore. I was\nfallen enough. And somehow, that youngster, I will never forget him, did not disappear from us.\nAnd he started to make conversations. And he ask us, where do we go from here? From the\ncemetery? And I told him, we are going to the Capital that time. And he says, \u201cCould I come\nalong with you?\u201d I says, \u201cWhat are you, you know, hanging around us? Somebody send you?\u201d\nAnd it turned out that... I said, \u201cDo you go to school? Do you go to college? Do you have to\nwrite thesis?\u201d I... we couldn\u2019t understand. He took us by train home, because he had a... he had\na small car, so we couldn\u2019t go in, all of us, into the car. So left the car where it was parked on\nthe cemetery, not far from there and he took us by train to go to the Washington, to the, where\nthe monument is going to be erected. Because he asked us, where do we have to go? And for\nthe first time we went on a train. A beautiful train in Washington. And then we went to the\nCapitol. We had lunch there and we paid for his lunch. And he wanted to spend with us a\nwhole, a whole evening, but we were going from there on. But he found us so interesting. And\n35\nhe was in law school and wanted, like you, and he wanted to know more and more about it. But\nhe was a very nice gentleman. He had company that night coming, so he couldn\u2019t stay with us in\nthe evening, because we had everything set up for us. You know we were there for three days.\nBut it was very interesting. And... and that\u2019s it. And that... because he wanted to know more\nand more and more. How do we feel out of life? How do... our outlook on life. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s\ntime to cry and it\u2019s time to love, and that\u2019s the way it goes. Time for life and time to... and\nthat\u2019s it. That\u2019s our motto. You got to go on till the end, there\u2019s no alternative. You can\u2019t go\nbackwards. You got to go forward.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, Paris, Rothschild gave us the hotel.",
        "A: It was on Rue Giparteau (ph). That was the address. And this was Rothschild gave this to us,\nwithout charge, no money, no nothing. Yes.",
        "A: All of my friends, yes. We were there, yes, but like I said, I remained the last one. They all left\nbefore me. And it was... it was nice, I mean, it was livable. We had... everybody had the same.\nYou had two beds in every room and a bathroom, which was very nice. And of course, no\ncharge, because we had no money to pay them. And we got the meals downstairs and... and\nthose were your headquarters. If you had to go to... and a lot of times people came, helping you,\nasking you questions. \u201cWhere are you from? What was your family name?\u201d Reporters. \u201cHow\nmany in your family?\u201d You know. All kinds of questions till you get tired of answering, too.\nAnd nothing came out of it. And then towards the end, I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, because it\nbrings too much hurt in you. And one night, I make... I was sitting in my room and I think it\nwas with Halina, yeah, or maybe she went down, I was alone. And all of a sudden I heard\nscreaming on the corridor. And I said, \u201cOh my God, the Germans came back?\u201d You didn\u2019t\nknow. You were like a lamb. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Finally I opened up the door. I\nwanted to see what was going on. And there was my husband, at that time I didn\u2019t know him\nyet, and kissing my two friends, the two sisters. And they were crying and screaming and they\nintroduced me to him. \u201cThis 1s,\u201d how did they call it? \u201cA /andsman,\u201d this means from the same\ntown. And they met him. He came looking for people that survived. He heard that there was\npeople there and he was still in the Army and that\u2019s when he came over. So, they introduced me\nto him and I went into the house, to my room and I said \u201cGood night, nice knowing you,\u201d and I\nleft. And he used to come to them every single day. He used to bring them soap, a piece of\nchocolate and sardines. And if they had too much, they gave it to me. They shared with me a\nlittle bit, which was very nice of them. And that\u2019s when I found out more about it. And a short\ntime later, they left. They went to South America, to Paraguay, which they had family there.\nAnd at this point everything was ready and they left. And my husband came around a few times,\nbut I didn\u2019t pay no attention to him. And then he was discharged from the Army and he went\nback to the States. And he came in twice more. And the girls had made up with me, the two\nsisters, they knew I had nobody. At that point I didn\u2019t find my uncle yet... that if I want to come\n36\nto South America where they are, they have a brother, that is, that is, his wife was left in Poland.\nHe left before the war, and the wife didn\u2019t get a chance to go out. And that they would want me\nvery much in the family. And that\u2019s when all the trouble started. And I said, that\u2019s nice, that\nwas very nice of them. But of course, they meant more for themselves than for me. And then\nmy husband, I told him the story about what happened and after a while he came out and he told\nme the truth. They had mentioned to me that he was married before the war and they had one\nchild. And my husband knew that he had two children. And he must have been old like my\nfather.",
        "A: The two friends, the two sisters that left for South America, to Paraguay. This was their brother\nand they wanted me for a sister-in-law. And they think I didn\u2019t have anybody and they knew me\nfrom concentration camp. So, they wanted me, I should come out to them. And they have a\nbrother that the wife didn\u2019t... did not survive. And they wanted me, I should...",
        "A: ...a match. So, I didn\u2019t know anything. So, I said, \u201cLet him write to me and we\u2019|l see later\nwhat\u2019s going to be.\u201d But I never got a letter from them. I only got telegrams. I should come out\nthere. And they send, they bought me the passage to go and everything and like a dummy, I\ndidn\u2019t know from nothing. I\u2019m going to Paraguay.",
        "A: Sure, Sonja and what was the other one? Sonja Braun (ph), Braun is her name. And what was\nthe other one? I can\u2019t remember her name.",
        "A: Maybe it\u2019s going to come back to me like before, but right now I can\u2019t think of her name.",
        "A: And that they want me there very, very much. And like I said, \u201cTell him to write to me and we\u2019 ll\nsee what\u2019s going to be. Or send a picture on top of it.\u201d But this never materialized. I only got\nlike right away telegrams and telegrams and that they\u2019re making out the papers. And they\u2019re\ngoing to send me... I have to go and get a visa. And they\u2019re going to pay for the fare and\neverything. They knew I had no money. And then when my husband came back and he asked\nme, did I find my uncle. And I said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going\nto Paraguay, that Sonja and,\u201d oh I can\u2019t think of her name, the other one, \u201cwants me there. And\nthey want me, they have a brother for me.\u201d And he knew the whole family, what was going on.\nThen it came out a few months later, didn\u2019t tell me right away, the truth. That he was married, I\nsaid, I knew, but he had two children. They only said he had one. And the age they didn\u2019t tell\nme. And he was almost the age like my father. And that\u2019s what happened. And then, so my\nhusband said to me, \u201cGive me the, all the particulars that you knew about your uncle. Give it to\n37\nme.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired. I don\u2019t want it, anything else.\u201d The only thing is I could think\nis he\u2019s very rich, the same speech, or he\u2019s passed away. I remembered the children, their names,\nI remembered his name. I remembered his wife\u2019s name. But I did not remember the address\nwhere he lived. This my mother told us just before the war broke, before we were, we were\nseparated, that we should all remember. And that\u2019s what happened, the address I forgot where\nhe lived. And that\u2019s what it was so hard for him to find me, for me to find him, rather. Excuse\nme. And the papers that he read, there was a lot of Jewish papers them years. So, instead of The\nDay they called it, you read Good Morning. So, I put it in this paper and he read the other paper.\nSo, so I gave my husband all the particulars, he went back to the States. And that\u2019s it. And two\ndays later or three days later, I get a letter, my uncle. And he sent me twenty dollars, he put it\ninto the envelope. But he just found out from the soldier, Mr. Lerner, that I\u2019m alive and he\u2019s\ngoing send out papers for me that I should come to the States here. And being nobody survived\nwith me, my cousin, that was his sister, too. It was one brother and two sisters, so I was from\none sister and my cousin was from the other sister. And he wants very, very much I should come\nto the United States. And that\u2019s the way it started. So, in the interim I, I sent him a letter. That I\nwas mad, because I took it very wrong that he doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge himself. This was\nmy pride, but it was not so. He was very, you know, devoted and healthy, happy that I\u2019m alive,\nthat somebody\u2019s alive from the family. And interested, very, I should come and he\u2019Il try to help\nin every way. And that he\u2019s sending out papers. But then from there instead of sending me\nletters, they sent me telegrams. And they bought me already the, the, everything, they paid the\nfare in for me to go by plane to South America. And I started to put... and then he came again,\nmy husband. I was over a year in Paris. And by that time, he came again, once more. He joined\nthe Merchant Marines and he went back and forth. And he told me... and I told him what\u2019s on\nmy mind. And when he told me that... yeah, a picture came from them. And he was in the back.\nBecause I wrote them, \u201cI never got a picture, I never got a letter, I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going\non. You don\u2019t keep your promise. I\u2019m not going to keep my promise.\u201d You know, that\u2019s the\nway I was talking to my... writing to my friends.",
        "A: Right, right, them two, yes. And then I got a picture from them all. The ones that I knew. When\nmy husband came, I showed him the picture and he said that\u2019s not him. He was very short. But\nthey put a stool in the back, that\u2019s why he was in the back. So, that\u2019s when I put two and two\ntogether. And I went back... yeah and between... I had to go through Spain to go to them,\nthrough Spain, I had to stop in Spain. So, I had to have a visa from Spain. In the interim, Spain\nand Paris, and France didn\u2019t... had some kind of delay or whatever. They had some kind of\nargument. This was right after the war and they wouldn\u2019t allow anybody. So, I had to be stuck\nagain in Paris. And that\u2019s what happened. I went back to ORT, ORT is a Jewish organization\nthat they knew the whole story. And I went back to them and I told them, \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d And\nthe girl said to me, \u201cWhat are you crazy or something? You couldn\u2019t wait to get out of Paris\nalready to go and now all of a sudden you change your mind.\u201d And I told her the whole story,\nwhat was going on. And she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I cannot help you. You\u2019ll have to go from\nParaguay, if you don\u2019t like it there, you\u2019ll have to go whatever you want from there. But in the\ninterim you must go.\u201d I said, \u201cThere 1s no such thing with must.\u201d I went... I said, \u201cI want to see\nsomebody higher than you, different authority. And there came a gentleman and I told him the\nstory. And he says, \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d And that\u2019s when I... I had a friend in Paris that went with me\n38\nwith all these things. Halina\u2019s friend, she came from the same town. And she was very nice to\nus. She used to call us in for dinner and whatever we had to go, she went along with us. She\nwas very, very helping. And then I decided I\u2019m not going to go. And I waited in Paris and my\nhusband wanted to marry me. And I said, to myself, \u201cOkay.\u201d It was over a year. I couldn\u2019t find\nanybody. And we decided to get married. But in order for me and him, go together to the\nUnited States, we had to get married in Paris. So we had a beautiful wedding in Paris, invited all\nmy friends. And after a while we came over here.",
        "A: Oh sure, it took me over a year. I didn\u2019t want to... he was coming back and forth, but I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what was going on. You know what I\u2019m saying? He had feelings, and I had feelings,\nbut I wasn\u2019t ready yet, let\u2019s put it this way. Because I was still searching and looking and once I\npromised, I didn\u2019t want to break my promise on top of it. Once I heard what he told me, I\nbelieved him and that\u2019s what happened. They were very nice and very good, but they wanted\ngood for their brother, too, so they wanted me. Because they knew I wouldn\u2019t have to go any\nplace else. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out. And that\u2019s what happened. But I\u2019m happy. Got\nmarried already after a while and had a child, which I was very happy for the whole story. But\nwe got to see them after the war.",
        "A: Oh yeah. We went to South America. My husband had a sister in Argentina. And from there\nwe went to, to see them. I didn\u2019t want to go, but my husband insisted and we went. And that\u2019s\nwhat happened. And after that they came quite a few times to New York, so they came to see\nme, too.",
        "A: Oh sure, all along, sure. He knew everything, because he only hung out with people that lived\nthrough the war, because we were always together.",
        "A: No, he was thirteen years old, that he came to, his father was, left before, five years prior to that.\nAnd then he came with the rest of the family.",
        "A: The same place where my girlfriends, my two friends. Where was he born? Not too far from\nBialystok. Oh God, your mind escapes you. Lomza. Lomza. That\u2019s not too far from Bialystok.\nThat\u2019s where he was raised and born, down there. His mother was still in Europe. His father\nwas in the United States. So he went to visit her in 1939, just before the war broke out. And\nthat\u2019s when he met all these people again, because they were from the same town and they were\n39\nvery close. So, when the war ended, that\u2019s when he met them in Paris. He came searching.\nThat\u2019s exactly where he met them.",
        "A: I would say we went out in Poland, actually, before the war broke out. Like I said, I belonged to\nthe Jabotinski, to the... but yes, to be exactly, yes. Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I was not, not like today the girls, they go and they sleep with their men. We didn\u2019t do\nthese things. I would never do that. Had to wait to get married in order to be near each other. I\nstayed at Rue Giparteau (ph) and he was in a hotel. But it was, you have to trust somebody in\norder to, to be honest with somebody, I mean. You look nice and you look good and had all\nkinds of promises, and that\u2019s what happened.",
        "A: Wild, and... yes.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t have that, definitely not. We did not have that. We had no, a broken childhood,\nactually. That\u2019s what it was. Yes, and that\u2019s why when I see a kid of twelve, thirteen years old,\nincluding my grand-daughter doing the hair, streaking. I say, \u201cIs that necessary?\u201d I can\u2019t see it\nfor dust. I cannot see it. Because we were... I didn\u2019t put on lipstick until my wedding day. Did\nnot. Now I cover all up all the things. (Laughing.) But them years? No. Never smoked, never\ndid anything like that.",
        "A: Yeah, a fantasy, of course. But you didn\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s not like over here, you talk to your\nfriends. \u201cThis happened, that\u2019... no, we didn\u2019t... I was not of that age, you know, to talk about\nthings like that. Because like I said, I had younger, older sisters than me. But no, I didn\u2019t have\nsuch fantasies, no, like the kids today, no. My fantasy was just to bring in food in the house and\nwe should have what to eat, and... and we should all be together. This was my childhood. It\u2019s\ndifferent.\n40",
        "A: The education, at that point, I did not go, because you started to build a life for yourself. And of\ncourse, I wanted to go have a child. And we were just starting out, so it was not actually for me\nto go to school. That\u2019s the way I looked at it. I just wanted to help my husband and build a\nhome. And I used to go to school at night, night school they had them years. And I was helping\nmy husband. We were working like hand to hand, and to become somebody, to make something\nout of yourself. And then we wanted to have a baby, so it took me almost seven years until I had\nmy son. And this was a big thing, because all my friends had children already. So, it\u2019s another\nthing. But thank God, he was born and I was very proud of him. And he was the whole life to\nme and to my husband, both of us. And we only saw that he should have a better life than we\ndid. And he should go to college and he should be somebody. That\u2019s it. That was my main\nthing.",
        "A: No. I... my cousin went to Palestine, because she was younger than me, ten years. And she\nwent with a child\u2019s transport from Paris. And I wanted to go with her very, very much, because\nonce I found her, I didn\u2019t want to let go. And especially I was older. And, but I couldn\u2019t go,\nbecause this was just a child\u2019s transport. So, I said to myself, I could always go to Israel later on.\nSo, I remained in Paris and she went on to Israel. But at the end, I brought her here. She\nfinished her schooling. She was in a kibbutz. And she finished her schooling, she became a\nnurse, and then I took her here. But she was sick. I didn\u2019t even know. It was not an easy life,\nnot easy, because she saw her mother gassing. They put her in the twenty-fifth block they called\nit, when they got her. And she noticed the smoke coming out right away. They gassed her.",
        "A: In Auschwitz, and she couldn\u2019t cope with it. I didn\u2019t know at that point. At that point we were\nall the same. But when she went to Israel, and that\u2019s when it all came out. She was lonely, and I\nbrought her to me. And she stayed with me a while, but she, she did not listen. I thought she\nwas mean, but she was sick already. What did I know about mental health? I didn\u2019t know about\nall these things. And then I married her off, but she did not stay with me anymore. She, she\nmoved out. She went to my uncle...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\n4]\nTape 3, Side B",
        "A: And she went to my aunt, to my uncle\u2019s house, to stay with them for a while. But of course I had\nsaid to my aunt, \u201cCall me one night.\u201d\u2019 And she came, when I brought her, I was pregnant with\nmy son. And like I said before, it took me seven years almost. And she... when he was born... I\nwas maybe in my ninth month already when she got over here, and if I said to her, \u201cI want to\nspend more time with the kids.\u201d She came... I got her a job to work in a hospital, but not as a\nnurse, as a nurse\u2019s aide, because she didn\u2019t have the diploma. And they wouldn\u2019t acknowledge it\nat that time from Israel, all the years, you had to go through a test, which she wasn\u2019t ready for it.\nAnd no matter what I said, she took it, everything she took wrong. If I said day, she said night.\nNo matter what, how I tried, no matter what I did. If I jumped off the roof, she would keep...\nbut I didn\u2019t know like, she was sick. Couldn\u2019t understand. When I slept, she used to come into\nme in the bed. She was scared. She used to come in to sleep with us. And I said to myself,\nwhat\u2019s going on here? So, I took her to a doctor, took her to a family doctor, of course. Who\nknew about psychiatrists them years? And he prescribed a pill and she took it and that\u2019s it, but it\nwas not enough. She needed more than that. So I got her a... a room on my block and said,\n\u201cYou could come to eat by me, but not, not sleeping.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly how it was. And then\nshe, she was keeping company, already she met a nice fellow. But she had a hard life, she did\nnot know what....She had one, what do they call that? One attack after the other. She wound up\nin a mental hospital. And she couldn\u2019t deal with life. And that was a very big strain on me,\npunishing myself, what I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know what was going on. And I couldn\u2019t be to\nher a mother and I couldn\u2019t be to her the father. I could only be like the way I am, warm and,\nand everything else. Caring. But she didn\u2019t buy it. She didn\u2019t... she didn\u2019t understand. She\ndidn\u2019t have a happy life. She had a wonderful husband, a good, educated man. But she, herself,\ndidn\u2019t live the way it\u2019s supposed to, and she left two children. The boy I\u2019m very... very, very\nnice, and the girl is just like the mom.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Right, right. And that\u2019s the way it went on.",
        "A: In \u201847, 1947. We got married and then we came to, to the States.",
        "A: No, we came by plane. I came by ship. (Laughing.) They, they were transporting the soldiers\nback home. But being I was a G.I. bride, so I had the same privileges, but of course, you had to\nwait for a boat. So one day my husband goes down to get a paper and he comes back and he\n42\nshows me that the boat that we\u2019re supposed to go\u2014it was Marine Flasher (ph)\u2014I remember it\nlike now, got a... on fire in the, in the dock. And I thought he was kidding me. I thought he\nwasn\u2019t telling me the truth. So I looked at the picture. I didn\u2019t know how to read. So I looked at\nthe picture and that\u2019s exactly how it was. And then we had to wait three months for another ship,\nfor another boat. And on one side I remember was the men, and on the other side was the ladies,\ngated off, you know. And I was not a good, I couldn\u2019t take the ship. I was very sick, dizzy and\nsea sick, couldn\u2019t take the water. And I was laying more than I, than I was walking around. And\nhe tried to bring me food. And there was a matron watching us and she took a look at the tray.\nHe put down from everything, this was a joke. Put down from everything and the matron took a\nlook at it and she says, \u201cIf you bring her so much food, she\u2019s not sick enough to get up and eat.\u201d\n(Laughing.) So... but instead of going, we were supposed to go like nine days or ten, we went\nfifteen days. It was a broken up ship and was... got filled full of water. We thought we going to\ndrown. And then they fixed it in Halifax and then we came to the United States.",
        "A: It had to be. I don\u2019t think she was in use in the military or they retired her. But that\u2019s what they\ntook and that\u2019s what we came back. Yeah. It was not a luxury ship, that\u2019s for sure.",
        "A: Before I came, dreaming, just tall buildings, you know, to see, how different would it be? How\nwould people accept me? My husband had a father, that we lived together. And he was very,\nvery nice to me. I adored that man. He was a very nice, pious man, very lovely and respectful,\nvery respectful. And it was just a pleasure to be with him. We moved into him. And he wanted\nto give us everything, whatever he had. He wanted to give us his room. There were two\nbedrooms. I says, \u201cPa, how could I take your bedroom? It\u2019s yours.\u201d So, we slept the two of us,\nhis bedroom was big and to the front, ours was like in a driveway. But I was happy that\nsomebody accepted us and I was very grateful. And you go on with your, whatever you have to\ndo. I went down in the morning to get breakfast, it was local, on the same block, a grocery,\ntoday you don\u2019t see it. Today you have supermarkets, big ones. That time everything was, and\nfrom the beginning when I went into the store everybody gave me their next. And then I figured\nout why, because they wanted to see if Ihave horns. (Laughing.) If I... how do I speak. It was\na pleasure. I didn\u2019t have to wait on lines, but it didn\u2019t last long. Because after a while they heard\nthat I\u2019m the same like they are, so they let me go to wait in line. And I used to shop, and bring\nhome the food, and make three meals a day, and it was just like my mother did, the same thing.",
        "A: On Newport Street, 448 Newport Street in Brooklyn. Yeah. It was a nice area. You were able\nto get a bus and a train. You know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have so many cars like they have now. You must have a car, otherwise you can\u2019t\nmove. No such thing.\n43",
        "A: American, they were born here.",
        "A: They were Jewish, too, yes.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have a stereo... I don\u2019t know if they have stereotypes. I wouldn\u2019t say that. But I\nmade up that joke. That\u2019s the way it was going on. That they wanted to see if I have horns, how\ndo I talk, how do I move myself different than they are. Curiosity I would say more than\nanything else. But then when they found out that I\u2019m just like them, they didn\u2019t let me go ahead\nof them anymore. I had to wait in line. And that\u2019s it.",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t say that. I didn\u2019t find it. I never had that feeling, no, no. My friends had that feeling,\na lot of them, but I never had that feeling. I never felt any different than they are.",
        "A: Oh, they were Jewish, because they were survivors. They mixed with different kind of people. I\nreally don\u2019t know. A lot of them felt that way. I never did that. I never felt that way. I felt I\u2019m\nthe same like them, not any better, not any worse. I\u2019m the same platform that they are.",
        "A: A short time, right away, right away I would say, when I came to the States. They had at night,\nthe night school. Thomas Jefferson was the school, I remember. And I said if I want to live\nhere, I have to learn. Have to learn to read and write and that\u2019s what I did. I went at night. And\none day I came home and I see the light is on, because my father-in-law\u2019s windows were to the\nfront. And as I was walking home, and I see... I got scared. I said, I hope he feels all right. And\nI come upstairs. We lived on the first floor. And I come upstairs and he\u2019s sitting and learning. I\nsays, \u201cPa, what are you doing? Do you feel all right? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m jealous\non you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re here such a short time and you\u2019re learning English. I want to learn,\ntoo.\u201d And that\u2019s when he got one of my books and he was sitting and reading English. I thought\nit was so cute.",
        "A: Yeah.\nAd",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Broken up, very broken up, not grammatisch\u2019, like they say. Not like the... how do you say.\nLike with the ABC. I don\u2019t know how to express myself to say it.",
        "A: Fluent, yeah. Not only fluently, but not, 1f a man, he would say it\u2019s a woman, you know, you use\nthe same phrase. You know what I\u2019m saying? But very poorly.",
        "A: Oh yes, saw the Statue of Liberty. I saw, at that point, was Ellis Island, them years, but of course\nI didn\u2019t see... the tall buildings amazed me very, very much, just to keep it up. And we had\nsomebody picking us up from the, from the boat and that\u2019s it. And my husband took me to, to\nhis friends. I mean not right away, but days after and we all became like friends. I fitted in right\naway, they did like me very much. And that\u2019s the way we remained friends all our lives. I had a\ngood life. And if 1t wasn\u2019t good, you have to make it good. That\u2019s my motto. You got to make\ngood.",
        "A: No, never.",
        "A: Uh uh, didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to be different than anybody else. I was always wanted to\nbe like somebody else. The number, couldn\u2019t live with it. I had to take it out. And I did and I\nwas very happy. And once I took it out, I\u2019m like everybody else. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s in my\nheart, but on the outside I look alike. If I] open up my mouth, of course you\u2019ll see ma\nforeigner, but I was never ashamed of being a foreigner. But I couldn\u2019t live with the number,\nbecause this made me different than everybody else. This I couldn\u2019t accept. So, when my son\nstarted to go to school, I said, that\u2019s when I\u2019Il take it off. And exactly I did that. And like I said\nbefore, I... if you ask me, \u201cOh that\u2019s what the 2\u201d No, this is my number and I\u2019m\nvery proud of it. In the hospital, whenever I was, that\u2019s my number. If somebody rang the bell\nand it was in the morning, I could open up the door in a house dress or my nightgown, but I\ncould not, would not let you see my number. Had to take a dish towel from the kitchen or\nsomething to put it on top. It was like unacceptable in my, in my life. I can\u2019t do it. One time a\nchild caught me and she asked me, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d And I told her, \u201cOh it\u2019s my telephone\n* German: grammatical.\n45\nnumber.\u201d I always found an excuse, I figured how the age, how she\u2019s going to accept it. Of\ncourse, she didn\u2019t accept that, she understood something. She says, \u201cNobody puts a telephone\nnumber,\u201d but I said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember, so I didn\u2019t want to lose it. So, that\u2019s why I put it there.\u201d\nBut you couldn\u2019t catch me the second time already without anything. I used to put on a tape to\ncover it if I had to go out. All the time until I took it off. It was like a, I don\u2019t know, it was like a\ndisbelief, a hurt. Not everybody felt the same way like me. A lot of my friends still have it, but I\njust couldn\u2019t live with it. I took it differently. And that\u2019s it.",

And he came into the house and I don\u2019t know, I was sitting and crying. It had to\nbe some kind of a holiday, because this was the worst time of my life, not to have family sit at\nthe table, just the three of us. It was very hard for me, because like I said before, I was... I had a\nbig family and warm family, and I was missing it a lot. And he said to me, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\nWhat happened?\u201d \u201cNothing happened, Joel. I don\u2019t feel good. I\u2019m just crying.

I never forgot that. And boys have like\nprotected me then already. You know what I\u2019m saying? But he knew, I\u2019m sure that he knows\neverything, what went on. Here and there he heard it.

I\u2019m not scared. This is\n46\nsomething in me, that I have no nightmares. My husband used to have nightmares. My friends\ntold me that their husbands had nightmares, but I never had nightmares.

It was... we bought a house, an apartment building, four bedrooms, three\nbedrooms and he held that house. He did alterations. They fixed it. A lot of them were closed\nup. You brought them back to life. And not in the best areas, in the... for the poor people, let\u2019s\nput it this way. Middle class, no, it was lower than middle class. And it was working them. He\nwent for the plumber, he went for the electrician. He brought them back to life, those\napartments. And that\u2019s the way he used to used to build them up. Them years if you put in a\nnew gas range or you put in radiators they had in the walls for the heat, so you got a raise. And\nthat\u2019s the way he was working it. And from this he made, from one house, then he bought\nanother house, then he bought another house and paid the bank the mortgages, and... and I took\ncare on it. And that was his job. And I used to take the complaints in the house. So, this was\nmy job. And that\u2019s the way we built it up. He used to come home for lunch and dinner. We had\na real family life.",
        "A: Yes. I never had that... I felt I\u2019m just as good as everybody else. All my life I felt like that.",
        "A: Right away maybe, I think it was a year, a year and a half after. I didn\u2019t have to wait the five\nyears. So, I went and I passed the test. Yeah.\n47",
        "A: Yes, 1t was. I was very proud of myself that I made it. And I always felt if you live in a country,\nyou have to be able to know what\u2019s going on. Quite a few times I went, they called me for jury\nduty. And I told them, I says, \u201cCan\u2019t you get somebody better, more educated than me?\u201d And\nthey said, \u201cNo. You have a brain, you\u2019re using it, that\u2019s what\u2019s important. You know how to\nread and write?\u201d That\u2019s what it is. And one time, I was... they picked me on a case about\nweights and measures, and... and I told them... so, we made... they settled it out of court. And\nthey said, \u201cYou could go home.\u201d I asked the judge, I was there a whole week. \u201cThe money that\nwe're going to get, do we have to declare it?\u201d And he turned around and he said to me, \u201cLet\nyour conscience be the guidance.\u201d (Laughing.) And I\u2019m still laughing about it. Whatever they\ngive you. I don\u2019t remember exactly, seven or eight dollars a day. But the way he answered it. I\nsaid, \u201cDo I have to declare it?\u201d Like afraid to be good. You know what I am saying? To do\nwhat is the right thing to do. That was always me... I was always. And I asked him. He said,\n\u201cLet your conscience be the guide.\u201d I said thank you, and I went on.",
        "A: No, I did not, had no conscience. I think it was about sixty or seventy dollars I made that week.\nDon\u2019t forget I had to take off transportation, too. (Laughing.) But it was very funny. I thought\nit was very funny.",
        "A: Right away.",
        "A: Oh yeah, right away. My husband introduced me to his friend that he came the same time like he\ndid to the United States. And his wife was an American girl. And now she\u2019s, poor thing, in a\nhome. She has Alzheimer\u2019s. And we were the best of friends, all our, through our life. We\nalways said we\u2019re going to help each other when we\u2019re going get... she had no mother. Her\nmother passed away. Her father had remarried, and she had a hard life, and she had two boys\nand the sons write to me and they call me all the time. And we became like family right away,\nand helping one another. If I didn\u2019t have no children yet, she wanted to go someplace, I babysat.\nWe always, always helping ways. If I made something and I knew that the kids are going to like,\nI used to bring over some food, and they enjoyed it. Things like European things, but they loved\nit, certain things that she didn\u2019t know how to make. And I had a lot of friends, American born,\nhere, but they were people, they were... I never had a problem. Never. They were them and I\nwas me, that\u2019s it. Maybe because they considered themselves an American and had friends. So\nmaybe that\u2019s what it was, but I never, never found any fault.\n48",
        "A: The only thing that I cannot watch here and I cannot agree with them is like, no love for your\nbrother. The guns, the killing, the stealing, the... all these things goes against me. There is no\nreason for it. There is no reason for it. Or you see somebody robbing in the street. There\u2019s no...\nit doesn\u2019t call for it. You could work and make a living. And I\u2019m very much against these\nthings. I feel that everybody is the same, has the same right. I have a woman that takes care on\nme from the day I got here. And now it\u2019s almost two years, it\u2019s going to be in June. I treat her\nroyally, better than I treat myself. She has a chip on her shoulder because she is black. And I\nkeep telling her. Like she gets excited if somebody looks wrong at her. I says, \u201cTeresa, grow\nup, it\u2019s all in your head. It\u2019s no place else but in your head. I don\u2019t know why you have that\nfeeling in you.\u201d She was persecuted and this and that. I said, \u201cI was not sitting on my beautiful\nchair and watching television all my life, too. I was very hurt in my... but you got to let go, you\ncan\u2019t hold on to these things.\u201d I don\u2019t agree with a lot of things. I personally think they have it\ntoo God damn good, they should go out to work better. Even those kids, what went on now. It\u2019s\na terrible thing that doesn\u2019t call for all these things. And how did the parents not know about it?\nI will never believe it.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s a disgrace.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\n49\nTape 4, Side A",
        "A: About Bosnia we were talking. Yeah, the way they\u2019re throwing them out of their homes. It\nbrought back so many memories.",
        "A: And Kosovo, yeah. I was sitting and crying. My son called me, said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Ma?\u201d\nI said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s what it is. I can\u2019t take these things. It doesn\u2019t call for all these things. It\u2019s\nenough is enough.\u201d But I guess it\u2019s not enough yet.",
        "A: No, I would never go back there, never, never in a million years. I went to Israel. We traveled a\nlot. And we went to South America. We went a lot of places, but I would never go back to\nPoland. I feel that I have nothing there but misery. I have no graves. I have nothing to go to,\neven to go on the grave, I don\u2019t. To say hello, I don\u2019t have no graves. I have nothing, so what\nam I going to go see? Never. Never, never. My husband did go, to see my house where we\nlived. Oh yeah, but I would never do that. He went without me. We went to Washington that\ntime and he went to Poland.",
        "A: Uh huh. He went on a... on atour. And I would never in a million and one years go. I have\nno... I have no heart for this anymore. I cannot make it any better, so. I want to remember it the\nway it was.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very funny thing. I still have my beliefs and I cannot change it. It\u2019s... I take him for a bad\nboy. The child was on dope. That\u2019s what the mother says. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know him and\nI wish I would have never known him. I\u2019m not there to fight the case. He only got six and a half\nyears, which is nothing.",
        "A: One person that did that. He robbed me. If he would come in and would rob me, he would want\nmy jewelry, I would give it to him gladly. He didn\u2019t have to kill me. But... and if you ask me,\n50\ndo Iremember him? No. The detectives came when I was in the hospital, I remember, the day I\nleft. Showed me pictures of him. Never saw him before in my life.",
        "A: The kids from the area gave him out. The police went around, detectives searching what went\non, you know, looking. And they were the ones that gave him the address and the name. And he\ndid two people the same day, me and another woman a block away. So, I mean... and it was not\na black boy. It was a white boy. So the mother is there. I should say that I feel sorry for the\nmother? No. That this would be a lie. She goes every day to court when it went on the case. I\nwas not there. My son was not there. So we had a lawyer, but they couldn\u2019t fight it without us.\nHe left me a cripple for the rest of my life and all the pain that I have with me, but nothing\nhelped. Because he was there, and that\u2019s what he got, six and a half years. He\u2019ll come out, he\u2019ll\ndo it again. But I can do nothing about it. Cannot take a gun and go and kill him, because it\u2019s\nagainst me. I can\u2019t do that. But that\u2019s it. But on the other hand I have to take that thing out of\nmy life. I could lay down and die? No. My time wasn\u2019t up yet. When my time is going to be\nup, Pll go. But I have another extension of life, so I have to go and enjoy it. And that\u2019s the way\nI\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m enjoying it... I\u2019m not enjoying it, but \u2019m alive. Let\u2019s put it this way. Like for\nthe holidays, my son belongs to a... the Reform temple, so I went with him. And the four\ndoctors that used to take care on me in the hospital were there and they came over to wish me a\nhappy New Year. And they couldn\u2019t get over how good you look. I said, \u201cThank God for the\nmake-up.\u201d I always have something what to say. I said, \u201cThank God for the make-up, it covers\nall the sins.\u201d I says, \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d He said, \u201cA lot of people\u2019s make-up cannot do such a good\njob like this.\u201d (Laughing.) But I always have something I could always make a joke out of it.\nYou know what I\u2019m saying? But that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Would I say something for my son?",
        "A: I was always a good mother. I have to... [ have to compliment myself. I was always a good\nmother, looking out for the child. Always being there for him. And I think that\u2019s what he repays\nme back. He\u2019s there for me all the time. He cares about me. But I understand very much he has\nhis own life and I don\u2019t want to take nothing away from him. But he\u2019s a very good boy. He\u2019s\ngood. And I\u2019m thankful to God that I have him. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. He takes care on\nme. I was good to him, too.",

        "A: The oldest one is Shawn. Which he was just, in February fourteenth, he was twenty-two. He\u2019s\nin school, college, rather. My second one is Lindsay. Lindsay is twenty. She was twenty, in\nMarch twenty-seven, she was twenty. And she too is in college. The number three is Daniel.\nHe\u2019s still in high school. Daniel was sixteen, he\u2019s going to be seventeen. And my youngest one\nis thirteen, Ashley.",
        "A: They all do, I would say. I would say they all do. Now, the youngest one now, wants to go to\nIsrael later on, I guess, when she\u2019s going to be sixteen. I said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you every way I can. I\nwant you to see your land. And I want you, too, like the others did.\u201d Ashley went, uh Lindsay\nwent, so did Shawn. Daniel\u2019s going to go along maybe later on a little bit. And I always visit\nthem, because I lived in Brooklyn and they know I have the love for them and they have their\nlove for me. I know they are very busy. I would like to see them more often. But I understand\nthat not only do they have their life, but I can\u2019t demand anything from them, because I\u2019m not\ngoing to get it. I should be thankful whatever I got and that\u2019s the way I go on. They respect me\nand I respect them and that\u2019s what it is. A lot of people cannot see it, the way I see it. I cannot\ndemand from anybody. Ill do myself. But my friend just lost her husband not long ago and he\nused to be, he used to take her all over and help her with every way. And she couldn\u2019t walk two\nblocks. Now of course, she finds it very, very hard. She has one daughter and the daughter is\ngetting tired of it already. She has a family too and she works. I said, \u201cBetty, get a hold of\nyourself. She has her life too. You can\u2019t demand too much, because you\u2019re not going to get it.\nThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault that, you know, you got spoiled all your life. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s\nall about. That\u2019s it. You, you can work. You can\u2019t go, walk? Get a cab, go whatever you have\nto do. There\u2019s no alternative. If you don\u2019t drive that\u2019s what you have to do.\u201d And I cannot lay\non anybody... I\u2019m always appreciative whatever you do, it\u2019s good, it\u2019s okay. I may think\ndifferently, but I\u2019m not going to give it out. I can\u2019t do that. I still know between right and wrong\nand I\u2019m a happy bird. I\u2019m very happy, all my life, like a stupid... [laughing] I\u2019m a happy-go-\nlucky.",
        "A: Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah, it\u2019s going to be two years in June.",
        "A: I had no expectations. I didn\u2019t know at that point what was going on in my life. I... my husband\nnever wanted to move to Kentucky. He didn\u2019t like Kentucky. It was not for him. But being the\nneighborhood started to change, so I started to talk to him about it. He didn\u2019t want to listen to\nme. \u201cThat\u2019s my home and that\u2019s the way I\u2019m going to be there.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t have too much\nexpectations. I knew what was going on in Kentucky. The money talks. He found out, he felt\nlike that... if you want to meet somebody, you go out for lunch. My husband was from a\n52\ndifferent era, he knew his wife 1s going to make lunch and you come to the house. And I found it\nvery hard, too with that thing. Because they don\u2019t want to cook, everything 1s going out and he\nwas not used to a life like this.",
        "A: In Kentucky, in Kentucky, yes, yes, yes. So, he was not too much for Kentucky, but after he\npassed away, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I knew I couldn\u2019t stay too long where I was, because the\nneighborhood was changing. A lot of my friends moved away. So, where did they go? Either\nthey went to Florida or they went to New Jersey. And I figured Ill find out. So I went to\nFlorida for the winter for four months, and I... I still was undecided what to do. And then this\nthing came up and... and here Iam. And that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yeah. What was my impression? I mean, I knew I\u2019Il never make a friend over here, because\nthat\u2019s my age. You make friends when you\u2019re young and you hold onto them. When you are an\nolder person, I don\u2019t want to hear their problems and they don\u2019t want to hear my problems. You\ntalk about sicknesses. Especially if I don\u2019t drive, that\u2019s a disability already. I cannot... I have to\nwait for somebody to take me. And I don\u2019t like that. I was always used to walk and do my own\nthing. And solve my own problems. I was a private person. I didn\u2019t like anybody to feel sorry\nfor me or whatever. So... but here I have no alternative. I have a woman that helps me. She\ntakes me all over, wherever I have to go. She makes the appointments for me with my doctors\nand that\u2019s it. I do my own cooking, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a lonely life.",
        "A: I never went to the Holocaust... I didn\u2019t even know that they had one over here. I would like\nyou to, if you have an address, to leave it and I'll find out more about it. This I would like very\nmuch. I didn\u2019t even know that they have a Holocaust... the Jewish, JCC, the Jewish...",
        "A: ... Community Center. I went after my husband passed away, and I came down for a holiday\nover here by myself. And my son took me around to show me I should settle over here in\nLouisville. So we made an appointment with the JCC that I should go over there, you know, and\nthey\u2019 Il tell me what I could do, what, what kind of facilities they have for senior citizens and all\nthat thing. So, he dropped me off at ten o\u2019clock in the morning. This was before I got hurt,\nbefore my accident. He dropped me off at ten o\u2019clock in the morning and she showed me the\nbuilding. She showed me all the things what they have for senior citizens. And he says, \u201cMa,\nyou\u2019re going to have lunch over here and I\u2019Il pick you up after lunch.\u201d I says, fine. So, the lady\ntakes me for a walk and shows me the building. And then she showed me downstairs where all\nthe senior citizens meet. And they were making a journal, because a journal comes out like\nevery month. And I was helping them to put the journal together. And I was very happy. And\nof course, I was the youngest one, you could imagine. (Laughing.) One didn\u2019t hear, one didn\u2019t\nsee, but I took everything fine, it\u2019s good. And I had my pocketbook with me, and I said to the\n53\nwoman that I was working with, I said, where could I, where do you leave your bags? Where do\nyou put your pocketbook? She says, \u201cPut it next to me on my... at the table. I\u2019Il sit over here\nand you\u2019ll sit next to me. We\u2019ll have lunch together.\u201d I says, fine, thank you. And it must have\nbeen maybe about ten to twelve. And the lady comes over, \u201cWhose bag is that? I said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nmine. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my seat.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I'll take it away. I didn\u2019t\nknow. The other one told me, that lady told me I could sit over here, no big deal.\u201d And it threw\nme off so much, that I just... I wasn\u2019t used to it. I said, \u201cAh, that\u2019s not for me. Let them stay\nwith them. I\u2019m not going to come back.\u201d And since then, I went again. I went to a concert there\nnot long ago. I try, but somehow, I don\u2019t get... 1t\u2019s not for me. I can\u2019t be like that, them... it\u2019s\nlike anything else, I don\u2019t know them. Let\u2019s put it this way. And to get acquainted at this point\nand to have their lunches, which I don\u2019t care for, it brings back too many memories. So, I\u2019d\nrather stay home. And here they have a pool and maybe I\u2019Il join the pool. I'll go over. [Pll take\na look. And that\u2019s it.",
