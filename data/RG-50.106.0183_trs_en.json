        "A: From what I remember mother was always talking about Biala Podlaska.

I\nremember my mother\u2019s father passed away and of course at that time we were too young to be\nallowed to attend funerals. And my maternal grandmother, as I said, lived across the street and I\nremember I went often over there to school. She was, used to fix my omelets, fried in o11, which\nseemed to be delicious at the time. For some reason my paternal grandmother, very sweet little\nwoman.

        "Q: Did you live right in the center of the city?",
        "A: Yes, I did. I lived close to the Gare de Midi I remember because we used to take the train\nvery often, we didn\u2019t have a car. And we traveled either by tram or by train. And every summer\nmother and dad would rent a house at the beach, Blankenberg [ph], and the family would spend\nthe summer there. And my father would come out on weekends. And it was nice.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "Q: Can you describe the holidays.",
        "A: Well Passover was just wonderful, because mother would start cleaning the house and\ncleaning the silver and bringing baskets of eggs and baskets of onions. And I really remember\nslogging kaports [ph] for the chicken. I mean it was a lot to do. I remember that before, and\nmother even would do, she would put the, she would make her own wine for Passover, because\nbehind the barrier, and this 1s just now coming to me, there was also a big what would you call\nthem, those great big jars that you keep wine in.",
        "Q: Barrels.",
        "A: Well it wasn\u2019t a barrel, it was made out of glass, but it was used and she would do cherries in\nsugar and they would ferment until Passover and it really was delicious. And I remember we\nfinally got our own bathroom, because we didn\u2019t have one for the longest time. Not a bathtub, I\nmeant my \u2014 because, no because I think, if I remember clearly, we used to go to what would you\ncall them.",
        "Q: Baths, you mean public baths.",
        "A: Public, yes. And for Pesach we all had to clean up. We all had to dress up and we all had to sit\nat a table. It didn\u2019t matter if 1t was 11:00 at night. But you know there was a sense of peace,\nreally I do remember that. We never complained about being hungry. Mother must have had the\nfamily over because there was always more than the four of us but I do remember Passovers. I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndo remember Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur because the women and the men sat separately.\nMama and I sat upstairs, while Papa and my brother were downstairs. And I do remember my\nbrother\u2019s bar mitzvah, how he used to have a rabbi that used to come in and tutor him but not me.\nGirls were not as important at that time. Really. We thought that was very interesting. Now I\nthink that\u2019s very interesting because he could read Hebrew and he had a good understanding\neven when he got married with his family and I never did. Until I was bas mitzvahed.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: French. Oh at home, Yiddish. At home we spoke Yiddish and when mother and dad didn\u2019t\nwant me to understand they spoke Polish. And of course French was the language that I learned\nover there. I mean I went to school.",

        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your neighborhood. Was it a Jewish neighborhood?",
        "A: If it wasn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t mix with anybody who wasn\u2019t Jewish because it was very interesting.\nWe all had identity cards and I don\u2019t know what year that came to be, but our identity cards were\na different color than those who were Belgian and gentile. We had a yellow band across the\nidentity card. And I was not allowed to mix with anybody who was not Jewish.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: So you never played with other \u2014",
        "A: I never did, no. It was ingrained in me. I don\u2019t know whether I thought I was going to burn in\nhell. It was a real scandal as mother would put it.",
        "Q: What about the school that you went to? Was it a Jewish school?",
        "A: No, it was not. It was a public school and I very much remember my father walking me to\nschool in the morning holding my hand. But I only did, I couldn\u2019t have gotten too much past\nelementary school because, well I went to school. I don\u2019t know how the school was divided over\nthere. Because I was 14 when I left Belgium, but a very young 14, very protected. No\nindependence.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you how independent you were.",
        "A: No independence at all, no independence at all. I was under the protection of my parents. In\nfact now that I think about it, I don\u2019t think I was ever until I got married, without one parent or\nthe other or both of them. Which is very interesting.",

        "A: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Did you like to read? Or art or music or anything like that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember studying, I did have a piano teacher that came to the house and gave piano\nlessons. I don\u2019t know that I was that interested in it. I did not became an artist. But I don\u2019t think\nthey had the arts in school as much as they do now. It was mostly academic at that time because\nI remember I had a Latin teacher already because she would -- I remember one thing about her.\nShe read palms. And she read my palm. This was before the war. She said I would have a very\nshort life and she was very -- and you know that stayed with me my whole life. And now that\nPm 84 I\u2019m all right.",

        "Q: Would you describe your childhood, your young childhood as a happy time or a relaxed time?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember it as a happy time and I often tried to think why. My mother was a very\nbeautiful woman. My father was busy during the day in his business and mother was gone when\nI came home from school. She loved to dress up, no she didn\u2019t work. She loved to dress up and\ngo for tea in the afternoon. And she would come home later. I remember myself as being a lonely\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nchild because my brother was seven years older and I was always in his way. So that I don\u2019t\nremember a lot of family gatherings.",
        "Q: Did you have any religious training yourself?",
        "A: No. The training was at home. You knew you were Jewish and that\u2019s all there was to it. You\npracticed Judaism. You light the candles on Friday night. You celebrated the Sabbath. And I\ndon\u2019t think mother celebrated the Sabbath on Saturday by staying home. And meditating all day\nlong. I don\u2019t remember that. But I know that the Jewishness was ingrained in me.",
        "Q: Were you proud to be a Jew?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because I was born a Jew. And I just wouldn\u2019t think of any other way and you must\nremember that I only grew up in Brussels until I was 14.",
        "Q: We\u2019re talking about this young \u2014",
        "A: And a 14 year old at that time would be like an 11, 12 year old in comparison today.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Hitler came into power in 33. When did you start hearing about him or did you hear about\nhim before you left?",
        "A: The only time I started hearing about it that I would have become aware 1s that the -- a little\nlater part of the, around 35 or 36 or maybe even 37. There were Germans who were fleeing\nGerman Jews who were leaving Germany to try to get to Israel and other parts of the world.\nThey would come through Belgium. And I remember that we had some of them for dinner.\nNow how they came to my mother and dad\u2019s house. There must have been an organization that\nplaced them in different homes for dinner, for hospitality. And I do remember that. And that was\nthe only way I knew, and not realizing what the problem was because I really wasn\u2019t included in\nthe conversation. But I do remember that there were German Jews who had run away from\nGermany and they were talking about some of the problems I\u2019m sure. At that time. But there\nwere many Jews who didn\u2019t believe that they would be touched. And obviously my parents\ndidn\u2019t either because they waited until the Germans attacked Belgium. But my father was very\nwise. We didn\u2019t find that out until we were here. And I didn\u2019t find that out until, before my\nbrother died, that my father in the 30s wired $10,000 to the Chase Bank in New York. And that\nmoney was here when we came to the United States. That was very wise of him. And $10,000\nwas a lot of money at that time.",
        "Q: What year was that?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: It was sometimes in the 30s. Because by the time we came in 1942 apparently his hand\nwriting, my brother told me had changed a little bit. They were giving him a hard time. But he\ndid collect the money and he opened up a leather goods store in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the 1930s. And you said your first indication was when German\nJews would come to your house. Did you know a man named Hitler at that point in the mid-30s,\nwhen you were 10, 11 or 12.",
        "A: I might have heard the name but I think I was protected from hearing too much being afraid\nabout too much, because again the atmosphere and the thought must have been at that time that it\nwasn\u2019t going to be so easy for the Nazis to overtake Europe the way they did. I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s\nwhat was on their minds because I mean we really ran the day they attacked Belgium.",
        "Q: Up to that point though you just had a regular childhood \u2014",
        "A: Regular childhood, yes.",
        "Q: You played with friends, Jewish friends only.",
        "A: Jewish friends only and I don\u2019t remember the playing with friends and I don\u2019t know why but I\nmust have had some friends because I had some letters after the war from a couple of people who\nsaid they were my friends.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Hitler invades Austria in 38. Does that mean anything?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t register with my parents. And of course you know I heard about the\nMaginot line, but didn\u2019t do any good. They went right around it.",
        "Q: Kristallnacht, the Crystal night when they destroyed synagogues",
        "A: No. No, no.",

        "A: That was the day that we had to leave our home with nothing. I mean we really just closed the\ndoor.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: How did your parents know this. What was the --",
        "A: Because the Germans were invading Belgium and there were bombs coming down and some\nof the people, I remember were boarding up their windows and mother and dad \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re 14 at this time.",
        "A: I\u2019m 14 at the time. Mother, in those days you didn\u2019t sit down with your children and explain\nwhat the situation was and what we needed to do. You just said we\u2019re going.",
        "Q: She tells you that you\u2019re going to --",
        "A: We just started running. It was like we\u2019re, I remember the running. I don\u2019t know why we\nwere running but I remember that we were chasing after a train that was leaving full of refugees.\nAnd that train took us to the southern part of France.",

        "A: I just went with them.",
        "Q: Well did you pack any, did you take anything with you especially. What did she take?",
        "A: No because I think we really felt we were coming back. I really think that they felt they were\ncoming back.",
        "Q: So did you take anything special as a 14 year old.",
        "A: Maybe mother did. I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Just clothes and stuff.",
        "A: Well very little.",
        "Q: Little clothes.",
        "A: Very little. I mean whatever we took was something that you could walk fast with. You\ncould run if you had to and \u2014",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t take a lot of suitcases.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No, no suitcases at all. We just packed something little for us. Maybe mama packed\nsomething for the four of us. My brother was along with us. And all I remember is the train.",
        "Q: So you go to the train station. And you see a train filled with \u2014",

        "Q: To the station.",
        "A: To catch the train. I don\u2019t remember being on the train. I don\u2019t remember getting off the train.\nMy next scene in my mind 1s that we were all brought together in one place and then we were\ndistributed to different farm areas.",
        "Q: Now we\u2019re in France.",
        "A: Now we\u2019re in France. And we stayed with the farmers for a few days until they could relocate\nus. We were refugees in France. Now whether there was a committee like HIAS that was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nworking with the French I don\u2019t know. There must have been somebody working with the\nFrench at that time. And after we stayed there we were relocated to \u2014",
        "Q: The first location, do you know where that was?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was it in the south of France?",
        "A: It\u2019s south of France, yes. And we must have been very close to Spain because they relocated\nus to a town called St. Gaudens where you could see the Pyrenees from the house. So it\ncouldn\u2019t have been too far from where we were.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s still the four of you.",
        "A: There are still the four of us.",
        "Q: What were your parents\u2019 state of mind. Do you remember? Were they calm or was your\nmother frightened?",
        "A: You know I have often thought about this feeling of survival. I don\u2019t know what their state of\nmind was then, but I do know by what they did and what they accomplished that they only\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthought of survival for the children first and then for themselves and they were successful in\naccomplishing that.",
        "Q: What about your brother, Jack. Was he, do you remember what his state of mind was?",
        "A: He was very busy being unhappy because he had left a girlfriend that he loved very much\nbehind and he was already 21 years old. And he really wanted to go back to Belgium. I\nremember that. He and mother were having some violent words about all of that because he\neither wanted to go back to Belgium or being able to, for her to come with us. But all of that\ndidn\u2019t work out. So he was very busy being unhappy. But as far as doing anything, neither he\nand dad were allowed to do anything. None of us were allowed to do anything. We just waited.\nMostly. In that little apartment which was maybe you know a room and a half or something like\nthat. We were given food stamps and that\u2019s the only way we could get our food. We couldn\u2019t\nbuy it. We had to get it with food stamps. And I remember mother used to go get the little bit of\ngroceries, that we had.",
        "Q: Were there many other refugee families with you in that town?",
        "A: Not in the apartment where we were and I don\u2019t think that we were busy mixing socially with\nanyone because it was a bad time of our lives. We didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.",
        "Q: Did you see other refugee families?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember seeing other refugee families. Except we were arrested while we were in\nSt. Gaudens. And I\u2019m not sure why we were arrested at that time. We were arrested by the\nFrench and we were put in prison, right there in St. Gaudens. I always had the impression that it\nwas because mother\u2019s little town of Biala Podlaska might have been on the border between\nRussia and Poland. And perhaps at that time there were bad feelings between France and Russia.\nI\u2019m not sure. Or we might have been arrested because you know this was the Vichy government\nand perhaps that they were already working with the Nazis. Because the Nazis were really being\nvery clever I think now that I think about it. They didn\u2019t want to do too much to the Jews\nbecause they wanted the Jews to come back to where they were living before, because for the\nlongest time you would hear rumors. Come back to Brussels. They are not touching anybody.\nThey are not doing anything to anybody so my mother probably in 1941 and because she was a\nwoman she smuggled herself back to Belgium. And she did salvage some of the jewelry you\nknow. And she brought back her Sabbath candles which I have. She brought back my father\u2019s\ntallis ,which I have and she brought back my father\u2019s tfillin, the tfillin, which I still have also.\nBut she brought her diamonds, her jewelry. Not anything beside that. And she made it back.",
        "Q: Did she tell you where she was going?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you know?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Not til we were in the United States did I know that story. I didn\u2019t know where she had gone\nyeah. When, to go back to when, the time we were in prison in St. Gaudens, I remember they\nwalked us through the streets of St. Gaudens. And I remember the French people standing there\nand spitting at us. \u2019ve never forgotten that. And I thought to myself, I remember thinking what\ndid I do cause I didn\u2019t quite understand. Mother and I were sent to a special place in Toulouse\nand dad and my father were put in a French concentration camp for seven weeks.",
        "Q: Your father and your brother?",
        "A: And my brother, I\u2019m sorry. My brother and my father. And mother and I were released\nbecause I was 14 years old. She had a child with her. At that time that was a child. Today it\u2019s a\nganzer mensch. [ph - Yiddish] And I remember we went to visit my brother and my father and I\nremember that they came to the fence, also dressed in pajamas with wooden shoes on. They went\nto \u2014",
        "Q: You went to their prison?",
        "A: Yes. It was like a concentration camp. It had barracks outside.",
        "Q: Was that also in Toulouse?",
        "A: It must have been somewhere in that vicinity. Now the story goes in my family and I don\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nknow if, and I don\u2019t remember it but they seem to remember that mother told them that she with,\nsome of the jewelry that she had, she either bought off some of the principal there or the guard\nthere and after seven weeks my father and my brother were released and came back to St.\nGaudens. We had been in St. Gaudens all that time. So I thought that\u2019s probably true because I\ncan imagine that the French guards probably could be bought off at that time.",
        "Q: And what condition were your father and brother in when they got back?",
        "A: They had lost weight. It was a frightening experience for both of them.",
        "Q: Did they describe anything about their experience?",
        "A: If they did, they didn\u2019t do it in front of me. The protection was immense, it really was\nimmense. Even when I was a grown woman we didn\u2019t discuss it and this is really from memory,\ngoing back and seeing some of these images from the past in my mind.",
        "Q: What did you, you\u2019re 15, 16 years old, what did you do all day?",
        "A: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.",
        "Q: Did you get out and walk on your own?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No, that I wasn\u2019t even allowed to do in Belgium. We really did absolutely nothing for two\nyears that we were there. But my father had a first cousin in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh\nPennsylvania, whom he had never met before. And he wrote him as soon as the war broke out.\nHymie Morovitz. They owned the OK grocery stores in that area. Very comfortable financially\nand he decided that he was going to save this family. So my father went to Toulouse which was\nnot too far away and that\u2019s where the consulate was. And he would stay every day in front of the\nconsulate to see if there was any news. And they would have ways really of arresting people for\nwhat reason I don\u2019t know, because I remember my father telling me that he would hear the\nwhistles blow and he would run. But he would go back again in a day or two to see because of\ncourse we couldn\u2019t leave without a sponsor. And we finally got the papers in 1942.",
        "Q: What month in 42?",
        "A: We left in June.",
        "Q: These are papers for all four of you?",
        "A: For all four of us. We left in June and in July two months, two weeks later all of France was\noccupied by the Nazis. They took over all of France. And whoever was left was sent to\nconcentration camps. That\u2019s how lucky we were. We just got a \u2014 we were the last boat out of\nFrance with Jews coming to America.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with, or did your parents have any contact with the extended family\nwhen you were in this small town, your grandparents, your aunts, uncles.",
        "A: If they did, I did not know. I do know that my grandparents both died. I don\u2019t know how. I do\nknow I have a cousin, my father\u2019s sister left her children with nuns during the war. And I do see\nmy cousin now. She comes to see me. I go to see her. And my brother. My mother lost all three\nbrothers. In the war with some of, so their wives and children. She had one sister left who went\nto Israel.",
        "Q: But the ones she lost had stayed in Belgium? Is that what you\u2019re saying?",
        "A: No, everybody ran. Everybody ran.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: In the small town",
        "A: No, none of them were. Why everybody went in different directions, I don\u2019t, I honestly don\u2019t\nknow. But they did.",

        "A: Marseilles. And that was on the Petain government.",
        "Q: Marshall Petain.",
        "A: And the Vichy, I mean they were really very helpful to the Germans. They did everything \u2014",
        "Q: So when you saw them, the Vichy people and saw them in uniform, police and so forth, what\nwere your thoughts?",
        "A: You know it\u2019s amazing because I see that in children today. We have the ability to unfocus\nwhen we are afraid. I see children do that today. They act like they don\u2019t see and they don\u2019t\nhear and I must have done the same thing. I just, I adored my father and I remember holding his\nhand a lot.",
        "Q: When you were out on the street \u2014",
        "A: Mm hm, mm hm. The boat we were on I remember the conditions were pretty bad because\nthey where they keep the luggage. They call that the hole I guess. They had fixed up because\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nnobody had luggage really. So they had fixed that with cots all over the place. I might be wrong\nbut I remember that it was so small. It was only about 2500 tons the boat. And it took us six\nweeks to get to the United States. I do remember being very ill because we were walking a lot\nand we stopped in Casablanca.",
        "Q: What was the name of the boat, do you know?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know. And I would love to know really.",

        "Q: Sea sick.",
        "A: Sea sick. Yeah I remember that. Otherwise the rest of it is locked out pretty much. I\nremember we stopped in Casablanca and we must have stayed there for a couple of days. I guess\nto replenish on the boat. My father who had a wonderful sense of humor and he was trying\nobviously to make me feel better was negotiating with an Arab trying to sell me. (laughs) I still\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nremember that and I remember being so scared. (laughs) and I can just see him talking. My\nfather did have a wonderful sense of humor. And after that, from there we went to Vera Cruz.",
        "Q: Do you have any other memories of Casablanca besides the one incident of \u2014",
        "A: I think we walked around a lot. We did some sight-seeing with the markets. I remember that.\nWe walked to the markets so we must have been there a couple of days.",
        "Q: By that time did you have any more knowledge of what was happening in Europe or what\nHitler was doing? Did you know about the conditions and what was happening to Jews?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You did not?",
        "A: No and by that time I was already 16 but as I said a very young 16. Very young 16. It was\nnot a time in my time anyway where the family would sit as the do today and talk and explain\nwhy we are in this situation, why we are doing what we\u2019re doing.",
        "Q: You never asked.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: And I never asked. I think almost didn\u2019t dare ask. (laughs) So perhaps it was not like that in\nevery family. But it was like that in my family. At the time growing up, I didn\u2019t ask any\nquestions and my brother because we really were not that close until we got older.",
        "Q: When you were on the boat with all the other refugees, did they sit around and talk about\nwhat was happening and having to leave home?",
        "A: [have a very lonely feeling. A very frightened feeling. By that time I was in my teens, but I\nwasn\u2019t doing what teens were supposed to be doing at that time. I wasn\u2019t growing up and I didn\u2019t\nhave a chance to grow up. Actually I lost all of my teens here. All of them. I mean I didn\u2019t have\nthe teen years that a teenager will have from the time she is 14 until at the time I got married.",

        "A: Well you know when I went back there as a married woman, I realized my roots were in the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: But I meant when you were a child, a young woman, a young girl?",
        "A: Did I feel \u2014",
        "Q: Did you feel like you were leaving your country?",
        "A: No, I felt relief, I felt relief that we were leaving because I mean even though I tried not to\nknow what was going on, you were bound to know what was going on and it that there was real\nfright about whether we were going to get out of this alive or not. And now that I think about my\nparents really it was a miracle. It was a miracle what they did. And it was a miracle what my\nfamily in Pittsburgh did because it was just as I said two weeks later that the Germans were, took\nover all of France. And arrested the rest of the Jews.",
        "Q: After Casablanca you get back on the boat.",
        "A: We get back on the boat.",
        "Q: And your next stop?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: And we stop in Veracruz. And we must have spent the day there too cause I remember they\nmust have had some kind of a festival because there were young woman in their full dresses and\nyoung men. And I remember somebody telling me that if you wore a flower on your left ear you\nwere not married. If you wore it on your right ear you were. These were the things that a young\n16 year old was interested in. So we didn\u2019t stay as long in Veracruz as we did in Casablanca.\nBut it was six weeks that much I know, before we finally came to New York.",
        "Q: You landed in New York.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: I didn\u2019t know a word of English.",
        "Q: What did that country mean to you?",
        "A: Well it meant that I understood that we were safe, that we were not going to be killed and that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwe had a chance for a future. Whether I thought that at that time, I\u2019m not sure. But I\u2019m sure\nthinking of it today, at this time. (laughs) I remember my mother, God bless her, cause she still\nhad some of her diamonds with her and I guess she didn\u2019t want to declare all of them. So I\nremember her putting one down in my pocket and she said shh, don\u2019t say anything. That\nfrightened me. And that\u2019s why I remember that. It really frightened me. I was very scared.",
        "Q: What did the Statue of Liberty mean to you when you saw it? Anything special?",
        "A: No. No, no. It didn\u2019t at that time, though I must tell you that ever since I came to America, I\nworship this country because I realize and I mean this most sincerely. What this country did for\nus and the freedoms that we had which we never had in Belgium when we lived there before the\nwar. Because we were certainly branded as Jewish.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to that time. What restrictions did you have before the war? Yes, you were\nJews.",
        "A: And I knew I was different. I felt very different from everybody else.",
        "Q: Was there anything that you wanted to do that you couldn\u2019t do because you were Jewish?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t think of doing anything (laughs) that was not permitted. The, it\u2019s really interesting\nthat the questions in today\u2019s world can be answered that way but not in my world.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: You\u2019re on the boat and you see the Statue of Liberty and you dock and \u2014",
        "A: It must have been a very strange feeling for me also at that time. I mean I was in a strange\ncountry. I didn\u2019t speak a word of English. I hadn\u2019t been to school in two years. And \u2014",
        "Q: Who met you at the boat, your relative?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. And I\u2019m trying to remember if daddy\u2019s cousin must have met him at the boat\nand taken us back to Squirrel Hill. And we stayed with my relatives for a few days or maybe\nlonger.",
        "Q: This was in Philadelphia.",
        "A: No this was in Pittsburgh.",
        "Q: Excuse me.",
        "A: In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. And they lived in a community called Squirrel Hill. And dad\nmust have tried to look immediately as to where we were going to go settle down. Because for\nsome reason they picked McKeesport, Pennsylvania. How long it took him to go into business.\nMy dad had a wonderful personality. He and Jack went to New York to buy merchandise, leather\ngoods, the handbags, suitcases, anything that\u2019s made out of leather goods. Rented a place on\nMain street in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. And I understand that some of the wholesalers loved\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndad so much that they sold him on credit. In those days people did that. And then we rented an\napartment. And I went to school. And that was the worst day of my life. That I do remember\nbecause mother God bless her, put me it must have been a high school class at 16. I didn\u2019t speak\na word of English and I was told swim or sink. (laughs) And, but everybody was wonderful.\nThey really were wonderful. And for some reason I still remember the first question. This\ncountry was so isolated I guess there at that time, they wanted to know if we had, real floors. We\nwere living on dirt floors. (laughs) Did we have commodes. Did we have running water. And I\nremember being asked those first questions. But I learned the language very quickly.",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "Q: What were the teachers like? Were they helpful to you?",
        "A: Yes they were. They were very nice. They obviously because I do remember being miserable,\nand particularly I had never dated before in my life. And then all of a sudden I was asked to date.\nAnd this was very, very foreign to me. And it didn\u2019t work for me because I really didn\u2019t know\nhow to act. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I do remember being very disturbed by that facet of life\nin the United States. But I adjusted and \u2014",

        "A: By that time I was almost 17 cause my birthday was in November.",
        "Q: Did your teachers ask you about what you had gone through? Did they ask you those kind of\nquestions?",
        "A: No, because my language capacity was very low and I don\u2019t think I could have answered\nthose questions at that time. Now that I think about it, 1t must have also been a very lonesome,\nlonely feeling and like I said you know between those ages, I mean I just lost that time in my life\ncompletely.",
        "Q: Besides the other kids asking you questions, about what life was like, were they friendly to\nyou?",
        "A: Yes, but it was a very difficult adjustment, very difficult adjustment for me. I was very lucky\nthat I married the kind of man that I married. I really was so lucky because I was very insecure,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfrightened by many things, many things frightened me. And it took me, I don\u2019t know that I ever\nadjusted during my school years. I did graduate from high school, but I don\u2019t ever remember\nbeing at peace in high school because it was a different country, it was a different style. And the\nkids here they had a lot more independence than I had had. So it \u2014 but I was very popular in my\nsenior year. I remember that.",

        "Q: Did she make friends?",
        "A: After a while but she was so busy working with dad and working in the store that I don\u2019t\nthink she spent too much time in that direction. Her life changed completely from the life that\nshe had in Belgium. She was a queen in Belgium really and she had to turn to a completely\ndifferent life style and she did. She did.",
        "Q: Your father\u2019s business was successful?",
        "A: Yes it must have been. Since he had the money, well , no, no I mustn\u2019t say that. It was\nsuccessful. And it would have continued to be successful except that being a Jewish mother, her\nson got married and he moved to Texas. And mother just couldn\u2019t stand it.",

        "Q: In the store. And then.",
        "A: Helping my father. My brother met a young woman from Kaufman, Texas and her first cousin\nwas my husband. And he lived in Athens, Texas which was about 35 miles away. When she and\nJack were engaged, she wanted me to come to Texas and meet the family and I came on the\ntrain, I remember, to Dallas, Texas. And there were four sisters and every Sunday cause there\nwas nothing else to do they all had dry goods stores in the little towns. The four sisters would get\ntogether with their children and bring food or whatever and meet on Sundays and then go back\nhome. So on one Sunday I went with the family to Athens. And there was my husband Reuben.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd the story is that he fell in love with me. The moment he saw me (laughs). And it was\ninteresting actually. We didn\u2019t date very much. My mother was very anxious for me to get\nmarried. I was already 20 and 21 and I wasn\u2019t married yet. So there was an engagement party in\nMcKeesport Pennsylvania for my brother and his future wife. And Reuben decided to come and\nwe talked and then I went to New York with my father. I remember to cause he was going to\nColumbia law school. And I went to New York with my dad to help him buy inventory. And I\nmet with Reuben again and he asked me to marry him. And it must have been instant because we\nhad a beautiful marriage. We really did have a beautiful marriage, for 61 years.",

        "A: Yes, unh hunh. And how he came to Silven, I really have no idea because his brother in\nBelgium kept the name Zylberstejn until the day he died which was just a few years ago.",
        "Q: So did your name then become Regine Silven.",
        "A: Silven, Regine Silven married to Reuben Ginsberg.",
        "Q: How did you feel about that?",
        "A: Had no feelings about it one way or another. If I did, it wasn\u2019t discussed with me. You know,\nit really wasn\u2019t something. You know you accept it, the facts as they came because you didn\u2019t\nquestion. I mean they didn\u2019t ask me what my opinion was. And that\u2019s just the way it was, that\u2019s\nall there was to it. And \u2014",
        "Q: The war was over in 45. Do you remember, have any memories of hearing that the war was\nover?",
        "A: Ihave memories of hearing of the war being over. There is one thing that I must tell you that\nmy brother enlisted in the army when he was here. He became a captain and he was sent back to\nBelgium and lived in our home in Belgium as a captain of the American army. And I thought\nthat was just absolutely wonderful.",
        "Q: When was this?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: During the war, during the war. Not after the war, during the war. And I remember his\nwriting us that he was in the house and he was living in the house with other officers and I\nthought that was absolutely wonderful. What else do I remember?",
        "Q: Was he being used as an interpreter or \u2014",
        "A: Yes, actually he was in intelligence. Yes he was in intelligence cause he had had a college\neducation. He was -- and his French was absolutely superb. He sounded like Charles Boyer. And\nhe had his charm also. He did.",
        "Q: Did he bring back anything from the house or did he say what condition it was.",
        "A: You know actually I had, not from the house because I think everything was pretty well\ndestroyed inside the house. But he brought me back and I still have it, a bracelet that has all the\ncommunities in Belgium, Rabon, I remember and the east coast, the names of the important\nprovinces. And that was a long time ago. He brought it back to me in 1945, I guess.",
        "Q: And just to repeat when you were settled here you did not really talk about or did you talk\nabout to your parents what you had all gone through?",
        "A: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Just turned the page \u2014",
        "A: Never. We turned it completely because mother was never happy, I don\u2019t think in the United\nStates. She had a difficult time adjusting and my father had his first heart attack at 50 and mother\nwas so afraid of losing him that she didn\u2019t allow him to, out of her sight. And I think that\nhappened quite a bit in those days also, between husband and wife. So they were not, they never\nadjusted. I think it\u2019s very difficult in later age to adjust to a different country.",
        "Q: I mean they came in their 40s, they were in their 40s.",
        "A: Mm hm, which shouldn\u2019t be too bad really, but they had a good life. They had a very good\nlife in Brussels. And from then on, it was a struggle. From the day they left Brussels it was a\nstruggle for them. And I do think and I hope they can hear me that they show such courage, such\ncourage, both of them really of survival. That it\u2019s mind boggling sometimes. I mean do we still\nhave that in us and I hope we do. I really hope we do. Because I think when you\u2019re faced with\nthat kind of crisis you really don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to react. But they just were\nincredibly courageous.",
        "Q: You graduated from high school, worked with your father and then met your future husband.",

        "Q: Had you thought of going to college or was that not on the horizon?",
        "A: That was not on the horizon. It was not even discussed at that time. Why, I\u2019m not sure.\nMaybe mother and dad needed me there.",
        "Q: I was going to say they might have needed you in the store.",
        "A: I think they might have needed me.",
        "Q: And then you got married and where did you live? What year did you get married?",
        "A: 1947 and Reuben was in law school and we lived in the little community in upper state New\nYork. I think it was called Nyack. I\u2019m not sure. Nyack. And we lived in an army barracks and I\nmust say that was the happiest time of our lives. My mother came to visit me and the first thing\nshe said was oy veyzmer. His mother came to visit me, both of us and she said it\u2019s beautiful.\nPll never forget that. But it was wonderful. I would drive in with Reuben and I would take\ncourses at Columbia University while he was in law school. And you know I adapted to\nmarriage very beautifully because he was a very kind and patient and understanding man and I\nthink the security and I don\u2019t mean financial security. I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Emotional.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Emotional security that I have today is really due to him, it really is due to him. Because I\nwas a pretty messed up 21 year. I was afraid of everything. Thunder. Flying. You name it.\nGoing into a store. And buying something. Everything scared me really. But over the years, it\u2019s\nworked.",
        "Q: Do you attribute those fears when you were young to your childhood \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. And I had them for a long time in my married life. I can see, because\nwe had actually two sets of children because there is 14 years difference between my son and my\nyoungest daughter. So that we had my son and Debby and then Jackie and Lisa. And these two\nare not quite as hyper. These two, the first two.",
        "Q: So your first child was born when?",
        "A: My first child was born. I went home to mother because we were living at Camp Shanks,\nactually was the name of the place Camp Shanks. And there was a military camp at one time but\nin my ninth month. The beginning of my ninth month I went home to mother and Reuben must\nhave had a feeling because \u2014",
        "Q: Was he still in law school?",
        "A: He was still in law school, but he came flying home on the evening that I went into labor. He\njust had a feeling. And Michael was born. He was such a Texan, my husband that he always\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwanted to he was sorry he hadn\u2019t brought a little dirt from Texas to put on the table. He was a\ndevoted Texan. And Michael was born in McKeesport Pennsylvania.",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: Michael is 61 years old, so that would be 1948. I was so, so naive. I remember. We had a\nneighbor at Camp Shanks who explained to me at what period of time I couldn\u2019t get pregnant. It\ndidn\u2019t work. (laughs)",
        "Q: Speaking about 1948, what did Israel mean to you then? A large part of your awareness?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that I was brought, broaden in enough really to think about that part of the\nworld. I didn\u2019t think about Israel until my oldest daughter went over there, when she was in high\nschool and got caught in the Israeli war. And from then on I think Israel started having meaning\nfor me.",
        "Q: What was the reaction of your parents when the war was over and the news came out about\nwhat had happened to the six million Jews and so forth?",
        "A: You know I think they must have known about it. Because why did they want to run like that\nif they hadn\u2019t known what was happening.",
        "Q: The full extent of what had happened.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Probably not the full extent, but I think they must have known about the extermination\nbecause it happened before, even. I think rumors have a way of you know coming around like a\nnewspaper. They must have heard, maybe what was going on in Poland. I think that that was\ngoing on before 1940. They must have heard about the ghettoes. I don\u2019t think they heard the full\nextent of 1t. Of what I saw in the museum for example, yesterday. The outrage of the Americans\nand the British when they came, what they saw. I\u2019m not sure that they saw, they knew it to that\nextent. They knew that they had to save themselves and their children. Now why did they know\nthat. I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: My question was what was their reactions when the full extent came out after the war was\nover. The pictures \u2014",
        "A: It was again something that was not discussed. With me. Which I find very interesting.",
        "Q: Too painful.",
        "A: I guess because they lost so many members of their family. There. And that\u2019s the way they\nlost them.",
        "Q: You had your first child and then how long did you stay in the east. Or your husband\ngraduated from law school.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well Reuben graduated from law school and nobody would hire him in Texas. They all told\nhim to go west. And \u2014",
        "Q: Why wouldn\u2019t they?",
        "A: He just couldn\u2019t find a job. But he had a sister who lived in Tulsa and she found him a job\nwith an attorney there and we moved to Tulsa with Michael and we lived there for about a year\nbut Reuben really wanted to be in Texas. So we came back to Texas and you know those were\nthe days that you really were living on a shoestring. But parents were always helpful. His\nparents and my parents and he finally found a job in a lawyer\u2019s office who gave him space for\ntyping for the lawyer. So he typed a lot of his material and he didn\u2019t have to pay rent. And he\ngrew very successful after that.",
        "Q: What town were you living in?",
        "A: What town. Dallas. We were. We always lived in Dallas, yeah. That was in the 50s when we\nmoved back to Dallas. And then we had Debby. And we lived in the little house in Dallas. And I\nmust say those were the happiest years of our lives really. It was not complicated and then we\nmoved to our big home that I\u2019m still in right now. I started getting busy myself. I had a career. I\nwas an art dealer. And in the 70s I had an artist friend who came to me who wanted to open a\ngallery. And I was interested. We worked very hard. We were never in the red. After about five\nyears, I sold out to her. And Reuben who was very wise at that time, this was in the early 80s,\ninsisted that I go back into business. And insisted on setting me up again but I worked out of my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhouse. And at that time is when I really made all the wonderful contacts that I made and have a\nwonderful art collection.",
        "Q: These are paintings or sculpture or \u2014",
        "A: Both. Truly a wonderful, mostly contemporary art and I\u2019m delighted because I think I have\nquite a legacy for my children. I also when I stopped doing that, I became interested in Golden\nAcres, which is a Jewish nursing home in Dallas. We formed an organization called friends of\nGolden Acres for the renovation that was very needed in the home at that time. Ethel Frankfurt\nand I who is now Ethel Zale, she married a Zale. Managed, we built such a successful\norganization, we managed to raise over the years that we were together about a million and a half\nand we renovated several floors really in the home. And I was president, I really loved it at the\ntime. I did that in honor of my mother and father who both were in the home. I also was bas\nmitzvahed in 1992. In honor of my dad cause he had died and I wanted to do that for him. So\nthat even though I didn\u2019t go to college, I managed to have two wonderful careers, one that I\u2019m\nstill enjoying because I love the art in my house. And I have some very good art. And that\u2019s one\nof the reasons I\u2019m not selling my house because I get up every morning and it\u2019s still\nrejuvenating. It really is reyuvenating and my family loves to come over and I\u2019m still very close\nto -- Ihave a wonderful family. Reuben passed away a year and a half ago. And they have just,\neveryone should be as lucky to have the kind of attention that I have had. Really. It, \u2019'm blessed.\nI am truly blessed and as I said starting in the late 70s from the time I went into the art business\nand going on to what we did for Golden Acres has been very rewarding. Very, very rewarding\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand I\u2019m just so happy that P\u2019ve had that time to have to have two wonderful experiences later in\nmy life.",
        "Q: Can we talk a little bit about your thoughts and your feelings now about what you went\nthrough. When your children were the age that you were when you had to leave quickly and\nbeing in France and that, 14, 15, 16, 17 year old age bracket. When your children were that age\ndid it bring back memories for you. Did you relate?",
        "A: Gail, it did not because as I told you when I started, this is truly the first time that I have spent\nany amount of time talking about my growing up. It almost seems as if my life didn\u2019t start for\nme until I got married and moved to Texas.",
        "Q: Two parts to your life.",
        "A: Yes, two parts to my life. And my best memories are from that time on. In fact when I went\nback to Belgium with two of my girls, I wanted to show them the place where I lived. And I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, it was condemned. For what reason I don\u2019t know. So there were no\nmemories there.",
        "Q: My point was it didn\u2019t trigger when your children were that age. It didn\u2019t trigger memories of\nwhat you had to go through?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Only because I was too young really to be able to impart those kind of memories at their age\nto them. And it was a time of my life that obviously I didn\u2019t want to think about. And I didn\u2019t. It\naffected me emotionally very badly, very badly and I think because it affected me emotionally so\nbadly that I just closed it off.",
        "Q: Where your parents aware that it affected you so much?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that psychologically people of that time thought about those terms. Because if\nthey did they would have sent me for counseling. That isn\u2019t anything that occurred to them\nreally. Life was simple.",
        "Q: Did you parents become more religious when they came here or less religious?",
        "A: Actually it was difficult to keep kosher in Dallas, Texas. Mama didn\u2019t like the kosher\nbutcher. He was very mean. I remember that. The only time that mama kept kosher which really\ntickled me, holidays. Jewish holidays we had to be kosher and Passover we had to change dishes,\nthe whole time that she lived in the United States. It was all right not to the rest of the week. but\nmy sweet memories of Passover was that the day before you were supposed to get not the day,\nbut the day that you were supposed to get rid of the hametz, [ph] mother always had for lunch,\nliver and potatoes, boiled potatoes and we had to come for lunch. And that was the end of the\nhametz [ph]. After that we started Passover. And you know I think it is so wonderful to keep up\nthose traditions because it stays in the mind of children. Those are the things that really remain\nwith them and how important it is. And I do think today that the Jewish institutions are trying to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngo back to that. I know that our temple has changed tremendously in their practices of Judaism.\nThey are catering to the younger people now. Because I think they feel there\u2019s no hope, once we\nare set in our ways.",
        "Q: Do you remember the Eichmann trial at all? When Adolf Eichmann was --",
        "A: Well that was already when I was grown up. Yeah I got emotionally involved in that. Yes I\ndid get emotionally involved in that and I remember I watched it. In the sense of what happened\nthrough them because of them. I have several friends who were still living, who was survivors.\nThey are the ones who really went through Dachau and the horrors of the concentration camp.\nThe experiments, the nakedness, the shaving of the hair, everything and but I told my children\ntoday at lunch that I really feel, as badly emotionally it affected me, in life it made me strong.\nMy experiences during that period. Giving me a strength that I don\u2019t even see in my children. I\nmean I really feel strong in crises. It\u2019s very interesting. I change completely in a crisis. I don\u2019t\nscream, I don\u2019t cry. I just internalize it and I become strong. And I\u2019m grateful for that. And I\nreally think it\u2019s because of my war experiences. Because I can\u2019t place it anyplace else really,\nthat kind of strength.",

        "A: No because unfortunately there was not a good situation between his wife and my mother\nwho lived around the corner, which affected our relationship. The good old Jewish story. So that\nwe didn\u2019t have much time together to talk and I regret that very much really. And I\u2019m very\nserious that today my friends who still have husbands, who still have a brother, I\u2019m like a\npreacher. I really am, Gail.

        "A: Exactly. I mean don\u2019t do this and don\u2019t do that. You\u2019re going to get hurt. Really, really to the\npoint I think where they resented it. And, I think my youngest child probably didn\u2019t go through\nall that and she\u2019s the one that has the most even temperament. Of the four children. No it\u2019s true.\nTerribly protective.

That was one of the things when I came to the United States that I\nhad never seen before where blacks were not allowed to drink from the same fountain or use the\nsame bathroom. I really was incensed about that. I remember that because I had never seen\nanything like that. I wasn\u2019t there when the Jews were deprived also of doing that because we\nhad left already. So I had never seen that before. And I remember telling Reuben, how can you\naccept anything like that. You know like that. I really remember having some very violent\nreactions to that.",

        "A: As I told you when I started this and when Jesse asked me if I would do this, is the time I\nstarted thinking about it. I don\u2019t think about it. My best memories of my life started in, maybe\nnot right away in 1947 but from the time I got married. And I\u2019m not just saying that.

But there\nwere many Jews who didn\u2019t believe that they would be touched. And obviously my parents\ndidn\u2019t either because they waited until the Germans attacked Belgium. But my father was very\nwise. We didn\u2019t find that out until we were here. And I didn\u2019t find that out until, before my\nbrother died, that my father in the 30s wired $10,000 to the Chase Bank in New York. And that\nmoney was here when we came to the United States. That was very wise of him. And $10,000\nwas a lot of money at that time.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: It was sometimes in the 30s. Because by the time we came in 1942 apparently his hand\nwriting, my brother told me had changed a little bit. They were giving him a hard time. But he\ndid collect the money and he opened up a leather goods store in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.",
        "A: I might have heard the name but I think I was protected from hearing too much being afraid\nabout too much, because again the atmosphere and the thought must have been at that time that it\nwasn\u2019t going to be so easy for the Nazis to overtake Europe the way they did. I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s\nwhat was on their minds because I mean we really ran the day they attacked Belgium.",

        "A: Now we\u2019re in France. And we stayed with the farmers for a few days until they could relocate\nus. We were refugees in France. Now whether there was a committee like HIAS that was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nworking with the French I don\u2019t know. There must have been somebody working with the\nFrench at that time. And after we stayed there we were relocated to \u2014",

        "A: It\u2019s south of France, yes. And we must have been very close to Spain because they relocated\nus to a town called St. Gaudens where you could see the Pyrenees from the house. So it\ncouldn\u2019t have been too far from where we were.",

I\nremember that. He and mother were having some violent words about all of that because he\neither wanted to go back to Belgium or being able to, for her to come with us. But all of that\ndidn\u2019t work out. So he was very busy being unhappy. But as far as doing anything, neither he\nand dad were allowed to do anything. None of us were allowed to do anything. We just waited.\nMostly. In that little apartment which was maybe you know a room and a half or something like\nthat. We were given food stamps and that\u2019s the only way we could get our food. We couldn\u2019t\nbuy it. We had to get it with food stamps. And I remember mother used to go get the little bit of\ngroceries, that we had.",
        "A: Not in the apartment where we were and I don\u2019t think that we were busy mixing socially with\nanyone because it was a bad time of our lives. We didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember seeing other refugee families. Except we were arrested while we were in\nSt. Gaudens. And I\u2019m not sure why we were arrested at that time. We were arrested by the\nFrench and we were put in prison, right there in St. Gaudens. I always had the impression that it\nwas because mother\u2019s little town of Biala Podlaska might have been on the border between\nRussia and Poland. And perhaps at that time there were bad feelings between France and Russia.\nI\u2019m not sure. Or we might have been arrested because you know this was the Vichy government\nand perhaps that they were already working with the Nazis. Because the Nazis were really being\nvery clever I think now that I think about it. They didn\u2019t want to do too much to the Jews\nbecause they wanted the Jews to come back to where they were living before, because for the\nlongest time you would hear rumors. Come back to Brussels. They are not touching anybody.\nThey are not doing anything to anybody so my mother probably in 1941 and because she was a\nwoman she smuggled herself back to Belgium. And she did salvage some of the jewelry you\nknow. And she brought back her Sabbath candles which I have. She brought back my father\u2019s\ntallis ,which I have and she brought back my father\u2019s tfillin, the tfillin, which I still have also.\nBut she brought her diamonds, her jewelry. Not anything beside that. And she made it back.",

When, to go back to when, the time we were in prison in St. Gaudens, I remember they\nwalked us through the streets of St. Gaudens. And I remember the French people standing there\nand spitting at us. \u2019ve never forgotten that. And I thought to myself, I remember thinking what\ndid I do cause I didn\u2019t quite understand. Mother and I were sent to a special place in Toulouse\nand dad and my father were put in a French concentration camp for seven weeks.",
        "A: And my brother, I\u2019m sorry. My brother and my father. And mother and I were released\nbecause I was 14 years old. She had a child with her. At that time that was a child. Today it\u2019s a\nganzer mensch. [ph - Yiddish] And I remember we went to visit my brother and my father and I\nremember that they came to the fence, also dressed in pajamas with wooden shoes on. They went\nto \u2014",
        "A: Yes. It was like a concentration camp. It had barracks outside.",

Now the story goes in my family and I don\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nknow if, and I don\u2019t remember it but they seem to remember that mother told them that she with,\nsome of the jewelry that she had, she either bought off some of the principal there or the guard\nthere and after seven weeks my father and my brother were released and came back to St.\nGaudens. We had been in St. Gaudens all that time. So I thought that\u2019s probably true because I\ncan imagine that the French guards probably could be bought off at that time.",
        "A: They had lost weight. It was a frightening experience for both of them.",
        "A: If they did, they didn\u2019t do it in front of me. The protection was immense, it really was\nimmense. Even when I was a grown woman we didn\u2019t discuss it and this is really from memory,\ngoing back and seeing some of these images from the past in my mind.",

But my father had a first cousin in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh\nPennsylvania, whom he had never met before. And he wrote him as soon as the war broke out.\nHymie Morovitz. They owned the OK grocery stores in that area. Very comfortable financially\nand he decided that he was going to save this family. So my father went to Toulouse which was\nnot too far away and that\u2019s where the consulate was. And he would stay every day in front of the\nconsulate to see if there was any news. And they would have ways really of arresting people for\nwhat reason I don\u2019t know, because I remember my father telling me that he would hear the\nwhistles blow and he would run. But he would go back again in a day or two to see because of\ncourse we couldn\u2019t leave without a sponsor. And we finally got the papers in 1942.",

And now that I think about my\nparents really it was a miracle. It was a miracle what they did.

        "A: Silven, Regine Silven married to Reuben Ginsberg.",
        "A: Had no feelings about it one way or another. If I did, it wasn\u2019t discussed with me. You know,\nit really wasn\u2019t something. You know you accept it, the facts as they came because you didn\u2019t\nquestion. I mean they didn\u2019t ask me what my opinion was. And that\u2019s just the way it was, that\u2019s\nall there was to it. And \u2014",
        "A: Ihave memories of hearing of the war being over. There is one thing that I must tell you that\nmy brother enlisted in the army when he was here. He became a captain and he was sent back to\nBelgium and lived in our home in Belgium as a captain of the American army. And I thought\nthat was just absolutely wonderful.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: During the war, during the war. Not after the war, during the war. And I remember his\nwriting us that he was in the house and he was living in the house with other officers and I\nthought that was absolutely wonderful. What else do I remember?",
        "A: Yes, actually he was in intelligence. Yes he was in intelligence cause he had had a college\neducation. He was -- and his French was absolutely superb. He sounded like Charles Boyer. And\nhe had his charm also. He did.",
        "A: You know actually I had, not from the house because I think everything was pretty well\ndestroyed inside the house. But he brought me back and I still have it, a bracelet that has all the\ncommunities in Belgium, Rabon, I remember and the east coast, the names of the important\nprovinces. And that was a long time ago. He brought it back to me in 1945, I guess.",
        "A: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Never. We turned it completely because mother was never happy, I don\u2019t think in the United\nStates. She had a difficult time adjusting and my father had his first heart attack at 50 and mother\nwas so afraid of losing him that she didn\u2019t allow him to, out of her sight. And I think that\nhappened quite a bit in those days also, between husband and wife. So they were not, they never\nadjusted. I think it\u2019s very difficult in later age to adjust to a different country.",
        "A: Mm hm, which shouldn\u2019t be too bad really, but they had a good life. They had a very good\nlife in Brussels. And from then on, it was a struggle. From the day they left Brussels it was a\nstruggle for them. And I do think and I hope they can hear me that they show such courage, such\ncourage, both of them really of survival. That it\u2019s mind boggling sometimes. I mean do we still\nhave that in us and I hope we do. I really hope we do. Because I think when you\u2019re faced with\nthat kind of crisis you really don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to react. But they just were\nincredibly courageous.",
        "A: I graduated at 18 yeah. I must have met Reuben when I was 19 for the first time. Mm hm.\nAnd at that time I was still a very protected young woman.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: That was not on the horizon. It was not even discussed at that time. Why, I\u2019m not sure.\nMaybe mother and dad needed me there.",
        "A: I think they might have needed me.",
        "A: 1947 and Reuben was in law school and we lived in the little community in upper state New\nYork. I think it was called Nyack. I\u2019m not sure. Nyack. And we lived in an army barracks and I\nmust say that was the happiest time of our lives. My mother came to visit me and the first thing\nshe said was oy veyzmer. His mother came to visit me, both of us and she said it\u2019s beautiful.\nPll never forget that. But it was wonderful. I would drive in with Reuben and I would take\ncourses at Columbia University while he was in law school. And you know I adapted to\nmarriage very beautifully because he was a very kind and patient and understanding man and I\nthink the security and I don\u2019t mean financial security. I mean \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Emotional security that I have today is really due to him, it really is due to him. Because I\nwas a pretty messed up 21 year. I was afraid of everything. Thunder. Flying. You name it.\nGoing into a store. And buying something. Everything scared me really. But over the years, it\u2019s\nworked.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. And I had them for a long time in my married life. I can see, because\nwe had actually two sets of children because there is 14 years difference between my son and my\nyoungest daughter. So that we had my son and Debby and then Jackie and Lisa. And these two\nare not quite as hyper. These two, the first two.",
        "A: My first child was born. I went home to mother because we were living at Camp Shanks,\nactually was the name of the place Camp Shanks. And there was a military camp at one time but\nin my ninth month. The beginning of my ninth month I went home to mother and Reuben must\nhave had a feeling because \u2014",
        "A: He was still in law school, but he came flying home on the evening that I went into labor. He\njust had a feeling. And Michael was born. He was such a Texan, my husband that he always\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwanted to he was sorry he hadn\u2019t brought a little dirt from Texas to put on the table. He was a\ndevoted Texan. And Michael was born in McKeesport Pennsylvania.",
        "A: Michael is 61 years old, so that would be 1948. I was so, so naive. I remember. We had a\nneighbor at Camp Shanks who explained to me at what period of time I couldn\u2019t get pregnant. It\ndidn\u2019t work. (laughs)",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that I was brought, broaden in enough really to think about that part of the\nworld. I didn\u2019t think about Israel until my oldest daughter went over there, when she was in high\nschool and got caught in the Israeli war. And from then on I think Israel started having meaning\nfor me.",
        "A: You know I think they must have known about it. Because why did they want to run like that\nif they hadn\u2019t known what was happening.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Probably not the full extent, but I think they must have known about the extermination\nbecause it happened before, even. I think rumors have a way of you know coming around like a\nnewspaper. They must have heard, maybe what was going on in Poland. I think that that was\ngoing on before 1940. They must have heard about the ghettoes. I don\u2019t think they heard the full\nextent of 1t. Of what I saw in the museum for example, yesterday. The outrage of the Americans\nand the British when they came, what they saw. I\u2019m not sure that they saw, they knew it to that\nextent. They knew that they had to save themselves and their children. Now why did they know\nthat. I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: It was again something that was not discussed. With me. Which I find very interesting.",
        "A: I guess because they lost so many members of their family. There. And that\u2019s the way they\nlost them.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well Reuben graduated from law school and nobody would hire him in Texas. They all told\nhim to go west. And \u2014",
        "A: He just couldn\u2019t find a job. But he had a sister who lived in Tulsa and she found him a job\nwith an attorney there and we moved to Tulsa with Michael and we lived there for about a year\nbut Reuben really wanted to be in Texas. So we came back to Texas and you know those were\nthe days that you really were living on a shoestring. But parents were always helpful. His\nparents and my parents and he finally found a job in a lawyer\u2019s office who gave him space for\ntyping for the lawyer. So he typed a lot of his material and he didn\u2019t have to pay rent. And he\ngrew very successful after that.",
        "A: What town. Dallas. We were. We always lived in Dallas, yeah. That was in the 50s when we\nmoved back to Dallas. And then we had Debby. And we lived in the little house in Dallas. And I\nmust say those were the happiest years of our lives really. It was not complicated and then we\nmoved to our big home that I\u2019m still in right now. I started getting busy myself. I had a career. I\nwas an art dealer. And in the 70s I had an artist friend who came to me who wanted to open a\ngallery. And I was interested. We worked very hard. We were never in the red. After about five\nyears, I sold out to her. And Reuben who was very wise at that time, this was in the early 80s,\ninsisted that I go back into business. And insisted on setting me up again but I worked out of my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhouse. And at that time is when I really made all the wonderful contacts that I made and have a\nwonderful art collection.",
        "A: Both. Truly a wonderful, mostly contemporary art and I\u2019m delighted because I think I have\nquite a legacy for my children. I also when I stopped doing that, I became interested in Golden\nAcres, which is a Jewish nursing home in Dallas. We formed an organization called friends of\nGolden Acres for the renovation that was very needed in the home at that time. Ethel Frankfurt\nand I who is now Ethel Zale, she married a Zale. Managed, we built such a successful\norganization, we managed to raise over the years that we were together about a million and a half\nand we renovated several floors really in the home. And I was president, I really loved it at the\ntime. I did that in honor of my mother and father who both were in the home. I also was bas\nmitzvahed in 1992. In honor of my dad cause he had died and I wanted to do that for him. So\nthat even though I didn\u2019t go to college, I managed to have two wonderful careers, one that I\u2019m\nstill enjoying because I love the art in my house. And I have some very good art. And that\u2019s one\nof the reasons I\u2019m not selling my house because I get up every morning and it\u2019s still\nrejuvenating. It really is reyuvenating and my family loves to come over and I\u2019m still very close\nto -- Ihave a wonderful family. Reuben passed away a year and a half ago. And they have just,\neveryone should be as lucky to have the kind of attention that I have had. Really. It, \u2019'm blessed.\nI am truly blessed and as I said starting in the late 70s from the time I went into the art business\nand going on to what we did for Golden Acres has been very rewarding. Very, very rewarding\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand I\u2019m just so happy that P\u2019ve had that time to have to have two wonderful experiences later in\nmy life.",
        "A: Gail, it did not because as I told you when I started, this is truly the first time that I have spent\nany amount of time talking about my growing up. It almost seems as if my life didn\u2019t start for\nme until I got married and moved to Texas.",
        "A: Yes, two parts to my life. And my best memories are from that time on. In fact when I went\nback to Belgium with two of my girls, I wanted to show them the place where I lived. And I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, it was condemned. For what reason I don\u2019t know. So there were no\nmemories there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Only because I was too young really to be able to impart those kind of memories at their age\nto them. And it was a time of my life that obviously I didn\u2019t want to think about. And I didn\u2019t. It\naffected me emotionally very badly, very badly and I think because it affected me emotionally so\nbadly that I just closed it off.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that psychologically people of that time thought about those terms. Because if\nthey did they would have sent me for counseling. That isn\u2019t anything that occurred to them\nreally. Life was simple.",
        "A: Actually it was difficult to keep kosher in Dallas, Texas. Mama didn\u2019t like the kosher\nbutcher. He was very mean. I remember that. The only time that mama kept kosher which really\ntickled me, holidays. Jewish holidays we had to be kosher and Passover we had to change dishes,\nthe whole time that she lived in the United States. It was all right not to the rest of the week. but\nmy sweet memories of Passover was that the day before you were supposed to get not the day,\nbut the day that you were supposed to get rid of the hametz, [ph] mother always had for lunch,\nliver and potatoes, boiled potatoes and we had to come for lunch. And that was the end of the\nhametz [ph]. After that we started Passover. And you know I think it is so wonderful to keep up\nthose traditions because it stays in the mind of children. Those are the things that really remain\nwith them and how important it is. And I do think today that the Jewish institutions are trying to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngo back to that. I know that our temple has changed tremendously in their practices of Judaism.\nThey are catering to the younger people now. Because I think they feel there\u2019s no hope, once we\nare set in our ways.",
        "A: Well that was already when I was grown up. Yeah I got emotionally involved in that. Yes I\ndid get emotionally involved in that and I remember I watched it. In the sense of what happened\nthrough them because of them. I have several friends who were still living, who was survivors.\nThey are the ones who really went through Dachau and the horrors of the concentration camp.\nThe experiments, the nakedness, the shaving of the hair, everything and but I told my children\ntoday at lunch that I really feel, as badly emotionally it affected me, in life it made me strong.\nMy experiences during that period. Giving me a strength that I don\u2019t even see in my children. I\nmean I really feel strong in crises. It\u2019s very interesting. I change completely in a crisis. I don\u2019t\nscream, I don\u2019t cry. I just internalize it and I become strong. And I\u2019m grateful for that. And I\nreally think it\u2019s because of my war experiences. Because I can\u2019t place it anyplace else really,\nthat kind of strength.",
        "A: Yes. Mm hm, yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No because unfortunately there was not a good situation between his wife and my mother\nwho lived around the corner, which affected our relationship. The good old Jewish story. So that\nwe didn\u2019t have much time together to talk and I regret that very much really. And I\u2019m very\nserious that today my friends who still have husbands, who still have a brother, I\u2019m like a\npreacher. I really am, Gail. I tell them I appreciate that what you have the time that you have\ntogether and don\u2019t stop and pick nit, you know the little things that are not important. Discuss\nyour childhood. Discuss things that have happened between the two of you and they do.",
        "A: Very much so. Very much so. But thank God, I had a balance. I had a husband that didn\u2019t\nfeel that way, very over protective.",
        "A: Exactly. I mean don\u2019t do this and don\u2019t do that. You\u2019re going to get hurt. Really, really to the\npoint I think where they resented it. And, I think my youngest child probably didn\u2019t go through\nall that and she\u2019s the one that has the most even temperament. Of the four children. No it\u2019s true.\nTerribly protective. Terribly protective.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t understand it. That was one of the things when I came to the United States that I\nhad never seen before where blacks were not allowed to drink from the same fountain or use the\nsame bathroom. I really was incensed about that. I remember that because I had never seen\nanything like that. I wasn\u2019t there when the Jews were deprived also of doing that because we\nhad left already. So I had never seen that before. And I remember telling Reuben, how can you\naccept anything like that. You know like that. I really remember having some very violent\nreactions to that.",
        "A: Perhaps, perhaps. It was terribly unfair. A mensch is a mensch. It didn\u2019t make sense to me.",
        "A: I felt at one time that I wanted to get out of here and then I \u2014",
        "A: It, I don\u2019t know and then I told myself don\u2019t give in to your weakness. This did not happen\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nto you. And although it happened to several members of my family whom I didn\u2019t know that\nwell. If I had been very close to them it probably would affect me more than it has. It didn\u2019t\nhappen to my mother. It didn\u2019t happen to my father, it didn\u2019t happen to my brother. But it did\nhappen to some very close friends of mine who have not talked about it, but Jesse was gracious\nenough a very close friend to let me listen to her yesterday. Erma Freudenreich.",
        "A: When she gave --",
        "A: Interview, yes. And she never had told me some of the things that she went through. Which\nis very interesting. It, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to explain. You really don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nDo you have a hard time, people talking about it. Gail, when you interview them?",
        "A: No, no. As a matter of fact today I have more, for a long time, more feeling for people, this is\nmy country.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: This is my country. I\u2019m American. I mean I'll always remember a friend of mine who said\nalso a refugee who said when she comes back from a trip, she wants to kiss the ground when she\ngets off the plane. No I am really 100% American.",
        "A: Has the world ever learned a lesson, Gail? As you look back into the centuries. I don\u2019t know.\nI hope so. All we can do is hope but that what you\u2019re doing is marvelous. Recording it. You\nknow I listened to a lecture by the director of the Holocaust museum in Dallas who died recently\nof a heart attack. And he was talking about the fact that even though the war was over in 45, the\nHolocaust didn\u2019t come really to be talked about to the surface until what, 1979.",
        "A: It took a long time.",
        "A: Of what?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: No, no. It never did, never did from the moment I came to the United States. I used to have\nnightmares at night I remember.",
        "A: The Nazis chasing me for months and maybe for leaving, years really. I remember the\nnightmares but I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: No, I kept it to myself yeah. Mama would say it\u2019s nothing. You know I think that there\u2019s\nsuch a difference in parenting today.",
        "A: As I told you when I started this and when Jesse asked me if I would do this, is the time I\nstarted thinking about it. I don\u2019t think about it. My best memories of my life started in, maybe\nnot right away in 1947 but from the time I got married. And I\u2019m not just saying that. That\u2019s\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwhen I really started growing, living, understanding life and learning about life a little bit.\nBecause I didn\u2019t know much about life before.",
        "A: What I was going through.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk about it a lot. But he did know because I remember him repeating several\ntimes when we were out that we were the last boat out of France. Of refugees before the Nazis\ntook over all of France and everybody died. And then that, that was in June. And for some reason\nthat was a paragraph that he kept repeating and repeating and repeating.",
        "A: Yes that we were the last boat out of France the four of us and we were. It was miraculous.",
        "A: He was born in Texas. A real Texan.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Appreciate this country. Appreciate what you are allowed to do in this country. The freedoms\nthat you are allowed, the fact that you don\u2019t have to carry an identity card that says that you\u2019re\nJewish. The fact that you don\u2019t have to be recognized as a Jew or Mormon, any religion that you\ncan practice any religion that you want to, that you are accepted. This is something that you\nshould treasure because as a child growing up I really never knew that. And if you could just\nremember how lucky you are to live in this country. There is no other country in the world, no\nother country in the world where you can live and allowed to live the way you live in this\ncountry. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I\u2019ve always appreciated that from the\nmoment I set foot in this country because I\u2019ve had a wonderful life here. I\u2019ve lived in a part of\nthe country that has been hospitable, that it was just a joy. And when I hear some of the things\nthat are going on now I just can\u2019t understand it. But to my children and to my grandchildren and\nto people in general, cherish it.",
        "A: No [haven\u2019t and you know my husband bought a German car. I never would drive it. I never\nsay this. Actually there\u2019s a whole new generation of Germans now and I don\u2019t think you can\nblame that generation for what happened. But they should be aware that it never happens again.\nBut I don\u2019t blame the new generation that has sprung for what their ancestors have completely\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nignored and they were not the only ones. It was ignored all over the world, what was happening.\nIn the camps and during the war. Or the soldiers wouldn\u2019t have act so amazed when they opened\nthe doors. They didn\u2019t know. And it was interesting yesterday to read Eisenhower\u2019s comment\nreally, this is \u2014 and I was so delighted to see so many children standing in a line and there was\nheartfelt thought to see a couple of young kids crying, actually crying yesterday and this is good,\nthis is good. And I didn\u2019t know that you have such an attendance. I mean it\u2019s constant. And I\nthink that\u2019s great, I really do. In fact I think I\u2019m going to become a member of this one too. You\ncould sell thousands of memberships.",
        "A: No. Never been back.",
        "A: Not really. Not really. It doesn\u2019t bring back good memories. Why go back to a place where\nyou were miserable. Go back to happy place. Yeah.",
        "A: No I think that \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well I thank you for the privilege of being able to remember some of the things of my\nchildhood though I must tell you that right now is a good time in my life also because of my\nfamily, my children, my grandchildren, my art that I still enjoy and it\u2019s wonderful at 84 to be\nable to have the kind of feelings I have. I\u2019m very grateful for that. We all have our moments but\nI think that the good moments overshadow anything else. And I thank you Gail.",
