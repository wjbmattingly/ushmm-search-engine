        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Lena Gitter, conducted by Esther Finder on July 21\",\n1998 in Washington, D.C. This is a follow up interview that will focus on Lena\nGitter\u2019s post-Holocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview, actually I\ninterviewed you for the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation on\nJanuary 29\", 1997. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that interview.\nInstead I will focus \u2014 I will use this interview as a opportunity to follow up on that\ninterview and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one,\nside A. What was your name at birth?",
        "Answer: My name? My married name was Lena Gitter, and middle initial L.\nAnything else?",
        "Q: Your name at birth?",
        "A: Was Lieba Rosenblatt.",
        "Q: And when were you born?",
        "A: July 17\", 1905.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: Vienna, Austria. Vienna, Austria.",
        "Q: When did you come to the United States?",
        "A: We came July, I think it was the last day of July, 1938.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "Q: And where did you settle when you came to the United States?",
        "A: Well, we settled in Washington, D.C.",
        "Q: Before you came to the United States, what were your expectations of\nAmerica?",
        "A: Well, we had a lot of the idea of the \u2014 from the movies, you know, and from the\nnews \u2014 there was a newsreel late in one of the movies, so you got the idea of the big\nbuildings, and the \u2014 and the beautiful New York and all of those skies \u2014 what do\nyou call them? Skyscrapers, and you know, like that.",
        "Q: What surprised you about life in America when you first arrived?",
        "A: Well, one of the things that was very su-surprising when I started to read, that\nyou didn\u2019t judge the people by their profession and by what they did for humanity,\nbut with a price tag. It seemed that at \u2014 the man, 200,000 dollar man. You know,\nthat just was very \u2014 the people who did so much for humanity or for their country,\nhad an un \u2014 a name tag. And I see now, I would have \u2014 where I live in the\nretirement home, many men who are here and they had big positions, but since that\nprice tag is up, they don\u2019t feel very comfortable, you know? They feel very\ndepressed and so on. So, that \u2014 that\u2019s something for your whole life, I think.",
        "Q: When you came to the United States, who did you come with?",
        "A: Icame with my husband and a two year old little girl.",
        "Q: How did you support yourselves when you first came?\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Well, I really couldn\u2019t support myself because I knew very little English, like\nplease and thank you, good morning and some [indecipherable]. My husband, who\nwas a physician and knew English and some other languages, got a job in Casualty\nHospital in Washington, D.C. driving the ambulance, and he got 50 dollars a\nmonth and room and board. So with 50 dollars a month my little girl and I stayed an\napartment house where he paid 12 dollar a week. So that\u2019s \u2014 because we could not \u2014\nthe only thing we could take with us was eight dollars per person. We had 24\ndollars with us. So that th \u2014 took a long time til we were able to \u2014 even to move into\na room and s \u2014 and use kitchen facilities. But you know, we \u2014 it somehow, with this\nHolocaust survivors, I think most of us did not expect that the government or\ndifferent places will take care of us. So it was a very difficult time and my little girl\nand I went to Americanization school to learn English. And we met a lot of other\nrefugees and came through France with some of them. And little by little we got to\nknow some of the physicians and we were 1n-invited a lot, and it was very difficult.\nIf you don\u2019t \u2014 if you don\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t reciprocate, you feel rather badly about. And we\ncame to visit one of the doctors, and the doctor\u2019s wife said, oh, go up the steps, on\nthe bedroom you put your coat on, and the bathroom is there. So I looked at myself,\nI said, what\u2019s wrong with me, you know, is my petticoat hanging out, how do I\nlook? But sh \u2014 sh \u2014I didn't realize that people want to make you comfortable, as\nyou know where the bathroom is, or where you can put your coat. Th-This is some\nJuly 21, 1998\nof the things which are not done in \u2014 in Vienna, or \u2014 or in Austria in a certain\nclass, you know, so \u2014 so there were many, many things. It took a long time to be\ncomfortable, to ask somebody. Now I will ask, oh, you have a lovely bag. If you\u2019re\nfinished with it, you don\u2019t it, give it to me. Or I go \u2014 I dr \u2014I dro \u2014 drove by, and \u2014\nsome friend, three in the afternoon and I was hungry and I would visit a friend and I\ns\u2014 and I-\u2014I said, Jean, I\u2019m so hungry, what do you have in your refrigerator? But I\nhad a Visa, I could si\u2014 and I had some dollar bills, and I could buy something, but\nit \u2014 it \u2014 it was different now, that I could ask people to do or give me something.\nBut when we first came it was very depressing to have to ask. We went in New\nYork to try to get sponsors for some family in France and it was in August, in\nSeptember, it was very, very hot. And when we walked into somebody\u2019s and they\noffered a glass of water, as you did right now, we said no thank you. We didn\u2019t even\nwant to accept a glass of water, we felt so \u2014 s-so bad about ourself that we couldn\u2019t\n[indecipherable]. So it was very wonderful that so many people gave affidavits.\nThey didn't even know the family, or they didn\u2019t \u2014 they had the s-same name or\nsomething, you know, and \u2014 and it was really wonderful the way, particularly the\nvery poor Jews in \u2014 the poorer class, you know. Of course, they had to have a\ncertain income, or a t-tax return to show that they would be able to \u2014 to support or \u2014\nor help \u2014 help the people. So it was a very di-difficult time.",
        "Q: Did somebody help you and your husband and child come to this country?\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Not really, because my husband was registered at the \u2014 at \u2014 at the embassy as a\nstudent to come to the United States with his professor. So he was on the \u2014 well,\nwe had, or my husband had family here in \u2014 in United States. But we \u2014 we had a\ncertain pride, you know, and just to take or ask me for something, it\u2019s very difficult.",
        "Q: When you came to this country, did people ask you about what was happening in\nAustria?",
        "A: No. The pi \u2014 the peop \u2014 some knew Vienna or Austria from \u2014 from visiting\nthere or from movies and so on. People were not so \u2014 so interested in \u2014 in what had\nhappened, and a \u2014 it was very little known, you know. Even we didn\u2019t know too\nmuch about. We were very fortunate to leave \u2014 Hitler marched in on the 13\" of\nMarch, and we were very fortunate to leave the beginning of July, you know. So \u2014\nbut my husband had, as a physician, really terrible experiences. He could not treat\nJewish people at all, or \u2014 or in \u2014 not \u2014 he couldn\u2019t, not Jewish, Gentile people, but\nJewish people he could treat. And he would get phone calls from the family that the\nhusband was taken to concentration camp, Dachau, Buchenwald. On \u2014 on the\nfollowing week she received a \u2014 at \u2014 not a fa \u2014 didn\u2019t have faxes that time, a\ntelegram that her husband had died on pneumonia and they have \u2014 she would get\nthe ashes back. So he knew all these and he was very, very depressed, but it was\nvery difficult for him to get ready to leave, much more somehow than it was for me.\nYou know, and I felt for a longest, longest time until we had the first interview that\nJuly 21, 1998\nyou did, I felt very guilty that I, my family, we were able to escape and \u2014 here, and I\nwas able, you know, the education that I \u2014 that I have to make a success, and so did\nmy husband here, and here my family and \u2014 and friends lost their \u2014 their life, and \u2014\nand so I \u2014I felt very, very guilty. But now, since that \u2014 it has changed my attitude\nsince that interview and also I did not realize that I \u2014 that I am considered a\nHolocaust survivor. I didn\u2019t \u2014 never, never occurred to me to be in the same\ncategory. But now I feel that I have a voice, I can do something and I\u2019m very\nfortunate that I have that Montessori education, or early childhood education that I\nwas doing so much in the United States, was very successful. I got the gold medal\nfor my work in America for the \u2014 in Montessori. I got [indecipherable] what do\nyou call it, gold medal from the \u2014 from the embas \u2014 from Austria. I got my\ncitizenship back, and I have a voice. Being angry, it \u2014 1t does not help. So I feel now\nthat since the \u2014 all my writing, I have written about 18 \u2014 not \u2014 not high class and not\npeople who made the best seller list, but they helped the people, the poor people\nthat I worked in Mississippi to write and be able to vo \u2014 to vote.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you to pause because you\u2019re running a little bit ahead of me. I \u2014\nI would like you to tell me how you began your professional career, and I\u2019d like you\nto explain about your background with Montessori. I-I would like you to take your\ntime and do that very slowly, from the beginning, please.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Well, w-w \u2014 in Vienna, you know, after the first World War, we began to ask\nourselves, what is wrong with education, what has to be done? And we were young\npeople and so we wanted to change the world. So Montessori was brought, she was\na physician from Italy and she brought the Montessori method to Vienna. So we\nall ran to these lectures and got a \u2014 a book that sh \u2014 the first book she wrote and so\non. And you had, in Vienna you had to do first your exam as a kindergarten\nteacher, you know, and then you could specialize in [indecipherable] in\nMontessori. So I took the \u2014 the training, then when I got married, I opened up a\nkindergarten, and I \u2014 cause I had the middle or the upper middle class children. I did\nnot have the poor \u2014 the poor ones as I really had here in America. So na \u2014 when I\nfirst came, it took a long time til I learned enough English to take some of the tests\nthat were necessary to establish myself. And at that time was the English word\nagainst the English [indecipherable] that\u2019s what the \u2014 some of \u2014 of the newcomers\nhave to learn, you know, that you have to know the language in order to be political\nactive or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or have a job and [indecipherable] thing. So first I got\ndifferent jobs in special education, because at that time in the early sh \u2014 the special\neducation was on the lower bottom of the education. So \u2014 so when I applied they\nwere happy to \u2014 to get me to take care of the special class children. And then they\nwere very surprised the big success, because I was bootlegging Montessori. I made\na lot of material, I use that method of Montessori, and so the supervisor, she used\nJuly 21, 1998\nto bring teachers or students to observe in my \u2014 in my classes and so on, to see what\nI\u2019m doing.",
        "Q: Can you explain what 1s different about the Montessori program that you were\ninitiating, as opposed to what was going on in this country at that time?",
        "A: For one thing, I did not initiate. Montessori was here in the early \u2014 1913 she wa\n\u2014 she was here, and there were schools and by 1918 when the war \u2014 when the first\nWorld War start, these schools were all closed. Montessori approach 1s entirely\ndifferent, it\u2019s very difficult to explain on \u2014 on a few minutes.",
        "Q: If you could just give a little bit of an idea for someone who does not know\nabout Montessori.",
        "A: Okay. For one thing, it\u2019s a different layout of a classroom. Children are \u2014 are not\nexpected because they\u2019re six years old that they be reading, or three years old. We\ndon\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 in aclassroom we have children from three to six, for instance,\nbecause a three year old one might be able to read, or a four year old one, but\nunable to kick a ball or something than a six year one. So they\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s a such \u2014 like\nin a family. We do a different classroom arrangement. So we don\u2019t have this is the\nclass two years old, or four year one, we have them \u2014 we have now infants\u2019 classes\ntoo, you know. So this is one of the things. And also that th-there are certain rules\nand \u2014 and regulations in a Montessori classroom and people in th \u2014 it has to work\nlike a \u2014 like a society. You can \u2014 I mean, you have to show them, for instance, how\nJuly 21, 1998\nto open a door and close a door. How to lift a chair and put it down. And how \u2014 and\nif you play with something, that y \u2014 I cannot come and say, this I want to play now\nwith it. So, he learns that he has to ask. We have little rugs for the children, and they\nput their toys on that rug, and this is his territory. So they have to learn territorial\nrights. It\u2019s laid out the way, like a library with the books and stuff. You just can\u2019t\ntake out a book and then, oh, I want to read the book. We have to return it to there,\nand th-th-then next child can. So that the \u2014 he learns in \u2014 the way a classroom and\nthe way the whole thing is handled, he learns the rules for society. So, th-this is a\nvery im \u2014 important, and the different expectations for the parents too, to \u2014 to\nunderstand that, you know\u201d? And the teacher is not called a teacher, she is a\ndirectress, she directs activities. She doesn\u2019t sit at her desk and the children come\nin, she has to be like a hostess, stand at the door, greet the children. And as she\ngreets them, says Esther, you have a lovely dress and your hair is done so nice. Oh,\nand you have such a doll. And Esther says, oh my grandma came and she brought\nme that doll. So you know from that, that the child will want to walk around the\nclassroom, show the doll to her. She doesn\u2019t want to disturb. And then there comes\nJim, and Jim is so sad. So he said, you know, teach \u2014 some didn\u2019t know, you know,\nvery much. He said, you know, the police came and \u2014 and took my ha \u2014 my father\nto jail. Then you know that this child needs help, somebody to help him to deal with\nit. And so that your aid spends a lot of time because otherwise he\u2019s gonna run\nJuly 21, 1998\naround, disturbing and knocking things over [indecipherable] knocking things\nover. He \u2014 somehow he has to deal with it, but then you assign somebody to help\nhim, hold his hand, take him around and so on. So that Montessori said like a\nhostess. If she greets the people at the door and says, oh, Mrs. Finder, you have a\nlovely dress today, and \u2014 and then you tell [indecipherable] or your husband to go\nand get yourself a drink. You don\u2019t talk to her the rest of your party, but she will\ncome home and she says, you know, Mrs. Finder saw what a beautiful dress I had,\nyou know. So the same way children know they \u2014 they were recognized, and that\nyou knew dealing with their problems or \u2014 and also, this teaches sort of manners to\nthe children, to greet people in the morning. Some people talking \u2014 were critical\nwhen I talked at one of the university, I had some black students, teachers. And he\nsaid, oh yes, you come from a country, ki-kings and queens and you shake hands\nand you do all these nice things. But it\u2019s a\u2014 a very important thing to be nice, and\nso on. And so we do a lot training and what you call practical life. And under that\ncomes also the manners and behavior. And what is father of the cons \u2014 of the \u2014 the\npresident, the first president, we had? George Washington. When he was 15 years\nold, he wrote a book on manners that is \u2014 can be had. Now, we have \u2014 \u201cThe\nWashington Post\u201d has a columnist and she wrote just recently a very great book on\nmanners, the ya \u2014 and once I said, like lubrication of your wheels. At that time very\nJuly 21, 1998\nfew people have cars, you know. But so she had a different \u2014 so these are some of\nthe things that were \u2014 we were teaching. It\u2019s very difficult to do it, and you know.",
        "Q: Thank you for \u2014 for sharing that. When you first were working and \u2014 and\nshowing people the Montessori method, what difficulties did you have explaining\nor trying to initiate or introduce the Americans that you were meeting to this new\nway?",
        "A: The first time when I was called to Mississippi.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: That was in the, I think, early 60s or something. And it was the War on Poverty,\nwhich [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, so we can \u2014 politically th-the time ca\n[indecipherable] exception. So I went to Mississippi to work with poor mothers\nand \u2014 and poor children. The \u2014 most of the southerners are Baptists, so \u2014 and so we\nhad \u2014 the daycare centers that we opened for the War on Poverty was in Baptist\nchurches. We could not bring kindergarten teachers in, or \u2014 because they don\u2019t want\nto have jobs and such. So we t-tried to train the people who lived there. I worked in\nNaches, Mississippi, was my first assignment, and at that time, Governor Bell did\nnot \u2014 he was the governor of Mississippi and he did not want the \u2014 the money\nassigned for the president to use it. We came under a different, other th-thing. And\nit was very, very difficult to \u2014 to teach these mothers how they could read\nthemselves. I had to teach the mothers reading and writing and show them on a\nJuly 21, 1998\nsomewhat basically they could \u2014 I did not know that I\u2019m all of a sudden a political\nworker because I helped these mothers, and some of their husbands would come in\ntoo, to learn to read and write so they could do the \u2014 an-and johns \u2014 not Johnson,\nthe Kennedys used to come on weekends and help. So these people were able to go\nto the polls. And I worked with Charles Evers, who was the first black mayor to be\nelected in Mississippi. And was \u2014 so I became a political worker without realizing\nwhat just \u2014 I didn\u2019t know that teaching somebody to read and write is \u2014 is a very big\nthing that you\u2019re giving. And ma \u2014 my motto 1s the word against the weapon. If we\nwill teach people to read and write, then \u2014 then they don\u2019t need a weapon to \u2014 to get\nsome of the things.",
        "Q: I wanted to know how you got involved with what became what you just said, a\npolitical issue, but I \u2014 I would like you back up just a little bit and \u2014 and go back to\nthe late 40s, and the 50s, when \u2014 when there are a lot of things happening, not just\nin your life, but in \u2014 in this society here, and news was coming out in Europe about\nwhat had happened during the war. Can we go back for a little while and then come\n\u2014 we'll return to the 60s in \u2014 in a few minutes, but can we go back to the postwar\nperiod, the immediate postwar period, 1945, and can you tell me what was going on\nin your life in this country as news of what happened to the Jews in Europe became\npublic here?\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Well, 1d\u2014Id\u2014I can\u2019t put it on dates. I\u2019m \u2014 I was \u2014 on the 17\" this month, I was\n93 years old. So you don\u2019t \u2014 your memory is not so, on dates and so on, I\u2019m not so\n\u2014 I really \u2014 well, we opened up the first mo \u2014 Montessori training center in \u2014 in \u2014 1n\nNew Jersey, at one of the universities, they opened up to try to train people in\nMontessori. And there was Nancy Rambush(ph) arrived, an American who had\nstudied the method in \u2014 in \u2014 1n Paris and so on. So little by little we started training\ncenters, but that was all middle class, for middle class because it was quite\nexpensive and \u2014 and mothers began to go to work, or they are forced, they didn\u2019t\nhave husbands, they had died in the war, whatever. And so most of the \u2014 some\npeople [indecipherable] started the, you know.",
        "Q: Approximately when was that? You said some of the women had their \u2014 their\nhusbands had been killed in the war. When did you start some of these training\nprograms?",
        "A: With what program?",
        "Q: The \u2014 the Montessori training.",
        "A: Well, I really couldn\u2019t tell you exactly the \u2014 the years, but anyway it \u2014 it \u2014 really,\nwhen the Sputnik came out in space, America began to ask themselves, what is\nwrong with our education, that the Soviet take us over? So, they looked and they | \u2014\nand since Montessori was the first woman who was asked to come to the \u2014 when\nthe war was over in 1918, to the first conference in peace, and she wrote a little\nJuly 21, 1998\nbooklet, Peace and Education, and she was very concerned about the peace, you\nknow. So we looked \u2014 and then I went to England for awhile to take a \u2014 a training\ncourse, and I went to different places in \u2014 in \u2014 in Europe, you know, for retraining.\nIn the beginning we got a lot of teachers from India, because Montessori was, for\n10 years she was in India, because she was Italian citizen and she would not follow\n\u2014 what was the name in \u2014 I forgot his name. What? Yeah, mo \u2014 and then she went to\n\u2014 to Spain, and then she had \u2014 she would not follow [indecipherable] the\ndirections of, what was his name [indecipherable]. So \u2014 so we \u2014 so finally she went\nto India, because when the war broke out the \u2014 as an Italian citizen she had \u2014 she\nwas for 10 years in India, and she became a f-friend with Rabindra Tagore, the\nfirst who got the N-Nobel prize [indecipherable] Indian, he wrote books and poetry\nand he was very much involved in peace. And also the Indira Gandhi, with\nGandhi. He didn't \u2014 the two of them were not \u2014 Gandhi and Montessori were\nhistorically living the same time, but also they shared the whole idea. He was for\nnon-violence for adults and she non-violence for children. At that time, as we see\nand hear it now in the newspapers and radio, the children were just suffering.\nPerhaps not as much, but they were \u2014 they \u2014 and when they were eight years old\nthey went to mines to work and so on. So, you see, she was very, very involved in \u2014\nin \u2014 in peace movement. And so, this is very important for us in \u2014 and to do this,\nand that\u2019s why I am so happy that my materials and all that is going to Vienna, yet,\nJuly 21, 1998\nw-we \u2014 we paid a [indecipherable] we\u2019ll be able to do something towards peace,\nand also that the university, they realize here is a Holocaust survivor and what he\ndid with that method, you know, they will know something, cause a lot of materials\nand stuff, I\u2019m working with these Holocaust interns at the museum, they\u2019re from\nAustria. It\u2019s the fourth one or fifth one that I am working, we worked on different\nthings, with the Montessori method and others, how it can be. So that I feel now\nthat, of the end of my life, I feel, as Montessori said, in the service of the child, that\nthat will go on. And, but it also \u2014 it will be a separate room where all the materials\nand books are being \u2014 and films and [indecipherable] si \u2014 si \u2014 many books,\nbecause textbooks are so much written for the upper middle class. Or they are tested\non the university, on the professor\u2019s children. But there aren\u2019t books and materials\nfor the children who don\u2019t have that background and don\u2019t go to the museums and\nall that business.",
        "Q: You just gave me a lot of information, let me just clarify a few points. You made\nreference to your \u2014 your books being collected in a university setting. Can you\nplease clarify what that is all about?",
        "A: Well, I talked all the time with the embassy and with the people from \u2014 these\ninterns, the importance of \u2014 of education and so on. So, I don\u2019t know how it came\nabout, but I \u2014 not only that I have my books, but I have 200 books, thi \u2014 this \u2014 that\u2019s\nwritten by other writers and also Montessori was not the discoverer of her method,\nJuly 21, 1998\nthere were two French doctors before her. And I went \u2014 and she went to Paris, it\u2019s\nfunny, I went to Paris, too, to \u2014 at the same \u2014 later on. And \u2014 and I got th-the\nmaterials on th-these doctors wrote. I have Montessori books \u2019m \u2014?\u2019m-\u2014I\u2019m\u2014I\ntaught a class in \u2014 1n Japan, so I have a book on \u2014 Montessori book in Japanese. I\nhave the Madonna painted on a silk. The Madonna 1s a Japanese, and the holy child\nshe\u2019s holding looks like a Japanese too, and so 1t shows you how universal that\nmethod. We \u2014 I lectured in \u2014 in Israel a few times. So you see, this is a method that\nhas some technical ways to teach peace, you know.",
        "Q: And where are your books being collected for public access?",
        "A: The books \u2014 the books are here, and I got \u2014 for instance I got an \u2014 this is\nElisabeth who you read about, Gehrer. She is the mi \u2014 Minister of Education in \u2014\nin Vienna. We [indecipherable] have a librarian, a young librarian from Catholic\nUniversity and he comes and he has registered \u2014 we sent already 14 cartons of\nbooks to Vienna, films and different materials. And the embassy ships this stuff,\nbut it\u2019s packed in my apartment and the different \u2014 I hope to get some volunteers to\nhelp, because I have videos and I have a lot of material. It\u2019s not only my books, but\n\u2014and also, there are other books that teachers need to read. Now this room that\nthey\u2019re opening in Vienna, it\u2019s not gonna be \u2014 people cannot borrow these books,\nit\u2019s they can go and read it there, you see? And so I hope, you know, that this \u2014 this\nHolocaust \u2014 and I\u2019m so happy that, because there\u2019s a \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the plans was\nJuly 21, 1998\ngoing through to have a \u2014 stones with the names on of the survi \u2014 of the Holocaust\nvictims.",
        "Q: We have to pause so I can flip the tape. Just one moment. [break] This is a\ncontinuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Lena Gitter. This is tape one, side B. Now, you were\ngiving me a lot of information about your Montessori work over the years, and you\nhad been telling me about this collection of books and films and \u2014 and other things.\nAnd Id like you to \u2014 to finish telling me about that before we go on to the next\ntopic. If you could tell me a little bit more specifically, where this room, where your\ncollection will be housed, where exactly is it? Is it part of a university?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s gonna be in th \u2014 Vienna \u2014 | don\u2019t think we have any private universities\nin Vienna. This is [indecipherable] which is part of the university, people in early\nchildhood education. And they have different libraries, but mine is gonna be a\nspecial room, and it will have my collection in there, but it\u2019s only people can do\nresearch there, but they cannot borrow any of the books and so on.",
        "Q: When do you think that this collection will be assembled and open to the public?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that, and they would like to, in Vienna the Dr.\n[indecipherable] is in charge of this particular program, the director. He would like\nmaybe by September to \u2014 but it\u2019s very difficult to get it all shipped and packed and\n\u2014 and also that you have to have lists, and you can\u2019t just go on, and \u2014 so I have\nJuly 21, 1998\nlibrarian and they sorting, you know, the unpublished papers and books and \u2014 and\nmagazines and th-the different speeches that I have given, or other people, you\nknow, that deal with Montessori. So, it\u2019s ga \u2014 quite a lot of work. I don\u2019t ever have\nany room now to live in my apartment, that\u2019s [indecipherable] I\u2019m really working\non the \u2014",
        "Q: How did this project of, you know, with your collection being sent to Austria,\nhow did this develop? Where did it begin?",
        "A: Two year ago, a\u2014a professor and \u2014 and journalist and so on from Graz, you\nknow, in Austria, came, she \u2014 to the United States at the Library of Congress. And\nshe had heard me speak, and when \u2014 when the biography was published and I was\nthere to promote it. She heard me speak, but she could not come up to \u2014 there were\nso many people in line, she had to leave. So when she came for research she called\nme, and she would like to see me. So I invited her for lunch, and we became friend,\nand she was the one who sort of said, lis \u2014 it would be a good idea 1f you would get\nto know a-and get your material to know in v \u2014 in Vienna. So she sort of started,\nand I was thinking about it, but I really did not realize it\u2019s gonna be such a big\nproject. So, let\u2019s see. Last year, the \u2014 the Austrian embassy gave me the \u2014 the gold\nmedal for the work that I did because I worked a lot with these Holocaust interns,\ntook them to some of the Jewish places, I had them for Jewish holidays because\nthey have to learn to know how we\u2019re celebrating them. And also, I \u2014 on all \u2014 on all\nJuly 21, 1998\nthe holidays, I \u2014 I invite them here to a little meal, my family and friends, and then I\ninvite one or two with \u2014 of the Holocaust, or non-Jewish people to come. And I\ndon\u2019t want the people to bring me flowers or candy. Everybody has to write\nsomething about that holiday. So, even these Holocaust survivors have written very\ninteresting things, and I\u2019ve taken them to the Temple Sinai to some \u2014 so the-they\nlearning a lot of \u2014 of Jewish life, to \u2014 and to understand. And [indecipherable] in\nmy family I have a lot, and two of my granddaughters are married to non-Jews too,\nyou know. So I\u2019m very interested of this understanding, you know. So, I don\u2019t\nknow, cause a lot of people come, when they come to the Holocaust Museum, they\ncome to visit me too, and I \u2014 I lived in different things [indecipherable]. But\nanyway, I don\u2019t know exactly, but all of a sudden th \u2014 told the \u2014 one of the attaches\nthat I think maybe I have so many books, perhaps they would be interested in\nVienna to get it. So he asked me, and he made sort of a temporary list and send it to\nVienna. And they were very happy, and so they have already 14 boxes, and that\u2019s\njust with books and then films, and videos and I have hundreds of beautiful\nphotography of the poor people in Mississippi and in New England, and different\nplaces, and it \u2014 it opens the world to the people here and in Vienna too, because\nthey \u2014 they only think America is you know, the \u2014 the rich country, you know, it \u2014\non the Fifth Avenue, or Madison Avenue, whatever they see. So that \u2014 I\u2019m taking\nthat movie attitude away from other people. So we started, and I looked for\nJuly 21, 1998\nsomebody to help with the packing, and I got this young librarian at Catholic\nUniversity who is very interested, and when he\u2019s off he comes and works a few\nhours and packs a thing. And then the embassy ships it.",
        "Q: I'd like to go back to your work in the War on Poverty, when you went in the\n1960s to Mississippi. How did it happen that you got involved with this particular\nprogram, and left your home and did this?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 a lot of people in Montessori knew me and some people got involved\nin \u2014 in these different issues and \u2014 in America. And I got a phone call one day,\nwould I come to Mississippi and introduce a little bit of Montessori? So I went\ndown, and at that time in Mississippi there were different [indecipherable]\nMontessori, some people were from other universities with specialties in \u2014 in \u2014 in\ntheir field. So, what \u2014 we were hired by the, I th-think one of the Kennedy\u2019s\nbrother-in-law, I don\u2019t know, he was in charge. Anyway, we were paid. So we got\nto Mississippi, and my husband, and we felt this is an opportunity to repay\nsomething to America. And when I got to Naches, Mississippi, I \u2014 I \u2014 one of the in\n\u2014 newspapers came down for an interview, one of the Catholic paper. And \u2014 a-and\nin there I didn't even remember, but in there I had said I felt when in Mississippi\nthat I\u2019m back in \u2014 under Hitler, you know, the way things were going. And then to\ncome to my hats. I wore hats because I can\u2019t always comb my hair so well. So I\nwore hats, and I have different hats. And the Ku Klux Klan was very much behind\nJuly 21, 1998\nme, they didn't want us to come in to teach the blacks. But I heard from somebody\nwho was friends with the Ku Klux Klan too, said we can\u2019t take \u2014 we don\u2019t \u2014 Hitler\ndidn\u2019t want that little Jewish woman, we can\u2019t do it either, because everybody\nknows her by her hats. So that was a \u2014 that sort of saved me from being killed by\nthe klan.",
        "Q: And every time I\u2019ve seen you, you\u2019ve had a different hat.",
        "A: Right. So people, some people when they go on a trip, my grandchildren or\nsomething, they bring me \u2014 I have chapeaux from all over the world. And there is a\n\u2014a place here in the United States, they have only \u2014 a\u2014 a woman has a shop only\nwith hats. I shouldn\u2019t nor \u2014 need to go there, and see what I don\u2019t have. S-So \u2014 but I\ndidn\u2019t stay the whole time, you see, in Mississippi, I did work and to train them,\nand I would fly back to Washington, then go down again for a week. And so it\nwasn\u2019t that I continuously stayed there. But you see, my teaching and \u2014 and the\npolitic was \u2014 was one thing. Because like I worked in Naches with the poor people\nwho didn't know how to read, an-and \u2014 and Charles Evers, he was \u2014 he was from\nNaches too, and he was running for an office. So he \u2014 sometimes I was up here with\nhim, you know, on \u2014 when he \u2014 when he was \u2014 spoke somewhere, or we have\ncatfish, or [indecipherable] and stuff. So that \u2014 you know, so I \u2014 I appeared and I\nwas some help, you know, the [indecipherable] thing, and he was elected not\nbecause just of me [indecipherable]. But I was then at the \u2014 what\u2019s the city, the\nJuly 21, 1998\ncapital city, when he was elected. But we did not \u2014 our checks came from a\ndifferent group, not from \u2014 from the state of Mississippi, you know. So many, many\nthings I somehow adopted that Montessori method and I have to rewrite a lot to\nunderstand their backgrounds and their needs and so on. And it was very difficult in\nthe beginning because these mothers wouldn't sleep or clean up. They said, oh don\u2019t\nI know that they don\u2019t have to do these slave type work? And I said, you know, but\nstill, you know, we have to clean up. And then I called the \u2014 here the national\ngallery of art and ask the cur \u2014 one of the curators in education, could he send me\nsome paintings that glorify work? And he did. And so we hung it in the different\nclassrooms, and so they \u2014 the \u201cGirl with a Broom\u201d by Rembrandt, they realized\nnow the \u2014 somehow, without having ever been to a museum, they knew that\npaintings are something very precious. And \u2014 and [indecipherable] and different\npaintings and we had it in the classrooms. And 1-it \u2014 during that time, War on\nPoverty, they were, you know, the se-senators and congressmen and people would\ncome to Mississippi and they would come to visit these centers. And \u2014 and we \u2014 I\ntaught them the names of these paintings and \u2014 on the \u2014 and so when these pa \u2014\npeople came, and these pro-professors and so, and painting, and \u2014 and she could\nsay, oh this is, the name of the painting, say something. All of a sudden that little\nblack woman without any art education was at the same level as the senator or the\nJuly 21, 1998\n[indecipherable] and she knew. So the arts plays a stellar role too, in the many\nthings that I have done in the art.",
        "Q: When you said they sent you paintings, they sent you what, copies? What \u2014 did\nthey send you posters? What did they send you actually, when you requested this\nfor this \u2014 for the classroom?",
        "A: They sent in \u2014 the educational division at the national gallery, or most of them\nhave an education department. They send me slides and they send me, not too large,\nbut anyway, reproductions, you know.",
        "Q: I also want you to clarify something you said a few moments ago. You said that\nbeing in Mississippi was like being back under Hitler. Could you please clarify\nwhat you meant by that?",
        "A: Well, the fear that \u2014 that people had, to \u2014 to go to a certain store. For instance, in\nVienna when I was going in stores that belonged to some of Jewish people, I didn't\nhave look. I had braids, and \u2014 and a \u2014 they would say, fraulein, you can\u2019t go into\nthat, the Nazis would tell me you can\u2019t go into the store, because they thought I \u2014 y-\nyou know, that\u2019s only for Jewish people, you know. And we could not be out at \u2014\nvery late in the evening, and you couldn\u2019t go into \u2014 to a movie, or you couldn\u2019t \u2014\nand it was the same thing, because the blacks, you could go only on the \u2014 some of\nthe gallery [indecipherable]. And they couldn\u2019t sit in a \u2014 a restaurant. I mean, the\nthings that were done to us in \u2014 in \u2014 under Hitler, these conditions existed there. So\nJuly 21, 1998\nI was able, you know, and then I worked with \u2014 with others, not only Mississippi,\nwith other states, flying in, and I wrote papers and I wrote little pamphlets and\ndifferent things to help the people to \u2014 to learn. And I was so happy to see that \u2014\nwhat\u2019s that comedian, that black one? He lost his \u2014 his son was killed?",
        "Q: Bill Cosby\u201d",
        "A: Yeah. I \u2014 I was on a program years ago with him at \u2014 on special education for\nblack chil \u2014 what he has written now, books for children to read, and \u2014 and they\nhave \u2014 they have [indecipherable] they have blacks and \u2014 and it\u2019s so important that\nchildren find something where they can relate to, what not \u2014 you know, the father\ncoming home with the attach\u00e9, you know. And when the children are asked they say\nthey don\u2019t \u2014 no, my father doesn\u2019t do anything, he goes with the \u2014 with that attach\u00e9\ncase, you know. So \u2014 so from what I have done over the years was an example for\nsome other daycare centers and places to \u2014 to use and how to teach adults, you\nknow, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: When you were working in Mississippi, and \u2014 and starting to speak to people,\ndid you ever tell them about your experiences in Europe?",
        "A: Very little, there either. They were so, when e \u2014 so poor enough, and to \u2014 and the\nthings they had to do, they really did not have time. Just \u2014 just to be eight hours in\nthat day care center, and then I had them paint and clean up, because they were an\nawfully messy and \u2014 and dirty, these places. And so we didn't have any money for\nJuly 21, 1998\npainting, but the people came early in the morning. They had to open at eight, or\nthey would come at six and paint these day care centers and scrub floors and \u2014 and\nwe made waste baskets and \u2014 and we made bookshelves, getting \u2014 at that time you\nstill could get boxes, you know, crates where apples came, they were very well\ndone, I \u2014 as a matter of fact I had them for years as bookcases in my first apartment\nin United States. So, we were so involved with their own life that they did not have\ntime to \u2014",
        "Q: You said that you noticed a parallel between your experience and what they were\ngoing through. Did anybody ever ask you why are you doing this kind of work?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You were going from Mississippi back to Washington?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And back and forth. What were your thoughts at the time about the American\nsocial order, based on your perspective as a refugee?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 it \u2014 I traveled mostly with \u2014 with educators and so on, along with\nphysicians, so I don\u2019t know really, I\u2019m \u2014 one is so involved in what else was going\non and we didn\u2019t talk too much about our past either, you know.",
        "Q: Who else was working with you? You said you were working with other\neducators, but were there other people who were coming from Washington or from\nthe big cities to work with you, or were you going on your own?\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Most of the time I went on my own, and met some people from \u2014 from other\nstates or from other universities or colleges and so on.",
        "Q: You mentioned Kennedy. Did you have any contact with Kennedy?",
        "A: Yeah, because they used to come to Naches on weekends with their airplane and\nthey would help the people, you know, prepare them too for \u2014 for their rights. I\nwasn\u2019t so invol \u2014 you know, I wasn\u2019t politishin(ph) involved or no, you know, with\nthe rights, or what in \u2014 people need to know, or you know, to get to the polls, and\npeople are very much afraid, you know, too. So the Kennedys would bring a lot of\nstudents down, too. And you know, the people that sent it, the students who were\nnot dressed well on the campground, they said, look, we are dirty, we want models\nof people who are dressed properly and combed and so on.",
        "Q: Which Kennedys?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t remember their names now. You\u2019re asking me t \u2014 hundreds and\nthousands of names it seems.",
        "Q: You worked also with Jimmy Carter. Can you tell me how you met and started\nworking with President Carter?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I\u2019m a member of the Women\u2019s National Democratic club, and when\nCarter was running for office 1-in \u2014 where was it, in Pennsylvania and a couple of\nother states, the Republicans had the majority [indecipherable]. So the \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow how the club arranged what they called the Peanut Brigade. They had I think\nJuly 21, 1998\nabout four or five very huge buses, and they had banners, they were called the uni \u2014\nand [indecipherable] you know, that you could t-talk, you know, on the different,\nand they were asking some \u2014 they \u2014 we had a lot of young students, political science\nfrom the different universities, but they also ask for some volunteers, you know,\nteachers and so on. So I didn\u2019t know exactly what I could do, but I thought I\u2019 Il go.\nAnd that was a very wonderful experience, to go to the different places and talk to\nthe teachers of their importance in educating the children that they will be able to \u2014\nto go to [indecipherable] and so on. So, we stopped at different, you know,\nwherever there was some \u2014 some monument, we si \u2014 had to stop there, the\nnewspaper come, and we had \u2014 I still have that shirts with their whole \u2014 with\nCarter and so on. So, when he \u2014 when he was elected we were invited specially to\nthe White House and stuff. And then he was the first one who got \u2014 when my bi \u2014\nbiography came out and he was in Vienna, so the president gave him a book of the\n\u2014a-\u2014the \u2014 we worked with \u2014 with Mrs. Carter a lot, but n-not her \u2014 really so much\nwith him, I mean, I was there and so, but \u2014",
        "Q: You mentioned your biography. Why don\u2019t you take a moment now and tell me\nabout your biography.",
        "A: A f\u2014a few friends and I have organized a little German club, and so we meeting\nonce \u2014 once a month. And one day a Mrs. Schroeder came, and she is a journalist\nand so is her husband. And she came to the German club and said, I know I don\u2019t\nJuly 21, 1998\nneed to learn German, however I want to know what makes you guys get together\nand speak German, you know. And somehow, after a year or so she was there \u2014 she\nasks her husband, and she asked me did I want to do a book, because from what I\nwas saying at the club, or somehow she thought that I have \u2014 we \u2014 I had a story to\ntell. So we did. So it was a \u2014 quite a decision, and also you know, I did not \u2014 I\nhadn\u2019t planned, you know, and \u2014 and a lot of dates and stuff like you are asking me.\nI\u2019m a\u2014 mathematics wasn\u2019t my strong forte. So, 1t was v-very difficult, but as a\njournalist, I mean like he went to \u2014 they went to Vienna when they were doing the \u2014\nand they found the coffee shop where I went to, and they found the schools I went\nto, and they brought photographs and \u2014 and they got 1-1in \u2014 Austria pu-published\nevery year, every month what\u2019s happening and every day. So he found the 1905,\nwhat in July, had happened, you know. And there were similar things being \u2014 we\nwill want now [indecipherable] that. And some from newspaper they were \u2014 I have\nan awful lot of newspaper clippings, cause wherever I was, somehow there was an\ninterview on \u2014 in some newspapers, so \u2014 we could establish some days where I went\nor what I did, you know, from the newspaper clippings. But this \u2014 my memory 1s\nnot so \u2014 so good any more. In particular for dates. But, as I say, what \u2014 they were\nable, you know, to search through newspapers, and si \u2014 and there are some books\nand there\u2019s a chapter or something about me said in \u2014 in there, on the War on\nPoverty people who wrote books, so in several books was something about me or\nJuly 21, 1998\nmy work, you know, so \u2014 so that\u2019s how it came. It took a long time, and \u2014 but\nunfortunately it isn\u2019t translated into English yet. That bothers my grandchildren\nbecause they never learned any German because my daughter was so \u2014 she would\nnot want to have her children on Hitler\u2019s language. So \u2014 so the \u2014 course there\u2019s not\nenough on Montessori in there, and \u2014 well, you can\u2019t di \u2014 you know, write so much\nwhen you live a long life as I did, and \u2014 but I was so fortunate as a title, it \u2014 the\nbook, I was very lucky that what I did, 1t was a success, you know. And had some \u2014\neverybody lives a life and has some sad things, but c\u2019est la vie, and it doesn\u2019t have\nto \u2014 just to sit and \u2014 and feel sorry for oneself, that I lost my daughter and I had to\ntake care of my grandchildren. But I\u2019m very lucky, they all did not go on drugs,\nthey finished their education, they are married, they have children and they are\nworking and I can be very happy with that. And that my work that I did is\nsuccessful \u2014 was very successful in that it\u2019s a \u2014 a [indecipherable] and we\u2019ll find a\nplace and I feel in a way it will constantly remind people when they go there to\nvisit, that this Jewish woman was a Holocaust \u2014 what the Holocaust room, even if\nthey will not have everybody\u2019s name, but somehow I feel with the videos and with\nth-the \u2014 everything is going to be there, that it will be some \u2014 1n paying something\nback that I did not suffer. But I feel it \u2014 that the work that I have done that is being \u2014\nbeing used, it will tell the story of these people that I did not know and that had to\nsuffer and \u2014 and die such a terrible death. So I feel that really I have to be grateful\nJuly 21, 1998\nparticular to Spielberg that his first video that made me feel I have some spot in\nthat history and I have done something with my life, and that I have in some way, is\n\u2014 1s \u2014 I wanted to dedicate this memorial to these people that \u2014 that I don\u2019t know,\nand some names I know. But I always wanted when they were talking about a stone\nwall with the names, the people in Vienna have such magnificent buildings and\nmuseums. People on \u2014 spent a lot of money will not go to that that. But the \u2014 the\nyoung teachers who will come to that, or people to do research will somehow\nremember, because I have a lot of materials from the Holocaust Museum, they were\nused, from the educational department. I \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s going to Vienna too, you\nknow, to that museum, yeah.",
        "Q: Before I let you go further I want \u2014 I want to ask you a few questions. Could you\nplease tell me the full name of your book and the name of the author \u2014 your autobi \u2014\nyour \u2014 your biography, not an autobiography.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s \u201cDas Grosse Glick, der Lena Lieba Gitter Rosenblatt\u201d by\nPeter Schroeder. Now, the \u2014 they used my maiden name too. As a matter of fact\nthe publisher wanted only my maiden name because Gitter is not Jewish enough\nfor him, they wanted a very Jewish title. So then he wanted to leave Gitter out, but\nI said, you know, if I\u2019m \u2014 if he\u2019s gonna leave Gitter out, I have a lot of books and\nI\u2019m \u20141f people \u2014 they will not remember the title that book, but if they punch Gitter\nat the Library of Congress, some of my materials will jump up and they will find\nJuly 21, 1998\nme. But if he doesn\u2019t have that, then \u2014 so [indecipherable]. But I think constantly,\nit somewhat was a good choice because I\u2019m always lucky to find some people or\nsome people find me to do things with \u2014 that I\u2019m interested in to do.",

        "Q: I also wanted to \u2014 to ask you about your husband, you haven\u2019t mentioned him in\na while.",
        "A: Well, he died 1974. But he supported me with my work, and he ab \u2014 some of his\ncolleagues would say, you\u2019re making enough money and you let Lena travel around\nto Mississippi and \u2014 and [indecipherable] and all these different places. And I\nwent out of the country too, you know, to Japan, I went to Alaska\n[indecipherable]. But he said that\u2019s \u2014 he wanted me to have my job and my\nposition because he said men die before women, and so you will have something.\nWhen he was 40 years old he bought a book, teach your wife how to be a widow\nbecause he said why he \u2014 why he \u2014 the statistics, you know, men die before women\nbecause [indecipherable] we\u2019re gonna die before them.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "Q: You mentioned also a Holocaust memorial in Vienna. You have told me about\nthis in the past, about your work towards some kind of Holocaust memorial. Did\nyou want to elaborate further on that?",
        "A: No, there isn \u2014 there isn\u2019t one yet. I don\u2019t know if they did agree. Some Br-\nBritish designer or architect. But I don\u2019t know. We were involved, Schroeder and\nseveral of us from the two \u2014 we fought for the location and also we \u2014 we wrote\nletters to newspapers and so on, because we felt a museum that just go there an-and\ntouch names, it has to have something to walk in, for children to learn and to have\nproof, but ti \u2014 ti \u2014 having the names there, I didn\u2019t think this is \u2014 so I don\u2019t know\nwh-what is happening with that.",

        "A: In what?",
        "Q: In this Holocaust memorial in \u2014 in Austria, are you involved?",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I\u2019m not involved but from reading in the papers and \u2014 and the \u2014 th \u2014 the\nAustrians don\u2019t want it there, they want it somewhere else, you know. And I ag \u2014 I\nagree with the Austrians, if at all, but it should have something where people would\ngo in and have books, have photographs, have something that know what happened\nin, but they were coming to \u2014 to Vienna, th-they run to the museum, and the \u2014 all\nthe ar \u2014 the beautiful architecture, they will not go there. And these names will not\nmean anything to some of them.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "Q: You became involved in the War on Poverty and with the Peanut Brigade. Did\nyou get involved with any other social causes? The war in Vietnam or the\nWomen\u2019s Movement?",
        "A: I was involved in so many things, you know. Practically with all \u2014 with Carter,\nyou know, I was involved in. And you know, I moved in the day Carter went to the\nWhite House. And a \u2014 they didn\u2019t want me to, it was a special holiday, and I re \u2014 I\ncomposed a letter on this historic day that a President Carter moves to the White\nHouse, Lena Gitter moves to the Chevy Chase House and this is my address,\ntelephone number, please get in touch with me, come to see me. And the \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nhave the post office send them the change of address. So I\u2019m very involved with\nthem, in [indecipherable].

        "A: Oh, I really don\u2019t remember exactly, but we were happy some of the family\nmembers came back, and a lot of people somehow, always stopped in \u2014 in\nWashington with us and told us some of the experiences they had. But I d-don\u2019t \u2014 I\na-absolutely cannot remember, you know. I wasn\u2019t politically so involved in. Of\ncourse, we had \u2014 we knew a lot about the Nuremberg trials because some \u2014 a\nyoung friend of ours, he was a court reporter and he was in the Nuremberg trials,\nso when he came back he told us different things and so on. And here was a\u2014a\nnurse. She passed away, she\u2019s \u2014 was visiting \u2014 I mean, she was staying here too, and\nshe was at the Nuremberg trials, and she was assigned to take care of Eichmann \u2014\nEichmann? And \u2014 no, not Eichmann, another. And she was a nurse for him, and\nhe was a \u2014at-\u2014he-\u2014he was hanged. But the day he was sentenced, in the morning\nshe was called, she gave him his bath. And there was always a military man with\nher. And then she \u2014 he called her, she has a headache \u2014 he had a headache, she gave\nhim aspirin, and two hours later he \u2014 he was ha-hanged. So she told some of these\nthings, but I really \u2014 I don\u2019t know with what, I was so involved with other things.",

        "A: A lot in\u2014 in my family were involved in \u2014 1n \u2014 in Israel, and we had a lot of\nimmediate family who lived in Israel and were very involved in the whole\n[indecipherable]. That was \u2014 it\u2019s just everything\u2019s so mixed together now that I\ncan\u2019t separate the way you do now, you know. Maybe a few years ago I could have\ndone it, but not \u2014 not any more now.",
        "Q: You mentioned earlier about your Austrian citizenship. Can you share that with\nme now\u201d?",
        "A: That was about two years or three years ago. I-I really d-don\u2019t know exactly how\nit came but I read somewhere in these \u2014 I got \u201cDer Gemeinde\u201d from Vienna, this\niS a newspaper, magazine comes out every month, that people can get their\ncitizenship back. So I applied and I \u2014 I got it back and they had a very lovely party\nfor me at the embassy, too. And because I felt that I will be able to vote, I will be\nable to say something of what I don\u2019t like or what could be done. So we discussed,\nwe have meetings, and the attach\u00e9s and everybody is very helpful and trying to \u2014 to\nunderstand, you know, what had happened, because the people don\u2019t realize why,\npolitically Austria w-was not considered that they owe us money like some of the\nother countries, you know? So people think they\u2019re getting out, getting away. We\ngot a little bit money now from. And we hope to get a \u2014 the paintings that they sold,\nthe \u2014 they found, you know, a lot of paintings in one of the church basements. And\nso there are all these owners, so most of them have died, and so \u2014 so they are\nJuly 21, 1998\nplanning to give us a little bit of money, some of the older people, you know, so I\ndon\u2019t know, I hope I'll \u2014 Pll get a little bit money, I could use it. See, with that\nGerman club, we got involved in so many people coming, discussing things about\neducation, which is very important, we have to ask ourself, what \u2014 and n-not only\nGentiles, Jewish too, what have we done that s \u2014 people could grow up and being so\nterrible? We have to learn from what has apa \u2014 gone on in \u2014 in \u2014 in past. And \u2014 and\nbeing hateful, you don\u2019t really achieve anything, you have \u2014 it\u2019s very\n[indecipherable] to know what has happened, but you have to try to see if you can\nmake them understand and the responsibility that all of us have towards a peaceful\nworld. It\u2019s not only the Gentiles, their job, it\u2019s ours too, you know.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you how your experience as a Jewish refugee influenced the\nchoices that you made during your life.",

        "Q: I wanted to know ho-how your experience as a refugee, a Jewish refugee has\ninfluenced the choices that you made in your life.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t \u2014 I really don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t know, because I \u2014 I was so little with \u2014\nreally, in my work I was very little with Jewish people, you know? So I\u2014- ?m-\u2014I\nreally, you n \u2014 and ca \u2014 I cannot \u2014 everyone\u2019s involved in Jewish circles too,\nbecause in the \u2014 in Washington, th-th \u2014 there were very few doctors too, in \u2014\nJewish doctors, or t\u2014 or doctors who had come from \u2014 from the Holocaust. One of\nJuly 21, 1998\nthe doctors that came then and worked at \u2014 in the hospital with my husband. But we\nwere not so in-involved in it, the type of patients and the ty-type of the hospitals and\nthe doctors and everything.",
        "Q: What changes \u2014 what positive changes have you seen in America over the years\nsince you\u2019ve been living here?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a\u2014 made tremendous progress in technology and \u2014 and a lot of\nfreedom. But th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the program with the \u2014 with the poor people and the \u2014\nand the education, that is still \u2014 they\u2019re trying but we haven\u2019t \u2014 we really haven\u2019t\ndone anything. And also we have to study what has become of the children of these,\nparticularly of these very big shots Nazis? Their children are grown, they have\nchildren now too. How \u2014 there are some books written about them, but we have to\nask how their feeling is, and what \u2014 what they want, what we haven\u2019t \u2014 there\u2019s one\nthing we did neglect, I think, to take care in some way of these children. Because\nthey are the one who might really feel that they could be Nazis again. [break]",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, we were interrupted by someone who just walked in. We\u2019re back now,\nplease continue. You were \u2014 you were saying about what we\u2019ve neglected was to\npay attention to the \u2014 the grandchildren of the Nazi big shots.",
        "A: The children and the grandchildren now. We haven\u2019t done \u2014 some when their\nfathers were executed and so on \u2014 these children, in a \u2014 in a sense they were not\nresponsible what their fathers did. And we have not turned a little bit to see what\nJuly 21, 1998\ncould be done, because we \u2014 we haven\u2019t \u2014 we haven\u2019t helped them. And it\u2019s still \u2014\nsome research must be going on because these children and grandchildren can grow\nup being hateful and continue that. So it\u2019s not only, you know, we have to reach out\nfor the \u2014 the victim, and yeah, the non-victims, like the \u2014 one wrote a book, very\nfamous. I can\u2019t think about his name, an Austrian. Not the \u2014 not the one who kills\nyou, but the one who was killed. How \u2014 how 1s his responsibility [indecipherable]\nyou know? It\u2019s \u2014 in German it sounds [indecipherable] taught about the theater,\nyou know, it\u2019s \u2014 is responsible too. So, there is \u2014 education must study much more\nwh-what had happened to these people. Where have they gone, what was going on\nwith them.",
        "Q: I'd like you to reflect back on your life and tell me what do you think has been\nthe greatest contribution that you made to America?",
        "A: Well, that I was able to teach many to read and \u2014 and write. I invited my child\u2019s\n[indecipherable] invited him to one of the conferences, Montessori conferences as\na speaker, you know, to come. So, to see that im \u2014 it was very much for us, but for\nhim too, and for the other, to see the in \u2014 importance that he \u2014 even he doesn\u2019t have\nthe academic education, but what he could do for people, you know? And this is\nvery important. When I had the \u2014 the 90\" birthday, and that embassy gave a party.\nSo I invited the chef, we had a black chef and I invited some of these people who \u2014\nwho bathed me, or feed me or do things, to sh \u2014 and they were all in different\nJuly 21, 1998\ncostumes and different nationalities and a lot of black ones. To see \u2014 and I didn't\ninvite so much of that white staff because they\u2019re collecting the \u2014 the checks and\nstuff like that. But to show, you know, how w-we are dependent on \u2014 on the non-\nacademia to keep us alive and going. And so America has an \u2014 a long way to go\ntoo, to accept, you know, other nationalities, because we have here, right in the\nChevy Chase house, right, a United Nations now. You have seen different customs\nand different languages, and they have to learn to work together and to \u2014 and\nthey\u2019re poor \u2014 some have very poor English language. And you learn then \u2014 when\nyou go to English classes, you don\u2019t learn, give me eggs over on, or \u2014 or make my\nbass this way, or you know th \u2014 this \u2014 every day vocabulary is not taught for people,\nyou know. So they have a difficult \u2014 we have a difficult time to understand them\n[indecipherable]. So I'll \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I mean it \u2014 there\u2019s so many changes in\nthat \u2014 just in the medical technology because in my family is so many doctors. And\nmy husband was a physician and my grandson. I mean, from the \u2014 the little\nthermometer in your mouth now [indecipherable] you know. And the \u2014 the\nmedical technology is incredible, you know, that we have now. And food and so on.\nBut more and more we have to learn th-the \u2014 that we\u2019re the brother\u2019s keeper and the\nresponsibility that each of us have, the one that \u2014 who is preparing that \u2014 with\ncanning, that he is \u2014 really everything is clean, because we don\u2019t know now who\ncans, or who builds that car, so many people, who is responsible? So each of us, we\nJuly 21, 1998\nhave to teach much more responsibility, that I can die because you forgot to put this\nand that into the food, or \u2014 or you put something in \u2014 on \u2014 in my car, that, you\nknow, would \u2014 would not drive right, and it\u2019s \u2014 so this new technology has brought\na lot of responsibility too, that has to be taught in a way to the children too, you\nknow.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask, what\u2019s still on the horizon for you? What \u2014 what things would\nyou like yet to accomplish?",
        "A: Well, I would like to see all that material and stuff to \u2014 to go to Vienna and get\nin place. When you get my age you just want to be like Gandhi, he only wanted his\n[indecipherable] and \u2014 and his bible and his \u2014 what do you call that, the one wheel\n\u2014 you \u2014 spinning wheel. My grandchildren said the spinning wheel is an antique\nnow, that would be too costly for me to \u2014 for them to buy it for me. You know, I \u2014\neverything becomes very difficult. I had a professor in Vienna in psychology, and\nhe said, once a man, twice a child. Of course at that time he didn't know about\nwomen\u2019s liberation. And I feel that we\u2019re really like children, you know, if PIl\nforget where I put it and \u2014 and you know, and that brings me that research 1s now\ngoing on how Montessori can be used for Alzheimer patient. So there\u2019s some of\nthe things that we are teaching the young children would be very helpful to \u2014 as a\nmatter of fact, I\u2019m meeting in a couple days, somebody is coming with student rep \u2014\nJuly 21, 1998\nresearch and so I \u2014I don\u2019t know, I always get involved into something, that\u2019s easy.\nI don\u2019t have to plan it, I have the time.",
        "Q: There are many things that we obviously didn\u2019t cover today. Is there anything\nthat you wanted to add? Anything else that you wanted to talk about that \u2014 that we\ndidn\u2019t cover already\u201d?",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t know. I would like to \u2014 the \u2014 as I say, there\u2019s some of these\nthings that we more \u2014 more covered, and more \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s nice that the museum and\nall that, but the educational department, I think, should be in \u2014 more en-enlarged,\nsome more money has to go to \u2014 towards the education, I think it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my\ncriticism for the Holocaust Museum. But all the volunteers in my family, they are\nhooked on that. The \u2014 the days they \u2014 they go there and they \u2014 they don\u2019t want to\nmiss it, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a wonderful [indecipherable].

They feel very\ndepressed and so on. So, that \u2014 that\u2019s something for your whole life, I think.",
        "A: Icame with my husband and a two year old little girl.",
        "A: Well, I really couldn\u2019t support myself because I knew very little English, like\nplease and thank you, good morning and some [indecipherable]. My husband, who\nwas a physician and knew English and some other languages, got a job in Casualty\nHospital in Washington, D.C. driving the ambulance, and he got 50 dollars a\nmonth and room and board. So with 50 dollars a month my little girl and I stayed an\napartment house where he paid 12 dollar a week. So that\u2019s \u2014 because we could not \u2014\nthe only thing we could take with us was eight dollars per person. We had 24\ndollars with us. So that th \u2014 took a long time til we were able to \u2014 even to move into\na room and s \u2014 and use kitchen facilities. But you know, we \u2014 it somehow, with this\nHolocaust survivors, I think most of us did not expect that the government or\ndifferent places will take care of us. So it was a very difficult time and my little girl\nand I went to Americanization school to learn English. And we met a lot of other\nrefugees and came through France with some of them. And little by little we got to\nknow some of the physicians and we were 1n-invited a lot, and it was very difficult.\nIf you don\u2019t \u2014 if you don\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t reciprocate, you feel rather badly about. And we\ncame to visit one of the doctors, and the doctor\u2019s wife said, oh, go up the steps, on\nthe bedroom you put your coat on, and the bathroom is there. So I looked at myself,\nI said, what\u2019s wrong with me, you know, is my petticoat hanging out, how do I\nlook? But sh \u2014 sh \u2014I didn't realize that people want to make you comfortable, as\nyou know where the bathroom is, or where you can put your coat. Th-This is some\nJuly 21, 1998\nof the things which are not done in \u2014 in Vienna, or \u2014 or in Austria in a certain\nclass, you know, so \u2014 so there were many, many things. It took a long time to be\ncomfortable, to ask somebody. Now I will ask, oh, you have a lovely bag. If you\u2019re\nfinished with it, you don\u2019t it, give it to me. Or I go \u2014 I dr \u2014I dro \u2014 drove by, and \u2014\nsome friend, three in the afternoon and I was hungry and I would visit a friend and I\ns\u2014 and I-\u2014I said, Jean, I\u2019m so hungry, what do you have in your refrigerator? But I\nhad a Visa, I could si\u2014 and I had some dollar bills, and I could buy something, but\nit \u2014 it \u2014 it was different now, that I could ask people to do or give me something.\nBut when we first came it was very depressing to have to ask. We went in New\nYork to try to get sponsors for some family in France and it was in August, in\nSeptember, it was very, very hot. And when we walked into somebody\u2019s and they\noffered a glass of water, as you did right now, we said no thank you. We didn\u2019t even\nwant to accept a glass of water, we felt so \u2014 s-so bad about ourself that we couldn\u2019t\n[indecipherable]. So it was very wonderful that so many people gave affidavits.\nThey didn't even know the family, or they didn\u2019t \u2014 they had the s-same name or\nsomething, you know, and \u2014 and it was really wonderful the way, particularly the\nvery poor Jews in \u2014 the poorer class, you know. Of course, they had to have a\ncertain income, or a t-tax return to show that they would be able to \u2014 to support or \u2014\nor help \u2014 help the people. So it was a very di-difficult time.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Not really, because my husband was registered at the \u2014 at \u2014 at the embassy as a\nstudent to come to the United States with his professor. So he was on the \u2014 well,\nwe had, or my husband had family here in \u2014 in United States. But we \u2014 we had a\ncertain pride, you know, and just to take or ask me for something, it\u2019s very difficult.",
        "A: No. The pi \u2014 the peop \u2014 some knew Vienna or Austria from \u2014 from visiting\nthere or from movies and so on. People were not so \u2014 so interested in \u2014 in what had\nhappened, and a \u2014 it was very little known, you know. Even we didn\u2019t know too\nmuch about. We were very fortunate to leave \u2014 Hitler marched in on the 13\" of\nMarch, and we were very fortunate to leave the beginning of July, you know. So \u2014\nbut my husband had, as a physician, really terrible experiences. He could not treat\nJewish people at all, or \u2014 or in \u2014 not \u2014 he couldn\u2019t, not Jewish, Gentile people, but\nJewish people he could treat. And he would get phone calls from the family that the\nhusband was taken to concentration camp, Dachau, Buchenwald. On \u2014 on the\nfollowing week she received a \u2014 at \u2014 not a fa \u2014 didn\u2019t have faxes that time, a\ntelegram that her husband had died on pneumonia and they have \u2014 she would get\nthe ashes back. So he knew all these and he was very, very depressed, but it was\nvery difficult for him to get ready to leave, much more somehow than it was for me.\nYou know, and I felt for a longest, longest time until we had the first interview that\nJuly 21, 1998\nyou did, I felt very guilty that I, my family, we were able to escape and \u2014 here, and I\nwas able, you know, the education that I \u2014 that I have to make a success, and so did\nmy husband here, and here my family and \u2014 and friends lost their \u2014 their life, and \u2014\nand so I \u2014I felt very, very guilty. But now, since that \u2014 it has changed my attitude\nsince that interview and also I did not realize that I \u2014 that I am considered a\nHolocaust survivor. I didn\u2019t \u2014 never, never occurred to me to be in the same\ncategory. But now I feel that I have a voice, I can do something and I\u2019m very\nfortunate that I have that Montessori education, or early childhood education that I\nwas doing so much in the United States, was very successful. I got the gold medal\nfor my work in America for the \u2014 in Montessori. I got [indecipherable] what do\nyou call it, gold medal from the \u2014 from the embas \u2014 from Austria. I got my\ncitizenship back, and I have a voice. Being angry, it \u2014 1t does not help. So I feel now\nthat since the \u2014 all my writing, I have written about 18 \u2014 not \u2014 not high class and not\npeople who made the best seller list, but they helped the people, the poor people\nthat I worked in Mississippi to write and be able to vo \u2014 to vote.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Well, w-w \u2014 in Vienna, you know, after the first World War, we began to ask\nourselves, what is wrong with education, what has to be done? And we were young\npeople and so we wanted to change the world. So Montessori was brought, she was\na physician from Italy and she brought the Montessori method to Vienna. So we\nall ran to these lectures and got a \u2014 a book that sh \u2014 the first book she wrote and so\non. And you had, in Vienna you had to do first your exam as a kindergarten\nteacher, you know, and then you could specialize in [indecipherable] in\nMontessori. So I took the \u2014 the training, then when I got married, I opened up a\nkindergarten, and I \u2014 cause I had the middle or the upper middle class children. I did\nnot have the poor \u2014 the poor ones as I really had here in America. So na \u2014 when I\nfirst came, it took a long time til I learned enough English to take some of the tests\nthat were necessary to establish myself. And at that time was the English word\nagainst the English [indecipherable] that\u2019s what the \u2014 some of \u2014 of the newcomers\nhave to learn, you know, that you have to know the language in order to be political\nactive or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or have a job and [indecipherable] thing. So first I got\ndifferent jobs in special education, because at that time in the early sh \u2014 the special\neducation was on the lower bottom of the education. So \u2014 so when I applied they\nwere happy to \u2014 to get me to take care of the special class children. And then they\nwere very surprised the big success, because I was bootlegging Montessori. I made\na lot of material, I use that method of Montessori, and so the supervisor, she used\nJuly 21, 1998\nto bring teachers or students to observe in my \u2014 in my classes and so on, to see what\nI\u2019m doing.",
        "A: For one thing, I did not initiate. Montessori was here in the early \u2014 1913 she wa\n\u2014 she was here, and there were schools and by 1918 when the war \u2014 when the first\nWorld War start, these schools were all closed. Montessori approach 1s entirely\ndifferent, it\u2019s very difficult to explain on \u2014 on a few minutes.",
        "A: Okay. For one thing, it\u2019s a different layout of a classroom. Children are \u2014 are not\nexpected because they\u2019re six years old that they be reading, or three years old. We\ndon\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 in aclassroom we have children from three to six, for instance,\nbecause a three year old one might be able to read, or a four year old one, but\nunable to kick a ball or something than a six year one. So they\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s a such \u2014 like\nin a family. We do a different classroom arrangement. So we don\u2019t have this is the\nclass two years old, or four year one, we have them \u2014 we have now infants\u2019 classes\ntoo, you know. So this is one of the things. And also that th-there are certain rules\nand \u2014 and regulations in a Montessori classroom and people in th \u2014 it has to work\nlike a \u2014 like a society. You can \u2014 I mean, you have to show them, for instance, how\nJuly 21, 1998\nto open a door and close a door. How to lift a chair and put it down. And how \u2014 and\nif you play with something, that y \u2014 I cannot come and say, this I want to play now\nwith it. So, he learns that he has to ask. We have little rugs for the children, and they\nput their toys on that rug, and this is his territory. So they have to learn territorial\nrights. It\u2019s laid out the way, like a library with the books and stuff. You just can\u2019t\ntake out a book and then, oh, I want to read the book. We have to return it to there,\nand th-th-then next child can. So that the \u2014 he learns in \u2014 the way a classroom and\nthe way the whole thing is handled, he learns the rules for society. So, th-this is a\nvery im \u2014 important, and the different expectations for the parents too, to \u2014 to\nunderstand that, you know\u201d? And the teacher is not called a teacher, she is a\ndirectress, she directs activities. She doesn\u2019t sit at her desk and the children come\nin, she has to be like a hostess, stand at the door, greet the children. And as she\ngreets them, says Esther, you have a lovely dress and your hair is done so nice. Oh,\nand you have such a doll. And Esther says, oh my grandma came and she brought\nme that doll. So you know from that, that the child will want to walk around the\nclassroom, show the doll to her. She doesn\u2019t want to disturb. And then there comes\nJim, and Jim is so sad. So he said, you know, teach \u2014 some didn\u2019t know, you know,\nvery much. He said, you know, the police came and \u2014 and took my ha \u2014 my father\nto jail. Then you know that this child needs help, somebody to help him to deal with\nit. And so that your aid spends a lot of time because otherwise he\u2019s gonna run\nJuly 21, 1998\naround, disturbing and knocking things over [indecipherable] knocking things\nover. He \u2014 somehow he has to deal with it, but then you assign somebody to help\nhim, hold his hand, take him around and so on. So that Montessori said like a\nhostess. If she greets the people at the door and says, oh, Mrs. Finder, you have a\nlovely dress today, and \u2014 and then you tell [indecipherable] or your husband to go\nand get yourself a drink. You don\u2019t talk to her the rest of your party, but she will\ncome home and she says, you know, Mrs. Finder saw what a beautiful dress I had,\nyou know. So the same way children know they \u2014 they were recognized, and that\nyou knew dealing with their problems or \u2014 and also, this teaches sort of manners to\nthe children, to greet people in the morning. Some people talking \u2014 were critical\nwhen I talked at one of the university, I had some black students, teachers. And he\nsaid, oh yes, you come from a country, ki-kings and queens and you shake hands\nand you do all these nice things. But it\u2019s a\u2014 a very important thing to be nice, and\nso on. And so we do a lot training and what you call practical life. And under that\ncomes also the manners and behavior. And what is father of the cons \u2014 of the \u2014 the\npresident, the first president, we had? George Washington. When he was 15 years\nold, he wrote a book on manners that is \u2014 can be had. Now, we have \u2014 \u201cThe\nWashington Post\u201d has a columnist and she wrote just recently a very great book on\nmanners, the ya \u2014 and once I said, like lubrication of your wheels. At that time very\nJuly 21, 1998\nfew people have cars, you know. But so she had a different \u2014 so these are some of\nthe things that were \u2014 we were teaching. It\u2019s very difficult to do it, and you know.",
        "A: The first time when I was called to Mississippi.",
        "A: That was in the, I think, early 60s or something. And it was the War on Poverty,\nwhich [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, so we can \u2014 politically th-the time ca\n[indecipherable] exception. So I went to Mississippi to work with poor mothers\nand \u2014 and poor children. The \u2014 most of the southerners are Baptists, so \u2014 and so we\nhad \u2014 the daycare centers that we opened for the War on Poverty was in Baptist\nchurches. We could not bring kindergarten teachers in, or \u2014 because they don\u2019t want\nto have jobs and such. So we t-tried to train the people who lived there. I worked in\nNaches, Mississippi, was my first assignment, and at that time, Governor Bell did\nnot \u2014 he was the governor of Mississippi and he did not want the \u2014 the money\nassigned for the president to use it. We came under a different, other th-thing. And\nit was very, very difficult to \u2014 to teach these mothers how they could read\nthemselves. I had to teach the mothers reading and writing and show them on a\nJuly 21, 1998\nsomewhat basically they could \u2014 I did not know that I\u2019m all of a sudden a political\nworker because I helped these mothers, and some of their husbands would come in\ntoo, to learn to read and write so they could do the \u2014 an-and johns \u2014 not Johnson,\nthe Kennedys used to come on weekends and help. So these people were able to go\nto the polls. And I worked with Charles Evers, who was the first black mayor to be\nelected in Mississippi. And was \u2014 so I became a political worker without realizing\nwhat just \u2014 I didn\u2019t know that teaching somebody to read and write is \u2014 is a very big\nthing that you\u2019re giving. And ma \u2014 my motto 1s the word against the weapon. If we\nwill teach people to read and write, then \u2014 then they don\u2019t need a weapon to \u2014 to get\nsome of the things.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Well, 1d\u2014Id\u2014I can\u2019t put it on dates. I\u2019m \u2014 I was \u2014 on the 17\" this month, I was\n93 years old. So you don\u2019t \u2014 your memory is not so, on dates and so on, I\u2019m not so\n\u2014 I really \u2014 well, we opened up the first mo \u2014 Montessori training center in \u2014 in \u2014 1n\nNew Jersey, at one of the universities, they opened up to try to train people in\nMontessori. And there was Nancy Rambush(ph) arrived, an American who had\nstudied the method in \u2014 in \u2014 1n Paris and so on. So little by little we started training\ncenters, but that was all middle class, for middle class because it was quite\nexpensive and \u2014 and mothers began to go to work, or they are forced, they didn\u2019t\nhave husbands, they had died in the war, whatever. And so most of the \u2014 some\npeople [indecipherable] started the, you know.",
        "A: With what program?",
        "A: Well, I really couldn\u2019t tell you exactly the \u2014 the years, but anyway it \u2014 it \u2014 really,\nwhen the Sputnik came out in space, America began to ask themselves, what is\nwrong with our education, that the Soviet take us over? So, they looked and they | \u2014\nand since Montessori was the first woman who was asked to come to the \u2014 when\nthe war was over in 1918, to the first conference in peace, and she wrote a little\nJuly 21, 1998\nbooklet, Peace and Education, and she was very concerned about the peace, you\nknow. So we looked \u2014 and then I went to England for awhile to take a \u2014 a training\ncourse, and I went to different places in \u2014 in \u2014 in Europe, you know, for retraining.\nIn the beginning we got a lot of teachers from India, because Montessori was, for\n10 years she was in India, because she was Italian citizen and she would not follow\n\u2014 what was the name in \u2014 I forgot his name. What? Yeah, mo \u2014 and then she went to\n\u2014 to Spain, and then she had \u2014 she would not follow [indecipherable] the\ndirections of, what was his name [indecipherable]. So \u2014 so we \u2014 so finally she went\nto India, because when the war broke out the \u2014 as an Italian citizen she had \u2014 she\nwas for 10 years in India, and she became a f-friend with Rabindra Tagore, the\nfirst who got the N-Nobel prize [indecipherable] Indian, he wrote books and poetry\nand he was very much involved in peace. And also the Indira Gandhi, with\nGandhi. He didn't \u2014 the two of them were not \u2014 Gandhi and Montessori were\nhistorically living the same time, but also they shared the whole idea. He was for\nnon-violence for adults and she non-violence for children. At that time, as we see\nand hear it now in the newspapers and radio, the children were just suffering.\nPerhaps not as much, but they were \u2014 they \u2014 and when they were eight years old\nthey went to mines to work and so on. So, you see, she was very, very involved in \u2014\nin \u2014 in peace movement. And so, this is very important for us in \u2014 and to do this,\nand that\u2019s why I am so happy that my materials and all that is going to Vienna, yet,\nJuly 21, 1998\nw-we \u2014 we paid a [indecipherable] we\u2019ll be able to do something towards peace,\nand also that the university, they realize here is a Holocaust survivor and what he\ndid with that method, you know, they will know something, cause a lot of materials\nand stuff, I\u2019m working with these Holocaust interns at the museum, they\u2019re from\nAustria. It\u2019s the fourth one or fifth one that I am working, we worked on different\nthings, with the Montessori method and others, how it can be. So that I feel now\nthat, of the end of my life, I feel, as Montessori said, in the service of the child, that\nthat will go on. And, but it also \u2014 it will be a separate room where all the materials\nand books are being \u2014 and films and [indecipherable] si \u2014 si \u2014 many books,\nbecause textbooks are so much written for the upper middle class. Or they are tested\non the university, on the professor\u2019s children. But there aren\u2019t books and materials\nfor the children who don\u2019t have that background and don\u2019t go to the museums and\nall that business.",
        "A: Well, I talked all the time with the embassy and with the people from \u2014 these\ninterns, the importance of \u2014 of education and so on. So, I don\u2019t know how it came\nabout, but I \u2014 not only that I have my books, but I have 200 books, thi \u2014 this \u2014 that\u2019s\nwritten by other writers and also Montessori was not the discoverer of her method,\nJuly 21, 1998\nthere were two French doctors before her. And I went \u2014 and she went to Paris, it\u2019s\nfunny, I went to Paris, too, to \u2014 at the same \u2014 later on. And \u2014 and I got th-the\nmaterials on th-these doctors wrote. I have Montessori books \u2019m \u2014?\u2019m-\u2014I\u2019m\u2014I\ntaught a class in \u2014 1n Japan, so I have a book on \u2014 Montessori book in Japanese. I\nhave the Madonna painted on a silk. The Madonna 1s a Japanese, and the holy child\nshe\u2019s holding looks like a Japanese too, and so 1t shows you how universal that\nmethod. We \u2014 I lectured in \u2014 in Israel a few times. So you see, this is a method that\nhas some technical ways to teach peace, you know.",
        "A: The books \u2014 the books are here, and I got \u2014 for instance I got an \u2014 this is\nElisabeth who you read about, Gehrer. She is the mi \u2014 Minister of Education in \u2014\nin Vienna. We [indecipherable] have a librarian, a young librarian from Catholic\nUniversity and he comes and he has registered \u2014 we sent already 14 cartons of\nbooks to Vienna, films and different materials. And the embassy ships this stuff,\nbut it\u2019s packed in my apartment and the different \u2014 I hope to get some volunteers to\nhelp, because I have videos and I have a lot of material. It\u2019s not only my books, but\n\u2014and also, there are other books that teachers need to read. Now this room that\nthey\u2019re opening in Vienna, it\u2019s not gonna be \u2014 people cannot borrow these books,\nit\u2019s they can go and read it there, you see? And so I hope, you know, that this \u2014 this\nHolocaust \u2014 and I\u2019m so happy that, because there\u2019s a \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the plans was\nJuly 21, 1998\ngoing through to have a \u2014 stones with the names on of the survi \u2014 of the Holocaust\nvictims.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s gonna be in th \u2014 Vienna \u2014 | don\u2019t think we have any private universities\nin Vienna. This is [indecipherable] which is part of the university, people in early\nchildhood education. And they have different libraries, but mine is gonna be a\nspecial room, and it will have my collection in there, but it\u2019s only people can do\nresearch there, but they cannot borrow any of the books and so on.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that, and they would like to, in Vienna the Dr.\n[indecipherable] is in charge of this particular program, the director. He would like\nmaybe by September to \u2014 but it\u2019s very difficult to get it all shipped and packed and\n\u2014 and also that you have to have lists, and you can\u2019t just go on, and \u2014 so I have\nJuly 21, 1998\nlibrarian and they sorting, you know, the unpublished papers and books and \u2014 and\nmagazines and th-the different speeches that I have given, or other people, you\nknow, that deal with Montessori. So, it\u2019s ga \u2014 quite a lot of work. I don\u2019t ever have\nany room now to live in my apartment, that\u2019s [indecipherable] I\u2019m really working\non the \u2014",
        "A: Two year ago, a\u2014a professor and \u2014 and journalist and so on from Graz, you\nknow, in Austria, came, she \u2014 to the United States at the Library of Congress. And\nshe had heard me speak, and when \u2014 when the biography was published and I was\nthere to promote it. She heard me speak, but she could not come up to \u2014 there were\nso many people in line, she had to leave. So when she came for research she called\nme, and she would like to see me. So I invited her for lunch, and we became friend,\nand she was the one who sort of said, lis \u2014 it would be a good idea 1f you would get\nto know a-and get your material to know in v \u2014 in Vienna. So she sort of started,\nand I was thinking about it, but I really did not realize it\u2019s gonna be such a big\nproject. So, let\u2019s see. Last year, the \u2014 the Austrian embassy gave me the \u2014 the gold\nmedal for the work that I did because I worked a lot with these Holocaust interns,\ntook them to some of the Jewish places, I had them for Jewish holidays because\nthey have to learn to know how we\u2019re celebrating them. And also, I \u2014 on all \u2014 on all\nJuly 21, 1998\nthe holidays, I \u2014 I invite them here to a little meal, my family and friends, and then I\ninvite one or two with \u2014 of the Holocaust, or non-Jewish people to come. And I\ndon\u2019t want the people to bring me flowers or candy. Everybody has to write\nsomething about that holiday. So, even these Holocaust survivors have written very\ninteresting things, and I\u2019ve taken them to the Temple Sinai to some \u2014 so the-they\nlearning a lot of \u2014 of Jewish life, to \u2014 and to understand. And [indecipherable] in\nmy family I have a lot, and two of my granddaughters are married to non-Jews too,\nyou know. So I\u2019m very interested of this understanding, you know. So, I don\u2019t\nknow, cause a lot of people come, when they come to the Holocaust Museum, they\ncome to visit me too, and I \u2014 I lived in different things [indecipherable]. But\nanyway, I don\u2019t know exactly, but all of a sudden th \u2014 told the \u2014 one of the attaches\nthat I think maybe I have so many books, perhaps they would be interested in\nVienna to get it. So he asked me, and he made sort of a temporary list and send it to\nVienna. And they were very happy, and so they have already 14 boxes, and that\u2019s\njust with books and then films, and videos and I have hundreds of beautiful\nphotography of the poor people in Mississippi and in New England, and different\nplaces, and it \u2014 it opens the world to the people here and in Vienna too, because\nthey \u2014 they only think America is you know, the \u2014 the rich country, you know, it \u2014\non the Fifth Avenue, or Madison Avenue, whatever they see. So that \u2014 I\u2019m taking\nthat movie attitude away from other people. So we started, and I looked for\nJuly 21, 1998\nsomebody to help with the packing, and I got this young librarian at Catholic\nUniversity who is very interested, and when he\u2019s off he comes and works a few\nhours and packs a thing. And then the embassy ships it.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 a lot of people in Montessori knew me and some people got involved\nin \u2014 in these different issues and \u2014 in America. And I got a phone call one day,\nwould I come to Mississippi and introduce a little bit of Montessori? So I went\ndown, and at that time in Mississippi there were different [indecipherable]\nMontessori, some people were from other universities with specialties in \u2014 in \u2014 in\ntheir field. So, what \u2014 we were hired by the, I th-think one of the Kennedy\u2019s\nbrother-in-law, I don\u2019t know, he was in charge. Anyway, we were paid. So we got\nto Mississippi, and my husband, and we felt this is an opportunity to repay\nsomething to America. And when I got to Naches, Mississippi, I \u2014 I \u2014 one of the in\n\u2014 newspapers came down for an interview, one of the Catholic paper. And \u2014 a-and\nin there I didn't even remember, but in there I had said I felt when in Mississippi\nthat I\u2019m back in \u2014 under Hitler, you know, the way things were going. And then to\ncome to my hats. I wore hats because I can\u2019t always comb my hair so well. So I\nwore hats, and I have different hats. And the Ku Klux Klan was very much behind\nJuly 21, 1998\nme, they didn't want us to come in to teach the blacks. But I heard from somebody\nwho was friends with the Ku Klux Klan too, said we can\u2019t take \u2014 we don\u2019t \u2014 Hitler\ndidn\u2019t want that little Jewish woman, we can\u2019t do it either, because everybody\nknows her by her hats. So that was a \u2014 that sort of saved me from being killed by\nthe klan.",
        "A: Right. So people, some people when they go on a trip, my grandchildren or\nsomething, they bring me \u2014 I have chapeaux from all over the world. And there is a\n\u2014a place here in the United States, they have only \u2014 a\u2014 a woman has a shop only\nwith hats. I shouldn\u2019t nor \u2014 need to go there, and see what I don\u2019t have. S-So \u2014 but I\ndidn\u2019t stay the whole time, you see, in Mississippi, I did work and to train them,\nand I would fly back to Washington, then go down again for a week. And so it\nwasn\u2019t that I continuously stayed there. But you see, my teaching and \u2014 and the\npolitic was \u2014 was one thing. Because like I worked in Naches with the poor people\nwho didn't know how to read, an-and \u2014 and Charles Evers, he was \u2014 he was from\nNaches too, and he was running for an office. So he \u2014 sometimes I was up here with\nhim, you know, on \u2014 when he \u2014 when he was \u2014 spoke somewhere, or we have\ncatfish, or [indecipherable] and stuff. So that \u2014 you know, so I \u2014 I appeared and I\nwas some help, you know, the [indecipherable] thing, and he was elected not\nbecause just of me [indecipherable]. But I was then at the \u2014 what\u2019s the city, the\nJuly 21, 1998\ncapital city, when he was elected. But we did not \u2014 our checks came from a\ndifferent group, not from \u2014 from the state of Mississippi, you know. So many, many\nthings I somehow adopted that Montessori method and I have to rewrite a lot to\nunderstand their backgrounds and their needs and so on. And it was very difficult in\nthe beginning because these mothers wouldn't sleep or clean up. They said, oh don\u2019t\nI know that they don\u2019t have to do these slave type work? And I said, you know, but\nstill, you know, we have to clean up. And then I called the \u2014 here the national\ngallery of art and ask the cur \u2014 one of the curators in education, could he send me\nsome paintings that glorify work? And he did. And so we hung it in the different\nclassrooms, and so they \u2014 the \u201cGirl with a Broom\u201d by Rembrandt, they realized\nnow the \u2014 somehow, without having ever been to a museum, they knew that\npaintings are something very precious. And \u2014 and [indecipherable] and different\npaintings and we had it in the classrooms. And 1-it \u2014 during that time, War on\nPoverty, they were, you know, the se-senators and congressmen and people would\ncome to Mississippi and they would come to visit these centers. And \u2014 and we \u2014 I\ntaught them the names of these paintings and \u2014 on the \u2014 and so when these pa \u2014\npeople came, and these pro-professors and so, and painting, and \u2014 and she could\nsay, oh this is, the name of the painting, say something. All of a sudden that little\nblack woman without any art education was at the same level as the senator or the\nJuly 21, 1998\n[indecipherable] and she knew. So the arts plays a stellar role too, in the many\nthings that I have done in the art.",
        "A: They sent in \u2014 the educational division at the national gallery, or most of them\nhave an education department. They send me slides and they send me, not too large,\nbut anyway, reproductions, you know.",
        "A: Well, the fear that \u2014 that people had, to \u2014 to go to a certain store. For instance, in\nVienna when I was going in stores that belonged to some of Jewish people, I didn't\nhave look. I had braids, and \u2014 and a \u2014 they would say, fraulein, you can\u2019t go into\nthat, the Nazis would tell me you can\u2019t go into the store, because they thought I \u2014 y-\nyou know, that\u2019s only for Jewish people, you know. And we could not be out at \u2014\nvery late in the evening, and you couldn\u2019t go into \u2014 to a movie, or you couldn\u2019t \u2014\nand it was the same thing, because the blacks, you could go only on the \u2014 some of\nthe gallery [indecipherable]. And they couldn\u2019t sit in a \u2014 a restaurant. I mean, the\nthings that were done to us in \u2014 in \u2014 under Hitler, these conditions existed there. So\nJuly 21, 1998\nI was able, you know, and then I worked with \u2014 with others, not only Mississippi,\nwith other states, flying in, and I wrote papers and I wrote little pamphlets and\ndifferent things to help the people to \u2014 to learn. And I was so happy to see that \u2014\nwhat\u2019s that comedian, that black one? He lost his \u2014 his son was killed?",
        "A: Yeah. I \u2014 I was on a program years ago with him at \u2014 on special education for\nblack chil \u2014 what he has written now, books for children to read, and \u2014 and they\nhave \u2014 they have [indecipherable] they have blacks and \u2014 and it\u2019s so important that\nchildren find something where they can relate to, what not \u2014 you know, the father\ncoming home with the attach\u00e9, you know. And when the children are asked they say\nthey don\u2019t \u2014 no, my father doesn\u2019t do anything, he goes with the \u2014 with that attach\u00e9\ncase, you know. So \u2014 so from what I have done over the years was an example for\nsome other daycare centers and places to \u2014 to use and how to teach adults, you\nknow, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Very little, there either. They were so, when e \u2014 so poor enough, and to \u2014 and the\nthings they had to do, they really did not have time. Just \u2014 just to be eight hours in\nthat day care center, and then I had them paint and clean up, because they were an\nawfully messy and \u2014 and dirty, these places. And so we didn't have any money for\nJuly 21, 1998\npainting, but the people came early in the morning. They had to open at eight, or\nthey would come at six and paint these day care centers and scrub floors and \u2014 and\nwe made waste baskets and \u2014 and we made bookshelves, getting \u2014 at that time you\nstill could get boxes, you know, crates where apples came, they were very well\ndone, I \u2014 as a matter of fact I had them for years as bookcases in my first apartment\nin United States. So, we were so involved with their own life that they did not have\ntime to \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 it \u2014 I traveled mostly with \u2014 with educators and so on, along with\nphysicians, so I don\u2019t know really, I\u2019m \u2014 one is so involved in what else was going\non and we didn\u2019t talk too much about our past either, you know.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Most of the time I went on my own, and met some people from \u2014 from other\nstates or from other universities or colleges and so on.",
        "A: Yeah, because they used to come to Naches on weekends with their airplane and\nthey would help the people, you know, prepare them too for \u2014 for their rights. I\nwasn\u2019t so invol \u2014 you know, I wasn\u2019t politishin(ph) involved or no, you know, with\nthe rights, or what in \u2014 people need to know, or you know, to get to the polls, and\npeople are very much afraid, you know, too. So the Kennedys would bring a lot of\nstudents down, too. And you know, the people that sent it, the students who were\nnot dressed well on the campground, they said, look, we are dirty, we want models\nof people who are dressed properly and combed and so on.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t remember their names now. You\u2019re asking me t \u2014 hundreds and\nthousands of names it seems.",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I\u2019m a member of the Women\u2019s National Democratic club, and when\nCarter was running for office 1-in \u2014 where was it, in Pennsylvania and a couple of\nother states, the Republicans had the majority [indecipherable]. So the \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow how the club arranged what they called the Peanut Brigade. They had I think\nJuly 21, 1998\nabout four or five very huge buses, and they had banners, they were called the uni \u2014\nand [indecipherable] you know, that you could t-talk, you know, on the different,\nand they were asking some \u2014 they \u2014 we had a lot of young students, political science\nfrom the different universities, but they also ask for some volunteers, you know,\nteachers and so on. So I didn\u2019t know exactly what I could do, but I thought I\u2019 Il go.\nAnd that was a very wonderful experience, to go to the different places and talk to\nthe teachers of their importance in educating the children that they will be able to \u2014\nto go to [indecipherable] and so on. So, we stopped at different, you know,\nwherever there was some \u2014 some monument, we si \u2014 had to stop there, the\nnewspaper come, and we had \u2014 I still have that shirts with their whole \u2014 with\nCarter and so on. So, when he \u2014 when he was elected we were invited specially to\nthe White House and stuff. And then he was the first one who got \u2014 when my bi \u2014\nbiography came out and he was in Vienna, so the president gave him a book of the\n\u2014a-\u2014the \u2014 we worked with \u2014 with Mrs. Carter a lot, but n-not her \u2014 really so much\nwith him, I mean, I was there and so, but \u2014",
        "A: A f\u2014a few friends and I have organized a little German club, and so we meeting\nonce \u2014 once a month. And one day a Mrs. Schroeder came, and she is a journalist\nand so is her husband. And she came to the German club and said, I know I don\u2019t\nJuly 21, 1998\nneed to learn German, however I want to know what makes you guys get together\nand speak German, you know. And somehow, after a year or so she was there \u2014 she\nasks her husband, and she asked me did I want to do a book, because from what I\nwas saying at the club, or somehow she thought that I have \u2014 we \u2014 I had a story to\ntell. So we did. So it was a \u2014 quite a decision, and also you know, I did not \u2014 I\nhadn\u2019t planned, you know, and \u2014 and a lot of dates and stuff like you are asking me.\nI\u2019m a\u2014 mathematics wasn\u2019t my strong forte. So, 1t was v-very difficult, but as a\njournalist, I mean like he went to \u2014 they went to Vienna when they were doing the \u2014\nand they found the coffee shop where I went to, and they found the schools I went\nto, and they brought photographs and \u2014 and they got 1-1in \u2014 Austria pu-published\nevery year, every month what\u2019s happening and every day. So he found the 1905,\nwhat in July, had happened, you know. And there were similar things being \u2014 we\nwill want now [indecipherable] that. And some from newspaper they were \u2014 I have\nan awful lot of newspaper clippings, cause wherever I was, somehow there was an\ninterview on \u2014 in some newspapers, so \u2014 we could establish some days where I went\nor what I did, you know, from the newspaper clippings. But this \u2014 my memory 1s\nnot so \u2014 so good any more. In particular for dates. But, as I say, what \u2014 they were\nable, you know, to search through newspapers, and si \u2014 and there are some books\nand there\u2019s a chapter or something about me said in \u2014 in there, on the War on\nPoverty people who wrote books, so in several books was something about me or\nJuly 21, 1998\nmy work, you know, so \u2014 so that\u2019s how it came. It took a long time, and \u2014 but\nunfortunately it isn\u2019t translated into English yet. That bothers my grandchildren\nbecause they never learned any German because my daughter was so \u2014 she would\nnot want to have her children on Hitler\u2019s language. So \u2014 so the \u2014 course there\u2019s not\nenough on Montessori in there, and \u2014 well, you can\u2019t di \u2014 you know, write so much\nwhen you live a long life as I did, and \u2014 but I was so fortunate as a title, it \u2014 the\nbook, I was very lucky that what I did, 1t was a success, you know. And had some \u2014\neverybody lives a life and has some sad things, but c\u2019est la vie, and it doesn\u2019t have\nto \u2014 just to sit and \u2014 and feel sorry for oneself, that I lost my daughter and I had to\ntake care of my grandchildren. But I\u2019m very lucky, they all did not go on drugs,\nthey finished their education, they are married, they have children and they are\nworking and I can be very happy with that. And that my work that I did is\nsuccessful \u2014 was very successful in that it\u2019s a \u2014 a [indecipherable] and we\u2019ll find a\nplace and I feel in a way it will constantly remind people when they go there to\nvisit, that this Jewish woman was a Holocaust \u2014 what the Holocaust room, even if\nthey will not have everybody\u2019s name, but somehow I feel with the videos and with\nth-the \u2014 everything is going to be there, that it will be some \u2014 1n paying something\nback that I did not suffer. But I feel it \u2014 that the work that I have done that is being \u2014\nbeing used, it will tell the story of these people that I did not know and that had to\nsuffer and \u2014 and die such a terrible death. So I feel that really I have to be grateful\nJuly 21, 1998\nparticular to Spielberg that his first video that made me feel I have some spot in\nthat history and I have done something with my life, and that I have in some way, is\n\u2014 1s \u2014 I wanted to dedicate this memorial to these people that \u2014 that I don\u2019t know,\nand some names I know. But I always wanted when they were talking about a stone\nwall with the names, the people in Vienna have such magnificent buildings and\nmuseums. People on \u2014 spent a lot of money will not go to that that. But the \u2014 the\nyoung teachers who will come to that, or people to do research will somehow\nremember, because I have a lot of materials from the Holocaust Museum, they were\nused, from the educational department. I \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s going to Vienna too, you\nknow, to that museum, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s \u201cDas Grosse Glick, der Lena Lieba Gitter Rosenblatt\u201d by\nPeter Schroeder. Now, the \u2014 they used my maiden name too. As a matter of fact\nthe publisher wanted only my maiden name because Gitter is not Jewish enough\nfor him, they wanted a very Jewish title. So then he wanted to leave Gitter out, but\nI said, you know, if I\u2019m \u2014 if he\u2019s gonna leave Gitter out, I have a lot of books and\nI\u2019m \u20141f people \u2014 they will not remember the title that book, but if they punch Gitter\nat the Library of Congress, some of my materials will jump up and they will find\nJuly 21, 1998\nme. But if he doesn\u2019t have that, then \u2014 so [indecipherable]. But I think constantly,\nit somewhat was a good choice because I\u2019m always lucky to find some people or\nsome people find me to do things with \u2014 that I\u2019m interested in to do.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the date right now, can you imagine? It\u2019s something, you know \u2014 1-\ni\u2014 some dates you really don\u2019t want to remember, so \u2014 it\u2019s about 15 years now, I\nthink.",
        "A: Well, he died 1974. But he supported me with my work, and he ab \u2014 some of his\ncolleagues would say, you\u2019re making enough money and you let Lena travel around\nto Mississippi and \u2014 and [indecipherable] and all these different places. And I\nwent out of the country too, you know, to Japan, I went to Alaska\n[indecipherable]. But he said that\u2019s \u2014 he wanted me to have my job and my\nposition because he said men die before women, and so you will have something.\nWhen he was 40 years old he bought a book, teach your wife how to be a widow\nbecause he said why he \u2014 why he \u2014 the statistics, you know, men die before women\nbecause [indecipherable] we\u2019re gonna die before them.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: No, there isn \u2014 there isn\u2019t one yet. I don\u2019t know if they did agree. Some Br-\nBritish designer or architect. But I don\u2019t know. We were involved, Schroeder and\nseveral of us from the two \u2014 we fought for the location and also we \u2014 we wrote\nletters to newspapers and so on, because we felt a museum that just go there an-and\ntouch names, it has to have something to walk in, for children to learn and to have\nproof, but ti \u2014 ti \u2014 having the names there, I didn\u2019t think this is \u2014 so I don\u2019t know\nwh-what is happening with that.",
        "A: In what?",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I\u2019m not involved but from reading in the papers and \u2014 and the \u2014 th \u2014 the\nAustrians don\u2019t want it there, they want it somewhere else, you know. And I ag \u2014 I\nagree with the Austrians, if at all, but it should have something where people would\ngo in and have books, have photographs, have something that know what happened\nin, but they were coming to \u2014 to Vienna, th-they run to the museum, and the \u2014 all\nthe ar \u2014 the beautiful architecture, they will not go there. And these names will not\nmean anything to some of them.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: I was involved in so many things, you know. Practically with all \u2014 with Carter,\nyou know, I was involved in. And you know, I moved in the day Carter went to the\nWhite House. And a \u2014 they didn\u2019t want me to, it was a special holiday, and I re \u2014 I\ncomposed a letter on this historic day that a President Carter moves to the White\nHouse, Lena Gitter moves to the Chevy Chase House and this is my address,\ntelephone number, please get in touch with me, come to see me. And the \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nhave the post office send them the change of address. So I\u2019m very involved with\nthem, in [indecipherable]. So you sometimes, th-the \u2014 the names, even while I\u2019m\nspeaking, di-di \u2014 disappear.",
        "A: Okay.\n[break]",
        "A: Sure.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: Oh, I really don\u2019t remember exactly, but we were happy some of the family\nmembers came back, and a lot of people somehow, always stopped in \u2014 in\nWashington with us and told us some of the experiences they had. But I d-don\u2019t \u2014 I\na-absolutely cannot remember, you know. I wasn\u2019t politically so involved in. Of\ncourse, we had \u2014 we knew a lot about the Nuremberg trials because some \u2014 a\nyoung friend of ours, he was a court reporter and he was in the Nuremberg trials,\nso when he came back he told us different things and so on. And here was a\u2014a\nnurse. She passed away, she\u2019s \u2014 was visiting \u2014 I mean, she was staying here too, and\nshe was at the Nuremberg trials, and she was assigned to take care of Eichmann \u2014\nEichmann? And \u2014 no, not Eichmann, another. And she was a nurse for him, and\nhe was a \u2014at-\u2014he-\u2014he was hanged. But the day he was sentenced, in the morning\nshe was called, she gave him his bath. And there was always a military man with\nher. And then she \u2014 he called her, she has a headache \u2014 he had a headache, she gave\nhim aspirin, and two hours later he \u2014 he was ha-hanged. So she told some of these\nthings, but I really \u2014 I don\u2019t know with what, I was so involved with other things.\nJuly 21, 1998",
        "A: A lot in\u2014 in my family were involved in \u2014 1n \u2014 in Israel, and we had a lot of\nimmediate family who lived in Israel and were very involved in the whole\n[indecipherable]. That was \u2014 it\u2019s just everything\u2019s so mixed together now that I\ncan\u2019t separate the way you do now, you know. Maybe a few years ago I could have\ndone it, but not \u2014 not any more now.",
        "A: That was about two years or three years ago. I-I really d-don\u2019t know exactly how\nit came but I read somewhere in these \u2014 I got \u201cDer Gemeinde\u201d from Vienna, this\niS a newspaper, magazine comes out every month, that people can get their\ncitizenship back. So I applied and I \u2014 I got it back and they had a very lovely party\nfor me at the embassy, too. And because I felt that I will be able to vote, I will be\nable to say something of what I don\u2019t like or what could be done. So we discussed,\nwe have meetings, and the attach\u00e9s and everybody is very helpful and trying to \u2014 to\nunderstand, you know, what had happened, because the people don\u2019t realize why,\npolitically Austria w-was not considered that they owe us money like some of the\nother countries, you know? So people think they\u2019re getting out, getting away. We\ngot a little bit money now from. And we hope to get a \u2014 the paintings that they sold,\nthe \u2014 they found, you know, a lot of paintings in one of the church basements. And\nso there are all these owners, so most of them have died, and so \u2014 so they are\nJuly 21, 1998\nplanning to give us a little bit of money, some of the older people, you know, so I\ndon\u2019t know, I hope I'll \u2014 Pll get a little bit money, I could use it. See, with that\nGerman club, we got involved in so many people coming, discussing things about\neducation, which is very important, we have to ask ourself, what \u2014 and n-not only\nGentiles, Jewish too, what have we done that s \u2014 people could grow up and being so\nterrible? We have to learn from what has apa \u2014 gone on in \u2014 in \u2014 in past. And \u2014 and\nbeing hateful, you don\u2019t really achieve anything, you have \u2014 it\u2019s very\n[indecipherable] to know what has happened, but you have to try to see if you can\nmake them understand and the responsibility that all of us have towards a peaceful\nworld. It\u2019s not only the Gentiles, their job, it\u2019s ours too, you know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t understand your question, would you repeat it?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t \u2014 I really don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t know, because I \u2014 I was so little with \u2014\nreally, in my work I was very little with Jewish people, you know? So I\u2014- ?m-\u2014I\nreally, you n \u2014 and ca \u2014 I cannot \u2014 everyone\u2019s involved in Jewish circles too,\nbecause in the \u2014 in Washington, th-th \u2014 there were very few doctors too, in \u2014\nJewish doctors, or t\u2014 or doctors who had come from \u2014 from the Holocaust. One of\nJuly 21, 1998\nthe doctors that came then and worked at \u2014 in the hospital with my husband. But we\nwere not so in-involved in it, the type of patients and the ty-type of the hospitals and\nthe doctors and everything.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a\u2014 made tremendous progress in technology and \u2014 and a lot of\nfreedom. But th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the program with the \u2014 with the poor people and the \u2014\nand the education, that is still \u2014 they\u2019re trying but we haven\u2019t \u2014 we really haven\u2019t\ndone anything. And also we have to study what has become of the children of these,\nparticularly of these very big shots Nazis? Their children are grown, they have\nchildren now too. How \u2014 there are some books written about them, but we have to\nask how their feeling is, and what \u2014 what they want, what we haven\u2019t \u2014 there\u2019s one\nthing we did neglect, I think, to take care in some way of these children. Because\nthey are the one who might really feel that they could be Nazis again. [break]",
        "A: The children and the grandchildren now. We haven\u2019t done \u2014 some when their\nfathers were executed and so on \u2014 these children, in a \u2014 in a sense they were not\nresponsible what their fathers did. And we have not turned a little bit to see what\nJuly 21, 1998\ncould be done, because we \u2014 we haven\u2019t \u2014 we haven\u2019t helped them. And it\u2019s still \u2014\nsome research must be going on because these children and grandchildren can grow\nup being hateful and continue that. So it\u2019s not only, you know, we have to reach out\nfor the \u2014 the victim, and yeah, the non-victims, like the \u2014 one wrote a book, very\nfamous. I can\u2019t think about his name, an Austrian. Not the \u2014 not the one who kills\nyou, but the one who was killed. How \u2014 how 1s his responsibility [indecipherable]\nyou know? It\u2019s \u2014 in German it sounds [indecipherable] taught about the theater,\nyou know, it\u2019s \u2014 is responsible too. So, there is \u2014 education must study much more\nwh-what had happened to these people. Where have they gone, what was going on\nwith them.",
        "A: Well, that I was able to teach many to read and \u2014 and write. I invited my child\u2019s\n[indecipherable] invited him to one of the conferences, Montessori conferences as\na speaker, you know, to come. So, to see that im \u2014 it was very much for us, but for\nhim too, and for the other, to see the in \u2014 importance that he \u2014 even he doesn\u2019t have\nthe academic education, but what he could do for people, you know? And this is\nvery important. When I had the \u2014 the 90\" birthday, and that embassy gave a party.\nSo I invited the chef, we had a black chef and I invited some of these people who \u2014\nwho bathed me, or feed me or do things, to sh \u2014 and they were all in different\nJuly 21, 1998\ncostumes and different nationalities and a lot of black ones. To see \u2014 and I didn't\ninvite so much of that white staff because they\u2019re collecting the \u2014 the checks and\nstuff like that. But to show, you know, how w-we are dependent on \u2014 on the non-\nacademia to keep us alive and going. And so America has an \u2014 a long way to go\ntoo, to accept, you know, other nationalities, because we have here, right in the\nChevy Chase house, right, a United Nations now. You have seen different customs\nand different languages, and they have to learn to work together and to \u2014 and\nthey\u2019re poor \u2014 some have very poor English language. And you learn then \u2014 when\nyou go to English classes, you don\u2019t learn, give me eggs over on, or \u2014 or make my\nbass this way, or you know th \u2014 this \u2014 every day vocabulary is not taught for people,\nyou know. So they have a difficult \u2014 we have a difficult time to understand them\n[indecipherable]. So I'll \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I mean it \u2014 there\u2019s so many changes in\nthat \u2014 just in the medical technology because in my family is so many doctors. And\nmy husband was a physician and my grandson. I mean, from the \u2014 the little\nthermometer in your mouth now [indecipherable] you know. And the \u2014 the\nmedical technology is incredible, you know, that we have now. And food and so on.\nBut more and more we have to learn th-the \u2014 that we\u2019re the brother\u2019s keeper and the\nresponsibility that each of us have, the one that \u2014 who is preparing that \u2014 with\ncanning, that he is \u2014 really everything is clean, because we don\u2019t know now who\ncans, or who builds that car, so many people, who is responsible? So each of us, we\nJuly 21, 1998\nhave to teach much more responsibility, that I can die because you forgot to put this\nand that into the food, or \u2014 or you put something in \u2014 on \u2014 in my car, that, you\nknow, would \u2014 would not drive right, and it\u2019s \u2014 so this new technology has brought\na lot of responsibility too, that has to be taught in a way to the children too, you\nknow.",
        "A: Well, I would like to see all that material and stuff to \u2014 to go to Vienna and get\nin place. When you get my age you just want to be like Gandhi, he only wanted his\n[indecipherable] and \u2014 and his bible and his \u2014 what do you call that, the one wheel\n\u2014 you \u2014 spinning wheel. My grandchildren said the spinning wheel is an antique\nnow, that would be too costly for me to \u2014 for them to buy it for me. You know, I \u2014\neverything becomes very difficult. I had a professor in Vienna in psychology, and\nhe said, once a man, twice a child. Of course at that time he didn't know about\nwomen\u2019s liberation. And I feel that we\u2019re really like children, you know, if PIl\nforget where I put it and \u2014 and you know, and that brings me that research 1s now\ngoing on how Montessori can be used for Alzheimer patient. So there\u2019s some of\nthe things that we are teaching the young children would be very helpful to \u2014 as a\nmatter of fact, I\u2019m meeting in a couple days, somebody is coming with student rep \u2014\nJuly 21, 1998\nresearch and so I \u2014I don\u2019t know, I always get involved into something, that\u2019s easy.\nI don\u2019t have to plan it, I have the time.",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t know. I would like to \u2014 the \u2014 as I say, there\u2019s some of these\nthings that we more \u2014 more covered, and more \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s nice that the museum and\nall that, but the educational department, I think, should be in \u2014 more en-enlarged,\nsome more money has to go to \u2014 towards the education, I think it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my\ncriticism for the Holocaust Museum. But all the volunteers in my family, they are\nhooked on that. The \u2014 the days they \u2014 they go there and they \u2014 they don\u2019t want to\nmiss it, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a wonderful [indecipherable].
