        "Q: Could you tell us your name please?",
        "A: My name is Rochelle Blackman Slivka. I was born in Vilno on April 18th in 1922.",
        "Q: What was life like?",
        "A: Well, my father worked in Vilno in the Jewish Kehilla in the social services department.\nMy mother was a housewife. We we were growing up, my sister and myself. We had nice\nhappy family. We went to a private elementary school and then we went to a Hebrew-\nspeaking high school. They didn't accept too many Jews, not at all any Jews to public\nhigh schools. They had to go to private schools, Yiddish-speaking, or Polish-speaking, or\nHebrew-speaking schools. My father was a Zionist. He sent us to a Hebrew-speaking\nhigh school. And life in Poland for us wasn't easy. We went to different schools from the\nnon-Jewish kids. Sometimes the non-Jewish children used to beat us up while we were\ngoing to school and we had to wear different uniforms. We were with different numbers\nthan the non-Jewish kids. But life was not bad except the anti-Semitism in Poland. We\nhad a normal life. Our family wasn't orthodox. We were more conservative and I'm sorry\n[Pause |",
        "Q: What about friends....?",
        "A: We had a lot of friends. We socialized a lot with [friends]...we had; My parents had a lot\nof friends in the city and our social life was quite active in town, until the war broke out\nbetween, in 1939 between Germany and Poland. We we were at the time at our summer\nhome in outskirts of Vilno, but we heard that Germany attacked Poland in September Ist,\n1939. And we they bombed the cities, but we, with help with other relatives from other\nrelatives, we came back to the city and and a couple 01:04: of days later the Russians\ncame into our city. The war only lasted seventeen days between Poland and Germany\nbecause Poland wasn't prepared for the war at all and at the same time Germany and the\nSoviet Union decided to divide Poland in two halves. We were lucky enough to fall to the\nRussians, and when the Russians came in to our city, life stabilized a little. We went back\nto school for a while. People went back to work. My father still worked at the Vilno\nKehilla and life was going on pretty normal at this time. But it didn't last too long,\nbecause the Germans, the Russians decided to give Vilno back to the Lithuanians because\nthe Lithuanians always claimed that Vilno was the capital city of Lithuania and the Polish\ngovernment took [it] away from Lithuania in the Ist World War. And then they gave\nback Vilno to the Lithuanians and when the Lithuanians came in the first day there was a\npogrom on the Jews but after the pogrom, a couple of days later, 1t quieted down....",
        "Q:",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Can you describe the progrom?",
        "A: Yes they beat up quite quite a few Jews. They killed some some Jews and it was quite a\nscare. We didn't know what will happen to us, because we didn't know about Lithuania\ntoo much. We didn't know...even|though] I had an uncle in Lithuania but I still didn't\nknow what to expect from the Lithuanians. But after a while it quieted down and the city\ncame to normal again and we went back to work, our parents. My father went back to\nwork and we went back to school in Vilno to the Hebrew school and we learned a new\nlanguage. It wasn't easy but we had to learn. And life was going normal and I, we had an\nuncle in Lithuania because my mother came from Lithuania, Vilkaviskis in Lithuania and\nshe had a brother there and she hadn't seen him for over twenty years and for the first\ntime she met him. She saw him. And it was quite an excitement in the house to meet my\nuncle that we never knew and my cousins that we never knew and we didn't know what\nto think about them, didn't know what to expect from our uncle and aunt and cousins. But\nthey were very nice to us. They brought us a lot of food to eat, because we had a shortage\nin Vilno for a while, and then we went back to school learn, life was going on normally,\nbut after a while the Russians decided to take away all the Baltic lands to incorporate it to\nRussia. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and then the Russians came in again. Then it was a\nlittle bit different. We went back to school but we couldn't learn any more any Hebrew.\nWe didn't have any Hebrew schools anymore. We had to learn more Russian and nothing\nHebrew. Then the people went back to work again. My father worked still in the Kehilla,\nbut some other people they round[ed] up, a lot of Zionists, Zionist people and sent them\naway to Russia, to Siberia. They sent away a lot of Poles and a lot of Jews, rich Jews they\ntook away from the city and sent away. But it but 1t wasn't bad. The situation wasn't too\nbad. We weren't threatened with our lives. We had all the time we had not enough food\nbut we could survive because the Russians whatever they saw they used to take away\neverything from the stores. They never saw so much stuff in the stores. Whatever they\nsaw they grabbed it and they used to send away to Russia. And but we lived somehow\nand we were happy. We had our families and all our relatives. We had a lot of relatives in\nthe city of Vilno. My mother had a lot of cousins there. And we used to get together all\nthe time and naturally talk about old times but this lasted like that until June 22nd, 1941\nwhen Germany attacked Russia. And Vilno was, the city of Vilno was bombed. They\ndestroyed quite a bit of the city and a couple days later the Germans came in to our city\nand then our troubles started. (Pause) When the Germans came in it was still...we didn't\nknow what to expect. We didn't know even when people, refugees were coming in from\nfrom the other side, from the German occupied Poland, from Poland occupied by the\nGermans, they used to come in and they used to tell us stories how the Germans used to\ntake away Jews and they never came back and all kinds of stories about the German, SS\nGermany but we didn't believe them. We said it couldn't happen to us. They couldn't be\nso mean. It's such a civilized country. It couldn't be so bad. But after a while we did find\nout that it happen to us too, because when the Germans came in, in the beginning they\ndidn't know who 1s a Jew and who is not a Jew, and but our non-Jewish neighbors used to\npoint out the Jewish people. The kids with whom we used to play outside in the yard or\non the street, they used to point point out a Jew, because we lived altogether in the same\nsection and they used to take away the Jews. The SS with the help of the Ukrainian police\nor the Lithuanian police, they used to take away the Jews. Whenever we used to stand in\nline, they used to point out a Jew and they used to drag us out of the lines and every once\nin a while they used to come in to our houses and take away some people and...it was a\nvery scary time for us, especially for the young people, because we didn't know what\n[they would do]...we were afraid they'll come and take our parents away always, every\ntime we saw a German, and we had to walk around [them] [and] we had a curfew. Until\nfive o'clock in the evening we were allowed to walk and we weren't allowed to walk on\nthe sidewalk. We had to walk in the middle of the street and bow for every German. It it\nwas a very scary time. We didn't know who 1s going to be next and what's going to\nhappen to us and we we weren't allowed to go to school anymore and life was going on\nlike that until '41 right before the Jewish holidays. They...the SS decided to make a ghetto\nin our town, in Vilno and there a poor section where a lot of Jews used to live there and\nthe Jewish home for the aged was there. The biggest synagogue of the city of Vilno was\nthere. The orphanage. The Jewish hospital was there, and a lot of poor Jews lived around\nthis section and one night the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the\nLithuanians, they came in and took out all the Jews from there and they drove them to a\nplace, Ponary [in the] outskirts of Vilno there and they shot them all there. We heard\nscreaming and yelling and crying during the night, but we weren't allowed to look of the\nwindow because those who looked out were shot. We didn't know what was going on\nanyway until the next day our neighbors told us what was going on. We had a lot of\nrelatives there. My mother's cousins, all of my mother's relatives lived there and couple\nof weeks later they round up all the Jews from the city and the suburbs and they put us all\nin this ghetto, and surrounded us with walls and with guards and we had to live in one\napartment, two to three families in a two room apartment. When we came in those\napartments, we saw some of the beds were still made still where people were still asleep.\nThey were disturbed. They took them out in the middle of the night from the beds. Some\nthe tables were still set. People evidently were still eating, and this made a very bad\nimpression of us, for us because our relatives, our our families were taken away. They\nwere killed. We had the Judenrat, Kehilla changed the name to Judenrat and my father\nwas still working in the Judenrat there. We had our own police there. They organized\npolice, fire department. They had stores in the ghetto. We had even schools for children.\nThe little kids used to go to school. I personally was too old to go to school already.\nWhen the war started I was seventeen years old and we had to have a permit to live. At\nfirst they gave us yellow cards. Those who didn't get a yellow card were taken away from\nthe ghetto and we never saw those people. ( and a couple months..) We used to, people\nused to go out from the ghetto to work in factories or in railroad station, wherever they\nneeded some help, workers, they sent out our Jews there. And couple months later they\ndecided to change those cards again for different kind of cards. Pink cards, and then they\ntook away those that didn't have any pink cards and we never saw those people again.\nAnd it was pretty frightening all the time. Every time they used to give us a little more\nbread or horse meat we knew that's it's going to be a roundup of Jews the next couple\ndays. They even came in one day, the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the\nLithuanian police and took away all the children from school, and those little kids never\nhad a chance to say goodbye to their parents. The parents, when they came home from\nwork they didn't find their kids anymore. We we lived all the time in fright; we were\nfrightened all the time. We didn't know what was going to be next or who is going to be\nnext. One time they caught my father walking on a street. They round him [up] too, but\nhe escaped from there somehow. I don't remember how, but he did escape. My mother\nwas sick at the time in the ghetto and she died. She was in the hospital and we didn't have\nenough medication to help her, and she died in the ghetto. We weren't allowed to go to\nthe cemetery even to see where she was buried. My father went because he helped to dig\nthe grave in the cemetery and he knew exactly where, but the children weren't allowed to\ngo out of the ghetto. We lived in fear all the time. And every day was about the same\nthing as the previous day. We didn't know...then right before the holidays in 1943, right\nbefore the Jewish holidays, the New Year, the SS decided to liquidate the ghetto and they\ntold us over the loudspeaker that the ghetto is going to be liquidated and we are going to\nbe resettled. They didn't tell us where, and and we can take only what we can carry with\nus, no more. Naturally we didn't have much what to carry, only our clothes. That's all we\ncould take. And the next day we all congregated at the gate and they took us to a field in\nright outskirts of Vilno. I don't remember the name where it was, but when we came to\nthe field we saw three people hanging, a young woman, and two young men and they told\nus over the loudspeaker that in case somebody has in mind to run away, to escape from\nthis field, will be shot or hanged right in front of us. Men were taken away separately\nfrom the women. The men were taken to a concentration camp in Estonia and there they\nwere killed. They were all burned alive for...they put logs and people and logs and\nburned and brought gasoline in and burned them and couple a years ago when we were in\nIsrael, we went to visit the kibbutz Lokhamei haGettaoth and I saw the picture how they\nput up the people and I saw my father's name and his number and it was very emotional\nto see. Then how thorough the Germans were to record all what was happening to these\nJews and we had to stay the whole night in the field, the women. Only my sister and\nmyself. It was a very cold, miserable, rainy evening. When a child was crying or baby\nwas crying, our guards used to take away the child from the mother and take it for (by?)\ntheir feet and tear it in half and throw it back to the mother. Some mothers, from fright,\neven choked their own children. (Pause) It was going on like this the whole night. The\nnext morning, we stayed in line and we were sorted. Those who went left went to\nextermination camps like Majdanek or Treblinka or some other camps, and I was\nfortunate enough with my sister went to the right. I was lucky enough that they put\nus...they sorted us the same... they didn't separate us, and we went to the right. Then they\nput us in cattle cars, about a hundred women to a car, and no bathrooms, no food, no\nwater. We had to ride for a couple of days in the cattle cars until we came to Latvia, to\nKaiserwald. That's a suburb of Riga, and we were met by SS men and they told us that\nthis concentration camp is built on Jewish graves. All the Jews from Riga were\nconcentrated there. They were shot and they buried them and they built the concentration\ncamp there. We had to go through the showers. They shaved our heads in case somebody\nwill run away they should find [her], they should know that we are the Jews from the\nconcentration camp, recognize us. They gave us stripped clothes with numbers. From\nthen on we never were called by the name, only by the number. Then they put us in\nbarracks. We had to sleep on boards. No blankets, no pillows. We used to get up five\no'clock in the morning and be counted and sometimes our kapo made a mistake in\ncounting us, [then] we had to stay for another couple of hours and for punishment. Then\nthey used to give us a piece of bread and some black water that they called coffee and we\nused to go out to work from the concentration camp to dig ditches or at the railroad or in\nfactories. Some people were lucky enough worked in the concentration camp sorting the\nclothes that they took away from us and while I was working digging ditches, there was a\nguard who asked me from where I was and I told him that I was from Vilno. Then I asked\nhim where ...and he told me is from Lithuania. I said oh, I told him that my mother comes\nfrom Lithuania. He asked me from where, and I told him from where, from Vilkoviskis.\nHe says oh he comes from there too, and he knew my uncle. They were friends before the\nwar. They went to school together and they were very good friends, and he told me how\nmy uncle was killed in Vilkoviskis. They shot them all there. They didn't take them in\nany concentration camps or in any ghettos, nothing. They shot them all there. And then\nwe used to come back to the concentration camp and be counted again and then they took\nus and then they gave us some coffee and bread again and we used to retire to our\nbarracks. In the barracks we used to sit and talk, talk about old times, talk about our\nparents and the schools that we went to and every once in a while, couple times a week, a\nGerman SS woman used to come in with a big whip and beat us up without any reason.\nUsed to curse us. Used to yell at us. It was very frightening. We never knew what time it\nwas. We never knew what day it was, because we didn't have any clocks. We didn't have\nany watches. We didn't have any calendars. We didn't know anything what was going on\nin this world. Then one day, beginning of 1944 or so or in the middle, somewhere around\nthere, they told us that the next day they are going to take us to another concentration\ncamp and they took us again by cattle cars to a concentration camp in east Germany\nsomewhere, called Stuthof. When we came there they took away everything what we had\nagain and they shaved our heads again. They gave us different numbers, but it was much\nworse in this concentration camp. It was much bigger and we weren't allowed to go out\nfrom the camp. We had to stay in the camp all the time. We weren't allowed to go to the\nbathroom by ourselves. We had to have permission. If our kapo felt like taking us, it was\nalright. If not, it's too bad. We couldn't wash ourselves. We couldn't go to to clean up, to\nwash our hands or faces. We were filthy there. We were hungry. We looked like\nskeletons all the time. And I was sick with typhoid and my sister was sick with typhoid\nand we weren't allowed to go to see a doctor. But we had to nurse ourselves. We did...I\nhelped my sister. My sister helped me and women were dying there like flies. We were\ntreated very badly there. The German SS treated us very very bad there. Some women\ncouldn't take it any longer. They used to sneak out at night and go to the barbed wire and\ntouch the barbed wire and kill themselves. We used to get up early in the morning. We\nused to get our rations, bread and black coffee and once in a while they used to give us\nsoup. It was called soup. It was from rotten potato peels or rotten cabbage soup, and then\nat the evening again they used to get the same thing...bread and coffee, and whenever we\nall sat around there and talked all the time or we were quiet. We couldn't do anything. We\nwere so sick and we were so tired there. We were, we looked like skeletons. We were\ndirty. Our faces were black from dirt and in 1944, at the end, it was in December, end of\nDecember, right before Christmas, they decided to liquidate this concentration camp I\nguess and because the war was going on...getting bad and they told us and the next day\nthey took us out of the concentration camp, but this time we had to walk. We didn't have\nany warm clothes, only that what we had on ourselves and we didn't have any shoes. We\nhad to cover our feet with rags and when somebody, a woman died we used to take away\nher rags from her feet and cover our feet with with more rags to keep our feet warm. We\nused to take away her clothes to keep ourselves warm, to put on something else on us.\nWhile we were walking we saw some people lying on the ground, frozen, men frozen\ndead. We knew that a transport of Jews went by there. We used to start out about six\no'clock to walk, in the morning, six o'clock in the morning to walk with a piece of bread\nand the black coffee and walk the whole day until we find a place at night where to stay.\nThere was a barn somewhere, or a church...wherever they could find a place for us. Then\nthey used to give us again a piece of bread and coffee and we used to go to sleep. We\nwalked like that for six weeks. We weren't allowed to to bend over to take some snow to\nwet our lips. Those who did went over to take, they were shot by the guards. Those who\nhelped each other to walk were shot. We weren't allowed to do that either. We walked\nlike that for six weeks. Then we came to a barn and when we woke up the next day, we\ndidn't see our guards anymore. We saw some old German SS men. They took away the\nyoung ones because they needed them on the front, and they substituted with old SS men.\nThey were even worse than the young ones. They used to beat us up. Used to curse us.\nWe were so sick in this barn that we couldn't do anything. We were lying around all day\nlong in the barn. We didn't have bathroom facilities. We had to go right behind in back of\nthe barn. We used to get coffee in the morning with a piece of bread and sometimes\nnoontime they used to give us a little soup and then in the evening again the same bread\nand that was our food for the day. We were in this barn for a couple of months and\nwomen were dying all day, every single day. We started out with five thousand women.\nAbout two hundred and fifty survived. And one night, one day one SS man told us that\nthe next day we are going to be digging ditches for ourselves, because the war is going\nvery badly and they don't want us to fall in anybody's hands, and we're going to be shot\nand buried there, not to fall into anybody's hands. But the next day...during the night we\nheard some shelling and bombing and we didn't know what was going on, but when we\ngot up in the morning we didn't see any guards. We didn't see anybody. And we were\nafraid to go anywhere and we didn't have the strength to go anywhere. But a couple hours\nlater we saw a jeep full with soldiers came, Russian soldiers...and they told us that the\nwar was over right here in this part of Germany and we can go wherever we want to. We\ncouldn't go anywhere. We didn't have the strength and we were so filthy. We full of lice.\nOur bodies were beaten up. We were dirty. Lot of people have frozen hands and their feet\nwere frozen. Couple hours later a truck came and took us in to the village and we came in\nto the village. We didn't see any Germans there, because the people retreated with the\nGerman army and they let us loose and we started to grab food, whatever we could find.\nWe ate whatever we found, whatever we could. Some people overate too much. They\nthey didn't eat the right food. They didn't eat normally. They took sick and died. Some\nhad to have their feet amputated because they were so frozen they couldn't walk anymore\non them. We had to bathe ourselves in kerosene every day to get rid of the lice. Burn our\nclothes every day until we got rid rid of all the dirt and all the lice. We were in this\nvillage for a couple of months. Then after we started to feel better, my sister and myself\ndecided to go back to Vilno. We knew that our mother is dead and we heard in Struthof\nthat my father was killed in Estonia, but we still wanted to go back to our city because we\nleft a lot of household goods and some personal stuff with our non-Jewish neighbors, and\nwe thought maybe we can get back from them and sell it and use the money for clothes or\nother things. It wasn't easy to go back because we didn't have any transportation. We had\nto hitch hike by truck or by...they didn't have any cars at that time, or by train...whichever\nwe could. [It]took us a long time to get back and when we came to the border between\nPoland and the Soviet Union, we met some people coming out of the city and they told us\nnot to go back to Vilno because the situation is very bad there. There is not enough food\nand not enough work..not to go back to the city, but my sister decided she is going back\nto get some stuff back from our non-Jewish neighbors, but when she came to their houses\nto ask for our clothes and other stuff, nobody gave her back anything. They threw her out\nof their houses. I was in Byalistok, on the border between Poland and Russia, and I\nregistered in the Jewish community there and I put an ad in the Jewish paper here in the\nUnited States. I had a grandmother here, my mother's mother and four uncles, my\nmother's four brothers, and two sisters in this country. And but I didn't remember their\naddresses. I knew only my uncle's last name and my grandmother's last name I\nknew...and I put an ad and my grandmother used to read every day the Jewish paper and\nshe found my name and she contacted all my aunts and uncles that I am alive, and couple\nof months later I received a letter from a one of my uncles and he urged me to go back to\nthe American zone, to west Germany and from there he will try to bring me to the United\nStates. It wasn't easy to go back from one country to another country. I lived in Poland\nand I moved from Byalistok to Lodz and I lived there for a couple of months until I got\nacquainted with another organization, with other people, and I tried to cross the border\nwith them, with another kibbutz organization and from there I tried to to cross the border\nto Czechoslovakia, but it wasn't easy. The first time we were caught by the Polish guards\nand they sent us back, back to Poland. We couldn't cross. But after a couple of weeks\nlater we tried to cross again, and we succeeded. We crossed to Czechoslovakia. We\nstayed in Czechoslovakia a couple weeks and from there we crossed again to West\nGermany, through the Alps, but this time we had warm clothes. We had boots and we had\nenough food to eat. It wasn't so bad the walking and in 1946 I came to the West\nGermany, Munich, West Germany. And there I took sick and I was in a hospital in Sankt\nCecilien (?). That's not far from Munich that hospital there and at the same hospital one\nof my cousins was a doctor in this hospital, but he didn't know I was there and I didn't\nknow he was there and a couple months later I received another letter from another uncle\nfrom Dover, New Hampshire, that his son was in this camp as a doctor, but he left a day\nbefore I got the letter. I got the letter a day after he left and I couldn't get in touch with\nhim anymore. And then I got in touch with all my uncles and my aunts. They helped me a\nlot. When I got better I went back to school there. I learned a profession... I learned\nnursing. I went to nursing school and I learned to be a nurse. Then I moved to Landsburg\nand there I worked in a DP hospital, in a displaced person hospital. We lived in displaced\npersons camp, they were camps, but we lived...we had our own rooms and we had normal\nbeds and bedding. We lived like normal people, only in a camp. And we had enough food\nthere. We had enough clothing. We were supported by the UNRRA and by the Jewish, by\nJoint Distribution Committee here from the United States. My aunts and uncles, they\nused to send me help, bundles for help me out with clothes and other things. Then after a\nwhile I went back to Munich. I lived in Munich for a while. I worked there in the office\nand then my uncles started to work on for me to come to this country. It wasn't easy in\nthe beginning to come to this country. The State Department didn't open the gates yet to\ncome in to this country. They didn't let in anybody yet. And no country wanted us except\nPalestine at the time but Palestine...we couldn't because they were under the British rule\nand they didn't let in Jews to come in there and those who went illegally were caught and\nsent to Cypress to camps there. And I was sitting in Germany and waiting and in 1948,\nwhen Truman was President, they passed a law that all the DP people, displaced persons,\ncan come in, to to be admitted to this country, and my uncle from Brookline,\nMassachusetts, sent me a contract that I won't be a burden to the United States\nGovernment and he is taking full responsibility to help me and to support me, and then I\ngot a visa, permit to come to this country, and while I was sitting in, and while I was\nwaiting to be interviewed by the CIA...they interviewed me and everything went fine.\nThey told that in a couple of days to a week I'll be called to the immigration office and be\ngoing to the United States. I was waiting and waiting and waiting and nobody called me\nand nobody said anything. I went to find out what happened, and they looked [me] up. I\nwas crossed off the list that I am in the United States already. Somebody on my papers\nwent to the United States, but I showed them my identification card who I was. Then\nright away the same day I went through the doctors and all the preliminary things and in\ntwo days I had to get ready and go to Bremerhaven and from there I have to take a boat to\nthe United States and I came to Bremerhaven. I waited there. They they couldn't decide if\nI am a Polish citizen or a Lithuanian citizen, which papers which papers to send me...you\nare Polish citizen or a Lithuanian citizen. They they waited and they waited. They didn't\nknow what to do. Then I wrote to my uncle...I sent a telegram to my uncle that they don't\nlet me out from Germany because they don't know which papers to let me go and if I\ncan't come I'll go to Israel, because I can't wait any longer. Couple days later they called\nme from Joint Distribution that the next day I'm going to go to the United States. My\nuncle was very active in the Joint Distribution and they probably called the Consulate\nhere and they made up mind what to do with me and the next day I took the boat. One\nwent to Massachusetts, to Boston, and one went to New York, and I took the boat to\nMassachusetts, to Boston. While I was on the boat they asked me if I am going to\nMassachusetts. I says no, I am not going to Massachusetts. I am going to Boston, because\nI didn't know the difference between state or whatever it was...I didn't know...well,\nanyway I came on May 18th, 1949 I came to this country. And I was met at the boat. One\nof my uncles from Pittsfield from ...not from Pittsfield...from Dover, New Hampshire,\nmet me. He was at the boat and my aunt and my uncle from Boston, from Brookline, and\none aunt from Portland, Maine met me at the boat. I didn't know my relatives at all. I\ndidn't know what to expect. I didn't know what's what. But when I came to this country\nand I got off the boat, they all greeted me very nicely and they opened their homes for\nme. They were very very good to me. And then the same evening I met some other uncles\ncame to visit me (pause - crying\u2019?)...1t was very emotional, and my cousins were sitting in\nfront of the house and waiting for me to come. They were excited. (Crying?) And then\nmy life changed completely, for the best. After all we came to a normal country. We were\nthe not normal people. We didn't know what to expect and what without a language, not\nknowing anybody, and I had a wonderful welcome from my relatives, from all my\nrelatives, they welcomed me beautifully. All my aunts and uncles, they're very good. One\nuncle was dead already but his daughter was very nice to me. We were very good friends,\nand I took sick here. I was operated for a while...I was operated and after I got well, I\nwent back... went to work. I worked at the Beth Israel hospital, not as a nurse because I\ncouldn't... didn't know the language well and I didn't know too much about the nursing\nhere in the United States, and I worked as a nurses' aid in the Beth Israel Hospital for a\ncouple of years. When I...then I met my husband in 1951 and in 1952...it's a funny\nthing...on June 22nd, the same day when the war broke out between Germany and Russia,\nand we are in 1952 on June 22nd, we got married. At the time we didn't realize that it was\nthe same date. And we lived in Boston for a while.

        "Q: How do you summarize the effect of war on your life?",
        "A: Well, it's affected a lot, my life was affected from the Holocaust. It wasn't easy to bring\nup my daughter, my daughters. I was edgy. I was nervous. I didn't have the patience, the\npatience. Now I have more patience with my grandchildren than I had with my children.\nAnd it's not easy to adjust. But we had to do the best...we had to adjust. We had to make\nthe best of it and try to be live normal as other normal people.\nBLANK IN TAPE\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Could you tell us about how you and your sister helped each other ?",
        "A: Well, we supported each other morally and we supported each other physically too.\nWhen she was sick, I was helping her and when I was sick she was helping me to get\nbetter and we were trying to console each other, that someday maybe we will be lucky\nenough to survive and be together again. And while we were in Stuthof we met another\ngirl who was all alone. She came from the same city. She was a neighbor of ours and she\nlost all her family. She was all alone, and she asked us if she can be a sister, a third\nBlechman, and we told her yes. If two, might as well be three sisters, and we kept each\nother. We we kept all the time together, to be together all the time wherever we went, to\nto stick together and to survive together and we did. We we lived through the war\ntogether and we were in Poland. My sister wasn't with us but she and I, we used to meet\nin Poland. She got married in Poland and she moved to Israel and I went my way to the\nUnited States, but every once in a while I used to meet her but lately we didn't see each\nother for a long time. I don't know what happened to her. I don't know. My sister doesn't\nknow either what happened to her. She couldn't get in touch with her.",
        "Q: What was the reason you mention that it was eighteen years before you saw your sister\nagain. What was the reunion like?",
        "A: Well, we met in New York at the boat to and she came by boat with her two children and\nwe were standing and waiting. I was nervous and to meet my sister and see how, how it\nwill work out and I couldn't see her, because I couldn't...I I pictured her entirely different.\nAnd and then my cousin...she was with us...she came to the boat with us, and she saw her\nand she pointed out to her. It was very emotional to meet her and to get acquainted again.\nBut after all, after erghteen years, we'd changed. Both of us changed, and we lived we\nlived different lives altogether. But we got used to each other. She stayed with us for two\nmonths in Portland with the children. The children went to went to the center day camp.\nThey all adored her. The older daughter. The younger daughter was too little to go to\ncamp. She stayed at home with us. And we had a good time. It was good to spend with a\nsister again. And since then we meet, we meet each other every, practically every year we\nsee each other. We go to Israel every year to see our daughter with the grandchildren and\nnaturally we spend our time with my sister too, because they live not far from each other.",

        "A: My name is Rochelle Blackman Slivka. I was born in Vilno on April 18th in 1922.",
        "A: Well, my father worked in Vilno in the Jewish Kehilla in the social services department.\nMy mother was a housewife. We we were growing up, my sister and myself. We had nice\nhappy family. We went to a private elementary school and then we went to a Hebrew-\nspeaking high school. They didn't accept too many Jews, not at all any Jews to public\nhigh schools. They had to go to private schools, Yiddish-speaking, or Polish-speaking, or\nHebrew-speaking schools. My father was a Zionist. He sent us to a Hebrew-speaking\nhigh school. And life in Poland for us wasn't easy. We went to different schools from the\nnon-Jewish kids. Sometimes the non-Jewish children used to beat us up while we were\ngoing to school and we had to wear different uniforms. We were with different numbers\nthan the non-Jewish kids. But life was not bad except the anti-Semitism in Poland. We\nhad a normal life. Our family wasn't orthodox. We were more conservative and I'm sorry\n[Pause |",
        "A: We had a lot of friends. We socialized a lot with [friends]...we had; My parents had a lot\nof friends in the city and our social life was quite active in town, until the war broke out\nbetween, in 1939 between Germany and Poland. We we were at the time at our summer\nhome in outskirts of Vilno, but we heard that Germany attacked Poland in September Ist,\n1939. And we they bombed the cities, but we, with help with other relatives from other\nrelatives, we came back to the city and and a couple 01:04: of days later the Russians\ncame into our city. The war only lasted seventeen days between Poland and Germany\nbecause Poland wasn't prepared for the war at all and at the same time Germany and the\nSoviet Union decided to divide Poland in two halves. We were lucky enough to fall to the\nRussians, and when the Russians came in to our city, life stabilized a little. We went back\nto school for a while. People went back to work. My father still worked at the Vilno\nKehilla and life was going on pretty normal at this time. But it didn't last too long,\nbecause the Germans, the Russians decided to give Vilno back to the Lithuanians because\nthe Lithuanians always claimed that Vilno was the capital city of Lithuania and the Polish\ngovernment took [it] away from Lithuania in the Ist World War. And then they gave\nback Vilno to the Lithuanians and when the Lithuanians came in the first day there was a\npogrom on the Jews but after the pogrom, a couple of days later, 1t quieted down....",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: Yes they beat up quite quite a few Jews. They killed some some Jews and it was quite a\nscare. We didn't know what will happen to us, because we didn't know about Lithuania\ntoo much. We didn't know...even|though] I had an uncle in Lithuania but I still didn't\nknow what to expect from the Lithuanians. But after a while it quieted down and the city\ncame to normal again and we went back to work, our parents. My father went back to\nwork and we went back to school in Vilno to the Hebrew school and we learned a new\nlanguage. It wasn't easy but we had to learn. And life was going normal and I, we had an\nuncle in Lithuania because my mother came from Lithuania, Vilkaviskis in Lithuania and\nshe had a brother there and she hadn't seen him for over twenty years and for the first\ntime she met him. She saw him. And it was quite an excitement in the house to meet my\nuncle that we never knew and my cousins that we never knew and we didn't know what\nto think about them, didn't know what to expect from our uncle and aunt and cousins. But\nthey were very nice to us. They brought us a lot of food to eat, because we had a shortage\nin Vilno for a while, and then we went back to school learn, life was going on normally,\nbut after a while the Russians decided to take away all the Baltic lands to incorporate it to\nRussia. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and then the Russians came in again. Then it was a\nlittle bit different. We went back to school but we couldn't learn any more any Hebrew.\nWe didn't have any Hebrew schools anymore. We had to learn more Russian and nothing\nHebrew. Then the people went back to work again. My father worked still in the Kehilla,\nbut some other people they round[ed] up, a lot of Zionists, Zionist people and sent them\naway to Russia, to Siberia. They sent away a lot of Poles and a lot of Jews, rich Jews they\ntook away from the city and sent away. But it but 1t wasn't bad. The situation wasn't too\nbad. We weren't threatened with our lives. We had all the time we had not enough food\nbut we could survive because the Russians whatever they saw they used to take away\neverything from the stores. They never saw so much stuff in the stores. Whatever they\nsaw they grabbed it and they used to send away to Russia. And but we lived somehow\nand we were happy. We had our families and all our relatives. We had a lot of relatives in\nthe city of Vilno. My mother had a lot of cousins there. And we used to get together all\nthe time and naturally talk about old times but this lasted like that until June 22nd, 1941\nwhen Germany attacked Russia. And Vilno was, the city of Vilno was bombed. They\ndestroyed quite a bit of the city and a couple days later the Germans came in to our city\nand then our troubles started. (Pause) When the Germans came in it was still...we didn't\nknow what to expect. We didn't know even when people, refugees were coming in from\nfrom the other side, from the German occupied Poland, from Poland occupied by the\nGermans, they used to come in and they used to tell us stories how the Germans used to\ntake away Jews and they never came back and all kinds of stories about the German, SS\nGermany but we didn't believe them. We said it couldn't happen to us. They couldn't be\nso mean. It's such a civilized country. It couldn't be so bad. But after a while we did find\nout that it happen to us too, because when the Germans came in, in the beginning they\ndidn't know who 1s a Jew and who is not a Jew, and but our non-Jewish neighbors used to\npoint out the Jewish people. The kids with whom we used to play outside in the yard or\non the street, they used to point point out a Jew, because we lived altogether in the same\nsection and they used to take away the Jews. The SS with the help of the Ukrainian police\nor the Lithuanian police, they used to take away the Jews. Whenever we used to stand in\nline, they used to point out a Jew and they used to drag us out of the lines and every once\nin a while they used to come in to our houses and take away some people and...it was a\nvery scary time for us, especially for the young people, because we didn't know what\n[they would do]...we were afraid they'll come and take our parents away always, every\ntime we saw a German, and we had to walk around [them] [and] we had a curfew. Until\nfive o'clock in the evening we were allowed to walk and we weren't allowed to walk on\nthe sidewalk. We had to walk in the middle of the street and bow for every German. It it\nwas a very scary time. We didn't know who 1s going to be next and what's going to\nhappen to us and we we weren't allowed to go to school anymore and life was going on\nlike that until '41 right before the Jewish holidays. They...the SS decided to make a ghetto\nin our town, in Vilno and there a poor section where a lot of Jews used to live there and\nthe Jewish home for the aged was there. The biggest synagogue of the city of Vilno was\nthere. The orphanage. The Jewish hospital was there, and a lot of poor Jews lived around\nthis section and one night the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the\nLithuanians, they came in and took out all the Jews from there and they drove them to a\nplace, Ponary [in the] outskirts of Vilno there and they shot them all there. We heard\nscreaming and yelling and crying during the night, but we weren't allowed to look of the\nwindow because those who looked out were shot. We didn't know what was going on\nanyway until the next day our neighbors told us what was going on. We had a lot of\nrelatives there. My mother's cousins, all of my mother's relatives lived there and couple\nof weeks later they round up all the Jews from the city and the suburbs and they put us all\nin this ghetto, and surrounded us with walls and with guards and we had to live in one\napartment, two to three families in a two room apartment. When we came in those\napartments, we saw some of the beds were still made still where people were still asleep.\nThey were disturbed. They took them out in the middle of the night from the beds. Some\nthe tables were still set. People evidently were still eating, and this made a very bad\nimpression of us, for us because our relatives, our our families were taken away. They\nwere killed. We had the Judenrat, Kehilla changed the name to Judenrat and my father\nwas still working in the Judenrat there. We had our own police there. They organized\npolice, fire department. They had stores in the ghetto. We had even schools for children.\nThe little kids used to go to school. I personally was too old to go to school already.\nWhen the war started I was seventeen years old and we had to have a permit to live. At\nfirst they gave us yellow cards. Those who didn't get a yellow card were taken away from\nthe ghetto and we never saw those people. ( and a couple months..) We used to, people\nused to go out from the ghetto to work in factories or in railroad station, wherever they\nneeded some help, workers, they sent out our Jews there. And couple months later they\ndecided to change those cards again for different kind of cards. Pink cards, and then they\ntook away those that didn't have any pink cards and we never saw those people again.\nAnd it was pretty frightening all the time. Every time they used to give us a little more\nbread or horse meat we knew that's it's going to be a roundup of Jews the next couple\ndays. They even came in one day, the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the\nLithuanian police and took away all the children from school, and those little kids never\nhad a chance to say goodbye to their parents. The parents, when they came home from\nwork they didn't find their kids anymore. We we lived all the time in fright; we were\nfrightened all the time. We didn't know what was going to be next or who is going to be\nnext. One time they caught my father walking on a street. They round him [up] too, but\nhe escaped from there somehow. I don't remember how, but he did escape. My mother\nwas sick at the time in the ghetto and she died. She was in the hospital and we didn't have\nenough medication to help her, and she died in the ghetto. We weren't allowed to go to\nthe cemetery even to see where she was buried. My father went because he helped to dig\nthe grave in the cemetery and he knew exactly where, but the children weren't allowed to\ngo out of the ghetto. We lived in fear all the time. And every day was about the same\nthing as the previous day. We didn't know...then right before the holidays in 1943, right\nbefore the Jewish holidays, the New Year, the SS decided to liquidate the ghetto and they\ntold us over the loudspeaker that the ghetto is going to be liquidated and we are going to\nbe resettled. They didn't tell us where, and and we can take only what we can carry with\nus, no more. Naturally we didn't have much what to carry, only our clothes. That's all we\ncould take. And the next day we all congregated at the gate and they took us to a field in\nright outskirts of Vilno. I don't remember the name where it was, but when we came to\nthe field we saw three people hanging, a young woman, and two young men and they told\nus over the loudspeaker that in case somebody has in mind to run away, to escape from\nthis field, will be shot or hanged right in front of us. Men were taken away separately\nfrom the women. The men were taken to a concentration camp in Estonia and there they\nwere killed. They were all burned alive for...they put logs and people and logs and\nburned and brought gasoline in and burned them and couple a years ago when we were in\nIsrael, we went to visit the kibbutz Lokhamei haGettaoth and I saw the picture how they\nput up the people and I saw my father's name and his number and it was very emotional\nto see. Then how thorough the Germans were to record all what was happening to these\nJews and we had to stay the whole night in the field, the women. Only my sister and\nmyself. It was a very cold, miserable, rainy evening. When a child was crying or baby\nwas crying, our guards used to take away the child from the mother and take it for (by?)\ntheir feet and tear it in half and throw it back to the mother. Some mothers, from fright,\neven choked their own children. (Pause) It was going on like this the whole night. The\nnext morning, we stayed in line and we were sorted. Those who went left went to\nextermination camps like Majdanek or Treblinka or some other camps, and I was\nfortunate enough with my sister went to the right. I was lucky enough that they put\nus...they sorted us the same... they didn't separate us, and we went to the right. Then they\nput us in cattle cars, about a hundred women to a car, and no bathrooms, no food, no\nwater. We had to ride for a couple of days in the cattle cars until we came to Latvia, to\nKaiserwald. That's a suburb of Riga, and we were met by SS men and they told us that\nthis concentration camp is built on Jewish graves. All the Jews from Riga were\nconcentrated there. They were shot and they buried them and they built the concentration\ncamp there. We had to go through the showers. They shaved our heads in case somebody\nwill run away they should find [her], they should know that we are the Jews from the\nconcentration camp, recognize us. They gave us stripped clothes with numbers. From\nthen on we never were called by the name, only by the number. Then they put us in\nbarracks. We had to sleep on boards. No blankets, no pillows. We used to get up five\no'clock in the morning and be counted and sometimes our kapo made a mistake in\ncounting us, [then] we had to stay for another couple of hours and for punishment. Then\nthey used to give us a piece of bread and some black water that they called coffee and we\nused to go out to work from the concentration camp to dig ditches or at the railroad or in\nfactories. Some people were lucky enough worked in the concentration camp sorting the\nclothes that they took away from us and while I was working digging ditches, there was a\nguard who asked me from where I was and I told him that I was from Vilno. Then I asked\nhim where ...and he told me is from Lithuania. I said oh, I told him that my mother comes\nfrom Lithuania. He asked me from where, and I told him from where, from Vilkoviskis.\nHe says oh he comes from there too, and he knew my uncle. They were friends before the\nwar. They went to school together and they were very good friends, and he told me how\nmy uncle was killed in Vilkoviskis. They shot them all there. They didn't take them in\nany concentration camps or in any ghettos, nothing. They shot them all there. And then\nwe used to come back to the concentration camp and be counted again and then they took\nus and then they gave us some coffee and bread again and we used to retire to our\nbarracks. In the barracks we used to sit and talk, talk about old times, talk about our\nparents and the schools that we went to and every once in a while, couple times a week, a\nGerman SS woman used to come in with a big whip and beat us up without any reason.\nUsed to curse us. Used to yell at us. It was very frightening. We never knew what time it\nwas. We never knew what day it was, because we didn't have any clocks. We didn't have\nany watches. We didn't have any calendars. We didn't know anything what was going on\nin this world. Then one day, beginning of 1944 or so or in the middle, somewhere around\nthere, they told us that the next day they are going to take us to another concentration\ncamp and they took us again by cattle cars to a concentration camp in east Germany\nsomewhere, called Stuthof. When we came there they took away everything what we had\nagain and they shaved our heads again. They gave us different numbers, but it was much\nworse in this concentration camp. It was much bigger and we weren't allowed to go out\nfrom the camp. We had to stay in the camp all the time. We weren't allowed to go to the\nbathroom by ourselves. We had to have permission. If our kapo felt like taking us, it was\nalright. If not, it's too bad. We couldn't wash ourselves. We couldn't go to to clean up, to\nwash our hands or faces. We were filthy there. We were hungry. We looked like\nskeletons all the time. And I was sick with typhoid and my sister was sick with typhoid\nand we weren't allowed to go to see a doctor. But we had to nurse ourselves. We did...I\nhelped my sister. My sister helped me and women were dying there like flies. We were\ntreated very badly there. The German SS treated us very very bad there. Some women\ncouldn't take it any longer. They used to sneak out at night and go to the barbed wire and\ntouch the barbed wire and kill themselves. We used to get up early in the morning. We\nused to get our rations, bread and black coffee and once in a while they used to give us\nsoup. It was called soup. It was from rotten potato peels or rotten cabbage soup, and then\nat the evening again they used to get the same thing...bread and coffee, and whenever we\nall sat around there and talked all the time or we were quiet. We couldn't do anything. We\nwere so sick and we were so tired there. We were, we looked like skeletons. We were\ndirty. Our faces were black from dirt and in 1944, at the end, it was in December, end of\nDecember, right before Christmas, they decided to liquidate this concentration camp I\nguess and because the war was going on...getting bad and they told us and the next day\nthey took us out of the concentration camp, but this time we had to walk. We didn't have\nany warm clothes, only that what we had on ourselves and we didn't have any shoes. We\nhad to cover our feet with rags and when somebody, a woman died we used to take away\nher rags from her feet and cover our feet with with more rags to keep our feet warm. We\nused to take away her clothes to keep ourselves warm, to put on something else on us.\nWhile we were walking we saw some people lying on the ground, frozen, men frozen\ndead. We knew that a transport of Jews went by there. We used to start out about six\no'clock to walk, in the morning, six o'clock in the morning to walk with a piece of bread\nand the black coffee and walk the whole day until we find a place at night where to stay.\nThere was a barn somewhere, or a church...wherever they could find a place for us. Then\nthey used to give us again a piece of bread and coffee and we used to go to sleep. We\nwalked like that for six weeks. We weren't allowed to to bend over to take some snow to\nwet our lips. Those who did went over to take, they were shot by the guards. Those who\nhelped each other to walk were shot. We weren't allowed to do that either. We walked\nlike that for six weeks. Then we came to a barn and when we woke up the next day, we\ndidn't see our guards anymore. We saw some old German SS men. They took away the\nyoung ones because they needed them on the front, and they substituted with old SS men.\nThey were even worse than the young ones. They used to beat us up. Used to curse us.\nWe were so sick in this barn that we couldn't do anything. We were lying around all day\nlong in the barn. We didn't have bathroom facilities. We had to go right behind in back of\nthe barn. We used to get coffee in the morning with a piece of bread and sometimes\nnoontime they used to give us a little soup and then in the evening again the same bread\nand that was our food for the day. We were in this barn for a couple of months and\nwomen were dying all day, every single day. We started out with five thousand women.\nAbout two hundred and fifty survived. And one night, one day one SS man told us that\nthe next day we are going to be digging ditches for ourselves, because the war is going\nvery badly and they don't want us to fall in anybody's hands, and we're going to be shot\nand buried there, not to fall into anybody's hands. But the next day...during the night we\nheard some shelling and bombing and we didn't know what was going on, but when we\ngot up in the morning we didn't see any guards. We didn't see anybody. And we were\nafraid to go anywhere and we didn't have the strength to go anywhere. But a couple hours\nlater we saw a jeep full with soldiers came, Russian soldiers...and they told us that the\nwar was over right here in this part of Germany and we can go wherever we want to. We\ncouldn't go anywhere. We didn't have the strength and we were so filthy. We full of lice.\nOur bodies were beaten up. We were dirty. Lot of people have frozen hands and their feet\nwere frozen. Couple hours later a truck came and took us in to the village and we came in\nto the village. We didn't see any Germans there, because the people retreated with the\nGerman army and they let us loose and we started to grab food, whatever we could find.\nWe ate whatever we found, whatever we could. Some people overate too much. They\nthey didn't eat the right food. They didn't eat normally. They took sick and died. Some\nhad to have their feet amputated because they were so frozen they couldn't walk anymore\non them. We had to bathe ourselves in kerosene every day to get rid of the lice. Burn our\nclothes every day until we got rid rid of all the dirt and all the lice. We were in this\nvillage for a couple of months. Then after we started to feel better, my sister and myself\ndecided to go back to Vilno. We knew that our mother is dead and we heard in Struthof\nthat my father was killed in Estonia, but we still wanted to go back to our city because we\nleft a lot of household goods and some personal stuff with our non-Jewish neighbors, and\nwe thought maybe we can get back from them and sell it and use the money for clothes or\nother things. It wasn't easy to go back because we didn't have any transportation. We had\nto hitch hike by truck or by...they didn't have any cars at that time, or by train...whichever\nwe could. [It]took us a long time to get back and when we came to the border between\nPoland and the Soviet Union, we met some people coming out of the city and they told us\nnot to go back to Vilno because the situation is very bad there. There is not enough food\nand not enough work..not to go back to the city, but my sister decided she is going back\nto get some stuff back from our non-Jewish neighbors, but when she came to their houses\nto ask for our clothes and other stuff, nobody gave her back anything. They threw her out\nof their houses. I was in Byalistok, on the border between Poland and Russia, and I\nregistered in the Jewish community there and I put an ad in the Jewish paper here in the\nUnited States. I had a grandmother here, my mother's mother and four uncles, my\nmother's four brothers, and two sisters in this country. And but I didn't remember their\naddresses. I knew only my uncle's last name and my grandmother's last name I\nknew...and I put an ad and my grandmother used to read every day the Jewish paper and\nshe found my name and she contacted all my aunts and uncles that I am alive, and couple\nof months later I received a letter from a one of my uncles and he urged me to go back to\nthe American zone, to west Germany and from there he will try to bring me to the United\nStates. It wasn't easy to go back from one country to another country. I lived in Poland\nand I moved from Byalistok to Lodz and I lived there for a couple of months until I got\nacquainted with another organization, with other people, and I tried to cross the border\nwith them, with another kibbutz organization and from there I tried to to cross the border\nto Czechoslovakia, but it wasn't easy. The first time we were caught by the Polish guards\nand they sent us back, back to Poland. We couldn't cross. But after a couple of weeks\nlater we tried to cross again, and we succeeded. We crossed to Czechoslovakia. We\nstayed in Czechoslovakia a couple weeks and from there we crossed again to West\nGermany, through the Alps, but this time we had warm clothes. We had boots and we had\nenough food to eat. It wasn't so bad the walking and in 1946 I came to the West\nGermany, Munich, West Germany. And there I took sick and I was in a hospital in Sankt\nCecilien (?). That's not far from Munich that hospital there and at the same hospital one\nof my cousins was a doctor in this hospital, but he didn't know I was there and I didn't\nknow he was there and a couple months later I received another letter from another uncle\nfrom Dover, New Hampshire, that his son was in this camp as a doctor, but he left a day\nbefore I got the letter. I got the letter a day after he left and I couldn't get in touch with\nhim anymore. And then I got in touch with all my uncles and my aunts. They helped me a\nlot. When I got better I went back to school there. I learned a profession... I learned\nnursing. I went to nursing school and I learned to be a nurse. Then I moved to Landsburg\nand there I worked in a DP hospital, in a displaced person hospital. We lived in displaced\npersons camp, they were camps, but we lived...we had our own rooms and we had normal\nbeds and bedding. We lived like normal people, only in a camp. And we had enough food\nthere. We had enough clothing. We were supported by the UNRRA and by the Jewish, by\nJoint Distribution Committee here from the United States. My aunts and uncles, they\nused to send me help, bundles for help me out with clothes and other things. Then after a\nwhile I went back to Munich. I lived in Munich for a while. I worked there in the office\nand then my uncles started to work on for me to come to this country. It wasn't easy in\nthe beginning to come to this country. The State Department didn't open the gates yet to\ncome in to this country. They didn't let in anybody yet. And no country wanted us except\nPalestine at the time but Palestine...we couldn't because they were under the British rule\nand they didn't let in Jews to come in there and those who went illegally were caught and\nsent to Cypress to camps there. And I was sitting in Germany and waiting and in 1948,\nwhen Truman was President, they passed a law that all the DP people, displaced persons,\ncan come in, to to be admitted to this country, and my uncle from Brookline,\nMassachusetts, sent me a contract that I won't be a burden to the United States\nGovernment and he is taking full responsibility to help me and to support me, and then I\ngot a visa, permit to come to this country, and while I was sitting in, and while I was\nwaiting to be interviewed by the CIA...they interviewed me and everything went fine.\nThey told that in a couple of days to a week I'll be called to the immigration office and be\ngoing to the United States. I was waiting and waiting and waiting and nobody called me\nand nobody said anything. I went to find out what happened, and they looked [me] up. I\nwas crossed off the list that I am in the United States already. Somebody on my papers\nwent to the United States, but I showed them my identification card who I was. Then\nright away the same day I went through the doctors and all the preliminary things and in\ntwo days I had to get ready and go to Bremerhaven and from there I have to take a boat to\nthe United States and I came to Bremerhaven. I waited there. They they couldn't decide if\nI am a Polish citizen or a Lithuanian citizen, which papers which papers to send me...you\nare Polish citizen or a Lithuanian citizen. They they waited and they waited. They didn't\nknow what to do. Then I wrote to my uncle...I sent a telegram to my uncle that they don't\nlet me out from Germany because they don't know which papers to let me go and if I\ncan't come I'll go to Israel, because I can't wait any longer. Couple days later they called\nme from Joint Distribution that the next day I'm going to go to the United States. My\nuncle was very active in the Joint Distribution and they probably called the Consulate\nhere and they made up mind what to do with me and the next day I took the boat. One\nwent to Massachusetts, to Boston, and one went to New York, and I took the boat to\nMassachusetts, to Boston. While I was on the boat they asked me if I am going to\nMassachusetts. I says no, I am not going to Massachusetts. I am going to Boston, because\nI didn't know the difference between state or whatever it was...I didn't know...well,\nanyway I came on May 18th, 1949 I came to this country. And I was met at the boat. One\nof my uncles from Pittsfield from ...not from Pittsfield...from Dover, New Hampshire,\nmet me. He was at the boat and my aunt and my uncle from Boston, from Brookline, and\none aunt from Portland, Maine met me at the boat. I didn't know my relatives at all. I\ndidn't know what to expect. I didn't know what's what. But when I came to this country\nand I got off the boat, they all greeted me very nicely and they opened their homes for\nme. They were very very good to me. And then the same evening I met some other uncles\ncame to visit me (pause - crying\u2019?)...1t was very emotional, and my cousins were sitting in\nfront of the house and waiting for me to come. They were excited. (Crying?) And then\nmy life changed completely, for the best. After all we came to a normal country. We were\nthe not normal people. We didn't know what to expect and what without a language, not\nknowing anybody, and I had a wonderful welcome from my relatives, from all my\nrelatives, they welcomed me beautifully. All my aunts and uncles, they're very good. One\nuncle was dead already but his daughter was very nice to me. We were very good friends,\nand I took sick here. I was operated for a while...I was operated and after I got well, I\nwent back... went to work. I worked at the Beth Israel hospital, not as a nurse because I\ncouldn't... didn't know the language well and I didn't know too much about the nursing\nhere in the United States, and I worked as a nurses' aid in the Beth Israel Hospital for a\ncouple of years. When I...then I met my husband in 1951 and in 1952...it's a funny\nthing...on June 22nd, the same day when the war broke out between Germany and Russia,\nand we are in 1952 on June 22nd, we got married. At the time we didn't realize that it was\nthe same date. And we lived in Boston for a while. My husband graduated Bentley (7?)\nCollege and then we had a daughter who was, my older daughter, was born in\nMassach...1n Brookline, in Boston and in 1953 we moved to Portland, Maine. That's it.\nNow we live in Portland, Maine.",
        "A: Well, it's affected a lot, my life was affected from the Holocaust. It wasn't easy to bring\nup my daughter, my daughters. I was edgy. I was nervous. I didn't have the patience, the\npatience. Now I have more patience with my grandchildren than I had with my children.\nAnd it's not easy to adjust. But we had to do the best...we had to adjust. We had to make\nthe best of it and try to be live normal as other normal people.\nBLANK IN TAPE\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Well, we supported each other morally and we supported each other physically too.\nWhen she was sick, I was helping her and when I was sick she was helping me to get\nbetter and we were trying to console each other, that someday maybe we will be lucky\nenough to survive and be together again. And while we were in Stuthof we met another\ngirl who was all alone. She came from the same city. She was a neighbor of ours and she\nlost all her family. She was all alone, and she asked us if she can be a sister, a third\nBlechman, and we told her yes. If two, might as well be three sisters, and we kept each\nother. We we kept all the time together, to be together all the time wherever we went, to\nto stick together and to survive together and we did. We we lived through the war\ntogether and we were in Poland. My sister wasn't with us but she and I, we used to meet\nin Poland. She got married in Poland and she moved to Israel and I went my way to the\nUnited States, but every once in a while I used to meet her but lately we didn't see each\nother for a long time. I don't know what happened to her. I don't know. My sister doesn't\nknow either what happened to her. She couldn't get in touch with her.",
        "A: Well, we met in New York at the boat to and she came by boat with her two children and\nwe were standing and waiting. I was nervous and to meet my sister and see how, how it\nwill work out and I couldn't see her, because I couldn't...I I pictured her entirely different.\nAnd and then my cousin...she was with us...she came to the boat with us, and she saw her\nand she pointed out to her. It was very emotional to meet her and to get acquainted again.\nBut after all, after erghteen years, we'd changed. Both of us changed, and we lived we\nlived different lives altogether. But we got used to each other. She stayed with us for two\nmonths in Portland with the children. The children went to went to the center day camp.\nThey all adored her. The older daughter. The younger daughter was too little to go to\ncamp. She stayed at home with us. And we had a good time. It was good to spend with a\nsister again. And since then we meet, we meet each other every, practically every year we\nsee each other. We go to Israel every year to see our daughter with the grandchildren and\nnaturally we spend our time with my sister too, because they live not far from each other.",
