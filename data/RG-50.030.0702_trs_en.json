        "Q: Is it a village or a town?",
        "A: It was a resort town where all the royals of Austria and the Hauptburg Empire used to\ncome and spend their holidays. It's a really beautiful little town on the Adriatic, and it's\nsince become Croatia after World War II.",
        "Q: So it's right at that border?",
        "A: Right where Tito, you know, he appropriated that area, and nobody contested him\nbecause there was a Cold War and whatever, and it's now called Opatija.",

        "A: Opatija.",
        "Q: So Opatia in Croatian?",

        "A: Right, it was more like an international little village because a lot of languages were\nspoken there.",
        "Q: What do you remember from your childhood? What languages did you hear?",
        "A: Well, we had a governess, and she was Croatian, so my parents tell me that I learned\nCroatian, and my parents spoke German, so I spoke a little German and Italian.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home with your parents?",
        "A: We spoke a kind of a German. We didn't speak Yiddish then.",
        "Q: Oh, so you spoke German but not Yiddish?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you didn't speak Italian with one another?",
        "A: Yes, oh, yes, but not with my parents, with other children; and even though after 1938\nwhen the sanctions came into existence, Jewish children were not allowed to attend\nschool.",
        "Q: We'll get to that point.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Right now, so at home, you spoke German with your parents?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And Italian, Croatian?",
        "A: Well, with my governess, you know, but I forgot Croatian. I don't remember it, but\nthat's, you know, what my parents told me, but with all my neighbors and children, other\nchildren, I spoke Italian. We spoke Italian.",
        "Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?",

        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Beno Weiss.",
        "Q: Beno Weiss?",
        "A: He was a professor, full professor at Penn. State, a really wonderful human being, and\nhe would have been so proud to be here today, but he died unfortunately last year.",
        "Q: Well, my condolences for your loss.",
        "A: Thank you. And then after the war, my parents had two more children.",
        "Q: Oh?",
        "A: My sisters. So my brother and I, we were pre-war, and they were post-war.",
        "Q: And just for right now, give us the names of your sisters.",
        "A: My sister, the older one, they are a year apart, Ruth Weiss Schneider is her name\nnow, and Judy Weiss Gentile.",
        "Q: And what years were they born in?",
        "A: One, '45, and '46, right after the war.",
        "Q: So you're ten years apart, basically, ten, twelve years?",
        "A: No, a little more.",
        "Q: Yeah. So what were your parents' names?",
        "A: Rachel Weiss and Isaac Weiss, and in Italian, he was known as Isaco, and Rachele.",
        "Q: Let's pause just a little bit. We will let the train go by. So how is it that you spoke\nGerman with your parents at home? Were they native to Abbazia, the village? Is that how\nI say it?",
        "A: No, my parents were born in Poland.",
        "Q: Oh. What part of Poland?",
        "A: Galicia. And my mother was born in -- no, not Presburg. It will come to me in a\nsecond. Can we --",
        "Q: Yeah, we can stop. We can keep on going, and when it comes to you, just say.",
        "A: My father was born in Yashanitza {ph}.",
        "Q: Were these areas part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire?",
        "A: Yes, that's why they spoke German, and they -- I think they were forced to go to\nelementary school, and I think they probably learned German, but my dad ran away from\nhome when he was 16 because he didn't want to go into the Army. So he was like a real\ntraveler, and he lived in Vienna for five years before going up to Cannes, and then he\ntraveled down the coast and then ended up in Abbazia, and that's where he settled and\nmarried.",
        "Q: How did your mother end up here?",
        "A: Well, my father went to visit his parents, in Migrot, my mother comes from a town\ncalled Migrot {ph}. Her father was a shoykhet.",
        "Q: What's that?",
        "A: A kosher butcher. And he came to my father's town. You know, they needed, I\nguess, a Shoykhet, and when he was there, he met my mom, and then they were engaged\nfor five years, and then finally they got married.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And my mother came to Italy.",
        "Q: Did she like living there?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. The only thing she missed was her parents and her brothers and sisters. She\nhad a large family, but she adapted, you know, quite well, and she had a very good life\ntill things started going badly.",
        "Q: So talk to us a little bit about that life. What was your father's business? What did he\ndo?",
        "A: Well, he was a -- he imported materials.",
        "Q: Textiles?",
        "A: Textiles, for linens and for clothing, for men's suits, from England and\nCzechoslovakia, and apparently, you know, I think we lived very well till things started\ngoing wrong.",
        "Q: Tell me about your earliest memories.",
        "A: Going to the park with my mother. My father would go to the cafes every day after he\ndid his business, whatever. I remember this hotel called Principe Umberto where they had\ndances for children, and swimming, you know, on the beaches, and my brother and I\ngoing deep in the water, and my mother standing there and screaming, and we wouldn't\nlisten to her. And then poetic justice, my granddaughters did that to me when they were\nlittle. So my memories of my very early childhood were very good, except that I\ndeveloped polio when I was about five years old, and I had to spend quite a lot of time in\nthe hospital in Fiume. It was during the polio epidemic, but --",
        "Q: Do you remember that?",
        "A: Yeah, I remember that, the treatments, and being separated from my parents.",
        "Q: Well, you were a little girl, yeah, yeah. When you were little, did you hear anything\nabout politics? I mean you were a child, but --",
        "A: No, everyone was, you know, sort of enamored with Mussolini; you know, I mean all\nthe children wore their uniforms and marched, and I mean as a child, I didn't sense\nanything going wrong, but my parents, of course, must have kept a lot from us.",
        "Q: Did you already start school in the '30s?",
        "A: No, I never went to school. I never went to elementary school.",
        "Q: Okay. \u2014 So tell me a little bit about the larger political context for Italy and the\ntown, then how it affected your town, and then how it affected your lives. What was\ngoing on in the late '30s?",
        "A: Well, my father couldn't work anymore.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because of the sanctions that Germany imposed, and then Mussolini followed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So Jews were not allowed to work.",
        "Q: And this was from '38?",
        "A: I think it started in '38, and we weren't allowed to go to school. There were a lot of\nlimitations imposed on us, but nothing threatening physically. It was all economical; a lot\nof squeezes on my parents. Now, we lived in this house called Villa Jaime, and my\nmother used to go to a park, as I told you, all the time that had orchestras and famous\npeople coming, and so she would meet people from Austria, and so she connected with\nsomeone that wanted to get out of Vienna, and they lived with us for a whole year.",
        "Q: Do you remember them?",
        "A: Yeah, the name is Hellreich. As a matter of fact, he's a dermatologist in Manhattan\nnow, and my parents remained good friends with them throughout their lives, and so that\nsupplemented and helped pay for the rent. My mother had to give up, you know, some\nrooms for them, and somehow she sold possessions that she had, and somehow we got\nby. We even went back to Poland. My mother took my brother and I to Vienna and\nPresburg because she had family there.",
        "Q: Presburg, Bratislava, you mean?",
        "A: Maybe that was in '37. I'm not so sure when. It must have been before the sanctions.",
        "Q: So do you have vague memories of having been on this trip?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Very vague, though.",
        "Q: Okay. \u2014_ Does anything stand out?",
        "A: I remember the houses. Apparently, my father's father was the richest man in town.\nHe owned the bank. He owned the grocery store. He owned the only brick house in the\ntown, and, you know, and some of it was also like supplied by my mother who, you\nknow, said that everybody was so glad to see us, and so that was the last time my mother\nsaw her parents and sisters and brothers.",
        "Q: What happened to them?",
        "A: They were all killed. Every one of them.",
        "Q: Did she ever find out how and what the details were?",
        "A: Well, she found out that they all had to dig their own graves, and they were shot. And\nmy mother always felt so guilty because she had a single sister, Esther, and she wanted to\ncome to Italy so badly, but because my grandparents were heartbroken when my mother\nleft, she didn't want to do it to them again, so she did not encourage her coming because\nshe always said if she had only brought her to Italy, she would have been alive maybe.",
        "Q: That must have weighed heavily.",
        "A: And one brother ended up in Auschwitz, and he lived till the very end, and then he --\nI think some kind of accident in the camp killed him.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the Hellreich family. What -- they came from Vienna?",
        "A: From Vienna.",
        "Q: And why?",
        "A: They were waiting for their visa. They had family here. He had brothers who\nwere willing to sponsor him.",
        "Q: \"Here\" meaning the United States?",
        "A: The United States. And they just got out, and, you know, they lived with us for a\nyear, so they must have gone just before the war. Their visa came through.",
        "Q: And how many people were there?",
        "A: Four.",
        "Q: Four people in your house?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So a mother, a father?",
        "A: And two children.",
        "Q: Boys, girls?",
        "A: A boy and a girl.",
        "Q: A boy and a girl. And it's the boy who was the dermatologist?",
        "A: Yeah. And the sister, Edith, just died. She had Alzheimer's.",
        "Q: What is his name?",
        "A: Freddy, Alfred Hellreich.",
        "Q: Alfred Hellreich. Did they tell you stories, your family stories of what was going on in\nVienna?",
        "A: Well, they must have told my parents. I was a very young child, so these things did\nnot penetrate. I just knew subliminally, you know, that things were not going so well.\nAnd we didn't have that much cash. I remember taking a walk with my father, where\nbefore he would like lavish on us, and we wanted a banana, which was quite exotic back\nthen,and he took the last of whatever he had, and he bought it for us, and my brother and\nI shared it, so I knew that, you know -- and we had, after the Hellreichs left, we had to\nmove because we couldn't afford that big house anymore.",
        "Q: Did you own the house, or were you renting it?",
        "A: No, we rented it.",
        "Q: And you had a whole house before?",
        "A: Well, it was -- it was a whole floor.",
        "Q: In a house?",
        "A: In a house.",
        "Q: Do you have memories of what it looked like?",
        "A: Well, I went back about three years ago.",
        "Q: That would have been 2010?",
        "A: And I found it.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I didn't go inside, but I took pictures of the outside because I was born in that house, in\nVilla Jaime. Years ago, you know, you gave birth at home.",
        "Q: Yeah. How big was it? Did it have many rooms?",
        "A: Yeah, apparently it must have if my parents could give up a section.",
        "Q: Do you remember where you moved to?",
        "A: We moved to a much larger building, and we just I think rented. We had a room or\ntwo.",
        "Q: And how did life change by the time you moved? Was there more things going on?",
        "A: Well, in between I got the polio. I know that I had the polio in the other place,\nnot in Villa Jaime.",
        "Q: Okay. So there was a lot of stress in the family?",
        "A: Yeah. I mean my poor parents, I mean they were beside themselves. Things were\ngetting hard economically, and things didn't look good for the Jews, and here they had a\ndaughter that had polio, and they didn't know what my future would be, and so they went\nthrough a lot.",
        "Q: Were there many Jews in Abbazia?",
        "A: Abbazia?",
        "Q: Abbazia.",
        "A: I know it had a hotel that had kosher food, and they had a kosher butcher, but I really,\nyou know, couldn't tell you how many Jews lived in Abbazia, but Fiume had quite a lot\nof Jews.",
        "Q: So did your parents, when they socialized, who did they socialize with?",
        "A: Oh, they -- you know, my father socialized mainly in the hotel Principe Umberto, that\nhe would go to there and he would read the newspaper, he would play chess. And\nhe belonged to a synagogue, so he knew people from there. And they had friends in\nFiume, very good friends with whom they stayed when they would come and visit me\nbecause I was in the hospital there.",
        "Q: So did they have friends who were Italians or who were non-Jews?",
        "A: They probably did because they were very friendly, outgoing people, so but I, you\nknow, neighbors, and --",
        "Q: You wouldn't know them?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What about, did they ever speak Polish with one another?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Yiddish?",
        "A: They probably did speak Yiddish to one another, but we kids did not speak Yiddish.",
        "Q: Okay. Did they tell you much about their lives in Poland and what it was like when\nthey were growing --",
        "A: They might have, but I don't -- my father's tales I knew of because he went off so\nyoung, and I know he traveled all over Europe. He was in Hungary. He was in Austria.\nThen he ended up in France, and he ended up in Italy, so he really --",
        "Q: He saw the world?",
        "A: Yeah, he moved around.",
        "Q: How did things develop further as time went on, and how did it affect your family?",
        "A: Well, we lived like that till 1940, when Germany declared war, and Mussolini went\nalong with Hitler.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so one night we were all sleeping, the carabinieris came, and they just took my\nfather away, and I remember, you know, standing at the window screaming, \"Papa,\nPapa,\" and they took him to a prison in Fiume where they kept him for a while, and we\ndidn't know what was going to happen. They didn't take my mother and my brother. And\nthen eventually they sent him to a concentration camp in Fiera Monte. Have you heard of\nit?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: It's in Calabria. It was one of the camps that they had in Italy for Jews and other\npolitical prisoners, whatever, and then a few days later, they moved us, also, and they\nsent us to a very small town near Rome called Atessa.",
        "Q: Atessa?",
        "A: It has all kinds of ruins. It's historically very old with walls around the town, you\nknow, and they called that internment. We were interned.",
        "Q: What did it look like? What kind of places did they put you?",
        "A: It was a very small little village. We were not allowed to go to school. We\nwere not allowed to leave town. We had to be in after \"Ave Maria,\" you know, when\nthe bells ring in the evening. We had to report to the police station with our number to\nmake sure that we didn't escape. We weren't allowed to associate with the community,\nbut Italians, they didn't pay any attention, and we as kids had a lot of friends.",
        "Q: Were there more Jews who were brought to this place?",
        "A: There were other Jews and some people who maybe were alleged to be Communists\nor politically undesirable, and but Mussolini paid us a stipend, and so we were able to\nexist, and he did not go along with Hitler's extermination plan, you know. I mean he said\nthat he would take care of the Jews in Italy.",
        "Q: Do you think he did?",
        "A: Yes, he did in his way by isolating us. And then my mother wrote a letter petitioning,\nyou know, that we wanted to be reunited with my dad, and about a year later, he came to\nAtessa.",
        "Q: Okay. So he was in prison for how long; about a year and a half, two years?",
        "A: About a year, I would say. But it wasn't a torture camp. It wasn't an extermination\ncamp. It was more a containment camp.",
        "Q: Was it labor? Was it forced labor there?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: He just had to stay there?",
        "A: He just had to -- you know, they had no liberties to leave, but they weren't harmed.\nAnd so then my father joined us.",
        "Q: What did he look like? Had he changed in his manner?",
        "A: My dad, no, because he wasn't harmed in any way, except all his rights were taken\naway from him.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then we lived in this town, Tuscania, for several years.",
        "Q: Hang on a second. Before we come to that, you mentioned that all his rights\nwere taken away. Did you feel that? You were a child at the time, but did you feel what\nthat meant?",
        "A: Well, I knew that I couldn't go to school like other children did.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And my parents made every effort to get us tutors, you know, because there was some\nEnglish people that were also interned because they got caught up being in Italy, and so,\nyou know, my parents made every sacrifice to, you know, have us become literate, and\nwhich we did, but we never went to any formal school. And also they had to sacrifice\nand sell things in order to, you know, pay for tutors and our education.",
        "Q: So his business was simply confiscated way back in Abbazia?",
        "A: No, he was just stopped from operating it.",
        "Q: So it closed down?",
        "A: Yeah, he was prohibited. Jews were prohibited to, you know, to work, period.",
        "Q: By this point you're eight or nine years old when you were in this village; is that so?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. '32 -- yeah. I was eight.",
        "Q: Were you able to understand more of what was going on around you?",
        "A: Well, I knew that we had limitations and that we weren't from that place, and, you\nknow, you become very smart very quickly when you are under stress and your parents\nare being displaced, and but we made the best of it, you know. We kind of got by.\nAnd then they sent us, because we were so dangerous, they sent us to another town after\nabout two years, I think.",
        "Q: What was the official reason?",
        "A: Well, they never gave it to us, you know.",
        "Q: I see. Do they just come and announce it?",
        "A: They just said, you know, you have to now go to the Abbruzzi, which is like a\nmountainous region of Italy, and we went to a town called Atessa.",
        "Q: And what was that like?",
        "A: Well, you know, we found nice lodgings in this tiny little villa out of the way, small\nlittle rooms. I remember that. It had a garden outside. We started planting things. And\nsomehow, you know, we managed. But then in 1943, when Mussolini was executed\n-- | don't know if you know that story.",
        "Q: I thought he was executed at the end of the war.",
        "A: It was in '43, the end of '43.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: I think.",
        "Q: Okay. So when he was executed?",
        "A: Yeah, when he was killed and hung upside down over that bridge in Torino, then the\nGerman -- the Italian government became an ally of the Allied Forces.",
        "Q: Of the Allied Forces?",
        "A: Yes, the Italians, and so then the Germans felt free to invade Italy, and that's when\nthings really became bad for us.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: Well, then we had to hide and run because they were hunting Jews, and even though\nthe Italians, you know, were very good, they didn't turn you in because there was very\nlittle anti-Semitism in Italy. There weren't that many Jews to hate. And so then things\nbecame, you know, quite hectic for us. We had to run and hide, and then the bombing\nstarted, so we had to protect ourselves from that.",
        "Q: How did you -- excuse me. How did you hide? Would you leave?",
        "A: We would run, you know, when we would hear, somebody would tell us that the\nGermans were looking, we would run into the countryside and look for farmers, and I\nthink some of them my parents must have bribed, you know, and they let us sleep in their\nstalls and whatever.",
        "Q: And then you would return back to --",
        "A: Then when we heard that they left, and once they caught us, the Germans.",
        "Q: What happened? Tell me in detail.",
        "A: Well, we were very lucky that he was a humane German S.S. lieutenant, whatever.",
        "Q: Tell me the circumstances of how you were caught.",
        "A: Well, we were running, and, you know, they had dogs, and they had guns, and they\ncaught us. And my brother and I, we started crying, you know, \"Please don't take my\ndaddy,\" and \"please,\" you know, we cried, and somehow, you know -- oh, there was a\nGerman woman also interned because she was married to a Jew from Hamburg.",
        "Q: So they caught you and they took you to \u2014",
        "A: We were running, you know, with this other couple. They were staying in a\nneighboring farm, and so she started speaking to the -- she was a glamorous-looking\nblonde -- to this captain, lieutenant, whatever he was, and somehow by a miracle of\nmiracles, they let us go back, you know, to hiding, whatever.",
        "Q: In other words, they never brought you to a prison? You were caught on the road?",
        "A: Yeah, we were caught running in a countryside.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And the funny thing is that my mother tells me that he told us we can go back home.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that the next day, he came with some provisions.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. So I guess there were some humane, you know, Germans, also.",
        "Q: Was he alone when you were caught, or were there lots of soldiers?",
        "A: No, he had a lot of soldiers, but he was in command, so, you know, I don't know what\nhe told them.",
        "Q: Because that's unusual. That would sound unusual.",
        "A: I know. We always talk about how lucky we were that --",
        "Q: And she said something in German to him, do you think\u2019?",
        "A: Well, my parents spoke German, too, you know, so they spoke to him, and he had pity\non us, and he just let us all go.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But frightening for children.",
        "A: Oh, I never forgot that, how it was, you know, muddy, and how we lost our shoes\nrunning, and also the Germans had set mines all over the place, so it was very dangerous\nwhere you were going because one day while we were running, one of the people running\nin back of us just got killed from a mine.",
        "Q: Stepped on it and blown to bits?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Also very terrifying for a child; I mean terrifying for anybody.",
        "A: For anybody.",
        "Q: Anybody, but a child at age ten, eleven, and your brother even younger; do you think\nthat that affected you?",
        "A: Well, you know, always people tell me that I'm emotionally, you know, a strong\nperson. It kind of hardens you in a way. In a way, we were like wise beyond our years\nbecause my parents would tell us to go and listen to what some of the Germans were\nsaying, you know, because --",
        "Q: You could speak German?",
        "A: Because we understood what they were saying, so I know we did that when we were\nquite young.",
        "Q: Were there Germans in those villages before Mussolini died?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So Germans only appeared in your lives --",
        "A: Appeared after, after.",
        "Q: His murder?",
        "A: He didn't let them interfere.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I mean one thing about him, he didn't let the Jews be sent to concentration camps, and\nhe protected his Jews as long as he was alive. I mean even though we lost all our\nfreedoms and everything, but that was a compromise, I guess, that we had to live by and\nin a way be grateful because we are here, and, you know, we did survive, and then there\nwas a whole conflict in that area.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Because the Germans were there, and the Allies were coming in, and there was like \u2014",
        "Q: So there were battles?",
        "A: Oh, terrible battles. We saw people getting killed right out near, looking out the\nwindow. There was actual war right where we were.",
        "Q: But give me the name again.",
        "A: Atessa.",
        "Q: Atessa. And again, war comes upon you, and you're children?",
        "A: Yes. Well, they mined everything. They destroyed all the bridges, you know, so that\nthe Allies couldn't come in easily. And at this point I developed a very high fever,\ntemperature, while we were running. And we were staying in this farm house, so they had\na hospital there, so my parents took me to the hospital, and they let us stay in the hospital,\nand they had cannons on top of the hospital, even though they had a big Red Cross on top\nof it, and we could hear the bombs coming and going, you know.",
        "Q: So this was the Italians who had those cannons, or whose cannons?",
        "A: No, the Germans.",
        "Q: And you were in a hospital where there were German cannons?",
        "A: Underneath. And, you know, they gave us shelter, and at that point they weren't\nlooking for us because they were just fighting and retreating.",
        "Q: So my question is this. Two questions. Did you ever feel under -- insecure around\nItalians that you might be betrayed?",
        "A: No, no, never. They were very brave, or maybe they didn't understand the\nconsequences of their deeds. I don't know which it was. But wherever we went,\nsomebody, you know, would give us succor, you know, would give us protection.",
        "Q: And did you look -- I mean, again, would it be easy to recognize you?",
        "A: No, because, you know, we were running, and my parents negotiated, and we just hid\nin this stall. Every now and then they were kind enough and invite us to a meal, but, you\nknow, most of the time, we just subsisted on whatever we could find. So, you\nknow, my brother and I said, you know, maybe if we knew who they were, we might go\nlooking for them, you know, but it was so transient because we didn't stay in any place\nfor that long because it was dangerous.",
        "Q: Were you limited by a certain area, though, I mean that you moved from place to\nplace, but never very far from where you were before?",
        "A: Well, we stayed in the countryside because we thought we were safer there, and also\nmaybe safer from the bombing and from all the --",
        "Q: Where were some of the larger towns so that I'd get a geographical sense?",
        "A: Atessa. I really don't know, you know. It's in the Abbruzzi.",
        "Q: And while you were in the hospital, and there were the cannons up top, what\nhappened? Did they fire from there?",
        "A: They fired from right up our roofs, and they would fire back, and that whole part of\nthat hospital was demolished.",
        "Q: So it was not safe at all?",
        "A: It wasn't safe. So then we ran. Someone told us to run to this hotel in town, and\npractically the whole building fell on us, but, you know, we went to a basement,\nwhatever, and, you know, we survived.",
        "Q: You hid in the basement?",
        "A: We were just lucky.",
        "Q: How long did this go on for?",
        "A: Seemed like forever, but I guess it wasn't that long, but then, you know, the Allies\ncame in, and they liberated us.",
        "Q: Do you remember what they looked like when you saw them?",
        "A: They were British. They were British troops that liberated that part of Italy, mostly\nIndians.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: Yeah. The Indians, you know, fought for the British, and they found us a place to\nstay, an apartment that, you know, if it was empty, they just took it temporarily, and one\nof the Indian officers lived with us, and then all of a sudden things started looking up\nbecause we had food, and we had protection, and we --",
        "Q: And this was 1944?",
        "A: The end of '44.",
        "Q: Okay. So --",
        "A: And then in -- and then we went -- we stayed there for a few months, and then we\nwere sent to a DP camp.",
        "Q: And where was the DP camp?",
        "A: The first one was Palazze, which is near Naples, but they were old Army barracks.\nThey were not equipped for winter living. So it was really pretty there because it was\nnear the Mediterranean, and we had a very nice summer, and then when fall came, they\nsent us to Barletta.",
        "Q: Where is that?",
        "A: No, well, first when we were liberated -- I'm sorry -- we went to Palazze. Then\nthey sent us to Santa Maria de Bagno, it was called, in the Apulia section. And then\nthey had confiscated all these villas of rich Italians who were, you know, using them for\nthe summer, and they put all the displaced people in these villas.",
        "Q: Were there many displaced people?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Then all the people started coming from Poland, from Auschwitz, and that's\nwhen I learned Yiddish.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So is that also when you learned, your parents learned, at least, what had happened in\nPoland?",
        "A: No, they had heard rumors.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: While the war was still going on.",
        "Q: That must have been so heartbreaking.",
        "A: Somebody came to our house one day, I remember that, and told my mother, and then\nshe was hysterical, crying, and somehow, you know, we found out what it was all about,\nthat she was told that her whole family was, you know, was killed.",
        "Q: Which house would this have been? Where would this have been?",
        "A: That was before, that was before the Mussolini.",
        "Q: Was murdered?",
        "A: Was murdered.",
        "Q: So that would have been when you were in one of the villages?",
        "A: Yes, we were in Tuscania.",
        "Q: You were in Tuscania.",
        "A:So rumors, you know, traveled. People got mail or whatever. I don't know how\nthis man found out. And as a matter of fact, when my sisters were born after the war, and\nthen in the Jewish religion, you are not allowed to name after the living, so my parents\nnamed -- they gave them both Biblical names because they weren't absolutely sure who\nhad survived and who didn't because this was all hearsay.",
        "Q: Well, tell me this, something I meant to ask and forgot momentarily. Were your\nparents very religious?",
        "A: Well, they were -- came from a very religious background, but when we lived in Italy,\nmy dad tried to maintain all the Jewish traditions, you know, Passover, and mainly I\nremember Passover, where he made his own matzo because we couldn't get that, but\nthere was no such thing as having kosher food or, you know, anything like that, but we\nmaintained, you know, at home. So then we were in the DP camps, several different DP\ncamps. Let me see. One, two -- about four of them for five years.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Well, because you needed -- you know, to have a visa to come here.",
        "Q: So you didn't want to stay in Italy, your parents?",
        "A: Well, we couldn't go back to Abbazia because it wasn't Italy anymore. It was\nCommunist Tito.",
        "Q: And your father didn't --",
        "A: And we didn't want to go back to more oppressions, and we didn't know -- things were\nnot the same.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So my parents debated whether to go to Israel or -- and then he opted, he said, you\nknow, after what we went through, he wanted us to come to a safe place.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: So we waited.",
        "Q: So you were in these various DP camps for five years?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you go to school?",
        "A: Well, after the war.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We took -- my parents hired again tutors to prepare us to pass an entrance exam,\nbecause in Italy, you know, you have to pass entrance exams, each level of schooling that\nyou go through, and we made it, and then we started middle school, and then from then\non we went to Genoseo {ph}, and then {undecipherable} for one year, so I had -- which\nis like almost a year of college.",
        "Q: When you were in the DP camps, did it feel like internment, or did it feel like just\ntemporary housing?",
        "A: Yeah, temporary housing, in barracks. We had one room for six people.",
        "Q: Who was there?",
        "A: Communal. My two sisters.",
        "Q: Oh, they were born.",
        "A: My brother and my parents. And we had communal showers and bathrooms, and very\nprimitive. They had mess hall, you know, for people. We were fed that way. And the\nschool was very far away, so in one town, my father hired a man with a donkey, and he\nwould pick us up every morning and take us to school --",
        "Q: A chauffeur.",
        "A: -- you know, and then pick us up because he started working, and they had like a K.P.\nthing in the camp itself, and he was running it.",
        "Q: Well, that's what my next question is. How did your father earn any money that he\nwould be able to --",
        "A: Well, they gave us, you know, provisions, cans of food, and we had lodging, and then\nwhen he started, you know, working in this K.P., he started earning some money, and\nthey, my parents, sacrificed a lot for our education, hiring math professors, because, you\nknow, we really didn't know anything about math, and but somehow we did well even\nwithout --",
        "Q: Formal schooling?",
        "A: -- without having any elementary education.",
        "Q: That's pretty amazing.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That's pretty amazing. Were they \u2014 had their personalities been affected?",
        "A: My parents?",
        "Q: Yeah, by everything that they had gone through.",
        "A: Yeah, my dad was, you know, quite nervous. I'm sure it affected them deeply, but they\ndidn't really -- you know, my father was a very positive-thinking man. He was\nalways grateful, you know, that we survived and that we were healthy and that, you\nknow, things, when we came here, even though they struggled, you know, my dad could\nnever earn much money, and he had to go and learn how to be an operator.",
        "Q: What kind?",
        "A: Clothing, you know, sewing, because he couldn't find -- he didn't speak the language.\nHe spoke a little English.",
        "Q: So was he a tailor here?",
        "A: Not a real tailor. I think they did piecework, whatever.",
        "Q: That's tough.",
        "A: It was very tough for them, yeah.",
        "Q: Did both of them do this?",
        "A: Well, then my mother, because she had twolittle children --",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: -- and so she couldn't really go to work. And then we came here to join finally an\nuncle in Hoboken. My father promised him that he would never ask him for anything if\nhe --",
        "Q: Sponsored you?",
        "A: -- if he brought us over here, and we never did. And we came in 1950 to the\nUnited States. And we stayed for seven weeks in a hotel. The Joint {ph} put us up there,\nand then we went to the {undecipherable}, which is where the\nShakespeare Theater is now.",
        "Q: I don't know where that is in New York.",
        "A: It's on Broadway.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: In the village.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: And then they found us an apartment in the Bronx, a five-floor walk-up.",
        "Q: And how big was it?",
        "A: It had enough rooms, but the Bronx was turning, and it wasn't such a safe place\nanymore. So my parents sent my sisters to a Yeshiva, a Hebrew school, and my brother\nand I, he was 16 and I was 18, so we went to work, and so we managed.",
        "Q: That's tough.",
        "A: Yeah, it was very tough.",
        "Q: All that displacement.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: All that displacement. So actually you kind of lost home?",
        "A: Many times.",
        "Q: Many times. Did you ever have a feeling of home\u2019?",
        "A: Well, home was where my parents were, you know, and we had a very strong family\nbond. So because of my parents, somehow, you know, knowing that we were together\nand we were with them, that gave you a sense of safety, but we were always, you know --\neverything was unpredictable. We never knew what would be tomorrow.",
        "Q: But the one thing that was stable was the family?",
        "A: Was the family.",
        "Q: That's pretty big.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, family is very important.",
        "Q: How did your life progress here in the states?",
        "A: Well, I married in 1952.",
        "Q: So pretty soon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And first I went to work in a factory. Then I progressed to a clerical job. And then\nwhen my daughter was born quite soon after, and so I had three children.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I stayed home.",
        "Q: When were your children born?",
        "A: Well, Debbie was born in '53, and then a son was born in '57.",
        "Q: What's his name?",
        "A: Steven. And he died two years ago, yeah.",
        "Q: My condolences.",
        "A: And I have another son, Richard, who is going to be 50. He's not 50 yet.",
        "Q: So he was born in the '60s?",
        "A: Yeah. And as soon as they were a little older, I went to college.",
        "Q: Oh, what college did you go to?",
        "A: Brooklyn College.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I did well in school, and then I got a master's in school psychology.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about that.",
        "A: Yeah, and I worked for 27 years as a school psychologist, and I am now retired.",
        "Q: Well, tell me, why did -- how -- or how was psychology something that drew you?",
        "A: Oh, I don't know. When I graduated college, I started teaching, and I thought that\nthat's what I really wanted to do, to teach, but New York City at that time, you know, it\nwas not ideal to teach, especially not middle school. I made a mistake. If I had gone into\nelementary school, probably it would have been better for me because in my nature, it\nwasn't in me to be a police person.",
        "Q: And middle school you kind of have to?",
        "A: Thirty percent of the time having to discipline kids.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So I realized very quickly that that wasn't what I wanted to be, and so I said I'll try and\nfind something within the school system that gets me out of the classroom, and so -- and I\nmade the right choice because that was, you know, the right decision for me.",
        "Q: Did psychology intrigue you?",
        "A: I don't know if it was so much that I was intrigued. I just knew that it would be a good\njob for me.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because I like people, and I'm very, you know, sympathetic to other people's plights,\nso and it worked out well.",
        "Q: What is it that your parents -- in the things that we inherit, we can inherit things, but\nwe can also inherit things that are not tangible. What are the intangibles that your parents\nkind of bequeathed to you?",
        "A: My parents, you know, I have four siblings, and we all, despite everything that we\nwent through, we all turned out to be resilient, and humanitarian, and upstanding citizens\nwith very good moral values, you know, so whatever my parents did, they did something\nthat just worked, you know, and we all turned out to be pretty successful in our own\npursuits. Everyone in my family is a professional, you know, and so my parents made the\nright choice coming to this country.",
        "Q: Tell me how their lives progressed after they came here.",
        "A: Well, when the Bronx turned so badly, my brother helped them buy a house in\nBrighton.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He put down the down payment, whatever.",
        "Q: Brighton Beach?",
        "A: Yes. Brighton, First Street. It was a two-family house because they had two, you\nknow, they had two young children, and they didn't want to have to deal with the changes\nthat were happening, and they were very happy with this little house. You know, they\nrented the upstairs, and even though my father didn't make very much, but with the rent,\nand they lived frugally, and they didn't have any excesses, you know, they somehow\nmanaged to have a very nice life here.",
        "Q: Were they happy people?",
        "A: Yeah, my dad was a very happy person. He was very gregarious. He liked to tell\njokes. He loved people. He became very religious, though, and he went to a synagogue\nregularly. And he died in 1978.",
        "Q: And your mom?",
        "A: My mom died in 1986. She was 93.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did they ever talk to your children about\u2014",
        "A: No, not really. My kids interviewed her, you know, for school, different things like\nthat, but nothing, nothing formal.",
        "Q: And did you, amongst yourselves, the \u2014 all the children and your parents, without your\nchildren involved, did you talk about these things?",
        "A: Yeah, my brother and I did, and especially we went back together a few years ago, ten\nyears ago. We spent a month in Florence. We had an apartment, and we rented a car, and\nwe went back to both Tuscania and Atessa. And it's really strange, you know, that\nwhat you remember and what is is not always the same.",
        "Q: So how did that show up?",
        "A: We went there. We found the places that we lived in. We remembered it, you know,\nbetween the two of us, we located the places, and, you know, where I had remembered a\nhuge park, it was a tiny little nothing. The villa that we lived in in Atessa, you know,\nwas --",
        "Q: Not so big?",
        "A: Well, it wasn't big. I don't remember it being big, but we scouted around, and we\nwent to places that we remembered. So that was very nice. Now no one knew,\nremembered anything.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. Do you think there were any -- it's so transient, so it's almost like in\nthe areas where you were during those years, there were probably no footprints left of\nwhat happened, or are there?",
        "A: Well, I'm sure that some people do know, but maybe, you know, because we were just\nthere for two days, we couldn't really do any investigative reporting, you know, and see,\nbut we went by where we had to go and give our number every day, and we went to, you\nknow, different sites that we remember, so we did do that.",
        "Q: I remember we were looking at a photograph of maybe it was the same trip or another\ntrip when you were there with your daughter?",
        "A: No, no, that was -- you know, that's the -- that's a different part of Italy.",
        "Q: That's where you were originally from, right?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Where your daughter and --",
        "A: No, that's Apulia {ph}. That's not --",
        "Q: Did you ever go back to Abbazia?",
        "A: Yes, I went back a few years ago, and that was also a big, you know, blow to my\nmemory, but I did find Villa Jaime where I was born, and I did find the park, and the\nplaces we went swimming, and Principe Umberto, which I remember as being this huge\nhotel was broken up into different parts. But the general atmosphere, the palm trees, and\nthe beauty of the little place, you know, remains.",
        "Q: Doesn't mean your memory was wrong; it just means life changed?",
        "A: Yeah, it just was distorted, and even though it's Croatia, you know, people still speak\nItalian there. Many stores still have Italian headings, and so the -- you know, the\nCroatian government now is making it -- you know, is resuscitating the allure of the\nplace.",
        "Q: Did your grandchildren express interest in what had gone on with you?",
        "A: Not that much really. You know, they ask questions every now and then, but they\nnever, you know, never explored. But my brother has some tapes, but, you know, he is\nnot here anymore, and he lives in Pennsylvania.",
        "Q: He lived in Pennsylvania?",
        "A: He interviewed my mom before she died.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, I think. I don't know if \u2014 what happened to the tapes.",
        "Q: Because those could be very interesting to have at the museum.",
        "A: Yeah, I don't know. I'll have to ask my sister-in-law if she has them, or if she\nknows where they are.",
        "Q: That could be quite -- that would be very, very important, you know. We would value\nthat.",
        "A: I don't know what, you know, the interview is all about, but when I speak to her next, I\nwill ask her if she remembers.",
        "Q: And for yourself, those formative years, when -- when you had such an insecure life\nand sometimes a life that could have been easily taken away, how do you think that that's\n-- what does it play -- when you think of your life in total, how big is that portion of it?",
        "A: Well, it's at the core of me, you know. I think it made me who I am. It made me\nstrong and flexible, and it's something I'll never forget. It's a history that, you know, that\nwill be with me forever, even though it's kind of not always there, you know, on the\noutside.",

        "A: No, I mean they know bits and pieces, you know, but it's not something that my\nparents dwelled on, and I think that that's some kind of a pattern of people who have gone\nthrough a lot, that they don't really talk about it.",

        "A: But I do want to say that of all the people in Europe, the Italians were probably the\nmost noble and life savers than any other nation. The people, not so much the institutions,\nlike the church, but the people. They did not turn anybody in. Maybe there were a few\ncases that I don't know of that I'm sure, but they were the most civil of, you know, of all\nthe people.",

        "A: Textiles, for linens and for clothing, for men's suits, from England and\nCzechoslovakia, and apparently, you know, I think we lived very well till things started\ngoing wrong.",
        "A: Going to the park with my mother. My father would go to the cafes every day after he\ndid his business, whatever. I remember this hotel called Principe Umberto where they had\ndances for children, and swimming, you know, on the beaches, and my brother and I\ngoing deep in the water, and my mother standing there and screaming, and we wouldn't\nlisten to her. And then poetic justice, my granddaughters did that to me when they were\nlittle. So my memories of my very early childhood were very good, except that I\ndeveloped polio when I was about five years old, and I had to spend quite a lot of time in\nthe hospital in Fiume. It was during the polio epidemic, but --",
        "A: Yeah, I remember that, the treatments, and being separated from my parents.",
        "A: No, everyone was, you know, sort of enamored with Mussolini; you know, I mean all\nthe children wore their uniforms and marched, and I mean as a child, I didn't sense\nanything going wrong, but my parents, of course, must have kept a lot from us.",
        "A: No, I never went to school. I never went to elementary school.",
        "A: Well, my father couldn't work anymore.",
        "A: Because of the sanctions that Germany imposed, and then Mussolini followed.",
        "A: So Jews were not allowed to work.",
        "A: I think it started in '38, and we weren't allowed to go to school. There were a lot of\nlimitations imposed on us, but nothing threatening physically. It was all economical; a lot\nof squeezes on my parents. Now, we lived in this house called Villa Jaime, and my\nmother used to go to a park, as I told you, all the time that had orchestras and famous\npeople coming, and so she would meet people from Austria, and so she connected with\nsomeone that wanted to get out of Vienna, and they lived with us for a whole year.",
        "A: Yeah, the name is Hellreich. As a matter of fact, he's a dermatologist in Manhattan\nnow, and my parents remained good friends with them throughout their lives, and so that\nsupplemented and helped pay for the rent. My mother had to give up, you know, some\nrooms for them, and somehow she sold possessions that she had, and somehow we got\nby. We even went back to Poland. My mother took my brother and I to Vienna and\nPresburg because she had family there.",
        "A: Maybe that was in '37. I'm not so sure when. It must have been before the sanctions.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Very vague, though.",
        "A: I remember the houses. Apparently, my father's father was the richest man in town.\nHe owned the bank. He owned the grocery store. He owned the only brick house in the\ntown, and, you know, and some of it was also like supplied by my mother who, you\nknow, said that everybody was so glad to see us, and so that was the last time my mother\nsaw her parents and sisters and brothers.",
        "A: They were all killed. Every one of them.",
        "A: Well, she found out that they all had to dig their own graves, and they were shot. And\nmy mother always felt so guilty because she had a single sister, Esther, and she wanted to\ncome to Italy so badly, but because my grandparents were heartbroken when my mother\nleft, she didn't want to do it to them again, so she did not encourage her coming because\nshe always said if she had only brought her to Italy, she would have been alive maybe.",
        "A: And one brother ended up in Auschwitz, and he lived till the very end, and then he --\nI think some kind of accident in the camp killed him.",
        "A: From Vienna.",
        "A: They were waiting for their visa. They had family here. He had brothers who\nwere willing to sponsor him.",
        "A: The United States. And they just got out, and, you know, they lived with us for a\nyear, so they must have gone just before the war. Their visa came through.",
        "A: Four.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And two children.",
        "A: A boy and a girl.",
        "A: Yeah. And the sister, Edith, just died. She had Alzheimer's.",
        "A: Freddy, Alfred Hellreich.",
        "A: Well, they must have told my parents. I was a very young child, so these things did\nnot penetrate. I just knew subliminally, you know, that things were not going so well.\nAnd we didn't have that much cash. I remember taking a walk with my father, where\nbefore he would like lavish on us, and we wanted a banana, which was quite exotic back\nthen,and he took the last of whatever he had, and he bought it for us, and my brother and\nI shared it, so I knew that, you know -- and we had, after the Hellreichs left, we had to\nmove because we couldn't afford that big house anymore.",
        "A: No, we rented it.",
        "A: Well, it was -- it was a whole floor.",
        "A: In a house.",
        "A: Well, I went back about three years ago.",
        "A: And I found it.",
        "A: I didn't go inside, but I took pictures of the outside because I was born in that house, in\nVilla Jaime. Years ago, you know, you gave birth at home.",
        "A: Yeah, apparently it must have if my parents could give up a section.",
        "A: We moved to a much larger building, and we just I think rented. We had a room or\ntwo.",
        "A: Well, in between I got the polio. I know that I had the polio in the other place,\nnot in Villa Jaime.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean my poor parents, I mean they were beside themselves. Things were\ngetting hard economically, and things didn't look good for the Jews, and here they had a\ndaughter that had polio, and they didn't know what my future would be, and so they went\nthrough a lot.",
        "A: Abbazia?",
        "A: I know it had a hotel that had kosher food, and they had a kosher butcher, but I really,\nyou know, couldn't tell you how many Jews lived in Abbazia, but Fiume had quite a lot\nof Jews.",
        "A: Oh, they -- you know, my father socialized mainly in the hotel Principe Umberto, that\nhe would go to there and he would read the newspaper, he would play chess. And\nhe belonged to a synagogue, so he knew people from there. And they had friends in\nFiume, very good friends with whom they stayed when they would come and visit me\nbecause I was in the hospital there.",
        "A: They probably did because they were very friendly, outgoing people, so but I, you\nknow, neighbors, and --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They probably did speak Yiddish to one another, but we kids did not speak Yiddish.",
        "A: They might have, but I don't -- my father's tales I knew of because he went off so\nyoung, and I know he traveled all over Europe. He was in Hungary. He was in Austria.\nThen he ended up in France, and he ended up in Italy, so he really --",
        "A: Yeah, he moved around.",
        "A: Well, we lived like that till 1940, when Germany declared war, and Mussolini went\nalong with Hitler.",
        "A: And so one night we were all sleeping, the carabinieris came, and they just took my\nfather away, and I remember, you know, standing at the window screaming, \"Papa,\nPapa,\" and they took him to a prison in Fiume where they kept him for a while, and we\ndidn't know what was going to happen. They didn't take my mother and my brother. And\nthen eventually they sent him to a concentration camp in Fiera Monte. Have you heard of\nit?",
        "A: It's in Calabria. It was one of the camps that they had in Italy for Jews and other\npolitical prisoners, whatever, and then a few days later, they moved us, also, and they\nsent us to a very small town near Rome called Atessa.",
        "A: It has all kinds of ruins. It's historically very old with walls around the town, you\nknow, and they called that internment. We were interned.",
        "A: It was a very small little village. We were not allowed to go to school. We\nwere not allowed to leave town. We had to be in after \"Ave Maria,\" you know, when\nthe bells ring in the evening. We had to report to the police station with our number to\nmake sure that we didn't escape. We weren't allowed to associate with the community,\nbut Italians, they didn't pay any attention, and we as kids had a lot of friends.",
        "A: There were other Jews and some people who maybe were alleged to be Communists\nor politically undesirable, and but Mussolini paid us a stipend, and so we were able to\nexist, and he did not go along with Hitler's extermination plan, you know. I mean he said\nthat he would take care of the Jews in Italy.",
        "A: Yes, he did in his way by isolating us. And then my mother wrote a letter petitioning,\nyou know, that we wanted to be reunited with my dad, and about a year later, he came to\nAtessa.",
        "A: About a year, I would say. But it wasn't a torture camp. It wasn't an extermination\ncamp. It was more a containment camp.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: He just had to -- you know, they had no liberties to leave, but they weren't harmed.\nAnd so then my father joined us.",
        "A: My dad, no, because he wasn't harmed in any way, except all his rights were taken\naway from him.",
        "A: And then we lived in this town, Tuscania, for several years.",
        "A: Well, I knew that I couldn't go to school like other children did.",
        "A: And my parents made every effort to get us tutors, you know, because there was some\nEnglish people that were also interned because they got caught up being in Italy, and so,\nyou know, my parents made every sacrifice to, you know, have us become literate, and\nwhich we did, but we never went to any formal school. And also they had to sacrifice\nand sell things in order to, you know, pay for tutors and our education.",
        "A: No, he was just stopped from operating it.",
        "A: Yeah, he was prohibited. Jews were prohibited to, you know, to work, period.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. '32 -- yeah. I was eight.",
        "A: Well, I knew that we had limitations and that we weren't from that place, and, you\nknow, you become very smart very quickly when you are under stress and your parents\nare being displaced, and but we made the best of it, you know. We kind of got by.\nAnd then they sent us, because we were so dangerous, they sent us to another town after\nabout two years, I think.",
        "A: Well, they never gave it to us, you know.",
        "A: They just said, you know, you have to now go to the Abbruzzi, which is like a\nmountainous region of Italy, and we went to a town called Atessa.",
        "A: Well, you know, we found nice lodgings in this tiny little villa out of the way, small\nlittle rooms. I remember that. It had a garden outside. We started planting things. And\nsomehow, you know, we managed. But then in 1943, when Mussolini was executed\n-- | don't know if you know that story.",
        "A: It was in '43, the end of '43.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think.",
        "A: Yeah, when he was killed and hung upside down over that bridge in Torino, then the\nGerman -- the Italian government became an ally of the Allied Forces.",
        "A: Yes, the Italians, and so then the Germans felt free to invade Italy, and that's when\nthings really became bad for us.",
        "A: Well, then we had to hide and run because they were hunting Jews, and even though\nthe Italians, you know, were very good, they didn't turn you in because there was very\nlittle anti-Semitism in Italy. There weren't that many Jews to hate. And so then things\nbecame, you know, quite hectic for us. We had to run and hide, and then the bombing\nstarted, so we had to protect ourselves from that.",
        "A: We would run, you know, when we would hear, somebody would tell us that the\nGermans were looking, we would run into the countryside and look for farmers, and I\nthink some of them my parents must have bribed, you know, and they let us sleep in their\nstalls and whatever.",
        "A: Then when we heard that they left, and once they caught us, the Germans.",
        "A: Well, we were very lucky that he was a humane German S.S. lieutenant, whatever.",
        "A: Well, we were running, and, you know, they had dogs, and they had guns, and they\ncaught us. And my brother and I, we started crying, you know, \"Please don't take my\ndaddy,\" and \"please,\" you know, we cried, and somehow, you know -- oh, there was a\nGerman woman also interned because she was married to a Jew from Hamburg.",
        "A: We were running, you know, with this other couple. They were staying in a\nneighboring farm, and so she started speaking to the -- she was a glamorous-looking\nblonde -- to this captain, lieutenant, whatever he was, and somehow by a miracle of\nmiracles, they let us go back, you know, to hiding, whatever.",
        "A: Yeah, we were caught running in a countryside.",
        "A: And the funny thing is that my mother tells me that he told us we can go back home.",
        "A: And that the next day, he came with some provisions.",
        "A: Yes. So I guess there were some humane, you know, Germans, also.",
        "A: No, he had a lot of soldiers, but he was in command, so, you know, I don't know what\nhe told them.",
        "A: I know. We always talk about how lucky we were that --",
        "A: Well, my parents spoke German, too, you know, so they spoke to him, and he had pity\non us, and he just let us all go.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, I never forgot that, how it was, you know, muddy, and how we lost our shoes\nrunning, and also the Germans had set mines all over the place, so it was very dangerous\nwhere you were going because one day while we were running, one of the people running\nin back of us just got killed from a mine.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: For anybody.",
        "A: Well, you know, always people tell me that I'm emotionally, you know, a strong\nperson. It kind of hardens you in a way. In a way, we were like wise beyond our years\nbecause my parents would tell us to go and listen to what some of the Germans were\nsaying, you know, because --",
        "A: Because we understood what they were saying, so I know we did that when we were\nquite young.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Appeared after, after.",
        "A: He didn't let them interfere.",
        "A: I mean one thing about him, he didn't let the Jews be sent to concentration camps, and\nhe protected his Jews as long as he was alive. I mean even though we lost all our\nfreedoms and everything, but that was a compromise, I guess, that we had to live by and\nin a way be grateful because we are here, and, you know, we did survive, and then there\nwas a whole conflict in that area.",
        "A: Because the Germans were there, and the Allies were coming in, and there was like \u2014",
        "A: Oh, terrible battles. We saw people getting killed right out near, looking out the\nwindow. There was actual war right where we were.",
        "A: Atessa.",
        "A: Yes. Well, they mined everything. They destroyed all the bridges, you know, so that\nthe Allies couldn't come in easily. And at this point I developed a very high fever,\ntemperature, while we were running. And we were staying in this farm house, so they had\na hospital there, so my parents took me to the hospital, and they let us stay in the hospital,\nand they had cannons on top of the hospital, even though they had a big Red Cross on top\nof it, and we could hear the bombs coming and going, you know.",
        "A: No, the Germans.",
        "A: Underneath. And, you know, they gave us shelter, and at that point they weren't\nlooking for us because they were just fighting and retreating.",
        "A: No, no, never. They were very brave, or maybe they didn't understand the\nconsequences of their deeds. I don't know which it was. But wherever we went,\nsomebody, you know, would give us succor, you know, would give us protection.",
        "A: No, because, you know, we were running, and my parents negotiated, and we just hid\nin this stall. Every now and then they were kind enough and invite us to a meal, but, you\nknow, most of the time, we just subsisted on whatever we could find. So, you\nknow, my brother and I said, you know, maybe if we knew who they were, we might go\nlooking for them, you know, but it was so transient because we didn't stay in any place\nfor that long because it was dangerous.",
        "A: Well, we stayed in the countryside because we thought we were safer there, and also\nmaybe safer from the bombing and from all the --",
        "A: Atessa. I really don't know, you know. It's in the Abbruzzi.",
        "A: They fired from right up our roofs, and they would fire back, and that whole part of\nthat hospital was demolished.",
        "A: It wasn't safe. So then we ran. Someone told us to run to this hotel in town, and\npractically the whole building fell on us, but, you know, we went to a basement,\nwhatever, and, you know, we survived.",
        "A: We were just lucky.",
        "A: Seemed like forever, but I guess it wasn't that long, but then, you know, the Allies\ncame in, and they liberated us.",
        "A: They were British. They were British troops that liberated that part of Italy, mostly\nIndians.",
        "A: Yeah. The Indians, you know, fought for the British, and they found us a place to\nstay, an apartment that, you know, if it was empty, they just took it temporarily, and one\nof the Indian officers lived with us, and then all of a sudden things started looking up\nbecause we had food, and we had protection, and we --",
        "A: The end of '44.",
        "A: And then in -- and then we went -- we stayed there for a few months, and then we\nwere sent to a DP camp.",
        "A: The first one was Palazze, which is near Naples, but they were old Army barracks.\nThey were not equipped for winter living. So it was really pretty there because it was\nnear the Mediterranean, and we had a very nice summer, and then when fall came, they\nsent us to Barletta.",
        "A: No, well, first when we were liberated -- I'm sorry -- we went to Palazze. Then\nthey sent us to Santa Maria de Bagno, it was called, in the Apulia section. And then\nthey had confiscated all these villas of rich Italians who were, you know, using them for\nthe summer, and they put all the displaced people in these villas.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Then all the people started coming from Poland, from Auschwitz, and that's\nwhen I learned Yiddish.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, they had heard rumors.",
        "A: While the war was still going on.",
        "A: Somebody came to our house one day, I remember that, and told my mother, and then\nshe was hysterical, crying, and somehow, you know, we found out what it was all about,\nthat she was told that her whole family was, you know, was killed.",
        "A: That was before, that was before the Mussolini.",
        "A: Was murdered.",
        "A: Yes, we were in Tuscania.",
        "A:So rumors, you know, traveled. People got mail or whatever. I don't know how\nthis man found out. And as a matter of fact, when my sisters were born after the war, and\nthen in the Jewish religion, you are not allowed to name after the living, so my parents\nnamed -- they gave them both Biblical names because they weren't absolutely sure who\nhad survived and who didn't because this was all hearsay.",
        "A: Well, they were -- came from a very religious background, but when we lived in Italy,\nmy dad tried to maintain all the Jewish traditions, you know, Passover, and mainly I\nremember Passover, where he made his own matzo because we couldn't get that, but\nthere was no such thing as having kosher food or, you know, anything like that, but we\nmaintained, you know, at home. So then we were in the DP camps, several different DP\ncamps. Let me see. One, two -- about four of them for five years.",
        "A: Well, because you needed -- you know, to have a visa to come here.",
        "A: Well, we couldn't go back to Abbazia because it wasn't Italy anymore. It was\nCommunist Tito.",
        "A: And we didn't want to go back to more oppressions, and we didn't know -- things were\nnot the same.",
        "A: So my parents debated whether to go to Israel or -- and then he opted, he said, you\nknow, after what we went through, he wanted us to come to a safe place.",
        "A: So we waited.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, after the war.",
        "A: We took -- my parents hired again tutors to prepare us to pass an entrance exam,\nbecause in Italy, you know, you have to pass entrance exams, each level of schooling that\nyou go through, and we made it, and then we started middle school, and then from then\non we went to Genoseo {ph}, and then {undecipherable} for one year, so I had -- which\nis like almost a year of college.",
        "A: Yeah, temporary housing, in barracks. We had one room for six people.",
        "A: Communal. My two sisters.",
        "A: My brother and my parents. And we had communal showers and bathrooms, and very\nprimitive. They had mess hall, you know, for people. We were fed that way. And the\nschool was very far away, so in one town, my father hired a man with a donkey, and he\nwould pick us up every morning and take us to school --",
        "A: -- you know, and then pick us up because he started working, and they had like a K.P.\nthing in the camp itself, and he was running it.",
        "A: Well, they gave us, you know, provisions, cans of food, and we had lodging, and then\nwhen he started, you know, working in this K.P., he started earning some money, and\nthey, my parents, sacrificed a lot for our education, hiring math professors, because, you\nknow, we really didn't know anything about math, and but somehow we did well even\nwithout --",
        "A: -- without having any elementary education.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: My parents?",
        "A: Yeah, my dad was, you know, quite nervous. I'm sure it affected them deeply, but they\ndidn't really -- you know, my father was a very positive-thinking man. He was\nalways grateful, you know, that we survived and that we were healthy and that, you\nknow, things, when we came here, even though they struggled, you know, my dad could\nnever earn much money, and he had to go and learn how to be an operator.",
        "A: Clothing, you know, sewing, because he couldn't find -- he didn't speak the language.\nHe spoke a little English.",
        "A: Not a real tailor. I think they did piecework, whatever.",
        "A: It was very tough for them, yeah.",
        "A: Well, then my mother, because she had twolittle children --",
        "A: -- and so she couldn't really go to work. And then we came here to join finally an\nuncle in Hoboken. My father promised him that he would never ask him for anything if\nhe --",
        "A: -- if he brought us over here, and we never did. And we came in 1950 to the\nUnited States. And we stayed for seven weeks in a hotel. The Joint {ph} put us up there,\nand then we went to the {undecipherable}, which is where the\nShakespeare Theater is now.",
        "A: It's on Broadway.",
        "A: In the village.",
        "A: And then they found us an apartment in the Bronx, a five-floor walk-up.",
        "A: It had enough rooms, but the Bronx was turning, and it wasn't such a safe place\nanymore. So my parents sent my sisters to a Yeshiva, a Hebrew school, and my brother\nand I, he was 16 and I was 18, so we went to work, and so we managed.",
        "A: Yeah, it was very tough.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Many times.",
        "A: Well, home was where my parents were, you know, and we had a very strong family\nbond. So because of my parents, somehow, you know, knowing that we were together\nand we were with them, that gave you a sense of safety, but we were always, you know --\neverything was unpredictable. We never knew what would be tomorrow.",
        "A: Was the family.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, family is very important.",
        "A: Well, I married in 1952.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And first I went to work in a factory. Then I progressed to a clerical job. And then\nwhen my daughter was born quite soon after, and so I had three children.",
        "A: And I stayed home.",
        "A: Well, Debbie was born in '53, and then a son was born in '57.",
        "A: Steven. And he died two years ago, yeah.",
        "A: And I have another son, Richard, who is going to be 50. He's not 50 yet.",
        "A: Yeah. And as soon as they were a little older, I went to college.",
        "A: Brooklyn College.",
        "A: And I did well in school, and then I got a master's in school psychology.",
        "A: Yeah, and I worked for 27 years as a school psychologist, and I am now retired.",
        "A: Oh, I don't know. When I graduated college, I started teaching, and I thought that\nthat's what I really wanted to do, to teach, but New York City at that time, you know, it\nwas not ideal to teach, especially not middle school. I made a mistake. If I had gone into\nelementary school, probably it would have been better for me because in my nature, it\nwasn't in me to be a police person.",
        "A: Thirty percent of the time having to discipline kids.",
        "A: So I realized very quickly that that wasn't what I wanted to be, and so I said I'll try and\nfind something within the school system that gets me out of the classroom, and so -- and I\nmade the right choice because that was, you know, the right decision for me.",
        "A: I don't know if it was so much that I was intrigued. I just knew that it would be a good\njob for me.",
        "A: Because I like people, and I'm very, you know, sympathetic to other people's plights,\nso and it worked out well.",
        "A: My parents, you know, I have four siblings, and we all, despite everything that we\nwent through, we all turned out to be resilient, and humanitarian, and upstanding citizens\nwith very good moral values, you know, so whatever my parents did, they did something\nthat just worked, you know, and we all turned out to be pretty successful in our own\npursuits. Everyone in my family is a professional, you know, and so my parents made the\nright choice coming to this country.",
        "A: Well, when the Bronx turned so badly, my brother helped them buy a house in\nBrighton.",
        "A: He put down the down payment, whatever.",
        "A: Yes. Brighton, First Street. It was a two-family house because they had two, you\nknow, they had two young children, and they didn't want to have to deal with the changes\nthat were happening, and they were very happy with this little house. You know, they\nrented the upstairs, and even though my father didn't make very much, but with the rent,\nand they lived frugally, and they didn't have any excesses, you know, they somehow\nmanaged to have a very nice life here.",
        "A: Yeah, my dad was a very happy person. He was very gregarious. He liked to tell\njokes. He loved people. He became very religious, though, and he went to a synagogue\nregularly. And he died in 1978.",
        "A: My mom died in 1986. She was 93.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, not really. My kids interviewed her, you know, for school, different things like\nthat, but nothing, nothing formal.",
        "A: Yeah, my brother and I did, and especially we went back together a few years ago, ten\nyears ago. We spent a month in Florence. We had an apartment, and we rented a car, and\nwe went back to both Tuscania and Atessa. And it's really strange, you know, that\nwhat you remember and what is is not always the same.",
        "A: We went there. We found the places that we lived in. We remembered it, you know,\nbetween the two of us, we located the places, and, you know, where I had remembered a\nhuge park, it was a tiny little nothing. The villa that we lived in in Atessa, you know,\nwas --",
        "A: Well, it wasn't big. I don't remember it being big, but we scouted around, and we\nwent to places that we remembered. So that was very nice. Now no one knew,\nremembered anything.",
        "A: Well, I'm sure that some people do know, but maybe, you know, because we were just\nthere for two days, we couldn't really do any investigative reporting, you know, and see,\nbut we went by where we had to go and give our number every day, and we went to, you\nknow, different sites that we remember, so we did do that.",
        "A: No, no, that was -- you know, that's the -- that's a different part of Italy.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, that's Apulia {ph}. That's not --",
        "A: Yes, I went back a few years ago, and that was also a big, you know, blow to my\nmemory, but I did find Villa Jaime where I was born, and I did find the park, and the\nplaces we went swimming, and Principe Umberto, which I remember as being this huge\nhotel was broken up into different parts. But the general atmosphere, the palm trees, and\nthe beauty of the little place, you know, remains.",
        "A: Yeah, it just was distorted, and even though it's Croatia, you know, people still speak\nItalian there. Many stores still have Italian headings, and so the -- you know, the\nCroatian government now is making it -- you know, is resuscitating the allure of the\nplace.",
        "A: Not that much really. You know, they ask questions every now and then, but they\nnever, you know, never explored. But my brother has some tapes, but, you know, he is\nnot here anymore, and he lives in Pennsylvania.",
        "A: He interviewed my mom before she died.",
        "A: Yeah, I think. I don't know if \u2014 what happened to the tapes.",
        "A: Yeah, I don't know. I'll have to ask my sister-in-law if she has them, or if she\nknows where they are.",
        "A: I don't know what, you know, the interview is all about, but when I speak to her next, I\nwill ask her if she remembers.",
        "A: Well, it's at the core of me, you know. I think it made me who I am. It made me\nstrong and flexible, and it's something I'll never forget. It's a history that, you know, that\nwill be with me forever, even though it's kind of not always there, you know, on the\noutside.",
        "A: No, I mean they know bits and pieces, you know, but it's not something that my\nparents dwelled on, and I think that that's some kind of a pattern of people who have gone\nthrough a lot, that they don't really talk about it.",
        "A: Well, you know, I mean once I realized the importance of it, you know, but it's not\nsomething that is spontaneous.",
        "A: Well, you know, I had asked my daughter, because she has all the names of the people\nthat -- my uncles and aunts that, that didn't survive, and so many cousins, and that, you\nknow, that I think my brother, when he went to Yad Vashem in Israel, I think inscribed\ntheir names. I'm not so positive. But she was at work when I called her this morning, and\nshe didn't have it with her.",
        "A: Yes, I would like to add them to, you know, the victims' list if they are not there yet,\nyou know. I don't know if the museum has them or not.",
        "A: But I do want to say that of all the people in Europe, the Italians were probably the\nmost noble and life savers than any other nation. The people, not so much the institutions,\nlike the church, but the people. They did not turn anybody in. Maybe there were a few\ncases that I don't know of that I'm sure, but they were the most civil of, you know, of all\nthe people.",
        "A: Turned them in.",
        "A: Not the Italians.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I used to somehow wonder, you know, why so many innocent people had to die\nfor what, you know, but I still have faith, and as the Italians, you know, proved, there 1s,\nyou know, hope for humanity yet.",
        "A: I think I've said what I had to say.",
        "A: Okay. So what happens? Am I being taped now.",
        "A: You're welcome.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
