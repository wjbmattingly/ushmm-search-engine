        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nJudge Guido Calabresi, on July 27\", 2017, in New Haven, Connecticut. Thank\nyou very, very much Judge Calabresi, for agreeing to meet with us today, and to\nshare your story, and to let us have a little window into the experiences that you\nand your family had during those terrible and turbulent years of World War II, and\npre-World War II. PIl start with the most basic questions, and the very first one is,\ncan you tell me the date of your birth?",
        "Answer: I was born in October 18, 1932.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Milan. I was born in an apartment my parents \u2014 my father had just\ngone there to teach. We soon after moved to a house with my family owned in\nMilan, on Via Canova. And such is the world \u2014 Via Canova is in the center, near\nthe castle and so on \u2014 such 1s the world that now that house, which was our house,\nis the Turkish consulate.",
        "Q: No kidding. Well that \u2014 that leads me to a question that usually would be way\ntowards the end of the interview, but I'll ask 1t now so I don\u2019t forget. If 1t was your\nhouse, and you left it, was it that it was confiscated from you, or you so \u2014 your\nfamily sold it?July 27, 2017",
        "A: No, no, we sold it after the war, it was damaged, we sold it for almost nothing. It\nwas damaged because some bombs had hit nearby. How we managed, somehow, to\nkeep properties is \u2014 is part of the story \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 that is \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay. And then another question that seems self-evident, but it\u2019s part of\nour format is, can you tell me, what was your name at birth?",
        "A: My name was Guido Calabresi, no \u2014",
        "Q: As it is today.",
        "A: As it is today.",
        "Q: Okay, no changes.",
        "A: No changes.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about both your mother and your father, starting with their\nnames.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Bianca Maria Finzi-Contini, and married to\nCalabresi. She was born actually in Milan, because her father, who was a \u2014 an\nearly neurologist, he studied with Charcot, the teacher of Freud. About the same\ntime, he decided that much of it was bunk, he inherited some money, and kept up.\nHe said, someday it will all be fine. That\u2019s kind of nice, because his great-July 27, 2017\ngrandchildren, one my gran \u2014 my daughter, is a psychiatrist. My brother\u2019s son is a\nneurologist professor at Johns Hopkins. So it\u2019s come round.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But he was in Milan at the time. But they were from Bologna.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And Finzi-Contini originally all came from Ferrara, but the family had\ntransferred to Bologna quite early and \u2014 and was a family that was responsible for\nmuch of the urban development of Bologna. They owned a good deal of the center\nof Bologna.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: The kind of key figure in all this was a man named Leon Vita Finzi-Contini,\nwho was born in 1776, and who \u2014 whose grave is in the Jewish cemetery in\nBologna. He had many children by his first wife, who went in all different\ndirections. Some are very actively practicing Jews in Israel. One is a\u2014 was a\nrelative in some other way, is a good friend, is a professor of economics in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nTurin. And some married Catholic nobles, and became immensely rich. One of the\ngreat art collections in Italy is the Contini Bonacossi Collection in Florence, and\nthey are all descendants. They didn\u2019t always behave well, so it \u2014 the family, they \u2014\nI mean \u2014\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "Q: In what way\u2019?",
        "A: They \u2014 they had dealings with the \u2014 with the Nazis, and so on, and so the family\nsort of ignored them. But that was \u2014 he then married a second wife, and we descend\nfrom his second wife, and \u2014 and \u2014 but part of that 1s the reason why the name\nFinzi-Contini is one that gets used.",
        "Q: Well, that was \u2014 I mean, of course, that\u2019s one of the questions that I was going\nto ask later, but I\u2019ll ask it now, is \u2014 1s of course the movie, that was ever \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, so very popular, \u201cThe Garden of the Finzi-Continis.\u201d",
        "A: So let me first say something about my father.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well, one other thing about my mother\u2019s family. Her mother is of a family that\nclaims to have been brought by Titus in his triumph, in 70 Common Era. Caesar\nRoff(ph) says it\u2019s so. The Jewish Encyclopedia of 1900 says it\u2019s so. There were \u2014\nwhen the Romans conquered a place, they tended to bring princes, kings and so on\nin their trials. When the conquered Palestine, they brought judges, priests and\nelders. We were the elders. Zekanym(ph).",
        "Q: PIl tell you, I have \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to interrupt. I have never met somebody who\ncould trace his family back \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 more than 200 years.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Never mind 2,000.",
        "A: Well, so they came as, in the tribe \u2014 I\u2014 I must say, I haven\u2019t seen anybody \u2014 I\nwent to the Arch of Titus, nobody looks like my great-uncle, carrying the menorah,\nbut there it is. Anyway, they came as \u2014 as slaves, originally, became tutors to the\nemperors. Followed the emperors to Ravenna when the western empire went there,\nand when the empire fell, around 500, moved nearby, to a town of Lugo, where\nthey set up shop as bankers, moneylenders, and as rabbis of the Italian rite. Because\nwe are Italkim; we are not Sephardic, we are not Ashkenazim, we are people who\nwere there before the diaspora, and in Italy, and in Israel \u2014 there\u2019s a synagogue in\nIsrael which is the Italian one. Obvious rite. And that was what our tradition was\non both sides. And so these people, who had all sorts of ups and downs, ultimately\nlent enough money to the pope so that he gave them permission to practice their\ntrade in Bologna. And I think the popes meant by trade, banking, money-lending.\nThese people said, but we are teachers of law, because they were rabbis of the\nItalian rite. And so, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but somehow \u2014 but the \u2014 the legend 1s\nthat the way we got into law teaching was because of this. Anyway, so \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "Q: How did you learn of this?",
        "A: Oh, this is all family tales and stories that ha \u2014 have been, and I just enjoy them.\nWell, anyway, that line is one which was very self-important, for obvious reasons.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And my grandmother married my grandfather, this \u2014 of this very good family,\nwith high intellectual traditions, and so on, and going back hundreds of years in\nitself, in Ferrara. But that gave that name a certain connotation, of elegance, or\nsomething. My \u2014 I said to my mother \u2014 my mother said aristocracy, I said\ndecadence, she said it\u2019s the same thing, Guido. And there it is. Okay. Now.",
        "Q: A child would say that to his mother.",
        "A: Let me then take my father\u2019s family, and \u2014 because that deals with this book.\nMy father\u2019s family, the Calabresi, were, according to their tradition, which isn\u2019t as\nproven as the other, were traders in Rome in Republican time. That is even earlier.\nNow, it is a fact that the largest number of people in Rome who were not Romans,\nat the time of the Roman Republic, before Julius Caesar, before the empire and so\non, were Jews, who were traders. There were about 15 \u2014 2500. Different figures,\nbut a significant number of people who were Jews trading. And the story, in that\nside of the family is that they stayed there, and when \u2014 and settled somewhere\nsouth of Rome, where we don\u2019t know. In 1496, everything from Rome south was\nJuly 27, 2017\nSpanish territory, and Jews were expelled in 1492 from Spain, 1496 from Spanish\nterritory, Portugal and Spanish territory. Two people went from somewhere south\nof Rome, to Ferrara. And there is a document which says two people came from\nLe Calabria. Today Calabria is just the toe. But in Ferrara, at the time, they\ncalled everything from Rome south, Le Calabria. And said where two people\ncame, bought lands \u2014 because Ferrara was very open to Jews. I\u2019ll show you some\npictures [indecipherable]. And because they came from Le Calabria and there\nwere two of them, we called them Calabrese, which means people from Calabria.\nCalabrese with an e, meaning person, is quite a common name in the south.\nCalabresi with an iis unusual. It isn\u2019t always just descendants of these two, but a\nlot are descendants of these two, and with an i, it often is Jewish. With and e \u2014 not\nalways, but often is \u2014 with an e, almost never.",
        "Q: Never.",
        "A: We \u2014 the other line had many children, and so on. We were down to none, until\nmy father was born. He was the only male of his generation. So my grandfather\ntried to see if these two were related. Then my father was born, and he lost interest.\nAnyway, they came to Ferrara, joined the Italian synagogue. There were in\nFerrara a German, a Spanish, and an Italian, and they joined the Italian. But it\nwasn\u2019t because they were angry with the Spanish. If you look at the ruins of theJuly 27, 2017\nSpanish synagogue, you see signs of donations by Calabresi because they treated\nus so well, when we were in their territory. So it \u2014 they were Italkim, who had to be\nSephardic when this was Spanish territory, got to Ferrara, found an Italian\nsynagogue and joined up in it, which gives some evidence that maybe the story that\nthey went back, is true. They married into another very, very old and very wealthy\nfamily of Ferrara, Minerbi, who are also \u2014 again, the family is all over. One of\nthem, Sergio Minerbi is in Israel and was the ambassador of Israel to the unite \u2014\nto Europe, and \u2014 and at one point to the Vatican, which he didn\u2019t much like. But he\n\u2014 anyway, this family is a major, major family, and had \u2014 and members of the\nfamily still do \u2014 had houses \u2014 and I\u2019Il show you on the map of Ferrara afterwards,\nwhere \u2014 which go back to the 13\" century. My father\u2019s first cousin and best friend,\nwas the patron of Bassani, the man who wrote the book from which the movie was\ntaken. He helped him financially, and Bassani wrote the book, that book and\nothers. He dedicated one to my cousin, but he wrote that book and others in that\nfamily house, in the library of that house. And he \u2014",
        "Q: Minerbi? In the Minerbi family house?",
        "A: In the Minerbi family house. And he told my father\u2019s cousin in the courtyards\nof this house, I\u2019m writing a book, and I\u2019m going to call it, \u201cThe Garden of the\nFinzi-Contini.\u201d Why did he pick my mother\u2019s name \u2014\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u20141n my father\u2019s family\u2019s house? Nobody knows this, but I do.",
        "Q: Tell me.",
        "A: And the story, I\u2019m sure, is this. His patron\u2019s younger sister, my mother\u2019s \u2014 my\nfather\u2019s first cousin \u2014",
        "Q: And his father\u2019s first cousin\u2019s name was?",
        "A: Giuseppe Minerbi, Beppe Minerbi. And as I say, he dedicated another book,\n\u2018The Heron,\u201d to him, and there are any number of things about it. Beppe had a\nyounger sister, who married my mother\u2019s brother. They met at our \u2014 my parents\u2019\nwedding, married. So that it was not surprising that he would think, in this guy\u2019s\nhouse, of a younger \u2014 near his age, not his age, person named Finzi-Contini. And\nthen, the fact that Finzi-Contini connoted all sorts of things, pleased him. Now \u2014",
        "Q: Did he have to get permission?",
        "A: \u2014 the story \u2014 well, there\u2019s the \u2014 the story is \u2014 bu \u2014 the story in the movie and so\non, isn\u2019t about us. I can tell you almost everything that happened, whom it\nhappened to. And some happened to one, some happened to another, and \u2014 and so\non. But it wasn\u2019t our story, with one possible, interesting exception. But certainly\nnot the Finzi-Contini. Did he have to get permission? We thought that he had not,July 27, 2017\nand my mother was kind of annoyed at that. In the papers of my double cousin, that\nis this son of my mother\u2019s brother and my father\u2019s cousin \u2014",
        "Q: Minerbi \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 who died a couple of years ago.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And who was my age, and very close. We found a letter that he had not\nparticularly seen, because he \u2014 he never talked about \u2014 and he would have, we\u2019ve\ntalked about the thing, to his father, my uncle.",
        "Q: From Barani(ph)?",
        "A: From Bassani.",
        "Q: Bassani, excuse me.",
        "A: Saying, I\u2019m writing a book, and I want to call it \u201cThe Garden of the Finzi-\nContini.\u201d I thought of you because of that. So that I am quite sure of the story \u2014\nnobody knows this, but 1t\u2019s so \u2014 and I\u2019m \u2014 that he sort of asked for permission. And\nthat\u2019s how that came to.",
        "Q: Did your mother fa \u2014 did you find tha \u2014 were you able to tell your mother this?",
        "A: No, my mother was long since dead.",
        "Q: It went pa \u2014 okay.",
        "A: I just learned this two years ago, when my cousin died.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My mother made peace with Bassani. It was an intere \u2014 that\u2019s another story,\nthat is really to decide, but \u2014",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s come \u2014 I mean, I do want to discuss the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 \u201cThe Garden of the Finzi-Continis,\u201d as a movie, as a work of art, as\nsomething that is \u2014",
        "A: And as \u2014 also as \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because where it \u2014 there are interesting questions about that. Bassani himself\ndidn\u2019t like the movie for certain reasons.",
        "Q: Oh, did he? Okay.",
        "A: No. He pulled himself away, and then it\u2019s a reason, all which have to do with\nthe treatment of Jews during that time, and so on. So \u2014",
        "Q: So let\u2019s \u2014 I'd like to talk about that, but let\u2019s leave that for later, so that we make\na distinction between what is truly your family\u2019s story \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and then \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the taking of that story \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, it \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and sometimes twisting or changing.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Yeah.",
        "Q: Iam \u2014I must say, I am awed to learn of such a history, that goes back so many\ncenturies, and that it would be known. I mean, there are many things that come to\nmy mind as you\u2019re telling. Number one, that there would be enough factual\nknowledge to be able to support some of the stories that you hear.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I mean, that is unusual in itself",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And number two, that there is no assimilation. And yet \u2014",
        "A: No, there\u2019s no \u2014",
        "Q: No assimilation. We have two millennia.",
        "A: Well, that is interesting too, because at \u2014 at any number of times, in the history\nof this Zekanym(ph), Delvecchio(ph), DeLugo(ph) family, you have first names\nthat sound Catholic. And at other times you have names that are nondescript, like\nAlexander, Cyrus, names that Jews who were assimilating had. And at other times\nyou have names which are clearly Jewish, Ekakoh(ph), Solomone(ph),\nJuly 27, 2017\nAbramo(ph), and so on. So that I think \u2014 and I think it is clearly the case, that at\nmany times, in the history of these families, some married Catholics, some\nassimilated, some came back. At times it was done because it was useful. At times\nit was done because people did. But then, there always was a pull back. And that\u2019s\nkind of interesting, because no \u2014 my \u2014 it\u2019s another story, but my mother became\nCatholic, and I was brought up Catholic. My wife is an old Yankee. My daughter,\nBianca Finzi-Contini reconverted.",
        "Q: To Judaism?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: To Judaism?",
        "A: Yeah. And her daughter, Ginevra(ph) Finzi-Contini Gilmore is going to have\nher Bat Mitzvah this coming June. So \u2014 and the same is true of some branches in\nItaly. It\u2019s just a very complicated tale.",
        "Q: It is. It is, and it is very different from \u2014 from both the history of Jews in other\ncountries, and their lives \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 in these other countries, and their identities in these other countries.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Because as a \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "A: Which has something to do with what happened to us when we came here, but\nthat\u2019s another \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll come there. So, tell me a\u2014 are we at noontime yet?",
        "A: We\u2019re fine, no.",
        "Q: Okay, we have a bit of time.",
        "A: They\u2019re going to tell us.",
        "Q: Okay. So tell me a little bit about this, about \u2014 well, let\u2019s start with some factual\nthings. Your mother, did she have siblings?",
        "A: She had three siblings. She was the eldest.",
        "Q: Okay, Bianca.",
        "A: Then her \u2014 the second, Bruna(ph) Finzi-Contini was the one who married the\nMinerbi.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The third, Marcella(ph), married a man named Guido Tedeschi, who was of a\nvery, very wealthy old, very Jewish family of Bologna.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And their story, they ended up going to Brazil, and their story is another\ninteresting story, why they went to Brazil, and it\u2019s part of our story of coming. And\nthen a younger brother, Renato(ph), who married a woman of a Sephardic family,July 27, 2017\nbut who also was in some other way a cousin, because there were many inter-\ncousins marriage. And their son 1s still alive, and lives in Milan, and is a very close\nfriend.",
        "Q: Okay, so to it \u2014 so there was bianc \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: And my father\u2019s family, instead, were free. My father was the youngest, he had\nan older sister Renata, who was one of the founders of clinical psychology. She\nfled to America \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 too. Then Cecilia(ph), who \u2014 neither were married. She stayed in Italy, and\nlooked after my grandmother, and did some quite courageous and remarkable\nthings during the war.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And after the war, she came and joined us, but both are buried in the Jewish\ncemetery in Ferrara.",
        "Q: And your father\u2019s name is?",
        "A: Massimo.",
        "Q: Massimo. So, he was the youngest of three.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And he had two elder sisters.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And your mother ha \u2014 was the oldest of four.",
        "A: Four.",
        "Q: And how \u2014",
        "A: She had two younger brothers and one younger sister.",
        "Q: Sister, okay. Why is it that your mother eith \u2014 was it herself, or her parents who\nconverted to Catholicism?",
        "A: She converted. That\u2019s actually a very interesting story. She converted, and my\nfather, who did not, and who is interesting, because I don\u2019t think practically ever\nset foot in a synagogue. He was a not a believer in any way, though he wanted, and\nwe'll talk about that, to be buried in the Jewish cemetery in Ferrara, and he \u2014 it\u2019s a\ncomplicated business. But he would, I think, have been extremely upset if my\nmother had done what many, many people in her family, and in all sorts of other\nfamilies did, was to convert because of the racial laws. Because he would have\nthought \u2014 he thought that was cowardly. Or, done for financial reasons, which it\nwas done. I\u2019m not one to judge; many people did that, and so on. My mother\nconverted, I\u2019m quite sure, for a very odd reason. She was a highly intellectual\nwoman, PhD in Italy, PhD here. In some ways, a feminist. And not in a modern\nway, but a woman who \u2014 and at some point, she decided she believed in God. AndJuly 27, 2017\nthe problem was that all these ancient Italian Jewish families, pretty much all of\nthem, were non-practicing, non-believers. I mean, you know, we were Jewish\nbecause that was the great tradition. It was almost a snobbery. It was something we\nwere very, very keen on, and are still very, very keen on. But it was not a religious\nmatter, at all. But people in Italy who were religious, were all Orthodox. Now, for\na woman who thought herself liberated, to be Orthodox at that time \u2014 we\u2019re talking\n1920s and so on, 30s, that didn\u2019t fit. And so \u2014",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t have choices.",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s a little ironical today.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: She became Catholic because this was a way to practice, because she didn\u2019t feel\nyou could just be religious, and not.",
        "Q: And not associated with something.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And \u2014 and my father respected that in a way that he would not have\nrespected \u2014 he didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

That is her father,\nFinzi-Contini\u2019s mother was a noble Catholic who died in childbirth with my\ngrandfather.

My father,\nnon-practicing anything, but very conscious of his Jewish heritage, and very\ndefinitely not \u2014 I \u2014 I insisted, when I put my name in for a freshman at \u2014 you know,\nGuido Calabresi, son of Massimo Calabresi and Bianca Finzi-Contini, because\nthe name, it wasn\u2019t the book or the thing then, but the name Finzi 1s a classic\nItalian Jewish name. So that anybody who knows anybody sees Finzi, says Jewish.\nSo it \u2014 I was conscious enough of that, while being \u2014",

        "A: Oh well, 1-in the yearbook, in the freshman yearbook, where you have \u2014 you say\nwho you are, and what your parents, I could have put Massimo and Bianca\nCalabresi. But instead, I put \u2014",

I almost never \u2014 when I was in high school, I sometimes\nused the name Guy, which is the English for Guido, but basically I never used it.\nMy brother \u2014 again, it had more to do with what happened when we first came. In\nthat sense became more \u2014 slightly more conformist, and he was known as Paul. He\nbecame chief of medicine at Brown, and was one of the fen \u2014 founders of cancer\nchemotherapy.",
        "Q: Wow. Wow. Let\u2019s go back now \u2014",

        "Q: It\u2019s fascinating.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: But let\u2019s go back to your early years. You say that you were born in Milan, and\nthat it was in an apart \u2014 you were born at home, not in a hospital?",
        "A: I was born at home.",
        "Q: Okay, in a \u2014",
        "A: We were very wealthy. And our house was a very fan \u2014 you know, it\u2019s a very\nelegant apartment, and \u2014 and then our house, as I say, is the to \u2014",
        "Q: Now the Turkish embassy.",
        "A: \u2014 townhouse that \u2014 and we had a great deal of help. I\u2014 my brother and I never\nthought of ourselves as being rich. You know, you don\u2019t. Children don\u2019t. And we\nhad a wonderful nanny, who came back to look after my children when we went on\nJuly 27, 2017\nsabbatical for the first time. And we lived what seemed to be a very ordinary life.\nUnderneath, there was a tremendous struggle, because my father, from the earliest\ndays of fascism, had been an active anti-fascist. He was first beaten and jailed in\n1924, when he was a student in Florence.",
        "Q: Studying what?",
        "A: They were in Florence because my grandparents had moved from Ferrara to\nFlorence. They had moved from Ferrara to Florence because my grandfather\nCalabresi, who was an industrialist, was a very powerful man. His wife, Minerbi,\nwas a \u2014 probably the wealthiest family in Ferrara, certainly the wealthiest Jewish\nfamily in Ferrara, of great landowners. They owned huge amounts of land. To the\nfascists, in a small town like Ferrara, having this pair, who were fiercely anti-\nfascist, was too dangerous. And so they said, out of here. You can go anywhere in\nItaly you want, but not in Ferrara. And if you come back to Ferrara, we'll jail\nyou. So my par \u2014 grandparents, moved to Florence. And there is, my oral historian\nfound a letter from the fascist prefect in Ferrara, to the fascist prefect in Florence,\nyou\u2019ve gotten yourself a real headache, because Ettare(ph) Calabresi \u2014 my\nerandfather\u2019s name \u2014 likes to talk, causes trouble, has re \u2014 millions to support his\ntrouble, and he is going to cause you \u2014 my grandfather went away. My father\nbecame actively anti-fascist, and part of a small group of democrats with a small d,July 27, 2017\nwho were anti-fascist. They didn\u2019t belong to any ism. He helped distribute the first\nunderground newspaper, non mollare, don\u2019t give up. Was called justice and\nliberty, \u201cGiustizia e liberta.\u201d And on his grave it says, in Italian, faithful to justice\nand liberty, which is a pun, both \u2014 he was, as I say, va \u2014 was very, very active.\nWhen it c-came clear that Mussolini wouldn\u2019t fall, that they couldn\u2019t bring him\ndown, in the late 20s, early 30s, my father wanted to leave.",
        "Q: Italy\u201d",
        "A: Yeah. My grandfather was a patriot of the old school, and said, one doesn\u2019t\nleave one\u2019s country, one stays and fights. And so we stayed. In the fall of 1937, my\ngrandfather died of natural causes. That same summer, slightly before, the two\nbrothers who had become heads of this small group of anti-fascists \u2014 they were\nnamed Rosselli, and everywhere in Italy you\u2019ll find a square or a boulevard named\nFratelli Rosselli, Roselli brothers, were murdered by the fascists. So my f \u2014 and\nthey were my father\u2019s closest friends. And my aunt, the one who came, were just\nvery close friends. So my father said, it\u2019s getting too close, and with his father\ndying, he didn\u2019t feel an obligation to stay. So in 1937, before the racial laws, my\nfather decided that we would leave. But that was not easy, because you couldn\u2019t\nleave.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s get to that in a minute. You say he was beaten up in the early 20s.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you know the circumstances of that?",
        "A: Oh, I know the circumstances very well. I\u2019ve told it in some commencement\ntalks. One of my commencement talks at Connecticut College, many years ago, 1s\nlisted in the best \u2014 10 best commencement talks, as published somewhere, because\nit was choices.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And one of the stories is how my father chose to become an active anti-fascist.\nAnd I asked him, and he said, everybody talks about the banality of evil, no one\ntalks about the banality of good, and it is equally \u2014 well, here\u2019s how it happened. I\nwas a student at the University of Florence, because we had moved to Florence,\nand the fascists had kicked out the president of the university because he was very\nstrong and tough, and \u2014",
        "Q: And you\u2019re talking now in your father\u2019s voice.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Massimo is saying I was in a \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. This is 1924 \u2014 \u201923, \u201924, something like that, \u00b024. And he \u2014\nthey kicked out the president, and my father said \u2014 and they put in his place, one of\nour teachers, professor, I don\u2019t know, of anatomy of physiology or something. WasJuly 27, 2017\na nice man, we liked. And wasn\u2019t particularly fascist, but was weak. So but \u2014 ah, he\nwas installed, and he was our teacher, so we went to the installation. And he gave a\nspeech, and fine, and we applauded. And then the fascist minister of education got\nup, and gave a horrible speech. Well, him just saying, you\u2019ll do this, you\u2019ll do that,\nyou'll do the other, just horrible. You can imagine. And he stopped in the middle,\nas politicians will do for applause, and my father said, I didn\u2019t applaud. And said\nsome \u2014 couple of us didn\u2019t applaud. We didn\u2019t hiss or boo. We were much too well\nbrought up to do anything like that. But we just didn\u2019t applaud. Then somebody\nbehind me said, the next time he stops, you\u2019d better applaud, because there are\nsome goons at the back who are taking the names of those who are not applauding.\nMy father said, I was 21 years old. If somebody had told me that if I went and\ndidn\u2019t applaud I\u2019d get into trouble, I probably would have stayed home. Or I might\neven have gone and applauded. But here I didn\u2019t applaud, and now somebody told\nme I had to applaud. I couldn\u2019t do it. So I didn\u2019t applaud the next time, and when\nwe left, we got picked up and beaten up. And I said, what happened then? He said,\nwe went to wash. And I said, why? He said, we didn\u2019t want to go home, people\nlived at home, and they [indecipherable] the university, and show ourselves\nbloody, to scare our \u2014 our parents would have been frightened. And I said, where\ndid you wash? Well, there was a fountain right there, and so we washed there. And\nJuly 27, 2017\nso I said, did you wash there to show you had been beaten up? And he said, I don\u2019t\nthink so, no. He became a little bit \u2014 but we washed there, and the fascists thought\nthat we did, and so they picked us up again and beat us up again and tossed us into\njail. And so, at that point, I was an active anti-fascist. I mean, that was it. And he\nthen did other things. On the anniversary, he and my aunts \u2014 and this been written\nup recently \u2014 on the anniversary of the murder of the leader of the anti-fascists,\nMatteotti, on the first anniversary they went to put a big crown of flowers at\nGaribaldi\u2019s memori \u2014 thing, and the fascists picked them up again and tossed them\nin jail, and that\u2019s how that happened.",
        "Q: So in some ways they made him an anti-fascist.",
        "A: Yes",
        "Q: He had the inclination \u2014",
        "A: He said \u2014 you know, there were many people who were anti-fascist, but the\ndifference was between those who became actively, and that became that. Now,\nyou know, again, in terms of choices and non-choices, which is what I say in that,\nfast-forward to 1963, and the march on Washington \u2014",
        "Q: Oh yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 with Martin Luther King. I had been planning to go, and then I got\nfrightened, because now everybody thinks of it as a Sunday school picnic, but atJuly 27, 2017\nthe time there were bombings in Alabama, congress fled town, everybody was\nscared. And I had a one year old child, Bianca, Jonathan\u2019s wife, and I thought\ngee, you know, the march will take place, it doesn\u2019t really need me. And so \u2014\nduring the week before the march, I\u2019m talking to my father on the phone, and he\nsaid, oh, I\u2019m going to Washington this weekend. And I said, why? And he said,\nI\u2019m going to the march. And I \u2014 I thought of him as being very old, he was maybe\n20 years younger than I am now, but you know how kids are, and I said, but it may\nbe dangerous. And he said, I\u2019m going. I said, well, then I\u2019ll go with you. And he\nsaid, I thought you would. And of course, we went together, and it was a\ntremendous experience for me, to be there as part of that wonderful event. Not so\nmuch the speeches now one talks of, but just walking with thousands of people,\nholding hands, and so on. And it made a big difference to me, and I know that my\nfather was creating a non-choice for me, as he had done.",

        "A: Yeah.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: You know? It is, in essence a small step, and what that small step of non-\napplauding \u2014",

        "Q: \u2014 truly meant.",

        "Q: Yeah.",

And the story is \u2014 and I don\u2019t know it, you know, this is more\nhearsay, that what happened was that it was illegal to leave Italy permanently.\nFascist, you know, dictatorial countries don\u2019t want people to leave. But you could\nget out if you had a fellowship for a year, you know, or a term, or something of that\nsort.

And my father was\nhis right hand, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 an associate professor of cardiology there.

In August one went\nto the mountains, and in September, one went to, in this case my mother\u2019s parents\u2019\nvilla outside Bologna. And the father of the family would join you for a m\u2014 on\nweekends, and the month that he took vacation. And my father, being a mountain\nclimber, would join us in August, when we usually would go in the Dolomites,\nsometimes in Va-Val d\u2019Aoste, but usually the Dolomites, and almost always, the\nwhole family would manage to go, cousins, aunts, uncles, to the same place. I\nmean, arranging where you went, you would rent houses in someplace on the shore,\nand everybody would go there. And one year you\u2019d be in the Adriatic, another the\nMediterranean, and that would be that. And I have many, many memories of theseJuly 27, 2017\ntimes, both in the mountains, and photographs of us in the mountains, and in the\nseashore, and all of those things with my cousins. And we were all very calm,\nbecause my parents, though actively anti-fascist, did not make a point of saying this\nto us, especially because my father was determined to leave, and he thought there\nwill be time enough to talk about those things, but anything of that sort that was\ntold to us, might make it, in fact, even more difficult. So we grew up, and were at\nschool, public school, because in Italy everybody went to public school, unless you\nwere either very stupid, or totally bigoted, but you just didn\u2019t go to any other kind\nof school. There was an event which says something about the underlying life.\nSometime during my first grade, which would be 1938, I guess, there was a large\nfuneral of some fascist bigwig. And the fascists wanted everybody, all the children\nin schools, to march in the funeral parade, in uniform, because we were all\nsupposed to march in uniform, and do all things in uniform, and things. And my\nolder brother, who was in third grade, at an age where they already marched with\nrifles, with guns.",
        "Q: Really? And eight and nine year old boys?",
        "A: Yes, yes, which may say something about my attitude about guns. And said,\nwe\u2019re not gonna march. This is ridiculous, children with guns shouldn\u2019t march, this\nis all so\u2014 where he got that, I do not know.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: He told his teachers?",
        "A: He told me that we were not going to march. I said fine, because he was my\nolder brother, I always did what he wanted. And I said, how are we gonna get out\nof it? He said, we\u2019re going to say that our uniforms are being washed, and we can\u2019t\nafford to have two sets. Of course, it was ridiculous, but we didn\u2019t know that. And\nwe insisted, and we did not march. With the result that I got that term, the only\nfailing grade I have ever gotten. It was, I failed fascist behavior, comportomento\nfascista, and it\u2019s right there on my report card, for \u2014",
        "Q: I mean, if there\u2019s a badge of honor, there it is.",
        "A: Yeah, there it is. So, this is by way of saying that there was this funny,\nunderlying kind of a thing of \u2014 that we may have known more, or at least my\nbrother, who was just eight, nine \u2014 he was two and a half years older than \u2014 than I,\neight at that time. We \u2014 that we kind of were there, and you know. Now, you asked\nin ab \u2014 ab \u2014 we were talking about Ferrara, and the house there \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, I wanted to find about Ferrara and \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: I have no recollection of going to that house.",
        "Q: The house that belonged to your \u2014",
        "A: To my father\u2019s first cousin. At that time, it belonged to his uncle \u2014",
        "Q: Right.July 27, 2017",
        "A: \u2014my grandmother\u2019s brother. And I was thinking about that, because I remember\nvery well being at my mother\u2019s parents\u2019 villa outside of Bologna. I remember very\nwell Florence, where we would always go in the spring for Pasqua.",
        "Q: Passover?",
        "A: Easter. Pesach. I don\u2019t know, I mean, we didn\u2019t celebrate either, and my\ngrandparents didn\u2019t celebrate either, but it was that time of year, and it\u2019s interesting\nthat the word for Easter in Italian is Pasqua, which is both Pesach and Easter, and\nthat we would always go, wherein Florence was in flower by then, while Milan\nwas likely to be foggy, so it\u2014 my memories of going to my grandparents in\nFlorence, and they had a wonderful garden, and the gardeners were marvelous\npeople and played with us and so on and so forth. These are wonderful memories of\nthat \u2014 the house, as storied during the war, how it survived and didn\u2019t and so on.\nAll of that. But I have no memory of going to the house in Ferrara, or to seeing\nthat. And I was thinking about that just now, and the answer is quite obvious. My\ngrandparents were prohibited from going there by the fascists. So, of course I\ndidn\u2019t go, they didn\u2019t go back to Ferrara.",
        "Q: Because they had been kicked out.",
        "A: And \u2014 because they had been kicked out. And so, of course, we didn\u2019t either.\nNow maybe my father went to see his cousin and so on, but this was not a place,July 27, 2017\neven though it was this family site on my father\u2019s family \u2014 my mother\u2019s family was\nin Bologna \u2014 but we didn\u2019t go there, I\u2019m quite sure, because my father \u2014 my\ngrandfather couldn\u2019t go there. And I know that once he went, because there was a\nfuneral of a friend, and he thought he snuck in, and they arrested him. He \u2014 we\nwere rich enough so that none of that mattered.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, you could always buy your way out, and that, but I think the answer\nabout why I didn\u2019t really focus on Ferrara until after the war is because \u2014",
        "Q: Cause of that.",
        "A: \u2014 my branch had been exiled from there.",
        "Q: But there was other branches of the family that could stay \u2014",
        "A: Of course, because they \u2014",
        "Q: They weren\u2019t as wealthy.",
        "A: They were wealthy, they were there, and they were, of course, mildly anti-\nfascist, or anti-fascist, but they were not in trouble in the way my father and my\ngrandfather were. The story is told that this cousin, who came to own these lands,\nwas a cousin who \u2014 in whose house, when the garden was written, the son of the\nthen proprietor, but who was already \u2014 he had studied agriculture because he was\nmanaging all these lands, which were bef \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "Q: Let\u2019s remind us of his name, this \u2014",
        "A: Beppe Minerbi.",
        "Q: Pepe(ph) Minerbi, mm-hm.",
        "A: The story is told \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 by my \u2014 my father told me, that in the 1930s, he was a \u2014 there was a prize\ngiven by the fascists for the greatest increase in, I think it was wheat production.\nHe had studied agriculture and wanted to put in modern methods and so on, and\nwas able to convince his farmers to go along with doing these. They wanted to do\nthings in traditional ways, and he wanted to do that, by promising them that if they\nwon the prize, he would give it to them. They won the prize, and at that point the\nfascists said, you are to give the prize to the fascist party as a sign of solidarity. He\nhad always been, you know, philosophically anti-fascist, but hadn't done \u2014 he had\nalways argued with my father, my father shouldn\u2019t have gotten into trouble. He,\nstubborn, but is \u2014 look, I promised the prize to my farmers, I\u2019m giving the prize to\nmy farmers. I\u2019m perfectly happy to give you some money, but the prize \u2014",
        "Q: Goes to the farmers.July 27, 2017",
        "A: \u2014 goes to the farmers. The fascists said, no the prize you have to give to the\nfascist party, as a symbol of that. At that point he refused, and at that point they\nbeat him up. He didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, that was just an isolated \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 incident, but it shows both \u2014 how most people were kind of going along, even\nif they were anti-fascist in a mild way. And so that\u2019s what the people who were in\nFerrara did. They were not \u2014 they were anti-fascist, but they weren\u2019t going to get\ninto trouble. On the other hand, at that point, he got into trouble. Not permanent\ntrouble, but because of that.",
        "Q: But also on a point, you know, at the point where your father had said, I am not\ngoing to applaud, your uncle \u2014 he would have been your great-uncle, Pepe(ph)?",
        "A: Beppe was his cousin.",
        "Q: Was his cousin, so he would have been your \u2014",
        "A: He was \u2014 well, he\u2019s a cousin, first cousin.",
        "Q: He\u2019s cousin for you.",
        "A: He was the son of my great-uncle.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he was in Ferrara, he was studying in Ferrara, the \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "Q: But for him too, it\u2019s a point of, in some ways, of honor, that he had made a\npromise, and he wanted to keep that promise.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And that happened many, many years later. But it was \u2014 it would\nhave been, had that happened earlier, something which could have led him to be\nlike my father.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: As it happened, this was in the 30s, and then, the next thing that happens 1s, as\nwe are desperately trying to get out, and I\u2019m told that we had this offer of this\nfellowship from Yale.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But the fascists were not anxious to have people who were so articulate, as my\nparents both were, come and tell people here, what things were like. Because\nMussolini was saying he made the trains run on time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: All nonsense, you know, all nonsense, because for instance, he came and\nopened the great new hospital that my father\u2019s chief had gotten money for. It was\nall anti-fascist, but Mussolini came and opened it, and all the newspapers said that.\nSo they didn\u2019t want people here to say what it was really like. And so the story is,\nthat when our application for a temporary visa, to go for a term, which should haveJuly 27, 2017\nbeen granted, somebody was told, every time it comes to the top of a pile, put it at\nthe bottom. Fortunately, bureaucrats don\u2019t rip up paper. So it got put at the bottom.\nThis being Italy, we also had somebody in that office who was told, every time it\ngoes to the bottom \u2014",
        "Q: Bring it to the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 move it near the top. He \u2014 neither of these people \u2014 this \u2014 this person didn\u2019t\nhave the stamp. Finally, finally, one day the guy who was supposed to put it at the\nbottom wasn\u2019t there, and the guy \u2014 our guy had put it near the top, and the guy who\nwas stamping was just stamping, so we got permission. But by this time, it was into\nni \u2014 late 1938, and everything had changed, because the racial laws had been\npassed. So at that point, we really didn\u2019t even need that, because we were being \u2014\nwe could be kicked out. But the importance of a fellowship is that it gave us a way\nof coming into the United States. Because United States wasn\u2019t accepting people.",
        "Q: Now, do you \u2014 did your parents ever tell you about any experiences they might\nhave had with the U.S. officials in Italy, to be able to come to the U.S.?",
        "A: We were never told that. I do know that with this invitation to go, my father\nwent and gave a lecture in Brussels.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: And there got, at the American consulate there, immigration papers, because we\nhad this invitation of a fellowship, and we had gotten somebody who had had\nbusiness dealings with one of my grandparents, to sign an affidavit. There\u2019s a story\nabout that, because that person thought that we would never need money, because\nwe were very wealthy, and they expected that we had money abroad. But both my\ngrandparents were, as I said, patriots of the old school, and they had no money\nabroad.",
        "Q: Everything was in Italy.",
        "A: Everything was in Italy, because that was the law, and they abided by it, even\nthough they were anti-fascist. But these persons, and interesting was a long term\nstory about that, about when we arrived, had signed their affidavit. So with that,\nsince the Italian quota was not being met, because you couldn\u2019t leave Italy if you\nwere \u2014 unless you were Jewish and being kicked out. So it was relatively easy for\nus, with this invitation, and with these, to get permission \u2014",
        "Q: From the Americans.",
        "A: \u2014 from the Americans. So we left Italy with \u2014 as if we were going for a term \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stop \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and came to America, when we landed, as if we were with regular\nimmigration papers.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: Okay. I\u2019m going to step back a little bit. If I] understood you correctly, you were\nsaying, according to, let\u2019s say, the Italian bureaucracy, you were leaving\ntemporarily \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 for just a term. According to the American bureaucracy, you were\nimmigrating to the compa \u2014 country.",
        "A: Because we had both kinds of papers.",
        "Q: Papers. Now, somewhere I read that your leaving Italy was not such a\nstraightforward thing, either.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: That it was one ship, and then another ship.",
        "A: Yeah. What happened was that my mother\u2019s parents were very much against our\nleaving. They thought, even though the racial laws had been passed, they thought\nthat everything would be okay. And in some ways, well, things were difficult,\nespecially if you weren\u2019t wealthy, if you were really wealthy, nothing very much\nhappened until 1943, when Italy surrendered, and the Germans came in.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to interrupt here, I\u2019m sorry to do that, but before we proceed with the\nstory, there are going to be people who don\u2019t know what the racial laws were \u2014",
        "A: Okay.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "Q: \u2014 and what year they were passed.",
        "A: In 1938, at the end of 1938, Mussolini, who had previously not been\nparticularly with Hitler \u2014 at one point he had sent troops to the Austrian border to\nkeep Hitler from moving into Austria, but had decided to side with Hitler. And\nthere had been people around him who were anti-Semitic. But anyway, whether\nfrom \u2014 not so much from his point of view, he was a nasty man, but that \u2014 but\ngoing along with Hitler, passed laws restricting Jews in any number of dramatic\nways. On the face of them, they were absolutely catastrophic, and some things hit\ndirectly. For instance, you couldn\u2019t teach in universities, or anyplace else. And so\nmy father and my aunt were immediately kicked out of their positions as professors\nat that time.",
        "Q: This is your aunt who taught psychology?",
        "A: This is my aunt who taught psychology. And so they \u2014 you know, in that, you\nalso were not allowed, supposedly, to have help of anybody who was Catholic. But\nof course, some of the help you\u2019d always had, would stay on, and you also got help\nof somebody \u2014 we had a French governess who was a Protestant. We didn\u2019t realize\nwhat that meant, but there it was, if you were wealthy. Now, you supposedly could\nnot hold properties of certain sorts, and more than a certain amount \u2014 and I'll have\nmore to say about that, how that was avoided. And you also were not supposed toJuly 27, 2017\ngo to school, to the public schools. So these were draconic laws, and they had an\neffect on any number of people, and created anti-Semitism, which by and large in\nItaly had not been. There had been some church anti-Semitism, and some church\nphilo-Semitism. There were people in the Catholic church who were very pro-Jews,\nand you know, all that complications. But these laws were passed, and at that point,\nany number of things happened. As to schools, the Catholic schools, Jesuit schools\nwere open. They were private schools. So that many of my cousins went to Jesuit\nschools, because they weren\u2019t the public schools.",
        "Q: What about you and your brother?",
        "A: We were still, that year, we were still in public schools. So at 1938, we were\nstill in public school. The matter is more complicated because \u2014 and this is\nsomething I hadn't real \u2014 realized, but 1t explains some things that my oral historian\nfound, that in the Italian racial laws, who was not considered Jewish for certain\npurposes, including owning of property, was a very complicated matter. Unlike\nGermany, where if you had Jewish blood, end of it; if you were the product of a\nmixed marriage, and were Christian, you were considered Christian for purposes of\nowning property.",
        "Q: Okay.July 27, 2017",
        "A: And you could continue owning property. Now, there might be difficulties and\nso on, but you could. My mother\u2019s father was born of a Catholic mother, who died\nwhen he was born.",
        "Q: Right, in childbirth.",
        "A: At that point, he converted to Catholicism, with the help of a Dominican who\nwas very anti-fascist \u2014",
        "Q: So as an 0 \u2014 as a grown man, he converted.",
        "A: As a grown man in 1938.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: With the help of a man who was a very important Dominican, fiercely anti-\nfascist, fought with the partisans later. His name was Patrick Azatti(ph), I knew\nhim, I met him after the war, he was a great man. He cou \u2014 my grandfather\nconverted, and told everybody in his family, all the Finzi-Contini and their\nrelatives, to convert. Because if he converted, he was a Christian, for purposes of\nthe racial laws. He then married in this ancient, ancient Jewish family, but that was\na mixed marriage. So their children, if they were Catholic, were also Christian in\nterms of being able to own property. So all of these people in my mother\u2019s family,\nwere able to own property.",
        "Q: Did they all convert after he did?July 27, 2017",
        "A: They all converted. Some converted and it took, and they remained Catholic.\nSome converted and it didn\u2019t, because they were just converting for v \u2014 purposes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My grandfather actually, because of this memory of his mother whom he never\nknew, I think actually converted. He died in 1941, and \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Of natural causes?",
        "A: Of natural causes, of cancer, and \u2014 and so, you know, it was in \u2014 but that meant\nthat the properties remained in our names.",
        "Q: Mother\u2019s \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: In that side of the family. In my father\u2019s side of the family, the Calabresi, there\nwas my father and my two aunts. My mother \u2014 or, none of whom \u2014 my two aunts\nwere not married. My father was married to my mother, and it\u2019s at that point, only\nat that point that my brother and I are baptized. And if I think about it, we were\nbaptized because my mother thought it was a good idea at that point, and my father\ncouldn\u2019t be, but partly because my grandfather was saying, this way they will be\nable to own property. Because again, half, half, half, half \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 but it continues to go all the way through. On the Minerbi side, it happened\nthat my great-uncle had two sons, and two daughters.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: So Pepe(ph) \u2014",
        "A: My \u2014 Beppe, his older brother Julio, oldest daughter Ginevra, and youngest\ndaughter Fernanda. Beppe and Julio each had married Catholic women.\nFernanda, the youngest, had married my mother\u2019s brother, who through this series\nof tricks, was also Catholic. Now, their granddaughter, one of them \u2014 two of them\nhave converted back to Judaism, and so \u2014 so it \u2014 it\u2019s all \u2014",
        "Q: It gets confusing.",
        "A: It gets confusing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Ginevra had no children. Great-uncle, who owned all these lands and\nproperties, gives them all to his grandchildren. Why to his grandchildren? Because\nthey nominally could be Christian, for purposes of this. Now, in fact, there were\nany number of pressures, and things a-and of course, none of this matters after\n1943.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: When the Germans come in. But it was a situation in which it looked as though,\nif you wanted to, and were rich enough, you could survive, despite these horrible\nracial laws.",
        "Q: Survive and still keep some of your assets.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Keep your assets, be able to study. My father couldn\u2019t, and his sister, who\nwould, even if they converted would do no good, because of course, racially, they\ndidn\u2019t have a Catholic ancestors, but anyway, they wouldn\u2019t, because they didn\u2019t\nwant to.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t teach. Couldn\u2019t be \u2014 so it \u2014 there were all sorts of restrictions, and they\nwere horrible. On the other hand, my mother\u2019s parents thought we\u2019d be able \u2014 what\na \u2014 who knows how long this will last? Administrations come and go, and in the\nmeantime, we\u2019re able to continue to hold our properties, and do these things. So\nthey didn\u2019t want us to leave.",
        "Q: It lends logic to their point of view.",
        "A: Of course. Of course, completely logical, completely logical.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: This is our country, we live well. You want to go someplace where you go\nwithout a penny, because it was against the law \u2014 I have always said under penalty\nof death, it wasn\u2019t penalty of death, 1t was just people who were caught, get killed.\nBut we go some strange place like that. So, my mother and father agree that my\nfather will come to America and see \u2014 and to Yale, and see one can really live in\nthis country. And we will follow, after he\u2019s been here two or three months, andJuly 27, 2017\nseen whether it is possible. My grandparents, well, they had no choice in the matter\n\u2014 my mother\u2019s \u2014 but that was my mother, kind of. What happens 1s that by now, it\nis August of 1939.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: It is \u2014 that much time has passed between finally getting permission, getting\nthings, getting the American things, everything else. My father, supposedly is\nsailing from Genoa on the ship called the Conte di Savoia, which was the second\nof a great Italian ocean liners. My mother is seeing him off.",
        "Q: In Genoa.",
        "A: In Genoa. My brother and I are at Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo in the Dolomites, it\u2019s a\ngreat resort there, on that \u2014 near \u2014",
        "Q: August, it\u2019s when \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 near the Austrian border \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 with my mother\u2019s parents. I\u2019ve gone to bed, and I actually said a prayer \u2014 I\nmean, I\u2019ve just been baptized, I just [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Do you remember your baptism?",
        "A: I\u2014I remember, yeah, I remember that it was Don Angelo, it was a country\npriest at \u2014 near my mother\u2019s family\u2019s villa outside Bologna, and this was arrangedJuly 27, 2017\nby this great Patrick Azatti(ph), but it was just a local priest who talked to my\nbrother and me a little bit, and we da \u2014 we were baptized. We didn\u2019t quite know\nwhat [indecipherable] but, you know. And so, for my father, who was sailing off,\nthe telephone rings and it\u2019s my mother, who says, the ship didn\u2019t sail. They say it\u2019s\nengine trouble, and that it might sail tomorrow. Somebody in Rome has told us if it\n\u2014 war 1s breaking out. If a ship sails, and war is breaking out, we can\u2019t afford to be\nseparated, so bring the children. If the ship sails, we leave tomorrow, all together.",
        "Q: So your mother ha \u2014 gets this phone call from Rome.",
        "A: Got it \u2014 I mean, the ship didn\u2019t sail, she called somebody in Rome, or my father\ncalled somebody in Rome.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Found out \u2014",
        "Q: The circumst \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 what was going on. Told her parents, bring the children, we may sail\ntomorrow.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: My mother goes back to Milan that day, tells the maids, put everything that is in\nthe wardrobe rooms in trunks, because we\u2019re leaving. My father, since you couldn\u2019tJuly 27, 2017\nbring money out, had shirts and things, clothes made that would last him. He didn\u2019t\nbuy a shirt for 15 years.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t bring money out, but at least \u2014",
        "Q: He had clothes.",
        "A: \u2014 so he wouldn\u2019t co \u2014 so he was \u2014 had all his clothes. Our clothes, no. I mean,\neverything in wardrobe rooms gets dumped into trunks, and what was in wardrobe\nrooms wasn\u2019t what you would use every day. So \u2014 but we found our diapers there,\nwhich were made into sheets for examining beds for my father here, because you\ncouldn\u2019t affo \u2014 anyway, and my grandparents are told to bring Paul and me to\nGenoa. I remember the trip perfectly \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me.",
        "A: \u2014 because we couldn\u2019t get a sleeper \u2014",
        "Q: You were going by train, yes.",
        "A: \u2014 that late. We took the train. My grandfather had a chauffeur, but he wouldn\u2019t\nhave had him up in the mountains, he had a chauffeur at the \u2014 at \u2014 at his villa, an-\nand there \u2014 so we \u2014 with our nanny, the same nanny who had been with us, and so\nwe are all in this first class carriage, and I thought that was wonderful, because\nfamilies like ours, parents went first class, the nanny and the children went secondJuly 27, 2017\nclass, not third class, but so that they wouldn\u2019t bother people in first class. This was\nth-the way it was done, polite, children [indecipherable]. And so I loved these\nvery thick, red, velvet cushions and things, and all excited because we were going\nto America. We didn\u2019t know what that was, but my brother announced we were\ngoing to America. My mother\u2019s parents are sitting there with their hands on their\ncanes, looking like death.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Because their daughter was leaving, and they didn\u2019t know if they would ever see\nher again. In fact, my grandfather died \u2014 it was an interesting story about that, and\nshe never saw him, when we left, again. My grandmother survived. And \u2014 okay, so\nwe get to Genoa, with our nanny trying to keep us going, and the ship didn\u2019t sail.",
        "Q: The second ship.",
        "A: The same ship \u2014",
        "Q: The same ship, but it does si \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that was supposed to shi \u2014 sail \u2014",
        "Q: It doesn\u2019t sail.",
        "A: \u2014 it didn\u2019t sh \u2014 be \u2014 the engine \u2014 it wasn\u2019t engine trouble at all, so \u2014 so what do\nyou do then? You don\u2019t go back to Cortina, which is on the Austrian, now German\nborder. Don\u2019t go back to Milan, because if war ca \u2014 actually comes, it\u2019s likely toJuly 27, 2017\nbe bombed. And in fact, when war did finally come, all our furniture was in a\nwarehouse, and magnificent furniture, was all hit by a bomb, end of that. And our\nhouse was damaged, and other things like that. Where do you go? Well, you go to a\ncountry villa outside of Bologna, my mother\u2019s parents were \u2014 so my mother\u2019s\nparents, my mother and I, my brother, all go to this place outside Bologna.",
        "Q: And about how \u2014 what kind of distance between that Genoa would it have\nbeen?",
        "A: Between Boston and pen \u2014 Philadelphia, something like that.",
        "Q: Okay, good four, five hours.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Something like that.",
        "A: Mean it\u2019s long \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 longish time. So we go there. My father goes back to Milan, to see if there\u2019s\nsome other way of getting out. And there are many kind of \u2014",
        "Q: And all of this is August 1939?",
        "A: This is August \u201939, end of August \u201939. And all sorts of backs and forths. We get\na call. The American ship, the President Monroe, is coming to pick up American\nnationals, as happens when war is about to break out. They are so crowded thatJuly 27, 2017\nthey need an extra ship\u2019s doctor. I volunteered, and they\u2019ve taken me on, with my\nfamily.",
        "Q: That\u2019s your father saying that.",
        "A: Yeah. Get ready to go. Next call, they found a doctor who doesn\u2019t have a\nfamily, so it\u2019s not me. At one point \u2014 by now it\u2019s early September, I think, or \u2014",
        "Q: Or the war has started.",
        "A: \u2014 very end of August.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the exact date.",
        "Q: September first.",
        "A: I\u2019m listening on a earphone radio, and I hear that the Rex, r-e-x King, the ship\nthat appears in the movie \u201cAmarcord,\u201d in the distance, with great \u2014",
        "Q: Fellini?",
        "A: \u2014 th-the \u2014 the great ship of the Italian lines, that it won the blue ribbon for going\nacross fastest [indecipherable] is sailing on a\u2014 on September eighth. The reason is\nthat war has broken out, but Italy has decided not to join. Italy has decided not to\ngo into the war. They don\u2019t go into the war until June of 1940, when they attacked\nFrance. The hand, Roosevelt says, that has held the dagger, has plunged it into the\nback of its friend. So \u2014 so Italy is not joining, the ship is sailing. I turned to say thisJuly 27, 2017\nto my mother, in this wonderful villa, which my grandfather, who was old ha \u2014\nfashioned, had all things lit by lamp, kerosene lamps, you know, things \u2014 all these\nlights, I think flashing [indecipherable]. I turned to say to her \u2014 there makes a\nscene totally in mind, and the phone rings before I can say, it\u2019s my father calling\nfrom Milan, saying that he has tickets on that ship. He had heard before, and had\nalready gotten it. That day, the trunks arrive.",
        "Q: With the diapers.",
        "A: With the diapers and everything else.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So we turned right around, unopened, go to Genoa, and on the eighth of\nSeptember, leave.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: All four of us.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: On the ship.",
        "Q: But what a nerve-wracking month that must have been.",
        "A: The \u2014 my grandparents, my mother\u2019s parents, remained there, and we go off.\nWe land eight days later, one day to Naples, and then across, on September 16\",\n1939, a Saturday, having had a wonderful trip, because you \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "Q: I want to hear about it.",
        "A: Well, you know, a trip was this fancy ship, and we were doing all sorts of fun\nthings, and my brother, who is more of a packrat, kept all the things from the\ncaptain, so that on anniversaries he\u2019d bring them out from the captain\u2019s table, and\nall the stuff, and how much we did one day, and everything else. And \u2014 all of which\nwas wonderful, and land in New York. One problem. Because we didn\u2019t think we\nwere going to get out, my father cables Yale and says, I\u2019m coming second\nsemester. So we arrive without a fellowship.",
        "Q: So this is September \u00b039, first semester.",
        "A: Yeah, was when we were \u2014 he was planning to go, and see if you could live, and\nthen we would join him.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t happen.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t happen. The fellowship doesn\u2019t begin til January.",
        "Q: Okay, at this point \u2014 excuse me.",
        "A: And that is \u2014 and Yale is not interested at all in being helpful. I\u20191] have more to\nsay about that. So that we arrive on a Saturday, in New York, without a penny.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And the fellowship not to begin.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: I want to interrupt at this point, and specifically at this point, because there\u2019s a\nlot to say about the American part of the story.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I want to \u2014 before we do that, though, I\u2019d like to go back to Italy and talk about\nthe relatives who stayed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then, what happened to them.",
        "A: Yes. So, let\u2019s go back \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and notice that almost everybody stayed.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Not everybody. My mother\u2019s sister \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 left before we did. Why?",
        "Q: Yeah, why?",
        "A: She was married to a man named Guido Tedeschi. There are any number of\npeople named Guido Tedeschi, but this Guido Tedeschi was of a family that was\neven \u2014 well, in Bologna, which was a bigger city, and they were very, very fancy,\nthey were among the wealthiest people there. Their family owned the palace thatJuly 27, 2017\nhad belonged to the great enlightenment pope from Bologna \u2014 they still own it, I\nthink \u2014 Benedict the 13, 14, something. Some Benedict. And they had been\nadmirals and diplomats and all sorts of things like that. My aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s father,\nas a young diplomat, had been consul general of Italy in Sao Paolo, Brazil.",
        "Q: Brazil.",
        "A: The head where all the Italian community and finances were, wonderful position\nfor a young \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 diplomat. And so my uncle, my aunt\u2019s husband, grew up in Brazil, with this\ndiplomatic family.",
        "Q: Can you ask me \u2014 can you tell me, Tedeschi, is that a Jewish family, or not?",
        "A: Jewish, Jewish.",
        "Q: Jewish, okay.",
        "A: Jewish.",
        "Q: So he could join the diplomatic service?",
        "A: Oh yes, all this, you know, I mean, you know, Italy, at that time, before this,\nJews in Italy \u2014 after the unification of Italy, Jews were totally everywhere. If you\ngo to Lake Como, and you see the founding of the great yacht club, the first name\nis this great noble family, the second name is a name that is [indecipherable]July 27, 2017\nsomebody or other, who is clearly Jewish. The fir \u2014 first mayor of Rome, after the\nunification of Italy is somebody named Nathan, actually related to the Rosselli\nbrothers, whom I talked about before.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The chief justice of Italy, of the Court of Cassation, in the early days of fascism\nis aman named Mortada(ph), who is Jewish, who tries to use, what in America\nwould be judicial review to strike down fascist decrees, but there\u2019s no tradition of\nit, and so it fails. And Jews are \u2014 if they were of great families, were all over. And\nthis one was a particularly old and very, very fancy. Tedeschi, by the way, suggests\nAshkenazim, because Tedeschi means German, it means deutsche, it\u2019s the name\nAshkenazi. So if you see somebody, the name Tedeschi often is Jewish in Italy,\nand it meant \u2014",
        "Q: German.",
        "A: \u2014 deutsche. Ashkenazi.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, deutsche.",
        "A: But his mother\u2019s family, instead was Italkim and very fancy.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Anyway, he grows up in Brazil, his father dies young, while there. So they\nreturn to Italy. They return to Italy, he meets my mother\u2019s sister. Perfect marriage,July 27, 2017\nyou know, right kind of families, and so on, and they get married. He is a ch-\nchemist, and they are \u2014 she is mildly actively anti-fascist, he is not. He is of this\nfamily that was too conservative, and so on. Come the racial laws, he\u2019s insulted.\nYou know, he\u2019s simply insulted by this. And he says, why should I stay here? I\nhave all my friends in Brazil, whom I grew up with, when his father was, in fact,\nthe head of a community there, of a whole Italian financial community in Sao\nPaolo, which is the center of Italian business in \u2014 so he and his wife, my aunt, and\ntwo sons, go off to Brazil.",
        "Q: And this would be in 30 \u2014 early \u00b039?",
        "A: Thirty-s \u2014 \u201938.",
        "Q: Still \u00b038?",
        "A: They almost immedi \u2014 \u201938, maybe beginning of \u201939, but you know, almost\nimmediately for him it\u2019s not an issue of anything else. From the moment there are\nracial laws, he has all these friends there \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 any number of ways, goes, and they\u2019 ve \u2014 that family has lived in Brazil ever\nsince.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s Mama\u2019s one sister.",
        "A: One sister.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "Q: What about \u2014",
        "A: Her brothers, of course, stay. There\u2019s no reason for them to leave. The only\nother person to leave is a cousin on the side of the \u2014 my fa \u2014 my mother\u2019s mother,\nthis ancient, ancient line, whose uncle, double first cousin of my grandmother \u2014\ntwo brothers had married two sisters \u2014 was the great law professor in Italy.\nProfessor, dean, president of Rome University, the greatest law library in the\nworld, a fascist. The only fascist in the family. He actually was Minister of\nEducation for a short time. The family ostracizes him.",
        "Q: What is his name?",
        "A: His name was Giorgio Del Vecchio, Del Vecchio meaning Zekanym(ph), and\nhe was this great figure, still is. His books are all over Catholic universities and so\non. Roscoe Pound, the great dean of Harvard adored him because he was a\nfunctionalist. He made the law do what the \u2014 was needed now. Why? Because he\nwas a fascist. All the anti-fascists were formalists, using the law can\u2019t be changed\nto block this. So Roscoe Pound makes him a member of the American Academy,\nand so on. This guy, by the way, come 1943, is so famous that he just walks into\nthe Vatican, and is fine. That\u2019s how he is saved. But he was with great figure. His\nnephew, a brilliant young professor, already a full professor, says, we have livedJuly 27, 2017\noff this snobbery for 2,000 years. It has come home to roost. He\u2019s in opposition to\nhis uncle. I am going to Palestine.",
        "Q: And he does?",
        "A: And he does. And he goes there, and he becomes the founder, in 1948, of the\nHebrew University Law School, and the teacher of everybody there; Aram\nBarak(ph), Yitzhak Englard, and so on.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Also, strangely enough, Guido Tedeschi. Guy Tedeschi, because his father was\nAshkenazi, his mother was Del Vecchio. The story of how he lived there is\ninteresting, because he had to discover \u2014 there was no university for him to teach,\nhe had to discover some Sephardic ancestor, because there was a fellowship given\nto Sephardics, and he finds one on his mother\u2019s side, Ava Dzemorani(ph), and \u2014\nwho, his family started the first newspaper in Italy, my relatives, too. And anyway,\nwe just \u2014 I have it very much in mind because just two weeks ago I was in Italy,\nand one of the things that was going on in Italy was a great celebration of this man,\non the 110 anniversary of his birth, with all the people from Israel; Englard,\nArak(ph), all these people coming, and who were his students, and all other people\nin Italy celebrating this great scholar, who had gone. So he left. But he was a\ncousin, I mean \u2014\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "Q: Sure, yeah.",
        "A: \u20141s a double second cousin, but cousin. My aunt left and went to Brazil, and we\nwent to America, mainly because we were anti-fascist. Everybody else stayed.",
        "Q: What happened to them?",
        "A: Everybody survived.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: That is a series of stories which is the book that I am writing. And the stories are\nwonderful, and they are \u2014 they\u2019re interesting in themselves. But the most\ninteresting part of them are the motives of the people who saved them, in many\ninstances risking their lives to save them. And the people who saved them ranged\nfrom the poorest peasants, who didn\u2019t even know them, to, in some instances, to the\nwealthiest grandees, everything in between. People did things in Italy, which they\ndid nowhere else. Now, I don\u2019t mean to say there weren\u2019t some people who were\nterrible and did other things. I\u2019m just telling the story of my family, and every\nsingle blood relative of mine was saved. The family of Montini, who became pop \u2014\nPope Paul the sixth, saved one branch. They did it, why? And that\u2019s the interesting\nthing of this book, what were the motives? Sometimes it was sheer humanity,\nsometimes it was friendship, because we were friends. Sometimes it was gratitude,\nbecause we had done things for them. Sometimes it was fame. Respect for fame.\nJuly 27, 2017\nSometimes motives unknown. But every one of \u2014 I told you of the fascist, great\nscholar and so on, who walks into the Vatican, and \u2014 which was not open to\n[indecipherable] Jews. But he walks in, perfectly fine, continues his studies there.\nHis double first cousin, my great-uncle, who had been president of a Bocconi\nUniversity of Milan, economist Gustavo Del Vecchio, great economist, kicked out\nby the fascists, because he was anti-fascist. And he, with his sister, who had a\nhouse on Lake Como, gets in a boat, and goes to Switzerland. Switzerland is not\nopen, any more than the Vatican is. He gets off. The Swiss guard is ready to send\nhim back, he takes out a letter from Einaudi, who later becomes president of Italy,\nand who was his great pal, who was teaching at Zurich, inviting him to teach at\nZurich. The Swiss guards salute, send for a limousine, and he gets taken there.\nExactly the same thing as the other one, as his double cousin. This guy, anti-fascist,\nafter the war he comes back, becomes a cabinet minister in a postwar government.\nWhen one is up, the other is down. Analogous thing of how they were saved.\nFunny.",
        "Q: What does this \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: O-Others just \u2014 a-and I\u2019Il tell you just one story, it\u2019s not \u2014",
        "Q: Oh please.July 27, 2017",
        "A: \u2014 there are others that are more dramatic, but longer. My great-grandmother; my\nmother\u2019s mother\u2019s mother \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014aremarkable woman, whom I remember well, because she was old, but alive\nin \u2014 before we left, and who may have been the only one in the family, who in\nsome way had some element of practicing Judaism. She would not convert when\neverybody else converted. Neither did her son, who was this great-uncle who went\nto Switzerland, but \u2014 because he \u2014 he would do what his mother wanted. She was\ntold to convert, she said, sono un \u2019Israelita, basta. I\u2019m an Israelite, enough. She\ntaught me a prayer.",
        "Q: What was it?",
        "A: Which must have been a Jewish prayer.",
        "Q: Do you remember it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember it.",
        "Q: Aw.",
        "A: But I know she taught me a prayer. She sends her son and his sister away from\nher villa, and to go off to Switzerland. She is too old to survive, to go with them.\nShe is in her high 80s. And so she stays in this villa, and she says to her son, look,\nif you stay, they\u2019ll come and get us both. Especially because you\u2019re famous, soJuly 27, 2017\ntheyll find you here. Me, they may not pay any attention. And in any case, I\u2019m not\nlet \u2014 \u2019'm \u2014 she locked the house doors. I \u2014 so, but he had to go. Off he goes. When\nthe villa is liberated, she writes a 15 page letter to my mother, telling her how she\nsurvived. She writes it to my mother because she is her eldest grandchild, brilliant.\nAnd this remarkable woman, she was widowed at 23 with three children, looked\nafter everything, an amazing person. And wants the story to be told. And she tells\nthe story that she was there \u2014 and this is after 1943 \u2014 and an American plane that\nhad been bombing Bologna had somehow failed to drop all its bombs, and is trying\nto get up over the Apennines to go back home, and finds that a bomb it has let \u2014\nstill has, makes it difficult for it to get its height, and so opens the bomb thing, the\nbomb falls on the village next to the villa. It was during the day, everybody was out\nworking, so there weren\u2019t any real casualties, but the village is destroyed. My\ngrandmother says, so I did what any decent person would do, I invited the village\ninto the villa. And she said, every family got a room, and we set it all up, and I\ntaught all the women to work. She did wonderful needlepoint. And I taught the men\nto play poker. She was of a generation before bridge, it was what card playing\npeople would do. We had a wonderful time, she said, and she describes this\nwonderful thing, with the whole village living in the villa all together. This almost\n90 year old, tiny little person, just teaching. She was always a teacher, and doingJuly 27, 2017\nthese other things. And then she said, the Germans arrived. They had heard that\nthere was an old Jewish lady there. So they came to get me. And the village men\ncame out with pitchforks, hatchets, you know, and said to the German captain, over\nour dead bodies. They had been taken in. And the German captain looks at it, and\nrealizes that, of course, he could mow them down, but he\u2019s probably lose some\nmen, and it would be \u2014 and thinks, here\u2019s an almost 90 year old person, she\u2019s gonna\ndie anyway. It isn\u2019t worth it. And goes away.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how she survived.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "A: And that\u2019s one of the stories. The stories of the others are all different, all\nwonderful, and are part of the thing. I'll tell \u2014 just say two other things about that.\nOne, Beppe\u2019s father, the person whose great house it was, refused to hide.",
        "Q: This is in Ferrara?",
        "A: In Ferrara.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And no one knows why he refused to hide. Some people say that he thought that\nif he was there and was taken, his children \u2014 they might leave his children alone.\nWhich, of course, would not have happened. No one knows. There is reason toJuly 27, 2017\nbelieve that he was the prototype for the old professor in \u201cThe Garden of the\nFinzi-Contini,\u201d who wouldn\u2019t hide because it was beneath them.",
        "Q: So this is the Finzi-Contini family head",
        "A: This is \u2014 the book is being written \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 under the patronage of this guy\u2019s son, and somebody \u2014 some people have\nwritten \u2014 Sergio Minerbi, the guy \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 who has written in Israel, has written a family history, and he says it\u2019s true, I\ndon\u2019t know how he knows. But it\u2019s plausible that the model for that \u2014",
        "Q: Is the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 not hiding, because it \u2014 because \u2014 1n the garden it was because it was beneath\nthem. We don\u2019t know \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 why this guy? He actually gets taken, and would have been sent off, taken by\nthe fascists, would have been turned over to the Germans, and would have been\nsent off. The story of how he is rescued by his chauffeur, 1s another wonderful\nstory, one version of which was written up in a book called \u201cAlberto Ms Longest\nDay.\u201dJuly 27, 2017",
        "Q: I saw that on the internet, I wondered what that was.",
        "A: Yeah. That book was written by my cousin, my double cousin \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 the one I was telling you about before \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 who was a professor of geophysics, but was also a poet and an author. And he\nwrote this, which is pa \u2014 that story\u2019s partly fiction. That \u2014 how that happened is\npartly fiction, it was meant to be \u2014",
        "Q: The longest journey, yeah, that longest \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 a fiction, at the longest journey.",
        "Q: \u2014 journey, yeah.",
        "A: But it\u2019s how this guy, who didn\u2019t try to hide, was none the less rescued by his\nchauffeur, who was a Figaro type, who could do anything, and did it. So \u2014 so that\u2019s\nanother. But anyway, these stories are something that when my book comes out,\nwill all be there, all of it. What I did want to say was, what happened to my\nmother\u2019s father, because it has some interesting things for my job as a judge,\nactually. In 1940, before America joins the war, my mother\u2019s father develops\ncancer, and he was, as I say, a neurologist, way back. Turns out not to be operable,\nthough probably \u2014 don\u2019t know why, but it was cancer, but sometimes it\u2019s curable,July 27, 2017\nbut it wasn\u2019t. He forbids anybody from telling my mother. This is a man,\nremember, who didn\u2019t want my mother to leave, but he forbids anybody from\ntelling my mother that he is sick, because he knows that if my mother knows that,\nshe\u2019ll get on the first ship and go back. And probably end up separated from her\nfamily.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: My mother first hears that he is sick in a telegram from the family saying that he\nis dying, in early 1941, before America is in the war. Italy is in the war now.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And saying that he is dying. And so in \u2014 actually, she first hears from a telegram\nof condolences over fa \u2014 first from my father\u2019s sister, who is in Italy. And the thing\nis \u2014 interesting to me as a judge, because I\u2019ve seen cases \u2014 I\u2019ve sat on cases where\nthe board of immigration appeals and immigration judges said somebody, who said\nthey were persecuted, and has sought asylum, went back to their country, and then\ncame back. So it cannot be that they were being persecuted. And we had a case,\nand people on a panel with me, the other two judges, were ready to say obviously\nthat\u2019s so. And I said no, it\u2019s not obviously so. Of course it\u2019s relevant if the person\ngoes back, and you want to find out why. But I can tell you that that isn\u2019t\nnecessarily so, and here is this story. And so my panel held that you cannot make itJuly 27, 2017\nas a matter of law that somebody who goes back can\u2019t, you have to look to see why\nthey went back \u2014",
        "Q: The circumstance, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and so on. So those are a couple of stories. The others survived, as I say, in\nwonderful, mixed ways, and I \u2014",
        "Q: You know, when you\u2019re \u2014 this kind of outcome, there are lots of questions, and I\nunderstand you\u2019ve got a book that is in the \u2014 in the working, and I, you know, it\u2019s\nwhetting my appetite for it. But the stories that you are saying, and the summary\nthat you are giving, spell a kind of experience that too many other people did not\nhave in other countries.",
        "A: That is true. And one of the reasons I want to write this, is because what\nhappened in Italy \u2014 and again, now some people, including some c-cousin of mine,\nare writing about the people in Italy who did betray, who did behave badly. But\nmore people were saved in Italy, than in any other country, with a possible\nexception of Denmark. And in Denmark it was the official policy of the king, and\npeople just followed it wonderfully, and people were saved. In Italy, what was\ninteresting about it was that it was against the policy of the government, and yet\npeople behaved in ways which saved people. Now, a fair number of people were\ntaken. About 10,000 people were taken in Rome, right after Italy surrendered,July 27, 2017\nbecause the Roman Jewish community was \u2014 there was an old community around\nthe old Italian temple, of people who were relatively poor, and still living there, as\nagainst all these assimilated people all over. They too didn\u2019t think that anything\nwas going to happen. And the Germans moved in, and took any number of them, a\nfew days, right after. And it\u2019s that that gave the signal, and everybody else went\nhid, afterwards. So it immediately, a fair number. So if you look a fair number of\npeople were taken. After that, very, very few people were taken, because Italians\nhid people. Why? That\u2019s part of the story of this book. I mean, sometimes, just\nhumanity. Sometimes \u2014 and you know, sometimes the churches hid people. The\ncardinal archbishop of Florence was maybe the only man to vote against Pius the\n12\" [indecipherable]. He was much loved by people, and they tell the story, which\nI repeat in the book, but it isn\u2019t my story, but \u2014 but he told all the monasteries and\nnunneries to hide people. And that some people were being hidden in a nunnery,\nwhich had been a closed nunnery, and there were men who were being hidden, and\n\u2014and young men and young nuns, and inevitably people started making love, and\nthe Mother Superior is said, according to the story, that is very popular with\nFlorentines, goes to the cardinal and says, terrible sins are being committed here,\nwe cannot have this going on. And the cardinal says, Mother, what do you think isJuly 27, 2017\nworse? What is happening there, or to turn people out to be killed? Don\u2019t worry\nabout it, 1t?s on me.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a lovely story.",
        "A: Which is a lovely story, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, this is a story that is told there, and there are squares named after\nthis guy, and so on. So, yeah, you know, sometimes, as I say, it was just humanity.\nAnd there are people who \u2014 Italian peasants who hid Jews, partisans, anti-fascists,\nand then, when the war turned around, and Germans were running away, hid them.\nThey were all people in trouble, one said to me, when they came here. E tutti figli\nde mama, they were all some mother\u2019s child. We struggled for them.",
        "Q: Simple, but very profound.",
        "A: And it\u2019s a\u2014 you know, a very \u2014 there was something about that culture \u2014 and I\ndon\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t people who didn\u2019t, but there was something about that\nculture that caused people to save people. And by the way, it is the reason why\nalmost all Italian Jews who fled, went back.",
        "Q: You anticipated my next question.",
        "A: We did not. And a few others did not, but most people did go back to Italy, in a\nway that people did not go back to Germany, for sure, or Poland, or other\nJuly 27, 2017\ncountries, because the feeling that after all, that Italy has \u2014 and by the way, if you\nsaid \u2014 you know, somebody could say there were so few Jews in Italy, and they\nwere so assimilated, and so on \u2014 that was true in many other countries as well, but\n\u2014 but there are some figures that give the lie to that, because it\u2019s said that about\n10,000 Jews from Croatia, from the \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Who had been protected when it was Italian territory, and was a whole thing of\nGermans trying to find out whether these people were really Italians, or from\nsomeplace else, or something, but who were not at all Italian, they were \u2014 when\nItaly surrendered, fled into Italy from Croatia. And it\u2019s said that of these 10,000\npeople who fled, who were completely unassimilated, only eight people were\ntaken. So it \u2014 people were hidden. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something about \u2014 and who\nknows? I mean, you know, that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m writing this book, because\neach of us, in our lives, faces situations where we may be called on to do things,\nand there are always excuses. And these people were risking their lives.",
        "Q: I was thinking of this question as you were speaking. Or shall I put it \u2014 this is\nhalf a question, half a comment. I\u2019ve interviewed people who are \u2014 I\u2019ve\ninterviewed people who are Jewish survivors from Germany, for example, that\nyou just mentioned, or from Poland. But I want to speak \u2014 stick with Germany,\nJuly 27, 2017\nwhose families might have been in Germany, for two, three hundred years, maybe\nmore, but they can trace back that much. And sometimes when I\u2019ve met them, they\nspeak English with a German accent. Some of them still speak very good German,\nyou know, it\u2019s their first language. And I will sometimes ask the question, so what\npart of you is German? And it\u2019s very hard to answer.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Very, very hard to answer, because there was such a profound rejection.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And the rejection was not just state edicts, it went through society. But it also\nprevented someone who was the target of these edicts, and laws, and\ndiscrimination, from taking that which had been part of them, and being able to\nincorporate it, and keep it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And as you\u2019re speaking, you know, to ask you what part of you 1s Italian \u2014",
        "A: A hundred percent. I mean, you know, my \u2014 I\u2019m a hundred percent Italian, I am\nJewish. I\u2019m a hundred percent American, because I have become American. And I\nhave stories about that. When I was talking to some students from foreign\ncountries, who were here on a program, and a kid from Pakistan who had grown\nup in \u2014 in Denmark, actually, said, you know, that\u2019s all very well, but which areJuly 27, 2017\nyou? And I said, I\u2019m both. And then he said something kind of fun, he said, okay,\nbut whom do your root for when there\u2019s a World Cup in soccer? And I \u2014",
        "Q: When the rubber meets the road.",
        "A: Yeah. My answer was automatic. Of course I root for Italy. But if it were a\nworld cup in baseball, I\u2019d root for reuta \u2014 United States. And it\u2019s not that the\nUnited States is better in one than in the other. In the last World Cup, United\nStates was good and Italy was terrible. It\u2019s just that I associate one with Italy, and\nso then I\u2019m Italian. And I associate the other one with America, and so of course,\nI\u2019m a Yankee fan, of baseball. And that\u2019s the way that is. And I am in that sense,\nwhy didn\u2019t we go back? And that\u2019s an interesting story in itself, which has to do in\na way, with what\u2019s happened later, but think of it this way. Comes late 40s, 50s, my\nparents go back and see, and are undecided. My father probably is leaning towards\ngoing back.",
        "Q: He who wanted to leave.",
        "A: He who wanted to leave, but you know, fine. My mother may be more likely to\nwant to stay here, oddly, because my father had been able \u2014 his family, his sister\nand his mother, after the war, had joined us here, or were going to join us if we \u2014\nbut he thinks in terms of going back, maybe. He is having a career here, but yeah,\nyou know. My mother, oddly in some ways, because it is easier for a woman,July 27, 2017\nstrangely, to have a career in Italy than here \u2014 she couldn\u2019t get appointed to the\nYale faculty, though they tried, because women were not teaching at Yale at the\ntime. But she thinks if she goes back, people will not take her career seriously,\nbecause she is too much this elegant lady, you know, and that \u2014 but they\u2019re\nuncertain. So the thing falls, in many ways, on my brother and me. And my brother\nand I, separately, first he goes back, because he\u2019s older. Then a couple of years\nlater, I go back. And we both have the same reaction, that 1t would be horrible to go\nback to Italy and be poor, because this is after the war, and everything is still \u2014 but\nto go back to Italy and be who we were, with all the losses, because buildings were\nhit, things were not looked after, properties had to be put in other names\n[indecipherable] the Calabresi things to survive, because they didn\u2019t fit to that\ncategory, and so on. So we were not as rich, by any means, as we were before, but\nwe're still. But to go back and be wealthy, was something that we were too\nAmerican, too egalitarian to conceive of doing.",
        "Q: It made you that, yeah.",
        "A: We had become outsiders, coming to America, and to be insiders, as we would\nhave been there, was something that my brother and I, both instinctively, could not\ntake. I will tell you my own experience in that. I go with the chauffeur who saved\nAlberto M, who was still there. He drives me around to see the family lands.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: This is in the early 50s?",
        "A: 1951. I should have gone in \u201950, didn\u2019t go because of the breakout of the Korean\nwar. Drive around in the ancient family Lancia, which still exists. He\u2019s driving,\nI\u2019m sitting in what would be the driver\u2019s seat, because snobbery among Italians,\nyou have the driver on the English side, to copy English cars, although you\u2019re\ndriving \u2014 so, madness. So I\u2019m there, you know, thinking I\u2019m driving, as we go\nsweeping down. A little religious procession comes along, and they see the family\nLancia. They all pull to one side, and bow. I\u2019m a teenager. Who are these people\nbowing to me? We go by a church, and I say, that\u2019s a very beautiful church, and \u2014\nlittle tiny church \u2014 and the chauffeur says yes, you own it. Well, your cousin owns\nit. And the bell is even more beautiful, and of course, it\u2019s in Ferrara because it\u2019s\ntoo beautiful to leave out here. I can\u2019t take that. So we say to my parents, we want\nto stay. And that\u2019s what makes the decision.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "A: We stay. Because they were undecided, I mean, they really, essentially, left it up\nto us. The irony of this, of course, is that we did not see the great inequalities in the\nUnited States. Remember, blacks were not visible. It\u2019s before 1953, before Brown\nvs Board of Education. All the inequalities of the United States are kind of hidden\nto kids just growing up in a university town. In the meantime \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "Q: But it\u2019s just over the horizon.",
        "A: Just over the horizon. In the meantime, in Italy, 1950, partly due to my great-\nuncle going to the cabinet and becoming Minister of the Treasury [indecipherable]\nthe great Italian miracle of the 50s and 60s, which changes Italy into an almost\ntotally middle class society. Today, all these land are owned by farmers. The\nchurch is a little museum owned by there, the bell is back there. We own nothing of\nthat. We\u2019re still well-off, but not the kind of feudal thing \u2014 in many ways, by 1970,\nItaly is a much more egalitarian society than is the United States. In some ways\nnot, less mobility, but in many ways. So that the irony of our decision was that we\nwere moved by very good things. Whether it the right one or not \u2014",
        "Q: Or whether it was, in the end, what eventually happened \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: \u2014 in reality or not. You know, it was \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, just say it, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 the \u2014 one of the leitmotifs through your story is irony, and contradiction.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: You know, this is true, but this also is true.",
        "A: And here is \u2014 and here 1s another contradiction.",
        "Q: Okay.July 27, 2017",
        "A: That the result of that is that my brother marries a woman who was a classmate\nof mine in elementary school, of an old, old, old New Haven family. I marry Anne,\nwhose ancestors were the first governor of the first \u2014 and Eli Yale\u2019s grandmother.\nThe founders of New Haven, and are wonderful, wonderful people, whom we\nwould not have married, if we\u2019d gone back. And if \u2014 our bridal rehearsal luncheon\nthat my parents gave, my father gets up and shocks everybody by giving a toast to\nBenito Mussolini, because if it were not for him, and all his evil, Paul would not\nhave married Celia, and Guido would not be marrying Anne.",
        "Q: Oh, oh.",
        "A: Again, the ironies \u2014",
        "Q: Irony.",
        "A: \u2014 and contradictions of \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, let\u2019s go back to what ends up being yet another one. Now that you\nhave said, you and your brother, decided separately that you would rather be here,\nthe egalitarian ethos had caught you. You \u2014",
        "A: And as outsiders.",
        "Q: Yes, and as outsiders.",
        "A: Because that\u2019s another important point of our coming to America, and what that\nmeant.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: The \u2014 your first days, and first experiences in the United States, were not that\nauspicious.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So I would like to learn about that.",
        "A: Yeah. First, let me just say one thing, because I want it on the record yet again, I\ndo this, somebody said that we came through Ellis Island. I don\u2019t know where they\ngot that idea.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They made it up. They assumed it, and it sounds nice. I wish I\u2019d come through\nEllis Island. It was there. We did not come through Ellis Island. You went to Ellis\nIsland if you came steerage.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: If you came \u2014",
        "Q: On this fancy ship.",
        "A: \u2014 on this fancy ship in fancy things \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 you did not. We land in New York \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.July 27, 2017",
        "A: \u2014 on September 16, a Saturday. And by the way, I was sworn in as a judge on\nthe 55\" anniversary, to the day.",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",
        "A: I picked the day because I wanted to say something about what America had\ndone for me, and what it hadn't done for others, and those who had helped us, and\nthose who had not, and to dedicate myself to do things for those whom America\nhad not helped. And David Souter, who 1s an old, old friend, cause we were on\nRhodes Scholarship selection committee before anybody knew who he was, who\nswore me in. This old, New Hampshire Yankee was in tears. So, we land, and\nwhat do you do? Well, from the ship, my father had \u2014 Mother had sent a telegram\nto a distant cousin, who was the only relative that we had here, who had been sent\nby the fascists to study law at Berkeley.",
        "Q: Now, was he a fascist, too?",
        "A: No, he was just a kid. The reason he had been sent there was that the fascists\nhad sent a variety of people who were tall and good looking, because they didn\u2019t\nwant Americans to think of Italians as being short, squat southerners. So they sent\nthis very elegant \u2014 and as he said, shortly after he got here, they decided I wasn\u2019t\nItalian, because I was Jewish.",
        "Q: What was his name?July 27, 2017",
        "A: Paolo Contini.",
        "Q: Of the Finzi-Continis.",
        "A: He was a distant Finzi-Contini relative, but a somewhat closer Minerbi\nrelative.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: In some \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 complicated \u2014 his \u2014 Finzi-Contini said that from the first wife of Leon Vita,\nhis grandmoth \u2014 his mother and my grandmother Minerbi were first cousins, so\nthat that was the connection. And he was studying law at Berkeley. Having been\nsent there, he wasn\u2019t about to come back.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s on the other coast.",
        "A: And he stayed, and ultimately became deputy general counsel of the U.N., and\ndid other things. Ultimately died in a mountain climbing accident. A remarkable\nman. His daughter is a professor at UVA, and \u2014",

        "A: You were right, we have no money.",
        "Q: All you had is trunks with the clothes.",

        "Q: New York City.",
        "A: In New York City. We land on a Saturday, go there. How cheap was it? My\nfather, who is not a pack rat, kept the bill for four people and supposed food, for\neach of two months \u2014 kept it for two months because he had two sons. Obviously\nhe was doing it for a purpose, 10 dollars.",
        "Q: Ten dollars a month?",

        "A: Food supposedly included.",
        "Q: Okay.July 27, 2017",
        "A: I say supposedly because the food was awful, I found it almost impossible to\neat, because I\u2019d always eaten very [indecipherable]. I was difficult. Not difficult,\nbut you know, I was used to being \u2014 why do we stay in New York rather than\ncome to New Haven immediately? The fellowship doesn\u2019t begin til January, and\nmy father, correctly, thinks the licensure exams for medicine, in New York, have\nmore reciprocity than those of Connecticut. If you pass Connecticut, yeah,\nConnecticut will recognize it, but almost none \u2014 almost every state recognizes a\nNew York medical license. If we\u2019re going to starve, we might as well starve in\nNew York, as in \u2014",
        "Q: Was it as difficult in those days for a doctor, certified by another country?",
        "A: You had to \u2014 I mean, you could, with the qualifications he had, take the exams,\nand if you passed the exams, you would be okay. Increasingly they made it\ndifficult. Increasingly they made it difficult. And interestingly, the exams in New\nYork were already making it difficult for people primarily who came from\nGermany, and they did that by having the language, have all sorts of words which\nwere Latinate words. Which of course, my father, who spoke German perfectly,\nand spoke English with a huge accent \u2014 German was his first lang \u2014 second\nlanguage, French was his third language, English he learned and knew well, but\nspoke like a cultivated Italian would, if you thought it should sound like German.July 27, 2017\nWhich was not good. My mother, instead, spoke English with an English accent,\nFrench was her second language, English her third language, because she had had\nan English governess. Have you any autumn apples? When she came, it was how\nshe spoke. But he found the language exam funnily easy, because of that. The other\nexams, what he worried about most was surgery. He had been an academic, so that\nmost other things to do with medicine, even if they weren\u2019t his field, he would\nknow. And as he said, he turned lucky in that, because the guy who was the\nexaminer in surgery, was one of the first people to do color \u2014 cardiovascular\nsurgery, to think about that. And he had read some articles of my father\u2019s as a\ncardiologist, and so knew who he was. And he said to him, I must give you a real\nsurgical question. It was an appendectomy, which even my father could handle.\nAnd then he said, now let\u2019s talk about interesting things, the future of\ncardiovascular surgery. So he passed that. And so he passed, flying colors, before\nthe end of December, so that in January, when we came to New Haven, he had his\nNew York license.",

And a \u2014 there\u2019s some count or somebody there, who has heart trouble, and\nasks my father if he will look after him. My father says, I cannot do it for pay,\nbecause I\u2019m not licensed. You know, I can give you some advice. And there\narrived, at this scruffy hotel, every day, a huge thing of flowers. My mother \u2014 I\nremember her saying, he might have sent fruit.

And his wife had been \u2014 who I think was\nJewish, I don\u2019t know, was Morgan\u2019s \u2014 he probably \u2014 could not very well have\nbeen, at that time. But he \u2014 she had signed affidavits for all sorts of people from\nGermany. And when, because of the connection between one of my grandparents\nand this guy, signed ours, saying, I know you'll never need anything. So, my\nmother goes to call on this lady, and she had jewelry, because we\u2019d hidden it in our\nthings. And this was not jewelry we had bought; if so they would have looked for\nit, but this was jewelry, so she \u2014 she said, I put on more jewelry than a lady should,\nand went to have tea, for \u2014 and said, our money has not yet arrived from\nSwitzerland, could you advance us something? This was technically true because\nmy father had given a lecture in Switzerland, and had gotten, I don\u2019t know, 50\ndollars, something like that, and that money had not yet arrived. So it had my \u2014 this\nwoman says, of course, and writes a check. I do not know the precise amount. TheJuly 27, 2017\nstory sort of is, and I had an impression that it was for 25,000 dollars. This is 1939.\nShe\u2019s thinking of people living in the way we lived in Italy. So of course. What do\nyou do with a check for 25,000 dollars at a time when you think the banks are still\nfailing? You know, it\u2019s true now we look back, the depression was over, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 nobody really knew it. We had no bank account anyway, but how could you \u2014\nsomething which we could never pay back. What do you do with it? Well, what\nyou do with it, there were a few other Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, some Jewish, some not, who\nwere there in New York, that was a small community of people, and some of them\nhad a little bit of money, because they had had money out of Italy.

        "Q: Nervous.",
        "A: \u2014 tight with it as could be. Among these people, by the way, was a woman\nnamed Kalabi(ph), who became, after the war, the head of the Italian Jewish\ncommunity in Italy. A great, great lady. A-And she was our first babysitter. She\ncame and \u2014 one time when my parents actually went to a movie, it was the only\ntime, and she was with us. Well, my parents gave this check to some people who\nhad money and said, give us a few hundred dollars, this check will be your security.\nAnd with these few hundred dollars, we had barely enough money to live.

        "A: He is lucky, because this rinky-dink school had a class for non-English speaking\nchildren.

And our three year old, who was very durable, runs up to\nsome little children who were playing, and I kind of follow in the back, to see\nwhat\u2019s going on, to two little girls who are playing, and says something in English.July 27, 2017\nAnd they don\u2019t understand, and pick up their things, and go away. And I don\u2019t\nknow that Bianca was particularly upset. I mean, she moved down to something\nelse, was just I raced back to the house, and realized how I was reliving a difficult\nkind of experience. One introduction to America, we get brought to this school,\nand teachers in Italy, no matter, you know, how old or young, always wore black,\nvery \u2014 very simple kind of thing. We arrive at this school, and my kindergarten\nteacher is a big, blousy New Yorker, with all sorts of colored \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 [indecipherable] and things. And I later learned that my mother came back\nand said to my father, I don\u2019t really understand this country, but I\u2019m afraid that\nGuido\u2019s teacher may be a prostitute. Culture is different. So we \u2014 I \u2014 I am there,\nand \u2014 and then, how do I \u2014 what do I eat?

        "A: \u2014 10 dollar a month thing, we discover the automats. Which were these\nwonderful 1930 things, all chrome and shiny and things and you put in 10 cents,\nand you got something. And this was fun for kids. And I discover chicken pot pie,\nwhich I thought was edible. And I survive on chicken pot pie and the nickel and the\nwonderful thing of it. And my parents, bless them, are \u2014 understand, you know, theJuly 27, 2017\nneeds, and I\u2019ll show you how much they did. My brother comes home \u2014 we arrive\nwearing little tweed coats, fur coats. Winter things in Italy, and we thought of\nAmerica that way, so you know, nicely, wonderfully elegant. My brother comes\nhome and says, I cannot wear this. My mother said \u2014 no one is wearing it, just, I\ncannot wear anything like this. My mother says, okay. With no money that we\nhave, she understands that this child is \u2014 and so we go to some five and dime\nsomeplace, to look for something. And she looks at all sorts of parka and things,\nshe said, they\u2019re all wearing parkas. And the \u2014 whatever, and we look, which fairly\ncostly, and good looking. And he said no, no, no, no. And he then sees something\nwhich is a quite ugly, black and green kind of pressed something or other thing,\nwhich is very cheap, and he says, that\u2019s what everybody\u2019s wearing. And my mother\nsays, okay, and buys it for him. Turns to me and says, do you want one? And I said,\nnot on your life. I mean, I\u2019m not fitting in \u2014",

He \u2014 he\njust made my life. But he did fit in more. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t, and I learned English there\nand at home from my mother, which is why I had the slight accent.",

        "Q: I wanted to ask this question before I forgot. How old were your parents in\n1939, when you arrived?",
        "A: My father was born in 1903, he was 36.",
        "Q: So he was relatively young.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: And my mother was a year older.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Thirty-seven.",
        "Q: Okay.July 27, 2017",
        "A: And my father, by the way, had \u2014 and this became a problem \u2014 he had been an\nassociate professor. In 1936, very, very young for Italian, he had written a book on\ncardiology, one of the founding books on ki\u2014 electroca-cardiographs, and things,\nwhich had won the gold medal for the best scientific book of the year. And there\nwas a competition for a full professorship. His chief was part of the commission,\nand had the other two votes, the commissioners, five, to put him in. But said, I\u2019m\ngoing to be here next year as well, with the same committee, and there\u2019s somebody\nsenior to you. If I put you in this year, this other guy will never make it. Will \u2014 do\nyou mind being put off for a year? My father said, of course not. The next year the\nfascists were strong enough so that they could block it. Whether it was that he\nwouldn\u2019t take a loyalty oath, or something, I don\u2019t know. But the next year, when\nhe should have gone through, he didn\u2019t. With the result that we came before he be \u2014\nwas a tenured, full professor.",
        "Q: Would that have made a difference?",
        "A: That would have made maybe some difference here. It certainly would have\nmade a difference after the war, in terms of Italy. But it certainly made life more\ndifficult, because he didn\u2019t have a title. And, you know, when I was offered,\nextremely young, a full professorship at Chicago, in my first year of teaching, and\ndecided to turn it down, because I wanted to stay at Yale, well they couldn\u2019t\nJuly 27, 2017\npromote me immediately, I told the dean, I know it\u2019s all right, but you must\nunderstand that psychologically it\u2019s more difficult for me. And he did some\nwonderful things about comforting me in this. And then I became a full professor\nin a year or two later, very, very young still, but it was part of, again \u2014",
        "Q: Well, it was \u2014 it was part of \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of the history.",
        "Q: Yeah, of the history.",
        "A: Yeah, part of that. So, in January, we come to New Haven, to be \u2014 for this\nfellowship. Now first \u2014 I didn\u2019t know it at the time, and my parents never told me,\nbut recently, a dean of a medical school found the letter from the head of the\ninternal medicine, to my father, telling him his fellowship was there, and he could\ncome on such and such a time, and what it was. And sent me this letter. A copy of\nthis letter.",
        "Q: When you say recently, in the past few years or so?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: When you say recently, do you mean in the past few years?",
        "A: Yeah, about three, four years ago.",
        "Q: Okay.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Well, now maybe \u2014 you know, could now be 10. But was at some point a dean\nfound it in the files and sent it to me, but just \u2014",
        "Q: Decades after the event.",
        "A: \u2014 decades \u2014 decades after. It\u2019s the most insulting letter you can imagine.",
        "Q: What did it say?",
        "A: It said, somebody has given us money to give you a fellowship, and so we\u2019re\ndoing it. Try to get them to give us more money. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll be able to\nstay more than this time, and don\u2019t think you can do this, this, this or this. You\u2019ve\nbeen given this fellowship, we\u2019ve been given the money, but essentially said, we\ndon\u2019t really like people like you.",
        "Q: So the welcome mat was really put out.",
        "A: Yeah. Understand that this was a Yale that at this time had never had either a\nCatholic or a Jewish full professor in Yale college. It wasn\u2019t until 1946 that Yale\nhad a Catholic or full professor \u2014 or Jewish full professor in Yale college. Harvard\nwasn\u2019t much before that, it was when Conant became president, which is one of\nthe reasons Harvard got so far ahead of Yale, because Conant became president\nbefore the war, and so all the refugees could go to Harvard. Schumpeter, the\ngreat economist, wanted to come to Yale, but couldn\u2019t, had to go to Harvard. HeJuly 27, 2017\nhad many friends among the economists at Yale, but this was Yale college. The\nlaw school was different, and had been different forever \u2014",
        "Q: At Yale.",
        "A: \u2014 to its glory. At Yale. It had a Jewish full professors, Catholic professors,\nCatholic acting dean, in the 19\" century admitted women. The law school was\nalways the troublemaker, which is why I love it, and always different. The medical\nschool, slightly different. The dean of the medical school, Winternitz, was Jewish.\nSome said very anti-Semitic, but he was Jewish. There were some Jews on the\nfaculty. Still an enormous quota, I mean, you know. The first person in the class\nwas always Jewish, because to be Jewish, to be admitted to the medical school, you\nhad to be \u2014 but \u2014 but at least it was mildly open, but \u2014 but just barely, in the\nmedical school. And apart from the dean, I don\u2019t know that there were any full\nprofessors who were Jewish, but anyway.",
        "Q: Is this where your father was attached?",
        "A: This was where my father was attached, the fellowship was to the medical\nschool. The person he was working with, Arthur Geiger, who was in cardiology,\nwas Jewish, was not a full professor, was an associate professor. But \u2014 so it\u2019s not\nsurprising that this letter, that a previous president of Yale, who had just left a few\nyears before, James Rowland Angell, was a fascist and worse. I mean, he actually\nJuly 27, 2017\nwrote a letter saying, if there could be something like what happened to the\nArmenians in New Haven and Bridgeport, we might be able to save our Nordic\nheritage. This was not uncommon, with Lowell at Harvard, and Butler at\nColumbia. You know, it was the way people thought at that time. So I say, the law\nschool was different, we had nothing to do with the medical school, was slightly\ndifferent, and so on. That\u2019s where my father, because a fellowship had \u2014 money\nhad been given to them, and maybe the Dazien(ph) foundation was doing this\nbecause they wanted to open it. Who knows why they gave it here. But \u2014 so, we\narrive. And the real estate agent comes to try to find us a place to rent, a little house\nto rent, and immediately shows us places on Worcester square, which was where\nthe Italians lived, or in Westville, where the Jews lived. And we get shown places\nthere, and the people from the medical school kind of sweep in, and say no. What\nthey essentially said, you are ethnically Yale.",
        "Q: There\u2019s a new ethnicity, it\u2019s called Yale?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t ethnic, I mean, you live between Whitney Avenue and Orange Street,\nbetween the park and Edward Street, because that\u2019s where all the fellows, assistant\nprofessors, young Yale faculty live. And so they found us a nice little house, still\nthere, in that area. An area, by the way, which is still today full of Yale fellows,\nassistant professors and so on. Now, ethnically of every ethnicity, but still remainsJuly 27, 2017\nthe place \u2014 the full professors lived across the street in bigger houses, or here or\nthere. But that was the area where young faculty members lived. Which 1s perfectly\nfine [indecipherable] they said, you know, this is what you are. Now imagine we\narrive there, everybody who is there, is a WASP. We have in common with them\nthat they are faculty and academic, but ethnically, culturally, extraordinarily little.",
        "Q: Well, you know, one of the \u2014",
        "A: And, if you look then to the Jewish community, we had almost nothing to do\nwith people who were wonderful, mainly Ashkenazim. Couldn\u2019t believe that we\nwere Jewish, that my father, particularly the \u2014 he took, when he would see them,\nthe medical school and so on, as patients, to speaking to them in German, because\nthen they thought, oh then maybe this person sp \u2014 speaks an odd dialect of Yiddish.\nTo convince them that actually \u2014 you know, because \u2014 and the Italian community,\nalmost all southern; very, very poor.",
        "Q: Southern Italy.",
        "A: Southern Italy. A-Again, very little to do with this. Now, with one odd\nexception. There were a few left wing anti-fascists who had been ostracized by the\ncommunity because the fascists had played very much this \u2014 you must be more\nfascist than the fascists if you\u2019re here and so on. And these people, when they heardJuly 27, 2017\nthat my father had arrived, knowing about him and his anti-fascism, were so\nthrilled at having somebody who was a \u2014",
        "Q: Kindred spirit.",
        "A: \u2014 and a kindred spirit and cultivated, that several of them made him executor of\ntheir wills, even though he was a doctor and knew nothing about law. And there\nwas a barber named Malefronte(ph). I \u2014 I remember, I just met somebody who was\nthe granddaughter of this barber\u2019s partner, and said, you know, I think that \u2014 so it \u2014\nand my parents got very much involved in the doing things for the Italian\ncommunity. But we were part of, in a way, nothing. My mother became the first\nItalian member ever, of something called the Cerco Il\u2019Italiano, which was a group\nof elderly Yankee women who read Dante and other things. But they\u2019d never had\nan Italian having \u2014 for friend, that they should.",
        "Q: I want to make a comment here, is that \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: I want to make a comment, because that was \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s one of the changes, or \u2014\nyou come from a family that has been integrated in Italy for two millennia. People\nknow who you are. You know who you are, because you can trace it from the\nslaves \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: \u2014 who came from Titus, you know? And y \u2014 when you say your name in Italy,\npeople have a sense of who 1s this person.",
        "A: Immediately. Immediately.",
        "Q: And you come to this world \u2014",
        "A: Even \u2014 even before the garden, or before anything. I mean, they all know who\nwe are.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We are who we are. We arrive here and we are outsiders, unknown, and \u2014",
        "Q: Without any mooring, in some ways.",
        "A: \u2014 without any mooring, and \u2014",
        "Q: How does this affect your family? How does it affect your \u2014 the older \u2014 your\nparents, and then you and your \u2014",
        "A: In\u20141in an odd way, we \u2014 we know we are outsiders, and that we are ourselves,\nand that we will take the best that there is, and give the best that we can, to all of\nthese, but we don\u2019t belong.",
        "Q: You know you don\u2019t belong.",
        "A: We don\u2019t belong. And that\u2019s one of the things, when I said why we don\u2019t go\nback. Somehow my brother and I know we are outsiders, and kind of relish it.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: So, in other words, when you would be going back to Italy, you would be\nbelonging again.",
        "A: We would belonging. We\u2019d immediately fit in. When I studied in England, the\nend of two years, they offered me a fellowship, which would have been the end of a\ncareer, having a fellowship at Magdalen College, that\u2019s it, 1n economics, perfect. I\ndidn\u2019t want to take that, problems with economics, but partly because I would\nimmediately fit in a category of society, and \u2014 there, and I said, if I wanted to fit\nsomewhere, I\u2019d go back to Italy, you know? There, the moment I\u2019m there, Anne\nsays I melt into the woodwork when I go over.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. I mean, it just is. 1am. Everybody knows who I am. In an odd kind of way,\nit\u2019s a small country. Everybody knows. When we went to Rome on sabbatical, we\nwent to Rome because there weren\u2019t many \u2014 my great-aunt and great-uncle were\nthere, but they were much older, and we wanted to make our own friends, and so\non. We made friends, and we found, inevitably, that the people we liked were\npeople whose grandparents were on the same side of this fight or that with my\ngrandparents, and you know, it \u2014 it\u2019s that kind of a country. Well here, we were\nnothing.",
        "Q: Well, this is an experie \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "A: And one \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m interrupting, but I want to make another point with this. Is\nthis is often the experience of the exile. You know, sort of like the 20\" century\nphenomena, the 20\" century experience \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: \u2014 of someone who was somebody.",
        "A: And now \u2014",
        "Q: They\u2019re nobody.",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and there\u2019s some funny things about this. When my brother\nmarried Celia, who as I say, was my classmate in elementary school, because I\nwon a fellow \u2014 a scholarship to a little private school here, and she was in that\nclass. My then college roommate, who was from New Haven, and so on, said, oh, I\nam so \u2014 my parents are so glad. And I said, why would they care? I mean, what\nthey \u2014 and he said, because people ask them who your roommate is at Yale, and \u2014\nwe had three roommates \u2014 and I \u2014 and I tell them, somebody named Guido\nCalabresi, and my parents\u2019 friends, business types, said, who are they? And now\nmy parents can say, oh, he is married to these people. So, to them, this was a way\nof saying, there is now \u2014",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re somebody.July 27, 2017",
        "A: He\u2019s somebody. And now, I don\u2019t know the extent to which both my brother\nand I \u2014 and maybe my parents, but my brother and I, have wanted, unconsciously to\nrebuild here, what we had there. Somebody has seen the farm where I live, which is\nvery beautiful, which we got \u2014",
        "Q: Here, in \u2014 in Connecticut.",
        "A: \u2014 somewhere here, in Woodbridge, yeah. And \u2014 and it\u2019s a beautiful place. We\ngot it for almost nothing when we were first married, but it was \u2014 it\u2019s a huge\nnumber \u2014 amount of land, and an 18\" century house, and it\u2019s been made \u2014 we\u2019ve\nworked at it, and it\u2019s really beautiful. And somebody who was studying at the law\nschool, who 1s a writer, wrote a book in which he said, this house, which looks like\na villa in Tuscany. And I said to him, you\u2019re right and you\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s not in\nTuscany, and it\u2019s outside of Bologna. But it\u2019s, in a way it\u2019s rebuilding my\ngrandparents\u2019 villa outside there. So there is some side of people like me, who must\nrebuild and reestablish, so that now, you know, I\u2019m an outsider in some ways, and\nyet, people know me and our children and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you still feel an outsider?",
        "A: Yes. And in some ways, I really still am. It\u2019s a funny business. I teach a course\nwith a judge on our court, who is a good friend, who was chief judge. He\u2019s younger\nthan I am, and I teach a seminar with him. His name is John Walker. He is H.W.\n113July 27, 2017\nBush\u2019s first cousin. And he is as much an insider as you can imagine in that \u2014 some\nways in his legal career and so on. And \u2014 and says that every once in a while I do\nthings which puzzle this guy.",
        "Q: He says that to you?",
        "A: No, I mean Anne, my wife \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, your Anne, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 says that, and it\u2019s clear that they puzzle him, because they are not what a\nYankee American would do. He\u2019s come to see us in Italy, and when he\u2019s come to\nsee us, he now understands far more. When he, every once in a while, he does act \u2014\nhe\u2019s a nice man, a friend, but he does act as if who \u2014 what is this guy doing? And at\nthat point my wife, who is even more old, old, old, old Yankee than he 1s, kind of\nlooks at him, to say, you keep your place, youngster. But it is \u2014 it is there, and I\nthink it is one of the things that has made me both useful and successful and open.",
        "Q: So the kind of outsider that you\u2019re mentioning, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s far more subtle than\ndiscrimination. It is \u2014",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s a much deeper thing.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s a much deeper thing. I mean, discrimination, were there some? Yes, of\ncourse, there were. And it\u2019s kind of interesting to see. I got \u2014 we went to the publicJuly 27, 2017\nschool that was right there, and it was a public school which then, as now,\nprimarily have broader things, but have many, many children of young Yale,\nbecause of where it was. And \u2014 and the local Boy Scout troop is the same way, you\nknow, all these things were this \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 little kind of Yale WASP centered thing. At some point, the Foote school,\nwhich was a wonderful private school, made really wonderful by the fact \u2014 by one\nfact of discrimination, that Yale had no women teachers, so that many of the\nteachers in this little private school were the wives of professors, and immensely\nlearned, and interesting and so on. You know, you had a level of teachers that was\nfantastic. In seventh grade, I get a scholarship there. My parents are uncertain about\nprivate schools, because in Italy private schools were \u2014 but the fact that it was an\nall day, and anyway, the headmistress, who was English, and who was a wonderful\nlady, told them, this really is better level of education and so on. Why did I get that\nfellowship \u2014 that scholarship. Affirmative action, but not because I was Jewish, not\nbecause I was Catholic, not because I was Italian, even though I probably was\nabout the only person, maybe one or two others \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.July 27, 2017",
        "A: \u2014 of that. Was because I was a boy, and in seventh grade, enough boys went off\nto prep school away, that they needed boys, and so they looked to this public\nschool, and here was this kid. Because, when I came to New Haven, I went back to\nsecond grade, I was doing things back at the level, and clearly they \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and so that\u2019s why I got the scholarship. I was there, in this school, which was\nall the really major professors. A classmate of mine was Sally Griswold, the\ndaughter of a guy who became president of Yale, and we became, you know, very\nclose friends. This was the whole entourage there, and lawyers, great lawyers, and\nso on. My wife was two years behind me in school. And so, what happens? In those\ndays, when you get to high school, the mothers of daughters would have dances at\nChristmastime, at vacation time, to which proper, eligible people \u2014 boys \u2014 would be\ninvited. It was just the way it was, you know, you \u2014 a-and they\u2019d have dances in\ntheir homes, and things. It\u2019s kind of interesting, some invited me, and some did not.\nAs it happened, my wife\u2019s family invited me, because they were people who were\nnot bigots, and they were friends of the guy who became president of Yale, and\nwhose daughter was my friend, and of Gene Rostow, who became the first \u2014 not\nthe first Jewish dean, but a Jewish dean of the law school. And \u2014 you know, they\nknew, and they knew, in a way, who we were. There were people who were very\n116July 27, 2017\nopen, and people who were less so. I can\u2019t say I really noticed or cared, because\nour attitude, in a way, was very snobbish.",
        "Q: Your own in turn \u2014",
        "A: My family.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean, you know, we thought, we were who we were when you people\nwere painting yourselves blue.",
        "Q: Well, you know, there\u2019s some truth to that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and there\u2019s also \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 and so but, in a way, we were \u2014 an-and the fact that we didn\u2019t belong,\nmeant that we would be friends with everybody, but in some ways we also thought\nthat we were outsiders because we were better than everybody. Which isn\u2019t nice.\nBut it is part of, at the same time, a feeling that we had to achieve, because if\nanything happened to my father and mother, there we were, at least until after the\nwar, and not immediately after the war, but when things started getting put back\ntogether again.",
        "Q: I want to dwell on this a little bit before it\u2019s \u2014 sort of like psychology. In some\nways also, I \u2014 I \u2014I take your point where you\u2019re saying that, you know, we thoughtJuly 27, 2017\nwe were a little bit better than others. You have a certainly illustrious family\nhistory, that can be very convincing to \u2014 to feed that. At the same time, when\nyou\u2019re in the position of an exile and a refugee \u2014",
        "A: And you feel both \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 too many other people didn\u2019t have those reserves and suffered enormously,\ninternally \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 because they didn\u2019t have \u2014 they felt like they no longer mattered in the world.",
        "A: But it \u2014 it \u2014 and you know, the odd thing is, if you are that way, you \u2014 it really\ndoesn\u2019t matter. I mean, we had a \u2014 my parents had a very, very hard time making it\nhere. Ultimately they did. Ultimately my father became a full professor. Ultimately\nthey were recognized in their fields, but they had a very, very hard time. And I\nsometimes thought we were outsiders and felt like this, because they were having a\nhard time. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, and my example of that is Hanna Gray, who\nbecame president \u2014 provost at Yale, president of Chicago. Was a couple of years\nahead of me, at this same school. Oh, by the way, this English headmistress was\ndelighted that she had people who were Italian Jewish, and so on, because she was\nsomebody who wanted that, and so on. When Hanna was provost, and we were\nfriends, because of \u2014 they were at dinner \u2014 lunch at our house once, and I said \u2014 we\nJuly 27, 2017\nwere talking about the experience coming, and I said, but of course, 1t was very\ndifferent for you, because her mother was Jewish, her father was a great German\nhistorian, whose chair at Heidelberg was paid for by the Rockefeller, had been\ngiven by the Rockefeller in 1930s. Because his wife was Jewish, they decided to\nleave, and Rockefeller found \u2014 whether it was the Rockefellers or a foundation,\nsaid to American universities, whichever one of you wants [indecipherable] Hajo\nHolborn was his name, we will give the chair \u2014 move the chair there. And he\nwasn\u2019t Jewish, so Yale was perfectly willing to have him an-and it was a great,\ngreat story, and so the chair was here, and the \u2014 and so I said to Hanna, I expect\nyour experience was very different from ours, because you came, and your father\nwas a full professor already, with his chair and that, so on, and \u2014 and she looked at\nme, and she said, you\u2019re absolutely wrong. And she described her feelings, and her\nfamily\u2019s feelings of being outsiders, 1n exactly the same way. Because it was that\njust this sense of there you were somebody, here you are nobody. And this is \u2014 it\u2019s\nodd. Bob Dahl, the great political scientist, wrote a book called \u201cWho Governs?\u201d\nin which one of the things that he does, is talk about who are the social elite, the\npolitical elite, the financial elite, the academic elite in a town. And in New Haven,\nhe defines these in good political scientist terms [indecipherable]. Financial elite,\nanybody who is on the board of directors of any one of different companies.July 27, 2017\nPolitical elite, anybody who is [indecipherable] certain positions, selectman, or\nwhatever, or selectmen in towns and \u2014 and things of that sort. Fine \u2014 social elite,\nanybody who goes to what used to be the debutante ball in New Haven, a big\ndance. And academic elite, anybody who\u2019s full professor. Finds only one person\nwho is all four. Me. The outsider. Nice irony. Why all four? Well, academic elite,\neasy. Political elite, at some point the town of Woodbridge wants to ask me to run\nas a \u2014 for selectman. Democrats don\u2019t win, but there is minority representation, you\nhave to have a certain number of things. I\u2019m not particularly interested, I\u2019m saying\nI\u2019m in Europe on sabbatical, but if you put my name down, they need a name.\nThere are Italian Americans living in Woodbridge who always vote republic,\nbecause the Irish are democratic. They know an Italian name, vote for it. Why\ndidn\u2019t the democrats do that before? Because if you do that, all the Yale people,\nand the Jewish psychiatrists and so on, wouldn\u2019t vote for that one. For me, of\ncourse, they all vote. So, easy, I somehow get elected and spend some years doing\nthat. Financial elite, they\u2019re looking for somebody, two parts of a bank are fighting\nwith each other. They\u2019 ve never had an Italian on the bank. Compromise, let\u2019s not\nfight, let\u2019s put somebody who\u2019s totally an outsider on the bank. So I end up being a\nbank director, because I was a full professor, young and Italian, ever looking for a\nbank. And social elite, yeah. All the people who get asked by girls who are coming\n120July 27, 2017\nout, to be their escorts, then get asked to this dance. And since my friends in school\nwere the ones who were \u2014 so \u2014 and yet I\u2019m an outsider in all of them.",
        "Q: And you still feel that, that\u2019s the key thing \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 is that you still feel that.",
        "A: Yes. And when my son, our children were growing up, at some point I was\nsaying to Massimo, our youngest, how his older sisters, who seem to be so\nsuccessful, and this was this younger kid, and the first \u2014 the only guy with these\ntwo very powerful sisters. And so I said to him, you know, they \u2014 that, you have\ninsecurities, but realize that your sisters each have insecurities, and I started talking\nabout their insecurities, and he understood. And then, being a bright little boy, he\nturned to me, and he said, and what are your insecurities, Daddy? And I\nimmediately said, I\u2019m a refugee. I\u2019m a refugee. I\u2019m an outsider. And I \u2014 by the\nway, I say being a refugee is the most important part of my legal education,\nbecause it shows me what it means to be an outsider, which is very important if\nyou\u2019re gonna be a lawyer and a judge. Say, I\u2019m a refugee. And he immediately\nsays, of course, of course. And so is Uncle Paul, only he deals with it in a different\nway from you.",
        "Q: What a smart boy.\n121\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How old was he?",
        "A: But he\u2019s so \u2014 he must have been 13 \u2014 12, 13.",
        "Q: But truly a smart \u2014 you know, very insightful.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But he saw when I said that, that of course, there are all sorts\nof things that I still feel outside, and so did Paul, but that we dealt with it in\ndifferent ways [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Well, you know, of all the things we\u2019ve talked about, the identities; born Jewish,\nbaptized, and now a practicing Catholic. Italian, refugee, outsider. Which of them\nhas predominance?",
        "A: Different ones at different times, you know? In an odd way, I have both felt\nbeing outsider because of each of these \u2014",
        "Q: Easily.",
        "A: \u2014 at different times.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And also, I have used each of these. For instance, when I was dean, to reach out\nto different groups, because I saw my parents, though they had nothing directly in\ncommon, reaching out to help people in the Jewish community, help people in the\nItalian community. My mother was a Knight of the Italian Republic after the war,July 27, 2017\nfor all she had done for Italian Americans here. Reaching out to the academic\ncommunity, reaching out to all of these, and giving to them of that, so that you feel\nboth apart and outside, but a duty to do something for [indecipherable]. It helped,\nyou know. When I was dean, there were all sorts of people who are Italian\nAmericans, who are Jews, who are this, who are that, who are the other. And they\u2019d\nsee a dean who was also that.",
        "Q: And so they \u2014 like many black girls now say.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And why Obama was so important to the black community. If he can, so can I.",
        "A: There\u2019s a \u2014 there\u2019s a man, Iacobucci, who became a justice of the Canadian\nsupreme court, dean of the law school at Toronto, and acting president of the\nUniversity of Toronto. The first time I met him, he said to me, Guido, you don\u2019t\nknow how much you meant to me. I said, why? And he said, I was a young kid at\nthe univer \u2014 at law school in Toronto, and I came home one day, I loved law, and I\nsaid to my parents, I want to be a [indecipherable]. And they said, you can\u2019t. And\nI said why? And he \u2014 his parent said, because you\u2019re an Italian and in Canada and\nToronto \u2014 then. Toronto is very different now, but then, you know, that can\u2019t be. I\ntook out of my pocket, an article in the \u201cNew York Times,\u201d how Guido Calabresi\nhad become the youngest full professor of the history of a Yale law school, and twoJuly 27, 2017\nor three youngest in the history of Yale. I said, if that can happen to an Italian at\nYale, it can happen here. So, you are, you know. If you know that all of these\nthings can be of use to others, you then relish every one of these feelings of being a",
        "Q: Of this identity, or that identity, or \u2014 what would you like us to understand about\nwhat it is to be a refugee? That is both historical a question, and I think very\ncurrently a question.",
        "A: The first thing is that every refugee is an outsider. And that\u2019s the fundamental\nthing. The second is that it has always been the case that there have been people\nwho helped, and I can tell you, and when I was sworn in, I n-named them by name.\nZiegler Sargent of the Sargent lock company, who went out of his way to help\nthese little Italian boys \u2014 became a \u2014 a very good friend of my parents, as a result.\nAnd there are people who stand in your way. And \u2014 but if you worry about the\npeople who stand in your way, you hurt yourself. But if you instead are grateful for\nthose who help, and then help others in your situation, that makes you something\nthat makes this country better. You \u2014",
        "Q: One \u2014 mm-hm? One of the things that you said about what your parents had\ndone, and I want to ask more questions about what some of their difficulties were,\nwas that they engaged. Very often when a refugee will come to a for \u2014 very often,\n124July 27, 2017\nwhen a refugee will come to a foreign country, they feel so strange and so much\nand outsider, and so \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 different, that they will close in on their own communities.",
        "A: Okay, this is very important, and it\u2019s a great piece of luck. Because of this\nfellowship at Yale, and because we were able to hang on and stay here, we were\nnot part of the Italian refugee community that was centered in New York. We\nknew them, or some, in Boston, a few different places, either of anti-fascists, or of\nJews. We knew them, we were a part of them, we had been with them. We would\nsee them from time to time, so that I went to call on the mother of the Rosselli\nbrothers, who had been \u2014 who was living \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 in Larchmonts(ph), because that, you know, we did, but \u2014 but we were not\npart of it, and so we did not close in, in the way such a community does. You s \u2014\nthose people almost all went back, remained something to themselves, because it\nwas much easier than dealing with this strange, American world. Because we were\nhere, and alone, we couldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019ve seen that in other ways. I have a law\nclerk, who is now dean of a law faculty at Cornell, named Eduardo Penalver,\nwhose family fled Cuba. His father did not want to stay either in Florida, or inJuly 27, 2017\nNew Jersey where the main Cuban \u2014 went to Washington State, doctor \u2014 that\nfamily \u2014 these people are brilliant, wonderful, have done all sorts of things. They\u2019re\nmuch more open, because they had to deal with the rest of the world, and weren\u2019t\nable to look in on themselves, and on their troubles, and on their grievances, which\nare real. As we could have, had we been part of that little New York community.\nSo that was something which I don\u2019t think my parents were especially aware. I\nthink they understood afterwards, that they were doing things which might be hard,\nbut that they were much more interesting than had they been part of that\ncommunity.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about how it was that your father was able to hang on after\nthat unwelcome letter.",
        "A: Yeah, so first, you know, you come to New Haven, you come to this little house\non Willow Street, which is still there. It was the old farmhouse for that area. Nice\nlittle house, wooden, very simple.",
        "Q: Different than Milan.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Different than Milan.",
        "A: Slightly different. They still had an icebox in those days, and a \u2014 the Hygienic\nIce Company brought the \u2014 a month or two after we are there \u2014 maybe just a\nJuly 27, 2017\nmonth, even, the wife of a distinguished professor comes to call on my mother,\nbecause in those days Yale was small enough so that new faculty member \u2014 and\nfellows were considered faculty members \u2014 gets called on by the wife \u2014 always the\nwife, because it was \u2014 the wife calls on the wife, the senior faculty member in some\nother department. I\u2019m home from school, and I\u2019m playing \u2014 sort of myself, cars or\nsomething, and my mother is giving this lady tea. And this lady asks her how she\nlikes America, and my mother says, oh, it\u2019s very nice. And then the person,\nlooking to make conversation says, and what do you think of the plumbing? I\nunderstand that she means, isn\u2019t 1t wonderful to have indoor plumbing, because she\nthinks of Italians as people who don\u2019t. My mother doesn\u2019t understand. She just\ndoesn\u2019t understand. Then, she thinks she understands, and she says, of course, it\u2019s\nvery simple \u2014 compared to a marble bathroom, the sort of thing which is absolutely\nnormal in Milan, and thing. But after all, what should one expect? And I can tell\nthat she\u2019s thinking, at least you don\u2019t have Indians firing at us. She\u2019s just as\nprovincial in her way as the other one is in a way. And I don\u2019t \u2014 I, instead, already\nunderstand what each one of them is [indecipherable] say.",
        "Q: Oh my God.",
        "A: Because I\u2019ve been 1n school, you know.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: This is sort of like when you speak English and you speak English, and you\nneed a translator in between.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And I never tell my mother this, because she would have been\nupset, because she didn\u2019t want to be \u2014 say something rude, but it was. Neither\nunderstood the other, and it was perfectly fine. So that\u2019s how we are as insider\noutsiders. My father is at the medical school, and has this extraordinarily dreadful\naccent, because of which it\u2019s very hard to understand him. He knows the language\nvery well, and he is hanging on by his fingernails.",
        "Q: Oh, poor man.",
        "A: He is a great \u2014 he\u2019s a great doctor as well as scientist. He never writes the kinds\nof things here, and does the kind of research here that he was doing in Italy, which,\nyou know, people said this was Nobel prize type of stuff. But never does that here.\nBut he comes to be loved by students because of what he does. But he is certainly\nnot \u2014 he\u2019s at the fringes, and not appreciated in any way at all. My mother \u2014 oh,\nthey decide that if you\u2019re going to \u2014 if we\u2019re going to stay here, it would be useful\nto have American degrees. So my father, because of the chairman of public health,\na wonderful man, c-a-o \u2014 C.O.A. Winslow, or something like that, liked him, saw\nthat he was special. And public health was kind of a hobby. Says to my father,\nlook, take a few courses, when you write an article about something and we\u2019 ll work\nJuly 27, 2017\nit out so you get a doctorate. And so my father gets a doctorate in public health,\nwith his left hand, thanks to this guy. It\u2019s only \u2014 remains only a hobby. My mother\ninstead, whose field in Italy was philosophy of art [indecipherable] is her\ndissertation, so decides to go to graduate school at Yale. She starts out teaching at\nwhat is now Southern Connecticut, it was Teacher\u2019s College at the time, to earn\nsome money while we\u2019re here. She gets fired in 1941, when America goes in the\nwar, because suddenly people decide \u2014 realize that you\u2019re supposed to be a citizen\nto teach in a state college. And everybody\u2019s desperate, but there\u2019s nothing to be\ndone about it. And anyway, she goes and she teaches \u2014 she decides that she\u2019s gonna\nget a degree in French, because a French \u2014 German-French department, Henri\nPeyre, was a brilliant, interesting scholar, and she\u2019d always been interested in\nlinguistics and literature. So she gets a doctorate in French. And \u2014 and that becomes\nher field. The head of the French department wants her appointed to the Yale\nCollege faculty. It is said, and I can\u2019t prove it, that 1t goes all the way to the\ncorporation, which says no. We have no women teachers \u2014 no women students in\nthe college, how can we have women teachers? Logic on logic. So she goes and\nteaches at Connecticut College in New London, then Connecticut College for\nWomen. Interesting story about marriage and things. I say to my mother years later,\nwhen my mother says, you know, I\u2019d wanted to do two things in my life. ThreeJuly 27, 2017\nthings. Teach, write and look after my family. Because I wasn\u2019t in a research\nuniversity, I could only do two at a time, and she taught and looked after her\nfamily. When she retired \u2014 actually, after the war, she \u2014 Yale is still closed to her,\nshe moves from Connecticut College, to Albertus Magnus, a Catholic college\nhere, because it\u2019s right nearby, and it\u2019s not as fancy. We don\u2019t need it as a backup\nany more, but she continues to teach. When she retires, she starts to write, and she\nwrites \u2014 well, a book that she wrote in French. We found a letter from the head of\nthe Ecole de France when she died suddenly in Italy, saying from now on\nReynaud(ph) scholarship begins with you, so she was able to do that. But I asked\nher why they didn\u2019t both leave and go to a research university. And I said, is it\nbecause in those days, women followed men? And Papa was here, and he wanted to\nstay here. And she laughed and she said, oh no. What happened was that when this\nhappened, your father was furious, and wanted to leave.",
        "Q: When they didn\u2019t accept her at Yale.",
        "A: At Yale. Wanted to leave and tried both to go to research universities. And she\nsaid, but I wouldn\u2019t let him. And I said, why? And she said, I wouldn\u2019t let him\nbecause here he was hanging on by his fingernails, and despite his accent, people\nwere beginning to appreciate him. Not as the scholar he was, but as a teacher, as a\nclinician, as a wonderful clinician. And here I thought he would ultimately make it.July 27, 2017\nI thought if we went someplace else, he wouldn\u2019t. And I knew that I was the\nstronger, and the more flexible, and that I could deal with it. And she was a brilliant\nwoman, and could. Her way of teaching is more like mine than my dad\u2019s. My mom\n\u2014 it gets complicated, but you \u2014 and I said well, but how did you keep them, if \u2014\nyou know, as a matter of principle, and she smiled and she said, I made a scene.\nAnd when my mother made a scene, it was a scene. And she said, I said to him,\nMassimo, you made me leave Italy in a matter of principle, and I left my family,\nmy friends, and everybody. And you were right. But it was very costly. Now, I\u2019m\nbeginning to make friends here \u2014 she couldn\u2019t have cared less, okay \u2014 and you want\nus to leave again, on a matter of principle. This one\u2019s on me. We stay. What could\nhe do? And then she looked at me quite fiercely, and she said, but you must never\ntell him. Okay, my mother dies suddenly \u2014",
        "Q: What year?",
        "A: \u20141n Italy. She was almost 80. My father was giving some lectures, she had gone\nthere, she had tea with a friend, and her friend said, you look happy. She said, it\nwas easy to be happy if you\u2019re fortunate in your daughters-in-law, has a heart\nattack and dies. My father is upset and doesn\u2019t want to talk about her for months.\nThen finally, one evening I\u2019m having dinner with him \u2014 he survives her by about\nfive years, six years. He says to me, you know, your mother was a great lady. And I\n131July 27, 2017\nsaid yes. And he says, no, I don\u2019t think you know. And I say oh? He said, you\nknow, when she couldn\u2019t get an appointment at Yale, I wanted to leave. And I said,\noh? And he said, but she wouldn\u2019t let me. And I said, oh? And he said, she said\n[indecipherable] and I said, oh? And then he looked at me and he said, all\nnonsense. She knew she was the stronger one, and she never told me. And \u2014",
        "Q: Oh. Oh. How beautiful.",
        "A: Well, and think about a marriage between two people, who in many ways could\nnot have been more different. I mean, he was totally anti-religion, Jewish, no, no,\nthat was his background, but never set foot in the synagogue. She had become\nCatholic, which he didn\u2019t like, with \u2014 all sorts of different fields, different things.\nCould argue about everything, and did. But ultimately \u2014",
        "Q: There\u2019s also a lot of wisdom and depth, t \u2014 for both to see these things about the\nother.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that\u2019s all part of being this kind of outsider.\nNow, you know, you were outsiders, and then there were occasional little things\nwhich were not. When my mother comes to pick me up the first few day \u2014 the first\nday or so that I\u2019ve gone to Worthington Hooker, this public school, just a few\nblocks from where we were living, she arrives and she sees a whole group of kids\naround me, sort of singing something and saying something, and said oh dear,July 27, 2017\nthey\u2019re teasing Guido again. But when she gets near, she hears wh-what they\u2019re\nsaying is Guido has a girlfriend, Guido has a girlfriend. So she says, he\u2019s okay.\nWho was this girl? Well, there was, in my class \u2014 I was back in second grade, in\nmy proper class, a little girl whose father was a philosopher. They were Americans,\nbut he had studied \u2014 taught, whatever, for many years in England, and they\u2019d just\ncome back from England. And he was now the faculty, and he \u2014 his daughter was\na classmate of mine. She struck me immediately as being civilized. She was the\nonly European, and it was a different way of being. And we became very good\nfriends, and she then \u2014 complicated life, ended up going back to England actually,\nand became a great poet. Her name is Anne Stevenson, she\u2019s won all sorts of\nprizes.",
        "Q: Rings a bell.",
        "A: She wrote a book about Sylvia Plath, which is controversial and so on. And\nwe\u2019re in touch with each other. Her sister was in Anne\u2019s class, because they\nultimately went over to this other school as well. And we\u2019ve remained friends. So\nthere were contacts, that usually had to do with something not exactly Italian, but\nEuropean, something. Or there were people \u2014 there was a great, old classics\nprofessor, who lived to be a hundred, named heners \u2014 Hendrickson. When AnneJuly 27, 2017\nand I were engaged, and all sorts of people in the Italian-American community here\nwere so excited about the fact that this Italian was marrying into this great, great \u2014",
        "Q: Yankee family.",
        "A: \u2014 family. Professor Hendrickson came to see my parents, and said \u2014 who we\u2019d\nbecome a good friend of, because he was somebody who was \u2014 who knew Italy\nbefore the great migrations and so on, and in finding Italians, said to them, oh I\u2019m\nvery glad, because I want you to know, that this a good family. He, telling \u2014 I was a\nfriend of Anne\u2019s, he said, great-grandfather, who was a professor in the law school\nand treasurer of the university, who died in 1906, but this guy knew him, as a\nfriend of his, and they\u2019re really good people, so I\u2019m glad \u2014 so again, this funny,\nreverse \u2014",
        "Q: But also very touching.",
        "A: Very touching.",
        "Q: Very, very touching, and \u2014 I mean, again, as you\u2019ve been speaking about the\nItalian world, and the Italian world, as I keep saying for two millennia, you know,\nof your family, and the history, one could make an assumption that some of the\nsuccess of the people who were part of your family, 1s built on those who came\nbefore.",
        "A: I suppose.\n134July 27, 2017",
        "Q: You know, connections and this and that, and so how much talent do you really\nhave to display?",
        "A: I mean, who \u2014",
        "Q: But when you come here, you have none of that.",
        "A: Yeah, who knows? And \u2014 and it \u2014 my parents did not put pressure on us. I think\nthat both my brother and I knew very well, that we had to do well, because I think,\nwhen somebody in school asked me, why do you work hard? You\u2019re so bright, you\ncan do everything easily.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Why do you work hard? And I s \u2014 I know I said, because I have to be able to be\non my own if anything happens. And so that while my parents protected us\nenormously, I think both Paul and I knew that we had to rebuild because we had\nthis \u2014 we were okay, but immensely fragile. Because if anything had happened to\nthem, it ha \u2014 and we saw, you know, also, other people who hadn't be \u2014 my father\nhad been told by his father, it\u2019s very nice you want to study medicine, but\nremember, you don\u2019t really need to work for a living. Fortunately, my father\nignored that, and \u2014",
        "Q: Studied medicine.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: \u2014 studied medicine. So when we came, there was something that he could do.\nMy mother was a learned \u2014",
        "Q: Person.",
        "A: \u2014 person, and so could do something. There was another Italian-American-\nJewish family that ended up in New Haven, the time that we were here. Oddly,\nbecause the younger sister of this man\u2019s wife had gotten a fellowship to study at\nYale, just a much younger person, and so these two ended up here. He was of a\nfamily that was extremely wealthy insurance people from Venice. And she was of\ngood family, not great and so on. She hadn't studied as much as my mother, she\nwas not that. And he was an insurance man, of a great business family. They came\nhere. He worked in a factory. She got picked up by this wonderful headmistress of\nan elementary school to teach French, so that we all learned French from Madame\n[indecipherable] who is this Italian woman, and so on. And that was better\nenough. But in a way, people like Paul and me, saw how important it was, if you\nwere not in a world that knew you. And we didn\u2019t even know of a world that knew\nus any more. We didn\u2019t even know. This was the world that we knew, that we\nwere. And so it \u2014 that probably was something that drove us to \u2014 well, my parents\nnever \u2014 never said that \u2014 you know, the fact of getting good grades and so on, was\n136July 27, 2017\nsomething that in my family was always \u2014 everybody always had, so that that was\nnot an issue. That was not \u2014",
        "Q: It \u2014 another thought that I had as you\u2019ve been certainly telling me the past of the\nItalian branch of the family, is when did you learn these things? It must have been\nhere, because you were six years old when you left.",
        "A: Oh yes. I learned things here, some from my parents when \u2014 when I went back. I\nhappen to be a person who was always blessed with a great memory, and a very,\nsort of broad interest. So that when I went and met relatives there, I would talk to\nthem about their history, I would hear about them. And all of these things sort of\ngot learned, some here, some from my brother, who knew things in a somewhat\ndifferent way than I did. But more, I think just in talking to my parents, and in\nbeing interested in things in which, to some extent they were not. They were much\nless interested in their ancestors, because to them it had come as a matter of course.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: And somehow you were, you know \u2014 they were people for whom this whole\nancient history was kind of \u2014 you know, a bother. For me it was something that was\nkind of interesting to know who I was, in a place where I wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Interesting way \u2014 well put, you know.\n137\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: You know, and \u2014 and so that \u2014 that became, and so I\u2019d listened and I took these\nthings in. And by the way, that\u2019s why I\u2019m in a hurry, I\u2019ve written a draft of this\nbook. It\u2019s an ugly draft, it\u2019s not well, but I\u2019m almost 85, and how long I\u2019Il last I\ndon\u2019t know, and I wanted to get it down on paper so that if I don\u2019t get it in shape, at\nleast it\u2019s there, because I\u2019m the last one who knows these stories.",
        "Q: They\u2019re important stories. They paint \u2014 they paint a world, you know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And they paint the individual destiny.",
        "A: They paint a world of people who somehow thought that nothing could happen\nto them, found themselves in desperate danger, reacted to that in a variety of\ndifferent ways, and then find that people, in a variety of different ways and of\ndifferent means, saved them.",
        "Q: That\u2019s huge.",
        "A: And that\u2019s remarkable.",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s huge.",
        "A: And that\u2019s remarkable. And \u2014 and it is different from different Holocaust tales\nof others.",
        "Q: Judge Calabresi, there is so much more that we could talk about.",
        "A: But I think this is a \u2014 good.July 27, 2017",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: And I hope this is useful to the museum, but I \u2014",
        "Q: I think",
        "A: \u2014 a part \u2014 I just \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve loved meeting you two.",
        "Q: Thank you so much, and it\u2019s been mutual. I \u2014 we could talk so much about your\npostwar career. I will just say now that amongst your students was one of our\nformer presidents, President Bill Clinton.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Who appointed you a second circuit court judge, is that correct?",
        "A: Yes. And he \u2014 well, and Hillary, of course. And three people on the Supreme\nCourt.",
        "Q: Summer \u2014 Sonia \u2014",
        "A: Clarence Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Sam Alito. And I can tell you\nsomething about their schoolwork.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s not a Holocaust story.",
        "A: That\u2019s not a Holocaust story.",
        "Q: Okay.\n139July 27, 2017",
        "A: But you know, I been \u2014 I been extraordinarily lucky, and have had \u2014 you know,\nI\u2019ve been extraordinarily lucky, or blessed, and God knows why. And in the end,\nwhat I said when I was appointed a judge, that America did do for me, and people\nhere, all sorts of very, very good things, and it didn\u2019t do it for others. And one of\nthe things of being a refugee is seeing what was done for you, and who did it, and\ntrying to do that for others.",
        "Q: Thank you.",

        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Bianca Maria Finzi-Contini, and married to\nCalabresi. She was born actually in Milan, because her father, who was a \u2014 an\nearly neurologist, he studied with Charcot, the teacher of Freud. About the same\ntime, he decided that much of it was bunk, he inherited some money, and kept up.\nHe said, someday it will all be fine. That\u2019s kind of nice, because his great-July 27, 2017\ngrandchildren, one my gran \u2014 my daughter, is a psychiatrist. My brother\u2019s son is a\nneurologist professor at Johns Hopkins. So it\u2019s come round.",
        "A: But he was in Milan at the time. But they were from Bologna.",
        "A: And Finzi-Contini originally all came from Ferrara, but the family had\ntransferred to Bologna quite early and \u2014 and was a family that was responsible for\nmuch of the urban development of Bologna. They owned a good deal of the center\nof Bologna.",
        "A: The kind of key figure in all this was a man named Leon Vita Finzi-Contini,\nwho was born in 1776, and who \u2014 whose grave is in the Jewish cemetery in\nBologna. He had many children by his first wife, who went in all different\ndirections. Some are very actively practicing Jews in Israel. One is a\u2014 was a\nrelative in some other way, is a good friend, is a professor of economics in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nTurin. And some married Catholic nobles, and became immensely rich. One of the\ngreat art collections in Italy is the Contini Bonacossi Collection in Florence, and\nthey are all descendants.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So let me first say something about my father.",
        "A: Well, one other thing about my mother\u2019s family. Her mother is of a family that\nclaims to have been brought by Titus in his triumph, in 70 Common Era. Caesar\nRoff(ph) says it\u2019s so. The Jewish Encyclopedia of 1900 says it\u2019s so. There were \u2014\nwhen the Romans conquered a place, they tended to bring princes, kings and so on\nin their trials. When the conquered Palestine, they brought judges, priests and\nelders. We were the elders. Zekanym(ph).",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, so they came as, in the tribe \u2014 I\u2014 I must say, I haven\u2019t seen anybody \u2014 I\nwent to the Arch of Titus, nobody looks like my great-uncle, carrying the menorah,\nbut there it is. Anyway, they came as \u2014 as slaves, originally, became tutors to the\nemperors. Followed the emperors to Ravenna when the western empire went there,\nand when the empire fell, around 500, moved nearby, to a town of Lugo, where\nthey set up shop as bankers, moneylenders, and as rabbis of the Italian rite. Because\nwe are Italkim; we are not Sephardic, we are not Ashkenazim, we are people who\nwere there before the diaspora, and in Italy, and in Israel \u2014 there\u2019s a synagogue in\nIsrael which is the Italian one. Obvious rite. And that was what our tradition was\non both sides. And so these people, who had all sorts of ups and downs, ultimately\nlent enough money to the pope so that he gave them permission to practice their\ntrade in Bologna. And I think the popes meant by trade, banking, money-lending.\nThese people said, but we are teachers of law, because they were rabbis of the\nItalian rite. And so, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but somehow \u2014 but the \u2014 the legend 1s\nthat the way we got into law teaching was because of this. Anyway, so \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "A: Oh, this is all family tales and stories that ha \u2014 have been, and I just enjoy them.\nWell, anyway, that line is one which was very self-important, for obvious reasons.",
        "A: And my grandmother married my grandfather, this \u2014 of this very good family,\nwith high intellectual traditions, and so on, and going back hundreds of years in\nitself, in Ferrara. But that gave that name a certain connotation, of elegance, or\nsomething. My \u2014 I said to my mother \u2014 my mother said aristocracy, I said\ndecadence, she said it\u2019s the same thing, Guido. And there it is. Okay. Now.",
        "A: Let me then take my father\u2019s family, and \u2014 because that deals with this book.\nMy father\u2019s family, the Calabresi, were, according to their tradition, which isn\u2019t as\nproven as the other, were traders in Rome in Republican time. That is even earlier.\nNow, it is a fact that the largest number of people in Rome who were not Romans,\nat the time of the Roman Republic, before Julius Caesar, before the empire and so\non, were Jews, who were traders. There were about 15 \u2014 2500. Different figures,\nbut a significant number of people who were Jews trading. And the story, in that\nside of the family is that they stayed there, and when \u2014 and settled somewhere\nsouth of Rome, where we don\u2019t know. In 1496, everything from Rome south was\nJuly 27, 2017\nSpanish territory, and Jews were expelled in 1492 from Spain, 1496 from Spanish\nterritory, Portugal and Spanish territory. Two people went from somewhere south\nof Rome, to Ferrara. And there is a document which says two people came from\nLe Calabria. Today Calabria is just the toe. But in Ferrara, at the time, they\ncalled everything from Rome south, Le Calabria. And said where two people\ncame, bought lands \u2014 because Ferrara was very open to Jews. I\u2019ll show you some\npictures [indecipherable]. And because they came from Le Calabria and there\nwere two of them, we called them Calabrese, which means people from Calabria.\nCalabrese with an e, meaning person, is quite a common name in the south.\nCalabresi with an iis unusual. It isn\u2019t always just descendants of these two, but a\nlot are descendants of these two, and with an i, it often is Jewish. With and e \u2014 not\nalways, but often is \u2014 with an e, almost never.",
        "A: We \u2014 the other line had many children, and so on. We were down to none, until\nmy father was born. He was the only male of his generation. So my grandfather\ntried to see if these two were related. Then my father was born, and he lost interest.\nAnyway, they came to Ferrara, joined the Italian synagogue. There were in\nFerrara a German, a Spanish, and an Italian, and they joined the Italian. But it\nwasn\u2019t because they were angry with the Spanish. If you look at the ruins of theJuly 27, 2017\nSpanish synagogue, you see signs of donations by Calabresi because they treated\nus so well, when we were in their territory. So it \u2014 they were Italkim, who had to be\nSephardic when this was Spanish territory, got to Ferrara, found an Italian\nsynagogue and joined up in it, which gives some evidence that maybe the story that\nthey went back, is true. They married into another very, very old and very wealthy\nfamily of Ferrara, Minerbi, who are also \u2014 again, the family is all over. One of\nthem, Sergio Minerbi is in Israel and was the ambassador of Israel to the unite \u2014\nto Europe, and \u2014 and at one point to the Vatican, which he didn\u2019t much like. But he\n\u2014 anyway, this family is a major, major family, and had \u2014 and members of the\nfamily still do \u2014 had houses \u2014 and I\u2019Il show you on the map of Ferrara afterwards,\nwhere \u2014 which go back to the 13\" century. My father\u2019s first cousin and best friend,\nwas the patron of Bassani, the man who wrote the book from which the movie was\ntaken. He helped him financially, and Bassani wrote the book, that book and\nothers. He dedicated one to my cousin, but he wrote that book and others in that\nfamily house, in the library of that house.

Beppe had a\nyounger sister, who married my mother\u2019s brother. They met at our \u2014 my parents\u2019\nwedding, married. So that it was not surprising that he would think, in this guy\u2019s\nhouse, of a younger \u2014 near his age, not his age, person named Finzi-Contini.

        "A: And who was my age, and very close. We found a letter that he had not\nparticularly seen, because he \u2014 he never talked about \u2014 and he would have, we\u2019ve\ntalked about the thing, to his father, my uncle.",
        "A: From Bassani.",
        "A: Saying, I\u2019m writing a book, and I want to call it \u201cThe Garden of the Finzi-\nContini.\u201d I thought of you because of that. So that I am quite sure of the story \u2014\nnobody knows this, but 1t\u2019s so \u2014 and I\u2019m \u2014 that he sort of asked for permission. And\nthat\u2019s how that came to.",
        "A: No, my mother was long since dead.",
        "A: I just learned this two years ago, when my cousin died.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: My mother made peace with Bassani. It was an intere \u2014 that\u2019s another story,\nthat is really to decide, but \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And as \u2014 also as \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Because where it \u2014 there are interesting questions about that. Bassani himself\ndidn\u2019t like the movie for certain reasons.",
        "A: No. He pulled himself away, and then it\u2019s a reason, all which have to do with\nthe treatment of Jews during that time, and so on. So \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yeah.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Yeah, it \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, there\u2019s no \u2014",
        "A: Well, that is interesting too, because at \u2014 at any number of times, in the history\nof this Zekanym(ph), Delvecchio(ph), DeLugo(ph) family, you have first names\nthat sound Catholic. And at other times you have names that are nondescript, like\nAlexander, Cyrus, names that Jews who were assimilating had. And at other times\nyou have names which are clearly Jewish, Ekakoh(ph), Solomone(ph),\nJuly 27, 2017\nAbramo(ph), and so on. So that I think \u2014 and I think it is clearly the case, that at\nmany times, in the history of these families, some married Catholics, some\nassimilated, some came back. At times it was done because it was useful. At times\nit was done because people did. But then, there always was a pull back. And that\u2019s\nkind of interesting, because no \u2014 my \u2014 it\u2019s another story, but my mother became\nCatholic, and I was brought up Catholic. My wife is an old Yankee. My daughter,\nBianca Finzi-Contini reconverted.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah. And her daughter, Ginevra(ph) Finzi-Contini Gilmore is going to have\nher Bat Mitzvah this coming June. So \u2014 and the same is true of some branches in\nItaly. It\u2019s just a very complicated tale.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Which has something to do with what happened to us when we came here, but\nthat\u2019s another \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: We\u2019re fine, no.",
        "A: They\u2019re going to tell us.",
        "A: She had three siblings. She was the eldest.",
        "A: Then her \u2014 the second, Bruna(ph) Finzi-Contini was the one who married the\nMinerbi.",
        "A: The third, Marcella(ph), married a man named Guido Tedeschi, who was of a\nvery, very wealthy old, very Jewish family of Bologna.",
        "A: And their story, they ended up going to Brazil, and their story is another\ninteresting story, why they went to Brazil, and it\u2019s part of our story of coming. And\nthen a younger brother, Renato(ph), who married a woman of a Sephardic family,July 27, 2017\nbut who also was in some other way a cousin, because there were many inter-\ncousins marriage. And their son 1s still alive, and lives in Milan, and is a very close\nfriend.",
        "A: And my father\u2019s family, instead, were free. My father was the youngest, he had\nan older sister Renata, who was one of the founders of clinical psychology. She\nfled to America \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 too. Then Cecilia(ph), who \u2014 neither were married. She stayed in Italy, and\nlooked after my grandmother, and did some quite courageous and remarkable\nthings during the war.",
        "A: And after the war, she came and joined us, but both are buried in the Jewish\ncemetery in Ferrara.",
        "A: Massimo.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Four.",
        "A: She had two younger brothers and one younger sister.",
        "A: She converted. That\u2019s actually a very interesting story. She converted, and my\nfather, who did not, and who is interesting, because I don\u2019t think practically ever\nset foot in a synagogue. He was a not a believer in any way, though he wanted, and\nwe'll talk about that, to be buried in the Jewish cemetery in Ferrara, and he \u2014 it\u2019s a\ncomplicated business. But he would, I think, have been extremely upset if my\nmother had done what many, many people in her family, and in all sorts of other\nfamilies did, was to convert because of the racial laws. Because he would have\nthought \u2014 he thought that was cowardly. Or, done for financial reasons, which it\nwas done. I\u2019m not one to judge; many people did that, and so on. My mother\nconverted, I\u2019m quite sure, for a very odd reason. She was a highly intellectual\nwoman, PhD in Italy, PhD here. In some ways, a feminist. And not in a modern\nway, but a woman who \u2014 and at some point, she decided she believed in God. AndJuly 27, 2017\nthe problem was that all these ancient Italian Jewish families, pretty much all of\nthem, were non-practicing, non-believers. I mean, you know, we were Jewish\nbecause that was the great tradition. It was almost a snobbery. It was something we\nwere very, very keen on, and are still very, very keen on. But it was not a religious\nmatter, at all. But people in Italy who were religious, were all Orthodox. Now, for\na woman who thought herself liberated, to be Orthodox at that time \u2014 we\u2019re talking\n1920s and so on, 30s, that didn\u2019t fit. And so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s a little ironical today.",
        "A: She became Catholic because this was a way to practice, because she didn\u2019t feel\nyou could just be religious, and not.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And \u2014 and my father respected that in a way that he would not have\nrespected \u2014 he didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: But he respected it. And the interesting thing about her, as she became older and\nolder, she said, as I get older, I become ever more Catholic, and ever more Jewish.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: That is",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s sort of interesting to me, that feeling. Now, as I say,\nnow, she had a \u2014 a Catholic grandmother whom she never knew. That is her father,\nFinzi-Contini\u2019s mother was a noble Catholic who died in childbirth with my\ngrandfather. My great-grandfather remarried somebody who was Jewish and my\ngrandfather was brought up in this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 well, Jewish without any practicing, but very conscious of his Jewish. So that\nva \u2014 va \u2014 there was this \u2014 this Catholic, but the \u2014 that was not unusual, for the\nreasons I said. There were always intermarriages, and things.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Yeah, it \u2014 they are \u2014 we \u2014 we have always thought of ourselves as being Italian,\nand we have always thought of ourselves as being Jewish. And we have never\nthought, even during times of persecution, that there was any \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 fundamental conflict.",
        "A: No, after my birth.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t exactly.",
        "A: 1930s, early 30s \u2014",
        "A: Yes, definitely before the racial laws.",
        "A: I was brought up Catholic, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I was not \u2014 I was not baptized \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "A: \u2014 until the racial laws.",
        "A: Yeah, five, six, yeah",
        "A: Well, until \u2014 I am now a practicing Catholic, but that \u2014 and I am also very\nJewish, and \u2014 but that didn\u2019t happen until \u2014 until college. And this was obvious\ngrowing up, I was \u2014 you know, I was baptized. I never went to communion,\nbecause my father \u2014 you know, that \u2014 so the two just kept say \u2014 keep thinking about\nit.",
        "A: I\u2014I go every Sunday to mass.",
        "A: No. No, no, no.",
        "A: Never.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Never, never, never, never.",
        "A: Not until this happened, when I was studying in England.",
        "A: A completely different thing.",
        "A: But I was brought up with a mother who was religious, Catholic, very liberal,\nfor \u2014 I think that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And very strongly conscious of her Jewish heritage. My father,\nnon-practicing anything, but very conscious of his Jewish heritage, and very\ndefinitely not \u2014 I \u2014 I insisted, when I put my name in for a freshman at \u2014 you know,\nGuido Calabresi, son of Massimo Calabresi and Bianca Finzi-Contini, because\nthe name, it wasn\u2019t the book or the thing then, but the name Finzi 1s a classic\nItalian Jewish name. So that anybody who knows anybody sees Finzi, says Jewish.\nSo it \u2014 I was conscious enough of that, while being \u2014",
        "A: Oh well, 1-in the yearbook, in the freshman yearbook, where you have \u2014 you say\nwho you are, and what your parents, I could have put Massimo and Bianca\nCalabresi. But instead, I put \u2014",
        "A: In 1949.",
        "A: Yeah",
        "A: I had an older brother.",
        "A: Who \u2014 his name is Paolo. He \u2014 in the United States he used the name Paul,\nwhich is the English of it. I almost never \u2014 when I was in high school, I sometimes\nused the name Guy, which is the English for Guido, but basically I never used it.\nMy brother \u2014 again, it had more to do with what happened when we first came. In\nthat sense became more \u2014 slightly more conformist, and he was known as Paul. He\nbecame chief of medicine at Brown, and was one of the fen \u2014 founders of cancer\nchemotherapy.",
        "A: Yeah.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "A: Well, it is unusual.",
        "A: Which is \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I was born at home.",
        "A: We were very wealthy. And our house was a very fan \u2014 you know, it\u2019s a very\nelegant apartment, and \u2014 and then our house, as I say, is the to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 townhouse that \u2014 and we had a great deal of help. I\u2014 my brother and I never\nthought of ourselves as being rich. You know, you don\u2019t. Children don\u2019t. And we\nhad a wonderful nanny, who came back to look after my children when we went on\nJuly 27, 2017\nsabbatical for the first time. And we lived what seemed to be a very ordinary life.\nUnderneath, there was a tremendous struggle, because my father, from the earliest\ndays of fascism, had been an active anti-fascist. He was first beaten and jailed in\n1924, when he was a student in Florence.",
        "A: They were in Florence because my grandparents had moved from Ferrara to\nFlorence. They had moved from Ferrara to Florence because my grandfather\nCalabresi, who was an industrialist, was a very powerful man. His wife, Minerbi,\nwas a \u2014 probably the wealthiest family in Ferrara, certainly the wealthiest Jewish\nfamily in Ferrara, of great landowners. They owned huge amounts of land. To the\nfascists, in a small town like Ferrara, having this pair, who were fiercely anti-\nfascist, was too dangerous. And so they said, out of here. You can go anywhere in\nItaly you want, but not in Ferrara. And if you come back to Ferrara, we'll jail\nyou. So my par \u2014 grandparents, moved to Florence. And there is, my oral historian\nfound a letter from the fascist prefect in Ferrara, to the fascist prefect in Florence,\nyou\u2019ve gotten yourself a real headache, because Ettare(ph) Calabresi \u2014 my\nerandfather\u2019s name \u2014 likes to talk, causes trouble, has re \u2014 millions to support his\ntrouble, and he is going to cause you \u2014 my grandfather went away. My father\nbecame actively anti-fascist, and part of a small group of democrats with a small d,July 27, 2017\nwho were anti-fascist. They didn\u2019t belong to any ism. He helped distribute the first\nunderground newspaper, non mollare, don\u2019t give up. Was called justice and\nliberty, \u201cGiustizia e liberta.\u201d And on his grave it says, in Italian, faithful to justice\nand liberty, which is a pun, both \u2014 he was, as I say, va \u2014 was very, very active.\nWhen it c-came clear that Mussolini wouldn\u2019t fall, that they couldn\u2019t bring him\ndown, in the late 20s, early 30s, my father wanted to leave.",
        "A: Yeah. My grandfather was a patriot of the old school, and said, one doesn\u2019t\nleave one\u2019s country, one stays and fights. And so we stayed. In the fall of 1937, my\ngrandfather died of natural causes. That same summer, slightly before, the two\nbrothers who had become heads of this small group of anti-fascists \u2014 they were\nnamed Rosselli, and everywhere in Italy you\u2019ll find a square or a boulevard named\nFratelli Rosselli, Roselli brothers, were murdered by the fascists. So my f \u2014 and\nthey were my father\u2019s closest friends. And my aunt, the one who came, were just\nvery close friends. So my father said, it\u2019s getting too close, and with his father\ndying, he didn\u2019t feel an obligation to stay. So in 1937, before the racial laws, my\nfather decided that we would leave. But that was not easy, because you couldn\u2019t\nleave.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, I know the circumstances very well. I\u2019ve told it in some commencement\ntalks. One of my commencement talks at Connecticut College, many years ago, 1s\nlisted in the best \u2014 10 best commencement talks, as published somewhere, because\nit was choices.",
        "A: And one of the stories is how my father chose to become an active anti-fascist.\nAnd I asked him, and he said, everybody talks about the banality of evil, no one\ntalks about the banality of good, and it is equally \u2014 well, here\u2019s how it happened. I\nwas a student at the University of Florence, because we had moved to Florence,\nand the fascists had kicked out the president of the university because he was very\nstrong and tough, and \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. This is 1924 \u2014 \u201923, \u201924, something like that, \u00b024. And he \u2014\nthey kicked out the president, and my father said \u2014 and they put in his place, one of\nour teachers, professor, I don\u2019t know, of anatomy of physiology or something. WasJuly 27, 2017\na nice man, we liked. And wasn\u2019t particularly fascist, but was weak. So but \u2014 ah, he\nwas installed, and he was our teacher, so we went to the installation. And he gave a\nspeech, and fine, and we applauded. And then the fascist minister of education got\nup, and gave a horrible speech. Well, him just saying, you\u2019ll do this, you\u2019ll do that,\nyou'll do the other, just horrible. You can imagine. And he stopped in the middle,\nas politicians will do for applause, and my father said, I didn\u2019t applaud. And said\nsome \u2014 couple of us didn\u2019t applaud. We didn\u2019t hiss or boo. We were much too well\nbrought up to do anything like that. But we just didn\u2019t applaud. Then somebody\nbehind me said, the next time he stops, you\u2019d better applaud, because there are\nsome goons at the back who are taking the names of those who are not applauding.\nMy father said, I was 21 years old. If somebody had told me that if I went and\ndidn\u2019t applaud I\u2019d get into trouble, I probably would have stayed home. Or I might\neven have gone and applauded. But here I didn\u2019t applaud, and now somebody told\nme I had to applaud. I couldn\u2019t do it. So I didn\u2019t applaud the next time, and when\nwe left, we got picked up and beaten up. And I said, what happened then? He said,\nwe went to wash. And I said, why? He said, we didn\u2019t want to go home, people\nlived at home, and they [indecipherable] the university, and show ourselves\nbloody, to scare our \u2014 our parents would have been frightened. And I said, where\ndid you wash? Well, there was a fountain right there, and so we washed there. And\nJuly 27, 2017\nso I said, did you wash there to show you had been beaten up? And he said, I don\u2019t\nthink so, no. He became a little bit \u2014 but we washed there, and the fascists thought\nthat we did, and so they picked us up again and beat us up again and tossed us into\njail. And so, at that point, I was an active anti-fascist. I mean, that was it. And he\nthen did other things. On the anniversary, he and my aunts \u2014 and this been written\nup recently \u2014 on the anniversary of the murder of the leader of the anti-fascists,\nMatteotti, on the first anniversary they went to put a big crown of flowers at\nGaribaldi\u2019s memori \u2014 thing, and the fascists picked them up again and tossed them\nin jail, and that\u2019s how that happened.",
        "A: Yes",
        "A: He said \u2014 you know, there were many people who were anti-fascist, but the\ndifference was between those who became actively, and that became that. Now,\nyou know, again, in terms of choices and non-choices, which is what I say in that,\nfast-forward to 1963, and the march on Washington \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 with Martin Luther King. I had been planning to go, and then I got\nfrightened, because now everybody thinks of it as a Sunday school picnic, but atJuly 27, 2017\nthe time there were bombings in Alabama, congress fled town, everybody was\nscared. And I had a one year old child, Bianca, Jonathan\u2019s wife, and I thought\ngee, you know, the march will take place, it doesn\u2019t really need me. And so \u2014\nduring the week before the march, I\u2019m talking to my father on the phone, and he\nsaid, oh, I\u2019m going to Washington this weekend. And I said, why? And he said,\nI\u2019m going to the march. And I \u2014 I thought of him as being very old, he was maybe\n20 years younger than I am now, but you know how kids are, and I said, but it may\nbe dangerous. And he said, I\u2019m going. I said, well, then I\u2019ll go with you. And he\nsaid, I thought you would. And of course, we went together, and it was a\ntremendous experience for me, to be there as part of that wonderful event. Not so\nmuch the speeches now one talks of, but just walking with thousands of people,\nholding hands, and so on. And it made a big difference to me, and I know that my\nfather was creating a non-choice for me, as he had done.",

And my father was\nhis right hand, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 an associate professor of cardiology there. The\nstory of the pope is that the pope died the day before he would have issued anJuly 27, 2017\nencyclical \u2014 there\u2019s a book about that \u2014 an encyclical, with burning sorrow,\nexcommunicating Mussolini, and declaring that Hitler was a pagan, because of the\nracial laws.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. So, my memories of growing up in Milan are memories of a quiet\nchildhood, going to school there, going on vacation \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 often. Vacation was a kind of complicated thing for families like ours. In June,\none \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, in July, one went to the seashore for a month. In August one went\nto the mountains, and in September, one went to, in this case my mother\u2019s parents\u2019\nvilla outside Bologna. And the father of the family would join you for a m\u2014 on\nweekends, and the month that he took vacation. And my father, being a mountain\nclimber, would join us in August, when we usually would go in the Dolomites,\nsometimes in Va-Val d\u2019Aoste, but usually the Dolomites, and almost always, the\nwhole family would manage to go, cousins, aunts, uncles, to the same place. I\nmean, arranging where you went, you would rent houses in someplace on the shore,\nand everybody would go there. And one year you\u2019d be in the Adriatic, another the\nMediterranean, and that would be that. And I have many, many memories of theseJuly 27, 2017\ntimes, both in the mountains, and photographs of us in the mountains, and in the\nseashore, and all of those things with my cousins. And we were all very calm,\nbecause my parents, though actively anti-fascist, did not make a point of saying this\nto us, especially because my father was determined to leave, and he thought there\nwill be time enough to talk about those things, but anything of that sort that was\ntold to us, might make it, in fact, even more difficult. So we grew up, and were at\nschool, public school, because in Italy everybody went to public school, unless you\nwere either very stupid, or totally bigoted, but you just didn\u2019t go to any other kind\nof school. There was an event which says something about the underlying life.\nSometime during my first grade, which would be 1938, I guess, there was a large\nfuneral of some fascist bigwig. And the fascists wanted everybody, all the children\nin schools, to march in the funeral parade, in uniform, because we were all\nsupposed to march in uniform, and do all things in uniform, and things. And my\nolder brother, who was in third grade, at an age where they already marched with\nrifles, with guns.",
        "A: Yes, yes, which may say something about my attitude about guns. And said,\nwe\u2019re not gonna march. This is ridiculous, children with guns shouldn\u2019t march, this\nis all so\u2014 where he got that, I do not know.July 27, 2017",
        "A: He told me that we were not going to march. I said fine, because he was my\nolder brother, I always did what he wanted. And I said, how are we gonna get out\nof it? He said, we\u2019re going to say that our uniforms are being washed, and we can\u2019t\nafford to have two sets. Of course, it was ridiculous, but we didn\u2019t know that. And\nwe insisted, and we did not march. With the result that I got that term, the only\nfailing grade I have ever gotten. It was, I failed fascist behavior, comportomento\nfascista, and it\u2019s right there on my report card, for \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, there it is. So, this is by way of saying that there was this funny,\nunderlying kind of a thing of \u2014 that we may have known more, or at least my\nbrother, who was just eight, nine \u2014 he was two and a half years older than \u2014 than I,\neight at that time. We \u2014 that we kind of were there, and you know. Now, you asked\nin ab \u2014 ab \u2014 we were talking about Ferrara, and the house there \u2014",
        "A: I have no recollection of going to that house.",
        "A: To my father\u2019s first cousin. At that time, it belonged to his uncle \u2014",
        "A: \u2014my grandmother\u2019s brother. And I was thinking about that, because I remember\nvery well being at my mother\u2019s parents\u2019 villa outside of Bologna. I remember very\nwell Florence, where we would always go in the spring for Pasqua.",
        "A: Easter. Pesach. I don\u2019t know, I mean, we didn\u2019t celebrate either, and my\ngrandparents didn\u2019t celebrate either, but it was that time of year, and it\u2019s interesting\nthat the word for Easter in Italian is Pasqua, which is both Pesach and Easter, and\nthat we would always go, wherein Florence was in flower by then, while Milan\nwas likely to be foggy, so it\u2014 my memories of going to my grandparents in\nFlorence, and they had a wonderful garden, and the gardeners were marvelous\npeople and played with us and so on and so forth. These are wonderful memories of\nthat \u2014 the house, as storied during the war, how it survived and didn\u2019t and so on.\nAll of that. But I have no memory of going to the house in Ferrara, or to seeing\nthat. And I was thinking about that just now, and the answer is quite obvious. My\ngrandparents were prohibited from going there by the fascists. So, of course I\ndidn\u2019t go, they didn\u2019t go back to Ferrara.",
        "A: And \u2014 because they had been kicked out. And so, of course, we didn\u2019t either.\nNow maybe my father went to see his cousin and so on, but this was not a place,July 27, 2017\neven though it was this family site on my father\u2019s family \u2014 my mother\u2019s family was\nin Bologna \u2014 but we didn\u2019t go there, I\u2019m quite sure, because my father \u2014 my\ngrandfather couldn\u2019t go there. And I know that once he went, because there was a\nfuneral of a friend, and he thought he snuck in, and they arrested him. He \u2014 we\nwere rich enough so that none of that mattered.",
        "A: I mean, you could always buy your way out, and that, but I think the answer\nabout why I didn\u2019t really focus on Ferrara until after the war is because \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 my branch had been exiled from there.",
        "A: Of course, because they \u2014",
        "A: They were wealthy, they were there, and they were, of course, mildly anti-\nfascist, or anti-fascist, but they were not in trouble in the way my father and my\ngrandfather were. The story is told that this cousin, who came to own these lands,\nwas a cousin who \u2014 in whose house, when the garden was written, the son of the\nthen proprietor, but who was already \u2014 he had studied agriculture because he was\nmanaging all these lands, which were bef \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "A: Beppe Minerbi.",
        "A: The story is told \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 by my \u2014 my father told me, that in the 1930s, he was a \u2014 there was a prize\ngiven by the fascists for the greatest increase in, I think it was wheat production.\nHe had studied agriculture and wanted to put in modern methods and so on, and\nwas able to convince his farmers to go along with doing these. They wanted to do\nthings in traditional ways, and he wanted to do that, by promising them that if they\nwon the prize, he would give it to them. They won the prize, and at that point the\nfascists said, you are to give the prize to the fascist party as a sign of solidarity. He\nhad always been, you know, philosophically anti-fascist, but hadn't done \u2014 he had\nalways argued with my father, my father shouldn\u2019t have gotten into trouble. He,\nstubborn, but is \u2014 look, I promised the prize to my farmers, I\u2019m giving the prize to\nmy farmers. I\u2019m perfectly happy to give you some money, but the prize \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 goes to the farmers. The fascists said, no the prize you have to give to the\nfascist party, as a symbol of that. At that point he refused, and at that point they\nbeat him up. He didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, that was just an isolated \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 incident, but it shows both \u2014 how most people were kind of going along, even\nif they were anti-fascist in a mild way. And so that\u2019s what the people who were in\nFerrara did. They were not \u2014 they were anti-fascist, but they weren\u2019t going to get\ninto trouble. On the other hand, at that point, he got into trouble. Not permanent\ntrouble, but because of that.",
        "A: Beppe was his cousin.",
        "A: He was \u2014 well, he\u2019s a cousin, first cousin.",
        "A: He was the son of my great-uncle.",
        "A: And he was in Ferrara, he was studying in Ferrara, the \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And that happened many, many years later. But it was \u2014 it would\nhave been, had that happened earlier, something which could have led him to be\nlike my father.",
        "A: As it happened, this was in the 30s, and then, the next thing that happens 1s, as\nwe are desperately trying to get out, and I\u2019m told that we had this offer of this\nfellowship from Yale.",
        "A: But the fascists were not anxious to have people who were so articulate, as my\nparents both were, come and tell people here, what things were like. Because\nMussolini was saying he made the trains run on time.",
        "A: All nonsense, you know, all nonsense, because for instance, he came and\nopened the great new hospital that my father\u2019s chief had gotten money for. It was\nall anti-fascist, but Mussolini came and opened it, and all the newspapers said that.\nSo they didn\u2019t want people here to say what it was really like. And so the story is,\nthat when our application for a temporary visa, to go for a term, which should haveJuly 27, 2017\nbeen granted, somebody was told, every time it comes to the top of a pile, put it at\nthe bottom. Fortunately, bureaucrats don\u2019t rip up paper. So it got put at the bottom.\nThis being Italy, we also had somebody in that office who was told, every time it\ngoes to the bottom \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 move it near the top. He \u2014 neither of these people \u2014 this \u2014 this person didn\u2019t\nhave the stamp. Finally, finally, one day the guy who was supposed to put it at the\nbottom wasn\u2019t there, and the guy \u2014 our guy had put it near the top, and the guy who\nwas stamping was just stamping, so we got permission. But by this time, it was into\nni \u2014 late 1938, and everything had changed, because the racial laws had been\npassed. So at that point, we really didn\u2019t even need that, because we were being \u2014\nwe could be kicked out. But the importance of a fellowship is that it gave us a way\nof coming into the United States. Because United States wasn\u2019t accepting people.",
        "A: We were never told that. I do know that with this invitation to go, my father\nwent and gave a lecture in Brussels.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: And there got, at the American consulate there, immigration papers, because we\nhad this invitation of a fellowship, and we had gotten somebody who had had\nbusiness dealings with one of my grandparents, to sign an affidavit. There\u2019s a story\nabout that, because that person thought that we would never need money, because\nwe were very wealthy, and they expected that we had money abroad. But both my\ngrandparents were, as I said, patriots of the old school, and they had no money\nabroad.",
        "A: Everything was in Italy, because that was the law, and they abided by it, even\nthough they were anti-fascist. But these persons, and interesting was a long term\nstory about that, about when we arrived, had signed their affidavit. So with that,\nsince the Italian quota was not being met, because you couldn\u2019t leave Italy if you\nwere \u2014 unless you were Jewish and being kicked out. So it was relatively easy for\nus, with this invitation, and with these, to get permission \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 from the Americans. So we left Italy with \u2014 as if we were going for a term \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and came to America, when we landed, as if we were with regular\nimmigration papers.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Because we had both kinds of papers.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. What happened was that my mother\u2019s parents were very much against our\nleaving. They thought, even though the racial laws had been passed, they thought\nthat everything would be okay. And in some ways, well, things were difficult,\nespecially if you weren\u2019t wealthy, if you were really wealthy, nothing very much\nhappened until 1943, when Italy surrendered, and the Germans came in.",
        "A: Okay.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: In 1938, at the end of 1938, Mussolini, who had previously not been\nparticularly with Hitler \u2014 at one point he had sent troops to the Austrian border to\nkeep Hitler from moving into Austria, but had decided to side with Hitler. And\nthere had been people around him who were anti-Semitic. But anyway, whether\nfrom \u2014 not so much from his point of view, he was a nasty man, but that \u2014 but\ngoing along with Hitler, passed laws restricting Jews in any number of dramatic\nways. On the face of them, they were absolutely catastrophic, and some things hit\ndirectly. For instance, you couldn\u2019t teach in universities, or anyplace else. And so\nmy father and my aunt were immediately kicked out of their positions as professors\nat that time.",
        "A: This is my aunt who taught psychology. And so they \u2014 you know, in that, you\nalso were not allowed, supposedly, to have help of anybody who was Catholic. But\nof course, some of the help you\u2019d always had, would stay on, and you also got help\nof somebody \u2014 we had a French governess who was a Protestant. We didn\u2019t realize\nwhat that meant, but there it was, if you were wealthy. Now, you supposedly could\nnot hold properties of certain sorts, and more than a certain amount \u2014 and I'll have\nmore to say about that, how that was avoided. And you also were not supposed toJuly 27, 2017\ngo to school, to the public schools. So these were draconic laws, and they had an\neffect on any number of people, and created anti-Semitism, which by and large in\nItaly had not been. There had been some church anti-Semitism, and some church\nphilo-Semitism. There were people in the Catholic church who were very pro-Jews,\nand you know, all that complications. But these laws were passed, and at that point,\nany number of things happened. As to schools, the Catholic schools, Jesuit schools\nwere open. They were private schools. So that many of my cousins went to Jesuit\nschools, because they weren\u2019t the public schools.",
        "A: We were still, that year, we were still in public schools. So at 1938, we were\nstill in public school. The matter is more complicated because \u2014 and this is\nsomething I hadn't real \u2014 realized, but 1t explains some things that my oral historian\nfound, that in the Italian racial laws, who was not considered Jewish for certain\npurposes, including owning of property, was a very complicated matter. Unlike\nGermany, where if you had Jewish blood, end of it; if you were the product of a\nmixed marriage, and were Christian, you were considered Christian for purposes of\nowning property.",
        "A: And you could continue owning property. Now, there might be difficulties and\nso on, but you could. My mother\u2019s father was born of a Catholic mother, who died\nwhen he was born.",
        "A: At that point, he converted to Catholicism, with the help of a Dominican who\nwas very anti-fascist \u2014",
        "A: As a grown man in 1938.",
        "A: With the help of a man who was a very important Dominican, fiercely anti-\nfascist, fought with the partisans later. His name was Patrick Azatti(ph), I knew\nhim, I met him after the war, he was a great man. He cou \u2014 my grandfather\nconverted, and told everybody in his family, all the Finzi-Contini and their\nrelatives, to convert. Because if he converted, he was a Christian, for purposes of\nthe racial laws. He then married in this ancient, ancient Jewish family, but that was\na mixed marriage. So their children, if they were Catholic, were also Christian in\nterms of being able to own property. So all of these people in my mother\u2019s family,\nwere able to own property.",
        "A: They all converted. Some converted and it took, and they remained Catholic.\nSome converted and it didn\u2019t, because they were just converting for v \u2014 purposes.",
        "A: My grandfather actually, because of this memory of his mother whom he never\nknew, I think actually converted. He died in 1941, and \u2014",
        "A: Of natural causes, of cancer, and \u2014 and so, you know, it was in \u2014 but that meant\nthat the properties remained in our names.",
        "A: In that side of the family. In my father\u2019s side of the family, the Calabresi, there\nwas my father and my two aunts. My mother \u2014 or, none of whom \u2014 my two aunts\nwere not married. My father was married to my mother, and it\u2019s at that point, only\nat that point that my brother and I are baptized. And if I think about it, we were\nbaptized because my mother thought it was a good idea at that point, and my father\ncouldn\u2019t be, but partly because my grandfather was saying, this way they will be\nable to own property. Because again, half, half, half, half \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but it continues to go all the way through. On the Minerbi side, it happened\nthat my great-uncle had two sons, and two daughters.July 27, 2017",
        "A: My \u2014 Beppe, his older brother Julio, oldest daughter Ginevra, and youngest\ndaughter Fernanda. Beppe and Julio each had married Catholic women.\nFernanda, the youngest, had married my mother\u2019s brother, who through this series\nof tricks, was also Catholic. Now, their granddaughter, one of them \u2014 two of them\nhave converted back to Judaism, and so \u2014 so it \u2014 it\u2019s all \u2014",
        "A: It gets confusing.",
        "A: Ginevra had no children. Great-uncle, who owned all these lands and\nproperties, gives them all to his grandchildren. Why to his grandchildren? Because\nthey nominally could be Christian, for purposes of this. Now, in fact, there were\nany number of pressures, and things a-and of course, none of this matters after\n1943.",
        "A: When the Germans come in. But it was a situation in which it looked as though,\nif you wanted to, and were rich enough, you could survive, despite these horrible\nracial laws.",
        "A: Keep your assets, be able to study. My father couldn\u2019t, and his sister, who\nwould, even if they converted would do no good, because of course, racially, they\ndidn\u2019t have a Catholic ancestors, but anyway, they wouldn\u2019t, because they didn\u2019t\nwant to.",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t teach. Couldn\u2019t be \u2014 so it \u2014 there were all sorts of restrictions, and they\nwere horrible. On the other hand, my mother\u2019s parents thought we\u2019d be able \u2014 what\na \u2014 who knows how long this will last? Administrations come and go, and in the\nmeantime, we\u2019re able to continue to hold our properties, and do these things. So\nthey didn\u2019t want us to leave.",
        "A: Of course. Of course, completely logical, completely logical.",
        "A: This is our country, we live well. You want to go someplace where you go\nwithout a penny, because it was against the law \u2014 I have always said under penalty\nof death, it wasn\u2019t penalty of death, 1t was just people who were caught, get killed.\nBut we go some strange place like that. So, my mother and father agree that my\nfather will come to America and see \u2014 and to Yale, and see one can really live in\nthis country. And we will follow, after he\u2019s been here two or three months, andJuly 27, 2017\nseen whether it is possible. My grandparents, well, they had no choice in the matter\n\u2014 my mother\u2019s \u2014 but that was my mother, kind of. What happens 1s that by now, it\nis August of 1939.",
        "A: It is \u2014 that much time has passed between finally getting permission, getting\nthings, getting the American things, everything else. My father, supposedly is\nsailing from Genoa on the ship called the Conte di Savoia, which was the second\nof a great Italian ocean liners. My mother is seeing him off.",
        "A: In Genoa. My brother and I are at Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo in the Dolomites, it\u2019s a\ngreat resort there, on that \u2014 near \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 near the Austrian border \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 with my mother\u2019s parents. I\u2019ve gone to bed, and I actually said a prayer \u2014 I\nmean, I\u2019ve just been baptized, I just [indecipherable]",
        "A: I\u2014I remember, yeah, I remember that it was Don Angelo, it was a country\npriest at \u2014 near my mother\u2019s family\u2019s villa outside Bologna, and this was arrangedJuly 27, 2017\nby this great Patrick Azatti(ph), but it was just a local priest who talked to my\nbrother and me a little bit, and we da \u2014 we were baptized. We didn\u2019t quite know\nwhat [indecipherable] but, you know. And so, for my father, who was sailing off,\nthe telephone rings and it\u2019s my mother, who says, the ship didn\u2019t sail. They say it\u2019s\nengine trouble, and that it might sail tomorrow. Somebody in Rome has told us if it\n\u2014 war 1s breaking out. If a ship sails, and war is breaking out, we can\u2019t afford to be\nseparated, so bring the children. If the ship sails, we leave tomorrow, all together.",
        "A: Got it \u2014 I mean, the ship didn\u2019t sail, she called somebody in Rome, or my father\ncalled somebody in Rome.",
        "A: Found out \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 what was going on. Told her parents, bring the children, we may sail\ntomorrow.",
        "A: My mother goes back to Milan that day, tells the maids, put everything that is in\nthe wardrobe rooms in trunks, because we\u2019re leaving. My father, since you couldn\u2019tJuly 27, 2017\nbring money out, had shirts and things, clothes made that would last him. He didn\u2019t\nbuy a shirt for 15 years.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t bring money out, but at least \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so he wouldn\u2019t co \u2014 so he was \u2014 had all his clothes. Our clothes, no. I mean,\neverything in wardrobe rooms gets dumped into trunks, and what was in wardrobe\nrooms wasn\u2019t what you would use every day. So \u2014 but we found our diapers there,\nwhich were made into sheets for examining beds for my father here, because you\ncouldn\u2019t affo \u2014 anyway, and my grandparents are told to bring Paul and me to\nGenoa. I remember the trip perfectly \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because we couldn\u2019t get a sleeper \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that late. We took the train. My grandfather had a chauffeur, but he wouldn\u2019t\nhave had him up in the mountains, he had a chauffeur at the \u2014 at \u2014 at his villa, an-\nand there \u2014 so we \u2014 with our nanny, the same nanny who had been with us, and so\nwe are all in this first class carriage, and I thought that was wonderful, because\nfamilies like ours, parents went first class, the nanny and the children went secondJuly 27, 2017\nclass, not third class, but so that they wouldn\u2019t bother people in first class. This was\nth-the way it was done, polite, children [indecipherable]. And so I loved these\nvery thick, red, velvet cushions and things, and all excited because we were going\nto America. We didn\u2019t know what that was, but my brother announced we were\ngoing to America. My mother\u2019s parents are sitting there with their hands on their\ncanes, looking like death.",
        "A: Because their daughter was leaving, and they didn\u2019t know if they would ever see\nher again. In fact, my grandfather died \u2014 it was an interesting story about that, and\nshe never saw him, when we left, again. My grandmother survived. And \u2014 okay, so\nwe get to Genoa, with our nanny trying to keep us going, and the ship didn\u2019t sail.",
        "A: The same ship \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that was supposed to shi \u2014 sail \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it didn\u2019t sh \u2014 be \u2014 the engine \u2014 it wasn\u2019t engine trouble at all, so \u2014 so what do\nyou do then? You don\u2019t go back to Cortina, which is on the Austrian, now German\nborder. Don\u2019t go back to Milan, because if war ca \u2014 actually comes, it\u2019s likely toJuly 27, 2017\nbe bombed. And in fact, when war did finally come, all our furniture was in a\nwarehouse, and magnificent furniture, was all hit by a bomb, end of that. And our\nhouse was damaged, and other things like that. Where do you go? Well, you go to a\ncountry villa outside of Bologna, my mother\u2019s parents were \u2014 so my mother\u2019s\nparents, my mother and I, my brother, all go to this place outside Bologna.",
        "A: Between Boston and pen \u2014 Philadelphia, something like that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Mean it\u2019s long \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 longish time. So we go there. My father goes back to Milan, to see if there\u2019s\nsome other way of getting out. And there are many kind of \u2014",
        "A: This is August \u201939, end of August \u201939. And all sorts of backs and forths. We get\na call. The American ship, the President Monroe, is coming to pick up American\nnationals, as happens when war is about to break out. They are so crowded thatJuly 27, 2017\nthey need an extra ship\u2019s doctor. I volunteered, and they\u2019ve taken me on, with my\nfamily.",
        "A: Yeah. Get ready to go. Next call, they found a doctor who doesn\u2019t have a\nfamily, so it\u2019s not me. At one point \u2014 by now it\u2019s early September, I think, or \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 very end of August.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the exact date.",
        "A: I\u2019m listening on a earphone radio, and I hear that the Rex, r-e-x King, the ship\nthat appears in the movie \u201cAmarcord,\u201d in the distance, with great \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 th-the \u2014 the great ship of the Italian lines, that it won the blue ribbon for going\nacross fastest [indecipherable] is sailing on a\u2014 on September eighth. The reason is\nthat war has broken out, but Italy has decided not to join. Italy has decided not to\ngo into the war. They don\u2019t go into the war until June of 1940, when they attacked\nFrance. The hand, Roosevelt says, that has held the dagger, has plunged it into the\nback of its friend. So \u2014 so Italy is not joining, the ship is sailing. I turned to say thisJuly 27, 2017\nto my mother, in this wonderful villa, which my grandfather, who was old ha \u2014\nfashioned, had all things lit by lamp, kerosene lamps, you know, things \u2014 all these\nlights, I think flashing [indecipherable]. I turned to say to her \u2014 there makes a\nscene totally in mind, and the phone rings before I can say, it\u2019s my father calling\nfrom Milan, saying that he has tickets on that ship. He had heard before, and had\nalready gotten it. That day, the trunks arrive.",
        "A: With the diapers and everything else.",
        "A: So we turned right around, unopened, go to Genoa, and on the eighth of\nSeptember, leave.",
        "A: All four of us.",
        "A: On the ship.",
        "A: The \u2014 my grandparents, my mother\u2019s parents, remained there, and we go off.\nWe land eight days later, one day to Naples, and then across, on September 16\",\n1939, a Saturday, having had a wonderful trip, because you \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "A: Well, you know, a trip was this fancy ship, and we were doing all sorts of fun\nthings, and my brother, who is more of a packrat, kept all the things from the\ncaptain, so that on anniversaries he\u2019d bring them out from the captain\u2019s table, and\nall the stuff, and how much we did one day, and everything else. And \u2014 all of which\nwas wonderful, and land in New York. One problem. Because we didn\u2019t think we\nwere going to get out, my father cables Yale and says, I\u2019m coming second\nsemester. So we arrive without a fellowship.",
        "A: Yeah, was when we were \u2014 he was planning to go, and see if you could live, and\nthen we would join him.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t happen. The fellowship doesn\u2019t begin til January.",
        "A: And that is \u2014 and Yale is not interested at all in being helpful. I\u20191] have more to\nsay about that. So that we arrive on a Saturday, in New York, without a penny.",
        "A: And the fellowship not to begin.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. So, let\u2019s go back \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and notice that almost everybody stayed.",
        "A: Not everybody. My mother\u2019s sister \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 left before we did. Why?",
        "A: She was married to a man named Guido Tedeschi. There are any number of\npeople named Guido Tedeschi, but this Guido Tedeschi was of a family that was\neven \u2014 well, in Bologna, which was a bigger city, and they were very, very fancy,\nthey were among the wealthiest people there. Their family owned the palace thatJuly 27, 2017\nhad belonged to the great enlightenment pope from Bologna \u2014 they still own it, I\nthink \u2014 Benedict the 13, 14, something. Some Benedict. And they had been\nadmirals and diplomats and all sorts of things like that. My aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s father,\nas a young diplomat, had been consul general of Italy in Sao Paolo, Brazil.",
        "A: The head where all the Italian community and finances were, wonderful position\nfor a young \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 diplomat. And so my uncle, my aunt\u2019s husband, grew up in Brazil, with this\ndiplomatic family.",
        "A: Jewish, Jewish.",
        "A: Jewish.",
        "A: Oh yes, all this, you know, I mean, you know, Italy, at that time, before this,\nJews in Italy \u2014 after the unification of Italy, Jews were totally everywhere. If you\ngo to Lake Como, and you see the founding of the great yacht club, the first name\nis this great noble family, the second name is a name that is [indecipherable]July 27, 2017\nsomebody or other, who is clearly Jewish. The fir \u2014 first mayor of Rome, after the\nunification of Italy is somebody named Nathan, actually related to the Rosselli\nbrothers, whom I talked about before.",
        "A: The chief justice of Italy, of the Court of Cassation, in the early days of fascism\nis aman named Mortada(ph), who is Jewish, who tries to use, what in America\nwould be judicial review to strike down fascist decrees, but there\u2019s no tradition of\nit, and so it fails. And Jews are \u2014 if they were of great families, were all over. And\nthis one was a particularly old and very, very fancy. Tedeschi, by the way, suggests\nAshkenazim, because Tedeschi means German, it means deutsche, it\u2019s the name\nAshkenazi. So if you see somebody, the name Tedeschi often is Jewish in Italy,\nand it meant \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 deutsche. Ashkenazi.",
        "A: But his mother\u2019s family, instead was Italkim and very fancy.",
        "A: Anyway, he grows up in Brazil, his father dies young, while there. So they\nreturn to Italy. They return to Italy, he meets my mother\u2019s sister. Perfect marriage,July 27, 2017\nyou know, right kind of families, and so on, and they get married. He is a ch-\nchemist, and they are \u2014 she is mildly actively anti-fascist, he is not. He is of this\nfamily that was too conservative, and so on. Come the racial laws, he\u2019s insulted.\nYou know, he\u2019s simply insulted by this. And he says, why should I stay here? I\nhave all my friends in Brazil, whom I grew up with, when his father was, in fact,\nthe head of a community there, of a whole Italian financial community in Sao\nPaolo, which is the center of Italian business in \u2014 so he and his wife, my aunt, and\ntwo sons, go off to Brazil.",
        "A: Thirty-s \u2014 \u201938.",
        "A: They almost immedi \u2014 \u201938, maybe beginning of \u201939, but you know, almost\nimmediately for him it\u2019s not an issue of anything else. From the moment there are\nracial laws, he has all these friends there \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 any number of ways, goes, and they\u2019 ve \u2014 that family has lived in Brazil ever\nsince.",
        "A: One sister.\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: Her brothers, of course, stay. There\u2019s no reason for them to leave. The only\nother person to leave is a cousin on the side of the \u2014 my fa \u2014 my mother\u2019s mother,\nthis ancient, ancient line, whose uncle, double first cousin of my grandmother \u2014\ntwo brothers had married two sisters \u2014 was the great law professor in Italy.\nProfessor, dean, president of Rome University, the greatest law library in the\nworld, a fascist. The only fascist in the family. He actually was Minister of\nEducation for a short time. The family ostracizes him.",
        "A: His name was Giorgio Del Vecchio, Del Vecchio meaning Zekanym(ph), and\nhe was this great figure, still is. His books are all over Catholic universities and so\non. Roscoe Pound, the great dean of Harvard adored him because he was a\nfunctionalist. He made the law do what the \u2014 was needed now. Why? Because he\nwas a fascist. All the anti-fascists were formalists, using the law can\u2019t be changed\nto block this. So Roscoe Pound makes him a member of the American Academy,\nand so on. This guy, by the way, come 1943, is so famous that he just walks into\nthe Vatican, and is fine. That\u2019s how he is saved. But he was with great figure. His\nnephew, a brilliant young professor, already a full professor, says, we have livedJuly 27, 2017\noff this snobbery for 2,000 years. It has come home to roost. He\u2019s in opposition to\nhis uncle. I am going to Palestine.",
        "A: And he does. And he goes there, and he becomes the founder, in 1948, of the\nHebrew University Law School, and the teacher of everybody there; Aram\nBarak(ph), Yitzhak Englard, and so on.",
        "A: Also, strangely enough, Guido Tedeschi. Guy Tedeschi, because his father was\nAshkenazi, his mother was Del Vecchio. The story of how he lived there is\ninteresting, because he had to discover \u2014 there was no university for him to teach,\nhe had to discover some Sephardic ancestor, because there was a fellowship given\nto Sephardics, and he finds one on his mother\u2019s side, Ava Dzemorani(ph), and \u2014\nwho, his family started the first newspaper in Italy, my relatives, too. And anyway,\nwe just \u2014 I have it very much in mind because just two weeks ago I was in Italy,\nand one of the things that was going on in Italy was a great celebration of this man,\non the 110 anniversary of his birth, with all the people from Israel; Englard,\nArak(ph), all these people coming, and who were his students, and all other people\nin Italy celebrating this great scholar, who had gone. So he left. But he was a\ncousin, I mean \u2014\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: \u20141s a double second cousin, but cousin. My aunt left and went to Brazil, and we\nwent to America, mainly because we were anti-fascist. Everybody else stayed.",
        "A: Everybody survived.",
        "A: That is a series of stories which is the book that I am writing. And the stories are\nwonderful, and they are \u2014 they\u2019re interesting in themselves. But the most\ninteresting part of them are the motives of the people who saved them, in many\ninstances risking their lives to save them. And the people who saved them ranged\nfrom the poorest peasants, who didn\u2019t even know them, to, in some instances, to the\nwealthiest grandees, everything in between. People did things in Italy, which they\ndid nowhere else. Now, I don\u2019t mean to say there weren\u2019t some people who were\nterrible and did other things. I\u2019m just telling the story of my family, and every\nsingle blood relative of mine was saved. The family of Montini, who became pop \u2014\nPope Paul the sixth, saved one branch. They did it, why? And that\u2019s the interesting\nthing of this book, what were the motives? Sometimes it was sheer humanity,\nsometimes it was friendship, because we were friends. Sometimes it was gratitude,\nbecause we had done things for them. Sometimes it was fame. Respect for fame.\nJuly 27, 2017\nSometimes motives unknown. But every one of \u2014 I told you of the fascist, great\nscholar and so on, who walks into the Vatican, and \u2014 which was not open to\n[indecipherable] Jews. But he walks in, perfectly fine, continues his studies there.\nHis double first cousin, my great-uncle, who had been president of a Bocconi\nUniversity of Milan, economist Gustavo Del Vecchio, great economist, kicked out\nby the fascists, because he was anti-fascist. And he, with his sister, who had a\nhouse on Lake Como, gets in a boat, and goes to Switzerland. Switzerland is not\nopen, any more than the Vatican is. He gets off. The Swiss guard is ready to send\nhim back, he takes out a letter from Einaudi, who later becomes president of Italy,\nand who was his great pal, who was teaching at Zurich, inviting him to teach at\nZurich. The Swiss guards salute, send for a limousine, and he gets taken there.\nExactly the same thing as the other one, as his double cousin. This guy, anti-fascist,\nafter the war he comes back, becomes a cabinet minister in a postwar government.\nWhen one is up, the other is down. Analogous thing of how they were saved.\nFunny.",
        "A: O-Others just \u2014 a-and I\u2019Il tell you just one story, it\u2019s not \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 there are others that are more dramatic, but longer. My great-grandmother; my\nmother\u2019s mother\u2019s mother \u2014",
        "A: \u2014aremarkable woman, whom I remember well, because she was old, but alive\nin \u2014 before we left, and who may have been the only one in the family, who in\nsome way had some element of practicing Judaism. She would not convert when\neverybody else converted. Neither did her son, who was this great-uncle who went\nto Switzerland, but \u2014 because he \u2014 he would do what his mother wanted. She was\ntold to convert, she said, sono un \u2019Israelita, basta. I\u2019m an Israelite, enough. She\ntaught me a prayer.",
        "A: Which must have been a Jewish prayer.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember it.",
        "A: But I know she taught me a prayer. She sends her son and his sister away from\nher villa, and to go off to Switzerland. She is too old to survive, to go with them.\nShe is in her high 80s. And so she stays in this villa, and she says to her son, look,\nif you stay, they\u2019ll come and get us both. Especially because you\u2019re famous, soJuly 27, 2017\ntheyll find you here. Me, they may not pay any attention. And in any case, I\u2019m not\nlet \u2014 \u2019'm \u2014 she locked the house doors. I \u2014 so, but he had to go. Off he goes. When\nthe villa is liberated, she writes a 15 page letter to my mother, telling her how she\nsurvived. She writes it to my mother because she is her eldest grandchild, brilliant.\nAnd this remarkable woman, she was widowed at 23 with three children, looked\nafter everything, an amazing person. And wants the story to be told. And she tells\nthe story that she was there \u2014 and this is after 1943 \u2014 and an American plane that\nhad been bombing Bologna had somehow failed to drop all its bombs, and is trying\nto get up over the Apennines to go back home, and finds that a bomb it has let \u2014\nstill has, makes it difficult for it to get its height, and so opens the bomb thing, the\nbomb falls on the village next to the villa. It was during the day, everybody was out\nworking, so there weren\u2019t any real casualties, but the village is destroyed. My\ngrandmother says, so I did what any decent person would do, I invited the village\ninto the villa. And she said, every family got a room, and we set it all up, and I\ntaught all the women to work. She did wonderful needlepoint. And I taught the men\nto play poker. She was of a generation before bridge, it was what card playing\npeople would do. We had a wonderful time, she said, and she describes this\nwonderful thing, with the whole village living in the villa all together. This almost\n90 year old, tiny little person, just teaching. She was always a teacher, and doingJuly 27, 2017\nthese other things. And then she said, the Germans arrived. They had heard that\nthere was an old Jewish lady there. So they came to get me. And the village men\ncame out with pitchforks, hatchets, you know, and said to the German captain, over\nour dead bodies. They had been taken in. And the German captain looks at it, and\nrealizes that, of course, he could mow them down, but he\u2019s probably lose some\nmen, and it would be \u2014 and thinks, here\u2019s an almost 90 year old person, she\u2019s gonna\ndie anyway. It isn\u2019t worth it. And goes away.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how she survived.",
        "A: And that\u2019s one of the stories. The stories of the others are all different, all\nwonderful, and are part of the thing. I'll tell \u2014 just say two other things about that.\nOne, Beppe\u2019s father, the person whose great house it was, refused to hide.",
        "A: In Ferrara.",
        "A: And no one knows why he refused to hide. Some people say that he thought that\nif he was there and was taken, his children \u2014 they might leave his children alone.\nWhich, of course, would not have happened. No one knows. There is reason toJuly 27, 2017\nbelieve that he was the prototype for the old professor in \u201cThe Garden of the\nFinzi-Contini,\u201d who wouldn\u2019t hide because it was beneath them.",
        "A: This is \u2014 the book is being written \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 under the patronage of this guy\u2019s son, and somebody \u2014 some people have\nwritten \u2014 Sergio Minerbi, the guy \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 who has written in Israel, has written a family history, and he says it\u2019s true, I\ndon\u2019t know how he knows. But it\u2019s plausible that the model for that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 not hiding, because it \u2014 because \u2014 1n the garden it was because it was beneath\nthem. We don\u2019t know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 why this guy? He actually gets taken, and would have been sent off, taken by\nthe fascists, would have been turned over to the Germans, and would have been\nsent off. The story of how he is rescued by his chauffeur, 1s another wonderful\nstory, one version of which was written up in a book called \u201cAlberto Ms Longest\nDay.\u201dJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: Yeah. That book was written by my cousin, my double cousin \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the one I was telling you about before \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 who was a professor of geophysics, but was also a poet and an author. And he\nwrote this, which is pa \u2014 that story\u2019s partly fiction. That \u2014 how that happened is\npartly fiction, it was meant to be \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 a fiction, at the longest journey.",
        "A: But it\u2019s how this guy, who didn\u2019t try to hide, was none the less rescued by his\nchauffeur, who was a Figaro type, who could do anything, and did it. So \u2014 so that\u2019s\nanother. But anyway, these stories are something that when my book comes out,\nwill all be there, all of it. What I did want to say was, what happened to my\nmother\u2019s father, because it has some interesting things for my job as a judge,\nactually. In 1940, before America joins the war, my mother\u2019s father develops\ncancer, and he was, as I say, a neurologist, way back. Turns out not to be operable,\nthough probably \u2014 don\u2019t know why, but it was cancer, but sometimes it\u2019s curable,July 27, 2017\nbut it wasn\u2019t. He forbids anybody from telling my mother. This is a man,\nremember, who didn\u2019t want my mother to leave, but he forbids anybody from\ntelling my mother that he is sick, because he knows that if my mother knows that,\nshe\u2019ll get on the first ship and go back. And probably end up separated from her\nfamily.",
        "A: My mother first hears that he is sick in a telegram from the family saying that he\nis dying, in early 1941, before America is in the war. Italy is in the war now.",
        "A: And saying that he is dying. And so in \u2014 actually, she first hears from a telegram\nof condolences over fa \u2014 first from my father\u2019s sister, who is in Italy. And the thing\nis \u2014 interesting to me as a judge, because I\u2019ve seen cases \u2014 I\u2019ve sat on cases where\nthe board of immigration appeals and immigration judges said somebody, who said\nthey were persecuted, and has sought asylum, went back to their country, and then\ncame back. So it cannot be that they were being persecuted. And we had a case,\nand people on a panel with me, the other two judges, were ready to say obviously\nthat\u2019s so. And I said no, it\u2019s not obviously so. Of course it\u2019s relevant if the person\ngoes back, and you want to find out why. But I can tell you that that isn\u2019t\nnecessarily so, and here is this story. And so my panel held that you cannot make itJuly 27, 2017\nas a matter of law that somebody who goes back can\u2019t, you have to look to see why\nthey went back \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and so on. So those are a couple of stories. The others survived, as I say, in\nwonderful, mixed ways, and I \u2014",
        "A: That is true. And one of the reasons I want to write this, is because what\nhappened in Italy \u2014 and again, now some people, including some c-cousin of mine,\nare writing about the people in Italy who did betray, who did behave badly. But\nmore people were saved in Italy, than in any other country, with a possible\nexception of Denmark. And in Denmark it was the official policy of the king, and\npeople just followed it wonderfully, and people were saved. In Italy, what was\ninteresting about it was that it was against the policy of the government, and yet\npeople behaved in ways which saved people. Now, a fair number of people were\ntaken. About 10,000 people were taken in Rome, right after Italy surrendered,July 27, 2017\nbecause the Roman Jewish community was \u2014 there was an old community around\nthe old Italian temple, of people who were relatively poor, and still living there, as\nagainst all these assimilated people all over. They too didn\u2019t think that anything\nwas going to happen. And the Germans moved in, and took any number of them, a\nfew days, right after. And it\u2019s that that gave the signal, and everybody else went\nhid, afterwards. So it immediately, a fair number. So if you look a fair number of\npeople were taken. After that, very, very few people were taken, because Italians\nhid people. Why? That\u2019s part of the story of this book. I mean, sometimes, just\nhumanity. Sometimes \u2014 and you know, sometimes the churches hid people. The\ncardinal archbishop of Florence was maybe the only man to vote against Pius the\n12\" [indecipherable]. He was much loved by people, and they tell the story, which\nI repeat in the book, but it isn\u2019t my story, but \u2014 but he told all the monasteries and\nnunneries to hide people. And that some people were being hidden in a nunnery,\nwhich had been a closed nunnery, and there were men who were being hidden, and\n\u2014and young men and young nuns, and inevitably people started making love, and\nthe Mother Superior is said, according to the story, that is very popular with\nFlorentines, goes to the cardinal and says, terrible sins are being committed here,\nwe cannot have this going on. And the cardinal says, Mother, what do you think isJuly 27, 2017\nworse? What is happening there, or to turn people out to be killed? Don\u2019t worry\nabout it, 1t?s on me.",
        "A: Which is a lovely story, I mean \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, this is a story that is told there, and there are squares named after\nthis guy, and so on. So, yeah, you know, sometimes, as I say, it was just humanity.\nAnd there are people who \u2014 Italian peasants who hid Jews, partisans, anti-fascists,\nand then, when the war turned around, and Germans were running away, hid them.\nThey were all people in trouble, one said to me, when they came here. E tutti figli\nde mama, they were all some mother\u2019s child. We struggled for them.",
        "A: And it\u2019s a\u2014 you know, a very \u2014 there was something about that culture \u2014 and I\ndon\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t people who didn\u2019t, but there was something about that\nculture that caused people to save people. And by the way, it is the reason why\nalmost all Italian Jews who fled, went back.",
        "A: We did not. And a few others did not, but most people did go back to Italy, in a\nway that people did not go back to Germany, for sure, or Poland, or other\nJuly 27, 2017\ncountries, because the feeling that after all, that Italy has \u2014 and by the way, if you\nsaid \u2014 you know, somebody could say there were so few Jews in Italy, and they\nwere so assimilated, and so on \u2014 that was true in many other countries as well, but\n\u2014 but there are some figures that give the lie to that, because it\u2019s said that about\n10,000 Jews from Croatia, from the \u2014",
        "A: Who had been protected when it was Italian territory, and was a whole thing of\nGermans trying to find out whether these people were really Italians, or from\nsomeplace else, or something, but who were not at all Italian, they were \u2014 when\nItaly surrendered, fled into Italy from Croatia. And it\u2019s said that of these 10,000\npeople who fled, who were completely unassimilated, only eight people were\ntaken. So it \u2014 people were hidden. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something about \u2014 and who\nknows? I mean, you know, that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m writing this book, because\neach of us, in our lives, faces situations where we may be called on to do things,\nand there are always excuses. And these people were risking their lives.\nJuly 27, 2017\nwhose families might have been in Germany, for two, three hundred years, maybe\nmore, but they can trace back that much. And sometimes when I\u2019ve met them, they\nspeak English with a German accent. Some of them still speak very good German,\nyou know, it\u2019s their first language. And I will sometimes ask the question, so what\npart of you is German? And it\u2019s very hard to answer.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: A hundred percent. I mean, you know, my \u2014 I\u2019m a hundred percent Italian, I am\nJewish. I\u2019m a hundred percent American, because I have become American. And I\nhave stories about that. When I was talking to some students from foreign\ncountries, who were here on a program, and a kid from Pakistan who had grown\nup in \u2014 in Denmark, actually, said, you know, that\u2019s all very well, but which areJuly 27, 2017\nyou? And I said, I\u2019m both. And then he said something kind of fun, he said, okay,\nbut whom do your root for when there\u2019s a World Cup in soccer? And I \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. My answer was automatic. Of course I root for Italy. But if it were a\nworld cup in baseball, I\u2019d root for reuta \u2014 United States. And it\u2019s not that the\nUnited States is better in one than in the other. In the last World Cup, United\nStates was good and Italy was terrible. It\u2019s just that I associate one with Italy, and\nso then I\u2019m Italian. And I associate the other one with America, and so of course,\nI\u2019m a Yankee fan, of baseball. And that\u2019s the way that is. And I am in that sense,\nwhy didn\u2019t we go back? And that\u2019s an interesting story in itself, which has to do in\na way, with what\u2019s happened later, but think of it this way. Comes late 40s, 50s, my\nparents go back and see, and are undecided. My father probably is leaning towards\ngoing back.",
        "A: He who wanted to leave, but you know, fine. My mother may be more likely to\nwant to stay here, oddly, because my father had been able \u2014 his family, his sister\nand his mother, after the war, had joined us here, or were going to join us if we \u2014\nbut he thinks in terms of going back, maybe. He is having a career here, but yeah,\nyou know. My mother, oddly in some ways, because it is easier for a woman,July 27, 2017\nstrangely, to have a career in Italy than here \u2014 she couldn\u2019t get appointed to the\nYale faculty, though they tried, because women were not teaching at Yale at the\ntime. But she thinks if she goes back, people will not take her career seriously,\nbecause she is too much this elegant lady, you know, and that \u2014 but they\u2019re\nuncertain. So the thing falls, in many ways, on my brother and me. And my brother\nand I, separately, first he goes back, because he\u2019s older. Then a couple of years\nlater, I go back. And we both have the same reaction, that 1t would be horrible to go\nback to Italy and be poor, because this is after the war, and everything is still \u2014 but\nto go back to Italy and be who we were, with all the losses, because buildings were\nhit, things were not looked after, properties had to be put in other names\n[indecipherable] the Calabresi things to survive, because they didn\u2019t fit to that\ncategory, and so on. So we were not as rich, by any means, as we were before, but\nwe're still. But to go back and be wealthy, was something that we were too\nAmerican, too egalitarian to conceive of doing.",
        "A: We had become outsiders, coming to America, and to be insiders, as we would\nhave been there, was something that my brother and I, both instinctively, could not\ntake. I will tell you my own experience in that. I go with the chauffeur who saved\nAlberto M, who was still there. He drives me around to see the family lands.July 27, 2017",
        "A: 1951. I should have gone in \u201950, didn\u2019t go because of the breakout of the Korean\nwar. Drive around in the ancient family Lancia, which still exists. He\u2019s driving,\nI\u2019m sitting in what would be the driver\u2019s seat, because snobbery among Italians,\nyou have the driver on the English side, to copy English cars, although you\u2019re\ndriving \u2014 so, madness. So I\u2019m there, you know, thinking I\u2019m driving, as we go\nsweeping down. A little religious procession comes along, and they see the family\nLancia. They all pull to one side, and bow. I\u2019m a teenager. Who are these people\nbowing to me? We go by a church, and I say, that\u2019s a very beautiful church, and \u2014\nlittle tiny church \u2014 and the chauffeur says yes, you own it. Well, your cousin owns\nit. And the bell is even more beautiful, and of course, it\u2019s in Ferrara because it\u2019s\ntoo beautiful to leave out here. I can\u2019t take that. So we say to my parents, we want\nto stay. And that\u2019s what makes the decision.",
        "A: We stay. Because they were undecided, I mean, they really, essentially, left it up\nto us. The irony of this, of course, is that we did not see the great inequalities in the\nUnited States. Remember, blacks were not visible. It\u2019s before 1953, before Brown\nvs Board of Education. All the inequalities of the United States are kind of hidden\nto kids just growing up in a university town. In the meantime \u2014July 27, 2017",
        "A: Just over the horizon. In the meantime, in Italy, 1950, partly due to my great-\nuncle going to the cabinet and becoming Minister of the Treasury [indecipherable]\nthe great Italian miracle of the 50s and 60s, which changes Italy into an almost\ntotally middle class society. Today, all these land are owned by farmers. The\nchurch is a little museum owned by there, the bell is back there. We own nothing of\nthat. We\u2019re still well-off, but not the kind of feudal thing \u2014 in many ways, by 1970,\nItaly is a much more egalitarian society than is the United States. In some ways\nnot, less mobility, but in many ways. So that the irony of our decision was that we\nwere moved by very good things. Whether it the right one or not \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yeah, just say it, yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: And here is \u2014 and here 1s another contradiction.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah. First, let me just say one thing, because I want it on the record yet again, I\ndo this, somebody said that we came through Ellis Island. I don\u2019t know where they\ngot that idea.",
        "A: They made it up. They assumed it, and it sounds nice. I wish I\u2019d come through\nEllis Island. It was there. We did not come through Ellis Island. You went to Ellis\nIsland if you came steerage.",
        "A: If you came \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 you did not. We land in New York \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on September 16, a Saturday. And by the way, I was sworn in as a judge on\nthe 55\" anniversary, to the day.",
        "A: I picked the day because I wanted to say something about what America had\ndone for me, and what it hadn't done for others, and those who had helped us, and\nthose who had not, and to dedicate myself to do things for those whom America\nhad not helped. And David Souter, who 1s an old, old friend, cause we were on\nRhodes Scholarship selection committee before anybody knew who he was, who\nswore me in. This old, New Hampshire Yankee was in tears. So, we land, and\nwhat do you do? Well, from the ship, my father had \u2014 Mother had sent a telegram\nto a distant cousin, who was the only relative that we had here, who had been sent\nby the fascists to study law at Berkeley.",
        "A: No, he was just a kid. The reason he had been sent there was that the fascists\nhad sent a variety of people who were tall and good looking, because they didn\u2019t\nwant Americans to think of Italians as being short, squat southerners. So they sent\nthis very elegant \u2014 and as he said, shortly after he got here, they decided I wasn\u2019t\nItalian, because I was Jewish.",
        "A: Paolo Contini.",
        "A: He was a distant Finzi-Contini relative, but a somewhat closer Minerbi\nrelative.",
        "A: In some \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 complicated \u2014 his \u2014 Finzi-Contini said that from the first wife of Leon Vita,\nhis grandmoth \u2014 his mother and my grandmother Minerbi were first cousins, so\nthat that was the connection. And he was studying law at Berkeley. Having been\nsent there, he wasn\u2019t about to come back.",
        "A: And he stayed, and ultimately became deputy general counsel of the U.N., and\ndid other things. Ultimately died in a mountain climbing accident. A remarkable\nman. His daughter is a professor at UVA, and \u2014",

        "A: You were right, we have no money.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And so he sends back a name, the Hotel Raleigh, somewhere on the\nWest Side.",
        "A: In New York City. We land on a Saturday, go there. How cheap was it? My\nfather, who is not a pack rat, kept the bill for four people and supposed food, for\neach of two months \u2014 kept it for two months because he had two sons. Obviously\nhe was doing it for a purpose, 10 dollars.",
        "A: Ten dollars a month. Four people, with food. Not a nice place, but there we\nwere.",
        "A: Food supposedly included.",
        "A: I say supposedly because the food was awful, I found it almost impossible to\neat, because I\u2019d always eaten very [indecipherable]. I was difficult. Not difficult,\nbut you know, I was used to being \u2014 why do we stay in New York rather than\ncome to New Haven immediately? The fellowship doesn\u2019t begin til January, and\nmy father, correctly, thinks the licensure exams for medicine, in New York, have\nmore reciprocity than those of Connecticut. If you pass Connecticut, yeah,\nConnecticut will recognize it, but almost none \u2014 almost every state recognizes a\nNew York medical license. If we\u2019re going to starve, we might as well starve in\nNew York, as in \u2014",
        "A: You had to \u2014 I mean, you could, with the qualifications he had, take the exams,\nand if you passed the exams, you would be okay. Increasingly they made it\ndifficult. Increasingly they made it difficult. And interestingly, the exams in New\nYork were already making it difficult for people primarily who came from\nGermany, and they did that by having the language, have all sorts of words which\nwere Latinate words. Which of course, my father, who spoke German perfectly,\nand spoke English with a huge accent \u2014 German was his first lang \u2014 second\nlanguage, French was his third language, English he learned and knew well, but\nspoke like a cultivated Italian would, if you thought it should sound like German.July 27, 2017\nWhich was not good. My mother, instead, spoke English with an English accent,\nFrench was her second language, English her third language, because she had had\nan English governess. Have you any autumn apples? When she came, it was how\nshe spoke. But he found the language exam funnily easy, because of that. The other\nexams, what he worried about most was surgery. He had been an academic, so that\nmost other things to do with medicine, even if they weren\u2019t his field, he would\nknow. And as he said, he turned lucky in that, because the guy who was the\nexaminer in surgery, was one of the first people to do color \u2014 cardiovascular\nsurgery, to think about that. And he had read some articles of my father\u2019s as a\ncardiologist, and so knew who he was. And he said to him, I must give you a real\nsurgical question. It was an appendectomy, which even my father could handle.\nAnd then he said, now let\u2019s talk about interesting things, the future of\ncardiovascular surgery. So he passed that. And so he passed, flying colors, before\nthe end of December, so that in January, when we came to New Haven, he had his\nNew York license.",
        "A: Not bad. Now, how did we survive \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in these months. It\u2019s kind of any number of things. First, and P\u2019Il come back to\nit, my brother and I get put in school on Monday.",
        "A: What do you do with children?",
        "A: And story of that is another story in itself. The people at the consulate, Italian\nconsulate hear of it \u2014 my father, who is just already quite well-known person 1s\nthere. And a \u2014 there\u2019s some count or somebody there, who has heart trouble, and\nasks my father if he will look after him. My father says, I cannot do it for pay,\nbecause I\u2019m not licensed. You know, I can give you some advice. And there\narrived, at this scruffy hotel, every day, a huge thing of flowers. My mother \u2014 I\nremember her saying, he might have sent fruit. But they didn\u2019t imagine \u2014",

But he \u2014 she had signed affidavits for all sorts of people from\nGermany. And when, because of the connection between one of my grandparents\nand this guy, signed ours, saying, I know you'll never need anything. So, my\nmother goes to call on this lady, and she had jewelry, because we\u2019d hidden it in our\nthings. And this was not jewelry we had bought; if so they would have looked for\nit, but this was jewelry, so she \u2014 she said, I put on more jewelry than a lady should,\nand went to have tea, for \u2014 and said, our money has not yet arrived from\nSwitzerland, could you advance us something? This was technically true because\nmy father had given a lecture in Switzerland, and had gotten, I don\u2019t know, 50\ndollars, something like that, and that money had not yet arrived. So it had my \u2014 this\nwoman says, of course, and writes a check. I do not know the precise amount. TheJuly 27, 2017\nstory sort of is, and I had an impression that it was for 25,000 dollars. This is 1939.\nShe\u2019s thinking of people living in the way we lived in Italy. So of course. What do\nyou do with a check for 25,000 dollars at a time when you think the banks are still\nfailing? You know, it\u2019s true now we look back, the depression was over, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 nobody really knew it. We had no bank account anyway, but how could you \u2014\nsomething which we could never pay back. What do you do with it? Well, what\nyou do with it, there were a few other Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, some Jewish, some not, who\nwere there in New York, that was a small community of people, and some of them\nhad a little bit of money, because they had had money out of Italy. And of course,\neverybody who had that was just as \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 tight with it as could be. Among these people, by the way, was a woman\nnamed Kalabi(ph), who became, after the war, the head of the Italian Jewish\ncommunity in Italy. A great, great lady. A-And she was our first babysitter. She\ncame and \u2014 one time when my parents actually went to a movie, it was the only\ntime, and she was with us. Well, my parents gave this check to some people who\nhad money and said, give us a few hundred dollars, this check will be your security.\nAnd with these few hundred dollars, we had barely enough money to live. ComesJuly 27, 2017\nJanuary 1940, we moved to New Haven, the fellowship begins. It\u2019s a thousand\ndollars a year, which is the equivalent of about 20,000 dollars now.",

        "A: Perfectly decent.",

So you know, it\u2019s about \u2014 and we sent the check back, with a note saying, oh,\nterribly sorry, we found the money arrived, we didn\u2019t need to use it, but things\nhappened, so we didn\u2019t send \u2014 here it is. Fine. End of story? Irony of ironies, no.\nFast-forward to 1961.",

Once she catches me, and it is the source of what is a true statement that\nI said, when I came to America I knew three words of English, yes, no and\nbriefcase.

And our three year old, who was very durable, runs up to\nsome little children who were playing, and I kind of follow in the back, to see\nwhat\u2019s going on, to two little girls who are playing, and says something in English.July 27, 2017\nAnd they don\u2019t understand, and pick up their things, and go away.

Culture is different. So we \u2014 I \u2014 I am there,\nand \u2014 and then, how do I \u2014 what do I eat? Fortunately, when we have enough\nmoney so that we don\u2019t have to rely just on the food of this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 10 dollar a month thing, we discover the automats. Which were these\nwonderful 1930 things, all chrome and shiny and things and you put in 10 cents,\nand you got something. And this was fun for kids. And I discover chicken pot pie,\nwhich I thought was edible. And I survive on chicken pot pie and the nickel and the\nwonderful thing of it. And my parents, bless them, are \u2014 understand, you know, theJuly 27, 2017\nneeds, and I\u2019ll show you how much they did. My brother comes home \u2014 we arrive\nwearing little tweed coats, fur coats. Winter things in Italy, and we thought of\nAmerica that way, so you know, nicely, wonderfully elegant. My brother comes\nhome and says, I cannot wear this. My mother said \u2014 no one is wearing it, just, I\ncannot wear anything like this. My mother says, okay. With no money that we\nhave, she understands that this child is \u2014 and so we go to some five and dime\nsomeplace, to look for something. And she looks at all sorts of parka and things,\nshe said, they\u2019re all wearing parkas. And the \u2014 whatever, and we look, which fairly\ncostly, and good looking. And he said no, no, no, no. And he then sees something\nwhich is a quite ugly, black and green kind of pressed something or other thing,\nwhich is very cheap, and he says, that\u2019s what everybody\u2019s wearing. And my mother\nsays, okay, and buys it for him. Turns to me and says, do you want one? And I said,\nnot on your life. I mean, I\u2019m not fitting in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 anyway, and so on. And \u2014",
        "A: What?",
        "A: He was.\n101\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: He was. And \u2014 and that made him, in some ways, more American. He remained\nvery \u2014 he was \u2014 you know, he was my idol. He was a wonderful person. He \u2014 he\njust made my life. But he did fit in more. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t, and I learned English there\nand at home from my mother, which is why I had the slight accent.",
        "A: But, I do have a slight accent. Somehow, you know, we survive, and come\nJanuary, we go to New Haven.",
        "A: My father was born in 1903, he was 36.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And my mother was a year older.",
        "A: Thirty-seven.",
        "A: And my father, by the way, had \u2014 and this became a problem \u2014 he had been an\nassociate professor. In 1936, very, very young for Italian, he had written a book on\ncardiology, one of the founding books on ki\u2014 electroca-cardiographs, and things,\nwhich had won the gold medal for the best scientific book of the year. And there\nwas a competition for a full professorship. His chief was part of the commission,\nand had the other two votes, the commissioners, five, to put him in. But said, I\u2019m\ngoing to be here next year as well, with the same committee, and there\u2019s somebody\nsenior to you. If I put you in this year, this other guy will never make it. Will \u2014 do\nyou mind being put off for a year? My father said, of course not. The next year the\nfascists were strong enough so that they could block it. Whether it was that he\nwouldn\u2019t take a loyalty oath, or something, I don\u2019t know. But the next year, when\nhe should have gone through, he didn\u2019t. With the result that we came before he be \u2014\nwas a tenured, full professor.",
        "A: That would have made maybe some difference here. It certainly would have\nmade a difference after the war, in terms of Italy. But it certainly made life more\ndifficult, because he didn\u2019t have a title. And, you know, when I was offered,\nextremely young, a full professorship at Chicago, in my first year of teaching, and\ndecided to turn it down, because I wanted to stay at Yale, well they couldn\u2019t\nJuly 27, 2017\npromote me immediately, I told the dean, I know it\u2019s all right, but you must\nunderstand that psychologically it\u2019s more difficult for me. And he did some\nwonderful things about comforting me in this. And then I became a full professor\nin a year or two later, very, very young still, but it was part of, again \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of the history.",
        "A: Yeah, part of that. So, in January, we come to New Haven, to be \u2014 for this\nfellowship. Now first \u2014 I didn\u2019t know it at the time, and my parents never told me,\nbut recently, a dean of a medical school found the letter from the head of the\ninternal medicine, to my father, telling him his fellowship was there, and he could\ncome on such and such a time, and what it was. And sent me this letter. A copy of\nthis letter.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah, about three, four years ago.",
        "A: Well, now maybe \u2014 you know, could now be 10. But was at some point a dean\nfound it in the files and sent it to me, but just \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 decades \u2014 decades after. It\u2019s the most insulting letter you can imagine.",
        "A: It said, somebody has given us money to give you a fellowship, and so we\u2019re\ndoing it. Try to get them to give us more money. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll be able to\nstay more than this time, and don\u2019t think you can do this, this, this or this. You\u2019ve\nbeen given this fellowship, we\u2019ve been given the money, but essentially said, we\ndon\u2019t really like people like you.",
        "A: Yeah. Understand that this was a Yale that at this time had never had either a\nCatholic or a Jewish full professor in Yale college. It wasn\u2019t until 1946 that Yale\nhad a Catholic or full professor \u2014 or Jewish full professor in Yale college. Harvard\nwasn\u2019t much before that, it was when Conant became president, which is one of\nthe reasons Harvard got so far ahead of Yale, because Conant became president\nbefore the war, and so all the refugees could go to Harvard. Schumpeter, the\ngreat economist, wanted to come to Yale, but couldn\u2019t, had to go to Harvard. HeJuly 27, 2017\nhad many friends among the economists at Yale, but this was Yale college. The\nlaw school was different, and had been different forever \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to its glory. At Yale. It had a Jewish full professors, Catholic professors,\nCatholic acting dean, in the 19\" century admitted women. The law school was\nalways the troublemaker, which is why I love it, and always different. The medical\nschool, slightly different. The dean of the medical school, Winternitz, was Jewish.\nSome said very anti-Semitic, but he was Jewish. There were some Jews on the\nfaculty. Still an enormous quota, I mean, you know. The first person in the class\nwas always Jewish, because to be Jewish, to be admitted to the medical school, you\nhad to be \u2014 but \u2014 but at least it was mildly open, but \u2014 but just barely, in the\nmedical school. And apart from the dean, I don\u2019t know that there were any full\nprofessors who were Jewish, but anyway.",
        "A: This was where my father was attached, the fellowship was to the medical\nschool. The person he was working with, Arthur Geiger, who was in cardiology,\nwas Jewish, was not a full professor, was an associate professor. But \u2014 so it\u2019s not\nsurprising that this letter, that a previous president of Yale, who had just left a few\nyears before, James Rowland Angell, was a fascist and worse. I mean, he actually\nJuly 27, 2017\nwrote a letter saying, if there could be something like what happened to the\nArmenians in New Haven and Bridgeport, we might be able to save our Nordic\nheritage. This was not uncommon, with Lowell at Harvard, and Butler at\nColumbia. You know, it was the way people thought at that time. So I say, the law\nschool was different, we had nothing to do with the medical school, was slightly\ndifferent, and so on. That\u2019s where my father, because a fellowship had \u2014 money\nhad been given to them, and maybe the Dazien(ph) foundation was doing this\nbecause they wanted to open it. Who knows why they gave it here. But \u2014 so, we\narrive. And the real estate agent comes to try to find us a place to rent, a little house\nto rent, and immediately shows us places on Worcester square, which was where\nthe Italians lived, or in Westville, where the Jews lived. And we get shown places\nthere, and the people from the medical school kind of sweep in, and say no. What\nthey essentially said, you are ethnically Yale.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t ethnic, I mean, you live between Whitney Avenue and Orange Street,\nbetween the park and Edward Street, because that\u2019s where all the fellows, assistant\nprofessors, young Yale faculty live. And so they found us a nice little house, still\nthere, in that area. An area, by the way, which is still today full of Yale fellows,\nassistant professors and so on. Now, ethnically of every ethnicity, but still remainsJuly 27, 2017\nthe place \u2014 the full professors lived across the street in bigger houses, or here or\nthere. But that was the area where young faculty members lived. Which 1s perfectly\nfine [indecipherable] they said, you know, this is what you are. Now imagine we\narrive there, everybody who is there, is a WASP. We have in common with them\nthat they are faculty and academic, but ethnically, culturally, extraordinarily little.",
        "A: And, if you look then to the Jewish community, we had almost nothing to do\nwith people who were wonderful, mainly Ashkenazim. Couldn\u2019t believe that we\nwere Jewish, that my father, particularly the \u2014 he took, when he would see them,\nthe medical school and so on, as patients, to speaking to them in German, because\nthen they thought, oh then maybe this person sp \u2014 speaks an odd dialect of Yiddish.\nTo convince them that actually \u2014 you know, because \u2014 and the Italian community,\nalmost all southern; very, very poor.",
        "A: Southern Italy. A-Again, very little to do with this. Now, with one odd\nexception. There were a few left wing anti-fascists who had been ostracized by the\ncommunity because the fascists had played very much this \u2014 you must be more\nfascist than the fascists if you\u2019re here and so on. And these people, when they heardJuly 27, 2017\nthat my father had arrived, knowing about him and his anti-fascism, were so\nthrilled at having somebody who was a \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and a kindred spirit and cultivated, that several of them made him executor of\ntheir wills, even though he was a doctor and knew nothing about law. And there\nwas a barber named Malefronte(ph). I \u2014 I remember, I just met somebody who was\nthe granddaughter of this barber\u2019s partner, and said, you know, I think that \u2014 so it \u2014\nand my parents got very much involved in the doing things for the Italian\ncommunity. But we were part of, in a way, nothing. My mother became the first\nItalian member ever, of something called the Cerco Il\u2019Italiano, which was a group\nof elderly Yankee women who read Dante and other things. But they\u2019d never had\nan Italian having \u2014 for friend, that they should.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",

        "A: Immediately. Immediately.",
        "A: Even \u2014 even before the garden, or before anything. I mean, they all know who\nwe are.",
        "A: We are who we are. We arrive here and we are outsiders, unknown, and \u2014",

        "A: In\u20141in an odd way, we \u2014 we know we are outsiders, and that we are ourselves,\nand that we will take the best that there is, and give the best that we can, to all of\nthese, but we don\u2019t belong.",
        "A: We don\u2019t belong. And that\u2019s one of the things, when I said why we don\u2019t go\nback. Somehow my brother and I know we are outsiders, and kind of relish it.July 27, 2017",
        "A: We would belonging. We\u2019d immediately fit in. When I studied in England, the\nend of two years, they offered me a fellowship, which would have been the end of a\ncareer, having a fellowship at Magdalen College, that\u2019s it, 1n economics, perfect. I\ndidn\u2019t want to take that, problems with economics, but partly because I would\nimmediately fit in a category of society, and \u2014 there, and I said, if I wanted to fit\nsomewhere, I\u2019d go back to Italy, you know? There, the moment I\u2019m there, Anne\nsays I melt into the woodwork when I go over.",
        "A: Yes. I mean, it just is. 1am. Everybody knows who I am. In an odd kind of way,\nit\u2019s a small country. Everybody knows. When we went to Rome on sabbatical, we\nwent to Rome because there weren\u2019t many \u2014 my great-aunt and great-uncle were\nthere, but they were much older, and we wanted to make our own friends, and so\non. We made friends, and we found, inevitably, that the people we liked were\npeople whose grandparents were on the same side of this fight or that with my\ngrandparents, and you know, it \u2014 it\u2019s that kind of a country. Well here, we were\nnothing.",
        "A: And one \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And now \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and there\u2019s some funny things about this. When my brother\nmarried Celia, who as I say, was my classmate in elementary school, because I\nwon a fellow \u2014 a scholarship to a little private school here, and she was in that\nclass. My then college roommate, who was from New Haven, and so on, said, oh, I\nam so \u2014 my parents are so glad. And I said, why would they care? I mean, what\nthey \u2014 and he said, because people ask them who your roommate is at Yale, and \u2014\nwe had three roommates \u2014 and I \u2014 and I tell them, somebody named Guido\nCalabresi, and my parents\u2019 friends, business types, said, who are they? And now\nmy parents can say, oh, he is married to these people. So, to them, this was a way\nof saying, there is now \u2014",
        "A: He\u2019s somebody. And now, I don\u2019t know the extent to which both my brother\nand I \u2014 and maybe my parents, but my brother and I, have wanted, unconsciously to\nrebuild here, what we had there. Somebody has seen the farm where I live, which is\nvery beautiful, which we got \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 somewhere here, in Woodbridge, yeah. And \u2014 and it\u2019s a beautiful place. We\ngot it for almost nothing when we were first married, but it was \u2014 it\u2019s a huge\nnumber \u2014 amount of land, and an 18\" century house, and it\u2019s been made \u2014 we\u2019ve\nworked at it, and it\u2019s really beautiful. And somebody who was studying at the law\nschool, who 1s a writer, wrote a book in which he said, this house, which looks like\na villa in Tuscany. And I said to him, you\u2019re right and you\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s not in\nTuscany, and it\u2019s outside of Bologna. But it\u2019s, in a way it\u2019s rebuilding my\ngrandparents\u2019 villa outside there. So there is some side of people like me, who must\nrebuild and reestablish, so that now, you know, I\u2019m an outsider in some ways, and\nyet, people know me and our children and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: Yes. And in some ways, I really still am. It\u2019s a funny business. I teach a course\nwith a judge on our court, who is a good friend, who was chief judge. He\u2019s younger\nthan I am, and I teach a seminar with him. His name is John Walker. He is H.W.\n113July 27, 2017\nBush\u2019s first cousin. And he is as much an insider as you can imagine in that \u2014 some\nways in his legal career and so on. And \u2014 and says that every once in a while I do\nthings which puzzle this guy.",
        "A: No, I mean Anne, my wife \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 says that, and it\u2019s clear that they puzzle him, because they are not what a\nYankee American would do. He\u2019s come to see us in Italy, and when he\u2019s come to\nsee us, he now understands far more. When he, every once in a while, he does act \u2014\nhe\u2019s a nice man, a friend, but he does act as if who \u2014 what is this guy doing? And at\nthat point my wife, who is even more old, old, old, old Yankee than he 1s, kind of\nlooks at him, to say, you keep your place, youngster. But it is \u2014 it is there, and I\nthink it is one of the things that has made me both useful and successful and open.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s a much deeper thing.",
        "A: It\u2019s a much deeper thing. I mean, discrimination, were there some? Yes, of\ncourse, there were. And it\u2019s kind of interesting to see. I got \u2014 we went to the publicJuly 27, 2017\nschool that was right there, and it was a public school which then, as now,\nprimarily have broader things, but have many, many children of young Yale,\nbecause of where it was. And \u2014 and the local Boy Scout troop is the same way, you\nknow, all these things were this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 little kind of Yale WASP centered thing. At some point, the Foote school,\nwhich was a wonderful private school, made really wonderful by the fact \u2014 by one\nfact of discrimination, that Yale had no women teachers, so that many of the\nteachers in this little private school were the wives of professors, and immensely\nlearned, and interesting and so on. You know, you had a level of teachers that was\nfantastic. In seventh grade, I get a scholarship there. My parents are uncertain about\nprivate schools, because in Italy private schools were \u2014 but the fact that it was an\nall day, and anyway, the headmistress, who was English, and who was a wonderful\nlady, told them, this really is better level of education and so on. Why did I get that\nfellowship \u2014 that scholarship. Affirmative action, but not because I was Jewish, not\nbecause I was Catholic, not because I was Italian, even though I probably was\nabout the only person, maybe one or two others \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of that. Was because I was a boy, and in seventh grade, enough boys went off\nto prep school away, that they needed boys, and so they looked to this public\nschool, and here was this kid. Because, when I came to New Haven, I went back to\nsecond grade, I was doing things back at the level, and clearly they \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and so that\u2019s why I got the scholarship. I was there, in this school, which was\nall the really major professors. A classmate of mine was Sally Griswold, the\ndaughter of a guy who became president of Yale, and we became, you know, very\nclose friends. This was the whole entourage there, and lawyers, great lawyers, and\nso on. My wife was two years behind me in school. And so, what happens? In those\ndays, when you get to high school, the mothers of daughters would have dances at\nChristmastime, at vacation time, to which proper, eligible people \u2014 boys \u2014 would be\ninvited. It was just the way it was, you know, you \u2014 a-and they\u2019d have dances in\ntheir homes, and things. It\u2019s kind of interesting, some invited me, and some did not.\nAs it happened, my wife\u2019s family invited me, because they were people who were\nnot bigots, and they were friends of the guy who became president of Yale, and\nwhose daughter was my friend, and of Gene Rostow, who became the first \u2014 not\nthe first Jewish dean, but a Jewish dean of the law school. And \u2014 you know, they\nknew, and they knew, in a way, who we were. There were people who were very\n116July 27, 2017\nopen, and people who were less so. I can\u2019t say I really noticed or cared, because\nour attitude, in a way, was very snobbish.",
        "A: My family.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean, you know, we thought, we were who we were when you people\nwere painting yourselves blue.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and so but, in a way, we were \u2014 an-and the fact that we didn\u2019t belong,\nmeant that we would be friends with everybody, but in some ways we also thought\nthat we were outsiders because we were better than everybody. Which isn\u2019t nice.\nBut it is part of, at the same time, a feeling that we had to achieve, because if\nanything happened to my father and mother, there we were, at least until after the\nwar, and not immediately after the war, but when things started getting put back\ntogether again.",
        "A: And you feel both \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But it \u2014 it \u2014 and you know, the odd thing is, if you are that way, you \u2014 it really\ndoesn\u2019t matter. I mean, we had a \u2014 my parents had a very, very hard time making it\nhere. Ultimately they did. Ultimately my father became a full professor. Ultimately\nthey were recognized in their fields, but they had a very, very hard time. And I\nsometimes thought we were outsiders and felt like this, because they were having a\nhard time. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, and my example of that is Hanna Gray, who\nbecame president \u2014 provost at Yale, president of Chicago. Was a couple of years\nahead of me, at this same school. Oh, by the way, this English headmistress was\ndelighted that she had people who were Italian Jewish, and so on, because she was\nsomebody who wanted that, and so on. When Hanna was provost, and we were\nfriends, because of \u2014 they were at dinner \u2014 lunch at our house once, and I said \u2014 we\nJuly 27, 2017\nwere talking about the experience coming, and I said, but of course, 1t was very\ndifferent for you, because her mother was Jewish, her father was a great German\nhistorian, whose chair at Heidelberg was paid for by the Rockefeller, had been\ngiven by the Rockefeller in 1930s. Because his wife was Jewish, they decided to\nleave, and Rockefeller found \u2014 whether it was the Rockefellers or a foundation,\nsaid to American universities, whichever one of you wants [indecipherable] Hajo\nHolborn was his name, we will give the chair \u2014 move the chair there. And he\nwasn\u2019t Jewish, so Yale was perfectly willing to have him an-and it was a great,\ngreat story, and so the chair was here, and the \u2014 and so I said to Hanna, I expect\nyour experience was very different from ours, because you came, and your father\nwas a full professor already, with his chair and that, so on, and \u2014 and she looked at\nme, and she said, you\u2019re absolutely wrong. And she described her feelings, and her\nfamily\u2019s feelings of being outsiders, 1n exactly the same way. Because it was that\njust this sense of there you were somebody, here you are nobody. And this is \u2014 it\u2019s\nodd. Bob Dahl, the great political scientist, wrote a book called \u201cWho Governs?\u201d\nin which one of the things that he does, is talk about who are the social elite, the\npolitical elite, the financial elite, the academic elite in a town. And in New Haven,\nhe defines these in good political scientist terms [indecipherable]. Financial elite,\nanybody who is on the board of directors of any one of different companies.July 27, 2017\nPolitical elite, anybody who is [indecipherable] certain positions, selectman, or\nwhatever, or selectmen in towns and \u2014 and things of that sort. Fine \u2014 social elite,\nanybody who goes to what used to be the debutante ball in New Haven, a big\ndance. And academic elite, anybody who\u2019s full professor. Finds only one person\nwho is all four. Me. The outsider. Nice irony. Why all four? Well, academic elite,\neasy. Political elite, at some point the town of Woodbridge wants to ask me to run\nas a \u2014 for selectman. Democrats don\u2019t win, but there is minority representation, you\nhave to have a certain number of things. I\u2019m not particularly interested, I\u2019m saying\nI\u2019m in Europe on sabbatical, but if you put my name down, they need a name.\nThere are Italian Americans living in Woodbridge who always vote republic,\nbecause the Irish are democratic. They know an Italian name, vote for it. Why\ndidn\u2019t the democrats do that before? Because if you do that, all the Yale people,\nand the Jewish psychiatrists and so on, wouldn\u2019t vote for that one. For me, of\ncourse, they all vote. So, easy, I somehow get elected and spend some years doing\nthat. Financial elite, they\u2019re looking for somebody, two parts of a bank are fighting\nwith each other. They\u2019 ve never had an Italian on the bank. Compromise, let\u2019s not\nfight, let\u2019s put somebody who\u2019s totally an outsider on the bank. So I end up being a\nbank director, because I was a full professor, young and Italian, ever looking for a\nbank. And social elite, yeah. All the people who get asked by girls who are coming\n120July 27, 2017\nout, to be their escorts, then get asked to this dance. And since my friends in school\nwere the ones who were \u2014 so \u2014 and yet I\u2019m an outsider in all of them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. And when my son, our children were growing up, at some point I was\nsaying to Massimo, our youngest, how his older sisters, who seem to be so\nsuccessful, and this was this younger kid, and the first \u2014 the only guy with these\ntwo very powerful sisters. And so I said to him, you know, they \u2014 that, you have\ninsecurities, but realize that your sisters each have insecurities, and I started talking\nabout their insecurities, and he understood. And then, being a bright little boy, he\nturned to me, and he said, and what are your insecurities, Daddy? And I\nimmediately said, I\u2019m a refugee. I\u2019m a refugee. I\u2019m an outsider. And I \u2014 by the\nway, I say being a refugee is the most important part of my legal education,\nbecause it shows me what it means to be an outsider, which is very important if\nyou\u2019re gonna be a lawyer and a judge. Say, I\u2019m a refugee. And he immediately\nsays, of course, of course. And so is Uncle Paul, only he deals with it in a different\nway from you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But he\u2019s so \u2014 he must have been 13 \u2014 12, 13.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But he saw when I said that, that of course, there are all sorts\nof things that I still feel outside, and so did Paul, but that we dealt with it in\ndifferent ways [indecipherable]",
        "A: Different ones at different times, you know? In an odd way, I have both felt\nbeing outsider because of each of these \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 at different times.",
        "A: And also, I have used each of these. For instance, when I was dean, to reach out\nto different groups, because I saw my parents, though they had nothing directly in\ncommon, reaching out to help people in the Jewish community, help people in the\nItalian community. My mother was a Knight of the Italian Republic after the war,July 27, 2017\nfor all she had done for Italian Americans here. Reaching out to the academic\ncommunity, reaching out to all of these, and giving to them of that, so that you feel\nboth apart and outside, but a duty to do something for [indecipherable]. It helped,\nyou know. When I was dean, there were all sorts of people who are Italian\nAmericans, who are Jews, who are this, who are that, who are the other. And they\u2019d\nsee a dean who was also that.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: There\u2019s a \u2014 there\u2019s a man, Iacobucci, who became a justice of the Canadian\nsupreme court, dean of the law school at Toronto, and acting president of the\nUniversity of Toronto. The first time I met him, he said to me, Guido, you don\u2019t\nknow how much you meant to me. I said, why? And he said, I was a young kid at\nthe univer \u2014 at law school in Toronto, and I came home one day, I loved law, and I\nsaid to my parents, I want to be a [indecipherable]. And they said, you can\u2019t. And\nI said why? And he \u2014 his parent said, because you\u2019re an Italian and in Canada and\nToronto \u2014 then. Toronto is very different now, but then, you know, that can\u2019t be. I\ntook out of my pocket, an article in the \u201cNew York Times,\u201d how Guido Calabresi\nhad become the youngest full professor of the history of a Yale law school, and twoJuly 27, 2017\nor three youngest in the history of Yale. I said, if that can happen to an Italian at\nYale, it can happen here. So, you are, you know. If you know that all of these\nthings can be of use to others, you then relish every one of these feelings of being a",
        "A: The first thing is that every refugee is an outsider. And that\u2019s the fundamental\nthing. The second is that it has always been the case that there have been people\nwho helped, and I can tell you, and when I was sworn in, I n-named them by name.\nZiegler Sargent of the Sargent lock company, who went out of his way to help\nthese little Italian boys \u2014 became a \u2014 a very good friend of my parents, as a result.\nAnd there are people who stand in your way. And \u2014 but if you worry about the\npeople who stand in your way, you hurt yourself. But if you instead are grateful for\nthose who help, and then help others in your situation, that makes you something\nthat makes this country better. You \u2014\n124July 27, 2017\nwhen a refugee will come to a foreign country, they feel so strange and so much\nand outsider, and so \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay, this is very important, and it\u2019s a great piece of luck. Because of this\nfellowship at Yale, and because we were able to hang on and stay here, we were\nnot part of the Italian refugee community that was centered in New York. We\nknew them, or some, in Boston, a few different places, either of anti-fascists, or of\nJews. We knew them, we were a part of them, we had been with them. We would\nsee them from time to time, so that I went to call on the mother of the Rosselli\nbrothers, who had been \u2014 who was living \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in Larchmonts(ph), because that, you know, we did, but \u2014 but we were not\npart of it, and so we did not close in, in the way such a community does. You s \u2014\nthose people almost all went back, remained something to themselves, because it\nwas much easier than dealing with this strange, American world. Because we were\nhere, and alone, we couldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019ve seen that in other ways. I have a law\nclerk, who is now dean of a law faculty at Cornell, named Eduardo Penalver,\nwhose family fled Cuba. His father did not want to stay either in Florida, or inJuly 27, 2017\nNew Jersey where the main Cuban \u2014 went to Washington State, doctor \u2014 that\nfamily \u2014 these people are brilliant, wonderful, have done all sorts of things. They\u2019re\nmuch more open, because they had to deal with the rest of the world, and weren\u2019t\nable to look in on themselves, and on their troubles, and on their grievances, which\nare real. As we could have, had we been part of that little New York community.\nSo that was something which I don\u2019t think my parents were especially aware. I\nthink they understood afterwards, that they were doing things which might be hard,\nbut that they were much more interesting than had they been part of that\ncommunity.",
        "A: Yeah, so first, you know, you come to New Haven, you come to this little house\non Willow Street, which is still there. It was the old farmhouse for that area. Nice\nlittle house, wooden, very simple.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Slightly different. They still had an icebox in those days, and a \u2014 the Hygienic\nIce Company brought the \u2014 a month or two after we are there \u2014 maybe just a\nJuly 27, 2017\nmonth, even, the wife of a distinguished professor comes to call on my mother,\nbecause in those days Yale was small enough so that new faculty member \u2014 and\nfellows were considered faculty members \u2014 gets called on by the wife \u2014 always the\nwife, because it was \u2014 the wife calls on the wife, the senior faculty member in some\nother department. I\u2019m home from school, and I\u2019m playing \u2014 sort of myself, cars or\nsomething, and my mother is giving this lady tea. And this lady asks her how she\nlikes America, and my mother says, oh, it\u2019s very nice. And then the person,\nlooking to make conversation says, and what do you think of the plumbing? I\nunderstand that she means, isn\u2019t 1t wonderful to have indoor plumbing, because she\nthinks of Italians as people who don\u2019t. My mother doesn\u2019t understand. She just\ndoesn\u2019t understand. Then, she thinks she understands, and she says, of course, it\u2019s\nvery simple \u2014 compared to a marble bathroom, the sort of thing which is absolutely\nnormal in Milan, and thing. But after all, what should one expect? And I can tell\nthat she\u2019s thinking, at least you don\u2019t have Indians firing at us. She\u2019s just as\nprovincial in her way as the other one is in a way. And I don\u2019t \u2014 I, instead, already\nunderstand what each one of them is [indecipherable] say.",
        "A: Because I\u2019ve been 1n school, you know.July 27, 2017",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And I never tell my mother this, because she would have been\nupset, because she didn\u2019t want to be \u2014 say something rude, but it was. Neither\nunderstood the other, and it was perfectly fine. So that\u2019s how we are as insider\noutsiders. My father is at the medical school, and has this extraordinarily dreadful\naccent, because of which it\u2019s very hard to understand him. He knows the language\nvery well, and he is hanging on by his fingernails.",
        "A: He is a great \u2014 he\u2019s a great doctor as well as scientist. He never writes the kinds\nof things here, and does the kind of research here that he was doing in Italy, which,\nyou know, people said this was Nobel prize type of stuff. But never does that here.\nBut he comes to be loved by students because of what he does. But he is certainly\nnot \u2014 he\u2019s at the fringes, and not appreciated in any way at all. My mother \u2014 oh,\nthey decide that if you\u2019re going to \u2014 if we\u2019re going to stay here, it would be useful\nto have American degrees. So my father, because of the chairman of public health,\na wonderful man, c-a-o \u2014 C.O.A. Winslow, or something like that, liked him, saw\nthat he was special. And public health was kind of a hobby. Says to my father,\nlook, take a few courses, when you write an article about something and we\u2019 ll work\nJuly 27, 2017\nit out so you get a doctorate. And so my father gets a doctorate in public health,\nwith his left hand, thanks to this guy. It\u2019s only \u2014 remains only a hobby. My mother\ninstead, whose field in Italy was philosophy of art [indecipherable] is her\ndissertation, so decides to go to graduate school at Yale. She starts out teaching at\nwhat is now Southern Connecticut, it was Teacher\u2019s College at the time, to earn\nsome money while we\u2019re here. She gets fired in 1941, when America goes in the\nwar, because suddenly people decide \u2014 realize that you\u2019re supposed to be a citizen\nto teach in a state college. And everybody\u2019s desperate, but there\u2019s nothing to be\ndone about it. And anyway, she goes and she teaches \u2014 she decides that she\u2019s gonna\nget a degree in French, because a French \u2014 German-French department, Henri\nPeyre, was a brilliant, interesting scholar, and she\u2019d always been interested in\nlinguistics and literature. So she gets a doctorate in French. And \u2014 and that becomes\nher field. The head of the French department wants her appointed to the Yale\nCollege faculty. It is said, and I can\u2019t prove it, that 1t goes all the way to the\ncorporation, which says no. We have no women teachers \u2014 no women students in\nthe college, how can we have women teachers? Logic on logic. So she goes and\nteaches at Connecticut College in New London, then Connecticut College for\nWomen. Interesting story about marriage and things. I say to my mother years later,\nwhen my mother says, you know, I\u2019d wanted to do two things in my life. ThreeJuly 27, 2017\nthings. Teach, write and look after my family. Because I wasn\u2019t in a research\nuniversity, I could only do two at a time, and she taught and looked after her\nfamily. When she retired \u2014 actually, after the war, she \u2014 Yale is still closed to her,\nshe moves from Connecticut College, to Albertus Magnus, a Catholic college\nhere, because it\u2019s right nearby, and it\u2019s not as fancy. We don\u2019t need it as a backup\nany more, but she continues to teach. When she retires, she starts to write, and she\nwrites \u2014 well, a book that she wrote in French. We found a letter from the head of\nthe Ecole de France when she died suddenly in Italy, saying from now on\nReynaud(ph) scholarship begins with you, so she was able to do that. But I asked\nher why they didn\u2019t both leave and go to a research university. And I said, is it\nbecause in those days, women followed men? And Papa was here, and he wanted to\nstay here. And she laughed and she said, oh no. What happened was that when this\nhappened, your father was furious, and wanted to leave.",
        "A: At Yale. Wanted to leave and tried both to go to research universities. And she\nsaid, but I wouldn\u2019t let him. And I said, why? And she said, I wouldn\u2019t let him\nbecause here he was hanging on by his fingernails, and despite his accent, people\nwere beginning to appreciate him. Not as the scholar he was, but as a teacher, as a\nclinician, as a wonderful clinician. And here I thought he would ultimately make it.July 27, 2017\nI thought if we went someplace else, he wouldn\u2019t. And I knew that I was the\nstronger, and the more flexible, and that I could deal with it. And she was a brilliant\nwoman, and could. Her way of teaching is more like mine than my dad\u2019s. My mom\n\u2014 it gets complicated, but you \u2014 and I said well, but how did you keep them, if \u2014\nyou know, as a matter of principle, and she smiled and she said, I made a scene.\nAnd when my mother made a scene, it was a scene. And she said, I said to him,\nMassimo, you made me leave Italy in a matter of principle, and I left my family,\nmy friends, and everybody. And you were right. But it was very costly. Now, I\u2019m\nbeginning to make friends here \u2014 she couldn\u2019t have cared less, okay \u2014 and you want\nus to leave again, on a matter of principle. This one\u2019s on me. We stay. What could\nhe do? And then she looked at me quite fiercely, and she said, but you must never\ntell him. Okay, my mother dies suddenly \u2014",
        "A: \u20141n Italy. She was almost 80. My father was giving some lectures, she had gone\nthere, she had tea with a friend, and her friend said, you look happy. She said, it\nwas easy to be happy if you\u2019re fortunate in your daughters-in-law, has a heart\nattack and dies. My father is upset and doesn\u2019t want to talk about her for months.\nThen finally, one evening I\u2019m having dinner with him \u2014 he survives her by about\nfive years, six years. He says to me, you know, your mother was a great lady. And I\n131July 27, 2017\nsaid yes. And he says, no, I don\u2019t think you know. And I say oh? He said, you\nknow, when she couldn\u2019t get an appointment at Yale, I wanted to leave. And I said,\noh? And he said, but she wouldn\u2019t let me. And I said, oh? And he said, she said\n[indecipherable] and I said, oh? And then he looked at me and he said, all\nnonsense. She knew she was the stronger one, and she never told me. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, and think about a marriage between two people, who in many ways could\nnot have been more different. I mean, he was totally anti-religion, Jewish, no, no,\nthat was his background, but never set foot in the synagogue. She had become\nCatholic, which he didn\u2019t like, with \u2014 all sorts of different fields, different things.\nCould argue about everything, and did. But ultimately \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that\u2019s all part of being this kind of outsider.\nNow, you know, you were outsiders, and then there were occasional little things\nwhich were not. When my mother comes to pick me up the first few day \u2014 the first\nday or so that I\u2019ve gone to Worthington Hooker, this public school, just a few\nblocks from where we were living, she arrives and she sees a whole group of kids\naround me, sort of singing something and saying something, and said oh dear,July 27, 2017\nthey\u2019re teasing Guido again. But when she gets near, she hears wh-what they\u2019re\nsaying is Guido has a girlfriend, Guido has a girlfriend. So she says, he\u2019s okay.\nWho was this girl? Well, there was, in my class \u2014 I was back in second grade, in\nmy proper class, a little girl whose father was a philosopher. They were Americans,\nbut he had studied \u2014 taught, whatever, for many years in England, and they\u2019d just\ncome back from England. And he was now the faculty, and he \u2014 his daughter was\na classmate of mine. She struck me immediately as being civilized. She was the\nonly European, and it was a different way of being. And we became very good\nfriends, and she then \u2014 complicated life, ended up going back to England actually,\nand became a great poet. Her name is Anne Stevenson, she\u2019s won all sorts of\nprizes.",
        "A: She wrote a book about Sylvia Plath, which is controversial and so on. And\nwe\u2019re in touch with each other. Her sister was in Anne\u2019s class, because they\nultimately went over to this other school as well. And we\u2019ve remained friends. So\nthere were contacts, that usually had to do with something not exactly Italian, but\nEuropean, something. Or there were people \u2014 there was a great, old classics\nprofessor, who lived to be a hundred, named heners \u2014 Hendrickson. When AnneJuly 27, 2017\nand I were engaged, and all sorts of people in the Italian-American community here\nwere so excited about the fact that this Italian was marrying into this great, great \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 family. Professor Hendrickson came to see my parents, and said \u2014 who we\u2019d\nbecome a good friend of, because he was somebody who was \u2014 who knew Italy\nbefore the great migrations and so on, and in finding Italians, said to them, oh I\u2019m\nvery glad, because I want you to know, that this a good family. He, telling \u2014 I was a\nfriend of Anne\u2019s, he said, great-grandfather, who was a professor in the law school\nand treasurer of the university, who died in 1906, but this guy knew him, as a\nfriend of his, and they\u2019re really good people, so I\u2019m glad \u2014 so again, this funny,\nreverse \u2014",
        "A: Very touching.",
        "A: I suppose.\n134July 27, 2017",
        "A: I mean, who \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, who knows? And \u2014 and it \u2014 my parents did not put pressure on us. I think\nthat both my brother and I knew very well, that we had to do well, because I think,\nwhen somebody in school asked me, why do you work hard? You\u2019re so bright, you\ncan do everything easily.",
        "A: Why do you work hard? And I s \u2014 I know I said, because I have to be able to be\non my own if anything happens. And so that while my parents protected us\nenormously, I think both Paul and I knew that we had to rebuild because we had\nthis \u2014 we were okay, but immensely fragile. Because if anything had happened to\nthem, it ha \u2014 and we saw, you know, also, other people who hadn't be \u2014 my father\nhad been told by his father, it\u2019s very nice you want to study medicine, but\nremember, you don\u2019t really need to work for a living. Fortunately, my father\nignored that, and \u2014\nJuly 27, 2017",
        "A: \u2014 studied medicine. So when we came, there was something that he could do.\nMy mother was a learned \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 person, and so could do something. There was another Italian-American-\nJewish family that ended up in New Haven, the time that we were here. Oddly,\nbecause the younger sister of this man\u2019s wife had gotten a fellowship to study at\nYale, just a much younger person, and so these two ended up here. He was of a\nfamily that was extremely wealthy insurance people from Venice. And she was of\ngood family, not great and so on. She hadn't studied as much as my mother, she\nwas not that. And he was an insurance man, of a great business family. They came\nhere. He worked in a factory. She got picked up by this wonderful headmistress of\nan elementary school to teach French, so that we all learned French from Madame\n[indecipherable] who is this Italian woman, and so on. And that was better\nenough. But in a way, people like Paul and me, saw how important it was, if you\nwere not in a world that knew you. And we didn\u2019t even know of a world that knew\nus any more. We didn\u2019t even know. This was the world that we knew, that we\nwere. And so it \u2014 that probably was something that drove us to \u2014 well, my parents\nnever \u2014 never said that \u2014 you know, the fact of getting good grades and so on, was\n136July 27, 2017\nsomething that in my family was always \u2014 everybody always had, so that that was\nnot an issue. That was not \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes. I learned things here, some from my parents when \u2014 when I went back. I\nhappen to be a person who was always blessed with a great memory, and a very,\nsort of broad interest. So that when I went and met relatives there, I would talk to\nthem about their history, I would hear about them. And all of these things sort of\ngot learned, some here, some from my brother, who knew things in a somewhat\ndifferent way than I did. But more, I think just in talking to my parents, and in\nbeing interested in things in which, to some extent they were not. They were much\nless interested in their ancestors, because to them it had come as a matter of course.",
        "A: And somehow you were, you know \u2014 they were people for whom this whole\nancient history was kind of \u2014 you know, a bother. For me it was something that was\nkind of interesting to know who I was, in a place where I wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: You know, and \u2014 and so that \u2014 that became, and so I\u2019d listened and I took these\nthings in. And by the way, that\u2019s why I\u2019m in a hurry, I\u2019ve written a draft of this\nbook. It\u2019s an ugly draft, it\u2019s not well, but I\u2019m almost 85, and how long I\u2019Il last I\ndon\u2019t know, and I wanted to get it down on paper so that if I don\u2019t get it in shape, at\nleast it\u2019s there, because I\u2019m the last one who knows these stories.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They paint a world of people who somehow thought that nothing could happen\nto them, found themselves in desperate danger, reacted to that in a variety of\ndifferent ways, and then find that people, in a variety of different ways and of\ndifferent means, saved them.",
        "A: And that\u2019s remarkable.",
        "A: And that\u2019s remarkable. And \u2014 and it is different from different Holocaust tales\nof others.",
        "A: But I think this is a \u2014 good.July 27, 2017",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: And I hope this is useful to the museum, but I \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 a part \u2014 I just \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve loved meeting you two.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. And he \u2014 well, and Hillary, of course. And three people on the Supreme\nCourt.",
        "A: Clarence Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Sam Alito. And I can tell you\nsomething about their schoolwork.",
        "A: That\u2019s not a Holocaust story.",
        "A: But you know, I been \u2014 I been extraordinarily lucky, and have had \u2014 you know,\nI\u2019ve been extraordinarily lucky, or blessed, and God knows why. And in the end,\nwhat I said when I was appointed a judge, that America did do for me, and people\nhere, all sorts of very, very good things, and it didn\u2019t do it for others. And one of\nthe things of being a refugee is seeing what was done for you, and who did it, and\ntrying to do that for others.",
        "A: And in the end, that\u2019s most important.",
        "A: Thank you.",
