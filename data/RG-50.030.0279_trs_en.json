        "Q: Could you be so kind to tell us your name?",
        "A: My name is Max Schmidt.",
        "Q: When and where you were born, please?",
        "A: In January '31, 1909 in Czernowitz. At that time, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.",
        "Q: Could you tell us a few words about the background of your family and about your\nchildhood?",
        "A: Well, my father was a house painter. My mother was a housewife. I had two more brothers,\nand our -- my has been somehow cultural because my father was very much\ninterested that we should learn and read a lot of books. One of my brothers is a lawyer, my\noldest brother was a -- my middle brother is a doctor. And I studied in engineer, so the\ncultural values of my family was very high. And he was only a house painter, he worked\nonly during the summertime. Winter in Germany was very difficult, and as a painter he\ncouldn't -- well, that is -- I didn't encounter anti-Semitism until I became a student at the\nuniversity in Brest in Czechoslovakia. There the German students were extremely anti-\nSemitic, and they had been carrying here a swastika, a small swastika in the lapel, but we did\nignore them. The professor was also anti-Semitic, but 1f we responded, we made the exam.\nSo they had to give us all the good grades. But, in general, we had difficulties over there as\nJews. The great thing was it was in Czechoslovakia. When I studied, the President of\nCzechoslovakia was Tomas Masaryk, and he was a great man. One employee in the\ndirectorate of the university told me expresses verbally, as long as there was a picture of\nMasaryk, as long as Masaryk lives, you and I, we can live, too. When he is gone we will\nhave trouble.",
        "Q: Interesting. When did you return to Czernowitz?",
        "A: I did return in '37, and I did have trouble finding a job. Although Czernowitz was in the\nmajority Jews and as little industry as it was there, but we couldn't get a job. Very, very\ndifficult, because there were many authorities, they make the difficulties. Then I went to\nBucharest. In Bucharest I couldn't find a job. Whatever I did, I wrote every day, but Jews,\nno. As a Jew, no, I couldn't get a job. Finally, in my last year before the war, I did find a job\nwith a Romanian/Italian company, which make artesian wells, you know. Budoi (ph) was his\nname, he was a nice fellow. And I worked with him and when Bucovina was occupied by the\nRussians, I had to leave and I went home.",
        "Q: So when did you reach Czernowitz?",
        "A: I reached Czernowitz in '40. And from '40, I worked under the Russian regime in a factory.",
        "Q: Did you witness any deportations done by the Russians during 1940?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Yes. Just right before the war or the outbreak of the war, the Russians deported a lot\nof Czernowitz people which had been before well-situated, good situated. Had companies or\nhe was a lawyer, even a tailor. They took a tailor. There was one tailor, a Social Democrat,\nthey took him.",
        "Q: You are talking about Jewish people?",
        "A: Jewish people, yeah. And of Christian people, they took very, very, very little.",
        "Q: Can you estimate how many people were deported from Czernowitz, a rough estimate?",
        "A: Well, at that time probably 5,000 and 7,000. They took from the province, also. And they\nmade it, from the province, they made everything of Czernowitz, it's Czernowitz.",
        "Q: But when you say 5 to 7,000, you are talking only about Czernowitz, or about the whole\noccupied...",
        "A: It's about the whole...",
        "Q: About the whole?",
        "A: ... because that is only the people who were good situated, the Russians. They didn't touch\nother people. The Romanians touched everybody.",
        "Q: I understand. Can you tell us what happened to you, and to your family once the military\noperations started in June 1941, the military operation done by Romanians and Germans\nagainst Soviet Union?",
        "A: Yeah. I was at that time -- my parents were dead. My brothers were in America. I was the\nonly one in Czernowitz, and I was married. And when I -- when the deportations began, they\ndeported me, my wife, my mother-in-law and two more sisters-in-law.",
        "Q: I would like you to tell us a few words, 1n a few words what happened to you before the\ndeportations. I mean, because Czernowitz was occupied by the Romanians sometime in\nJune, and you were deported sometime in October, if I'm correct. So I would like to know\nwhat was the life at the beginnings of the ghetto in Czernowitz, your life...",
        "A: Life was very bad. Life was very bad. We couldn't get -- we didn't have any work to do. We\ncouldn't do, but we were taken out for forced labor. I was taken out by my hair, and to clean\nthe street. There was a big park in Czernowitz, Folksgarden (ph). What we had to do is clean\nthe park. We did all kinds of forced work, forced labor, but we didn't get paid.",
        "Q: Do you remember when was the Yellow Star introduced in Czernowitz, if it was any?",
        "A: The Yellow Star, yeah, the Yellow Star was. But it came about two months or three months\nbefore the deportation. In fact, I was in an office when they told me to come, but I didn't\nhave the Yellow Star. He told me \"Where is your Hakenkreuz?\" I said, \"I have no\nHakenkreuz.\" He said, \"You need a Hakenkreuz.\" A Yellow Star. And by -- he didn't punish\nme, but 1t was some, I would say, a rarity. Because other people have been very much\npunished when they didn't carry a Yellow Star.",
        "Q: Could you tell us what happened to you and your family when the ghetto was sealed and\nwhen the deportations started in Czernowitz?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, we -- when they started, every day they eliminated one or two streets where we\nhave been before. And they pushed us more and more to another part of the city, which was\nin old time inhabited by a lot of Jews. This is not . And they pushed us every\nday, they closed the street. I lived, for example, close to the National Theater. One day they\ncame in and said, \" . You cannot live anymore here.\" And we had to take whatever\nwe could take by hand and leave. So that was two or three days, and then they sealed the\nghetto. And we were in a very small place, and about a day later started evacuation. They\ndrove us to the railroad and we had -- and the wagon without anything. And we couldn't take\nanything, only what we can carry.",
        "Q: So you were deported with your wife, and who else?",
        "A: My wife, my mother-in-law and two more sisters-in-law of mine. And then we went to\nMogilev, we came to Akak1.",
        "Q: This was a crossing point?",
        "A: Yeah. Akaki (ph) was the first before. Akaki was still Romanian, and then came the Dnestr\nand then Mogilev and we were in the Ukraine. And that was a very bad view that we have\nseen from Akaki, because before us there are other people already. The Yelets (ph) from four\nparts in Bessarabia, in Bucovina.",
        "Q: And did you meet these people from Yelets?",
        "A: No, I didn't meet because when we came, they were driven further. They were driven further,\nand we were only about a day and a night. And then the next day they started to drive us. It\nwas raining all night, it was a very cold, and you couldn't walk because it was a morass. And\nthey drove us, we got hit -- I got hit by a Romanian soldier here and there and to let go my\npackage. And I let go, but my wife asked him \"Look, I want to have this one. Give it to me.\"\nSo somehow he gave it to her. And that package was my documents, my certificates from the\nuniversity from my diplomas in engineer. And then we were walking, walking; suddenly, I\nfell because I slipped and fell into -- it was hole. But I got up to here, and I knew I couldn't\nget out. My wife wanted to reach out for me, but she couldn't, she was pushed further from\nme. Because she couldn't stop, she was walking. Somebody, probably a man, gave me his\nhand and pulled me out, so I came -- I was saved. I couldn't even thank him, I didn't know\nwho it was because he was pushed, you know. We were so driven and hit by the soldiers that\nwe couldn't even breathe.",
        "Q: This was where?",
        "A: In Akaki.",
        "Q: In Akaki.",
        "A: They pushed us towards the Dnestr. My wife already knew that I'm dead. But then later I did\nfind her on the shore of Akaki, and we went over at night and in a barge. Some people before\nus and after us were in the barge. They turned the barge, and fell in the cold water and\nthey drowned. We somehow survived. Later on I did find my mother-in-law and my two\nsisters also. They survived and were already in Mogilev in a shack, in an old house. It was --\nthe house was uninhabitable, but it was there, so we started -- we had been united. The next\nday I heard that there was somebody who would make work for -- working for the\ngovernment. Looking for workers. Workers who know their , SO I went to see this\nman. When I -- in order to come there, I had to go to a places, to streets I didn't know. But I\nsaw that the Romanian soldiers and Ukrainians were banded together and robbing the people\nthey met in the street. And I went and zigzagged not to meet the people, and I came to the\nDnestr. But there was a big house, and they told me this is the house of the rabbi (ph), and\nthere is Yegendorf (ph). I entered this building and I asked a woman, \"I want to speak to\nYegendorf.\" She told me \"Yegendorf is not here, he will come and then you can talk to him.\"\nAnd I didn't know him. I said, \"How should I recognize Yegendorf?\" She told me, \"He has a\nwhite collar, he is always white collar. It's nice.\" And so I recognized him. When he came\nfrom the Prefect, he told me then he came the Prefect. And I told him who I am, what I do\nand I would like to do. He said to me, \"All right. Come tomorrow 7 o'clock in the morning.\"",
        "Q: You were an engineer, correct?",
        "A: Yes, I was an engineer. I still am.",
        "Q: I'm sorry. In what?",
        "A: Mechanical engineer.",
        "Q: Mechanical engineer, okay.",
        "A: And so next day, I came and we all went to see this Timisoara (ph). And he went along at my\nside, and he asked me, \"What can we do here? What can we do here and here?\" And I said,\n\"It's very difficult, but we have to do whatever we can, and we will do.\" He said, \"All right.\"\nSo that was the beginning of my relationship with Yegendorf. He made me -- I have this\ndocument as a , the chief engineer. Chief engineer was a Mr. Bingerstratts (ph). He\nwas the, how shall I say, the son-in-law of a very rich man from Radom, who was on the\n. Yegendorf was also on the . So this Bingerstratts was made chief\nengineer; I was his deputy. So we started little by little, we started to build up this Timisoara.\nYegendorf was in the beginning a nice fellow, but the more power he got the more he\nbecame brutal. And he was intellectually a lightweight, but there were people around us,\nwhich certainly you know, there was a Dr. Kessler (ph), a lawyer, from Donetsk (ph). He\nwas a very, very clever man and a highly intelligent man. Kessler was his alter-ego for\nYegendorf. If Kessler proposed what to do, Yegendorf signed and said, \"I did it.\" And so it\nwent with a lot of penchants in the Timisoara. People did a lot of things to survive.",
        "Q: Can you explain how come this Timisoara (ph), this foundry, was created? What was the\ninterest of the Romanian authorities to create the foundry and why they wanted -- why they\nwent ahead with this idea?",
        "A: Well, so far as I know, there was a lot of people, the prefect of Mogilev had some people\naround himself that were Jews. Yegendorf had some people around him that were also Jews.\nAnd they made business, one group with the other. In order to make business and that it\nshould be something we make work for the benefit of the country, so it was war. The\nTimisoara (ph), which could repair cars, tractors, and do other things, was very important for\nthe Germans and for the Romanians. And besides, the great motive of this, I believe, was\npeople -- the Romanians, the Prefect, the Major of the gendarmerie, who was -- they wanted\nto make business; they wanted to get rich. And my personal opinion is that this 1s our luck,\nbecause we could corrupt them with money and we could stay there.",
        "Q: So if I understand when Mogilev was practically a huge ghetto, which had this foundry, this\nTimisoara (ph), as the main industrial unit?",
        "A: Yeah. The Timisoara (ph) was there when the Russians had -- after they were done. When\nthey left they destroyed a lot of this. Now, Yegendorf and Prefect Bayona (ph), who was, by\nthe way, an Austrian-Romanian, he was serving in the Austrian Army during the First World\nWar. Yegendorf was a lieutenant of the First -- in the Austrian Army of the First World War.\nSo they had a common language. They both spoke German, and they both understood each\nother. They made it in order to have a hinterland. To provide for the army, for the force or\nwhoever. And we did a lot of things for the army, for the Romanian Army and for the\nGerman Army. The Germans came in and gave the order and we did it. In the beginning we\nhad our difficulties because we -- there was not instruments. We had to begin from zero. The\nfirst hammer we made, I remember there was an old man by the name of Bloan (ph) Schmitt.\nAnd he took a piece of iron and two bricks and put a fire in the two big bricks, and put the\niron in the fire. Then with another brick, he hammered this out and we had the first hammer.\nSo we made instruments and we made instruments for our lathe machine, for our planning\nmachine, for our blazer, the Timisoara (ph) infected was a -- have a molten, the tron started\nto work and we did a lot of things over for the government, for the Romanians. And, by the\nway, some people made money, the big ones of the Romanians.",
        "Q: If my understanding is correct, some of the Jews from Mogilev were deported later from\nMogilev to Szydlowiec, am I correct?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you elaborate on this? Can you describe to us what happened?",
        "A: I can only tell you that one day we had a lot of some -- in my department there was about\nfive Mogilev Jews, workers, real good workers. And in order not to be deported, they had to\nbe working in the Timisoara (ph). And so we had a lot in other departments, some Russian\nJews. But the majority was deported to Szydlowiec or other places.",
        "Q: Did you witness those deportations?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit more about the life in the ghetto, day-to-day life about how was the\nghetto business conducted by Yegendorf and so on?",
        "A: It's difficult because I didn't -- I haven't been in the city, in Mogilev. My work was always\nwith Timisoara (ph), but I heard Yegendorf was -- they had formed committees. And\nYegendorf was the President of the committee. And the committee had some people from\nother localities, sometimes from , from Soroki, Domnitsa. In the beginning was\nDomnitsa and Mogilev, but then he went to Szydlowiec with his people. There was another\nMr. Cotts (ph), an engineer from Soroki, and he became a member of the committee. And\nthat was one man who was against Yegendorf. Yegendorf and Cotts were two .\nYegendorf, when he didn't like something or somebody, he just resigned. And the committee\nwas dissolved and then the Prefect gave him another shot, make another committee. And he\ndid another committee with other people. Yegendorf was a manipulator.",
        "Q: Manipulator.",
        "A: Manipulator. And Cotts was a strong personality and didn't accept everything with\nYegendorf. Yegendorf also wrote -- he resigned from a committee and wrote to the Prefect\nthat the next committee the Prefect has nominated is not doing the job. They are doing just --\nthey are caring only for themselves. They make business from the committee, and neglect\nthe benefits of the other people. It was a lot of accusations, a letter is there. In the book from\nYegendorf he is mentioning this letter, that Yegendorf denounced a committee and wanted to\nhave the committee annulled and given to him again. So that was the policies in Mogilev.\nThey made outside of city, they made somehow as -- a collective workers who could work\nlike all kinds of, how shall I say, shoemakers. Carpenters. And they started to work, and\nCotts was informed, was the President of these ateliers. And Yegendorf and Cotts were\nharassing one and the other and impeded a lot of work. Then a lot of people made business,\nthey got their own collections to the gendarmerie. As they made business, they made stores,\nand they sold bread, cake, whatever. And they were very ingenious in making business. And,\nof course, at one time it was not thought it was a ghetto. It was just a business, but then came\nthe other way. And they started to harass the people. We had the Jewish Police in Mogilev,\nthat was not a very friendly people.",
        "Q: What were they doing?",
        "A: They were police, and sometimes they abused the people. They abused by making money.\nThey arrested people and people paid them, and then -- so I do not know very well about that\nbecause I was not active in that. But I heard what they told me was going on down in the\ncity.",
        "Q: So you stayed most of your years in Mogilev in Timisoara (ph) itself?",
        "A: That's it, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you...",
        "A: I really was in the Timisoara (ph) and not very far from the Timisoara (ph) was a building\nwhere we lived.",
        "Q: I understand.",
        "A: Yegendorf lived in the same building, and in a smaller building and he was living like a king.\nWhen he left his apartment, he was accompanied by two bodyguards. Nobody could talk to\nhim, and he went to the office. In the office, he was king.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a few things about your most difficult months or years in Timisoara (ph)?",
        "A: Well, it was in the beginning. The beginning was very, very difficult because we didn't have\nanything, and we didn't know what to do. I mean, we had to work, so we made whatever we\ncould. Ingenious, we have invented a lot of things to make instruments and then with one --\nthe moment I had one lathe at hand, we started to repair another. So little by little, we\nbecame a very well organized factory, because we had a lathe and then the Timisoara (ph) --\nas such and then we had one department we made smaller things. It was run by another\ncolleague of mine very nicely. He made all kinds of screws and blades and so forth. And that\nwas what we had to do.",
        "Q: I remember reading at a certain point about a statue which was built in Mogilev.",
        "A: I don't know about that because it was done in very great secret. There was an architect,\n, who made the design, a statue, a cross. And they put the cross on front on a very\nhigh place, but I cannot tell you more about that because everything was done in secret. I\ncouldn't find out. I was working in the lathe department, and I didn't know what's going in\nthe carpenter department, because they made it over there. Mr. , an architect, and\nYegendorrf.",
        "Q: Can you elaborate a little bit on Yegendorf's style of administration and his style on dealing\non one hand with the Romanian authorities, on the other hand with the Jews interned in\nMogilev?",
        "A: Yeah, that I can tell you. Yegendorf was a very good organizer. Very good. He knew a lot\nabout administration, but he was not a very good engineer. And he was a man who knew so\nmuch, but when somebody came around who knew a little bit more, 1t was his -- he was an\nenemy of Yegendorf. Couldn't exist anymore. We as engineers, we were all young engineers,\nwe know all the engineers always likes to talk about his days when he became an engineer.\nHe never talked to us, he always dealt with us as in facto. You are in this department, you do\nwhat I tell you. He came around and my people made lighters, you know. And he went\naround and looked. And one day he caught me, but I didn't tell him what's going on. And he\nsaid to me, \"What are they doing here?\" And then I had to tell him they were lighters. And\nhe was very angry, he said, \"You do this and you sell it, and then I have to defend you. The\ngendarmerie will ask about it.\" I said, \"Mr. Engineer, he is hungry. He doesn't do it all the\ntime, he did it once.\" So when he caught somebody with a lighter, he punished him very\nseverely.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: He said, \"If you do it one more time, you lose the apartment. You lose your way 1n this\nbuilding. You cannot live with us. And you lose the Timisoara (ph), and that means that.\"\nAnd he was not shy to threaten us with that. He was very severe, but, by the way, he was a\ngood organizer. He dealt with the gendarmerie and the Prefect. I believe his people from the\nPrefect who were Jews, and Yegendorf's people around him who were Jews, they made\nbusiness with one each other. And that was a big thing. They also paid money. For example,\nthey bought big jewelry for the women of the Major, diamonds. And so they corrupted, and\nthat was the way it went on. Sometimes he was very courageous, Yegendorf. When people\nattacked us or beat some Jews, he said, \"You cannot beat these people because they are\nmine.\" One officer, Romanian officer, beat him and made him sick, but he was -- I must say\nthat this officer was very severely dealt with by the Prefect. But he was courageous, he was a\ngood organizer, but he was not a good man. Man with compassion, that he was not. And he\nalways, always had in his mind was \"I am number one.\" And he met people from Odessa,\nfrom the government, talked to him and he was by -- want so much influence that he made a\nscheme. He made a proposal, how to organize the Jews in grand scheme, in the whole of\nUkraine to repair the industry and all the workshops and to make them workable. And that\nwas he should be on the top of that, and we should be his servants. Now, I didn't know about\nthat, only when I saw the documents. That in my mind made him very low. This 1s war -- I\ndon't want to use it -- but it's like a war criminal because in times of war then your friends are\nyour enemy. But what we had to do under the impression, under the pressure, we had to do,\nthat is one thing. But when we voluntarily do something, this is different.",
        "Q: I understand. Can you tell us about your experience toward the end of your stay in Mogilev?\nWhat happened when the Russians came, and how did you come back from Transnistria to\nCzernowitz?",
        "A: Well, Yegendorf, it was a time when was at odds with Antinesco (ph), and\nAntinesco sent him to Mogilev. Federman (ph) -- that we have, Federman was in Mogilev,\nand he talk only to Mr. Yegendorf. And he wasn't even visiting the city. Federman wasn't\nvisiting the Timisoara (ph).",
        "Q: You never saw him in Mogilev?",
        "A: No, no. I saw him once when he into the apartment of engineer Yegendorf. Well, and then\nfinally when Federman went back, we thought that now a lot of things are regulated. But one\nday, one day I came to there and Yegendorf was gone. Yegendorf secretly left. Federman\nworked out...",
        "Q: His release?",
        "A: ... his release. And Yegendorf and his wife left Mogilev secretly. And we were -- suddenly\nwe were without a leader. You see, how bad he was, how good he was, but he was a leader.\nAnd it's like a father, the son 1s like the father. Suddenly there's no father, he left. And\neverything was very -- in a very bad situation.",
        "Q: So he left without any warning?",
        "A: Without anything. Not saying a thing. And a couple of days later, we say the Germans had\nopened a big storage place. They had storage over there with sugar, flour, bread, everything.\nAnd they opened the doors and told the people, 'Take whatever you want.\" My wife was\nalso at that time left and went over there to take some sugar, some -- whatever it 1s she can\ntake. And all the people went to take. Suddenly, the German came and started\nto shoot. A lot of people there were killed. Happily my wife was not wounded. And then\nthey started the rumor, we saw that the Germans started to leave in cars. Well, there was -- I\nsaw one car full of Romanian soldiers halted by the Germans. They forced the Romanian\nsoldiers to get out, they got into the car and left. That I saw from the Timisoara (ph) on the\nhighway. And so it was, it became a situation without -- they're shooting from all sides. From\nSoroki, from Romania they were shooting. And they were shooting from our parts, from the\nMogilev. Then we saw on a mountain some people, and we were told these are the partisans.\nIn a day the partisans started to work, and the Russians came in. The first group of soldiers.\nIt was 4 o'clock in the morning. We were very lucky. We went to welcome the Russians.\nThere was an officer, a Russian officer, a lieutenant. He said to us, \"You are guilty that we\nhave a war. You are a guilt -- because we don't want a war. We fight for you because we\nwant to save you, but you are guilty.\" And that was the first greetings from the Russians,\nwhere the whole world thought when they will come we will be liberated. We will be free.\nThe first thing was this anti-Semitic remark. And they started to take people from us to\nmobilize people.",
        "Q: To draft them in the army?",
        "A: Yes. In the army. And I had to work. I couldn't leave. I wanted to go home. They told me,\n\"You cannot leave. You have to work here. I will tell you when you can leave.\" And they\nnever told me. So we were like forced labor, it was not very nice. And every day they came\nfor us. It was finally I sent my wife before, she went home. I started to work over there, and\nthen one day I decided whatever it will be, I go home, and I was lucky. My wife went to -- in\nCzernowitz, there 1s a factory where I was working before. And they gave her a letter that\nthey need me. It was already under Russian regime. They gave her a letter that they need me,\nand I should be sent home from Mogilev. And with that letter, I went home. I came home\nand started to work over there, and after a couple of months I got sick. I got the trembling, I\ncouldn't work. They made me an invalid for the time being. Then after I got my release from\nthe hospital, they told me I started to look for getting out. Lucky I went to . They\npermitted us, whoever wants to leave can leave. So we made my publication, I went to\nRomania. I went to Bucharest. And there I started to make connection with my brothers. In\nthe meantime, Yegendorf was also in Bucharest. He lived in a house of the Police\nCommissioner, Monalesko (ph). And I went to see him, he received me very friendly and\nsaid, \"Well, everything will be all fine.\" And he told me had two daughters here, and he told\nme when I want to get in touch with my brothers, I should give him a letter, and he will send\nit to the daughters and they will contact him. So I gave him, but my brother contacted me\nbefore that. And that was it.",
        "Q: When did you leave Romania?",

        "A: My name is Max Schmidt.",
        "A: In January '31, 1909 in Czernowitz. At that time, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.",
        "A: Well, my father was a house painter. My mother was a housewife. I had two more brothers,\nand our -- my has been somehow cultural because my father was very much\ninterested that we should learn and read a lot of books. One of my brothers is a lawyer, my\noldest brother was a -- my middle brother is a doctor. And I studied in engineer, so the\ncultural values of my family was very high. And he was only a house painter, he worked\nonly during the summertime. Winter in Germany was very difficult, and as a painter he\ncouldn't -- well, that is -- I didn't encounter anti-Semitism until I became a student at the\nuniversity in Brest in Czechoslovakia. There the German students were extremely anti-\nSemitic, and they had been carrying here a swastika, a small swastika in the lapel, but we did\nignore them. The professor was also anti-Semitic, but 1f we responded, we made the exam.\nSo they had to give us all the good grades. But, in general, we had difficulties over there as\nJews. The great thing was it was in Czechoslovakia. When I studied, the President of\nCzechoslovakia was Tomas Masaryk, and he was a great man. One employee in the\ndirectorate of the university told me expresses verbally, as long as there was a picture of\nMasaryk, as long as Masaryk lives, you and I, we can live, too. When he is gone we will\nhave trouble.",
        "A: I did return in '37, and I did have trouble finding a job. Although Czernowitz was in the\nmajority Jews and as little industry as it was there, but we couldn't get a job. Very, very\ndifficult, because there were many authorities, they make the difficulties. Then I went to\nBucharest. In Bucharest I couldn't find a job. Whatever I did, I wrote every day, but Jews,\nno. As a Jew, no, I couldn't get a job. Finally, in my last year before the war, I did find a job\nwith a Romanian/Italian company, which make artesian wells, you know. Budoi (ph) was his\nname, he was a nice fellow. And I worked with him and when Bucovina was occupied by the\nRussians, I had to leave and I went home.",
        "A: I reached Czernowitz in '40. And from '40, I worked under the Russian regime in a factory.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Yes. Just right before the war or the outbreak of the war, the Russians deported a lot\nof Czernowitz people which had been before well-situated, good situated. Had companies or\nhe was a lawyer, even a tailor. They took a tailor. There was one tailor, a Social Democrat,\nthey took him.",
        "A: Jewish people, yeah. And of Christian people, they took very, very, very little.",
        "A: Well, at that time probably 5,000 and 7,000. They took from the province, also. And they\nmade it, from the province, they made everything of Czernowitz, it's Czernowitz.",
        "A: It's about the whole...",
        "A: ... because that is only the people who were good situated, the Russians. They didn't touch\nother people. The Romanians touched everybody.",
        "A: Yeah. I was at that time -- my parents were dead. My brothers were in America. I was the\nonly one in Czernowitz, and I was married. And when I -- when the deportations began, they\ndeported me, my wife, my mother-in-law and two more sisters-in-law.",
        "A: Life was very bad. Life was very bad. We couldn't get -- we didn't have any work to do. We\ncouldn't do, but we were taken out for forced labor. I was taken out by my hair, and to clean\nthe street. There was a big park in Czernowitz, Folksgarden (ph). What we had to do is clean\nthe park. We did all kinds of forced work, forced labor, but we didn't get paid.",
        "A: The Yellow Star, yeah, the Yellow Star was. But it came about two months or three months\nbefore the deportation. In fact, I was in an office when they told me to come, but I didn't\nhave the Yellow Star. He told me \"Where is your Hakenkreuz?\" I said, \"I have no\nHakenkreuz.\" He said, \"You need a Hakenkreuz.\" A Yellow Star. And by -- he didn't punish\nme, but 1t was some, I would say, a rarity. Because other people have been very much\npunished when they didn't carry a Yellow Star.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, we -- when they started, every day they eliminated one or two streets where we\nhave been before. And they pushed us more and more to another part of the city, which was\nin old time inhabited by a lot of Jews. This is not . And they pushed us every\nday, they closed the street. I lived, for example, close to the National Theater. One day they\ncame in and said, \" . You cannot live anymore here.\" And we had to take whatever\nwe could take by hand and leave. So that was two or three days, and then they sealed the\nghetto. And we were in a very small place, and about a day later started evacuation. They\ndrove us to the railroad and we had -- and the wagon without anything. And we couldn't take\nanything, only what we can carry.",
        "A: My wife, my mother-in-law and two more sisters-in-law of mine. And then we went to\nMogilev, we came to Akak1.",
        "A: Yeah. Akaki (ph) was the first before. Akaki was still Romanian, and then came the Dnestr\nand then Mogilev and we were in the Ukraine. And that was a very bad view that we have\nseen from Akaki, because before us there are other people already. The Yelets (ph) from four\nparts in Bessarabia, in Bucovina.",
        "A: No, I didn't meet because when we came, they were driven further. They were driven further,\nand we were only about a day and a night. And then the next day they started to drive us. It\nwas raining all night, it was a very cold, and you couldn't walk because it was a morass. And\nthey drove us, we got hit -- I got hit by a Romanian soldier here and there and to let go my\npackage. And I let go, but my wife asked him \"Look, I want to have this one. Give it to me.\"\nSo somehow he gave it to her. And that package was my documents, my certificates from the\nuniversity from my diplomas in engineer. And then we were walking, walking; suddenly, I\nfell because I slipped and fell into -- it was hole. But I got up to here, and I knew I couldn't\nget out. My wife wanted to reach out for me, but she couldn't, she was pushed further from\nme. Because she couldn't stop, she was walking. Somebody, probably a man, gave me his\nhand and pulled me out, so I came -- I was saved. I couldn't even thank him, I didn't know\nwho it was because he was pushed, you know. We were so driven and hit by the soldiers that\nwe couldn't even breathe.",
        "A: In Akaki.",
        "A: They pushed us towards the Dnestr. My wife already knew that I'm dead. But then later I did\nfind her on the shore of Akaki, and we went over at night and in a barge. Some people before\nus and after us were in the barge. They turned the barge, and fell in the cold water and\nthey drowned. We somehow survived. Later on I did find my mother-in-law and my two\nsisters also. They survived and were already in Mogilev in a shack, in an old house. It was --\nthe house was uninhabitable, but it was there, so we started -- we had been united. The next\nday I heard that there was somebody who would make work for -- working for the\ngovernment. Looking for workers. Workers who know their , SO I went to see this\nman. When I -- in order to come there, I had to go to a places, to streets I didn't know. But I\nsaw that the Romanian soldiers and Ukrainians were banded together and robbing the people\nthey met in the street. And I went and zigzagged not to meet the people, and I came to the\nDnestr. But there was a big house, and they told me this is the house of the rabbi (ph), and\nthere is Yegendorf (ph). I entered this building and I asked a woman, \"I want to speak to\nYegendorf.\" She told me \"Yegendorf is not here, he will come and then you can talk to him.\"\nAnd I didn't know him. I said, \"How should I recognize Yegendorf?\" She told me, \"He has a\nwhite collar, he is always white collar. It's nice.\" And so I recognized him. When he came\nfrom the Prefect, he told me then he came the Prefect. And I told him who I am, what I do\nand I would like to do. He said to me, \"All right. Come tomorrow 7 o'clock in the morning.\"",
        "A: Yes, I was an engineer. I still am.",
        "A: Mechanical engineer.",
        "A: And so next day, I came and we all went to see this Timisoara (ph). And he went along at my\nside, and he asked me, \"What can we do here? What can we do here and here?\" And I said,\n\"It's very difficult, but we have to do whatever we can, and we will do.\" He said, \"All right.\"\nSo that was the beginning of my relationship with Yegendorf. He made me -- I have this\ndocument as a , the chief engineer. Chief engineer was a Mr. Bingerstratts (ph). He\nwas the, how shall I say, the son-in-law of a very rich man from Radom, who was on the\n. Yegendorf was also on the . So this Bingerstratts was made chief\nengineer; I was his deputy. So we started little by little, we started to build up this Timisoara.\nYegendorf was in the beginning a nice fellow, but the more power he got the more he\nbecame brutal. And he was intellectually a lightweight, but there were people around us,\nwhich certainly you know, there was a Dr. Kessler (ph), a lawyer, from Donetsk (ph). He\nwas a very, very clever man and a highly intelligent man. Kessler was his alter-ego for\nYegendorf. If Kessler proposed what to do, Yegendorf signed and said, \"I did it.\" And so it\nwent with a lot of penchants in the Timisoara. People did a lot of things to survive.",
        "A: Well, so far as I know, there was a lot of people, the prefect of Mogilev had some people\naround himself that were Jews. Yegendorf had some people around him that were also Jews.\nAnd they made business, one group with the other. In order to make business and that it\nshould be something we make work for the benefit of the country, so it was war. The\nTimisoara (ph), which could repair cars, tractors, and do other things, was very important for\nthe Germans and for the Romanians. And besides, the great motive of this, I believe, was\npeople -- the Romanians, the Prefect, the Major of the gendarmerie, who was -- they wanted\nto make business; they wanted to get rich. And my personal opinion is that this 1s our luck,\nbecause we could corrupt them with money and we could stay there.",
        "A: Yeah. The Timisoara (ph) was there when the Russians had -- after they were done. When\nthey left they destroyed a lot of this. Now, Yegendorf and Prefect Bayona (ph), who was, by\nthe way, an Austrian-Romanian, he was serving in the Austrian Army during the First World\nWar. Yegendorf was a lieutenant of the First -- in the Austrian Army of the First World War.\nSo they had a common language. They both spoke German, and they both understood each\nother. They made it in order to have a hinterland. To provide for the army, for the force or\nwhoever. And we did a lot of things for the army, for the Romanian Army and for the\nGerman Army. The Germans came in and gave the order and we did it. In the beginning we\nhad our difficulties because we -- there was not instruments. We had to begin from zero. The\nfirst hammer we made, I remember there was an old man by the name of Bloan (ph) Schmitt.\nAnd he took a piece of iron and two bricks and put a fire in the two big bricks, and put the\niron in the fire. Then with another brick, he hammered this out and we had the first hammer.\nSo we made instruments and we made instruments for our lathe machine, for our planning\nmachine, for our blazer, the Timisoara (ph) infected was a -- have a molten, the tron started\nto work and we did a lot of things over for the government, for the Romanians. And, by the\nway, some people made money, the big ones of the Romanians.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I can only tell you that one day we had a lot of some -- in my department there was about\nfive Mogilev Jews, workers, real good workers. And in order not to be deported, they had to\nbe working in the Timisoara (ph). And so we had a lot in other departments, some Russian\nJews. But the majority was deported to Szydlowiec or other places.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: It's difficult because I didn't -- I haven't been in the city, in Mogilev. My work was always\nwith Timisoara (ph), but I heard Yegendorf was -- they had formed committees. And\nYegendorf was the President of the committee. And the committee had some people from\nother localities, sometimes from , from Soroki, Domnitsa. In the beginning was\nDomnitsa and Mogilev, but then he went to Szydlowiec with his people. There was another\nMr. Cotts (ph), an engineer from Soroki, and he became a member of the committee. And\nthat was one man who was against Yegendorf. Yegendorf and Cotts were two .\nYegendorf, when he didn't like something or somebody, he just resigned. And the committee\nwas dissolved and then the Prefect gave him another shot, make another committee. And he\ndid another committee with other people. Yegendorf was a manipulator.",
        "A: Manipulator. And Cotts was a strong personality and didn't accept everything with\nYegendorf. Yegendorf also wrote -- he resigned from a committee and wrote to the Prefect\nthat the next committee the Prefect has nominated is not doing the job. They are doing just --\nthey are caring only for themselves. They make business from the committee, and neglect\nthe benefits of the other people. It was a lot of accusations, a letter is there. In the book from\nYegendorf he is mentioning this letter, that Yegendorf denounced a committee and wanted to\nhave the committee annulled and given to him again. So that was the policies in Mogilev.\nThey made outside of city, they made somehow as -- a collective workers who could work\nlike all kinds of, how shall I say, shoemakers. Carpenters. And they started to work, and\nCotts was informed, was the President of these ateliers. And Yegendorf and Cotts were\nharassing one and the other and impeded a lot of work. Then a lot of people made business,\nthey got their own collections to the gendarmerie. As they made business, they made stores,\nand they sold bread, cake, whatever. And they were very ingenious in making business. And,\nof course, at one time it was not thought it was a ghetto. It was just a business, but then came\nthe other way. And they started to harass the people. We had the Jewish Police in Mogilev,\nthat was not a very friendly people.",
        "A: They were police, and sometimes they abused the people. They abused by making money.\nThey arrested people and people paid them, and then -- so I do not know very well about that\nbecause I was not active in that. But I heard what they told me was going on down in the\ncity.",
        "A: That's it, yeah.",
        "A: I really was in the Timisoara (ph) and not very far from the Timisoara (ph) was a building\nwhere we lived.",
        "A: Yegendorf lived in the same building, and in a smaller building and he was living like a king.\nWhen he left his apartment, he was accompanied by two bodyguards. Nobody could talk to\nhim, and he went to the office. In the office, he was king.",
        "A: Well, it was in the beginning. The beginning was very, very difficult because we didn't have\nanything, and we didn't know what to do. I mean, we had to work, so we made whatever we\ncould. Ingenious, we have invented a lot of things to make instruments and then with one --\nthe moment I had one lathe at hand, we started to repair another. So little by little, we\nbecame a very well organized factory, because we had a lathe and then the Timisoara (ph) --\nas such and then we had one department we made smaller things. It was run by another\ncolleague of mine very nicely. He made all kinds of screws and blades and so forth. And that\nwas what we had to do.",
        "A: I don't know about that because it was done in very great secret. There was an architect,\n, who made the design, a statue, a cross. And they put the cross on front on a very\nhigh place, but I cannot tell you more about that because everything was done in secret. I\ncouldn't find out. I was working in the lathe department, and I didn't know what's going in\nthe carpenter department, because they made it over there. Mr. , an architect, and\nYegendorrf.",
        "A: Yeah, that I can tell you. Yegendorf was a very good organizer. Very good. He knew a lot\nabout administration, but he was not a very good engineer. And he was a man who knew so\nmuch, but when somebody came around who knew a little bit more, 1t was his -- he was an\nenemy of Yegendorf. Couldn't exist anymore. We as engineers, we were all young engineers,\nwe know all the engineers always likes to talk about his days when he became an engineer.\nHe never talked to us, he always dealt with us as in facto. You are in this department, you do\nwhat I tell you. He came around and my people made lighters, you know. And he went\naround and looked. And one day he caught me, but I didn't tell him what's going on. And he\nsaid to me, \"What are they doing here?\" And then I had to tell him they were lighters. And\nhe was very angry, he said, \"You do this and you sell it, and then I have to defend you. The\ngendarmerie will ask about it.\" I said, \"Mr. Engineer, he is hungry. He doesn't do it all the\ntime, he did it once.\" So when he caught somebody with a lighter, he punished him very\nseverely.",
        "A: He said, \"If you do it one more time, you lose the apartment. You lose your way 1n this\nbuilding. You cannot live with us. And you lose the Timisoara (ph), and that means that.\"\nAnd he was not shy to threaten us with that. He was very severe, but, by the way, he was a\ngood organizer. He dealt with the gendarmerie and the Prefect. I believe his people from the\nPrefect who were Jews, and Yegendorf's people around him who were Jews, they made\nbusiness with one each other. And that was a big thing. They also paid money. For example,\nthey bought big jewelry for the women of the Major, diamonds. And so they corrupted, and\nthat was the way it went on. Sometimes he was very courageous, Yegendorf. When people\nattacked us or beat some Jews, he said, \"You cannot beat these people because they are\nmine.\" One officer, Romanian officer, beat him and made him sick, but he was -- I must say\nthat this officer was very severely dealt with by the Prefect. But he was courageous, he was a\ngood organizer, but he was not a good man. Man with compassion, that he was not. And he\nalways, always had in his mind was \"I am number one.\" And he met people from Odessa,\nfrom the government, talked to him and he was by -- want so much influence that he made a\nscheme. He made a proposal, how to organize the Jews in grand scheme, in the whole of\nUkraine to repair the industry and all the workshops and to make them workable. And that\nwas he should be on the top of that, and we should be his servants. Now, I didn't know about\nthat, only when I saw the documents. That in my mind made him very low. This 1s war -- I\ndon't want to use it -- but it's like a war criminal because in times of war then your friends are\nyour enemy. But what we had to do under the impression, under the pressure, we had to do,\nthat is one thing. But when we voluntarily do something, this is different.",
        "A: Well, Yegendorf, it was a time when was at odds with Antinesco (ph), and\nAntinesco sent him to Mogilev. Federman (ph) -- that we have, Federman was in Mogilev,\nand he talk only to Mr. Yegendorf. And he wasn't even visiting the city. Federman wasn't\nvisiting the Timisoara (ph).",
        "A: No, no. I saw him once when he into the apartment of engineer Yegendorf. Well, and then\nfinally when Federman went back, we thought that now a lot of things are regulated. But one\nday, one day I came to there and Yegendorf was gone. Yegendorf secretly left. Federman\nworked out...",
        "A: ... his release. And Yegendorf and his wife left Mogilev secretly. And we were -- suddenly\nwe were without a leader. You see, how bad he was, how good he was, but he was a leader.\nAnd it's like a father, the son 1s like the father. Suddenly there's no father, he left. And\neverything was very -- in a very bad situation.",
        "A: Without anything. Not saying a thing. And a couple of days later, we say the Germans had\nopened a big storage place. They had storage over there with sugar, flour, bread, everything.\nAnd they opened the doors and told the people, 'Take whatever you want.\" My wife was\nalso at that time left and went over there to take some sugar, some -- whatever it 1s she can\ntake. And all the people went to take. Suddenly, the German came and started\nto shoot. A lot of people there were killed. Happily my wife was not wounded. And then\nthey started the rumor, we saw that the Germans started to leave in cars. Well, there was -- I\nsaw one car full of Romanian soldiers halted by the Germans. They forced the Romanian\nsoldiers to get out, they got into the car and left. That I saw from the Timisoara (ph) on the\nhighway. And so it was, it became a situation without -- they're shooting from all sides. From\nSoroki, from Romania they were shooting. And they were shooting from our parts, from the\nMogilev. Then we saw on a mountain some people, and we were told these are the partisans.\nIn a day the partisans started to work, and the Russians came in. The first group of soldiers.\nIt was 4 o'clock in the morning. We were very lucky. We went to welcome the Russians.\nThere was an officer, a Russian officer, a lieutenant. He said to us, \"You are guilty that we\nhave a war. You are a guilt -- because we don't want a war. We fight for you because we\nwant to save you, but you are guilty.\" And that was the first greetings from the Russians,\nwhere the whole world thought when they will come we will be liberated. We will be free.\nThe first thing was this anti-Semitic remark. And they started to take people from us to\nmobilize people.",
        "A: Yes. In the army. And I had to work. I couldn't leave. I wanted to go home. They told me,\n\"You cannot leave. You have to work here. I will tell you when you can leave.\" And they\nnever told me. So we were like forced labor, it was not very nice. And every day they came\nfor us. It was finally I sent my wife before, she went home. I started to work over there, and\nthen one day I decided whatever it will be, I go home, and I was lucky. My wife went to -- in\nCzernowitz, there 1s a factory where I was working before. And they gave her a letter that\nthey need me. It was already under Russian regime. They gave her a letter that they need me,\nand I should be sent home from Mogilev. And with that letter, I went home.
