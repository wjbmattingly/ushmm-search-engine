And they were slaughtering there Michalovce \u2014 near\nMichalovce, and sending every week to Prague, to the capitol of Czechoslovakia,\nand he used to actually to travel almost every week to Prague where he was \u2014 he\nhas his stall there, and he was selling there in Prague. So he wa \u2014 he had his\napartment in Prague because many times he was staying there four or five days.\nAnd he had a yearly ticket to Prague by train because he was so often there. And\nusually when he came back from Prague, he usually always brought some presents\nfor the children. He was very \u2014 both my parents, but especially my father, because\nhe had \u2014 he could afford \u2014 he had brought always from Prague small gifts for us,\nfor the children, and for my mother, too. And usually Sunday morning, used to\ncome to our hose \u2014 house, the people from the villages who used to buy for him all\nthose cattles and so on, and he was paying them. So many people remembered him\nvery well. Even here in Detroit for example, Sidnu(ph) Greenburger, who is a\nmember of B\u2019nai Moishe remembers him very well, and when I came to this\ncountry and he taught me here, welcomed me. You know, Michu(ph), because they\ncalled me in Hungarian name, if you are a\u2014 a human being like your father was, I\nwill tip my hat in front of you [indecipherable] because very few people in the\nworld was a fa \u2014a father and a human being like your father, because he actually\nApril 7, 1997\nhelped survive in Czechoslov \u2014 in Michalovee and the other villages, people who\nmake their living through him.",
        "Q: Non-Jews as well as Jews?",
        "A: Only Jews. Some non-Jews too, because they were like helpers when they \u2014\nbecause we \u2014 he used to send, almost every week, a whole railroad car full with\ncattles or lambs, and we had, for example, in Michalovee, a big \u2014 like a storage\nplace, where during the winter, that people were \u2014 we \u2014 they used to cut ice from\nthe river and we mare \u2014 during the winter we make in this big places, pieces of ice\nwhat he used during summertime when we als \u2014 he was sending the slaughtered\ncattles and lambs to Prague, so he put in a railroad \u2014 railroad car, and it was a one\npiece of ice \u2014 of straw \u2014 ice, then the cattles, with \u2014 because the bellies were open,\nthey put with the bellies on the ice. Then again, like a \u2014",
        "Q: Layer.",
        "A: \u2014 a layer of ice, again with cattles, or lambs, and it was up to the ceiling from\none side of the car, and the other side of the car, because it was few hundred.

So then they\ndelivered immediately from the railroad to the stall where he was selling, and beside\nApril 7, 1997\nthat, he had even people who were in Prague buying from him, the \u2014 they were\ncommissioners. So in the one way, he was selling his own merchandise, how to say,\ncattles, what is left, what the commissioners didn\u2019t buy in Prague from him.",
        "Q: So \u2014 but he did business with non-Jews then?",
        "A: They were Jews.",
        "Q: They were all Jews?",
        "A: The \u2014 the commissioner\u2019s mainly was \u2014 his name I remember, his name was\nVitoslav(ph) Krauss, and the other one was Appelus(ph), but I don\u2019t remember.\nAnd it\u2019s very interesting that I escaped from Czechoslovakia act \u2014 in 1968 and \u201969,\nafter the Russian came in, I went from \u2014 I escaped illegally, with two suitcases. I\nleft every [indecipherable] everything there for the government. Then\n[indecipherable] were sentenced in absentia to two years in prison because we left\nillegally \u2014 legally they didn\u2019t let you. So we left like for vacation. It was very hard\nto get, because we went from Czechoslovakia to Hungary, from Hungary to \u2014 to\nYugoslavia. From Yugoslavia to Austria. In Vienna we registered in the HIAS in\nthe Jewish immigration office. There we stayed about for two weeks, and they send\nus to Rome, to Italy, where 1s the main concentration of refugees, especially of\nJewish refugees on the HIAS. And by the way, I was there working in Rome, we\nstayed in Rome 15 months approximately, because I was working on hire \u2014 they\nApril 7, 1997\nhired me, after three months I started to speak Italian, because I had learned it in\ngymnasium when I went, so I learned very easy. So I was working one year in\nHIAS in Rome, like an interpreter. So I stayed 15 months, you know \u2014 and by the\nway, I used to go the first time, after 22 years to go to a shul, to a synagogue,\nbecause in Czechoslovakia, first of all, we to \u2014 under communism it was very\ndangerous to show that you are religious, or you going \u2014 secondly, there was no\nJews, so I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go. So I went to a little shul there in Rome,\nand suddenly I took a prayer book and I found in the prayer book a card what was a\nticket, a steady ticket, a year\u2019s ticket for my father for the streetcars in Prague. Can\nyou imagine? And I had here the card, not long time ago, and I am very sorry, I\ncannot find. I was looking, and I don\u2019t remember if I gave it to the Holocaust\nmuseum here in Detroit, or I put somewhere. And I had the card for many years,\nand I\u2019m sorry, otherwise I would give the card to you, to show that 1t was \u2014 and\nwhen I was in Rome, and they called me the first time to the \u2014 I had \u2014 had the\naliyah, to show \u2014 to called me to the Torah. And I was very fluent, I remember,\nbecause I wa \u2014 go back to how it was in Czechoslovakia and was praying. So I said\nthe first brocha by the aliyah very fluently. And suddenly, when I had to continue,\nsuddenly I stopped and I couldn\u2019t get a word from my mouth. And they thought, the\npeople who are standing next to me, they thought that, what\u2019s happened? What\u2019s\nApril 7, 1997\nhap \u2014 and it took me about two minutes to ga \u2014 get \u2014 continue because I was \u2014 I was\nso excited, and for me was \u2014 is so something that I cannot imagine, I couldn\u2019t\nimagine that after so many years I\u2019m standing in front of the Torah by a-aliyah. So\nthen I told them, so they told me they can understand that. So that what it happened\nto me in Rome. And I wanted only to say that in Czechoslovakia, because it was\nvery dangerous to have some prayers or to go to a shul. So I had the prayer book,\nand my father gave me the idea \u2014 we had the drawer in our dresser. And behind the\nback of the drawer, in the wall, in the back of the dresser was a little space. So I put\nthe prayer book in back of the drawer, and besi \u2014 behind the drawer, I put a\nplywood, so when you opened the drawer, you couldn\u2019t see nothing in the back.\nAnd from the back I made a little hole, a small hole that you can push down the \u2014\nthe plywood with a wire. So it was a small \u2014 and when I opened the drawer and I\npushed the \u2014 with th-the wire the plywood, so the plywood came down and I took\nmy prayer book. So at least on the high holidays, approximate, I knew where they\nare, so I was praying, because otherwise what \u2014 when my sister escaped from\nCzechoslovakia with her husband in 1948, and then my other sister with her\nhusband in 1950, illegally, and I gave some money out, I helped them. So then it\nwas very dangerous because the police came after me. I was in \u2014 even in custody\nfor \u2014 for a few days, and they even slapped me because I didn\u2019t want to tell them h-\nApril 7, 1997\nho \u2014 which way my sister escaped and left Czechoslovakia. So, then I \u2014 so I knew\nthat was genderus \u2014 dangerous to pray, so that\u2019s way \u2014 and I knew that exactly, at\nleast twice during the time in those year, in 1950 - \u201951, maybe \u201952, the secret police\ncame during the day when we were in [indecipherable] my wife at work, they were\nchecking my a \u2014 our apartment for certain things they will find, because \u2014\nespecially my wife, she realized \u2014 she opened, for example there, her underwear\nwas, that it was put a different way back, or our other things what we had in our\ndrawers, or in the \u2014 1n our \u2014 1n our closet. So that\u2019s \u2014 we knew exactly they were\nsecretly \u2014 they came to our apartment to check, and to make \u2014 if they will find\nsomething against me. Maybe they were more times than twice, but twice we knew\nexactly for sure. So when I \u2014 they took me many times, about three times I wa \u2014 I\nthink, to the secret police, and they were even telling me, if I won\u2019t tell how the \u2014\nmy sister went, and what connections I have with my sisters overseas in the west,\nthat they will send me to Jachymov. This was very a dangerous [indecipherable] it\nwas uran-uranium \u2014 uranium m-mine, that they were sending the worst criminals or\npolitically who are dangerous for them. And most of the people even died then in\nthose mines, or if they after many years they were lucky, came back, their whole \u2014\ntheir life \u2014 they were sick with \u2014 from the uran \u2014 from \u2014",
        "Q: Radiation?\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: From radiation. So I was in very, very danger \u2014 so my wife helped me actually,\nthis is \u2014 she \u2014",
        "Q: Well, I want to come back and ask you more about this, because this sounds\nsimilar to what you went through during the war even. You \u2014 you \u2014 you said you\nhad \u2014 you davened in \u2014 in \u2014 in Rome. So you \u2014 you must have had a \u2014 a very good",

        "A: Background, sure.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you \u2014 you went to cheder?",
        "A: Yeah, eight years.",
        "Q: So tell me what \u2014 tell me what that was like in \u2014 in Michalovee.",
        "A: In [indecipherable] cheder, that was a different \u2014 a little bit like here, because\nwhen we started in cheder when I was five and a half years old. So there was\ndifferent, there in cheder was first grade, second grade, third grade, and each year\nyou were more advanced. For example, your \u2014 and our teachers, we call them\nrabbis. And really, actually, the rabbis have beards and everything. And it was like\nOrthodox. And in first grade we started to learn the alphabet \u2014 the \u2014 the Aleph-\nAleph-Bet. And then to \u2014 how to \u2014 to daven and how to read. Second gr-grade we\nApril 7, 1997\nstarted to learn a little the sidrah, the Torah. Then in third grade we had went and\nstarted to learn harasha(ph). In fourth grade we started to learn for example\ngemura(ph), and so far [indecipherable] tanakh. And so, then we came to the\nseventh grade, actually we were very highly educated in Jewish studies, starting like\nwith this \u2014 all the \u2014 like I\u2019m saying, the gemura(ph), tanakh with explanation, with\nRussia, and everything. So when I wa \u2014 get Bar Mitzvah, actually I could go almost\nto learn for a rabbi, really, because I was so highly educated.",
        "Q: But you \u2014 you had a \u2014 a secular education as well? Y-You \u2014 you didn\u2019t \u2014 you\ndidn\u2019t only have Jewish education?",

        "A: What do you mean, when I started school?",
        "Q: Well, what \u2014 would you go to cheder first?",
        "A: Yeah, I went to cheder first, because I started only few months before I started\npublic school, because public school I started when I was six year old.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "Q: So what time of the day would you go to cheder?",
        "A: In cheder, I get up at five o\u2019clock in the morning every day, summer, winter. I\ntook a small, like a can with warm coffee, and this was my \u2014 actually mine bread \u2014\nmy \u2014 my lunch. And we put \u2014 because in this time in cheder we had all \u2014 not\nalways, but the heat, we put the wood, and I tell you how to cook \u2014",
        "Q: Stoves.",
        "A: Stoves. So on the top it was \u2014 the stove was from metal. So we put on the top of\nthe stove our cans with the coffee. So wh-when we finished, we finished about 7:30,\nso we took breakfast. We ate the breakfast, and immediately we went across the\nstreet to the public school, that started about 8:15. So actually, I had approximately\nhalf hour time between finishing in cheder, and going to public school. There I\nstayed in public school aqu \u2014 approximately til 12 o\u2019clock. So I rushed home,\n12:15, there I have lunch at home. And quarter to two I went back to the cheder, and\nstayed about til five o\u2019clock, sometimes 5:30. And in this goes all the time about for\nseven years. And sometimes in wintertime I went early in the morning in winter,\nand I had to go through snow to that knee high, and I went to cheder. I don\u2019t\nremember that I didn\u2019t want, I don\u2019t remember that it was closed because the\nweather, or something like that. In between this time, specially when I was 10 - 12\nyears old, I was \u2014 liked very much soccer. So between this time, I had to find some\nApril 7, 1997\nfree time to play soccer too, because behind \u2014 we had the big house, two big\ngardens, with fruit, with vegetables, with everything. So a\u2014 and behind the big\ngarden was the soccer field. So actually all my free time I grew up on the soccer\nfield. And especially in later years, after 15 - 16 years old, I played for the club, for\nthere in Michalovece, soccer. So, my life from the age five til about 13 was actually\n12 hours a day, approximately, cheder and school. Even when I went 1n high school,\nwhen I was 11 years old, it was the same.",

There were about maybe 10 houses or eight\nhouses, and most of them were Jewish.

        "Q: Do you remember any anti-Semitism in school?",

And not only\nmyself, it was two other boys, who had very difficulties to study with him, because\nhe was the principal there in our class for two years. So at \u2014 I had very difficult as I\nunderstand it even. I had so sharp that he called \u2014 he let \u2014 called my father that I\nwas \u2014 I-I wasn\u2019t behave or something. But it really wasn\u2019t true because he went\nvery much after Jews, and the other two guys didn\u2019t fini \u2014 the one didn\u2019t finish a\nyear before, in the fourth grade, and the \u2014 the second one, his father was very, very\nrich, so he took him out and sent him to another city, to KoSice. But my father said,\nI have no choice, so you know what, better \u2014 and he had the friend who had the very\nApril 7, 1997\ngood store with hardware, and he was willing to take me there. And my father, what\nhis plan was that I will work there like apri \u2014 aprinse \u2014",

I mean, then\nin 1938 came \u2014 the Czechoslovak Republic was divided, especially in 1938, we\nsaw what\u2019s going on. It was Kristallnacht in Germany, and so on. So we saw that\nit was there \u2014 there gender \u2014 danger. So I was continuing to work in this store til\n1940, when I went in the labor camp.",

I mean, as long as it wasn\u2019t so\ndangerous, especially 1940 and \u201941, when they started to persecute the Jews, when\nthey came in 1939 or 1940, the all \u2014 the laws against the Jews in Slovakia, what\nwas actually a copy of the Nuremberg laws against the Jews, that the Slovak\ngovernment accepted to be the same in 1939 - 1940.",
        "Q: This is the Zidovsky Kodex\u201d?",
        "A: Right. This is Zidovsky Kodex, yeah. So then it was very hard, and it was\ndangerous. So we tried our best, I don\u2019t remember exactly for how long, til what\nyear, because that was the situation there.",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 was your family aware of the political situation? Did you \u2014 you remember\nMasaryk, for example?",
        "A: Oh very well. Masa \u2014 Masaryk was a pro \u2014 professor of philosophy. Actually,\nhe was \u2014 the beginning, with his help was established the Czechoslovak Republic\nin 1918, and he died in 1935. After him was the President BeneS. He was not \u2014 he\nwas maybe a politician, but \u2014 but he ra \u2014 I think he wa \u2014 won \u2014 they blame him, and\nI think rightly so, because he actually \u2014 not that he helped, but he was afraid, and he\nApril 7, 1997\nsold actually, the Czechoslovak Republic in 1938 to Chamberlain and to Hitler.\nBecause Chamberlain came to the Czechoslovakia, he made an agreement with\nHitler, he \u2014- Chamberlain was very trustworthy, and he carries a piece of paper that\nHitler guaranteed peace in the \u2014 in Europe, and guaranteed after the Sudetenland,\nCzechoslovakia gave, with the help of BeneS, and actually Chamberlain was\npushing him, gave the Sudetenland to Germany, and Hitler promised that\u2019s it, and\nCzechoslovakia [indecipherable]. And Chamberlain came to London, it was, and\neven today it\u2019s somewhere a tape. He came down from his plane and showed a\npiece of paper, I brought peace to \u2014 to England, I brought peace for Europe. And\nhe was very much mistaken, but actually, he brought not the peace to London, he br\n\u2014 brought the concentration camps to London. He was very naive.",
        "Q: Do you remember reading about the Munich pact in the \u2014 in the newspapers, in",

        "Q: Is that when you found out about this, or was it after the war that you \u2014",
        "A: No, we read, because it came out in the czecho \u2014 in Czechoslovakia, 1n the\nnewspaper, there were \u2014 that was happened in \u2014 in Munich, actually in some\nnewspaper who were \u2014 openly said that Czechoslovakia was sold.

        "Q: And \u2014 and what was your \u2014 people in your family, were they concerned about \u2014\nabout Hitler at the time?",
        "A: Very much so. And we tried, because my father still was traveling to Prague, so\nhe tried in 1938, even he went to Prague when it was Slovakia and\n[indecipherable] that Germans were there. He still had the opportunity about twice\nto go to Prague, and he tried very hard to get paper for us, because he had his\nbrothers there and they tried to get out us from Czechoslovakia, but it was almost\nimpossible then already. So, I think I cannot blame him because he \u2014 I know that he\ntried in \u2014 end of 1938, because he saw the situation. He went to the American\nembassy, but it was hard, because it was co \u2014 very complicated to get the papers,\nfirst of all to get out from Czechoslovakia, and to get the visas from the American\nembassy, because there 1s \u2014 was a quota. They were sorting people who they let out\neven before 1938. So he didn\u2019t manage it fe \u2014 he tried very hard, but it was\nimpossible to \u2014 even he had, in 1938 was the World Fair in New York. So ra \u2014 his\nbrothers sent him papers that he will come to the \u2014 to the World Fair, but it was\nbefore Munich. So, between this time came Munich and came the occupation, so it\n\u2014he couldn\u2019t get in for the World Fair.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "Q: Did \u2014 you think that the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the tone of \u2014 in Michalovce changed, I\nmean did \u2014 was there a [indecipherable] in Michalovce, do you remember?",
        "A: Very mu \u2014 immediately after \u2014 they started to make not pogroms, but anti-\nSemitic signs before March 1939 when the \u2014 it actually was hi \u2014 with the help of\nHitler was established the Slovak Republic, and the \u2014 Hitler occupied\n[indecipherable]. So \u2014 and after 1939, the 15 \u2014 starting 15 of March, started\nimmediately against Jews in the newspapers, on the radio, all over. And they were\nstarting immediately again with \u2014 they had black uniforms with high boots, and\nwith the low \u2014 the caps like officers. And they were driving all over, screaming, and\nmanifestations, egging Jews. So we have to hide, we had to \u2014 we were afraid to get\nout. And then later on, in later years, they made when they came in 1940 \u2014 I think\n1940, started that you had to \u2014 the Jews have to wear the \u2014 the yellow star, and then\nit was curfew, and Jews couldn\u2019t get out on the street after six o\u2019clock in the\nevening, til six o\u2019clock in the morning. So and it was \u2014 and later on we couldn\u2019t go\n\u2014 go to amovie. For Jews was not allowed to go, for example, to a movie, or any\npublic places. So they started actually, the end of 1939 - 1940, all the persecution of\nthe Jews. And in 1941, when I was in labor camp, and this time all the Jews have to\nregister, and that way they have specially the young people and the single people.\nSo actually that\u2019s way, they \u2014 my brother had to go to register in 1941, and I didn\u2019t\nApril 7, 1997\nregister because I was in labor camp, so that\u2019s \u2014 I was lucky, when I come home in\nMarch 1942, they didn\u2019t have my name, because I wasn\u2019t registered, but my brother\nwas registered, so immediately in March or in April, they took him to the labor\ncamp \u2014 to the concentration camp.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t register?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, because I wasn\u2019t home. I was 1n labor camp.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and when you came back from labor camp, you \u2014 you didn\u2019t register \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, no, they didn\u2019t \u2014 because the registration was in 1941.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: So then they had all the names, so they didn\u2019t go then after the people. Actually,\nmaybe they didn\u2019t know that some people were released in 1942 from \u2014 from labor\ncamp. But then, as they went after the families in 1942, later on, so then I went \u2014\nthen we went to hiding with my father, with my mother. And then \u2014 and this time in\n1943 or \u201944, because there was \u2014 in 19-four \u2014 ni-nine \u2014 1942 - \u201943, they were safe in\nHungary. The you \u2014 Jews were actually much freer, it sa \u2014 wasn\u2019t the \u2014 the Jewish\nKodex, what this was in Slovakia. So my \u2014 my father sent my mother and then my\nyounger sister Lola to Hungary, to Uszura(ph), it was a \u2014 a city about \u2014 about 30\nmiles from Michalovce, because she had there her family.",
        "Q: Your mother was from Uszura(ph)?\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: So, they were assured they were actually safe in Hungary. But what\u2019s happened\nlater on, in 1944, in May, they started to take with the \u2014 Horthy came in in\nHungary. So they started to take the Jews from Hungary 19 my \u2014 April, May \u2014 in\nMay 1944. So that\u2019s when my sister and my mother went with her family in\nHungary to the concentration camp.",
        "Q: To Auschwitz.",
        "A: To Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Remember Tiso?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Tiso?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I remember. Tiso actually, like I wrote in this there, he made the\nagreement with Hitler that he will get rid for the je \u2014 from the Jews. Actually, there\nwere \u2014 before, the prime minister in this time before was Tuka, then he died. Then\nhe and Tiso actually made agreement special \u2014 Tiso, he went to Berlin specially to\nmake an agreement with Hitler in 1940, I think it was, that Hitler will help him to\nget rid of the Jews in Slovakia. And he paid slova \u2014 the Slovak Republic paid for\neach Jew who went to concentration camp, they prayed \u2014 they paid to Hitler, I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly how many hundred dollars for each person. And so that\u2019s\nApril 7, 1997\nwhat th-the \u2014 actually it started, the transportation of Jews from Slovakia, and he\nwas very much involved, Tiso, and Mach, the interior minister.",
        "Q: Sano Mach.",
        "A: Sano Mach. And \u2014 I wanted to say \u2014 and that\u2019s why Hitler was sending to\nBratislava Eichmann, and a German Slovak, the name was Carmasine(ph). They\nactually were organizing the transporting of the Jews from Slovakia. And\nEichmann were \u2014 he stayed very much [indecipherable] for a month in\nBratislava, who was helping Carmasine(ph) to make the transportation go.",
        "Q: Did you know about all this while it was happening?",
        "A: We were all \u2014 we knew only like we were talking between Jews, he heard this,\nhe heard that, something like that. But we knew that Carmasine(ph) was helping,\nbut for example, from eich \u2014 but how far and how much \u2014 how much, and\nEichmann, | think we actually knew more after the war.",
        "Q: Had you heard of Auschwitz?",
        "A: Very much, later on, that you knew, because actually the whole propaganda was\nthere that they are taking the young people, like for labor in Germany, in Poland \u2014\nand in Poland. They didn\u2019t mention \u2014 it wasn\u2019t mention about concentration camp.\nWe knew only later on because some news came from Poland that some people th-\nthey don\u2019t \u2014 aren\u2019t alive any more, that immediately they went to \u2014 after few weeks\nApril 7, 1997\nor months, straight to the ovens. And then I don\u2019t remember exactly, then we heard\nthat they \u2014 when they came to Auschwitz, they are dividing people to the right and\nto the left, that people who go to work and people who go to the ovens, to the\nchamb \u2014 to the \u2014 but it was no \u2014 nothing official in the Slovak press, or something\nlike that. They said always that the young people were \u2014 went to \u2014 to labor.",
        "Q: But the \u2014 but the Kodex was public, the laws were public.",
        "A: The la-laws were publicked.",
        "Q: D-Do you remember where you were when the war started, 1939?",
        "A: In Slovakia, I was at home, 19 \u2014 in Poland in September 1939.",
        "Q: And how did you find out about the war?",
        "A: It was in the paper, this was 1n the paper that the \u2014 the German, because the\nPoland started th-the war, so the \u2014 the German made attack, and they are continuing\nto occupy Poland.",
        "Q: But Slovakia wasn\u2019t involved at that \u2014 at that \u2014",
        "A: Slovakia was involved later on, in \u201939, and the \u2014 there it has even \u2014 had even the\nname, the \u2014 the Slovak army, the Slovak, it was so cold [indecipherable] divizie,\nthe first divis \u2014 division who they sent, certain \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 cannot tell you exactly\nhow many thousand people they sent to help to win the war with Hitler against the\nGerman, against the Russian. Then later on in the Slovak, they \u2014 even the people\nApril 7, 1997\ndid realize, it was like, in the beginning like secret, but then they started to bring\nback injured or dead soldiers, then the Slovak people started to know that the \u2014\nactually the Slovak army is in the war against the Poland and Russian. But in the\npress it was always written like heroes, because they are saving the freedom, they\nare saving the world, because they are fighting against the Bolsheviks, against the\ncommunists and so on.",
        "Q: So this was in \u2014 I mean, on the Russian front.",
        "A: On the \u2014 first on the Polish, but 1t was the \u2014 actually the Polish war was over in\nfew months, so they went there \u2014 against Russia. But then it started again, actually\nthe main involvement of the Slovak army was in 1941 in June when they started the\nwar, the German against th-the Russian. Because before Stalin make the agreement,\nthe so-called agreement with the German that they won\u2019t fight to each other. But I\ndon\u2019t know how far Stalin or Hitler knew that it\u2019s on-only \u2014 not evidently to \u2014\nactually to gain some time.",
        "Q: Now what \u2014 when the \u2014 when the war started, did that have an effect on your\nfamily? In 1939, was there rationing, were \u2014 were people fighting \u2014",
        "A: It started, yeah, it started immediately the rationing. We get some so-called \u2014\nhow do they call? Stamps or something, but it was later on, but 1t was only maybe\nthree or four items, main items. It wasn\u2019t so bad, like for example, in Bohemia, in\nApril 7, 1997\nMoravia, or in Germany. But it started \u2014 but it \u2014 we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t see tha \u2014 that it\nwasn\u2019t enough, but it wasn\u2019t plenty. So we didn\u2019t feel the rationing so much in 1940\n- \u00b04]. Later on maybe on \u2014 when the war started in \u2014 with Russia, then it was\nharder. Then it was more rationing.",
        "Q: Wh-What \u2014 why \u2014 let me take back just a one step before. When the \u2014 when the\nSlovak Republic was declared in 1939, the \u2014 and the laws were passed right \u2014 right\naway \u2014 anti-Semitic laws were passed, you said.",
        "A: Yeah, but officially was later on. When it came to Jewish Kodex, I don\u2019t\nremember, it was late \u00b039, or beginning of 1940.",
        "Q: What kind of effect did that have on your family? Would \u2014 were people\nfrightened, did you \u2014",
        "A: Well, we were very frightened, we were very afraid. Some Christians even\nstopped to communicate with us. But later on, for example, when they started to\ntake in families in 1940 \u2014 late \u201942 - \u201943, so we were hiding. We had the neighbor\nwho we had to bribe him so he will be \u2014 well, because it was always said \u2014 always\nwe had some echo, at night they will start to take the families. Or tomorrow. So we\nwent immediately to our neighbor, and they were hiding in a basement there. He\nhad potatoes, and we were hiding over the potatoes and he was covering these\npotatoes or so, with a blanket, and it was very \u2014 because to go down to the\nApril 7, 1997\nbasement, it was like the floor, it was wood. So when you open the door, it was \u2014\nyou couldn\u2019t see that there is a door to the basement. And we knew for example,\nmany times they came to our house to look for us, and they didn\u2019t find us. So many\ntimes then, later on when I came home from labor camp in 1942, they still\ncontinuing to take young people and single people to the labor \u2014 to the\nconcentration camp. So we had the Jewish neighbor, and there was a brother from\nour neighbor, he was single. His name was Alfred Salzman(ph). He lives in New\nYork, he\u2019s still alive. Then he went \u2014 so with him, I used to, especially\nsummertime, because [indecipherable] father was planting field, corn, and wh-\nwheat, and so on. So we run always in the \u2014 the night in the field to ha \u2014 go in\nhiding. And we stayed there in two, three days. We had sa \u2014 for a piece of bread, or\neven sometimes water, some [indecipherable] not water, because we are afra \u2014 we\nwere afraid to come back to our house because they were still taking young people.\nSo \u2014",
        "Q: So would you hide with the family? Your family would go too?",
        "A: No, they \u2014 this time, 1942, they started to take the families late \u201942, or in \u201943. So\nthat \u2014 then I was hiding with my family, but in this time, when they started to take\nfamilies, my mother and my youngest sister, they were in Hungary already. And\nsecondly, in this time, my father had the opportunity, so we had so-called \u2014 he\nApril 7, 1997\nbought a permission for the government, well you know, it was bribing, so it\u2019s true,\nsome people who had a-access to some in the ministry or so, that had the piece of\npaper that is a letters to stay.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Sure \u2014 yeah, something like that. So we had the opportunity always two months,\nor three months to delay, actually. Even other families that taken already to the\nconcentration camp. But still, it was a little like \u2014 a little like a cover, or we felt a\nlittle shi \u2014 more secure there the other \u2014 other, but we didn\u2019t know when it was safe.\nWe got to recognize this permission what you had. So that\u2019s where later on my\nfather sent my mother and younger sister to a safe place, to Hungary. But then it\nwa-wasn\u2019t worth the danger, we couldn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t worth it. We couldn\u2019t afford all\nthe \u2014 they didn\u2019t get the permission already, any permission. So then I was hiding\nwith my father, with my other sister re \u2014 some different places. And then we went in\nninet \u2014 in April 1944, because it was actually a few hundred kilometers, the Russian\nf\u2014 the front was approaching. So all the Jews from eastern Slovakia had to move,\nand to \u2014 from eastern Slovakia to the west. So they sent us, if you had to \u2014 and my\nf-father had someone in Bratislava, in the capital, a family who he used to make\nsome a little business before the war. So we stayed there for a few days, and then\nwe took an apartment in Bratislava for a few weeks.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "Q: This was a non-Jewish family?",
        "A: No, this was a Jewish family, still a Jewish family. And we took an apartment in\nBratislava, but then it was dangerous, especially in \u2014 after 1t was the partisan\nuprising in August 1944, in Banskebisatran(ph), Slovakia, so we have to leave\nBratislava, and then where we went \u2014 I went with my father and my sister to Nova\nVestu nad Vahom(ph), from there \u2014 then we went actually to concentration camp.\nAnd from Nova Vestu nad Vahom(ph), my sister disappeared, and I went, because\nit started then, the German came, occupied Slovakia, so I went there in the woods,\nand I went to the partisans. So that \u2014",
        "Q: Let me \u2014 let me take you back just for a second before we start with the \u2014 with\nthe \u2014 cause I want to know about the st \u2014 the uprising, and your role in this. Just a\ncouple of questions about, from 1939 to 1941, or so, some of the non-Jews that you\nknew, did \u2014 did \u2014 did you hear from any of them? Did they offer to help? Did\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Very few.",
        "Q: \u2014 express any sympathy?",
        "A: Very few, very few, because most likely was Catholic \u2014 Catholic. And some\npeople who were so-called Evangelical Protestants, they were actually always\nagainst the Slovak Republic because they were not only \u2014 not only because they \u2014\nApril 7, 1997\nthey were persecuting the Jews, but because they were \u2014 they were against the catol\n\u2014 Catholic religion, against the Catholic hierarchy, especially they knew that the\npriest actually, of a fascistic Slovak Republic 1s the president.",
        "Q: Tiso, yeah.",
        "A: A ca\u2014 Catholic priest. So that\u2019s where they, if they could, if 1t wasn\u2019t very risky,\nthey had sympathy, most of them. But very few Catholics. And by the way, for\nexample like I mentioned, what my father get a permission order to stay, they didn\u2019t\ntake us immediately to concentration camp. It was a very [indecipherable] one,\nbecause Tiso used to go to a small city in Slovakia, western Slovakia, it\u2019s called\nBanovce nad Bebravou. And there he used to go Sunday morning, so-called, to\npray the \u2014 the \u2014 1n that church to make sermons or how you call it. So, in Catholic\nchurch. And there was a widow pharmacist, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, and they\nsaid that she was his girlfriend. So \u2014 and people had access to this pharmacist, to\nthis woman, and she took the money and through her people get permission there,\nthey can stay longer in Slovakia. So actually it was a secret, but people are talking\nthat his girlfriend actually was helping Jews, because she had access to get so \u2014 and\nhow far it went.",

        "Q: When you left home, what was it like?",
        "A: Very sad. Because we knew \u2014 we knew already, it was in 1940, that the Slovak\nRepublic that this anti-Semitism, and they are going against the Jews. So actually,\nnot me, not my family knew what will happen to me. And we had very few\nopportunities then even to write home, to let know. So it was very hard. But in one\nway actually, the labor camp saved my life, because if I would be home like my\nbrother, I would be registered, and I would g-go to concentration camp. Yeah, and I\nwant to mention one other thing what happened to me. In 1943, yeah, in this time\nwas still safe in Hungary, my \u2014 my mother and my sister were all there. And my\nwife \u2014 my father actually, made arrangement that I will go to Hungary too, because\nit was safe. And so he found some \u2014 a Christian guy who, my f-father paid him,\nwho would take me over the border, because the border wasn\u2019t far away. And\nreally, I went with him, he took me over the border, he took me there, we had to go\nthrough a small river, so f \u2014 deep in the water, about maybe 25 or 30 feet wide. So I\nhad to go \u2014I took off my clothes and go so far in water, and I was in Hungary\nalready. So he took me there in a small village to a house, and he told me, you have\nApril 7, 1997\nto wait here, and a other guy will come, and we\u2019ll take you to Uszkurat(ph), where\nmy mother was, it was about maybe 15 miles or so. And so I was waiting, it was\nabout three o\u2019clock in the morning. And suddenly about six o\u2019clock in the morning,\ninstead of the guy who would take me to Hungary came the Hungarian police, and\nthey immediately took me and took me back to the border to Slovakia. And when\nthey ha \u2014 they took me to the Slovakian border, to the Slovakian police, they\nbrought me back to Michalovce and put me in jail, because I wa [indecipherable]\nand they put me in jail. There were other people, about 30 of them, young people,\nJews, who were preparing like they are cou \u2014 almost like a transport to \u2014 or to the\nconcentration camp. And there was in Michalovee, th-this jail was only \u2014 where\nwas the main office, the city hall, there was a basement, and there were keeping\nonly those people. And there was alway like who used to be a guard, like a \u2014 like a\n\u2014 what [inaudible] there, who used to be there, yeah, a civilian person. And\nsuddenly, the day that they brought me, it was a day before a national holiday. It\nwas in July, I think, where there was a national religious holiday, a Christian\nholiday. And they put in the basement immediately my \u2014 there \u2014 some people saw\nme when they brought me to Michalovee, that the police take me \u2014 took me to the \u2014\nthere to the jail. So immediately they tak \u2014 talk my father. So \u2014 and 1n this time,\nsomething happened with my \u2014 I had my shoe when was walking so much, and my\nApril 7, 1997\nheel, I had some damage [indecipherable] my heel, you know, some blood and so\non, and it suddenly get the red. So I-I get some infection. And my father, when he\nheard that I back in jail, he had somebo \u2014 because close to our house was the\nhospital, and he had \u2014 had a doctor who he was very close. So I\u2014 he gave me some\nmoney, and the next morning, because it was a holiday, he came to the jail and told\nthis guy, listen, I heard here you have a \u2014 someone who had some infection. I have\nto check him. So, he gave immediately, because my father gave some money to the\ndoctor, he gave a little money to this guy, he let him in. He get \u2014 take a look at me,\nand he really saw \u2014 I can you show me, even today I have a scar, and he showed \u2014\ntook a [indecipherable] and he showed the guards and said, look, this is red and\nswollen, I have to take him immediately to the hospital to take \u2014 to open it. And you\ncan tell the g \u2014 the \u2014 the Hlinka guard or someone that I took him out and they can\nsee him in the hospital. So he took me to the hospital, immediately he opened it. He\nmade a big \u2014 a big bandage on it. I don\u2019t even remember if he freeze it or not, but\nprobably, because I felt some pain immediately. And he put me in a room, and\nimmediately aft \u2014 in the afternoon, there came two guardists(ph), one\n[indecipherable] police, and what immediately called the doctor, the doctor went\nwith he \u2014 with them to the room, and they told him \u2014 he told them, look, I cannot\nleave him, he has temperature \u2014 and I really had temperature, because it was really\nApril 7, 1997\nan infection [indecipherable]. And I cannot even open the wound. I have here the\npapers of what I wrote down, what I did to him. And you have to wait til take, two\nor three days til he can get out, or I will see what\u2019s happen, because it\u2019s so\ndangerous that he can die even, a so dangerous infection. So it took I don\u2019t know\nhow long because they were arguing with him there in the office. So they let me\ndown. And every five or six hours came a guardist, or a policeman to check if I am\nthere. And can you imagine? I swear to you that it\u2019s true what I am telling you. The\nnext morning, when it was right after the holiday, early in the morning, all the 29\npeople too \u2014 they took away \u2014 that went to concentration camp. And after the war, I\nmet only one of them. He was originally from Lithuania, but he lived in Slovakia\nafter t\u2014 about two years, about three years. And he told me, as far as he knew,\nimmediately in 1942 \u2014 for \u2014 for \u2014 1943, 22 people, they\u2019re shot or died in\nAuschwitz. And he survived, and ya \u2014 as sla \u2014 as far as he knows, he said, I don\u2019t\nknow if someone else survived. So then I stayed in the hospital about 10 days, and\nthen they let me go because the \u2014 the older people left already. So \u2014 but they had\nmy name, so that\u2019s where I went war \u2014 in hiding and so on. And I was suspicious\nbecause they had my name that I tried to go to Hungary. So that\u2019s a other story\nwhat \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I told the whole story.",
        "Q: You changed your name.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: Yeah, and th-this time, it was end of 1943, again, 1t was a Bratislav priest, not\nfar in the village, who for money gave you a Christian birth certificate, and then for\nother money, my father bought Christian papers for me, for him, and for my sister.\nSo actually \u2014 then when we left from Michalovee in 1944, in April, actually I\nalways what I\u2019m \u2014 in Bratislava sometimes they make identifications. They\nstopped you on the street even, during the day, show identification. So I showed Uri\nBenko(ph), present identification card with a picture, with \u2014 with a birth certificate,\nwith a citizenship, with everything, all the papers that I need to have.",
        "Q: What was the name again?",
        "A: Uri Benko(ph).",
        "Q: Uri Benko(ph).",
        "A: And I\u2019m fir \u2014 you know, and I lived to \u2014 under this name, even like a partisan,\neven in \u2014 in hiding. And I was very sorry because when I was liberated, and I \u2014 after\nthe second or three days, I met some people who I knew before, even Christian\npeople and some Jewish people started to come from \u2014 from labor camp already. It\nwas in April, in May. And I said, what the hell I need this paper, I throwed it, I\nthrew it there. Oh, I don\u2019t want nothing to have it. And I \u2014I feel very sorry because\ntoday it would be a very documentary [indecipherable] because it would be really\ntrue that \u2014 as to what I am saying, that I lived on these papers. And you know what\nApril 7, 1997\nhappened, I have a other story what \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I \u2014 I told that. When I was\nliberated, just April the 4\"\" \u2014 last week, it was 52 years I was liberated. And I don\u2019t\nknow if I told you the story; I was caught twice by the German in 1944 and 1945, I\ndon\u2019t know if I mentioned that. If you want I can tell 1t to you again, the story. In\n1944 in October, I was \u2014 end of October, or beginning November. I was with a \u2014\none group of partisans. They had \u2014 because this was woods, and there were \u2014 you\nknow, this is a place there in the woods, what you have for example, five, six\nhouses, then you have woods, you have nothing, and then again so few houses.\nThey call it in Slovak Kopanitsa(ph), I don\u2019t know how to translate in English. So,\nand they sent me down, because then in the little [indecipherable] village, it\u2019s\ncalled Kriener(ph), that was the name of the village. And there were two brothers,\nChristians. They were Evangelics, not Ca-Catholics. The one was \u2014 had the bakery,\nhe was collaborating with the partisans, so he baked bread for the partisans, and\nalways send it, or we came down and took from him bread. The other brother had a\nlittle grocery store, and by the way, he was buying, it was in the fall, he was buying\nfruit; apples, plums [indecipherable] pears, and they made \u2014 and it \u2014 that was like a\nsmall factory, what they made from the fruit some muSt, you know, for drinking,\nyou know, what it \u2014 how you calling \u2014",
        "Q: Cider-y \u2014\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: Cider, something like that. And they really was \u2014 even the \u2014 most of it went for\nthe army. And in October, I came down around six o\u2019clo \u2014 after six o\u2019clock, and on\nthe end of the village, because I had to go to him, to this guy for some information I\nneeded, and I\u2019m supposed to be there about half an hour and then go back. And they\n\u2014 on the end of the village were soldiers, German soldiers already, identification. So\nI show the identification, and he says, yeah but, this is after six o\u2019clock, I have to te-\nta-take you inside \u2014 it was a school, there is the kommandatura, to make proof that\nyou are \u2014 so \u2014 and I went there, there was a captain, a German captain. And,\nidentification ev-everything, and I \u2014 he said, what I\u2019m doing there? And I said what\nI am doing, I am here and buying fruit with this and this guy, and they are buying\nthis [indecipherable] for the \u2014 for muSt and for [indecipherable] for the\nSlovakian, the German army. You know what he did? And this guy, this Christian\nguy knew me, he saw me once, cause I was there one evening with two other guys,\nwe need some information from him. And he let [indecipherable] this guy, he\ndidn\u2019t know for \u2014 what he is calling for. And he came in this \u2014 yeah, first of all, he\nca \u2014 he asked me, the German captain 1f I understand German. And I said no. And\nhe said how come y-you knew \u2014 he knows that I had German study in the school.\nAnd I said, yes, we had German, but it was many years ago, but usually we didn\u2019t \u2014\nthere were very few conversations, so now I forgot. He gave a German soldier who\nApril 7, 1997\nactually was from the Sudetenland, so he spoke a little Czech. So he was the\ntranslator, so I had always a little \u2014 and I spoke fluently German. So he always \u2014 the\ncaptain ask the soldier to ask me certain question. So I \u2014 I had always a few seconds\nor a minute maybe, time to think about the answer. So, before the questions, he\nquestioned me about for 15 minutes or 20 minutes or so. And he asked me what I\nam doing, so I said this guy \u2014 this guy \u2014 I am buying all on those hills fruit, and we\nmake muSst and all the say \u2014 cider for the army. You know, he glad to call this guy,\nhe came in this room. When he saw me he almost collapsed, because he knew\nactually who I am, he knew that I am with partisans. So he ask the following\nquestion, this guide \u2014 this guy. Tell me, is it true that this guy who stays here, he is\nbuying fruit with you for the army? You can imagine, he says yes. Immediately they\nlet him go, and he let go the notary from the city to check my papers if they are not\nfalse. And the notary, he is to \u2014 still, because this is the \u2014 where the partisans were,\nand I was staying, mostly was 85 or 90 percent not Catholic. They were Evangelics,\nProtestants. The notary came and the \u2014 and the commandant, the captain showed\nhim the paper, are these really papers, are not false? And the notary said no, they\nare correct, they are hundred percent real. And they let him \u2014 they let me go, they\ntold me listen, even it\u2019s only seven o\u2019clock, but I let you go because I told them\nwhere I live, because I cannot let you here during the night. And I said okay. It was\nApril 7, 1997\nabout seven o\u2019clock in the evening, or 7:15. They [indecipherable] soldier, they\n[indecipherable] me to the guard there, and let me go. A second time, it was April\nthe 13\", 1945, I came again the same place, and they \u2014 it was in five o\u2019clock or 4:30\nin the morning. No, I mean, I\u2019m sorry, in the afternoon about five o\u2019clock, I made\nthe \u2014 because I thought that six a \u2014 after six o\u2019clock I cannot be there. So he says, I\nstill \u2014 I have to take you to the kommandatura, but in this time there\u2019s other arm \u2014\nother \u2014 I don\u2019t know, hi-higher than a captain, I don\u2019t know what it was. It was the\narmy who actually were moving back because the front was coming, it was very\nclose. You could hear the shooting and everything. So he took me there and he\nshowed \u2014 and I thought \u2014 I told him that I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m with all \u2014 because I\nlived there and there, outside, and I wanted to visit, I wanted to buy some food still,\nbecause there was no food, because there wasn\u2019t stores, because there were places\nwhat you have no stores, nothing, five six houses, nothing else. So \u2014 and in \u2014 by the\nway, both cases, I was lucky that not the one, not the first one didn\u2019t tell me to pull\nthe pants down. I wa \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know, it was a miracle.",
        "Q: There \u2014 there were other \u2014 you \u2014 you\u2019d heard of people being \u2014 being asked to\ndo that?",
        "A: I heard \u2014 I know \u2014 if heard or not, but I knew that the \u2014 the Germans all knew\nthat we are circumcised. So he told me, you know what, everything is okay, but you\nApril 7, 1997\nknow that six o\u2019clock is curfew. You \u2014 I cannot let you go, six o\u2019clock I'll let you\ngo. So, and I thought myself, yeah, six o\u2019clock, but I heard the ger \u2014 Russian can be\nhere in an hour or in a day. What will happen if I will stay? They will \u2014 I have to\nrun away. They will shoot me, because they wouldn\u2019t take me or let me go, or\nsomething like that. So \u2014 and I have to show you that [indecipherable] I was near a\nschool, near where the kommandantura was, and here was \u2014 oh sorry \u2014 here was\nthe road, and here was the building of the school. [inaudible] And here was a free\nspace, about maybe five feet, about here. And here was the building. And the\nentrance for the building was here. And all the time at night, a mili \u2014 a na \u2014 German\nsoldier, he was \u2014 he was in charge there during the night, he was walking all the\ntime, from here to here, from here to here. And I heard \u2014 yeah, and they put me in a\nbasement, 1t was \u2014 the windows was straight with the ground. And he was \u2014 I was\nwalking, and it was about so far \u2014 no, it can\u2019t be \u2014 like from outside to the \u2014 not\neven to other building, could be ma \u2014 maybe \u2014",

        "A: 50 yards, or ma \u2014 probably 40 yards, 50 or 40 yards from here to here. So I heard\n\u2014 when \u2014 and when he came here, you know what, the German [indecipherable]\nstopped, you know, his \u2014 his boots, turn around, and again. So when I heard \u2014",

        "Q: Bars.",
        "A: \u2014no bars, nothing. I opened the window, and I took my shoes both together, and\nput over my shoulder, and why \u2014 and then I opened \u2014 so I heard when he 1s turning,\nso barefoot, I went \u2014 I jumped here. And here was a fence. It was about so high,\nwith concrete. And then after that was like wires, you know, like \u2014",
        "Q: Barbed wire.",
        "A: Barbed \u2014 not barbed wire, not barbed wire, a fence, you know.",
        "Q: Just a fence.",

        "Q: About five feet.",
        "A: Fi-Five \u2014 yeah, about five feet high. So I run here, I jump the fence, and run over\nthis \u2014 the street here. And after the street, one \u2014 a small like a wood, wood with\ntrees. And after the \u2014 after the road, about maybe 60 or 70 feet from the road was a\nApril 7, 1997\nsmall \u2014 not even a river, but some water was flowing, maybe \u2014 not even \u2014 maybe\nsix or seven feet [tape break] I fell down in the water, and you know, you fall in\nthe water, get the noise. And he must probably be here, because he heard that\nsomething jumped, and it was about maybe 12:30 or one o\u2019clock after midnight. So\nhe immediately started to scream, halt, halt, halt. And so ma \u2014 and there when I was\non there, on \u2014 on the water, so I went like \u2014 like this, and through a small \u2014 it was\nlike a small here, like about so high. So I jumped over it, and run in the wood, and I\nimmediately heard the bark of the dog, and three or four more soldiers screaming\nhalt, halt, halt. And the \u2014 the dog was barking. And I thought they were running this\nway, and when the dog went to my steps, and he came to the water, he lost \u2014",
        "Q: Lost the trail.",
        "A: Th-That \u2014 the \u2014",
        "Q: The scent.",
        "A: The scent, yeah. So this was \u2014 I was lucky, because otherwise they would go\nafter me. So they didn\u2019t know \u2014 because it \u2014 1t was wood, and usually the German\nwas very afraid to go into woods. That\u2019s why the partisans survived, because they\nstayed in wood. So maybe there were three or four, th-they didn\u2019t know what\u2019s next\nto it. So that\u2019s \u2014 I was lucky, it took me about two hours til I went back to the\nwoods because I know the \u2014 the trip. Ti \u2014 I went back to my ba \u2014 to my battalion, or\nApril 7, 1997\nhow to call it. And there in \u2014 there in \u2014 and they were Russians, they were a \u2014 we\nwere in this, a battalion about 140 people. And we were \u2014 even they be \u2014 knew they\ndidn\u2019t trust me, they don\u2019t even to shot me. The Russians, who knew my name,\nbecause they told me that I was suspicion that I am a spy because I was with the\nGerman. I supposed to come back in the evening, so I must be a spy and so on. And\nit took me til they get drunk, and I had to drink with them. And you know, they\nused to burn, to make their own alcohol there \u2014 in there. It was so strong, and it was\nstinking, not smelling, stinking. So and ha \u2014 then in the \u2014 in the \u2014 and I had to drink\nwith them. So they were half drunk, so I was \u2014 took wi \u2014 you know, put like \u2014 like\nbehind my throat you know, but something still went down on my throat, and you \u2014\nfor days and days I couldn\u2019t feel if I eat bread, or if I eat meat, because all my thing\nwas so burned that I didn\u2019t feel appetite, nothing. And then in the \u2014 early in the\nmorning, suddenly \u2014 and more drinking, was drinking, suddenly the guard came\nimmediately, because the Russian are close, so then the Russian \u2014 and the German\nwas running back. So the Russian \u2014 the Russian army circled us and the ru \u2014 and the\nGerman m-m-militar \u2014 the German soldiers, too. So actually, we were s \u2014liberated,\nthe partisans and the German soldiers \u2014",
        "Q: Were surrounded.\nApril 7, 1997",

And I was standing there and looking and looking, and suddenly\nthey stopped. In the one carriage was two solders. And I am looking, looking, and I\nsaw a familiar face. You wouldn\u2019t believe that it\u2019s true what I am saying.

He says, da. I says me too, I say yeah. He jumped up from the\ncarriage, the people were \u2014 they were civilian people and the Russian soldiers. They\nwere looking, we were hugging, crying, like little \u2014 like children.",
        "Q: So who was it?",
        "A: He was a guy from our city. I went together to school with him. His father was a\ntailor, very poor people. And he escaped in 1939 \u2014 1940, because their family were\nvery communists.

And I was hiding over there and they\nwere standing and looking around all over, and looking for me. And you can \u2014 you\ncan feel it, how it wer \u2014 my feeling, I was chittering, you know. And then we\nstayed for example, even in wintertime for many days and nights. And secretly they\nApril 7, 1997\nbrought us early in the night, some food or something like that.

And then he said,\nin the \u2014 when he thought were really bad [indecipherable] then we will go to\nApril 7, 1997\nHungary too. But with \u2014 with this time, what \u2014 we saw what\u2019s happening then in\nHungary, we couldn\u2019t go because it was all the same danger, like in Slovakia. And\nthen we heard that they remove anyhow, all the Jews to a safer place in western\nSlovakia.",
        "Q: Di-Did you hear The-Theresienstadt as well? Has anybody said \u2014",
        "A: Later on, later \u2014 because in this time when we heard from Auschwitz and we\nfrom concentration camp, we heard il \u2014 some far \u2014 someone called us that our\nbrother died in \u2014 in Majdanek. So we heard that are concentration camp, but was in\nlater, in 1944 or something like that. And by the way, this like, is not hear because I\n\u2014I don\u2019t know if you want to put on tape. About four years ago, my wife said \u2014 alee\n\u2014 that we are reading the \u2014 we are receiving a Czech newspaper, it comes from New\nYork, what are news from Czechoslovakia and so on. And one day we saw a\narticle there that some Jews who are even outside Czechoslovakia and who can\nprove that they were in concentration camp, or in the army with th-the Russians\nalways there, England. They can get some compensation, because the Germans\nsent some money to the Czech re \u2014 Czechoslovakia, and it will be like some\ncompensation because they were in concentration camp. So my wife said, look,\nmaybe \u2014 and she was \u2014 she was very fluent in Czech corresponding as a \u2014 because\nshe was a clerk in Czechoslovakia \u2014 and by the way, we have a Czech typewriter. I\nApril 7, 1997\ndon\u2019t know how it happened, but we bought away from a \u2014 during a friend or so on,\nwe had the Czech writer, because the alphabet in Czech 1s a little different. So she\nsays, you know what? I will try to write application for some people. Maybe they\nwill get. And I do \u2014I thou \u2014 I mentioned to my brother-in-law, and he said to a\nfriend of ours. So we wrote application, and really was happen, and we had t-to\nwrite the first application to the Ministry of Defense. They will prove \u2014 they could\nprove if you have \u2014 that you were like persecuted in a labor camp. And then they\ngive a paper, so-called law number 255. This 1s a law, a Czechoslovak law what\nrecognized that you were persecuted, and you were eligible in certain advantages.\nFor example, like I have the 255, I \u2014 and I get because I worked in Czechoslovakia\nmore than 25 years, I have pension, because I am eligible on normal pension. And\nI\u2019m better, if I get the normal pension, that I will get compensation through the\nGermans. So we wrote them, and I received the 255, and then we made the\napplication for the Czechoslovak Social Security, because they give the money.\nAnd th-that proved tha-that he was persecuted and were receiving the money. And\nin the pens \u2014 you have to have a affidavit from a doctor that he has certain illnesses,\nand he has \u2014 he has invalidity, 10 percent, 50 percent, 100 \u2014 and he gets certain\namount of money. And we have about five people already. And some get 35 dollars\na month, some get 60 dollars a month. And in one occasion he get 110 dollars a\nApril 7, 1997\nmonth, and were received through backwards for half a year, or year, or th-th \u2014\nthousand dollars, or 1200 dollars, besides what \u2014 and they receiving every month,\neven today. So \u2014 and I needed addresses for certain concentration camp, because\nyou have to prove that th-they were in concentration camp. So I went here, to the\nHolocaust Museum, and get out maybe 30 or 26 addresses, even from small\nconcentration camps. And what the people told us, there were this concentration\ncamp, this cencontra \u2014 well, from the [indecipherable] from the concentration\ncamp, they were sent to work in a factory. The factory actually received people to\nwork from the sod \u2014 concentration camp. It was for a hundred people, 150 people.\nSo I went there into the da \u2014 and suddenly, when these people received the money,\nhe said \u2014 the one friend told to the other friend you wouldn\u2019t believe, we are almost\n50 people, what we made applications from \u2014 beside that, two years ago came new\nlaws in Czechoslovakia, so it\u2019s more complicated. You need more proof, more\npapers. So I went to the library in the Holocaust Museum, I took all the addresses,\nbecause we had to write to all those concentration camp. We write in Polish, we\nwrite in English, we write in German. And to the international cross in Arles, and in\nall over. And all the peoples are coming, so there are proof there were some da \u2014\nand Ill have to translate from English to Czech, from German to Czech, from\nPolish to Czech, from Russian to Czech and I am doing all these things, and I have\nApril 7, 1997\n\u2014 I\u2019m translating. I am going to notarize my signature that I translated. So you\ncannot imagine what a work, what we would \u2014 1f you \u2014 1f you would know that it\ntakes so long, we wouldn\u2019t do it. And you know what, we don\u2019t take money from\nthose people, and we are doing this free. Some people when they receive the paper\ngave us, I don\u2019t know, they gave us 20 dollars or so, or nothing, we don\u2019t ask the\nmoney, because they see how much work it has. So what I wanted to say, I went to\nthe con \u2014 to the labor \u2014 to the Holocaust Museum. Suddenly I saw a thick two\nbooks. And I saw people \u2014 can you stop for a moment?

And now we\nApril 7, 1997\nknow exactly what happened to him. At least we know that he didn\u2019t suffer two or\nthree years there.

        "Q: What \u2014 what kind of feeling was that?\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: That the \u2014 the feeling was in this moment that maybe we\u2019 ll see each other the\nlast time. So, what can I say, a feeling is. I said, I\u2014 I remember I thought to myself,\nI would like to know if we would know at least if someone for us \u2014 from our \u2014 both\nof us will survive. What can I \u2014 because I saw \u2014 in this time I saw th-the \u2014 the other\nsituation there.",

        "A: During the war, many times. Like a \u2014 I \u2014 I never thought that I will see someone\nfrom my family again, or if they \u2014 someone will survive, if they will see me.\nBecause actually, especially when I was [indecipherable], people were dying next\nto me. I was only the lucky one that I survived. Or, for 17 days in wintertime, in\nJanuary, we didn\u2019t have food, we didn\u2019t have what to eat. So \u2014 and we were hiding,\nwe were \u2014 we lived on the \u2014 1n the woods, and it was the pa \u2014 the trees, you know,\nunder the trees, was free place around, was snow. So we were sleeping under the\ntrees where the snow was blown out. And we had a ration of so-called bread, but\nactually it was crumb from dark, black bread, because it was old bread, it was in \u2014\nsmelled with \u2014 the whole thing. So we received a cup of the old bread, because you\ncouldn\u2019t slice it, it was crumbs only, it was so old. So that cup of this crumbs, so-\ncalled went for two or three days. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s all, and water \u2014 instead of water\nwe ate snow, for 17 days because we are \u2014 we were circummed \u2014\nApril 7, 1997",

        "A: We could \u2014 we couldn\u2019t move out because the Germans, so this 1s the other part\nof that. So I never was thinking that I will survive if I will \u20141f I will survive for the\nnext hour, you know.",

        "Q: What \u2014 what did you say to her? Did you say anything to each other?",
        "A: Yeah, in this time we were saw that we will come after you, we will see each\nother and [indecipherable] back, will come back. You know, it was hard, we were\ncrying and so it, you know, we leave then \u2014 with some member of the family are\nleaving \u2014 leaving you, it was uncertainty. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to you,\nwhat\u2019s happened to her. It was hard, it was hard every day to be with her. She don a\n\u2014 and you have a household, and you don\u2019t have a mother. So, it wa \u2014 1t was hard\nfor my father too, it\u2019s a \u2014",
        "Q: It must have been very difficult for your father when your mother left. So who \u2014\nwho was left at home, just you and your father?\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: Me, my father and the sister, you know, who \u2014 already who doesn\u2019t want to talk\nabout. And actually, she was in this time about 15 years old, and she was holding,\nor keeping the whole \u2014 whole household, cooking and washing and everything.",
        "Q: So he tried to take care of each of you, he got \u2014 he took care of your mother and\nyour sister \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and he was trying to take care of Heddy as well. He got her a place someplace.\nAfter they left, tell me th \u2014 tell me then what happened next, in 1943. You \u2014 you\nwent into hiding then with your father \u2014",
        "A: Ah, because I was a \u2014 yeah, my \u2014 our \u2014 our father too. But still, my \u2014 we had til\nthe \u2014 in this time certain ti \u2014 certain times, like permission to stay, but actually it\nwas only for my father. It says that for the family, but you can never guarantee\nbecause they were \u2014 first of all, all the time, even later years, in \u00b042 - \u201943, after\nyoung people, because they know \u2014 they needed for work. If someone was working\nthere around vaca \u2014 concentration camp for one year, it don\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t care if\nsurvive or not survives. So \u2014 especially when someone came concentration camp,\nfor example, women with children. Women were better when they came in\nconcentration camp by theirselves. But you know how it was, every mother goes\nwith their children because they immediate \u2014 in Auschwitz they divided the men\nApril 7, 1997\nseparate, and women with children a \u2014 separate women by itself. So they saw a\nwoman with children, they immediately sent to the oven. So, it was \u2014 and then\nwomen realized, even it was heartbreaking, so they let the children, separate the\nchildren, and they survived, because they didn\u2019t go with the children, otherwise\nthey would go to the chimney \u2014 to the oven, too. So the children \u2014 anyhow, very\nfew survived. And my sister [indecipherable] was here. She went from Hungary\nto concentration camp and she was lucky, because she went with some cousins. And\nshe was, in this time she was 14 and a half years old. And so the women were \u2014\nthey were \u2014 the SS came many times to look for children, so they were hiding her in\nconcentration camp. And they were \u2014 they were so malnutritious they don\u2019t \u2014\ndidn\u2019t have any food, so other women brought pieces of bread only to get here to\ngive her, or I don\u2019t know, if they found something, a little milk or something. And\nshe wa \u2014 but she was her \u2014 she was lucky that she was always \u2014 her \u2014 her \u2014 her\nbody, her looks, more older than she was, actually. Even today, she is tall \u2014 taller.\nSo that \u2014 and she went to work, she was working with the other women in\n[indecipherable] manufacture, hard working. And many times other women,\nespecial the cousins, took the hard work instead of her because they worked, for\nexample in [indecipherable] to do certain amount of work, and she couldn\u2019t. So the\nother people were \u2014 even when they know that they\u2019re going \u2014 looking for children\nApril 7, 1997\nor for something. Or even so to look around, they didn\u2019t see her. So they were\nhiding her in concentration, many time. And like I\u2019m saying, they bought certain\nfood for her, that she survived.",
        "Q: Wha \u2014 wa \u2014 while you were in hiding, you \u2014 you \u2014 you didn\u2019t go to any more\nlabor camps, you weren\u2019t caught.",
        "A: No, no, and I never came out \u2014 that was only from four \u2014 1940 to 1942. If I\nwould go in a labor camp, or if someone, for example to Novaky or to some people\nthey took there, and they were working, they were standing there, they were staying\nin no \u2014 Novaky, they were working there for weeks and months. Then \u2014 but they \u2014\nthey sent them anyhow to concentration camp.",
        "Q: But you were separated from your father, and he went to Sered.",
        "A: Yeah, th \u2014 but no, th \u2014 I was separated mainly after they caught him in October\nthen in 1944, then we were separated. Even before I was few days in beginning of \u2014\nin the end of September and the beginning October, I was actually the partisans\nalready.",
        "Q: Tell me how you ma \u2014 hooked up with the partisans. How did you \u2014",
        "A: I went to \u2014 normally I wa \u2014 I made the \u2014 I-I didn\u2019t want \u2014 I want to be a free\ncountry, I want to be help, to fight the Germans. And this time the \u2014 when I came to\nthe first partisan, most of the people were Slovaks. It was about 75 or 80 people,\nApril 7, 1997\nand there were about maybe 10 or re \u2014 12 Russians. And they were Russians who\neither escaped from labor camp, or escaped from the [indecipherable] some out\nfrom the army or so. So \u2014 and then later on, actually these Russians, because mostly\nabout six or seven of them were officers. So then, they made a special battalion and\nother Russians started to come, because actually \u2014 and when the uprising came in\nAugust 1944 to Banska Bystrica, the Russian sent some Russian people to help for\nalph \u2014 uprising. So actually many Russian people then stayed there, even the\nRussian army told them to stay there and help through the uprising. So hundred and\nhundred of Russian people stayed there in Slovakia. So that\u2019s where I get there in \u2014\nsometime November or so, with the Russian. But you know, with the partisans in\nthis time were so \u2014 we were, for example, one battalion. And suddenly we were in\nfighting with the German and they were \u2014 we were overpowered. So suddenly, like\nwe disappeared, 10 people here, three people there, 40 people there. So it took time,\neven weeks sometimes to get put together again. Sometime it happened that, for\nexample [indecipherable] occasion sometimes in December, I was with about 16 or\n18 people. We were wandering about for three weeks, til we find the other bigger \u2014\nlarger group.",
        "Q: How did you find them to begin with? They were in \u2014 they were in the forest, in\nyeah \u2014\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: In the forest, in the woods, they\u2019re all over there. And then they used to come to\nthe small, you know, like [indecipherable] to the houses, what was separate, six,\neight houses. And those people were always helping the partisans, because those\nwere mostly all Protestants, not Catholics.",
        "Q: And these were Slovakian partisans at first?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you joined the partisans. Do you get a gun?",
        "A: Oh yeah, automatic pistol.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you didn\u2019t \u2014 you \u2014 were you \u2014 what \u2014 what was it like the first time you\nwent into some sort of combat with the Germans?",
        "A: Frightening. I remember the first time I had the shooting, I\u2019m telling you, you\ncouldn\u2019t cut my \u2014 couldn\u2019t cut [indecipherable] in my \u2014 my body. It was\nfrightening, but you know, in this time, actually, when you live this kind of life, you\ndon\u2019t later on, believe me, you don\u2019t think about living and dying. You forgot. You\nare \u2014 you're \u2014 you're \u2014\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nApril 7, 1997\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: \u2014 continuation of a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mikulas\nJudikovic. This is tape number three, side A. Did you think about that when you\nwere \u2014",
        "A: You mean whe \u2014 you mean \u2014 oh, here and there I thought it would be nice to\nsurvive, but I said I \u2014 many times I thought to myself, what if \u2014 how it will if I\nsurvive, and nobody from my family? Because in this time I knew very well what\u2019s\ngoing on in concentration camps. So thi \u2014 by the time \u2014 and it was \u2014 I even met in\nJanuary, or in February, two Russian guys who escaped from a concentration camp\nin Poland. Because mary \u2014 many Russian soldiers were in concent \u2014 labor camps\nand in concent \u2014 even concentration camps. They were separate like other \u2014 like, for\nexample, from Jews. And they came, I talked to them about \u2014 maybe for 10 minutes\nor so. It was \u2014 it was winter in 1945, I remember exactly. Then \u2014 because the\nRussian \u2014 the Russian kommandatura, what we had there, they sent them back,\nthey disappeared, I don\u2019t know what happened to them.",
        "Q: Among the partisans \u2014 was there any anti-Semitism among the partisans?",
        "A: Oh yeah, very much so. Especially from the Russians. And I had, for example,\nwhen I was \u2014 the last few weeks what I was with the partisans, especially I think I\nmentioned there in the thing, I was a captain, a Russian, his name was\nApril 7, 1997\nMosalchuk(ph) or something like that. He was \u2014 he must be a white Russian like\nwe used to say [indecipherable] anti-Semitic, and later on, I f\u2014I feel sorry, I mean,\nit was a captain, and I thought always that he must be Jewish, because he was all the\ntime so nice to me. And he \u2014 maybe he was suspicious. He knows me \u2014 he knew me\n[indecipherable] call, you know, I \u2014 short name for Uri. And I was afraid this time\nyou know, because I didn\u2019t trust much the Russians, because I saw what they are\ndoing, even on their own people, even with their partisans. If something was \u2014 say\nthey did something wrong, he didn\u2019t hesitate, he shot him. He didn\u2019t hesitate. He\n[indecipherable] probably drunk or something, or he didn\u2019t do right what he\u2019s\nsupposed to do. He didn\u2019t take a shot \u2014 take \u2014 shot him, and that\u2019s all. And so I\nthought that he was Jewish, and he maybe thought \u2014 and I said to myself, no, after\nthe war, I return. But I lost sight of him about a week before we were liberated, and\nI never saw him again. Never saw him again. He got lost somewhere, it was about a\nweek or 10 days, some time end of March.

        "A: Oh, well, ma-many times he said to \u2014 oh those Jews, you know, yahvrai(ph),\nyahvrai(ph), yahvrai(ph). Even he didn\u2019t mind nothing, yeah, he was drunk, or na\n\u2014 he was hard drunk, he was \u2014 all \u2014 all the Jews, for example, he said, sitting at\nApril 7, 1997\nhome, and we have to fight.

        "A: No, it was [indecipherable]. No, it was occasional. It wasn\u2019t like day to day, not\nat all. But still, you could feel some that \u2014 you know how it is, you are betwee \u2014 the\nsu \u2014 you don\u2019t have to listen to words, you can \u2014 you have to feel it.",

        "A: I was involved in one train attack, but if you put only mines, we go \u2014 went down,\nwe put only mines, and then it was like for timing, you know.

And most of the time\nApril 7, 1997\nwhat we were fighting, we were actually all the time moving. To tell you the truth,\nmost of the time we tried not to be involved in the fight with them, because most of\nthe time they were \u2014 we were \u2014 we overpowered, because they \u2014 we were, for\nexample, 60 people or a hundred people, they were a few hundred. And they had\nheavy armament we didn\u2019t have. We had some machine guns, th-the light machine\nguns. Maybe one time we had, one or two, the heavy machine guns. But we lost, for\nexample, in a fight. We have dead bodies that are \u2014 so, it was hard. Sometimes we\nregret that we have even only rifles.",
        "Q: Were there other Jews in the partisans?",
        "A: No. I had the one time it was sometime \u2014 this 1s another story. Some times in\nNovember, it was a Jewish guy whom I knew from home. He was in a city not far\nfrom Michalovce, Medzilaborce, and his father was a pharmacist. And he was with\nme like a partisan, and we were in a fight sometimes in end November or\nDecember. And he was like so far like from here to the TV. And he got a bullet here\nstraight in the chest. And I don\u2019t know how you call this bullet. This was a bullet\nwhat took apart your body. And he was in \u2014 died next to me, I saw he wa \u2014 and\nusually, when someone died, even it was a German or a Russian or a \u2014 or a Slovak\nor so, usually, especially it was close to a village or so, and they knew already they\nwent, because the people used to go to the forest there and so they saw some dead\nApril 7, 1997\npeople, so they buried them. They buried them there, or they took them to the\ncemetery. Anyhow, so I don\u2019t know here \u2014 where he was buried. Can you imagine?\nLife you know, the \u2014 the li \u2014 the human life is so unpredictable. And in 1946, I met\nhis sister, she survived the Holocaust. She was a year younger than he was. And it\nwas hard for me, and I met her in \u2014 in Prague. And she somehow \u2014 I don\u2019t know if\nshe knew us, we were talking and talking, and then we were talking about the\nbrother. And he was \u2014 she was really suspicious that I knew about him, or she\n[indecipherable] us. And then I told him, you know, Vera, I was with your brother\nduring the war. And she hold my hand and she says, Mitu(ph), tell me what\nhappened to him. I couldn\u2019t talk for a moment. And I told her, you know, I am sad\nto tell you, that in November 1944 he was hurt and he died like a partisan. She\nhugged me. And that was in a restaurant. We were crying. Can you tell me where he\nis buried? And I told her, Vera, I am sorry to tell you that I cannot tell you, because\nI know it was in the forest, it was like out of the forest, it was like a free space, but\nusually the people were \u2014 are buried, those people, I cannot tell you, but I know it\nwas about 10 kilometers from Kleiner(ph), 12 kilometers. But I ge \u2014 well, 1t was\nvery hard. And the next year, in 1947, I think she moved there to Australia. And I\ndon\u2019t know what happened to \u2014 then with her, she \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 she got married there.\nSo tha-that\u2019s was the other story, sad story.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: [indecipherable] you know. Maybe some people, if someone would \u2014 I would\nmeet, or someone would \u2014 someone come along from Medzilaborce, they will\nremember the name for sure. Because there in Medzilaborce, this is a \u2014 a smaller\ncity than Michalovce, but was some Jews, maybe sa \u2014 some hundred Jews for sure.\nVery religious city, 1t was, a very Orthodox. It was opposite like in Michalovce I\nthink there were more Orthodox like [indecipherable] everything for Ashkenazi or\nsomething. You know, this is how to \u2014 you know, can\u2019t remember everything, ever\nwhat\u2019s happened. For example, just few days ago, I don\u2019t know, we were talking\nabout with my sister, and she mo \u2014 she mentioned someone who survived, and we\nwere together in 1947 or \u201948. And I said, you know what? I long time never even\nremember that he survived. And we were talking also someone, so, you know, I\u2019m\nstill wondering, you know, I still think it\u2019s a plus, and I feel til tod \u2014 til today, 52\nyears af-after the war, 55 years or somewhat, and I still remember so \u2014 little things I\nsaw. Things what \u2014 it\u2019s better maybe fo \u2014 I will forget, but I \u2014 it cannot be forgotten\nbecause this what you are doing, this is for generation, generation, we are \u2014 can be\nonly grateful that it will stay somewhere. And some people, in 50 years, a hundred\nyears will take a look and listen to this what happened. Because otherwise, even\ntoday, people don\u2019t believe that something like that happened.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "Q: This may be a good place to stop for now. I\u2019d like to talk to you again, about\nafter the war. But maybe we could stop for now, and then [Il \u2014 I\u2019ll come back and\nwe'll talk some more.",
        "A: This is a other story. If a \u2014 if I\u2014 you know, I \u2014 I mentioned to you how I became\nto \u2014 to this country. What \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to what we go \u2014 went down. You know, that\nthe other border from Slovakia to Hungary only, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "Q: Okay. We \u2014 we\u2019ll \u2014 we'll set up a time and come back soon.",
        "A: Okay, give me a call any time. And see two and a half \u2014 because it\u2019s still a long\ntime and with no question, all this \u2014 this what we went through, not only myself, all\nthose people, it left on your brain even mentally. In normal circumstances, I would\nremember more about the war, or knew about, but it was so many things that\nhappened, that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s important, what\u2019s not important, if you\nremember. Now it came to my mind maybe in a year or so, or so \u2014",
        "Q: D-Do you think about some of these things regularly?",
        "A: Oh many times. And you know, after the \u2014 after the war, it was a nightmare. It\nwasn\u2019t one night that I didn\u2019t dream that I\u2019m again in [indecipherable] in the labor\ncamp, that I am caught by the German. That all \u2014 now I saw my father, he came fr \u2014\nhome from labor camp, I saw. It was night of the night. Even when we came \u2014 when\nwe escape from Czechoslovakia, you cannot imagine how many times I had the\nApril 7, 1997\ndreams, oh they caught me on the border, oh I am again in jail, or something. And\nyou wake up, you are wet, sweating.",
        "Q: Still?",
        "A: Not \u2014 not now, but \u2014 now very seldom, but still it did very \u2014 happen. Just about a\nweek or two weeks ago, you know, when I told to my wife, you know that we were\ntogether again in the Auschwitz museum, because I was there with my wife. And I\nwas so scared that you ho \u2014 you were holding me, I says, not to go farther, not to go\nfarther. And I said, I have to, I have to. And suddenly I woke up. So \u2014 something. I\nwas just thinking a moment ago what I wanted to tell you, oh my gosh. Yeah, for\nexample [indecipherable] yeah, for example, the first time, I forgot to mention,\nwhen they caught me, it was outside the village, around \u2014 about maybe a kilometer\nor so. And suddenly \u2014 they caught me when \u2014 because German army, about 30\nGerman are exercising outside the city. So when they saw \u2014 saw me that the guard\ncaught me to make identification, the \u2014 about 10 or 15 German soldiers are standing\na-around me, and they took me to the kommandatura. And people, the people who\nlived there, Christians, were standing, because it was some buildings already\n[indecipherable] they were standing outside. It was beginning of the \u2014 and they\nsaw I wa \u2014I was in this time in plain, civil clothing. And they saw the German\nsoldiers are hi \u2014 holding a civilian guy and going with him to the kommandatura.\nApril 7, 1997\nSo the Christian people, some women, were standing outside, started to \u2014 the\ncrossing, you know, praying for me. They were \u2014 they knew that they see it, and\nthey knew that partisans are around, and they knew a civil human being, between\nthem \u2014 German soldiers that they knew that I\u2019m certainly a partisan, and that is the\nend of me. So people were standing and th \u2014 the outside, and praying for me, like\nthis.",
        "Q: Did you think you were gonna survive at that point?",
        "A: No, no way. No way. I \u2014 I-I was \u2014 I was only thinking \u2014 I was only thinking,\nbelieve me, I remember like today, I was thinking, it\u2019s question, if they will shoot\nme here, or they will send me to Auschwitz. That\u2019s it, the two questions what I got.\nThis I remember like today.",
        "Q: Are there \u2014 are there certain things that touch off the memories more tha \u2014 more\nthan other things?",
        "A: Well, maybe \u2014 for example, I was in hiding \u2014 actually, I was in hiding two years,\ngive or take, from 1942 til 1944, til we went to Bratislava. All the time you were\nthinking, what will be next? How long? And this, you know, we-went for a wedding\nlast year to Los Angeles, his \u2014 his niece [indecipherable] married in Los Angeles,\nyou know, wa \u2014 Arthur Salzman(ph). And so we met again, we met a few times in\nNew York. But then we didn\u2019t see each other maybe seven or eight years. And we\nApril 7, 1997\nmet again. The first thing we see each other, we\u2019re hugging, because that\u2019s \u2014 and\nthe first thing oh, and you thi \u2014 immediately for relatives who \u2014 for American\npeople, so \u2014 but this guy, this what we survived. This is my body. And I said, not\ntrue, because you are my body, cause we were hiding for more than a year together.\nHe is older than I am, he is in the a \u2014 82, I think.",
        "Q: You went to Banya(ph) Bystrica.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 for the Slovak [indecipherable] for the uprising.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what \u2014 what did you think about when that happened? Or did you \u2014 you\nwent with the partisans?",
        "A: I thought more \u2014 I think \u2014 I-I thought, oh, this is the end, this will be \u2014 pretty\nsoon be the end of the war, because I saw all those people, hundred \u2014 thousands of\npeople, everage \u2014 everybody excited. They was standing on a \u2014 on a truck, and give\neverybody a rifle. Everybody a rifle.",
        "Q: So what was it like in Banya(ph) Bystrica?",
        "A: It was [indecipherable] immediately came the Czechoslovak flags, and came\nCzechoslovak signs. Our freedom is here, and \u2014 against the German, you know,\nsigns, against the Slovak army. But after about six weeks, and went immediately to\nApril 7, 1997\nthe forest, and fighting against the German. But then, end of October, the German\nput thousand of tho \u2014 thousand military with heavy weapons, with tanks and\neverything. That\u2019s when they liquidated the uprising. That\u2019s where everybody who\n\u2014 some people, especial Christian, went home. Some went to the forest, some went\nin \u2014 that\u2019s what it started to make separate partisan battalions.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s when you joined the partisans.",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 and then after Banska [indecipherable] sometimes in\nOctober, November I went again with my father and my sister to Nova Mest(ph).\nThere I stayed for a few days and then I went in October, end of October again to\nthe partisans, because I heard they are not far away in the forest, so I went there.",
        "Q: Wi\u2014I-\u2014I\u2019m sorry, was your father with you in \u2014 in Banya(ph) Bystrica?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. He was in Bratislava.",
        "Q: He was in brat \u2014",
        "A: And from Bratislava, he came to Nova Mesto(ph), that where he stayed.",
        "Q: Until he was taken away.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. All right. Why don\u2019t we stop for today?",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nApril 14, 1997\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nMikulas Judikovic, on April 14\", 1997, at his home in Southfield, Michigan.\nThe interviewer is Sidney Bolkosky. This is tape four, side A. Can we go back\njust for a moment to \u2014 to \u2014 to have you tell me a little bit more about the Slovakian\nnational uprising in Banska Bystri-Bystrica. You were \u2014 you were part of that?",
        "A: Later on. It was the end of sometimes \u2014 a month later, like it started \u2014 started\nabout the \u2014 exactly the 29\" of August, 1944. And in this time I was in Bratislava\nwith my father. And then he left \u2014 w-we had to leave because they had said that\nthe German will occupied \u2014 will occupied Slovakia. So, after a few weeks,\nsometimes end of \u2014 middle of [indecipherable] the 15\" or 20 of Sep-September,\nwe left Bratislava and went to Nova Mesto(ph), where we stayed, I stayed for a\nfew days with my father. And then I went for about two or three days to Banska\nBystrica, and from there they send it, or they told us to go to the forest. Then I\nstarted, about the end of September, I think it was \u2014 yeah, the last week\nSeptember, with a group. But this was only \u2014 only few Russian, some Slovak,\nsome \u2014 even I think about two or three Czechs.",
        "Q: Partisans.",
        "A: Partisans. And then I wa \u2014 actually when I started. And then later on, it was end\nof October. In October the \u2014 the German came in and started to occupy Slovakia,\nApril 14, 1997\nand they took over all the ruins and everything in Slovakia, special in western\nSlovakia, where the \u2014 was the most of the upr-uprising, and \u2014",
        "Q: And was there \u2014 was there fighting in Banska Bystrica?",
        "A: In Banska Bystrica most of the time, specially the fir \u2014 1-in September and in\neven beginning of October, mostly they were organizing, there was the \u2014 the main\nga \u2014 kommandatura the \u2014 the \u2014 from the partisans, the \u2014 how they call them? The\n\u2014all the \u2014 I mean, all the high officers and everythi \u2014 who \u2014 who were organizing\nthe uprising, because the \u2014 from Banska Bystrica, they were organizing the\nuprising, who it was part in eastern Europe, not far Michalovce where I lived, it\nwas in the mountains abou-about 15 or 20 kilometers from north of Michalovee, it\nwas a small group. The most of them they were in the higher Tatra in the mou \u2014\nmountains, and the lower Tatras in the mountains. So the whole organization was\na \u2014 the \u2014 from Banska Bystrica, they made the whole \u2014 like \u2014 they organized\nfrom Banska Bystrica, from all the time. And beside that, in Banska Bystrica\nwas the first actually Czechoslovak \u2014 so-called Czechoslovak government in exile,\nand many high ranking officials came from London, and then the Russian started\nto drop munition and weapons from the air, first from the air and then even many\ntimes they landed in Banska Bystrica, there touch outside from Banska Bystrica,\nor they brought a we-weapon the Russian, or [indecipherable] for the uprising.",
        "Q: But this was \u2014 was this before the Germans were there, or \u2014\nApril 14, 1997",
        "A: Yeah, before the German, before the \u2014",
        "Q: So this is the Slovakian army \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, bu-but it was because as soon as was the uprising August the 29\",\nactually the whole, especially in the middle Slovakia, and western Slovakia, the\nso-called \u2014 the freedom fighters, and the democratic like organization of they\ncalled, like the first Czechoslovak, like a government, took over all the \u2014 the \u2014\nactually they \u2014 they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they took over the power there in Slovakia\n\u2014 most of the Slovakia\u2019s [indecipherable] most of the part of Slovakia. But then\nin October it started the German came in, and it started to occupy Slovakia and\nthey took it over, so all \u2014 actually all the uprising and all the partisans and even the\n\u2014 all the \u2014 the \u2014 the high officers and the government of-officers pull out from\nBanska Bystrica, and everything went to the forests, to the mountains. That was\nsometimes in October, I don\u2019t remember exactly because it was \u2014 it took many,\nmany days.",
        "Q: You told me last time that you \u2014 you and a friend were together, his name was\nHirschkovitz(ph) \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and that \u2014 that he got shot next to you. Do \u2014 do you remember what the\ncircumstances were about that?\nApril 14, 1997",
        "A: Oh yeah, actually I was with him about for four or five weeks, only it was end\nof December and in January, in January, because what we were in a fight, it was\nend of January, and that\u2019s \u2014 I remember the place what I ha \u2014 I \u2014if I would go\nthere, but I don\u2019t reme \u2014 you know, remember the name at wa \u2014 I was in the forest,\nin the so-called kopanice(ph), I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to call this in English, it was a\nplaces when it was forest, then 1t was five, six houses. There was again forest, then\nagain some houses. And then not far away a little, in the mountains there, it was\nabout \u2014 I can say about so \u2014 almost eight or 10 miles from the main road\n[indecipherable] right there in the mountains, in the forest. There where he died,\nit was a\u2014 like a\u2014a clear space out of the woods, and there where he died. And not\nfar away, about maybe four or 500 yards were some \u2014 about four or five houses.\nSo probably those people took care of him and buried him somewhere, but I am \u2014\nI don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know where.",
        "Q: But you were fighting against the Germans at this point?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it was against the German, yeah. Because sometimes \u2014 actually\nfrom end of September when I started with the uprising, til the fourth of, or third\nof \u2014 the fourth of April, 1945, most of the time I was with different groups or \u2014 of\npartisans, because many times we were fighting, and we were, for example 80 or a\nhundred people, and suddenly they \u2014 the German overpowered us, so we dis \u2014\ndisappeared from each other, we dispersed. So, then we had to look for each other\nApril 14, 1997\nand sometimes I didn\u2019t even find some people because they went to other group,\nand I didn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happened, if they survived, or not survived. So that,\nfor example was about maybe four or five times that I had to look for a group, and\nI was, all together about with three or four different groups, because where I found\na group, so I took part with them. I didn\u2019t look for the group what I was before,\nbecause I didn\u2019t know even they exist, because it were \u2014 we were a group, for\nexample, 70 - 80 people. So five or six people went there, 10 went there and some\ndied, so 1t was dispersed, so we catched where we could.",
        "Q: W-Were you there still under false papers? Did \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I wer \u2014 the whole time I was living for tha \u2014 they didn\u2019t know my\noriginal name.",
        "Q: So they didn\u2019t know that you were Jewish?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: So partisans [indecipherable]. Did Hirschkovitz(ph) \u2014",
        "A: Hirschkovitz(ph) knew.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: This is the only guy who knew that I was Jewish, he knew fr \u2014 where I\u2019m from\nand everything.\nApril 14, 1997",
        "Q: Di-Di \u2014 it s \u2014 it seemed \u2014 you mentioned him, so I thought it \u2014 it had made a \u2014\nsome serious impression. Was he close \u2014 near to you when \u2014 when he was shot, 1s\nthat what happened?",
        "A: Oh, it a\u20141t was about maybe 15 or 20 feet from me.",
        "Q: And ne \u2014 and what happened when he was shot?",
        "A: So he \u2014 he stayed there. We had after \u2014 because we were in a fight, so we had\nto move. So I left. When I left he still was there, so if they buried him the same\nday or next day, I don\u2019t know[indecipherable] to because I never came back on\nthis place.",
        "Q: But you s \u2014 you saw him, you s \u2014 you knew he was dead?",
        "A: Yeah, I saw him, I saw him, he get the \u2014 like a \u2014 a bullet what it tur \u2014 tore apart\nhis chest. I don\u2019t know what to call \u2014 how to call this kind of a bullet. It was\nagainst the Geneva Convention to use these kind of bullets, and they used it, the\nGerman used it.",
        "Q: You went back with the partisans, then \u2014 then you left them and went with your\nfather, is that what happened next?",
        "A: I left my father there because I went with the partisan til sometimes end of\nSeptember, so here \u2014 he \u2014 he stayed there in Nova Mesto(ph) in this apartment,\nand we decided that I will see what the \u2014 the situation, and I will check how the\nconnection, that someone will come and pick him up, and I \u2014 I wa \u2014 I even had\nApril 14, 1997\nfamily who was willing for a small [indecipherable] not in the part \u2014 in the forest\nto \u2014 for to keep him, to hide him, because my father had some money with him\ntoo. So \u2014 and we tried, and then we were fine, because we had the other family, his\nname was Farkos(ph), who was a neighbor of ours in Michalovee. And I knew\nthat he is there hiding already in the forest, so our plan was that on \u2014 my father\nwill come there, we\u2019ll stay for a few days there with this family, with a Christian\nfamily. And then he will probably go there with the Farkos(ph) couple, this is the\n\u2014he and his wife. Then \u2014 and they s \u2014 the Farkos(ph) couple even survived, and\nthey went after the war to Israel, and they died then in Israel. And his sons, he\nhad one, two, three sons, they still live in Israel, and I met them \u2014 no, four sons\nactually, because the fifth son, th-the \u2014 he died in concentration camp. So \u2014 and I\nmet them when I was in Israel about eight years ago, 10 years ago the first time.\nAnd then I met them about three or four years ago when I was in Slovakia when\nwe had the reunion with people from the labor camp. And then in Michalovce\nthey dedicated a plaque on a building, it was the official \u2014 the \u2014 not the city hall,\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 what is more than the city \u2014 I-I mean, the around all the \u2014 how\nyou call the office? Actually [indecipherable] there \u2014 there \u2014 there was a \u2014 there\nwere the \u2014 we had in Michalovee the big synagogue, because we have many of\nthem like I mentioned before, and this were the biggest synagogue, and this were\ndestroyed \u2014 actually damaged during the war, and then nobody want to take it\nApril 14, 1997\nover, so they turned it down after the war. And there, on these plates, they build\nthe building on the district \u2014 the office of the district of Michalovece, and there\nthey dedicated a plaque in Slovak and in Hebrew that it \u2014 there on this place was a\nsynagogue for the Jews who were \u2014 who were killed in the concentration camp\nduring the war, and I think even they say the \u2014 no, not \u2014 the numbers, I think th \u2014\nare not there, how many of them. But that\u2019s \u2014 and this \u2014 I have saw here a picture\nfor it. I\u2014 maybe it will be [indecipherable] these pictures here. I have got \u2014 I have\nto check, I will check \u2014",
        "Q: Y-You left your father wi-with \u2014 1n this \u2014 with this family \u2014",
        "A: With a Christian, yeah it was a wind \u2014 a widow.",
        "Q: And you were gonna \u2014 you were gonna come back.",
        "A: N-Na \u2014 no, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t say I come back, I said that I will send someone, a\nChristian, you know, from \u2014 over from the mountains, who will pick him up and\nbring that to the forest, that he go to \u2014 go in hidin \u2014 into hiding.",
        "Q: And what happened?",
        "A: And, it was the exact date when they has \u2014 the guy has to come, and like I \u2014 I\ncame down there, because the guy came to me, and he said, he went there to the\napartment and my father wasn\u2019t there already. And the woman told him that he \u2014\nbecause he\u2019s supposed to come \u2014 to come around six \u2014 6:30 in the morning. And\nhe couldn\u2019t wait, he was afraid because the German were \u2014 were making razzias\nApril 14, 1997\nall over, and were looking for Jews to take to the concentration \u2014 because it was\nactually one of the last \u2014 the last aktions, what the German were looking for Jews\nto take concentration camp. So he was afraid, like the guy told me \u2014 the women\ntold him, that he was afraid that they will came in to pick him up. So he left her\napartment around five o\u2019clock in the morning, that means about one and a half or\ntwo hours earlier than he\u2019s supposed to be there. And wh-when he came, like I\nmentioned already, he came to there \u2014 because it was not far on the outskirt of the\ncity of Nova Mesto(ph), and all \u2014 exactly out of the outskirt was a military\nbarracks, and he went this way out of that city, because he knew actually where\nhe\u2019s supposed to go, where he\u2019s supposed to \u2014 the guy is supposed to take him. So\nthere they confronted him, they wanted identification, even he had Christian\npapers. So, you know, they immediately saw on him that he was [indecipherable]\nso they took him inside in the \u2014 on the kommandatura. And there they saw\nactually \u2014 they saw that he is Jewish, and so they took him then to Sered, and\nfrom there they took him to the concentration camp where he [inaudible] yeah, to\nAuschwitz, yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and you heard about this when you get \u2014 when \u2014 from this man.",
        "A: Yeah, but he died, he di \u2014 I hi\u2014I heard from him here in the United States\nwhen I came in 1960 \u2014 in 1971, so \u2014 and my sister told him that it \u2014 talked to him,\nbecause he was from the same city from where we were, he was from Michalovee,\nApril 14, 1997\nand he said that he went with the same transport, and with the \u2014 he came to\nAuschwitz, so he was a \u2014 he was a tall guy, and he was much younger with my \u2014\nthan my father, so they took him to \u2014 Mengele too \u2014 took him to the right side for\nwork, and my father went a few, maybe 10 or 15 people in front of him, Mendele\n\u2014 Mengele took him to the left, to the oven.",
        "Q: When your father didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t come back with this man, what did you think?",
        "A: I-I actually met this man \u2014 I heard about him, but I met him actually here in the\nUnited States. Then when he told me that my father went \u2014",
        "Q: But th-then, did you think that he had been taken away by the Germans?",
        "A: Yeah, because \u2014 yeah, because the \u2014 the guy who came from this woman, they\ntold him \u2014 she told him that probably went to there, because if he didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] and I didn\u2019t find him, not during the war, that means from end of\nOctober or so til after the war, so I knew that he went there.",
        "Q: What were you thinking at \u2014 or at all about your rest of your family?",
        "A: So, we were waiting because then, after \u2014 few weeks after the war, I was\nwaiting, I went back to Michalovee, and was looking. So then I saw a \u2014 after few\nweeks, my one sister came back, Haide(ph), some times in June, I think. And then\nI heard someone came from Budapest, that my younger sister is alive. So we were\nwaiting for it, you know, after few days or few weeks, the other sister, who lives\nhere in Detroit, Tullulah(ph), came back, so we met together in Michalovece, but\nApril 14, 1997\nwe didn\u2019t know what to do. And then we had \u2014 if I can continue now after the war,\nwe had the aunt in Vranov, this was about 35 miles from Michalovce, she was a\nfirst cousin of my father. So she heard \u2014 they were looking and someone \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember how \u2014 if she heard about us, or we heard about her. Actually, we went\nthere to Vranov, to her, with her. We stayed there from \u2014 for awhile, and she says\nthat we can stay there, we will look if someone from the family will come back or\nnot. So then I had a friend in Michalovce who was me \u2014 who was we \u2014 with me\ntogether in labor camp. And he told me that he has a uncle in Liberec. This is\nabout 65 miles north of Prague. And he has a wholesale store here they gave him\nback, the Czechoslovak government, because he had this wholesale store before\nthe war, in hardware store and plumbing supply. So \u2014 and this was my profession\nwhat I was working during the war. So he somehow connected with him, and he\ntold me he was looking for someone who is responsible, and who is \u2014 who can\ntrust for \u2014 and who can trust, may \u2014 and I can get the job there. So I went there and\nintroduced myself, and he hired me. So it was in January \u2014 exactly in January\n1946. And between the \u2014 this time what we in \u2014 in Vranov, in Michalovce, we\nwent to Prague end of the year to look for someone if we were \u2014 some on the\nJewish organizations, if they will give some on the Red Cross, if they will give\nsome \u2014 some 1-information about our family members, but we didn\u2019t get anything.\nSo my sister went back to Vranov. They were there for a few months, and I stayed\nApril 14, 1997\nthe Liberec already, I started to work there. And then \u2014 but I [indecipherable]\nand then in \u2014 in Prague, I met some cousins from Slovakia, from Orlich(ph), who\nwere in Prague, stayed in Prague, and one of them was \u2014 one brother of this\ncousins, he was in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, and he came to Prague, was\nsometimes in middle s-summer, sometimes in August or September. So \u2014 and\nbecause he was ma \u2014 a soldier in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, he was\nfighting through the front and everything. So they had advantages that they gave\nthose people who was in the concentration camp, or who was fighting against the\nGerman, like partisans or \u2014 or in the military, that he can get certain stores or\nfactories, what it \u2014 after there was took over from the Germans. So this two\ncousins actually were received, they get a store in Jablonice(ph). This was about\neight miles from Liberec. It was a store what \u2014 with china, you know, with glass,\nchina, so [indecipherable]. So then my sisters came over to Jablonice(ph), sa \u2014\nfirst they stayed with me in Liberec for many, many months, maybe a year or so.\nAnd I \u2014 in ma \u2014 my sister, yeah, she stayed in Liberec the whole time. And then\nmy younger sister started to date, actually it was the brother of my cousin. And\nthey get married in 1948, and my sis \u2014 other sister, she started to date her next\nhusband, a Mr. Joe Dushinski(ph). So she get married, and they stayed in Liberec\ntil end of 1950 or the 1950s, when they escaped from Czechoslovakia and went to\nGermany, from Germany to Canada and from Canada to the United States. My\nApril 14, 1997\nyounger sister Lola, when she got married in 1948, end of 1948, yeah. He went \u2014\nthey went, I think with the Haganah to Germany and to France, to Paris where\nthey stayed there about I think for two years or so, I don\u2019t remember exactly. And\nthen they made corresponding because we had many relatives, first cousin, aunts\nand uncles here in the United States. So actually, they helped them, that after two\nyears or so they gave them a \u2014 th-they received a visa to Canada. They stayed\nthere for a few months or so, and then they received a visa, they came here to the\nUnited States. Between this time, my other sister Haide(ph), with her husband,\nthey escaped [indecipherable] money, I gave some money because he have to like\nbribe and give money for someone who knew the way to go to the border, to\ngerman \u2014 to east Germany. And they went to Berlin, and from ber \u2014 from east\nBerlin to have \u2014 to have tams \u2014 again for money, they went to west Berlin, and\nwaiting for the papers the same way they received from our relatives the paper, the\nvisa, because they were first cousin and uncles. They went to Canada, they came\nto Windsor, ma \u2014 first to Halifax, I think. They stayed there from Halifax to\nWindsor, and then after I don\u2019t know, for I think it was in 1952 or \u00b051 or\nsomething like that, they came to the United States, to Detroit, because here in\nDetroit, we have the \u2014 a cousin here, who was born here in the United States.",
        "Q: Now, wha \u2014 when you were living \u2014 living in Liberec with your sisters, did\nyou talk about what went on during the war?\n100April 14, 1997",
        "A: About what?",
        "Q: About wha \u2014 what happened during the war.",
        "A: With who? With \u2014",
        "Q: With your sisters.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: Then \u2014 then I actually, because even [indecipherable] and then actually the\nolder sister \u2014 the younger sister told me how she was to concentration camp \u2014\ncamp, how she survived the concentration camp. And the other sister was \u2014 she\nwas in hiding, she was in camp somewhere, all over there. She didn\u2019t want to talk.\nI don\u2019t want \u2014 I don\u2019t know, even today \u2014 actually \u2014 and I \u2014 I probably know\ncertain things what I \u2014 I have suspicions but I cannot tell because I am not certain\nwhat\u2019s happened with her, so \u2014 I don\u2019t know why. She doesn\u2019t trust him. If she\nhave \u2014 after \u2014 years after the war, if I started to talk her, she was shaking and she\nwas \u2014 so, I let her, but \u2014",
        "Q: What was life like there then, after \u2014 right after the war. I mean, what \u2014 for the\nnext five years or so?",
        "A: The \u2014 after the war it was \u2014 everybody was thinking, because it was really a\ndemocratic government. President BeneS, who escaped in 1939 to London, he\ncame back. First came KoSice, 1945, they established a new democratic\nApril 14, 1997\nCzechoslovak government. Then, after a few weeks, they came to Prague with a\nbig celebration, everything, because it\u2019s again the new Czechoslovak government.\nBut what had happened, the Russians, actually Stalin, even during the war, and it\nwas the fault of the American government of Roosevelt, actually, and Truman,\nthat they would trust \u2014 they trusted to Stalin, and even in 1945 they made the\nagreement in Tehran, Stalin with Churchill and Roosevelt, that how far the\nAmerican army, when they will liberate Europe and Germany and other, how far\nthey can go. Because actually Prague, and the mostly part of Czechoslovakia, the\nAmerican army was actually on the outskirts of Prague, and the Russian didn\u2019t let\nthem farther to go, and the Russians were far away, because they said it was\nagreement between Russia and the United States. So the American army had to\npull back, move west approximately to the city of Posen in Czeska(ph)\nBudavitsa(ph) and then they stayed. And the people were waiting til the Russian\ncame into Prague, because Stalin wanted political reasons it was, that\nCzechoslovakia would be influenced later on, ac \u2014 or \u2014 ma \u2014 with the \u2014 the gover\n\u2014 the \u2014 under a communist government. So actually then it was big celebration that\nthe Russian army liberated Prague and liberated Czechoslovakia, because the\ntrue was that the whole Slovakia and Moravia, the Russian army liberated. So it\nwas then, and it went to the history that the Russian army celebrated\nCzechoslovakia. Even the true 1s that the American army cel \u2014 liberated mo \u2014 the\n102April 14, 1997\nbiggest part of the Bohemia of Czech \u2014 o-of the Czech part of Czechoslovakia,\nbut the Russian didn\u2019t let them go farther.",
        "Q: Did you know this then? Did you know all this then?",
        "A: After many \u2014 after the year, til 1t was in 1946 - \u201947, but not later, because later,\nwhen in av \u2014 February the 25\", in 1948, the communists took over the\ngovernment. So then actually, was it all over that only the Russian army and the\nRussian people liberated Prague and Czechoslovakia. So it started to work the\ncommunist propaganda and it just \u2014 everybody to believe that it was only the\nRussian and Russian and Russian and from \u2014 excuse me, from this time out it was\nall thing \u2014 everything what the American did what \u2014 everything wrong, and\neverything \u2014 they wanted to \u2014 to take away everything from Czechoslovakia,\nfrom the factories and everything, because \u2014 so, it wa \u2014 the \u2014 sta \u2014 the Russians\nstarted \u2014 the Russian and the communist government started to br-brainwash the\npeople in the Czechoslovakia, and most of the people believed them.",
        "Q: Did you believe them?",
        "A: Well, sometimes no \u2014 s-sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes I suspicious,\nbut especial later on, when we had the opportunity to listen in hiding to the Voice\nof America, the \u2014 on radio, suddenly it \u2014 then it opened our eyes. Then \u2014 then we\nknew what really the true 1s.\n103April 14, 1997",
        "Q: Well \u2014 well, life under the communists then, wa \u2014 was it \u2014 was it awful, was it",
        "A: Actually, it was no much different like under the German, only this was \u2014 the\ndifference was, they didn\u2019t went straight on not \u2014 the \u2014 after the Jews, but they\nwent \u2014 if they heard something, everybody was afraid to openly to say tha \u2014 his\nopinion. Everybody what \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Mikulas Judikovic. This is tape four, side B.",
        "A: It was so far that even a\u2014 a neighbor who didn\u2019t like a neighbor, or a \u2014 so he\nstarted to \u2014 to have against him personally, and he went to the secret police or to\nthe police and said, look, this \u2014 my neighbor, he said the \u2014 the Russian were\nstealing our liberation and he praised the American, 1t was enough. Immediately\ncame the secret police, took him away. And many people even disappeared,\nexactly never heard about them. And so the people were afraid. One neighbor was\nafraid the other neighbor. The people started not to trust even their closest friends,\nbecause this time the secret police started to look for informants. So you never\nknew even your next neighbor, or your next guy who was working with you in the\noffice or factory \u2014 actually, the people didn\u2019t trust. And it happened that even\n104April 14, 1997\nchildren went to the police and told to the police that something for own \u2014 own\nparents or something. And it was that they disappeared or they went to jail, and\nvery seldom that they came back. So it was a terror, actually. It \u2014 1t was sometimes\nworst than under the German. And then, even it was so far that Stalin send\nadvisors, his advisors \u2014 it was like secretive, what knew only later on, civilian\nadvisors, not even to the government, but even to \u2014 into factories, and it started the\nend of 1949, that it started a trial against people, against communists who were in\nhigh positions even before the war in Czechoslovakia. And even during the war,\nwho were suffering, who were 1n concentration camps. But Stalin wanted to get\nrid of them because he was afraid that probably they were a little more moderate.\nAnd then it came actually, it so-called the month of 1950, when the \u2014 it was then,\nit was the communist government in Czechoslovakia, that they went after people\nwho di \u2014 they didn\u2019t trust, even if \u2014 if \u2014 if no reason, but they didn\u2019t trust, they\ntook them and they started big trials in Czechoslovakia and they took actually\nwhat was the biggest trial, 14 people who were in high positions, even in th \u2014 after\nthe war, in the communist party, or in the government, in the communist\ngovernment. And they made the trial that they were Trotskys and they were spies\nagainst Russia, against the \u2014 Stalin, against [indecipherable] government in\nCzechoslovakia. And they had the big trial, and they \u2014 beti \u2014 between these 14\npeople were, I think, 12 or 13 Jews. And I think 12 of them, or 13, they\u2019re\n105April 14, 1997\nsentenced to die. They were hanged, or they were shot. All Jews, no ba \u2014 event,\nthey were shot between th-that [indecipherable] so-called the Slanksy(ph) trial.\nHe was a Jew but he was a big, high position in the communist party even before\nthe war already. So they get rid of all the Jews. About two survived, but all the\nJews were liquidated, what was \u2014 they all was \u2014 all were high ranking communist\nofficials.",
        "Q: Did you feel \u2014",
        "A: And then it started \u2014 yeah, I\u2019m sorry, you have the question?",
        "Q: Did you feel that this kind of \u2014",
        "A: Ah, that\u2019s what I want to continue. I felt immediately, because in this time, in\n1949 and 1950 \u2014 1949 already, they took me \u2014 the police came to me and they\ntook me to the police. They were asking me what happened with my younger\nsister, with Lola. So I told them that in 1948, I \u2014 they disappeared, I don\u2019t know\nnothing about them. They didn\u2019t believe me. They kept me there about for a day or\nso. They let me go, but they called me many times. I was about four or five times\nthere on the police, asking questions, a \u2014 who \u2014 ho-how many relatives I have in\nAmerica, where I have relatives, what I am doing, what I \u2014 my corresponding is,\nwith whom I am corresponding and so on. And then in the 1950, my sister\nHaide(ph) what \u2014 she left Czechoslovakia, that was a nightmare for me, because\nthen they took me again to the police, and they hold me for a few days, two t \u2014\n106April 14, 1997\nthree days. Even in that it happened that I get pushed to the wall. Then even a day\n\u2014a slap my fa\u2014I get a slap on my face that I ha-hold my own hand. I don\u2019t know\nif I even told my wife some ta \u2014 this. Then they let me \u2014 this wasn\u2019t so easy\nbecause I wanted to go. They told me that I knew how my sister, both sister left\nCzechoslovakia and til I won\u2019t tell them, they will keep me and they will send me\nto Jachymov. That was a uranium mine, when they put the ra \u2014 uranium from\nmines, and all the uranium was sending to Russia, because they made that \u2014\nprobably the atomic bomb or so. And usually people who went \u2014 that was people\nwho were sent to Jachymov to the uranium mines, that was criminals, that was\npoli \u2014 who were politically \u2014 politically no-not trustworthy, and very few people\ncame back from there. They died. And if after many, many years someone came\nback, his health was completely \u2014 they get \u2014 they have cancer when they came\nback, most of them died, and very few survived more years in there, they let her\ngo after fef\u2014 15 or 20 years, or sometimes it happened where they saw someone\nget very sick and had some connections, so they let him go, but still \u2014 they let him\ngo home, but after many year \u2014 after a few years died because of cancer from the\nuranium, from the exposures to \u2014 to radiation.",
        "Q: When \u2014 when they \u2014 when you were being questioned by the police, did \u2014 did\nthat bring back memories of when you were being held by the Germans?\n107April 14, 1997",
        "A: Very much so. And I can tell you, I have to mention maybe that they let me go\nafter a few days or so, 1f \u2014 it was because my wife, she was working in an office,\nand her president of the office wi \u2014 because it was a \u2014 for the \u2014 the main office for\nall the restaurants there, it was about 1500 people. He had some connection, the \u2014\nher boss had some connection with the police. So my wife probably told him, so\nhe actually, through my \u2014 my wife, through him, heard that the police let me go.\nBut that\u2019s later on, like I mentioned, my wife later on couldn\u2019t keep high position\njobs because they knew that her husband has relatives in America, so they didn\u2019t\ntrust her. So then, later on she was only like a clerk, because before she was in a\nhigher position, like a \u2014 in charge of the personnel department, from all the people.\nThen they \u2014 they \u2014 she couldn\u2019t keep this job, because they didn\u2019t trust her. So\nactually, they put her in a lower position there. But they needed her because, I\nhave to tell, she was a very good clerk, she was very smart and very capable to do\nthings. And her boss was great, because she did many work what she \u2014 he\u2019s\nsupposed to job \u2014 do. So actually, he didn\u2019t have to work so much, and other\npeople who were in charge. So actually, they used her to work more because the-\nthey knew that she has to if she wants to keep even the lower job. So but \u2014 like I\nmentioned before, we knew that after years and many times the police were\nwatching us specially. And like I mentioned before, the last time, we knew exactly\nthe \u2014 why they came to our apartment when we were at work and were checking\n108April 14, 1997\nwell \u2014 if they will find some letters or something, some material what they can use\nspecial against me, that I am in connection somehow with my sisters, or with\nrelatives in America.",
        "Q: You mean they searched \u2014 they searched your house while you were \u2014",
        "A: Re \u2014 re \u2014 they searched our house. Maybe they were mare \u2014 money \u2014 more\ntimes, but twice we knew exactly because w-we, like I mentioned, in our closets\nwe recognized, we knew, because w-we knew \u2014 we heard that they are doing this\nkind of work, the secret police, so we \u2014 exactly on purpose, we put certain things\nin our closets that we could then recognize that something \u2014 someone was there.\nAnd so the \u2014 actually, all those years, we were living with my wife, we couldn\u2019t\ntravel so much like we would like to. And they were watching \u2014 they were\nwatching us, all our steps. Because we were feeling and we saw suspicious people\naround us, along the \u2014 outside our apartment and so, because they were watching\nwho is coming to our apartment. Maybe they are watching where we are going,\nwith whom we are friends, with whom we are in connection. So that was\n[indecipherable] that was the reason \u2014 and in 1968, then \u2014 my sister \u2014 I\u2019m a little\ntoo far a-ahead, but in 1968 is when my sister\u2019s family \u2014 because here in the\nfamily, like I think I mentioned, was a Bar Mitzvah in the family and a wedding in\nthe family, here in Detroit and in Chicago. So, after \u2014 they sent me airline ticket,\nand I \u2014 invitation that I could come to visit. But they \u2014 I knew in advan \u2014 yeah,\n109April 14, 1997\nbetween the older [indecipherable] once a year and twice a year, my sister \u2014 I\nreceived a letter from one sister, from the other sister. But in this time, in\nCzechoslovakia they had the qui \u2014 equipment, because someone told me later on\nafter years, that they could read the letters who wanted \u2014 who \u2014 special letters who\ncame from the western countries. So actually, before I got the letter, and it was a\ncertain stamp, a letter stamp on the envelope, so actually they, under the secret\npolice, maybe in Prague already, or in Liberec, they actually read all the letters\nwhat I received. So they knew what they \u2014 what th-they are writing. And this\ntaught me \u2014 someone later on af \u2014 sometime in the 60s, I think he was in the secret\npolice, I am not sure, but I knew he \u2014 I went to school with him. And he \u2014 one day\nhe was drunk, and I met him, so \u2014 and he started to talk and I was asking him, so I\nfelt between his word what he was talking, that that \u2014 that\u2019s what the police,\nbecause he told me actually, they said, look, we knew everything, what\u2019s going on\neverybody, because we knew in a \u2014 everything what\u2019s going on because we had\nequipment what we [indecipherable]. So, in 1968 when I came here, it took me a\nlot of work, because I couldn\u2019t get the visa to America before I get the\npermission, a paper from the police in Liberec that they let me go for a visit. So \u2014\nand it took again th-the boss of my wife, he talked to someone of the police, so\nthat\u2019s where I could get the permission, and I went with the permission to the\nAmerican embassy in Prague, that\u2019s when I could get the visa. But they never let\n110April 14, 1997\ngo a couple together, special when they didn\u2019t have children, and we didn\u2019t have\nchildren. So actually I knew in advance because when my sisters wrote me that\nthey will invite us, so I told them in advance, they cannot \u2014 we couldn\u2019t get both\nof them. If I will lucky, I will get probably, but they had to pa \u2014 send the invitation\nonly for one person, for me. And that\u2019s what happened. And I knew for exactly\nbecause they told me, you know, in the police when I went with \u2014 with the\ninvitation what I received from my sister, I went to the police, as they told me,\nimmediately. But it\u2019s \u2014 if we will decide, it will go only to you, not \u2014 but not your\nwife. Because they knew we didn\u2019t have children. So \u2014",
        "Q: So was \u2014 was this a lib \u2014 a kind of liberal thaw in the \u2014 wa-wasn\u2019t there a\nperiod when things got better in Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: Only in 1967 - 1968. It was a little bit \u2014 the worst years were in th \u2014 from 1949\ntil 1962 - \u201964. Di\u2014",
        "Q: Was this the dub \u2014",
        "A: Especially the years from 1940 \u2014 19 \u2014 1955 - 1956.",
        "Q: Was this the Dub\u00e9ek years?",
        "A: The Dub\u00e9ek came only nine \u2014 in the spring of 1968. Then we felt a little more\nbreeze about the more liberation [indecipherable] or so \u2014",
        "Q: You think that\u2019s why they let you out?\n111April 14, 1997",
        "A: No, it was on the list because it was in August nine \u2014 no, in July 1968. So, if it\nwould be \u2014 actually, if it would be the \u2014 a year before, or two years before when it\nwas really the strict communist government, not Dub\u00e9ek, I hardly could get\npermission from the police to get out.",
        "Q: When did you meet your wife?",
        "A: I met her in nine \u2014 1n end of 1948.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s her name?",
        "A: Bozena. My wife Bozena, her name was \u2014 maiden name was Shimkowa(ph).",
        "Q: And you met her in 1948, and when were you married?",
        "A: In October 1949.",
        "Q: T-Tell me a little bit about that.",
        "A: So, I dated her about a year, and I really liked her. I\u2014 even I was not so very\nyoung, but I fell in love because first of all I wa \u2014 I\u2014 she was very much interested\nin things like I was interested. For example, we would [indecipherable] talk, we\nwould like one day to travel, because I like to travel, and she had the same. And\nshe like very much art, culture, theaters, operas. And that was \u2014 I always liked and\njust I read some material about that. So we started \u2014 we started to gay \u2014 to go in\ntheaters to o \u2014 special an opera tim \u2014 ba-ballet together. And then we started \u2014 I\nbought a tent and [indecipherable] I think we were \u2014 we were dating already, that\nwe would like to ca \u2014 go camping. So that\u2019s what I started \u2014 we started to do that.\n112April 14, 1997\nAnd I saw that we have common interests. We started to go dancing, so \u2014 and then\nI \u2014 I mean, I saw that she\u2019s a very smart girl, nice. So I knew what kind of position\nhas, because she had the position that really was very capable to do this kind of\nwork. So \u2014 and I was by myself, by \u2014 actually not, my sister was still living there.\nSo that\u2019s when I married her.",
        "Q: It must have been hard to leave her when you went to the United States.",
        "A: Yeah, for visiting? Yeah, I-I was \u2014 when I went to the United States, I was\ncertain that more, more, more, because the Dub\u00e9ek were in charge already that\nmany more they \u2014 the western countries will help Czechoslovakia to get more rid\nof the communist-like government, that it will be some imperialistic government,\nor more democratic government, so that I will come back. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t go to\nUnited States with this that I will stay here, because if it would be a year before, I\nwould do that, because I knew under communist that I-I would be glad to get rid\nof the communist government, but now, if starting in spring of 1968 it goes always\nfarther, farther, more liberalization, more democratic things started to come. So\neverybody thought it will finally get again a democratic Czechoslovak Republic.\nBut in \u2014 with th \u2014 in this time, and [indecipherable] in the United States, 1t was\nfor six weeks what I get the permission. That means the third or the second of\nSeptember I was supposed to go back, and that was even my airline ticket. But in\nthi-this time, end of August, the 21\u201c of August, I think, th \u2014 the communists, the\nApril 14, 1997\nRussian and the army from Hungary, from East Germany, from Romania, from\nPoland, occupied Czechoslovakia, so they closed the borders. So I was in the\nUnited States, my wife was actually over there. So, what I have to do? So \u2014 and\nmy wife was in this time in Yugoslavia, on vacation with her cousin, be a \u2014 with a\n10 years old boy. So, she immediate \u2014 when the Czechoslovakia occupied, so she\nimmediately went from Yugoslavia back to Czechoslovakia because the parents\nof the boy were afraid that \u2014 what\u2019s happened. So they \u2014 she went back to\nCzechoslovakia. I was in the United States, she was over there. And then when\nwhat\u2019s happened, so my relatives all, they told me look, we are going to the\nimmigration office. You will stay here, because what\u2019s happened there. We will\ndo everything possible that your wife will come here too. And then, because I told\nthem, I don\u2019t want to stay here if she is there, I am here. So my brother-in-law\nwent with me here in Detroit to the immigration office, and they told me \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nspeak English, so he was the interpreter. They told me yeah, we can make now\nbecause this situation is, it will be easier that I could stay here, and we will make\neverything possible if she can get out from Czechoslovakia, that she will receive\nimmediately visa. But we cannot guarantee how she will get out from there. So I\nsaid look, I will go back, I will do \u2014 if I will be there \u2014 because it ose \u2014 and they\nsaid don\u2019t worry, they will let her go as soon as we'll go to phone her, we will\nwrite her. She will get the permission, she will get out. And I said look, if the\n114April 14, 1997\nRussians are \u2014 if it would be a government under Dub\u00e9ek, it will be different, but\nthis is a government the Russians are there. And I know what it means to live\nunder communists. So never they would let her go \u2014 maybe after awhile or so.\nAnd I said, I cannot \u2014 I cannot stay here, I cannot let her there because she doesn\u2019t\nknow all those ways how to go sh \u2014 there. She has no experience in this kind of\nthing, and I have to go back. The-They were crying, they were bul \u2014 everything,\nmy relatives. And I went back. And when \u2014 interesting enough, one of my\nnephews \u2014 because I \u2014 one nephew, he had Bar Mitzvah in July here. So I was at\nthe \u2014 the other nephew, his Bar Mitzvah supposed to be in April next year. And he\nwas crying and crying, and said, Uncle Mitu(ph), you are here at the Bar Mitzvah\nfor Stanley, and you won\u2019t be here on my Bar Mitzvah, and I will \u2014 and I told\nhim, Irwin(ph), I promise you, I will do everything possible. When I will be there,\nI will make all the possible things \u2014 if I couldn\u2019t be here on your Bar Mitzvah, I\nwill be here with you on your wedding with your aunt, with my wife. I make this\nyour promise. And so I went back, but I couldn\u2019t go straight to Czechoslovakia,\nso I flew from here to Yugoslavia, because I had to change my airline ticket, and I\nwent to the place where my wife was on vacation, she wasn\u2019t there any more. So I\nwent back by train to Prague, and then I met my wife and saw \u2014 and I told her the\nstory and I said, I will try immediately I told her, I will try everything. We have to\ngo back and we have to go to America. We cannot stay because it will be a terror\n115April 14, 1997\nhere. So, she didn\u2019t want for, she was crying and so on. But then later on th \u2014 I\nwas working on her [indecipherable] and then she saw too what\u2019s going on, how\nit goes, the situation. So and then we made, sometimes in March, we start with a\nlittle more, not so strict like it was the first month. So we went to \u2014 to police, we\nask for a permission to go to Hungary for vacation. Yeah, when I came back,\npeople \u2014 friends what I met on the street, they didn\u2019t even greet me to welcome me\nor something. Everyone only showing knock on the head that I was so st \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t te \u2014 tell me anything, only to show me that I was stupid that I came back. So\nthen we was working in mat \u2014 thr \u2014 thr \u2014 again through ma \u2014 through this \u2014 her\nboss, and we get permission to go to Hungary because we had some friends. And\nthen we had to bribe 1n the bank, because you ca \u2014 to go to Yugoslavia. If you\nwanted to go to Yugoslavia, you had to get a permission from the bank, that the\nbank gave you currency, Yugoslavian currency, that you go to a vacation for\nYugoslavia. So that \u2014 we bribed some clerk in the bank, because it was always a\ncommittee who was deciding if they allowed you, if they give you the money,\nYugoslavian money that you go \u2014 can go to Yugoslavia. So that\u2019s what it\nhappened, I-I get the permission to go to yu \u2014 th-the money to go into Yugoslavia.\nSo I went again to the police, I had the permission to Yugoslavia, actually\n[indecipherable] needed. I get the permission there, because I had the per \u2014 the\nmoney from Yugoslavia. So I get the per-permission from the police that I can go.\n116April 14, 1997\nThey put up a\u2014 a stamp in my passport that I can go Yugoslavia. And then we\nhave to bribe someone on the police to a \u2014 a friend of mine. We gave money to\nhim, he gave some money to a policeman. So he gave permission to us that we can\ngo to Yugoslavia through Austria. And it was for 48 hours. And I had the cousin\nwho still lives in Czechoslovakia, in KoSice, and she told me that if I can get the\npermission to Austria, to Vienna, then I can go to HIAS, to a Hebrew\nimmigration office, and then I can stay and they take care of me to get out from\nEurope, anywhere. So that what we did to, what I\u2019m saying it\u2019s very simple, but it\ntook much of nerves, a lot of weeks, almost all our money what we got. It cost us\nmoney what we bribe. And it was nerve breaking til we get all those papers and\neverything. So only one cousin of my wife, and my cousin in KoSice, they knew\nthat we are preparing to leave. Even she told me my cousin in KoSice, as soon as\nwa \u2014 we were b \u2014 lucky and come to Vienna, that I have to write her, and they\nmay \u2014 they \u2014 they will make immediately steps that they will come after us to\nVienna. But in between this 1s a other story, her husband changed his mind, he\ndidn\u2019t want [indecipherable] this stay there. And he wa \u2014 he felt sorry til today\nfor visiting last few years them, he felt sorry all the time that he didn\u2019t came after\nus. Then when we \u2014 so we \u2014 yeah, and then it happened in May the 30\", 1940 \u2014\n1969, actually we left Czechoslovakia. And where we lived in the apar \u2014 I had a\ncar already. In this time I bought a car, 1t happens \u2014 this is other story, how it was\n117April 14, 1997\ndifficult. It was permission from the company, but we had the car. We had the \u2014\nwe had the application for a new car two years before, because it take always a\ncommittee who decided who will get the car, because it was har \u2014 very had to get\nthe car, a permission to buy a car, if you had the money. And you have \u2014 you had\nto put down 60 percent of the price of the car in a bank. It was blocked in a bank\nthat you had the money. So I had the car about for a year or so. That\u2019s about half\n[indecipherable] almost a new car. And so we were preparing, we \u2014 so I parked\nmy car in front of the building, it was on a main street. And the day before \u2014 and\nwe had all the permissions and everything. So a day before, to the evening, we\nstarted to take some stuff, what we will need for the vacation, and put in the car.\nBecause I had the garage, so we are leave the car over the ma \u2014 overnight in the\ngarage. And because we wanted to leave early in the morning, as soon as possible.\nSo \u2014 and then we \u2014 and I knew from the time when we came back from \u2014 when I\ncame back from America, special then in the months after new year, February,\nMarch, we were watching, again by the secret police. And then I was \u2014 when we\nwere taking down all the stuff into the car, and then not far away, maybe 60 or 70\nyards, it was a corner, a building, and there was a restaurant. And we saw that\nsome guy in rain clothes \u2014 in plain clothes that\u2019s \u2014 was go \u2014 walking around. And\nsometime he stopped there, reading a paper, went inside in the restaurant, and\nfrom the restaurant was a window straight to our apart \u2014 to the car where \u2014 where I\nApril 14, 1997\nwas parking. It was about 70 yards. And then again he came out, he ge \u2014 went\naround the corner, and again get the newspaper, and then to the restaurant. So we\nknew exactly, because we knew all those kind of things what they are doing\nbecause all the secret \u2014 so we knew immediately that someone 1s watching us. So\nif I describe you, or if you \u2014 I can\u2019t [indecipherable] it wasn\u2019t so smooth. I will\ntry to be really short. And around mor \u2014 in the morning, around 4:30 or five\no\u2019clock, it was May the 30\" or the 31\u2018 \u2014 the 31%, we left Liberec and went on the\nway to Hungary. So we stopped during the night in a little town \u2014 you stop? It\nthen \u2014 then it was Bratislava, it was on the border, actually on Czech and\nMoravia. And then we stopped during the night in a camp, to stay overnight. And\nthen [indecipherable] that we will go [indecipherable] so me, my wife \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nApril 14, 1997\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Mikulas Judikovic, on April 14\", 1997 at his home in Southfield,\nMichigan, and the interviewer is still Sidney Bolkosky. This 1s tape five, side A.",
        "A: So my wife was afraid to tell her mother that we are leaving, and that we are\ntrying not to come back, because she knew, and I knew too, that if she would tell\nher mother that she is not coming back, she would start to cry and to scream, and\nshe didn\u2019t \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t never let her go. So we di \u2014 she didn\u2019t tell her mother.\nWe stayed overnight in this camp. In the morning there was about a two hours\ndrive to Bratislava. There we stayed na \u2014 about a half a day. And then we went\nfrom Bratislava, it was very close, about maybe 10 or 15 kilometers to the border.\nAnd usually, at the border to the Hungary \u2014 to Hungary, it was you came to the\nborder, and the Slovaks took only the papers, you were straight on the road. There\nwas a -\u2014 there was a soldier who took the papers, identification, 1f you had\npermission, he let you go. But when we came to the stor \u2014 soldier, he took our\npapers and everything, showed the name, and suddenly he send us around, up to\nthe main building, where the customs were. So we knew immediately that\nsomething is not kosher. So we went there, and we saw when we were there the\nsoldier took our identification and then we thought that have to go up, we saw a\ncustom guy was standing in \u2014 at the door there. And came out a other custom and\n120April 14, 1997\nhe probably told him, because he showed downstairs, he said probably, those are\nthe people. We come upstairs and he took our papers, and \u2014 both of them, they\nwere standing \u2014 where are you going? And I said that we\u2019re going to Hungary,\nthat we\u2019re going to Yugoslavia, so on. And he said, you know what? Drove \u2014\ndrive your car behind the building. So I knew immediately it\u2019s not goo \u2014 good. So\nI drove the car behind the building. There was a \u2014 the long table, and he said okay,\nbut we would like to see what you have in your car. Take out everything from\nyour car. So we took out everything on the car, or took \u2014 or put on the table. And\nwe had our tent, we had [indecipherable], we had a stove, everything like we go\nfor vacation to \u2014 for camping. And what we had in suitcase, everything out. And\nthen he took out \u2014 and that car had the engine in the back, you know it was \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the trunk was in the front. So, he took the front \u2014 he took out our spare\ntire. They took \u2014 pull up the battery from the trunk. And it took about an hour, all\nthis checking and everything what they did. And people down on the road, other\npeople were traveling and they left. Everybody were looking up because they saw\nfrom \u2014 from the stree \u2014 from the road that we are standing, and customs are\nstanding there, and with all the stuff there. And can you imagine that where the\nglove department is, there was \u2014 I found out that was a little, like space. And it\ncome to my mind what I had at home with my prayer book. So \u2014 and I found out \u2014\nso there I hide some papers, what \u2014 her birth certificate, some other papers.\nApril 14, 1997\n[indecipherable] had a few krones(ph), some money and other documents what\nwe had, what we knew if they will find it, it\u2019s finished. They were let \u2014 they knew\nthat something is wrong, that we taking some money with us [indecipherable]\nbecause they checked our \u2014 our purses, our \u2014 our \u2014 my \u2014 my wife\u2019s purse and\neverything. So if they would find these kind of papers, what we \u2014 why I need\npapers, my documents, what I went to school, or when my wife \u2014 wife does \u2014 so\nthere I was hidden, but it was so narrow, that later on when I had to take it out, I\nscratched my hand, because it was very hard to take out. And they opened the\nglove department, they looked behind, but didn\u2019t realize, because it was something\nlike hidden, so they didn\u2019t see that this is \u2014 this 1s actually a \u2014 a secret space there.\nThis was \u2014 they were lucky. So after about an hour they didn\u2019t find \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nfind the space there. After about an hour or so, and even \u2014 you know I said it\u2019s \u2014 I\n\u2014 I have to \u2014 to mention, my wife used to make iyer(ph) cognac, natur \u2014 because\nshe liked it, so here and there she tried to st \u2014 you know what\u2019s iyer(ph) cognac 1s\nnow? This is a \u2014 a liqueur, this 1s made from eggs \u2014 eggs and liqueur, you know,\nand it\u2019s very \u2014 so sweet, you can hardly get drunk or so. And the oth \u2014 on the way,\nshe usually lit \u2014 taked a \u2014 from the \u2014 from the bottle, a taste, and til we came there\nto the customs, she was a \u2014 a little so in good mood, you know. And suddenly\nwhen it was all over with the checking [indecipherable] everything was outside,\nand suddenly she stepped like this and she said, gentlemen, could you tell me\n122April 14, 1997\nplease, what are you looking for? Maybe I can help you. And I said, be quiet. We\ndon\u2019t be th \u2014 nasty to gen \u2014 because I saw that they \u2014 they were a little so \u2014 not so\n\u2014 so straight, like they were before when the \u2014 they were so strict, they were\ntalking to us like we were some robberies or something, or criminals. And then in\nto the end, after an hour, both of them were so \u2014 a little softer. And I told her\n[indecipherable] quiet, don\u2019t \u2014 and okay, so \u2014 and she says so, can I put back the\n\u2014 yeah, you can. So okay, so [indecipherable] and so she started slowly with here,\nand I said, take everything through it in. If they would let us go, we will be \u2014 as\nsoon as we can be away from it better. Okay, then I help her, we started to threw it\nonly in the car and everything. And then they told us, come \u2014 come with the car in\nthe front of the building, stop there. Because they had all the papers, everything.\nSo, I stopped there and so they let you go, but then he stopped, and I said okay.\nThey gave the papers, and I said, you know when \u2014 and when you went from\nCzechoslovakia, you had to fill out a piece of paper, what you are taking out. And\nthen you had to show on the border when you come back, if you brought it \u2014\neverything back and what you brought back. And I said, but yo \u2014 I have the\npassport and the papers, I don\u2019t have the paper what it says when I come back and\nshow the \u2014 the \u2014 for the customs what I took out and what took back. And he says,\nI gave it to you. And I said, but I don\u2019t have here. Yeah, and th \u2014 and then my wife\nsays, oh, maybe yeah, I think I have here between the papers, I have it. So \u2014 and I\n123April 14, 1997\nsaid, because we have to \u2014 and I told them even, I \u2014 we have to be back because\nmy wife has some examinations, she went to \u2014 to a college school and took\ncourses, she took \u2014 and I said, three days later she had the examinations, so we\nhave to bring back, and I don\u2019t want to have some troubles when I come back. I\ngave it to your wife. Again. Well, she says, maybe I as \u2014 my wife said, maybe I\nhave here. So we went, we came, yeah, and we stayed there on our seaside \u2014 not\nseaside, it was a big lake where we have friends who usually we stayed o \u2014 for\nvacations every year. So we thought we will stay there for a week or 10 days with\nthem. So we stopped there, and we say we are going to Yugoslavia and we will\nstay for a few days. Who said \u2014 and the la \u2014 the \u2014 our friend says oh, that\u2019s good,\ngood, good, we\u2019ll stay \u2014 and then during the night I couldn\u2019t sleep, it was from\nSaturday to Sunday, I remember like today. And I said, you know what \u2014 I told my\nwife, I think so \u2014 I would stay not one more day, because if they made those\nsearch on the border, they immediately sent a cable to Liberec that we went to the\ngi \u2014 border, they let us. And if we will stay in Hungary, this 1s still a communist\ncountry, they can make immediately there\u2019s a stop in Hungary, and they send us\nback. And I said, today is Sunday, they \u2014 the office is in Liberec closed. So better\nif as soon as we'll go away \u2014 okay, my wife didn\u2019t want to, so [indecipherable]\nsays, that\u2019s okay, we go. So I turned to my friend, listen, you know we wanted\nbetter we will stop more days in Yugoslavia, and then we will come back sooner,\n124April 14, 1997\nwe will stay with you when we come back, because it doesn\u2019t say that \u2014 we want\nso \u2014 at least two or three days or so, and I says no, we better because they said it\u2019s\na nice weather there in yugo \u2014 okay, so we went. We came to the border on\nHungary and Yugoslavia. They stopped us, they told us the Hungarian customs,\nwait in the car. So we wait in the car. We wait five minute, 10 minutes, 15 minutes\nlong, nobody came out. So then I said oh, this is not good. And I said because\nmaybe from Bratislava they sent a message to the Hungarian border to stop us\nand to check us. So it took about 20 minutes. Other people were coming down,\nother customs let them go, only to [indecipherable] and us they st \u2014 we were\nsitting in the car from 20 minutes. And then suddenly they came out, they pull up\nthe hood, they pull up the hood for the engine, they pull up the hood from the\ntrunk. And there were \u2014 in front of us was a boss, you know people were standing,\ncame around, people standing around, you know, they were nose \u2014 no \u2014 no \u2014\nmousey \u2014 nosey to see what\u2019s going on. So it took about five, 10 minute here. He\ntook everything back up, something he took out, then put back, you know the\nHungarian customs. Then said \u2014 take the steps. Okay, you can go. We can \u2014 and\nimmediately was the border, it was only a small river, a bridge. We came \u2014\nimmediately was the Yugoslavian customs. Came to Yugoslavian customs, I show\nthem the paper, open the window. Immediately, okay, you taking, what you are\ngoing, for how long, I said oh, he gave the stamp. We left . Well, we came to\n125April 14, 1997\nYugoslavia, so we went to the seaside, about \u2014 and we thought that we will stay\nthere til we will go to Austria, we will stay about for a few days, a little, to relax.",
        "Q: In Dubrovnik?",
        "A: No, it was very close to dubr \u2014 yeah, th-the \u2014 next to the \u2014 between dubr \u2014\nDubrovnik and Split. And then we stayed about for three, four days in a camp,\nand I said to my wife, you know, I am so nervous. Better if here the opportunity\ncome, we will go to Vienna, to Austria. We will see what happen maybe there we\nwill go. And then my wife said okay, because she saw in everything what was\ngoing on, all these borders. And I still \u2014 I said I didn\u2019t even trust \u2014 I didn\u2019t trust the\nSlovaks, I didn\u2019t trust the Hungarian, and you know what? I don\u2019t even trust\nYugoslavian. Ega \u2014 even Yugoslavia, it was in even this time more liberal and\nmany people escape after the Russian came into Yugoslavia from\nCzechoslovakia. So okay, we went, immediately we went to Austria, we came to\nthe Yugoslavian side on the border. They \u2014 after \u2014 w-we stayed about four days\nthere in Yugoslavia. They gave us the stamp only through the window, I didn\u2019t\nhave even to get out. Then we came to the Austrian side, they pull up the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe thing to \u2014 on the border what they have there, you know \u2014",
        "Q: The barrier.",
        "A: The barrier and they \u2014 only there came the Austrian soldier or custom, I don\u2019t\nremember. And he want the passport, he wanted the visa. And \u2014 and you know\n126April 14, 1997\nwhat he wanted? He wanted the international insurance of my car. So that\u2019s \u2014 I sh-\nshow him I had, and then he let us immediately go. I cannot express what I said on\nthe tape, what my expression was. If you can stop for a moment.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And I told to my wife, you heard the big jump, the big noise [indecipherable]\nand I \u2014 she says, no, and says, what happened? How a big stone fell from my\nheart. And I said, now even President Husak can lick my behind. So \u2014 because\nnow we are finally in a free country, and we are free. Can you \u2014 and I started to\ncry, you know, I started to cry. So that \u2014 that was a so \u2014 then, we came to Vienna,\nit was sometime late in the evening, and it \u2014 the next day it was a holiday in \u2014 in\nthe Austria. So we stayed in a camp. The next day we went immediately in the\nmorning to HIAS, and I registered, and then was \u2014 I spoke German. And then was\non HIAS in the office a woman, make a registration, and so on. And I had my\npapers, I took out my birth certificate and so on. And he was still proof if I am\nreally Jewish. And he said \u2014 he asked me the question, so if you are Jewish, where\nis the \u2014 what 1s the highest holiday in our religion? I said, Yom Kippur. And I\nsaid, you know what? When I got up in the morning, you know what was my first\nword \u2014 word? [speaks Hebrew here]. You know what it means, that translation?\nThank you God \u2014 God upstairs hermelek(ph), the king of all the holy works, and\nso on. And I said, do you believe me? I \u2014 I didn\u2019t talk about the pull down the\n127April 14, 1997\npants. Yeah, so \u2014 and the women \u2014 we were laughing. She says, yeah, yeah. And\nshe says, don\u2019t be mad, because we had, after the Russian came in, we had many\npeople, Christian who came here and they said that they are Jews, because they\nknew that the Jewish organizations take more care of them than the Christians in\ntheir o-organizations, you know, the Catholics and all these organizations. Say,\nChristians came and they had \u2014 and the woman told me, we had many occasions\nthat Christians came to us, and we had to send them, give them the address we\nhad, the Catholic organizations. So \u2014 and we stayed there, but now you could see\nin Vienna, people who were escaping from Czechoslovakia. Left cars on the\nstreet, left cars on the airport, because they couldn\u2019t sell. Everybody was glad to\nget rid, because they \u2014 as soon as they get permission go to Canada, to Australia,\nto Sweden, to America immediately. They di \u2014 they left everything there. And I\nhad almost a new car, so \u2014 and I told this guy who asked me about the high\nholidays, you know, I said, do you know what? I have almost a new car, and I\nwould like to get some money, because we don\u2019t have money, we don\u2019t have\ncurrency, nothing. If someone would give me some few shillings, some few\nhundreds, or some dollars or so. He says, you know what? I have a friend, he has a\ndealership, maybe he will buy because he\u2019s a Czechoslovak guy and sells\nCzechoslovak cars, wa \u2014 running, because Czechoslovakia was exporting some\ncars to Austria. So I went there, yeah, we stayed there in \u2014 in the \u2014 yeah, and they\n128April 14, 1997\nga-gave us a address where we can go to stay a few nights til we\u2019re \u2014 that\ntransport, because they started to, in this time were people, many people came\nfrom Hungary, from Czechoslovakia, from Poland, many people. So they made\nalways a transport train \u2014 car, went straight to Rome, because in Rome, the HIAS\nwas the main concentration, the main office. So after a \u2014 the second or third day he\ntold me, you know what? Go show \u2014 there he gave me the address. Show the car,\nhe probably will buy from you. So I went there, he liked the car, so he \u2014 he bought\nthe car. So at least I didn\u2019t have to leave the car. He gave me, I don\u2019t know how\nmany hundred dollars. So at least we had [indecipherable] some money. And I\nleft the car with everything there, so I said, at least something. And then, usually\nafter three or four days they make \u2014 they had the \u2014 had th-the 30 or 40 people,\nsome a\u2014 sometimes even 70 people, so they made two rail cars, and send to\nVienna. And \u2014 yo, and everybody has to go immediately, HIAS sent you to a\ndoctor, he was a Jewish doctor, originally from Poland, but he lived in Austria\nfor many years already, like for a check-up if you are capable, if you are able to go\nto take the [indecipherable] to go, or [indecipherable] to go to Rome. And we\nwent there, and I started to tell him a little bit the story, what I went through, the\nfew days. And I said, you know doctor, I\u2019ve ba \u2014 ba \u2014 ap \u2014 appealed to you. We \u2014\nmy wife is not so healthy and I \u2014 you know, always this nervous break, what was.\nIf you can give her some medication and to check her up more and after three or\n129April 14, 1997\nfour days, if something really was happened, because she has kidney problems \u2014\nproblems, and it was true. And he told he \u2014 he started to talk to my Yiddish. And\nhe says, in Yiddish, you know, tell me the truth, Vienna is a nice city. Probably\nyou want to stay to see the city. And I telled him, you know what, it\u2019s one of the\nreasons too. A-And he said, you know what? I give you, you will stay two weeks\nin Vienna. Stay, but you know, and I thought to my wife \u2014 to myself, better to tell\nthe truth straight and what happens, happen. And he \u2014 then he told me, you know,\nI like you because you told me that you liked to stay in Vienna. So then we \u2014 we\nstayed in Vienna for two weeks, so we looked a little, and at least it helped us,\nspecial me, get a little \u2014 a normal feeling, a normal life, because no \u2014 otherwise, I\nwas on the bottom, really. I was completely eshi \u2014 exhausted \u2014 exhausted. So then\nwe stayed there, and then we, after two weeks they send us to \u2014 to Rome. There\nwe registered in the HIAS, and immediately \u2014 1t was very good organized there,\nand immediately they gave us \u2014 because in Rome there were all over signs that\nsay, lease apartments, special for refugees becal \u2014 twas meant \u2014 so, we took out an\napartment. And the hia \u2014 HIAS, actually Joint, gave the money that what we paid\nfor the rent, and they gave some pocket money that you can buy some food or\nsomething, minimum, but it was enough. And after three months or so, because\nwhen I went in Czechoslovakia gymnasium, I learned Latin, we had the subject\nLatin. So after three months I started to speak Italian. So then was the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n130April 14, 1997\npresident in HIAS was a Romanian woman who spoke \u2014 spoke Hungarian. And\nthen as \u2014 she saw that I spoke Italian, I spoke Hungarian, and I spoke Polish, and I\nspoke Russian, I spoke Czech. So \u2014 and the other woman my \u2014 my \u2014 who was in\ncharge, my caseworker, she was a Romanian too, and she spoke \u2014 spoke\nHungarian too. So said one thing to other, and I talked to them, so they hired me\nthat I was a interpreter in HIAS for all those people, because many people came,\nspecial from Poland, from Hungary, from Romania. So I was working one year\napproximately on HIAS like a interpreter. So, me, my wife actually stayed in\nRome 15 months. And between this time it helped a lot, because we received\nmoney like refugees, like everybody else. And beside that, Joint paid me like a\nemployee on HIAS. So we started to travel a little bit in Italy, and I spoke Italian.\nSo actually in \u2014 was in \u2014 my job was there. At least once a week, sometimes twice\na week, I went to the railroad station in Rome every \u2014 1n the morning, around\neight o\u2019clock in the morning. And always came one railroad car, or two cars, it\ndepends how many people came. And in ad \u2014 in advance, I had all the names who\nis coming, how many people. And I have to tell you, I \u2014 some Italian police were\naccompanying each car from the border to Rome, that nobody can come in in\nthose car. No Italian police to check if regular or not. And when they came to\nRome to me at those stations, they knew me already, all those people. I\n[inaudible] have to tell you, I gave them money, because I had \u2014 I \u2014 I had the\nApril 14, 1997\nenvelope from the Joint, from \u2014 I gave the two guys envelope and I told them \u2014\nthey told me, buongiorno Mikula, buongiorno. A come sta, how you feel and so\non. I said, buongiorno signore, I gave them the envelope, arrivederci. And that\u2019s\nwas I took over all the people I took them to HIAS for registration. There they get\nall \u2014 they received all the instruction farther, and then I was working\n[indecipherable] people to give adva \u2014 adva \u2014 advice, to help them what I have to\ndo. And then I took all the pa \u2014 what someone had introduce on different\nconsulates, you know for the visas or so on. So I went with them to interpret on\nthe \u2014 on the consulate because I spoke Italian there. And then I took all the\npassports, and all papers, translation, everything, to all those consulates for what \u2014\nfor \u2014 for verification, because usually they get permission, the Italian government\ngave permission for refugees for three months. Who stayed longer, I had to go to\nthe police, I had to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get permission. So\nthat\u2019s what I did for HIAS, what I went then \u2014 and then all the transport, what all\nthey sent for example, many people to Canada or to us, or I accompanied these\npeople to the airport. And sometimes people came illegally to \u2014 they send them\nfrom Belgrade or from Bucharest. So I went to the airport, I took over those\npeople and took to the \u2014 not to the e-exit with other people, but to the \u2014 to the\nItalian police, you know, to the commandant of the airport. And he knew\neverything, so he gave the permission, and then when I took them to HIAS, you\n132April 14, 1997\nknow, because those people didn\u2019t have visas. So that\u2019s what I \u2014 I did. I did a lot\nof this kind of things what helped people actually to come to Italy and then to help\nthem to \u2014 to make translation, that \u2014 like a [indecipherable] a translator to them,\neven privately with the \u2014 with the \u2014 when they were looking for apartments, and so\non. So I was busy enough, but during the weekend I could go out, so I can relax a\nlittle bit, so that\u2019s \u2014 we stayed there.",
        "Q: Let me \u2014 let me just take you back for a second to [indecipherable]",
        "A: I\u2014I might even remember all these details and everything, but \u2014",
        "Q: You said that when you \u2014 when you were stopped at the border, and you had\nhidden your papers, you thought of the \u2014 the prayer book that you had hidden\nduring the war. After the war, did you \u2014 did you go back to practicing Judaism?",
        "A: I went, and in the begin \u2014 the first year, you know, this prayer book, the \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know what\u2019s happened, because maybe the \u2014 if something \u2014 because yeah,\nall the furniture, all the clothing, everything what we \u2014 when we left\nCzechoslovakia we had to leave there, and the government took it over. Even they\ngave it to someone or someone \u2014 someone bought it. So an \u2014 for example, it was \u2014\nand they took here and we \u2014 we were \u2014 after awhile when they saw that they \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t came back, they sentenced us, me and my wife to two years in prison in ab\n\u2014 in absentia, because we left illegally. So that means if we would go back during\nthose period, there it was the communist, first we will go in jail, maybe they will\n133April 14, 1997\nfor two years, maybe th \u2014 even more. So when they started to liquidate \u2014 before\nthey started liquidate all our furnitures, and everything, so my wife\u2019s mother went\nto the police. She wanted to get at least the couch what we had. She had to buy it,\nand it took her a lot of work. She get, and she had to pay the police to get the\ncouch what belongs to her daughter. So she has \u2014 I told her \u2014 later she had enough\nguts even to go to the police, first of all. So then the first \u2014 the first \u2014 1946 - \u00b047, I\nused to go to a shul in Liberec. It was a small minyan, few Jews. But then when,\nspecial from 1948, it was very dangerous to show that you are religious, or you are\nkeeping the \u2014 the \u2014 your faith, special Jewish faith. Even Christians, Christians\nwere, under communism, were afraid to go to a church. They didn\u2019t go, even they\nwere religious. So then \u2014 and when I came back, in 1991, after 22 years, to\nCzechoslovakia, and I went to Liberec \u2014 so the first thing Friday evening I went \u2014\nbecause I have a friend of mine, a Jewish guy who lived there, and I ask him, do\nyou still have prayer, do you have some Jews here and so on. He says, hardly we\nmake a minyan on Friday evening. So I said, I-I came there, and I came there\nFriday evening and made the minyan til we were about 10 or 11 people with \u2014\nincluding me. And later \u2014 so then \u2014 oh, and this time was more, the later and later\nyears, in 1933 - \u00b034, it was hardly a minyan. So and some people told me, you\nknow, I remember when I had about, in 1946 \u2014 \u201947 a old guy, so I remember you\nused to come, and so on. And then later on they had very few re \u2014 Jews. And then\n134April 14, 1997\nthey came, for example, for the high holidays, they came Jews from cities or from\nvillages who were about 10 - 20 miles away from Michalovee, so they came for\nthe high holidays [indecipherable] little like one room what they have there.\nFrom somewhere they get a Sefer Torah and a \u2014 all. And \u2014",
        "Q: Was that during the communist regime?",
        "A: Yeah. And then he says, for example, even Friday evening when they don\u2019t\nhave a minyan, so they pray even eight or nine people, and they have sa \u2014 two or\nthree women, so said, we take the women like a minyan. And then 1-in last few\nyears, I was there last time about two years ago, yeah, two years ago, because I\nwent every year there, Friday. And then later years I gave him I \u2014 a sum of money,\nI spent them some \u2014 left them some dollars to help him. And they were very\ngrateful always. And now finally they\u2019re \u2014 after \u2014 after 1990, when it was [break]\nIn 1991, there in Liberec [indecipherable] the whole house, so there was some\napartments. Upstairs they were renting it. Downstairs, they had two rooms with\neverything, with Torahs and everything, with some curtains. And now, after about\ntwo or three years ago, they decided, and there in Liberec, where the German\n1938 on Kristallnacht, they destroyed a beautiful, beautiful, nice, big synagogue,\nthey \u2014 the Czechoslovak government and the Jewish organizations from Prague\ngave some money, and they are starting, I think, last year to build so-called library.\nBut the main part of the library will be a Jewish synagogue with everything like a\n135April 14, 1997\nnormal synagogue. Two years ago I say \u2014 I-I \u2014 they showed me the whole plan,\neven they have in \u2014 on tapes, pictures how the building will \u2014 will look, and it will\nbe a bi \u2014 because now it is there a parking lot. So on the same place where the \u2014 a\nst \u2014 beautiful, in the center of the city, next to the big theater, and t-to city hall,\nactually, behind the corner, there will be built a new \u2014 a li\u2014 a new, big library, but\nthe main part will be a beautiful, nice synagogue. So I am looking forward next \u2014\nno, this year in \u2014 in September, I am going there, so \u2014 to Liberec so \u2014 because I\nwill be in Prague and I will be staying in a spa. We are going there almost every\nyear, there 1s a spa not far from Liberec, about 15 miles. It\u2019s for arthritis and it\nhelps us, so there we are going every year. So I will go there, I will talk to my\nfriend, and I'll look how far, what this \u2014 because last year I couldn\u2019t go there, I \u2014\neven I was in the Czech Republic, but wait, I was there? Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, but\nit wasn\u2019t started yet, so I hope that started. And even he called me last year, and\nthey received a van, because they have like a small community there now, about\n15 people, about eight or nine families who live there. And they received a van, a\nused van from Germany, but they didn\u2019t have papers. So one day he wro-wro \u2014\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 he wrote me a letter that if a \u2014 if I can ge \u2014 get someone papers from\nhere, from General Motors, because it was a General Motors van, because\notherwise the police in Liberec, they couldn\u2019t get Czechoslovak papers for the va-\nvan because it was a present and they don\u2019t have the papers. So I called General\n136April 14, 1997\nMotors here. General Motors send me in Canada \u2014 what 1s the city, where they \u2014\nthey have a department on the foreign cars and the foreign \u2014 no. One moment\n[indecipherable] they had th-the foreign representative, what is for Europe\nrepresentative, so gave me \u2014 they gave me \u2014 they \u2014 in Czechoslovakia they gave\nme his address \u2014 the address of this office, they gave me the phone number, and I\ncalled him up, that it will be done fast. I called him up, I gave him all the\ninformation. That\u2019s what I did, and they received the papers, they received the\nvan.",

So he wa \u2014 he had his\napartment in Prague because many times he was staying there four or five days.\nAnd he had a yearly ticket to Prague by train because he was so often there. And\nusually when he came back from Prague, he usually always brought some presents\nfor the children.

And usually Sunday morning, used to\ncome to our hose \u2014 house, the people from the villages who used to buy for him all\nthose cattles and so on, and he was paying them. So many people remembered him\nvery well. Even here in Detroit for example, Sidnu(ph) Greenburger, who is a\nmember of B\u2019nai Moishe remembers him very well, and when I came to this\ncountry and he taught me here, welcomed me.

So in the one way, he was selling his own merchandise, how to say,\ncattles, what is left, what the commissioners didn\u2019t buy in Prague from him.",
        "A: They were Jews.",
        "A: The \u2014 the commissioner\u2019s mainly was \u2014 his name I remember, his name was\nVitoslav(ph) Krauss, and the other one was Appelus(ph), but I don\u2019t remember.\nAnd it\u2019s very interesting that I escaped from Czechoslovakia act \u2014 in 1968 and \u201969,\nafter the Russian came in, I went from \u2014 I escaped illegally, with two suitcases. I\nleft every [indecipherable] everything there for the government. Then\n[indecipherable] were sentenced in absentia to two years in prison because we left\nillegally \u2014 legally they didn\u2019t let you. So we left like for vacation. It was very hard\nto get, because we went from Czechoslovakia to Hungary, from Hungary to \u2014 to\nYugoslavia. From Yugoslavia to Austria. In Vienna we registered in the HIAS in\nthe Jewish immigration office. There we stayed about for two weeks, and they send\nus to Rome, to Italy, where 1s the main concentration of refugees, especially of\nJewish refugees on the HIAS. And by the way, I was there working in Rome, we\nstayed in Rome 15 months approximately, because I was working on hire \u2014 they\nApril 7, 1997\nhired me, after three months I started to speak Italian, because I had learned it in\ngymnasium when I went, so I learned very easy. So I was working one year in\nHIAS in Rome, like an interpreter. So I stayed 15 months, you know \u2014 and by the\nway, I used to go the first time, after 22 years to go to a shul, to a synagogue,\nbecause in Czechoslovakia, first of all, we to \u2014 under communism it was very\ndangerous to show that you are religious, or you going \u2014 secondly, there was no\nJews, so I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go. So I went to a little shul there in Rome,\nand suddenly I took a prayer book and I found in the prayer book a card what was a\nticket, a steady ticket, a year\u2019s ticket for my father for the streetcars in Prague. Can\nyou imagine? And I had here the card, not long time ago, and I am very sorry, I\ncannot find. I was looking, and I don\u2019t remember if I gave it to the Holocaust\nmuseum here in Detroit, or I put somewhere. And I had the card for many years,\nand I\u2019m sorry, otherwise I would give the card to you, to show that 1t was \u2014 and\nwhen I was in Rome, and they called me the first time to the \u2014 I had \u2014 had the\naliyah, to show \u2014 to called me to the Torah. And I was very fluent, I remember,\nbecause I wa \u2014 go back to how it was in Czechoslovakia and was praying. So I said\nthe first brocha by the aliyah very fluently. And suddenly, when I had to continue,\nsuddenly I stopped and I couldn\u2019t get a word from my mouth. And they thought, the\npeople who are standing next to me, they thought that, what\u2019s happened? What\u2019s\nApril 7, 1997\nhap \u2014 and it took me about two minutes to ga \u2014 get \u2014 continue because I was \u2014 I was\nso excited, and for me was \u2014 is so something that I cannot imagine, I couldn\u2019t\nimagine that after so many years I\u2019m standing in front of the Torah by a-aliyah. So\nthen I told them, so they told me they can understand that. So that what it happened\nto me in Rome. And I wanted only to say that in Czechoslovakia, because it was\nvery dangerous to have some prayers or to go to a shul. So I had the prayer book,\nand my father gave me the idea \u2014 we had the drawer in our dresser. And behind the\nback of the drawer, in the wall, in the back of the dresser was a little space. So I put\nthe prayer book in back of the drawer, and besi \u2014 behind the drawer, I put a\nplywood, so when you opened the drawer, you couldn\u2019t see nothing in the back.\nAnd from the back I made a little hole, a small hole that you can push down the \u2014\nthe plywood with a wire. So it was a small \u2014 and when I opened the drawer and I\npushed the \u2014 with th-the wire the plywood, so the plywood came down and I took\nmy prayer book. So at least on the high holidays, approximate, I knew where they\nare, so I was praying, because otherwise what \u2014 when my sister escaped from\nCzechoslovakia with her husband in 1948, and then my other sister with her\nhusband in 1950, illegally, and I gave some money out, I helped them. So then it\nwas very dangerous because the police came after me. I was in \u2014 even in custody\nfor \u2014 for a few days, and they even slapped me because I didn\u2019t want to tell them h-\nApril 7, 1997\nho \u2014 which way my sister escaped and left Czechoslovakia. So, then I \u2014 so I knew\nthat was genderus \u2014 dangerous to pray, so that\u2019s way \u2014 and I knew that exactly, at\nleast twice during the time in those year, in 1950 - \u201951, maybe \u201952, the secret police\ncame during the day when we were in [indecipherable] my wife at work, they were\nchecking my a \u2014 our apartment for certain things they will find, because \u2014\nespecially my wife, she realized \u2014 she opened, for example there, her underwear\nwas, that it was put a different way back, or our other things what we had in our\ndrawers, or in the \u2014 1n our \u2014 1n our closet. So that\u2019s \u2014 we knew exactly they were\nsecretly \u2014 they came to our apartment to check, and to make \u2014 if they will find\nsomething against me. Maybe they were more times than twice, but twice we knew\nexactly for sure. So when I \u2014 they took me many times, about three times I wa \u2014 I\nthink, to the secret police, and they were even telling me, if I won\u2019t tell how the \u2014\nmy sister went, and what connections I have with my sisters overseas in the west,\nthat they will send me to Jachymov. This was very a dangerous [indecipherable] it\nwas uran-uranium \u2014 uranium m-mine, that they were sending the worst criminals or\npolitically who are dangerous for them. And most of the people even died then in\nthose mines, or if they after many years they were lucky, came back, their whole \u2014\ntheir life \u2014 they were sick with \u2014 from the uran \u2014 from \u2014\nApril 7, 1997",

        "A: In [indecipherable] cheder, that was a different \u2014 a little bit like here, because\nwhen we started in cheder when I was five and a half years old. So there was\ndifferent, there in cheder was first grade, second grade, third grade, and each year\nyou were more advanced. For example, your \u2014 and our teachers, we call them\nrabbis. And really, actually, the rabbis have beards and everything. And it was like\nOrthodox. And in first grade we started to learn the alphabet \u2014 the \u2014 the Aleph-\nAleph-Bet. And then to \u2014 how to \u2014 to daven and how to read. Second gr-grade we\nApril 7, 1997\nstarted to learn a little the sidrah, the Torah. Then in third grade we had went and\nstarted to learn harasha(ph). In fourth grade we started to learn for example\ngemura(ph), and so far [indecipherable] tanakh. And so, then we came to the\nseventh grade, actually we were very highly educated in Jewish studies, starting like\nwith this \u2014 all the \u2014 like I\u2019m saying, the gemura(ph), tanakh with explanation, with\nRussia, and everything. So when I wa \u2014 get Bar Mitzvah, actually I could go almost\nto learn for a rabbi, really, because I was so highly educated.",
        "A: No, but the ga \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, pu \u2014 public school. That\u2019s I \u2014 I think I mentioned in my \u2014 here in that\ninterview.",
        "A: What do you mean, when I started school?",
        "A: Yeah, I went to cheder first, because I started only few months before I started\npublic school, because public school I started when I was six year old.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: In cheder, I get up at five o\u2019clock in the morning every day, summer, winter. I\ntook a small, like a can with warm coffee, and this was my \u2014 actually mine bread \u2014\nmy \u2014 my lunch. And we put \u2014 because in this time in cheder we had all \u2014 not\nalways, but the heat, we put the wood, and I tell you how to cook \u2014",
        "A: Stoves. So on the top it was \u2014 the stove was from metal. So we put on the top of\nthe stove our cans with the coffee. So wh-when we finished, we finished about 7:30,\nso we took breakfast. We ate the breakfast, and immediately we went across the\nstreet to the public school, that started about 8:15. So actually, I had approximately\nhalf hour time between finishing in cheder, and going to public school. There I\nstayed in public school aqu \u2014 approximately til 12 o\u2019clock. So I rushed home,\n12:15, there I have lunch at home. And quarter to two I went back to the cheder, and\nstayed about til five o\u2019clock, sometimes 5:30. And in this goes all the time about for\nseven years. And sometimes in wintertime I went early in the morning in winter,\nand I had to go through snow to that knee high, and I went to cheder. I don\u2019t\nremember that I didn\u2019t want, I don\u2019t remember that it was closed because the\nweather, or something like that. In between this time, specially when I was 10 - 12\nyears old, I was \u2014 liked very much soccer. So between this time, I had to find some\nApril 7, 1997\nfree time to play soccer too, because behind \u2014 we had the big house, two big\ngardens, with fruit, with vegetables, with everything. So a\u2014 and behind the big\ngarden was the soccer field. So actually all my free time I grew up on the soccer\nfield. And especially in later years, after 15 - 16 years old, I played for the club, for\nthere in Michalovece, soccer. So, my life from the age five til about 13 was actually\n12 hours a day, approximately, cheder and school. Even when I went 1n high school,\nwhen I was 11 years old, it was the same.",
        "A: Oh yeah, the public school \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, because I had neighbors was non-Jewish.",
        "A: And soccer, I played soccer with them, but most of my friends were the\nneighbors, because on our street most of the people, it was about, in our street on\nthe bi \u2014 on the beginning of the street were the hospital in Michalovee, and after\nthat there were the private houses. There were about maybe 10 houses or eight\nhouses, and most of them were Jewish.

And not only\nmyself, it was two other boys, who had very difficulties to study with him, because\nhe was the principal there in our class for two years. So at \u2014 I had very difficult as I\nunderstand it even. I had so sharp that he called \u2014 he let \u2014 called my father that I\nwas \u2014 I-I wasn\u2019t behave or something.

But my father said,\nI have no choice, so you know what, better \u2014 and he had the friend who had the very\nApril 7, 1997\ngood store with hardware, and he was willing to take me there.

        "A: So that \u2014 probably that he will try to buy for me a store in [indecipherable]\nbecause I will be familiar, and I will be a partner there, some kind of partnership.\nBut it was later then in 1938 \u2014 I started there actually in 1936, I think. I mean, then\nin 1938 came \u2014 the Czechoslovak Republic was divided, especially in 1938, we\nsaw what\u2019s going on. It was Kristallnacht in Germany, and so on. So we saw that\nit was there \u2014 there gender \u2014 danger. So I was continuing to work in this store til\n1940, when I went in the labor camp.",
        "A: Friday night til the last moment, even when it was the Slovak Republic, and we\n\u2014 the family was still at home together, as normally every Friday evening, normal\ndinner like any Jewish house, with kiddish, with all the \u2014 even Saturdays too,\nSaturday noon, as long as we could afford. I mean, as long as it wasn\u2019t so\ndangerous, especially 1940 and \u201941, when they started to persecute the Jews, when\nthey came in 1939 or 1940, the all \u2014 the laws against the Jews in Slovakia, what\nwas actually a copy of the Nuremberg laws against the Jews, that the Slovak\ngovernment accepted to be the same in 1939 - 1940.",
        "A: Right. This is Zidovsky Kodex, yeah. So then it was very hard, and it was\ndangerous. So we tried our best, I don\u2019t remember exactly for how long, til what\nyear, because that was the situation there.",
        "A: Oh very well. Masa \u2014 Masaryk was a pro \u2014 professor of philosophy. Actually,\nhe was \u2014 the beginning, with his help was established the Czechoslovak Republic\nin 1918, and he died in 1935. After him was the President BeneS. He was not \u2014 he\nwas maybe a politician, but \u2014 but he ra \u2014 I think he wa \u2014 won \u2014 they blame him, and\nI think rightly so, because he actually \u2014 not that he helped, but he was afraid, and he\nApril 7, 1997\nsold actually, the Czechoslovak Republic in 1938 to Chamberlain and to Hitler.\nBecause Chamberlain came to the Czechoslovakia, he made an agreement with\nHitler, he \u2014- Chamberlain was very trustworthy, and he carries a piece of paper that\nHitler guaranteed peace in the \u2014 in Europe, and guaranteed after the Sudetenland,\nCzechoslovakia gave, with the help of BeneS, and actually Chamberlain was\npushing him, gave the Sudetenland to Germany, and Hitler promised that\u2019s it, and\nCzechoslovakia [indecipherable].

And\nhe was very much mistaken, but actually, he brought not the peace to London, he br\n\u2014 brought the concentration camps to London. He was very naive.",
        "A: Oh yeah, this \u2014",
        "A: No, we read, because it came out in the czecho \u2014 in Czechoslovakia, 1n the\nnewspaper, there were \u2014 that was happened in \u2014 in Munich, actually in some\nnewspaper who were \u2014 openly said that Czechoslovakia was sold. Other newspaper\nApril 7, 1997\nwho went with more fascistic papers, they said, we saved Czechoslovakia, but it\nwasn\u2019t true.",
        "A: Very much so. And we tried, because my father still was traveling to Prague, so\nhe tried in 1938, even he went to Prague when it was Slovakia and\n[indecipherable] that Germans were there. He still had the opportunity about twice\nto go to Prague, and he tried very hard to get paper for us, because he had his\nbrothers there and they tried to get out us from Czechoslovakia, but it was almost\nimpossible then already. So, I think I cannot blame him because he \u2014 I know that he\ntried in \u2014 end of 1938, because he saw the situation. He went to the American\nembassy, but it was hard, because it was co \u2014 very complicated to get the papers,\nfirst of all to get out from Czechoslovakia, and to get the visas from the American\nembassy, because there 1s \u2014 was a quota. They were sorting people who they let out\neven before 1938. So he didn\u2019t manage it fe \u2014 he tried very hard, but it was\nimpossible to \u2014 even he had, in 1938 was the World Fair in New York. So ra \u2014 his\nbrothers sent him papers that he will come to the \u2014 to the World Fair, but it was\nbefore Munich. So, between this time came Munich and came the occupation, so it\n\u2014he couldn\u2019t get in for the World Fair.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: Very mu \u2014 immediately after \u2014 they started to make not pogroms, but anti-\nSemitic signs before March 1939 when the \u2014 it actually was hi \u2014 with the help of\nHitler was established the Slovak Republic, and the \u2014 Hitler occupied\n[indecipherable]. So \u2014 and after 1939, the 15 \u2014 starting 15 of March, started\nimmediately against Jews in the newspapers, on the radio, all over. And they were\nstarting immediately again with \u2014 they had black uniforms with high boots, and\nwith the low \u2014 the caps like officers. And they were driving all over, screaming, and\nmanifestations, egging Jews. So we have to hide, we had to \u2014 we were afraid to get\nout. And then later on, in later years, they made when they came in 1940 \u2014 I think\n1940, started that you had to \u2014 the Jews have to wear the \u2014 the yellow star, and then\nit was curfew, and Jews couldn\u2019t get out on the street after six o\u2019clock in the\nevening, til six o\u2019clock in the morning. So and it was \u2014 and later on we couldn\u2019t go\n\u2014 go to amovie. For Jews was not allowed to go, for example, to a movie, or any\npublic places. So they started actually, the end of 1939 - 1940, all the persecution of\nthe Jews. And in 1941, when I was in labor camp, and this time all the Jews have to\nregister, and that way they have specially the young people and the single people.\nSo actually that\u2019s way, they \u2014 my brother had to go to register in 1941, and I didn\u2019t\nApril 7, 1997\nregister because I was in labor camp, so that\u2019s \u2014 I was lucky, when I come home in\nMarch 1942, they didn\u2019t have my name, because I wasn\u2019t registered, but my brother\nwas registered, so immediately in March or in April, they took him to the labor\ncamp \u2014 to the concentration camp.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, because I wasn\u2019t home. I was 1n labor camp.",
        "A: Yeah, no, they didn\u2019t \u2014 because the registration was in 1941.",
        "A: So then they had all the names, so they didn\u2019t go then after the people. Actually,\nmaybe they didn\u2019t know that some people were released in 1942 from \u2014 from labor\ncamp. But then, as they went after the families in 1942, later on, so then I went \u2014\nthen we went to hiding with my father, with my mother. And then \u2014 and this time in\n1943 or \u201944, because there was \u2014 in 19-four \u2014 ni-nine \u2014 1942 - \u201943, they were safe in\nHungary. The you \u2014 Jews were actually much freer, it sa \u2014 wasn\u2019t the \u2014 the Jewish\nKodex, what this was in Slovakia. So my \u2014 my father sent my mother and then my\nyounger sister Lola to Hungary, to Uszura(ph), it was a \u2014 a city about \u2014 about 30\nmiles from Michalovce, because she had there her family.",
        "A: So, they were assured they were actually safe in Hungary. But what\u2019s happened\nlater on, in 1944, in May, they started to take with the \u2014 Horthy came in in\nHungary. So they started to take the Jews from Hungary 19 my \u2014 April, May \u2014 in\nMay 1944. So that\u2019s when my sister and my mother went with her family in\nHungary to the concentration camp.",
        "A: To Auschwitz.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I remember. Tiso actually, like I wrote in this there, he made the\nagreement with Hitler that he will get rid for the je \u2014 from the Jews. Actually, there\nwere \u2014 before, the prime minister in this time before was Tuka, then he died. Then\nhe and Tiso actually made agreement special \u2014 Tiso, he went to Berlin specially to\nmake an agreement with Hitler in 1940, I think it was, that Hitler will help him to\nget rid of the Jews in Slovakia. And he paid slova \u2014 the Slovak Republic paid for\neach Jew who went to concentration camp, they prayed \u2014 they paid to Hitler, I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly how many hundred dollars for each person. And so that\u2019s\nApril 7, 1997\nwhat th-the \u2014 actually it started, the transportation of Jews from Slovakia, and he\nwas very much involved, Tiso, and Mach, the interior minister.",
        "A: Sano Mach. And \u2014 I wanted to say \u2014 and that\u2019s why Hitler was sending to\nBratislava Eichmann, and a German Slovak, the name was Carmasine(ph). They\nactually were organizing the transporting of the Jews from Slovakia. And\nEichmann were \u2014 he stayed very much [indecipherable] for a month in\nBratislava, who was helping Carmasine(ph) to make the transportation go.",
        "A: We were all \u2014 we knew only like we were talking between Jews, he heard this,\nhe heard that, something like that. But we knew that Carmasine(ph) was helping,\nbut for example, from eich \u2014 but how far and how much \u2014 how much, and\nEichmann, | think we actually knew more after the war.",
        "A: Very much, later on, that you knew, because actually the whole propaganda was\nthere that they are taking the young people, like for labor in Germany, in Poland \u2014\nand in Poland. They didn\u2019t mention \u2014 it wasn\u2019t mention about concentration camp.\nWe knew only later on because some news came from Poland that some people th-\nthey don\u2019t \u2014 aren\u2019t alive any more, that immediately they went to \u2014 after few weeks\nApril 7, 1997\nor months, straight to the ovens. And then I don\u2019t remember exactly, then we heard\nthat they \u2014 when they came to Auschwitz, they are dividing people to the right and\nto the left, that people who go to work and people who go to the ovens, to the\nchamb \u2014 to the \u2014 but it was no \u2014 nothing official in the Slovak press, or something\nlike that.

        "A: It was in the paper, this was 1n the paper that the \u2014 the German, because the\nPoland started th-the war, so the \u2014 the German made attack, and they are continuing\nto occupy Poland.",
        "A: Slovakia was involved later on, in \u201939, and the \u2014 there it has even \u2014 had even the\nname, the \u2014 the Slovak army, the Slovak, it was so cold [indecipherable] divizie,\nthe first divis \u2014 division who they sent, certain \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 cannot tell you exactly\nhow many thousand people they sent to help to win the war with Hitler against the\nGerman, against the Russian. Then later on in the Slovak, they \u2014 even the people\nApril 7, 1997\ndid realize, it was like, in the beginning like secret, but then they started to bring\nback injured or dead soldiers, then the Slovak people started to know that the \u2014\nactually the Slovak army is in the war against the Poland and Russian. But in the\npress it was always written like heroes, because they are saving the freedom, they\nare saving the world, because they are fighting against the Bolsheviks, against the\ncommunists and so on.",

But then it started again, actually\nthe main involvement of the Slovak army was in 1941 in June when they started the\nwar, the German against th-the Russian. Because before Stalin make the agreement,\nthe so-called agreement with the German that they won\u2019t fight to each other. But I\ndon\u2019t know how far Stalin or Hitler knew that it\u2019s on-only \u2014 not evidently to \u2014\nactually to gain some time.",
        "A: It started, yeah, it started immediately the rationing. We get some so-called \u2014\nhow do they call? Stamps or something, but it was later on, but 1t was only maybe\nthree or four items, main items. It wasn\u2019t so bad, like for example, in Bohemia, in\nApril 7, 1997\nMoravia, or in Germany. But it started \u2014 but it \u2014 we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t see tha \u2014 that it\nwasn\u2019t enough, but it wasn\u2019t plenty. So we didn\u2019t feel the rationing so much in 1940\n- \u00b04]. Later on maybe on \u2014 when the war started in \u2014 with Russia, then it was\nharder. Then it was more rationing.",
        "A: Yeah, but officially was later on. When it came to Jewish Kodex, I don\u2019t\nremember, it was late \u00b039, or beginning of 1940.",
        "A: Well, we were very frightened, we were very afraid. Some Christians even\nstopped to communicate with us. But later on, for example, when they started to\ntake in families in 1940 \u2014 late \u201942 - \u201943, so we were hiding. We had the neighbor\nwho we had to bribe him so he will be \u2014 well, because it was always said \u2014 always\nwe had some echo, at night they will start to take the families. Or tomorrow. So we\nwent immediately to our neighbor, and they were hiding in a basement there. He\nhad potatoes, and we were hiding over the potatoes and he was covering these\npotatoes or so, with a blanket, and it was very \u2014 because to go down to the\nApril 7, 1997\nbasement, it was like the floor, it was wood. So when you open the door, it was \u2014\nyou couldn\u2019t see that there is a door to the basement. And we knew for example,\nmany times they came to our house to look for us, and they didn\u2019t find us. So many\ntimes then, later on when I came home from labor camp in 1942, they still\ncontinuing to take young people and single people to the labor \u2014 to the\nconcentration camp. So we had the Jewish neighbor, and there was a brother from\nour neighbor, he was single. His name was Alfred Salzman(ph). He lives in New\nYork, he\u2019s still alive. Then he went \u2014 so with him, I used to, especially\nsummertime, because [indecipherable] father was planting field, corn, and wh-\nwheat, and so on. So we run always in the \u2014 the night in the field to ha \u2014 go in\nhiding. And we stayed there in two, three days. We had sa \u2014 for a piece of bread, or\neven sometimes water, some [indecipherable] not water, because we are afra \u2014 we\nwere afraid to come back to our house because they were still taking young people.\nSo \u2014",
        "A: No, they \u2014 this time, 1942, they started to take the families late \u201942, or in \u201943. So\nthat \u2014 then I was hiding with my family, but in this time, when they started to take\nfamilies, my mother and my youngest sister, they were in Hungary already. And\nsecondly, in this time, my father had the opportunity, so we had so-called \u2014 he\nApril 7, 1997\nbought a permission for the government, well you know, it was bribing, so it\u2019s true,\nsome people who had a-access to some in the ministry or so, that had the piece of\npaper that is a letters to stay.",
        "A: Sure \u2014 yeah, something like that. So we had the opportunity always two months,\nor three months to delay, actually. Even other families that taken already to the\nconcentration camp. But still, it was a little like \u2014 a little like a cover, or we felt a\nlittle shi \u2014 more secure there the other \u2014 other, but we didn\u2019t know when it was safe.\nWe got to recognize this permission what you had. So that\u2019s where later on my\nfather sent my mother and younger sister to a safe place, to Hungary. But then it\nwa-wasn\u2019t worth the danger, we couldn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t worth it. We couldn\u2019t afford all\nthe \u2014 they didn\u2019t get the permission already, any permission. So then I was hiding\nwith my father, with my other sister re \u2014 some different places. And then we went in\nninet \u2014 in April 1944, because it was actually a few hundred kilometers, the Russian\nf\u2014 the front was approaching. So all the Jews from eastern Slovakia had to move,\nand to \u2014 from eastern Slovakia to the west. So they sent us, if you had to \u2014 and my\nf-father had someone in Bratislava, in the capital, a family who he used to make\nsome a little business before the war. So we stayed there for a few days, and then\nwe took an apartment in Bratislava for a few weeks.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: No, this was a Jewish family, still a Jewish family. And we took an apartment in\nBratislava, but then it was dangerous, especially in \u2014 after 1t was the partisan\nuprising in August 1944, in Banskebisatran(ph), Slovakia, so we have to leave\nBratislava, and then where we went \u2014 I went with my father and my sister to Nova\nVestu nad Vahom(ph), from there \u2014 then we went actually to concentration camp.\nAnd from Nova Vestu nad Vahom(ph), my sister disappeared, and I went, because\nit started then, the German came, occupied Slovakia, so I went there in the woods,\nand I went to the partisans. So that \u2014",
        "A: Very few.",
        "A: Very few, very few, because most likely was Catholic \u2014 Catholic. And some\npeople who were so-called Evangelical Protestants, they were actually always\nagainst the Slovak Republic because they were not only \u2014 not only because they \u2014\nApril 7, 1997\nthey were persecuting the Jews, but because they were \u2014 they were against the catol\n\u2014 Catholic religion, against the Catholic hierarchy, especially they knew that the\npriest actually, of a fascistic Slovak Republic 1s the president.",
        "A: A ca\u2014 Catholic priest. So that\u2019s where they, if they could, if 1t wasn\u2019t very risky,\nthey had sympathy, most of them. But very few Catholics. And by the way, for\nexample like I mentioned, what my father get a permission order to stay, they didn\u2019t\ntake us immediately to concentration camp. It was a very [indecipherable] one,\nbecause Tiso used to go to a small city in Slovakia, western Slovakia, it\u2019s called\nBanovce nad Bebravou. And there he used to go Sunday morning, so-called, to\npray the \u2014 the \u2014 1n that church to make sermons or how you call it. So, in Catholic\nchurch. And there was a widow pharmacist, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, and they\nsaid that she was his girlfriend. So \u2014 and people had access to this pharmacist, to\nthis woman, and she took the money and through her people get permission there,\nthey can stay longer in Slovakia. So actually it was a secret, but people are talking\nthat his girlfriend actually was helping Jews, because she had access to get so \u2014 and\nhow far it went.\nApril 7, 1997",

        "A: Very sad. Because we knew \u2014 we knew already, it was in 1940, that the Slovak\nRepublic that this anti-Semitism, and they are going against the Jews. So actually,\nnot me, not my family knew what will happen to me. And we had very few\nopportunities then even to write home, to let know. So it was very hard. But in one\nway actually, the labor camp saved my life, because if I would be home like my\nbrother, I would be registered, and I would g-go to concentration camp. Yeah, and I\nwant to mention one other thing what happened to me. In 1943, yeah, in this time\nwas still safe in Hungary, my \u2014 my mother and my sister were all there. And my\nwife \u2014 my father actually, made arrangement that I will go to Hungary too, because\nit was safe. And so he found some \u2014 a Christian guy who, my f-father paid him,\nwho would take me over the border, because the border wasn\u2019t far away. And\nreally, I went with him, he took me over the border, he took me there, we had to go\nthrough a small river, so f \u2014 deep in the water, about maybe 25 or 30 feet wide. So I\nhad to go \u2014I took off my clothes and go so far in water, and I was in Hungary\nalready. So he took me there in a small village to a house, and he told me, you have\nApril 7, 1997\nto wait here, and a other guy will come, and we\u2019ll take you to Uszkurat(ph), where\nmy mother was, it was about maybe 15 miles or so. And so I was waiting, it was\nabout three o\u2019clock in the morning. And suddenly about six o\u2019clock in the morning,\ninstead of the guy who would take me to Hungary came the Hungarian police, and\nthey immediately took me and took me back to the border to Slovakia. And when\nthey ha \u2014 they took me to the Slovakian border, to the Slovakian police, they\nbrought me back to Michalovce and put me in jail, because I wa [indecipherable]\nand they put me in jail. There were other people, about 30 of them, young people,\nJews, who were preparing like they are cou \u2014 almost like a transport to \u2014 or to the\nconcentration camp. And there was in Michalovee, th-this jail was only \u2014 where\nwas the main office, the city hall, there was a basement, and there were keeping\nonly those people. And there was alway like who used to be a guard, like a \u2014 like a\n\u2014 what [inaudible] there, who used to be there, yeah, a civilian person. And\nsuddenly, the day that they brought me, it was a day before a national holiday. It\nwas in July, I think, where there was a national religious holiday, a Christian\nholiday. And they put in the basement immediately my \u2014 there \u2014 some people saw\nme when they brought me to Michalovee, that the police take me \u2014 took me to the \u2014\nthere to the jail. So immediately they tak \u2014 talk my father. So \u2014 and 1n this time,\nsomething happened with my \u2014 I had my shoe when was walking so much, and my\nApril 7, 1997\nheel, I had some damage [indecipherable] my heel, you know, some blood and so\non, and it suddenly get the red. So I-I get some infection. And my father, when he\nheard that I back in jail, he had somebo \u2014 because close to our house was the\nhospital, and he had \u2014 had a doctor who he was very close. So I\u2014 he gave me some\nmoney, and the next morning, because it was a holiday, he came to the jail and told\nthis guy, listen, I heard here you have a \u2014 someone who had some infection. I have\nto check him. So, he gave immediately, because my father gave some money to the\ndoctor, he gave a little money to this guy, he let him in. He get \u2014 take a look at me,\nand he really saw \u2014 I can you show me, even today I have a scar, and he showed \u2014\ntook a [indecipherable] and he showed the guards and said, look, this is red and\nswollen, I have to take him immediately to the hospital to take \u2014 to open it. And you\ncan tell the g \u2014 the \u2014 the Hlinka guard or someone that I took him out and they can\nsee him in the hospital. So he took me to the hospital, immediately he opened it. He\nmade a big \u2014 a big bandage on it. I don\u2019t even remember if he freeze it or not, but\nprobably, because I felt some pain immediately. And he put me in a room, and\nimmediately aft \u2014 in the afternoon, there came two guardists(ph), one\n[indecipherable] police, and what immediately called the doctor, the doctor went\nwith he \u2014 with them to the room, and they told him \u2014 he told them, look, I cannot\nleave him, he has temperature \u2014 and I really had temperature, because it was really\nApril 7, 1997\nan infection [indecipherable]. And I cannot even open the wound. I have here the\npapers of what I wrote down, what I did to him. And you have to wait til take, two\nor three days til he can get out, or I will see what\u2019s happen, because it\u2019s so\ndangerous that he can die even, a so dangerous infection. So it took I don\u2019t know\nhow long because they were arguing with him there in the office. So they let me\ndown. And every five or six hours came a guardist, or a policeman to check if I am\nthere. And can you imagine? I swear to you that it\u2019s true what I am telling you. The\nnext morning, when it was right after the holiday, early in the morning, all the 29\npeople too \u2014 they took away \u2014 that went to concentration camp. And after the war, I\nmet only one of them. He was originally from Lithuania, but he lived in Slovakia\nafter t\u2014 about two years, about three years. And he told me, as far as he knew,\nimmediately in 1942 \u2014 for \u2014 for \u2014 1943, 22 people, they\u2019re shot or died in\nAuschwitz. And he survived, and ya \u2014 as sla \u2014 as far as he knows, he said, I don\u2019t\nknow if someone else survived. So then I stayed in the hospital about 10 days, and\nthen they let me go because the \u2014 the older people left already. So \u2014 but they had\nmy name, so that\u2019s where I went war \u2014 in hiding and so on. And I was suspicious\nbecause they had my name that I tried to go to Hungary. So that\u2019s a other story\nwhat \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I told the whole story.",
        "A: Yeah, and th-this time, it was end of 1943, again, 1t was a Bratislav priest, not\nfar in the village, who for money gave you a Christian birth certificate, and then for\nother money, my father bought Christian papers for me, for him, and for my sister.\nSo actually \u2014 then when we left from Michalovee in 1944, in April, actually I\nalways what I\u2019m \u2014 in Bratislava sometimes they make identifications.

It\nwas in April, in May. And I said, what the hell I need this paper, I throwed it, I\nthrew it there. Oh, I don\u2019t want nothing to have it. And I \u2014I feel very sorry because\ntoday it would be a very documentary [indecipherable] because it would be really\ntrue that \u2014 as to what I am saying, that I lived on these papers. And you know what\nApril 7, 1997\nhappened, I have a other story what \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I \u2014 I told that. When I was\nliberated, just April the 4\"\" \u2014 last week, it was 52 years I was liberated. And I don\u2019t\nknow if I told you the story; I was caught twice by the German in 1944 and 1945, I\ndon\u2019t know if I mentioned that. If you want I can tell 1t to you again, the story. In\n1944 in October, I was \u2014 end of October, or beginning November. I was with a \u2014\none group of partisans. They had \u2014 because this was woods, and there were \u2014 you\nknow, this is a place there in the woods, what you have for example, five, six\nhouses, then you have woods, you have nothing, and then again so few houses.\nThey call it in Slovak Kopanitsa(ph), I don\u2019t know how to translate in English. So,\nand they sent me down, because then in the little [indecipherable] village, it\u2019s\ncalled Kriener(ph), that was the name of the village. And there were two brothers,\nChristians. They were Evangelics, not Ca-Catholics. The one was \u2014 had the bakery,\nhe was collaborating with the partisans, so he baked bread for the partisans, and\nalways send it, or we came down and took from him bread. The other brother had a\nlittle grocery store, and by the way, he was buying, it was in the fall, he was buying\nfruit; apples, plums [indecipherable] pears, and they made \u2014 and it \u2014 that was like a\nsmall factory, what they made from the fruit some muSt, you know, for drinking,\nyou know, what it \u2014 how you calling \u2014\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: Cider, something like that. And they really was \u2014 even the \u2014 most of it went for\nthe army. And in October, I came down around six o\u2019clo \u2014 after six o\u2019clock, and on\nthe end of the village, because I had to go to him, to this guy for some information I\nneeded, and I\u2019m supposed to be there about half an hour and then go back. And they\n\u2014 on the end of the village were soldiers, German soldiers already, identification. So\nI show the identification, and he says, yeah but, this is after six o\u2019clock, I have to te-\nta-take you inside \u2014 it was a school, there is the kommandatura, to make proof that\nyou are \u2014 so \u2014 and I went there, there was a captain, a German captain. And,\nidentification ev-everything, and I \u2014 he said, what I\u2019m doing there? And I said what\nI am doing, I am here and buying fruit with this and this guy, and they are buying\nthis [indecipherable] for the \u2014 for muSt and for [indecipherable] for the\nSlovakian, the German army. You know what he did? And this guy, this Christian\nguy knew me, he saw me once, cause I was there one evening with two other guys,\nwe need some information from him. And he let [indecipherable] this guy, he\ndidn\u2019t know for \u2014 what he is calling for. And he came in this \u2014 yeah, first of all, he\nca \u2014 he asked me, the German captain 1f I understand German. And I said no. And\nhe said how come y-you knew \u2014 he knows that I had German study in the school.\nAnd I said, yes, we had German, but it was many years ago, but usually we didn\u2019t \u2014\nthere were very few conversations, so now I forgot. He gave a German soldier who\nApril 7, 1997\nactually was from the Sudetenland, so he spoke a little Czech. So he was the\ntranslator, so I had always a little \u2014 and I spoke fluently German. So he always \u2014 the\ncaptain ask the soldier to ask me certain question. So I \u2014 I had always a few seconds\nor a minute maybe, time to think about the answer. So, before the questions, he\nquestioned me about for 15 minutes or 20 minutes or so. And he asked me what I\nam doing, so I said this guy \u2014 this guy \u2014 I am buying all on those hills fruit, and we\nmake muSst and all the say \u2014 cider for the army. You know, he glad to call this guy,\nhe came in this room. When he saw me he almost collapsed, because he knew\nactually who I am, he knew that I am with partisans. So he ask the following\nquestion, this guide \u2014 this guy. Tell me, is it true that this guy who stays here, he is\nbuying fruit with you for the army? You can imagine, he says yes. Immediately they\nlet him go, and he let go the notary from the city to check my papers if they are not\nfalse. And the notary, he is to \u2014 still, because this is the \u2014 where the partisans were,\nand I was staying, mostly was 85 or 90 percent not Catholic. They were Evangelics,\nProtestants. The notary came and the \u2014 and the commandant, the captain showed\nhim the paper, are these really papers, are not false? And the notary said no, they\nare correct, they are hundred percent real. And they let him \u2014 they let me go, they\ntold me listen, even it\u2019s only seven o\u2019clock, but I let you go because I told them\nwhere I live, because I cannot let you here during the night. And I said okay. It was\nApril 7, 1997\nabout seven o\u2019clock in the evening, or 7:15. They [indecipherable] soldier, they\n[indecipherable] me to the guard there, and let me go. A second time, it was April\nthe 13\", 1945, I came again the same place, and they \u2014 it was in five o\u2019clock or 4:30\nin the morning. No, I mean, I\u2019m sorry, in the afternoon about five o\u2019clock, I made\nthe \u2014 because I thought that six a \u2014 after six o\u2019clock I cannot be there. So he says, I\nstill \u2014 I have to take you to the kommandatura, but in this time there\u2019s other arm \u2014\nother \u2014 I don\u2019t know, hi-higher than a captain, I don\u2019t know what it was. It was the\narmy who actually were moving back because the front was coming, it was very\nclose. You could hear the shooting and everything. So he took me there and he\nshowed \u2014 and I thought \u2014 I told him that I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m with all \u2014 because I\nlived there and there, outside, and I wanted to visit, I wanted to buy some food still,\nbecause there was no food, because there wasn\u2019t stores, because there were places\nwhat you have no stores, nothing, five six houses, nothing else. So \u2014 and in \u2014 by the\nway, both cases, I was lucky that not the one, not the first one didn\u2019t tell me to pull\nthe pants down. I wa \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know, it was a miracle.",
        "A: I heard \u2014 I know \u2014 if heard or not, but I knew that the \u2014 the Germans all knew\nthat we are circumcised. So he told me, you know what, everything is okay, but you\nApril 7, 1997\nknow that six o\u2019clock is curfew. You \u2014 I cannot let you go, six o\u2019clock I'll let you\ngo. So, and I thought myself, yeah, six o\u2019clock, but I heard the ger \u2014 Russian can be\nhere in an hour or in a day. What will happen if I will stay? They will \u2014 I have to\nrun away. They will shoot me, because they wouldn\u2019t take me or let me go, or\nsomething like that. So \u2014 and I have to show you that [indecipherable] I was near a\nschool, near where the kommandantura was, and here was \u2014 oh sorry \u2014 here was\nthe road, and here was the building of the school. [inaudible] And here was a free\nspace, about maybe five feet, about here. And here was the building. And the\nentrance for the building was here. And all the time at night, a mili \u2014 a na \u2014 German\nsoldier, he was \u2014 he was in charge there during the night, he was walking all the\ntime, from here to here, from here to here. And I heard \u2014 yeah, and they put me in a\nbasement, 1t was \u2014 the windows was straight with the ground. And he was \u2014 I was\nwalking, and it was about so far \u2014 no, it can\u2019t be \u2014 like from outside to the \u2014 not\neven to other building, could be ma \u2014 maybe \u2014",
        "A: 50 yards, or ma \u2014 probably 40 yards, 50 or 40 yards from here to here. So I heard\n\u2014 when \u2014 and when he came here, you know what, the German [indecipherable]\nstopped, you know, his \u2014 his boots, turn around, and again. So when I heard \u2014\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, a guard, yeah. And I heard that he is turning, so I \u2014 I opened the\nwindow, because it was no \u2014",
        "A: \u2014no bars, nothing. I opened the window, and I took my shoes both together, and\nput over my shoulder, and why \u2014 and then I opened \u2014 so I heard when he 1s turning,\nso barefoot, I went \u2014 I jumped here. And here was a fence. It was about so high,\nwith concrete. And then after that was like wires, you know, like \u2014",
        "A: Barbed \u2014 not barbed wire, not barbed wire, a fence, you know.",
        "A: A fence. So the whole fence was about so high.",
        "A: Fi-Five \u2014 yeah, about five feet high. So I run here, I jump the fence, and run over\nthis \u2014 the street here. And after the street, one \u2014 a small like a wood, wood with\ntrees. And after the \u2014 after the road, about maybe 60 or 70 feet from the road was a\nApril 7, 1997\nsmall \u2014 not even a river, but some water was flowing, maybe \u2014 not even \u2014 maybe\nsix or seven feet [tape break] I fell down in the water, and you know, you fall in\nthe water, get the noise. And he must probably be here, because he heard that\nsomething jumped, and it was about maybe 12:30 or one o\u2019clock after midnight. So\nhe immediately started to scream, halt, halt, halt. And so ma \u2014 and there when I was\non there, on \u2014 on the water, so I went like \u2014 like this, and through a small \u2014 it was\nlike a small here, like about so high. So I jumped over it, and run in the wood, and I\nimmediately heard the bark of the dog, and three or four more soldiers screaming\nhalt, halt, halt. And the \u2014 the dog was barking. And I thought they were running this\nway, and when the dog went to my steps, and he came to the water, he lost \u2014",
        "A: Th-That \u2014 the \u2014",
        "A: The scent, yeah. So this was \u2014 I was lucky, because otherwise they would go\nafter me. So they didn\u2019t know \u2014 because it \u2014 1t was wood, and usually the German\nwas very afraid to go into woods. That\u2019s why the partisans survived, because they\nstayed in wood. So maybe there were three or four, th-they didn\u2019t know what\u2019s next\nto it. So that\u2019s \u2014 I was lucky, it took me about two hours til I went back to the\nwoods because I know the \u2014 the trip. Ti \u2014 I went back to my ba \u2014 to my battalion, or\nApril 7, 1997\nhow to call it. And there in \u2014 there in \u2014 and they were Russians, they were a \u2014 we\nwere in this, a battalion about 140 people. And we were \u2014 even they be \u2014 knew they\ndidn\u2019t trust me, they don\u2019t even to shot me. The Russians, who knew my name,\nbecause they told me that I was suspicion that I am a spy because I was with the\nGerman. I supposed to come back in the evening, so I must be a spy and so on. And\nit took me til they get drunk, and I had to drink with them. And you know, they\nused to burn, to make their own alcohol there \u2014 in there. It was so strong, and it was\nstinking, not smelling, stinking. So and ha \u2014 then in the \u2014 in the \u2014 and I had to drink\nwith them. So they were half drunk, so I was \u2014 took wi \u2014 you know, put like \u2014 like\nbehind my throat you know, but something still went down on my throat, and you \u2014\nfor days and days I couldn\u2019t feel if I eat bread, or if I eat meat, because all my thing\nwas so burned that I didn\u2019t feel appetite, nothing. And then in the \u2014 early in the\nmorning, suddenly \u2014 and more drinking, was drinking, suddenly the guard came\nimmediately, because the Russian are close, so then the Russian \u2014 and the German\nwas running back. So the Russian \u2014 the Russian army circled us and the ru \u2014 and the\nGerman m-m-militar \u2014 the German soldiers, too. So actually, we were s \u2014liberated,\nthe partisans and the German soldiers \u2014\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: \u2014 were surrounded by the Russian. And then was \u2014 what\u2019s happened, I went\ndown to the village, and the Russian, the carriages were coming. You know,\nRussian soldiers. And I was standing there and looking and looking, and suddenly\nthey stopped. In the one carriage was two solders. And I am looking, looking, and I\nsaw a familiar face. You wouldn\u2019t believe that it\u2019s true what I am saying. And I say\n\u2014 and the guy starts looking at me, I am looking at him, and I said, in Russian,\nbecause I spoke fluently Russian, was with the Russian seven months. I said, are\nyou Ambil(ph)? He says, da. I says me too, I say yeah. He jumped up from the\ncarriage, the people were \u2014 they were civilian people and the Russian soldiers. They\nwere looking, we were hugging, crying, like little \u2014 like children.",
        "A: He was a guy from our city. I went together to school with him. His father was a\ntailor, very poor people. And he escaped in 1939 \u2014 1940, because their family were\nvery communists. He escaped to Poland, he gets to Russia, he went to the Russian\narmy. He was fighting for three and a half years in the Russian army, and can you\nimagine that he came ri \u2014 this \u2014 no, no, no, it was later what I am talking. No,\nbecause \u2014 oh, I am talk \u2014 he escaped in 1940 \u2014 four \u2014 when we were in labor camp\ntogether. And he fa \u2014 escaped from labor camp. He went to Poland, to Russia, to\nthe Russian army. And then \u2014 meanwhile, we didn\u2019t see each other after that,\nApril 7, 1997\nbecause he went farther with the Russians. In 19 \u2014 what was it, what \u2014 1987 or \u201988,\nwe had a reunion in Israel from the Sixth Battalion labor camp, and he was there,\nand we met after \u2014 after almost 50 years we met in Israel. And he was very sick, he\nhad cancer. And after two days or three days \u2014 he \u2014 he lived in Switzerland. And\nhe had to leave Israel earlier, that was the whole reunion, because he stayed about\nfor a week. And just about four or five years ago, he died. And his name was \u2014 he\nhad the other name, whatever, his really Jewish name was Emil(ph) Furst(ph). And\nhere \u2014 and here \u2014 and he wrote some books. He wrote a book about\n[indecipherable], about our battalion. I have the book somewhere. [inaudible]. So,\nit\u2019s a other story what I didn\u2019t tell there.",

        "A: Ino \u2014I knew that I came home to uncertainty. And I was thinking if it wouldn\u2019t\nbe better if I would stay in labor camp, because other people \u2014 I came with the first\npeople who took to labor camp in 1941. The second time what they stayed \u2014 took\nthe young people in labor camp, it was in 1941. So those people stayed til 1943, two\nre \u2014 two years.

Even at home I was upstairs, you know, in the attics, and it was \u2014 again,\nyou couldn\u2019t see that it \u2014 because it\u2019s very slow \u2014 very low it was, so you hardly can\nstay there. And there I was hiding many times. But I mentioned with Alfred\nSalzman(ph), because he was a neighbor, and we saw, during a small window for\nexample, at \u2014 early in the morning, or at two o\u2019clock in the \u2014 a-after midnight, the\nguardists that came after me, looking for me. And I was hiding over there and they\nwere standing and looking around all over, and looking for me. And you can \u2014 you\ncan feel it, how it wer \u2014 my feeling, I was chittering, you know. And then we\nstayed for example, even in wintertime for many days and nights. And secretly they\nApril 7, 1997\nbrought us early in the night, some food or something like that.

But this was like a camp where they were\nholding the \u2014 the people who later were sent anyhow. So we knew about Sered and\nNovaky, that\u2019s what I heard.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Very hard, because we never knew \u2014 we knew what had happened and my father\nstill believed that something will happen, some miracle, and they will \u2014 and they\nwill let us be, or they will \u2014 they will \u2014 somehow he will save us. And then he said,\nin the \u2014 when he thought were really bad [indecipherable] then we will go to\nApril 7, 1997\nHungary too. But with \u2014 with this time, what \u2014 we saw what\u2019s happening then in\nHungary, we couldn\u2019t go because it was all the same danger, like in Slovakia. And\nthen we heard that they remove anyhow, all the Jews to a safer place in western\nSlovakia.",
        "A: Later on, later \u2014 because in this time when we heard from Auschwitz and we\nfrom concentration camp, we heard il \u2014 some far \u2014 someone called us that our\nbrother died in \u2014 in Majdanek. So we heard that are concentration camp, but was in\nlater, in 1944 or something like that. And by the way, this like, is not hear because I\n\u2014I don\u2019t know if you want to put on tape. About four years ago, my wife said \u2014 alee\n\u2014 that we are reading the \u2014 we are receiving a Czech newspaper, it comes from New\nYork, what are news from Czechoslovakia and so on. And one day we saw a\narticle there that some Jews who are even outside Czechoslovakia and who can\nprove that they were in concentration camp, or in the army with th-the Russians\nalways there, England. They can get some compensation, because the Germans\nsent some money to the Czech re \u2014 Czechoslovakia, and it will be like some\ncompensation because they were in concentration camp. So my wife said, look,\nmaybe \u2014 and she was \u2014 she was very fluent in Czech corresponding as a \u2014 because\nshe was a clerk in Czechoslovakia \u2014 and by the way, we have a Czech typewriter. I\nApril 7, 1997\ndon\u2019t know how it happened, but we bought away from a \u2014 during a friend or so on,\nwe had the Czech writer, because the alphabet in Czech 1s a little different. So she\nsays, you know what? I will try to write application for some people. Maybe they\nwill get. And I do \u2014I thou \u2014 I mentioned to my brother-in-law, and he said to a\nfriend of ours. So we wrote application, and really was happen, and we had t-to\nwrite the first application to the Ministry of Defense. They will prove \u2014 they could\nprove if you have \u2014 that you were like persecuted in a labor camp. And then they\ngive a paper, so-called law number 255. This 1s a law, a Czechoslovak law what\nrecognized that you were persecuted, and you were eligible in certain advantages.\nFor example, like I have the 255, I \u2014 and I get because I worked in Czechoslovakia\nmore than 25 years, I have pension, because I am eligible on normal pension. And\nI\u2019m better, if I get the normal pension, that I will get compensation through the\nGermans. So we wrote them, and I received the 255, and then we made the\napplication for the Czechoslovak Social Security, because they give the money.\nAnd th-that proved tha-that he was persecuted and were receiving the money. And\nin the pens \u2014 you have to have a affidavit from a doctor that he has certain illnesses,\nand he has \u2014 he has invalidity, 10 percent, 50 percent, 100 \u2014 and he gets certain\namount of money. And we have about five people already. And some get 35 dollars\na month, some get 60 dollars a month. And in one occasion he get 110 dollars a\nApril 7, 1997\nmonth, and were received through backwards for half a year, or year, or th-th \u2014\nthousand dollars, or 1200 dollars, besides what \u2014 and they receiving every month,\neven today. So \u2014 and I needed addresses for certain concentration camp, because\nyou have to prove that th-they were in concentration camp. So I went here, to the\nHolocaust Museum, and get out maybe 30 or 26 addresses, even from small\nconcentration camps. And what the people told us, there were this concentration\ncamp, this cencontra \u2014 well, from the [indecipherable] from the concentration\ncamp, they were sent to work in a factory. The factory actually received people to\nwork from the sod \u2014 concentration camp. It was for a hundred people, 150 people.\nSo I went there into the da \u2014 and suddenly, when these people received the money,\nhe said \u2014 the one friend told to the other friend you wouldn\u2019t believe, we are almost\n50 people, what we made applications from \u2014 beside that, two years ago came new\nlaws in Czechoslovakia, so it\u2019s more complicated. You need more proof, more\npapers. So I went to the library in the Holocaust Museum, I took all the addresses,\nbecause we had to write to all those concentration camp. We write in Polish, we\nwrite in English, we write in German. And to the international cross in Arles, and in\nall over. And all the peoples are coming, so there are proof there were some da \u2014\nand Ill have to translate from English to Czech, from German to Czech, from\nPolish to Czech, from Russian to Czech and I am doing all these things, and I have\nApril 7, 1997\n\u2014 I\u2019m translating. I am going to notarize my signature that I translated. So you\ncannot imagine what a work, what we would \u2014 1f you \u2014 1f you would know that it\ntakes so long, we wouldn\u2019t do it. And you know what, we don\u2019t take money from\nthose people, and we are doing this free. Some people when they receive the paper\ngave us, I don\u2019t know, they gave us 20 dollars or so, or nothing, we don\u2019t ask the\nmoney, because they see how much work it has. So what I wanted to say, I went to\nthe con \u2014 to the labor \u2014 to the Holocaust Museum. Suddenly I saw a thick two\nbooks. And I saw people \u2014 can you stop for a moment? I bring you to show you\nsomething. [break] It runs?",
        "A: So, actually, I can be very grateful and thankful for all those people, to my wife,\nbecause it was her idea, and s-she makes the lot, a lot of work. She spends hours,\nhours of her free time with all those papers and everything. And so I went to the\nHolocaust Museum, and in there find two books, and that\u2019s what the book says.\nYou can read it.",
        "A: Yes, in English.",
        "A: And here you know what? There I find the name of my brother.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That\u2019s \u2014 this is the date when he was born, and there he\ndied.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And I went to ma \u2014 a rabbi, and he wrote me down when I have\n[indecipherable] right after \u2014",
        "A: So there you see the feeling what I had, and I said to myself, all those work what\nwe are doing, it was worth it that I went there because this is something \u2014 you\ncannot imagine what it means to us. What \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 what the \u2014 suddenly, it\nhappens that we had to make this, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t go to look for addresses or\nsomething. I was in the Holocaust Museum many times, but the \u2014 I would go to\nlook for something, and this a \u2014I went there, and this what I found.",
        "A: Very much so. Because at least \u2014 and for my sister too, because they knew at\nleast \u2014 because we had different stories, he died there, he went there. And now we\nApril 7, 1997\nknow exactly what happened to him. At least we know that he didn\u2019t suffer two or\nthree years there. And I know, for example, my father, you know ma \u2014 I-I didn\u2019t say\nwhen, my father \u2014 it happened when my father they took to concentration camp\nfrom Nova Nestu(ph) like I told you, it was in October, and I met some guy from\nour city, who went with the same transport from Sered to Auschwitz with him, but\nhe was a tall guy, he was much younger, he survived. Co \u2014 and I met him, and he\nsaw my father when Mengele sent him to the left, immediately, in Auschwitz. He\nsaw \u2014 he \u2014 he said it was few, maybe 20 or 25 people in front of me. But he\nsurvived because he was a strong guy, he was four \u2014 1n the 40s or so, so he went \u2014\nthey put him the \u2014 to go to work. He \u2014 then he came to United States this guy, and I\nmet him, he wa \u2014 when I came to United States here, but he died already.",

She went to Auschwitz, she was in Dresden, she\nwas in \u2014 what do you call that \u2014 not in Poland. I was in \u2014 visiting there, because I\nwas in Auschwitz twice, and I was \u2014 Stutthof, she went to Stutthof. I was there,\nand I look the concentration camp, but it\u2019s nothing left, only \u2014 only the \u2014 the oven is\nthere and some grounds where the barracks were standing.\nApril 7, 1997",

        "A: That the \u2014 the feeling was in this moment that maybe we\u2019 ll see each other the\nlast time. So, what can I say, a feeling is. I said, I\u2014 I remember I thought to myself,\nI would like to know if we would know at least if someone for us \u2014 from our \u2014 both\nof us will survive. What can I \u2014 because I saw \u2014 in this time I saw th-the \u2014 the other\nsituation there.",
        "A: During the war, many times. Like a \u2014 I \u2014 I never thought that I will see someone\nfrom my family again, or if they \u2014 someone will survive, if they will see me.\nBecause actually, especially when I was [indecipherable], people were dying next\nto me. I was only the lucky one that I survived. Or, for 17 days in wintertime, in\nJanuary, we didn\u2019t have food, we didn\u2019t have what to eat. So \u2014 and we were hiding,\nwe were \u2014 we lived on the \u2014 1n the woods, and it was the pa \u2014 the trees, you know,\nunder the trees, was free place around, was snow. So we were sleeping under the\ntrees where the snow was blown out. And we had a ration of so-called bread, but\nactually it was crumb from dark, black bread, because it was old bread, it was in \u2014\nsmelled with \u2014 the whole thing. So we received a cup of the old bread, because you\ncouldn\u2019t slice it, it was crumbs only, it was so old. So that cup of this crumbs, so-\ncalled went for two or three days. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s all, and water \u2014 instead of water\nwe ate snow, for 17 days because we are \u2014 we were circummed \u2014\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: Circumround.",
        "A: We could \u2014 we couldn\u2019t move out because the Germans, so this 1s the other part\nof that. So I never was thinking that I will survive if I will \u20141f I will survive for the\nnext hour, you know.",
        "A: When she left from Hungary to us in 1943.",
        "A: Yeah, in this time we were saw that we will come after you, we will see each\nother and [indecipherable] back, will come back. You know, it was hard, we were\ncrying and so it, you know, we leave then \u2014 with some member of the family are\nleaving \u2014 leaving you, it was uncertainty. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to you,\nwhat\u2019s happened to her. It was hard, it was hard every day to be with her. She don a\n\u2014 and you have a household, and you don\u2019t have a mother. So, it wa \u2014 1t was hard\nfor my father too, it\u2019s a \u2014\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: Me, my father and the sister, you know, who \u2014 already who doesn\u2019t want to talk\nabout. And actually, she was in this time about 15 years old, and she was holding,\nor keeping the whole \u2014 whole household, cooking and washing and everything.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Ah, because I was a \u2014 yeah, my \u2014 our \u2014 our father too. But still, my \u2014 we had til\nthe \u2014 in this time certain ti \u2014 certain times, like permission to stay, but actually it\nwas only for my father. It says that for the family, but you can never guarantee\nbecause they were \u2014 first of all, all the time, even later years, in \u00b042 - \u201943, after\nyoung people, because they know \u2014 they needed for work. If someone was working\nthere around vaca \u2014 concentration camp for one year, it don\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t care if\nsurvive or not survives. So \u2014 especially when someone came concentration camp,\nfor example, women with children. Women were better when they came in\nconcentration camp by theirselves. But you know how it was, every mother goes\nwith their children because they immediate \u2014 in Auschwitz they divided the men\nApril 7, 1997\nseparate, and women with children a \u2014 separate women by itself. So they saw a\nwoman with children, they immediately sent to the oven. So, it was \u2014 and then\nwomen realized, even it was heartbreaking, so they let the children, separate the\nchildren, and they survived, because they didn\u2019t go with the children, otherwise\nthey would go to the chimney \u2014 to the oven, too. So the children \u2014 anyhow, very\nfew survived. And my sister [indecipherable] was here. She went from Hungary\nto concentration camp and she was lucky, because she went with some cousins. And\nshe was, in this time she was 14 and a half years old. And so the women were \u2014\nthey were \u2014 the SS came many times to look for children, so they were hiding her in\nconcentration camp. And they were \u2014 they were so malnutritious they don\u2019t \u2014\ndidn\u2019t have any food, so other women brought pieces of bread only to get here to\ngive her, or I don\u2019t know, if they found something, a little milk or something. And\nshe wa \u2014 but she was her \u2014 she was lucky that she was always \u2014 her \u2014 her \u2014 her\nbody, her looks, more older than she was, actually. Even today, she is tall \u2014 taller.\nSo that \u2014 and she went to work, she was working with the other women in\n[indecipherable] manufacture, hard working. And many times other women,\nespecial the cousins, took the hard work instead of her because they worked, for\nexample in [indecipherable] to do certain amount of work, and she couldn\u2019t. So the\nother people were \u2014 even when they know that they\u2019re going \u2014 looking for children\nApril 7, 1997\nor for something. Or even so to look around, they didn\u2019t see her. So they were\nhiding her in concentration, many time. And like I\u2019m saying, they bought certain\nfood for her, that she survived.",
        "A: No, no, and I never came out \u2014 that was only from four \u2014 1940 to 1942. If I\nwould go in a labor camp, or if someone, for example to Novaky or to some people\nthey took there, and they were working, they were standing there, they were staying\nin no \u2014 Novaky, they were working there for weeks and months. Then \u2014 but they \u2014\nthey sent them anyhow to concentration camp.",
        "A: Yeah, th \u2014 but no, th \u2014 I was separated mainly after they caught him in October\nthen in 1944, then we were separated. Even before I was few days in beginning of \u2014\nin the end of September and the beginning October, I was actually the partisans\nalready.",
        "A: I went to \u2014 normally I wa \u2014 I made the \u2014 I-I didn\u2019t want \u2014 I want to be a free\ncountry, I want to be help, to fight the Germans. And this time the \u2014 when I came to\nthe first partisan, most of the people were Slovaks. It was about 75 or 80 people,\nApril 7, 1997\nand there were about maybe 10 or re \u2014 12 Russians. And they were Russians who\neither escaped from labor camp, or escaped from the [indecipherable] some out\nfrom the army or so. So \u2014 and then later on, actually these Russians, because mostly\nabout six or seven of them were officers. So then, they made a special battalion and\nother Russians started to come, because actually \u2014 and when the uprising came in\nAugust 1944 to Banska Bystrica, the Russian sent some Russian people to help for\nalph \u2014 uprising. So actually many Russian people then stayed there, even the\nRussian army told them to stay there and help through the uprising. So hundred and\nhundred of Russian people stayed there in Slovakia. So that\u2019s where I get there in \u2014\nsometime November or so, with the Russian. But you know, with the partisans in\nthis time were so \u2014 we were, for example, one battalion. And suddenly we were in\nfighting with the German and they were \u2014 we were overpowered. So suddenly, like\nwe disappeared, 10 people here, three people there, 40 people there. So it took time,\neven weeks sometimes to get put together again. Sometime it happened that, for\nexample [indecipherable] occasion sometimes in December, I was with about 16 or\n18 people. We were wandering about for three weeks, til we find the other bigger \u2014\nlarger group.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: In the forest, in the woods, they\u2019re all over there. And then they used to come to\nthe small, you know, like [indecipherable] to the houses, what was separate, six,\neight houses. And those people were always helping the partisans, because those\nwere mostly all Protestants, not Catholics.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, automatic pistol.",

It was\nfrightening, but you know, in this time, actually, when you live this kind of life, you\ndon\u2019t later on, believe me, you don\u2019t think about living and dying. You forgot.

        "A: You mean whe \u2014 you mean \u2014 oh, here and there I thought it would be nice to\nsurvive, but I said I \u2014 many times I thought to myself, what if \u2014 how it will if I\nsurvive, and nobody from my family? Because in this time I knew very well what\u2019s\ngoing on in concentration camps. So thi \u2014 by the time \u2014 and it was \u2014 I even met in\nJanuary, or in February, two Russian guys who escaped from a concentration camp\nin Poland. Because mary \u2014 many Russian soldiers were in concent \u2014 labor camps\nand in concent \u2014 even concentration camps. They were separate like other \u2014 like, for\nexample, from Jews. And they came, I talked to them about \u2014 maybe for 10 minutes\nor so. It was \u2014 it was winter in 1945, I remember exactly. Then \u2014 because the\nRussian \u2014 the Russian kommandatura, what we had there, they sent them back,\nthey disappeared, I don\u2019t know what happened to them.",
        "A: Oh yeah, very much so. Especially from the Russians. And I had, for example,\nwhen I was \u2014 the last few weeks what I was with the partisans, especially I think I\nmentioned there in the thing, I was a captain, a Russian, his name was\nApril 7, 1997\nMosalchuk(ph) or something like that. He was \u2014 he must be a white Russian like\nwe used to say [indecipherable] anti-Semitic, and later on, I f\u2014I feel sorry, I mean,\nit was a captain, and I thought always that he must be Jewish, because he was all the\ntime so nice to me. And he \u2014 maybe he was suspicious. He knows me \u2014 he knew me\n[indecipherable] call, you know, I \u2014 short name for Uri. And I was afraid this time\nyou know, because I didn\u2019t trust much the Russians, because I saw what they are\ndoing, even on their own people, even with their partisans. If something was \u2014 say\nthey did something wrong, he didn\u2019t hesitate, he shot him. He didn\u2019t hesitate. He\n[indecipherable] probably drunk or something, or he didn\u2019t do right what he\u2019s\nsupposed to do. He didn\u2019t take a shot \u2014 take \u2014 shot him, and that\u2019s all. And so I\nthought that he was Jewish, and he maybe thought \u2014 and I said to myself, no, after\nthe war, I return. But I lost sight of him about a week before we were liberated, and\nI never saw him again. Never saw him again. He got lost somewhere, it was about a\nweek or 10 days, some time end of March.

        "A: Oh, well, ma-many times he said to \u2014 oh those Jews, you know, yahvrai(ph),\nyahvrai(ph), yahvrai(ph).

        "A: No, it was [indecipherable]. No, it was occasional. It wasn\u2019t like day to day, not\nat all. But still, you could feel some that \u2014 you know how it is, you are betwee \u2014 the\nsu \u2014 you don\u2019t have to listen to words, you can \u2014 you have to feel it.",
        "A: I was involved in one train attack, but if you put only mines, we go \u2014 went down,\nwe put only mines, and then it was like for timing, you know.

And most of the time\nApril 7, 1997\nwhat we were fighting, we were actually all the time moving. To tell you the truth,\nmost of the time we tried not to be involved in the fight with them, because most of\nthe time they were \u2014 we were \u2014 we overpowered, because they \u2014 we were, for\nexample, 60 people or a hundred people, they were a few hundred. And they had\nheavy armament we didn\u2019t have. We had some machine guns, th-the light machine\nguns. Maybe one time we had, one or two, the heavy machine guns. But we lost, for\nexample, in a fight. We have dead bodies that are \u2014 so, it was hard. Sometimes we\nregret that we have even only rifles.",
        "A: No. I had the one time it was sometime \u2014 this 1s another story. Some times in\nNovember, it was a Jewish guy whom I knew from home. He was in a city not far\nfrom Michalovce, Medzilaborce, and his father was a pharmacist. And he was with\nme like a partisan, and we were in a fight sometimes in end November or\nDecember. And he was like so far like from here to the TV. And he got a bullet here\nstraight in the chest. And I don\u2019t know how you call this bullet. This was a bullet\nwhat took apart your body. And he was in \u2014 died next to me, I saw he wa \u2014 and\nusually, when someone died, even it was a German or a Russian or a \u2014 or a Slovak\nor so, usually, especially it was close to a village or so, and they knew already they\nwent, because the people used to go to the forest there and so they saw some dead\nApril 7, 1997\npeople, so they buried them. They buried them there, or they took them to the\ncemetery. Anyhow, so I don\u2019t know here \u2014 where he was buried. Can you imagine?\nLife you know, the \u2014 the li \u2014 the human life is so unpredictable. And in 1946, I met\nhis sister, she survived the Holocaust. She was a year younger than he was. And it\nwas hard for me, and I met her in \u2014 in Prague. And she somehow \u2014 I don\u2019t know if\nshe knew us, we were talking and talking, and then we were talking about the\nbrother. And he was \u2014 she was really suspicious that I knew about him, or she\n[indecipherable] us. And then I told him, you know, Vera, I was with your brother\nduring the war. And she hold my hand and she says, Mitu(ph), tell me what\nhappened to him. I couldn\u2019t talk for a moment. And I told her, you know, I am sad\nto tell you, that in November 1944 he was hurt and he died like a partisan. She\nhugged me. And that was in a restaurant. We were crying. Can you tell me where he\nis buried? And I told her, Vera, I am sorry to tell you that I cannot tell you, because\nI know it was in the forest, it was like out of the forest, it was like a free space, but\nusually the people were \u2014 are buried, those people, I cannot tell you, but I know it\nwas about 10 kilometers from Kleiner(ph), 12 kilometers. But I ge \u2014 well, 1t was\nvery hard. And the next year, in 1947, I think she moved there to Australia. And I\ndon\u2019t know what happened to \u2014 then with her, she \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 she got married there.\nSo tha-that\u2019s was the other story, sad story.\nApril 7, 1997",
        "A: [indecipherable] you know. Maybe some people, if someone would \u2014 I would\nmeet, or someone would \u2014 someone come along from Medzilaborce, they will\nremember the name for sure. Because there in Medzilaborce, this is a \u2014 a smaller\ncity than Michalovce, but was some Jews, maybe sa \u2014 some hundred Jews for sure.\nVery religious city, 1t was, a very Orthodox. It was opposite like in Michalovce I\nthink there were more Orthodox like [indecipherable] everything for Ashkenazi or\nsomething. You know, this is how to \u2014 you know, can\u2019t remember everything, ever\nwhat\u2019s happened. For example, just few days ago, I don\u2019t know, we were talking\nabout with my sister, and she mo \u2014 she mentioned someone who survived, and we\nwere together in 1947 or \u201948. And I said, you know what? I long time never even\nremember that he survived. And we were talking also someone, so, you know, I\u2019m\nstill wondering, you know, I still think it\u2019s a plus, and I feel til tod \u2014 til today, 52\nyears af-after the war, 55 years or somewhat, and I still remember so \u2014 little things I\nsaw. Things what \u2014 it\u2019s better maybe fo \u2014 I will forget, but I \u2014 it cannot be forgotten\nbecause this what you are doing, this is for generation, generation, we are \u2014 can be\nonly grateful that it will stay somewhere. And some people, in 50 years, a hundred\nyears will take a look and listen to this what happened.

        "A: This is a other story. If a \u2014 if I\u2014 you know, I \u2014 I mentioned to you how I became\nto \u2014 to this country. What \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to what we go \u2014 went down. You know, that\nthe other border from Slovakia to Hungary only, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "A: Okay, give me a call any time. And see two and a half \u2014 because it\u2019s still a long\ntime and with no question, all this \u2014 this what we went through, not only myself, all\nthose people, it left on your brain even mentally. In normal circumstances, I would\nremember more about the war, or knew about, but it was so many things that\nhappened, that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s important, what\u2019s not important, if you\nremember. Now it came to my mind maybe in a year or so, or so \u2014",
        "A: Oh many times. And you know, after the \u2014 after the war, it was a nightmare. It\nwasn\u2019t one night that I didn\u2019t dream that I\u2019m again in [indecipherable] in the labor\ncamp, that I am caught by the German. That all \u2014 now I saw my father, he came fr \u2014\nhome from labor camp, I saw. It was night of the night. Even when we came \u2014 when\nwe escape from Czechoslovakia, you cannot imagine how many times I had the\nApril 7, 1997\ndreams, oh they caught me on the border, oh I am again in jail, or something. And\nyou wake up, you are wet, sweating.",
        "A: Not \u2014 not now, but \u2014 now very seldom, but still it did very \u2014 happen.

And I\nwas so scared that you ho \u2014 you were holding me, I says, not to go farther, not to go\nfarther. And I said, I have to, I have to. And suddenly I woke up. So \u2014 something. I\nwas just thinking a moment ago what I wanted to tell you, oh my gosh. Yeah, for\nexample [indecipherable] yeah, for example, the first time, I forgot to mention,\nwhen they caught me, it was outside the village, around \u2014 about maybe a kilometer\nor so. And suddenly \u2014 they caught me when \u2014 because German army, about 30\nGerman are exercising outside the city. So when they saw \u2014 saw me that the guard\ncaught me to make identification, the \u2014 about 10 or 15 German soldiers are standing\na-around me, and they took me to the kommandatura. And people, the people who\nlived there, Christians, were standing, because it was some buildings already\n[indecipherable] they were standing outside. It was beginning of the \u2014 and they\nsaw I wa \u2014I was in this time in plain, civil clothing. And they saw the German\nsoldiers are hi \u2014 holding a civilian guy and going with him to the kommandatura.\nApril 7, 1997\nSo the Christian people, some women, were standing outside, started to \u2014 the\ncrossing, you know, praying for me. They were \u2014 they knew that they see it, and\nthey knew that partisans are around, and they knew a civil human being, between\nthem \u2014 German soldiers that they knew that I\u2019m certainly a partisan, and that is the\nend of me.

And this, you know, we-went for a wedding\nlast year to Los Angeles, his \u2014 his niece [indecipherable] married in Los Angeles,\nyou know, wa \u2014 Arthur Salzman(ph). And so we met again, we met a few times in\nNew York. But then we didn\u2019t see each other maybe seven or eight years. And we\nApril 7, 1997\nmet again. The first thing we see each other, we\u2019re hugging, because that\u2019s \u2014 and\nthe first thing oh, and you thi \u2014 immediately for relatives who \u2014 for American\npeople, so \u2014 but this guy, this what we survived. This is my body. And I said, not\ntrue, because you are my body, cause we were hiding for more than a year together.\nHe is older than I am, he is in the a \u2014 82, I think.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I thought more \u2014 I think \u2014 I-I thought, oh, this is the end, this will be \u2014 pretty\nsoon be the end of the war, because I saw all those people, hundred \u2014 thousands of\npeople, everage \u2014 everybody excited. They was standing on a \u2014 on a truck, and give\neverybody a rifle. Everybody a rifle.",
        "A: It was [indecipherable] immediately came the Czechoslovak flags, and came\nCzechoslovak signs. Our freedom is here, and \u2014 against the German, you know,\nsigns, against the Slovak army. But after about six weeks, and went immediately to\nApril 7, 1997\nthe forest, and fighting against the German. But then, end of October, the German\nput thousand of tho \u2014 thousand military with heavy weapons, with tanks and\neverything. That\u2019s when they liquidated the uprising. That\u2019s where everybody who\n\u2014 some people, especial Christian, went home. Some went to the forest, some went\nin \u2014 that\u2019s what it started to make separate partisan battalions.",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 and then after Banska [indecipherable] sometimes in\nOctober, November I went again with my father and my sister to Nova Mest(ph).\nThere I stayed for a few days and then I went in October, end of October again to\nthe partisans, because I heard they are not far away in the forest, so I went there.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. He was in Bratislava.",
        "A: And from Bratislava, he came to Nova Mesto(ph), that where he stayed.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nApril 14, 1997\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Later on. It was the end of sometimes \u2014 a month later, like it started \u2014 started\nabout the \u2014 exactly the 29\" of August, 1944. And in this time I was in Bratislava\nwith my father. And then he left \u2014 w-we had to leave because they had said that\nthe German will occupied \u2014 will occupied Slovakia. So, after a few weeks,\nsometimes end of \u2014 middle of [indecipherable] the 15\" or 20 of Sep-September,\nwe left Bratislava and went to Nova Mesto(ph), where we stayed, I stayed for a\nfew days with my father. And then I went for about two or three days to Banska\nBystrica, and from there they send it, or they told us to go to the forest. Then I\nstarted, about the end of September, I think it was \u2014 yeah, the last week\nSeptember, with a group. But this was only \u2014 only few Russian, some Slovak,\nsome \u2014 even I think about two or three Czechs.",
        "A: Partisans. And then I wa \u2014 actually when I started. And then later on, it was end\nof October. In October the \u2014 the German came in and started to occupy Slovakia,\nApril 14, 1997\nand they took over all the ruins and everything in Slovakia, special in western\nSlovakia, where the \u2014 was the most of the upr-uprising, and \u2014",
        "A: In Banska Bystrica most of the time, specially the fir \u2014 1-in September and in\neven beginning of October, mostly they were organizing, there was the \u2014 the main\nga \u2014 kommandatura the \u2014 the \u2014 from the partisans, the \u2014 how they call them? The\n\u2014all the \u2014 I mean, all the high officers and everythi \u2014 who \u2014 who were organizing\nthe uprising, because the \u2014 from Banska Bystrica, they were organizing the\nuprising, who it was part in eastern Europe, not far Michalovce where I lived, it\nwas in the mountains abou-about 15 or 20 kilometers from north of Michalovee, it\nwas a small group. The most of them they were in the higher Tatra in the mou \u2014\nmountains, and the lower Tatras in the mountains. So the whole organization was\na \u2014 the \u2014 from Banska Bystrica, they made the whole \u2014 like \u2014 they organized\nfrom Banska Bystrica, from all the time. And beside that, in Banska Bystrica\nwas the first actually Czechoslovak \u2014 so-called Czechoslovak government in exile,\nand many high ranking officials came from London, and then the Russian started\nto drop munition and weapons from the air, first from the air and then even many\ntimes they landed in Banska Bystrica, there touch outside from Banska Bystrica,\nor they brought a we-weapon the Russian, or [indecipherable] for the uprising.\nApril 14, 1997",
        "A: Yeah, before the German, before the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, bu-but it was because as soon as was the uprising August the 29\",\nactually the whole, especially in the middle Slovakia, and western Slovakia, the\nso-called \u2014 the freedom fighters, and the democratic like organization of they\ncalled, like the first Czechoslovak, like a government, took over all the \u2014 the \u2014\nactually they \u2014 they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they took over the power there in Slovakia\n\u2014 most of the Slovakia\u2019s [indecipherable] most of the part of Slovakia. But then\nin October it started the German came in, and it started to occupy Slovakia and\nthey took it over, so all \u2014 actually all the uprising and all the partisans and even the\n\u2014 all the \u2014 the \u2014 the high officers and the government of-officers pull out from\nBanska Bystrica, and everything went to the forests, to the mountains. That was\nsometimes in October, I don\u2019t remember exactly because it was \u2014 it took many,\nmany days.",
        "A: Yeah.\nApril 14, 1997",
        "A: Oh yeah, actually I was with him about for four or five weeks, only it was end\nof December and in January, in January, because what we were in a fight, it was\nend of January, and that\u2019s \u2014 I remember the place what I ha \u2014 I \u2014if I would go\nthere, but I don\u2019t reme \u2014 you know, remember the name at wa \u2014 I was in the forest,\nin the so-called kopanice(ph), I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to call this in English, it was a\nplaces when it was forest, then 1t was five, six houses. There was again forest, then\nagain some houses. And then not far away a little, in the mountains there, it was\nabout \u2014 I can say about so \u2014 almost eight or 10 miles from the main road\n[indecipherable] right there in the mountains, in the forest. There where he died,\nit was a\u2014 like a\u2014a clear space out of the woods, and there where he died. And not\nfar away, about maybe four or 500 yards were some \u2014 about four or five houses.\nSo probably those people took care of him and buried him somewhere, but I am \u2014\nI don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know where.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it was against the German, yeah. Because sometimes \u2014 actually\nfrom end of September when I started with the uprising, til the fourth of, or third\nof \u2014 the fourth of April, 1945, most of the time I was with different groups or \u2014 of\npartisans, because many times we were fighting, and we were, for example 80 or a\nhundred people, and suddenly they \u2014 the German overpowered us, so we dis \u2014\ndisappeared from each other, we dispersed. So, then we had to look for each other\nApril 14, 1997\nand sometimes I didn\u2019t even find some people because they went to other group,\nand I didn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happened, if they survived, or not survived. So that,\nfor example was about maybe four or five times that I had to look for a group, and\nI was, all together about with three or four different groups, because where I found\na group, so I took part with them. I didn\u2019t look for the group what I was before,\nbecause I didn\u2019t know even they exist, because it were \u2014 we were a group, for\nexample, 70 - 80 people. So five or six people went there, 10 went there and some\ndied, so 1t was dispersed, so we catched where we could.",
        "A: Yeah, I wer \u2014 the whole time I was living for tha \u2014 they didn\u2019t know my\noriginal name.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Hirschkovitz(ph) knew.",
        "A: This is the only guy who knew that I was Jewish, he knew fr \u2014 where I\u2019m from\nand everything.\nApril 14, 1997",
        "A: Oh, it a\u20141t was about maybe 15 or 20 feet from me.",
        "A: So he \u2014 he stayed there. We had after \u2014 because we were in a fight, so we had\nto move. So I left. When I left he still was there, so if they buried him the same\nday or next day, I don\u2019t know[indecipherable] to because I never came back on\nthis place.",
        "A: Yeah, I saw him, I saw him, he get the \u2014 like a \u2014 a bullet what it tur \u2014 tore apart\nhis chest. I don\u2019t know what to call \u2014 how to call this kind of a bullet. It was\nagainst the Geneva Convention to use these kind of bullets, and they used it, the\nGerman used it.",
        "A: I left my father there because I went with the partisan til sometimes end of\nSeptember, so here \u2014 he \u2014 he stayed there in Nova Mesto(ph) in this apartment,\nand we decided that I will see what the \u2014 the situation, and I will check how the\nconnection, that someone will come and pick him up, and I \u2014 I wa \u2014 I even had\nApril 14, 1997\nfamily who was willing for a small [indecipherable] not in the part \u2014 in the forest\nto \u2014 for to keep him, to hide him, because my father had some money with him\ntoo. So \u2014 and we tried, and then we were fine, because we had the other family, his\nname was Farkos(ph), who was a neighbor of ours in Michalovee. And I knew\nthat he is there hiding already in the forest, so our plan was that on \u2014 my father\nwill come there, we\u2019ll stay for a few days there with this family, with a Christian\nfamily. And then he will probably go there with the Farkos(ph) couple, this is the\n\u2014he and his wife. Then \u2014 and they s \u2014 the Farkos(ph) couple even survived, and\nthey went after the war to Israel, and they died then in Israel. And his sons, he\nhad one, two, three sons, they still live in Israel, and I met them \u2014 no, four sons\nactually, because the fifth son, th-the \u2014 he died in concentration camp. So \u2014 and I\nmet them when I was in Israel about eight years ago, 10 years ago the first time.\nAnd then I met them about three or four years ago when I was in Slovakia when\nwe had the reunion with people from the labor camp. And then in Michalovce\nthey dedicated a plaque on a building, it was the official \u2014 the \u2014 not the city hall,\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 what is more than the city \u2014 I-I mean, the around all the \u2014 how\nyou call the office? Actually [indecipherable] there \u2014 there \u2014 there was a \u2014 there\nwere the \u2014 we had in Michalovee the big synagogue, because we have many of\nthem like I mentioned before, and this were the biggest synagogue, and this were\ndestroyed \u2014 actually damaged during the war, and then nobody want to take it\nApril 14, 1997\nover, so they turned it down after the war. And there, on these plates, they build\nthe building on the district \u2014 the office of the district of Michalovece, and there\nthey dedicated a plaque in Slovak and in Hebrew that it \u2014 there on this place was a\nsynagogue for the Jews who were \u2014 who were killed in the concentration camp\nduring the war, and I think even they say the \u2014 no, not \u2014 the numbers, I think th \u2014\nare not there, how many of them. But that\u2019s \u2014 and this \u2014 I have saw here a picture\nfor it. I\u2014 maybe it will be [indecipherable] these pictures here. I have got \u2014 I have\nto check, I will check \u2014",
        "A: With a Christian, yeah it was a wind \u2014 a widow.",
        "A: N-Na \u2014 no, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t say I come back, I said that I will send someone, a\nChristian, you know, from \u2014 over from the mountains, who will pick him up and\nbring that to the forest, that he go to \u2014 go in hidin \u2014 into hiding.",
        "A: And, it was the exact date when they has \u2014 the guy has to come, and like I \u2014 I\ncame down there, because the guy came to me, and he said, he went there to the\napartment and my father wasn\u2019t there already. And the woman told him that he \u2014\nbecause he\u2019s supposed to come \u2014 to come around six \u2014 6:30 in the morning. And\nhe couldn\u2019t wait, he was afraid because the German were \u2014 were making razzias\nApril 14, 1997\nall over, and were looking for Jews to take to the concentration \u2014 because it was\nactually one of the last \u2014 the last aktions, what the German were looking for Jews\nto take concentration camp. So he was afraid, like the guy told me \u2014 the women\ntold him, that he was afraid that they will came in to pick him up. So he left her\napartment around five o\u2019clock in the morning, that means about one and a half or\ntwo hours earlier than he\u2019s supposed to be there. And wh-when he came, like I\nmentioned already, he came to there \u2014 because it was not far on the outskirt of the\ncity of Nova Mesto(ph), and all \u2014 exactly out of the outskirt was a military\nbarracks, and he went this way out of that city, because he knew actually where\nhe\u2019s supposed to go, where he\u2019s supposed to \u2014 the guy is supposed to take him. So\nthere they confronted him, they wanted identification, even he had Christian\npapers. So, you know, they immediately saw on him that he was [indecipherable]\nso they took him inside in the \u2014 on the kommandatura. And there they saw\nactually \u2014 they saw that he is Jewish, and so they took him then to Sered, and\nfrom there they took him to the concentration camp where he [inaudible] yeah, to\nAuschwitz, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but he died, he di \u2014 I hi\u2014I heard from him here in the United States\nwhen I came in 1960 \u2014 in 1971, so \u2014 and my sister told him that it \u2014 talked to him,\nbecause he was from the same city from where we were, he was from Michalovee,\nApril 14, 1997\nand he said that he went with the same transport, and with the \u2014 he came to\nAuschwitz, so he was a \u2014 he was a tall guy, and he was much younger with my \u2014\nthan my father, so they took him to \u2014 Mengele too \u2014 took him to the right side for\nwork, and my father went a few, maybe 10 or 15 people in front of him, Mendele\n\u2014 Mengele took him to the left, to the oven.",
        "A: I-I actually met this man \u2014 I heard about him, but I met him actually here in the\nUnited States. Then when he told me that my father went \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, because \u2014 yeah, because the \u2014 the guy who came from this woman, they\ntold him \u2014 she told him that probably went to there, because if he didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] and I didn\u2019t find him, not during the war, that means from end of\nOctober or so til after the war, so I knew that he went there.",
        "A: So, we were waiting because then, after \u2014 few weeks after the war, I was\nwaiting, I went back to Michalovee, and was looking. So then I saw a \u2014 after few\nweeks, my one sister came back, Haide(ph), some times in June, I think. And then\nI heard someone came from Budapest, that my younger sister is alive. So we were\nwaiting for it, you know, after few days or few weeks, the other sister, who lives\nhere in Detroit, Tullulah(ph), came back, so we met together in Michalovece, but\nApril 14, 1997\nwe didn\u2019t know what to do. And then we had \u2014 if I can continue now after the war,\nwe had the aunt in Vranov, this was about 35 miles from Michalovce, she was a\nfirst cousin of my father. So she heard \u2014 they were looking and someone \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember how \u2014 if she heard about us, or we heard about her. Actually, we went\nthere to Vranov, to her, with her. We stayed there from \u2014 for awhile, and she says\nthat we can stay there, we will look if someone from the family will come back or\nnot. So then I had a friend in Michalovce who was me \u2014 who was we \u2014 with me\ntogether in labor camp. And he told me that he has a uncle in Liberec. This is\nabout 65 miles north of Prague. And he has a wholesale store here they gave him\nback, the Czechoslovak government, because he had this wholesale store before\nthe war, in hardware store and plumbing supply. So \u2014 and this was my profession\nwhat I was working during the war. So he somehow connected with him, and he\ntold me he was looking for someone who is responsible, and who is \u2014 who can\ntrust for \u2014 and who can trust, may \u2014 and I can get the job there. So I went there and\nintroduced myself, and he hired me. So it was in January \u2014 exactly in January\n1946. And between the \u2014 this time what we in \u2014 in Vranov, in Michalovce, we\nwent to Prague end of the year to look for someone if we were \u2014 some on the\nJewish organizations, if they will give some on the Red Cross, if they will give\nsome \u2014 some 1-information about our family members, but we didn\u2019t get anything.\nSo my sister went back to Vranov. They were there for a few months, and I stayed\nApril 14, 1997\nthe Liberec already, I started to work there. And then \u2014 but I [indecipherable]\nand then in \u2014 in Prague, I met some cousins from Slovakia, from Orlich(ph), who\nwere in Prague, stayed in Prague, and one of them was \u2014 one brother of this\ncousins, he was in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, and he came to Prague, was\nsometimes in middle s-summer, sometimes in August or September. So \u2014 and\nbecause he was ma \u2014 a soldier in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, he was\nfighting through the front and everything. So they had advantages that they gave\nthose people who was in the concentration camp, or who was fighting against the\nGerman, like partisans or \u2014 or in the military, that he can get certain stores or\nfactories, what it \u2014 after there was took over from the Germans. So this two\ncousins actually were received, they get a store in Jablonice(ph). This was about\neight miles from Liberec. It was a store what \u2014 with china, you know, with glass,\nchina, so [indecipherable]. So then my sisters came over to Jablonice(ph), sa \u2014\nfirst they stayed with me in Liberec for many, many months, maybe a year or so.\nAnd I \u2014 in ma \u2014 my sister, yeah, she stayed in Liberec the whole time. And then\nmy younger sister started to date, actually it was the brother of my cousin. And\nthey get married in 1948, and my sis \u2014 other sister, she started to date her next\nhusband, a Mr. Joe Dushinski(ph). So she get married, and they stayed in Liberec\ntil end of 1950 or the 1950s, when they escaped from Czechoslovakia and went to\nGermany, from Germany to Canada and from Canada to the United States. My\nApril 14, 1997\nyounger sister Lola, when she got married in 1948, end of 1948, yeah. He went \u2014\nthey went, I think with the Haganah to Germany and to France, to Paris where\nthey stayed there about I think for two years or so, I don\u2019t remember exactly. And\nthen they made corresponding because we had many relatives, first cousin, aunts\nand uncles here in the United States. So actually, they helped them, that after two\nyears or so they gave them a \u2014 th-they received a visa to Canada. They stayed\nthere for a few months or so, and then they received a visa, they came here to the\nUnited States. Between this time, my other sister Haide(ph), with her husband,\nthey escaped [indecipherable] money, I gave some money because he have to like\nbribe and give money for someone who knew the way to go to the border, to\ngerman \u2014 to east Germany. And they went to Berlin, and from ber \u2014 from east\nBerlin to have \u2014 to have tams \u2014 again for money, they went to west Berlin, and\nwaiting for the papers the same way they received from our relatives the paper, the\nvisa, because they were first cousin and uncles. They went to Canada, they came\nto Windsor, ma \u2014 first to Halifax, I think. They stayed there from Halifax to\nWindsor, and then after I don\u2019t know, for I think it was in 1952 or \u00b051 or\nsomething like that, they came to the United States, to Detroit, because here in\nDetroit, we have the \u2014 a cousin here, who was born here in the United States.\n100April 14, 1997",
        "A: About what?",
        "A: With who? With \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Then \u2014 then I actually, because even [indecipherable] and then actually the\nolder sister \u2014 the younger sister told me how she was to concentration camp \u2014\ncamp, how she survived the concentration camp. And the other sister was \u2014 she\nwas in hiding, she was in camp somewhere, all over there. She didn\u2019t want to talk.\nI don\u2019t want \u2014 I don\u2019t know, even today \u2014 actually \u2014 and I \u2014 I probably know\ncertain things what I \u2014 I have suspicions but I cannot tell because I am not certain\nwhat\u2019s happened with her, so \u2014 I don\u2019t know why. She doesn\u2019t trust him. If she\nhave \u2014 after \u2014 years after the war, if I started to talk her, she was shaking and she\nwas \u2014 so, I let her, but \u2014",
        "A: The \u2014 after the war it was \u2014 everybody was thinking, because it was really a\ndemocratic government. President BeneS, who escaped in 1939 to London, he\ncame back. First came KoSice, 1945, they established a new democratic\nApril 14, 1997\nCzechoslovak government. Then, after a few weeks, they came to Prague with a\nbig celebration, everything, because it\u2019s again the new Czechoslovak government.\nBut what had happened, the Russians, actually Stalin, even during the war, and it\nwas the fault of the American government of Roosevelt, actually, and Truman,\nthat they would trust \u2014 they trusted to Stalin, and even in 1945 they made the\nagreement in Tehran, Stalin with Churchill and Roosevelt, that how far the\nAmerican army, when they will liberate Europe and Germany and other, how far\nthey can go. Because actually Prague, and the mostly part of Czechoslovakia, the\nAmerican army was actually on the outskirts of Prague, and the Russian didn\u2019t let\nthem farther to go, and the Russians were far away, because they said it was\nagreement between Russia and the United States. So the American army had to\npull back, move west approximately to the city of Posen in Czeska(ph)\nBudavitsa(ph) and then they stayed. And the people were waiting til the Russian\ncame into Prague, because Stalin wanted political reasons it was, that\nCzechoslovakia would be influenced later on, ac \u2014 or \u2014 ma \u2014 with the \u2014 the gover\n\u2014 the \u2014 under a communist government. So actually then it was big celebration that\nthe Russian army liberated Prague and liberated Czechoslovakia, because the\ntrue was that the whole Slovakia and Moravia, the Russian army liberated. So it\nwas then, and it went to the history that the Russian army celebrated\nCzechoslovakia. Even the true 1s that the American army cel \u2014 liberated mo \u2014 the\n102April 14, 1997\nbiggest part of the Bohemia of Czech \u2014 o-of the Czech part of Czechoslovakia,\nbut the Russian didn\u2019t let them go farther.",
        "A: After many \u2014 after the year, til 1t was in 1946 - \u201947, but not later, because later,\nwhen in av \u2014 February the 25\", in 1948, the communists took over the\ngovernment. So then actually, was it all over that only the Russian army and the\nRussian people liberated Prague and Czechoslovakia. So it started to work the\ncommunist propaganda and it just \u2014 everybody to believe that it was only the\nRussian and Russian and Russian and from \u2014 excuse me, from this time out it was\nall thing \u2014 everything what the American did what \u2014 everything wrong, and\neverything \u2014 they wanted to \u2014 to take away everything from Czechoslovakia,\nfrom the factories and everything, because \u2014 so, it wa \u2014 the \u2014 sta \u2014 the Russians\nstarted \u2014 the Russian and the communist government started to br-brainwash the\npeople in the Czechoslovakia, and most of the people believed them.",
        "A: Well, sometimes no \u2014 s-sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes I suspicious,\nbut especial later on, when we had the opportunity to listen in hiding to the Voice\nof America, the \u2014 on radio, suddenly it \u2014 then it opened our eyes. Then \u2014 then we\nknew what really the true 1s.\n103April 14, 1997",
        "A: Actually, it was no much different like under the German, only this was \u2014 the\ndifference was, they didn\u2019t went straight on not \u2014 the \u2014 after the Jews, but they\nwent \u2014 if they heard something, everybody was afraid to openly to say tha \u2014 his\nopinion. Everybody what \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: It was so far that even a\u2014 a neighbor who didn\u2019t like a neighbor, or a \u2014 so he\nstarted to \u2014 to have against him personally, and he went to the secret police or to\nthe police and said, look, this \u2014 my neighbor, he said the \u2014 the Russian were\nstealing our liberation and he praised the American, 1t was enough. Immediately\ncame the secret police, took him away. And many people even disappeared,\nexactly never heard about them. And so the people were afraid. One neighbor was\nafraid the other neighbor. The people started not to trust even their closest friends,\nbecause this time the secret police started to look for informants. So you never\nknew even your next neighbor, or your next guy who was working with you in the\noffice or factory \u2014 actually, the people didn\u2019t trust. And it happened that even\n104April 14, 1997\nchildren went to the police and told to the police that something for own \u2014 own\nparents or something. And it was that they disappeared or they went to jail, and\nvery seldom that they came back. So it was a terror, actually. It \u2014 1t was sometimes\nworst than under the German. And then, even it was so far that Stalin send\nadvisors, his advisors \u2014 it was like secretive, what knew only later on, civilian\nadvisors, not even to the government, but even to \u2014 into factories, and it started the\nend of 1949, that it started a trial against people, against communists who were in\nhigh positions even before the war in Czechoslovakia. And even during the war,\nwho were suffering, who were 1n concentration camps. But Stalin wanted to get\nrid of them because he was afraid that probably they were a little more moderate.\nAnd then it came actually, it so-called the month of 1950, when the \u2014 it was then,\nit was the communist government in Czechoslovakia, that they went after people\nwho di \u2014 they didn\u2019t trust, even if \u2014 if \u2014 if no reason, but they didn\u2019t trust, they\ntook them and they started big trials in Czechoslovakia and they took actually\nwhat was the biggest trial, 14 people who were in high positions, even in th \u2014 after\nthe war, in the communist party, or in the government, in the communist\ngovernment. And they made the trial that they were Trotskys and they were spies\nagainst Russia, against the \u2014 Stalin, against [indecipherable] government in\nCzechoslovakia. And they had the big trial, and they \u2014 beti \u2014 between these 14\npeople were, I think, 12 or 13 Jews. And I think 12 of them, or 13, they\u2019re\n105April 14, 1997\nsentenced to die. They were hanged, or they were shot. All Jews, no ba \u2014 event,\nthey were shot between th-that [indecipherable] so-called the Slanksy(ph) trial.\nHe was a Jew but he was a big, high position in the communist party even before\nthe war already. So they get rid of all the Jews. About two survived, but all the\nJews were liquidated, what was \u2014 they all was \u2014 all were high ranking communist\nofficials.",
        "A: And then it started \u2014 yeah, I\u2019m sorry, you have the question?",
        "A: Ah, that\u2019s what I want to continue. I felt immediately, because in this time, in\n1949 and 1950 \u2014 1949 already, they took me \u2014 the police came to me and they\ntook me to the police. They were asking me what happened with my younger\nsister, with Lola. So I told them that in 1948, I \u2014 they disappeared, I don\u2019t know\nnothing about them. They didn\u2019t believe me. They kept me there about for a day or\nso. They let me go, but they called me many times. I was about four or five times\nthere on the police, asking questions, a \u2014 who \u2014 ho-how many relatives I have in\nAmerica, where I have relatives, what I am doing, what I \u2014 my corresponding is,\nwith whom I am corresponding and so on. And then in the 1950, my sister\nHaide(ph) what \u2014 she left Czechoslovakia, that was a nightmare for me, because\nthen they took me again to the police, and they hold me for a few days, two t \u2014\n106April 14, 1997\nthree days. Even in that it happened that I get pushed to the wall. Then even a day\n\u2014a slap my fa\u2014I get a slap on my face that I ha-hold my own hand. I don\u2019t know\nif I even told my wife some ta \u2014 this. Then they let me \u2014 this wasn\u2019t so easy\nbecause I wanted to go. They told me that I knew how my sister, both sister left\nCzechoslovakia and til I won\u2019t tell them, they will keep me and they will send me\nto Jachymov. That was a uranium mine, when they put the ra \u2014 uranium from\nmines, and all the uranium was sending to Russia, because they made that \u2014\nprobably the atomic bomb or so. And usually people who went \u2014 that was people\nwho were sent to Jachymov to the uranium mines, that was criminals, that was\npoli \u2014 who were politically \u2014 politically no-not trustworthy, and very few people\ncame back from there. They died. And if after many, many years someone came\nback, his health was completely \u2014 they get \u2014 they have cancer when they came\nback, most of them died, and very few survived more years in there, they let her\ngo after fef\u2014 15 or 20 years, or sometimes it happened where they saw someone\nget very sick and had some connections, so they let him go, but still \u2014 they let him\ngo home, but after many year \u2014 after a few years died because of cancer from the\nuranium, from the exposures to \u2014 to radiation.\n107April 14, 1997",
        "A: Very much so. And I can tell you, I have to mention maybe that they let me go\nafter a few days or so, 1f \u2014 it was because my wife, she was working in an office,\nand her president of the office wi \u2014 because it was a \u2014 for the \u2014 the main office for\nall the restaurants there, it was about 1500 people. He had some connection, the \u2014\nher boss had some connection with the police. So my wife probably told him, so\nhe actually, through my \u2014 my wife, through him, heard that the police let me go.\nBut that\u2019s later on, like I mentioned, my wife later on couldn\u2019t keep high position\njobs because they knew that her husband has relatives in America, so they didn\u2019t\ntrust her. So then, later on she was only like a clerk, because before she was in a\nhigher position, like a \u2014 in charge of the personnel department, from all the people.\nThen they \u2014 they \u2014 she couldn\u2019t keep this job, because they didn\u2019t trust her. So\nactually, they put her in a lower position there. But they needed her because, I\nhave to tell, she was a very good clerk, she was very smart and very capable to do\nthings. And her boss was great, because she did many work what she \u2014 he\u2019s\nsupposed to job \u2014 do. So actually, he didn\u2019t have to work so much, and other\npeople who were in charge. So actually, they used her to work more because the-\nthey knew that she has to if she wants to keep even the lower job. So but \u2014 like I\nmentioned before, we knew that after years and many times the police were\nwatching us specially. And like I mentioned before, the last time, we knew exactly\nthe \u2014 why they came to our apartment when we were at work and were checking\n108April 14, 1997\nwell \u2014 if they will find some letters or something, some material what they can use\nspecial against me, that I am in connection somehow with my sisters, or with\nrelatives in America.",
        "A: Re \u2014 re \u2014 they searched our house. Maybe they were mare \u2014 money \u2014 more\ntimes, but twice we knew exactly because w-we, like I mentioned, in our closets\nwe recognized, we knew, because w-we knew \u2014 we heard that they are doing this\nkind of work, the secret police, so we \u2014 exactly on purpose, we put certain things\nin our closets that we could then recognize that something \u2014 someone was there.\nAnd so the \u2014 actually, all those years, we were living with my wife, we couldn\u2019t\ntravel so much like we would like to. And they were watching \u2014 they were\nwatching us, all our steps. Because we were feeling and we saw suspicious people\naround us, along the \u2014 outside our apartment and so, because they were watching\nwho is coming to our apartment. Maybe they are watching where we are going,\nwith whom we are friends, with whom we are in connection. So that was\n[indecipherable] that was the reason \u2014 and in 1968, then \u2014 my sister \u2014 I\u2019m a little\ntoo far a-ahead, but in 1968 is when my sister\u2019s family \u2014 because here in the\nfamily, like I think I mentioned, was a Bar Mitzvah in the family and a wedding in\nthe family, here in Detroit and in Chicago. So, after \u2014 they sent me airline ticket,\nand I \u2014 invitation that I could come to visit. But they \u2014 I knew in advan \u2014 yeah,\n109April 14, 1997\nbetween the older [indecipherable] once a year and twice a year, my sister \u2014 I\nreceived a letter from one sister, from the other sister. But in this time, in\nCzechoslovakia they had the qui \u2014 equipment, because someone told me later on\nafter years, that they could read the letters who wanted \u2014 who \u2014 special letters who\ncame from the western countries. So actually, before I got the letter, and it was a\ncertain stamp, a letter stamp on the envelope, so actually they, under the secret\npolice, maybe in Prague already, or in Liberec, they actually read all the letters\nwhat I received. So they knew what they \u2014 what th-they are writing. And this\ntaught me \u2014 someone later on af \u2014 sometime in the 60s, I think he was in the secret\npolice, I am not sure, but I knew he \u2014 I went to school with him. And he \u2014 one day\nhe was drunk, and I met him, so \u2014 and he started to talk and I was asking him, so I\nfelt between his word what he was talking, that that \u2014 that\u2019s what the police,\nbecause he told me actually, they said, look, we knew everything, what\u2019s going on\neverybody, because we knew in a \u2014 everything what\u2019s going on because we had\nequipment what we [indecipherable]. So, in 1968 when I came here, it took me a\nlot of work, because I couldn\u2019t get the visa to America before I get the\npermission, a paper from the police in Liberec that they let me go for a visit. So \u2014\nand it took again th-the boss of my wife, he talked to someone of the police, so\nthat\u2019s where I could get the permission, and I went with the permission to the\nAmerican embassy in Prague, that\u2019s when I could get the visa. But they never let\n110April 14, 1997\ngo a couple together, special when they didn\u2019t have children, and we didn\u2019t have\nchildren. So actually I knew in advance because when my sisters wrote me that\nthey will invite us, so I told them in advance, they cannot \u2014 we couldn\u2019t get both\nof them. If I will lucky, I will get probably, but they had to pa \u2014 send the invitation\nonly for one person, for me. And that\u2019s what happened. And I knew for exactly\nbecause they told me, you know, in the police when I went with \u2014 with the\ninvitation what I received from my sister, I went to the police, as they told me,\nimmediately. But it\u2019s \u2014 if we will decide, it will go only to you, not \u2014 but not your\nwife. Because they knew we didn\u2019t have children. So \u2014",
        "A: Only in 1967 - 1968. It was a little bit \u2014 the worst years were in th \u2014 from 1949\ntil 1962 - \u201964. Di\u2014",
        "A: Especially the years from 1940 \u2014 19 \u2014 1955 - 1956.",
        "A: The Dub\u00e9ek came only nine \u2014 in the spring of 1968. Then we felt a little more\nbreeze about the more liberation [indecipherable] or so \u2014\n111April 14, 1997",
        "A: No, it was on the list because it was in August nine \u2014 no, in July 1968. So, if it\nwould be \u2014 actually, if it would be the \u2014 a year before, or two years before when it\nwas really the strict communist government, not Dub\u00e9ek, I hardly could get\npermission from the police to get out.",
        "A: I met her in nine \u2014 1n end of 1948.",
        "A: Bozena. My wife Bozena, her name was \u2014 maiden name was Shimkowa(ph).",
        "A: In October 1949.",
        "A: So, I dated her about a year, and I really liked her. I\u2014 even I was not so very\nyoung, but I fell in love because first of all I wa \u2014 I\u2014 she was very much interested\nin things like I was interested. For example, we would [indecipherable] talk, we\nwould like one day to travel, because I like to travel, and she had the same. And\nshe like very much art, culture, theaters, operas. And that was \u2014 I always liked and\njust I read some material about that. So we started \u2014 we started to gay \u2014 to go in\ntheaters to o \u2014 special an opera tim \u2014 ba-ballet together. And then we started \u2014 I\nbought a tent and [indecipherable] I think we were \u2014 we were dating already, that\nwe would like to ca \u2014 go camping. So that\u2019s what I started \u2014 we started to do that.\n112April 14, 1997\nAnd I saw that we have common interests. We started to go dancing, so \u2014 and then\nI \u2014 I mean, I saw that she\u2019s a very smart girl, nice. So I knew what kind of position\nhas, because she had the position that really was very capable to do this kind of\nwork. So \u2014 and I was by myself, by \u2014 actually not, my sister was still living there.\nSo that\u2019s when I married her.",
        "A: Yeah, for visiting? Yeah, I-I was \u2014 when I went to the United States, I was\ncertain that more, more, more, because the Dub\u00e9ek were in charge already that\nmany more they \u2014 the western countries will help Czechoslovakia to get more rid\nof the communist-like government, that it will be some imperialistic government,\nor more democratic government, so that I will come back. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t go to\nUnited States with this that I will stay here, because if it would be a year before, I\nwould do that, because I knew under communist that I-I would be glad to get rid\nof the communist government, but now, if starting in spring of 1968 it goes always\nfarther, farther, more liberalization, more democratic things started to come. So\neverybody thought it will finally get again a democratic Czechoslovak Republic.\nBut in \u2014 with th \u2014 in this time, and [indecipherable] in the United States, 1t was\nfor six weeks what I get the permission. That means the third or the second of\nSeptember I was supposed to go back, and that was even my airline ticket. But in\nthi-this time, end of August, the 21\u201c of August, I think, th \u2014 the communists, the\nApril 14, 1997\nRussian and the army from Hungary, from East Germany, from Romania, from\nPoland, occupied Czechoslovakia, so they closed the borders. So I was in the\nUnited States, my wife was actually over there. So, what I have to do? So \u2014 and\nmy wife was in this time in Yugoslavia, on vacation with her cousin, be a \u2014 with a\n10 years old boy. So, she immediate \u2014 when the Czechoslovakia occupied, so she\nimmediately went from Yugoslavia back to Czechoslovakia because the parents\nof the boy were afraid that \u2014 what\u2019s happened. So they \u2014 she went back to\nCzechoslovakia. I was in the United States, she was over there. And then when\nwhat\u2019s happened, so my relatives all, they told me look, we are going to the\nimmigration office. You will stay here, because what\u2019s happened there. We will\ndo everything possible that your wife will come here too. And then, because I told\nthem, I don\u2019t want to stay here if she is there, I am here. So my brother-in-law\nwent with me here in Detroit to the immigration office, and they told me \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nspeak English, so he was the interpreter. They told me yeah, we can make now\nbecause this situation is, it will be easier that I could stay here, and we will make\neverything possible if she can get out from Czechoslovakia, that she will receive\nimmediately visa. But we cannot guarantee how she will get out from there. So I\nsaid look, I will go back, I will do \u2014 if I will be there \u2014 because it ose \u2014 and they\nsaid don\u2019t worry, they will let her go as soon as we'll go to phone her, we will\nwrite her. She will get the permission, she will get out. And I said look, if the\n114April 14, 1997\nRussians are \u2014 if it would be a government under Dub\u00e9ek, it will be different, but\nthis is a government the Russians are there. And I know what it means to live\nunder communists. So never they would let her go \u2014 maybe after awhile or so.\nAnd I said, I cannot \u2014 I cannot stay here, I cannot let her there because she doesn\u2019t\nknow all those ways how to go sh \u2014 there. She has no experience in this kind of\nthing, and I have to go back. The-They were crying, they were bul \u2014 everything,\nmy relatives. And I went back. And when \u2014 interesting enough, one of my\nnephews \u2014 because I \u2014 one nephew, he had Bar Mitzvah in July here. So I was at\nthe \u2014 the other nephew, his Bar Mitzvah supposed to be in April next year. And he\nwas crying and crying, and said, Uncle Mitu(ph), you are here at the Bar Mitzvah\nfor Stanley, and you won\u2019t be here on my Bar Mitzvah, and I will \u2014 and I told\nhim, Irwin(ph), I promise you, I will do everything possible. When I will be there,\nI will make all the possible things \u2014 if I couldn\u2019t be here on your Bar Mitzvah, I\nwill be here with you on your wedding with your aunt, with my wife. I make this\nyour promise. And so I went back, but I couldn\u2019t go straight to Czechoslovakia,\nso I flew from here to Yugoslavia, because I had to change my airline ticket, and I\nwent to the place where my wife was on vacation, she wasn\u2019t there any more. So I\nwent back by train to Prague, and then I met my wife and saw \u2014 and I told her the\nstory and I said, I will try immediately I told her, I will try everything. We have to\ngo back and we have to go to America. We cannot stay because it will be a terror\n115April 14, 1997\nhere. So, she didn\u2019t want for, she was crying and so on. But then later on th \u2014 I\nwas working on her [indecipherable] and then she saw too what\u2019s going on, how\nit goes, the situation. So and then we made, sometimes in March, we start with a\nlittle more, not so strict like it was the first month. So we went to \u2014 to police, we\nask for a permission to go to Hungary for vacation. Yeah, when I came back,\npeople \u2014 friends what I met on the street, they didn\u2019t even greet me to welcome me\nor something. Everyone only showing knock on the head that I was so st \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t te \u2014 tell me anything, only to show me that I was stupid that I came back. So\nthen we was working in mat \u2014 thr \u2014 thr \u2014 again through ma \u2014 through this \u2014 her\nboss, and we get permission to go to Hungary because we had some friends. And\nthen we had to bribe 1n the bank, because you ca \u2014 to go to Yugoslavia. If you\nwanted to go to Yugoslavia, you had to get a permission from the bank, that the\nbank gave you currency, Yugoslavian currency, that you go to a vacation for\nYugoslavia. So that \u2014 we bribed some clerk in the bank, because it was always a\ncommittee who was deciding if they allowed you, if they give you the money,\nYugoslavian money that you go \u2014 can go to Yugoslavia. So that\u2019s what it\nhappened, I-I get the permission to go to yu \u2014 th-the money to go into Yugoslavia.\nSo I went again to the police, I had the permission to Yugoslavia, actually\n[indecipherable] needed. I get the permission there, because I had the per \u2014 the\nmoney from Yugoslavia. So I get the per-permission from the police that I can go.\n116April 14, 1997\nThey put up a\u2014 a stamp in my passport that I can go Yugoslavia. And then we\nhave to bribe someone on the police to a \u2014 a friend of mine. We gave money to\nhim, he gave some money to a policeman. So he gave permission to us that we can\ngo to Yugoslavia through Austria. And it was for 48 hours. And I had the cousin\nwho still lives in Czechoslovakia, in KoSice, and she told me that if I can get the\npermission to Austria, to Vienna, then I can go to HIAS, to a Hebrew\nimmigration office, and then I can stay and they take care of me to get out from\nEurope, anywhere. So that what we did to, what I\u2019m saying it\u2019s very simple, but it\ntook much of nerves, a lot of weeks, almost all our money what we got. It cost us\nmoney what we bribe. And it was nerve breaking til we get all those papers and\neverything. So only one cousin of my wife, and my cousin in KoSice, they knew\nthat we are preparing to leave. Even she told me my cousin in KoSice, as soon as\nwa \u2014 we were b \u2014 lucky and come to Vienna, that I have to write her, and they\nmay \u2014 they \u2014 they will make immediately steps that they will come after us to\nVienna. But in between this 1s a other story, her husband changed his mind, he\ndidn\u2019t want [indecipherable] this stay there. And he wa \u2014 he felt sorry til today\nfor visiting last few years them, he felt sorry all the time that he didn\u2019t came after\nus. Then when we \u2014 so we \u2014 yeah, and then it happened in May the 30\", 1940 \u2014\n1969, actually we left Czechoslovakia. And where we lived in the apar \u2014 I had a\ncar already. In this time I bought a car, 1t happens \u2014 this is other story, how it was\n117April 14, 1997\ndifficult. It was permission from the company, but we had the car. We had the \u2014\nwe had the application for a new car two years before, because it take always a\ncommittee who decided who will get the car, because it was har \u2014 very had to get\nthe car, a permission to buy a car, if you had the money. And you have \u2014 you had\nto put down 60 percent of the price of the car in a bank. It was blocked in a bank\nthat you had the money. So I had the car about for a year or so. That\u2019s about half\n[indecipherable] almost a new car. And so we were preparing, we \u2014 so I parked\nmy car in front of the building, it was on a main street. And the day before \u2014 and\nwe had all the permissions and everything. So a day before, to the evening, we\nstarted to take some stuff, what we will need for the vacation, and put in the car.\nBecause I had the garage, so we are leave the car over the ma \u2014 overnight in the\ngarage. And because we wanted to leave early in the morning, as soon as possible.\nSo \u2014 and then we \u2014 and I knew from the time when we came back from \u2014 when I\ncame back from America, special then in the months after new year, February,\nMarch, we were watching, again by the secret police. And then I was \u2014 when we\nwere taking down all the stuff into the car, and then not far away, maybe 60 or 70\nyards, it was a corner, a building, and there was a restaurant. And we saw that\nsome guy in rain clothes \u2014 in plain clothes that\u2019s \u2014 was go \u2014 walking around. And\nsometime he stopped there, reading a paper, went inside in the restaurant, and\nfrom the restaurant was a window straight to our apart \u2014 to the car where \u2014 where I\nApril 14, 1997\nwas parking. It was about 70 yards. And then again he came out, he ge \u2014 went\naround the corner, and again get the newspaper, and then to the restaurant. So we\nknew exactly, because we knew all those kind of things what they are doing\nbecause all the secret \u2014 so we knew immediately that someone 1s watching us. So\nif I describe you, or if you \u2014 I can\u2019t [indecipherable] it wasn\u2019t so smooth. I will\ntry to be really short. And around mor \u2014 in the morning, around 4:30 or five\no\u2019clock, it was May the 30\" or the 31\u2018 \u2014 the 31%, we left Liberec and went on the\nway to Hungary. So we stopped during the night in a little town \u2014 you stop? It\nthen \u2014 then it was Bratislava, it was on the border, actually on Czech and\nMoravia. And then we stopped during the night in a camp, to stay overnight. And\nthen [indecipherable] that we will go [indecipherable] so me, my wife \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nApril 14, 1997\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: So my wife was afraid to tell her mother that we are leaving, and that we are\ntrying not to come back, because she knew, and I knew too, that if she would tell\nher mother that she is not coming back, she would start to cry and to scream, and\nshe didn\u2019t \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t never let her go. So we di \u2014 she didn\u2019t tell her mother.\nWe stayed overnight in this camp. In the morning there was about a two hours\ndrive to Bratislava. There we stayed na \u2014 about a half a day. And then we went\nfrom Bratislava, it was very close, about maybe 10 or 15 kilometers to the border.\nAnd usually, at the border to the Hungary \u2014 to Hungary, it was you came to the\nborder, and the Slovaks took only the papers, you were straight on the road. There\nwas a -\u2014 there was a soldier who took the papers, identification, 1f you had\npermission, he let you go. But when we came to the stor \u2014 soldier, he took our\npapers and everything, showed the name, and suddenly he send us around, up to\nthe main building, where the customs were. So we knew immediately that\nsomething is not kosher. So we went there, and we saw when we were there the\nsoldier took our identification and then we thought that have to go up, we saw a\ncustom guy was standing in \u2014 at the door there. And came out a other custom and\n120April 14, 1997\nhe probably told him, because he showed downstairs, he said probably, those are\nthe people. We come upstairs and he took our papers, and \u2014 both of them, they\nwere standing \u2014 where are you going? And I said that we\u2019re going to Hungary,\nthat we\u2019re going to Yugoslavia, so on. And he said, you know what? Drove \u2014\ndrive your car behind the building. So I knew immediately it\u2019s not goo \u2014 good. So\nI drove the car behind the building. There was a \u2014 the long table, and he said okay,\nbut we would like to see what you have in your car. Take out everything from\nyour car. So we took out everything on the car, or took \u2014 or put on the table. And\nwe had our tent, we had [indecipherable], we had a stove, everything like we go\nfor vacation to \u2014 for camping. And what we had in suitcase, everything out. And\nthen he took out \u2014 and that car had the engine in the back, you know it was \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the trunk was in the front. So, he took the front \u2014 he took out our spare\ntire. They took \u2014 pull up the battery from the trunk. And it took about an hour, all\nthis checking and everything what they did. And people down on the road, other\npeople were traveling and they left. Everybody were looking up because they saw\nfrom \u2014 from the stree \u2014 from the road that we are standing, and customs are\nstanding there, and with all the stuff there. And can you imagine that where the\nglove department is, there was \u2014 I found out that was a little, like space. And it\ncome to my mind what I had at home with my prayer book. So \u2014 and I found out \u2014\nso there I hide some papers, what \u2014 her birth certificate, some other papers.\nApril 14, 1997\n[indecipherable] had a few krones(ph), some money and other documents what\nwe had, what we knew if they will find it, it\u2019s finished. They were let \u2014 they knew\nthat something is wrong, that we taking some money with us [indecipherable]\nbecause they checked our \u2014 our purses, our \u2014 our \u2014 my \u2014 my wife\u2019s purse and\neverything. So if they would find these kind of papers, what we \u2014 why I need\npapers, my documents, what I went to school, or when my wife \u2014 wife does \u2014 so\nthere I was hidden, but it was so narrow, that later on when I had to take it out, I\nscratched my hand, because it was very hard to take out. And they opened the\nglove department, they looked behind, but didn\u2019t realize, because it was something\nlike hidden, so they didn\u2019t see that this is \u2014 this 1s actually a \u2014 a secret space there.\nThis was \u2014 they were lucky. So after about an hour they didn\u2019t find \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nfind the space there. After about an hour or so, and even \u2014 you know I said it\u2019s \u2014 I\n\u2014 I have to \u2014 to mention, my wife used to make iyer(ph) cognac, natur \u2014 because\nshe liked it, so here and there she tried to st \u2014 you know what\u2019s iyer(ph) cognac 1s\nnow? This is a \u2014 a liqueur, this 1s made from eggs \u2014 eggs and liqueur, you know,\nand it\u2019s very \u2014 so sweet, you can hardly get drunk or so. And the oth \u2014 on the way,\nshe usually lit \u2014 taked a \u2014 from the \u2014 from the bottle, a taste, and til we came there\nto the customs, she was a \u2014 a little so in good mood, you know. And suddenly\nwhen it was all over with the checking [indecipherable] everything was outside,\nand suddenly she stepped like this and she said, gentlemen, could you tell me\n122April 14, 1997\nplease, what are you looking for? Maybe I can help you. And I said, be quiet. We\ndon\u2019t be th \u2014 nasty to gen \u2014 because I saw that they \u2014 they were a little so \u2014 not so\n\u2014 so straight, like they were before when the \u2014 they were so strict, they were\ntalking to us like we were some robberies or something, or criminals. And then in\nto the end, after an hour, both of them were so \u2014 a little softer. And I told her\n[indecipherable] quiet, don\u2019t \u2014 and okay, so \u2014 and she says so, can I put back the\n\u2014 yeah, you can. So okay, so [indecipherable] and so she started slowly with here,\nand I said, take everything through it in. If they would let us go, we will be \u2014 as\nsoon as we can be away from it better. Okay, then I help her, we started to threw it\nonly in the car and everything. And then they told us, come \u2014 come with the car in\nthe front of the building, stop there. Because they had all the papers, everything.\nSo, I stopped there and so they let you go, but then he stopped, and I said okay.\nThey gave the papers, and I said, you know when \u2014 and when you went from\nCzechoslovakia, you had to fill out a piece of paper, what you are taking out. And\nthen you had to show on the border when you come back, if you brought it \u2014\neverything back and what you brought back. And I said, but yo \u2014 I have the\npassport and the papers, I don\u2019t have the paper what it says when I come back and\nshow the \u2014 the \u2014 for the customs what I took out and what took back. And he says,\nI gave it to you. And I said, but I don\u2019t have here. Yeah, and th \u2014 and then my wife\nsays, oh, maybe yeah, I think I have here between the papers, I have it. So \u2014 and I\n123April 14, 1997\nsaid, because we have to \u2014 and I told them even, I \u2014 we have to be back because\nmy wife has some examinations, she went to \u2014 to a college school and took\ncourses, she took \u2014 and I said, three days later she had the examinations, so we\nhave to bring back, and I don\u2019t want to have some troubles when I come back. I\ngave it to your wife. Again. Well, she says, maybe I as \u2014 my wife said, maybe I\nhave here. So we went, we came, yeah, and we stayed there on our seaside \u2014 not\nseaside, it was a big lake where we have friends who usually we stayed o \u2014 for\nvacations every year. So we thought we will stay there for a week or 10 days with\nthem. So we stopped there, and we say we are going to Yugoslavia and we will\nstay for a few days. Who said \u2014 and the la \u2014 the \u2014 our friend says oh, that\u2019s good,\ngood, good, we\u2019ll stay \u2014 and then during the night I couldn\u2019t sleep, it was from\nSaturday to Sunday, I remember like today. And I said, you know what \u2014 I told my\nwife, I think so \u2014 I would stay not one more day, because if they made those\nsearch on the border, they immediately sent a cable to Liberec that we went to the\ngi \u2014 border, they let us. And if we will stay in Hungary, this 1s still a communist\ncountry, they can make immediately there\u2019s a stop in Hungary, and they send us\nback. And I said, today is Sunday, they \u2014 the office is in Liberec closed. So better\nif as soon as we'll go away \u2014 okay, my wife didn\u2019t want to, so [indecipherable]\nsays, that\u2019s okay, we go. So I turned to my friend, listen, you know we wanted\nbetter we will stop more days in Yugoslavia, and then we will come back sooner,\n124April 14, 1997\nwe will stay with you when we come back, because it doesn\u2019t say that \u2014 we want\nso \u2014 at least two or three days or so, and I says no, we better because they said it\u2019s\na nice weather there in yugo \u2014 okay, so we went. We came to the border on\nHungary and Yugoslavia. They stopped us, they told us the Hungarian customs,\nwait in the car. So we wait in the car. We wait five minute, 10 minutes, 15 minutes\nlong, nobody came out. So then I said oh, this is not good. And I said because\nmaybe from Bratislava they sent a message to the Hungarian border to stop us\nand to check us. So it took about 20 minutes. Other people were coming down,\nother customs let them go, only to [indecipherable] and us they st \u2014 we were\nsitting in the car from 20 minutes. And then suddenly they came out, they pull up\nthe hood, they pull up the hood for the engine, they pull up the hood from the\ntrunk. And there were \u2014 in front of us was a boss, you know people were standing,\ncame around, people standing around, you know, they were nose \u2014 no \u2014 no \u2014\nmousey \u2014 nosey to see what\u2019s going on. So it took about five, 10 minute here. He\ntook everything back up, something he took out, then put back, you know the\nHungarian customs. Then said \u2014 take the steps. Okay, you can go. We can \u2014 and\nimmediately was the border, it was only a small river, a bridge. We came \u2014\nimmediately was the Yugoslavian customs. Came to Yugoslavian customs, I show\nthem the paper, open the window. Immediately, okay, you taking, what you are\ngoing, for how long, I said oh, he gave the stamp. We left . Well, we came to\n125April 14, 1997\nYugoslavia, so we went to the seaside, about \u2014 and we thought that we will stay\nthere til we will go to Austria, we will stay about for a few days, a little, to relax.",
        "A: No, it was very close to dubr \u2014 yeah, th-the \u2014 next to the \u2014 between dubr \u2014\nDubrovnik and Split. And then we stayed about for three, four days in a camp,\nand I said to my wife, you know, I am so nervous. Better if here the opportunity\ncome, we will go to Vienna, to Austria. We will see what happen maybe there we\nwill go. And then my wife said okay, because she saw in everything what was\ngoing on, all these borders. And I still \u2014 I said I didn\u2019t even trust \u2014 I didn\u2019t trust the\nSlovaks, I didn\u2019t trust the Hungarian, and you know what? I don\u2019t even trust\nYugoslavian. Ega \u2014 even Yugoslavia, it was in even this time more liberal and\nmany people escape after the Russian came into Yugoslavia from\nCzechoslovakia. So okay, we went, immediately we went to Austria, we came to\nthe Yugoslavian side on the border. They \u2014 after \u2014 w-we stayed about four days\nthere in Yugoslavia. They gave us the stamp only through the window, I didn\u2019t\nhave even to get out. Then we came to the Austrian side, they pull up the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe thing to \u2014 on the border what they have there, you know \u2014",
        "A: The barrier and they \u2014 only there came the Austrian soldier or custom, I don\u2019t\nremember. And he want the passport, he wanted the visa. And \u2014 and you know\n126April 14, 1997\nwhat he wanted? He wanted the international insurance of my car. So that\u2019s \u2014 I sh-\nshow him I had, and then he let us immediately go. I cannot express what I said on\nthe tape, what my expression was. If you can stop for a moment.",
        "A: And I told to my wife, you heard the big jump, the big noise [indecipherable]\nand I \u2014 she says, no, and says, what happened? How a big stone fell from my\nheart. And I said, now even President Husak can lick my behind. So \u2014 because\nnow we are finally in a free country, and we are free. Can you \u2014 and I started to\ncry, you know, I started to cry. So that \u2014 that was a so \u2014 then, we came to Vienna,\nit was sometime late in the evening, and it \u2014 the next day it was a holiday in \u2014 in\nthe Austria. So we stayed in a camp. The next day we went immediately in the\nmorning to HIAS, and I registered, and then was \u2014 I spoke German. And then was\non HIAS in the office a woman, make a registration, and so on. And I had my\npapers, I took out my birth certificate and so on. And he was still proof if I am\nreally Jewish. And he said \u2014 he asked me the question, so if you are Jewish, where\nis the \u2014 what 1s the highest holiday in our religion? I said, Yom Kippur. And I\nsaid, you know what? When I got up in the morning, you know what was my first\nword \u2014 word? [speaks Hebrew here]. You know what it means, that translation?\nThank you God \u2014 God upstairs hermelek(ph), the king of all the holy works, and\nso on. And I said, do you believe me? I \u2014 I didn\u2019t talk about the pull down the\n127April 14, 1997\npants. Yeah, so \u2014 and the women \u2014 we were laughing. She says, yeah, yeah. And\nshe says, don\u2019t be mad, because we had, after the Russian came in, we had many\npeople, Christian who came here and they said that they are Jews, because they\nknew that the Jewish organizations take more care of them than the Christians in\ntheir o-organizations, you know, the Catholics and all these organizations. Say,\nChristians came and they had \u2014 and the woman told me, we had many occasions\nthat Christians came to us, and we had to send them, give them the address we\nhad, the Catholic organizations. So \u2014 and we stayed there, but now you could see\nin Vienna, people who were escaping from Czechoslovakia. Left cars on the\nstreet, left cars on the airport, because they couldn\u2019t sell. Everybody was glad to\nget rid, because they \u2014 as soon as they get permission go to Canada, to Australia,\nto Sweden, to America immediately. They di \u2014 they left everything there. And I\nhad almost a new car, so \u2014 and I told this guy who asked me about the high\nholidays, you know, I said, do you know what? I have almost a new car, and I\nwould like to get some money, because we don\u2019t have money, we don\u2019t have\ncurrency, nothing. If someone would give me some few shillings, some few\nhundreds, or some dollars or so. He says, you know what? I have a friend, he has a\ndealership, maybe he will buy because he\u2019s a Czechoslovak guy and sells\nCzechoslovak cars, wa \u2014 running, because Czechoslovakia was exporting some\ncars to Austria. So I went there, yeah, we stayed there in \u2014 in the \u2014 yeah, and they\n128April 14, 1997\nga-gave us a address where we can go to stay a few nights til we\u2019re \u2014 that\ntransport, because they started to, in this time were people, many people came\nfrom Hungary, from Czechoslovakia, from Poland, many people. So they made\nalways a transport train \u2014 car, went straight to Rome, because in Rome, the HIAS\nwas the main concentration, the main office. So after a \u2014 the second or third day he\ntold me, you know what? Go show \u2014 there he gave me the address. Show the car,\nhe probably will buy from you. So I went there, he liked the car, so he \u2014 he bought\nthe car. So at least I didn\u2019t have to leave the car. He gave me, I don\u2019t know how\nmany hundred dollars. So at least we had [indecipherable] some money. And I\nleft the car with everything there, so I said, at least something. And then, usually\nafter three or four days they make \u2014 they had the \u2014 had th-the 30 or 40 people,\nsome a\u2014 sometimes even 70 people, so they made two rail cars, and send to\nVienna. And \u2014 yo, and everybody has to go immediately, HIAS sent you to a\ndoctor, he was a Jewish doctor, originally from Poland, but he lived in Austria\nfor many years already, like for a check-up if you are capable, if you are able to go\nto take the [indecipherable] to go, or [indecipherable] to go to Rome. And we\nwent there, and I started to tell him a little bit the story, what I went through, the\nfew days. And I said, you know doctor, I\u2019ve ba \u2014 ba \u2014 ap \u2014 appealed to you. We \u2014\nmy wife is not so healthy and I \u2014 you know, always this nervous break, what was.\nIf you can give her some medication and to check her up more and after three or\n129April 14, 1997\nfour days, if something really was happened, because she has kidney problems \u2014\nproblems, and it was true. And he told he \u2014 he started to talk to my Yiddish. And\nhe says, in Yiddish, you know, tell me the truth, Vienna is a nice city. Probably\nyou want to stay to see the city. And I telled him, you know what, it\u2019s one of the\nreasons too. A-And he said, you know what? I give you, you will stay two weeks\nin Vienna. Stay, but you know, and I thought to my wife \u2014 to myself, better to tell\nthe truth straight and what happens, happen. And he \u2014 then he told me, you know,\nI like you because you told me that you liked to stay in Vienna. So then we \u2014 we\nstayed in Vienna for two weeks, so we looked a little, and at least it helped us,\nspecial me, get a little \u2014 a normal feeling, a normal life, because no \u2014 otherwise, I\nwas on the bottom, really. I was completely eshi \u2014 exhausted \u2014 exhausted. So then\nwe stayed there, and then we, after two weeks they send us to \u2014 to Rome. There\nwe registered in the HIAS, and immediately \u2014 1t was very good organized there,\nand immediately they gave us \u2014 because in Rome there were all over signs that\nsay, lease apartments, special for refugees becal \u2014 twas meant \u2014 so, we took out an\napartment. And the hia \u2014 HIAS, actually Joint, gave the money that what we paid\nfor the rent, and they gave some pocket money that you can buy some food or\nsomething, minimum, but it was enough. And after three months or so, because\nwhen I went in Czechoslovakia gymnasium, I learned Latin, we had the subject\nLatin. So after three months I started to speak Italian. So then was the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n130April 14, 1997\npresident in HIAS was a Romanian woman who spoke \u2014 spoke Hungarian. And\nthen as \u2014 she saw that I spoke Italian, I spoke Hungarian, and I spoke Polish, and I\nspoke Russian, I spoke Czech. So \u2014 and the other woman my \u2014 my \u2014 who was in\ncharge, my caseworker, she was a Romanian too, and she spoke \u2014 spoke\nHungarian too. So said one thing to other, and I talked to them, so they hired me\nthat I was a interpreter in HIAS for all those people, because many people came,\nspecial from Poland, from Hungary, from Romania. So I was working one year\napproximately on HIAS like a interpreter. So, me, my wife actually stayed in\nRome 15 months. And between this time it helped a lot, because we received\nmoney like refugees, like everybody else. And beside that, Joint paid me like a\nemployee on HIAS. So we started to travel a little bit in Italy, and I spoke Italian.\nSo actually in \u2014 was in \u2014 my job was there. At least once a week, sometimes twice\na week, I went to the railroad station in Rome every \u2014 1n the morning, around\neight o\u2019clock in the morning. And always came one railroad car, or two cars, it\ndepends how many people came. And in ad \u2014 in advance, I had all the names who\nis coming, how many people. And I have to tell you, I \u2014 some Italian police were\naccompanying each car from the border to Rome, that nobody can come in in\nthose car. No Italian police to check if regular or not. And when they came to\nRome to me at those stations, they knew me already, all those people. I\n[inaudible] have to tell you, I gave them money, because I had \u2014 I \u2014 I had the\nApril 14, 1997\nenvelope from the Joint, from \u2014 I gave the two guys envelope and I told them \u2014\nthey told me, buongiorno Mikula, buongiorno. A come sta, how you feel and so\non. I said, buongiorno signore, I gave them the envelope, arrivederci. And that\u2019s\nwas I took over all the people I took them to HIAS for registration. There they get\nall \u2014 they received all the instruction farther, and then I was working\n[indecipherable] people to give adva \u2014 adva \u2014 advice, to help them what I have to\ndo. And then I took all the pa \u2014 what someone had introduce on different\nconsulates, you know for the visas or so on. So I went with them to interpret on\nthe \u2014 on the consulate because I spoke Italian there. And then I took all the\npassports, and all papers, translation, everything, to all those consulates for what \u2014\nfor \u2014 for verification, because usually they get permission, the Italian government\ngave permission for refugees for three months. Who stayed longer, I had to go to\nthe police, I had to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get permission. So\nthat\u2019s what I did for HIAS, what I went then \u2014 and then all the transport, what all\nthey sent for example, many people to Canada or to us, or I accompanied these\npeople to the airport. And sometimes people came illegally to \u2014 they send them\nfrom Belgrade or from Bucharest. So I went to the airport, I took over those\npeople and took to the \u2014 not to the e-exit with other people, but to the \u2014 to the\nItalian police, you know, to the commandant of the airport. And he knew\neverything, so he gave the permission, and then when I took them to HIAS, you\n132April 14, 1997\nknow, because those people didn\u2019t have visas. So that\u2019s what I \u2014 I did. I did a lot\nof this kind of things what helped people actually to come to Italy and then to help\nthem to \u2014 to make translation, that \u2014 like a [indecipherable] a translator to them,\neven privately with the \u2014 with the \u2014 when they were looking for apartments, and so\non. So I was busy enough, but during the weekend I could go out, so I can relax a\nlittle bit, so that\u2019s \u2014 we stayed there.",
        "A: I\u2014I might even remember all these details and everything, but \u2014",
        "A: I went, and in the begin \u2014 the first year, you know, this prayer book, the \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know what\u2019s happened, because maybe the \u2014 if something \u2014 because yeah,\nall the furniture, all the clothing, everything what we \u2014 when we left\nCzechoslovakia we had to leave there, and the government took it over. Even they\ngave it to someone or someone \u2014 someone bought it. So an \u2014 for example, it was \u2014\nand they took here and we \u2014 we were \u2014 after awhile when they saw that they \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t came back, they sentenced us, me and my wife to two years in prison in ab\n\u2014 in absentia, because we left illegally. So that means if we would go back during\nthose period, there it was the communist, first we will go in jail, maybe they will\n133April 14, 1997\nfor two years, maybe th \u2014 even more. So when they started to liquidate \u2014 before\nthey started liquidate all our furnitures, and everything, so my wife\u2019s mother went\nto the police. She wanted to get at least the couch what we had. She had to buy it,\nand it took her a lot of work. She get, and she had to pay the police to get the\ncouch what belongs to her daughter. So she has \u2014 I told her \u2014 later she had enough\nguts even to go to the police, first of all. So then the first \u2014 the first \u2014 1946 - \u00b047, I\nused to go to a shul in Liberec. It was a small minyan, few Jews. But then when,\nspecial from 1948, it was very dangerous to show that you are religious, or you are\nkeeping the \u2014 the \u2014 your faith, special Jewish faith. Even Christians, Christians\nwere, under communism, were afraid to go to a church. They didn\u2019t go, even they\nwere religious. So then \u2014 and when I came back, in 1991, after 22 years, to\nCzechoslovakia, and I went to Liberec \u2014 so the first thing Friday evening I went \u2014\nbecause I have a friend of mine, a Jewish guy who lived there, and I ask him, do\nyou still have prayer, do you have some Jews here and so on. He says, hardly we\nmake a minyan on Friday evening. So I said, I-I came there, and I came there\nFriday evening and made the minyan til we were about 10 or 11 people with \u2014\nincluding me. And later \u2014 so then \u2014 oh, and this time was more, the later and later\nyears, in 1933 - \u00b034, it was hardly a minyan. So and some people told me, you\nknow, I remember when I had about, in 1946 \u2014 \u201947 a old guy, so I remember you\nused to come, and so on. And then later on they had very few re \u2014 Jews. And then\n134April 14, 1997\nthey came, for example, for the high holidays, they came Jews from cities or from\nvillages who were about 10 - 20 miles away from Michalovee, so they came for\nthe high holidays [indecipherable] little like one room what they have there.\nFrom somewhere they get a Sefer Torah and a \u2014 all. And \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. And then he says, for example, even Friday evening when they don\u2019t\nhave a minyan, so they pray even eight or nine people, and they have sa \u2014 two or\nthree women, so said, we take the women like a minyan. And then 1-in last few\nyears, I was there last time about two years ago, yeah, two years ago, because I\nwent every year there, Friday. And then later years I gave him I \u2014 a sum of money,\nI spent them some \u2014 left them some dollars to help him. And they were very\ngrateful always. And now finally they\u2019re \u2014 after \u2014 after 1990, when it was [break]\nIn 1991, there in Liberec [indecipherable] the whole house, so there was some\napartments. Upstairs they were renting it. Downstairs, they had two rooms with\neverything, with Torahs and everything, with some curtains. And now, after about\ntwo or three years ago, they decided, and there in Liberec, where the German\n1938 on Kristallnacht, they destroyed a beautiful, beautiful, nice, big synagogue,\nthey \u2014 the Czechoslovak government and the Jewish organizations from Prague\ngave some money, and they are starting, I think, last year to build so-called library.\nBut the main part of the library will be a Jewish synagogue with everything like a\n135April 14, 1997\nnormal synagogue. Two years ago I say \u2014 I-I \u2014 they showed me the whole plan,\neven they have in \u2014 on tapes, pictures how the building will \u2014 will look, and it will\nbe a bi \u2014 because now it is there a parking lot. So on the same place where the \u2014 a\nst \u2014 beautiful, in the center of the city, next to the big theater, and t-to city hall,\nactually, behind the corner, there will be built a new \u2014 a li\u2014 a new, big library, but\nthe main part will be a beautiful, nice synagogue. So I am looking forward next \u2014\nno, this year in \u2014 in September, I am going there, so \u2014 to Liberec so \u2014 because I\nwill be in Prague and I will be staying in a spa. We are going there almost every\nyear, there 1s a spa not far from Liberec, about 15 miles. It\u2019s for arthritis and it\nhelps us, so there we are going every year. So I will go there, I will talk to my\nfriend, and I'll look how far, what this \u2014 because last year I couldn\u2019t go there, I \u2014\neven I was in the Czech Republic, but wait, I was there? Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, but\nit wasn\u2019t started yet, so I hope that started. And even he called me last year, and\nthey received a van, because they have like a small community there now, about\n15 people, about eight or nine families who live there. And they received a van, a\nused van from Germany, but they didn\u2019t have papers. So one day he wro-wro \u2014\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 he wrote me a letter that if a \u2014 if I can ge \u2014 get someone papers from\nhere, from General Motors, because it was a General Motors van, because\notherwise the police in Liberec, they couldn\u2019t get Czechoslovak papers for the va-\nvan because it was a present and they don\u2019t have the papers. So I called General\n136April 14, 1997\nMotors here. General Motors send me in Canada \u2014 what 1s the city, where they \u2014\nthey have a department on the foreign cars and the foreign \u2014 no. One moment\n[indecipherable] they had th-the foreign representative, what is for Europe\nrepresentative, so gave me \u2014 they gave me \u2014 they \u2014 in Czechoslovakia they gave\nme his address \u2014 the address of this office, they gave me the phone number, and I\ncalled him up, that it will be done fast. I called him up, I gave him all the\ninformation. That\u2019s what I did, and they received the papers, they received the\nvan.",
        "A: Wedding.",
        "A: It was a\u2014 you cannot imagine. We were crying, we were glad. And you know,\nit was a disadvantage because I didn\u2019t speak the language. So, with the sisters I\ncan speak Slovak or Hungarian, but all those there \u2014 all those nieces and nephews,\nthey were children. They didn\u2019t speak, so I had to have always a \u2014 a translator.\nAnd it was funny enough, it was \u2014 it was a joy, you know. They started to learn\nthe \u2014 the Hungarian words, some Slovak words. So they we-were communicating.\nAnd I have really a very \u2014 very nice pictures from that.\n137April 14, 1997",
        "A: Oh, they knew ma \u2014 very, very much so.",
        "A: Very, very \u2014 we didn\u2019t like to talk even today about that. So, if we \u2014 if we don\u2019t\n\u2014 if we don\u2019t have to, here and there, it reminds us what happened, certainly, but it\n\u2014 not to send it that\u2019s in \u2014 that\u2019s all.",
        "A: No, only this woman what I showed you. And I talk here about it to schools,\nthey called me, you know, we have \u2014 we have some woman in our shul, 1n our\nsynagogue who is a teacher, so she called me, and I talked to children there.",
        "A: In the \u2014 1n a Christian sc \u2014 1n the school. In the school.",
        "A: Yeah, from Adat Shalom.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She 1s a teacher there in a \u2014 what \u2014 I think her \u2014 she must teach herself part-\ntime. Her name is Handelman. What is her first name? Nancy. Nancy\nHandelman.\n138April 14, 1997",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh they know very much, oh yeah. They \u2014 they were \u2014 because their parents\ntold them.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: You know it\u2019s happened, I just told that the day before yesterday, my wife, just\nlast week I was again in Europe and I was in Germany. But, I was not this kind\nof Germany, it was like after the war Germany. And I said \u2014 and I woke up that I\nwas afraid that I thought some hakenkreuzer(ph) somewhere. And that\u2019s was all,\nbut it was a \u2014 were only a few days ago, but for years I didn\u2019t have\n139April 14, 1997\n[indecipherable] you know. I had many some years ago, or maybe a year or so,\nthat I was under communists in Czechoslovakia, that I had some dream, that I \u2014\nwe went \u2014 we went [indecipherable] for vacation, suddenly it was communism.\nBut \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, those \u2014 these come more often.",
        "A: The \u2014 how it was. For example, a \u2014 for example a wa \u2014 how it was actually,\nhow come that when I was working for example, between two groups til I get two\ngroups, and it tooks me a few days and in wintertime, just few days in winter\nreminds me that I went in so deep snow and helped the guy where I was staying\nwith him to go to the forest and make wood, you know, how you call \u2014",
        "A: Chop wood, yeah. Just came few days there to my mind in a deep snow in\nJanuary. So \u2014",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] few days I left. So \u2014 but not so often, here and there.\nFor example I was working for \u2014 a few days ago on a movie. I was looking \u2014 oha\nfew days ago when they \u2014 they repeat \u201cSchindler List,\u201d so I was watching it. My\nwife wouldn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to watch it a second time.\n140April 14, 1997",
        "A: Oh yes. So it comes in many times, but experiences what you cannot forget,\nand like I said many times, and I saw people that are not satisfied, that\u2019s this and\nthis. And I said to her, first of all, ye \u2014 all what I met here 1 \u2014 one thing 1s the best\n\u2014 not what I met, what I\u2019m say \u2014 telling them, this is the wa \u2014 the best country in\nthe world and I\u2019m [indecipherable] people, they don\u2019t appreciate enough that \u2014\nthey don\u2019t appreciate enough, they don\u2019t realize what country they were born, or\nwa \u2014 which country they are living. They have the opportunity to live in a country\nlike United States. And I said, and I \u2014 something and someone [indecipherable]\nand I said, you know what? Thanks God, every morning I said thanks God, one\nmore day alive. And if someone would tell me 1944 \u2014 \u201942 - \u00b043, that I will be one\nday 30 years old, I would tell him he is crazy, because I was looking if next hour I\nwill be still alive, not what will be in a few years. So I \u2014 and I talk to my wife, and\nshe knows that, hear me tell all this, the whole, the \u2014 the main thing, to be healthy,\nto take the life like 1t goes and take advantage as much as possible, and live your\nnormal life and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: And travel. Oh, that\u2019s what \u2014 we like to travel, we like to go to \u2014 not \u2014 not too\nmuch to movies, but to operas, to \u2014 to ballet, we still are going even now, here and\nthere, to Masonic Temple, to Fox theater. And \u2014 and museums. Every year, at\n141April 14, 1997\nleast once a year we are going here in Detroit to the art museum. At least once a\nyear we are going to the zoo. And where we just went last month, I don\u2019t know I\nmentioned you, it was a \u2014 actually a organin \u2014 the \u2014 our sisterhood from our shul\norganized to go to the historical museum here in Detroit. There is \u2014 there was a\nexhibit, how the people came to United States from est \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many\ncenturies back \u2014",
        "A: And the immigration. So that\u2019s \u2014 we went there because it was very interested \u2014\nvery interesting. And I saw there people who came to this country are the people\nwho live, for example, mostly from Poland, even they showed them some from\nCzechoslovakia, and from Hungary. Really they showed how the people lived\nthere and I \u2014 so I closed my eyes and I saw my li \u2014 how I lived at home in\nCzechoslovakia before the war. That\u2019s what they showed us there. So it was very\nentertaining, we were very glad that we enter. And now we are going, next week\nwe are going to the art museum again, because here is a exhibit about the 1 \u2014 ivory\nexhibit there, and very [indecipherable] very nice. And be wi \u2014 this time we took\na \u2014 a walk, even we had there many times, a little there. We like paintings that we\nare going in next month for three weeks with elder hostel to Spain, to Barcelona\nand Madrid, because the subject is European painting, Spanish painting and all\nthose things. So we are [indecipherable] every morning is some discussions, or\n142April 14, 1997\nsome explanation from some professionals. And then we are visiting museums, so\nthat\u2019s what we like, and that\u2019s what we spend the money, as long as we have.",
        "A: In September.",
        "A: No. No, no. We are traveling a lot, so we have many times free tickets. We will\nhave \u2014 we will have four \u2014 to \u2014 not to Spain, but where we go to \u2014 September to\nCzechoslovakia, we will have the fourth time, free tickets to Europe. Fourth time.\nThe third time with \u2014 the third time with Northwest, and before \u2014 no, the second\ntime with Northwest. Before \u2014 last year or year before we had Delta, and the first\ntime we had years ago with pa \u2014 what does \u2014",
        "A: Probably it\u2019s Pan-American. And maybe they give too mu \u2014 and we didn\u2019t\nneed so many miles like we need today, maybe that\u2019s why they went bankrupt.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 two years ago, even we paid the money to go to Washington, it was a\ngroup from Temple Israel. And we came to the airport and we couldn\u2019t go\nbecause something was wrong with the plane, so we had to go back there, and we\ngot refi \u2014 refunds for the money, and for \u2014 but, we are planning to go. But we are\non the way to go even with my sister. You know, we were \u2014\n143April 14, 1997",
        "A: Yeah, she were in the same group and with my niece, her daughter. And we\nhad to come back because something was wrong with the planes, they couldn\u2019t fix\nit. So went back [indecipherable]",
        "A: I thought my \u2014 my nephew when he was at his wedding, that I kept my\npromise, that really I came to his wedding. Yeah, I me \u2014 I think I told that where\nhe \u2014 and I came the the first time, he po \u2014 took out from the freezer from his Bar\nMitzvah cake.",
        "A: Yeah, when I came the first time, when I came to United States, the first thing\nwhen I came to their house and he didn\u2019t tell me anything. Suddenly he went to\nthe freezer there and took out a big piece of cake, it was from him, and he said,\nUncle Mitu(ph) here I kept it by the freezer that \u2014 for you and your wife, for\nBozena, a piece of my Bar Mitzvah cake. And I said, you see, when I had the\nwedding and I told his wife and him that I kept my promise, that I was here with\nmy wife, with his aunt on his wedding.\nEnd of Tape Five\n"
