        "Q: The date is June 2, 1992. We\u2019re speaking with Mr. Philip Goldstein. Mr.\nGoldstein, could you please tell me your name and what you were called during\nthe war, your date of birth, your place of birth and then anything you possibly can\nabout your childhood, growing up in Poland.",
        "A: I am Philip Goldstein, formerly Fishel Goldstein, born in Radom, Poland on\nJanuary 12, 1922. I was the youngest of five children, four brothers and one\nsister, born to a family of artisans. My father was a custom tailor, his brother was\na furrier, his father, uncles and cousins were furriers. I started parochial school\nwhen I was about three years old. While accompanying my mother, who took\nlunch to my brothers in cheder, I didn\u2019t want to go home, and that\u2019s how my\nparochial education started.",
        "Q: Would that be a yeshiva?",
        "A: No, no .A cheder. At the age of about six or seven, I entered a Jewish secular\nschool which had a double curriculum, a complete Polish curriculum plus a Judaic\ncurriculum of Hebrew, Yiddish, the Pentateuch, Rashi, Jewish history and so on.\nI was there up to the age of ten when I entered a Polish public school for Jewish\nchildren. I graduated at fourteen, which was the end of compulsory education\nunder the Polish school system. At that age I started to work as an apprentice in\nmy father\u2019s tailor shop. My heart was not in it, for I would rather spend my time\nreading books, and I did spend a lot of time reading in the beautiful park we had\nin the city of Radom. My sister had her own dressmaking shop and my oldest\nbrother worked for my father. My father also employed a journeyman in addition\nto myself as an apprentice. The next brother was a printer; he was an active\nmember and leader in the Zionist movement, Hashomer Hatzair, in Radom. At\nthe age of 20, he left Radom and went to Kibbutz Hachshara, which was the\npreparation for kibbutz life in Palestine.",
        "Q: Was your father religious though?",
        "A: The parents were religious. My mother was very religious. My father was\nreligious in the sense that he prayed every day and went to Sabbath services at his\ncongregation and so on, but that was the extent of his religious practices. He was\nobservant; the children were not. We were all secularly inclined. However, we\nfollowed our father to services on high holidays, and I did carry his tallith to the\n1\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncongregation every Saturday until I was about 12 years or 13. That was about the\nend of it. After my Bar Mitzvah, my religious education came to an end.",
        "Q: Well, you had a kosher home?",
        "A: Oh, yes. You hardly found any Jewish homes that weren\u2019t kosher. That was part\nof a way of life. We never ate out. Even though our city was fairly sizeable for\nPoland, having about 100,000 people, and a varied industrial base, nevertheless,\nthe idea of eating out was not a way of life as we knew it in the West. I left my\nhometown at the age of 20 when I was taken to Auschwitz, and up to that time I\nhad never eaten out in a restaurant. We had eaten out at parties, at other people\u2019s\nhomes, but never at a restaurant. My next brother was employed in a commercial\nestablishment. He was the only one who, at the end of 1939, escaped to the\neastern part of Poland, which was occupied by the Soviets.\nMy mother was the oldest in a family of eight children and my father was the\nsecond in line in a family of six children. All together, our family consisted of, in\naddition to our own household, of eleven households, with eleven uncles and\naunts, their respective spouses and with 25 first cousins. One of my mother\u2019s\nbrothers lived in the U.S.A. since the 1920\u2019s. Of the entire family in Europe, only\nthree first cousins survived, and all three came from the same household. Of the\nremaining ten households, not a trace was left. From our own household, in\naddition to myself, my brother, who spent most of the war years in the gulag, in\nthe Artic, returned after the war. He lives in Europe now.",
        "Q: What did you do -- did you have any other interests? You were involved in the\nZionist movement? Did you have any hobbies?",
        "A: Yes, yes. My brother was one of the leaders in the Zionist youth movement. I\njoined this group when I was about ten years old. My chief hobby, from very\nearly on, was reading. We had a very extensive library, the second largest in\ntown, which was a part of our organization. It was called the I.L. Peretz Library\nand I exchanged books there every time that the library was open, which was\nthree or four times a week. I stayed up reading to the early hours and used a\nkerosene lamp or candle instead of the ceiling light so as not to disturb my two\nbrothers who slept in the same room.",
        "Q: Were these mostly Yiddish books?",
        "A: No, mostly Polish, some were Yiddish. I preferred reading in Polish, but I was\narticulate in Yiddish as well; however, there weren\u2019t as many Yiddish books to\nchoose from. We read mostly Polish, but our spoken language was mostly\nYiddish. Yiddish was a living medium then, and not the linguistic curiosity to\nwhich it has been reduced in our day.\n2\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Would it be Polish literature or other literature in translation or Jewish books in\ntranslation or what?",
        "A: Well, you could get everything you wanted. I read mostly Polish translations of\nFrench, German, Russian and American literature, as well as some Polish and\nYiddish works in the original.\nIn 1939, at the outbreak of the war, my older brother, Moshe, was mobilized.\nSince he had served in the Polish army and was released in March of 1939, he\nwas subject to the general mobilization. He reported to his regiment and was\nlucky that he didn\u2019t become a POW. He was able to escape capture as a POW\nand return home six weeks after he left. Of course, we didn\u2019t know what had\nhappened to him throughout this period. Subsequently, he had become a very\nactive member in the underground Hashomer Hatzair movement in Radom, and\nour home became the contact place for couriers from Moscow. Polish ladies, as\nwell as members of the Hashomer Hatzair leadership in Warsaw, came. Mordecai\nAnielewicz, the leader of the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto, who perished in\n1943, was our guest during the first and second Passover seder in 1941. He\nstayed in a furnished room establishment in our courtyard during a mission to\nRadom, having traveled on Polish papers from Warsaw via Lodz and\nCzestochowa. He didn\u2019t look Jewish and had no trouble traveling on Polish\npapers. While in Auschwitz, I didn\u2019t know who was in the leadership of the\nWarsaw Ghetto uprising. Even those rounded up from the ruins of the Warsaw\nGhetto, who came to Auschwitz-Birkenau via Majdanek in the early summer of\n1943, had no idea of who was in the leadership. It was only after the war when I\ncame across a monograph about the uprising, and recognized Anielewicz from the\npicture on the front page, that I found out about his role. There were other people\nfrom Warsaw who came to our house who were involved in the first armed action\nin the Warsaw Ghetto in January 1943, Josef Kaplan among them.\nMy brother, Moshe was taken in the early morning hours of the 28\" of April 1942\nand executed. I was in hiding. My entire family was put under house arrest and I\nhad to surrender. By the delayed action of this process, I escaped a bullet in the\nneck. I was taken to headquarters of the security service and put into a large shed\nthat was full of Jews from our ghetto who had been there since the early morning\nhours. We were shipped out the next morning, April 29, 1942, and arrived in\nAuschwitz past midnight.",
        "Q: What went on between \u201939 and \u201942? What were you doing? Were you still\nworking or ---?",
        "A: Yes. I was the youngest. Every able-bodied Jewish male from the age of 16 to\n60, had to work at least one day on assigned places of work that the Jewish\ncommunity, and later on the ghetto community government, administered. They\nhad to send out forced laborers so to speak, to various posts that the Germans had\ndesignated; military posts, and a variety of other assignments,, doing all sorts of\n3\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwork -- unloading, loading, digging ditches, you name it. There was hardly any\nkind of work that we weren\u2019t assigned to do. Being the youngest, I took the place\nof my father as well as of my older brother, so I would end up working almost\ntwo or three days a week. I didn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather do it than have my father, who\nwas in his mid-to-late fifties and ill, do hard labor. My oldest brother had to help\nmy father so I took his place as well. In 1940, that is August of 1940, almost all\nable-bodied young Jewish males received orders to report for shipment to forced\nlabor camps on the German-Soviet border in the district of Lublin to dig anti-tank\nfortifications. I was the only one in the family who was caught in the net. It\nturned out that if you didn\u2019t report, you simply didn\u2019t go; they didn\u2019t come after\nyou. But if you did report, you were trapped. Several hundred of us left Radom,\nperhaps four or five hundred men. Altogether there were thousands of young\nJewish men from various parts of the country congregated in several forced labor\ncamps stretched along a section of frontier land that ran between two rivers, the\nBug and the San. Our camp was in Cieszanow, where we dug anti-tank\nfortifications along a given section of frontier. That was my introduction to\nforced labor under SS rule. We left dead inmates at the work site every day.\nThey were simply shot at random and buried in the woods and covered up with\nmoss, so that one couldn\u2019t even find their graves, for there were no markers left.\nThis went on until about the end of October when suddenly we were marched out\nof Cieszanow and taken to Belzec, from where, by rail, we were transported to\nKrasnik, in the District of Lublin. We spent the whole night in a courtyard where\nthe Jewish community\u2019s council was located. I will never forget the kindness of\nthe town\u2019s Jewish people who practically showered us with food and drink. In the\nafternoon we were marched out, under guard, to the town of Annapol and handed\nover to a German private firm to build highways. We were not under any military\nsupervision, but just worked as civilians. We discovered soon that if you go away\nand don\u2019t come back, you\u2019re not missed, Several of us decided to start on our\nway home the next morning. We sold whatever clothes we could spare in order to\nget a few zlotys for food and passage money for the trip. We marched 16\nkilometers that morning and crossed a guarded bridge that spanned the Vistula\nRiver, and within two hours were in the next town. We spent the rest of that day\ngoing from small town to town, riding in horse-drawn carts belonging to Jews\nengaged in either transporting people or goods. After darkness, we found\nourselves as \u201cpassengers\u201d on such a cart, sharing the space with a load of grain\nthat the owner smuggled into the city of Radom, traveling through forests all\nnight. Not only were we in violation of the after-darkness curfew, but also sitting\non \u201ccontraband\u201d. Had we been stopped, 1t would have meant the end of us all.\nWe arrived in Radom the next morning after an absence of two and a half months.\nThat was my introduction to camp life, and in a way it helped me later on. When\nI arrived at Auschwitz, unlike many others, I was not totally surprised by what\nawaited us, even although the level of raw brutality in Auschwitz-Birkenau was\nuniquely evil. In retrospect, from what I have learned in the past century, I can\nstate without hesitation, that in the entire universe of evil that was Nazi-occupied\nEurope, there was no place that could match the hell of Birkenau in it\u2019s first year\nof existence. We walked the three kilometers from Auschwitz to Birkenau on\n4\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 1, 1942, and there were one thousand young and middle- aged men in our\ntransport. Within one month most of them were dead. By the end of about two\nmonths, most of those still alive were the ones who survived the camp -- there\nwere fifteen of us. Allow me to track back a bit in time -- I have a reason for\ndoing so. In early 1942 I came down with typhus. There were many typhus cases\nin the ghetto. Normally typhus is survivable by young, healthy people, even\nwithout any medical help as long as there is water to drink, because one can\u2019t eat\nanyway in a State of very high fever. I had developed some complications and\nhemorrhaged all night. We lived in the ghetto under strict curfew conditions and\nhad no access to doctors or drugstores. My brother risked his life to go outside\nthe ghetto to an apothecary in order to get some medication, which turned out to\nbe the wrong one, and it nearly poisoned me. The doctor who attended me was\nsick and he didn\u2019t know the seriousness of the problem. My brother, together\nwith one of our neighbors, searched for a doctor half the night until they found\none. He realized that I was in a bad way for it was the third or fourth case in\ntown that winter of typhus with such complications, and no one survived the\nhemorrhaging. He plainly said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do, if you have some\ncognac, give it to him.\u201d He thought I was out of it, but I was still conscious and I\nremember the stupidity of his suggestion. This was a ghetto in Poland in 1942\nand he expected us to have, or be able to get, cognac in the middle of the night. In\nthe morning my doctor came and ordered a transfusion but there was no way to\nfind a donor who had my blood type. I was supposed to be taken to the hospital\nfor the procedure, but luckily someone decided that I couldn\u2019t possibly survive\nthe trip, since it was a very cold winter day, and my blood pressure was extremely\nlow. Instead, the ghetto hospital sent a surgeon, accompanied by a laboratory\ntechnician who used some hand held dish for typing the blood of several\nvolunteers, including my brother Moshe. I remember the technician telling the\nsurgeon that none of the blood tested matched mine. Nevertheless the surgeon\ndecided to use my brother\u2019s blood for there was no time to lose and he told my\nparents that the risk must be accepted. Transfusions were given directly from\ndonor to recipient via some tube contraption connecting their veins. My parents\nwere standing over my bed knowing very well that any moment now, should my\nbody reject the donor\u2019s blood, their youngest son will be dead within minutes.\nThe doctor kept asking me, how I felt and I said, I feel warm. That\u2019s a good sign,\nhe responded. He finished the transfusion and I was saved. He came back eight\ndays later to take out the stitches and he couldn\u2019t believe his own eyes that I was\nalive. I still have the marks of those stitches on the inside of my right arm. He\nsuggested that I come to the hospital after I get well to be examined thoroughly t\nfind out how I managed to survive that ordeal. It was the same brother whose\nblood saved me, who was shot dead two months later, when I was taken to\nAuschwitz. As it turned out, had I not had typhus at home and developed\nimmunity, there would have been no chance in the world for me to have survived\nBirkenau in 1942.",
        "Q: Can we ask a question, Susan did ----.\n5\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n(S.B.) Did you ever consider escaping rather than returning to the ghetto, after you had\nbeen in the labor camp?",
        "A: When we were in the labor camp, 1.e., in the fall of 1940, there were no ghettos\nyet in most of the General Government of Poland. The ghettos there were formed\nin the spring of 1941. Except, of course, for the city of Lodz, where the ghetto\nwas formed in early 1940, because Lodz was incorporated into the Reich, (1.e. the\ncity of Lodz and the entire province) and the city of Warsaw, where the ghetto\nwas formed in October or November of 1940. Yes, it was a good question. Some\npeople escaped, it was not too difficult to escape across the border which\nconsisted of a simple barbed wire which wasn\u2019t electrified. Of course, if an\ninmate was caught before he reached the no-man\u2019s land he would be shot. On the\nway to work, at some points, we almost brushed against the barbed wire fences.\nWe saw the Soviet guards patrolling. Some officers came close to the fence and\ntalked to us. I remember there was one officer who spoke Yiddish to us He was a\nSoviet Jewish captain. I wanted to escape, some of my friends did. They were all\ncaught by the Soviet guards, every single one of them. Once you escaped across\nthe fence, you had to cross a stretch of no-man\u2019s land of perhaps 50 feet of terrain\nto reach the Soviet fence. In most instances, the German guards couldn\u2019t see,\nwhen one forced the fence, either by crawling under it, or by spreading the strands\nof wire and going through it. The guards were too thinly spread out. However,\nthe escapees were spotted while walking or running through the neutral no-man\u2019s\nland. Since the guards couldn\u2019t shoot at them, they fired rounds in the air, thereby\nalerting the Soviet border guards who apprehended them. Even though, the\nSoviets knew that the escapees were Jewish inmates of forced labor camps,\nrunning for their lives from the Nazis, they were treated as if they were spies.\nEvery single one of them was interrogated in the nearest town of Rava Ruska,\nimprisoned and eventually sent to the northern gulags. Ironically, through this act\nof callous and unconscionable mistreatment at the hands of the Soviet police\napparatus, most of the escapees were saved; for had they been left in the Soviet-\noccupied Polish territories, they would have been killed a year later when the\nNazis invaded the Soviet Union and occupied those territories. I wanted to escape\nfrom the labor camp to join my brother Jechiel, who at the time lived in Lvov, no\nmore than about 100 km south from our camp. I had no notion under what\nghastly conditions he lived in Lvov as a refugee. However, I received a postcard\nfrom home in which my brother Moshe informed me that Jechiel sent a postcard\nhome from some rail station on the old Polish-Soviet border. In the card he told\nus that he is in transport, forcibly evacuated from Lvov, and going either to the\nFar East or to the Caucasus. Well, he wound up in the far North, hundreds of\nkilometers north of Archangelsk. That postcard was dated July 1940. In the\nsummer of 1940, the Soviet authorities rounded up all Polish-Jewish refugees\nunder their jurisdiction who did not apply for Soviet citizenship, and shipped\nthem to the northern gulags. That covered the vast majority of refugees. Once I\nfound out that my brother was no longer in Lvov, I had no great desire to risk an\nescape attempt to face an unknown fate alone. I was too young then. Whether I\nwould have been better off or not is hard to say. The chances are that I had as\n6\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngood a chance to survive as to perish there. About half the people perished in the\nSoviet camps. However, I didn\u2019t escape and returned home to face the real test of\nfending for myself only one and a half years later, when I wound up in Birkenau.\nThe last time I saw my parents and my family was on April 28, 1942. The\nliquidation of the ghettos in Poland an the annihilation of the Jewish population\nthere began in the summer of 1942. In some areas, it started earlier. So about\nthree or four months after I was shipped to Auschwitz and my brother executed,\nmy family, that is my father, my mother, my sister and the entire extended family\nwere shipped to and annihilated at Treblinka. Treblinka became the killing field\nof the Jews from the ghettos of the towns and cities in the districts of Warsaw and\nRadom. In addition, of course, to devouring transports of Jews from all over\nEurope. My personal saga began with my arrival at Birkenau. My experience at\nthe main camp in Auschwitz lasted only about thirty-six hours, enough time for\nthe conversion of civilians into prisoners. But Birkenau was hell. Time was not\nconceived in terms of months or years but in terms of days. If one survived the\nday, one achieved the unlikely. If one survived a month, one achieved the\nimpossible. When new prisoners arrived in the fall of 1942, and I told them that I\nhad been there six months, they found it unbelievable, because most new arrivals,\nby the time they got oriented and realized where they were, which usually took a\nday or two, became aware of the fact that they won\u2019t survive too long. Later on, it\nbecame a little easier but in 1942 was an indescribable hell. We didn\u2019t even know\nupon arrival that Birkenau had just started to become the crown jewel of the Nazi\nkilling machine of European Jewry. It took us several months to find out exactly\nwhat was going on right there.",
        "Q: Did you know that they were killing people in those places?",
        "A: No, no. We didn\u2019t know. A couple of weeks after we arrived, some strong\npeople from our transport were selected to work in the Sonderkomando, but we\nhad no idea what was going on. We thought that they were put to work burning\nthe bodies of prisoners who were killed or died in the camp, since every day there\nwere heaps of dead bodies in front of each barrack. A barrack that counted twelve\nhundred prisoners on Sunday would be half empty by the next Sunday. They\nwould usually combine the contingents of the two half empty barracks into one,\nand use the empty barrack for a new transport. We didn\u2019t know that there are\ntransports arriving from the outside world, 1.e., from ghettos, and internment\ncamps in Western Europe, bringing families of men, women and children. It took\nus months before we realized that. It was well concealed and there\u2019s no wonder\nthat the surrounding world didn\u2019t know, because we, who were that much closer,\ndidn\u2019t know at first. But once we found out, we understood where the trucks\nfilled with people, were going to. For about a year, in fact almost exactly a year,\nfrom March \u201942 until March \u00b043, there were no crematoria in Birkenau. The\ngassing took place in an abandoned farmer\u2019s cottage, the inside of which I had a\nchance to see in 1944, while the burial and later on, the burning of the bodies took\nplace in pits adjacent to the cottage and surrounded by woods.\n7\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThe trucks were loaded at the Auschwitz railroad camp and traveled the two miles\nto the gas chamber, passing the road that surrounded the Birkenau camp complex.\nWe sometimes saw the trucks from inside the camp, and occasionally passed them\nby on the road on our way to work. Most of my work, and the work of people\naround me, was involved in enlarging the camp. It was an enormous universe of\ncamps which could, by the middle of 1944, accommodate close to a quarter of a\nmillion prisoners. My job throughout the spring and early summer of 1942 was\ndigging the foundations for crematorium one. By mid-summer of 1942, they had\nsome crazy idea of separating a group of about 800 young Jewish prisoners, from\n16 to 25 years of age, and forming a masonry school to teach us how to become\nbricklayers. I don\u2019t know what they had in mind for the plan turned into a fiasco.\nNot one of us eventually worked as a bricklayer. Many of the 800 did of typhus\nduring the summer anyway, 1.e., they were selected to go to the gas chamber after\ncontracting typhus, but the few who survived were helped by the fact that they\ndidn\u2019t have to work outside in the heat of summer. With the rations that we\nreceived, compounded by the lack of water, hard labor, sleepless nights and\nbeatings, one did not last long. We were lucky that during a crucial period in the\nsummer, we were indoors in barracks receiving instruction on how to lay bricks.\nBut it didn\u2019t prevent the SS from performing selections among us. They took\nplace every week. Those who looked weak or showed signs of illness or had\nabscesses or scars were selected to go to the gas chamber. By the fall, the\nmasonry school (Maurerschule) ceased to exist. Some of the remaining\nyoungsters were sent to Auschwitz to work, and I was among those assigned to a\nwork commando in Birkenau. The same kapo for whom I worked earlier returned\nfrom the Auschwitz sick bay, where he was confined with typhus, and was given\na new work crew to dig foundations and help in the construction of crematoria\nthree and four. He recognized me and several others, and we became part of a\ngroup of 100 workers who worked for him until the spring of 1943. Only a\nhandful among the original one hundred survived the winter. Our last job under\nhis command was to dig the foundations for the sauna. One day in late April, I\nhad near fatal accident. I was hit by an empty truck. At the time, German tractor\ncabs are usually pulled two or three trailers. After the bricks were unloaded, I\nclosed the side lid of the first trailer but the German truck driver did not see me\nand he started the engine. I was caught between the first and second trailers and\nthrown into the ditch. Had I fallen under the wheels, I would have been dead or\ncompletely maimed. I was so stunned that I couldn\u2019t get up after regaining\nconsciousness. They improvised a kind of stretcher from some boards and carried\nme back to camp. Now carrying back dead or near-dead bodies from work sites\nto the camp was a common sight. Each work detail that returned from work to\ncam invariably carried one or more dead bodies but they were stretched out. Here\nI wasn\u2019t dead or near dead. I simply couldn\u2019t walk. I was sitting up on this\nmakeshift stretcher and looked like a Roman proconsul being carried by four\npeople on their shoulders. There was only one witness who remembered that very\nunusual sight; he died in Canada a few years ago. I was lowered down in front of\nmy barrack where the whole contingent was assembled for roll call, and permitted\nby the barrack elder to sit on the ground while the counting took place.\n8\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAfterwards, I was picked up by a strong Belgian fellow who carried me to my\nthird tier bunk. The next morning, with the support of two men, I made it to the\ndoctor to be examined. If one didn\u2019t go out to work, or report sick, one\u2019s life was\nin mortal danger. There was no third choice -- it was either work or death. The\nkapo came with me, because it happened on his watch so he was sympathetic. By\nthat time he had known me for about a year and in some way acted as my\nprotector. He helped me to the sick bay and we met the chief camp doctor who\nwas a Polish prisoner and former colonel of the Polish army. He should have\nbeen tried and convicted after the war as a war criminal. I thought that he was\ndead but discovered only a couple of years ago that he was tried in Poland\nsometime after the war and was let go for lack of evidence, He would simply\nassault patients who came to him to be examined and he also conducted selections\non his own, sending Jewish prisoners to the gas chambers. His name was\nZenkteler. He treated me more or less, correctly. He examined me and said\nthere\u2019s nothing he can do and that there is nothing wrong with me. But since I\ncame and he knew that I didn\u2019t try to shirk work because the kapo was with me,\nhe gave me a couple of days of what was referred to in German as schonung,\nmeaning rest, at the sick bay, which was barrack no. 7. That barrack was an\nassembly point for Jewish prisoners who reported sick throughout the entire week.\nOn Tuesdays, the trucks would come and take most of them to the gas chambers.\nFrom the very beginning, barrack no. 7 served that function, 1.e., as a way station\nfrom camp to the gas cambers. The moment I crossed the camp road (I\nremembered it as a road, but when I visited there this past September, I realized\nthat it was more like a wide path than a road) and passed one of the little earth and\nbrick bridges that connected the main camp road to the respective sides of the\ncamp which were separated from the road by ditches; something happened to me:\nI suddenly became able to stand on my own feet and asked my two companion,\nwho helped me, to let me walk to no. 7 by myself. In retrospect, it 1s obvious to\nme that my inability to walk was a psychosomatic phenomenon. It was a result of\nthe shock received during the accident. My sudden ability to stand on my own\nfeet must have resulted from the realization that I had better not walk in sick to\nbarrack no. 7. I met people there whom I had known since the beginning, a\ncouple of them came with me in 1942, and they worked there as orderlies. The\nnext morning, I was discharged, and a few days later was transferred to barrack\nno. 16 and thereby gained the assignment to work in the \u201cCanada\u201d work detail.\nLuckily my work was inside the barracks sorting goods and I didn\u2019t have to go to\nthe rail siding to meet arriving transports. That work ended after four weeks\nwhen I developed an infection on my face and was admitted to the sick bay in\nbarrack no. 8. The fact that I was admitted to sickbay no. 8 and not to no. 7 was\nin itself a break for which my cousin was responsible.",
        "Q: Can I stop you? I need to flick the tape over.\n(End of Side A, Tape | in original transcript.)",
        "A: In early 1943, there were two sick bays in the old camp of Birkenau, in addition to\nthe main infirmary to which Jewish prisoners had no access. Of the former two,\n9\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\none was barrack no. 7, which I described above, and the other was barrack no. 8\nwhich admitted some Jewish prisoners. To get me there required a little influence\nin the right place. Although my cousin was surgeon there, he couldn\u2019t simply\nadmit me. I had to be assigned there by the camp\u2019s administrative office, and\nthat\u2019s where his connections helped. Patients there weren\u2019t subject t regular\nselections to the gas chambers and usually stayed there until pronounced fit to\nreturn to the regular barracks. He succeeded 1n treating me for my infection, and\nafter three weeks, I got my first shave, but my face was still full of scarred tissue.\nIt took more than two years before the scar tissue completely disappeared. A few\ndays after transferring out of the sick bay, the old camp for men in Birkenau was\nevacuated and it became part of the enlarged female camp. The men moved to\none of the newly finished wooden barracks camps, called \u201cD Lager\u201d or Camp D.\nThat happened in June of 1943. For the next nine months or so, I went from work\ndetail to work detail, including work inside the barrack, until in April 1944, I was\nrecruited to work in the \u201cSauna\u201d -- the more correct designation being disinfection\nfacility, where civilians were transformed into prisoners. I worked there from\nApril of 1944 until November when the size of the crew operating the facility was\ndrastically reduced and the surplus sent back to Camp D. Birkenau was no longer\nthe destination of incoming transports nor of prisoners transferred from other\ncamps. The last victims of its killing machine were transports from Slovakia and\nTheresienstadt Ghetto, in addition to Birkenau inmates whose fate was sealed by\nthe last mass selections that took place in the fall of 1944. The \u201csauna\u201d facility\nabutted the rod leading from the railroad ramp to the crematorium complex no. 3\nand 4, and we had the unfortunate and heart rending experience of being witness\nto daily processions of thousands upon thousands of men, women and children\nmarching past us to the gas chambers. The marching columns were no more than\nabout 200 yards from their destination, but what 1s still etched in my memory is\nthat the faces of the about-to-be murdered people betrayed only fatigue, perhaps\nconfusion, but no comprehension of their imminent doom. Between April and the\nend of summer, several hundred thousand Hungarian Jews plus countless others\nfrom various parts of Europe, walked this stretch of road without realizing that it\nis their last walk.",
        "Q: Are there any things specific, incidents or episodes that you remember from this\nperiod?",
        "A: I remember far too many episodes but I cannot think of any specific one which\nwould, or should, take precedence over all others, hence, the choice is difficult,\nespecially in an extemporaneous setting. We could sit here for days and tape\nwithout a stop, and not exhaust the reservoir of my recollections of this period, let\nalone the well of accumulated experiences of my three year sojourn in Birkenau.\nBy way of concession to your inquiry, allow me to add the following: what has\nburdened my memory foremost, and is forever etched in my consciousness,\ndespite the lapse of nearly half a century, I the daily procession of thousands of\n10\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\npeople, marching past the \u201csauna\u201d on their way to the gas chambers, and the sight\nof smoke coming out of the crematoria chimneys shortly afterwards.\nHowever, one occurrence which has since become grist for the mills of Holocaust\nresearchers, namely the uprising of the Birkenau Sonderkomando (crematoria\ncrews) in October of 1944, took place within a stone\u2019s throw of the \u201csauna\u201d\nfacility and I would like to register my recollection of the event within the\nframework of this interview.",
        "Q: Was that Greek, was that run by the Greeks?",
        "A: No! To my knowledge there were no Greek Jews among them, or at most, very\nfew. The old guard, 1.e., the cadres consisted mainly of Polish Jews, plus some\nFrench Jews and others. During the late spring of 1944, newly arrived Hungarian\nJews were conscripted to work in the Sonderkomando because the size of the\ncrematoria work details almost tripled at that time. From its very inception in the\nspring of 1942, the Birkenau Sonderkomando crews were subject to periodic\nliquidations. The first total liquidation took place in December 1942, when the\napproximately 500 strong crew was murdered. The first job of the new crew,\nselected the evening before when the Birkenau camp was subject to a strict\ncurfew, was to dispose of the bodies of their predecessors.\nThe next sizeable liquidation took place in November 1943 when a part of the\nSonderkomando was transported to Majdanek, allegedly for work in the\ncrematorium there, but once in Majdanek, they were put to death. The events\nleading to their death in the Majdanek gas chamber were confirmed by members\nof the Majdanek crematorium crew when they arrived in Birkenau in July 1944,\nafter Majdanek was evacuated.\nBy early fall of 1944, when Birkenau no longer functioned as a mass killing\nmachine, the SS began the process of thinning out the ranks of the\nSonderkomando. The first victims were several hundred men from the crew of\ncrematorium no. 3. They were brought to the sauna for disinfection and that was\nthe first time that I came face to face with, and talked to, members of the\nSonderkomando. They were told that they were being transferred to another\ncamp. The disinfection process was used as a subterfuge to lull them into\nbelieving the deception. They weren\u2019t deceived, and were aware of their\nsituation. From the sauna they were taken to Auschwitz where they were put to\ndeath in the old gas chamber. When, on October 6, the order to assemble came\nfor the rest of the crematorium no, 3 crew, they refused and barricaded themselves\ninside the crematorium living quarters. They put their straw mattresses to the\ntorch and exchanged fire with the SS guards outside, using the few small weapons\nin their possession. The guards pretty soon received reinforcements from the SS\nbarracks that were located not far away. When it was over, crematorium no. 3\nremained a gutted shell and the several hundred prisoners inside, all dead.\n11\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThe burning of the facility and the sound of the firefight was construed by the\ncrew of crematorium no. | as a signal that the expected uprising has begun. After\nthrowing their German kapo into the burning furnace, they cut the barbed wire\nthat enclosed the crematorium and dispersed in the direction of the Vistula River.\nThe SS gave chase and every single one of the several hundred prisoners was\nhunted down and killed. Several days later the crew of crematorium no. 2 was\ngassed and all that remained of the approximately 1,500 strong Birkenau\nSonderkomando was the crematorium no. 4 crew of less than 100 men, who at the\ntime were barracked within the main camp.\nFollowing the events described above, crematoria nos. 1,2 and 3 were blown up\nand dismembered. Crematorium no. 4 was left intact until January 18, 1945, the\nday of the final evacuation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp complex. An\nattempt was made to separate the remaining members of the Sonderkomando, but\nin the haste of the overall and sudden evacuation, they managed to get\nintermingled with the general camp population and share their fate and survival\nchances in the ensuing months ahead. I was told after the war that about 30 or 40\nof them survived the ordeal of evacuation and death marches.\nCrematorium no. 4 was blown up on January 18, and I subsequently learned that\nthe demolition was only partly successful.\nI myself was assigned to a work detail in late November \u2014 early December, 1944,\nto break up the concrete floor of the crematorium 3 gas chamber. We used\nhammers and pickaxes for the job. During our work, we found many pliers that\nwere used by the crematoria crews to pull out gold teeth from the mouths of the\ngassed victims. The unbelievable circumstances of this assignment did not escape\nme at the time for I was the only one among the prisoners in that work detail who\nworked at digging the foundation and at the construction of the very same\ncrematorium two years before, and lived long enough to be present at, and\nparticipate in, it\u2019s demolition.\nI recall one incident during the uprising which in retrospect fills me with terror.\nWhile the road outside the sauna building was teeming with SS guards and\nofficers running on foot and on any conveyance they could find including\nbicycles, in the direction of crematorium | where the breakout took place, we in\nthe sauna received the dreaded order, \u201cAlle Juden eintreten\u2019\u2019, 1.e., all Jews fall-in.\nWe assembled in the courtyard, separated from the non-Jewish members of the\nwork crew, and watched with horror, and envy, the satisfaction on the faces of the\nlatter that they are lucky enough not to be Jews and not to have to share our\nforeboding of doom, and doom was exactly what we expected at the time. We\nnever found out the reason for our being ordered to assemble, but were greatly\nrelieved when we were dismissed later on. It was the last time in my\nincarceration that I was subject to that blood-chilling fear produced by an order\nfor Jews to assemble separately.\n12\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI went back to Birkenau this past September, my first visit since I left the camp in\nJanuary 1945, and I was overwhelmed by the desolateness of the place. Where\ncrematorium no. | stood, there are only a few slabs of concrete sticking out of the\nground and a commemorative plaque affixed to a stone telling what took place\nthere. Only the brick barracks of the original camp remain while the hundreds of\nwood barracks were allowed to disintegrate or taken apart for firewood. The\nbrick chimneys of the latte stood out ghostlike and are the only remainder of a\npast to which they bear witness.\nI was accompanied on my trip by a friend from Warsaw. It was during the late\nmorning, on a Saturday, and the two of us were the only ones there. In that huge\ncomplex of former camp there wasn\u2019t another human being in sight. There was\nan eeriness in the absolute silence that pervaded this greatest of killing fields of all\ntime. The eeriness became more intense for me when I juxtaposed this silence of\nthe grave against my recollections of the teeming scores of thousands of\nprisoners, who at any time between 1942 and 1945, occupied these grounds, not\nto mention the millions who never set foot inside the barbed wire confines but\nwalked, or were trucked, on the nearby road from the railroad ramp to the gas\nchambers.\nOn the way back to Cracow we stopped at the Auschwitz camp which is about\ntwo miles from Birkenau. The parking lot was full; there were bus loads with\nvisitors, and the cafeteria was busy. The place projected an aura of a busy shrine,\nwhile Birkenau has been allowed to go to seed and its physical plant is so\ndisintegrated that it is beyond repair, and certainly beyond recognition.\nThere is no comparison between the two camps in the way they are kept and\nmaintained as Polish national museums. In that connection, it is apropos to reflect\non the difference between the two places when they functioned as Nazi\nconcentration camps. Auschwitz was not unlike many Nazi camps within\nGermany. The difference was only in degree, 1.e., more cruelty, more harshness,\nmore of everything evil, but in its basic essentials it resembled concentration\ncamps like Dachau, Buchenwald, etc. However, Birkenau belonged to a different\nuniverse of evil. It its operating mode, and in its basic objectives that unique hell\ncould be justly described as having been a slaughterhouse rather than a\nconcentration camp.",
        "Q: Okay and I missed all that. You were telling me about the cement bags and all\nthat ,",
        "A: In April, the so-called winter issue of clothing had to be surrendered. A prisoner\nrisked his life if he wore any such article past the due time. April was not spring,\nyet, in this part of the world. I fact, I was never so cold in my life as I was in May\nof 1942. I slept on the upper bunk and the wind came in from the open rafters\nunder the roof, and we had no bedding or blankets and slept in our day clothing,\nwhich consisted of a shirt and a cotton blouse of sorts. If one was lucky enough\n13\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand worked at a construction site where cement was used, the empty bags were\nconverted into undershirts by cutting out holes at the sides and top and worn\nunder the garment as an added layer against the wind and cold. Again, you wore\nit at your peril for, if caught, the retribution was merciless. The combination of\nexposure; sleeplessness; total fatigue from hard work, long marches, and endless\nhours of standing at the morning and evening roll-calls; very little food and water;\nlack of medical care; non-existing sanitation; and the ever present beatings, which\nfrequently concluded with the victim being strangled, contributed to a very short\nlife span for the vast majority of Jewish prisoners.\nOur daily food rations were minimal but were made much smaller by the barrack\nelder and his helpers who appropriated one-fifth of the bread by dividing a loaf\ninto five portions instead of the required four portions. Of the margarine and\noccasional liverwurst or smelly cheese, we received the tiniest of fractions allotted\nto us, while the rest was brazenly stolen by the barrack elder and either sold for\nother products, or distributed to his cronies and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The soup was\ndistributed at the worksite at noon and was one of our supplies of drinking water.\nThe fact that we did not have spoons did not, in most instances, make any\ndifference.\nThe soup consisted of water, some thickener, a few bits of floating potatoes or\nbeets and, very rarely, a morsel of meat, The presence of meat in the soup meant\nlittle to us, for we never saw it in our bowls. The kapo usually allowed the meat\nto sink to the bottom of the soup container and did not stir the contents before\nserving. The booty belonged to him and his helpers.\nAt every worksite throughout the camp, when it came time to line up for the soup,\nthere was jockeying for position and ensuing pandemonium, for no one wanted to\nbe the first in line to be served from the top of the container. Occasionally, the\nstrategy of those who managed to line up at the end of the line was rewarded with\nfailure when the kapo decided to stir the soup at the beginning of the line, or when\nhe decided to serve from the top of the second container, instead of emptying the\nfirst.\nThe bread ration was distributed in the evening, after roll call and it was usually\neaten at once. That meant waiting 24 hours for the next piece of solid food, for in\nthe morning we only received some cold, vile-tasting ersatz tea, made from some\nkind of leaves. It required discipline to forego eating the entire ration of bread at\nnight and have some for the morning. If one managed that, he could last a little\nlonger.\nWe envied those lucky enough to be chosen for work assignments in Auschwitz.\nVery few had the luck to be considered for such assignments or had the requisite\nskills asked for. That tells a lot about our perception of the relative merits of the\ntwo camps. We knew that Birkenau was the place that we were sent to die, but in\nour desperation we thought that Auschwitz offers a chance, however slim.\n14\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMost people now do not know the difference between Auschwitz and Birkenau.\nSome have never heard of Birkenau. When Auschwitz is referred to as the\nlargest Nazi extermination camp, it is Birkenau that fits this description, for it is\nthere where it took place. The Auschwitz gas chamber and crematorium was the\nplace where the extermination started in early spring of 1942, but it was eclipsed\nby the far more extensive scale and scope of the Birkenau death factories.\nBirkenau was designed and built for the sole purpose of serving as a giant killing\nmachine to dispose of that part of European Jewry that had not been devoured by\nthe extermination centers in Eastern Poland.\nReferences in the general American press and electronic media usually equate\nBuchenwald, Dachau, Majdanek, Treblinka, etc. as was one of those camps where\nEuropean Jews were martyred. This is a gross inaccuracy and reflects a failure to\nunderstand the difference between concentration camps and extermination camps,\nas well as a failure to grasp the history of the period as it relates to the destruction\nof European Jews.\nIn the fall of 1942, an attempt was made to make German concentration camps,\nwithin the borders of the Old Reich, \u201cJudenfre1\u2019, 1.e., free of Jews. A transport of\nseveral hundred Jewish prisoners from various camps in Germany arrived in\nBirkenau at that time. Among these were German, Austrian, and some Czech\nJews who were imprisoned since 1933, 1938 and 1939, respectively. Within a\nshort period, only a small remnant of that transport remained alive.\nBirkenau was not designed as a place to concentrate people to prevent them from\ndoing damage to the state, but as a place where people were sent to die in a\nsomewhat slower process than execution. That was my experience of Birkenau,\nat least for the first six months to a year. Those who survived that period had\nincreased chances of making it to the end.",
        "Q: Do you want to discuss some of the further things that happened to you during\nyour time there? You were liberated at Birkenau, you have Birkenau ---?",
        "A: No! Birkenau was liberated in January of 1945. I wasn\u2019t so lucky. The Soviet\noffensive started on January 12, in central Poland. By the 18\", the Nazis had to\nevacuate the remaining prisoners of the entire Birkenau and Auschwitz camp\ncomplex. We were assembled and marched to Auschwitz. We received our ration\nfor the transport, some bread and something, and we marched all night and then\nanother night, and we left many dead on the way. The column was guarded by SS\nwhose rearguard members killed any prisoner who couldn\u2019t keep up with the\ncolumn. We walked and kept hearing shots all night. They would leave the dead\non the road and the local authorities were required to remove the corpses. It was\nsnowing and I was barely awake, walking in a trance and becoming fully\nconscious only when I bumped into the person ahead of me in the column. We\nmust have walked 25 or 30 kilometers a night. During the day, we were\n15\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\naccommodated in some barn for a couple of hours rest. Of course, we couldn\u2019t\nsleep for it was too cold. The barn belonged to a Polish farmer and I remember a\nwoman came out and brought some hot drinks for us but she couldn\u2019t do much\nmore. Some people tried to figure out a way to escape at that time. It was\nextremely risky. The first night two of my acquaintances tried to escape, but they\nwere caught and executed on the spot. The second night was worse because more\npeople were killed for not being able to keep up with the column. Hundreds of\npeople were killed in those two nights of marching until we were brought to a\nplace which looked like an abandoned railroad station or some kind of facility.\nWe had no idea what it was or where we were. We spent the rest of the night\nthere and were loaded into open railroad freight cars for a whole day\u2019s travel to\nGross-Rosen, a notorious concentration camp in lower Silesia.\nTo describe the existing conditions at Gross-Rosen as pandemonium would be\nunderstating the case. It was a medium size camp, capable of holding perhaps\nseveral thousand prisoners, but at the time of my arrival there were between thirty\nand forty thousand prisoners there, most of them evacuees from camps further\neast. My barrack housed about 1,200 men and there was hardly room for them to\nstand during roll call. It is not hard to imagine what happened when they all tried\nto find a place to stretch out for the night. Those positioned close to the wall were\nlucky, but those in the middle couldn\u2019t even find a place to sit on the floor. If one\nleft his place for a visit to the latrine, that place would be pounced upon and\nfought over by those with no place of their own.\nThe food supply and distribution system was in shambles. The camp kitchens had\nlittle left and couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand placed on it. We never knew\nwhen the soup would be delivered, it could be in the afternoon or at 2 a.m. The\nsame was true with respect to the bread ration. Neither of the two contained salt.\nThe soup was nothing but water and some beets, a vile concoction, and hard to\nswallow because of the lack of salt.\nI wore a halfway decent looking three quarter coat which I acquired while\nworking in the sauna. One day a German kapo came over to me and requested\nthat I give him my coat. He was an evacuee just as I was, and didn\u2019t function as a\nkapo there. I told him to go and fly a kite. Under the conditions, he was no better\nthan anyone else and he did not scare me. He thought that I, being a Jewish\nprisoner, would defer to his demand by virtue of his superior status. Someone\nwas observing our exchange and when it was finished, he came over and said, I\ncould not believe that you had the guts to tell him off. This fellow was from\nRadom, a friend of my brother and our paths crossed in Birkenau in 1943, and I\nhad no idea that he was still alive. He survived the war and lives in Haifa now. I\nspoke to him during my visit to Israel this past October.\nAfter three weeks of this life with little food, hardly any sleep and no chance to\nwash, we got our marching orders, a can of meat as our provision, and off we\nwere, two thousand of us, on another death march.\n16\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Was that your worst, or one of your worst experiences?",
        "A: If I discount my experiences in Birkenau throughout 1942, I would have to say\nyes; my sojourn in Gross-Rosen was one of the harshest episodes of my\nincarceration, except for what was yet to come.\nArmed with our can of meat, which in most instances was eaten in one sitting\n(there is not much else one can do with an open can of meat except eat it since it\nis not too portable) we started out on what was to become the deadliest segment\nof our three and one half months long agony that took us from Birkenau to\nfreedom. We marched for two days and lost many people until we reached some\nrail embarkation point. That was on a Thursday and we didn\u2019t reach Flossenburg\n(another of those stone quarries camps) until the following Tuesday. The distance\nwas not far at all, for Bohemia. It was snowing most of the time and we were in\nopen freight cars without any protection from the element and without blankets.\nThat can of meat was the last food issued to us until we reached Flossenburg, and\nthen some. That meant eight days on a pound-sized can of meat. Some of us\nwere able to lower the empty cans and scoop up some snow from the ground and\ndrink the melted snow.\nUpon arrival in Flossenburg, there were close to 500 corpses among us. They\ndied of hunger and exposure. That was in addition to the many that we lost on our\ntwo daylong march. The way up to the camp\u2019s entrance led through a very steep\nroad which to us, at that time was like scaling Mt. Everest. Our arrival at the\nshowers coincided with a blackout due to an air raid alarm which lasted for most\nof the night. I remember a wave of naked bodies pushing towards the door and\nattendants, using high pressure hosed with cold water, forced us back to the wall,\nwhile those at the wall pushed us back again, and throughout all this there were\ndead bodies on the floor and their numbers increasing. It was a night never to be\nforgotten. When released in the morning and assigned to the quarantine barrack, it\ntook almost another day before we received the first morsel of food.\nOur sleeping arrangements, due to the crowding, was an ordeal that 1s hard to\nconvey unless experienced; it cannot be comprehended. Imagine a bunk narrower\nthan a twin bed, meant for one but sleeping four, packed like sardines, two heads\non one end of the bed and two heads on the other end. If two bunks were placed\nalongside each other, the barrack elders felt that such an arrangement adds\navailable space, hence, it could accommodate ten bodies. There were no\nmattresses or blankets, just bare slats. After spending a restful night like that, we\nwere driven out of the barrack in the early morning to spend the whole day\noutside in the bitter cold, and not allowed back in until the evening.\nThe camp had several terraced levels carved out of stone and on each level were\nbarracks. I discovered that on one of the levels below ours there is a barrack led\nby the former chief kapo of Birkenau, Aloisy. He was a German political\n17\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nprisoner, but murderous and paranoid to boot. He allowed the inmates of his\nbarrack, those who didn\u2019t go out to work, to sit on the floor of the barrack all day.\nThey couldn\u2019t move about -- they just had to sit. It was still better than freezing\noutside. I took a calculated risk and went down to his barrack one morning, and\nsat down on the floor among the others, without asking his permission. He\nremembered me from many encounters in Birkenau and I knew that if he were\nasked for permission, he would never grant it. I just made myself as unobtrusive\nas possible, and he ignored me as if I weren\u2019t there. Yet, he never asked me to\nleave. The only problem was that by sitting there, I had to forfeit the soup in my\nbarrack. When he dished out the soup to his people, I grabbed a bowl and lined\nup, although I didn\u2019t belong there. Some days he ladled out a double ration for\nme, or called me back to receive a supplementary helping, and on other days, he\nwould hit me and give me no soup, without ever telling me why or speaking to\nme. On balance, I thought that the trade-off was in my favor, 1.e., it was more\nimportant to be warm than to have a guaranteed soup every day.\nAfter about a month we left Flossenburg and after traveling by train a couple of\ndays we arrived in Leonberg, near Stuttgart, by the third week of March. It was a\nsmall camp located almost in the middle of the small town. The camp served as a\nlabor reservoir for a Messerschmitt plant nearby. The plant was situated in an\nautobahn tunnel which was closed off at both ends and converted to a two-level\nmanufacturing facility producing wings for Messerschmitt military aircraft. It\nwas the first time since leaving Birkenau that I was put to work. My friend, Isaac,\nwho left Birkenau in October 1944, was in Leonberg the whole winter and\nworked as a riveter at the plant. He trained me to use a riveting gun. The trouble\nwas that I couldn\u2019t hoist myself up on the assembly platform for I was very weak.\nThe food was very meager, consisting of spinach soup every day and a small\nration of bread.\nUsually, completed wings would be rolled out to the autobahn through the tunnel\nentrance and picked up by trucks. In the entire two-week period that I was there,\nnot a single wing left the assembly hall, for everything that moved on the highway\nwas fair game for U.S. warplanes. I remember how amazed I was watching a unit\nof Wehrmacht sappers that was engaged in chiseling away at the tunnel walls at\nboth ends and packing the cavities with explosives to be detonated at the proper\ntime. What amazed me was not the fact that they were going to blow up a\nproduction facility (I often wondered whether we\u2019ll be on the outside or\nimmolated within the tunnel when it occurs), or deny the Allied forces an\nautobahn shortcut through that tunnel, but the ease and composure displayed\nduring their work. They worked regular shifts, took time out for a smoke and\ncoffee breaks, went to lunch and behaved as if they were building a tunnel rather\nthan preparing its destruction.\nWell, I never fully mastered the skill of riveting for the camp was evacuated on\nApril 1, and I never found out whether the sappers\u2019 job paid dividends or whether\ntheir orders were so construed as to prevent the success of their mission. We\n18\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmarched the better part of the day until we reached a rail station of some small\ntown near Stuttgart, or a suburb of Stuttgart. Another two day travel without\nfood, and we arrived at Kaufering, Upper Bavaria, which was a satellite camp of\nDachau.\nThe tiny barracks there, huts really, were half underground and half above\nground. The reason for this odd design was a mystery to us. The place was not\ntoo crowded, there was no work for us, and the food was at near starvation level.\nWhen we arrived at this camp late at night, we camped out in the field waiting for\nthe processing to start in the morning. I fell asleep, and woke up in the morning\namidst a pool of rainwater. I didn\u2019t even know it was raining.\nWe vegetated there for about two weeks, followed by yet another march and\nthree- day train trip, without food, of course. One thing stands out in my memory\nabout this trip, for it restored a bit of my faith in man\u2019s humanity. The guard in\nour car was a Wehrmacht soldier in his fifties who came from Dresden or\nsomewhere nearby. He took out his wallet and showed us pictures of his family,\namong them a son on the eastern front.. He showed us an excerpt from a German\nnewspaper from which we learned of the death of President Roosevelt. When our\ntrain stopped at some station, he left the car in order to steal some potatoes for us.\nHe expressed his regrets that he can\u2019t help in any other way. We arrived at\nMuhldorf, another Dachau satellite camp and not that far away from Kaufering,\nyet it took us three days by train to get there. It was to be our last camp, however,\nnot our last transport.\nIn Muhldord, I met many former inmates from Birkenau, those who left during\nthe mass evacuation in October 1944, as well as those from a transport of non-\nPolish Jewish inmates who were shipped from Birkenau to Warsaw in the summer\nof 1943 to clear the ruins of the destroyed ghetto in that city. They were\nevacuated from Warsaw at the beginning of the polish uprising there in August of\n1944. This was the first place in my three months of wandering where I\nencountered some friendship and encouragement, and it helped a lot.\nAfter several days of work at different work details, I was assigned one day to a\ngroup whose job it was to clear out a machine shop, which was located in a\nconverted or abandoned monastery. We loaded a truck full of machine tools and\ngrinding stones. Some of it loose and some of it in heavy metal crates. The\nconveyance consisted of a trailer cab that pulled two open trailers. The first\ntrailer carried the uncrated stuff plus several prisoners sent along to do the\nunloading. I was one of them. The second trailer held the crated material, two\nGerman civilians, and two armed guards. We had no idea of the destination of\nthis shipment. The driver turned off the main road and took us down a very steep\nroad leading towards a river, at which point, I suppose he was going to make a\nturn and proceed on the road alongside the river. Well, luckily for us as it turned\nout, he never made it to the river, for he soon realized that he did not have enough\nbraking power to prevent the cab and the trailers from jackknifing into the river as\n19\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsoon as they hit the bottom of that road. He turned the cab into the ditch, jumped\nout, and hollered in German, \u201cJump\u201d. There were three of us in the first trailer,\nmy friend, Isaac, who was standing, another fellow and myself were sitting on the\nfloor of the trailer. Isaac jumped in time, but the two of us didn\u2019t make it and we\nwere caught in an overturned trailer with heavy debris flying all over, including\nthe stuff from the second trailer which toppled. I lost consciousness for a moment\nand when I came to, I saw myself covered with debris, and people clearing it\naway and carrying me away from the road towards the woods. I was bleeding\nfrom a cut above the eye and from a cut in the back of my head. It was as great a\nmiracle as any that happened to me during the war. There were heavy objects\nflying all around me, some weighing hundreds of kilograms and all I suffered,\nwere two cuts. Of course, no one knew whether I sustained some internal injuries\nor some brain injuries.\nThe German driver was very upset, for he felt guilty about the accident; he tried to\nget some assistance but all that he managed to do was to bring a band-aid for me\nand a promise that someone will come to take me to the camp\u2019s sick bay. In the\nmeantime, hell broke loose with the sound of exploding bombs and flak that came\nfrom a nearby town under air attack by U.S. warplanes. I remember someone\nsaying that it 1s the Allies gift to Hitler on his birthday, and that is how I know it\nhappened on April 20. Because of this air attack, we had to wait for hours until we\nwere transported back to camp, and when I presented myself at the sick bay, the\nfloor was littered with people injured during the bombing of some facilities\nnearby. Among them was a fellow from Radom who took a shrapnel in his thigh.\nHis survival is a saga, for he was operated on in a German military hospital only\nafter liberation, which was about two weeks after he was wounded. He lives in\nMiami Beach now.\nI received no help or sympathy from the people in the sick bay; they had more\nserious injuries to deal with. I was merely assigned to a rest barrack, where after\nseveral days we received orders to assemble for transport. The Muhldorf camp\nwas being evacuated. That was to be our last transport but we didn\u2019t know it, of\ncourse. As we assembled, I overheard one of the SS guards tell someone not to\nworry, \u201cYou are being taken to Switzerland\u201d. That really gave me cause to be\nworried for if they felt compelled to lie about our destination, that meant we were\nin real trouble. Our destination was not Switzerland but straight south towards the\nBavarian Alps and Austria. The rails of that part of Bavaria were clogged with\ntrains full of prisoners being dragged towards the Reich\u2019s last redoubt. What they\nhad in store for us there, or how they were going to resolve the dilemma of either\nkilling the remaining scores of thousands of Jewish concentration camp prisoners,\nor letting them be liberated by the Allied armies can only be conjectured.\nWe traveled for several days and covered little distance, spending more time on\nsidings, allowing other trains to pass through. Our transport was not immune to\nair attacks by U.S. warplanes, as any moving objects would be in those days. The\npilots had no way of knowing who was inside those rail cars. When an alarm was\n20\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsounded the guards locked the car doors from the outside and took cover in the\nwoods nearby, leaving us as sitting ducks. Luckily, there were no bombs thrown,\nhowever, we were machine-gunned and there were casualties.\nOn the second or third day of our journey, we found ourselves sidetracked at a\nsmall railroad station in Upper Bavaria called Poeing. There were rumors that the\ntransport commander, a German army officer, ordered that the locomotive, plus\none empty car, be detached from the train and return to Dachau in order to obtain\nprovisions for the prisoners in his charge. There were several thousand of us and\nhardly any food left. If that story had any truth to it, it would only reflect the\nnaivete of the officer who was not attuned to the ways the SS camp administration\noperated. Once a transport left the camp, no one assumed the responsibility for\nprovisioning the prisoners of that transport, except perhaps for providing the\ninitial rations. I\u2019m sure that he couldn\u2019t obtain a single loaf if bread in Dachau for\nthe camp was already at the point of disintegration at that time, or about to be\noverrun by the U.S. Army.\nI don\u2019t remember how long we had not eaten at that point, but I do recall that I\nwas very hungry and decided to eat a raw potato that I had somehow acquired. I\nwas aware of the risk, and it would have been the first time for me to ignore the\npossible consequences. No sooner had I cut, or peeled the potato when we\nbecame aware of a very loud conversation outside. Someone opened the door of\nthe car (these were closed cattle cars, not open ones) and we were treated to a\nmost grotesque spectacle on the platform, where many prisoners were jumping\nand shouting, \u201cthe war is over\u2019\u2019, and in their excitement embraced some guards.\nThe guard unit of our transport consisted of a motley crew of SS, Wehrmacht\nsoldiers, and black uniformed Ukrainians. The platform was littered with\nabandoned knapsacks belonging to the Ukrainians for they were the first to\nabandon the ship, either out of fear of retribution or using the opportunity to\ndesert.\nThe source of the story about the war\u2019s end was no other than the commanding\nofficer of the transport. He went into the stationmaster\u2019s office to use the\ntelephone and heard a radio announcement to that effect. He came out and said.\n\u201cThe war is over, you are free to go\u201d. Of course, it was a false alarm. What\nhappened was on that day, or the night before, there was an uprising in Munich,\ninvolving some Wehrmacht units and civilian sympathizers. It really took place.\nThey declared Munich an open city and wanted it surrendered to the Americans,\nrather than have it destroyed. However, the coup was suppressed by an SS\ndivision, and so came to a quick end, the only open insubordination of the\nGerman military in the Second World War. I only recently read the details of that\nstory in a book called The Hundred Days by John Tolen. He was an American\nwar correspondent following the Allied troops into Germany in 1945.\nIn the meantime, the car doors were opened and masses of prisoners were milling\naround on the platform. Hundreds decided to take off and ran in all directions\n21\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntowards the nearest village or town. I never did eat that raw potato and, instead,\nsaid to my friend, Isaac, if the war is really over, it\u2019s over right here as well as in\nthe nearest village, and there is no need to run into the unknown. First things\nfirst, I said, let\u2019s go and find the car that holds the provisions. We located it, but it\nwas difficult for me to climb up onto a railcar from the ground. I managed to\nhoist myself onto it and emerged with a loaf of bread and some margarine. So did\nhe, and we both ate ourselves full after three months of near starvation.\nSoon enough, we heard the sound of shooting and saw emerging groups of\nprisoners running for their lives back to the train. We learned from them that as\nsoon as they approached the village nearby, they were rounded up by Volksturm\ntroops (Home Army) who shot at them and drove them back to the train. There\nwere casualties. It turned out that some paid with their lives when they were\nalmost at the threshold of freedom. The news from Munich about the end of the\nwar turned out to be premature. The transport reassembled and got on its way\nagain.\nA while later our train stopped alongside another train with French speaking\ncivilian workers inside. I understood a little French. I didn\u2019t speak it but I used\nthe few words that I knew and asked them whether the war was over. They said\nthey weren\u2019t aware of it.\nThe next day we stopped at many places and German women came out and\nbrought food and drink but only a few managed to get it. We noticed that the\nguards didn\u2019t interfere and we felt that the end was near at hand. The same night\nwe stopped at a rail siding near the Alpine village of Tutzing. We were asleep on\nthe floor of the car when in the middle of the night we were awakened by sounds\non the outside. There were some people out there, whether military or civilian, I\ndidn\u2019t know for I was too tired to notice. They said that they were from the\nInternational Red Cross and that for all purposes, we are free men, and that U.S.\ntroops should be in the vicinity pretty soon. I fell asleep again, and what was said\noutside didn\u2019t really punctuate my consciousness. I just didn\u2019t believe it anymore.\nI got up in the morning and looked outside, and what I saw was a dream come\ntrue. The SS guards were gone, disappeared through the night, the few\nWehrmacht soldiers, without weapons, were mingling with our people and down\nthe road, at the foot of the embankment, we spotted motorized columns of troops\nthat didn\u2019t look German. They were units of the U.S. Third Army, 100\" Division,\nI believe. It was April 30, 1945, exactly three years to the day of my arrival at\nAuschwitz.\nThe U.S. troops were merely passing by that road, going somewhere, and\nencountered masses of emaciated people coming down the embankment to greet\nthem and cheer them on. From their moving vehicles, they threw at us cigarettes,\nchocolate, and various rations.\n22\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThe group of Wehrmacht soldiers was waiting in our midst for most of the day\nuntil a U.S. army vehicle came to take them away as prisoners. There was one SS\nman who either did not manage to escape or came back for some reason. He was\nof short stature and I remembered him as a mean S.O.B. The moment he was\nspotted by the Greek fellows, they began to pummel him. He would have been\nlynched had not the Americans interceded and taken him away. I was in a mood\nto explore and began walking on the track for several hundred feet or so. I\nremember turning my head to make sure I am not followed. I simply could not\nbelieve that I was free. After three years of living under a death sentence, the\nvery first moments of freedom seemed unreal and dreamlike. It is hard to\nrecapture those moments of delight and joy mixed with sadness and sorrow, for\nthere I was, 23 years of age, having just emerged alive after a cataclysmic long\nwar and imprisonment, and alone in the world. I knew nothing about my brother\nin the Soviet gulag and I feared for the life of my oldest brother who was\nevacuated from Birkenau the preceding October. The rest of my immediate and\nextended family was destroyed, as were most of my friends and neighbors.\nIn the meantime, the immediate problems of survival had to be given some\nattention. A lieutenant of the U.S. Army\u2019s 100\" Division, named Smith, appeared\non the scene. He apparently was placed in charge to organize the setting up of a\nDisplaced Persons\u2019 Center in Feldafing, a few kilometers from the village of\nTutzing, where our train was still used as our home. We spent two days and two\nnights on that train, having the satisfaction of seeing German POW army officers\nand army doctors of a nearby military hospital bringing containers of soup and\nladling it out to us. At the same time. Lt. Smith and his staff got the townspeople\nbusy in the conversion of a former Hitler Youth School complex of buildings into\nan UNRRA DP Center. They cleaned the place, set up beds with mattresses and\nlinens, and got the kitchen and mess hall running. The train brought us to\nFeldafing once it was ready to receive us. Before we entered the new quarters, we\nhad to leave all of our clothes to be burned at a bonfire outside the building. By\nway of new clothing, we received a pair of heavy striped hospital pajamas. The\nGreek fellows of our transport broke into the clothing stores of the Hitler Youth\nSchool and emerged with brown Hitler Youth uniforms. It was a grotesque sight\nto see former inmates wearing those uniforms, but no one seemed to care. We\nwere on our own and had to obtain clothes one way or another. I found a pair of\nshorts, which were several sized too small, even though I weighed no more than\n85 or 90 lbs. at most. Next, I located one moccasin and as luck would have it, a\nfew days later, I found the matching one on another floor of the building. That\nwas the sum total of my clothes for the next six weeks or so.\nThere wasn\u2019t too much food at the mess hall and we were still hungry. However,\nit turned out to be our advantage. We slowly gained weight and strength. At\nother centers, where the food was more abundant, 1.e., more fat and high protein,\nwhich wasn\u2019t too well digested by people who starved for too long, there were\ncases of serious diarrhea and death.\n23\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nIn time I discovered that in Garmisch, south of us and at the very foothills of the\nBavarian Alps, there was a larger concentration of survivors from Radom who\nlived in the UNRRA camp there. I traveled in my pajamas, hitching a ride on a\nmilk train. It was there that I acquired my first suit of clothes. After about a\nmonth, we were all transferred to the DP camp in Landsberg. It was there that I\nlearned that my oldest brother had been sighted in Flossenburg, the last week of\nApril. One day, while playing ping-pong in the recreation hall, I was greeted by a\nyoung man whom I didn\u2019t know. In response to my question, where we had met,\nhe said, in the Flossenburg camp. I left Flossenburg in the middle of March, but\nhe said no, I saw you there about the 23\" or 24\" of March, before the evacuation.\nHe meant my brother, for we resembled each other, even though he was ten years\nolder. This was in the middle of summer, if he had been alive I would have\nheard about it, for people traveled between DP camps and news spread. It was a\nheartbreaking disappointment to me that having gone through so much, he\nperished within days of liberation. I don\u2019t know where it happened; whether he\nwas killed during the last death march, or died of starvation.\nIn the early fall of 1945, I left for Stuttgart whose DP Center became Radom in\nexile, attracting Radom survivors from all over Germany, as well as some who\ncame out of Poland. It was there that I received news that my brother in the\nSoviet Union survived and that he is in Central Asia. The news came via a letter\nfrom my brother to Radom, which was read by my cousin at the office of the\nJewish shelter there, and transmitted by a former neighbor of mine who had left\nRadom and had just arrived in Stuttgart. It was the first heartening news for me\nafter the war, yet I doubted whether the Soviets would ever permit the refugees to\nget repatriated to Poland. I remembered the story of my father\u2019s younger brother\nwho was caught in a similar bind after the First World War and could never return\nhome to Poland. He and his family perished in the Ukraine during the Holocaust.\nI spent six months in Stuttgart, and on April 28, 1946 (the fourth anniversary of\nmy leaving home) I was on a freight train with hundreds of others going to\nBremerhaven, where on May 10\", we boarded a U.S. troopship for New York.\nWe were the first displaced persons to arrive in the United States after World War\nII. We got a festive send-off by the U.S. Army in Bremerhaven and when we\narrived in New York on May 20t, the pier was full of newspaper people and\nphotographers. It must have been the first and last time that arriving DP\nimmigrants met with such a reception.\nI was sponsored by my uncle, my mother\u2019s younger brother and only living uncle.\nHe was never married and my brother and I were the only survivors of his very\nlarge family. He treated me with great kindness.\nNot long after my arrival in the United States, I received mail from Stuttgart in\nwhich my neighbor informed me that someone arrived from Stettin (the former\nGerman Baltic port, now a part of Poland) to Stuttgart and told her that my\nbrother and his wife have come to Stettin with one of the transports of the\n24\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nrepatriated Polish citizens from the soviet Union. They came back to Poland\nshortly after my emigration to the United States, and as it turned out, luckily my\nfears that he won\u2019t be repatriated were unfounded. I had his address and sent him\na food parcel immediately. By the time the parcel reached Stettin, he and his\npregnant wife were already in a West Berlin DP Center. The reason for their\nleaving and for the exodus of most of the thousands of repatriates from the Soviet\nUnion and others, was the bloody pogrom in the Polish town of Kielce, not far\nfrom Radom, on July 4, 1946, in which over forty Jewish survivors from the\nconcentration camps were hacked to death as a result of some blood libel. The\npolice and the military did not intervene, while some policemen participated in\nthe bloodbath.",
        "Q: What compelled him to settle in Germany?",
        "A: Nothing compelled him, except some circumstances. His son was born soon after\nhe and his wife came to Berlin. They occupied a bunk in a common room in the\nDP camp without privacy and conveniences. He managed to find an apartment in\nthe city; he began to work and soon opened a clothing retail business. His\nchildren were born and raised there. While he didn\u2019t become rich there, he made\na decent living. I have been there many times in the course of these past forty\nyears. His son graduated from the University of Jerusalem and did graduate work\nin Amsterdam and Brussels. He has a responsible position with the Common\nMarket Commission in Brussels, and leads a good life in Belgium. My niece\nstudied law at the University of Berlin and became an attorney. She works in\nLuxembourg where her husband, also an attorney, works for the European\nParliament in Luxembourg. Berlin has a viable Jewish community and it is an\ninteresting city to live in. My sister-in-law died three years ago and my brother\nhas been deeply affected by her death; they were married for forty-three years.\nLet me return, if I may, to my experiences as a new immigrant in New York City.\nMy uncle was working in the apparel industry and his boss gave him a chance to\ntrain me a as a Sewing machine operator of ladies\u2019 dresses. It was a skilled trade,\nfor we made the entire dress, however, I never accepted dressmaking as my career\nobjective.\nI didn\u2019t speak a word of English when I arrived from Europe. I was schooled in\nPolish and Yiddish and acquired a reasonable knowledge of German during the\nwar. I started by going to evening school several times a week to learn English.\nAt the end of the school year, the teacher asked me to go to the principal\u2019s office\nand take a test, the passing of which entitled me to an elementary school diploma.\nIn the fall of that year, I registered as a student in one of Manhattan\u2019s two evening\nhigh schools. New York City operated evening high schools enabling adults to\nacquire a high school education. The school I went to in lower Manhattan had\nexcellent teachers. I started by going two nights a week and taking English and\nhistory classes. After a year or so, I realized that if I contemplate entering\ncollege, I had better buckle down and take my high school work more seriously. I\n25\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbegan to attend five nights a week, four hours each night. It was hard, going\ndirectly from work to school every evening from 6:15 to 10:15, followed by a\nlong trip home by bus and subway. Homework consumed the rest of the evening\nand most of the weekend, and I still had to get up early to go to work. Just before\ngraduation, I took the New York City College Entrance Examination and was\naccepted as a matriculated full-time student at the uptown campus of CCNY. My\nuncle\u2019s assistance permitted me the luxury of being a full-time student without\nhaving to work. If I had to do both, I don\u2019t believe that I would have mustered the\ncourage and the energy to go on.\nI graduated from CCNY after three and one-half years with a B.A. in Economics\nand applied to graduate schools at Columbia University and the London School of\nEconomics. That was in 1954. I was accepted at both schools and settled on\nColumbia University. After one and a half years at Columbia, I took the U.S.\nCivil Service entrance examination. Several weeks later, I was called by the U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics for an interview and was offered a position as a labor\neconomist.\nThat was my start with the U.S. Department of Labor. The job was interesting\nand there was a lot of travel in the first years. After two years on the job, I got\nmarried. I met my wife at my friend\u2019s house. She was an excellent student,\ngraduating from Hunter College at the age of twenty and completing her Ph.D. in\neconomics at twenty-three. She died of kidney failure at twenty-five after three\nand a half years of marriage. At the time, there was not much that could be done\nabout nephritis. Kidney dialysis was still a thing of the future.",
        "Q: So you married her though, after you started working for the government?",
        "A: Yes! I began working for the government in 1956, and we married in 1958. She\ndied at the end of 1961.\nIn early 1962, I took a leave of absence from my job for six months and went to\nBerlin. The Department was very decent to me. They realized that I needed time\noff and didn\u2019t mind giving me half a year\u2019s leave without pay. From Berlin I\ntraveled to Israel and later on to Scandinavia. Several months after my return, I\nwas assigned to Cleveland, Ohio, to assist at the setting up of a new regional\noffice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in that city. A former colleague of mine\nfrom New York who had transferred to the Chicago office at the beginning of the\nyear, was the one delegated to Cleveland to set up the program which I assisted.\nFor the next holiday weekend, he invited me to come home with him to Chicago\nand visit with his family.\nDuring my stay in Chicago, I got in touch with Jeanne, my present wife, who at\nthe time was completing her PhD dissertation in psychology at the University of\nMichigan in Ann Arbor, but resided and worked as a psychologist at a hospital in\nChicago. We attended City College at the same time, and had known each other\n26\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfor many years. We met and continued to meet on subsequent trips. We married\none and a half years later, after she completed her Ph.D. and returned to New\nYork. That was in 1964. Our son, Marc, was born in 1965. In 1967 I decided to\ntransfer to Washington, for I had enough of travel assignments which are a\nconsequence of work in regional offices. Our son, David was born here in 1969.\nWe have lived here for 25 years now.\nAfter nearly 35 years of service with the Department of Labor, I retired two years\nago.\nIn a nutshell, you have my life\u2019s story on tape, 1.e., up to now.",

        "A: I am Philip Goldstein, formerly Fishel Goldstein, born in Radom, Poland on\nJanuary 12, 1922. I was the youngest of five children, four brothers and one\nsister, born to a family of artisans. My father was a custom tailor, his brother was\na furrier, his father, uncles and cousins were furriers. I started parochial school\nwhen I was about three years old. While accompanying my mother, who took\nlunch to my brothers in cheder, I didn\u2019t want to go home, and that\u2019s how my\nparochial education started.",
        "A: No, no .A cheder. At the age of about six or seven, I entered a Jewish secular\nschool which had a double curriculum, a complete Polish curriculum plus a Judaic\ncurriculum of Hebrew, Yiddish, the Pentateuch, Rashi, Jewish history and so on.\nI was there up to the age of ten when I entered a Polish public school for Jewish\nchildren. I graduated at fourteen, which was the end of compulsory education\nunder the Polish school system. At that age I started to work as an apprentice in\nmy father\u2019s tailor shop. My heart was not in it, for I would rather spend my time\nreading books, and I did spend a lot of time reading in the beautiful park we had\nin the city of Radom. My sister had her own dressmaking shop and my oldest\nbrother worked for my father. My father also employed a journeyman in addition\nto myself as an apprentice. The next brother was a printer; he was an active\nmember and leader in the Zionist movement, Hashomer Hatzair, in Radom. At\nthe age of 20, he left Radom and went to Kibbutz Hachshara, which was the\npreparation for kibbutz life in Palestine.",
        "A: The parents were religious. My mother was very religious. My father was\nreligious in the sense that he prayed every day and went to Sabbath services at his\ncongregation and so on, but that was the extent of his religious practices. He was\nobservant; the children were not. We were all secularly inclined. However, we\nfollowed our father to services on high holidays, and I did carry his tallith to the\n1\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncongregation every Saturday until I was about 12 years or 13. That was about the\nend of it. After my Bar Mitzvah, my religious education came to an end.",
        "A: Oh, yes. You hardly found any Jewish homes that weren\u2019t kosher. That was part\nof a way of life. We never ate out. Even though our city was fairly sizeable for\nPoland, having about 100,000 people, and a varied industrial base, nevertheless,\nthe idea of eating out was not a way of life as we knew it in the West. I left my\nhometown at the age of 20 when I was taken to Auschwitz, and up to that time I\nhad never eaten out in a restaurant. We had eaten out at parties, at other people\u2019s\nhomes, but never at a restaurant. My next brother was employed in a commercial\nestablishment. He was the only one who, at the end of 1939, escaped to the\neastern part of Poland, which was occupied by the Soviets.\nMy mother was the oldest in a family of eight children and my father was the\nsecond in line in a family of six children. All together, our family consisted of, in\naddition to our own household, of eleven households, with eleven uncles and\naunts, their respective spouses and with 25 first cousins. One of my mother\u2019s\nbrothers lived in the U.S.A. since the 1920\u2019s. Of the entire family in Europe, only\nthree first cousins survived, and all three came from the same household. Of the\nremaining ten households, not a trace was left. From our own household, in\naddition to myself, my brother, who spent most of the war years in the gulag, in\nthe Artic, returned after the war. He lives in Europe now.",
        "A: Yes, yes. My brother was one of the leaders in the Zionist youth movement. I\njoined this group when I was about ten years old. My chief hobby, from very\nearly on, was reading. We had a very extensive library, the second largest in\ntown, which was a part of our organization. It was called the I.L. Peretz Library\nand I exchanged books there every time that the library was open, which was\nthree or four times a week. I stayed up reading to the early hours and used a\nkerosene lamp or candle instead of the ceiling light so as not to disturb my two\nbrothers who slept in the same room.",
        "A: No, mostly Polish, some were Yiddish. I preferred reading in Polish, but I was\narticulate in Yiddish as well; however, there weren\u2019t as many Yiddish books to\nchoose from. We read mostly Polish, but our spoken language was mostly\nYiddish. Yiddish was a living medium then, and not the linguistic curiosity to\nwhich it has been reduced in our day.\n2\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well, you could get everything you wanted. I read mostly Polish translations of\nFrench, German, Russian and American literature, as well as some Polish and\nYiddish works in the original.\nIn 1939, at the outbreak of the war, my older brother, Moshe, was mobilized.\nSince he had served in the Polish army and was released in March of 1939, he\nwas subject to the general mobilization. He reported to his regiment and was\nlucky that he didn\u2019t become a POW. He was able to escape capture as a POW\nand return home six weeks after he left. Of course, we didn\u2019t know what had\nhappened to him throughout this period. Subsequently, he had become a very\nactive member in the underground Hashomer Hatzair movement in Radom, and\nour home became the contact place for couriers from Moscow. Polish ladies, as\nwell as members of the Hashomer Hatzair leadership in Warsaw, came. Mordecai\nAnielewicz, the leader of the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto, who perished in\n1943, was our guest during the first and second Passover seder in 1941. He\nstayed in a furnished room establishment in our courtyard during a mission to\nRadom, having traveled on Polish papers from Warsaw via Lodz and\nCzestochowa. He didn\u2019t look Jewish and had no trouble traveling on Polish\npapers. While in Auschwitz, I didn\u2019t know who was in the leadership of the\nWarsaw Ghetto uprising. Even those rounded up from the ruins of the Warsaw\nGhetto, who came to Auschwitz-Birkenau via Majdanek in the early summer of\n1943, had no idea of who was in the leadership. It was only after the war when I\ncame across a monograph about the uprising, and recognized Anielewicz from the\npicture on the front page, that I found out about his role. There were other people\nfrom Warsaw who came to our house who were involved in the first armed action\nin the Warsaw Ghetto in January 1943, Josef Kaplan among them.\nMy brother, Moshe was taken in the early morning hours of the 28\" of April 1942\nand executed. I was in hiding. My entire family was put under house arrest and I\nhad to surrender. By the delayed action of this process, I escaped a bullet in the\nneck. I was taken to headquarters of the security service and put into a large shed\nthat was full of Jews from our ghetto who had been there since the early morning\nhours. We were shipped out the next morning, April 29, 1942, and arrived in\nAuschwitz past midnight.",
        "A: Yes. I was the youngest. Every able-bodied Jewish male from the age of 16 to\n60, had to work at least one day on assigned places of work that the Jewish\ncommunity, and later on the ghetto community government, administered. They\nhad to send out forced laborers so to speak, to various posts that the Germans had\ndesignated; military posts, and a variety of other assignments,, doing all sorts of\n3\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwork -- unloading, loading, digging ditches, you name it. There was hardly any\nkind of work that we weren\u2019t assigned to do. Being the youngest, I took the place\nof my father as well as of my older brother, so I would end up working almost\ntwo or three days a week. I didn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather do it than have my father, who\nwas in his mid-to-late fifties and ill, do hard labor. My oldest brother had to help\nmy father so I took his place as well. In 1940, that is August of 1940, almost all\nable-bodied young Jewish males received orders to report for shipment to forced\nlabor camps on the German-Soviet border in the district of Lublin to dig anti-tank\nfortifications. I was the only one in the family who was caught in the net. It\nturned out that if you didn\u2019t report, you simply didn\u2019t go; they didn\u2019t come after\nyou. But if you did report, you were trapped. Several hundred of us left Radom,\nperhaps four or five hundred men. Altogether there were thousands of young\nJewish men from various parts of the country congregated in several forced labor\ncamps stretched along a section of frontier land that ran between two rivers, the\nBug and the San. Our camp was in Cieszanow, where we dug anti-tank\nfortifications along a given section of frontier. That was my introduction to\nforced labor under SS rule. We left dead inmates at the work site every day.\nThey were simply shot at random and buried in the woods and covered up with\nmoss, so that one couldn\u2019t even find their graves, for there were no markers left.\nThis went on until about the end of October when suddenly we were marched out\nof Cieszanow and taken to Belzec, from where, by rail, we were transported to\nKrasnik, in the District of Lublin. We spent the whole night in a courtyard where\nthe Jewish community\u2019s council was located. I will never forget the kindness of\nthe town\u2019s Jewish people who practically showered us with food and drink. In the\nafternoon we were marched out, under guard, to the town of Annapol and handed\nover to a German private firm to build highways. We were not under any military\nsupervision, but just worked as civilians. We discovered soon that if you go away\nand don\u2019t come back, you\u2019re not missed, Several of us decided to start on our\nway home the next morning. We sold whatever clothes we could spare in order to\nget a few zlotys for food and passage money for the trip. We marched 16\nkilometers that morning and crossed a guarded bridge that spanned the Vistula\nRiver, and within two hours were in the next town. We spent the rest of that day\ngoing from small town to town, riding in horse-drawn carts belonging to Jews\nengaged in either transporting people or goods. After darkness, we found\nourselves as \u201cpassengers\u201d on such a cart, sharing the space with a load of grain\nthat the owner smuggled into the city of Radom, traveling through forests all\nnight. Not only were we in violation of the after-darkness curfew, but also sitting\non \u201ccontraband\u201d. Had we been stopped, 1t would have meant the end of us all.\nWe arrived in Radom the next morning after an absence of two and a half months.\nThat was my introduction to camp life, and in a way it helped me later on. When\nI arrived at Auschwitz, unlike many others, I was not totally surprised by what\nawaited us, even although the level of raw brutality in Auschwitz-Birkenau was\nuniquely evil. In retrospect, from what I have learned in the past century, I can\nstate without hesitation, that in the entire universe of evil that was Nazi-occupied\nEurope, there was no place that could match the hell of Birkenau in it\u2019s first year\nof existence. We walked the three kilometers from Auschwitz to Birkenau on\n4\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 1, 1942, and there were one thousand young and middle- aged men in our\ntransport. Within one month most of them were dead. By the end of about two\nmonths, most of those still alive were the ones who survived the camp -- there\nwere fifteen of us. Allow me to track back a bit in time -- I have a reason for\ndoing so. In early 1942 I came down with typhus. There were many typhus cases\nin the ghetto. Normally typhus is survivable by young, healthy people, even\nwithout any medical help as long as there is water to drink, because one can\u2019t eat\nanyway in a State of very high fever. I had developed some complications and\nhemorrhaged all night. We lived in the ghetto under strict curfew conditions and\nhad no access to doctors or drugstores. My brother risked his life to go outside\nthe ghetto to an apothecary in order to get some medication, which turned out to\nbe the wrong one, and it nearly poisoned me. The doctor who attended me was\nsick and he didn\u2019t know the seriousness of the problem. My brother, together\nwith one of our neighbors, searched for a doctor half the night until they found\none. He realized that I was in a bad way for it was the third or fourth case in\ntown that winter of typhus with such complications, and no one survived the\nhemorrhaging. He plainly said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do, if you have some\ncognac, give it to him.\u201d He thought I was out of it, but I was still conscious and I\nremember the stupidity of his suggestion. This was a ghetto in Poland in 1942\nand he expected us to have, or be able to get, cognac in the middle of the night. In\nthe morning my doctor came and ordered a transfusion but there was no way to\nfind a donor who had my blood type. I was supposed to be taken to the hospital\nfor the procedure, but luckily someone decided that I couldn\u2019t possibly survive\nthe trip, since it was a very cold winter day, and my blood pressure was extremely\nlow. Instead, the ghetto hospital sent a surgeon, accompanied by a laboratory\ntechnician who used some hand held dish for typing the blood of several\nvolunteers, including my brother Moshe. I remember the technician telling the\nsurgeon that none of the blood tested matched mine. Nevertheless the surgeon\ndecided to use my brother\u2019s blood for there was no time to lose and he told my\nparents that the risk must be accepted. Transfusions were given directly from\ndonor to recipient via some tube contraption connecting their veins. My parents\nwere standing over my bed knowing very well that any moment now, should my\nbody reject the donor\u2019s blood, their youngest son will be dead within minutes.\nThe doctor kept asking me, how I felt and I said, I feel warm. That\u2019s a good sign,\nhe responded. He finished the transfusion and I was saved. He came back eight\ndays later to take out the stitches and he couldn\u2019t believe his own eyes that I was\nalive. I still have the marks of those stitches on the inside of my right arm. He\nsuggested that I come to the hospital after I get well to be examined thoroughly t\nfind out how I managed to survive that ordeal. It was the same brother whose\nblood saved me, who was shot dead two months later, when I was taken to\nAuschwitz. As it turned out, had I not had typhus at home and developed\nimmunity, there would have been no chance in the world for me to have survived\nBirkenau in 1942.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n(S.B.) Did you ever consider escaping rather than returning to the ghetto, after you had\nbeen in the labor camp?",
        "A: When we were in the labor camp, 1.e., in the fall of 1940, there were no ghettos\nyet in most of the General Government of Poland. The ghettos there were formed\nin the spring of 1941. Except, of course, for the city of Lodz, where the ghetto\nwas formed in early 1940, because Lodz was incorporated into the Reich, (1.e. the\ncity of Lodz and the entire province) and the city of Warsaw, where the ghetto\nwas formed in October or November of 1940. Yes, it was a good question. Some\npeople escaped, it was not too difficult to escape across the border which\nconsisted of a simple barbed wire which wasn\u2019t electrified. Of course, if an\ninmate was caught before he reached the no-man\u2019s land he would be shot. On the\nway to work, at some points, we almost brushed against the barbed wire fences.\nWe saw the Soviet guards patrolling. Some officers came close to the fence and\ntalked to us. I remember there was one officer who spoke Yiddish to us He was a\nSoviet Jewish captain. I wanted to escape, some of my friends did. They were all\ncaught by the Soviet guards, every single one of them. Once you escaped across\nthe fence, you had to cross a stretch of no-man\u2019s land of perhaps 50 feet of terrain\nto reach the Soviet fence. In most instances, the German guards couldn\u2019t see,\nwhen one forced the fence, either by crawling under it, or by spreading the strands\nof wire and going through it. The guards were too thinly spread out. However,\nthe escapees were spotted while walking or running through the neutral no-man\u2019s\nland. Since the guards couldn\u2019t shoot at them, they fired rounds in the air, thereby\nalerting the Soviet border guards who apprehended them. Even though, the\nSoviets knew that the escapees were Jewish inmates of forced labor camps,\nrunning for their lives from the Nazis, they were treated as if they were spies.\nEvery single one of them was interrogated in the nearest town of Rava Ruska,\nimprisoned and eventually sent to the northern gulags. Ironically, through this act\nof callous and unconscionable mistreatment at the hands of the Soviet police\napparatus, most of the escapees were saved; for had they been left in the Soviet-\noccupied Polish territories, they would have been killed a year later when the\nNazis invaded the Soviet Union and occupied those territories. I wanted to escape\nfrom the labor camp to join my brother Jechiel, who at the time lived in Lvov, no\nmore than about 100 km south from our camp. I had no notion under what\nghastly conditions he lived in Lvov as a refugee. However, I received a postcard\nfrom home in which my brother Moshe informed me that Jechiel sent a postcard\nhome from some rail station on the old Polish-Soviet border. In the card he told\nus that he is in transport, forcibly evacuated from Lvov, and going either to the\nFar East or to the Caucasus. Well, he wound up in the far North, hundreds of\nkilometers north of Archangelsk. That postcard was dated July 1940. In the\nsummer of 1940, the Soviet authorities rounded up all Polish-Jewish refugees\nunder their jurisdiction who did not apply for Soviet citizenship, and shipped\nthem to the northern gulags. That covered the vast majority of refugees. Once I\nfound out that my brother was no longer in Lvov, I had no great desire to risk an\nescape attempt to face an unknown fate alone. I was too young then. Whether I\nwould have been better off or not is hard to say. The chances are that I had as\n6\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngood a chance to survive as to perish there. About half the people perished in the\nSoviet camps. However, I didn\u2019t escape and returned home to face the real test of\nfending for myself only one and a half years later, when I wound up in Birkenau.\nThe last time I saw my parents and my family was on April 28, 1942. The\nliquidation of the ghettos in Poland an the annihilation of the Jewish population\nthere began in the summer of 1942. In some areas, it started earlier. So about\nthree or four months after I was shipped to Auschwitz and my brother executed,\nmy family, that is my father, my mother, my sister and the entire extended family\nwere shipped to and annihilated at Treblinka. Treblinka became the killing field\nof the Jews from the ghettos of the towns and cities in the districts of Warsaw and\nRadom. In addition, of course, to devouring transports of Jews from all over\nEurope. My personal saga began with my arrival at Birkenau. My experience at\nthe main camp in Auschwitz lasted only about thirty-six hours, enough time for\nthe conversion of civilians into prisoners. But Birkenau was hell. Time was not\nconceived in terms of months or years but in terms of days. If one survived the\nday, one achieved the unlikely. If one survived a month, one achieved the\nimpossible. When new prisoners arrived in the fall of 1942, and I told them that I\nhad been there six months, they found it unbelievable, because most new arrivals,\nby the time they got oriented and realized where they were, which usually took a\nday or two, became aware of the fact that they won\u2019t survive too long. Later on, it\nbecame a little easier but in 1942 was an indescribable hell. We didn\u2019t even know\nupon arrival that Birkenau had just started to become the crown jewel of the Nazi\nkilling machine of European Jewry. It took us several months to find out exactly\nwhat was going on right there.",
        "A: No, no. We didn\u2019t know. A couple of weeks after we arrived, some strong\npeople from our transport were selected to work in the Sonderkomando, but we\nhad no idea what was going on. We thought that they were put to work burning\nthe bodies of prisoners who were killed or died in the camp, since every day there\nwere heaps of dead bodies in front of each barrack. A barrack that counted twelve\nhundred prisoners on Sunday would be half empty by the next Sunday. They\nwould usually combine the contingents of the two half empty barracks into one,\nand use the empty barrack for a new transport. We didn\u2019t know that there are\ntransports arriving from the outside world, 1.e., from ghettos, and internment\ncamps in Western Europe, bringing families of men, women and children. It took\nus months before we realized that. It was well concealed and there\u2019s no wonder\nthat the surrounding world didn\u2019t know, because we, who were that much closer,\ndidn\u2019t know at first. But once we found out, we understood where the trucks\nfilled with people, were going to. For about a year, in fact almost exactly a year,\nfrom March \u201942 until March \u00b043, there were no crematoria in Birkenau. The\ngassing took place in an abandoned farmer\u2019s cottage, the inside of which I had a\nchance to see in 1944, while the burial and later on, the burning of the bodies took\nplace in pits adjacent to the cottage and surrounded by woods.\n7\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThe trucks were loaded at the Auschwitz railroad camp and traveled the two miles\nto the gas chamber, passing the road that surrounded the Birkenau camp complex.\nWe sometimes saw the trucks from inside the camp, and occasionally passed them\nby on the road on our way to work. Most of my work, and the work of people\naround me, was involved in enlarging the camp. It was an enormous universe of\ncamps which could, by the middle of 1944, accommodate close to a quarter of a\nmillion prisoners. My job throughout the spring and early summer of 1942 was\ndigging the foundations for crematorium one. By mid-summer of 1942, they had\nsome crazy idea of separating a group of about 800 young Jewish prisoners, from\n16 to 25 years of age, and forming a masonry school to teach us how to become\nbricklayers. I don\u2019t know what they had in mind for the plan turned into a fiasco.\nNot one of us eventually worked as a bricklayer. Many of the 800 did of typhus\nduring the summer anyway, 1.e., they were selected to go to the gas chamber after\ncontracting typhus, but the few who survived were helped by the fact that they\ndidn\u2019t have to work outside in the heat of summer. With the rations that we\nreceived, compounded by the lack of water, hard labor, sleepless nights and\nbeatings, one did not last long. We were lucky that during a crucial period in the\nsummer, we were indoors in barracks receiving instruction on how to lay bricks.\nBut it didn\u2019t prevent the SS from performing selections among us. They took\nplace every week. Those who looked weak or showed signs of illness or had\nabscesses or scars were selected to go to the gas chamber. By the fall, the\nmasonry school (Maurerschule) ceased to exist. Some of the remaining\nyoungsters were sent to Auschwitz to work, and I was among those assigned to a\nwork commando in Birkenau. The same kapo for whom I worked earlier returned\nfrom the Auschwitz sick bay, where he was confined with typhus, and was given\na new work crew to dig foundations and help in the construction of crematoria\nthree and four. He recognized me and several others, and we became part of a\ngroup of 100 workers who worked for him until the spring of 1943. Only a\nhandful among the original one hundred survived the winter. Our last job under\nhis command was to dig the foundations for the sauna. One day in late April, I\nhad near fatal accident. I was hit by an empty truck. At the time, German tractor\ncabs are usually pulled two or three trailers. After the bricks were unloaded, I\nclosed the side lid of the first trailer but the German truck driver did not see me\nand he started the engine. I was caught between the first and second trailers and\nthrown into the ditch. Had I fallen under the wheels, I would have been dead or\ncompletely maimed. I was so stunned that I couldn\u2019t get up after regaining\nconsciousness. They improvised a kind of stretcher from some boards and carried\nme back to camp. Now carrying back dead or near-dead bodies from work sites\nto the camp was a common sight. Each work detail that returned from work to\ncam invariably carried one or more dead bodies but they were stretched out. Here\nI wasn\u2019t dead or near dead. I simply couldn\u2019t walk. I was sitting up on this\nmakeshift stretcher and looked like a Roman proconsul being carried by four\npeople on their shoulders. There was only one witness who remembered that very\nunusual sight; he died in Canada a few years ago. I was lowered down in front of\nmy barrack where the whole contingent was assembled for roll call, and permitted\nby the barrack elder to sit on the ground while the counting took place.\n8\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAfterwards, I was picked up by a strong Belgian fellow who carried me to my\nthird tier bunk. The next morning, with the support of two men, I made it to the\ndoctor to be examined. If one didn\u2019t go out to work, or report sick, one\u2019s life was\nin mortal danger. There was no third choice -- it was either work or death. The\nkapo came with me, because it happened on his watch so he was sympathetic. By\nthat time he had known me for about a year and in some way acted as my\nprotector. He helped me to the sick bay and we met the chief camp doctor who\nwas a Polish prisoner and former colonel of the Polish army. He should have\nbeen tried and convicted after the war as a war criminal. I thought that he was\ndead but discovered only a couple of years ago that he was tried in Poland\nsometime after the war and was let go for lack of evidence, He would simply\nassault patients who came to him to be examined and he also conducted selections\non his own, sending Jewish prisoners to the gas chambers. His name was\nZenkteler. He treated me more or less, correctly. He examined me and said\nthere\u2019s nothing he can do and that there is nothing wrong with me. But since I\ncame and he knew that I didn\u2019t try to shirk work because the kapo was with me,\nhe gave me a couple of days of what was referred to in German as schonung,\nmeaning rest, at the sick bay, which was barrack no. 7. That barrack was an\nassembly point for Jewish prisoners who reported sick throughout the entire week.\nOn Tuesdays, the trucks would come and take most of them to the gas chambers.\nFrom the very beginning, barrack no. 7 served that function, 1.e., as a way station\nfrom camp to the gas cambers. The moment I crossed the camp road (I\nremembered it as a road, but when I visited there this past September, I realized\nthat it was more like a wide path than a road) and passed one of the little earth and\nbrick bridges that connected the main camp road to the respective sides of the\ncamp which were separated from the road by ditches; something happened to me:\nI suddenly became able to stand on my own feet and asked my two companion,\nwho helped me, to let me walk to no. 7 by myself. In retrospect, it 1s obvious to\nme that my inability to walk was a psychosomatic phenomenon. It was a result of\nthe shock received during the accident. My sudden ability to stand on my own\nfeet must have resulted from the realization that I had better not walk in sick to\nbarrack no. 7. I met people there whom I had known since the beginning, a\ncouple of them came with me in 1942, and they worked there as orderlies. The\nnext morning, I was discharged, and a few days later was transferred to barrack\nno. 16 and thereby gained the assignment to work in the \u201cCanada\u201d work detail.\nLuckily my work was inside the barracks sorting goods and I didn\u2019t have to go to\nthe rail siding to meet arriving transports. That work ended after four weeks\nwhen I developed an infection on my face and was admitted to the sick bay in\nbarrack no. 8. The fact that I was admitted to sickbay no. 8 and not to no. 7 was\nin itself a break for which my cousin was responsible.",
        "A: In early 1943, there were two sick bays in the old camp of Birkenau, in addition to\nthe main infirmary to which Jewish prisoners had no access. Of the former two,\n9\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\none was barrack no. 7, which I described above, and the other was barrack no. 8\nwhich admitted some Jewish prisoners. To get me there required a little influence\nin the right place. Although my cousin was surgeon there, he couldn\u2019t simply\nadmit me. I had to be assigned there by the camp\u2019s administrative office, and\nthat\u2019s where his connections helped. Patients there weren\u2019t subject t regular\nselections to the gas chambers and usually stayed there until pronounced fit to\nreturn to the regular barracks. He succeeded 1n treating me for my infection, and\nafter three weeks, I got my first shave, but my face was still full of scarred tissue.\nIt took more than two years before the scar tissue completely disappeared. A few\ndays after transferring out of the sick bay, the old camp for men in Birkenau was\nevacuated and it became part of the enlarged female camp. The men moved to\none of the newly finished wooden barracks camps, called \u201cD Lager\u201d or Camp D.\nThat happened in June of 1943. For the next nine months or so, I went from work\ndetail to work detail, including work inside the barrack, until in April 1944, I was\nrecruited to work in the \u201cSauna\u201d -- the more correct designation being disinfection\nfacility, where civilians were transformed into prisoners. I worked there from\nApril of 1944 until November when the size of the crew operating the facility was\ndrastically reduced and the surplus sent back to Camp D. Birkenau was no longer\nthe destination of incoming transports nor of prisoners transferred from other\ncamps. The last victims of its killing machine were transports from Slovakia and\nTheresienstadt Ghetto, in addition to Birkenau inmates whose fate was sealed by\nthe last mass selections that took place in the fall of 1944. The \u201csauna\u201d facility\nabutted the rod leading from the railroad ramp to the crematorium complex no. 3\nand 4, and we had the unfortunate and heart rending experience of being witness\nto daily processions of thousands upon thousands of men, women and children\nmarching past us to the gas chambers. The marching columns were no more than\nabout 200 yards from their destination, but what 1s still etched in my memory is\nthat the faces of the about-to-be murdered people betrayed only fatigue, perhaps\nconfusion, but no comprehension of their imminent doom. Between April and the\nend of summer, several hundred thousand Hungarian Jews plus countless others\nfrom various parts of Europe, walked this stretch of road without realizing that it\nis their last walk.",
        "A: I remember far too many episodes but I cannot think of any specific one which\nwould, or should, take precedence over all others, hence, the choice is difficult,\nespecially in an extemporaneous setting. We could sit here for days and tape\nwithout a stop, and not exhaust the reservoir of my recollections of this period, let\nalone the well of accumulated experiences of my three year sojourn in Birkenau.\nBy way of concession to your inquiry, allow me to add the following: what has\nburdened my memory foremost, and is forever etched in my consciousness,\ndespite the lapse of nearly half a century, I the daily procession of thousands of\n10\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\npeople, marching past the \u201csauna\u201d on their way to the gas chambers, and the sight\nof smoke coming out of the crematoria chimneys shortly afterwards.\nHowever, one occurrence which has since become grist for the mills of Holocaust\nresearchers, namely the uprising of the Birkenau Sonderkomando (crematoria\ncrews) in October of 1944, took place within a stone\u2019s throw of the \u201csauna\u201d\nfacility and I would like to register my recollection of the event within the\nframework of this interview.",
        "A: No! To my knowledge there were no Greek Jews among them, or at most, very\nfew. The old guard, 1.e., the cadres consisted mainly of Polish Jews, plus some\nFrench Jews and others. During the late spring of 1944, newly arrived Hungarian\nJews were conscripted to work in the Sonderkomando because the size of the\ncrematoria work details almost tripled at that time. From its very inception in the\nspring of 1942, the Birkenau Sonderkomando crews were subject to periodic\nliquidations. The first total liquidation took place in December 1942, when the\napproximately 500 strong crew was murdered. The first job of the new crew,\nselected the evening before when the Birkenau camp was subject to a strict\ncurfew, was to dispose of the bodies of their predecessors.\nThe next sizeable liquidation took place in November 1943 when a part of the\nSonderkomando was transported to Majdanek, allegedly for work in the\ncrematorium there, but once in Majdanek, they were put to death. The events\nleading to their death in the Majdanek gas chamber were confirmed by members\nof the Majdanek crematorium crew when they arrived in Birkenau in July 1944,\nafter Majdanek was evacuated.\nBy early fall of 1944, when Birkenau no longer functioned as a mass killing\nmachine, the SS began the process of thinning out the ranks of the\nSonderkomando. The first victims were several hundred men from the crew of\ncrematorium no. 3. They were brought to the sauna for disinfection and that was\nthe first time that I came face to face with, and talked to, members of the\nSonderkomando. They were told that they were being transferred to another\ncamp. The disinfection process was used as a subterfuge to lull them into\nbelieving the deception. They weren\u2019t deceived, and were aware of their\nsituation. From the sauna they were taken to Auschwitz where they were put to\ndeath in the old gas chamber. When, on October 6, the order to assemble came\nfor the rest of the crematorium no, 3 crew, they refused and barricaded themselves\ninside the crematorium living quarters. They put their straw mattresses to the\ntorch and exchanged fire with the SS guards outside, using the few small weapons\nin their possession. The guards pretty soon received reinforcements from the SS\nbarracks that were located not far away. When it was over, crematorium no. 3\nremained a gutted shell and the several hundred prisoners inside, all dead.\n11\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThe burning of the facility and the sound of the firefight was construed by the\ncrew of crematorium no. | as a signal that the expected uprising has begun. After\nthrowing their German kapo into the burning furnace, they cut the barbed wire\nthat enclosed the crematorium and dispersed in the direction of the Vistula River.\nThe SS gave chase and every single one of the several hundred prisoners was\nhunted down and killed. Several days later the crew of crematorium no. 2 was\ngassed and all that remained of the approximately 1,500 strong Birkenau\nSonderkomando was the crematorium no. 4 crew of less than 100 men, who at the\ntime were barracked within the main camp.\nFollowing the events described above, crematoria nos. 1,2 and 3 were blown up\nand dismembered. Crematorium no. 4 was left intact until January 18, 1945, the\nday of the final evacuation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp complex. An\nattempt was made to separate the remaining members of the Sonderkomando, but\nin the haste of the overall and sudden evacuation, they managed to get\nintermingled with the general camp population and share their fate and survival\nchances in the ensuing months ahead. I was told after the war that about 30 or 40\nof them survived the ordeal of evacuation and death marches.\nCrematorium no. 4 was blown up on January 18, and I subsequently learned that\nthe demolition was only partly successful.\nI myself was assigned to a work detail in late November \u2014 early December, 1944,\nto break up the concrete floor of the crematorium 3 gas chamber. We used\nhammers and pickaxes for the job. During our work, we found many pliers that\nwere used by the crematoria crews to pull out gold teeth from the mouths of the\ngassed victims. The unbelievable circumstances of this assignment did not escape\nme at the time for I was the only one among the prisoners in that work detail who\nworked at digging the foundation and at the construction of the very same\ncrematorium two years before, and lived long enough to be present at, and\nparticipate in, it\u2019s demolition.\nI recall one incident during the uprising which in retrospect fills me with terror.\nWhile the road outside the sauna building was teeming with SS guards and\nofficers running on foot and on any conveyance they could find including\nbicycles, in the direction of crematorium | where the breakout took place, we in\nthe sauna received the dreaded order, \u201cAlle Juden eintreten\u2019\u2019, 1.e., all Jews fall-in.\nWe assembled in the courtyard, separated from the non-Jewish members of the\nwork crew, and watched with horror, and envy, the satisfaction on the faces of the\nlatter that they are lucky enough not to be Jews and not to have to share our\nforeboding of doom, and doom was exactly what we expected at the time. We\nnever found out the reason for our being ordered to assemble, but were greatly\nrelieved when we were dismissed later on. It was the last time in my\nincarceration that I was subject to that blood-chilling fear produced by an order\nfor Jews to assemble separately.\n12\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI went back to Birkenau this past September, my first visit since I left the camp in\nJanuary 1945, and I was overwhelmed by the desolateness of the place. Where\ncrematorium no. | stood, there are only a few slabs of concrete sticking out of the\nground and a commemorative plaque affixed to a stone telling what took place\nthere. Only the brick barracks of the original camp remain while the hundreds of\nwood barracks were allowed to disintegrate or taken apart for firewood. The\nbrick chimneys of the latte stood out ghostlike and are the only remainder of a\npast to which they bear witness.\nI was accompanied on my trip by a friend from Warsaw. It was during the late\nmorning, on a Saturday, and the two of us were the only ones there. In that huge\ncomplex of former camp there wasn\u2019t another human being in sight. There was\nan eeriness in the absolute silence that pervaded this greatest of killing fields of all\ntime. The eeriness became more intense for me when I juxtaposed this silence of\nthe grave against my recollections of the teeming scores of thousands of\nprisoners, who at any time between 1942 and 1945, occupied these grounds, not\nto mention the millions who never set foot inside the barbed wire confines but\nwalked, or were trucked, on the nearby road from the railroad ramp to the gas\nchambers.\nOn the way back to Cracow we stopped at the Auschwitz camp which is about\ntwo miles from Birkenau. The parking lot was full; there were bus loads with\nvisitors, and the cafeteria was busy. The place projected an aura of a busy shrine,\nwhile Birkenau has been allowed to go to seed and its physical plant is so\ndisintegrated that it is beyond repair, and certainly beyond recognition.\nThere is no comparison between the two camps in the way they are kept and\nmaintained as Polish national museums. In that connection, it is apropos to reflect\non the difference between the two places when they functioned as Nazi\nconcentration camps. Auschwitz was not unlike many Nazi camps within\nGermany. The difference was only in degree, 1.e., more cruelty, more harshness,\nmore of everything evil, but in its basic essentials it resembled concentration\ncamps like Dachau, Buchenwald, etc. However, Birkenau belonged to a different\nuniverse of evil. It its operating mode, and in its basic objectives that unique hell\ncould be justly described as having been a slaughterhouse rather than a\nconcentration camp.",
        "A: In April, the so-called winter issue of clothing had to be surrendered. A prisoner\nrisked his life if he wore any such article past the due time. April was not spring,\nyet, in this part of the world. I fact, I was never so cold in my life as I was in May\nof 1942. I slept on the upper bunk and the wind came in from the open rafters\nunder the roof, and we had no bedding or blankets and slept in our day clothing,\nwhich consisted of a shirt and a cotton blouse of sorts. If one was lucky enough\n13\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand worked at a construction site where cement was used, the empty bags were\nconverted into undershirts by cutting out holes at the sides and top and worn\nunder the garment as an added layer against the wind and cold. Again, you wore\nit at your peril for, if caught, the retribution was merciless. The combination of\nexposure; sleeplessness; total fatigue from hard work, long marches, and endless\nhours of standing at the morning and evening roll-calls; very little food and water;\nlack of medical care; non-existing sanitation; and the ever present beatings, which\nfrequently concluded with the victim being strangled, contributed to a very short\nlife span for the vast majority of Jewish prisoners.\nOur daily food rations were minimal but were made much smaller by the barrack\nelder and his helpers who appropriated one-fifth of the bread by dividing a loaf\ninto five portions instead of the required four portions. Of the margarine and\noccasional liverwurst or smelly cheese, we received the tiniest of fractions allotted\nto us, while the rest was brazenly stolen by the barrack elder and either sold for\nother products, or distributed to his cronies and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The soup was\ndistributed at the worksite at noon and was one of our supplies of drinking water.\nThe fact that we did not have spoons did not, in most instances, make any\ndifference.\nThe soup consisted of water, some thickener, a few bits of floating potatoes or\nbeets and, very rarely, a morsel of meat, The presence of meat in the soup meant\nlittle to us, for we never saw it in our bowls. The kapo usually allowed the meat\nto sink to the bottom of the soup container and did not stir the contents before\nserving. The booty belonged to him and his helpers.\nAt every worksite throughout the camp, when it came time to line up for the soup,\nthere was jockeying for position and ensuing pandemonium, for no one wanted to\nbe the first in line to be served from the top of the container. Occasionally, the\nstrategy of those who managed to line up at the end of the line was rewarded with\nfailure when the kapo decided to stir the soup at the beginning of the line, or when\nhe decided to serve from the top of the second container, instead of emptying the\nfirst.\nThe bread ration was distributed in the evening, after roll call and it was usually\neaten at once. That meant waiting 24 hours for the next piece of solid food, for in\nthe morning we only received some cold, vile-tasting ersatz tea, made from some\nkind of leaves. It required discipline to forego eating the entire ration of bread at\nnight and have some for the morning. If one managed that, he could last a little\nlonger.\nWe envied those lucky enough to be chosen for work assignments in Auschwitz.\nVery few had the luck to be considered for such assignments or had the requisite\nskills asked for. That tells a lot about our perception of the relative merits of the\ntwo camps. We knew that Birkenau was the place that we were sent to die, but in\nour desperation we thought that Auschwitz offers a chance, however slim.\n14\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMost people now do not know the difference between Auschwitz and Birkenau.\nSome have never heard of Birkenau. When Auschwitz is referred to as the\nlargest Nazi extermination camp, it is Birkenau that fits this description, for it is\nthere where it took place. The Auschwitz gas chamber and crematorium was the\nplace where the extermination started in early spring of 1942, but it was eclipsed\nby the far more extensive scale and scope of the Birkenau death factories.\nBirkenau was designed and built for the sole purpose of serving as a giant killing\nmachine to dispose of that part of European Jewry that had not been devoured by\nthe extermination centers in Eastern Poland.\nReferences in the general American press and electronic media usually equate\nBuchenwald, Dachau, Majdanek, Treblinka, etc. as was one of those camps where\nEuropean Jews were martyred. This is a gross inaccuracy and reflects a failure to\nunderstand the difference between concentration camps and extermination camps,\nas well as a failure to grasp the history of the period as it relates to the destruction\nof European Jews.\nIn the fall of 1942, an attempt was made to make German concentration camps,\nwithin the borders of the Old Reich, \u201cJudenfre1\u2019, 1.e., free of Jews. A transport of\nseveral hundred Jewish prisoners from various camps in Germany arrived in\nBirkenau at that time. Among these were German, Austrian, and some Czech\nJews who were imprisoned since 1933, 1938 and 1939, respectively. Within a\nshort period, only a small remnant of that transport remained alive.\nBirkenau was not designed as a place to concentrate people to prevent them from\ndoing damage to the state, but as a place where people were sent to die in a\nsomewhat slower process than execution. That was my experience of Birkenau,\nat least for the first six months to a year. Those who survived that period had\nincreased chances of making it to the end.",
        "A: No! Birkenau was liberated in January of 1945. I wasn\u2019t so lucky. The Soviet\noffensive started on January 12, in central Poland. By the 18\", the Nazis had to\nevacuate the remaining prisoners of the entire Birkenau and Auschwitz camp\ncomplex. We were assembled and marched to Auschwitz. We received our ration\nfor the transport, some bread and something, and we marched all night and then\nanother night, and we left many dead on the way. The column was guarded by SS\nwhose rearguard members killed any prisoner who couldn\u2019t keep up with the\ncolumn. We walked and kept hearing shots all night. They would leave the dead\non the road and the local authorities were required to remove the corpses. It was\nsnowing and I was barely awake, walking in a trance and becoming fully\nconscious only when I bumped into the person ahead of me in the column. We\nmust have walked 25 or 30 kilometers a night. During the day, we were\n15\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\naccommodated in some barn for a couple of hours rest. Of course, we couldn\u2019t\nsleep for it was too cold. The barn belonged to a Polish farmer and I remember a\nwoman came out and brought some hot drinks for us but she couldn\u2019t do much\nmore. Some people tried to figure out a way to escape at that time. It was\nextremely risky. The first night two of my acquaintances tried to escape, but they\nwere caught and executed on the spot. The second night was worse because more\npeople were killed for not being able to keep up with the column. Hundreds of\npeople were killed in those two nights of marching until we were brought to a\nplace which looked like an abandoned railroad station or some kind of facility.\nWe had no idea what it was or where we were. We spent the rest of the night\nthere and were loaded into open railroad freight cars for a whole day\u2019s travel to\nGross-Rosen, a notorious concentration camp in lower Silesia.\nTo describe the existing conditions at Gross-Rosen as pandemonium would be\nunderstating the case. It was a medium size camp, capable of holding perhaps\nseveral thousand prisoners, but at the time of my arrival there were between thirty\nand forty thousand prisoners there, most of them evacuees from camps further\neast. My barrack housed about 1,200 men and there was hardly room for them to\nstand during roll call. It is not hard to imagine what happened when they all tried\nto find a place to stretch out for the night. Those positioned close to the wall were\nlucky, but those in the middle couldn\u2019t even find a place to sit on the floor. If one\nleft his place for a visit to the latrine, that place would be pounced upon and\nfought over by those with no place of their own.\nThe food supply and distribution system was in shambles. The camp kitchens had\nlittle left and couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand placed on it. We never knew\nwhen the soup would be delivered, it could be in the afternoon or at 2 a.m. The\nsame was true with respect to the bread ration. Neither of the two contained salt.\nThe soup was nothing but water and some beets, a vile concoction, and hard to\nswallow because of the lack of salt.\nI wore a halfway decent looking three quarter coat which I acquired while\nworking in the sauna. One day a German kapo came over to me and requested\nthat I give him my coat. He was an evacuee just as I was, and didn\u2019t function as a\nkapo there. I told him to go and fly a kite. Under the conditions, he was no better\nthan anyone else and he did not scare me. He thought that I, being a Jewish\nprisoner, would defer to his demand by virtue of his superior status. Someone\nwas observing our exchange and when it was finished, he came over and said, I\ncould not believe that you had the guts to tell him off. This fellow was from\nRadom, a friend of my brother and our paths crossed in Birkenau in 1943, and I\nhad no idea that he was still alive. He survived the war and lives in Haifa now. I\nspoke to him during my visit to Israel this past October.\nAfter three weeks of this life with little food, hardly any sleep and no chance to\nwash, we got our marching orders, a can of meat as our provision, and off we\nwere, two thousand of us, on another death march.\n16\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: If I discount my experiences in Birkenau throughout 1942, I would have to say\nyes; my sojourn in Gross-Rosen was one of the harshest episodes of my\nincarceration, except for what was yet to come.\nArmed with our can of meat, which in most instances was eaten in one sitting\n(there is not much else one can do with an open can of meat except eat it since it\nis not too portable) we started out on what was to become the deadliest segment\nof our three and one half months long agony that took us from Birkenau to\nfreedom. We marched for two days and lost many people until we reached some\nrail embarkation point. That was on a Thursday and we didn\u2019t reach Flossenburg\n(another of those stone quarries camps) until the following Tuesday. The distance\nwas not far at all, for Bohemia. It was snowing most of the time and we were in\nopen freight cars without any protection from the element and without blankets.\nThat can of meat was the last food issued to us until we reached Flossenburg, and\nthen some. That meant eight days on a pound-sized can of meat. Some of us\nwere able to lower the empty cans and scoop up some snow from the ground and\ndrink the melted snow.\nUpon arrival in Flossenburg, there were close to 500 corpses among us. They\ndied of hunger and exposure. That was in addition to the many that we lost on our\ntwo daylong march. The way up to the camp\u2019s entrance led through a very steep\nroad which to us, at that time was like scaling Mt. Everest. Our arrival at the\nshowers coincided with a blackout due to an air raid alarm which lasted for most\nof the night. I remember a wave of naked bodies pushing towards the door and\nattendants, using high pressure hosed with cold water, forced us back to the wall,\nwhile those at the wall pushed us back again, and throughout all this there were\ndead bodies on the floor and their numbers increasing. It was a night never to be\nforgotten. When released in the morning and assigned to the quarantine barrack, it\ntook almost another day before we received the first morsel of food.\nOur sleeping arrangements, due to the crowding, was an ordeal that 1s hard to\nconvey unless experienced; it cannot be comprehended. Imagine a bunk narrower\nthan a twin bed, meant for one but sleeping four, packed like sardines, two heads\non one end of the bed and two heads on the other end. If two bunks were placed\nalongside each other, the barrack elders felt that such an arrangement adds\navailable space, hence, it could accommodate ten bodies. There were no\nmattresses or blankets, just bare slats. After spending a restful night like that, we\nwere driven out of the barrack in the early morning to spend the whole day\noutside in the bitter cold, and not allowed back in until the evening.\nThe camp had several terraced levels carved out of stone and on each level were\nbarracks. I discovered that on one of the levels below ours there is a barrack led\nby the former chief kapo of Birkenau, Aloisy. He was a German political\n17\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nprisoner, but murderous and paranoid to boot. He allowed the inmates of his\nbarrack, those who didn\u2019t go out to work, to sit on the floor of the barrack all day.\nThey couldn\u2019t move about -- they just had to sit. It was still better than freezing\noutside. I took a calculated risk and went down to his barrack one morning, and\nsat down on the floor among the others, without asking his permission. He\nremembered me from many encounters in Birkenau and I knew that if he were\nasked for permission, he would never grant it. I just made myself as unobtrusive\nas possible, and he ignored me as if I weren\u2019t there. Yet, he never asked me to\nleave. The only problem was that by sitting there, I had to forfeit the soup in my\nbarrack. When he dished out the soup to his people, I grabbed a bowl and lined\nup, although I didn\u2019t belong there. Some days he ladled out a double ration for\nme, or called me back to receive a supplementary helping, and on other days, he\nwould hit me and give me no soup, without ever telling me why or speaking to\nme. On balance, I thought that the trade-off was in my favor, 1.e., it was more\nimportant to be warm than to have a guaranteed soup every day.\nAfter about a month we left Flossenburg and after traveling by train a couple of\ndays we arrived in Leonberg, near Stuttgart, by the third week of March. It was a\nsmall camp located almost in the middle of the small town. The camp served as a\nlabor reservoir for a Messerschmitt plant nearby. The plant was situated in an\nautobahn tunnel which was closed off at both ends and converted to a two-level\nmanufacturing facility producing wings for Messerschmitt military aircraft. It\nwas the first time since leaving Birkenau that I was put to work. My friend, Isaac,\nwho left Birkenau in October 1944, was in Leonberg the whole winter and\nworked as a riveter at the plant. He trained me to use a riveting gun. The trouble\nwas that I couldn\u2019t hoist myself up on the assembly platform for I was very weak.\nThe food was very meager, consisting of spinach soup every day and a small\nration of bread.\nUsually, completed wings would be rolled out to the autobahn through the tunnel\nentrance and picked up by trucks. In the entire two-week period that I was there,\nnot a single wing left the assembly hall, for everything that moved on the highway\nwas fair game for U.S. warplanes. I remember how amazed I was watching a unit\nof Wehrmacht sappers that was engaged in chiseling away at the tunnel walls at\nboth ends and packing the cavities with explosives to be detonated at the proper\ntime. What amazed me was not the fact that they were going to blow up a\nproduction facility (I often wondered whether we\u2019ll be on the outside or\nimmolated within the tunnel when it occurs), or deny the Allied forces an\nautobahn shortcut through that tunnel, but the ease and composure displayed\nduring their work. They worked regular shifts, took time out for a smoke and\ncoffee breaks, went to lunch and behaved as if they were building a tunnel rather\nthan preparing its destruction.\nWell, I never fully mastered the skill of riveting for the camp was evacuated on\nApril 1, and I never found out whether the sappers\u2019 job paid dividends or whether\ntheir orders were so construed as to prevent the success of their mission. We\n18\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmarched the better part of the day until we reached a rail station of some small\ntown near Stuttgart, or a suburb of Stuttgart. Another two day travel without\nfood, and we arrived at Kaufering, Upper Bavaria, which was a satellite camp of\nDachau.\nThe tiny barracks there, huts really, were half underground and half above\nground. The reason for this odd design was a mystery to us. The place was not\ntoo crowded, there was no work for us, and the food was at near starvation level.\nWhen we arrived at this camp late at night, we camped out in the field waiting for\nthe processing to start in the morning. I fell asleep, and woke up in the morning\namidst a pool of rainwater. I didn\u2019t even know it was raining.\nWe vegetated there for about two weeks, followed by yet another march and\nthree- day train trip, without food, of course. One thing stands out in my memory\nabout this trip, for it restored a bit of my faith in man\u2019s humanity. The guard in\nour car was a Wehrmacht soldier in his fifties who came from Dresden or\nsomewhere nearby. He took out his wallet and showed us pictures of his family,\namong them a son on the eastern front.. He showed us an excerpt from a German\nnewspaper from which we learned of the death of President Roosevelt. When our\ntrain stopped at some station, he left the car in order to steal some potatoes for us.\nHe expressed his regrets that he can\u2019t help in any other way. We arrived at\nMuhldorf, another Dachau satellite camp and not that far away from Kaufering,\nyet it took us three days by train to get there. It was to be our last camp, however,\nnot our last transport.\nIn Muhldord, I met many former inmates from Birkenau, those who left during\nthe mass evacuation in October 1944, as well as those from a transport of non-\nPolish Jewish inmates who were shipped from Birkenau to Warsaw in the summer\nof 1943 to clear the ruins of the destroyed ghetto in that city. They were\nevacuated from Warsaw at the beginning of the polish uprising there in August of\n1944. This was the first place in my three months of wandering where I\nencountered some friendship and encouragement, and it helped a lot.\nAfter several days of work at different work details, I was assigned one day to a\ngroup whose job it was to clear out a machine shop, which was located in a\nconverted or abandoned monastery. We loaded a truck full of machine tools and\ngrinding stones. Some of it loose and some of it in heavy metal crates. The\nconveyance consisted of a trailer cab that pulled two open trailers. The first\ntrailer carried the uncrated stuff plus several prisoners sent along to do the\nunloading. I was one of them. The second trailer held the crated material, two\nGerman civilians, and two armed guards. We had no idea of the destination of\nthis shipment. The driver turned off the main road and took us down a very steep\nroad leading towards a river, at which point, I suppose he was going to make a\nturn and proceed on the road alongside the river. Well, luckily for us as it turned\nout, he never made it to the river, for he soon realized that he did not have enough\nbraking power to prevent the cab and the trailers from jackknifing into the river as\n19\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsoon as they hit the bottom of that road. He turned the cab into the ditch, jumped\nout, and hollered in German, \u201cJump\u201d. There were three of us in the first trailer,\nmy friend, Isaac, who was standing, another fellow and myself were sitting on the\nfloor of the trailer. Isaac jumped in time, but the two of us didn\u2019t make it and we\nwere caught in an overturned trailer with heavy debris flying all over, including\nthe stuff from the second trailer which toppled. I lost consciousness for a moment\nand when I came to, I saw myself covered with debris, and people clearing it\naway and carrying me away from the road towards the woods. I was bleeding\nfrom a cut above the eye and from a cut in the back of my head. It was as great a\nmiracle as any that happened to me during the war. There were heavy objects\nflying all around me, some weighing hundreds of kilograms and all I suffered,\nwere two cuts. Of course, no one knew whether I sustained some internal injuries\nor some brain injuries.\nThe German driver was very upset, for he felt guilty about the accident; he tried to\nget some assistance but all that he managed to do was to bring a band-aid for me\nand a promise that someone will come to take me to the camp\u2019s sick bay. In the\nmeantime, hell broke loose with the sound of exploding bombs and flak that came\nfrom a nearby town under air attack by U.S. warplanes. I remember someone\nsaying that it 1s the Allies gift to Hitler on his birthday, and that is how I know it\nhappened on April 20. Because of this air attack, we had to wait for hours until we\nwere transported back to camp, and when I presented myself at the sick bay, the\nfloor was littered with people injured during the bombing of some facilities\nnearby. Among them was a fellow from Radom who took a shrapnel in his thigh.\nHis survival is a saga, for he was operated on in a German military hospital only\nafter liberation, which was about two weeks after he was wounded. He lives in\nMiami Beach now.\nI received no help or sympathy from the people in the sick bay; they had more\nserious injuries to deal with. I was merely assigned to a rest barrack, where after\nseveral days we received orders to assemble for transport. The Muhldorf camp\nwas being evacuated. That was to be our last transport but we didn\u2019t know it, of\ncourse. As we assembled, I overheard one of the SS guards tell someone not to\nworry, \u201cYou are being taken to Switzerland\u201d. That really gave me cause to be\nworried for if they felt compelled to lie about our destination, that meant we were\nin real trouble. Our destination was not Switzerland but straight south towards the\nBavarian Alps and Austria. The rails of that part of Bavaria were clogged with\ntrains full of prisoners being dragged towards the Reich\u2019s last redoubt. What they\nhad in store for us there, or how they were going to resolve the dilemma of either\nkilling the remaining scores of thousands of Jewish concentration camp prisoners,\nor letting them be liberated by the Allied armies can only be conjectured.\nWe traveled for several days and covered little distance, spending more time on\nsidings, allowing other trains to pass through. Our transport was not immune to\nair attacks by U.S. warplanes, as any moving objects would be in those days. The\npilots had no way of knowing who was inside those rail cars. When an alarm was\n20\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsounded the guards locked the car doors from the outside and took cover in the\nwoods nearby, leaving us as sitting ducks. Luckily, there were no bombs thrown,\nhowever, we were machine-gunned and there were casualties.\nOn the second or third day of our journey, we found ourselves sidetracked at a\nsmall railroad station in Upper Bavaria called Poeing. There were rumors that the\ntransport commander, a German army officer, ordered that the locomotive, plus\none empty car, be detached from the train and return to Dachau in order to obtain\nprovisions for the prisoners in his charge. There were several thousand of us and\nhardly any food left. If that story had any truth to it, it would only reflect the\nnaivete of the officer who was not attuned to the ways the SS camp administration\noperated. Once a transport left the camp, no one assumed the responsibility for\nprovisioning the prisoners of that transport, except perhaps for providing the\ninitial rations. I\u2019m sure that he couldn\u2019t obtain a single loaf if bread in Dachau for\nthe camp was already at the point of disintegration at that time, or about to be\noverrun by the U.S. Army.\nI don\u2019t remember how long we had not eaten at that point, but I do recall that I\nwas very hungry and decided to eat a raw potato that I had somehow acquired. I\nwas aware of the risk, and it would have been the first time for me to ignore the\npossible consequences. No sooner had I cut, or peeled the potato when we\nbecame aware of a very loud conversation outside. Someone opened the door of\nthe car (these were closed cattle cars, not open ones) and we were treated to a\nmost grotesque spectacle on the platform, where many prisoners were jumping\nand shouting, \u201cthe war is over\u2019\u2019, and in their excitement embraced some guards.\nThe guard unit of our transport consisted of a motley crew of SS, Wehrmacht\nsoldiers, and black uniformed Ukrainians. The platform was littered with\nabandoned knapsacks belonging to the Ukrainians for they were the first to\nabandon the ship, either out of fear of retribution or using the opportunity to\ndesert.\nThe source of the story about the war\u2019s end was no other than the commanding\nofficer of the transport. He went into the stationmaster\u2019s office to use the\ntelephone and heard a radio announcement to that effect. He came out and said.\n\u201cThe war is over, you are free to go\u201d. Of course, it was a false alarm. What\nhappened was on that day, or the night before, there was an uprising in Munich,\ninvolving some Wehrmacht units and civilian sympathizers. It really took place.\nThey declared Munich an open city and wanted it surrendered to the Americans,\nrather than have it destroyed. However, the coup was suppressed by an SS\ndivision, and so came to a quick end, the only open insubordination of the\nGerman military in the Second World War. I only recently read the details of that\nstory in a book called The Hundred Days by John Tolen. He was an American\nwar correspondent following the Allied troops into Germany in 1945.\nIn the meantime, the car doors were opened and masses of prisoners were milling\naround on the platform. Hundreds decided to take off and ran in all directions\n21\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntowards the nearest village or town. I never did eat that raw potato and, instead,\nsaid to my friend, Isaac, if the war is really over, it\u2019s over right here as well as in\nthe nearest village, and there is no need to run into the unknown. First things\nfirst, I said, let\u2019s go and find the car that holds the provisions. We located it, but it\nwas difficult for me to climb up onto a railcar from the ground. I managed to\nhoist myself onto it and emerged with a loaf of bread and some margarine. So did\nhe, and we both ate ourselves full after three months of near starvation.\nSoon enough, we heard the sound of shooting and saw emerging groups of\nprisoners running for their lives back to the train. We learned from them that as\nsoon as they approached the village nearby, they were rounded up by Volksturm\ntroops (Home Army) who shot at them and drove them back to the train. There\nwere casualties. It turned out that some paid with their lives when they were\nalmost at the threshold of freedom. The news from Munich about the end of the\nwar turned out to be premature. The transport reassembled and got on its way\nagain.\nA while later our train stopped alongside another train with French speaking\ncivilian workers inside. I understood a little French. I didn\u2019t speak it but I used\nthe few words that I knew and asked them whether the war was over. They said\nthey weren\u2019t aware of it.\nThe next day we stopped at many places and German women came out and\nbrought food and drink but only a few managed to get it. We noticed that the\nguards didn\u2019t interfere and we felt that the end was near at hand. The same night\nwe stopped at a rail siding near the Alpine village of Tutzing. We were asleep on\nthe floor of the car when in the middle of the night we were awakened by sounds\non the outside. There were some people out there, whether military or civilian, I\ndidn\u2019t know for I was too tired to notice. They said that they were from the\nInternational Red Cross and that for all purposes, we are free men, and that U.S.\ntroops should be in the vicinity pretty soon. I fell asleep again, and what was said\noutside didn\u2019t really punctuate my consciousness. I just didn\u2019t believe it anymore.\nI got up in the morning and looked outside, and what I saw was a dream come\ntrue. The SS guards were gone, disappeared through the night, the few\nWehrmacht soldiers, without weapons, were mingling with our people and down\nthe road, at the foot of the embankment, we spotted motorized columns of troops\nthat didn\u2019t look German. They were units of the U.S. Third Army, 100\" Division,\nI believe. It was April 30, 1945, exactly three years to the day of my arrival at\nAuschwitz.\nThe U.S. troops were merely passing by that road, going somewhere, and\nencountered masses of emaciated people coming down the embankment to greet\nthem and cheer them on. From their moving vehicles, they threw at us cigarettes,\nchocolate, and various rations.\n22\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThe group of Wehrmacht soldiers was waiting in our midst for most of the day\nuntil a U.S. army vehicle came to take them away as prisoners. There was one SS\nman who either did not manage to escape or came back for some reason. He was\nof short stature and I remembered him as a mean S.O.B. The moment he was\nspotted by the Greek fellows, they began to pummel him. He would have been\nlynched had not the Americans interceded and taken him away. I was in a mood\nto explore and began walking on the track for several hundred feet or so. I\nremember turning my head to make sure I am not followed. I simply could not\nbelieve that I was free. After three years of living under a death sentence, the\nvery first moments of freedom seemed unreal and dreamlike. It is hard to\nrecapture those moments of delight and joy mixed with sadness and sorrow, for\nthere I was, 23 years of age, having just emerged alive after a cataclysmic long\nwar and imprisonment, and alone in the world. I knew nothing about my brother\nin the Soviet gulag and I feared for the life of my oldest brother who was\nevacuated from Birkenau the preceding October. The rest of my immediate and\nextended family was destroyed, as were most of my friends and neighbors.\nIn the meantime, the immediate problems of survival had to be given some\nattention. A lieutenant of the U.S. Army\u2019s 100\" Division, named Smith, appeared\non the scene. He apparently was placed in charge to organize the setting up of a\nDisplaced Persons\u2019 Center in Feldafing, a few kilometers from the village of\nTutzing, where our train was still used as our home. We spent two days and two\nnights on that train, having the satisfaction of seeing German POW army officers\nand army doctors of a nearby military hospital bringing containers of soup and\nladling it out to us. At the same time. Lt. Smith and his staff got the townspeople\nbusy in the conversion of a former Hitler Youth School complex of buildings into\nan UNRRA DP Center. They cleaned the place, set up beds with mattresses and\nlinens, and got the kitchen and mess hall running. The train brought us to\nFeldafing once it was ready to receive us. Before we entered the new quarters, we\nhad to leave all of our clothes to be burned at a bonfire outside the building. By\nway of new clothing, we received a pair of heavy striped hospital pajamas. The\nGreek fellows of our transport broke into the clothing stores of the Hitler Youth\nSchool and emerged with brown Hitler Youth uniforms. It was a grotesque sight\nto see former inmates wearing those uniforms, but no one seemed to care. We\nwere on our own and had to obtain clothes one way or another. I found a pair of\nshorts, which were several sized too small, even though I weighed no more than\n85 or 90 lbs. at most. Next, I located one moccasin and as luck would have it, a\nfew days later, I found the matching one on another floor of the building. That\nwas the sum total of my clothes for the next six weeks or so.\nThere wasn\u2019t too much food at the mess hall and we were still hungry. However,\nit turned out to be our advantage. We slowly gained weight and strength. At\nother centers, where the food was more abundant, 1.e., more fat and high protein,\nwhich wasn\u2019t too well digested by people who starved for too long, there were\ncases of serious diarrhea and death.\n23\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nIn time I discovered that in Garmisch, south of us and at the very foothills of the\nBavarian Alps, there was a larger concentration of survivors from Radom who\nlived in the UNRRA camp there. I traveled in my pajamas, hitching a ride on a\nmilk train. It was there that I acquired my first suit of clothes. After about a\nmonth, we were all transferred to the DP camp in Landsberg. It was there that I\nlearned that my oldest brother had been sighted in Flossenburg, the last week of\nApril. One day, while playing ping-pong in the recreation hall, I was greeted by a\nyoung man whom I didn\u2019t know. In response to my question, where we had met,\nhe said, in the Flossenburg camp. I left Flossenburg in the middle of March, but\nhe said no, I saw you there about the 23\" or 24\" of March, before the evacuation.\nHe meant my brother, for we resembled each other, even though he was ten years\nolder. This was in the middle of summer, if he had been alive I would have\nheard about it, for people traveled between DP camps and news spread. It was a\nheartbreaking disappointment to me that having gone through so much, he\nperished within days of liberation. I don\u2019t know where it happened; whether he\nwas killed during the last death march, or died of starvation.\nIn the early fall of 1945, I left for Stuttgart whose DP Center became Radom in\nexile, attracting Radom survivors from all over Germany, as well as some who\ncame out of Poland. It was there that I received news that my brother in the\nSoviet Union survived and that he is in Central Asia. The news came via a letter\nfrom my brother to Radom, which was read by my cousin at the office of the\nJewish shelter there, and transmitted by a former neighbor of mine who had left\nRadom and had just arrived in Stuttgart. It was the first heartening news for me\nafter the war, yet I doubted whether the Soviets would ever permit the refugees to\nget repatriated to Poland. I remembered the story of my father\u2019s younger brother\nwho was caught in a similar bind after the First World War and could never return\nhome to Poland. He and his family perished in the Ukraine during the Holocaust.\nI spent six months in Stuttgart, and on April 28, 1946 (the fourth anniversary of\nmy leaving home) I was on a freight train with hundreds of others going to\nBremerhaven, where on May 10\", we boarded a U.S. troopship for New York.\nWe were the first displaced persons to arrive in the United States after World War\nII. We got a festive send-off by the U.S. Army in Bremerhaven and when we\narrived in New York on May 20t, the pier was full of newspaper people and\nphotographers. It must have been the first and last time that arriving DP\nimmigrants met with such a reception.\nI was sponsored by my uncle, my mother\u2019s younger brother and only living uncle.\nHe was never married and my brother and I were the only survivors of his very\nlarge family. He treated me with great kindness.\nNot long after my arrival in the United States, I received mail from Stuttgart in\nwhich my neighbor informed me that someone arrived from Stettin (the former\nGerman Baltic port, now a part of Poland) to Stuttgart and told her that my\nbrother and his wife have come to Stettin with one of the transports of the\n24\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nrepatriated Polish citizens from the soviet Union. They came back to Poland\nshortly after my emigration to the United States, and as it turned out, luckily my\nfears that he won\u2019t be repatriated were unfounded. I had his address and sent him\na food parcel immediately. By the time the parcel reached Stettin, he and his\npregnant wife were already in a West Berlin DP Center. The reason for their\nleaving and for the exodus of most of the thousands of repatriates from the Soviet\nUnion and others, was the bloody pogrom in the Polish town of Kielce, not far\nfrom Radom, on July 4, 1946, in which over forty Jewish survivors from the\nconcentration camps were hacked to death as a result of some blood libel. The\npolice and the military did not intervene, while some policemen participated in\nthe bloodbath.",
        "A: Nothing compelled him, except some circumstances. His son was born soon after\nhe and his wife came to Berlin. They occupied a bunk in a common room in the\nDP camp without privacy and conveniences. He managed to find an apartment in\nthe city; he began to work and soon opened a clothing retail business. His\nchildren were born and raised there. While he didn\u2019t become rich there, he made\na decent living. I have been there many times in the course of these past forty\nyears. His son graduated from the University of Jerusalem and did graduate work\nin Amsterdam and Brussels. He has a responsible position with the Common\nMarket Commission in Brussels, and leads a good life in Belgium. My niece\nstudied law at the University of Berlin and became an attorney. She works in\nLuxembourg where her husband, also an attorney, works for the European\nParliament in Luxembourg. Berlin has a viable Jewish community and it is an\ninteresting city to live in. My sister-in-law died three years ago and my brother\nhas been deeply affected by her death; they were married for forty-three years.\nLet me return, if I may, to my experiences as a new immigrant in New York City.\nMy uncle was working in the apparel industry and his boss gave him a chance to\ntrain me a as a Sewing machine operator of ladies\u2019 dresses. It was a skilled trade,\nfor we made the entire dress, however, I never accepted dressmaking as my career\nobjective.\nI didn\u2019t speak a word of English when I arrived from Europe. I was schooled in\nPolish and Yiddish and acquired a reasonable knowledge of German during the\nwar. I started by going to evening school several times a week to learn English.\nAt the end of the school year, the teacher asked me to go to the principal\u2019s office\nand take a test, the passing of which entitled me to an elementary school diploma.\nIn the fall of that year, I registered as a student in one of Manhattan\u2019s two evening\nhigh schools. New York City operated evening high schools enabling adults to\nacquire a high school education. The school I went to in lower Manhattan had\nexcellent teachers. I started by going two nights a week and taking English and\nhistory classes. After a year or so, I realized that if I contemplate entering\ncollege, I had better buckle down and take my high school work more seriously. I\n25\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbegan to attend five nights a week, four hours each night. It was hard, going\ndirectly from work to school every evening from 6:15 to 10:15, followed by a\nlong trip home by bus and subway. Homework consumed the rest of the evening\nand most of the weekend, and I still had to get up early to go to work. Just before\ngraduation, I took the New York City College Entrance Examination and was\naccepted as a matriculated full-time student at the uptown campus of CCNY. My\nuncle\u2019s assistance permitted me the luxury of being a full-time student without\nhaving to work. If I had to do both, I don\u2019t believe that I would have mustered the\ncourage and the energy to go on.\nI graduated from CCNY after three and one-half years with a B.A. in Economics\nand applied to graduate schools at Columbia University and the London School of\nEconomics. That was in 1954. I was accepted at both schools and settled on\nColumbia University. After one and a half years at Columbia, I took the U.S.\nCivil Service entrance examination. Several weeks later, I was called by the U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics for an interview and was offered a position as a labor\neconomist.\nThat was my start with the U.S. Department of Labor. The job was interesting\nand there was a lot of travel in the first years. After two years on the job, I got\nmarried. I met my wife at my friend\u2019s house. She was an excellent student,\ngraduating from Hunter College at the age of twenty and completing her Ph.D. in\neconomics at twenty-three. She died of kidney failure at twenty-five after three\nand a half years of marriage. At the time, there was not much that could be done\nabout nephritis. Kidney dialysis was still a thing of the future.",
        "A: Yes! I began working for the government in 1956, and we married in 1958. She\ndied at the end of 1961.\nIn early 1962, I took a leave of absence from my job for six months and went to\nBerlin. The Department was very decent to me. They realized that I needed time\noff and didn\u2019t mind giving me half a year\u2019s leave without pay. From Berlin I\ntraveled to Israel and later on to Scandinavia. Several months after my return, I\nwas assigned to Cleveland, Ohio, to assist at the setting up of a new regional\noffice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in that city. A former colleague of mine\nfrom New York who had transferred to the Chicago office at the beginning of the\nyear, was the one delegated to Cleveland to set up the program which I assisted.\nFor the next holiday weekend, he invited me to come home with him to Chicago\nand visit with his family.\nDuring my stay in Chicago, I got in touch with Jeanne, my present wife, who at\nthe time was completing her PhD dissertation in psychology at the University of\nMichigan in Ann Arbor, but resided and worked as a psychologist at a hospital in\nChicago. We attended City College at the same time, and had known each other\n26\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfor many years. We met and continued to meet on subsequent trips. We married\none and a half years later, after she completed her Ph.D. and returned to New\nYork. That was in 1964. Our son, Marc, was born in 1965. In 1967 I decided to\ntransfer to Washington, for I had enough of travel assignments which are a\nconsequence of work in regional offices. Our son, David was born here in 1969.\nWe have lived here for 25 years now.\nAfter nearly 35 years of service with the Department of Labor, I retired two years\nago.\nIn a nutshell, you have my life\u2019s story on tape, 1.e., up to now.",
