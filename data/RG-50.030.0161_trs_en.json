        "Q: Would you tell me your full name?",
        "A: I am Ruth Krautwirth Meyerowitz.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 19290 \u2014 June 23, 1929. My father was born in Slovakia\n\u2014 what became Slovakian during the Second World War; and he came to Germany when he\nwas about two years old. And he was, I'm sorry to say, in the Austrian Army during World\nWar I. And my parents were married in 1927. My father had just started a business, and he\nwas in leather good business. Frankfurt 1s \u2014 the Jews in Frankfurt \u2014 many Jews in Frankfurt,\nwere in the leather good business actually, across the river in Offenbach. And then during the\nwar, he had to leave the business in Offenbach and move, to move the business into\nFrankfurt. Was behind in the, in the commercial district, behind the main railroad station.\nAnd I have a younger brother, four years younger. He is now \u2014 he now lives in New Jersey,\ntoo. And I live in New Jersey, of course. And in 1933 \u2014 I have memories from the events, the\nchaotic events that went on in Germany in 19\u2014 from 1933, probably 1932 on. But, of course,\nthe \u2014 I understand, going back into history, that there was a lot of continuous up\u2014 unrest in\nGermany, from the end of the war actually and through the Depression and all this. But\nactually on account of the inflation. But I'm, of course, was too young to know of anything. I\nhave memories from when I was about two, three years old. The first thing that I remember,\nwas that there was sort of unrest and fear in the air. And one day, my parents went out and\nleft me with help. And I was worried because everything seemed so insecure all at once. So\nand we lived in an apartment about on the third floor which is probably is.... And I went out\non the balcony and looked for my parents. And of course, when you're that age I don't think\nyou have any depth perception. And there was a banner slung between the two apartment\nbuildings and to me it seemed like it was a barrier that no one would be able to cross\nanymore, and I was very fearful that my parents would not be able to come back to me. It\nwas a banner; it was political banner that was put up by the Nazi party. I don't know what, I\ndon't remember what it said. But that was my very first memory of Nazi, the rise of the\nNazis. My uncle, my father's youngest brother, was a budding reporter as they would say in\ntoday's jargon, and he worked for a German newspaper. Apparently had written something\nor maybe, I don't know, maybe his political views were not anything the Nazis liked.\nAnyway, he was hunted, hunted down. He was taken to a \u2014 he was, at first he was working\non the newspaper. And one day my father \u2014 and I was three years old \u2014 my father told, told\nme that, \u201cIf some men come and asked you where Uncle Julius is, you should tell them that\nyou had just seen him this morning or the night before or some such.\u201d Because he wanted to\nsort of cool his trail. If he had left by then, he was fleeing from the Nazis and made his way\nto Czechoslovakia, and sure enough some men came, and I was really itching to tell them\nthat my uncle wasn't here, but thank God they never asked me. They just spoke to my father.\nThey wanted to know where my uncle was, and he ended up in Czechoslovakia, and they\nnever caught him until much later. He was working in western part of Czechoslovakia in\nPilsen and when the Nazis came in, of course he tried to make his way east, away from them,\nand he went by motorcycle and had an accident, had a broken leg and brought him to the\nhospital. And of course by then the occupying Nazi, Nazi forces \u2014 the German army, knew\nwho he was and they took him out of the hospital and took him to jail and he was shot there.\nSo they did eventually catch up with him.\nSo these were my very earliest memories of living in a police state in Nazi Germany. When,\nof course in the very beginning they \u2014 the Nazis did now allow any money to be paid out or\nwhatever foreign money or any monies were in Jewish bank accounts was stopped. Of\ncourse they had to open the accounts again especially since my brother was getting money\nfrom out of the country foreign exchange with better interest. Which they were anxious to\nget in because they needed it, so it seemed that for a very short time life might be fairly\nnormal in a large city. It wasn't in the small cities. There was a lot of beating and harassment\nof Jews of all kinds, but in a city like Frankfurt, it didn't quite begin. I didn't feel it until\nmuch later, but gradually they encroached on our liberties. I was walking with my family on\nthe side of a park once, and a young boy on a bicycle knocked me over and went over my\nknee. He didn't break anything, but my parents were even afraid to go to the police and\nreport it, report it to anyone because it would only have meant problems for us. So since I\nwasn't seriously hurt they took me home and nursed my knee and that was it.\nWhen, sometime ago, my family \u2014 my sons, my husband and I \u2014 went back to Frankfurt on a\nsort of very bittersweet tour, we \u2014 I wanted to show them the Jewish places and the rich\nJewish history, if anything could be found \u2014 the places that I remembered and the places that\nmade sense within Jewish history to them. And we were walking from the last apartment\nwhere we had lived, on the way to where my school was. This school, incidentally, was a\nrather well-known school. The educational process 1s still being studied today. They were\nvery progressive. It's Philantropin \u2014 I don't know if you've heard of it but it was a really well\nknown school. And anyway, there was a few blocks walk to the school from my first house,\nand we passed a house that has been left standing, and it brought back a terrible memory of\nsomething that had happened. There was a little girl in my brother's class. She was four years\nyounger, I mean he's four years younger than I, so she was, must have been the same age as\nmy brother. And she was, I don't know, maybe at the time eight or seven or something like\nthat. Her father had done something that the Nazis didn't like, and so rather than punish him\noutright, they took this little girl and had her sterilized, and then returned to the father. And\nthat is, I mean, a much more terrible thing. Now that I have grandchildren and I see my sons\nhaving their daughters almost that age, this is a most terrible thing that you can do to a\nparent. It's worse than taking and chopping a parent's hand off or something like that. And\nwe passed this house and I told them the story and it was absolutely \u2014 they were absolutely\nstunned. I mean they had heard and read every-everything about the Holocaust and about the\npersecutions and all, but standing 1n front of the house where this actually went \u2014 where this\ngirl actually had lived, it was really quite mind-boggling. And of course eventually, everyone\nwas killed anyway, but this was one of the terrible things that went on as the war progressed\nand as the war against the Jews progressed. Actually the war against Jews didn't really start\nin Europe in 1939. It started in Germany. It became a hot war in 1933, but I think German\nhistory 1s, is full of war against Jews, cold and hot and in between.",
        "Q: Let's get back to you. How, what were you doing this years?",
        "A: I was going to school. Many of the teachers left. Many of them committed suicide. They\nwere disillusioned with what was, and they were afraid of the future and when I've gone\nback to the cemetery and I've seen some of their graves and they are all, they all fall in this in\na certain time period. It must have been at one point the realization that everybody would be\nkilled and people preferred to die in their own beds and by their own choice. And so I do go\nthe cemeteries and I recognize some of the names and I put a stone and I remember what has\nhappened. But, I did go to school and many of my friends left. And then more and more\nrestrictions were placed on Jewish teaching. We were allowed \u2014 I mean \u2014 I guess they\ncouldn't control that we were learning Hebrew and the Bible and Jewish history and.... But\nwe were not allowed to play Jewish music by Jewish composers and it was very funny. My \u2014\nwhen the school stopped, my brother and I took violin lessons. Pretty bad, we were pretty\nbad. But anyway when \u2014 after we were not allowed to go to school anymore, my mother\nwanted us \u2014 to keep us busy I guess, to keep practicing. And we were playing together the\nBarcarole from Tales of Hoffman and for some reason some Nazis, Gestapo men, came up to\nsee us for I don't know what. And they heard us scratch away on the violin and they asked us\nwhat we were playing, and we were afraid to say that this was by a Jewish composer. Of\ncourse, Offenbach\u2019 was not allowed to be played. Neither was Mendelssohn\u2019 and all the\nother Jewish composers or even if they were remotely related to Jewish composers. Because\nI guess they figured I couldn't \u2014 we couldn't do much harm with our playing so they didn't\nsay anything. But that was one of the many harassments that went on.\nOur school was finally combined with the \u2014 another school, we \u2014 one of the two Jewish\nschools in Frankfurt that had existed from \u2014 for at least 100 years. I mean students had left,\nand there were very few left behind, and then of course some were sent out on transports into\n\u2014 we didn't know, but it was ostensibly, of course, for repatriation into the east or for\nsettlement in the east. And of course that was not true, but we were told that that's what it\n\u2018J acques (nee Jacob) Offenbach\n* Felix Mendelssohn\nwas. They \u2014 when my good friend Irma was taken away \u2014 and many, many of our \u2014 of my\nfriends and then the school building was closed and we had classes for a very short time in\nthe an old orphanage building, the Jewish orphanage building. And then of course, school\nwas stopped completely. And because my father was a Slovak citizen, and because he had \u2014\nhis business was taken over by a German Nazi. He was a dentist, and he we think that he was\nan executioner because whenever the grapevine said that there had been some kind of\nshooting of German dissidents, he was away from the business. And he walked around, with\na gun, he had a gun in my father's desk and whenever he called my father in for consultation,\nhe would open the drawer and they, the conversation would go on over a gun sitting in the\nmiddle of my father's desk. And so he wanted to keep my father because this man knew\nabsolutely nothing about running the business, so he wanted to keep my father on. My father\nhad the choice of staying behind when we were supposed to be sent to the east. And he could\nhave stayed behind and just had his family go but he didn't want to do this. He thought he\ncould protect us if he would come with us, and ironically, very sadly, he is the one who did\nnot survive the war. My brother and my mother and I managed to scratch out of it and\nsurvive. So, because of that, we were among the last few full Jews \u2014 I mean there were a lot\nof mixed marriages, and there were a lot of off-spring you know who were half Jewish.\nThose were \u2014 some of them were let sent to Theresienstadt after we left \u2014 but we were\namong the full Jews the last few to be sent to Auschwitz.\nNow the reason we were not put into \u2014 and we were told we were not put into a car with the\ngas going \u2014 was that we were such a small transport and it didn't pay for them to use up a\nwhole lot of gas. So, they figured they'd send us into Auschwitz and we would be somehow\ndead within a short time anyway, so they just shipped us over. And on the way to Auschwitz,\nwe were joined by a lot of Polish prisoners. But they were forced laborers, women, who\nwere taken into Germany when the Germans occupied Poland. They were probably \u2014 maybe\nthey said they didn't like the food or they objected to something, and they were then taken to\na concentration camp. So as we were going along, and we were only riding during the day\nbecause at night the planes, the Allied planes flew overhead and they didn't, and of course\nthe planes had no way of knowing who was in there. If they thought that we carried\nammunition they would bomb us. So they made us stay at night in different places, in prisons\nand whatever along the way. And we did the few hundred miles to Auschwitz in, I think,\nsomething like seven days and no nights. But wherever we went, we picked up several\nprisoners and they \u2014 non-Jewish prisoners \u2014 and they went to camp with us. But we were the\nlast Jews, were about 37 of us. And as far as I know, only my mother and my brother and I,\nand one other young boy survived. And I think that was a pretty high percentage because if\nwe had been gassed of course no one would have been alive from the transport.\nAnd at the \u2014 when you arrived in Auschwitz \u2014 with all the pictures that you see of the SS\nmen with the dogs and a beautiful bright day in April.... We were taken away on the 19th of\nApril which was Hitler's birthday \u2014 or the 20\", or something. It was the 20th wasn't it? This\nwas supposed to be a birthday present to the Fiihrer, that Germany would be Judenrein,\u2019 and\nthat was why they shipped, gathered us on the 19th of April. And it took us about a week to\nget there, and it was a beautiful, bright, lovely day. It seems almost impossible that\nsomething this horrible could go on in the world on a beautiful day like that. We saw my\nfather, from far away, and that was the last I ever saw of him. And we went into Auschwitz.\nOur clothes were taken away. Our hair was shaved off. My brother stayed with us for a very\nshort time \u2014 was allowed to be in camp with us. And then they decided that it wasn't moral\nfor a young boy to live with all these women who would sometimes would be in the nude.\nBut of course it was very moral for them to have us to get undressed and to parade in front of\nan SS officer or a few SS officers anytime they wished and anytime a whimsy struck them\nyou know. But this was immoral and my brother was taken to the men's camp, and he\nmanaged to live through it somehow and of course he survived.",
        "Q: You told me a story about your mother at the Selektion.\u201d Would you tell us about that?",
        "A: When she saved \u2014 when she pulled me away. I\u2014 when I came to Auschwitz, a few months\nlater, I think, almost everybody became very sick. My mother had malaria too, but she never\nhad typhus. I was the one who came down with typhus, and I have very little memory of\nwhat went on. But my mother dressed me every morning, took me out to this Zahlappell\u00b0 \u2014\nwhich is the equivalent of roll call \u2014 and dragged me to work so that I wouldn't be beaten or\nsent into the hospital \u2014 the barracks which was, which was really a death barracks. So my\nmother dragged me around, but of course I looked terrible. And there was the Selektion for\nthe gas chambers one time, and we were standing outside and this SS man told me to go in\none direction and my mother into another because I looked so sick. And of course I was just\nwasting the food \u2014 this 200 calories worth of food that they gave us everyday. So my mother\npleaded with him and said that, well, I'm her child and she, can't she come with, can't I come\nwith her? And he said, \u201cNo, but if you're so concerned about your daughter, go with her.\u201d\nAnd she was just about to do this, and, and one of the women, who was working in the\nbarracks \u2014 I think she swept floors and whatever and maybe cleaned the chimney, the stoves\nand whatever other menial work, but she had some kind of protected position, whatever that\nwas worth \u2014 she sort of grabbed me under one arm and my mother grabbed my other arm,\nand we managed to walk away. We were not even stopped, and it was some kind of miracle\nthat the SS man didn't notice that or, or pretended not to notice us. And just, and we just kept\ngoing and my life was saved that day. It was really the most amazing thing. I can't figure out.\n* Leader (German)\n* Jew Pure (German); Nazi term used to describe areas that had been completely purged of their\nJewish population.\n> Selection (German); term used for process of selecting prisoners for immediate liquidation or\ncontinued forced labor.\n\u00b0 roll call count (German)\nOf course, I was sick and I don't know exactly what went on \u2014 the excitement of the moment.\nBut my life was saved that day",
        "Q: Tell me more about what you remember about Auschwitz, please?",
        "A: Well, of course the first day we arrived my hair was shaved and we were standing\ncompletely in the nude and I was frightened. I was thirteen years old. I called my mother,\nand she answered me and I turned around to look for her, but I didn't recognize her because,\nof course, she had no hair. Was impossible to recognize her totally without clothes and\nwithout hair. And then, we were tattooed and of course was nothing like the, the disinfectant\nor anything put on the ta\u2014 on the needles. Everybody's tattoo became slightly infected but it \u2014\nthat stopped. And we were brought into barracks, at first into the \u201cA\u201d camp and then later on\ninto the \u201cB\u201d camp. One of our first chores was \u2014 they had \u2014 the roads in Auschwitz were\nterrible. They were muddy and then the mud dried. It was full of ruts, so they had this big\nsteamroller. But 1t wasn't propelled by steam, it was pushed by prisoners. It was tremendous\nand they filled it up with sand. You had to fill it with sand, so it would be heavy, and then\nsomeone had to go out and push it to even the road. So, one of our first jobs was to fill this\nsteamroller and then later on \u2014 or whatever it was, 1t was a tremendous roller \u2014 and then later\non to push it across the ruts to try and even out the road. I don't think it was very successful.\nAnd one of our next jobs was to even out the road, to dig out wherever the road was higher\nand to fill in where the road was lower. It really didn't make any sense because we dug parts\nof the road out, filled in another hole. And it seemed like this kind of work was designed to\ntake our energy away and to make us weak. And I think that was the purpose, to demoralize\nus and to sap our strength. Then we were in a camp \u2014 in the barracks and we had this horrible\nfood. Where we had \u2014 they once \u2014 I don't know, a few times a week, maybe two or three\ntimes a week \u2014 we had a slice of salami which was about an inch thick and sometimes it was\nliverwurst. And something that came out of rusty barrels \u2014 it was called \u201ctea\u201d \u2014 and\nsometimes they had soup. They made soup out of bean \u2014 no some kind of turnips, that\nweren't even peeled and potato peels and the sand wasn't washed off. And they just threw\neverything together, and even at times they emptied out bags that the people had brought\nfood when they were taken on a transport, and were \u2014 and it was \u2014 sometimes these bags of\nfood managed to get into the camp. But it wasn't assorted, they just emptied everything into\nthis pot of soup that they were cooking. We found combs and compacts and things like that\nsometimes in the soup, because they never bothered to assort it. And that was the food that\nwe had. And it must have been just a few hundred calories a day because everybody was\ngetting sick. One of the signs of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency is sores, and people had\nterrible sores which festered on their legs. It was just awful. And that was one of the things\nthat you could be taken to the crematorium for. As soon as someone had a sore like that, or\nthe scratches from scabies that was a reason to be taken to the crematorium.\nNow I was very fortunate. I also had scabies at one time but somehow it didn't get into my\nface. It stayed on my body, and there was a Selektion and they didn't, that day, make us take\noff our clothes. So they didn't that I had scabies and that also saved my life. Now scabies can\nbe cured with a few pennies worth of sulfur cream. But of course no one had it and they were\nnot interested in saving anyone of course. They were interested in having people get sick and\nhaving people die or be in such condition that they would take them to the crematorium. The\ncrematorium was just a few minutes away. We could see the chimneys from wherever we\nwere, and of course we could smell the gas when it was left, let out from the gas chambers.\nAnd then we could smell the burning of the bodies, the human flesh burning. Then they\ncleared the grates and we could hear the grates being cleaned and it's similar to what your\nown oven would be like when you move the grates around except in a much \u2014 it was much\nnoisier that we could hear all the way in the barracks. And to this day when I clean my own\noven, I am reminded of that noise of the cleaning of the grates in the crematorium.\nWell, we lived through the \u2014 these times. I made friends with a girl from Salonika and her\nsister. Her name was Nini Ben Mayoa(ph). She was about 18 at the time and her sister was a\nyear or two younger. I had not even realized that the Nazis were trying to eliminate even the\nJews of as far south as Greece and I understand. I saw \u2014 I met people in Jerusalem in 1981\nwho were from Rhodes and they had done the same thing to the Jews from Rhodes, and I\nreally wasn't aware that they were doing. Well, anyway, the Greek girls were taken from\ntheir homes. Most of them were from Salonika. They were taken from their homes and\nbrought to Auschwitz and of course their parents either had been killed or they were left\nbehind and were taken out another time. So I made friends with Nini Ben Mayoa. She was\nstudying to be an opera singer, and to us at the time, when she sang, it was like the most\nbeautiful thing you could ever hear. Maybe she had a beautiful voice. To me it now sounds\nlike she really, you know, she was like an angel singing. And of course there were Jews from\nall over Europe and every language was spoken in the camp except English.\nAnd they didn't get as far to, to the English Jews yet. So all the \u2014 they under-\u2014 they realized\nthat everybody in order to communicate \u2014 and luckily they didn't stop that \u2014 would speak in\nthe language that she would know. Nini and I could communicate in English because I had\nstudied English and so did she, and that was the only way \u2014 the only language that the two of\nus had in common. Of course this was forbidden. So because it was forbidden \u2014 I mean, you\nwere 13 years old, you \u2014 in spite of 1t everything \u2014 you tried, you think you're very brave.\nAnd so we were speaking 1n English and, and she told then the story that she was taken and\nthat she trying to be an opera singer. And she \u2014 whenever there was a chance, Nini would\nsing for the prisoners. And of course we had so few mental escapes, you know. We had so\nfew anything that was nice that was happening, that you were really, we begged her all the\ntime whenever she was being halfway in the mood to sing for us. Well, her sister died in the\nsummer and after that all the spirit went out of her. She just lost all hope and of course she\ndidn't sing anymore. But shortly before that somehow this SS man, Taube\u2019 \u2014 did you ever\nhear his name, Drechsler\u00ae and Taube? The woman's name was Drechsler and his name was\nTaube. They were not officers. They were \u2014 but they were the ones who kept order by\nbeating in the camps. Well, he had heard that Nini had a wonderful voice, and he proposed\nthat she live in his house, yes, and sing for him. And Nini knew what it meant. But you have\nto realize for the time that she would have been alive and of course you were hoping\neveryday that maybe through some miracle there would be some kind of release. But for the\ntime that she might have stalled and would have been alive, she might have lived in clean\nsheets and would have had a bath and would have had some fairly decent food. And so the\nsacrifice that she made was tremendous. She refused him. And among the next Selektions to\nthe gas chamber, her number was prominently mentioned and there was no way that anyone\ncould have erased the number. I mean he made sure that she was on that next transport to the\ngas chamber. And of course she was killed that way.\nBut I have been telling my sons about this and all their lives they've heard about Nini and\nhow the heroic stand that this girl took and her bravery of course. And when I was in\nJerusalem in 1980, \u201881, for the gathering, I was looking for people from Salonika because I\nreally had a very great rapport with most of them, I mean with all of them. They were really\nvery nice. They were \u2014 you know, young girls who spoke several languages \u2014 they were very\nhappy as far as it could go. They were, were very talented. They danced and they sang.\nThere was still a woman; her name was Stella, who did a lot of dancing and she entertained\nus. And I was told that she lived in Paris after the war, that she and her daughter had some\nkind of nightclub act. But I understand something sophisticated and everybody asked, \u201cWell,\nif you're so interested, how come you didn't find out about her?\u201d And I really never found\nout what became of Stella, but she did entertain us with some very beautiful dancing. But, so\nI went around looking for people who came from Salonika and I didn't meet anyone that I\nknew. But on the last night when President \u2014 Prime Minister Begin was speaking at the Wall\n\u2014 I heard someone, a man in back of me say that he was from Salonika. And of course my\nears stood up and I turned around and asked him some \u2014 if he knew any of my friends and I,\nin passing, mentioned that my friend had been Nini Ben Mayoa(ph). No, it's not good. But\nanyway, he said there was still a Mr. Ben Mayoa(ph) in Salonika. He's the head of the Jewish\ncommunity and I should get in touch with him. Well, of course, as soon as I came home I\ntried to figure out a way of getting in touch with him and the only thing I knew how to go\nabout getting a foreign address was get in touch with the Federation. And within a half hour I\nhad the address of the Jewish community in Athens who then forwarded the letter to Mr. Ben\nMayoa and Mr. Ben Mayoa 1s a cousin of Nini's. When they were in New York we had a\nvery nice visit. We met at the Jewish Theological Seminary because this is half-way between\nwhere he was staying and my \u2014 where my house was and a lot of reminiscences and of\ncourse we sort of corresponded for a while. It was very interesting to be able to reminisce\n\u2019 Adolf Taube\n\u00ae Margot Drechsler\nabout all the thing with Nini. One of the things that Nini sang and I guess it must have been\npart of her training was Av\u00e9 Maria. And of course I was \u2014 we always begged her to sing Av\u00e9\nMaria and to this day I am sometimes invited to Catholic weddings and I listen to Av\u00e9 Maria\nand of course I start crying. And everybody goes on look at this Jewish woman \u2014 how\ntouched by Av\u00e9 Maria, but they do not know the memories I have of Av\u00e9 Maria and Nini.\nAnd that was one of real unforgettable friendships that I did form in Auschwitz.\nAnd my mother and I were together for the whole time. At first we worked in a factory\nwhere they \u2014 it was called \u201cWeberei,\u201d\u201d \u201cthe weaving place.\u201d Radar was coming into\nprominence at that time, the British airforce used it against the Nazi airforce. The Nazis tried\nto stop \u2014 they tried to interfere and cause static so they made us weave. We were told that\nwhat it was \u2014 I am not a hundred percent sure. They made us weave plastic \u2014 braid plastic\nstrips and they were going to drop this, hoping that that would interfere with the radar\ntransmission. They were dropping this from planes and we were forced to keep plaiting these\nthings in the Weberei. This was one of the jobs in the Weberei and we worked there for a\nwhile. And somehow, through knowing someone, my mother and I were assigned to work in\nKanada,\u201d where all the belongings that came into the camp that the prisoners took with\nthem and \u2014 of course, everything was taken away from them. All this was brought in and\nassorted and than packed and sent into Germany. And even the word Kanada \u2014 spelled with\n\u201cK\u201d the German way, \u201cKANADA\u201d \u2014 it was a metaphor for all that is plentiful and available\nand just there because Canada, I guess to them, meant a lot of riches. And so that's what it\nwas nicknamed. My mother and I worked there, and we assorted mainly blankets and\ncomforters that people had taken with them, hoping that they would be able to use them. Of\ncourse most of them didn't even live to see what was happening with it, but even in the camp\nthey all had these raggedy old rags and for blankets. They were full of lice and every so often\nthey were cleaned and the straw mattresses. But when the things that were in Kanada were\nassorted and just sent to Germany, and one time was a tremendously high pile of comforters,\nand we had a few minutes during lunch break, and I had found a book Nathan the wise.\nActually the play of Nathan the Wise. During lunchtime, I crawled up on top of the mattress\nhoping that no one would see me, and I was reading it. But of course when you come in\ncame in from an angle at the, at the barracks, you could see me up on top there. And an SS\nwoman came in and called me down and took the book and threw it away and really boxed\nmy ears until I was dizzy for reading that. So even this small attempt at culture of course was\nstopped of course. I don't know if you realize that Nathan the Wise was written by a\nGerman\"? in praise of a Jew. But of course I don't know this, and probably she wasn't even\naware of it. It's just that she didn't want anything like this to be available as activity.\n7 Weaving mill (German)\n'\u201d Canada (German); term for the warehouse of looted goods at Auschwitz; also used to refer to\nprisoners who where assigned to work in the warehouse facilities.\n\u2018' Gotthold Ephraim Lessing\nWhile I'm \u2014 the belt? Right, the belt. While I \u2014 while we were in \u2014 working in Kanada we\nwere not allowed to wear what was really \u2014 would be considered civilian clothes. While, the\npeople in camp, in the camps, were not given these stripped clothes, not all of them, they\nwere wearing stripped clothes. They were given the old rag clothes that were taken off the\nbodies, and given to them and they lasted until they really fell off and they were full of mud\nand filth and lice. And then every so often they, they would \u2014 the lice \u2014 the clothes were\ntaken away and they were put in the gas chamber to kill the lice, and then of course all the\nnits were dead but they were all sitting in the seams and were still there. And those were the\nclothes that the prisoners wore but because we were in Kanada, and we were not supposed to\nwear home anything that was still wearable that they could ship to the Reich they \u2014 we were\nsupposed to wear these long prison uniforms. And I was very \u2014 I was getting thin. I had been\nsick and the dresses were very long. The mud in Auschwitz was just \u2014 it was clay and it\nstuck to the dresses, to the hem of the dresses, and when it dried it was very heavy and very\ndifficult to remove. And it dragged us down. Of course, we didn't have much strength to drag\nourselves around let alone a muddy dress, so most prisoners found some pieces of string, tied\nit together and pulled up their dresses and we were allowed to do this. I found a belt. The\nGreek girls who came to Auschwitz had brought in a lot of knitted dresses with beautiful\nrose designs knitted into the hem and into the top and when I saw the belt it had, it was blue\nfelt. It had yellow and red felt flowers sewn on. I thought that it was a Greek handiwork, and\nof course being Greek you know, having been so fond of the Greek girls, I was felt very\nsentimental about the belt. But later on when I showed it to someone, it turned out that the\nbelt was not Greek. But whatever it was, I had the belt. And I used it to pull my dress up. Of\ncourse we weren't allowed to wear anything that would be an adornment, so because I\nbloused the belt over the \u2014 bloused my dress over the belt, I was able to wear the belt and no\none saw it. And my mother kept saying, \u201cOh Ruth, you know, look at how thin you're\ngetting, my poor child. Look, this starvation is terrible for you.\u201d And so I kept telling her,\n\u201cBut no, the belt isn't getting, isn't \u2014 I'm not getting thinner. The belt is getting longer. The\nbelt is stretching.\u201d That's how I tried to appease her. And there was a button at one time on\nthat belt and the button came off and then I ended up just using a safety pin that I found, a\nrusty old safety pin. And the belt went with me even later on when we worked in \u2014 were in a\nlabor camp. We were taken to a forced labor camp, and I did have another different kind of\nskirt and I was able to use the belt just as an adornment, but no one paid any attention. This\nwas towards the end of the war, and no one paid any attention to that anymore. And so I had\nthe belt with me all the time. And of course once I was in freedom, I wouldn't part with it.\nAnd I was very happy that the Holocaust Museum could make use of it now because I felt\nthat if anyone would go through my belongings and see this raggedy, dirty old faded belt\nthey would say, \u201cWhat is this woman saving this for?\u201d And this way there is a whole story\nattached to it and I'm very happy that I can relate this story of the belt.",
        "Q: You were telling me earlier about your mother helping a woman who was in trouble. Can\nyou tell us that story?",
        "A: Yes, my, my mother \u2014 when we were in Auschwitz. For a short time there was a \u2014 two\nsisters were brought in and I think they were from the area of Katowice and their names\nwere Tesha and Nusha Unger(ph). That was their maiden name. One of the ladies, as I\nunderstand the story \u2014 but I'm not sure about, of course, a hundred percent sure. Nothing is a\nhundred percent sure of what happened. One of the ladies supposedly had given poison to\nher children. There was not enough for her. And I'm not sure now, if this is the story that I\nreally \u2014 it was told to me in this kind of secret, or if this was really true. She wanted to\ncommit suicide at the first chance. She was very despondent and one time my mother saw\nher running out into, into \u2014 towards the moat that was out by the fence. And of course there\nwere the soldiers on top shooting, and as soon as you crossed this little ditch you would be\nshot but they \u2014 when they saw some one running towards the place, they started shooting\nimmediately too. So my mother ran after her and I mean among all the bullets and amidst all\nthe bullets she was able to pull the woman back. She came to visit us after the war. She and\nher sister came to visit us after the war. Somehow I've lost touch with them. I'm not sure if\nthe story was that I was told was in the sequence and I hope it doesn't bring out a whole lot\nof pain to her. We never mentioned it to her. But this is what I think my moth\u2014 this is what\nmy mother told me had happened. And my mother had saved her life. And of course there\nwere many things that we witnessed that I'm not sure if anyone else has talked about it. At\none time there was a young man working in a camp, supervised by a group of Nazi officers.\nAnd inadvertently \u2014 they were shoveling the mud there \u2014 he started whistling the\nInternationale,'~ which is the Communist \u2014 yes, the Communist song and the anthem. And as\nof course, the Nazis were very much opposed to Communism \u2014 that's how they came to\npower \u2014 this was of course the ultimate in anything they would hate. And immediately on the\nspot he shot this young man. My mother was telling me this. She was really upset her and\nageravated over this when she told me, was very agitated, that she had seen this happen. So\nthose were the things that I remember from Auschwitz.\nOf course there are many, many more tales and one time I was working somewhere and my\nbrother was still with us at the time, and my mother and my brother were being taken to a\nSelektion, and my brother was a child. Of course he was four years younger than me, about\nnine years old. He was taken \u2014 the Nazi officer told them to go to, to the side. That meant\nwhere they were being \u2014 that this group is being sent to the concentration camp, to the \u2014 I'm\nsorry \u2014 to the gas chambers. And my mother and my brother suddenly were taken by a\nGerman soldier, pulled away and hidden behind a pile of coal in a different barracks. And\nwhen my mother asked him why he had done this, he said while he was in Poland, there he\nhad witnessed a shooting of \u2014 actually mass shooting of people from a certain city \u2014 village.\nThey were taken to a, they were taken to a pit and everyone was shot and then thrown into\nthe pit. And sometimes they weren't even shot, they were still alive when they were shot into\n* Tnternational (German): Communist anthem.\nthe pit. And one of the Nazi officers had said to this woman who was walking up towards the\npit with two children, one 1n each hand, that she can live if she picks one of the children to be\nsent into the \u2014 to be shot and fall into the pit. And then she and the other child could live.\nAnd the woman of course saw no hope so she firmly grabbed both children and jumped into\nthe pit. And this German soldier was so touched by what she had done that he swore to\nhimself at the time that if he ever could save a mother and a child, he would make it his\nmission to do so. And he did that by saving my mother and my brother and hiding them for\nthe day behind a pile of coal. I never knew who the man was, and my mother didn't know\nhim either. It was just a very strange and human gesture in a sea, or in a surrounding, of\ninhumanity. And it was a very touching thing that something like that could happen, even\nthe\u2014there. And of course it was very, very unusual.\nWhen we first came to Auschwitz, my mother needed \u2014 had some medication at home. And\nthere was a German doctor, Doctor Wolpe(ph) and an SS man standing there, and I went up\nto him and very naively telling him that my mother needed this medication. And he just\nlaughed at me and walked away and it was \u2014 he was \u2014 there was this irony in his laughter. Of\ncourse why was I bothering him with nonsense medication for my mother when she wouldn't\nbe alive probably within a few weeks. So there was very little that was human \u2014 humane in\nthe in anything that happened to us. Of course I still picture the Dr. Mengele\u2019\u201d \u2014 the so-\ncalled Dr. Mengele \u2014 who stood at the Selektion and humming Mozart. Sometimes when I \u2014\nand I am very fond of Mozart \u2014 but sometimes when I happen to sing Mozart I catch myself.\nI think. \u201cLook, you're doing the same thing that Mengele did.\u201d But no, he was doing the\nsame thing I am doing. He was using some kind of humanity that he had learned and he\nwas.... When I introduced this once to some people where I speak on the Holocaust, and she\nwas shocked that he was able to sing Mozart. And she said she wondering how much of\nMengele is in every one, in every person. I don't believe that that 1s necessarily so. I don't\nknow. I don't want to philosophize. I don't know if \u2014 how these people were bred or\nconditioned to do this sort of thing. But how can one \u2014 especially some one who might have\nknown the history of \u2014 that the biography of Mozart was such an equal and you know and\nsuch a person who would really wanted to see it equality for all people \u2014 abuse the music. Or\nmaybe he wasn't even thinking or there was this veneer of culture that happened and \u2014 to\nthem and yet was not used properly. It's \u2014 sometimes I think back and I wonder, \u201cDid this\nreally happen to us? Could really some one have done what really happened to other human\nbeings?\u201d They tell the story that Himmler'* once came to the camp, long before I got there,\nand when he saw what went on, he went from somewhere and he vomited. But from \u2014\nmaybe from the odor, or from whatever went on. But that did not stop him. And of course\nthe killing went on and he was of course was the most notorious of all the killers. I'm going\nthrough \u2014 with now more than 40 years \u2014 I'm going through this in my mind over and over\nand I'm trying to figure out why \u2014 how inhumanity.... And yet, inhumanity like this does go\n> Josef Mengele\n* Heinrich Himmler\non. It started with 6,000,000. It made it possible for the world to accept large number of\nkillings. Large numbers are being killed today. And when large number of people are being\nkilled, we talk about it. We cry about it. We forget about it. And I'm trying to do my thing to\ntry to keep in mind how easy it 1s to fall into a police state, to become a police state and to\nfall into this pattern of uncontrolled hatred and destruction.",
        "Q: Is there anything you want to add about Auschwitz. Any other story you want to add or tell\nus?",
        "A: Well, I've told you many stories. What is it in particular that you had in mind?",
        "Q: You talked about eating a piece of salami?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh sure. The salami they gave us something like this \u2014 probably about an inch or a\nlittle bit less than an inch slice, slab of salami or liverwurst once, or twice, or three times a\nweek in addition to the little pieces of bread that we got daily and the tea that came out, out\nof the rusty barrels and this \u201cwonderful\u201d turnip soup. And we, one time \u2014 the salami had a\nterrible odor. They said it was made of horsemeat. It had some kind of a flavor of urine. And\none time in the evening I was just given a piece of this salami and I looked out at the window\nand I saw the crematorium going at full force and, or course, was at night, you could see the\nfire. During the daytime you could only see the smoke coming out but at night you could see\nthe flames. Well, you know, some flames, but the sky was fairly red. And I was thinking of\nthe people that were destroyed there and I was thinking, \u201cOh my God, I hope the salami\ndoesn't contain human flesh.\u201d And I threw up from it and after that \u2014 this was towards the\nend that I was in Auschwitz \u2014 and after that I was never able to even catch a piece of the\nsalami and whenever it was given to me, I traded it. Now some people would \u2014 who didn't\nhave the same experiences, I did of course \u2014 didn't know and were anxious to trade it for this\nlittle piece of bread that I could get. But I could never eat a piece of salami like that again\nand that was one of the more \u2014 well I think there were a lot of things that went on and if I go\nthrough it in my mind, more and more will come out. Of course because I did have typhus, I\ndid forget a lot of the incidents. And maybe in my own mind I try to push them aside. I was\nnever able to watch many of the programs. Even when the Eichmann\u201d trial \u2014 other people\nwere able to watch on television and I just couldn't face up to it. I it's only recently I have\nwritten on the Holocaust and have spoken about it at colleges on it, that I am able to do this. I\nstill cannot get any kind, watch any kind of movie on the Holocaust. I sometimes think, \u201cOh\nI'm brave. I'm going to do this now.\u201d And two minutes into the program, and it goes off. And\nI don't even go to any war pictures of any kind of war. I think maybe one of the reasons I am\nso anxious to talk about it is that I think that this kind of cruelty can be prevented and can be\nstopped before it gets out of hand ever. Maybe that's my small contribution I can make to\nthis.\n'\u00b0 Adolf Eichmann",
        "Q: Can you tell us about the shoes you wore?",
        "A: Oh gosh, the shoes. Everyone was given shoes in regulation, these clogs. They were\njust, you know, wooden soles and little canvas strips to hold, to put the feet in. The earth in\nAuschwitz was very muddy. It had been I understand no man's land between the wars and\nthere were fish hatcheries and it was very wet and humid. And we were given those shoes\nand then when it rained the shoes were stuck in the mud and we had to force our feet to get\nout. Of course we had no strength to pull ourselves out, and those shoes were in there and\nyou know when you are walking in it, if the shoes were stuck and you tried to pick them up\nand you weren't fast enough, you got a beating. The SS made us walk to the back with this\nand when the weather was dry the \u2014 it wasn't the \u2014 1t was very difficult to walk in those ruts\ntoo, because the earth had dried so uneven. So these shoes were really the least desirable of\nwhat you can get and when we were able to find an old pair of shoes we tried to exchange\nand to adapt it as best we could to our own use. So I think it must have been in Kanada that I\nfound a pair of shoes and it was something that was fashionable at the turn of the century. It\nhad long points and they were boots that you buckled up and they were very elegant. The\nelegant ladies wore it at the turn of the century. And but they were much too small for me\nand this was one of the things that would not be sent to Germany because no one would be\nable to wear those shoes and they had been out of style. But they were also very, very\nuncomfortable and they were very small. They were much too small for me. And so I wore\nthem with my foot in the leather side, the heel of my foot coming out on the leather side,\nrather than fitting over the heel, so that the heel stuck out on the side and I was walking on\nthe, the leather. This was of course preferable to the clogs, those, those wooden clogs but not\nmuch preferable. It killed my feet and one of the first things that I did after the war \u2014 I mean\nwhen we were walking, we were walking from Malchow for eight days, and finally\nsomewhere in German farmhouse I found a pair of shoes \u2014 and this was the first thing that I\nthrew away. Of course I'm sorry now that I didn't save the shoes, but I hated them so much. I\nmean they really did terrible things to my feet, but they would have been a very poignant\nmemento for the Museum. But unfortunately I don't have them. But they were terrible boots.",
        "Q: Under what circumstances did you finally leave Auschwitz?",
        "A: Well, we were told, and it turned out to be true, that the German war machines were\nsuffering because there wasn't enough labor and they needed some laborers. And one time\nwe were told that within a day or so we would be leaving Auschwitz and to prepare\nwhatever. The things we had were nothing \u2014 maybe a kerchief where we could carry our\nbread in. And on November 1, 1944, we were loaded on to a train, the same train that\nbrought people into the camp, and on one side was the crematorium and on the other side\nwas so-called freedom, the western part of Germany. And we were sitting on this train for a\nwhile and we didn't know which way it was going. We were hoping that it was true that we\nwere really being taken to Germany to for labor, but it could have been just the other way.\nWe could have gone up to the crematorium after we'd been going. Well, finally the train\nmoved out and we were indeed taken to Germany and we stayed in Ravensbriick. We were\ntaken to Ravensbriick because all this is in northern Germany, very close to the North Sea.\nWe were taken there and we were kept in a very large tent, something like a circus tent, for\nseveral days without food and water. It was the, without the water, I mean we were sort of\nused to starvation, but without water which is something awful. It rained and we had these\nspoons, and we were trying to put our spoon outside the tent to try and collect a few drops of\nwater. But of course we didn't have the patience to wait for the spoon to fill up, so as soon as\nwe had a few drops of water, we would anxiously drink it. But a few days later we were\ntaken to an actually barracks in Malchow and then \u2014 I'm sorry, in Ravensbrick \u2014 and then\ntaken again, shipped by train to this small town called Malchow. It was in northern\nGermany, somewhere near the North Sea, somewhere near the Oder \u2014 the Elbe? Where the\nGerman soldiers finally surrendered and where the four armies of the Allies eventually met.\nBut\u2014\n[TECHNICAL CONVERSATION]\nTAPE #2\n[TECHNICAL CONVERSATION]",
        "Q: Let's go back to Auschwitz for a moment. You were telling me the story what happened at\nChristmastime. Would you tell the story?",
        "A: Yes, this is Christmas Day, 1943. In Germany \u2014 Germany celebrates two days of Christmas\nThis is the last day of Christmas and so it had to be December 25th in 1943. It's very much in\nmy memory, one of the few things that I really remember very, very clearly. In the summer\nbefore, a woman had, a Jewish woman had been brought into Auschwitz. She had been a\nyoung married woman, and what wasn't obvious at the time was that she was pregnant. And\nwhen she \u2014 as she went along of course, she was losing weight because she was getting\nemaciated. And these prison clothes, these ill-fitting clothes whatever it was, was hiding her\ncondition. And when we went out to roll call, we were five deep. So the prisoners sort of\nalways put her in between where it couldn't be noticed. I mean, it was like an unwritten order\nthat we had among ourselves that we just obeyed. At the same time there were also non-\nJewish laborers, and some of them were in our barracks. There was one particular woman I\nremember, Pani Wandzia(ph), a very tall aristocratic woman. And we \u2014 I was told that she\ncame from some very aristocratic family. She was allowed \u2014 the Polish prisoners somehow I\nthink were allowed to have two times a year packages mailed from home. She had one at\nChristmas time. And then there were these three Polish slave labor women who worked\noutside the camp, but stayed 1n the barracks. And I don't think they got any Christmas \u2014 there\nwas no one to send them any packages too. And so they worked outside the camp\nsomewhere and they were treated almost as badly as Jewish prisoners. The only exception\nwas \u2014 got the same food, got the same everything, except non-Jewish prisoners were never\ntaken to Selektion. If they died, they died, but nothing was done really to help them, nothing\nwas done by the German authorities. But that was the only difference. Of course it made a\nlarge difference but they were treated the same. And so they worked somewhere. Now came\nChristmas time. Somehow they managed to pluck from somewhere this tiny little branch of a\npine tree, probably about this tall, and they made a base out of chewed bread and stuck this\nChristmas tree in. And it so happened that this woman who was pregnant, went into labor\nthat night, and had a little boy. Now the next morning there was no roll call and that that was\nthe only free time that I remember while I was in Auschwitz, when there was no Zahlappell\nin the morning or in the evening, one, one day. And I think it was only because the SS were\nout late reveling at night and they didn't expect to get up very early, so they figured well they\nweren't going to do it that one day. And the next morning my mother and I walked outside\nand the camp was in some strange quiet. There was an awe about it. It seemed almost like\npink cotton was enveloping the whole camp \u2014 strange light. And between a little Jewish boy\nbeing born the night before, and being Christmas time and this strange light in the \u2014 around\nus, these Polish women kept saying that a miracle has happened. And this must be the\nmiracle when we would be freed. And this would be the day. And when you're so desperate\n\u2014 even though I am Jewish and didn't think that could happen to me, I wasn't brought up to\nbelieve in it \u2014 we somehow decided to believe, \u201cWell, maybe you hang on to this. Maybe\nthere is some truth to the story.\u201d And this went on almost all day. Now \u2014 and everyone was\nbeginning to be a little bit, to talk, to begin to talk about it. I mean we really didn't believe it.\nWe were too realistic and too many things had happened. Somehow we felt that maybe\nsomething could happen. Well, by five o'clock of course the spell was broken. Was around\nfive o'clock, towards evening, when this spell was broken. We heard the familiar sound of\nfour, three or four army trucks. People were on the trucks \u2014 open trucks, with prisoners being\ntaken to the gas chamber. And it was preceded by an German, the command car that the\ncouple of German officers rode in, and in back of it was the car with the Red Cross on it that,\nwhoever would observe it would think there's some kind of Red Cross, some kind of\ncharitable or humane\u2014humanitarian project going on. But of course that was the truck that\nheld the gas. And they, we of course recognized the noise of the approaching trucks. At that\npoint when the they drove between the men's camp and the women's camp which was\nseparated by high wires, electrically-charged wires, and they had to go around the bend and\nget to the crematorium, to the chimneys which we saw, and we didn't see the actual\ncompound from the camp but we saw the chimneys. Of course they were very tall. So they\napproached the crematorium and as they \u2014 the prisoners in the first truck came within the\nsight of the chimneys \u2014 they started singing the Hatikvah.'\u00b0 And then the second truck\nstarted in and then the third and fourth \u2014 if there was four. I am not a hundred percent sure\nhow many. And of course they were driven into the compound of the crematorium and as\nthey were driven in, the first voice stopped. The first truck stopped and then the second and\nthen the third, and we had the, the familiar noises of the steam going and the smell and the\nnoises of the gra\u2014grates of the of the ovens, and the next morning, this roll call again. And of\ncourse no miracle had happened.\nBut as we were standing roll call, there was \u2014 the body of the baby washed out into the into\nthe ditches that I don't know where it went because actually the Germans probably would\nhave seen that there was a baby, would have seen the body. I don't know where it ended, but\nmaybe they didn't even pay attention or maybe it went somewhere underground, and that\nwas the end of the miracle. And it took another two years or so before we were really\nliberated, and a year and a half before we were liberated. As a matter of fact bodies of babies\n\u2014 speaking of that, when we were 1n working in Kanada, there was a baby found, smothered\nin the blankets. It seems that either in the rush the baby was taken away from the mother and\npushed in with the blankets, or maybe the mother tried to save the baby by putting it in with\nthe belongings that she had, hoping that someone would pick up the baby, somewhat like\nMoses or so. But of course nothing happened. And the baby was found dead rolled in some\nof these blankets and things. So lives of children were very cheap and very expendable. It\nwas, it's a terrible thing. I think over 1,000.000 or so of the 6,000,000 that died were\nchildren. You don't know all the potential that was killed at the time with such.... And that\n'\u00ae Hope (Hebrew); Jewish national anthem.\nwas one of the things \u2014 another one of the things that went on in Auschwitz. And you know,\nwhen you speak about Auschwitz, everyone has the same story of lice and rats and filthy\nclothes and beatings. My mother \u2014 there was a time when a woman, Mala, '\u2019 the \u2014you might\nhave heard this famous \u2014 she was a page or like an errand run\u2014runner, between the Germans\n\u2014 between the Nazis and different groups of Nazis, and sometimes to the prisoners. She had\nsome friends and they managed to get Nazi clothes and they escaped from the camp. And a\nfew days later she was caught and brought back to camp, and she was hung. They had a\nmoat like, I don't know. A few days after afterwards, they had to drag her and one of the\nthings that everyone was saying was so amazing. According to the Geneva Conference, you\nare supposed to \u2014 that was the story I was told \u2014 according to the Geneva Agreement, you're\nsupposed to cure prisoners \u2014 a prisoner before you execute him. And this is \u2014 and we were\namazed that, of course, what did they pay attention to about Geneva conventions? They\ndragged this poor woman with broken legs to the to the gallows and hanged her there. And\naround the same time they had, they wanted to check up and make sure that we had all the \u2014\nthat anyone was there, that no one escaped. So they had extra roll call, this extra Zahlappell\nevery hour, every hour of the day. And of course when you were standing at Zahlappell \u2014 it\nhad to be like this \u2014 and you weren't allowed to move at all. This SS woman Drechsler came\nto take the Zahlappell, and my mother stood perfectly still but she followed her with her\neyes. She saw the eyes moving, so she pulled my mother out of the ranks and slapped her\nand my mother fell to the floor. Luckily she didn't shoot her right then and there. But my\nmother had an ear ailment, she damaged her ear. Until my mother died four years ago, this\nnever cleared up completely and it was from that time. But Mala's story has been written up.\nI know that. It is written in \u2014 I just recently read it again in a book Anus Mundi, by a Polish\nman.\u2019 He wrote about this extensively. And this was one of the other things that went on in\nAuschwitz. Every day was the same and for everyone, but not \u2014 and yet everyone has an\nindividual story of his individual tragedy, their individual story of hopeless and whatever\nhappened to them, so yes, it was all the same. We were all the same. We didn't even have a\nname. We had a number. We had our hair shaved, which was lucky because lice were by the\nbillions. But we also had individual things that we can remember and talk about.",
        "Q: Is there anything that you want to add about Auschwitz?",
        "A: Well, there's probably so much and I don't know. When this happened with \u2014 in the\nChristmas.... After Christmas, my mother dreamt \u2014 now I don't know how much of her\nconscious went into this dream \u2014 that my father told her that now is the time to say\nKaddish.'\u201d And we have kept that day well as a memorial to my father, because it's the only\nday that we can really \u2014 that's tangible. It is as valid as any other day, so we are using that\nday as memorial to my father \u2014 my brother and I. Well, we were taken from Malchow \u2014 from\n'\u2019 Mala Zimetbaum\n'\u00ae Wieslaw Kielar\n\" Holy One (Aramaic); Jewish prayer said to honor the dead, especially close family members.\nRavensbriick to Malchow. Malchow was \u2014 had been, originally, a labor camp equipped to\nhave about 1,000 people. But by the time we came in there were several thousand in the\ncamp. But 1t was amazing to us. There were actual table and chairs, benches. There was a\nreal water fountain. And there were bunk beds, which was two to a bed instead of six, with\nactual blankets. And there were cupboards to put your clothes in, little somethings. And of\ncourse we didn't have anything to put in, but we \u2014 they were there and they were signs of\ncivilization, something that.... It's amazing that how much, we had lived among civilized\nthings with the equipment of civilization. I was \u2014 nice furniture and everything, and yet when\nwe saw these crude closets we were amazed that this was civilization. And that there was\nsomething other than Auschwitz out there. And so we lived with in the in the camp with this\nand we were taken to a labor camp, to a labor to a factory to work. This was a labor camp,\nthis became a \u2014 but it became a concentration camp really because the SS officers went.\nSome of them came from Auschwitz with us and some were picked up in different places\nand they were there. We were taken in the morning and marched for about several miles to\nsomething that looked like woods. They were woods, and where the trees were sparse they\nplanted artificial trees, and there were nets with leaves overhead to camouflage the, the\nthings that were going on there. Then there was a sand hill with some trees coming out of It,\nand on the side was a door. Once you walked into this door it was like a very modern\nlooking laboratory or some very clean factory. It was actually an ammunition factory, very\nwell camouflaged from attack from over-fly \u2014 overhead planes. And we were \u2014 actually the\nwhole camp was honey-combed underneath with all these different factories. One group I\nknow was making hand grenades. Our group was making bullets.\nAnd for being such a very modern factory and very cleverly designed factory, there was\nreally the equip\u2014 the way we made the bullets was very primitive. There was a board with\nlittle holes in it that I think there were 24 or whatever the number, tiny little small holes, and\nthere was a\u2014 we \u2014 there was a half a capsule of a bullet put in \u2014 that we put 1t in\u2014into each\none of the holes. Then we filled a certain amount of gunpowder into it, and then the other\nhalf of this board closed over it. Something like a waffle iron, on that idea, or a hamburger\npress. And the other half of the capsule of the bullet was pushed down and that made a bullet\nthat would be used I guess in a regular gun. At both ends of the table \u2014 these were long tables\nwe were sitting at and must have been about 20 or 30 prisoners on each table \u2014 and on each\nend was a SS woman making sure that we did the right thing. Well, it was very difficult but I\ntried to not line up the top with the bottom part of this board as much as I could without\nbeing detected because I really didn't want to be hit or killed or whatever. But I tried to sort\nof squeeze it in a crooked way so that it would close but not quite. And I was hoping that\nthese bullets would misfire and I was hoping that in this way it would be my part of the war\neffort against the Nazis. Well, we worked in this camp, and after the first of the year\nAuschwitz was \u2014 I think in the beginning of January, Auschwitz was emptied and they\nbrought a lot of prisoners from Auschwitz to Malchow, I guess, and different places. Most of\nthe prisoners who came to Auschwitz, who came from Auschwitz were the Gypsies. Of\ncourse you know, the Gypsies had been in a camp in Auschwitz and they were killed by\nfamilies, just the way the Jews were killed. Because, in this hierarchy of \u201csuperman\u2019\u2019 that the\nGermans established, the Gypsies were just about one rank higher than the Jews and, of\ncourse, they had to be eliminated because they were a \u201clower people.\u201d And so we saw the\nGypsies in the camp and they were first brought in the end of \u2014 the middle of 1944,\nsomething like that. They might have been there before but I became aware of them at that\ntime. And then they were brought to Malchow and they were very nice. They were happy-\ngo-lucky people. They sang. And maybe because they knew that the end of the Nazi era was\ncoming \u2014 we weren't aware of it as much but they had been walking from Auschwitz to\nMalchow which 1s I don't know how many miles, hundreds of miles \u2014 and they had seen\nwhat was going on. They had taken meat of the dead horses and they brought it to camp and\nthey barbecued it and they shared it with who ever came along. It was exceedingly nice. And\nI mean they \u2014 I really have very, very good memories of the Gypsy people. The only thing\nthat they did is that they were looking for wood to barbecue the meat. They took apart the\ntoilets, the doors, and there was no place where to go any more, so we had to squat just over\na hole rather than over this little bit of wooden frame that was made for toilet. But the\nGypsies were very nice when they were brought in the camp. And you know, I do speak\nabout I do speak on the Holocaust very often, schools, churches, colleges, and I do want to\nmention the Gypsies because until recently no one set up a memorial. No one did anything\nfor them and the poor Gypsies are \u2014 I mean so many died unnamed that something \u2014\nsomeone should remember that there were these people at one time and they were a kind and\ngentle people. Throughout the history of Europe they were really denounced and, and feared\nand everything and they were very, very nice and gentle and very helpful. But the \u2014 and they\nwere in a camp with us.\nWe were in a camp then when more and more people came in and eventually they could not\ntake us to the factories anymore, and we stayed in the camp. The roads became clogged with\neastern Europeans trying to get back to their homes, and Russian \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 German\nsoldiers trying to run away from the Russian armies going, west and refugees \u2014 German\nrefugees who lived in Poland and were afraid of what would then happen to them were\ntrying to make it to Germany. And most of the roads were clogged with this and you couldn't\nget \u2014 you couldn't go to work anymore. And of course everything was breaking down and\nwe \u2014 nothing was happening any more. So \u2014 but what happened when in the last few days\nbefore the war ended was they also didn't give us any food any more and there were food\nriots because we were actually starving. The warehouses were full of \u2014 well, they were not\nfull, but there was bread in the warehouses and the prisoners were \u2014 didn't get anything so\nwe rioted to get in. And my one \u2014 think a day or two, we were liberated \u2014 we were made to\nwalk out of the camp, march out of the camp on May 1, 1945. A day or two before there\nwere these food riots and some\u2014sometimes the Nazis from outside the camp \u2014 this German\nofficer would see the riots so they would shoot at the prisoners, sometimes. And once in a\nwhile someone was hurt from the shootings. Sometimes they shot in the air. But they\ncouldn't stop us. I mean we knew that things were already happening and we really lost more\nand more of our fear you know, to some degree anyway. And so we went \u2014 we were rioting\nand my mother was in the barracks and I was out and she was told that someone had been\nshot and of course she immediately imagined that 1t was me, but it wasn't. We stormed the\nfood barracks and that afternoon \u2014 that must have been the day before we were leaving \u2014 the\nfood that the Nazis were eating \u2014 these Nazi officers in their mess hall \u2014 was left on the table,\nuntouched like some of the fairy tales. You know, the stuff is sitting there and the people are\ngone. And we were starved, but we ignored it and we were looking for the chamber where\nthey would keep all the food. So, we came to the storage place, and there was something that\nlooked like noodles to me. Now, you have to realize I haven't had \u2014 I didn't have anything\ndecent to eat you know in these years and noodles, my God. I took the noodles hoping that\nwe would be able to at some point cook them and eat them, but I didn't know how, what to\ndo, how to carry these. Well, we already had been given regulation underwear, gray flannel.\nIt was tied with a string and that was it, but among the things that I wasn't supposed to wear\nwas somewhere that I had found a pair of pink silk underwear. So I had that underneath the\ngray flannel. So I took off the gray flannels, pulled out the string, tied 1t on the bottom and\nmade a bag and put these noodles in.\nWe then were told to line up to leave the camp. At that point the Swedish Red Cross had sent\npackages for the prisoners. And the first few prisoners, each one got a package, and then it\nwas two to a package and because they were running out of packages. Then it was five to a\npackage. And then by the time it came to us it was five to a package, which was a lucky\nthing because these packages contained cocoa and sardines and butter and our stomachs\nwere not used to this. My mother became deadly ill from just eating something oily. I think\nsardines. You know, we fell over it and actually she ended up in a hospital \u2014 in a British\narmy hospital, for a few days because she was so sick. The right thing to \u2014 would have been\nprobably to have some cereal a few times a day cooked in water and gradually bring our\nstomachs back to normal. But that of course didn't happen. So we were given these packages\nand gradually everyone along the way had diarrhea and we were marched out of the camp\nand the SS went with us. A few disappeared as we were marched along. At one time we\nwere taken over a make-shift bridge. The bridge had been destroyed but we had to get over a\nsmall part of the river, and they took, there was a tavern on the hill below \u2014 above the bridge,\nand the bridge was below and the river was all the way down. So they took tables and tied\nthe legs together and made a bridge, and we could only go over like two or three people at a\ntime. Was a beautiful sunset I remember and we were walking over this. And then we got to\nanother part and I'm carrying this bag of noodles, what I thought was noodles, with me right\nalong. And then on the way wherever we went, we managed to find \u2014 it was I guess harvest\ntime or whatever, we found potatoes in the ground, and we managed to make a bonfire and\nbake the potatoes. They were most of the time just charred on the top and the inside was raw.\nThey tasted horrible but we managed to at least eat that. And I carried this bag with noodles\nwith me, waiting for an opportunity to cook it. Gradually the SS did disappear and\nsometimes they put on clothes to make them look like they were part of us. We knew who\nthey were, and of course they did have a tattoo under their arm to identify them as SS people.\nBut of course we didn't see that and they thought well maybe no one would know about it\nand they would get away, you know, by just mixing with the population and pretending that\nthey had \u2014 were nice people.\nSo at one time we were brought into what had been a sugar factory, was completely empty. I\nguess there was no more sugar available. And an SS woman saw me pass by and she called\nme into a small office and she was cleaning her guns there. And she said to me, \u201cI guess\nyou'll be free soon.\u201d And I was afraid to say, \u201cOh, how wonderful! Of course. I'm glad my\ntime 1s finally coming.\u201d So, I was saying. \u201cOh well, maybe it won't be so fast yet.\u201d I was\ntrying to tell her something, and I think it might have saved my life, knowing full well that,\nof course, liberation was just a few days away. But I was afraid to antagonize her yet, and\nthat was actually my last encounter with them. They really sort of disappeared and when\nthey finally \u2014 when we finally did see them again, they were checked for this tattoo under\ntheir arm pits, by \u2014 I think the British part of the army that we saw. Well, anyway coming\nback to my noodles and these horrible potatoes that we were broiling \u2014 baking on the way.\nFinally, my mother found a rusty can of some sort and we went up \u2014 we were right along the\nocean, the North Sea, and my mother went and got some water. And she went to see that we\nfinally would cook these potatoes, these noodles, I'm sorry. Well the thing grew and grew\nand grew, and what I had dragged from Malchow were dehydrated potatoes when all we had\nwas potatoes and I had dragged this out. It was one of my real disappointments of \u2014 you\nknow, of having this. But it was part of the life that went on in that was part of, of Auschwitz\n\u2014a part of my experiences. When of course when my mother and I walked on, we were near\nthe Elbe and we \u2014 the first thing we know, we saw was this tank with different insignias on\nit. It was an American army tank saluting us and we went one way and they went the other\nway. And then it \u2014 within a few hours, occupation forces changed, because all the different\nforces were meeting at in that spot \u2014 so at one time the French and British and Russians. And\nwe ended up in a British, in a British zone in \u2014 at the time in a zone \u2014 I don't know what it\nfinally became. And we were there in a like a tent city which was during the summer, which\nwas alright. We were in one section of the camp and on the other side there was another tent\ncamp where there were Italian soldiers. It seems that when Mussolini was hanged he was \u2014\nthe soldiers in the Italian army had a choice of either joining the German army or becoming\nprisoners of war. These soldiers that were on the other side of the camp had been the\nprisoners of war, and they were now being repatriated to Italy. The only thing was I mean the\ntransportation was destroyed and communications were hardly working. So the they were\nsitting in this camp waiting for things to normalize so they were in one camp and we were in\nthis camp. Then when it was \u2014 when summer was coming to an end, the British army had to\nsee \u2014 you know, they couldn't keep us out in the winter. And they made some kind of travel\narrangements for us in trucks and on cart, rail, whatever was available to get back to\nFrankfurt. They asked us where we wanted to go.\nNow we had agreed with my father and everyone \u2014 you know, my brother and my mother \u2014\nthat whoever would live would try to make his way back to Frankfurt and so we could be\nunited as a family and then see where we would go from there. So we arrived in Frankfurt,\nsometime in the Fall. We came back, and the city was practically destroyed. Almost\neverything was gone. Even my mother who had no great love for anything German that had\nhappened, after what had happened to us, really was like shocked when she saw this, saw\nthis horrible destruction. And we stayed overnight in this hotel near the near the railroad\nstation where all kinds of people met. And everybody exchanged experiences and there was\nno place else to go. At one point in that evening an American soldier came 1n and he had\nlooked at the lists that the UNRRA\u201d and the HIAS\u201d' had printed of survivors and \u2014 as much\ninformation as they could, the origin and birthplace of the people. So, he had seen that we\nwere from Frankfurt and he was looking for a family in Frankfurt. He had left before the war\nand been in the American Army and was now looking for relatives, hoping that someone\ncould tell them what had happened to him \u2014 to them. And in the conversation \u2014 we didn't\nknow anything about his relatives \u2014 but in the conversation, he mentioned that while he was\ndoing the same thing in \u2014 while he was in Italy he had read about a young boy who was also\nfrom Frankfurt. So he went to ask him about his relatives. And the young boy fit the\ndescription of my brother. So we said, \"How do I write to him? How do I \u2014 can I get in touch\nwith him?\" So he, he gave us an Army post number, and we wrote to them. And somehow,\nthe letter did get to my brother and he was in Baury(ph) at the time. He had been liberated\nnear the Austrian border. He had remained in Auschwitz until the end. And in January of\n1945, they emptied Auschwitz. They were burning all the bodies and all the evidence that\nwas around, as much as they could, of course. By then they were scared stiff for their own\nlives. They thought that everything that happened, that they had done to other people, would\nhappen to them. And they should have been scared. My brother was telling me that he\nlooked out at the crematorium, and he knew that they were packing up people to go, to go on\nthis big march. And they were.... He was looking out, and an SS man approached him and\nsaid, \"Hah! You can go there, too.\u201d Or, \u201cYou're going to be sent there, too.\" And my brother\nsaid, \"You know, I don't care anymore what happens to me. So much has happened to me. I\ndon't care what you do to me.\" He said, \"Because you said that, go out and join the march.\"\nSo he went. And he walked until he was, somewhere, liberated near Austria. And he was\ntaken \u2014 he met up with the British contingent of \u2014 actually, the Israeli contingent of the\nBritish Army. They had an army, and they were anxious to get my brother into Israel and\nPalestine at the time. Because he was a minor, and he was only one of \u2014 you know, minors\nwere \u2014 the British allowed in. And they felt, well, in a few more years he'll be old enough to\ngo into the Israeli Army. And they knew there would be, there would be a war, and there\nwould \u2014 he would be needed. And this indeed what happened. But we wrote to him, and he\nwas already embarking to \u2014 by the time the mail got to him, he was already going to Israel.\nAnd eventually \u2014 he had been hurt in Auschwitz. He didn't tell us that he had a problem with\nhis arm. And they did surgery on his arm. And because he could not lift his arm for any \u2014 he\nhad a very serious infection, he couldn't lift his arm past just his shoulder height \u2014 the Israeli\narmy then discharged him. And so he was able to leave Israel very young, and he came to the\n*\u00b0 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\n*! United Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society.\nUnited States. But we\u2019re always up and back with Israel. And that was \u2014 we stayed around in\nFrankfurt, hoping \u2014 even though we knew better \u2014 that my father somehow could have made\nhis way back. I wrote to Czechoslovakia, to his birthplace, thinking that maybe somehow he\nwould have ended up there. Maybe he was sick. Maybe he was somewhere in a hospital.\nBut, of course, all this hope disappeared soon and on the last day that our visa to come to the\nUnited States was still good, was when we finally embarked and, and gave up all hope that\nmy father was alive. But I still didn't give up hope. Even when I came here I kept thinking,\n\u201cOh well, maybe somewhere, somehow I will hear that he is someplace else.\u201d But of course,\nno.",
        "Q: Tell us about your early years?",
        "A: This was in Frankfurt. When I sometimes think that the war against the Jews didn't just start\nin 1933. It started much earlier \u2014 ended up in 1933. One of my first memories was probably\nbefore the Hitler election in 1932 or so. We \u2014 I lived, we lived in an apartment, the second\nfloor \u2014 third floor, and the, there was a, a propaganda banner for the Socialist \u2014 National\nSocialist, Nazis \u2014 strung between \u2014 across the streets down between the two apartment\nhouses. And there was a lot of agitation in the air. I mean a lot of agra\u2014 they were really\ntrying to get to the Jewish people, and to, to convince the non-Jews that they should vote for\nthe Nazis because Jews were their enemy \u2014 and also against Communists, against anything\nthat they wanted to be against. And so this banner was across \u2014 was strung across and I\nlooked down. My parents had gone out, left me in the house and I had \u2014 I saw the banner and\nI looked down. And but you know when you're three years old you don't have depth\nperception, and I don't think \u2014 and to me it seemed like it was a barrier and my parents would\nnever come back. And from that time on I did \u2014 I think I've told you this \u2014 and from that time\non I knew that, you know, everything was topsy-turvy. We \u2014 this \u2014 I think I have very many\nbad memories of people being killed, of relatives being taken away. My Aunt Selma\nvolunteered. Her, her fianc\u00e9 was \u2014 my Aunt Selma could have stayed behind. Her fianc\u00e9 was\ntaken to the \u2014 to be selected to go to Poland, ostensibly, \u201cresettlement in the east\u201d as 1t was\ncalled. And she just volunteered to go with him, and we never heard of or saw her again.\nAnd that was, that was life in Germany and Europe.",
        "Q: After the war, you are in Frankfurt. How did you get from Frankfurt to United States?",
        "A: Oh, very simple. I mean there were organizations that helped. The HIAS, the UNRRA had\ntheir own groups. And we were told that we \u2014 was some form of Jewish organization. Of\ncourse there was a very large displaced persons camp in Zeilsheim which was out on the\noutskirts of Hochst, which 1s on the outskirts of Frankfurt. And you \u2014 you know, you listened\nto everything through the grapevine and we were told we should sign up \u2014 go to the\nAmerican Embassy or Consulate and get our papers. And we did that. And then, of course,\nwe waited, because of my \u2014 because we thought of my father and we waited until the last\nday to get to, to embark. But that is what we did. And of course in the United States, we\nwere met by ladies from the HIAS and the UNRRA. And HIAS were actually in the \u2014 and\nwe were put for a few nights into a hotel on off-Broadway. I think it was on 103rd Street and\noff-Broadway, or something like that. And then my mother took a job in Clifton, New Jersey\nand we stayed there.",
        "Q: How \u2014 you were telling me earlier, the way people reacted to you in the United States. Can\nyou talk about that?",
        "A: Yes. Iam not happy to talk about it. It seems that we were not treated as having had the\nexperiences that we did. We were not treated as equal human beings, somehow. We were\ntold to take work as laborers, as domestics and this sort of thing. And even though now my\nhusband had been an American soldier \u2014 and to him I was someone who had survived a\ncamp and had been brave enough and human enough to survive and be treated as a human\nbeing \u2014 his mother didn't go along with this. To her everything that was European \u2014 and she\nwas born in Eastern Europe \u2014 everything that was European was lowly and despised \u2014\ndespic\u2014despicable, and shouldn't be.... She wanted to stay away from this and she didn't\nwant to have anything to do with it and so this was wasn't good enough for her son. And I\ndid have a lot of problems with her, and I found, in general, that a lot of people had this sort\nof reaction. I was active in the Memorial Committee \u2014the Holocaust Memorial which is\nusually sometimes in April \u2014 and the people \u2014 the men who had worked on this before I\nbecame active in it, told me that they had a lot of resistance to making a memorial service\nand to even speaking about this. And they had difficulty getting a stage to do the memorial\nservice and it has only become fashionable to \u2014 I don't know, in the last 20 or so years \u2014 to\nspeak about it, and to not consider it a badge of shame which \u2014 of course, which it wasn't.\nBut I think we as surviv\u2014 as prisoners of the Nazis were told that we were\n\u201cUntermenschen, ~\u201d sub\u2014sub-humans. That we were not up to par. And I think it was so\ndrilled into us that we kept actually believing that it still was true. And what we really should\nhave had, was a lot of counseling. But, of course, organizations were more \u2014 they found the\nimmediate need for clothing us, and feeding us, and finding shelter that that was really\nsecondary.\nIt would have been just as important as any of the other things, because a lot of people\nfloundered, have terrible traumatic lives since then because of that. And this 1s one of the \u2014 I\nthink \u2014 things that have been learned that now most people do get counseling after hostage\nsituations or after prison situations. And immediately they do get counseling and it's very,\n** Sub-humans (German); term used to refer to people deemed inferior according to Nazi racial\ntheory.\nvery important. It's one of the things that can't be stressed enough. So life was very, very\ndifficult for people arriving from home, without a family, with their whole background\ndestroyed, without any means of support. And those who did not want to be a burden to \u2014\nand consider whatever the HIAS is doing \u2014 I mean, I considered it as charity; and I wanted to\nget away from it as quick as possible. But to the people who did that, they really had to\nstruggle from the bottom up.",
        "Q: How did you meet your husband?",
        "A: Well I was moping around and my mother was working and I did a lot of reading and all I\nwanted to do was read and I was very anxious to improve my English. I did a lot of reading,\nand my mother didn't like the idea of my being home by myself all the time. So she told\nsome young woman that she knew that she should take me out with her when\u2014whenever.\nAnd there was a dance in the Y, and she \u2014 we went up there. She somehow disappeared. I\nwas left up there. And my husband asked me to dance, but I didn't really \u2014 I wasn't really\nthinking of dating and I really didn't want to go out. So, \u201cWell, I'll just dance for the evening,\nand then I went home.\u201d And he wanted to walk with me, and I didn't let him. And then there\nwas the city hall \u2014 this was in Paterson and the city hall was in the middle of the street. And I\nwas walking along one street; he was walking along another street, trying to catch up with\nme. And he met me at the bus stop. And after that, he started dating me. That\u2019s what\nhappened.",

        "A: I am Ruth Krautwirth Meyerowitz.",
        "A: I was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 19290 \u2014 June 23, 1929. My father was born in Slovakia\n\u2014 what became Slovakian during the Second World War; and he came to Germany when he\nwas about two years old. And he was, I'm sorry to say, in the Austrian Army during World\nWar I. And my parents were married in 1927. My father had just started a business, and he\nwas in leather good business. Frankfurt 1s \u2014 the Jews in Frankfurt \u2014 many Jews in Frankfurt,\nwere in the leather good business actually, across the river in Offenbach. And then during the\nwar, he had to leave the business in Offenbach and move, to move the business into\nFrankfurt. Was behind in the, in the commercial district, behind the main railroad station.\nAnd I have a younger brother, four years younger. He is now \u2014 he now lives in New Jersey,\ntoo. And I live in New Jersey, of course. And in 1933 \u2014 I have memories from the events, the\nchaotic events that went on in Germany in 19\u2014 from 1933, probably 1932 on. But, of course,\nthe \u2014 I understand, going back into history, that there was a lot of continuous up\u2014 unrest in\nGermany, from the end of the war actually and through the Depression and all this. But\nactually on account of the inflation. But I'm, of course, was too young to know of anything. I\nhave memories from when I was about two, three years old. The first thing that I remember,\nwas that there was sort of unrest and fear in the air. And one day, my parents went out and\nleft me with help. And I was worried because everything seemed so insecure all at once. So\nand we lived in an apartment about on the third floor which is probably is.... And I went out\non the balcony and looked for my parents. And of course, when you're that age I don't think\nyou have any depth perception. And there was a banner slung between the two apartment\nbuildings and to me it seemed like it was a barrier that no one would be able to cross\nanymore, and I was very fearful that my parents would not be able to come back to me. It\nwas a banner; it was political banner that was put up by the Nazi party. I don't know what, I\ndon't remember what it said. But that was my very first memory of Nazi, the rise of the\nNazis. My uncle, my father's youngest brother, was a budding reporter as they would say in\ntoday's jargon, and he worked for a German newspaper. Apparently had written something\nor maybe, I don't know, maybe his political views were not anything the Nazis liked.\nAnyway, he was hunted, hunted down. He was taken to a \u2014 he was, at first he was working\non the newspaper. And one day my father \u2014 and I was three years old \u2014 my father told, told\nme that, \u201cIf some men come and asked you where Uncle Julius is, you should tell them that\nyou had just seen him this morning or the night before or some such.\u201d Because he wanted to\nsort of cool his trail. If he had left by then, he was fleeing from the Nazis and made his way\nto Czechoslovakia, and sure enough some men came, and I was really itching to tell them\nthat my uncle wasn't here, but thank God they never asked me. They just spoke to my father.\nThey wanted to know where my uncle was, and he ended up in Czechoslovakia, and they\nnever caught him until much later. He was working in western part of Czechoslovakia in\nPilsen and when the Nazis came in, of course he tried to make his way east, away from them,\nand he went by motorcycle and had an accident, had a broken leg and brought him to the\nhospital. And of course by then the occupying Nazi, Nazi forces \u2014 the German army, knew\nwho he was and they took him out of the hospital and took him to jail and he was shot there.\nSo they did eventually catch up with him.\nSo these were my very earliest memories of living in a police state in Nazi Germany. When,\nof course in the very beginning they \u2014 the Nazis did now allow any money to be paid out or\nwhatever foreign money or any monies were in Jewish bank accounts was stopped. Of\ncourse they had to open the accounts again especially since my brother was getting money\nfrom out of the country foreign exchange with better interest. Which they were anxious to\nget in because they needed it, so it seemed that for a very short time life might be fairly\nnormal in a large city. It wasn't in the small cities. There was a lot of beating and harassment\nof Jews of all kinds, but in a city like Frankfurt, it didn't quite begin. I didn't feel it until\nmuch later, but gradually they encroached on our liberties. I was walking with my family on\nthe side of a park once, and a young boy on a bicycle knocked me over and went over my\nknee. He didn't break anything, but my parents were even afraid to go to the police and\nreport it, report it to anyone because it would only have meant problems for us. So since I\nwasn't seriously hurt they took me home and nursed my knee and that was it.\nWhen, sometime ago, my family \u2014 my sons, my husband and I \u2014 went back to Frankfurt on a\nsort of very bittersweet tour, we \u2014 I wanted to show them the Jewish places and the rich\nJewish history, if anything could be found \u2014 the places that I remembered and the places that\nmade sense within Jewish history to them. And we were walking from the last apartment\nwhere we had lived, on the way to where my school was. This school, incidentally, was a\nrather well-known school. The educational process 1s still being studied today. They were\nvery progressive. It's Philantropin \u2014 I don't know if you've heard of it but it was a really well\nknown school. And anyway, there was a few blocks walk to the school from my first house,\nand we passed a house that has been left standing, and it brought back a terrible memory of\nsomething that had happened. There was a little girl in my brother's class. She was four years\nyounger, I mean he's four years younger than I, so she was, must have been the same age as\nmy brother. And she was, I don't know, maybe at the time eight or seven or something like\nthat. Her father had done something that the Nazis didn't like, and so rather than punish him\noutright, they took this little girl and had her sterilized, and then returned to the father. And\nthat is, I mean, a much more terrible thing. Now that I have grandchildren and I see my sons\nhaving their daughters almost that age, this is a most terrible thing that you can do to a\nparent. It's worse than taking and chopping a parent's hand off or something like that. And\nwe passed this house and I told them the story and it was absolutely \u2014 they were absolutely\nstunned. I mean they had heard and read every-everything about the Holocaust and about the\npersecutions and all, but standing 1n front of the house where this actually went \u2014 where this\ngirl actually had lived, it was really quite mind-boggling. And of course eventually, everyone\nwas killed anyway, but this was one of the terrible things that went on as the war progressed\nand as the war against the Jews progressed. Actually the war against Jews didn't really start\nin Europe in 1939. It started in Germany. It became a hot war in 1933, but I think German\nhistory 1s, is full of war against Jews, cold and hot and in between.",
        "A: I was going to school. Many of the teachers left. Many of them committed suicide. They\nwere disillusioned with what was, and they were afraid of the future and when I've gone\nback to the cemetery and I've seen some of their graves and they are all, they all fall in this in\na certain time period. It must have been at one point the realization that everybody would be\nkilled and people preferred to die in their own beds and by their own choice. And so I do go\nthe cemeteries and I recognize some of the names and I put a stone and I remember what has\nhappened. But, I did go to school and many of my friends left. And then more and more\nrestrictions were placed on Jewish teaching. We were allowed \u2014 I mean \u2014 I guess they\ncouldn't control that we were learning Hebrew and the Bible and Jewish history and.... But\nwe were not allowed to play Jewish music by Jewish composers and it was very funny. My \u2014\nwhen the school stopped, my brother and I took violin lessons. Pretty bad, we were pretty\nbad. But anyway when \u2014 after we were not allowed to go to school anymore, my mother\nwanted us \u2014 to keep us busy I guess, to keep practicing. And we were playing together the\nBarcarole from Tales of Hoffman and for some reason some Nazis, Gestapo men, came up to\nsee us for I don't know what. And they heard us scratch away on the violin and they asked us\nwhat we were playing, and we were afraid to say that this was by a Jewish composer. Of\ncourse, Offenbach\u2019 was not allowed to be played. Neither was Mendelssohn\u2019 and all the\nother Jewish composers or even if they were remotely related to Jewish composers. Because\nI guess they figured I couldn't \u2014 we couldn't do much harm with our playing so they didn't\nsay anything. But that was one of the many harassments that went on.\nOur school was finally combined with the \u2014 another school, we \u2014 one of the two Jewish\nschools in Frankfurt that had existed from \u2014 for at least 100 years. I mean students had left,\nand there were very few left behind, and then of course some were sent out on transports into\n\u2014 we didn't know, but it was ostensibly, of course, for repatriation into the east or for\nsettlement in the east. And of course that was not true, but we were told that that's what it\n\u2018J acques (nee Jacob) Offenbach\n* Felix Mendelssohn\nwas. They \u2014 when my good friend Irma was taken away \u2014 and many, many of our \u2014 of my\nfriends and then the school building was closed and we had classes for a very short time in\nthe an old orphanage building, the Jewish orphanage building. And then of course, school\nwas stopped completely. And because my father was a Slovak citizen, and because he had \u2014\nhis business was taken over by a German Nazi. He was a dentist, and he we think that he was\nan executioner because whenever the grapevine said that there had been some kind of\nshooting of German dissidents, he was away from the business. And he walked around, with\na gun, he had a gun in my father's desk and whenever he called my father in for consultation,\nhe would open the drawer and they, the conversation would go on over a gun sitting in the\nmiddle of my father's desk. And so he wanted to keep my father because this man knew\nabsolutely nothing about running the business, so he wanted to keep my father on. My father\nhad the choice of staying behind when we were supposed to be sent to the east. And he could\nhave stayed behind and just had his family go but he didn't want to do this. He thought he\ncould protect us if he would come with us, and ironically, very sadly, he is the one who did\nnot survive the war. My brother and my mother and I managed to scratch out of it and\nsurvive. So, because of that, we were among the last few full Jews \u2014 I mean there were a lot\nof mixed marriages, and there were a lot of off-spring you know who were half Jewish.\nThose were \u2014 some of them were let sent to Theresienstadt after we left \u2014 but we were\namong the full Jews the last few to be sent to Auschwitz.\nNow the reason we were not put into \u2014 and we were told we were not put into a car with the\ngas going \u2014 was that we were such a small transport and it didn't pay for them to use up a\nwhole lot of gas. So, they figured they'd send us into Auschwitz and we would be somehow\ndead within a short time anyway, so they just shipped us over. And on the way to Auschwitz,\nwe were joined by a lot of Polish prisoners. But they were forced laborers, women, who\nwere taken into Germany when the Germans occupied Poland. They were probably \u2014 maybe\nthey said they didn't like the food or they objected to something, and they were then taken to\na concentration camp. So as we were going along, and we were only riding during the day\nbecause at night the planes, the Allied planes flew overhead and they didn't, and of course\nthe planes had no way of knowing who was in there. If they thought that we carried\nammunition they would bomb us. So they made us stay at night in different places, in prisons\nand whatever along the way. And we did the few hundred miles to Auschwitz in, I think,\nsomething like seven days and no nights. But wherever we went, we picked up several\nprisoners and they \u2014 non-Jewish prisoners \u2014 and they went to camp with us. But we were the\nlast Jews, were about 37 of us. And as far as I know, only my mother and my brother and I,\nand one other young boy survived. And I think that was a pretty high percentage because if\nwe had been gassed of course no one would have been alive from the transport.\nAnd at the \u2014 when you arrived in Auschwitz \u2014 with all the pictures that you see of the SS\nmen with the dogs and a beautiful bright day in April.... We were taken away on the 19th of\nApril which was Hitler's birthday \u2014 or the 20\", or something. It was the 20th wasn't it? This\nwas supposed to be a birthday present to the Fiihrer, that Germany would be Judenrein,\u2019 and\nthat was why they shipped, gathered us on the 19th of April. And it took us about a week to\nget there, and it was a beautiful, bright, lovely day. It seems almost impossible that\nsomething this horrible could go on in the world on a beautiful day like that. We saw my\nfather, from far away, and that was the last I ever saw of him. And we went into Auschwitz.\nOur clothes were taken away. Our hair was shaved off. My brother stayed with us for a very\nshort time \u2014 was allowed to be in camp with us. And then they decided that it wasn't moral\nfor a young boy to live with all these women who would sometimes would be in the nude.\nBut of course it was very moral for them to have us to get undressed and to parade in front of\nan SS officer or a few SS officers anytime they wished and anytime a whimsy struck them\nyou know. But this was immoral and my brother was taken to the men's camp, and he\nmanaged to live through it somehow and of course he survived.",
        "A: When she saved \u2014 when she pulled me away. I\u2014 when I came to Auschwitz, a few months\nlater, I think, almost everybody became very sick. My mother had malaria too, but she never\nhad typhus. I was the one who came down with typhus, and I have very little memory of\nwhat went on. But my mother dressed me every morning, took me out to this Zahlappell\u00b0 \u2014\nwhich is the equivalent of roll call \u2014 and dragged me to work so that I wouldn't be beaten or\nsent into the hospital \u2014 the barracks which was, which was really a death barracks. So my\nmother dragged me around, but of course I looked terrible. And there was the Selektion for\nthe gas chambers one time, and we were standing outside and this SS man told me to go in\none direction and my mother into another because I looked so sick. And of course I was just\nwasting the food \u2014 this 200 calories worth of food that they gave us everyday. So my mother\npleaded with him and said that, well, I'm her child and she, can't she come with, can't I come\nwith her? And he said, \u201cNo, but if you're so concerned about your daughter, go with her.\u201d\nAnd she was just about to do this, and, and one of the women, who was working in the\nbarracks \u2014 I think she swept floors and whatever and maybe cleaned the chimney, the stoves\nand whatever other menial work, but she had some kind of protected position, whatever that\nwas worth \u2014 she sort of grabbed me under one arm and my mother grabbed my other arm,\nand we managed to walk away. We were not even stopped, and it was some kind of miracle\nthat the SS man didn't notice that or, or pretended not to notice us. And just, and we just kept\ngoing and my life was saved that day. It was really the most amazing thing. I can't figure out.\n* Leader (German)\n* Jew Pure (German); Nazi term used to describe areas that had been completely purged of their\nJewish population.\n> Selection (German); term used for process of selecting prisoners for immediate liquidation or\ncontinued forced labor.\n\u00b0 roll call count (German)\nOf course, I was sick and I don't know exactly what went on \u2014 the excitement of the moment.\nBut my life was saved that day",
        "A: Well, of course the first day we arrived my hair was shaved and we were standing\ncompletely in the nude and I was frightened. I was thirteen years old. I called my mother,\nand she answered me and I turned around to look for her, but I didn't recognize her because,\nof course, she had no hair. Was impossible to recognize her totally without clothes and\nwithout hair. And then, we were tattooed and of course was nothing like the, the disinfectant\nor anything put on the ta\u2014 on the needles. Everybody's tattoo became slightly infected but it \u2014\nthat stopped. And we were brought into barracks, at first into the \u201cA\u201d camp and then later on\ninto the \u201cB\u201d camp. One of our first chores was \u2014 they had \u2014 the roads in Auschwitz were\nterrible. They were muddy and then the mud dried. It was full of ruts, so they had this big\nsteamroller. But 1t wasn't propelled by steam, it was pushed by prisoners. It was tremendous\nand they filled it up with sand. You had to fill it with sand, so it would be heavy, and then\nsomeone had to go out and push it to even the road. So, one of our first jobs was to fill this\nsteamroller and then later on \u2014 or whatever it was, 1t was a tremendous roller \u2014 and then later\non to push it across the ruts to try and even out the road. I don't think it was very successful.\nAnd one of our next jobs was to even out the road, to dig out wherever the road was higher\nand to fill in where the road was lower. It really didn't make any sense because we dug parts\nof the road out, filled in another hole. And it seemed like this kind of work was designed to\ntake our energy away and to make us weak. And I think that was the purpose, to demoralize\nus and to sap our strength. Then we were in a camp \u2014 in the barracks and we had this horrible\nfood. Where we had \u2014 they once \u2014 I don't know, a few times a week, maybe two or three\ntimes a week \u2014 we had a slice of salami which was about an inch thick and sometimes it was\nliverwurst. And something that came out of rusty barrels \u2014 it was called \u201ctea\u201d \u2014 and\nsometimes they had soup. They made soup out of bean \u2014 no some kind of turnips, that\nweren't even peeled and potato peels and the sand wasn't washed off. And they just threw\neverything together, and even at times they emptied out bags that the people had brought\nfood when they were taken on a transport, and were \u2014 and it was \u2014 sometimes these bags of\nfood managed to get into the camp. But it wasn't assorted, they just emptied everything into\nthis pot of soup that they were cooking. We found combs and compacts and things like that\nsometimes in the soup, because they never bothered to assort it. And that was the food that\nwe had. And it must have been just a few hundred calories a day because everybody was\ngetting sick. One of the signs of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency is sores, and people had\nterrible sores which festered on their legs. It was just awful. And that was one of the things\nthat you could be taken to the crematorium for. As soon as someone had a sore like that, or\nthe scratches from scabies that was a reason to be taken to the crematorium.\nNow I was very fortunate. I also had scabies at one time but somehow it didn't get into my\nface. It stayed on my body, and there was a Selektion and they didn't, that day, make us take\noff our clothes. So they didn't that I had scabies and that also saved my life. Now scabies can\nbe cured with a few pennies worth of sulfur cream. But of course no one had it and they were\nnot interested in saving anyone of course. They were interested in having people get sick and\nhaving people die or be in such condition that they would take them to the crematorium. The\ncrematorium was just a few minutes away. We could see the chimneys from wherever we\nwere, and of course we could smell the gas when it was left, let out from the gas chambers.\nAnd then we could smell the burning of the bodies, the human flesh burning. Then they\ncleared the grates and we could hear the grates being cleaned and it's similar to what your\nown oven would be like when you move the grates around except in a much \u2014 it was much\nnoisier that we could hear all the way in the barracks. And to this day when I clean my own\noven, I am reminded of that noise of the cleaning of the grates in the crematorium.\nWell, we lived through the \u2014 these times. I made friends with a girl from Salonika and her\nsister. Her name was Nini Ben Mayoa(ph). She was about 18 at the time and her sister was a\nyear or two younger. I had not even realized that the Nazis were trying to eliminate even the\nJews of as far south as Greece and I understand. I saw \u2014 I met people in Jerusalem in 1981\nwho were from Rhodes and they had done the same thing to the Jews from Rhodes, and I\nreally wasn't aware that they were doing. Well, anyway, the Greek girls were taken from\ntheir homes. Most of them were from Salonika. They were taken from their homes and\nbrought to Auschwitz and of course their parents either had been killed or they were left\nbehind and were taken out another time. So I made friends with Nini Ben Mayoa. She was\nstudying to be an opera singer, and to us at the time, when she sang, it was like the most\nbeautiful thing you could ever hear. Maybe she had a beautiful voice. To me it now sounds\nlike she really, you know, she was like an angel singing. And of course there were Jews from\nall over Europe and every language was spoken in the camp except English.\nAnd they didn't get as far to, to the English Jews yet. So all the \u2014 they under-\u2014 they realized\nthat everybody in order to communicate \u2014 and luckily they didn't stop that \u2014 would speak in\nthe language that she would know. Nini and I could communicate in English because I had\nstudied English and so did she, and that was the only way \u2014 the only language that the two of\nus had in common. Of course this was forbidden. So because it was forbidden \u2014 I mean, you\nwere 13 years old, you \u2014 in spite of 1t everything \u2014 you tried, you think you're very brave.\nAnd so we were speaking 1n English and, and she told then the story that she was taken and\nthat she trying to be an opera singer. And she \u2014 whenever there was a chance, Nini would\nsing for the prisoners. And of course we had so few mental escapes, you know. We had so\nfew anything that was nice that was happening, that you were really, we begged her all the\ntime whenever she was being halfway in the mood to sing for us. Well, her sister died in the\nsummer and after that all the spirit went out of her. She just lost all hope and of course she\ndidn't sing anymore. But shortly before that somehow this SS man, Taube\u2019 \u2014 did you ever\nhear his name, Drechsler\u00ae and Taube? The woman's name was Drechsler and his name was\nTaube. They were not officers. They were \u2014 but they were the ones who kept order by\nbeating in the camps. Well, he had heard that Nini had a wonderful voice, and he proposed\nthat she live in his house, yes, and sing for him. And Nini knew what it meant. But you have\nto realize for the time that she would have been alive and of course you were hoping\neveryday that maybe through some miracle there would be some kind of release. But for the\ntime that she might have stalled and would have been alive, she might have lived in clean\nsheets and would have had a bath and would have had some fairly decent food. And so the\nsacrifice that she made was tremendous. She refused him. And among the next Selektions to\nthe gas chamber, her number was prominently mentioned and there was no way that anyone\ncould have erased the number. I mean he made sure that she was on that next transport to the\ngas chamber. And of course she was killed that way.\nBut I have been telling my sons about this and all their lives they've heard about Nini and\nhow the heroic stand that this girl took and her bravery of course. And when I was in\nJerusalem in 1980, \u201881, for the gathering, I was looking for people from Salonika because I\nreally had a very great rapport with most of them, I mean with all of them. They were really\nvery nice. They were \u2014 you know, young girls who spoke several languages \u2014 they were very\nhappy as far as it could go. They were, were very talented. They danced and they sang.\nThere was still a woman; her name was Stella, who did a lot of dancing and she entertained\nus. And I was told that she lived in Paris after the war, that she and her daughter had some\nkind of nightclub act. But I understand something sophisticated and everybody asked, \u201cWell,\nif you're so interested, how come you didn't find out about her?\u201d And I really never found\nout what became of Stella, but she did entertain us with some very beautiful dancing. But, so\nI went around looking for people who came from Salonika and I didn't meet anyone that I\nknew. But on the last night when President \u2014 Prime Minister Begin was speaking at the Wall\n\u2014 I heard someone, a man in back of me say that he was from Salonika. And of course my\nears stood up and I turned around and asked him some \u2014 if he knew any of my friends and I,\nin passing, mentioned that my friend had been Nini Ben Mayoa(ph). No, it's not good. But\nanyway, he said there was still a Mr. Ben Mayoa(ph) in Salonika. He's the head of the Jewish\ncommunity and I should get in touch with him. Well, of course, as soon as I came home I\ntried to figure out a way of getting in touch with him and the only thing I knew how to go\nabout getting a foreign address was get in touch with the Federation. And within a half hour I\nhad the address of the Jewish community in Athens who then forwarded the letter to Mr. Ben\nMayoa and Mr. Ben Mayoa 1s a cousin of Nini's. When they were in New York we had a\nvery nice visit. We met at the Jewish Theological Seminary because this is half-way between\nwhere he was staying and my \u2014 where my house was and a lot of reminiscences and of\ncourse we sort of corresponded for a while. It was very interesting to be able to reminisce\n\u2019 Adolf Taube\n\u00ae Margot Drechsler\nabout all the thing with Nini. One of the things that Nini sang and I guess it must have been\npart of her training was Av\u00e9 Maria. And of course I was \u2014 we always begged her to sing Av\u00e9\nMaria and to this day I am sometimes invited to Catholic weddings and I listen to Av\u00e9 Maria\nand of course I start crying. And everybody goes on look at this Jewish woman \u2014 how\ntouched by Av\u00e9 Maria, but they do not know the memories I have of Av\u00e9 Maria and Nini.\nAnd that was one of real unforgettable friendships that I did form in Auschwitz.\nAnd my mother and I were together for the whole time. At first we worked in a factory\nwhere they \u2014 it was called \u201cWeberei,\u201d\u201d \u201cthe weaving place.\u201d Radar was coming into\nprominence at that time, the British airforce used it against the Nazi airforce. The Nazis tried\nto stop \u2014 they tried to interfere and cause static so they made us weave. We were told that\nwhat it was \u2014 I am not a hundred percent sure. They made us weave plastic \u2014 braid plastic\nstrips and they were going to drop this, hoping that that would interfere with the radar\ntransmission. They were dropping this from planes and we were forced to keep plaiting these\nthings in the Weberei. This was one of the jobs in the Weberei and we worked there for a\nwhile. And somehow, through knowing someone, my mother and I were assigned to work in\nKanada,\u201d where all the belongings that came into the camp that the prisoners took with\nthem and \u2014 of course, everything was taken away from them. All this was brought in and\nassorted and than packed and sent into Germany. And even the word Kanada \u2014 spelled with\n\u201cK\u201d the German way, \u201cKANADA\u201d \u2014 it was a metaphor for all that is plentiful and available\nand just there because Canada, I guess to them, meant a lot of riches. And so that's what it\nwas nicknamed. My mother and I worked there, and we assorted mainly blankets and\ncomforters that people had taken with them, hoping that they would be able to use them. Of\ncourse most of them didn't even live to see what was happening with it, but even in the camp\nthey all had these raggedy old rags and for blankets. They were full of lice and every so often\nthey were cleaned and the straw mattresses. But when the things that were in Kanada were\nassorted and just sent to Germany, and one time was a tremendously high pile of comforters,\nand we had a few minutes during lunch break, and I had found a book Nathan the wise.\nActually the play of Nathan the Wise. During lunchtime, I crawled up on top of the mattress\nhoping that no one would see me, and I was reading it. But of course when you come in\ncame in from an angle at the, at the barracks, you could see me up on top there. And an SS\nwoman came in and called me down and took the book and threw it away and really boxed\nmy ears until I was dizzy for reading that. So even this small attempt at culture of course was\nstopped of course. I don't know if you realize that Nathan the Wise was written by a\nGerman\"? in praise of a Jew. But of course I don't know this, and probably she wasn't even\naware of it. It's just that she didn't want anything like this to be available as activity.\n7 Weaving mill (German)\n'\u201d Canada (German); term for the warehouse of looted goods at Auschwitz; also used to refer to\nprisoners who where assigned to work in the warehouse facilities.\n\u2018' Gotthold Ephraim Lessing\nWhile I'm \u2014 the belt? Right, the belt. While I \u2014 while we were in \u2014 working in Kanada we\nwere not allowed to wear what was really \u2014 would be considered civilian clothes. While, the\npeople in camp, in the camps, were not given these stripped clothes, not all of them, they\nwere wearing stripped clothes. They were given the old rag clothes that were taken off the\nbodies, and given to them and they lasted until they really fell off and they were full of mud\nand filth and lice. And then every so often they, they would \u2014 the lice \u2014 the clothes were\ntaken away and they were put in the gas chamber to kill the lice, and then of course all the\nnits were dead but they were all sitting in the seams and were still there. And those were the\nclothes that the prisoners wore but because we were in Kanada, and we were not supposed to\nwear home anything that was still wearable that they could ship to the Reich they \u2014 we were\nsupposed to wear these long prison uniforms. And I was very \u2014 I was getting thin. I had been\nsick and the dresses were very long. The mud in Auschwitz was just \u2014 it was clay and it\nstuck to the dresses, to the hem of the dresses, and when it dried it was very heavy and very\ndifficult to remove. And it dragged us down. Of course, we didn't have much strength to drag\nourselves around let alone a muddy dress, so most prisoners found some pieces of string, tied\nit together and pulled up their dresses and we were allowed to do this. I found a belt. The\nGreek girls who came to Auschwitz had brought in a lot of knitted dresses with beautiful\nrose designs knitted into the hem and into the top and when I saw the belt it had, it was blue\nfelt. It had yellow and red felt flowers sewn on. I thought that it was a Greek handiwork, and\nof course being Greek you know, having been so fond of the Greek girls, I was felt very\nsentimental about the belt. But later on when I showed it to someone, it turned out that the\nbelt was not Greek. But whatever it was, I had the belt. And I used it to pull my dress up. Of\ncourse we weren't allowed to wear anything that would be an adornment, so because I\nbloused the belt over the \u2014 bloused my dress over the belt, I was able to wear the belt and no\none saw it. And my mother kept saying, \u201cOh Ruth, you know, look at how thin you're\ngetting, my poor child. Look, this starvation is terrible for you.\u201d And so I kept telling her,\n\u201cBut no, the belt isn't getting, isn't \u2014 I'm not getting thinner. The belt is getting longer. The\nbelt is stretching.\u201d That's how I tried to appease her. And there was a button at one time on\nthat belt and the button came off and then I ended up just using a safety pin that I found, a\nrusty old safety pin. And the belt went with me even later on when we worked in \u2014 were in a\nlabor camp. We were taken to a forced labor camp, and I did have another different kind of\nskirt and I was able to use the belt just as an adornment, but no one paid any attention. This\nwas towards the end of the war, and no one paid any attention to that anymore. And so I had\nthe belt with me all the time. And of course once I was in freedom, I wouldn't part with it.\nAnd I was very happy that the Holocaust Museum could make use of it now because I felt\nthat if anyone would go through my belongings and see this raggedy, dirty old faded belt\nthey would say, \u201cWhat is this woman saving this for?\u201d And this way there is a whole story\nattached to it and I'm very happy that I can relate this story of the belt.",
        "A: Yes, my, my mother \u2014 when we were in Auschwitz. For a short time there was a \u2014 two\nsisters were brought in and I think they were from the area of Katowice and their names\nwere Tesha and Nusha Unger(ph). That was their maiden name. One of the ladies, as I\nunderstand the story \u2014 but I'm not sure about, of course, a hundred percent sure. Nothing is a\nhundred percent sure of what happened. One of the ladies supposedly had given poison to\nher children. There was not enough for her. And I'm not sure now, if this is the story that I\nreally \u2014 it was told to me in this kind of secret, or if this was really true. She wanted to\ncommit suicide at the first chance. She was very despondent and one time my mother saw\nher running out into, into \u2014 towards the moat that was out by the fence. And of course there\nwere the soldiers on top shooting, and as soon as you crossed this little ditch you would be\nshot but they \u2014 when they saw some one running towards the place, they started shooting\nimmediately too. So my mother ran after her and I mean among all the bullets and amidst all\nthe bullets she was able to pull the woman back. She came to visit us after the war. She and\nher sister came to visit us after the war. Somehow I've lost touch with them. I'm not sure if\nthe story was that I was told was in the sequence and I hope it doesn't bring out a whole lot\nof pain to her. We never mentioned it to her. But this is what I think my moth\u2014 this is what\nmy mother told me had happened. And my mother had saved her life. And of course there\nwere many things that we witnessed that I'm not sure if anyone else has talked about it. At\none time there was a young man working in a camp, supervised by a group of Nazi officers.\nAnd inadvertently \u2014 they were shoveling the mud there \u2014 he started whistling the\nInternationale,'~ which is the Communist \u2014 yes, the Communist song and the anthem. And as\nof course, the Nazis were very much opposed to Communism \u2014 that's how they came to\npower \u2014 this was of course the ultimate in anything they would hate. And immediately on the\nspot he shot this young man. My mother was telling me this. She was really upset her and\nageravated over this when she told me, was very agitated, that she had seen this happen. So\nthose were the things that I remember from Auschwitz.\nOf course there are many, many more tales and one time I was working somewhere and my\nbrother was still with us at the time, and my mother and my brother were being taken to a\nSelektion, and my brother was a child. Of course he was four years younger than me, about\nnine years old. He was taken \u2014 the Nazi officer told them to go to, to the side. That meant\nwhere they were being \u2014 that this group is being sent to the concentration camp, to the \u2014 I'm\nsorry \u2014 to the gas chambers. And my mother and my brother suddenly were taken by a\nGerman soldier, pulled away and hidden behind a pile of coal in a different barracks. And\nwhen my mother asked him why he had done this, he said while he was in Poland, there he\nhad witnessed a shooting of \u2014 actually mass shooting of people from a certain city \u2014 village.\nThey were taken to a, they were taken to a pit and everyone was shot and then thrown into\nthe pit. And sometimes they weren't even shot, they were still alive when they were shot into\n* Tnternational (German): Communist anthem.\nthe pit. And one of the Nazi officers had said to this woman who was walking up towards the\npit with two children, one 1n each hand, that she can live if she picks one of the children to be\nsent into the \u2014 to be shot and fall into the pit. And then she and the other child could live.\nAnd the woman of course saw no hope so she firmly grabbed both children and jumped into\nthe pit. And this German soldier was so touched by what she had done that he swore to\nhimself at the time that if he ever could save a mother and a child, he would make it his\nmission to do so. And he did that by saving my mother and my brother and hiding them for\nthe day behind a pile of coal. I never knew who the man was, and my mother didn't know\nhim either. It was just a very strange and human gesture in a sea, or in a surrounding, of\ninhumanity. And it was a very touching thing that something like that could happen, even\nthe\u2014there. And of course it was very, very unusual.\nWhen we first came to Auschwitz, my mother needed \u2014 had some medication at home. And\nthere was a German doctor, Doctor Wolpe(ph) and an SS man standing there, and I went up\nto him and very naively telling him that my mother needed this medication. And he just\nlaughed at me and walked away and it was \u2014 he was \u2014 there was this irony in his laughter. Of\ncourse why was I bothering him with nonsense medication for my mother when she wouldn't\nbe alive probably within a few weeks. So there was very little that was human \u2014 humane in\nthe in anything that happened to us. Of course I still picture the Dr. Mengele\u2019\u201d \u2014 the so-\ncalled Dr. Mengele \u2014 who stood at the Selektion and humming Mozart. Sometimes when I \u2014\nand I am very fond of Mozart \u2014 but sometimes when I happen to sing Mozart I catch myself.\nI think. \u201cLook, you're doing the same thing that Mengele did.\u201d But no, he was doing the\nsame thing I am doing. He was using some kind of humanity that he had learned and he\nwas.... When I introduced this once to some people where I speak on the Holocaust, and she\nwas shocked that he was able to sing Mozart. And she said she wondering how much of\nMengele is in every one, in every person. I don't believe that that 1s necessarily so. I don't\nknow. I don't want to philosophize. I don't know if \u2014 how these people were bred or\nconditioned to do this sort of thing. But how can one \u2014 especially some one who might have\nknown the history of \u2014 that the biography of Mozart was such an equal and you know and\nsuch a person who would really wanted to see it equality for all people \u2014 abuse the music. Or\nmaybe he wasn't even thinking or there was this veneer of culture that happened and \u2014 to\nthem and yet was not used properly. It's \u2014 sometimes I think back and I wonder, \u201cDid this\nreally happen to us? Could really some one have done what really happened to other human\nbeings?\u201d They tell the story that Himmler'* once came to the camp, long before I got there,\nand when he saw what went on, he went from somewhere and he vomited. But from \u2014\nmaybe from the odor, or from whatever went on. But that did not stop him. And of course\nthe killing went on and he was of course was the most notorious of all the killers. I'm going\nthrough \u2014 with now more than 40 years \u2014 I'm going through this in my mind over and over\nand I'm trying to figure out why \u2014 how inhumanity.... And yet, inhumanity like this does go\n> Josef Mengele\n* Heinrich Himmler\non. It started with 6,000,000. It made it possible for the world to accept large number of\nkillings. Large numbers are being killed today. And when large number of people are being\nkilled, we talk about it. We cry about it. We forget about it. And I'm trying to do my thing to\ntry to keep in mind how easy it 1s to fall into a police state, to become a police state and to\nfall into this pattern of uncontrolled hatred and destruction.",
        "A: Well, I've told you many stories. What is it in particular that you had in mind?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh sure. The salami they gave us something like this \u2014 probably about an inch or a\nlittle bit less than an inch slice, slab of salami or liverwurst once, or twice, or three times a\nweek in addition to the little pieces of bread that we got daily and the tea that came out, out\nof the rusty barrels and this \u201cwonderful\u201d turnip soup. And we, one time \u2014 the salami had a\nterrible odor. They said it was made of horsemeat. It had some kind of a flavor of urine. And\none time in the evening I was just given a piece of this salami and I looked out at the window\nand I saw the crematorium going at full force and, or course, was at night, you could see the\nfire. During the daytime you could only see the smoke coming out but at night you could see\nthe flames. Well, you know, some flames, but the sky was fairly red. And I was thinking of\nthe people that were destroyed there and I was thinking, \u201cOh my God, I hope the salami\ndoesn't contain human flesh.\u201d And I threw up from it and after that \u2014 this was towards the\nend that I was in Auschwitz \u2014 and after that I was never able to even catch a piece of the\nsalami and whenever it was given to me, I traded it. Now some people would \u2014 who didn't\nhave the same experiences, I did of course \u2014 didn't know and were anxious to trade it for this\nlittle piece of bread that I could get. But I could never eat a piece of salami like that again\nand that was one of the more \u2014 well I think there were a lot of things that went on and if I go\nthrough it in my mind, more and more will come out. Of course because I did have typhus, I\ndid forget a lot of the incidents. And maybe in my own mind I try to push them aside. I was\nnever able to watch many of the programs. Even when the Eichmann\u201d trial \u2014 other people\nwere able to watch on television and I just couldn't face up to it. I it's only recently I have\nwritten on the Holocaust and have spoken about it at colleges on it, that I am able to do this. I\nstill cannot get any kind, watch any kind of movie on the Holocaust. I sometimes think, \u201cOh\nI'm brave. I'm going to do this now.\u201d And two minutes into the program, and it goes off. And\nI don't even go to any war pictures of any kind of war. I think maybe one of the reasons I am\nso anxious to talk about it is that I think that this kind of cruelty can be prevented and can be\nstopped before it gets out of hand ever. Maybe that's my small contribution I can make to\nthis.\n'\u00b0 Adolf Eichmann",
        "A: Oh gosh, the shoes. Everyone was given shoes in regulation, these clogs. They were\njust, you know, wooden soles and little canvas strips to hold, to put the feet in. The earth in\nAuschwitz was very muddy. It had been I understand no man's land between the wars and\nthere were fish hatcheries and it was very wet and humid. And we were given those shoes\nand then when it rained the shoes were stuck in the mud and we had to force our feet to get\nout. Of course we had no strength to pull ourselves out, and those shoes were in there and\nyou know when you are walking in it, if the shoes were stuck and you tried to pick them up\nand you weren't fast enough, you got a beating. The SS made us walk to the back with this\nand when the weather was dry the \u2014 it wasn't the \u2014 1t was very difficult to walk in those ruts\ntoo, because the earth had dried so uneven. So these shoes were really the least desirable of\nwhat you can get and when we were able to find an old pair of shoes we tried to exchange\nand to adapt it as best we could to our own use. So I think it must have been in Kanada that I\nfound a pair of shoes and it was something that was fashionable at the turn of the century. It\nhad long points and they were boots that you buckled up and they were very elegant. The\nelegant ladies wore it at the turn of the century. And but they were much too small for me\nand this was one of the things that would not be sent to Germany because no one would be\nable to wear those shoes and they had been out of style. But they were also very, very\nuncomfortable and they were very small. They were much too small for me. And so I wore\nthem with my foot in the leather side, the heel of my foot coming out on the leather side,\nrather than fitting over the heel, so that the heel stuck out on the side and I was walking on\nthe, the leather. This was of course preferable to the clogs, those, those wooden clogs but not\nmuch preferable. It killed my feet and one of the first things that I did after the war \u2014 I mean\nwhen we were walking, we were walking from Malchow for eight days, and finally\nsomewhere in German farmhouse I found a pair of shoes \u2014 and this was the first thing that I\nthrew away. Of course I'm sorry now that I didn't save the shoes, but I hated them so much. I\nmean they really did terrible things to my feet, but they would have been a very poignant\nmemento for the Museum. But unfortunately I don't have them. But they were terrible boots.",
        "A: Well, we were told, and it turned out to be true, that the German war machines were\nsuffering because there wasn't enough labor and they needed some laborers. And one time\nwe were told that within a day or so we would be leaving Auschwitz and to prepare\nwhatever. The things we had were nothing \u2014 maybe a kerchief where we could carry our\nbread in. And on November 1, 1944, we were loaded on to a train, the same train that\nbrought people into the camp, and on one side was the crematorium and on the other side\nwas so-called freedom, the western part of Germany. And we were sitting on this train for a\nwhile and we didn't know which way it was going. We were hoping that it was true that we\nwere really being taken to Germany to for labor, but it could have been just the other way.\nWe could have gone up to the crematorium after we'd been going. Well, finally the train\nmoved out and we were indeed taken to Germany and we stayed in Ravensbriick. We were\ntaken to Ravensbriick because all this is in northern Germany, very close to the North Sea.\nWe were taken there and we were kept in a very large tent, something like a circus tent, for\nseveral days without food and water. It was the, without the water, I mean we were sort of\nused to starvation, but without water which is something awful. It rained and we had these\nspoons, and we were trying to put our spoon outside the tent to try and collect a few drops of\nwater. But of course we didn't have the patience to wait for the spoon to fill up, so as soon as\nwe had a few drops of water, we would anxiously drink it. But a few days later we were\ntaken to an actually barracks in Malchow and then \u2014 I'm sorry, in Ravensbrick \u2014 and then\ntaken again, shipped by train to this small town called Malchow. It was in northern\nGermany, somewhere near the North Sea, somewhere near the Oder \u2014 the Elbe? Where the\nGerman soldiers finally surrendered and where the four armies of the Allies eventually met.\nBut\u2014\n[TECHNICAL CONVERSATION]\nTAPE #2\n[TECHNICAL CONVERSATION]",
        "A: Yes, this is Christmas Day, 1943. In Germany \u2014 Germany celebrates two days of Christmas\nThis is the last day of Christmas and so it had to be December 25th in 1943. It's very much in\nmy memory, one of the few things that I really remember very, very clearly. In the summer\nbefore, a woman had, a Jewish woman had been brought into Auschwitz. She had been a\nyoung married woman, and what wasn't obvious at the time was that she was pregnant. And\nwhen she \u2014 as she went along of course, she was losing weight because she was getting\nemaciated. And these prison clothes, these ill-fitting clothes whatever it was, was hiding her\ncondition. And when we went out to roll call, we were five deep. So the prisoners sort of\nalways put her in between where it couldn't be noticed. I mean, it was like an unwritten order\nthat we had among ourselves that we just obeyed. At the same time there were also non-\nJewish laborers, and some of them were in our barracks. There was one particular woman I\nremember, Pani Wandzia(ph), a very tall aristocratic woman. And we \u2014 I was told that she\ncame from some very aristocratic family. She was allowed \u2014 the Polish prisoners somehow I\nthink were allowed to have two times a year packages mailed from home. She had one at\nChristmas time. And then there were these three Polish slave labor women who worked\noutside the camp, but stayed 1n the barracks. And I don't think they got any Christmas \u2014 there\nwas no one to send them any packages too. And so they worked outside the camp\nsomewhere and they were treated almost as badly as Jewish prisoners. The only exception\nwas \u2014 got the same food, got the same everything, except non-Jewish prisoners were never\ntaken to Selektion. If they died, they died, but nothing was done really to help them, nothing\nwas done by the German authorities. But that was the only difference. Of course it made a\nlarge difference but they were treated the same. And so they worked somewhere. Now came\nChristmas time. Somehow they managed to pluck from somewhere this tiny little branch of a\npine tree, probably about this tall, and they made a base out of chewed bread and stuck this\nChristmas tree in. And it so happened that this woman who was pregnant, went into labor\nthat night, and had a little boy. Now the next morning there was no roll call and that that was\nthe only free time that I remember while I was in Auschwitz, when there was no Zahlappell\nin the morning or in the evening, one, one day. And I think it was only because the SS were\nout late reveling at night and they didn't expect to get up very early, so they figured well they\nweren't going to do it that one day. And the next morning my mother and I walked outside\nand the camp was in some strange quiet. There was an awe about it. It seemed almost like\npink cotton was enveloping the whole camp \u2014 strange light. And between a little Jewish boy\nbeing born the night before, and being Christmas time and this strange light in the \u2014 around\nus, these Polish women kept saying that a miracle has happened. And this must be the\nmiracle when we would be freed. And this would be the day. And when you're so desperate\n\u2014 even though I am Jewish and didn't think that could happen to me, I wasn't brought up to\nbelieve in it \u2014 we somehow decided to believe, \u201cWell, maybe you hang on to this. Maybe\nthere is some truth to the story.\u201d And this went on almost all day. Now \u2014 and everyone was\nbeginning to be a little bit, to talk, to begin to talk about it. I mean we really didn't believe it.\nWe were too realistic and too many things had happened. Somehow we felt that maybe\nsomething could happen. Well, by five o'clock of course the spell was broken. Was around\nfive o'clock, towards evening, when this spell was broken. We heard the familiar sound of\nfour, three or four army trucks. People were on the trucks \u2014 open trucks, with prisoners being\ntaken to the gas chamber. And it was preceded by an German, the command car that the\ncouple of German officers rode in, and in back of it was the car with the Red Cross on it that,\nwhoever would observe it would think there's some kind of Red Cross, some kind of\ncharitable or humane\u2014humanitarian project going on. But of course that was the truck that\nheld the gas. And they, we of course recognized the noise of the approaching trucks. At that\npoint when the they drove between the men's camp and the women's camp which was\nseparated by high wires, electrically-charged wires, and they had to go around the bend and\nget to the crematorium, to the chimneys which we saw, and we didn't see the actual\ncompound from the camp but we saw the chimneys. Of course they were very tall. So they\napproached the crematorium and as they \u2014 the prisoners in the first truck came within the\nsight of the chimneys \u2014 they started singing the Hatikvah.'\u00b0 And then the second truck\nstarted in and then the third and fourth \u2014 if there was four. I am not a hundred percent sure\nhow many. And of course they were driven into the compound of the crematorium and as\nthey were driven in, the first voice stopped. The first truck stopped and then the second and\nthen the third, and we had the, the familiar noises of the steam going and the smell and the\nnoises of the gra\u2014grates of the of the ovens, and the next morning, this roll call again. And of\ncourse no miracle had happened.\nBut as we were standing roll call, there was \u2014 the body of the baby washed out into the into\nthe ditches that I don't know where it went because actually the Germans probably would\nhave seen that there was a baby, would have seen the body. I don't know where it ended, but\nmaybe they didn't even pay attention or maybe it went somewhere underground, and that\nwas the end of the miracle. And it took another two years or so before we were really\nliberated, and a year and a half before we were liberated. As a matter of fact bodies of babies\n\u2014 speaking of that, when we were 1n working in Kanada, there was a baby found, smothered\nin the blankets. It seems that either in the rush the baby was taken away from the mother and\npushed in with the blankets, or maybe the mother tried to save the baby by putting it in with\nthe belongings that she had, hoping that someone would pick up the baby, somewhat like\nMoses or so. But of course nothing happened. And the baby was found dead rolled in some\nof these blankets and things. So lives of children were very cheap and very expendable. It\nwas, it's a terrible thing. I think over 1,000.000 or so of the 6,000,000 that died were\nchildren. You don't know all the potential that was killed at the time with such.... And that\n'\u00ae Hope (Hebrew); Jewish national anthem.\nwas one of the things \u2014 another one of the things that went on in Auschwitz. And you know,\nwhen you speak about Auschwitz, everyone has the same story of lice and rats and filthy\nclothes and beatings. My mother \u2014 there was a time when a woman, Mala, '\u2019 the \u2014you might\nhave heard this famous \u2014 she was a page or like an errand run\u2014runner, between the Germans\n\u2014 between the Nazis and different groups of Nazis, and sometimes to the prisoners. She had\nsome friends and they managed to get Nazi clothes and they escaped from the camp. And a\nfew days later she was caught and brought back to camp, and she was hung. They had a\nmoat like, I don't know. A few days after afterwards, they had to drag her and one of the\nthings that everyone was saying was so amazing. According to the Geneva Conference, you\nare supposed to \u2014 that was the story I was told \u2014 according to the Geneva Agreement, you're\nsupposed to cure prisoners \u2014 a prisoner before you execute him. And this is \u2014 and we were\namazed that, of course, what did they pay attention to about Geneva conventions? They\ndragged this poor woman with broken legs to the to the gallows and hanged her there. And\naround the same time they had, they wanted to check up and make sure that we had all the \u2014\nthat anyone was there, that no one escaped. So they had extra roll call, this extra Zahlappell\nevery hour, every hour of the day. And of course when you were standing at Zahlappell \u2014 it\nhad to be like this \u2014 and you weren't allowed to move at all. This SS woman Drechsler came\nto take the Zahlappell, and my mother stood perfectly still but she followed her with her\neyes. She saw the eyes moving, so she pulled my mother out of the ranks and slapped her\nand my mother fell to the floor. Luckily she didn't shoot her right then and there. But my\nmother had an ear ailment, she damaged her ear. Until my mother died four years ago, this\nnever cleared up completely and it was from that time. But Mala's story has been written up.\nI know that. It is written in \u2014 I just recently read it again in a book Anus Mundi, by a Polish\nman.\u2019 He wrote about this extensively. And this was one of the other things that went on in\nAuschwitz. Every day was the same and for everyone, but not \u2014 and yet everyone has an\nindividual story of his individual tragedy, their individual story of hopeless and whatever\nhappened to them, so yes, it was all the same. We were all the same. We didn't even have a\nname. We had a number. We had our hair shaved, which was lucky because lice were by the\nbillions. But we also had individual things that we can remember and talk about.",
        "A: Well, there's probably so much and I don't know. When this happened with \u2014 in the\nChristmas.... After Christmas, my mother dreamt \u2014 now I don't know how much of her\nconscious went into this dream \u2014 that my father told her that now is the time to say\nKaddish.'\u201d And we have kept that day well as a memorial to my father, because it's the only\nday that we can really \u2014 that's tangible. It is as valid as any other day, so we are using that\nday as memorial to my father \u2014 my brother and I. Well, we were taken from Malchow \u2014 from\n'\u2019 Mala Zimetbaum\n'\u00ae Wieslaw Kielar\n\" Holy One (Aramaic); Jewish prayer said to honor the dead, especially close family members.\nRavensbriick to Malchow. Malchow was \u2014 had been, originally, a labor camp equipped to\nhave about 1,000 people. But by the time we came in there were several thousand in the\ncamp. But 1t was amazing to us. There were actual table and chairs, benches. There was a\nreal water fountain. And there were bunk beds, which was two to a bed instead of six, with\nactual blankets. And there were cupboards to put your clothes in, little somethings. And of\ncourse we didn't have anything to put in, but we \u2014 they were there and they were signs of\ncivilization, something that.... It's amazing that how much, we had lived among civilized\nthings with the equipment of civilization. I was \u2014 nice furniture and everything, and yet when\nwe saw these crude closets we were amazed that this was civilization. And that there was\nsomething other than Auschwitz out there. And so we lived with in the in the camp with this\nand we were taken to a labor camp, to a labor to a factory to work. This was a labor camp,\nthis became a \u2014 but it became a concentration camp really because the SS officers went.\nSome of them came from Auschwitz with us and some were picked up in different places\nand they were there. We were taken in the morning and marched for about several miles to\nsomething that looked like woods. They were woods, and where the trees were sparse they\nplanted artificial trees, and there were nets with leaves overhead to camouflage the, the\nthings that were going on there. Then there was a sand hill with some trees coming out of It,\nand on the side was a door. Once you walked into this door it was like a very modern\nlooking laboratory or some very clean factory. It was actually an ammunition factory, very\nwell camouflaged from attack from over-fly \u2014 overhead planes. And we were \u2014 actually the\nwhole camp was honey-combed underneath with all these different factories. One group I\nknow was making hand grenades. Our group was making bullets.\nAnd for being such a very modern factory and very cleverly designed factory, there was\nreally the equip\u2014 the way we made the bullets was very primitive. There was a board with\nlittle holes in it that I think there were 24 or whatever the number, tiny little small holes, and\nthere was a\u2014 we \u2014 there was a half a capsule of a bullet put in \u2014 that we put 1t in\u2014into each\none of the holes. Then we filled a certain amount of gunpowder into it, and then the other\nhalf of this board closed over it. Something like a waffle iron, on that idea, or a hamburger\npress. And the other half of the capsule of the bullet was pushed down and that made a bullet\nthat would be used I guess in a regular gun. At both ends of the table \u2014 these were long tables\nwe were sitting at and must have been about 20 or 30 prisoners on each table \u2014 and on each\nend was a SS woman making sure that we did the right thing. Well, it was very difficult but I\ntried to not line up the top with the bottom part of this board as much as I could without\nbeing detected because I really didn't want to be hit or killed or whatever. But I tried to sort\nof squeeze it in a crooked way so that it would close but not quite. And I was hoping that\nthese bullets would misfire and I was hoping that in this way it would be my part of the war\neffort against the Nazis. Well, we worked in this camp, and after the first of the year\nAuschwitz was \u2014 I think in the beginning of January, Auschwitz was emptied and they\nbrought a lot of prisoners from Auschwitz to Malchow, I guess, and different places. Most of\nthe prisoners who came to Auschwitz, who came from Auschwitz were the Gypsies. Of\ncourse you know, the Gypsies had been in a camp in Auschwitz and they were killed by\nfamilies, just the way the Jews were killed. Because, in this hierarchy of \u201csuperman\u2019\u2019 that the\nGermans established, the Gypsies were just about one rank higher than the Jews and, of\ncourse, they had to be eliminated because they were a \u201clower people.\u201d And so we saw the\nGypsies in the camp and they were first brought in the end of \u2014 the middle of 1944,\nsomething like that. They might have been there before but I became aware of them at that\ntime. And then they were brought to Malchow and they were very nice. They were happy-\ngo-lucky people. They sang. And maybe because they knew that the end of the Nazi era was\ncoming \u2014 we weren't aware of it as much but they had been walking from Auschwitz to\nMalchow which 1s I don't know how many miles, hundreds of miles \u2014 and they had seen\nwhat was going on. They had taken meat of the dead horses and they brought it to camp and\nthey barbecued it and they shared it with who ever came along. It was exceedingly nice. And\nI mean they \u2014 I really have very, very good memories of the Gypsy people. The only thing\nthat they did is that they were looking for wood to barbecue the meat. They took apart the\ntoilets, the doors, and there was no place where to go any more, so we had to squat just over\na hole rather than over this little bit of wooden frame that was made for toilet. But the\nGypsies were very nice when they were brought in the camp. And you know, I do speak\nabout I do speak on the Holocaust very often, schools, churches, colleges, and I do want to\nmention the Gypsies because until recently no one set up a memorial. No one did anything\nfor them and the poor Gypsies are \u2014 I mean so many died unnamed that something \u2014\nsomeone should remember that there were these people at one time and they were a kind and\ngentle people. Throughout the history of Europe they were really denounced and, and feared\nand everything and they were very, very nice and gentle and very helpful. But the \u2014 and they\nwere in a camp with us.\nWe were in a camp then when more and more people came in and eventually they could not\ntake us to the factories anymore, and we stayed in the camp. The roads became clogged with\neastern Europeans trying to get back to their homes, and Russian \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 German\nsoldiers trying to run away from the Russian armies going, west and refugees \u2014 German\nrefugees who lived in Poland and were afraid of what would then happen to them were\ntrying to make it to Germany. And most of the roads were clogged with this and you couldn't\nget \u2014 you couldn't go to work anymore. And of course everything was breaking down and\nwe \u2014 nothing was happening any more. So \u2014 but what happened when in the last few days\nbefore the war ended was they also didn't give us any food any more and there were food\nriots because we were actually starving. The warehouses were full of \u2014 well, they were not\nfull, but there was bread in the warehouses and the prisoners were \u2014 didn't get anything so\nwe rioted to get in. And my one \u2014 think a day or two, we were liberated \u2014 we were made to\nwalk out of the camp, march out of the camp on May 1, 1945. A day or two before there\nwere these food riots and some\u2014sometimes the Nazis from outside the camp \u2014 this German\nofficer would see the riots so they would shoot at the prisoners, sometimes. And once in a\nwhile someone was hurt from the shootings. Sometimes they shot in the air. But they\ncouldn't stop us. I mean we knew that things were already happening and we really lost more\nand more of our fear you know, to some degree anyway. And so we went \u2014 we were rioting\nand my mother was in the barracks and I was out and she was told that someone had been\nshot and of course she immediately imagined that 1t was me, but it wasn't. We stormed the\nfood barracks and that afternoon \u2014 that must have been the day before we were leaving \u2014 the\nfood that the Nazis were eating \u2014 these Nazi officers in their mess hall \u2014 was left on the table,\nuntouched like some of the fairy tales. You know, the stuff is sitting there and the people are\ngone. And we were starved, but we ignored it and we were looking for the chamber where\nthey would keep all the food. So, we came to the storage place, and there was something that\nlooked like noodles to me. Now, you have to realize I haven't had \u2014 I didn't have anything\ndecent to eat you know in these years and noodles, my God. I took the noodles hoping that\nwe would be able to at some point cook them and eat them, but I didn't know how, what to\ndo, how to carry these. Well, we already had been given regulation underwear, gray flannel.\nIt was tied with a string and that was it, but among the things that I wasn't supposed to wear\nwas somewhere that I had found a pair of pink silk underwear. So I had that underneath the\ngray flannel. So I took off the gray flannels, pulled out the string, tied 1t on the bottom and\nmade a bag and put these noodles in.\nWe then were told to line up to leave the camp. At that point the Swedish Red Cross had sent\npackages for the prisoners. And the first few prisoners, each one got a package, and then it\nwas two to a package and because they were running out of packages. Then it was five to a\npackage. And then by the time it came to us it was five to a package, which was a lucky\nthing because these packages contained cocoa and sardines and butter and our stomachs\nwere not used to this. My mother became deadly ill from just eating something oily. I think\nsardines. You know, we fell over it and actually she ended up in a hospital \u2014 in a British\narmy hospital, for a few days because she was so sick. The right thing to \u2014 would have been\nprobably to have some cereal a few times a day cooked in water and gradually bring our\nstomachs back to normal. But that of course didn't happen. So we were given these packages\nand gradually everyone along the way had diarrhea and we were marched out of the camp\nand the SS went with us. A few disappeared as we were marched along. At one time we\nwere taken over a make-shift bridge. The bridge had been destroyed but we had to get over a\nsmall part of the river, and they took, there was a tavern on the hill below \u2014 above the bridge,\nand the bridge was below and the river was all the way down. So they took tables and tied\nthe legs together and made a bridge, and we could only go over like two or three people at a\ntime. Was a beautiful sunset I remember and we were walking over this. And then we got to\nanother part and I'm carrying this bag of noodles, what I thought was noodles, with me right\nalong. And then on the way wherever we went, we managed to find \u2014 it was I guess harvest\ntime or whatever, we found potatoes in the ground, and we managed to make a bonfire and\nbake the potatoes. They were most of the time just charred on the top and the inside was raw.\nThey tasted horrible but we managed to at least eat that. And I carried this bag with noodles\nwith me, waiting for an opportunity to cook it. Gradually the SS did disappear and\nsometimes they put on clothes to make them look like they were part of us. We knew who\nthey were, and of course they did have a tattoo under their arm to identify them as SS people.\nBut of course we didn't see that and they thought well maybe no one would know about it\nand they would get away, you know, by just mixing with the population and pretending that\nthey had \u2014 were nice people.\nSo at one time we were brought into what had been a sugar factory, was completely empty. I\nguess there was no more sugar available. And an SS woman saw me pass by and she called\nme into a small office and she was cleaning her guns there. And she said to me, \u201cI guess\nyou'll be free soon.\u201d And I was afraid to say, \u201cOh, how wonderful! Of course. I'm glad my\ntime 1s finally coming.\u201d So, I was saying. \u201cOh well, maybe it won't be so fast yet.\u201d I was\ntrying to tell her something, and I think it might have saved my life, knowing full well that,\nof course, liberation was just a few days away. But I was afraid to antagonize her yet, and\nthat was actually my last encounter with them. They really sort of disappeared and when\nthey finally \u2014 when we finally did see them again, they were checked for this tattoo under\ntheir arm pits, by \u2014 I think the British part of the army that we saw. Well, anyway coming\nback to my noodles and these horrible potatoes that we were broiling \u2014 baking on the way.\nFinally, my mother found a rusty can of some sort and we went up \u2014 we were right along the\nocean, the North Sea, and my mother went and got some water. And she went to see that we\nfinally would cook these potatoes, these noodles, I'm sorry. Well the thing grew and grew\nand grew, and what I had dragged from Malchow were dehydrated potatoes when all we had\nwas potatoes and I had dragged this out. It was one of my real disappointments of \u2014 you\nknow, of having this. But it was part of the life that went on in that was part of, of Auschwitz\n\u2014a part of my experiences. When of course when my mother and I walked on, we were near\nthe Elbe and we \u2014 the first thing we know, we saw was this tank with different insignias on\nit. It was an American army tank saluting us and we went one way and they went the other\nway. And then it \u2014 within a few hours, occupation forces changed, because all the different\nforces were meeting at in that spot \u2014 so at one time the French and British and Russians. And\nwe ended up in a British, in a British zone in \u2014 at the time in a zone \u2014 I don't know what it\nfinally became. And we were there in a like a tent city which was during the summer, which\nwas alright. We were in one section of the camp and on the other side there was another tent\ncamp where there were Italian soldiers. It seems that when Mussolini was hanged he was \u2014\nthe soldiers in the Italian army had a choice of either joining the German army or becoming\nprisoners of war. These soldiers that were on the other side of the camp had been the\nprisoners of war, and they were now being repatriated to Italy. The only thing was I mean the\ntransportation was destroyed and communications were hardly working. So the they were\nsitting in this camp waiting for things to normalize so they were in one camp and we were in\nthis camp. Then when it was \u2014 when summer was coming to an end, the British army had to\nsee \u2014 you know, they couldn't keep us out in the winter. And they made some kind of travel\narrangements for us in trucks and on cart, rail, whatever was available to get back to\nFrankfurt. They asked us where we wanted to go.\nNow we had agreed with my father and everyone \u2014 you know, my brother and my mother \u2014\nthat whoever would live would try to make his way back to Frankfurt and so we could be\nunited as a family and then see where we would go from there. So we arrived in Frankfurt,\nsometime in the Fall. We came back, and the city was practically destroyed. Almost\neverything was gone. Even my mother who had no great love for anything German that had\nhappened, after what had happened to us, really was like shocked when she saw this, saw\nthis horrible destruction. And we stayed overnight in this hotel near the near the railroad\nstation where all kinds of people met. And everybody exchanged experiences and there was\nno place else to go. At one point in that evening an American soldier came 1n and he had\nlooked at the lists that the UNRRA\u201d and the HIAS\u201d' had printed of survivors and \u2014 as much\ninformation as they could, the origin and birthplace of the people. So, he had seen that we\nwere from Frankfurt and he was looking for a family in Frankfurt. He had left before the war\nand been in the American Army and was now looking for relatives, hoping that someone\ncould tell them what had happened to him \u2014 to them. And in the conversation \u2014 we didn't\nknow anything about his relatives \u2014 but in the conversation, he mentioned that while he was\ndoing the same thing in \u2014 while he was in Italy he had read about a young boy who was also\nfrom Frankfurt. So he went to ask him about his relatives. And the young boy fit the\ndescription of my brother. So we said, \"How do I write to him? How do I \u2014 can I get in touch\nwith him?\" So he, he gave us an Army post number, and we wrote to them. And somehow,\nthe letter did get to my brother and he was in Baury(ph) at the time. He had been liberated\nnear the Austrian border. He had remained in Auschwitz until the end. And in January of\n1945, they emptied Auschwitz. They were burning all the bodies and all the evidence that\nwas around, as much as they could, of course. By then they were scared stiff for their own\nlives. They thought that everything that happened, that they had done to other people, would\nhappen to them. And they should have been scared. My brother was telling me that he\nlooked out at the crematorium, and he knew that they were packing up people to go, to go on\nthis big march. And they were.... He was looking out, and an SS man approached him and\nsaid, \"Hah! You can go there, too.\u201d Or, \u201cYou're going to be sent there, too.\" And my brother\nsaid, \"You know, I don't care anymore what happens to me. So much has happened to me. I\ndon't care what you do to me.\" He said, \"Because you said that, go out and join the march.\"\nSo he went. And he walked until he was, somewhere, liberated near Austria. And he was\ntaken \u2014 he met up with the British contingent of \u2014 actually, the Israeli contingent of the\nBritish Army. They had an army, and they were anxious to get my brother into Israel and\nPalestine at the time. Because he was a minor, and he was only one of \u2014 you know, minors\nwere \u2014 the British allowed in. And they felt, well, in a few more years he'll be old enough to\ngo into the Israeli Army. And they knew there would be, there would be a war, and there\nwould \u2014 he would be needed. And this indeed what happened. But we wrote to him, and he\nwas already embarking to \u2014 by the time the mail got to him, he was already going to Israel.\nAnd eventually \u2014 he had been hurt in Auschwitz. He didn't tell us that he had a problem with\nhis arm. And they did surgery on his arm. And because he could not lift his arm for any \u2014 he\nhad a very serious infection, he couldn't lift his arm past just his shoulder height \u2014 the Israeli\narmy then discharged him. And so he was able to leave Israel very young, and he came to the\n*\u00b0 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\n*! United Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society.\nUnited States. But we\u2019re always up and back with Israel. And that was \u2014 we stayed around in\nFrankfurt, hoping \u2014 even though we knew better \u2014 that my father somehow could have made\nhis way back. I wrote to Czechoslovakia, to his birthplace, thinking that maybe somehow he\nwould have ended up there. Maybe he was sick. Maybe he was somewhere in a hospital.\nBut, of course, all this hope disappeared soon and on the last day that our visa to come to the\nUnited States was still good, was when we finally embarked and, and gave up all hope that\nmy father was alive. But I still didn't give up hope. Even when I came here I kept thinking,\n\u201cOh well, maybe somewhere, somehow I will hear that he is someplace else.\u201d But of course,\nno.",
        "A: This was in Frankfurt. When I sometimes think that the war against the Jews didn't just start\nin 1933. It started much earlier \u2014 ended up in 1933. One of my first memories was probably\nbefore the Hitler election in 1932 or so. We \u2014 I lived, we lived in an apartment, the second\nfloor \u2014 third floor, and the, there was a, a propaganda banner for the Socialist \u2014 National\nSocialist, Nazis \u2014 strung between \u2014 across the streets down between the two apartment\nhouses. And there was a lot of agitation in the air. I mean a lot of agra\u2014 they were really\ntrying to get to the Jewish people, and to, to convince the non-Jews that they should vote for\nthe Nazis because Jews were their enemy \u2014 and also against Communists, against anything\nthat they wanted to be against. And so this banner was across \u2014 was strung across and I\nlooked down. My parents had gone out, left me in the house and I had \u2014 I saw the banner and\nI looked down. And but you know when you're three years old you don't have depth\nperception, and I don't think \u2014 and to me it seemed like it was a barrier and my parents would\nnever come back. And from that time on I did \u2014 I think I've told you this \u2014 and from that time\non I knew that, you know, everything was topsy-turvy. We \u2014 this \u2014 I think I have very many\nbad memories of people being killed, of relatives being taken away. My Aunt Selma\nvolunteered. Her, her fianc\u00e9 was \u2014 my Aunt Selma could have stayed behind. Her fianc\u00e9 was\ntaken to the \u2014 to be selected to go to Poland, ostensibly, \u201cresettlement in the east\u201d as 1t was\ncalled. And she just volunteered to go with him, and we never heard of or saw her again.\nAnd that was, that was life in Germany and Europe.",
        "A: Oh, very simple. I mean there were organizations that helped. The HIAS, the UNRRA had\ntheir own groups. And we were told that we \u2014 was some form of Jewish organization. Of\ncourse there was a very large displaced persons camp in Zeilsheim which was out on the\noutskirts of Hochst, which 1s on the outskirts of Frankfurt. And you \u2014 you know, you listened\nto everything through the grapevine and we were told we should sign up \u2014 go to the\nAmerican Embassy or Consulate and get our papers. And we did that. And then, of course,\nwe waited, because of my \u2014 because we thought of my father and we waited until the last\nday to get to, to embark. But that is what we did. And of course in the United States, we\nwere met by ladies from the HIAS and the UNRRA. And HIAS were actually in the \u2014 and\nwe were put for a few nights into a hotel on off-Broadway. I think it was on 103rd Street and\noff-Broadway, or something like that. And then my mother took a job in Clifton, New Jersey\nand we stayed there.",
        "A: Yes. Iam not happy to talk about it. It seems that we were not treated as having had the\nexperiences that we did. We were not treated as equal human beings, somehow. We were\ntold to take work as laborers, as domestics and this sort of thing. And even though now my\nhusband had been an American soldier \u2014 and to him I was someone who had survived a\ncamp and had been brave enough and human enough to survive and be treated as a human\nbeing \u2014 his mother didn't go along with this. To her everything that was European \u2014 and she\nwas born in Eastern Europe \u2014 everything that was European was lowly and despised \u2014\ndespic\u2014despicable, and shouldn't be.... She wanted to stay away from this and she didn't\nwant to have anything to do with it and so this was wasn't good enough for her son. And I\ndid have a lot of problems with her, and I found, in general, that a lot of people had this sort\nof reaction. I was active in the Memorial Committee \u2014the Holocaust Memorial which is\nusually sometimes in April \u2014 and the people \u2014 the men who had worked on this before I\nbecame active in it, told me that they had a lot of resistance to making a memorial service\nand to even speaking about this. And they had difficulty getting a stage to do the memorial\nservice and it has only become fashionable to \u2014 I don't know, in the last 20 or so years \u2014 to\nspeak about it, and to not consider it a badge of shame which \u2014 of course, which it wasn't.\nBut I think we as surviv\u2014 as prisoners of the Nazis were told that we were\n\u201cUntermenschen, ~\u201d sub\u2014sub-humans. That we were not up to par. And I think it was so\ndrilled into us that we kept actually believing that it still was true. And what we really should\nhave had, was a lot of counseling. But, of course, organizations were more \u2014 they found the\nimmediate need for clothing us, and feeding us, and finding shelter that that was really\nsecondary.\nIt would have been just as important as any of the other things, because a lot of people\nfloundered, have terrible traumatic lives since then because of that. And this 1s one of the \u2014 I\nthink \u2014 things that have been learned that now most people do get counseling after hostage\nsituations or after prison situations. And immediately they do get counseling and it's very,\n** Sub-humans (German); term used to refer to people deemed inferior according to Nazi racial\ntheory.\nvery important. It's one of the things that can't be stressed enough. So life was very, very\ndifficult for people arriving from home, without a family, with their whole background\ndestroyed, without any means of support. And those who did not want to be a burden to \u2014\nand consider whatever the HIAS is doing \u2014 I mean, I considered it as charity; and I wanted to\nget away from it as quick as possible. But to the people who did that, they really had to\nstruggle from the bottom up.",
        "A: Well I was moping around and my mother was working and I did a lot of reading and all I\nwanted to do was read and I was very anxious to improve my English. I did a lot of reading,\nand my mother didn't like the idea of my being home by myself all the time. So she told\nsome young woman that she knew that she should take me out with her when\u2014whenever.\nAnd there was a dance in the Y, and she \u2014 we went up there. She somehow disappeared. I\nwas left up there. And my husband asked me to dance, but I didn't really \u2014 I wasn't really\nthinking of dating and I really didn't want to go out. So, \u201cWell, I'll just dance for the evening,\nand then I went home.\u201d And he wanted to walk with me, and I didn't let him. And then there\nwas the city hall \u2014 this was in Paterson and the city hall was in the middle of the street. And I\nwas walking along one street; he was walking along another street, trying to catch up with\nme. And he met me at the bus stop. And after that, he started dating me. That\u2019s what\nhappened.",
        "A: Well, I'm sure there are a lot of things. And it's like taking an exam \u2014 when you, you know,\nlater on you walk out of there. That's what always happened to me. I did work my way\nthrough college, and I did work my way through grad school. And I have a degree in a\nBachelor's Degree in History, and a Master's Degree in Literature. And I know when I\nwalked out of and into the parking lot, I remembered all the correct answers. So \u2014 and I'm\nsure that I'll say \u2014 as soon as I walk away from here, I'll think, \"Oh, I should have mentioned\nthis. And I should have mentioned that.\" So maybe I'll have a chance to talk to you again,\nand you can put it on tape. And if there's anything you want to ask me, of course, I'll be glad\nto tell you.",
        "A: Good.",
        "A: Glad I can do something that will keep this in front of the public, so that eventually people\nwill know that it really happened. Perhaps it can be a warning to the people, to the world.\nWe're trying in our little way, I think all of us, all the survivors, are trying in a little way to\nsay, \u201cThis is what happened. Beware, don't fall into this sort of inhumanity.\"\n[Conclusion of Interview]\n"
