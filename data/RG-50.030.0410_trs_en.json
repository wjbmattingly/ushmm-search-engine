        "Q: Good morning.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: It\u2019s lovely to see you here this morning.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m delighted that you came and made this long trip. [Laughs]",
        "Q: Can you start out by just giving me the name that you were born with and the name that\nyou live with now, please?",
        "A: Okay, my real, official, legal name is Regina born Laks. I also went by the name of Renia\nthroughout my life, so actually I\u2019m still being called Renia, but if you want to find the\nlegal me, you will find it always under Regina, whether it\u2019s school or professional life or\nhowever or legal or - everything is Regina. My present name is Gelb; I\u2019m married to\nVictor Gelb, so I basically never use my, my maiden name, which some people did\nretain. I did not, so my name is really now Regina Gelb.",
        "Q: And when were you born and where?",
        "A: I was born December 16\", 1929 in a place called Wierzbnik, which you could not find\nanymore on the map now because it has been joint to another town called Starachowice\nand renamed. It was basically incorporated. And if I know history of the town, the\nincorporation - the towns were joined in 1931, -9, just before the war, so that first these\ntowns were adjacent basically, one was sort of a factory town and the other was the\nbedroom town. Wierzbnik was the bedroom town and the Jewish community really\nresided in Wierzbnik rather than Starachowice. And I was born in Wierzbnik and, as I\nsaid before, if you want to find it on the map, you will not. You will only have to look for\nthe name Starachowice, so that\u2019s where it is and it is central Poland, south of Warsaw\nabout two hours by car.\n[Phone interruption. |",
        "Q: I want you to do me a favor for a second.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I want you to close your eyes for a minute and think about what comes to your - then you\ncan open them again - what comes to mind when you first think about your childhood?\nWhat\u2019s the picture that you get in your head about your childhood?",
        "A: Could I open my eyes now?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well, basically a very carefree life, because I was a young child, and the second 1s that I\nwas sort of privileged, more than my sisters were privileged by virtue of being the\nyoungest. I was sort of the baby in the family. As you know, the third one in line\nsometimes gets mistreated by the older ones, not that I was, but I certainly was spoiled by\nmy parents because I was what you call the baby in the family, and anything around the\nidea of being privileged 1s not, does not include being spoiled; it\u2019s just being singled out\nfor being special, it\u2019s more or less. I was forever being told I was smart and I was this and\nthat and it actually served me very well in later years during the hard times because I\nalways had the idea that I really could do certain things because I was always told, \u201cWell\nyou\u2019re was smart and you do well in school.\u201d And you... So that later on I could rely on\nthis idea that was lodged in my head, which, well, today, I think they have all the\neuphemisms- self-whatever it\u2019s called today, self-appreciation, or whatever, the fact\nremains that because I was a) singled out by my parents for being a very good child and\nsmart child and for being given this, this, impetus to build on that, I think I more or less\nrelied on it in later years, I mean, you know, during the hard times, saying, well, I\nprobably could do it because I was told that I really could do it, so let me just do it. And\nthat\u2019s probably the single most important aspect of my memory of what I brought out of\nthat, of my childhood, out of my childhood.",
        "Q: Do you think that was true for your two older sisters, Chris and Hania?",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t tell you for sure for the reason that, you know,\nHania was always the, what you call the brilliant one in the family and she was out of\ntown, in a special high school for the gifted and whatever, and Krysia was the gorgeous,\nthe gorgeous, the beauty of the family, you know, and I had no assets, you know, I had no\nsuch things to prove. So this is another aspect of it, you know, that Hania was always\nspoken of the genius of the family, which she really was absolutely, and Krysia was\nreally strikingly beautiful, I mean, she wasn\u2019t just pretty, she was strikingly beautiful.\nAnd I\u2019m always saying this, I\u2019m repeating it forever because it\u2019s a fact, if Mother was\nwalking, let\u2019s say, in the street with Krysia, with Chris, and people would stop and\neverybody would say \u201cOh, what a beauty!\u201d And Mother said, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that because\nshe would get it into her head that she\u2019s so beautiful, she wouldn\u2019t have to make an effort\nin life.\u201d\u2019 But the fact remains that, you know, I always felt well, if my parents say I\u2019m\nsmart, I must be smart or whatever, because there was nothing to be said about me. I\nwasn\u2019t very, exactly very pretty and I don\u2019t think I was a genius, so... And I had these\nteeth, you know, my teeth were uneven sort of, and I was skinny, so that I didn\u2019t present\nanything so outstanding as to be pegged one way or another. However, you see, whether\nthis was an excuse that I took the fact that I was supposed to be smart, or whatever, I\nreally built on that idea. I absorbed it and I lived with it and I built on it, so for better or\nworse, it really, it really did come in handy in later years.",
        "Q: Were you close with both of your parents?",
        "A: Very, we were an extremely close family, and not just with my parents, but with my\nmother\u2019s side of the family, because they lived very near, within twenty - whether it\u2019s\ntwenty miles or twenty kilometers, I don\u2019t know. Grandmother lived in Ostrowiec, which\nis a town very near. Father\u2019s family came from Silesia from Sosnowiec, and that was\nfurther, much further out, was western Poland; whereas Starachowice and Ostrowiec\nwere in central Poland, because Mother\u2019s family came from Sandomierz, which is\nslightly to the south of Ostrowiec and Starachowice, so basically Grandma and my\nmother\u2019s family lived within the area right, you know, how far back the family went, I\ndon\u2019t know, but I do know Mother was born in Sandomierz, and subsequently the family\nlived in Ostrowiec and my mother was married in Ostrowiec. In fact, after the war, when\nI went to visit Ostrowiec - Mother used to say that she was married on the balcony - and\nwhen I went back to Ostrowiec to look at it, of course, the houses were during\nCommunist time in Poland and the building was extremely had the dilapidated look, you\nknow. The outside walls were sort of shabby and peeling but the balcony was there, it\nwas a corner balcony and Mother said they put the huppah out there, because, you know,\nmy grandfather was religious, so that, I imagine, to satisfy his requirements, the huppah\nwas outside on the balcony, and so I found, yes, that was interesting, the building is still\nthere.",
        "Q: What was your father like and what did he do?",
        "A: My father was, well, you know, I shouldn\u2019t be saying that, but you know they describe\nGerman Jews as Jekes. My father was basically from Silesia and brought up, under the,\nunder, you know, western Poland was occupied by Germany. You know, Poland was\npartitioned in the 18\" century, so that the western part of Poland was taken over by the\nGermans, the south was taken over by Austro-Hungary - Austria, actually - and the rest\nwas taken out by Russia. Now, my mother happened to come from the Russian quote-\nunquote zone. It\u2019s not a zone, but you know, Russian sphere of influence; whereas my\nfather, having been born in Sosnowiec and grown up in Silesia, spoke German language,\nwent to German schools and really was this very organized, straight, very precise type of\nman, which they describe as a Jeke, you know, whereas, you know, this is in no way\nderogatory, never.. What I meant to say that he was really very much German, rather than\nPolish sort of thing, but of course he spoke Polish beautifully. And he was an engineer...",
        "Q: Let me ask you something...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ...about his personality.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was he a man filled with humor?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was he very serious?",
        "A: No, he was serious but, you know, there was a lot of singing. I remember that. There was\na lot of singing going on in the house all the time. In fact, I understand that my - whether\nmy mother only or both parents participated in - oh, you know, it wasn\u2019t what you call\nofficial, big theatre, but there were the amateur groups, because I know my mother\u2019s\nbrother, my uncle Morris - Moish - he was very much involved in amateur theatrical\ngroup and I know parents had a little contact with that, but what I do know for an\nabsolute fact is that my father always sung in the house, I mean, he loved Lehar. So,\nwhen I hear \u201cThe Merry Widow\u2019, I always, but forever, associate it with my father\nbecause all certain arias from \u201cThe Merry Widow\u201d were his absolute favorite. You could\nalways hear him sing, and my mother, too. Whether this is different now because there\nare radios and televisions and all this and there isn\u2019t much talking at home or singing\nwhatever, maybe people sing in the shower, I don\u2019t know, but I do know that there was\njust singing, as you walked around the house or whatever, you were singing and so my\nfather was one of these who really kept on singing and not for any audience; for himself.\nMother, too.",
        "Q: I understand that at least Krysia and, I don\u2019t know, maybe Hania and you also sang\nwith...",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, we did.",
        "Q: ...with them.",
        "A: Yes, because, you see, singing was so natural in those days. As I said, you didn\u2019t rely on\nany outside - I mean, a circus came to town, you know, or something like that - but there\nwas never what you call, there was never a regular theater or there was never an opera. It\nwas a small town, you see, so that basically people just organized their own entertainment\nand I was too young to really know, to have even gone if there was one. I would never\nhave gone. In fact, I remember that even to go to the movies, we were, you know, the\nlaws were so strict, a child could not go to movies unless it was a Shirley Temple movie\nor something. I remember going to Shirley Temple movies, but I never ever went to the\nmovies otherwise because they wouldn\u2019t have let me in. That was, yes, and, this 1s why -\nas I said, there was no official theater or, but there was entertainment provided by people\nwho lived there and I, of course, our family being Jewish, in this particular respect, you\nshould not associate our Jewish family with the religious part of town because that was a\nlittle frowned upon, you know. We lived a more secular - not more - we did live a secular\nlife; whereas the religious Jews in town lived a totally different life, as you could see it\neven in New York these days, I mean, you go to Williamsburg, or you go to Eastern\nParkway where the Lubavitch live, and you immediately see that, if you belong to a\nreformed synagogue as we do, it really is not the way we lived life, and we still could feel\nas Jewish as they do and I\u2019m sure as deeply identified with \u201cJewishness\u201d but not\nnecessarily religious \u201cJewishness\u201d to the extent, because we are not observant and our\nhome - at home in Poland - my grandmother was very religious so in order for her to\ncome and visit, Mother had to keep a kosher home, but we were not necessarily kosher in\nany strict sense of the word.",
        "Q: So even though you were a child...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you understand - I know that you went to your Grandma because she was very\nconcerned that you weren\u2019t getting a proper Jewish education.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: But was, did your father come from a more secular home and 1s that why your home was\nso secular?",
        "A: I think so, I really couldn\u2019t tell you, I really truly couldn\u2019t tell you. All I know 1s that\nGrandmother basically, the grandmother herself did not come from a religious family, or\nmaybe she did, because she was very well educated. And for a 19\" century woman to\nknow French and German and be fluent in languages is sort of unusual. She came from a\ngood family. But she married my grandfather, who was very religious, and then she wore\na wig. Yes, so I have one picture, which I have given to the Museum, where there\u2019s a\nfamily picture with Grandma in the middle, and you could see that she 1s wearing a\nsheitel and whether she did it because... Maybe it was an arranged marriage. I mean, I\nreally don\u2019t know. This is all speculation, but I do say that I have never known my\ngrandfather, but I was very close to my grandmother. And she used to invite one child at\nthe time, in the summer, to spend a week with her. So, she did the Baruch Atah (ph) at\nthe breakfast and she taught us how to pray at night but, you know, she felt she needed to\nsupplement what was missing in our education because we - I, personally - went to public\nschool, Polish public school, and I also went to the Tarbut Hebrew school after school,\nwhich was a Zionist organized - Mother was, you know, president of WIZO, and through\nher effort the Tarbut was organized. In fact, my sister Hania, Anna, reminded me that the\nteacher who was hired to run the Hebrew school in our town, a Mr. Wopata (ph), was\nbrought over by my mother, and he lived in our apartment, in our home, until they found\nlodgings for him. So, you see, that in no way it disparages the religious group. It\u2019s just\nthat there was a segment of population in Starachowice - Wierzbnik, meaning Wierzbnik\nbecause we are talking before the war - there was a segment of the population which was\nmore, it was secular; not detached from Judaism, but detached from the strict observance,\nbecause, you know, the religious group, the Hassidim, had their own schools for girls,\nBeth Jacob, and of course they had the heder - the heder, that goes without saying. There\nwas a heder, and there was a girl. None of us went to any of these schools, you see, so I\nwent to Polish public school and to the Hebrew Tarbut after, you know, after my school\nwas out, after my Polish school was out. So it didn\u2019t separate us from the Jewish\npopulation, but we were not part of that other life.",
        "Q: Was there a good percentage of the Jewish population who were more like you than were\nreligious, or was it a really tiny group? Do you know?",
        "A: Really, I couldn\u2019t tell you, but I do know a lot of people on my parents level who were, in\nfact some of them were survivors and I\u2019ve kept in touch with them, and so there were,\nyou know, they were sort of what they used to call \u201cintelligentia\u2019\u2019, which is sort of, I don\u2019t\nknow. I use the expression for the lack of better description because I don\u2019t mean in any\nway to show this group to be superior to the other group. It\u2019s just that this was the less\nobservant group, no less religious, and the fact that my mother was so extremely,\nextremely devoted to the cause of creating, you know, the Zionist movement, the...\nhelping along the pioneers who had gone to Israel, excuse me, to Palestine in those days.",
        "Q: What was she like? What kind of woman...?",
        "A: Very vivacious, extremely vivacious, quick moving, quick thinking and lively, lively,\nvery lively. Father was lively, too, but in a more serious way. Mother was very vivacious\nand the...well, her outstanding characteristic was that she was really very...altruistic isn\u2019t\nthe word, she was very concerned with others. She always did for others, one way or\nanother, she did for others, you know. There was a - I remember there was a flood,\nsomewhere in Poland, I really don\u2019t know, but I do remember that there was money being\ncollected in the community - not Jewish community - for the cause, to help the flood\nvictims. And I remember she made me a boat out of cardboard, because we went through\nthe streets for donations, and I wore that boat, now, I don\u2019t know where the flood was and\nI don\u2019t know how that was all organized. I just remember walking around with this, like a\nship made out of cardboard with , you know, and people would put in coins and\nthat was the collection, so in retrospect when I think about it, and you know, all this idea\nof the Jewish population living parallel lives with the Polish populations but not mingling\ndoesn\u2019t always hold true, because I\u2019m sure this was not a Jewish flood, and I still don\u2019t\nknow where the flood was, but I do distinctly remember as a child walking around with\nthis boat, where people, it was like on a ribbon, you know, I had it attached on a ribbon,\nand people would put in money for the flood victims. So you see, to me, that is, this is\nalready an indication that people who claim that there was absolutely no connection\nbetween the Christian Poles and the Jewish Poles doesn\u2019t hold true because, in our\npersonal lives, I know for a fact that we were very close to Christians, to Christian\nfamilies, some of whom saved our lives later on, but that\u2019s another story. But when we\ntalk about the flood, this is a general, a more general overview of things, and much as\nthere was anti-Semitism on another kind of level, but there had to be coexistence, that,\nyou know, supplied some kind of a living arrangement if nothing else, so... but of course\nwe got off the subject, I don\u2019t know how, we did...",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. Your father was a forestry engineer is that correct?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Did you know what he was doing?",
        "A: No, I just knew that he - the first time I heard the word \u2018logarithm\u2019, was that he was\nworking with logarithms. I don\u2019t know if it was a machine, but anyhow I found that it\nwas the figuration, not a figuration, assessments of forestry, because he used to travel to\neastern parts of Poland, where there were heavy forests, virgin forests and he would\nassess, you know, he would assess the forest for the lumber industry and that was\nengineering and - I - it was engineering for which there was another Polish word, but I\ndon\u2019t know the English word, but that was his occupation. He was, as I told you, he was\neducated in the German language and I imagine German in those days carried a heavy\nweight in the scientific field, so he, I\u2019m sure he had an easy life, easy time of it, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Was he away a lot?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Was he away from home a great deal, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: No, no, those were short trips, because, you know, he was basically employed by, in\ntown. There was a sawmill owned by Jews, I think they were, I never knew, but I think\nthey were from Vienna, or somewhere but the name was Heller because everybody talked\nabout the Heller sawmill. In fact, Hania reminded me that subsequently when the sawmill\nwas taken over by the Germans, there were Jews from our town who did slave labor in\nthe sawmill which somehow or other I didn\u2019t exactly, you know... I only remember the\nfactory, the munitions factory, in relation to the labor camps, because I\u2019m getting a little\nbit ahead of myself, but I always think of war production in the munitions factory, but\nbasically the sawmill was also a war production, if you really want to put it in it\u2019s proper\nperspective, I mean, they certainly weren\u2019t building, doing lumber for Jews to build\nhouses or anything like that, so that goes without saying.",
        "Q: Were you wealthy?",
        "A: No, but we were well to do, but not until just before the war. That was, you know, during\nthe depression, the Heller\u2019s I think sold it, or whatever it was, they sold it or they gave it\nup, I don\u2019t know, but I know that Father lost the position and then we had very hard times\nbut so did everybody else.",
        "Q: So, how, when you say you were well to do, what, how does that manifest itself?",
        "A: Well I mean, if you look at the old pictures, and you they traveled to the Baltic sea to the\nSopot. My parents have a lot of pictures from, had a lot of pictures from that. I also know\nthat Mother had severe arthritis and she used to go for cure, for six-week cure and that\nwas another very wonderful experience because she always took at least one of us. And I\nstill have pictures that were sent to us from Palestine, from Israel, from friends of\nMother\u2019s who had those pictures from Sopot and had pictures from Busko Zdroj which\nwas that, that, no, spa and I remember going with Mother. In other words, what happened\nis one kid went to Grandma and two kids went with Mother to Busko Zdroj and the six\nweeks that Mother had treatments there, of course, generally weakened her a lot. So,\nwhen we would come back, we would go in the country, you know, on a farm, on\nsomebody\u2019s farm and we would stay a week so Mother could recover, and I imagine that\nyou couldn\u2019t well afford, if you couldn\u2019t afford to go to Busko Zdroj every year. In fact,\nyou know, during the war when everything was closed off for Jews, meaning we couldn\u2019t\ntravel, we couldn\u2019t go to school and such and such, of course, Mother could not go, I\nmean, not that we could afford it, but you know, but I\u2019m saying that because she no\nlonger was able to go for her treatments, which was sulfur by the way, sulfur baths, and\nshe suffered terribly, she... her arthritis was much worse because, of course, she, she had\nno way of curing, I mean not curing, you don\u2019t cure arthritis, but alleviating the pain. And\nBusko Zdroj was a very interesting place for a child because the baths were within a park,\nyou see. It was, of course, you could not, this was not a public park, and they had a band\nshell and they had music - opera, arias - and to this day when I hear Tosca, I remember\nsitting in Busko Zdroj in front of the band shell listening to the music, yes, it was very\nnice. And, and we stayed in a hotel, which was very nearby, because you don\u2019t need to\ncross the road, whatever, street, to go into the park for the baths, and I used to go and\nobject to the smell because, you know, sulfur smells like rotten eggs. And I would go\nwith mother and I would hear the sound when they set up - they used to call it mud, you\nknow, those were mud baths basically, so you would - they would turn - there was always\nan attendant and then I sat out in a like vestibule type, or whatever it was, but I wasn\u2019t\ninside, but I would hear when the sound came out \u201cbloto\u201d - that means mud, mud was\ncoming - and you know, and I know what they did. The person would be, Mother would\nbe in a bathtub, the mud would fill 1t, they would put a wooden crate over the bathtub,\nand throw a sheet over it, so that she was submerged in that hot sulfur mud, after which\nthe attendant would take her for a shower and then they would massage her, whatever, on\nthe table like, then we would go home - she had to go to bed. Those were crude, very\nheavy-handed treatments, but they were good.",
        "Q: They helped her?",
        "A: Yes, because during the war she was really sick. She couldn\u2019t go anymore, you know,\nsince Busko was very near Kielce and that required traveling, and there was no traveling\nfor Jews.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: I want to get, before we get to the war period, I wanted to ask you, up until 1939, what is\nyour relationship with your sisters? You are...?",
        "A: Pll tell you right away, from a viewpoint of the family type, they really liked me a lot,\nbut I was never included. This is...",
        "Q: [Laughs. |",
        "A: This is... I probably should now refer back to what I started at the beginning, that my\nparents, sort of, I always felt my parents took pity on me. So they said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re\nsmarter than everybody,\u201d and such, true or false. I mean, I took it for the truth, but the\nfact remains that I wasn\u2019t to bother, to bother, to bother them, because they were already\nolder. I was just to, to be around my parents. So, if you went somewhere, my parents took\nme along. If they went somewhere, you know, I tagged along. And I even have a picture\nsomebody sent me from Connecticut. His parents had a New Year\u2019s Eve party and you\ncan see my parents and his parents, some other people and there\u2019s wine on the table, and\nin the middle of everything, I\u2019m the only kid sitting there. I\u2019m a little kid, a scrawny, little\nkid, meaning it really reinforces my memory that I tagged along, even though whether I\nenjoyed it or not, I couldn\u2019t say, but I do know that I was the special child, so to say, so\nthey took me everywhere, but of course the truth was that they had to take me. [Laughs. |",
        "Q: You know, it\u2019s interesting because Chris is only two years older than you.",
        "A: Right, yes.",
        "Q: But there was - you were the kid to her.",
        "A: Yes. The reason 1s, I think that Chris is, first of all she is the middle child, you know. She\nwas always very independent, Krysia was always very independent, you know, hands on,\nthis and that. I was sort of a kid type of, that you had to look after. So Chris - maybe she\nfelt I was a burden, if she wanted to go and have some friends, have some good times\nwith her friends, why would she bother looking after the kid, if I fell or if I didn\u2019t fall of\nwhatever? You know, but of course, we loved each other. As you very well know, we are\nthe closest family that there is, that there ever was, and that wasn\u2019t even because we went\nthrough the war together, that we were bound by common horrible experience. But\nbecause the family was such, that we really were one, even though - and you know, I\nnever felt slighted, you know. I just knew that, if I\u2019m going to have a good time, it\u2019s\ngoing to be with my parents or with my own peers but certainly not with Chris and Miles,\nand that was even true during the war, not, why did I say? Miles, I didn\u2019t say Miles, I\ndidn\u2019t mean Miles. I meant Chris and Hania. That was even true during the war when the\nrefugees from Lodz were sent in. You know, there was a group of Jews sent into our\nghetto. And immediately the quote \u201cgolden youth of Lodz\u201d ended up in the circle of\nHania and Chris. And they would read poetry, and Byron, Lord Byron in translation and\nall this. I sat in the same room, but certainly not within the circle. I heard it, I was a non-\nparticipant observer. I was somewhere in the room, but I was not of the group, I was with\nthe group, you see? But that did not in any way preclude the terrific devotion that my\nsister had shown me, because I know for a fact there were instances during the war that I\nwas a goner, and had it not been for them, I would never ever have survived. So, you see,\nwhen push came to shove, and of course - but even without that, you know, you study\nkids in the family...you know, some kids... Maybe they felt my that parents protected\nme, so they didn\u2019t need to bother.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you a question. Chris - when I interviewed Chris - she mentioned\nsomething about you, that she remembered, you as a child, and I wonder if you\nremembered the same thing. She said you would always pick up new words constantly\nand use them immediately, often inappropriately, sometimes not... Do you recall that?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Absolutely, I mean this was really, almost an obsession. This is how I became a\ntranslator, because it\u2019s so easy for me to pick up words and think words. And when I\ncame to America, I had no knowledge of English, but having known some French and\nLatin before and having fooled around with these big words - you see, Polish vocabulary\ncontains a lot of words out of Latin, you know - so later on, I - because I really was crazy\nabout words as a child, and of course quite often I used to misuse them, you know,\nmisuse them, but I still used them, wrong or right or whatever; I stuck them in wherever I\ncould. And this is why I had such an easy time with English, because it was really a\nmatter of hearing the pronunciation and learning spelling. But if I read it to myself\nquietly, I could make out the text, because, you see, I have found the similarities with the\nother languages, and the fact that somehow or other, my mind was oriented to words,\nwhatever. So that is true, she is absolutely right.",
        "Q: So, aS you\u2019re growing up - now, you\u2019re born in \u201929, so when the Nazis take over in\nGermany...",
        "A: I\u2019m 10 years old, no, not in Germany...",
        "Q: ...No, 33 - you\u2019re much younger.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, between \u00b033 and \u00b039, do you hear things - I know towards the end of \u201939, there are\nGerman Jews that come into your area, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, do you begin to experience... sense something, even if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s\nhappening?",
        "A: Well, I sensed something, but I\u2019ve said it so often now, and it truly is a fact, I really\ndidn\u2019t know very much, I don\u2019t really know, and I keep saying it, I mean, it\u2019s repetition\nnow until you can\u2019t take it anymore, but the fact is I don\u2019t know what my parents knew\nand when they knew it. And I certainly knew that times were rough; I knew that\nsomething was happening in Germany. But I also knew that there was a famine in China,\nyou know, so - because there was a famine in China in the 30s, I think - so that I knew\nthat there was famine in China and I knew there was something going on in Germany, but\nhow that related to my personal life or to us, it was sort of far-fetched. I did begin, during\nthe economic times, I did begin to feel certain pressures, and I did begin to feel certain\nanti-Semitic, well, direct anti-Semitic references to who we were, but that was not on any\nscale - because as a child, you know, a child can call you a Jew and he can call you baldy\nand he can call you any kind rotten name, and if you can rationalize to yourself within\nthat context, you know how kids fight, and... So, I was aware of a certain change in\natmosphere in Poland because I do know now from studying history that there was a\nwave of anti-Semitism that was extremely, to the naked eye, it was easy to see, because,\nyou know, when I translated - I was working on Korchuk (ph) a lot, Korchuk\u2019s writing,\nand I translated his works - I realized that his only, the only reason for his being removed\nfrom the position of the good doctor, who read poetry and talked about child upbringing\non the radio in the 30s, that he was removed from that position only because of anti-\nSemitism. He was a very progressive educator, as you know, and a very enlightened man\nand he was a Jew, of course, by birth, but he was very Polish in his upbringing and\noutlook, not Christian, but Polish, and he brought all these new ideas to Poland, because\nhe studied in England, you know, and he brought the new ideas, the new approach to\nchild upbringing, because he also wrote stories for children, you know. He wrote books\nabout children and books for children. And he would read and they would call him the\n\u201cold doctor\u2019, and I know, I used to listen to the old doctor, but then I didn\u2019t hear the old\ndoctor. In those days, I didn\u2019t know, but I now know, that the program - that he was\nremoved from the radio program only because he was Jew, because the anti-Semitic, the\nwave of anti-Semitism has progressed to the point where, toward the outbreak of the war,\nit was really almost palpable. And all this happened, you know, after Pilsudski died,\nMarshall Pilsudski, who died in 1935, had the idea of a federal, federalist state, Poland\nbeing, including minorities and such. And after he died - of course all this I know now\nfrom studying history - that those who opposed him so strenuously were of the national\nright-wing party, and they came into prominence in the late 30s, so that the wave of anti-\nSemitism, which actually was given freer reign, could basically come to the fore. You\nknow, they, maybe they weren\u2019t encouraged, but they weren\u2019t stopped.",
        "Q: So, though you know this now...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ...from reading the history, did you experience the change as being that significant?",
        "A: I experienced - you know, I have spoken about this several times. I have experienced a\nfew, a few such - well, it was an incident or it was rather a sort of a one-two-three kind of\na happening. For example, I had - I went to school. I don\u2019t know if it was 1938 or \u00b039,\nfirst day of school, and I had a new teacher.",
        "Q: But this was before the war?",
        "A: Before the war, probably it was 19- No, I didn\u2019t go to school in 1939 because September\nis when the war broke out. So, it had to be 1938. And I went to school and this was a\nmale teacher. And he said, \u201cI would like every child to stand up, and tell me his name,\u201d\nyou know, so that he could acquaint himself. When I stood up, and I said, \u201cMy name is\nRegina Laks,\u201d he looked up at me and said, \u201cYour name is not Regina. You go home to\nyour mother and tell her that your name is Rivka.\u201d (ph) Well, I was so hurt by it, I never\nforgot it. I always talk about it, always, always, because I was so very hurt by it.\nApparently, I have already been feeling other things around me, but they were not as\npersonal, in front of a class, with brand new kids. That was one incident that remained\nwith me for a life, for the life, and another was a new family came to live in my\nneighborhood, and I got very friendly with a girl - her name was Kaya (ph), very lovely,\nlovely. They were educated people, and we used to play a lot. She used to come to my\nhouse; I used to go to her house. And then around Passover, and I don\u2019t know what year\nthat was. that could have been maybe 1937, because I was a little kid yet, maybe.\nAnyhow, so I said, \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go home and play in my house.\u201d And she said, \u201cNo, I\ncan\u2019t go to play in your house. My mother said not to go because it\u2019s Passover and the\nJews take blood from the children for Passover.\u201d You see, that was a child who probably\nwasn\u2019t anymore than 7 or 8 years old. So, those two very personal, very personal,\nencounters stayed with me for a lifetime. But, as I was saying, I still felt part of the\nenvironment that I grew up in. I never felt that the Christians were against me or that I\nwas against them. I could only see the difference between the Hassidim who didn\u2019t mix at\nall and didn\u2019t want to mix, and the Polish population. But as far as I was concerned, I\nreally felt very much at home and, you know, we spoke Polish only at home. My parents\nknew Yiddish and spoke it to each other if they didn\u2019t want us to know. Of course, my\nfather spoke German very well, and Mother spoke Russian by virtue of growing up 1n,\nunder the Russian sphere of influence. But aside from that, Polish was the language. And,\nin fact, a lot of Christians were surprised that we spoke without an accent which is\nprobably - with a subtext, with a hidden subtext, you know, when you got a compliment,\n\u201cOh, my goodness, you speak Polish so well!\u2019\u2019 Of course, there was a subtext, not that I\nknew it then but I know it now. In other words, I was not supposed to speak Polish so\nwell and without an accent by virtue of being Jewish. But really that didn\u2019t bother me in\nthe sense, in any way. I took it as a compliment; I took it as a fact, you see, and I\u2019ve\nnever felt in any way angry at the Poles or blaming them or, or I never, any animosity. I\nmean, they were people to me, dear people, and those especially who were very dear to\nmy parents were very dear to us. And I certainly had wonderful friends among the\nChristian children, so that, that issue never came up. And when those two incidents came,\nI took them as separate and detached from the bigger picture, you know, it was on a\nsmaller scale, kids\u2019 stuff",
        "Q: But let me - can I probe this just a little bit?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was it, that your feelings were, when you - was it humiliation? Was it anger, when\nthe teacher said your name is Rivka what...?",
        "A: Very humiliated, I was not angry. I was... He put me to shame, because my name really\nwas not Rivka. It so happens, if you want to, you know, give a child a Jewish name, it is\nRivka - because Regina is really Rivka - but I was never, in Tarbut, in the Hebrew school,\nI had the name Regina then was Rivka and, but I was never ever - I was either Regina or\nRenia, I was never Rivka and to be singled out like this, I don\u2019t know. I - school was very\ndear to me always, and school was everything to me, and I was always good in school, so\nI felt always elevated and wonderful about the school experience. And this was a very\nharsh and very humiliating kind of experience because I by then knew what it was that he\nwas trying to say. He didn\u2019t care about me. He perhaps wanted to imply that I was\ncamouflaging my Jewishness. Because you see, I did not go to the Jewish school; I went\nto the public school. And there weren\u2019t too many of us, but there were kids, most\ncertainly. So, I sort of felt that I was being humiliated for no reason, and not because I\ncould analyze it in depth. It\u2019s just that I knew that Rivka wasn\u2019t my name. Regina - if you\nlooked, as I said at the beginning, if you looked at any kind of my legal papers or\notherwise, records or whatever, it\u2019s always Regina, not Renia, and its not Rivka, it\u2019s\nreally Regina - so that this was my name, I was born and given this name. So that, that\nwas a double humiliation, as if I were really telling a lie or something on one hand, or\nmaybe I was trying to camouflage something which was not the case.",
        "Q: Were there other Jewish kids in the class?",
        "A: Oh yes, certainly, yes, children, absolutely",
        "Q: Did he do the same thing to them?",
        "A: Not in this particular instance. I don\u2019t know, he must have, I don\u2019t know, just me.",
        "Q: And what did the other kids do when he said that? Did they do any- Did they laugh, did\nthey...? Nothing?",
        "A: No, and I went home and I told Mother. I said, \u201cHe told me to tell you that this is not my\nname.\u201d Mother says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d And what was done about it, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did he ever call you that name again?",
        "A: No, no, he had to call me Regina because that was in the record. But Mother did feel the\nhumiliation I suffered and she said, \u201cAh, doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s not a big deal,\u2019 whatever it\nwas, but I never forgot it. So, it absolutely stayed with me all these years and, you know,\nChris and Hania, I don\u2019t even know if they know about it, 1n the sense of... I had a few\nincidents in my life, including the German, the war. There were certain little incidents\nthat hurt so much, that were totally insignificant on a larger scale, but somehow, you\nknow, I guess it\u2019s how you, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what is important to you in life or\nwhatever.",
        "Q: Right, it\u2019s hard to know what it is that .",
        "A: Yes, but those, yeah, those two things I never forgot, the one with the Rivka and with the\nJews, blood for the matzos.",
        "Q: So, what did you say to that little girl when she said this to you?",
        "A: No, nothing!",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: Nothing, I said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t want to come? That\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t want to come.\u201d So,\nshe said, \u201cOkay, you come after the holidays.\u201d",
        "Q: So, did you go home and tell your parents that she said this to you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what did they say?",
        "A: They said nothing, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to play with her because she\u2019s new.\u201d You\nknow, so they said, \u201cWell, you know she\u2019s new.\u201d You see, this is the whole point. Our\nparents, especially with regards to me - I cannot speak for Chris and I cannot speak for\nAnna, Hania, I cannot speak for them - because I was really truly protected. Anything\nthat ever happened was somehow smoothed over. \u201cOh, she said that she\u2019s new here.\nAnyhow, you don\u2019t have to play with her.\u201d You know, \u201cHe told you that your name 1s\nlike this? You know that\u2019s not true, you know you have your own name and that\u2019s what it\nis.\u201d So that, there, things were always smoothed over in a way where they shouldn\u2019t\nbother me, but some of course did bother me and they stayed with me obviously.",
        "Q: Do you remember, do you remember people coming into your parents\u2019 house, adults,\nbefore, right before the war, where there was people talking about what might be\nhappening? Not that you participated in it, but did you ever experience people coming in\nand there being a certain kind of tension in the house, even though you couldn\u2019t...?",
        "A: Well, I know my parents were very sociable. They always had company and such, but I\nreally don\u2019t remember, no, I don\u2019t remember. As I said, I do, did know something going\non with the German Jews and I knew there was famine in China. I knew that, but this,\nthose were such big issues and I was not ever invited to share this kind of conversation,\nyou know, so I guess between that and being protected, it really ended up by my being\ntotally oblivious to the realities of the late 30s.",
        "Q: I thought maybe you would be sitting outside of a conversation...",
        "A: Well, I would, I would listen, yes, but you know, somehow it sort of went in and out, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Okay. So then September 1939 comes, yeah, September 1939. And this must be a huge\nshock. All of a sudden...",
        "A: Yeah, the Germans, yeah, yeah. That was, I mean, it was not a shock, because they were\nalready talking about the war, there\u2019s gonna be a war, but of course the larger part of it I\nreally didn\u2019t know. I just knew that the Germans were invading and there were anti-\naircraft trenches being dug and all this thing - the youth, mobilize the youth to dig the\ntrenches. I wasn\u2019t invited.",
        "Q: [Laughs.] You were too young.",
        "A: So, I wasn\u2019t invited, but I do know there is going to be a war. Why the Germans were\nplanning on a war, I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know anything except for the fact that, when,\nwhen, Father was, what you call, they had civilians for anti-aircraft, what you call... a\ncivilian force for alert, you know, so my father was a captain for the block, or whatever\nyou call it. And he used to go to briefings to say when, you know, and then the sirens\nwould wail. So, Father went to briefing and he came home and he said there\u2019s going to be\na, a bombardment and they are going to be bombarding Starachowice because there is\nthis factory here, this munitions factory, and the town 1s ordered to evacuate. You see, so\nthen I knew the war was on. Now, that had to be very early September. The war broke\nout on the first, on the western part, so maybe this was the fourth or fifth or something\nlike this, but first week of the war. And we were told to evacuate, I mean, not were told -\neverybody, all the precinct captains spread the word, and everybody was to head for the\nforest. There were woods, you know, surrounding the area. So, we did as told and\neverybody was going toward the forest. And Mother made sure that we got dressed very\nwell, that we wore the best...this always amazes, amuses me because this was around the\nholidays, you know, the Jewish holidays. I got a pair of brand new shoes, so Mother says,\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best thing to do is to wear the best clothes and to have enough, because God\nknows when we\u2019ll come back and you might as well have the good stuff rather than the\nold stuff, right?\u201d So, I put on a pair of brand new shoes which were never broken in, and\nafter, later on when we came back, I had blisters on the feet. [Laughs.] Anyhow, we had\nto get dressed in more than one thing because, in case, when we come back and there\u2019s\nno house left, we had to have something. This was the hottest September on record. So,\nwe ended up in the woods outside...",
        "Q: But how many...?",
        "A: I had a few layers of clothes and the new shoes, brand new shoes, which I never wore. I\nwas going to wear them for the holidays. So that we ended up in the woods.",
        "Q: Did you take, I understand that you all carried something of value from the house. Is that\nright?",
        "A: Yes, right, not so much of value. Mother took sugar, yes, and I remember she had the\nsalami kind of a thing she took there, because we did not know where we were going or\nwhat we\u2019ll be doing, and whatever you could wear, that\u2019s the good stuff, you wore.",
        "Q: Did you take something special of your own?",
        "A: I forgot, that, maybe we did, maybe, maybe...could be that we did.",
        "Q: No, no, no, I mean you.",
        "A: Personally?",
        "Q: A toy, a doll or something?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. I only remember the two things, that 1t was extremely hot and I\nhad bad blisters on my feet because we ended up in the forest, in the words, mixed in\nwith the, not just with the population of Wierzbnik, Starachowice, but all the peasants\nwho lived in the surrounding area also evacuated and they basically took their horses and\ncows and dogs and so on. So you had this cacophony of sounds, the cows, and of course,\nI like to tell the story, of this, this sort of a joke on us type of incident. The factory, as you\nknow, was smelting ore, because there was ore in the area, and they were doing, it was\ndoing already war production, because in Starachowice, where the factory was, the plant,\nwas located in a district called the central [says name in Polish] the central industrial area,\nthat was organized for Poland after the first war, to arm themselves because they felt, you\nknow, now that Poland was independent since 1918, they had to be armed. Well, they\nlocated these factories, the plants, in this central Poland area that had iron ore deposits, so\nthere was ore smelting and such, so the rationale was such that in the first war, the first\nthing that was really destroyed were all the munition factories and all this. By virtue of\nthis historic truth, all you could expect is smithereens in our town, so that everybody\nevacuated because if not, you were going to be wiped off the earth together with the\nfactory, you see. And we found ourselves in the woods, with all that as I told you, the\nmixture of the Hassidim and the secular Jews and the Christians and the peasants and the\ncows and the dogs and the horses. Meanwhile, the Germans came very close by. There\nwas no bombing, no significant bombing on Starachowice, because obviously they were\ngoing to take over that factory in a blink of an eye, which they did. And we got caught in\na valley - \u2018we\u2019 meaning the entire mixture of everybody - we were caught in the valley.\nThe Germans were on the one - you know, I come from a hilly, it\u2019s not mountainous area,\nbut hilly, the Swietokrzyskie (ph) mountains are not far from us, but this is hilly area - so\nthat you had the Germans on one side of the valley, you had the Polish troops on the\nother, and they shot at each other while we were in the valley, so that one horrendous\nnight, when all the bullets were flying, we were right in the middle. And of course, the\nGermans in those days, and I know this for a fact, many more times from this one...\n[Tape cut off. ]\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: I think the tape stopped before you explained how the planes were swooping down with\nlights underneath them and shooting at you.",
        "A: Yes, at the group caught in the valley - townspeople and the peasants from the\nsurrounding areas - and of course that was real, true, naked warfare, that\u2019s what that was,\nbecause eventually, I hate to say that, but I do know that there was bayonet warfare going\non, and that was my first real true awakening to what was happening.",
        "Q: You must have been scared to death.",
        "A: Scared to...that was a night of total fear. I mean, you know, later on, because I didn\u2019t\nknow fear, how, how extensive and how fierce fear can be, but that one night was the first\nexperience in my life of acute fear. I didn\u2019t know whether we would ever make it,\nbecause we were not just in the crossfire, we were also being shot at from the airplanes.\nBut all this went on until the morning. At dawn, of course, everybody went back to town.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did your mother hold you? Were you being held on to by somebody during the night?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we, I remember there were, the peasants had carts, you know, a cart with the\nhorse, and I remember everybody was hiding under carts, you know, because they could\nsee, and as I said before, the Germans, they didn\u2019t see us. They could hear because there\nwas all that barking and baying and, and whatever other animal sounds you could hear,\nand even if the people were quiet. You cannot quiet an animal when he sees, when he\nhears shooting, so that gave us away. And the funny thing is - I just remembered\nsomething - at daylight, at daybreak, we sort of scattered from the area, and then the\nplanes came again, and I ran over - everybody said, \u201cRun under the bushes.\u201d So, you\nknow there were trees and bushes, because we stayed in the forest. The valley was sort of\na clearing, it was in the clearing, but surrounding was the forest. So, I ran over as fast as I\ncould and I grabbed a tree. Well, it wasn\u2019t a tree! This was a Polish soldier! Because, you\nknow, they had olive drab uniforms, green, type of green. And, of course, in the panic, I\nmean, everything, so I - the thing moved, the tree could move. Well, I look up and there\nwas the soldier, but that was more as a, you know, I thought I probably felt good about it\nbecause he was going to protect me, you know, whereas everything else was naked fear.\nAnd subsequently when we went home - this is also very important, I think I\u2019ve already\nmentioned it - the town was not bombed, absolutely not bombed, and that was, with I\u2019m\nsure by design. So that eventually when everybody got settled back and it was now\nofficial that the Germans have occupied Poland, the factory was taken over and converted\nto heavy war machinery and, whereas before the war, Jews were not employed in that\nplant, now Jews were beginning to be taken in as a labor force. Now this is just the mere\nbeginning, because eventually, of course, the Jewish labor force was the primary force,\nbecause it was slave labor and it didn\u2019t - they had to pay the Poles. So, I really, I'm not an\nauthority on it, but I would suspect that the professional engineers or whoever it is in that\nwar industry, were retained and perhaps these unskilled workers, maybe the Christians,\ncould have been dismissed, so that Jewish slave labor was hired. Because subsequently - I\ndon\u2019t mean right now at the outbreak of the war - but subsequently, not only would the\nJews start working as a force, labor force, in the factory, while there was still a ghetto,\nbut once the ghetto was liquidated, there was a labor camp set up just to supply workers\nto the factory and, since there were always typhus and there were shootings and killings\nand Jews were just disposed of here and there, there was forever a new shipment arriving\nof workers. Now, what the specific number was of workers of workers, I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe 2,000, but I know that the number stayed as was, because they had all these\nassigned spaces, I imagine. So that the slave labor was already in full operation shortly\nafter the outbreak of the war, but later, when the camp was set up, they kept the number -\nbecause you know the Jews, the town was cleared of Jews, so they had no more, no more\npeople in Starachowice to supply for the labor force, but they did bring them in from all\nover everywhere.",
        "Q: Do you happen to recall your first supper, dinner when you came back from the forest?",
        "A: Yes, I absolutely do! You know, it was hot summer, and we came - in fact, when we left\nin the morning, we didn\u2019t clear the table, because it was such a rush, and we had to get\ndressed, and we had to pack up, and Dad said, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, we\u2019ve got to move\nbecause the bombs are going to fall any minute and the whole town is just going to be in\nashes, and we\u2019ve got to get out,\u201d So, we left everything. We came back, there were flies\nrunning all over, all the dishes were on the table, and I don\u2019t really remember but,\nwhatever there was yet, I\u2019m sure, you know, my mother must have kept stuff in her\nsupply cupboards or whatever. So, I don\u2019t know that we experienced starvation when we\ngot back, because it took awhile - you know, that was basically the German, the concept\nof eliminating the Jews by any way you could, so it\u2019s by starvation, or by shooting or\nwhichever. But that did not enter the picture. You came home and whatever you had in\nyour cupboards - and I imagine my mother must have stocked up on things because the\ntalk of war was so prevalent. The only thing is that, you see, this is modern warfare - I\nmean, not by today\u2019s standards, when you have atomic weapons and such - in those days,\nthat was modern warfare, but as you know even when you study sociology, they tell you,\n\u201cFirst things happen, then culture and the way of living adapts itself to what\u2019s\nhappening.\u201d Now, when the second war broke out, people like my parents, who survived,\nwho went through the first war, applied the reasoning of the first war to the new\nexperience of another war. In other words, what was true then should be applied now, and\nthis is how you are going to manage this new event. But of course that was as far from\nthe truth as it could be, because the warfare in the first war was not the same, the\nblitzkrieg itself, you know, the airplanes and all, that was the - I mean, the Germans\noccupied Poland I don\u2019t know how many, five days something like that - so who... in the\nfirst, in the first war, there was no such thing. There was, there were battles fought hand\nto hand, and this is why the bayonet fight, that I heard later, that was sort of unusual\nbecause it didn\u2019t fit the picture, but we did hear it at night when they said they were\nfighting with bayonets. It could be that was also hearsay because, yes, people would\nexpect that, judging by the first war.",
        "Q: What is your most immediate recollection of the change for your life, not everybody\nelse\u2019s life, but as a child?",
        "A: Yes, the first and foremost, I didn\u2019t go to school. That was first. Number two, there is a\nriver runs through Starachowice, Wierzbnik its called Kamienna, it\u2019s a tributary of the\nVistula. Now, we used to go swim in the river. We had a little dog and he used to go, we\nhad a maid, she loved that dog, so she - we would go swimming and she would soap up\nthe dog in a bucket and throw him in the river, and then would go after the dog in the\nriver. Anyhow, so number one, there was no school. It was very hot, September was very\nhot - couldn\u2019t go swimming. Then you started seeing - the Germans were marching\nthrough the town, all the time, in formation, they sung. You know, they were always\nmarching wearing those boots and singing. And very soon, there were these - I cannot say\nwhether it was Gestapo, SS or whoever - they started coming around in these little\ngroupings, individuals, two Nazis or three Nazis, with a dog or two dogs, so that\nimmediately put a stop to my even going outside to play. So, all the things that were dear\nto me, starting with school, number one, were now out, certainly couldn\u2019t go Ostrowiec\nto visit Grandma because travel was out. So, I probably didn\u2019t understand the larger\npicture of what was involved, but I certainly knew on a more personal basis that things\nare completely different and that whatever is happening is not good. That much, I mean, I\ncould see.",
        "Q: Did you feel, as a Jewish person, as a Jewish child, different from what was happening to\nthe Christian Polish kids? I mean you had, there was a very close family, the\nPaliszewskis, to you, right?",
        "A: Yes, exactly, the Christian people, yes. Well, the point is, eventually, I mean, I don\u2019t\nknow, 10\" of September, 31\u00b0 of, 31\u00b0 of October or whenever, the schools were open and\nthe children went back to school, but we didn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t that the schools were closed. The\nschools were closed to Jewish children. So, that was the first and immediate, so to say,\nblow to my...to me. And whatever other bigger things that were happening, I was\noblivious of that because nobody told me. As I\u2019ve said so many times, my parents were\nso protective that I never really knew the full truth until the war was over and I started\nreading up on things that I found out what really went on. I just knew that nothing was\ngood anymore, and certainly I couldn\u2019t go to school, so that was a big blow.",
        "Q: Was your maid Jewish or Christian?",
        "A: No, no, she was Christian, she was Christian.",
        "Q: So, what happened to the maid and the dog?",
        "A: Well, this is, this is an interesting story. I always talk about my dog, I loved him!",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Ledy.",
        "Q: Lenny?",
        "A: Ledy , I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s meant to be Lady or Ledy or whatever, but we called\nhim Ledy. And it was a birthday present for one of us. My father brought him in a packet.\nHe was a tiny little pup, all white, a Spitz, and my father - I forgot who\u2019s birthday it was\nbut that was a birthday present - and he was a very lovely, beautiful white dog but you\nhad to brush him all the time, and the maid adored him, her name was Genia (ph).\nAnyhow, shortly before the war, he became vicious. What happened, we had, my mother,\nmy grandmother, from Ostrowiec had a cousin by the name of Pfeffer (ph). They were\nvery well-to-do Jews in Ostrowiec, and her son - her sons had all the motor vehicles that\nwere good in 1939 - her son, one son had a Ford and one son had a motorcycle, and he\ncame running through Starachowice on his motorcycle and had an accident and ended up\nin the hospital, in the Starachowice hospital. He was from Ostrowiec his name was\nPfeffer (ph), the last name, but I don\u2019t know his first name. Well, anyhow, the mother\nimmediately came, stayed with us, and she cooked for him. She started cooking all these\nexquisite dishes, and he wouldn\u2019t eat, because he was laid up in the hospital - I don\u2019t\nknow he had broken bones - she would bring it back and feed it to the dog. Now, the dog\nwas on a very strict, whatever. This dog started eating all these fancy things. Anyhow,\nthis is the story I was told why he became vicious. One day, a woman was passing by -\nbecause there was a big courtyard, you know, in European houses, you had a gate, like a\nbig gate you went through, and there was a courtyard - a woman was coming through the\ncourtyard, he was barking to get out, he jumped on the handle, however, he got himself\nout of the house, ran over and tore the woman\u2019s skirt up front, a whole big chunk of skirt.\nWell, after that, of course, my parents had to pay for the clothes and so on, but he was\ntaken to a farm, so we had to give him away, because he was unmanageable. I always\nknew that he was spoiled by that food, but maybe not, I don\u2019t know. But anyhow, so we\ndidn\u2019t have the dog. As for the maid, she lived way out, at the outskirts of the town, with\nan old mother. And she was a maid for my parents from way back, I mean, way, way,\nlike when Hania was a baby, because we have pictures from the Baltic sea and such, she\nsits there, Genia (ph) sits with Hania, you know, we see her in pictures, we saw her in\npictures a lot. Anyhow, she lived in the outskirts of the city, and subsequently she turned\nout to be one of those who did not prove herself to be a true friend, because she took\nthings from us during the war that Mother wanted to give her to save, like a sewing\nmachine, you know, things of value, and she absolutely denied. When Chris and Hania\nwent back to Poland and went to see her, she had drapes, velvet, green velvet drapes, and\nbedspreads to match, it was hanging and she said she didn\u2019t have it. My mother had a box\nof china that was in perfect condition that she took. She denied it; it was right there. And\nshe, I think she said she was going to denounce them, Chris and Hania, you know,\nbecause you know Chris and Hania went back to Starachowice and there was this horrible\nincident that night, and the Paliszewskis saved their life. So, you right away have this\nbalance, you can balance this, whether Genia (ph) was greed, it was pure greed, or\nwhether it was other motivation, I don\u2019t know, but she was member of the family for\nyears, I mean, many years, so that she did not prove to be a friend, as good a friend as she\nought to have been, because she was treated very well by the family. But of course the\nothers, the Paliszewskis, they were people who saved our lives and such. So, you can see\nthere is never a one answer to this kind of a problem. This is why I\u2019ve always felt that, as\nmuch as you want to remember personal incidents, the true picture to me of living in\nPoland as a Jewish person is not of one of animosity to the others, you just, you have to\nhave that understanding because always for one example, you will always find another\nexample to counterbalance that, and this is exactly how I have felt right along and not\nmany people feel that way, I know.",
        "Q: No, I was going to ask you why, because often, certainly in my family, the anger at the\nPolish population is sometimes more severe than to the Germans.",
        "A: Yes, this is how it was, and people from my hometown, very much so. I don\u2019t know if\nyou know that I was involved with the restoration of the cemetery in Starachowice, and\nwhen I originally brought up the subject - later I went to Poland in 1980 and we went to\nthe cemetery with the Paliszewski\u2019s granddaughter, she took us there - we took pictures\nof the cemetery itself and of different tombstones which were, of course, overturned and\novergrown and whatever. I really don\u2019t read Yiddish, so I couldn\u2019t tell whose tombstones\nthey were. Nobody from our family is buried there. Anyhow, when I came back and\nVictor made large size, you know he blew up the photo - we had them made into large\nphotographs and I took them to the Starachowice reunion, at the annual . Well,\nI was practically attacked by some. They told me, \u201cRenia, you should be ashamed of\nyourself. How you even think of having to, that we should restore something to give\nmoney to them. They never did anything for us. They would take the money, they\nwouldn\u2019t do it, anyhow.\u201d This 1s a project that started in 1980 and it was only realized ten\nyears ago, because I finally realized there were people of good will who decided those\nwho feel that way do not have to participate, and we did, and we did through the right\nchannels and with the right money and everything is done. In fact, I just wrote an\nintroduction to the book that\u2019s coming out about the cemetery, and I was very fortunate to\nhave it registered with one of the people from my hometown who were dear friends of\nmy family, Pola Frank (ph). She is no longer alive; she was my teacher in Poland. In then\nlast minute, we registered the Jewish cemetery in New York with a Jewish organization -\nI don\u2019t know the name of it. The building is right across Temple Emanuelle on 5\"\nAvenue, 65th Street. I think there was a Rabbi Chaiar (ph), or Chaiat (ph) somebody.\nAnd we came in, and said we don\u2019t have the funds yet, but we\u2019d very much like to have\nthis on - they were submitting a list to the Polish government of Jewish cemeteries - in\nthe nick of time, he said next week or next day, whatever, they were going to submit. We\ngot the name in. So, immediately, within a year, there was a sign posted that this is a\nhistoric landmark not to be touched. But it took us a number, a good number of years to\nrealize that we should not wait around or take the criticism of our hometown people for,\nto prevent us from doing the project. And between Israel and Canada and us, we had the\nmoney in no time. We send - it was done through Israel: the money was sent in, the\narchitect was found, the caretakers were found. Apparently, that cemetery in\nStarachowice 1s now the model restored cemetery. But you see, this, I said that in\nreference to how other people felt. Not only did they feel terrific animosity to the Poles\nduring all that went on, because, you know, a lot of people felt that the Poles did not do\nfor Jews what they could have. But, you see, even after the war, for something as terribly\nimportant as a Jewish cemetery in a town that had all this population obliterated, there\nisn\u2019t a sign that there was Jewish community there except for the cemetery, and that was\nmy project from the beginning, Pola Frank (ph) and I were saying: Here you have the\npictures, here is what it looks like, the houses were being built on the cemetery, first the\nGermans took the tombstones to pave roads, then the Poles brought their homes closer\nand closer. Give it a few more years and you would have nothing, so that we were very\nlucky that, against all the criticism, we went ahead and because we worked in cooperation\nwith Israel and Canada, we were really able to do it. And now I\u2019m so pleased about that.\nThis is really something, you know, second generation people go to visit, and other\npeople from Israel, and I was told that even the people who do oversee now, you know,\nwhoever oversees the Jewish cemeteries in Poland, says that ours is the nicest, the best\nkept and so forth. The stones are upright, the lettering was done, it\u2019s cleaned up, beautiful\nfence, iron fence with a beautiful gate with the magendavit (ph) on it, very nice, very\nnice.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s get back now.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The one question I wanted to ask before the tape is going to run out is what did, happened\nin your family when school was no longer possible for you. I understand a little school\nwas developed in your house?",
        "A: A little school developed, right! And Hania, of course, was the main force behind it\nbecause she was the family genius - she had all the books. In fact, when she was in high\nschool in Radom, she used to do tutoring, anyhow, so this was like breathing air for her.\nAnd she took three of my friends and myself and she formed a little class, and we\nfollowed the curriculum which she knew and for which the books were available in the\nhouse. So, it was a regular school, with regular homework, and I resented the fact that she\nexpected more of me than all the others, and I said, I mean, she lives with me in the house\n- you'd think she could be a little easier on me, but no. But, of course, later on I realized\nthat my really truly foundation for my further education came from that, because we\nreally studied seven days a week.",
        "Q: Seven?",
        "A: Well, we did it at home. You couldn\u2019t go swimming, the dogs were - the Germans were\nout with the dogs, people were being rounded up for slave labor, and kids were just either\nshot or kicked or the dogs was, you know, they were always threatened with dogs and the\nNazis went around with the rubber whips, so even if you didn\u2019t get killed, you could be\nbeaten up terribly, a dog could eat you up or whatever, so the only thing was to be home\nand that, that really was...",
        "Q: So, how many hours a day was Hania teaching?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but big section, a big segment of the day was for classroom, and then\nthere was homework. And then I - he reminds me, of a friend of mine, Mitye\nWeigensburg (ph), they were neighbors not far from us, and people wanted to read books.\nThere was no access to libraries, we are now talking about the secular Jews, you know.\nSo he and I opened a lending library. He always reminds me about it - he lives in\nConnecticut we meet once a year at the . We took books from every house,\nwhoever wanted to, and we had a lending library, so today you had my books and I had\nyours, and we kept records.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re ten, eleven years old?",
        "A: Yes, yes, and you know, the strange thing about it 1s, I always say, I talk about it, nothing\never goes to waste, because, in later years when my kids were in public school in New\nYork, I was the volunteer chairman of the library in the school for 11 years, I ran the\nvolunteers who worked in the school library here, so, I always tell him, I say, \u201cGuess\nwhat? Whatever we did then applies now.\u201d And that was true, so the schooling was done\nat home the homework was done at home and the rest was still around the books, we had\nthe lending library. People were delighted to get books because people couldn\u2019t go out,\nyou know, and this is already in the ghetto, you know, because later on forget it, later on\nwas different.",
        "Q: You had paper, enough paper in the house?",
        "A: Yes, because in the old days, you know how to recycle everything. I mean, you never\nthrew away a little piece of paper that wasn\u2019t filled in. And we made little cards, so we\nwrote who - I can assure you it wasn\u2019t the Dewey decimal system - it was just a scribble\nhere, a scribble there, Mrs. X got this book and Mrs. Z got the other book.",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019ll take a break now.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Renia, tell me something about what you think the effect of having a home schooling was\non you? I wondered whether you thought that in future years that it was very helpful to\nhave all this - whatever it was you learned - in your head.",
        "A: Yes.\n[Tape interruption |",
        "A: First of all, you know, as a child, you don\u2019t really plan a future and you don\u2019t look ahead\nto things that are included in the grown up world. You live in your own little world, and\none day\u2019s this and the next day\u2019s that, and past it, maybe two more days, and past it, there\nis no planning. But absolute - my absolute thrill about being able to study was that I was\nback in school. Not for future background or future foundations of how I was going to\nuse it or not use it. It was just the mere fact that my access to study was not severed as\nwas my access to everything else, such as going swimming in the river or playing\noutdoors or whichever. So, this was absolutely the only viewpoint that I had. Never for a\nminute orienting myself to how that was going to come in handy. Aside from which, you\nknow, as I analyze now the system, the educational system in Poland as against the\nsystem in America, Polish education emphasized - it was sort of an elitist concept - but it\nemphasized education for its own sake. You know? You could end up being a carpenter,\nbut you could at the same time be the highly educated person who read all the\nphilosophers and knew the highest level of mathematics, and never apply it to what you\nwere doing, but had the education. And, I don\u2019t know, by osmosis, I guess, that rubbed\noff - that concept rubbed off on me. So that studying, as I said before, because this was\nwar, and I was back in school, and just one day to the next being occupied by books was\ngreat. But by the same token, I always breathed that air that said, you know, you study\nbecause it\u2019s such fun; because you\u2019re going to be a mathematician or you\u2019re going to be a\nprofessor or whatever. You studied because that was really part of the great, great joy of\nlife. And so, assuming that I, in my child\u2019s way, incorporated those two aspects, it was\nstudy for its own sake. Plus, it kept me out of the street where the Germans were with the\ndogs. And it kept me very occupied. Plus, it also kept me in a competitive setting. It\nwasn\u2019t monotonous to the extent that you were doing everything for yourself, by\nyourself, without measuring yourself against some other people. And these were my very\ndear friends, so that the entire idea really revolved around being occupied - gainfully\noccupied, not just killing time or wasting time. And whoever even thought - I certainly\ndidn\u2019t know - planning for the future. I could never, ever visualize, even when I was\nolder during the war and the war was coming to an end, I couldn\u2019t even visualize the end\nof the war or what I would be doing. There wasn\u2019t such thing in my mind ever of a pre-\nset plan, you know, of applying this to that and doing this and that. Everything that came\nafter really evolved out of my basic studies with Hania, there\u2019s no question about it. It\u2019s\njust that I brought to it a certain attitude already, which of course lasted me for the\nlifetime, that school is joy and I loved it and it was good. But I didn\u2019t know how it was\ngoing to fit in the future - who knew that I would even survive, and who even knew how\nthe world would end, how it would look, and how... No, this is totally outside the realm\nof my imagination. Really, to put it totally in the perspective, that\u2019s exactly how it goes.\nIt didn\u2019t... The idea of a future occupation or a future plan that would evolve out of the\nstudy with Hania never entered my mind, really!",
        "Q: How many hours a day did Hania teach you?",
        "A: You know, that I couldn\u2019t tell you, but I know it was a, it was a big chunk of the day, big.\nPlus the fact that I did homework, and lots of it. Lots and lots of it, so that I was really\noccupied all day.",
        "Q: Did she give you good grades?",
        "A: She did, but she always reprimanded me \u2018cause she said I could do better than that. So,\nshe did reprimand me, even in front of the other kids. I didn\u2019t appreciate that, but I loved\nher anyhow. But of course my parents were absolutely thrilled because there was nothing\nfor a child to do, and being outdoors was very dangerous, so that, that really filled all the\nneeds. My parents were satisfied, I was happy, Hania was happy, so all around, it really\nwas good.",
        "Q: So, did you not go outside at all?",
        "A: Practically not. Because, even if you did go to play, like kids play ball or something, and\nsomebody would say, \u201cOh, they\u2019re out again with the dogs,\u201d you would immediately go\nin. Because, you know, people were being - grown-ups were being rounded up for all\nkinds of things: for deportations, for killings, for cleaning, for whatever. But children\nwere just as big a temptation for a Nazi with a dog as a grown-up was, just for the sake\nof, you know, scaring a Jew kid.",
        "Q: Just to get everything clear, you were 10 years old when...",
        "A: ... when the war broke out, right.",
        "Q: Hania was 15 when she was starting to teach you, right? And Chris is 13.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: And Chris was also in a class, in Hania\u2019s class.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, but not in my class. Hers wasn\u2019t a real class; hers was more... You see, this was\nthe whole idea of keeping yourself occupied with books. At my level, it was a class. I\ndon\u2019t know that Chris had homework or anything. But it was more like maybe\ndiscussions or reading together, you know, like people could get together to read and\nshare books. But that was a very wonderful - this wasn\u2019t an idea that came from outside;\nit came from the house. But that really kept us out of harm\u2019s way.",
        "Q: It put you in a different world.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, to sit out the war - nobody knew anything about anything that\nwas going to happen or wouldn\u2019t happen, but you know, you have to sit out the war and\nhowever best you can, and this was a fine way.",
        "Q: So, the thoughts that you had are that this is war, nothing else terribly bad, it would be\ndeprivation...",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s not the first war that the parents were talking about, and people who were still\naround that have lived through the first war. You know, the deprivation, and then the\nsoldiers are fighting, you see. And if you\u2019re not on the front, and you\u2019re not caught where\nthe soldiers are fighting, then the war will blow over and everything will be fine again.\nBecause it\u2019s the soldiers who fight; civilians don\u2019t fight.",
        "Q: So, how do you remember what happened to your father? Do you remember what you\nsaw when you were 10, 11, 12, during those...?",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you what I remember. As I told you, the memory being so selective, that I\nremember all these nonsense things - not nonsense, but the little things that really stuck in\nmy mind, when the biggest things escape my memory. But I do remember how my\nmother was upset when Father was rounded up for cleaning detail. You know, because\nthis was below his station. I think I said that in the interview, because that also stuck in\nmy mind. Mother always talked about it. Father was rounded up in the street and nobody\nknew where he was. And Mother went, and she said, oh, you know - she was told that the\npeople who were rounded up are cleaning out - cleaning - are sweeping the railroad\nstation. So, she went to the railroad station. She was looking, couldn\u2019t find him, and there\nwas this German - German soldier, but she didn\u2019t see the men, the Jews there. So, she\nwent over to him and asked him, \u201cExcuse me, where are the Herren?\u201d - Where are the\ngentlemen? And he said, \u201cThese aren\u2019t gentlemen; these are Jews!\u2019\u201d\u2019 And how Mother was\nupset about that, and of course, Father was terribly humiliated. Because this was early on\n- this was still in \u00b039 - and this was such a humiliating experience for a man, like this, and\nfor Mother, too. So, Mother always talked about it. Of course, we realized later on that\nthis didn\u2019t really mean all that much, because what came later is a totally different\ncategory. But in those days - this was right after the Germans conquered Poland - so, that\nmuch I remember that Mother was very upset about it. You know, those are small things,\nbig things, but they are a very big part of the bigger picture of genocide, because those\nwere the initial steps, as you would now know, but certainly we didn\u2019t know then.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection of the time your father came home having somewhat been\nbeaten up by a Nazi?",
        "A: Very vague, very vague. That, I know it happened, but the recollection is very vague.\nMaybe I just eliminated it from my psyche somehow. No, that I don\u2019t really... I just\nremember one man, Roman Zinger, was brought around. He was hit and his jaw was\ndislocated. And he was taken around by the Germans to show what you\u2019re going to look\nlike if you do not obey. I remember that, but I don\u2019t remember about my father.",
        "Q: How long were you able to stay in the apartment you had been living in when you came\nback after the evacuation?",
        "A: Well, probably \u2018til early 1940, because we lived on the main street, which connected the\nold Wierzbnik and Starachowice. That was called the main street, and that was called\nPiusutskego (ph). First 1t was called Starachowice, then it was called Piusutskego (ph).\nThat was the first street evacuated, because that was the so-called best street. After - and\nwe were just pushed further into Wierzbnik. You see, we were on the connecting street\nbetween the two towns. We were pushed further into Wierzbnik, but that was only the\nfirst location. We had three more places that we lived in before the towns were\nliquidated. I don\u2019t know how much of the Starachowice story was told in terms of the\nhistorical events. You see, there was no so-called closed ghetto, as we know a ghetto to\nbe, like a large ghetto, like the Warsaw ghetto. Our ghetto was a gradual - As other parts\nwere being cleared of the Jews in my hometown, they were being sent further into\nWierzbnik. As little villages were being evacuated around the town, all these people were\nbeing sent further into Wierzbnik. But the Christians who lived there were not dislocated,\nyou see, so that at no point was there such a thing as a barbed wire or anything like that,\nyou see? Those Christians who still lived there lived there, and the Jews were just packed\nin and packed in and packed in. And then of course our street that we were sent to, that\nwas cleared, so we had to go further in, and we ended up next to the Christian cemetery\ncalled the Old Cemetery - there are two, the New Cemetery and the Old Cemetery. We,\nour last residence was past the Old Cemetery - that was the location - and we lived in a\nChristian\u2019s home. He was a teamster; he had a horse and wagon. They occupied half, and\nwe had a kitchen and a din- and a living- one room and a kitchen. Half of his house. And\nuntil the time until we were actually liqu- that the town was liquidated, that\u2019s where we\nlived. That\u2019s where went for the Final Solution, my parents and I, not Hania and Chris.\nAnd they lived next door; the Christians lived next door. So this is, this happened\nbetween 1940, early 1940, when Piusutskego (ph) Street was cleared, up to October 27,\n1942. That was life in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Until \u00b042.",
        "A: \"42, yes.",
        "Q: When you moved each of these three times, is 1t your parents who found the place? Or\nyou just run out? Do you have any idea?",
        "A: No. I have no idea.",
        "Q: You have no idea?",
        "A: I imagine there was a relocation office or something. I really don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t tell\nyou.",
        "Q: What do you recall about what your father was doing? Obviously, he\u2019s no longer for a\nlong time doing...?",
        "A: He was a scribe.",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: He was a secretary. He used to type. I really don\u2019t know, but I know that he was not what\nyou call a functionary of any significance. You know, he had, he had, he\u2019s not part of any\nJudenrat.",
        "Q: So, there was a Judenrat?",
        "A: I think so. I\u2019m not sure. But I know Father was always, because he was so neat and\norganized, and he typed, and so he was always that guy who did the secretarial work\nthrough the camp, you know, through the ghetto and the camp. But I truly don\u2019t know. I\nthink there was a Judenrat in town...",
        "Q: But you\u2019re not sure.",
        "A: Not sure, and I really wouldn\u2019t know who was in it. Even though I did read in the\nStarachowice, the book, the names, but I really wouldn\u2019t know for sure.",
        "Q: During this period, prior to the ghetto really being formed, even though it isn\u2019t a closed\nghetto, do you experience a lot of fear, knowing that you have to be in the house, even in\nspite of the fact that you love schooling so much.",
        "A: Oh, yes, but then I first started to realize what this was all about. I mean, we didn\u2019t know\nwhat this was leading up to, and we certainly didn\u2019t - / certainly didn\u2019t know what was\nhappening elsewhere, that I didn\u2019t know. But I did know that, by virtue of being near the\nplant, the war production plant, that people were being sent in for their labor. You see, I\ndidn\u2019t realize that basically it was the other way around. People were being cleared out of\nother places to be sent here, not because they were needed. In other words, the Germans\ndidn\u2019t go outside of the ghetto to find these people. It\u2019s just that all these other\ncommunities were being cleared, and Starachowice was the logical place to shove them\ninto, even though it would be bursting at the seams, for the reason this was access to\nslave labor. Of course, I know this all in hindsight, but in those days, it just seemed that\nperhaps they were trying to have more labor, a bigger labor force, so they were just going\nout and sending these people in. But of course, it was the other way around.",
        "Q: Is your, 1s your mother working also?",
        "A: I think so. Yes, I think so. But I don\u2019t remember where, but I think she was working.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re in the house with your...",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Both sisters? Chris was...",
        "A: Chris and Hania were working in the brick factory.",
        "Q: Right from the beginning?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I just remember at the end, that\u2019s where they were.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was given a job very shortly, very - probably, at the, the same month probably that they\ncleared the town of Jews, I was given a job in the factory, in the plant, just putting the...\nYou know, these were cannon shells; they weren\u2019t too big. You were supposed to put it\non, on the machine, and the lathe would, you know, like you carve an apple, would take\noff the first peel and then you took it off. It was piecework. And they were around to\nwatch you and count. You put it down; you put another one. Anybody could do it; you\ndidn\u2019t need the Herculean strength to do that. And then, of course, after the town was\ncleared of Jews, and of course, that\u2019s going further into the camps, I started working in\nthe laundry. So, after that, I never worked in the factory, only in the laundry. Whereas\nHania and Chris were detained overnight in the brick factory, so that the morning that the\ntown was cleared of Jews, they did not report to the square, the market square. But I did,\nwith my parents.",
        "Q: I want to get to that, but I just want to ask you a question about your little school friends,\nthat you went to school with.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were these close friends of yours?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m Jewish, obviously, yes, and from the same, from the same type of family. You\nsee? Again, as I was trying to explain, I did not mean to divide it into superior or inferior\nor anything. The secular type of Jews who lived in town, and these were my friends.\nThey were absolutely my friends.",
        "Q: And did they live very nearby? Because given what you said, it was dangerous for kids...",
        "A: Yes, well, they lived very nearby, yes, they did. They lived on Piusutskego (ph) also, so it\nwas very, I mean, access was easy.",
        "Q: Did you talk privately with them about what was going on?",
        "A: Frankly, I probably did, because I was always very curious about everything, you know,\nbut maybe I just... I absolutely don\u2019t remember. But, I'll tell you frankly, when there was\ntalk about war, before the war broke out, and my parents said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s going to be a\nhorrible thing if there is a war because the first war was so bad.\u201d You know, they used to\ntell us about the first war. And quietly I was thinking to myself, \u201c\u201cWhy would a war be so\nbad? You know? You could learn all these new things and you could find out and it\u2019s\ndifferent...\u2019 So, quietly thought, well, I think the war would be good, because from my\nviewpoint, why not? I mean, all these exciting things that my parents were talking about,\nyou see? So, then, when the war came, and I am quite sure that we talked - the kids,\namong ourselves - talked about the same thing, up to a point. Because finally, when we\nrealized what was really going on, then I am sure that we changed around. Because once\nwe Started fearing for our own lives, it was no more that idealized version of new things\nhappening. And that I remember distinctly, that I always used to say, \u201cGee, I really would\nlike a war, because I would know what - you know, new things that are happening, you\nknow, how they do it. Because war means soldiers fighting; it doesn\u2019t apply otherwise.\u201d",
        "Q: So, it was a sort of entertainment that your parents gave you with these stories...",
        "A: Not an entertainment. It was something, it was an experience that I would really, yes, I\nwould very be glad to be part of, but... uh... it didn\u2019t turn out that way.",
        "Q: Chris told a story of about a bunch of young people - I have no idea if you were there -\noutside when somebody - now, I don\u2019t know exactly where this is because I don\u2019t know\nexactly where she was describing - they were outside, it seemed to be the summer, and\nsome young man came out from the bushes looking awful and talking about Treblinka.\nAnd Chris and Hania brought him into the house. Were you there?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I was there, but I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember the story?",
        "A: You see, how big was the house? By now, we must have lived in one room. I couldn\u2019t\nabsent myself. The fact is my parents never told me directly anything. Whatever I did\nknow, I probably guessed, and then I probably rationalized quickly, that this was, because\nyou know, they were saying rumors, all kinds of gossip. And rumors, gossip, I\u2019m sure\nthey were saying rumors and gossip just to protect us. You know, but I truly don\u2019t know.\nI\u2019ve said it so many times. I don\u2019t know what they knew, and what they didn\u2019t know, and\nhow much they withheld from me personally, not from Hania and Krysia. You see that I\nreally don\u2019t know. Chris was really sort of a more mature person. Chris was always a\nhands-on and practical type, so I think she could have known much more than I did, but I\ndid not know.",
        "Q: Actually, she said that she didn\u2019t believe this guy. And brought him in to the house, and\nyour parents asked her to leave.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, she didn\u2019t hear...",
        "A: You see, so she also didn\u2019t hear. And if she didn\u2019t hear and was asked to go out, I\ncertainly would never had been told about it. That\u2019s absolutely a fact.",
        "Q: Now, during these two years prior to the - because I want to get to the evacuation - during\nthese two years, are things getting worse in terms of food, in terms of...?",
        "A: Yes, this was the time when the screw was being tightened, you see. There was scarce\nfood; you had to really fight for it. You had to keep - you could still barter; you still had\naccess to the Polish population, you see, so you could barter and you could buy and you\ncould try the hardest you could, but subsistence was meager, very meager. And then - I\ndon\u2019t know if Chris told you about it - but one Sunday, when people are leaving church -\nyou know, the church was up on Church Street. Cruzcherna (ph) was up on the hill, and\nthe market square, where we were eventually, from which we were sent to the selection.\nThe market square was - coming down from Cruzcherna (ph), from the church, was the\nmarket square. Something happened - Poles killed a German or something - and I\nremember distinctly, they built a gallows in the market square and they hung 12 Poles on\na Sunday, when people were coming down from the church, from Cruzcherna (ph) Street,\nfrom Church Street, down to the square. In other words, I suspect that whatever exchange\nthere was between the Jews and the Poles, surreptitious as it was and quiet as it was,\ncould have diminished to a great extent, because that was a warning to others, too. Of\ncourse, I found out what happened years later that they lured a German or two Germans\nto a prostitute and they got there and they killed them. And so for that, 12 Poles were\nhung on a Sunday after church. So, I imagine - I don\u2019t know what year this was, but we\nwere still living in the so-called ghetto. And, of course, whether this 1s a direct result -\nwhether the starvation that was setting in was a direct result of this warning that they give\nto the Christians, they gave to the Christians, I don\u2019t know. But, of course, food was\nscarce and, and things were very bad. The only thing was that Mother was very inventive;\nshe once an excellent cook, so she made things out of nothing. The first time in my life I\nate cookies that was baked with sugar beets, made with sugar beets - it\u2019s because there\nwas no sugar, of course. So, that\u2019s, that\u2019s the screw was being tightened, but 1t wasn\u2019t yet\ncompletely tight. You see, there was still the possibility of surviving, if the sickness\ndidn\u2019t kill you, if they didn\u2019t shoot you, if the dogs didn\u2019t tear you to shreds.",
        "Q: One very brief question before we take a break, because the tape 1s going to run out: Do\nyou remember when you had to put an armband? I understand you wore an armband?",
        "A: Yes, absolutely, a white armband with a blue - a blue Star of David on it. Probably right\naway, probably when we still lived on Piusutskego (ph), I suspect, including children.",
        "Q: Until the end? Until the evacuation?",
        "A: Oh, yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: Right. All right, let\u2019s take a break and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: Renia, I want to ask you to describe one of the most difficult days, probably, of your\nentire life, the evacuation, October 27\", 1942.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Can you lead us through the day?",
        "A: Yes. First, I have to say that Chris and Hania - Ana - were employed in the brick factory.\nBecause, as you well know by now, there was the munitions factory, munitions plant,\nthere was the brick factory and there was the sawmill, and I think there was one more. I\ndon\u2019t remember. All these employed slave labor. And the word got around - first of all,\nable-bodied people were taken anyhow - but word got around that if you work, you have\na chance to have a better life. Not survived - we didn\u2019t talk about survival and all that. It\u2019s\njust that you could live a little better 1f you had a job. So, anybody who was anybody\nsecured a job. Now, Hania and Chris worked in the brick factory, and they had the night\nshift. October 26\" to 27\" is when they were inside the factory, in the brick factory.\nOctober 27\u2122 in the morning - I think 6:00 in the morning - is when the round up started\nfor the evacuation of the Jews from the hometown. Now, Hania and Krysia were never\nreleased from the factory, and I really don\u2019t know about people who worked in the\nmunitions plant, but I imagine they were also kept back, because they were already a\nwork force that could be counted on. Well, I was at home at the last of our residences in\nthe ghetto, sharing the house with this Christian family, and that was past the Old\nCemetery, the old - old Christian cemetery. We were made to walk. First of all, the knock\ncame on the door, and \u201cEverybody out, everybody out.\u201d We got dressed - I know, again,\nseveral layers of clothing - and we were driven toward the market square. So, as we\npassed the old cemetery, we started coming nearer to the market square, and that\u2019s where\na lot of Jewish people lived before the war anyhow, but now, of course, it was packed,\nbecause other streets have been cleaned - not cleaned, but cleared of the Jewish people.\nAnd as people would walk out of the buildings, if they didn\u2019t walk straight, if their child\nwas crying, the Germans were in a total frenzy, and there were Latvians who were\nassisting. They were shooting at anybody who didn\u2019t rush, who didn\u2019t go as fast as he\nwas told, who didn\u2019t walk straight, had one more bundle than, than it was absolutely\nallowed. So that, between the old cemetery and the square, which was probably no more\nthan half a mile, there was such atrocities that I rather thought the world was ending.\nBecause, I mean, I\u2019d seen a lot of things up to that point, you know, but I had never seen\npeople falling and children, infants smashed against the walls, and you know, horror upon\nhorror, and this was only a half a mile walk. Now, my parents held me by my hand on\neach side, and as I said, I was overdressed because Mother insisted. I also was a very\nskinny child, and she wanted to make me look more mature. Of course, I wasn\u2019t\ndeveloped, I was just a mere child, so she shoved some stuff into me to make me look\nmature and developed and she put rouge on my cheeks. And we walked to the market\nSquare, and as we were coming closer, there was a building where Mother\u2019s very dear\nfriends lived, and there was a family Kalinyerska (ph). Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) was an\nelderly woman, maybe in her seventies - I mean, for a child, age at that time... I don\u2019t\nknow, but I know old Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph), that\u2019s how I know her. Her daughter went to\nPalestine through the efforts my mother\u2019s Zionist ha-sharat (ph). So, she was there. And\nas we were passing very near the square, Mother - she couldn\u2019t walk - Mother took her\nunder the arm and walked with her to the square, and I followed with my father. And\nwhen we came to the square, the scene was indescribable, because they had the Latvians\nand they had the Germans and they had dogs. And people were being whipped with\nrubber whips, and people were shot with rifles and with guns and with whatever. And\npeople were screaming and everybody - they were shouting and - whatever. We came on\na scene which was very hard to understand, because the Germans, who were standing at\neach corner of the square, directed the people coming out of these adjacent streets: \u201cTo\nthe right here, you go this way, you go this way.\u201d You had no idea which way you were\ngoing. All I knew in the final analysis was that Father was sent one way, which I\nunderstood because the men were separated, I was sent another way, and Mother and\nMrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were sent another way. So, I still couldn\u2019t make out what is\nhappening here, and who is going where and why. Very soon, my group was whipped\ninto formation, and I mean whipped in to formation, I think five rows and five across, and\nwe were driven toward Starachowice, meaning by Piusutskego (ph) and that way. And\nwe had to march in formation, as if to - as 1f to a beat, and whoever couldn\u2019t make it,\nwhoever stumbled, was immediately shot on the spot. Now, I at this point had no - First\nof all, I didn\u2019t know where Hania and Krysia were. I knew they never came home from\nthe factory. So, I could just imagine that they could have been sent in another group like\nthis - whatever - or maybe they were somewhere dead and I didn\u2019t see them. I didn\u2019t\nknow. And as I got into the group driven that way toward Starachowice plant, I found\nmyself eventually in Strzelnica - of course, I didn\u2019t know what Strzelnica was about - but\nthis is where I ended up, in Strzelnica in an open area, and we were told to sit down and\nstay there. I was beside myself with fear. I was horror-stricken and totally lost. I think of\nall my traumatic experiences in the world, that is absolutely the most traumatic. Because\nyou know, at all other times, I had somebody to lean on - Chris and Hania or my parents -\nthis, I was totally alone, and I really didn\u2019t know, you see. I didn\u2019t know that Chris and\nHania were still around. I was petrified. I cried, and I was... So, people who knew the\nfamily, they said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t cry. Mother will come, and this will sort itself out. This is\nwhatever it is. They...\u201d Whatever. Eventually, I found out that Father was in the same\ncamp, in other words, he was with the men and I was put with the women.",
        "Q: So, you marched off with women.",
        "A: With women, to Strzelnica, and Father marched off to Strzelnica with the men.\nSubsequently we found out that people like my mother and Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were\nput on a train. Nobody was saying where, but of course, that train went to Treblinka.\nHania and Krysia, on the other hand, after all this was over, they were sent to place called\nMajowka, which was another camp in town. So that somehow, because then they started -\npeople were beginning to be shifted, because I forgot how it was - I think Majowka\npeople used to work in the sawmill, or something, or the brick factory - I really don\u2019t\nknow how it was all decided who worked where - but I do know that word came back to\nus that Hania and Krysia survived - no, the word was not \u2018survived\u2019 - that they were not\nshipped out. That they did not - that they were not shipped out, that they are still around,\nand that they are in Majowka. So, of course, now I\u2019d met my father - not that I stayed\nwith him, because men were separated from women. And Father again went into the\noffice to do book work for the . And Hania reminded me that what happened\nlater was that Father was sent to Majowka, or however it was, or Krysia was sent... How\nwas it now? I forget how it was, but anyhow, two of us were in Strzelnica, Father and I.\nHania and Krysia were in Majowka. Later on, the camps were combined. And, of course,\nlater on the camps were shifted again. But at this point, I was with my father, and that, of\ncourse, was a great consolation, even if I didn\u2019t stay with him, because he was with the\nmen\u2019s group. I stayed with women who knew me, who knew the family, and looked after\nme up to such time as Krysia and Hania joined me.",
        "Q: Can we just go back?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to visualize the picture you\u2019ve created.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You\u2019re a child of... 1942... You\u2019re thirteen...",
        "A: Thirteen, yes.",
        "Q: ... thirteen years old, and you\u2019re seeing a level of violence - you\u2019ve seen some violence -\nbut you\u2019re seeing a level of violence that...",
        "A: Never ever.",
        "Q: ...exceeds anybody\u2019s imagination. Do you scream when you see things?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You\u2019re very quiet with your parents.",
        "A: I am scared.",
        "Q: You\u2019re so scared... Right.",
        "A: I am scared out of my wits. I really, I couldn\u2019t scream. In fact, when we finally got to\nStrzelnica, and I didn\u2019t know yet Father was around, I couldn\u2019t yet cry - but I cried later -\nbut I couldn\u2019t yet cry because I was overwhelmed with fear. The terror of it all and the\nfear, it\u2019s sort of, you know, like you become breathless. I was frozen in the fear of it all.\nAnd I must say, this was the first time - the march to the square and then the march to\nStrzelnica - were my real first encounter with horror which I could not avoid. You know,\nlike when we were coming back from the woods, when the war broke out, I saw dead\nhorses on the road. I didn\u2019t see ever dead horses before, so I covered my eyes. I sort of\ncovered my eyes, and I didn\u2019t see the - I saw the dead horses were coming up, and there\nwas a dead horse, so I covered my eyes. But later on, there was no way of covering your\neyes, because the horror was such, and you had to watch yourself, and you had to stay in\nline and you had to march as fast as you were told to. So that the overwhelming fear was\nsort of like paralysis, you know, paralysis of your brain. You don\u2019t think. You make the\nmotion, your body propels you, but it\u2019s not the brain; it\u2019s the fear that propels you, I\nguess. And later on, until I wound down enough to cry - it took awhile because I was out\nof my mind with fear because, for the first time in my entire life, I was alone, left in these\ncircumstances, where all these years I was so protected.",
        "Q: This is going to be a strange question, but...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you think you were afraid because you were alone or because you were vulnerable,\nbecause you saw how vulnerable, or was the two of them...?",
        "A: No, I was afraid because I was alone. Because, first of all, because of what I saw, you\nknow? This was a shock to my system. Even if I were too much (ph) with parents and my\nsisters, I would still be shocked out of my wits to see the horror that I encountered\nbetween leaving the house and the selection in the square and the Strzelnica camp. I\ncouldn\u2019t cover my eyes and I couldn\u2019t make believe it didn\u2019t exist because I had to have\nmy wits around me to pay attention to everything because, if somebody fell under my\nfeet, I couldn\u2019t stumble. So, the entire picture revolved around saving your life however\nyou can, so you cannot disregard what\u2019s happening around you. So, that\u2019s 1942, and this\nis the rude awakening that is the point at which I was facing up to what 1s really\nhappening, even though I wasn\u2019t yet told anything.",
        "Q: So, when you... Is the first person in your family that you saw your father?",
        "A: My father.",
        "Q: And did you talk?",
        "A: Well, maybe not. No, maybe waving or something.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: There was not yet, you know... We were segregated; he was in one group, but the fact is\nthat he saw me and I saw him and we waved. And then other people got in touch with\nother men, so everybody said, \u201cOh, Renia, your father said that he\u2019s here and he\u2019|I look\nafter...\u201d>\u00bb And you know, so people would send messages that way. So, that was the only\nthing. But of course he did not know what happened to my mother. But of course maybe\nhe knew and didn\u2019t tell me. Because my mother was supporting an elderly woman. So if\nyou really had any, any understanding of the situation, you knew that Mrs. Kalinyerska\n(ph) was not one to be going to slave labor because she was old. And my mother,\nsupporting her, had to go with her.",
        "Q: So, one would assume if that young man who came out of the bushes - the story that\nChris told - and if your parents really believed him as to what was happening in\nTreblinka, your father probably figured out where your mother probably went.",
        "A: I can tell you, my understanding of everything is that they knew much more than they\never let on, because they were intelligent people, aside from which, you know, my father\nwas fluent in German. In fact, he spoke and wrote and read German. He used to subscribe\nto German periodicals and such. I doubt very much that my father didn\u2019t know. I mean,\nthat is impossible. But the fact that he didn\u2019t tell me, that is an absolute fact.",
        "Q: So, did you keep in your head that at some point you would see your mother again?",
        "A: Yes. Absolutely. I kept 1t in my head that - because, you see, the word \u2018resettlement\u2019 was\nbeing bandied about. What that word meant didn\u2019t quite - was never clarified, but they\nsaid \u201cThe resettlement to the east, the resettlement...\u201d\u2019 The word \u2018resettlement\u2019. So, you\nknow, you can always rationalize it. If you have already met the quota for slave labor for\nthe Starachowice plant and the other factories nearby, then you resettle... I mean, on the\nchild\u2019s level, you can more or less follow their train of thought. The others were resettled\nto places which was needed other people, so that was resettlement. And by the same\ntoken, I couldn\u2019t imagine that I wouldn\u2019t see my mother again, so that was another thing.\nHiding from the real possibility of what happened. I felt that way right along, you know?\nI knew I didn\u2019t know. I knew what I didn\u2019t know. I really realized, but I didn\u2019t want to\nknow.",
        "Q: So, how long did it take before you met up with your sisters, do you think, about?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really know, but my next recollection of the camp was - yeah, I worked in the\nlaundry, you know, I was assigned to the laundry.",
        "Q: That was right away?",
        "A: In Strzelnica, right away. So that I did not go to the factory anymore. I worked in the\nfactory maybe a month at the most. I worked in the fa-... And my next recollection of the\nplace was that Hania became very - Hania must have already been in, because she had an\nextreme case of typhus. And I remember that, because selections were being made. We\nhad to line up, and they told you to run, and whoever could not run fast enough was taken\nout and shot. People were taken - ten or twelve men were told to dig a grave - and then\npeople were taken over to the pit and shot. So, I do remember that Hania had such an\nextremely severe case of typhus, she was hallucinating and talking out of her head. I also\nhad typhus but a mild form, so that, that was the one thing I remember so distinctly. And\nI met here in Florida, I met a friend of mine who worked with me in the laundry three\nyears ago, and she said to me, \u201cYou know, Renia, you saved my mother\u2019s life.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cI saved your mother\u2019s life? I never heard of anything like that.\u201d And she says,\n\u201cWell, what happened is when we worked 1n the laundry...\u201d She and her mother worked\nin the laundry with me, and her mother had a severe case of typhus. And they called us\nout and told us to line up, and she says that I stood - she put the mother between me and\nher - her mother was a tiny little woman; we were both taller than the mother and we held\non to her and they passed by and didn\u2019t notice and she survived. Whereas I know for a\nfact that her mother saved my life because when I had typhus, she told me to stand over\nthe cauldron where the steam was coming from, because I was red, you know, feverish,\nso she says, \u201cWhen they see you, they will know that it\u2019s the steam.\u201d And so it was - they\nopened the door and looked in and then if anyone was sick with typhus, and we were all\nover the cauldrons there, and when I turned my head, they saw me all sweaty and red, and\nI was just one more slave worker doing laundry. So, that was actually, she - that was Mrs.\nShacter (ph) - And so it was news to me when she told me I saved her mother\u2019s life. But\nthe fact is that selections were being made right along, and typhus sufferers were\neliminated one by one. So, Hania miraculously survived that selection.",
        "Q: What did you - what went through your head when you saw these selections and people\nbeing killed because they were sick, or for some other reason? Did you think they were\ngoing to kill everybody?",
        "A: No, absolutely not. I just don\u2019t know what I thought at that time. I just knew that times\nwere very bad. And I just hoped maybe the war would be over and how it will be over, I\ndidn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know who was fighting whom, and where was the front or if there\nwas the front, or the Germans were there to stay, or whatever. I just figured that it\ncouldn\u2019t go on forever, you know, one way or another it has to end. And I just - I made\nno connections. In fact, I was really, truly - I was not an independent thinker in any such\nway that you could imagine me, planning or... I probably understood what was going on\nvery well. I understood it very well, because horror is not very hard to understand. It\u2019s\nnaked horror in front of your eyes, so you know what is happening. But how that related\nto the overall thing, I knew I was petrified. I lived in fear every second of my life. That I\nknew. After that, I couldn\u2019t say that I ever could figure out the next day or the month later\nor if it will end - I knew it would end sometime - but how and when, no such thing.",
        "Q: Now, you were probably a little past the age of when a young girl would have\nmenstruated.",
        "A: Oh, yes, not past the age, but, just to give you the quick overview, I went through all the\ncamps - Auschwitz and Ravensbrick and Retzow and back home to Poland - and I still\ndid not start. So, that was what you say called a delayed reaction.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And of course, I was not developed and I lacked proper nutrition; I was a skinny child.",
        "Q: Did you know that you were supposed to menstruate?",
        "A: But of course!",
        "Q: Yeah. And were you nervous about the fact that...?",
        "A: No, I was glad!",
        "Q: [chuckles]",
        "A: I was very, very happy - not happy, but I was glad because I feared - that was one extra\nfear, what would happen if and when I did, because supplies were - if you can call them\nsupplies - rags were hard to come by. No, but I never had such a fear because nothing\nwas happening and nothing did happen and I never developed until after the war.",
        "Q: Were you able to notice whether other women were menstruating in the ghetto?",
        "A: No, I know that they didn\u2019t because in Auschwitz - I repeat that like an ignoramus\nbecause I don\u2019t know what it means - but in Auschwitz, they used to say that the soup,\nthe so-called soup that we were given, had brom in it. Now, I don\u2019t know what brom is -\nand this was some kind of a - whatever it was, a medication or whatever - that that\nprevented women from menstruating. I have no idea, I am just repeating it as I heard it.\nSo, I know that the women did not menstruate. Why, I wouldn\u2019t know, and whether it\nwas due to some concoction or an agent or a chemical being put in the food, I couldn\u2019t\ntell, but I knew that much.",
        "Q: Now, that\u2019s a long-term myth, that they put in something in the food.",
        "A: It is.",
        "Q: They put stuff in the food, but not to stop menstruation.",
        "A: So, maybe lack of nutrition...\u2019",
        "Q: That\u2019s why I was asking, in the ghetto circumstance and in the camp circumstance - you\ndidn\u2019t get it, but I wondered whether you noticed that other women...",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t know?",
        "A: I know that I did not until way after we came back to Poland, and I mean, way after.\nMaybe even later than that - maybe in Berlin in \u201946. As far down the road as that.",
        "Q: And what was food like in the camp? What did you get in the morning? Did you get two\nmeals, three meals, if one could call them meals?",
        "A: Would you believe that I really don\u2019t remember? I know that we were fed. But, in those\ndays, we were getting Pancheska (ph), the Pancheski (ph) family were sending, you\nknow, they had some of our better things, crystal, silver, and they were selling it off little\nby little and were sending in money. One of the husbands, actually, it was one of the\nsisters was married to one of the men who worked 1n the factory - you know, one of the\nPancheska (ph) sisters. There were four sisters, so one of the husbands - the husband of\none worked in the factory, and he used to bring - Maria used to sell the stuff - and he used\nto bring the money. And she was the only one who never even wanted that stuff\noriginally, but Mother said those are things of sentimental value. In fact, after the war,\nwhatever we had from home is from them. You know, those little Passover silver cups -\nDid Chris tell you about it?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, so those things, she kept that she didn\u2019t sell yet. Because, Genia (ph), the maid, she\nhad really - she really wanted everything, and she took everything. But you know, a\nsewing machine is not of sentimental value, and bedspreads and draperies have not got\nsentimental value. So, she took it and it was her own, but Mrs. Pancheska (ph) took\neverything my parents had - you know, gifts, wedding gifts, and such, silver - so, they\nkept it and sold whatever they felt that would bring in more money and that\u2019s how we\nsurvived.",
        "Q: So, this was an unusual circumstance to have somebody so close being able to get things\nin to you?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And is it the case also that she was able to get medicine in when you had typhus?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No. Money was nothing. I mean, money you can hide but you cannot hide things. And he\nused to give it - the husband of one of the sisters - used to give it to somebody we knew\nand they would bring it from the factory, so that worked out.",
        "Q: Did they take away your clothes when you went into the - into the camp? You had all\nthese layers of clothes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you do with them?",
        "A: No, in that camp, we kept our clothes. They didn\u2019t give you - I don\u2019t think so - not until\nAuschwitz. I think I wore my personal things.",
        "Q: And where did you sleep?",
        "A: In barracks. You see, Strzelnica was what they call a shooting range originally, and then\nthey built a bunch of barracks there, you see, so that is where one of the camps was made,\nwas Strzelnica. Whereas - Now, when I went to Poland, in 1980, I asked - Pancheska\u2019s\n(ph) granddaughter took us there. I wanted to see Strzelnica. Well, it\u2019s back to a shooting\nrange, you see. And some of the barracks were left over but not all. So, that was an area\nthat was inside the woods, and the barracks - again, I can\u2019t tell you whether they were\nbuilt for us or built prior or however, but there were barracks and we slept with women.",
        "Q: We need to take a break now, to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: Renia, how would you describe your relationship with your two other sisters at this\npoint? I mean, they\u2019re sort of... Do each of you have a different role at this point, I mean,\ncould you describe it that way?",
        "A: In a sense, yes, and in a sense, no, because as far as I\u2019m concerned personally, I was\nalways at the receiving end, meaning I received all the love, and I received all the\nprotection, and I received all the care and all everything. I was the one really who most\nlikely contributed list to the general survival scheme, or whatever you call it. I was on the\nreceiving end of it most of the time. I adored my sisters. Krysia, Chris, my next higher\nthan I sister, was always the practical kind and always very wise in organizing and\nassessing, so... Hania was sort of in the clouds. She was very smart and very brilliant, but\nshe was always sort of - she was catered to, you know. In those days, if you had a very\nsmart person in the family, you had to defer to that person because you couldn\u2019t disturb\nthe genius at work. So, it sort of carried over to her... Not that she was a sponger of any\nkind - it\u2019s just that she was really at a certain level of higher existence that she didn\u2019t\nreally have to so much worry about everyday things. So that basically, Chris was the one\nwho pulled the two of us toward the center, you see? And Hania was very bright and very\nintelligent, and understood most everything better than I do anytime, but we loved each\nother a whole lot, and the fact that we were now separated from our parents - now, I\u2019m\nsaying separated because we were still separated from our father but we knew he was\naround and saw him every now and then and would wave to him, and we were separated\nfrom our mother because we really did not know what death was all about. So, we\ndeluded ourselves that, well, this resettlement, whatever. Having seen so many people\nresettled from Lodz and from Austria in our own hometown, we knew what resettlement\nwas all about. People were being shifted here and there, and so Mother was shifted\nsomewhere else, and everything is going to come out fine, because when everything ends,\nshe will show up. So, basically, we were even closer as a unit now than we ever were.\nAnd, I must say, I contributed only by the fact that I was there, and they felt that they had\nto protect me, and so that was a little more mortar to the binding. But I was not the\nplanner; I was not a - I didn\u2019t visualize things in practical terms. I understood the\nsituation very well, having now seen what was transpiring, but how that applied to\nanything; it really didn\u2019t, not in my little world, because this was all stuff I didn\u2019t know\nhow to deal with. Besides, I had these two protectors. First I had my two parents; I was\nalways the tag-along. Now, Hania and Krysia were sort of protecting me. So, I just had to\nsee that I stayed out of trouble, that I was alert at all times to what was around me, that I\nunderstood the danger, that I understood how to handle myself, you know? And the rest, I\nknew I was being provided with the love and protection. And that truly was how I really\nsurvived the war. Not on my own account in any way. I don\u2019t take credit for survival at\nall, truly. That is how I actually saw myself. I saw to it that I really should know what\nwas going on and try to avoid getting into trouble, meaning situations that had no exit.",
        "Q: Why wouldn\u2019t you consider that - I don\u2019t want to call it a survival strategy - but why\nwouldn\u2019t you consider that things that you actually did? You had to watch, because...",
        "A: But I was not responsible for anybody but myself, don\u2019t you see? In the way we were\nbrought up, watching out for yourself wasn\u2019t the greatest thing in the world that you want\nto do, because you really always needed to think of that other person. But by virtue of\nbeing at the end of the line, and not being terribly attuned to realities and not being old\nenough to understand it all and put it together, I could understand the danger and the fear,\nbut I couldn\u2019t relate it to the fact that I was doing anything special, because I wasn\u2019t\ndoing anything for anybody. I was trying to keep myself alive by seeing that I survived,\nyou know? That\u2019s about it. Not by harming anybody, not by doing anything special, but\nby just watching out, and of course, to keep control of the fear, which was a task of itself.\nControlling your fear is extremely hard, if you see if your fear is legitimate, it\u2019s\nextremely hard to do.",
        "Q: Could you control your fear?",
        "A: At certain times I could, at certain I could not. Like the time when I was alone going to\nStrzelnica camp. But my fear was uncontrollable, but there was double fear of what\nwould happen if I didn\u2019t control myself - because everybody was just falling by the\nwayside. You see, that much I understood.",
        "Q: Were there other kids about your age in the camp, as well?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: There were?",
        "A: Not only, you know, I imagine you must have heard about it. Not only were they in the\ncamp, they were basically smuggled into the camp. They were outside the camp with\nChristians, or however they were smuggled. These kids eventually went to Auschwitz,\nsurvived Auschwitz, five and seven year old kids, survived Auschwitz, and one of them\nis still alive in Israel. But three of these little kids that lived in camp, who went to Poland\nafter, to Starachowice after the war, were killed in Starachowice, so you heard about that.\nI think the name was - Hania reminded me - Eisenmann (ph) - and Wolfowicz (ph) was\nthe man that was the boss of the laundry where I worked, so Wolfowicz (ph) I think had\ntwo children. They were in camp, you see, he smuggled them in and they lived in the\nback of the laundry or whatever, but I knew of the Wolfowicz (ph) kids. And they\nsurvived the evacuation to Auschwitz, they survived Auschwitz, and everything that\ncame after, and they came back to Poland, and they were killed after the war in Poland.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea why they smuggled the kids into the camp from these places they\nwere being hidden?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I just knew, because they were in a position to get them in, because they\nbribed someone or something. I know that Mr. Wolfowicz (ph) was my boss in the\nlaundry, and his kids - he had two kids - so, I don\u2019t know how many there was - I don\u2019t\nknow, less than ten - and they did survived. They were five-year-old kids.",
        "Q: But how about children your age, young adults?",
        "A: Yeah, they were, they were, some of them survived, down in Israel, of course.",
        "Q: So, the contact that you had during the day - you\u2019re at the laundry most of the day?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, you don\u2019t see your sisters because they\u2019re working elsewhere?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So, do you have friends outside your two sisters?",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, my peers. For example, the girl in the laundry, Rachelka Shacter (ph), she\nwas a very good friend. Then I had my Hania Tenser (ph), she was the one who came\nfrom Israel to testify that she was in the gas chamber, and she was my friend. Yes, I had -\nyou know - they were all kids, but you know, a fourteen, thirteen year old kid can work\npretty well in the laundry, believe me, and that was just as well slave labor as anything.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m going to go back to a question I asked you a long time ago, because you\ninterpreted it somewhat differently than I had intended it. Do you now, when you\u2019re in\nthe laundry, in some sense reap the benefits of having been 1n school with your sister\nteaching you, because you kept learning things? Did these things go through your head?\nDo you replay the books in your head, and poetry?",
        "A: Oh, yes, most of all poetry. Iam absolutely crazy about poetry. And, you know, the\namazing thing is that the emphasis on learning things by rote, by heart, was very strong in\nmy schooling years, and Hania kept on the same way, so I actually remember a whole lot\nof Polish poetry, I remember sections of Shakespeare in Polish, and you know, in the\nhardest of times - to this day I can recite poetry that I wouldn\u2019t even believe that I would.\nThere is a Polish epic, Pan Tadeusz, that of course I must have read a million times now\nalready, but I do read it - it\u2019s one of the greatest works. Anyway, I went to see the movie\nbased on that - it was released about two years ago, by Andrzej Wajda, the director, and\nthey stuck very close to the script and used at least 80% of the poetry as was the epic. I\nwas sitting in the movie with Victor - of course, Victor doesn\u2019t speak Polish, but he\nenjoyed the movie subtitles - and I am reciting with the movie, I am reciting Pan Tadeusz\nbecause I exactly know what\u2019s going to come. And he walks into this room and he looks\naround and he sees the grandfather clock, and he recites this poem about his connection\nto the grandfather clock, and I am going right along with him, and I know one line ahead\nof him all the time. So, those things sustained me, definitely. And I didn\u2019t see it - again,\nit\u2019s a connection, where it\u2019s going to lead me. This was like nourishment; perhaps that\u2019s\nhow I should have put that - that learning for its own sake, if 1t was pleasurable, was the\ngreatest pleasure. So, when you\u2019re down and out, what else but to draw on this something\nthat was so pleasurable. And it was personal, intimate, because you didn\u2019t have to find a\nbook, you didn\u2019t have to rely on the movies or on other people - all you had to do was\nstart reciting in your head that poem - and there were so many, because we were forced to\nmemorize good poetry, really. So, that was, to this day, I absolutely have every piece of\npoetry that I love, I have it now, and I re-read it, strangely enough. I enjoy it and I enjoy\nit and there is no end to the enjoyment, and that could have been part of what I call this\nlifting up the soul. Again, you see, it doesn\u2019t - I\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t\nanswer your question to your satisfaction.",
        "Q: No, no, no, no, no - that\u2019s not what I said. You interpreted it differently; it wasn\u2019t that\nyou didn\u2019t answer it to my satisfaction. It\u2019s just that I had a slightly different intention,\nand it was very interesting to hear where you took it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But perhaps I asked it too early. Asking you now is maybe more appropriate. Is there any\npoem that you recall repeating to yourself a lot there, that you could repeat for us, that\nwas really important?",
        "A: No, no, mostly it was Mickiewicz or Tuwim - I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of him.\nMickiewicz was a 19\" century poet of Polish origin, but Lithuanian, he came out of,\nwhen Lithuania was part of - heavily Polish. But Tuwim was contemporary, and he wrote\nchildren\u2019s poems, and he was a Jew, a Polish Jew. And his poetry was very much taught\nin schools. Mickiewicz, of course, and there was Slowacki, and there were all other\nimportant poets, but they were 18'\"/19\u2122 century poets. Twentieth century poet was Julian\nTuwin, who was a Jew by birth, and every kid knew his poetry. In fact, when our parents\nhad company and they wanted to show off the kid, they would come and say, \u201cHey, hey,\nsay that locomotive poem by Tuwim.\u201d You showed off that because it was such beautiful\npoetry. And, so I have Tuwim, I have him. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t quite agree with the\nway his life turned out, because he sort of - he came to America during the war and then\nwent back to Communist Poland. He had left this . Not that it means anything in\nthe broader sense. He was nevertheless the greatest poet of the 20\"... one of the great,\noutstanding Polish poets of the 20\" century was Julian Tuwim. They\u2019re trying to\nrehabilitate him now, but his poetry lives on, so who cares, whatever the background. So,\nyou know, all of those little poems and big poems would come back, and they gave you a\nsemblance of continuity of something that was, maybe you didn\u2019t lose it yet. If you could\nremember that poem that your mother made you recite at that party, you know, and the\nconnection, you see? And of course, you know, children, you had to curtsey for your\nparents\u2019 friends; you had to curtsey. So, when you came to make a big presentation, she\ncalled you in, you had to curtsey and say the poem, and then would curtsey and walk out.\nSo, if it was possible, which it was, to make the mental connection from the present\nsituation which I found myself in to this thing that was once sort of part of the other life,\nthat was great. And if you call it the thread that sustains you, fine, but that\u2019s what it really\nwas.",
        "Q: Were there any situations where there was a public sharing of poetry or singing in the\ncamp that you remember?",
        "A: Yes, a lot of times, because, as I told you, Polish education required you to know certain\npoems, period. That\u2019s it. So, this is how it was, that if you started, somebody else chimed\nin, somebody else sung. There was a lot of singing; it was good.",
        "Q: In the camp?",
        "A: In the camp, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you sleep with your sisters?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In the same barrack?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So, in the evening, you would be together. And were they able to get in touch with your\nfather more regularly than you?",
        "A: Yes, we saw Father, yes. He slept elsewhere, but he was working in the little office, so\nwe could always see him.",
        "Q: How do you remember him doing?",
        "A: He was doing fine, because we were around. But people told us - people from\nStarachowice who survived the war and Auschwitz, whom we met after the war - they\nsaid that the minute he came to Auschwitz, he was another man. Father, according to\naccounts of other people that knew him, he perished in October, you see, we came to\nAuschwitz at the end of July; he perished in October. They said he aged so, and he\ntotally, he was totally disheartened. He was totally - he felt completely lost. Maybe he by\nthen knew - he could have known about my mother. I don\u2019t know. But then, of course, he\ndidn\u2019t have us anymore. He knew we were somewhere in there, but he didn\u2019t really\nknow. They said that his legs swelled up and he was gone. He perished in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Was he gassed, do you know?",
        "A: Oh, yes, I\u2019m sure.",
        "Q: Do you know about how old he was by the time he got to Auschwitz? Would he have\nbeen in his 50s?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was there a warning that there would be an evacuation at the camp; that you were going\nto be deported out of the camp?",
        "A: Out of Strzelnica camp to Auschwitz? Well, you see, I might as well bring in the fact that\nwe were not evacuated from Strzelnica and Majowka. We were evacuated from a totally\ndifferent camp.",
        "Q: Oh, so describe it.",
        "A: Well, the munitions factory had a siding, you know, because to deliver and take out the\nstuff by train. At a certain time, at a certain point in 1944, in July or so, middle of July,\nwe were resettled to yet another camp, but very near the munitions factory, next to the\nsiding, the railroad siding, and that camp was the last camp in Starachowice from which\nthe evacuation to Auschwitz took place. That is where the break-out was, the rebellion\nand the break-out. That is where we were loaded on the train for Auschwitz, which is not\nStrzelnica and it\u2019s not Majowka, but it\u2019s the third place which I don\u2019t even know if it had\na name, but it was the closest in location physically to the munitions factory because the\nrailroad, the railroad tracks were right there, and that\u2019s where we were loaded to go to\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: And how long were you relocated in that place?",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do you think, days, weeks?",
        "A: No, days, maybe a week or two at most. And this was a transient type of - I can\u2019t even\nsay it was camp. It had barbed wire, or it had a wooden fence, whatever - 1t was\nsurrounded by a fence, and it had guards, guard towers, you see, because that was very,\nthis was so near to the factory that this was really probably war production area anyway,\nbut they had guards, and they had Ukrainians in them. And this is where, and I don\u2019t\nknow, Chris or Hania would remember better how long we stayed, but this was\nabsolutely not a camp that we lived in because by then we didn\u2019t work anymore.",
        "Q: I see. So, both camps were emptied...?",
        "A: ...emptied to the third, into the third. No, even before then, those two camps were\ncombined. You know, I really forgot how the combination went. First it was Strzelnica\nand Majowka, then it was no more Strzelnica, it was only Majowka, and then I think,\nthen it was the third camp, but it was physically another place.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t remember quite the timing of Strzelnica?",
        "A: Strzelnica, no.",
        "Q: Strzelnica turning...?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know. Hania and Chris would probably remember it better. But I do know\nthat we did not go to Auschwitz out of Strzelnica and not out of Majowka, but out of the\nthird place.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re there for a few days, you think...",
        "A: Let\u2019s say a week or so.",
        "Q: A week, and then trains come.",
        "A: Yeah, and they load us on the trains.",
        "Q: And of course nobody announces to you where you\u2019re going.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Now, are you afraid again?",
        "A: The one thing that I absolutely never lost was fear. That is one thing that followed me\nright through the war. Fear was sort of like, like your skin. Skin is part of your body, and\nfear is another aspect of that. And we just, I don\u2019t know that we knew that Auschwitz\nexisted. I didn\u2019t; I don\u2019t know who knew. I just know that when we were being loaded,\nhowever that was arranged, Father\u2019s train, the car on the train, and ours were adjacent,\nmeaning whether his was the last of the men\u2019s wagons and we were the first of the\nwomen\u2019s or the other way around. I don\u2019t know. I just remember that when we arrived in\nAuschwitz, when they unloaded us on the platform, that as soon as the women came out\nof this wagon, we saw the group of men coming out of that one that was adjacent to us,\nand that was the last time we saw him.",
        "Q: How was the trip?",
        "A: That was most horrendous. Horrendous isn\u2019t the word, because it was summertime, you\nknow, it was the end of July 1942... No, what am I saying, it wasn\u2019t \u201942, of course not -\n\"44! We\u2019re talking now, of course, this is the Russian offensive that has started, so the\nGermans are emptying all these labor camps and they are sending people westward. And\nwe of course have no idea how the war is progressing, or at least I don\u2019t. Because I really\nam living on another planet. I just want to survive. I\u2019m full of fear and I\u2019m trying to\nmanage, but other than that, I really don\u2019t have any idea what is happening. The only\nthing is that something bad is happening to the Germans because now there are signs that\nthey are a little scared, you know? So, when we are loaded on those trains, I don\u2019t know\nthat we know that we\u2019re going to Auschwitz or I don\u2019t even know that - I mean, I didn\u2019t -\nI didn\u2019t even know that Auschwitz existed, but I figured if there is a war and the soldiers\nare moving closer, there will be soldiers fighting with soldiers. Maybe they want us out\nof the - you know, this 1s another type of pipe dream kind of thing. There was no water,\nyou know. People were dying. There was shouting for the water, 1t was just horrendous.\nYou know, I always think, was it the fact that I was so skinny that I survived? Really, I\ndidn\u2019t require, you know, I wasn\u2019t hungry like other people, and my body didn\u2019t require\nfuel the way some other people\u2019s bodies required fuel. There could be something to it,\nyou know? So, anyhow, when we arrived in Auschwitz, 1944, I think it was either end of\nJuly or early August. And then we found out in Auschwitz that other camps were being\nevacuated from all over, meaning east of Auschwitz. You know, our camps, our camp -\nMajowka/ Strzelnica - Starachowice was located in central Poland within that industrial\ndistrict, and there were others - there was Skarzysko-Kamienna, there was Radom, there\nwere other camps that were now being all evacuated. And we knew, for example, that the\nRadom transport arrived. And one day we saw my Aunt Rose in Auschwitz, passing by -\nwe were carrying rocks this way and they were carrying rocks the other way - so we\nknew that all these other camps - we didn\u2019t know that Aunt Rosa was alive, but we saw\nher in Auschwitz - so we knew, the word spread, that all these camps were being\nliquidated, so we could figure out something wasn\u2019t going too well for the Germans,\nand...",
        "Q: Before we take a break with the tape, when you arrived in Auschwitz, was it as awful an\narrival as your marketplace experience?",
        "A: Oh, yes, except for me personally, Hania and Krysia were there to protect me. In the\nmarketplace, I was all alone and younger. You see, I\u2019m a little older now, and of course, I\nhave already learned to cope a little. Not that I was a lost soul, no. I was resilient in a\nself-preservation type of way but I wasn\u2019t yet totally what you call clever about things.\nBut, no, when we arrived in Auschwitz, we were the three of us. The interesting thing\nwas, of course, which we didn\u2019t know before but we now know, but most of those\ntransports, the last minute transports of people shipped out of the slave labor camps,\nwhether there was no time or whatever, they were not subject to selection. This is why\nthe five-, seven-year-old kids survived Auschwitz. We were just herded out, put into the\nso-called showers, given, thrown the clothes that they gave us, you know? Our hair was\nchopped off - I didn\u2019t say cut off, I say chopped off - so that we realized that the situation\nwas quite different. Because little children and older women and people were already just\nshoved in all at once, from all over - Skarzysko, from Radom, from Wostrowiecz (ph).",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re going to have to stop now and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: I was just thinking that your middle-childhood years, from 10 to 15, is all during this\nhorrible period. You\u2019re 15 years old when you enter Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite extraordinary to think of that, isn\u2019t 1t? When I asked you about the entrance into\nAuschwitz, was there a lot of beating when you were taken off the railroad car, or was it\nmore quiet? Do you have a recollection of that immediate time?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t, no, the only thing I remember distinctly having seen Father on the platform.\nBut after that, I remember they were rushing us much in the so-called shower room or\nwhatever you call that. And maybe Hania, Anna, would tell you about how she objected\nto being pushed and shoved and screamed at and for that they shaved off her hair,\nwhereas our hair was just chopped off. They grabbed you by the hair, they put the\nscissors to it, and however it came it came, but they didn\u2019t shave your head, they didn\u2019t\ngive you a haircut, they just chopped off some hair, whereas Hania and her friend Irene\nMuller, Irka Muller (ph), who is now Irene Ross, both very tall, Hania was with her and\nobjected to the fact that she was being pushed on and screamed, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to\nme like this.\u201d So, the woman in charge, she was a Czechoslovak woman, she said, \u201cJust\nfor that, Pll show you what I can do.\u201d And she put her on the side there, and they shaved\noff her hair and Irene\u2019s hair - total zero, you know, complete bald - and we burst out\nlaughing, in total hysterics. We thought it was just so funny, because the fun in it was not\nthe fact that the hair was shaved, but because they were both tall and little heads on the\ntop, you know, the pin on top. And it was so grotesque that it really lent itself to absolute\nhilarity in these circumstances, so we just laughed ourselves hilariously silly to tears. And\nwe left that area, as we were all herded out. We left that area with Hania shaved to zero\nand Krysia, Chris, and I just having our hair, as I said, just chopped off however, and...",
        "Q: So, your bodily hair was not shaved. Only...",
        "A: No, I had no bodily hairs. I don\u2019t remember, but I guess not. But we were tattooed right\nthen and there, too.",
        "Q: So, you had your clothes off. You were nude when they cut your hair?",
        "A: I think so. I think so. And we were tattooed, and I really always stress the fact that we\nlined up together for tattooing so that we had consecutive numbers, which really\ncontributed to our survival as a unit, the three of us. Because, you know, not having a\nname, you are always referred as a number, and when they call X number of people for\ndetail or work somewhere, you happen to be in the same unit of numbers, so that was\nlucky.",
        "Q: Do you still have your tattoo?",
        "A: Absolutely yes.",
        "Q: Did you ever think of taking it off?",
        "A: No, not only did I never thought of it, but I was trying - I was absolutely almost forced\ninto doing it, which I very much objected to. You know, during my early years in\nAmerica, I used to work in the summers as a babysitter, as a governess. So, I went to a\nhotel in the Catskills with a doctor\u2019s wife, you know, he was a surgeon - a plastic surgeon\n- and they had two children - one girl was about four and a baby like eight months old.\nAnd the mother used to be there with the two kids in a bungalow on the hotel premises\nand we used to eat in the dining room, but we lived separately, and the husband used to\ncome for the weekends. Well, anyhow, when he discovered I had - I got the job through\nhigh school, through my high school, but that is another story, but an interesting story.\nBut anyhow, I go to this camp, and it was in Wingdale, New York. And of course I had\ncame to meet them, and then the doctor used to come for the weekend, and he noticed my\nnumber. He said, \u201cYou know, I am a plastic surgeon. I\u2019d like to remove this number.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to remove it.\u201d So, he says - he thought - you know, those\nwere my salad (ph) days - and he says, \u201cListen, I will not charge you, you have nothing to\nworry about. I will do a fine job and it won\u2019t cost you a penny. After, you come back to\nNew York, you come to my office and I'll do it for you for free.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\nwant to do it.\u201d And I wouldn\u2019t do it. And he said to me, \u201cWhy would you want to have it?\nWhy on earth would you want to keep it? You\u2019re a young girl. Why on earth would you\nwant to keep it?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I have brown eyes, they\u2019re a part of my body. That\u2019s a\npart of my body, too, and I\u2019m staying with it.\u201d So, I kept it, and of course I never\nregretted it, never.",
        "Q: Was it humiliating to have the tattoo put on? Did it hurt you?",
        "A: Oh, yes it was painful. You know, they pulled on the skin. By the way, we had very\n\u201celegant\u201d numbers, quote-unquote, \u201celegant\u201d, because I know people who got there much\nearlier than we did. They have these horrendous looking numbers - a \u20187\u2019 crooked, an \u20188\u2019\nwas something else. By the time we got there, which was, as the war progressed, it was\nreally toward the end of the war already, they had such fine experience in tattooing that\nour numbers, Hania\u2019s, Krysia\u2019s and mine, are in perfectly beautiful sequence - even,\nreally even - so that we don\u2019t have these numbers that others had on the outside, these\nhumungous - we have these elegant numbers because they had all these - and by the way,\nI have the second serial. My number begins with an \u2018A\u2019 because they ran out of the first\nseries of numbers, and they started an \u2018A\u2019 series.",
        "Q: So, when you get tat-... You\u2019re shaved, you get tattooed, and then the clothes.",
        "A: The clothes were thrown at you. Whatever happens to be, whatever - size does not matter.\nYou get what you got and shift for yourself. If you were a size 5, you get size 27, and if\nyou're size 12, you get size 6, and after that you have to go and exchange with others.\nAnd those were rags basically, rags. I mean you know, stuff - I understand now that they\nwere shipping out to Germany, good clothes and such, so whatever was left in the piles\nwas really second-hand already.",
        "Q: Were they filthy?",
        "A: Actually, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so because I imagine they must have steamed them\nfor lice. There was always vermin in there.",
        "Q: When did you find out that this was Auschwitz and what Auschwitz was? Was it very\nsoon after your arrival?",
        "A: Oh, yes, absolutely, by then there was no hiding from the truth. Because, first of all, you\nsaw the crematories. I think by then there no five crematories left. I think by then,\nbecause you know, some of the crematories were destroyed by whatever means. The\npoint of it is we were not burned. There was no selection for burning or for gassing. We\nwere just brought in as a unit and shipped into Birkenau as a unit, and all the other camps\n- of course, we realized why this was happening. There were just too many camps being\nemptied into Auschwitz to be able to run the enterprise as they did before, with selections\nand such. So that when we came, you could smell - you could see the fire out of the\nchimney. And of course, burning flesh has a very strong odor that is nothing like\nanything else that you know. So, that was unmistakable, the burning of human bodies,\nunmistakable.",
        "Q: Did you know at the time that there were huge numbers of Hungarian Jews being brought\nin?",
        "A: Yes, we discovered that and, you know, my memory of all this is sort of hazy, but I do\nknow that there was a gypsy camp not far from our barracks because they talked about\nthe gypsies, and we heard that the Hungarians were being shipped in, too, at the same\ntime. But you see, this was already very - I don\u2019t know how they brought out people to\nAuschwitz as far as numbers, but I am sure with the German system, the way they run\neverything to the last detail, they probably spaced these transports. Now it was just one\nafter the other, but the Russian offensive was really nearing to Auschwitz. I mean, you\nknow, the Russians stopped at the Vistula River, and that was another political treachery\n(ph), but who knew then that Stalin wouldn\u2019t cross the Vistula, but they were coming.\nThe Russians were coming from the east, so all these camps - we were, after all, located\nnot far from the Vistula, not all that far, so anyhow... I mean, not as near as Krakow or\nother cities that were on the Vistula, but we were within the area that could be contacted\nvery quickly. However, they didn\u2019t because Stalin sat himself down and waited for the\nGermans to finish off the job. So, all these camps that were being emptied, we realized\nthat something was happening from the east. But how much could you know when you\u2019re\nliving behind barbed wires, and now you\u2019re coming here, and you see all these other\ncamps, Radom, and everybody else 1s there.",
        "Q: You were put into a quarantine camp for the first month?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember what barrack it was? Do you have any recollection?",
        "A: No, no, the only thing I remember is that after the war, in 1987, and I was there with\nChris, that we went to see the barrack, so then I knew that was the barrack. But I\nremember the barrack as a barrack in the interior, but if you ask me what number it was\nand to find it in the complex, I couldn\u2019t, but I was there in 1987.",
        "Q: How did you understand what a quarantine camp was? What was that supposed to mean,\n\u201cquarantine barrack\u2019\u201d?",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you, all these fancy words of \u201cquarantine\u201d and all this other thing, you only\nknew that there were all kinds of new horrors coming, so one horror was of this nature\nand one horror was of that nature. Personally, as I told you, I could not figure out what it\nled to or what it led from or how it figured in the larger picture. I didn\u2019t know if they\nmeant to keep us there for a month or for a year or forever or whatever. But having now\nacquired enough experience to see that nothing is certain, that nothing is permanent, that\neverything changes, and it always changes for the worse, because so far in our\nexperience, nothing changes for the better. It was all downhill and by some miracle, we\nmanaged to stay together, which was altogether a miracle, altogether the most\nunbelievable miracle. So, that we knew was a lucky break, that one, but everything else\nwas just pure horror. And this was just another thing, and God only knows what the next\nthing was going to be. And that horrendous smell of burning flesh was really... well, sort\nof like very ominous in the sense that that is maybe after all going to be, you know, the\nfinal, the final, the tail end part of this horrible journey, who knows - we didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do you recall the moment that you found out about the gas chambers?",
        "A: Oh, we were told right away. The old-timers were there, of course. They said, \u201cThey burn\npeople here. They ship them in, they burn them all the time.\u201d Of course, no question!\nHow could you not know? I mean, even if you didn\u2019t know, you saw the flame.\nGenerally, if you drive by the Jersey Turnpike, you see the smoke coming out, whether it\nis acrid smoke or whatever it is, it\u2019s smoke, it\u2019s belching black or white or whatever. This\nwas fire, you see?",
        "Q: Not smoke.",
        "A: Not smoke; this was fire. You saw, 1n the dark of the night, this luminous ball of fire\nagainst the dark sky. It was unmistakable. You couldn\u2019t call it anything else. This was light\nfire. Now, this light fire also had an overpowering stench. And now, here you have the old-\ntimers who tell you this. Now, how much more can you - do you need to figure out what\nwas going on?",
        "Q: So, did they also tell you things to avoid? Did you get clues about how one could survive\nin this thing? That there was a way...?",
        "A: No, no. Because - I don\u2019t remember the sequence of things, but I remember there were\nsome girls who ran away, who escaped from Auschwitz at that time, and they were\nbrought back and they were hung. So, we already knew, you know, like the hanging in\nPoland on the square for the Christians to see when they came out, so we already knew\nthat such tactics lead to other things, that this was just a warning but watch out because\nyou re next.",
        "Q: Did you see the bodies?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You just heard about it?",
        "A: I heard about it.",
        "Q: So, in the first month or two, do you three talk about this situation? Try to figure out...?",
        "A: We talked all the time. First of all, we sleep nine to a bunk. It is very hard to\naccommodate nine people to a bunk, so we had to talk. You have nine people herded into\none place, you have to talk. You talk because at a certain time, you can\u2019t even step down;\nyou have to be up in your bunk. So, obviously some are old-timers - although we are still\ntraveling - so-called traveling, quote-unquote - we are still within the Starachowice group\nbecause we were shipped as a unit, and we were placed as a unit. Of course, we are\nmixed in with others, of course, but we still have some of these people from\nStarachowice with us. And we were nine to a bunk, so all of us couldn\u2019t be all\ngreenhorns; some of them have already previous knowledge of what this place is about\nand what\u2019s happening. So, now there are no secrets; now we know the truth. And I think I\nmyself for the first time am beginning to realize that all these things I was trying to\nexplain away - you know, this is now 1944, and for the last two years, \u201942-\u201944, it is\nalways downhill, it is downhill, it is downhill, but now this could very well be the end of\nthe downhill, but this is more than the imagination will allow. I remember being very\nscared in Auschwitz, very, very scared, because I thought that was the end, I really did.\nBut by that time I think my attitude was a little different, you know? Sort of accepting of\nwhatever was going to happen. Because, you know, by now, we still didn\u2019t know about\nMother, we didn\u2019t know. I mean, everybody could figure out that she didn\u2019t survive, but\nwe didn\u2019t know. And what happened to Father we didn\u2019t know either, so now we\u2019re just\nthe three of us, and whatever awaited us after this we didn\u2019t know, because we had no\nidea where the war was heading, which way. We knew it wasn\u2019t good for the Germans,\nbut that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: Do you have nightmares?",

        "A: Oh, yes!",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: If you were made to carry heavy rocks and then be a skinny kid, you were exhausted!\nToo exhausted not to sleep. Besides, there\u2019s something to be said for being squeezed in\nwith all these bodies. You know, you cannot toss and you cannot scream, because\nsomebody is going to poke you right away and, \u201cHey.\u201d Maybe I had nightmares, but they\ndidn\u2019t allow me to have nightmares because, when you\u2019re squeezed between two other\nbodies, how would you be able to thrash around or yell or scream? Somebody\u2019s going to\ngo, \u201cHey, shut up, you,\u201d or whatever.",
        "Q: Was it quiet in the barrack or was it noisy? Do you remember? Smelly?",

        "A: Oh, yes. No, that was exactly the time; that was exactly the time, inside the barrack, right.\nThat was Aranka. She was the head of the barrack. And you know the latrine was outside.\nTo go to the latrine, you had to have permission. To get permission, and there were only\nX number of people could go at one time so you were allowed in this group of three. So,\nwhatever, I was going to the latrine, and she caught me coming back to the vestibule -\nAranka who was as big as a horse and as fierce looking as the Gestapo themselves. She\nwas a Czech girl, Czechoslovak. And she was wearing these black boots - riding boots -\nand she dragged me over. She says to polish those boots with my spit, and I was so\nterribly offended, but I knew I could pay with my life if I didn\u2019t, because she was so\npowerful and so fat and so big and I was a skinny kid, and one blow from her, that would\nhave been the end. But I was so incensed about it. I remember that I always think about it\nin the sense of how stupid it was for me to get myself so worked up over it. Because from\nwhat I had already experienced and seen, I should have known that this is just one more\nhumiliation, but it isn\u2019t of such great importance that it should make - I cried over it\nbecause, of course, she put her foot up on the stool, and I stood there on my knees\npolishing her boots and spitting and I had very little spit to spit with, and of course she\nwould have killed me. And I felt so humiliated and offended and I never got over it for\nthe longest time. And I knew as I told you that this was out of proportion to the reality. It\nseems, as I survey my war experiences, that always it was that particular instance, it\nwasn\u2019t the general, you know? The specific and personal was the one that stayed with\nme. For having seen all these things and having experienced other people\u2019s horrible\nexperiences right next to me, those other things really count for very little, except that I\ncould really have paid with my life. But it wasn\u2019t so much the fear for my life, but the\nhumiliation that she was not German, you see? I had already accepted that anything that\nhad to do with the Nazis was dreadful and to be avoided, but the source was different. In\nother words, it was coming from a Czech woman that the humiliation was double because\nI had yet not accepted that aside of the Nazis, there were other people who could do that.\nSo, I was just absolutely - it destroyed me. But it really didn\u2019t amount to much. I did\nsurvive it, so... I polished her boots and I\u2019m sure she never knew which one of those ugly\nlooking people I was. So, there were no repercussions to it in a sense.",
        "Q: So, she didn\u2019t take it out on you later?",
        "A: No, because I did do the job, there\u2019s no question. I was down on my knees, and she was\ntowering over me. I tell you, once kick and I could have been gone.",
        "Q: Does this situation in some way remind you of the situation your mother told you about\nwith respect to your father?",
        "A: Absolutely, yes, absolutely, it was exactly the same. And the German said to her, \u201cThese\naren\u2019t gentlemen, these are Jews. And that Father became so humiliated. Of course, he\nwas sweeping the rail station. It was very, very upsetting to him.",
        "Q: Was this Czech woman Jewish?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. Her name was Aranka; everybody was scared to death of her because\nher physical presence was really very... threatening. And she had a very loud voice and\nscreamed a lot. I was always afraid of her, but this is not why I felt humiliated, I think. It\nwas because she was not German. Because by then I started realizing that it is not the\nNazis only that I have to fear; I have found a new source of fear that I have to watch out\nfor, and I could only handle that much.",
        "Q: It gets bigger and bigger.",
        "A: Yeah, the circle, so to say, 1s getting enlarged, and now I have other things to worry\nabout, because just because she\u2019s not a Nazi doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t kill me, \u2018cause she\ncan, and get away with it.",
        "Q: We'll have to take a break to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "Q: Let me go back to Majowka for a moment, because I realize that - I wonder if there are\nany comparable incidents for you in Majowka - not necessarily of being humiliated, but\nmaybe humiliated or beaten, or were there people that you were as afraid of in Majowka\nas you were in Auschwitz?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t really remember, but I do know that I felt - probably, I would guess I\nwould have felt less fear in Majowka than in Auschwitz because Majowka was still\nStarachowice and Father was still on the premises and it was really hometown, my\nhometown, even though there was no semblance to life or home or anything, this was the\nplace that was a familiar - not the camp, but the town was a familiar town. Auschwitz\nwas a totally different situation, where everything was threatening from Day 1. The\nmixture of fatherless; the total terror being surrounded by electrical barbed wire; by a\nsystem in place - you know, I think Starachowice camps were run sort of ad hoc, if you\nknow what I mean. Run it as well as you can, and if you can\u2019t, then shoot a few and kill a\nfew and run it. This was organized murder, planned, executed and otherwise set up to the\nlast detail. And then you get thrown into a situation of different nationalities, so you are\nbeginning to understand the scope of this entire drama - it\u2019s not a drama - of this entire\nepic is much larger. It isn\u2019t a little Starachowice slave labor camp that is kept to produce\nwar machinery, where just soldiers fight each other. This is another aspect of something\nthat is not yet even known or comprehended or - it doesn\u2019t seem to serve a purpose. You\nsee, in Starachowice, you could always rationalize: \u201cThey have to keep these slave\nlaborers; otherwise, they cannot win the war. If they don\u2019t produce the cannon shells, the\nwar cannot be won, or whatever. They cannot fight the war.\u201d So, however you slice it,\nthese people are not expendable because somebody has to produce war material. In\nAuschwitz, there\u2019s no such reasoning available to you because you realize this place is\nlike a dead end. It has no function as far as doing something for any reasonable kind of an\nend. It doesn\u2019t produce war material. It doesn\u2019t do anything to fight the Germans... er...\nto help the Germans to fight the war. It houses people who are getting killed. Nobody is\ndoing anything except stupid things - if anything, cutting marshes and, like Sisyphus,\ncarrying back and forth the rocks from here to there. We saw our Aunt Rose from\nRadom. One day we are on the line carrying the rocks here and she was going with the\nrocks there and we waved to her. We didn\u2019t know she was in Auschwitz. So, you begin to\nunderstand, even as I was beginning now to more or less mature into this reality of what\nit was, that this is another story all together. This is absolutely the end of the line for not\njust Starachowice people and the Jews. It\u2019s the mixture people - you get Czech people\nand they brought in the transport from Salernjica Grise (ph) and all kinds of people who,\nfor all kinds of reasons who have nothing to do with punishment. So, that\u2019s when it\nbecomes obvious that that is another thing to contemplate. So, basically, a place like\nAuschwitz, where you do not produce, cannot be explained away. It must be confronted,\neven for somebody as - somebody who tries so hard to dismiss certain things, meaning,\n\u201cWell, you know, tomorrow is another day, and this isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d But it 1s. It is. Now you\nknow it is so bad. And, you know, we still don\u2019t know that Father perished, we don\u2019t\nknow that yet. But the ambiance, and the work that is not work, and the food that isn\u2019t\nfood, and the constant roll calls, and the threats if you don\u2019t show on roll call everybody\nelse gets killed and all this, this has another dimension. And this is when, I mean, you\nsee, I have already learned to live with fear as part of - fear that could at least be used to\nmotivate me to look out and to watch out, to see that I don\u2019t become a burden to my\nsisters and to see that I can maneuver somehow through. But here, there 1s just somehow\n- things are cut off when we come to Auschwitz because you don\u2019t see anything to justify\nyour being there. \u201cWhy do they want me here? Over there, they needed the laundry, but\nhere they don\u2019t need anything. They\u2019re just feeding you for nothing.\u201d Which is another\nthing that I understood by then: you cannot be fed for nothing - whatever feeding that\nmeant - but if you are fed, that means they permit you to live, and if they permit you to\nlive, that means they have to use you for whatever you that have. But here, there is\nnothing to do. I mean, it has no connection to all the things that you have already figured\nout, that I have already figured out. So, I realized then that this would really be the end\nfor us. But I still didn\u2019t think that I would have to decide how to get out of it. I felt Krysia\nand Hania would really protect me. So, whatever happens, with three of us together. But\nthat was a dark hour; those were really dark hours in Auschwitz, the first period, you\nknow. Of course, it was getting colder, and after the quarantine we were sent to cut\nmarshes and it was getting much colder. We were standing in water. And it was\nphysically getting to be - not that it was demeaning. Nothing was demeaning anymore. It\nwas just the physical hardship was beginning to creep in.",
        "Q: What were you wearing on your feet?",
        "A: I think we were wearing wooden shoes, and that was bad.",
        "Q: So, you were probably blistering up again.",
        "A: Yes, and you know, working in the marshes, we were in wetness always. And this is by\nnow probably October. You know, it gets chilly in Poland. October is a very chilly\nmonth.",
        "Q: Did you know about the uprising and the blowing up of the gas chambers in October?",
        "A: Yes, the word got around. I didn\u2019t know all the details, but I knew there was an uprising,\nyes. Because, you see, we were now mixed in with all the other - the people who were\nlonger and longest and we were the shorter and there were others the shortest. You know,\nso this was already - we arrived in, let\u2019s say, August, early August, and this is October,\nand meanwhile others came after us, but there were now other people who came two\nyears before us. So, we were getting pretty - and nine people on the - you know, you\ncould talk to your heart\u2019s content, because outside they wouldn\u2019t allow it maybe, but in\nthe privacy of your nine people\u2019s perch, you can exchange information.",
        "Q: How did you notice the way people were relating to each other? I mean, this 1s a situation\nof enormous deprivation, let alone terror and fear. When you think about the barrack, did\nyou see people fighting with each other, or screaming at each other, or stealing?",
        "A: Yes, definitely, yes, but I didn\u2019t experience any of it. I don\u2019t know, I really always talk\nabout it, that human kindness is what I have actually depended on. That I have -\nSomehow, people have always shown me a certain kind of deference - not deference\nbecause of anything that I represent, in fact, because I was skinny and undernourished\nand a poor little skinny kid. So, everybody was taking pity on me, you know, so I always\nfelt no matter where I went, there was always somebody taking pity on me to do this or to\ndo that or to console me or whatever. We never had situations where we had to fight, but\nthere were people in the barracks absolutely who fought. I mean, people would kill for a\npiece of bread. And people would... But, you know, I always have this habit in me to\nanalyze things, why would... \u201cWell, maybe the Greek people, they understand things\ndifferently.\u201d I was yet to grow up to understand that people are just people. You can\ncome from the North Pole or the South Pole or anywhere in between. It\u2019s still the same\npeople and it\u2019s exactly... The only thing is that in such unusual circumstances, different\npeople reveal their character in a different way, so that some people who personify\ngoodness become even better than goodness personified. Others who have the beast in\nthem become even more beastly. You could see that among the Germans as well - those\nwho turned a tender head when they could see something wasn\u2019t exactly according to the\nrule, and those who just waited for you to step out of the line-up two inches because they\nwere ready to kill, and they were ready, and you stepped out and that was it. But those are\nall musings on a psychological kind of a reality that, in my own little world in those days\n- I could always depend on the Starachowice people who were still around, that I knew.\nAnd we were still around, mixed with them. And then there were others who were also\nriddled with fear. And then there were others that I always felt that I didn\u2019t want to be\nnear - I mean, prisoners, you know? This was a world of its own, but a reflection of a\nbigger world, I guess, which is that human beings just are about the same everywhere, it\u2019s\nthe circumstances that bring out in you whatever it is that you have in you.",
        "Q: Did anyone ever surprise you, someone you thought was a good person turned out in that\nsituation to be very difficult or harsh?",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember those things really. I\u2019m sure if I thought about it, I probably would dig\nit out somewhere in the recesses of my mind. But at this point, no, I couldn\u2019t off-hand\nthink of anybody, but I do know that, speaking in generalities, I could tell you that people\nalways took pity on me and were nice to me. That, I mean, I don\u2019t know how else to put\nthat. There was something about people that made them look after me.",
        "Q: So you never found a circumstance where people actually resented the fact that you were\nso young and still survived? Women who might have been older and had lost...?",
        "A: No, quite the opposite.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Quite the opposite. Maybe I reminded them of their kid. Whatever it was, but it was quite\nthe opposite. And I always said to myself it\u2019s because I look like that. And I never fought\nmy way to be first in line or first to get food. I always got sort of behind, I think. That\u2019s\nvery strange when I think about it, but that\u2019s how it was. I did survive thanks to Chris and\nHania, but I also survived thanks to the goodness of other people. There\u2019s no question\nabout it. That absolutely is a fact.",
        "Q: Did you ever get depressed during these first few months in Auschwitz?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, and I\u2019Il tell you why. I was so preoccupied with survival. First of all, I was filled with\nfear. And out of the fear came the fact that I\u2019ve got to manage. And you cannot let\nyourself - not that you can\u2019t - I didn\u2019t - I couldn\u2019t - I just - whatever it was, whether I\nwouldn\u2019t allow myself or whether I knew that it wouldn\u2019t lead anywhere. The fact was\nyou had to face what it was and manage. And that was what took up - you can\u2019t be\ndepressed. Because depressed means tomorrow they put a bullet through your head.",
        "Q: Did you see many depressed people?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I had already analyzed this before. I think older people had a harder time than\nyounger kids. And I noticed this after the war, too, when we came to America. People\nwho already lived a life, you know? People who had lived, who were married or\nwhatever. They were forever probably, I don\u2019t know, grieving for what - I mean, I didn\u2019t\nhave time to grieve because I didn\u2019t live yet. I didn\u2019t live yet, and all I knew was I had to\nwatch out. That was just to sum it up in a very plain way. I had to watch out. And other\nthan that, depressed - I don\u2019t that that was even a concept that I could really even know\nwhat it was about. I just knew that had to stay on the mark, you know? Not to allow\nmyself to do what is not supposed to be done, and not to allow myself to be called into a\nplace that I knew would be trouble. And that was it. And that was - you know, I think\nwhen prisoners are in prison who break out of a prison, I think that\u2019s how they spend\ntheir days, thinking forever how to break out. I had no idea how to break out, and I\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t attempt it. But the idea of how to stay on the mark, it was a total\npreoccupation, which, of course, included how to survive on the meager food. It wasn\u2019t\njust the fear that could get you; it was the lack of food. And don\u2019t forget, I was a growing\nchild and did not get proper nutrition. Other people required were hungrier than I because\nmy body didn\u2019t require much, or maybe I was stupid to think that, but I really did not - I\nwasn\u2019t driven to insanity by hunger, because I was very hungry but my body tolerated it.\nSo, you see, this idea of depression, I don\u2019t know that I knew the meaning of it, because\nlife was too busy surviving. And in any way of pushing my way or whatever; just\nminding my person. And that\u2019s about all I can tell you about depression. I will tell you\n100% it was a totally foreign concept to me, if I even knew what it meant - I probably\ndidn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Do you have vivid recollections of the food?",
        "A: Yes. Pll tell you what, I used to use... Il tell you now, because Victor, my husband\nVictor, loved turnips. When we got married, he said, \u201cOh, I\u2019d love for you to cook\nturnips.\u201d And I said, \u201cOne thing I\u2019m going to tell you right now,\u201d because you know he\u2019s\nAmerican-born, three generations. And I said, \u201cOne thing - I\u2019d cook anything and\neverything. Please don\u2019t ask me to cook turnips.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s a very\ngood food.\u201d And I said, \u201cListen, I have an association with the smell of turnips and I will\nnever get over it, not ever. Please don\u2019t ask me to cook it. I will not cook it. If you want\nturnips, you will have to go to a restaurant.\u201d Because, in Auschwitz, the only thing you\never got was turnips in a soup. The turnips, of course, were never washed, so you had the\nsand and the peel, and the turnip. If you found a piece of turnip, it was lucky. But the - I\ncan\u2019t say fragrance. That\u2019s too fancy. But the smell of the turnip is so deeply ingrained\nwith me with that period, that I truly cannot stand - not the sight of turnip, I wouldn\u2019t\nknow, because it looks like a sweet potato. If you cook it properly and away from me,\nmaybe I wouldn\u2019t know until I tasted it. But absolutely that is what remained - the\nbusiness with the turnips. That was food. I think they gave out coffee once - Coffee with\na capital \u2018C\u2019 - that was the water with a little chicory in it, I guess, and a piece of bread\nand the turnip soup. That was food.",
        "Q: Did you ever have margarine on your food, or...?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t remember. I just know that there were other people who were\nalways hungrier than I was. I was very, very hungry, but I was not as hungry - I think\nHania was always hungrier than I was. She was always tall, very tall, I mean, as Polish\nwomen go, I mean, as people from Poland go, even Jewish, she was very tall, and I was\njust a skinny kid, but Hania was tall and I think her body required more food than mine.",
        "Q: So, you think she suffered more than you?",
        "A: I think so, and I knew people who really, truly suffered from hunger more than I. I used\nto dream about food. You see, you asked me whether I had nightmares. No. You know\nwhat I dreamt about? I dreamt about the table settings my mother used to put out. My\nmother used to love to serve elegantly. I love to remember that. And I remember this\nparty and I remember the settings. I remember the food that was on it, but the settings, I\nwas obsessed with the settings, in my dreams, in my recollections of home. So, that was\nreally, that was part of getting fed.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019m going to take you back, just because you mentioned this, talk about being\nstimulated to go back for a moment to another time. Chris, when she talked about the first\nnight that you came back after you had left town when the war started, and you came\nback. The first meal back home, she claims that your father said, \u201cWe are going to set the\ntable with a tablecloth and a formal setting,\u201d even though you had very little food. You\ndo remember that?",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite extraordinary.",
        "A: Yes, as a matter of fact, as time went on, and we would always have proper settings and\nthere was not much to eat - a boiled potato - because that kept a semblance of a life. But,\nof course, in Auschwitz you could dream about it. I mean, Mother used to set beautiful\ntables - I don\u2019t mean during the war. But you know, I even dreamt about sugar cookies,\nthose sweet... sweet... beet...",
        "Q: Sugar beet?",
        "A: Yes, sugar beet cookies, because when she learned to bake that during the war, I even\ndreamt about that, and that\u2019s quite a leap from looking at an elegant table.",
        "Q: Do you remember people having conversations about food?",
        "A: Oh, all the time, all the time, all the time people used to talk about food.",
        "Q: And what kind of a conversation was it? Did people exchange recipes?",
        "A: Yes, they talked about recipes. They talked about what they saw in display windows. If\nthey happened to be from the same town, \u201cOh, you remember, this pastry that had this\ndisplay of every day fresh...\u201d Whatever. Absolutely, all the time.",
        "Q: Now, how did that function for people? I do know one survivor felt like \u201cwe ate with our\ntalk\u2019, or something. It was as if the talk was a substitute.",
        "A: It was.",
        "Q: But it didn\u2019t hurt more or make you more hungry\u201d?",
        "A: No, [ll give you an analogy. When I cook, you know, I like to cook, I used to cook\nfancier because now we\u2019re eating all this other simpler stuff. But in the days when I was\ncooking, and I would have a party, whatever, I would have no time to eat, and I was so\nhungry, hungry, but I had to cook, so I said, \u201cWell, let me first start cooking.\u201d And by the\ntime I was done cooking all these French dishes with the wine and all, I was so satiated\nfrom the fragrance, this beautiful fragrance of the food, that by the time I was done with\ncooking, I really didn\u2019t need to eat. I definitely didn\u2019t need to eat because the idea plus\nthe fragrance, the wonderful wine cooking, would fill me. That is analogous to the fact\nthat, if you, perhaps, if you talked of food that was really part of another setting, and I\ndon\u2019t mean food just for the eating of it, but for the sustenance and the other thing that\ncomes with food, that that could fill you. Not for long, because eventually, five, six hours\nlater you still would wake up hungry and famished, but that is the only analogy that I\ncould think of. And it is true. It is absolutely true because people were talking all the time\nabout food.",
        "Q: And you, too?",
        "A: Yes, yes. You know, people were describing this or these people talking about ptishye\n(ph), which were like profiteroles au chocolat, so you remember, and then it filled you.\nSo, I guess there has to be something to it if so many people did it.",
        "Q: Did you see a lot people smoking, women smoking?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think there were any cigarettes. I remember that during the war they used to\nroll in a piece of paper and I don\u2019t even think they had tobacco; I think they had crushed\nleaves or something. My father was a smoker, though, but not my mother. Women, I\ndon\u2019t remember that women smoke. Or maybe they did, but certainly not in camp.",
        "Q: No, that\u2019s what I meant: did you ever see women using cigarettes to barter for other\nthings?",
        "A: Oh, to barter, yes, not to smoke.",
        "Q: Oh, to barter?",
        "A: To barter, absolutely. Let\u2019s say you wanted a piece of bread. So, you sold a scarf to get a\nturnip, then you exchange the turnip for cigarettes, and then you barter the cigarettes for\nbread. You see how that went? You were a non-smoker. The cigarette was a means of\ngetting the bread in a circuitous way.",
        "Q: So, cigarettes were very valuable?",
        "A: Very, but the final object was bread. How you arrived at it is another story, but cigarettes\nwere very often involved. It wasn\u2019t because you smoked them for yourself or smoke...\nWho eventually ended up with the cigarettes, I have no idea.",
        "Q: Did you ever barter?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But your sisters must have.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know. This is out of my hand.",
        "Q: I think we\u2019ll break for the tape at this point, because I have a longer question to ask.\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",
        "Q: I want to go back again to Majowka because I neglected to ask something, and it may\nmake a connection to Auschwitz, I don\u2019t know. Was there sexual abuse of women in\nMajowka that you know about?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: In none of the camps?",
        "A: I really, I don\u2019t know. If there was, I am not aware of it at all.",
        "Q: So, you were not afraid of any kind of sexual...?",
        "A: No, how could I be, considering who I was and how I looked and who, I guess, would\nlook at me? That was never, ever... Later on, when we were past Retzow and after the\nLiberation, that\u2019s a story further on, when we were inside of Germany and the Russians\ncame, and we were warned that they rape women, so we should run away and we should\nnot stay there. That\u2019s as far, but, but even by then, I didn\u2019t ever think of it. The only thing\nthat I was afraid of in - unless other women experienced it in Auschwitz - that if you were\nsick and had to stay behind on the bunk, and you couldn\u2019t go to the outside, to work, like\nin the marshes like we did, that they would come and drag you out and they would do\nwith you what they wanted to do with you, whatever that meant, but I guess that meant\nprobably more of being killed than... Yes, but you see after the Auschwitz detail left, and\nbarrack had to be emptied, they went through the barracks to see if anyone was hiding\nbecause sick people who couldn\u2019t make it to the roll call... So if they found you, they\ntook you whenever they took you, but that was never, ever an issue, not with me.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day when Chris was taken out of the barrack and told to take her\ntwo sisters, when you are given this, what ends up being a very protected job?",
        "A: You mean in Auschwitz? Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Can you describe that day?",
        "A: Well, in fact, somebody just reminded me that Chris and Hania actually were asked for\nthe jobs and I wasn\u2019t. I was going to be left behind. No, this was an opening in - maybe\nI'll sort of put a frame around it - We are now in Auschwitz since, let\u2019s say, early August.\nWe have been in quarantine and we have worked in the marshes and it\u2019s getting very\nmuch colder, very much, because winter is setting in. There is a detail of women that is to\nbe sent to a place where they sort clothes that is left behind by political prisoners, not\nJews, not Jews. We don\u2019t yet know why or how, but they request, I think, thirty women\nor whatever to be sent there. So Krysia and Hania are picked for the detail, and I am not\nto be in the detail because I am small. So, somebody intervened on my behalf and she\nsaid, \u201cShe is a hard worker and she\u2019s very smart. She would be very good.\u201d So, instead of\nthirty, they let go thirty-one. And we arrived... The first week, we went to work and\ncame back to the barrack, or maybe the first two weeks. I don\u2019t remember. But in the\nbeginning, we went there and then came back. What we found out is that the women at\nthat job, that\u2019s still Auschwitz property, except this is a sort of a separate unit - that the\nwomen, political prisoners, were somehow involved in the Polish underground or they\nwere in cahoots or whatever, so they were shipped out. So, now, they didn\u2019t want any\nmore Polish women Christians; they wanted the safer type, which is from the Jewish\ncamp. So, again, as I said, I don\u2019t know if it was a week or two weeks or three weeks -\nwhatever it was, originally we went there and back, there and back at night. Eventually,\nwe didn\u2019t go back to the barracks in Birkenau; we stayed there. And that was a Heaven\nsent. First of all, 1f got cold outside. We didn\u2019t have to go to the marshes. Second of all,\nwe were dressed now properly; you see, because we were next to those piles of clothes,\nso we could pick what we had, what we could wear. And now it was getting colder, so\nshoes were very important - very. So, we had warmer clothing, better shoes, and we\nworked at that detail, and these women were a very interesting group. They were all very\nintelligent, and they had real political connections. Some of them - we discovered one of\nthem, Christina Jevulsha (ph), that she was Jewish actually, but she was a Polish political\nprisoner, passing for a Christian. Anyhow, we worked at that detail up to the evacuation\nof Auschwitz, the death march, and that really saved our life because we were already\ngetting terribly run down from the outdoor work in the marshes, you see, and now it was\ngetting worse because the winter was coming. And because we worked in that place -\nprobably two months or so - and we slept indoors and we worked indoors, and we were\nwearing better clothes. So when the death march, the evacuation of Auschwitz took place,\nwe walked out on the death march wearing proper clothes, meaning warm clothes for\nwinter, and our health was restored because we didn\u2019t work outdoors, and I think the food\nwas a little better, too, although I do not remember exactly what the feeding was, how\nthey - it was institutional food, and it was doled out, but 1t probably was a little more than\nthe turnip soup with the sand in it. And that - you know, it seems, in that whole saga of\nthis war experience, it seems that there were already a little - there was a little interval\nthat allowed us a little breathing space which restored the soul and the body before we\nwould face the other horror. So, luckily, that stretch of time - which wasn\u2019t more than\nprobably two months - allowed us to really, by not working outdoors, not to really come\ndown with whatever, you see.",
        "Q: Did it surprise you that, in the context of Auschwitz, there would be kommandos that\nwould not have selections, that you really were not only protected from the elements, but\nprotected from what Auschwitz was?",
        "A: Yes, very much. But, you see, this was such an exceptional setting which was totally\nstrange to us. The clothes of political prisoners were hung up, numbered. If a political\nprisoner died, the stuff had been packed and sent to the family. If a political prisoner was\ntransferred, the clothes traveled after them. We were engaged in packing. And of course,\nHeaven help you if you stole something or took a thread out of it. And the fact remains\nthat I couldn\u2019t imagine that a thing like that existed. Send the clothes of that prisoner\nback to the family? I still don\u2019t understand it in the scheme of the genocide, of the Nazi\ngenocide, why that was done. I mean, these were Christian, obviously, but what was the\nimportance of sending the clothes back to the families? After all the harassment and the\ninhumanity that they have shown the human beings, that they should be concerned about\nclothes being... I just, it doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. But luckily for us, that was the case. And\nso I learned to pack. But that was, it was good because we were in a more civilized\nsetting, to begin with. These Polish women were very good. They were very intelligent\nand there was very little of that animosity, the Polish-Jewish type, no, this was rather...",
        "Q: These were also old-timers who remained there. They had been there awhile.",
        "A: Yes. I think most of them were shipped out. I think thirty or thirty-one were shipped out.",
        "Q: But there was a group that was still there?",
        "A: Yes, somebody had to be left behind to show the newcomers. But I do know that they\nwere in touch with other Polish prisoners, but, of course, we never were aware of really,\nof what was going on. But I do know now that they had contact with the Polish\nunderground.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how come Hania and Chris were chosen out of all the women in\nthe barrack?",
        "A: Yes, the woman who did help us wrote a book about it. She liked us, so writes in the\nbook that we were not the pugnacious type, and she noticed that other people knew how\nto fight their way out and way in.",
        "Q: Who is she?",
        "A: Felicia Hyatt, Felicia Berlant Hyatt (ph). She was a scribe in the barrack, and she took a\nliking to us. And she, when the request came for people, she picked us, and she was the\none who was instrumental in my being attached to this detail. And she wrote not a very\nnice chapter, it\u2019s in her book, it\u2019s called Short Calls...something Calls, what 1s it...Close\nCalls. And so she was instrumental in that she took a liking to us, she said they were\nintelligent girls and we didn\u2019t know how to fight our way out so, whatever. She says that\nin the book. So, anyhow, that\u2019s how we ended up there, and that was a lifesaver.",
        "Q: So, then there\u2019s going to be an evacuation of Auschwitz.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you have - I don\u2019t know how to use the word - to stay, or to go?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No choice.",
        "A: No, the only choice we were given to others who did stays, was like my friend Hannah\nTenser from Israel, who was left in the gas chambers because they ran out of gas, or other\npeople who were too sick to move; they were left behind as refuse. But we were just\nmarched out like everybody else. But we were lucky that we were dressed well because it\nwas January and it was cold. So, I don\u2019t know that we would have made it. Maybe we\nwould have - other people did. But it helped to have good shoes and to have good clothes.",
        "Q: Did you have gloves?",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: Hat?",
        "A: Yes. We had access to the piles of clothing that they wanted... You know, when we got\nthere, they said take off everything you have on and go pick something that fits you - not\nfrom the prisoners but from the Jewish property. So, we had shoes to fit and clothes to fit\nand it was warm, because we were there toward, you know, in the winter.",
        "Q: Yes, it was January 18th.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you leave Birkenau and walk toward Auschwitz I, or do you have any recollection\nwhere you went?",
        "A: No, I only know that we went on a march, and I only know that I completely lost my\nmind. And I fell asleep while walking. I was sleepwalking. I absolutely fell asleep, and\nChris and Hania were dragging me. And the whole march is one - it\u2019s not a nightmare,\nit\u2019s completely obliterated except for what I remember: the snow was on the ground, we\nwere marching down a country road or whatever, with dark trees on each side and snow\nin the middle, and it seemed like a place - an enclosure. So, I was walking and they were\ndragging me, but I was dead asleep, totally. And I always talk about it, when, every now\nand then, they would stop everybody to relieve himself, and Chris and Hania would squat\ndown and tell me to relieve myself, but I wouldn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t here; I was in the\nother reality, so that - it\u2019s true, and so finally...",
        "Q: Were you actually sleeping?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: This is an 18-mile walk...",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: ...to Gleiwitz . And you were sleeping?",
        "A: It was to Gletwitz? I didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s where we went, right, I didn\u2019t know. Gliwice\nnow, right. And I didn\u2019t know where we were walking, and I have no recollection except\nfor this enclosure, white snow and the trees.",
        "Q: On the one hand, you say that you were dressed well, and you clearly felt better than you\nhad two months prior, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So, what\u2019s this sleeping about?",
        "A: I have no idea. I walked as much as I could and the rest I slept. I know one thing which I\nam very proud of. When we got to a certain big barn with where to stay overnight, and I\nmust have been terribly clumsy or horribly tired, and I wasn\u2019t moving right, and a\nGerman came and knocked me in my face - this is the second time, by the way. I once got\nhit in Auschwitz like this - with a ring; he was wearing a big signet ring, and he knocked\nme, and I fell right down at the barn door, and everybody else was chased into the barn. I\nhad the presence of mind when I woke up, when they started blowing whistles for\neverybody to get up, I had the presence of mind to stand by the door, and found Krysia\nand Hania as they came out. But that was...One day I have to have this made to...I have\nto account for it, how it came about that I slept through this march. At least half the way I\nslept through.",
        "Q: And also how to account for your two sisters having the strength to hold you for that\nlong.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. They were pushing me, you know. They were pushing me\nand talking to me and I kept sleeping, and I truly don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So, you think that you were sleepwalking.",
        "A: Not sleepwalking, I was just sleeping. I do remember that I never thought of the place\nwhere I was as I was as the place I was in.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: I thought that was somewhere - because, the dark skies - we walked at night - and the\ndark trees and the white bottom. So, I\u2019m now in an enclosure. I\u2019m not outdoors. You see,\nI am not outdoors. I am somewhere in an enclosure, walking down. But how that jives\nwith the reality, that I\u2019ve never figured out, but that was a fact.",
        "Q: Did they try to wake you?",
        "A: No, they just dragged me. I mean, there was no reason, I mean, to wake me, so if I\nopened my eyes - I probably had my eyes open, but I was sleeping. I was really very\nmuch asleep. Much of the trip, I was asleep, until we reached Gleiwitz, was it?",
        "Q: And then you were on...",
        "A: ...on the train, yeah, they were in open cars, and the snow was falling, that I remember\nYeah, because by the time we reached Ravensbrick, I was awake, having slept myself\nout on the train. You know, we sat in open cars, so the snow was falling, and we ate the\nsnow off our coats, so that between the fresh air and not having to walk and the snow,\nwhich was moisture, I came to. And when we got to Ravensbriick, I knew, finally I saw\nthe sign \u201cRavensbriick\u201d\u2019. I did read it; I did see the sign. So I knew we were in another\nplace, not that place that was an enclosure.",
        "Q: [laughs] That\u2019s very interesting. Did you think you were going to die?",
        "A: Um, many times, but not at this particular - I mean, by then I realized everything sort of\nwas a chance, you know? Chancy, things were chancy, things were too chancy and all\naround. So, if I was going to die, that means that\u2019s what came up. Because there was no\nplanning, you know, there was no planning, there was no decision making on that score.\nIt\u2019s just how the wind carried you. If you were too exhausted and your legs were swollen\nand you fell by the wayside, that was the end. But it wasn\u2019t that you planned what I\u2019m\ngoing to do ten days later, nothing. You just went with the event, went with the flow, as\nthey say.",
        "Q: So, none of you - neither of you - got sick in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Krysia was sick, yes, Chris was sick one time. I forget what was her... her legs? No, I\nforgot. She was sick, and then she got better. You\u2019d have to ask her, but I do remember\nshe was sick, yes. But, you see, on the death march, I wasn\u2019t sick. I was just over-\nexhausted or whatever. And you see, I always talk about the fact that I was skinny, and I\nwasn\u2019t hungry, but maybe my body was growing and required more - maybe it didn\u2019t\nrequire food but it required rest. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a mystery.",
        "Q: When you arrived in Ravensbriick, somebody made a decision - I don\u2019t know if it was\nHania or Chris - undoubtedly it wasn\u2019t you...",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: ...because you claim you never made any decisions - to say that you were Christian, and\nto take the name Gorska as the last name.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember that?",
        "A: No, but I do know - I know that it happened, but I don\u2019t know how it came about or\nwhere or whatever.",
        "Q: But you do remember that that\u2019s how you were known?",
        "A: Yes, because Ravensbrick, as you know - this is about the end of January or so, early\nFebruary - and Ravensbrick was so overrun with people. All these camps that were first\nevacuated from Poland into Germany, and then from Germany and Poland into - they\nwere just shoving them in. They put up tents in Ravensbriick; there were no more\nbarracks available. There were tents. So that it really, you were so, now - now we were\ncompletely disconnected from the original group. We were still traveled - when we were\nin Auschwitz we were very much with the group - but because we were not evacuated\nwith the Starachowice people, we came there with another group, and then we got mixed\nin with all kinds of nationalities and people camps that you never heard of and that you\ndid hear of and so on. So, it didn\u2019t matter who you were. You could have told them you\nwere Roosevelt\u2019s daughter, you know, for that matter. You could have picked out\nsomething out of the blue moon, or King Farouk\u2019s first wife, whatever, you see? So, if\nHania said that or Krysia said that, it must be so. But, as I told you, it wasn\u2019t my decision.",
        "Q: How horrible was it in Ravensbrtick?",
        "A: Very bad - it was the worst.",
        "Q: Worse than Auschwitz? Why?",
        "A: Because it was disorganized. Not that it was disorg-... It wasn\u2019t in any way planned to\ncontain the number of people that were shipped in. It was in no way organized with a\nplan for the future, even, because the war was now turning, you know, the war effort of\nthe Allies was now taking shape. So, that the Germans, whatever they were up to, knew\nonly themselves, but the fact 1s that a place like Ravensbriick that had all these people\nshipped in - and maybe the decision wasn\u2019t yet made what to do with that, with these\npeople, I don\u2019t know - but the fact remains that the camp was overrun. We stayed in a\ntent. There were no more people possible to squeeze into the barracks. You can imagine\nthey accommodated you now in the Grand Hotel now, in the tent, because, I mean, this\nwas beyond any setting, especially since they always were so organized in the - their\ngenocidal plan included every detail on down the line, and this was, of course, already\nout of their hands. So, that was rough; that was bad. The food was - no food and no place\nto stay in, and just chaos.",
        "Q: All right, you haven\u2019t taken - been able to clean yourself for days...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: SO...",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I think we used snow, or something like this. That could very well be.\nBecause we ate snow, and we probably cleaned ourselves with snow, too.",
        "Q: And did the registration include giving you a new number?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: So, you kept the same number?",
        "A: Frankly, I don\u2019t even think they registered us. I mean, if you consider what was\nhappening at the time, with the influx of the people. I really don\u2019t remember, I truly, I\ndon\u2019t, but it was so chaotic that I can\u2019t imagine that they would still be able to count or\nwhatever.",
        "Q: Did you have a red stripe down your back from Auschwitz? A painted red stripe? Or did\nyou have clothes that didn\u2019t have that?",
        "A: Uh, no, not from Auschwitz. Later on I had the \u201cX\u201d\u2019, white \u201cX\u201d on my coat, up front and\nin the back.",
        "Q: From Retzow\u2019\u201d",
        "A: I think it was from Retzow, yes. It was a white enamel \u201cX\u2019\u2019, big \u201cX\u2019\u2019, right down from the\nshoulder down on both sides. But my recollection of Ravensbrick - I don\u2019t know how\nlong we were there. Ten days? A week? Not long. But it was total chaos.",
        "Q: Were people dying?",
        "A: Yes, in fact, we have a friend from Israel whose mother we saw in the melee of people.\nWe saw out of nowhere. Mrs. Linsburg, we ran into Mrs. Linsburg. And years later, we\ntold the daughter who survived, who lives in Israel. She lost her mother somewhere in\nRavensbrick and she never found out what happened to her - No, her mother disappeared\nand she never know where. And we told her, we saw her in Ravensbruck. We just\nglanced at her in Ravensbriick, because she was in Ravensbriick. But what happened\nafter, we don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m telling you, it was total chaos, so that it was just\nimpossible. And people who were with each other, if they were separated, then that was\nthe end of that.",
        "Q: By this time, by the time you\u2019re in Ravensbrick, have you found out what happened to\nyour - that your father 1s dead - or you still don\u2019t know anything?",
        "A: No, no, we didn\u2019t know yet.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know?",
        "A: No, because we had to find out from the men, you see. It\u2019s the men from Starachowice\nwho knew what happened. I don\u2019t know at which point we found out about it. I don\u2019t\nknow, but we did have to find it out from the men.",
        "Q: So, that\u2019s later, then?",
        "A: Probably, I don\u2019t know. Or maybe we already knew. I couldn\u2019t tell you for sure. But I\nknow that we did find out that he perished in October, October of \u201944.",
        "Q: And by the time you\u2019re in Ravensbriick, have you decided that your mother is already\ndead?",
        "A: In all likelihood, we\u2019ve thought that in all likelihood that she would not turn up because\nwe\u2019d seen too much and heard too much. We heard too much. You see, having now been\nmixed in with all the people from Auschwitz and in Ravensbrick, with the influx of\npeople from every conceivable part of Poland, it was very easy to piece things together.\nSo that...we had a pretty good idea I think by then, but not a certainty, and certainly did\nnot give up the idea that they might still be alive.",
        "Q: Do you remember the moment when someone asked for volunteers to get out of\nRavensbrick and go to a subcamp?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I remember that, yeah. And, not I, but Krysia and Hania, Chris and Hania, we\nall volunteered, and... As I\u2019m fond of saying, we volunteered for what? We didn\u2019t know.\nIt could have been going up the chimney, but we volunteered to get out of Auschwitz, not\nto go wherever - we didn\u2019t know...",
        "Q: You mean Ravensbriick?",
        "A: Out of Ravensbruck, right. We volunteered because things have gotten to be totally\nimpossible, totally. So, they said, whoever wants to go, get on the truck, but where the\ntruck was going nobody knew. But that was a very fine choice, because these were the\nfirst shipments out of Ravensbriick, and we ended up in Retzow, which was an empty\ncamp, which was later to be receiving other prisoners, but we were lucky enough to staff\nthat camp. I ended up a maid for an SS woman. Hania ended up a maid for the - in an\noffice. Chris didn\u2019t have a good job - I forgot, Chris told me, she reminded me the other\nday how I spoke on - you know, this I have to really relate again because...",
        "Q: I think you should hold it because I think we have to change the tape before you begin.\nSo, we\u2019ll start with your talking about Chris.\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10",
        "Q: We ended the last tape with your beginning to tell us about the three jobs you had in\nRetzow, and in particular, Chris, you said, had a terrible job first.",
        "A: Yes, I forgot. She actually reminded me of it, but I remembered after she refreshed my\nmemory. I worked for the SS woman. Our section, the women\u2019s section of Ravensbrick -\nof Retzow, excuse me - was ran by SS women, and they were a category of their own,\nawful, brutal people. And they of course needed servants, and I was one of the personal\nservants. She lived in a room. I did her laundry, I brought in wood to keep the stove\ngoing, you know, and cleaned the house and so on. She took a liking to me, but I was still\na Jew. And she would not come near me ever. I would walk in, she would walk out. And\nif she talked to me, she talked to me from another end of the - because she just wouldn\u2019t\nbe near me. So, then she started leaving crusts of bread for me. She didn\u2019t like crusts. So,\nshe said, \u201cIll be leaving this crust. If you find it on the table, that\u2019s for you.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cThank you very much.\u201d So, meanwhile, one day she came in and she says, \u201cDid you\nfind the crusts I left for you?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, thank you very much. I eat them.\u201d And she\nsays, \u201cHow are things going for you? Who are you here with? Do you know anybody, do\nyou have family?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I have one sister who works in the office, she cleans\nthe office, and then I have another sister, but she does not have a good job.\u201d I forgot what\nKrysia did. She says, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll get her a good job.\u201d So, Krysia was assigned to the\nkitchen, and that was really a great, wonderful thing. Of course, she was the most vicious\nthing, but in a very paradoxical way, I really benefited greatly toward my liberation from\nbeing her servant, because they were so - they lorded over everybody so you not only had\nto do for her and so on. When the evacuation of Retzow was organized, we had to carry\ntheir rucksacks. They took their stuff, and we had to carry - the maids had to carry - not\nGod forbid somebody else. So, when we were evacuated from Retzow, as the eastern\nfront was approaching, the Russians were approaching closer and closer; the war was\nalready going toward the end. I think this was by then probably April - end of March,\nearly April. When we found ourselves on the road with all the evacuees of every stripe\nand of every possible persuasion, because you had the Jewish prisoners of war - Jewish -\nyou know, prisoners from the concentration camps, and you had Polish laborers who\nworked on the farm, and you had German military and German out of uniform, and\nGerman civilians with dogs and cars and whatever - we had to carry their stuff. And then\nwhen it came to a point where the road was so clogged up we couldn\u2019t move, they told us\nto sit down. Well, we made a way - there were the few maids that were carrying the\nrucksacks - and by the way, I kept saying that there were twelve of us, but Hania\nreminded me it was ten, and Helena was one. There was one woman there, Helena, she\nwas blonde, one of the servants, or whatever. She spoke German very well. I think she\nwas from Krakow or somewhere. When we made it off the road, the main road where the\nevacuees were, I had this woman\u2019s rucksack with all her belongings, so in final analysis, I\nproved to be a skunk, because what Helena did - she was carrying somebody else\u2019s - and\nyou know, they had those black capes, these women, they had black wool capes that they\nwore. So, Helena put her cape, the cape over her clothes and put the woman\u2019s hat, and we\nall decided... No, I didn\u2019t decide... But the ten of us, not the twelve, the ten of us who\nmade it off the road, onto the field and away from the evacuees on the road, were\nsupposed to pretend that we are the prisoners and Helena was our guard, and she was\nguiding us - no, not guiding us. Guarding us. She was guarding us, you see. So, we had\nthe paraphernalia, the German paraphernalia. So, she probably, in the final analysis, the\nSS woman, who trusted me, who took a liking, she probably said, \u201cWell, like all the\nJews, she betrayed me.\u201d She was so vicious, she was very, very... But to me, she was\nabsolutely wonderful.",
        "Q: And why do you think that was? How do you explain that?",
        "A: I cannot explain it. I cannot explain it. The mere fact that she didn\u2019t want to be near me\nbut she left me crusts of bread, that she asked me if I have it well, if everything 1s fine,\nand if I have family, on the one hand. And then on the other hand, I saw how what she\ndid to other people. So, I cannot explain it.",
        "Q: You were in Retzow for, what, a couple of months?",
        "A: From the time we left Ravensbriick, which probably was February or so, in February.\nYeah, about a couple of months, right, because the evacuation from Retzow was about\nearly April, for 1945.",
        "Q: And, in addition to these crumbs of bread, was the food...?",
        "A: Well, the food was better because - I really got ahead of my story - but I didn\u2019t say that\nafter we - those trucks out of Ravensbrick - that brought us 1n, all the so-called spots\nwere filled with us, maid and this and the other, women were brought in - in fact, some of\nthe people we knew from Poland - were brought into this camp, because there was an air\nforce base, a German air force base, not far, and they were digging anti-aircraft ditches or\nwhatever. So, these laborers were supposed to be working for the - maybe not only the air\nforce - no, airport, or whatever you call it. Anyhow, once the camp was filled, we found\nthat there were people who we knew from the other camps. And, of course, we had it\nvery fine now, because having to work for the German women who didn\u2019t really want us\nto mingle with the population, so we slept in separate quarters under the kitchen. So\nKrysia always brought down a little more bread, and so that was really fine. And so we\ngot restored again before the big evacuation on the road.",
        "Q: I\u2019m having an association. There was a story that Krysia told about Hania in Auschwitz\nthat had to do with food. Do you remember?",
        "A: Yes. Now, Chris remembers it much better, and I know that Hania fainted and all this, but\nI don\u2019t really recall this. I only remember it because Chris told me about it. I really truly\ndidn\u2019t remember that. I\u2019m beginning, you know, as I analyze and think back, I really\nthink I that I obliterated certain things from my mind. Because I have a very distinct\nrecollection about certain things and none about other things, so there has to be some\nselective thinking here. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re now on the road with ten other people - ten others?",
        "A: Yes, ten women, ten.",
        "Q: Ten women.",
        "A: No, we are, the total of us is ten.",
        "Q: And Helena is acting like the SS guard.",
        "A: Yes, Helena is, because she is wearing the black cape.",
        "Q: And she has blonde hair.",
        "A: She has blonde hair and she speaks German very well. And we slide down an\nembankment. Because, you know, the traffic came to a dead stop. Every - you couldn\u2019t\ngo if you tried - everything on the road. It isn\u2019t that we stopped for our own sake. There\nwas no place to move. All the cars and all the trucks and all the military equipment and\nall the peasants with the wagons, and everything is stopped dead. And they are\nmeanwhile giving out rations from Sweden - packages, Red Cross packages from\nSweden.",
        "Q: On the road?",
        "A: On the road, in the middle of all this. And the German women are grabbing the cigarettes\nlike crazy - there are cigarettes then - and these German women with whom we served,\nthey are grabbing them. And I remember getting sardines there; we got sardines. But\nanyhow, I remember, we are stuck on this road, which is completely choked up traffic,\nand we slide down an embankment - we don\u2019t slide, we go down an embankment. The\nfields are a little lower than the road on an embankment. And we as far as where there 1s\nlike - no, not snow - cut grass piled up. What do you call that?",
        "Q: Hay?",
        "A: Hay, right. We go behind these haystacks and we sit there hoping to sit 1t out, to wait\nuntil they move on. And before we know it, a person comes over, a man. He hears us\nspeak Polish, and he asks if we\u2019re Polish. And we say, \u201cYes, we\u2019re Polish. We ran away\nfrom this here, this evacuation route.\u201d And he says, \u201cYou know, there is a lot of Poles\nhere because we\u2019re working on the, in the farm. Why don\u2019t you go to that house over\nthere and tell them I sent you, and they\u2019ll put you up.\u201d So, that\u2019s what happened. We\nwalked away. Nobody ever missed us. We got to the villa, it was a German villa, and we\nstayed there until the Germans came That\u2019s how we were liberated - except, one of the\ngirls among the ten was a Russian, and she said the Russians rape women, so we should\nnot stay around, which we had no intentions of staying around, no intention. We just were\nmostly here to get back and find out finally, put all of the pieces of the puzzle together to\nsee who survived and who... So, very soon, we started toward the railroad and we got on\nthe trains going back east. But that was easier said than done because everybody - people\nwere so dislocated, and everybody wanted to get east, further east. So, we were on the\ntrain for a few stops, then we got bumped off. And then, there were Russian soldiers\nriding and all sorts of other people, and then we got on the train again. We didn\u2019t know\nwhere we were going, but we were going east, wherever the train will take us, as far as\nBibgost (ph). Bibgost (ph) we knew was sort of a - what do you call it - a cross-, no, sort\nof a central line crossing. We still didn\u2019t know - we thought we were going to\nStarachowice, of course. We just said, \u201cWe\u2019ll make our way to Poland and from there,\nwe'll worry about going to Starachowice.\u201d But we met a Russian soldier who was Jewish\non the train, and he told us, if we\u2019re Jewish, not to go back, because it\u2019s not safe in those\nsmall - he asked us how big a town it was, and we said, \u201cSmall town.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t go back; go to a big city.\u201d And we said, \u201cBig city? But we don\u2019t anybody.\u201d He\nsays, \u201cNo, you go to a big city, and you can register with the Jewish agents. And that\u2019s\nwhere you can find family, not in a small town.\u201d Which is what we did, we went to Lodz,\nand he gave us an address of his sister, so we stayed overnight, and then next day we\nwent to register, and we were given a place - not an apartment. It was a bombed-out\nplace, but they assigned it to us, the Jewish agency. And I think they gave us ration cards\nor something like that. And soon enough, we found out that Uncle Alexander survived,\nthat he was in Lodz. And, of course, then we started finding out what happened, that all\nthese people who were resettled [shakes head] were no longer alive, because they were\nexterminated. They were not resettled. And all the people that might not show up didn\u2019t\nnecessarily get resettled either. They died of a million different causes. If it wasn\u2019t\nstarvation, it was sickness. If it wasn\u2019t sickness, it was a bullet. But then it came out that\nthere were extermination camps, which served only the purpose of killing en masse. And\nthat was something totally new. We knew about shootings on the highway and on the\nroad and starvation and typhus. We knew; we saw it; we were part of it. We never really -\nof course, in Auschwitz, we also knew about Auschwitz - but we had no idea about all\nthese other places, where all this was happening at the same time. So, the resettlement\nwas a euphemism, and how the secrets were kept for all those years, when the Germans\nwere committing the most heinous crime of all history, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how\nthat could altogether happen without people knowing, but that\u2019s how it happened. And\nwe settled in Lodz, you know, after the war. And Hania and Chris went back to Poland,\nand I told you about Genia (ph), that maid of ours. She absolutely said she had nothing,\nand she threatened them. And Mrs.Paliszewska - that night, the little children that came\nback from Auschwitz were killed in my hometown. And Mrs. Paliszewska - one of\nwomen of the Paliszewska sisters worked at the railroad station, she sold tickets there,\nand they lived very near the railroad station, so she secured tickets for them and put them\non the train and they came back to Lodz. So, that was where the end of the war found us.",
        "Q: Did this feel - on the one hand, you were liberated and free, and on the other hand, you\nfind a world of tragedy - so, are you very conflicted about what you find?",
        "A: Well, we are really in shock still, because we survived, and we still cannot figure out how\nit happened that we did survive. We are not yet aware of the entire truth of everything.\nGrandmother - after all, we had a tremendous family, extended family, on my mother\u2019s\nside especially. Originally, there were nine children - I don\u2019t mean children - nine\nsiblings, who had all the kids and their kids, and my father\u2019s family wasn\u2019t so large, but it\nwas large, too. So, eventually, we pieced it all together to find out that people perished.\nBut it really took many years before the truth came out because, as you know, people\nwere reluctant to talk about it. Everybody was busy trying to live, to return to normal life,\nand nobody wanted - was willing to talk about Holocaust. They just lived through it; why\ntalk about it? So that, not too many things were yet known, but we knew now for a fact\nthat Mother had perished in Treblinka, because we knew that the transport out of\nStarachowice, after the original evacuation of the Jewish population, from the square\nwhere they were segregated, that those trains when straight to Treblinka. So, we knew\nthat. Then we knew that a lot of people perished in Starachowice camp, and then they\nperished right along as we got along. So, then, of course, it came out that there were such\ncamps where slave labor was not required. The ultimate purpose of that camp was\ngenocide, and that only Jews were being selected for that genocide. So, that was a total\neye-opener. But, you know, life went on. Chris met Miles and they got married, and they\nsort of adopted me, so I stayed with them. I went to school while we were living in Lodz.\nHania, Anna, went to school of diplomacy in Warsaw. But we lived with Uncle\nAlexander - Miles, Chris, I and Uncle Alexander. Uncle Alexander went to Sweden\nbecause his wife survived - she survived in one of the camps like Retzow - but she was\nshipped out to Sweden because she was quite ill at liberation time. And that was -\nsubsequently, Miles, Chris and I went to Berlin, and I went to school in Berlin. And we\nwere in Berlin from about March/April of \u201946 until January of \u201947, because we arrived in\nAmerica February 11\", in 1947. So, that chapter was closed. We more or less knew how\nour parents perished. We also found out from people from Ostrowiec what happened to\nGrandma and the aunts. I had two aunts living there. One was single, and the other,\nRegina - another Regina - Aunt Regina, who was married, and Angia, who wasn\u2019t\nmarried - they lived with the grandmother because they ran a printing shop. And so they\nwent - Regina with her husband and Angia and Babka - and Grandma - they all were sent\nto Treblinka, as well, because Ostrowiec was slated for Treblinka. And my father\u2019s\nfamily, only my cousin survived. One aunt, I mean, Uncle Alexander survived with his\nwife, and then one of my father\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter, survived, and a cousin, Angia, who\nlives in Israel. And the extended family numbered - I cannot begin to tell you because I\nwouldn\u2019t really know, but really, a very big number. And we did have three uncles who\nescaped from Poland in the 20\u2019s. Not escaped, but made their way out, because they were\ngoing to be conscripted. So, they made their way out, and they lived in Canada, so we\neventually got in touch with them. But as far as the Holocaust story of our family is\nconcerned, I mean, this is in essence not just a narrative covering our survival, the three\nof us, but really, the extended family, how that was decimated. Unfortunately, you know?\nIt was such a fine family, you know, my mother\u2019s big family. But unfortunately that\u2019s all\ngone. We\u2019ve made peace with that, you know?",
        "Q: For those, for those people who are watching this, there is a five-hour audio tape of life\nafter the Holocaust which I think will cover an enormous amount of these years, from\n1945 on. I have one final question to ask you, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too big a question\nor too small a question. Do you look back - When you look back on your life, on this\nperiod, do you find a particular effect it has had on you or set of effects. And let me give\nyou one example from your sister Chris, because I thought was very interesting. Someone\nasked her why she only has two children, and she said, \u201cBecause I only have two hands.\nAnd if something happens, I have to be able to hold onto each child, and if I had a third\narm, I would have three children.\u201d Which I found a very interesting kind of effect. And\nI\u2019m wondering if there is something in you in terms of your life, how you have led your\nlife since, what you feel and how it\u2019s affected you...?",
        "A: No, you see, I mentioned before in the interview that I felt older people had a harder time\nin the camps, and I also think they had a harder time after the war, whether adjusting to a\nnew language, a new country, a new culture, or whichever, or altogether, even if they\nwent back to stay in Europe, adjusting to the emptiness, to the horror that was still in the\nsoil, so to say, European soil. In my case, I found that, because I had never lived and I\nalways wanted to taste life, I had no time. I had absolutely - I came out of the war like a\nracing horse coming out of a stable. I was ready and willing and raring to go. I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to look back and I wasn\u2019t going to contemplate and I wasn\u2019t going to analyze, I\nwanted to live. And I did. Everything, you know that - in fact, when I was in Jefferson\nHigh School, and Dr. Horowitz, who - they gave me a big party for my 18\" birthday\nbecause I\u2019d done this and that - so, he said he wanted the newspaper to write about the\nparty, so he brings in people from the newspapers - the Jewish paper and the Post - the\nNew York Post was in those days a different paper, liberal paper - so, this guy is\ninterviewing me for the Post, and he says, \u201cI understand you have a number. Could you\nshow me your number?\u201d So, I showed him the number, and he took a picture of my arm,\nand that\u2019s how the Post printed it - me and they wrote about the birthday party and how\nthe whole class was throwing me a birthday party and that I was a victim. So, when he\nsaid for me to show him the number, I thought, \u201cIsn\u2019t that ridiculous.\u201d But I didn\u2019t want\nto disappoint Dr. Horowitz, because it was in his house and he was doing the party. I\nthought it was so ridiculous to start dwelling on those things. I am just trying to show you\nby illustration how I felt. I had no time for that. That was a closed chapter. Now, I didn\u2019t\ngo to school yet, I didn\u2019t finish anything, I wanted to study, I wanted to do, I wanted to\nlive, I wanted - I loved to dance. Here I am going to go through the thing - I\u2019d had\nenough of it! And I really think a lot of people felt that way if they were yet young\nenough to more or less not to have the broken spirit because they had known already\ngrown-up life, you see. So, I just burst right into life in America. In fact, I already had a\ngreat time in Berlin, when I was in Berlin. But when I came to America, that was\nabsolutely everything, because I mean, I could now do all of these things, including going\nto school and going to college and having a great time and marrying and having\nwonderful children and all this. Of course, now, because I have translated a lot of works\non the Holocaust, I discovered - I have been discovering constantly new phases of the\nwar that I was totally unaware of, because I didn\u2019t even want to dwell on it So, now, all\nthese years later, 50 years later, I am first finding out about, okay, I knew about the Lodz\nghetto, I wrote - I translated a book on this. So, I knew about this ghetto and I did this\ncamp and such camp, where there 1s true translation or true people I know. But there is a\nwhole world of Holocaust experiences that I never even knew about, which I am finding\nout about now. But in those days, when I came to the United States, why would I want to\nbother with that? Who had the time for that? I didn\u2019t have time. I didn\u2019t have time for\nanything, only for forging ahead. And that, I think, carried me through life, in the sense\nthat, if I look back, of course, I always, always think of my parents and the loss of my\nparents and the loss of my family, the tremendous loss of the family. But to regret the life\nthat was? I cannot, because, if I went back now, that life would be nothing like the\nwonderful life that I had in America. So, you cannot go home again, and I don\u2019t want to\ngo home again, because I\u2019ve been to Poland twice, and believe me, that would be the last\nplace I would want to live in, under the Communist regime, especially, you know? So\nthat, to sum it all up, I was lucky enough to be young enough to survive the war as a\nyoungster, and to still be able - even though at the beginning, I did feel a little\nimbalanced, you know, my head was a little bit further away - higher - not higher - more\nprogressive - my head progressed a little better than my other emotional, but eventually,\nit evened out, you see? And of course, I sort of apply the experiences to my life as it\u2019s\nlived from day to day. For example, everyone said, \u201cHow much do your kids know about\nyour background?\u201d My kids always knew everything they wanted to know. They knew I\nwent through the camps, and I told them all the time, \u201cPlease ask me. I will never set you\ndown and say, \u2018Sit down and I want to tell you this.\u2019\u201d I never did that. That was never - I\nsaid, \u201cBut if you want to know, anything you want to know, I will tell you.\u201d And every\nnow and then I would relay an anecdote, and of course, they saw the films, and we\u2019re\nvery close - our family generally, you know, our family - the Lermans and the Wilsons\nand the kids and the grandkids - we\u2019re very, very close. So you know, the stories are\nexchanged, but not as an imposition. I would never think of saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hear\nmy story.\u201d I myself wasn\u2019t interested in my story when the war ended. I just wanted to\nsay, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s another chapter, case closed, keep on going.\u201d So, that was my attitude\nand still is. And, as you noticed, I am very short on specifics. For example, my sister\nAnna, she knows a lot of specifics about the hierarchy of the camps and who was what\nand how the camps were run. I don\u2019t know. I just know the particulars pertaining to my\npersonal survival. And the fact that, when the war ended, everything was fresh in my\nmind, but I wasn\u2019t interested. I wasn\u2019t interested in me, period. I was interested in the\nnew life, and the me could wait. And of course, 1t waited until now, when every day I am\nfinding out about another thing that I never knew about. So, the other day I read in the\nPolish press about Dietwagner (ph), this Polish community not far from Warsaw. Now,\n60 years later, I am first, first finding out. Now I read avidly, whether it\u2019s in Polish or in\nEnglish, on the subject. But in those years, it wasn\u2019t taboo. When I married Victor I told\nhim, \u201cAnything you want to know, ask me. But I don\u2019t have patience nor the time for\nthat.\u201d There were other intellectual pursuits and other pursuits. I had to fit 1n all these\nother things that I missed. I\u2019m going to talk about Auschwitz and about Ravensbrick?\nWho needs it?\nEnd of Tape #10\nTape #11\n[Picture shown]",
        "A: This picture was taken in Lodz in June 1945, right after we came back from Germany to\nPoland. And I have a few of these at home, and because of their size, I am quite sure that\nthey were made for identification, meaning for my passport or ID cards or whichever.

        "Q: I want you to close your eyes for a minute and think about what comes to your - then you\ncan open them again - what comes to mind when you first think about your childhood?\nWhat\u2019s the picture that you get in your head about your childhood?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you think that was true for your two older sisters, Chris and Hania?",
        "Q: Were you close with both of your parents?",
        "Q: What was your father like and what did he do?",
        "Q: Let me ask you something...",
        "Q: ...about his personality.",
        "Q: Was he a man filled with humor?",
        "Q: Was he very serious?",
        "Q: I understand that at least Krysia and, I don\u2019t know, maybe Hania and you also sang\nwith...",
        "Q: ...with them.",
        "Q: So even though you were a child...",
        "Q: How did you understand - I know that you went to your Grandma because she was very\nconcerned that you weren\u2019t getting a proper Jewish education.",
        "Q: But was, did your father come from a more secular home and 1s that why your home was\nso secular?",
        "Q: Was there a good percentage of the Jewish population who were more like you than were\nreligious, or was it a really tiny group? Do you know?",
        "Q: What was she like? What kind of woman...?",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. Your father was a forestry engineer is that correct?",
        "Q: Did you know what he was doing?",
        "Q: Was he away a lot?",
        "Q: Was he away from home a great deal, do you remember\u2019?",
        "Q: Were you wealthy?",
        "Q: So, how, when you say you were well to do, what, how does that manifest itself?",
        "Q: They helped her?",
        "Q: I want to get, before we get to the war period, I wanted to ask you, up until 1939, what is\nyour relationship with your sisters? You are...?",
        "Q: [Laughs. |",
        "Q: You know, it\u2019s interesting because Chris is only two years older than you.",
        "Q: But there was - you were the kid to her.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you a question. Chris - when I interviewed Chris - she mentioned\nsomething about you, that she remembered, you as a child, and I wonder if you\nremembered the same thing. She said you would always pick up new words constantly\nand use them immediately, often inappropriately, sometimes not... Do you recall that?",
        "Q: So, aS you\u2019re growing up - now, you\u2019re born in \u201929, so when the Nazis take over in\nGermany...",
        "Q: ...No, 33 - you\u2019re much younger.",
        "Q: So, between \u00b033 and \u00b039, do you hear things - I know towards the end of \u201939, there are\nGerman Jews that come into your area, right?",
        "Q: So, do you begin to experience... sense something, even if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s\nhappening?",
        "Q: So, though you know this now...",
        "Q: ...from reading the history, did you experience the change as being that significant?",
        "Q: But this was before the war?",
        "Q: But let me - can I probe this just a little bit?",
        "Q: What was it, that your feelings were, when you - was it humiliation? Was it anger, when\nthe teacher said your name is Rivka what...?",
        "Q: Were there other Jewish kids in the class?",
        "Q: Did he do the same thing to them?",
        "Q: And what did the other kids do when he said that? Did they do any- Did they laugh, did\nthey...? Nothing?",
        "Q: Did he ever call you that name again?",
        "Q: Right, it\u2019s hard to know what it is that .",
        "Q: So, what did you say to that little girl when she said this to you?",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "Q: So, did you go home and tell your parents that she said this to you?",
        "Q: And what did they say?",
        "Q: Do you remember, do you remember people coming into your parents\u2019 house, adults,\nbefore, right before the war, where there was people talking about what might be\nhappening? Not that you participated in it, but did you ever experience people coming in\nand there being a certain kind of tension in the house, even though you couldn\u2019t...?",
        "Q: I thought maybe you would be sitting outside of a conversation...",
        "Q: Okay. So then September 1939 comes, yeah, September 1939. And this must be a huge\nshock. All of a sudden...",
        "Q: [Laughs.] You were too young.",
        "Q: But how many...?",
        "Q: Did you take, I understand that you all carried something of value from the house. Is that\nright?",
        "Q: Did you take something special of your own?",
        "Q: No, no, no, I mean you.",
        "Q: A toy, a doll or something?",
        "Q: I think the tape stopped before you explained how the planes were swooping down with\nlights underneath them and shooting at you.",
        "Q: You must have been scared to death.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something.",
        "Q: Did your mother hold you? Were you being held on to by somebody during the night?",
        "Q: Do you happen to recall your first supper, dinner when you came back from the forest?",
        "Q: What is your most immediate recollection of the change for your life, not everybody\nelse\u2019s life, but as a child?",
        "Q: Did you feel, as a Jewish person, as a Jewish child, different from what was happening to\nthe Christian Polish kids? I mean you had, there was a very close family, the\nPaliszewskis, to you, right?",
        "Q: Was your maid Jewish or Christian?",
        "Q: So, what happened to the maid and the dog?",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "Q: Lenny?",
        "Q: No, I was going to ask you why, because often, certainly in my family, the anger at the\nPolish population is sometimes more severe than to the Germans.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s get back now.",
        "Q: The one question I wanted to ask before the tape is going to run out is what did, happened\nin your family when school was no longer possible for you. I understand a little school\nwas developed in your house?",
        "Q: Seven?",
        "Q: So, how many hours a day was Hania teaching?",
        "Q: So you\u2019re ten, eleven years old?",
        "Q: You had paper, enough paper in the house?",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019ll take a break now.",
        "Q: Renia, tell me something about what you think the effect of having a home schooling was\non you? I wondered whether you thought that in future years that it was very helpful to\nhave all this - whatever it was you learned - in your head.",
        "Q: How many hours a day did Hania teach you?",
        "Q: Did she give you good grades?",
        "Q: So, did you not go outside at all?",
        "Q: Just to get everything clear, you were 10 years old when...",
        "Q: Hania was 15 when she was starting to teach you, right? And Chris is 13.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: It put you in a different world.",
        "Q: So, the thoughts that you had are that this is war, nothing else terribly bad, it would be\ndeprivation...",
        "Q: So, how do you remember what happened to your father? Do you remember what you\nsaw when you were 10, 11, 12, during those...?",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection of the time your father came home having somewhat been\nbeaten up by a Nazi?",
        "Q: How long were you able to stay in the apartment you had been living in when you came\nback after the evacuation?",
        "Q: Until \u00b042.",
        "Q: When you moved each of these three times, is 1t your parents who found the place? Or\nyou just run out? Do you have any idea?",
        "Q: You have no idea?",
        "Q: What do you recall about what your father was doing? Obviously, he\u2019s no longer for a\nlong time doing...?",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "Q: So, there was a Judenrat?",
        "Q: But you\u2019re not sure.",
        "Q: During this period, prior to the ghetto really being formed, even though it isn\u2019t a closed\nghetto, do you experience a lot of fear, knowing that you have to be in the house, even in\nspite of the fact that you love schooling so much.",
        "Q: Is your, 1s your mother working also?",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re in the house with your...",
        "Q: Both sisters? Chris was...",
        "Q: Right from the beginning?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: I want to get to that, but I just want to ask you a question about your little school friends,\nthat you went to school with.",
        "Q: Were these close friends of yours?",
        "Q: And did they live very nearby? Because given what you said, it was dangerous for kids...",
        "Q: Did you talk privately with them about what was going on?",
        "Q: So, it was a sort of entertainment that your parents gave you with these stories...",
        "Q: Chris told a story of about a bunch of young people - I have no idea if you were there -\noutside when somebody - now, I don\u2019t know exactly where this is because I don\u2019t know\nexactly where she was describing - they were outside, it seemed to be the summer, and\nsome young man came out from the bushes looking awful and talking about Treblinka.\nAnd Chris and Hania brought him into the house. Were you there?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember the story?",
        "Q: Actually, she said that she didn\u2019t believe this guy. And brought him in to the house, and\nyour parents asked her to leave.",
        "Q: So, she didn\u2019t hear...",
        "Q: Now, during these two years prior to the - because I want to get to the evacuation - during\nthese two years, are things getting worse in terms of food, in terms of...?",
        "Q: One very brief question before we take a break, because the tape 1s going to run out: Do\nyou remember when you had to put an armband? I understand you wore an armband?",
        "Q: Until the end? Until the evacuation?",
        "Q: Right. All right, let\u2019s take a break and change the tape.",
        "Q: Renia, I want to ask you to describe one of the most difficult days, probably, of your\nentire life, the evacuation, October 27\", 1942.",
        "Q: Can you lead us through the day?",
        "Q: So, you marched off with women.",
        "Q: Can we just go back?",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to visualize the picture you\u2019ve created.",
        "Q: You\u2019re a child of... 1942... You\u2019re thirteen...",
        "Q: ... thirteen years old, and you\u2019re seeing a level of violence - you\u2019ve seen some violence -\nbut you\u2019re seeing a level of violence that...",
        "Q: ...exceeds anybody\u2019s imagination. Do you scream when you see things?",
        "Q: You\u2019re very quiet with your parents.",
        "Q: You\u2019re so scared... Right.",
        "Q: This is going to be a strange question, but...",
        "Q: Do you think you were afraid because you were alone or because you were vulnerable,\nbecause you saw how vulnerable, or was the two of them...?",
        "Q: So, when you... Is the first person in your family that you saw your father?",
        "Q: And did you talk?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So, one would assume if that young man who came out of the bushes - the story that\nChris told - and if your parents really believed him as to what was happening in\nTreblinka, your father probably figured out where your mother probably went.",
        "Q: So, did you keep in your head that at some point you would see your mother again?",
        "Q: So, how long did it take before you met up with your sisters, do you think, about?",
        "Q: That was right away?",
        "Q: What did you - what went through your head when you saw these selections and people\nbeing killed because they were sick, or for some other reason? Did you think they were\ngoing to kill everybody?",
        "Q: Now, you were probably a little past the age of when a young girl would have\nmenstruated.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Did you know that you were supposed to menstruate?",
        "Q: Yeah. And were you nervous about the fact that...?",
        "Q: [chuckles]",
        "Q: Were you able to notice whether other women were menstruating in the ghetto?",
        "Q: Now, that\u2019s a long-term myth, that they put in something in the food.",
        "Q: They put stuff in the food, but not to stop menstruation.",
        "Q: That\u2019s why I was asking, in the ghetto circumstance and in the camp circumstance - you\ndidn\u2019t get it, but I wondered whether you noticed that other women...",
        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t know?",
        "Q: And what was food like in the camp? What did you get in the morning? Did you get two\nmeals, three meals, if one could call them meals?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: So, this was an unusual circumstance to have somebody so close being able to get things\nin to you?",
        "Q: And is it the case also that she was able to get medicine in when you had typhus?",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: Did they take away your clothes when you went into the - into the camp? You had all\nthese layers of clothes.",
        "Q: What did you do with them?",
        "Q: And where did you sleep?",
        "Q: We need to take a break now, to change the tape.",
        "Q: Renia, how would you describe your relationship with your two other sisters at this\npoint? I mean, they\u2019re sort of... Do each of you have a different role at this point, I mean,\ncould you describe it that way?",
        "Q: Why wouldn\u2019t you consider that - I don\u2019t want to call it a survival strategy - but why\nwouldn\u2019t you consider that things that you actually did? You had to watch, because...",
        "Q: Could you control your fear?",
        "Q: Were there other kids about your age in the camp, as well?",
        "Q: There were?",
        "Q: Do you have any idea why they smuggled the kids into the camp from these places they\nwere being hidden?",
        "Q: But how about children your age, young adults?",
        "Q: So, the contact that you had during the day - you\u2019re at the laundry most of the day?",
        "Q: So, you don\u2019t see your sisters because they\u2019re working elsewhere?",
        "Q: So, do you have friends outside your two sisters?",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m going to go back to a question I asked you a long time ago, because you\ninterpreted it somewhat differently than I had intended it. Do you now, when you\u2019re in\nthe laundry, in some sense reap the benefits of having been 1n school with your sister\nteaching you, because you kept learning things? Did these things go through your head?\nDo you replay the books in your head, and poetry?",
        "Q: No, no, no, no, no - that\u2019s not what I said. You interpreted it differently; it wasn\u2019t that\nyou didn\u2019t answer it to my satisfaction. It\u2019s just that I had a slightly different intention,\nand it was very interesting to hear where you took it.",
        "Q: But perhaps I asked it too early. Asking you now is maybe more appropriate. Is there any\npoem that you recall repeating to yourself a lot there, that you could repeat for us, that\nwas really important?",
        "Q: Were there any situations where there was a public sharing of poetry or singing in the\ncamp that you remember?",
        "Q: In the camp?",
        "Q: Did you sleep with your sisters?",
        "Q: In the same barrack?",
        "Q: So, in the evening, you would be together. And were they able to get in touch with your\nfather more regularly than you?",
        "Q: How do you remember him doing?",
        "Q: Was he gassed, do you know?",
        "Q: Do you know about how old he was by the time he got to Auschwitz? Would he have\nbeen in his 50s?",
        "Q: Was there a warning that there would be an evacuation at the camp; that you were going\nto be deported out of the camp?",
        "Q: Oh, so describe it.",
        "Q: And how long were you relocated in that place?",
        "Q: Do you think, days, weeks?",
        "Q: I see. So, both camps were emptied...?",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t remember quite the timing of Strzelnica?",
        "Q: Strzelnica turning...?",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re there for a few days, you think...",
        "Q: A week, and then trains come.",
        "Q: And of course nobody announces to you where you\u2019re going.",
        "Q: Now, are you afraid again?",
        "Q: How was the trip?",
        "Q: Before we take a break with the tape, when you arrived in Auschwitz, was it as awful an\narrival as your marketplace experience?",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re going to have to stop now and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: I was just thinking that your middle-childhood years, from 10 to 15, is all during this\nhorrible period. You\u2019re 15 years old when you enter Auschwitz.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite extraordinary to think of that, isn\u2019t 1t? When I asked you about the entrance into\nAuschwitz, was there a lot of beating when you were taken off the railroad car, or was it\nmore quiet? Do you have a recollection of that immediate time?",
        "Q: So, your bodily hair was not shaved. Only...",
        "Q: So, you had your clothes off. You were nude when they cut your hair?",
        "Q: Do you still have your tattoo?",
        "Q: Did you ever think of taking it off?",
        "Q: Was it humiliating to have the tattoo put on? Did it hurt you?",
        "Q: So, when you get tat-... You\u2019re shaved, you get tattooed, and then the clothes.",
        "Q: Were they filthy?",
        "Q: When did you find out that this was Auschwitz and what Auschwitz was? Was it very\nsoon after your arrival?",
        "Q: Did you know at the time that there were huge numbers of Hungarian Jews being brought\nin?",
        "Q: You were put into a quarantine camp for the first month?",
        "Q: Do you remember what barrack it was? Do you have any recollection?",
        "Q: How did you understand what a quarantine camp was? What was that supposed to mean,\n\u201cquarantine barrack\u2019\u201d?",
        "Q: Do you recall the moment that you found out about the gas chambers?",
        "Q: Not smoke.",
        "Q: So, did they also tell you things to avoid? Did you get clues about how one could survive\nin this thing? That there was a way...?",
        "Q: Did you see the bodies?",
        "Q: You just heard about it?",
        "Q: So, in the first month or two, do you three talk about this situation? Try to figure out...?",
        "Q: Do you have nightmares?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "Q: Were you able to sleep okay?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Was it quiet in the barrack or was it noisy? Do you remember? Smelly?",
        "Q: You were in the upper bunk, so that was good.",
        "Q: Was there an oven in the middle?",
        "Q: When did - I don\u2019t know the chronology, so I may be asking the question too soon - when\ndid the incident with the boots happen? Was this before you were in Effektenkammer or\nafter?",

        "Q: Did anyone ever surprise you, someone you thought was a good person turned out in that\nsituation to be very difficult or harsh?",

Do you look back - When you look back on your life, on this\nperiod, do you find a particular effect it has had on you or set of effects. And let me give\nyou one example from your sister Chris, because I thought was very interesting. Someone\nasked her why she only has two children, and she said, \u201cBecause I only have two hands.\nAnd if something happens, I have to be able to hold onto each child, and if I had a third\narm, I would have three children.\u201d Which I found a very interesting kind of effect. And\nI\u2019m wondering if there is something in you in terms of your life, how you have led your\nlife since, what you feel and how it\u2019s affected you...?"

        "A: I was born December 16\", 1929 in a place called Wierzbnik, which you could not find\nanymore on the map now because it has been joint to another town called Starachowice\nand renamed. It was basically incorporated. And if I know history of the town, the\nincorporation - the towns were joined in 1931, -9, just before the war, so that first these\ntowns were adjacent basically, one was sort of a factory town and the other was the\nbedroom town. Wierzbnik was the bedroom town and the Jewish community really\nresided in Wierzbnik rather than Starachowice. And I was born in Wierzbnik and, as I\nsaid before, if you want to find it on the map, you will not.

        "A: Well, basically a very carefree life, because I was a young child, and the second 1s that I\nwas sort of privileged, more than my sisters were privileged by virtue of being the\nyoungest. I was sort of the baby in the family. As you know, the third one in line\nsometimes gets mistreated by the older ones, not that I was, but I certainly was spoiled by\nmy parents because I was what you call the baby in the family, and anything around the\nidea of being privileged 1s not, does not include being spoiled; it\u2019s just being singled out\nfor being special, it\u2019s more or less. I was forever being told I was smart and I was this and\nthat and it actually served me very well in later years during the hard times because I\nalways had the idea that I really could do certain things because I was always told, \u201cWell\nyou\u2019re was smart and you do well in school.\u201d And you... So that later on I could rely on\nthis idea that was lodged in my head, which, well, today, I think they have all the\neuphemisms- self-whatever it\u2019s called today, self-appreciation, or whatever, the fact\nremains that because I was a) singled out by my parents for being a very good child and\nsmart child and for being given this, this, impetus to build on that, I think I more or less\nrelied on it in later years, I mean, you know, during the hard times, saying, well, I\nprobably could do it because I was told that I really could do it, so let me just do it. And\nthat\u2019s probably the single most important aspect of my memory of what I brought out of\nthat, of my childhood, out of my childhood.",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t tell you for sure for the reason that, you know,\nHania was always the, what you call the brilliant one in the family and she was out of\ntown, in a special high school for the gifted and whatever, and Krysia was the gorgeous,\nthe gorgeous, the beauty of the family, you know, and I had no assets, you know, I had no\nsuch things to prove. So this is another aspect of it, you know, that Hania was always\nspoken of the genius of the family, which she really was absolutely, and Krysia was\nreally strikingly beautiful, I mean, she wasn\u2019t just pretty, she was strikingly beautiful.\nAnd I\u2019m always saying this, I\u2019m repeating it forever because it\u2019s a fact, if Mother was\nwalking, let\u2019s say, in the street with Krysia, with Chris, and people would stop and\neverybody would say \u201cOh, what a beauty!\u201d And Mother said, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that because\nshe would get it into her head that she\u2019s so beautiful, she wouldn\u2019t have to make an effort\nin life.\u201d\u2019 But the fact remains that, you know, I always felt well, if my parents say I\u2019m\nsmart, I must be smart or whatever, because there was nothing to be said about me. I\nwasn\u2019t very, exactly very pretty and I don\u2019t think I was a genius, so... And I had these\nteeth, you know, my teeth were uneven sort of, and I was skinny, so that I didn\u2019t present\nanything so outstanding as to be pegged one way or another. However, you see, whether\nthis was an excuse that I took the fact that I was supposed to be smart, or whatever, I\nreally built on that idea. I absorbed it and I lived with it and I built on it, so for better or\nworse, it really, it really did come in handy in later years.",
        "A: Very, we were an extremely close family, and not just with my parents, but with my\nmother\u2019s side of the family, because they lived very near, within twenty - whether it\u2019s\ntwenty miles or twenty kilometers, I don\u2019t know. Grandmother lived in Ostrowiec, which\nis a town very near. Father\u2019s family came from Silesia from Sosnowiec, and that was\nfurther, much further out, was western Poland; whereas Starachowice and Ostrowiec\nwere in central Poland, because Mother\u2019s family came from Sandomierz, which is\nslightly to the south of Ostrowiec and Starachowice, so basically Grandma and my\nmother\u2019s family lived within the area right, you know, how far back the family went, I\ndon\u2019t know, but I do know Mother was born in Sandomierz, and subsequently the family\nlived in Ostrowiec and my mother was married in Ostrowiec. In fact, after the war, when\nI went to visit Ostrowiec - Mother used to say that she was married on the balcony - and\nwhen I went back to Ostrowiec to look at it, of course, the houses were during\nCommunist time in Poland and the building was extremely had the dilapidated look, you\nknow. The outside walls were sort of shabby and peeling but the balcony was there, it\nwas a corner balcony and Mother said they put the huppah out there, because, you know,\nmy grandfather was religious, so that, I imagine, to satisfy his requirements, the huppah\nwas outside on the balcony, and so I found, yes, that was interesting, the building is still\nthere.",
        "A: My father was, well, you know, I shouldn\u2019t be saying that, but you know they describe\nGerman Jews as Jekes. My father was basically from Silesia and brought up, under the,\nunder, you know, western Poland was occupied by Germany. You know, Poland was\npartitioned in the 18\" century, so that the western part of Poland was taken over by the\nGermans, the south was taken over by Austro-Hungary - Austria, actually - and the rest\nwas taken out by Russia. Now, my mother happened to come from the Russian quote-\nunquote zone. It\u2019s not a zone, but you know, Russian sphere of influence; whereas my\nfather, having been born in Sosnowiec and grown up in Silesia, spoke German language,\nwent to German schools and really was this very organized, straight, very precise type of\nman, which they describe as a Jeke, you know, whereas, you know, this is in no way\nderogatory, never.. What I meant to say that he was really very much German, rather than\nPolish sort of thing, but of course he spoke Polish beautifully. And he was an engineer...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, he was serious but, you know, there was a lot of singing. I remember that. There was\na lot of singing going on in the house all the time. In fact, I understand that my - whether\nmy mother only or both parents participated in - oh, you know, it wasn\u2019t what you call\nofficial, big theatre, but there were the amateur groups, because I know my mother\u2019s\nbrother, my uncle Morris - Moish - he was very much involved in amateur theatrical\ngroup and I know parents had a little contact with that, but what I do know for an\nabsolute fact is that my father always sung in the house, I mean, he loved Lehar. So,\nwhen I hear \u201cThe Merry Widow\u2019, I always, but forever, associate it with my father\nbecause all certain arias from \u201cThe Merry Widow\u201d were his absolute favorite. You could\nalways hear him sing, and my mother, too. Whether this is different now because there\nare radios and televisions and all this and there isn\u2019t much talking at home or singing\nwhatever, maybe people sing in the shower, I don\u2019t know, but I do know that there was\njust singing, as you walked around the house or whatever, you were singing and so my\nfather was one of these who really kept on singing and not for any audience; for himself.\nMother, too.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, we did.",
        "A: Yes, because, you see, singing was so natural in those days. As I said, you didn\u2019t rely on\nany outside - I mean, a circus came to town, you know, or something like that - but there\nwas never what you call, there was never a regular theater or there was never an opera. It\nwas a small town, you see, so that basically people just organized their own entertainment\nand I was too young to really know, to have even gone if there was one. I would never\nhave gone. In fact, I remember that even to go to the movies, we were, you know, the\nlaws were so strict, a child could not go to movies unless it was a Shirley Temple movie\nor something. I remember going to Shirley Temple movies, but I never ever went to the\nmovies otherwise because they wouldn\u2019t have let me in. That was, yes, and, this 1s why -\nas I said, there was no official theater or, but there was entertainment provided by people\nwho lived there and I, of course, our family being Jewish, in this particular respect, you\nshould not associate our Jewish family with the religious part of town because that was a\nlittle frowned upon, you know. We lived a more secular - not more - we did live a secular\nlife; whereas the religious Jews in town lived a totally different life, as you could see it\neven in New York these days, I mean, you go to Williamsburg, or you go to Eastern\nParkway where the Lubavitch live, and you immediately see that, if you belong to a\nreformed synagogue as we do, it really is not the way we lived life, and we still could feel\nas Jewish as they do and I\u2019m sure as deeply identified with \u201cJewishness\u201d but not\nnecessarily religious \u201cJewishness\u201d to the extent, because we are not observant and our\nhome - at home in Poland - my grandmother was very religious so in order for her to\ncome and visit, Mother had to keep a kosher home, but we were not necessarily kosher in\nany strict sense of the word.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: I think so, I really couldn\u2019t tell you, I really truly couldn\u2019t tell you. All I know 1s that\nGrandmother basically, the grandmother herself did not come from a religious family, or\nmaybe she did, because she was very well educated. And for a 19\" century woman to\nknow French and German and be fluent in languages is sort of unusual. She came from a\ngood family. But she married my grandfather, who was very religious, and then she wore\na wig. Yes, so I have one picture, which I have given to the Museum, where there\u2019s a\nfamily picture with Grandma in the middle, and you could see that she 1s wearing a\nsheitel and whether she did it because... Maybe it was an arranged marriage. I mean, I\nreally don\u2019t know. This is all speculation, but I do say that I have never known my\ngrandfather, but I was very close to my grandmother. And she used to invite one child at\nthe time, in the summer, to spend a week with her. So, she did the Baruch Atah (ph) at\nthe breakfast and she taught us how to pray at night but, you know, she felt she needed to\nsupplement what was missing in our education because we - I, personally - went to public\nschool, Polish public school, and I also went to the Tarbut Hebrew school after school,\nwhich was a Zionist organized - Mother was, you know, president of WIZO, and through\nher effort the Tarbut was organized. In fact, my sister Hania, Anna, reminded me that the\nteacher who was hired to run the Hebrew school in our town, a Mr. Wopata (ph), was\nbrought over by my mother, and he lived in our apartment, in our home, until they found\nlodgings for him. So, you see, that in no way it disparages the religious group. It\u2019s just\nthat there was a segment of population in Starachowice - Wierzbnik, meaning Wierzbnik\nbecause we are talking before the war - there was a segment of the population which was\nmore, it was secular; not detached from Judaism, but detached from the strict observance,\nbecause, you know, the religious group, the Hassidim, had their own schools for girls,\nBeth Jacob, and of course they had the heder - the heder, that goes without saying. There\nwas a heder, and there was a girl. None of us went to any of these schools, you see, so I\nwent to Polish public school and to the Hebrew Tarbut after, you know, after my school\nwas out, after my Polish school was out. So it didn\u2019t separate us from the Jewish\npopulation, but we were not part of that other life.",
        "A: Really, I couldn\u2019t tell you, but I do know a lot of people on my parents level who were, in\nfact some of them were survivors and I\u2019ve kept in touch with them, and so there were,\nyou know, they were sort of what they used to call \u201cintelligentia\u2019\u2019, which is sort of, I don\u2019t\nknow. I use the expression for the lack of better description because I don\u2019t mean in any\nway to show this group to be superior to the other group. It\u2019s just that this was the less\nobservant group, no less religious, and the fact that my mother was so extremely,\nextremely devoted to the cause of creating, you know, the Zionist movement, the...\nhelping along the pioneers who had gone to Israel, excuse me, to Palestine in those days.",
        "A: Very vivacious, extremely vivacious, quick moving, quick thinking and lively, lively,\nvery lively. Father was lively, too, but in a more serious way. Mother was very vivacious\nand the...well, her outstanding characteristic was that she was really very...altruistic isn\u2019t\nthe word, she was very concerned with others. She always did for others, one way or\nanother, she did for others, you know. There was a - I remember there was a flood,\nsomewhere in Poland, I really don\u2019t know, but I do remember that there was money being\ncollected in the community - not Jewish community - for the cause, to help the flood\nvictims. And I remember she made me a boat out of cardboard, because we went through\nthe streets for donations, and I wore that boat, now, I don\u2019t know where the flood was and\nI don\u2019t know how that was all organized. I just remember walking around with this, like a\nship made out of cardboard with , you know, and people would put in coins and\nthat was the collection, so in retrospect when I think about it, and you know, all this idea\nof the Jewish population living parallel lives with the Polish populations but not mingling\ndoesn\u2019t always hold true, because I\u2019m sure this was not a Jewish flood, and I still don\u2019t\nknow where the flood was, but I do distinctly remember as a child walking around with\nthis boat, where people, it was like on a ribbon, you know, I had it attached on a ribbon,\nand people would put in money for the flood victims. So you see, to me, that is, this is\nalready an indication that people who claim that there was absolutely no connection\nbetween the Christian Poles and the Jewish Poles doesn\u2019t hold true because, in our\npersonal lives, I know for a fact that we were very close to Christians, to Christian\nfamilies, some of whom saved our lives later on, but that\u2019s another story. But when we\ntalk about the flood, this is a general, a more general overview of things, and much as\nthere was anti-Semitism on another kind of level, but there had to be coexistence, that,\nyou know, supplied some kind of a living arrangement if nothing else, so... but of course\nwe got off the subject, I don\u2019t know how, we did...",

I don\u2019t know if it was a machine, but anyhow I found that it\nwas the figuration, not a figuration, assessments of forestry, because he used to travel to\neastern parts of Poland, where there were heavy forests, virgin forests and he would\nassess, you know, he would assess the forest for the lumber industry and that was\nengineering and - I - it was engineering for which there was another Polish word, but I\ndon\u2019t know the English word, but that was his occupation. He was, as I told you, he was\neducated in the German language and I imagine German in those days carried a heavy\nweight in the scientific field, so he, I\u2019m sure he had an easy life, easy time of it, you\nknow.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: No, no, those were short trips, because, you know, he was basically employed by, in\ntown. There was a sawmill owned by Jews, I think they were, I never knew, but I think\nthey were from Vienna, or somewhere but the name was Heller because everybody talked\nabout the Heller sawmill. In fact, Hania reminded me that subsequently when the sawmill\nwas taken over by the Germans, there were Jews from our town who did slave labor in\nthe sawmill which somehow or other I didn\u2019t exactly, you know... I only remember the\nfactory, the munitions factory, in relation to the labor camps, because I\u2019m getting a little\nbit ahead of myself, but I always think of war production in the munitions factory, but\nbasically the sawmill was also a war production, if you really want to put it in it\u2019s proper\nperspective, I mean, they certainly weren\u2019t building, doing lumber for Jews to build\nhouses or anything like that, so that goes without saying.",
        "A: No, but we were well to do, but not until just before the war. That was, you know, during\nthe depression, the Heller\u2019s I think sold it, or whatever it was, they sold it or they gave it\nup, I don\u2019t know, but I know that Father lost the position and then we had very hard times\nbut so did everybody else.",
        "A: Well I mean, if you look at the old pictures, and you they traveled to the Baltic sea to the\nSopot. My parents have a lot of pictures from, had a lot of pictures from that. I also know\nthat Mother had severe arthritis and she used to go for cure, for six-week cure and that\nwas another very wonderful experience because she always took at least one of us. And I\nstill have pictures that were sent to us from Palestine, from Israel, from friends of\nMother\u2019s who had those pictures from Sopot and had pictures from Busko Zdroj which\nwas that, that, no, spa and I remember going with Mother. In other words, what happened\nis one kid went to Grandma and two kids went with Mother to Busko Zdroj and the six\nweeks that Mother had treatments there, of course, generally weakened her a lot. So,\nwhen we would come back, we would go in the country, you know, on a farm, on\nsomebody\u2019s farm and we would stay a week so Mother could recover, and I imagine that\nyou couldn\u2019t well afford, if you couldn\u2019t afford to go to Busko Zdroj every year. In fact,\nyou know, during the war when everything was closed off for Jews, meaning we couldn\u2019t\ntravel, we couldn\u2019t go to school and such and such, of course, Mother could not go, I\nmean, not that we could afford it, but you know, but I\u2019m saying that because she no\nlonger was able to go for her treatments, which was sulfur by the way, sulfur baths, and\nshe suffered terribly, she... her arthritis was much worse because, of course, she, she had\nno way of curing, I mean not curing, you don\u2019t cure arthritis, but alleviating the pain. And\nBusko Zdroj was a very interesting place for a child because the baths were within a park,\nyou see. It was, of course, you could not, this was not a public park, and they had a band\nshell and they had music - opera, arias - and to this day when I hear Tosca, I remember\nsitting in Busko Zdroj in front of the band shell listening to the music, yes, it was very\nnice. And, and we stayed in a hotel, which was very nearby, because you don\u2019t need to\ncross the road, whatever, street, to go into the park for the baths, and I used to go and\nobject to the smell because, you know, sulfur smells like rotten eggs. And I would go\nwith mother and I would hear the sound when they set up - they used to call it mud, you\nknow, those were mud baths basically, so you would - they would turn - there was always\nan attendant and then I sat out in a like vestibule type, or whatever it was, but I wasn\u2019t\ninside, but I would hear when the sound came out \u201cbloto\u201d - that means mud, mud was\ncoming - and you know, and I know what they did. The person would be, Mother would\nbe in a bathtub, the mud would fill 1t, they would put a wooden crate over the bathtub,\nand throw a sheet over it, so that she was submerged in that hot sulfur mud, after which\nthe attendant would take her for a shower and then they would massage her, whatever, on\nthe table like, then we would go home - she had to go to bed. Those were crude, very\nheavy-handed treatments, but they were good.",
        "A: Yes, because during the war she was really sick. She couldn\u2019t go anymore, you know,\nsince Busko was very near Kielce and that required traveling, and there was no traveling\nfor Jews.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Pll tell you right away, from a viewpoint of the family type, they really liked me a lot,\nbut I was never included. This is...",
        "A: This is... I probably should now refer back to what I started at the beginning, that my\nparents, sort of, I always felt my parents took pity on me. So they said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re\nsmarter than everybody,\u201d and such, true or false. I mean, I took it for the truth, but the\nfact remains that I wasn\u2019t to bother, to bother, to bother them, because they were already\nolder. I was just to, to be around my parents. So, if you went somewhere, my parents took\nme along. If they went somewhere, you know, I tagged along. And I even have a picture\nsomebody sent me from Connecticut. His parents had a New Year\u2019s Eve party and you\ncan see my parents and his parents, some other people and there\u2019s wine on the table, and\nin the middle of everything, I\u2019m the only kid sitting there. I\u2019m a little kid, a scrawny, little\nkid, meaning it really reinforces my memory that I tagged along, even though whether I\nenjoyed it or not, I couldn\u2019t say, but I do know that I was the special child, so to say, so\nthey took me everywhere, but of course the truth was that they had to take me. [Laughs. |",
        "A: Right, yes.",
        "A: Yes. The reason 1s, I think that Chris is, first of all she is the middle child, you know. She\nwas always very independent, Krysia was always very independent, you know, hands on,\nthis and that. I was sort of a kid type of, that you had to look after. So Chris - maybe she\nfelt I was a burden, if she wanted to go and have some friends, have some good times\nwith her friends, why would she bother looking after the kid, if I fell or if I didn\u2019t fall of\nwhatever? You know, but of course, we loved each other. As you very well know, we are\nthe closest family that there is, that there ever was, and that wasn\u2019t even because we went\nthrough the war together, that we were bound by common horrible experience. But\nbecause the family was such, that we really were one, even though - and you know, I\nnever felt slighted, you know. I just knew that, if I\u2019m going to have a good time, it\u2019s\ngoing to be with my parents or with my own peers but certainly not with Chris and Miles,\nand that was even true during the war, not, why did I say? Miles, I didn\u2019t say Miles, I\ndidn\u2019t mean Miles. I meant Chris and Hania. That was even true during the war when the\nrefugees from Lodz were sent in. You know, there was a group of Jews sent into our\nghetto. And immediately the quote \u201cgolden youth of Lodz\u201d ended up in the circle of\nHania and Chris. And they would read poetry, and Byron, Lord Byron in translation and\nall this. I sat in the same room, but certainly not within the circle. I heard it, I was a non-\nparticipant observer. I was somewhere in the room, but I was not of the group, I was with\nthe group, you see? But that did not in any way preclude the terrific devotion that my\nsister had shown me, because I know for a fact there were instances during the war that I\nwas a goner, and had it not been for them, I would never ever have survived. So, you see,\nwhen push came to shove, and of course - but even without that, you know, you study\nkids in the family...you know, some kids... Maybe they felt my that parents protected\nme, so they didn\u2019t need to bother.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Absolutely, I mean this was really, almost an obsession. This is how I became a\ntranslator, because it\u2019s so easy for me to pick up words and think words. And when I\ncame to America, I had no knowledge of English, but having known some French and\nLatin before and having fooled around with these big words - you see, Polish vocabulary\ncontains a lot of words out of Latin, you know - so later on, I - because I really was crazy\nabout words as a child, and of course quite often I used to misuse them, you know,\nmisuse them, but I still used them, wrong or right or whatever; I stuck them in wherever I\ncould. And this is why I had such an easy time with English, because it was really a\nmatter of hearing the pronunciation and learning spelling. But if I read it to myself\nquietly, I could make out the text, because, you see, I have found the similarities with the\nother languages, and the fact that somehow or other, my mind was oriented to words,\nwhatever. So that is true, she is absolutely right.",
        "A: I\u2019m 10 years old, no, not in Germany...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I sensed something, but I\u2019ve said it so often now, and it truly is a fact, I really\ndidn\u2019t know very much, I don\u2019t really know, and I keep saying it, I mean, it\u2019s repetition\nnow until you can\u2019t take it anymore, but the fact is I don\u2019t know what my parents knew\nand when they knew it. And I certainly knew that times were rough; I knew that\nsomething was happening in Germany. But I also knew that there was a famine in China,\nyou know, so - because there was a famine in China in the 30s, I think - so that I knew\nthat there was famine in China and I knew there was something going on in Germany, but\nhow that related to my personal life or to us, it was sort of far-fetched. I did begin, during\nthe economic times, I did begin to feel certain pressures, and I did begin to feel certain\nanti-Semitic, well, direct anti-Semitic references to who we were, but that was not on any\nscale - because as a child, you know, a child can call you a Jew and he can call you baldy\nand he can call you any kind rotten name, and if you can rationalize to yourself within\nthat context, you know how kids fight, and... So, I was aware of a certain change in\natmosphere in Poland because I do know now from studying history that there was a\nwave of anti-Semitism that was extremely, to the naked eye, it was easy to see, because,\nyou know, when I translated - I was working on Korchuk (ph) a lot, Korchuk\u2019s writing,\nand I translated his works - I realized that his only, the only reason for his being removed\nfrom the position of the good doctor, who read poetry and talked about child upbringing\non the radio in the 30s, that he was removed from that position only because of anti-\nSemitism. He was a very progressive educator, as you know, and a very enlightened man\nand he was a Jew, of course, by birth, but he was very Polish in his upbringing and\noutlook, not Christian, but Polish, and he brought all these new ideas to Poland, because\nhe studied in England, you know, and he brought the new ideas, the new approach to\nchild upbringing, because he also wrote stories for children, you know. He wrote books\nabout children and books for children. And he would read and they would call him the\n\u201cold doctor\u2019, and I know, I used to listen to the old doctor, but then I didn\u2019t hear the old\ndoctor. In those days, I didn\u2019t know, but I now know, that the program - that he was\nremoved from the radio program only because he was Jew, because the anti-Semitic, the\nwave of anti-Semitism has progressed to the point where, toward the outbreak of the war,\nit was really almost palpable. And all this happened, you know, after Pilsudski died,\nMarshall Pilsudski, who died in 1935, had the idea of a federal, federalist state, Poland\nbeing, including minorities and such. And after he died - of course all this I know now\nfrom studying history - that those who opposed him so strenuously were of the national\nright-wing party, and they came into prominence in the late 30s, so that the wave of anti-\nSemitism, which actually was given freer reign, could basically come to the fore. You\nknow, they, maybe they weren\u2019t encouraged, but they weren\u2019t stopped.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I experienced - you know, I have spoken about this several times. I have experienced a\nfew, a few such - well, it was an incident or it was rather a sort of a one-two-three kind of\na happening. For example, I had - I went to school. I don\u2019t know if it was 1938 or \u00b039,\nfirst day of school, and I had a new teacher.",
        "A: Before the war, probably it was 19- No, I didn\u2019t go to school in 1939 because September\nis when the war broke out. So, it had to be 1938. And I went to school and this was a\nmale teacher. And he said, \u201cI would like every child to stand up, and tell me his name,\u201d\nyou know, so that he could acquaint himself. When I stood up, and I said, \u201cMy name is\nRegina Laks,\u201d he looked up at me and said, \u201cYour name is not Regina. You go home to\nyour mother and tell her that your name is Rivka.\u201d (ph) Well, I was so hurt by it, I never\nforgot it. I always talk about it, always, always, because I was so very hurt by it.\nApparently, I have already been feeling other things around me, but they were not as\npersonal, in front of a class, with brand new kids. That was one incident that remained\nwith me for a life, for the life, and another was a new family came to live in my\nneighborhood, and I got very friendly with a girl - her name was Kaya (ph), very lovely,\nlovely. They were educated people, and we used to play a lot. She used to come to my\nhouse; I used to go to her house. And then around Passover, and I don\u2019t know what year\nthat was. that could have been maybe 1937, because I was a little kid yet, maybe.\nAnyhow, so I said, \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go home and play in my house.\u201d And she said, \u201cNo, I\ncan\u2019t go to play in your house. My mother said not to go because it\u2019s Passover and the\nJews take blood from the children for Passover.\u201d You see, that was a child who probably\nwasn\u2019t anymore than 7 or 8 years old. So, those two very personal, very personal,\nencounters stayed with me for a lifetime. But, as I was saying, I still felt part of the\nenvironment that I grew up in. I never felt that the Christians were against me or that I\nwas against them. I could only see the difference between the Hassidim who didn\u2019t mix at\nall and didn\u2019t want to mix, and the Polish population. But as far as I was concerned, I\nreally felt very much at home and, you know, we spoke Polish only at home. My parents\nknew Yiddish and spoke it to each other if they didn\u2019t want us to know. Of course, my\nfather spoke German very well, and Mother spoke Russian by virtue of growing up 1n,\nunder the Russian sphere of influence. But aside from that, Polish was the language. And,\nin fact, a lot of Christians were surprised that we spoke without an accent which is\nprobably - with a subtext, with a hidden subtext, you know, when you got a compliment,\n\u201cOh, my goodness, you speak Polish so well!\u2019\u2019 Of course, there was a subtext, not that I\nknew it then but I know it now. In other words, I was not supposed to speak Polish so\nwell and without an accent by virtue of being Jewish. But really that didn\u2019t bother me in\nthe sense, in any way. I took it as a compliment; I took it as a fact, you see, and I\u2019ve\nnever felt in any way angry at the Poles or blaming them or, or I never, any animosity. I\nmean, they were people to me, dear people, and those especially who were very dear to\nmy parents were very dear to us. And I certainly had wonderful friends among the\nChristian children, so that, that issue never came up. And when those two incidents came,\nI took them as separate and detached from the bigger picture, you know, it was on a\nsmaller scale, kids\u2019 stuff",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Very humiliated, I was not angry. I was... He put me to shame, because my name really\nwas not Rivka. It so happens, if you want to, you know, give a child a Jewish name, it is\nRivka - because Regina is really Rivka - but I was never, in Tarbut, in the Hebrew school,\nI had the name Regina then was Rivka and, but I was never ever - I was either Regina or\nRenia, I was never Rivka and to be singled out like this, I don\u2019t know. I - school was very\ndear to me always, and school was everything to me, and I was always good in school, so\nI felt always elevated and wonderful about the school experience. And this was a very\nharsh and very humiliating kind of experience because I by then knew what it was that he\nwas trying to say. He didn\u2019t care about me. He perhaps wanted to imply that I was\ncamouflaging my Jewishness. Because you see, I did not go to the Jewish school; I went\nto the public school. And there weren\u2019t too many of us, but there were kids, most\ncertainly. So, I sort of felt that I was being humiliated for no reason, and not because I\ncould analyze it in depth. It\u2019s just that I knew that Rivka wasn\u2019t my name. Regina - if you\nlooked, as I said at the beginning, if you looked at any kind of my legal papers or\notherwise, records or whatever, it\u2019s always Regina, not Renia, and its not Rivka, it\u2019s\nreally Regina - so that this was my name, I was born and given this name. So that, that\nwas a double humiliation, as if I were really telling a lie or something on one hand, or\nmaybe I was trying to camouflage something which was not the case.",
        "A: Oh yes, certainly, yes, children, absolutely",
        "A: Not in this particular instance. I don\u2019t know, he must have, I don\u2019t know, just me.",
        "A: No, and I went home and I told Mother. I said, \u201cHe told me to tell you that this is not my\nname.\u201d Mother says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d And what was done about it, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, no, he had to call me Regina because that was in the record. But Mother did feel the\nhumiliation I suffered and she said, \u201cAh, doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s not a big deal,\u2019 whatever it\nwas, but I never forgot it. So, it absolutely stayed with me all these years and, you know,\nChris and Hania, I don\u2019t even know if they know about it, 1n the sense of... I had a few\nincidents in my life, including the German, the war. There were certain little incidents\nthat hurt so much, that were totally insignificant on a larger scale, but somehow, you\nknow, I guess it\u2019s how you, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what is important to you in life or\nwhatever.",
        "A: Yes, but those, yeah, those two things I never forgot, the one with the Rivka and with the\nJews, blood for the matzos.",
        "A: No, nothing!",
        "A: Nothing, I said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t want to come? That\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t want to come.\u201d So,\nshe said, \u201cOkay, you come after the holidays.\u201d",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They said nothing, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to play with her because she\u2019s new.\u201d You\nknow, so they said, \u201cWell, you know she\u2019s new.\u201d You see, this is the whole point. Our\nparents, especially with regards to me - I cannot speak for Chris and I cannot speak for\nAnna, Hania, I cannot speak for them - because I was really truly protected. Anything\nthat ever happened was somehow smoothed over. \u201cOh, she said that she\u2019s new here.\nAnyhow, you don\u2019t have to play with her.\u201d You know, \u201cHe told you that your name 1s\nlike this? You know that\u2019s not true, you know you have your own name and that\u2019s what it\nis.\u201d So that, there, things were always smoothed over in a way where they shouldn\u2019t\nbother me, but some of course did bother me and they stayed with me obviously.",
        "A: Well, I know my parents were very sociable. They always had company and such, but I\nreally don\u2019t remember, no, I don\u2019t remember. As I said, I do, did know something going\non with the German Jews and I knew there was famine in China. I knew that, but this,\nthose were such big issues and I was not ever invited to share this kind of conversation,\nyou know, so I guess between that and being protected, it really ended up by my being\ntotally oblivious to the realities of the late 30s.",
        "A: Well, I would, I would listen, yes, but you know, somehow it sort of went in and out, you\nknow.",
        "A: Yeah, the Germans, yeah, yeah. That was, I mean, it was not a shock, because they were\nalready talking about the war, there\u2019s gonna be a war, but of course the larger part of it I\nreally didn\u2019t know. I just knew that the Germans were invading and there were anti-\naircraft trenches being dug and all this thing - the youth, mobilize the youth to dig the\ntrenches. I wasn\u2019t invited.",
        "A: So, I wasn\u2019t invited, but I do know there is going to be a war. Why the Germans were\nplanning on a war, I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know anything except for the fact that, when,\nwhen, Father was, what you call, they had civilians for anti-aircraft, what you call... a\ncivilian force for alert, you know, so my father was a captain for the block, or whatever\nyou call it. And he used to go to briefings to say when, you know, and then the sirens\nwould wail. So, Father went to briefing and he came home and he said there\u2019s going to be\na, a bombardment and they are going to be bombarding Starachowice because there is\nthis factory here, this munitions factory, and the town 1s ordered to evacuate. You see, so\nthen I knew the war was on. Now, that had to be very early September. The war broke\nout on the first, on the western part, so maybe this was the fourth or fifth or something\nlike this, but first week of the war. And we were told to evacuate, I mean, not were told -\neverybody, all the precinct captains spread the word, and everybody was to head for the\nforest. There were woods, you know, surrounding the area. So, we did as told and\neverybody was going toward the forest. And Mother made sure that we got dressed very\nwell, that we wore the best...this always amazes, amuses me because this was around the\nholidays, you know, the Jewish holidays. I got a pair of brand new shoes, so Mother says,\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best thing to do is to wear the best clothes and to have enough, because God\nknows when we\u2019ll come back and you might as well have the good stuff rather than the\nold stuff, right?\u201d So, I put on a pair of brand new shoes which were never broken in, and\nafter, later on when we came back, I had blisters on the feet. [Laughs.] Anyhow, we had\nto get dressed in more than one thing because, in case, when we come back and there\u2019s\nno house left, we had to have something. This was the hottest September on record. So,\nwe ended up in the woods outside...",
        "A: I had a few layers of clothes and the new shoes, brand new shoes, which I never wore. I\nwas going to wear them for the holidays. So that we ended up in the woods.",
        "A: Yes, right, not so much of value. Mother took sugar, yes, and I remember she had the\nsalami kind of a thing she took there, because we did not know where we were going or\nwhat we\u2019ll be doing, and whatever you could wear, that\u2019s the good stuff, you wore.",
        "A: I forgot, that, maybe we did, maybe, maybe...could be that we did.",
        "A: Personally?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. I only remember the two things, that 1t was extremely hot and I\nhad bad blisters on my feet because we ended up in the forest, in the words, mixed in\nwith the, not just with the population of Wierzbnik, Starachowice, but all the peasants\nwho lived in the surrounding area also evacuated and they basically took their horses and\ncows and dogs and so on. So you had this cacophony of sounds, the cows, and of course,\nI like to tell the story, of this, this sort of a joke on us type of incident. The factory, as you\nknow, was smelting ore, because there was ore in the area, and they were doing, it was\ndoing already war production, because in Starachowice, where the factory was, the plant,\nwas located in a district called the central [says name in Polish] the central industrial area,\nthat was organized for Poland after the first war, to arm themselves because they felt, you\nknow, now that Poland was independent since 1918, they had to be armed. Well, they\nlocated these factories, the plants, in this central Poland area that had iron ore deposits, so\nthere was ore smelting and such, so the rationale was such that in the first war, the first\nthing that was really destroyed were all the munition factories and all this. By virtue of\nthis historic truth, all you could expect is smithereens in our town, so that everybody\nevacuated because if not, you were going to be wiped off the earth together with the\nfactory, you see. And we found ourselves in the woods, with all that as I told you, the\nmixture of the Hassidim and the secular Jews and the Christians and the peasants and the\ncows and the dogs and the horses. Meanwhile, the Germans came very close by. There\nwas no bombing, no significant bombing on Starachowice, because obviously they were\ngoing to take over that factory in a blink of an eye, which they did. And we got caught in\na valley - \u2018we\u2019 meaning the entire mixture of everybody - we were caught in the valley.\nThe Germans were on the one - you know, I come from a hilly, it\u2019s not mountainous area,\nbut hilly, the Swietokrzyskie (ph) mountains are not far from us, but this is hilly area - so\nthat you had the Germans on one side of the valley, you had the Polish troops on the\nother, and they shot at each other while we were in the valley, so that one horrendous\nnight, when all the bullets were flying, we were right in the middle. And of course, the\nGermans in those days, and I know this for a fact, many more times from this one...\n[Tape cut off. ]\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: Yes, at the group caught in the valley - townspeople and the peasants from the\nsurrounding areas - and of course that was real, true, naked warfare, that\u2019s what that was,\nbecause eventually, I hate to say that, but I do know that there was bayonet warfare going\non, and that was my first real true awakening to what was happening.",
        "A: Scared to...that was a night of total fear. I mean, you know, later on, because I didn\u2019t\nknow fear, how, how extensive and how fierce fear can be, but that one night was the first\nexperience in my life of acute fear. I didn\u2019t know whether we would ever make it,\nbecause we were not just in the crossfire, we were also being shot at from the airplanes.\nBut all this went on until the morning. At dawn, of course, everybody went back to town.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, we, I remember there were, the peasants had carts, you know, a cart with the\nhorse, and I remember everybody was hiding under carts, you know, because they could\nsee, and as I said before, the Germans, they didn\u2019t see us. They could hear because there\nwas all that barking and baying and, and whatever other animal sounds you could hear,\nand even if the people were quiet. You cannot quiet an animal when he sees, when he\nhears shooting, so that gave us away. And the funny thing is - I just remembered\nsomething - at daylight, at daybreak, we sort of scattered from the area, and then the\nplanes came again, and I ran over - everybody said, \u201cRun under the bushes.\u201d So, you\nknow there were trees and bushes, because we stayed in the forest. The valley was sort of\na clearing, it was in the clearing, but surrounding was the forest. So, I ran over as fast as I\ncould and I grabbed a tree. Well, it wasn\u2019t a tree! This was a Polish soldier! Because, you\nknow, they had olive drab uniforms, green, type of green. And, of course, in the panic, I\nmean, everything, so I - the thing moved, the tree could move. Well, I look up and there\nwas the soldier, but that was more as a, you know, I thought I probably felt good about it\nbecause he was going to protect me, you know, whereas everything else was naked fear.\nAnd subsequently when we went home - this is also very important, I think I\u2019ve already\nmentioned it - the town was not bombed, absolutely not bombed, and that was, with I\u2019m\nsure by design. So that eventually when everybody got settled back and it was now\nofficial that the Germans have occupied Poland, the factory was taken over and converted\nto heavy war machinery and, whereas before the war, Jews were not employed in that\nplant, now Jews were beginning to be taken in as a labor force. Now this is just the mere\nbeginning, because eventually, of course, the Jewish labor force was the primary force,\nbecause it was slave labor and it didn\u2019t - they had to pay the Poles. So, I really, I'm not an\nauthority on it, but I would suspect that the professional engineers or whoever it is in that\nwar industry, were retained and perhaps these unskilled workers, maybe the Christians,\ncould have been dismissed, so that Jewish slave labor was hired. Because subsequently - I\ndon\u2019t mean right now at the outbreak of the war - but subsequently, not only would the\nJews start working as a force, labor force, in the factory, while there was still a ghetto,\nbut once the ghetto was liquidated, there was a labor camp set up just to supply workers\nto the factory and, since there were always typhus and there were shootings and killings\nand Jews were just disposed of here and there, there was forever a new shipment arriving\nof workers. Now, what the specific number was of workers of workers, I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe 2,000, but I know that the number stayed as was, because they had all these\nassigned spaces, I imagine. So that the slave labor was already in full operation shortly\nafter the outbreak of the war, but later, when the camp was set up, they kept the number -\nbecause you know the Jews, the town was cleared of Jews, so they had no more, no more\npeople in Starachowice to supply for the labor force, but they did bring them in from all\nover everywhere.",
        "A: Yes, I absolutely do! You know, it was hot summer, and we came - in fact, when we left\nin the morning, we didn\u2019t clear the table, because it was such a rush, and we had to get\ndressed, and we had to pack up, and Dad said, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, we\u2019ve got to move\nbecause the bombs are going to fall any minute and the whole town is just going to be in\nashes, and we\u2019ve got to get out,\u201d So, we left everything. We came back, there were flies\nrunning all over, all the dishes were on the table, and I don\u2019t really remember but,\nwhatever there was yet, I\u2019m sure, you know, my mother must have kept stuff in her\nsupply cupboards or whatever. So, I don\u2019t know that we experienced starvation when we\ngot back, because it took awhile - you know, that was basically the German, the concept\nof eliminating the Jews by any way you could, so it\u2019s by starvation, or by shooting or\nwhichever. But that did not enter the picture. You came home and whatever you had in\nyour cupboards - and I imagine my mother must have stocked up on things because the\ntalk of war was so prevalent. The only thing is that, you see, this is modern warfare - I\nmean, not by today\u2019s standards, when you have atomic weapons and such - in those days,\nthat was modern warfare, but as you know even when you study sociology, they tell you,\n\u201cFirst things happen, then culture and the way of living adapts itself to what\u2019s\nhappening.\u201d Now, when the second war broke out, people like my parents, who survived,\nwho went through the first war, applied the reasoning of the first war to the new\nexperience of another war. In other words, what was true then should be applied now, and\nthis is how you are going to manage this new event. But of course that was as far from\nthe truth as it could be, because the warfare in the first war was not the same, the\nblitzkrieg itself, you know, the airplanes and all, that was the - I mean, the Germans\noccupied Poland I don\u2019t know how many, five days something like that - so who... in the\nfirst, in the first war, there was no such thing. There was, there were battles fought hand\nto hand, and this is why the bayonet fight, that I heard later, that was sort of unusual\nbecause it didn\u2019t fit the picture, but we did hear it at night when they said they were\nfighting with bayonets. It could be that was also hearsay because, yes, people would\nexpect that, judging by the first war.",
        "A: Yes, the first and foremost, I didn\u2019t go to school. That was first. Number two, there is a\nriver runs through Starachowice, Wierzbnik its called Kamienna, it\u2019s a tributary of the\nVistula. Now, we used to go swim in the river. We had a little dog and he used to go, we\nhad a maid, she loved that dog, so she - we would go swimming and she would soap up\nthe dog in a bucket and throw him in the river, and then would go after the dog in the\nriver. Anyhow, so number one, there was no school. It was very hot, September was very\nhot - couldn\u2019t go swimming. Then you started seeing - the Germans were marching\nthrough the town, all the time, in formation, they sung. You know, they were always\nmarching wearing those boots and singing. And very soon, there were these - I cannot say\nwhether it was Gestapo, SS or whoever - they started coming around in these little\ngroupings, individuals, two Nazis or three Nazis, with a dog or two dogs, so that\nimmediately put a stop to my even going outside to play. So, all the things that were dear\nto me, starting with school, number one, were now out, certainly couldn\u2019t go Ostrowiec\nto visit Grandma because travel was out. So, I probably didn\u2019t understand the larger\npicture of what was involved, but I certainly knew on a more personal basis that things\nare completely different and that whatever is happening is not good. That much, I mean, I\ncould see.",
        "A: Yes, exactly, the Christian people, yes. Well, the point is, eventually, I mean, I don\u2019t\nknow, 10\" of September, 31\u00b0 of, 31\u00b0 of October or whenever, the schools were open and\nthe children went back to school, but we didn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t that the schools were closed. The\nschools were closed to Jewish children. So, that was the first and immediate, so to say,\nblow to my...to me. And whatever other bigger things that were happening, I was\noblivious of that because nobody told me. As I\u2019ve said so many times, my parents were\nso protective that I never really knew the full truth until the war was over and I started\nreading up on things that I found out what really went on. I just knew that nothing was\ngood anymore, and certainly I couldn\u2019t go to school, so that was a big blow.",
        "A: No, no, she was Christian, she was Christian.",
        "A: Well, this is, this is an interesting story. I always talk about my dog, I loved him!",
        "A: Ledy.",
        "A: Ledy , I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s meant to be Lady or Ledy or whatever, but we called\nhim Ledy. And it was a birthday present for one of us. My father brought him in a packet.\nHe was a tiny little pup, all white, a Spitz, and my father - I forgot who\u2019s birthday it was\nbut that was a birthday present - and he was a very lovely, beautiful white dog but you\nhad to brush him all the time, and the maid adored him, her name was Genia (ph).\nAnyhow, shortly before the war, he became vicious. What happened, we had, my mother,\nmy grandmother, from Ostrowiec had a cousin by the name of Pfeffer (ph). They were\nvery well-to-do Jews in Ostrowiec, and her son - her sons had all the motor vehicles that\nwere good in 1939 - her son, one son had a Ford and one son had a motorcycle, and he\ncame running through Starachowice on his motorcycle and had an accident and ended up\nin the hospital, in the Starachowice hospital. He was from Ostrowiec his name was\nPfeffer (ph), the last name, but I don\u2019t know his first name. Well, anyhow, the mother\nimmediately came, stayed with us, and she cooked for him. She started cooking all these\nexquisite dishes, and he wouldn\u2019t eat, because he was laid up in the hospital - I don\u2019t\nknow he had broken bones - she would bring it back and feed it to the dog. Now, the dog\nwas on a very strict, whatever. This dog started eating all these fancy things. Anyhow,\nthis is the story I was told why he became vicious. One day, a woman was passing by -\nbecause there was a big courtyard, you know, in European houses, you had a gate, like a\nbig gate you went through, and there was a courtyard - a woman was coming through the\ncourtyard, he was barking to get out, he jumped on the handle, however, he got himself\nout of the house, ran over and tore the woman\u2019s skirt up front, a whole big chunk of skirt.\nWell, after that, of course, my parents had to pay for the clothes and so on, but he was\ntaken to a farm, so we had to give him away, because he was unmanageable. I always\nknew that he was spoiled by that food, but maybe not, I don\u2019t know. But anyhow, so we\ndidn\u2019t have the dog. As for the maid, she lived way out, at the outskirts of the town, with\nan old mother. And she was a maid for my parents from way back, I mean, way, way,\nlike when Hania was a baby, because we have pictures from the Baltic sea and such, she\nsits there, Genia (ph) sits with Hania, you know, we see her in pictures, we saw her in\npictures a lot. Anyhow, she lived in the outskirts of the city, and subsequently she turned\nout to be one of those who did not prove herself to be a true friend, because she took\nthings from us during the war that Mother wanted to give her to save, like a sewing\nmachine, you know, things of value, and she absolutely denied. When Chris and Hania\nwent back to Poland and went to see her, she had drapes, velvet, green velvet drapes, and\nbedspreads to match, it was hanging and she said she didn\u2019t have it. My mother had a box\nof china that was in perfect condition that she took. She denied it; it was right there. And\nshe, I think she said she was going to denounce them, Chris and Hania, you know,\nbecause you know Chris and Hania went back to Starachowice and there was this horrible\nincident that night, and the Paliszewskis saved their life. So, you right away have this\nbalance, you can balance this, whether Genia (ph) was greed, it was pure greed, or\nwhether it was other motivation, I don\u2019t know, but she was member of the family for\nyears, I mean, many years, so that she did not prove to be a friend, as good a friend as she\nought to have been, because she was treated very well by the family. But of course the\nothers, the Paliszewskis, they were people who saved our lives and such. So, you can see\nthere is never a one answer to this kind of a problem. This is why I\u2019ve always felt that, as\nmuch as you want to remember personal incidents, the true picture to me of living in\nPoland as a Jewish person is not of one of animosity to the others, you just, you have to\nhave that understanding because always for one example, you will always find another\nexample to counterbalance that, and this is exactly how I have felt right along and not\nmany people feel that way, I know.",
        "A: Yes, this is how it was, and people from my hometown, very much so. I don\u2019t know if\nyou know that I was involved with the restoration of the cemetery in Starachowice, and\nwhen I originally brought up the subject - later I went to Poland in 1980 and we went to\nthe cemetery with the Paliszewski\u2019s granddaughter, she took us there - we took pictures\nof the cemetery itself and of different tombstones which were, of course, overturned and\novergrown and whatever. I really don\u2019t read Yiddish, so I couldn\u2019t tell whose tombstones\nthey were. Nobody from our family is buried there. Anyhow, when I came back and\nVictor made large size, you know he blew up the photo - we had them made into large\nphotographs and I took them to the Starachowice reunion, at the annual . Well,\nI was practically attacked by some. They told me, \u201cRenia, you should be ashamed of\nyourself. How you even think of having to, that we should restore something to give\nmoney to them. They never did anything for us. They would take the money, they\nwouldn\u2019t do it, anyhow.\u201d This 1s a project that started in 1980 and it was only realized ten\nyears ago, because I finally realized there were people of good will who decided those\nwho feel that way do not have to participate, and we did, and we did through the right\nchannels and with the right money and everything is done. In fact, I just wrote an\nintroduction to the book that\u2019s coming out about the cemetery, and I was very fortunate to\nhave it registered with one of the people from my hometown who were dear friends of\nmy family, Pola Frank (ph). She is no longer alive; she was my teacher in Poland. In then\nlast minute, we registered the Jewish cemetery in New York with a Jewish organization -\nI don\u2019t know the name of it. The building is right across Temple Emanuelle on 5\"\nAvenue, 65th Street. I think there was a Rabbi Chaiar (ph), or Chaiat (ph) somebody.\nAnd we came in, and said we don\u2019t have the funds yet, but we\u2019d very much like to have\nthis on - they were submitting a list to the Polish government of Jewish cemeteries - in\nthe nick of time, he said next week or next day, whatever, they were going to submit. We\ngot the name in. So, immediately, within a year, there was a sign posted that this is a\nhistoric landmark not to be touched. But it took us a number, a good number of years to\nrealize that we should not wait around or take the criticism of our hometown people for,\nto prevent us from doing the project. And between Israel and Canada and us, we had the\nmoney in no time. We send - it was done through Israel: the money was sent in, the\narchitect was found, the caretakers were found. Apparently, that cemetery in\nStarachowice 1s now the model restored cemetery. But you see, this, I said that in\nreference to how other people felt. Not only did they feel terrific animosity to the Poles\nduring all that went on, because, you know, a lot of people felt that the Poles did not do\nfor Jews what they could have. But, you see, even after the war, for something as terribly\nimportant as a Jewish cemetery in a town that had all this population obliterated, there\nisn\u2019t a sign that there was Jewish community there except for the cemetery, and that was\nmy project from the beginning, Pola Frank (ph) and I were saying: Here you have the\npictures, here is what it looks like, the houses were being built on the cemetery, first the\nGermans took the tombstones to pave roads, then the Poles brought their homes closer\nand closer. Give it a few more years and you would have nothing, so that we were very\nlucky that, against all the criticism, we went ahead and because we worked in cooperation\nwith Israel and Canada, we were really able to do it. And now I\u2019m so pleased about that.\nThis is really something, you know, second generation people go to visit, and other\npeople from Israel, and I was told that even the people who do oversee now, you know,\nwhoever oversees the Jewish cemeteries in Poland, says that ours is the nicest, the best\nkept and so forth. The stones are upright, the lettering was done, it\u2019s cleaned up, beautiful\nfence, iron fence with a beautiful gate with the magendavit (ph) on it, very nice, very\nnice.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: A little school developed, right! And Hania, of course, was the main force behind it\nbecause she was the family genius - she had all the books. In fact, when she was in high\nschool in Radom, she used to do tutoring, anyhow, so this was like breathing air for her.\nAnd she took three of my friends and myself and she formed a little class, and we\nfollowed the curriculum which she knew and for which the books were available in the\nhouse. So, it was a regular school, with regular homework, and I resented the fact that she\nexpected more of me than all the others, and I said, I mean, she lives with me in the house\n- you'd think she could be a little easier on me, but no. But, of course, later on I realized\nthat my really truly foundation for my further education came from that, because we\nreally studied seven days a week.",
        "A: Well, we did it at home. You couldn\u2019t go swimming, the dogs were - the Germans were\nout with the dogs, people were being rounded up for slave labor, and kids were just either\nshot or kicked or the dogs was, you know, they were always threatened with dogs and the\nNazis went around with the rubber whips, so even if you didn\u2019t get killed, you could be\nbeaten up terribly, a dog could eat you up or whatever, so the only thing was to be home\nand that, that really was...",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but big section, a big segment of the day was for classroom, and then\nthere was homework. And then I - he reminds me, of a friend of mine, Mitye\nWeigensburg (ph), they were neighbors not far from us, and people wanted to read books.\nThere was no access to libraries, we are now talking about the secular Jews, you know.\nSo he and I opened a lending library. He always reminds me about it - he lives in\nConnecticut we meet once a year at the . We took books from every house,\nwhoever wanted to, and we had a lending library, so today you had my books and I had\nyours, and we kept records.",
        "A: Yes, yes, and you know, the strange thing about it 1s, I always say, I talk about it, nothing\never goes to waste, because, in later years when my kids were in public school in New\nYork, I was the volunteer chairman of the library in the school for 11 years, I ran the\nvolunteers who worked in the school library here, so, I always tell him, I say, \u201cGuess\nwhat? Whatever we did then applies now.\u201d And that was true, so the schooling was done\nat home the homework was done at home and the rest was still around the books, we had\nthe lending library. People were delighted to get books because people couldn\u2019t go out,\nyou know, and this is already in the ghetto, you know, because later on forget it, later on\nwas different.",
        "A: Yes, because in the old days, you know how to recycle everything. I mean, you never\nthrew away a little piece of paper that wasn\u2019t filled in. And we made little cards, so we\nwrote who - I can assure you it wasn\u2019t the Dewey decimal system - it was just a scribble\nhere, a scribble there, Mrs. X got this book and Mrs. Z got the other book.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Yes.\n[Tape interruption |",
        "A: First of all, you know, as a child, you don\u2019t really plan a future and you don\u2019t look ahead\nto things that are included in the grown up world. You live in your own little world, and\none day\u2019s this and the next day\u2019s that, and past it, maybe two more days, and past it, there\nis no planning. But absolute - my absolute thrill about being able to study was that I was\nback in school. Not for future background or future foundations of how I was going to\nuse it or not use it. It was just the mere fact that my access to study was not severed as\nwas my access to everything else, such as going swimming in the river or playing\noutdoors or whichever. So, this was absolutely the only viewpoint that I had. Never for a\nminute orienting myself to how that was going to come in handy. Aside from which, you\nknow, as I analyze now the system, the educational system in Poland as against the\nsystem in America, Polish education emphasized - it was sort of an elitist concept - but it\nemphasized education for its own sake. You know? You could end up being a carpenter,\nbut you could at the same time be the highly educated person who read all the\nphilosophers and knew the highest level of mathematics, and never apply it to what you\nwere doing, but had the education. And, I don\u2019t know, by osmosis, I guess, that rubbed\noff - that concept rubbed off on me. So that studying, as I said before, because this was\nwar, and I was back in school, and just one day to the next being occupied by books was\ngreat. But by the same token, I always breathed that air that said, you know, you study\nbecause it\u2019s such fun; because you\u2019re going to be a mathematician or you\u2019re going to be a\nprofessor or whatever. You studied because that was really part of the great, great joy of\nlife. And so, assuming that I, in my child\u2019s way, incorporated those two aspects, it was\nstudy for its own sake. Plus, it kept me out of the street where the Germans were with the\ndogs. And it kept me very occupied. Plus, it also kept me in a competitive setting. It\nwasn\u2019t monotonous to the extent that you were doing everything for yourself, by\nyourself, without measuring yourself against some other people. And these were my very\ndear friends, so that the entire idea really revolved around being occupied - gainfully\noccupied, not just killing time or wasting time. And whoever even thought - I certainly\ndidn\u2019t know - planning for the future. I could never, ever visualize, even when I was\nolder during the war and the war was coming to an end, I couldn\u2019t even visualize the end\nof the war or what I would be doing. There wasn\u2019t such thing in my mind ever of a pre-\nset plan, you know, of applying this to that and doing this and that. Everything that came\nafter really evolved out of my basic studies with Hania, there\u2019s no question about it. It\u2019s\njust that I brought to it a certain attitude already, which of course lasted me for the\nlifetime, that school is joy and I loved it and it was good. But I didn\u2019t know how it was\ngoing to fit in the future - who knew that I would even survive, and who even knew how\nthe world would end, how it would look, and how... No, this is totally outside the realm\nof my imagination. Really, to put it totally in the perspective, that\u2019s exactly how it goes.\nIt didn\u2019t... The idea of a future occupation or a future plan that would evolve out of the\nstudy with Hania never entered my mind, really!",
        "A: You know, that I couldn\u2019t tell you, but I know it was a, it was a big chunk of the day, big.\nPlus the fact that I did homework, and lots of it. Lots and lots of it, so that I was really\noccupied all day.",
        "A: She did, but she always reprimanded me \u2018cause she said I could do better than that. So,\nshe did reprimand me, even in front of the other kids. I didn\u2019t appreciate that, but I loved\nher anyhow. But of course my parents were absolutely thrilled because there was nothing\nfor a child to do, and being outdoors was very dangerous, so that, that really filled all the\nneeds. My parents were satisfied, I was happy, Hania was happy, so all around, it really\nwas good.",
        "A: Practically not. Because, even if you did go to play, like kids play ball or something, and\nsomebody would say, \u201cOh, they\u2019re out again with the dogs,\u201d you would immediately go\nin. Because, you know, people were being - grown-ups were being rounded up for all\nkinds of things: for deportations, for killings, for cleaning, for whatever. But children\nwere just as big a temptation for a Nazi with a dog as a grown-up was, just for the sake\nof, you know, scaring a Jew kid.",
        "A: ... when the war broke out, right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And Chris was also in a class, in Hania\u2019s class.",
        "A: Yeah, but not in my class. Hers wasn\u2019t a real class; hers was more... You see, this was\nthe whole idea of keeping yourself occupied with books. At my level, it was a class. I\ndon\u2019t know that Chris had homework or anything. But it was more like maybe\ndiscussions or reading together, you know, like people could get together to read and\nshare books. But that was a very wonderful - this wasn\u2019t an idea that came from outside;\nit came from the house. But that really kept us out of harm\u2019s way.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, to sit out the war - nobody knew anything about anything that\nwas going to happen or wouldn\u2019t happen, but you know, you have to sit out the war and\nhowever best you can, and this was a fine way.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s not the first war that the parents were talking about, and people who were still\naround that have lived through the first war. You know, the deprivation, and then the\nsoldiers are fighting, you see. And if you\u2019re not on the front, and you\u2019re not caught where\nthe soldiers are fighting, then the war will blow over and everything will be fine again.\nBecause it\u2019s the soldiers who fight; civilians don\u2019t fight.",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you what I remember. As I told you, the memory being so selective, that I\nremember all these nonsense things - not nonsense, but the little things that really stuck in\nmy mind, when the biggest things escape my memory. But I do remember how my\nmother was upset when Father was rounded up for cleaning detail. You know, because\nthis was below his station. I think I said that in the interview, because that also stuck in\nmy mind. Mother always talked about it. Father was rounded up in the street and nobody\nknew where he was. And Mother went, and she said, oh, you know - she was told that the\npeople who were rounded up are cleaning out - cleaning - are sweeping the railroad\nstation. So, she went to the railroad station. She was looking, couldn\u2019t find him, and there\nwas this German - German soldier, but she didn\u2019t see the men, the Jews there. So, she\nwent over to him and asked him, \u201cExcuse me, where are the Herren?\u201d - Where are the\ngentlemen? And he said, \u201cThese aren\u2019t gentlemen; these are Jews!\u2019\u201d\u2019 And how Mother was\nupset about that, and of course, Father was terribly humiliated. Because this was early on\n- this was still in \u00b039 - and this was such a humiliating experience for a man, like this, and\nfor Mother, too. So, Mother always talked about it. Of course, we realized later on that\nthis didn\u2019t really mean all that much, because what came later is a totally different\ncategory. But in those days - this was right after the Germans conquered Poland - so, that\nmuch I remember that Mother was very upset about it. You know, those are small things,\nbig things, but they are a very big part of the bigger picture of genocide, because those\nwere the initial steps, as you would now know, but certainly we didn\u2019t know then.",
        "A: Very vague, very vague. That, I know it happened, but the recollection is very vague.\nMaybe I just eliminated it from my psyche somehow. No, that I don\u2019t really... I just\nremember one man, Roman Zinger, was brought around. He was hit and his jaw was\ndislocated. And he was taken around by the Germans to show what you\u2019re going to look\nlike if you do not obey. I remember that, but I don\u2019t remember about my father.",
        "A: Well, probably \u2018til early 1940, because we lived on the main street, which connected the\nold Wierzbnik and Starachowice. That was called the main street, and that was called\nPiusutskego (ph). First 1t was called Starachowice, then it was called Piusutskego (ph).\nThat was the first street evacuated, because that was the so-called best street. After - and\nwe were just pushed further into Wierzbnik. You see, we were on the connecting street\nbetween the two towns. We were pushed further into Wierzbnik, but that was only the\nfirst location. We had three more places that we lived in before the towns were\nliquidated. I don\u2019t know how much of the Starachowice story was told in terms of the\nhistorical events. You see, there was no so-called closed ghetto, as we know a ghetto to\nbe, like a large ghetto, like the Warsaw ghetto. Our ghetto was a gradual - As other parts\nwere being cleared of the Jews in my hometown, they were being sent further into\nWierzbnik. As little villages were being evacuated around the town, all these people were\nbeing sent further into Wierzbnik. But the Christians who lived there were not dislocated,\nyou see, so that at no point was there such a thing as a barbed wire or anything like that,\nyou see? Those Christians who still lived there lived there, and the Jews were just packed\nin and packed in and packed in. And then of course our street that we were sent to, that\nwas cleared, so we had to go further in, and we ended up next to the Christian cemetery\ncalled the Old Cemetery - there are two, the New Cemetery and the Old Cemetery. We,\nour last residence was past the Old Cemetery - that was the location - and we lived in a\nChristian\u2019s home. He was a teamster; he had a horse and wagon. They occupied half, and\nwe had a kitchen and a din- and a living- one room and a kitchen. Half of his house. And\nuntil the time until we were actually liqu- that the town was liquidated, that\u2019s where we\nlived. That\u2019s where went for the Final Solution, my parents and I, not Hania and Chris.\nAnd they lived next door; the Christians lived next door. So this is, this happened\nbetween 1940, early 1940, when Piusutskego (ph) Street was cleared, up to October 27,\n1942. That was life in the ghetto.",

        "A: I think so. I\u2019m not sure. But I know Father was always, because he was so neat and\norganized, and he typed, and so he was always that guy who did the secretarial work\nthrough the camp, you know, through the ghetto and the camp. But I truly don\u2019t know. I\nthink there was a Judenrat in town...",
        "A: Not sure, and I really wouldn\u2019t know who was in it. Even though I did read in the\nStarachowice, the book, the names, but I really wouldn\u2019t know for sure.",
        "A: Oh, yes, but then I first started to realize what this was all about. I mean, we didn\u2019t know\nwhat this was leading up to, and we certainly didn\u2019t - / certainly didn\u2019t know what was\nhappening elsewhere, that I didn\u2019t know. But I did know that, by virtue of being near the\nplant, the war production plant, that people were being sent in for their labor. You see, I\ndidn\u2019t realize that basically it was the other way around. People were being cleared out of\nother places to be sent here, not because they were needed. In other words, the Germans\ndidn\u2019t go outside of the ghetto to find these people. It\u2019s just that all these other\ncommunities were being cleared, and Starachowice was the logical place to shove them\ninto, even though it would be bursting at the seams, for the reason this was access to\nslave labor. Of course, I know this all in hindsight, but in those days, it just seemed that\nperhaps they were trying to have more labor, a bigger labor force, so they were just going\nout and sending these people in. But of course, it was the other way around.",
        "A: I think so. Yes, I think so. But I don\u2019t remember where, but I think she was working.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Chris and Hania were working in the brick factory.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I just remember at the end, that\u2019s where they were.",
        "A: I was given a job very shortly, very - probably, at the, the same month probably that they\ncleared the town of Jews, I was given a job in the factory, in the plant, just putting the...\nYou know, these were cannon shells; they weren\u2019t too big. You were supposed to put it\non, on the machine, and the lathe would, you know, like you carve an apple, would take\noff the first peel and then you took it off. It was piecework. And they were around to\nwatch you and count. You put it down; you put another one. Anybody could do it; you\ndidn\u2019t need the Herculean strength to do that. And then, of course, after the town was\ncleared of Jews, and of course, that\u2019s going further into the camps, I started working in\nthe laundry. So, after that, I never worked in the factory, only in the laundry. Whereas\nHania and Chris were detained overnight in the brick factory, so that the morning that the\ntown was cleared of Jews, they did not report to the square, the market square. But I did,\nwith my parents.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m Jewish, obviously, yes, and from the same, from the same type of family. You\nsee? Again, as I was trying to explain, I did not mean to divide it into superior or inferior\nor anything. The secular type of Jews who lived in town, and these were my friends.\nThey were absolutely my friends.",
        "A: Yes, well, they lived very nearby, yes, they did. They lived on Piusutskego (ph) also, so it\nwas very, I mean, access was easy.",
        "A: Frankly, I probably did, because I was always very curious about everything, you know,\nbut maybe I just... I absolutely don\u2019t remember. But, I'll tell you frankly, when there was\ntalk about war, before the war broke out, and my parents said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s going to be a\nhorrible thing if there is a war because the first war was so bad.\u201d You know, they used to\ntell us about the first war. And quietly I was thinking to myself, \u201c\u201cWhy would a war be so\nbad? You know? You could learn all these new things and you could find out and it\u2019s\ndifferent...\u2019 So, quietly thought, well, I think the war would be good, because from my\nviewpoint, why not? I mean, all these exciting things that my parents were talking about,\nyou see? So, then, when the war came, and I am quite sure that we talked - the kids,\namong ourselves - talked about the same thing, up to a point. Because finally, when we\nrealized what was really going on, then I am sure that we changed around. Because once\nwe Started fearing for our own lives, it was no more that idealized version of new things\nhappening. And that I remember distinctly, that I always used to say, \u201cGee, I really would\nlike a war, because I would know what - you know, new things that are happening, you\nknow, how they do it. Because war means soldiers fighting; it doesn\u2019t apply otherwise.\u201d",
        "A: Not an entertainment. It was something, it was an experience that I would really, yes, I\nwould very be glad to be part of, but... uh... it didn\u2019t turn out that way.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I was there, but I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: You see, how big was the house? By now, we must have lived in one room. I couldn\u2019t\nabsent myself. The fact is my parents never told me directly anything. Whatever I did\nknow, I probably guessed, and then I probably rationalized quickly, that this was, because\nyou know, they were saying rumors, all kinds of gossip. And rumors, gossip, I\u2019m sure\nthey were saying rumors and gossip just to protect us. You know, but I truly don\u2019t know.\nI\u2019ve said it so many times. I don\u2019t know what they knew, and what they didn\u2019t know, and\nhow much they withheld from me personally, not from Hania and Krysia. You see that I\nreally don\u2019t know. Chris was really sort of a more mature person. Chris was always a\nhands-on and practical type, so I think she could have known much more than I did, but I\ndid not know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You see, so she also didn\u2019t hear. And if she didn\u2019t hear and was asked to go out, I\ncertainly would never had been told about it. That\u2019s absolutely a fact.",
        "A: Yes, this was the time when the screw was being tightened, you see. There was scarce\nfood; you had to really fight for it. You had to keep - you could still barter; you still had\naccess to the Polish population, you see, so you could barter and you could buy and you\ncould try the hardest you could, but subsistence was meager, very meager. And then - I\ndon\u2019t know if Chris told you about it - but one Sunday, when people are leaving church -\nyou know, the church was up on Church Street. Cruzcherna (ph) was up on the hill, and\nthe market square, where we were eventually, from which we were sent to the selection.\nThe market square was - coming down from Cruzcherna (ph), from the church, was the\nmarket square. Something happened - Poles killed a German or something - and I\nremember distinctly, they built a gallows in the market square and they hung 12 Poles on\na Sunday, when people were coming down from the church, from Cruzcherna (ph) Street,\nfrom Church Street, down to the square. In other words, I suspect that whatever exchange\nthere was between the Jews and the Poles, surreptitious as it was and quiet as it was,\ncould have diminished to a great extent, because that was a warning to others, too. Of\ncourse, I found out what happened years later that they lured a German or two Germans\nto a prostitute and they got there and they killed them. And so for that, 12 Poles were\nhung on a Sunday after church. So, I imagine - I don\u2019t know what year this was, but we\nwere still living in the so-called ghetto. And, of course, whether this 1s a direct result -\nwhether the starvation that was setting in was a direct result of this warning that they give\nto the Christians, they gave to the Christians, I don\u2019t know. But, of course, food was\nscarce and, and things were very bad. The only thing was that Mother was very inventive;\nshe once an excellent cook, so she made things out of nothing. The first time in my life I\nate cookies that was baked with sugar beets, made with sugar beets - it\u2019s because there\nwas no sugar, of course. So, that\u2019s, that\u2019s the screw was being tightened, but 1t wasn\u2019t yet\ncompletely tight. You see, there was still the possibility of surviving, if the sickness\ndidn\u2019t kill you, if they didn\u2019t shoot you, if the dogs didn\u2019t tear you to shreds.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely, a white armband with a blue - a blue Star of David on it. Probably right\naway, probably when we still lived on Piusutskego (ph), I suspect, including children.",
        "A: Oh, yes, absolutely.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes. First, I have to say that Chris and Hania - Ana - were employed in the brick factory.\nBecause, as you well know by now, there was the munitions factory, munitions plant,\nthere was the brick factory and there was the sawmill, and I think there was one more. I\ndon\u2019t remember. All these employed slave labor. And the word got around - first of all,\nable-bodied people were taken anyhow - but word got around that if you work, you have\na chance to have a better life. Not survived - we didn\u2019t talk about survival and all that. It\u2019s\njust that you could live a little better 1f you had a job. So, anybody who was anybody\nsecured a job. Now, Hania and Chris worked in the brick factory, and they had the night\nshift. October 26\" to 27\" is when they were inside the factory, in the brick factory.\nOctober 27\u2122 in the morning - I think 6:00 in the morning - is when the round up started\nfor the evacuation of the Jews from the hometown. Now, Hania and Krysia were never\nreleased from the factory, and I really don\u2019t know about people who worked in the\nmunitions plant, but I imagine they were also kept back, because they were already a\nwork force that could be counted on. Well, I was at home at the last of our residences in\nthe ghetto, sharing the house with this Christian family, and that was past the Old\nCemetery, the old - old Christian cemetery. We were made to walk. First of all, the knock\ncame on the door, and \u201cEverybody out, everybody out.\u201d We got dressed - I know, again,\nseveral layers of clothing - and we were driven toward the market square. So, as we\npassed the old cemetery, we started coming nearer to the market square, and that\u2019s where\na lot of Jewish people lived before the war anyhow, but now, of course, it was packed,\nbecause other streets have been cleaned - not cleaned, but cleared of the Jewish people.\nAnd as people would walk out of the buildings, if they didn\u2019t walk straight, if their child\nwas crying, the Germans were in a total frenzy, and there were Latvians who were\nassisting. They were shooting at anybody who didn\u2019t rush, who didn\u2019t go as fast as he\nwas told, who didn\u2019t walk straight, had one more bundle than, than it was absolutely\nallowed. So that, between the old cemetery and the square, which was probably no more\nthan half a mile, there was such atrocities that I rather thought the world was ending.\nBecause, I mean, I\u2019d seen a lot of things up to that point, you know, but I had never seen\npeople falling and children, infants smashed against the walls, and you know, horror upon\nhorror, and this was only a half a mile walk. Now, my parents held me by my hand on\neach side, and as I said, I was overdressed because Mother insisted. I also was a very\nskinny child, and she wanted to make me look more mature. Of course, I wasn\u2019t\ndeveloped, I was just a mere child, so she shoved some stuff into me to make me look\nmature and developed and she put rouge on my cheeks. And we walked to the market\nSquare, and as we were coming closer, there was a building where Mother\u2019s very dear\nfriends lived, and there was a family Kalinyerska (ph). Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) was an\nelderly woman, maybe in her seventies - I mean, for a child, age at that time... I don\u2019t\nknow, but I know old Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph), that\u2019s how I know her. Her daughter went to\nPalestine through the efforts my mother\u2019s Zionist ha-sharat (ph). So, she was there. And\nas we were passing very near the square, Mother - she couldn\u2019t walk - Mother took her\nunder the arm and walked with her to the square, and I followed with my father. And\nwhen we came to the square, the scene was indescribable, because they had the Latvians\nand they had the Germans and they had dogs. And people were being whipped with\nrubber whips, and people were shot with rifles and with guns and with whatever. And\npeople were screaming and everybody - they were shouting and - whatever. We came on\na scene which was very hard to understand, because the Germans, who were standing at\neach corner of the square, directed the people coming out of these adjacent streets: \u201cTo\nthe right here, you go this way, you go this way.\u201d You had no idea which way you were\ngoing. All I knew in the final analysis was that Father was sent one way, which I\nunderstood because the men were separated, I was sent another way, and Mother and\nMrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were sent another way. So, I still couldn\u2019t make out what is\nhappening here, and who is going where and why. Very soon, my group was whipped\ninto formation, and I mean whipped in to formation, I think five rows and five across, and\nwe were driven toward Starachowice, meaning by Piusutskego (ph) and that way. And\nwe had to march in formation, as if to - as 1f to a beat, and whoever couldn\u2019t make it,\nwhoever stumbled, was immediately shot on the spot. Now, I at this point had no - First\nof all, I didn\u2019t know where Hania and Krysia were. I knew they never came home from\nthe factory. So, I could just imagine that they could have been sent in another group like\nthis - whatever - or maybe they were somewhere dead and I didn\u2019t see them. I didn\u2019t\nknow. And as I got into the group driven that way toward Starachowice plant, I found\nmyself eventually in Strzelnica - of course, I didn\u2019t know what Strzelnica was about - but\nthis is where I ended up, in Strzelnica in an open area, and we were told to sit down and\nstay there. I was beside myself with fear. I was horror-stricken and totally lost. I think of\nall my traumatic experiences in the world, that is absolutely the most traumatic. Because\nyou know, at all other times, I had somebody to lean on - Chris and Hania or my parents -\nthis, I was totally alone, and I really didn\u2019t know, you see. I didn\u2019t know that Chris and\nHania were still around. I was petrified. I cried, and I was... So, people who knew the\nfamily, they said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t cry. Mother will come, and this will sort itself out. This is\nwhatever it is. They...\u201d Whatever. Eventually, I found out that Father was in the same\ncamp, in other words, he was with the men and I was put with the women.",
        "A: With women, to Strzelnica, and Father marched off to Strzelnica with the men.\nSubsequently we found out that people like my mother and Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were\nput on a train. Nobody was saying where, but of course, that train went to Treblinka.\nHania and Krysia, on the other hand, after all this was over, they were sent to place called\nMajowka, which was another camp in town. So that somehow, because then they started -\npeople were beginning to be shifted, because I forgot how it was - I think Majowka\npeople used to work in the sawmill, or something, or the brick factory - I really don\u2019t\nknow how it was all decided who worked where - but I do know that word came back to\nus that Hania and Krysia survived - no, the word was not \u2018survived\u2019 - that they were not\nshipped out. That they did not - that they were not shipped out, that they are still around,\nand that they are in Majowka. So, of course, now I\u2019d met my father - not that I stayed\nwith him, because men were separated from women. And Father again went into the\noffice to do book work for the . And Hania reminded me that what happened\nlater was that Father was sent to Majowka, or however it was, or Krysia was sent... How\nwas it now? I forget how it was, but anyhow, two of us were in Strzelnica, Father and I.\nHania and Krysia were in Majowka. Later on, the camps were combined. And, of course,\nlater on the camps were shifted again. But at this point, I was with my father, and that, of\ncourse, was a great consolation, even if I didn\u2019t stay with him, because he was with the\nmen\u2019s group. I stayed with women who knew me, who knew the family, and looked after\nme up to such time as Krysia and Hania joined me.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Thirteen, yes.",
        "A: Never ever.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: I am scared.",
        "A: I am scared out of my wits. I really, I couldn\u2019t scream. In fact, when we finally got to\nStrzelnica, and I didn\u2019t know yet Father was around, I couldn\u2019t yet cry - but I cried later -\nbut I couldn\u2019t yet cry because I was overwhelmed with fear. The terror of it all and the\nfear, it\u2019s sort of, you know, like you become breathless. I was frozen in the fear of it all.\nAnd I must say, this was the first time - the march to the square and then the march to\nStrzelnica - were my real first encounter with horror which I could not avoid. You know,\nlike when we were coming back from the woods, when the war broke out, I saw dead\nhorses on the road. I didn\u2019t see ever dead horses before, so I covered my eyes. I sort of\ncovered my eyes, and I didn\u2019t see the - I saw the dead horses were coming up, and there\nwas a dead horse, so I covered my eyes. But later on, there was no way of covering your\neyes, because the horror was such, and you had to watch yourself, and you had to stay in\nline and you had to march as fast as you were told to. So that the overwhelming fear was\nsort of like paralysis, you know, paralysis of your brain. You don\u2019t think. You make the\nmotion, your body propels you, but it\u2019s not the brain; it\u2019s the fear that propels you, I\nguess. And later on, until I wound down enough to cry - it took awhile because I was out\nof my mind with fear because, for the first time in my entire life, I was alone, left in these\ncircumstances, where all these years I was so protected.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I was afraid because I was alone. Because, first of all, because of what I saw, you\nknow? This was a shock to my system. Even if I were too much (ph) with parents and my\nsisters, I would still be shocked out of my wits to see the horror that I encountered\nbetween leaving the house and the selection in the square and the Strzelnica camp. I\ncouldn\u2019t cover my eyes and I couldn\u2019t make believe it didn\u2019t exist because I had to have\nmy wits around me to pay attention to everything because, if somebody fell under my\nfeet, I couldn\u2019t stumble. So, the entire picture revolved around saving your life however\nyou can, so you cannot disregard what\u2019s happening around you. So, that\u2019s 1942, and this\nis the rude awakening that is the point at which I was facing up to what 1s really\nhappening, even though I wasn\u2019t yet told anything.",
        "A: My father.",
        "A: Well, maybe not. No, maybe waving or something.",
        "A: There was not yet, you know... We were segregated; he was in one group, but the fact is\nthat he saw me and I saw him and we waved. And then other people got in touch with\nother men, so everybody said, \u201cOh, Renia, your father said that he\u2019s here and he\u2019|I look\nafter...\u201d>\u00bb And you know, so people would send messages that way. So, that was the only\nthing. But of course he did not know what happened to my mother. But of course maybe\nhe knew and didn\u2019t tell me. Because my mother was supporting an elderly woman. So if\nyou really had any, any understanding of the situation, you knew that Mrs. Kalinyerska\n(ph) was not one to be going to slave labor because she was old. And my mother,\nsupporting her, had to go with her.",
        "A: I can tell you, my understanding of everything is that they knew much more than they\never let on, because they were intelligent people, aside from which, you know, my father\nwas fluent in German. In fact, he spoke and wrote and read German. He used to subscribe\nto German periodicals and such. I doubt very much that my father didn\u2019t know. I mean,\nthat is impossible. But the fact that he didn\u2019t tell me, that is an absolute fact.",
        "A: Yes. Absolutely. I kept 1t in my head that - because, you see, the word \u2018resettlement\u2019 was\nbeing bandied about. What that word meant didn\u2019t quite - was never clarified, but they\nsaid \u201cThe resettlement to the east, the resettlement...\u201d\u2019 The word \u2018resettlement\u2019. So, you\nknow, you can always rationalize it. If you have already met the quota for slave labor for\nthe Starachowice plant and the other factories nearby, then you resettle... I mean, on the\nchild\u2019s level, you can more or less follow their train of thought. The others were resettled\nto places which was needed other people, so that was resettlement. And by the same\ntoken, I couldn\u2019t imagine that I wouldn\u2019t see my mother again, so that was another thing.\nHiding from the real possibility of what happened. I felt that way right along, you know?\nI knew I didn\u2019t know. I knew what I didn\u2019t know. I really realized, but I didn\u2019t want to\nknow.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really know, but my next recollection of the camp was - yeah, I worked in the\nlaundry, you know, I was assigned to the laundry.",
        "A: In Strzelnica, right away. So that I did not go to the factory anymore. I worked in the\nfactory maybe a month at the most. I worked in the fa-... And my next recollection of the\nplace was that Hania became very - Hania must have already been in, because she had an\nextreme case of typhus. And I remember that, because selections were being made. We\nhad to line up, and they told you to run, and whoever could not run fast enough was taken\nout and shot. People were taken - ten or twelve men were told to dig a grave - and then\npeople were taken over to the pit and shot. So, I do remember that Hania had such an\nextremely severe case of typhus, she was hallucinating and talking out of her head. I also\nhad typhus but a mild form, so that, that was the one thing I remember so distinctly. And\nI met here in Florida, I met a friend of mine who worked with me in the laundry three\nyears ago, and she said to me, \u201cYou know, Renia, you saved my mother\u2019s life.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cI saved your mother\u2019s life? I never heard of anything like that.\u201d And she says,\n\u201cWell, what happened is when we worked 1n the laundry...\u201d She and her mother worked\nin the laundry with me, and her mother had a severe case of typhus. And they called us\nout and told us to line up, and she says that I stood - she put the mother between me and\nher - her mother was a tiny little woman; we were both taller than the mother and we held\non to her and they passed by and didn\u2019t notice and she survived. Whereas I know for a\nfact that her mother saved my life because when I had typhus, she told me to stand over\nthe cauldron where the steam was coming from, because I was red, you know, feverish,\nso she says, \u201cWhen they see you, they will know that it\u2019s the steam.\u201d And so it was - they\nopened the door and looked in and then if anyone was sick with typhus, and we were all\nover the cauldrons there, and when I turned my head, they saw me all sweaty and red, and\nI was just one more slave worker doing laundry. So, that was actually, she - that was Mrs.\nShacter (ph) - And so it was news to me when she told me I saved her mother\u2019s life. But\nthe fact is that selections were being made right along, and typhus sufferers were\neliminated one by one. So, Hania miraculously survived that selection.",
        "A: No, absolutely not. I just don\u2019t know what I thought at that time. I just knew that times\nwere very bad. And I just hoped maybe the war would be over and how it will be over, I\ndidn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know who was fighting whom, and where was the front or if there\nwas the front, or the Germans were there to stay, or whatever. I just figured that it\ncouldn\u2019t go on forever, you know, one way or another it has to end. And I just - I made\nno connections. In fact, I was really, truly - I was not an independent thinker in any such\nway that you could imagine me, planning or... I probably understood what was going on\nvery well. I understood it very well, because horror is not very hard to understand. It\u2019s\nnaked horror in front of your eyes, so you know what is happening. But how that related\nto the overall thing, I knew I was petrified. I lived in fear every second of my life. That I\nknew. After that, I couldn\u2019t say that I ever could figure out the next day or the month later\nor if it will end - I knew it would end sometime - but how and when, no such thing.",
        "A: Oh, yes, not past the age, but, just to give you the quick overview, I went through all the\ncamps - Auschwitz and Ravensbrick and Retzow and back home to Poland - and I still\ndid not start. So, that was what you say called a delayed reaction.",
        "A: And of course, I was not developed and I lacked proper nutrition; I was a skinny child.",

        "A: No, I was glad!",

No, but I never had such a fear because nothing\nwas happening and nothing did happen and I never developed until after the war.",
        "A: No, I know that they didn\u2019t because in Auschwitz - I repeat that like an ignoramus\nbecause I don\u2019t know what it means - but in Auschwitz, they used to say that the soup,\nthe so-called soup that we were given, had brom in it. Now, I don\u2019t know what brom is -\nand this was some kind of a - whatever it was, a medication or whatever - that that\nprevented women from menstruating. I have no idea, I am just repeating it as I heard it.\nSo, I know that the women did not menstruate. Why, I wouldn\u2019t know, and whether it\nwas due to some concoction or an agent or a chemical being put in the food, I couldn\u2019t\ntell, but I knew that much.",
        "A: It is.",
        "A: So, maybe lack of nutrition...\u2019",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "A: I know that I did not until way after we came back to Poland, and I mean, way after.\nMaybe even later than that - maybe in Berlin in \u201946. As far down the road as that.",
        "A: Would you believe that I really don\u2019t remember? I know that we were fed. But, in those\ndays, we were getting Pancheska (ph), the Pancheski (ph) family were sending, you\nknow, they had some of our better things, crystal, silver, and they were selling it off little\nby little and were sending in money. One of the husbands, actually, it was one of the\nsisters was married to one of the men who worked 1n the factory - you know, one of the\nPancheska (ph) sisters. There were four sisters, so one of the husbands - the husband of\none worked in the factory, and he used to bring - Maria used to sell the stuff - and he used\nto bring the money. And she was the only one who never even wanted that stuff\noriginally, but Mother said those are things of sentimental value. In fact, after the war,\nwhatever we had from home is from them. You know, those little Passover silver cups -\nDid Chris tell you about it?",
        "A: Yeah, so those things, she kept that she didn\u2019t sell yet. Because, Genia (ph), the maid, she\nhad really - she really wanted everything, and she took everything. But you know, a\nsewing machine is not of sentimental value, and bedspreads and draperies have not got\nsentimental value. So, she took it and it was her own, but Mrs. Pancheska (ph) took\neverything my parents had - you know, gifts, wedding gifts, and such, silver - so, they\nkept it and sold whatever they felt that would bring in more money and that\u2019s how we\nsurvived.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: No. Money was nothing. I mean, money you can hide but you cannot hide things. And he\nused to give it - the husband of one of the sisters - used to give it to somebody we knew\nand they would bring it from the factory, so that worked out.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, in that camp, we kept our clothes. They didn\u2019t give you - I don\u2019t think so - not until\nAuschwitz. I think I wore my personal things.",
        "A: In barracks. You see, Strzelnica was what they call a shooting range originally, and then\nthey built a bunch of barracks there, you see, so that is where one of the camps was made,\nwas Strzelnica. Whereas - Now, when I went to Poland, in 1980, I asked - Pancheska\u2019s\n(ph) granddaughter took us there. I wanted to see Strzelnica. Well, it\u2019s back to a shooting\nrange, you see. And some of the barracks were left over but not all. So, that was an area\nthat was inside the woods, and the barracks - again, I can\u2019t tell you whether they were\nbuilt for us or built prior or however, but there were barracks and we slept with women.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: In a sense, yes, and in a sense, no, because as far as I\u2019m concerned personally, I was\nalways at the receiving end, meaning I received all the love, and I received all the\nprotection, and I received all the care and all everything. I was the one really who most\nlikely contributed list to the general survival scheme, or whatever you call it. I was on the\nreceiving end of it most of the time. I adored my sisters. Krysia, Chris, my next higher\nthan I sister, was always the practical kind and always very wise in organizing and\nassessing, so... Hania was sort of in the clouds. She was very smart and very brilliant, but\nshe was always sort of - she was catered to, you know. In those days, if you had a very\nsmart person in the family, you had to defer to that person because you couldn\u2019t disturb\nthe genius at work. So, it sort of carried over to her... Not that she was a sponger of any\nkind - it\u2019s just that she was really at a certain level of higher existence that she didn\u2019t\nreally have to so much worry about everyday things. So that basically, Chris was the one\nwho pulled the two of us toward the center, you see? And Hania was very bright and very\nintelligent, and understood most everything better than I do anytime, but we loved each\nother a whole lot, and the fact that we were now separated from our parents - now, I\u2019m\nsaying separated because we were still separated from our father but we knew he was\naround and saw him every now and then and would wave to him, and we were separated\nfrom our mother because we really did not know what death was all about. So, we\ndeluded ourselves that, well, this resettlement, whatever. Having seen so many people\nresettled from Lodz and from Austria in our own hometown, we knew what resettlement\nwas all about. People were being shifted here and there, and so Mother was shifted\nsomewhere else, and everything is going to come out fine, because when everything ends,\nshe will show up. So, basically, we were even closer as a unit now than we ever were.\nAnd, I must say, I contributed only by the fact that I was there, and they felt that they had\nto protect me, and so that was a little more mortar to the binding. But I was not the\nplanner; I was not a - I didn\u2019t visualize things in practical terms. I understood the\nsituation very well, having now seen what was transpiring, but how that applied to\nanything; it really didn\u2019t, not in my little world, because this was all stuff I didn\u2019t know\nhow to deal with. Besides, I had these two protectors. First I had my two parents; I was\nalways the tag-along. Now, Hania and Krysia were sort of protecting me. So, I just had to\nsee that I stayed out of trouble, that I was alert at all times to what was around me, that I\nunderstood the danger, that I understood how to handle myself, you know? And the rest, I\nknew I was being provided with the love and protection. And that truly was how I really\nsurvived the war. Not on my own account in any way. I don\u2019t take credit for survival at\nall, truly. That is how I actually saw myself. I saw to it that I really should know what\nwas going on and try to avoid getting into trouble, meaning situations that had no exit.",
        "A: But I was not responsible for anybody but myself, don\u2019t you see? In the way we were\nbrought up, watching out for yourself wasn\u2019t the greatest thing in the world that you want\nto do, because you really always needed to think of that other person. But by virtue of\nbeing at the end of the line, and not being terribly attuned to realities and not being old\nenough to understand it all and put it together, I could understand the danger and the fear,\nbut I couldn\u2019t relate it to the fact that I was doing anything special, because I wasn\u2019t\ndoing anything for anybody. I was trying to keep myself alive by seeing that I survived,\nyou know? That\u2019s about it. Not by harming anybody, not by doing anything special, but\nby just watching out, and of course, to keep control of the fear, which was a task of itself.\nControlling your fear is extremely hard, if you see if your fear is legitimate, it\u2019s\nextremely hard to do.",
        "A: At certain times I could, at certain I could not. Like the time when I was alone going to\nStrzelnica camp. But my fear was uncontrollable, but there was double fear of what\nwould happen if I didn\u2019t control myself - because everybody was just falling by the\nwayside. You see, that much I understood.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Not only, you know, I imagine you must have heard about it. Not only were they in the\ncamp, they were basically smuggled into the camp. They were outside the camp with\nChristians, or however they were smuggled. These kids eventually went to Auschwitz,\nsurvived Auschwitz, five and seven year old kids, survived Auschwitz, and one of them\nis still alive in Israel. But three of these little kids that lived in camp, who went to Poland\nafter, to Starachowice after the war, were killed in Starachowice, so you heard about that.\nI think the name was - Hania reminded me - Eisenmann (ph) - and Wolfowicz (ph) was\nthe man that was the boss of the laundry where I worked, so Wolfowicz (ph) I think had\ntwo children. They were in camp, you see, he smuggled them in and they lived in the\nback of the laundry or whatever, but I knew of the Wolfowicz (ph) kids. And they\nsurvived the evacuation to Auschwitz, they survived Auschwitz, and everything that\ncame after, and they came back to Poland, and they were killed after the war in Poland.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I just knew, because they were in a position to get them in, because they\nbribed someone or something. I know that Mr. Wolfowicz (ph) was my boss in the\nlaundry, and his kids - he had two kids - so, I don\u2019t know how many there was - I don\u2019t\nknow, less than ten - and they did survived. They were five-year-old kids.",
        "A: Yeah, they were, they were, some of them survived, down in Israel, of course.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, my peers. For example, the girl in the laundry, Rachelka Shacter (ph), she\nwas a very good friend. Then I had my Hania Tenser (ph), she was the one who came\nfrom Israel to testify that she was in the gas chamber, and she was my friend. Yes, I had -\nyou know - they were all kids, but you know, a fourteen, thirteen year old kid can work\npretty well in the laundry, believe me, and that was just as well slave labor as anything.",
        "A: Oh, yes, most of all poetry. Iam absolutely crazy about poetry. And, you know, the\namazing thing is that the emphasis on learning things by rote, by heart, was very strong in\nmy schooling years, and Hania kept on the same way, so I actually remember a whole lot\nof Polish poetry, I remember sections of Shakespeare in Polish, and you know, in the\nhardest of times - to this day I can recite poetry that I wouldn\u2019t even believe that I would.\nThere is a Polish epic, Pan Tadeusz, that of course I must have read a million times now\nalready, but I do read it - it\u2019s one of the greatest works. Anyway, I went to see the movie\nbased on that - it was released about two years ago, by Andrzej Wajda, the director, and\nthey stuck very close to the script and used at least 80% of the poetry as was the epic. I\nwas sitting in the movie with Victor - of course, Victor doesn\u2019t speak Polish, but he\nenjoyed the movie subtitles - and I am reciting with the movie, I am reciting Pan Tadeusz\nbecause I exactly know what\u2019s going to come. And he walks into this room and he looks\naround and he sees the grandfather clock, and he recites this poem about his connection\nto the grandfather clock, and I am going right along with him, and I know one line ahead\nof him all the time. So, those things sustained me, definitely. And I didn\u2019t see it - again,\nit\u2019s a connection, where it\u2019s going to lead me. This was like nourishment; perhaps that\u2019s\nhow I should have put that - that learning for its own sake, if 1t was pleasurable, was the\ngreatest pleasure. So, when you\u2019re down and out, what else but to draw on this something\nthat was so pleasurable. And it was personal, intimate, because you didn\u2019t have to find a\nbook, you didn\u2019t have to rely on the movies or on other people - all you had to do was\nstart reciting in your head that poem - and there were so many, because we were forced to\nmemorize good poetry, really. So, that was, to this day, I absolutely have every piece of\npoetry that I love, I have it now, and I re-read it, strangely enough. I enjoy it and I enjoy\nit and there is no end to the enjoyment, and that could have been part of what I call this\nlifting up the soul. Again, you see, it doesn\u2019t - I\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t\nanswer your question to your satisfaction.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, mostly it was Mickiewicz or Tuwim - I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of him.\nMickiewicz was a 19\" century poet of Polish origin, but Lithuanian, he came out of,\nwhen Lithuania was part of - heavily Polish. But Tuwim was contemporary, and he wrote\nchildren\u2019s poems, and he was a Jew, a Polish Jew. And his poetry was very much taught\nin schools. Mickiewicz, of course, and there was Slowacki, and there were all other\nimportant poets, but they were 18'\"/19\u2122 century poets. Twentieth century poet was Julian\nTuwin, who was a Jew by birth, and every kid knew his poetry. In fact, when our parents\nhad company and they wanted to show off the kid, they would come and say, \u201cHey, hey,\nsay that locomotive poem by Tuwim.\u201d You showed off that because it was such beautiful\npoetry. And, so I have Tuwim, I have him. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t quite agree with the\nway his life turned out, because he sort of - he came to America during the war and then\nwent back to Communist Poland. He had left this . Not that it means anything in\nthe broader sense. He was nevertheless the greatest poet of the 20\"... one of the great,\noutstanding Polish poets of the 20\" century was Julian Tuwim. They\u2019re trying to\nrehabilitate him now, but his poetry lives on, so who cares, whatever the background. So,\nyou know, all of those little poems and big poems would come back, and they gave you a\nsemblance of continuity of something that was, maybe you didn\u2019t lose it yet. If you could\nremember that poem that your mother made you recite at that party, you know, and the\nconnection, you see? And of course, you know, children, you had to curtsey for your\nparents\u2019 friends; you had to curtsey. So, when you came to make a big presentation, she\ncalled you in, you had to curtsey and say the poem, and then would curtsey and walk out.\nSo, if it was possible, which it was, to make the mental connection from the present\nsituation which I found myself in to this thing that was once sort of part of the other life,\nthat was great. And if you call it the thread that sustains you, fine, but that\u2019s what it really\nwas.",
        "A: Yes, a lot of times, because, as I told you, Polish education required you to know certain\npoems, period. That\u2019s it. So, this is how it was, that if you started, somebody else chimed\nin, somebody else sung. There was a lot of singing; it was good.",
        "A: In the camp, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes, we saw Father, yes. He slept elsewhere, but he was working in the little office, so\nwe could always see him.",
        "A: He was doing fine, because we were around. But people told us - people from\nStarachowice who survived the war and Auschwitz, whom we met after the war - they\nsaid that the minute he came to Auschwitz, he was another man. Father, according to\naccounts of other people that knew him, he perished in October, you see, we came to\nAuschwitz at the end of July; he perished in October. They said he aged so, and he\ntotally, he was totally disheartened. He was totally - he felt completely lost. Maybe he by\nthen knew - he could have known about my mother. I don\u2019t know. But then, of course, he\ndidn\u2019t have us anymore. He knew we were somewhere in there, but he didn\u2019t really\nknow. They said that his legs swelled up and he was gone. He perished in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Oh, yes, I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Out of Strzelnica camp to Auschwitz? Well, you see, I might as well bring in the fact that\nwe were not evacuated from Strzelnica and Majowka. We were evacuated from a totally\ndifferent camp.",
        "A: Well, the munitions factory had a siding, you know, because to deliver and take out the\nstuff by train. At a certain time, at a certain point in 1944, in July or so, middle of July,\nwe were resettled to yet another camp, but very near the munitions factory, next to the\nsiding, the railroad siding, and that camp was the last camp in Starachowice from which\nthe evacuation to Auschwitz took place. That is where the break-out was, the rebellion\nand the break-out. That is where we were loaded on the train for Auschwitz, which is not\nStrzelnica and it\u2019s not Majowka, but it\u2019s the third place which I don\u2019t even know if it had\na name, but it was the closest in location physically to the munitions factory because the\nrailroad, the railroad tracks were right there, and that\u2019s where we were loaded to go to\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, days, maybe a week or two at most. And this was a transient type of - I can\u2019t even\nsay it was camp. It had barbed wire, or it had a wooden fence, whatever - 1t was\nsurrounded by a fence, and it had guards, guard towers, you see, because that was very,\nthis was so near to the factory that this was really probably war production area anyway,\nbut they had guards, and they had Ukrainians in them. And this is where, and I don\u2019t\nknow, Chris or Hania would remember better how long we stayed, but this was\nabsolutely not a camp that we lived in because by then we didn\u2019t work anymore.",
        "A: ...emptied to the third, into the third. No, even before then, those two camps were\ncombined. You know, I really forgot how the combination went. First it was Strzelnica\nand Majowka, then it was no more Strzelnica, it was only Majowka, and then I think,\nthen it was the third camp, but it was physically another place.",
        "A: Strzelnica, no.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know. Hania and Chris would probably remember it better. But I do know\nthat we did not go to Auschwitz out of Strzelnica and not out of Majowka, but out of the\nthird place.",
        "A: Let\u2019s say a week or so.",
        "A: Yeah, and they load us on the trains.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: The one thing that I absolutely never lost was fear. That is one thing that followed me\nright through the war. Fear was sort of like, like your skin. Skin is part of your body, and\nfear is another aspect of that. And we just, I don\u2019t know that we knew that Auschwitz\nexisted. I didn\u2019t; I don\u2019t know who knew. I just know that when we were being loaded,\nhowever that was arranged, Father\u2019s train, the car on the train, and ours were adjacent,\nmeaning whether his was the last of the men\u2019s wagons and we were the first of the\nwomen\u2019s or the other way around. I don\u2019t know. I just remember that when we arrived in\nAuschwitz, when they unloaded us on the platform, that as soon as the women came out\nof this wagon, we saw the group of men coming out of that one that was adjacent to us,\nand that was the last time we saw him.",
        "A: That was most horrendous. Horrendous isn\u2019t the word, because it was summertime, you\nknow, it was the end of July 1942... No, what am I saying, it wasn\u2019t \u201942, of course not -\n\"44! We\u2019re talking now, of course, this is the Russian offensive that has started, so the\nGermans are emptying all these labor camps and they are sending people westward. And\nwe of course have no idea how the war is progressing, or at least I don\u2019t. Because I really\nam living on another planet. I just want to survive. I\u2019m full of fear and I\u2019m trying to\nmanage, but other than that, I really don\u2019t have any idea what is happening. The only\nthing is that something bad is happening to the Germans because now there are signs that\nthey are a little scared, you know? So, when we are loaded on those trains, I don\u2019t know\nthat we know that we\u2019re going to Auschwitz or I don\u2019t even know that - I mean, I didn\u2019t -\nI didn\u2019t even know that Auschwitz existed, but I figured if there is a war and the soldiers\nare moving closer, there will be soldiers fighting with soldiers. Maybe they want us out\nof the - you know, this 1s another type of pipe dream kind of thing. There was no water,\nyou know. People were dying. There was shouting for the water, 1t was just horrendous.\nYou know, I always think, was it the fact that I was so skinny that I survived? Really, I\ndidn\u2019t require, you know, I wasn\u2019t hungry like other people, and my body didn\u2019t require\nfuel the way some other people\u2019s bodies required fuel. There could be something to it,\nyou know? So, anyhow, when we arrived in Auschwitz, 1944, I think it was either end of\nJuly or early August. And then we found out in Auschwitz that other camps were being\nevacuated from all over, meaning east of Auschwitz. You know, our camps, our camp -\nMajowka/ Strzelnica - Starachowice was located in central Poland within that industrial\ndistrict, and there were others - there was Skarzysko-Kamienna, there was Radom, there\nwere other camps that were now being all evacuated. And we knew, for example, that the\nRadom transport arrived. And one day we saw my Aunt Rose in Auschwitz, passing by -\nwe were carrying rocks this way and they were carrying rocks the other way - so we\nknew that all these other camps - we didn\u2019t know that Aunt Rosa was alive, but we saw\nher in Auschwitz - so we knew, the word spread, that all these camps were being\nliquidated, so we could figure out something wasn\u2019t going too well for the Germans,\nand...",
        "A: Oh, yes, except for me personally, Hania and Krysia were there to protect me. In the\nmarketplace, I was all alone and younger. You see, I\u2019m a little older now, and of course, I\nhave already learned to cope a little. Not that I was a lost soul, no. I was resilient in a\nself-preservation type of way but I wasn\u2019t yet totally what you call clever about things.\nBut, no, when we arrived in Auschwitz, we were the three of us. The interesting thing\nwas, of course, which we didn\u2019t know before but we now know, but most of those\ntransports, the last minute transports of people shipped out of the slave labor camps,\nwhether there was no time or whatever, they were not subject to selection. This is why\nthe five-, seven-year-old kids survived Auschwitz. We were just herded out, put into the\nso-called showers, given, thrown the clothes that they gave us, you know? Our hair was\nchopped off - I didn\u2019t say cut off, I say chopped off - so that we realized that the situation\nwas quite different. Because little children and older women and people were already just\nshoved in all at once, from all over - Skarzysko, from Radom, from Wostrowiecz (ph).",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t, no, the only thing I remember distinctly having seen Father on the platform.\nBut after that, I remember they were rushing us much in the so-called shower room or\nwhatever you call that. And maybe Hania, Anna, would tell you about how she objected\nto being pushed and shoved and screamed at and for that they shaved off her hair,\nwhereas our hair was just chopped off. They grabbed you by the hair, they put the\nscissors to it, and however it came it came, but they didn\u2019t shave your head, they didn\u2019t\ngive you a haircut, they just chopped off some hair, whereas Hania and her friend Irene\nMuller, Irka Muller (ph), who is now Irene Ross, both very tall, Hania was with her and\nobjected to the fact that she was being pushed on and screamed, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to\nme like this.\u201d So, the woman in charge, she was a Czechoslovak woman, she said, \u201cJust\nfor that, Pll show you what I can do.\u201d And she put her on the side there, and they shaved\noff her hair and Irene\u2019s hair - total zero, you know, complete bald - and we burst out\nlaughing, in total hysterics. We thought it was just so funny, because the fun in it was not\nthe fact that the hair was shaved, but because they were both tall and little heads on the\ntop, you know, the pin on top. And it was so grotesque that it really lent itself to absolute\nhilarity in these circumstances, so we just laughed ourselves hilariously silly to tears. And\nwe left that area, as we were all herded out. We left that area with Hania shaved to zero\nand Krysia, Chris, and I just having our hair, as I said, just chopped off however, and...",
        "A: No, I had no bodily hairs. I don\u2019t remember, but I guess not. But we were tattooed right\nthen and there, too.",
        "A: I think so. I think so. And we were tattooed, and I really always stress the fact that we\nlined up together for tattooing so that we had consecutive numbers, which really\ncontributed to our survival as a unit, the three of us. Because, you know, not having a\nname, you are always referred as a number, and when they call X number of people for\ndetail or work somewhere, you happen to be in the same unit of numbers, so that was\nlucky.",
        "A: Absolutely yes.",
        "A: No, not only did I never thought of it, but I was trying - I was absolutely almost forced\ninto doing it, which I very much objected to. You know, during my early years in\nAmerica, I used to work in the summers as a babysitter, as a governess. So, I went to a\nhotel in the Catskills with a doctor\u2019s wife, you know, he was a surgeon - a plastic surgeon\n- and they had two children - one girl was about four and a baby like eight months old.\nAnd the mother used to be there with the two kids in a bungalow on the hotel premises\nand we used to eat in the dining room, but we lived separately, and the husband used to\ncome for the weekends. Well, anyhow, when he discovered I had - I got the job through\nhigh school, through my high school, but that is another story, but an interesting story.\nBut anyhow, I go to this camp, and it was in Wingdale, New York. And of course I had\ncame to meet them, and then the doctor used to come for the weekend, and he noticed my\nnumber. He said, \u201cYou know, I am a plastic surgeon. I\u2019d like to remove this number.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to remove it.\u201d So, he says - he thought - you know, those\nwere my salad (ph) days - and he says, \u201cListen, I will not charge you, you have nothing to\nworry about. I will do a fine job and it won\u2019t cost you a penny. After, you come back to\nNew York, you come to my office and I'll do it for you for free.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\nwant to do it.\u201d And I wouldn\u2019t do it. And he said to me, \u201cWhy would you want to have it?\nWhy on earth would you want to keep it? You\u2019re a young girl. Why on earth would you\nwant to keep it?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I have brown eyes, they\u2019re a part of my body. That\u2019s a\npart of my body, too, and I\u2019m staying with it.\u201d So, I kept it, and of course I never\nregretted it, never.",
        "A: Oh, yes it was painful. You know, they pulled on the skin. By the way, we had very\n\u201celegant\u201d numbers, quote-unquote, \u201celegant\u201d, because I know people who got there much\nearlier than we did. They have these horrendous looking numbers - a \u20187\u2019 crooked, an \u20188\u2019\nwas something else. By the time we got there, which was, as the war progressed, it was\nreally toward the end of the war already, they had such fine experience in tattooing that\nour numbers, Hania\u2019s, Krysia\u2019s and mine, are in perfectly beautiful sequence - even,\nreally even - so that we don\u2019t have these numbers that others had on the outside, these\nhumungous - we have these elegant numbers because they had all these - and by the way,\nI have the second serial. My number begins with an \u2018A\u2019 because they ran out of the first\nseries of numbers, and they started an \u2018A\u2019 series.",
        "A: The clothes were thrown at you. Whatever happens to be, whatever - size does not matter.\nYou get what you got and shift for yourself. If you were a size 5, you get size 27, and if\nyou're size 12, you get size 6, and after that you have to go and exchange with others.\nAnd those were rags basically, rags. I mean you know, stuff - I understand now that they\nwere shipping out to Germany, good clothes and such, so whatever was left in the piles\nwas really second-hand already.",
        "A: Actually, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so because I imagine they must have steamed them\nfor lice. There was always vermin in there.",
        "A: Oh, yes, absolutely, by then there was no hiding from the truth. Because, first of all, you\nsaw the crematories. I think by then there no five crematories left. I think by then,\nbecause you know, some of the crematories were destroyed by whatever means. The\npoint of it is we were not burned. There was no selection for burning or for gassing. We\nwere just brought in as a unit and shipped into Birkenau as a unit, and all the other camps\n- of course, we realized why this was happening. There were just too many camps being\nemptied into Auschwitz to be able to run the enterprise as they did before, with selections\nand such. So that when we came, you could smell - you could see the fire out of the\nchimney. And of course, burning flesh has a very strong odor that is nothing like\nanything else that you know. So, that was unmistakable, the burning of human bodies,\nunmistakable.",
        "A: Yes, we discovered that and, you know, my memory of all this is sort of hazy, but I do\nknow that there was a gypsy camp not far from our barracks because they talked about\nthe gypsies, and we heard that the Hungarians were being shipped in, too, at the same\ntime. But you see, this was already very - I don\u2019t know how they brought out people to\nAuschwitz as far as numbers, but I am sure with the German system, the way they run\neverything to the last detail, they probably spaced these transports. Now it was just one\nafter the other, but the Russian offensive was really nearing to Auschwitz. I mean, you\nknow, the Russians stopped at the Vistula River, and that was another political treachery\n(ph), but who knew then that Stalin wouldn\u2019t cross the Vistula, but they were coming.\nThe Russians were coming from the east, so all these camps - we were, after all, located\nnot far from the Vistula, not all that far, so anyhow... I mean, not as near as Krakow or\nother cities that were on the Vistula, but we were within the area that could be contacted\nvery quickly. However, they didn\u2019t because Stalin sat himself down and waited for the\nGermans to finish off the job. So, all these camps that were being emptied, we realized\nthat something was happening from the east. But how much could you know when you\u2019re\nliving behind barbed wires, and now you\u2019re coming here, and you see all these other\ncamps, Radom, and everybody else 1s there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, the only thing I remember is that after the war, in 1987, and I was there with\nChris, that we went to see the barrack, so then I knew that was the barrack. But I\nremember the barrack as a barrack in the interior, but if you ask me what number it was\nand to find it in the complex, I couldn\u2019t, but I was there in 1987.",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you, all these fancy words of \u201cquarantine\u201d and all this other thing, you only\nknew that there were all kinds of new horrors coming, so one horror was of this nature\nand one horror was of that nature. Personally, as I told you, I could not figure out what it\nled to or what it led from or how it figured in the larger picture. I didn\u2019t know if they\nmeant to keep us there for a month or for a year or forever or whatever. But having now\nacquired enough experience to see that nothing is certain, that nothing is permanent, that\neverything changes, and it always changes for the worse, because so far in our\nexperience, nothing changes for the better. It was all downhill and by some miracle, we\nmanaged to stay together, which was altogether a miracle, altogether the most\nunbelievable miracle. So, that we knew was a lucky break, that one, but everything else\nwas just pure horror. And this was just another thing, and God only knows what the next\nthing was going to be. And that horrendous smell of burning flesh was really... well, sort\nof like very ominous in the sense that that is maybe after all going to be, you know, the\nfinal, the final, the tail end part of this horrible journey, who knows - we didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Oh, we were told right away. The old-timers were there, of course. They said, \u201cThey burn\npeople here. They ship them in, they burn them all the time.\u201d Of course, no question!\nHow could you not know? I mean, even if you didn\u2019t know, you saw the flame.\nGenerally, if you drive by the Jersey Turnpike, you see the smoke coming out, whether it\nis acrid smoke or whatever it is, it\u2019s smoke, it\u2019s belching black or white or whatever. This\nwas fire, you see?",
        "A: Not smoke; this was fire. You saw, 1n the dark of the night, this luminous ball of fire\nagainst the dark sky. It was unmistakable. You couldn\u2019t call it anything else. This was light\nfire. Now, this light fire also had an overpowering stench. And now, here you have the old-\ntimers who tell you this. Now, how much more can you - do you need to figure out what\nwas going on?",
        "A: No, no. Because - I don\u2019t remember the sequence of things, but I remember there were\nsome girls who ran away, who escaped from Auschwitz at that time, and they were\nbrought back and they were hung. So, we already knew, you know, like the hanging in\nPoland on the square for the Christians to see when they came out, so we already knew\nthat such tactics lead to other things, that this was just a warning but watch out because\nyou re next.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I heard about it.",
        "A: We talked all the time. First of all, we sleep nine to a bunk. It is very hard to\naccommodate nine people to a bunk, so we had to talk. You have nine people herded into\none place, you have to talk. You talk because at a certain time, you can\u2019t even step down;\nyou have to be up in your bunk. So, obviously some are old-timers - although we are still\ntraveling - so-called traveling, quote-unquote - we are still within the Starachowice group\nbecause we were shipped as a unit, and we were placed as a unit. Of course, we are\nmixed in with others, of course, but we still have some of these people from\nStarachowice with us. And we were nine to a bunk, so all of us couldn\u2019t be all\ngreenhorns; some of them have already previous knowledge of what this place is about\nand what\u2019s happening. So, now there are no secrets; now we know the truth. And I think I\nmyself for the first time am beginning to realize that all these things I was trying to\nexplain away - you know, this is now 1944, and for the last two years, \u201942-\u201944, it is\nalways downhill, it is downhill, it is downhill, but now this could very well be the end of\nthe downhill, but this is more than the imagination will allow. I remember being very\nscared in Auschwitz, very, very scared, because I thought that was the end, I really did.\nBut by that time I think my attitude was a little different, you know? Sort of accepting of\nwhatever was going to happen. Because, you know, by now, we still didn\u2019t know about\nMother, we didn\u2019t know. I mean, everybody could figure out that she didn\u2019t survive, but\nwe didn\u2019t know. And what happened to Father we didn\u2019t know either, so now we\u2019re just\nthe three of us, and whatever awaited us after this we didn\u2019t know, because we had no\nidea where the war was heading, which way. We knew it wasn\u2019t good for the Germans,\nbut that\u2019s about it.",
        "A: Did I have then? No.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have nightmares, no.",
        "A: Oh, yes!",
        "A: If you were made to carry heavy rocks and then be a skinny kid, you were exhausted!\nToo exhausted not to sleep. Besides, there\u2019s something to be said for being squeezed in\nwith all these bodies. You know, you cannot toss and you cannot scream, because\nsomebody is going to poke you right away and, \u201cHey.\u201d Maybe I had nightmares, but they\ndidn\u2019t allow me to have nightmares because, when you\u2019re squeezed between two other\nbodies, how would you be able to thrash around or yell or scream? Somebody\u2019s going to\ngo, \u201cHey, shut up, you,\u201d or whatever.",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t clean... I really don\u2019t remember - I just remember the upper bunk is\nwhere we were at.",
        "A: I remember that. But there was nothing on the wood itself. A pallet, I think, but there was\nvery little.",
        "A: I think so. But that I know from having gone back now to take a look.",
        "A: You mean whose boots? Hania\u2019s boots?",
        "A: Oh, yes. No, that was exactly the time; that was exactly the time, inside the barrack, right.\nThat was Aranka. She was the head of the barrack. And you know the latrine was outside.\nTo go to the latrine, you had to have permission. To get permission, and there were only\nX number of people could go at one time so you were allowed in this group of three. So,\nwhatever, I was going to the latrine, and she caught me coming back to the vestibule -\nAranka who was as big as a horse and as fierce looking as the Gestapo themselves. She\nwas a Czech girl, Czechoslovak. And she was wearing these black boots - riding boots -\nand she dragged me over. She says to polish those boots with my spit, and I was so\nterribly offended, but I knew I could pay with my life if I didn\u2019t, because she was so\npowerful and so fat and so big and I was a skinny kid, and one blow from her, that would\nhave been the end. But I was so incensed about it. I remember that I always think about it\nin the sense of how stupid it was for me to get myself so worked up over it. Because from\nwhat I had already experienced and seen, I should have known that this is just one more\nhumiliation, but it isn\u2019t of such great importance that it should make - I cried over it\nbecause, of course, she put her foot up on the stool, and I stood there on my knees\npolishing her boots and spitting and I had very little spit to spit with, and of course she\nwould have killed me. And I felt so humiliated and offended and I never got over it for\nthe longest time. And I knew as I told you that this was out of proportion to the reality. It\nseems, as I survey my war experiences, that always it was that particular instance, it\nwasn\u2019t the general, you know? The specific and personal was the one that stayed with\nme. For having seen all these things and having experienced other people\u2019s horrible\nexperiences right next to me, those other things really count for very little, except that I\ncould really have paid with my life. But it wasn\u2019t so much the fear for my life, but the\nhumiliation that she was not German, you see? I had already accepted that anything that\nhad to do with the Nazis was dreadful and to be avoided, but the source was different. In\nother words, it was coming from a Czech woman that the humiliation was double because\nI had yet not accepted that aside of the Nazis, there were other people who could do that.\nSo, I was just absolutely - it destroyed me. But it really didn\u2019t amount to much. I did\nsurvive it, so... I polished her boots and I\u2019m sure she never knew which one of those ugly\nlooking people I was. So, there were no repercussions to it in a sense.",
        "A: No, because I did do the job, there\u2019s no question. I was down on my knees, and she was\ntowering over me. I tell you, once kick and I could have been gone.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes, absolutely, it was exactly the same. And the German said to her, \u201cThese\naren\u2019t gentlemen, these are Jews. And that Father became so humiliated. Of course, he\nwas sweeping the rail station. It was very, very upsetting to him.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. Her name was Aranka; everybody was scared to death of her because\nher physical presence was really very... threatening. And she had a very loud voice and\nscreamed a lot. I was always afraid of her, but this is not why I felt humiliated, I think. It\nwas because she was not German. Because by then I started realizing that it is not the\nNazis only that I have to fear; I have found a new source of fear that I have to watch out\nfor, and I could only handle that much.",
        "A: Yeah, the circle, so to say, 1s getting enlarged, and now I have other things to worry\nabout, because just because she\u2019s not a Nazi doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t kill me, \u2018cause she\ncan, and get away with it.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t really remember, but I do know that I felt - probably, I would guess I\nwould have felt less fear in Majowka than in Auschwitz because Majowka was still\nStarachowice and Father was still on the premises and it was really hometown, my\nhometown, even though there was no semblance to life or home or anything, this was the\nplace that was a familiar - not the camp, but the town was a familiar town. Auschwitz\nwas a totally different situation, where everything was threatening from Day 1. The\nmixture of fatherless; the total terror being surrounded by electrical barbed wire; by a\nsystem in place - you know, I think Starachowice camps were run sort of ad hoc, if you\nknow what I mean. Run it as well as you can, and if you can\u2019t, then shoot a few and kill a\nfew and run it. This was organized murder, planned, executed and otherwise set up to the\nlast detail. And then you get thrown into a situation of different nationalities, so you are\nbeginning to understand the scope of this entire drama - it\u2019s not a drama - of this entire\nepic is much larger. It isn\u2019t a little Starachowice slave labor camp that is kept to produce\nwar machinery, where just soldiers fight each other. This is another aspect of something\nthat is not yet even known or comprehended or - it doesn\u2019t seem to serve a purpose. You\nsee, in Starachowice, you could always rationalize: \u201cThey have to keep these slave\nlaborers; otherwise, they cannot win the war. If they don\u2019t produce the cannon shells, the\nwar cannot be won, or whatever. They cannot fight the war.\u201d So, however you slice it,\nthese people are not expendable because somebody has to produce war material. In\nAuschwitz, there\u2019s no such reasoning available to you because you realize this place is\nlike a dead end. It has no function as far as doing something for any reasonable kind of an\nend. It doesn\u2019t produce war material. It doesn\u2019t do anything to fight the Germans... er...\nto help the Germans to fight the war. It houses people who are getting killed. Nobody is\ndoing anything except stupid things - if anything, cutting marshes and, like Sisyphus,\ncarrying back and forth the rocks from here to there. We saw our Aunt Rose from\nRadom. One day we are on the line carrying the rocks here and she was going with the\nrocks there and we waved to her. We didn\u2019t know she was in Auschwitz. So, you begin to\nunderstand, even as I was beginning now to more or less mature into this reality of what\nit was, that this is another story all together. This is absolutely the end of the line for not\njust Starachowice people and the Jews. It\u2019s the mixture people - you get Czech people\nand they brought in the transport from Salernjica Grise (ph) and all kinds of people who,\nfor all kinds of reasons who have nothing to do with punishment. So, that\u2019s when it\nbecomes obvious that that is another thing to contemplate. So, basically, a place like\nAuschwitz, where you do not produce, cannot be explained away. It must be confronted,\neven for somebody as - somebody who tries so hard to dismiss certain things, meaning,\n\u201cWell, you know, tomorrow is another day, and this isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d But it 1s. It is. Now you\nknow it is so bad. And, you know, we still don\u2019t know that Father perished, we don\u2019t\nknow that yet. But the ambiance, and the work that is not work, and the food that isn\u2019t\nfood, and the constant roll calls, and the threats if you don\u2019t show on roll call everybody\nelse gets killed and all this, this has another dimension. And this is when, I mean, you\nsee, I have already learned to live with fear as part of - fear that could at least be used to\nmotivate me to look out and to watch out, to see that I don\u2019t become a burden to my\nsisters and to see that I can maneuver somehow through. But here, there 1s just somehow\n- things are cut off when we come to Auschwitz because you don\u2019t see anything to justify\nyour being there. \u201cWhy do they want me here? Over there, they needed the laundry, but\nhere they don\u2019t need anything. They\u2019re just feeding you for nothing.\u201d Which is another\nthing that I understood by then: you cannot be fed for nothing - whatever feeding that\nmeant - but if you are fed, that means they permit you to live, and if they permit you to\nlive, that means they have to use you for whatever you that have. But here, there is\nnothing to do. I mean, it has no connection to all the things that you have already figured\nout, that I have already figured out. So, I realized then that this would really be the end\nfor us. But I still didn\u2019t think that I would have to decide how to get out of it. I felt Krysia\nand Hania would really protect me. So, whatever happens, with three of us together. But\nthat was a dark hour; those were really dark hours in Auschwitz, the first period, you\nknow. Of course, it was getting colder, and after the quarantine we were sent to cut\nmarshes and it was getting much colder. We were standing in water. And it was\nphysically getting to be - not that it was demeaning. Nothing was demeaning anymore. It\nwas just the physical hardship was beginning to creep in.",
        "A: I think we were wearing wooden shoes, and that was bad.",
        "A: Yes, and you know, working in the marshes, we were in wetness always. And this is by\nnow probably October. You know, it gets chilly in Poland. October is a very chilly\nmonth.",
        "A: Yes, the word got around. I didn\u2019t know all the details, but I knew there was an uprising,\nyes. Because, you see, we were now mixed in with all the other - the people who were\nlonger and longest and we were the shorter and there were others the shortest. You know,\nso this was already - we arrived in, let\u2019s say, August, early August, and this is October,\nand meanwhile others came after us, but there were now other people who came two\nyears before us. So, we were getting pretty - and nine people on the - you know, you\ncould talk to your heart\u2019s content, because outside they wouldn\u2019t allow it maybe, but in\nthe privacy of your nine people\u2019s perch, you can exchange information.",
        "A: Yes, definitely, yes, but I didn\u2019t experience any of it. I don\u2019t know, I really always talk\nabout it, that human kindness is what I have actually depended on. That I have -\nSomehow, people have always shown me a certain kind of deference - not deference\nbecause of anything that I represent, in fact, because I was skinny and undernourished\nand a poor little skinny kid. So, everybody was taking pity on me, you know, so I always\nfelt no matter where I went, there was always somebody taking pity on me to do this or to\ndo that or to console me or whatever. We never had situations where we had to fight, but\nthere were people in the barracks absolutely who fought. I mean, people would kill for a\npiece of bread. And people would... But, you know, I always have this habit in me to\nanalyze things, why would... \u201cWell, maybe the Greek people, they understand things\ndifferently.\u201d I was yet to grow up to understand that people are just people. You can\ncome from the North Pole or the South Pole or anywhere in between. It\u2019s still the same\npeople and it\u2019s exactly... The only thing is that in such unusual circumstances, different\npeople reveal their character in a different way, so that some people who personify\ngoodness become even better than goodness personified. Others who have the beast in\nthem become even more beastly. You could see that among the Germans as well - those\nwho turned a tender head when they could see something wasn\u2019t exactly according to the\nrule, and those who just waited for you to step out of the line-up two inches because they\nwere ready to kill, and they were ready, and you stepped out and that was it. But those are\nall musings on a psychological kind of a reality that, in my own little world in those days\n- I could always depend on the Starachowice people who were still around, that I knew.\nAnd we were still around, mixed with them. And then there were others who were also\nriddled with fear. And then there were others that I always felt that I didn\u2019t want to be\nnear - I mean, prisoners, you know? This was a world of its own, but a reflection of a\nbigger world, I guess, which is that human beings just are about the same everywhere, it\u2019s\nthe circumstances that bring out in you whatever it is that you have in you.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember those things really. I\u2019m sure if I thought about it, I probably would dig\nit out somewhere in the recesses of my mind. But at this point, no, I couldn\u2019t off-hand\nthink of anybody, but I do know that, speaking in generalities, I could tell you that people\nalways took pity on me and were nice to me. That, I mean, I don\u2019t know how else to put\nthat. There was something about people that made them look after me.",
        "A: No, quite the opposite.",
        "A: Quite the opposite. Maybe I reminded them of their kid. Whatever it was, but it was quite\nthe opposite. And I always said to myself it\u2019s because I look like that. And I never fought\nmy way to be first in line or first to get food. I always got sort of behind, I think. That\u2019s\nvery strange when I think about it, but that\u2019s how it was. I did survive thanks to Chris and\nHania, but I also survived thanks to the goodness of other people. There\u2019s no question\nabout it. That absolutely is a fact.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, and I\u2019Il tell you why. I was so preoccupied with survival. First of all, I was filled with\nfear. And out of the fear came the fact that I\u2019ve got to manage. And you cannot let\nyourself - not that you can\u2019t - I didn\u2019t - I couldn\u2019t - I just - whatever it was, whether I\nwouldn\u2019t allow myself or whether I knew that it wouldn\u2019t lead anywhere. The fact was\nyou had to face what it was and manage. And that was what took up - you can\u2019t be\ndepressed. Because depressed means tomorrow they put a bullet through your head.",
        "A: Oh, yes. I had already analyzed this before. I think older people had a harder time than\nyounger kids. And I noticed this after the war, too, when we came to America. People\nwho already lived a life, you know? People who had lived, who were married or\nwhatever. They were forever probably, I don\u2019t know, grieving for what - I mean, I didn\u2019t\nhave time to grieve because I didn\u2019t live yet. I didn\u2019t live yet, and all I knew was I had to\nwatch out. That was just to sum it up in a very plain way. I had to watch out. And other\nthan that, depressed - I don\u2019t that that was even a concept that I could really even know\nwhat it was about. I just knew that had to stay on the mark, you know? Not to allow\nmyself to do what is not supposed to be done, and not to allow myself to be called into a\nplace that I knew would be trouble. And that was it. And that was - you know, I think\nwhen prisoners are in prison who break out of a prison, I think that\u2019s how they spend\ntheir days, thinking forever how to break out. I had no idea how to break out, and I\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t attempt it. But the idea of how to stay on the mark, it was a total\npreoccupation, which, of course, included how to survive on the meager food. It wasn\u2019t\njust the fear that could get you; it was the lack of food. And don\u2019t forget, I was a growing\nchild and did not get proper nutrition. Other people required were hungrier than I because\nmy body didn\u2019t require much, or maybe I was stupid to think that, but I really did not - I\nwasn\u2019t driven to insanity by hunger, because I was very hungry but my body tolerated it.\nSo, you see, this idea of depression, I don\u2019t know that I knew the meaning of it, because\nlife was too busy surviving. And in any way of pushing my way or whatever; just\nminding my person. And that\u2019s about all I can tell you about depression. I will tell you\n100% it was a totally foreign concept to me, if I even knew what it meant - I probably\ndidn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes. Pll tell you what, I used to use... Il tell you now, because Victor, my husband\nVictor, loved turnips. When we got married, he said, \u201cOh, I\u2019d love for you to cook\nturnips.\u201d And I said, \u201cOne thing I\u2019m going to tell you right now,\u201d because you know he\u2019s\nAmerican-born, three generations. And I said, \u201cOne thing - I\u2019d cook anything and\neverything. Please don\u2019t ask me to cook turnips.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s a very\ngood food.\u201d And I said, \u201cListen, I have an association with the smell of turnips and I will\nnever get over it, not ever. Please don\u2019t ask me to cook it. I will not cook it. If you want\nturnips, you will have to go to a restaurant.\u201d Because, in Auschwitz, the only thing you\never got was turnips in a soup. The turnips, of course, were never washed, so you had the\nsand and the peel, and the turnip. If you found a piece of turnip, it was lucky. But the - I\ncan\u2019t say fragrance. That\u2019s too fancy. But the smell of the turnip is so deeply ingrained\nwith me with that period, that I truly cannot stand - not the sight of turnip, I wouldn\u2019t\nknow, because it looks like a sweet potato. If you cook it properly and away from me,\nmaybe I wouldn\u2019t know until I tasted it. But absolutely that is what remained - the\nbusiness with the turnips. That was food. I think they gave out coffee once - Coffee with\na capital \u2018C\u2019 - that was the water with a little chicory in it, I guess, and a piece of bread\nand the turnip soup. That was food.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t remember. I just know that there were other people who were\nalways hungrier than I was. I was very, very hungry, but I was not as hungry - I think\nHania was always hungrier than I was. She was always tall, very tall, I mean, as Polish\nwomen go, I mean, as people from Poland go, even Jewish, she was very tall, and I was\njust a skinny kid, but Hania was tall and I think her body required more food than mine.",
        "A: I think so, and I knew people who really, truly suffered from hunger more than I. I used\nto dream about food. You see, you asked me whether I had nightmares. No. You know\nwhat I dreamt about? I dreamt about the table settings my mother used to put out. My\nmother used to love to serve elegantly. I love to remember that. And I remember this\nparty and I remember the settings. I remember the food that was on it, but the settings, I\nwas obsessed with the settings, in my dreams, in my recollections of home. So, that was\nreally, that was part of getting fed.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: Yes, as a matter of fact, as time went on, and we would always have proper settings and\nthere was not much to eat - a boiled potato - because that kept a semblance of a life. But,\nof course, in Auschwitz you could dream about it. I mean, Mother used to set beautiful\ntables - I don\u2019t mean during the war. But you know, I even dreamt about sugar cookies,\nthose sweet... sweet... beet...",
        "A: Yes, sugar beet cookies, because when she learned to bake that during the war, I even\ndreamt about that, and that\u2019s quite a leap from looking at an elegant table.",
        "A: Oh, all the time, all the time, all the time people used to talk about food.",
        "A: Yes, they talked about recipes. They talked about what they saw in display windows. If\nthey happened to be from the same town, \u201cOh, you remember, this pastry that had this\ndisplay of every day fresh...\u201d Whatever. Absolutely, all the time.",
        "A: It was.",
        "A: No, [ll give you an analogy. When I cook, you know, I like to cook, I used to cook\nfancier because now we\u2019re eating all this other simpler stuff. But in the days when I was\ncooking, and I would have a party, whatever, I would have no time to eat, and I was so\nhungry, hungry, but I had to cook, so I said, \u201cWell, let me first start cooking.\u201d And by the\ntime I was done cooking all these French dishes with the wine and all, I was so satiated\nfrom the fragrance, this beautiful fragrance of the food, that by the time I was done with\ncooking, I really didn\u2019t need to eat. I definitely didn\u2019t need to eat because the idea plus\nthe fragrance, the wonderful wine cooking, would fill me. That is analogous to the fact\nthat, if you, perhaps, if you talked of food that was really part of another setting, and I\ndon\u2019t mean food just for the eating of it, but for the sustenance and the other thing that\ncomes with food, that that could fill you. Not for long, because eventually, five, six hours\nlater you still would wake up hungry and famished, but that is the only analogy that I\ncould think of. And it is true. It is absolutely true because people were talking all the time\nabout food.",
        "A: Yes, yes. You know, people were describing this or these people talking about ptishye\n(ph), which were like profiteroles au chocolat, so you remember, and then it filled you.\nSo, I guess there has to be something to it if so many people did it.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think there were any cigarettes. I remember that during the war they used to\nroll in a piece of paper and I don\u2019t even think they had tobacco; I think they had crushed\nleaves or something. My father was a smoker, though, but not my mother. Women, I\ndon\u2019t remember that women smoke. Or maybe they did, but certainly not in camp.",
        "A: Oh, to barter, yes, not to smoke.",
        "A: To barter, absolutely. Let\u2019s say you wanted a piece of bread. So, you sold a scarf to get a\nturnip, then you exchange the turnip for cigarettes, and then you barter the cigarettes for\nbread. You see how that went? You were a non-smoker. The cigarette was a means of\ngetting the bread in a circuitous way.",
        "A: Very, but the final object was bread. How you arrived at it is another story, but cigarettes\nwere very often involved. It wasn\u2019t because you smoked them for yourself or smoke...\nWho eventually ended up with the cigarettes, I have no idea.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know. This is out of my hand.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I really, I don\u2019t know. If there was, I am not aware of it at all.",
        "A: No, how could I be, considering who I was and how I looked and who, I guess, would\nlook at me? That was never, ever... Later on, when we were past Retzow and after the\nLiberation, that\u2019s a story further on, when we were inside of Germany and the Russians\ncame, and we were warned that they rape women, so we should run away and we should\nnot stay there. That\u2019s as far, but, but even by then, I didn\u2019t ever think of it. The only thing\nthat I was afraid of in - unless other women experienced it in Auschwitz - that if you were\nsick and had to stay behind on the bunk, and you couldn\u2019t go to the outside, to work, like\nin the marshes like we did, that they would come and drag you out and they would do\nwith you what they wanted to do with you, whatever that meant, but I guess that meant\nprobably more of being killed than... Yes, but you see after the Auschwitz detail left, and\nbarrack had to be emptied, they went through the barracks to see if anyone was hiding\nbecause sick people who couldn\u2019t make it to the roll call... So if they found you, they\ntook you whenever they took you, but that was never, ever an issue, not with me.",
        "A: You mean in Auschwitz? Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, in fact, somebody just reminded me that Chris and Hania actually were asked for\nthe jobs and I wasn\u2019t. I was going to be left behind. No, this was an opening in - maybe\nI'll sort of put a frame around it - We are now in Auschwitz since, let\u2019s say, early August.\nWe have been in quarantine and we have worked in the marshes and it\u2019s getting very\nmuch colder, very much, because winter is setting in. There is a detail of women that is to\nbe sent to a place where they sort clothes that is left behind by political prisoners, not\nJews, not Jews. We don\u2019t yet know why or how, but they request, I think, thirty women\nor whatever to be sent there. So Krysia and Hania are picked for the detail, and I am not\nto be in the detail because I am small. So, somebody intervened on my behalf and she\nsaid, \u201cShe is a hard worker and she\u2019s very smart. She would be very good.\u201d So, instead of\nthirty, they let go thirty-one. And we arrived... The first week, we went to work and\ncame back to the barrack, or maybe the first two weeks. I don\u2019t remember. But in the\nbeginning, we went there and then came back. What we found out is that the women at\nthat job, that\u2019s still Auschwitz property, except this is a sort of a separate unit - that the\nwomen, political prisoners, were somehow involved in the Polish underground or they\nwere in cahoots or whatever, so they were shipped out. So, now, they didn\u2019t want any\nmore Polish women Christians; they wanted the safer type, which is from the Jewish\ncamp. So, again, as I said, I don\u2019t know if it was a week or two weeks or three weeks -\nwhatever it was, originally we went there and back, there and back at night. Eventually,\nwe didn\u2019t go back to the barracks in Birkenau; we stayed there. And that was a Heaven\nsent. First of all, 1f got cold outside. We didn\u2019t have to go to the marshes. Second of all,\nwe were dressed now properly; you see, because we were next to those piles of clothes,\nso we could pick what we had, what we could wear. And now it was getting colder, so\nshoes were very important - very. So, we had warmer clothing, better shoes, and we\nworked at that detail, and these women were a very interesting group. They were all very\nintelligent, and they had real political connections. Some of them - we discovered one of\nthem, Christina Jevulsha (ph), that she was Jewish actually, but she was a Polish political\nprisoner, passing for a Christian. Anyhow, we worked at that detail up to the evacuation\nof Auschwitz, the death march, and that really saved our life because we were already\ngetting terribly run down from the outdoor work in the marshes, you see, and now it was\ngetting worse because the winter was coming. And because we worked in that place -\nprobably two months or so - and we slept indoors and we worked indoors, and we were\nwearing better clothes. So when the death march, the evacuation of Auschwitz took place,\nwe walked out on the death march wearing proper clothes, meaning warm clothes for\nwinter, and our health was restored because we didn\u2019t work outdoors, and I think the food\nwas a little better, too, although I do not remember exactly what the feeding was, how\nthey - it was institutional food, and it was doled out, but 1t probably was a little more than\nthe turnip soup with the sand in it. And that - you know, it seems, in that whole saga of\nthis war experience, it seems that there were already a little - there was a little interval\nthat allowed us a little breathing space which restored the soul and the body before we\nwould face the other horror. So, luckily, that stretch of time - which wasn\u2019t more than\nprobably two months - allowed us to really, by not working outdoors, not to really come\ndown with whatever, you see.",
        "A: Yes, very much. But, you see, this was such an exceptional setting which was totally\nstrange to us. The clothes of political prisoners were hung up, numbered. If a political\nprisoner died, the stuff had been packed and sent to the family. If a political prisoner was\ntransferred, the clothes traveled after them. We were engaged in packing. And of course,\nHeaven help you if you stole something or took a thread out of it. And the fact remains\nthat I couldn\u2019t imagine that a thing like that existed. Send the clothes of that prisoner\nback to the family? I still don\u2019t understand it in the scheme of the genocide, of the Nazi\ngenocide, why that was done. I mean, these were Christian, obviously, but what was the\nimportance of sending the clothes back to the families? After all the harassment and the\ninhumanity that they have shown the human beings, that they should be concerned about\nclothes being... I just, it doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. But luckily for us, that was the case. And\nso I learned to pack. But that was, it was good because we were in a more civilized\nsetting, to begin with. These Polish women were very good. They were very intelligent\nand there was very little of that animosity, the Polish-Jewish type, no, this was rather...",
        "A: Yes. I think most of them were shipped out. I think thirty or thirty-one were shipped out.",
        "A: Yes, somebody had to be left behind to show the newcomers. But I do know that they\nwere in touch with other Polish prisoners, but, of course, we never were aware of really,\nof what was going on. But I do know now that they had contact with the Polish\nunderground.",
        "A: Yes, the woman who did help us wrote a book about it. She liked us, so writes in the\nbook that we were not the pugnacious type, and she noticed that other people knew how\nto fight their way out and way in.",
        "A: Felicia Hyatt, Felicia Berlant Hyatt (ph). She was a scribe in the barrack, and she took a\nliking to us. And she, when the request came for people, she picked us, and she was the\none who was instrumental in my being attached to this detail. And she wrote not a very\nnice chapter, it\u2019s in her book, it\u2019s called Short Calls...something Calls, what 1s it...Close\nCalls. And so she was instrumental in that she took a liking to us, she said they were\nintelligent girls and we didn\u2019t know how to fight our way out so, whatever. She says that\nin the book. So, anyhow, that\u2019s how we ended up there, and that was a lifesaver.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, the only choice we were given to others who did stays, was like my friend Hannah\nTenser from Israel, who was left in the gas chambers because they ran out of gas, or other\npeople who were too sick to move; they were left behind as refuse. But we were just\nmarched out like everybody else. But we were lucky that we were dressed well because it\nwas January and it was cold. So, I don\u2019t know that we would have made it. Maybe we\nwould have - other people did. But it helped to have good shoes and to have good clothes.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "A: Yes. We had access to the piles of clothing that they wanted... You know, when we got\nthere, they said take off everything you have on and go pick something that fits you - not\nfrom the prisoners but from the Jewish property. So, we had shoes to fit and clothes to fit\nand it was warm, because we were there toward, you know, in the winter.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I only know that we went on a march, and I only know that I completely lost my\nmind. And I fell asleep while walking. I was sleepwalking. I absolutely fell asleep, and\nChris and Hania were dragging me. And the whole march is one - it\u2019s not a nightmare,\nit\u2019s completely obliterated except for what I remember: the snow was on the ground, we\nwere marching down a country road or whatever, with dark trees on each side and snow\nin the middle, and it seemed like a place - an enclosure. So, I was walking and they were\ndragging me, but I was dead asleep, totally. And I always talk about it, when, every now\nand then, they would stop everybody to relieve himself, and Chris and Hania would squat\ndown and tell me to relieve myself, but I wouldn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t here; I was in the\nother reality, so that - it\u2019s true, and so finally...",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: It was to Gletwitz? I didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s where we went, right, I didn\u2019t know. Gliwice\nnow, right. And I didn\u2019t know where we were walking, and I have no recollection except\nfor this enclosure, white snow and the trees.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I have no idea. I walked as much as I could and the rest I slept. I know one thing which I\nam very proud of. When we got to a certain big barn with where to stay overnight, and I\nmust have been terribly clumsy or horribly tired, and I wasn\u2019t moving right, and a\nGerman came and knocked me in my face - this is the second time, by the way. I once got\nhit in Auschwitz like this - with a ring; he was wearing a big signet ring, and he knocked\nme, and I fell right down at the barn door, and everybody else was chased into the barn. I\nhad the presence of mind when I woke up, when they started blowing whistles for\neverybody to get up, I had the presence of mind to stand by the door, and found Krysia\nand Hania as they came out. But that was...One day I have to have this made to...I have\nto account for it, how it came about that I slept through this march. At least half the way I\nslept through.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. They were pushing me, you know. They were pushing me\nand talking to me and I kept sleeping, and I truly don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Not sleepwalking, I was just sleeping. I do remember that I never thought of the place\nwhere I was as I was as the place I was in.",
        "A: I thought that was somewhere - because, the dark skies - we walked at night - and the\ndark trees and the white bottom. So, I\u2019m now in an enclosure. I\u2019m not outdoors. You see,\nI am not outdoors. I am somewhere in an enclosure, walking down. But how that jives\nwith the reality, that I\u2019ve never figured out, but that was a fact.",
        "A: No, they just dragged me. I mean, there was no reason, I mean, to wake me, so if I\nopened my eyes - I probably had my eyes open, but I was sleeping. I was really very\nmuch asleep. Much of the trip, I was asleep, until we reached Gleiwitz, was it?",
        "A: ...on the train, yeah, they were in open cars, and the snow was falling, that I remember\nYeah, because by the time we reached Ravensbrick, I was awake, having slept myself\nout on the train. You know, we sat in open cars, so the snow was falling, and we ate the\nsnow off our coats, so that between the fresh air and not having to walk and the snow,\nwhich was moisture, I came to. And when we got to Ravensbriick, I knew, finally I saw\nthe sign \u201cRavensbriick\u201d\u2019. I did read it; I did see the sign. So I knew we were in another\nplace, not that place that was an enclosure.",
        "A: Um, many times, but not at this particular - I mean, by then I realized everything sort of\nwas a chance, you know? Chancy, things were chancy, things were too chancy and all\naround. So, if I was going to die, that means that\u2019s what came up. Because there was no\nplanning, you know, there was no planning, there was no decision making on that score.\nIt\u2019s just how the wind carried you. If you were too exhausted and your legs were swollen\nand you fell by the wayside, that was the end. But it wasn\u2019t that you planned what I\u2019m\ngoing to do ten days later, nothing. You just went with the event, went with the flow, as\nthey say.",
        "A: Krysia was sick, yes, Chris was sick one time. I forget what was her... her legs? No, I\nforgot. She was sick, and then she got better. You\u2019d have to ask her, but I do remember\nshe was sick, yes. But, you see, on the death march, I wasn\u2019t sick. I was just over-\nexhausted or whatever. And you see, I always talk about the fact that I was skinny, and I\nwasn\u2019t hungry, but maybe my body was growing and required more - maybe it didn\u2019t\nrequire food but it required rest. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a mystery.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: No, but I do know - I know that it happened, but I don\u2019t know how it came about or\nwhere or whatever.",
        "A: Yes, because Ravensbrick, as you know - this is about the end of January or so, early\nFebruary - and Ravensbrick was so overrun with people. All these camps that were first\nevacuated from Poland into Germany, and then from Germany and Poland into - they\nwere just shoving them in. They put up tents in Ravensbriick; there were no more\nbarracks available. There were tents. So that it really, you were so, now - now we were\ncompletely disconnected from the original group. We were still traveled - when we were\nin Auschwitz we were very much with the group - but because we were not evacuated\nwith the Starachowice people, we came there with another group, and then we got mixed\nin with all kinds of nationalities and people camps that you never heard of and that you\ndid hear of and so on. So, it didn\u2019t matter who you were. You could have told them you\nwere Roosevelt\u2019s daughter, you know, for that matter. You could have picked out\nsomething out of the blue moon, or King Farouk\u2019s first wife, whatever, you see? So, if\nHania said that or Krysia said that, it must be so. But, as I told you, it wasn\u2019t my decision.",
        "A: Very bad - it was the worst.",
        "A: Because it was disorganized. Not that it was disorg-... It wasn\u2019t in any way planned to\ncontain the number of people that were shipped in. It was in no way organized with a\nplan for the future, even, because the war was now turning, you know, the war effort of\nthe Allies was now taking shape. So, that the Germans, whatever they were up to, knew\nonly themselves, but the fact 1s that a place like Ravensbriick that had all these people\nshipped in - and maybe the decision wasn\u2019t yet made what to do with that, with these\npeople, I don\u2019t know - but the fact remains that the camp was overrun. We stayed in a\ntent. There were no more people possible to squeeze into the barracks. You can imagine\nthey accommodated you now in the Grand Hotel now, in the tent, because, I mean, this\nwas beyond any setting, especially since they always were so organized in the - their\ngenocidal plan included every detail on down the line, and this was, of course, already\nout of their hands. So, that was rough; that was bad. The food was - no food and no place\nto stay in, and just chaos.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I think we used snow, or something like this. That could very well be.\nBecause we ate snow, and we probably cleaned ourselves with snow, too.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Frankly, I don\u2019t even think they registered us. I mean, if you consider what was\nhappening at the time, with the influx of the people. I really don\u2019t remember, I truly, I\ndon\u2019t, but it was so chaotic that I can\u2019t imagine that they would still be able to count or\nwhatever.",
        "A: Uh, no, not from Auschwitz. Later on I had the \u201cX\u201d\u2019, white \u201cX\u201d on my coat, up front and\nin the back.",
        "A: I think it was from Retzow, yes. It was a white enamel \u201cX\u2019\u2019, big \u201cX\u2019\u2019, right down from the\nshoulder down on both sides. But my recollection of Ravensbrick - I don\u2019t know how\nlong we were there. Ten days? A week? Not long. But it was total chaos.",
        "A: Yes, in fact, we have a friend from Israel whose mother we saw in the melee of people.\nWe saw out of nowhere. Mrs. Linsburg, we ran into Mrs. Linsburg. And years later, we\ntold the daughter who survived, who lives in Israel. She lost her mother somewhere in\nRavensbrick and she never found out what happened to her - No, her mother disappeared\nand she never know where. And we told her, we saw her in Ravensbruck. We just\nglanced at her in Ravensbriick, because she was in Ravensbriick. But what happened\nafter, we don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m telling you, it was total chaos, so that it was just\nimpossible. And people who were with each other, if they were separated, then that was\nthe end of that.",
        "A: No, no, we didn\u2019t know yet.",
        "A: No, because we had to find out from the men, you see. It\u2019s the men from Starachowice\nwho knew what happened. I don\u2019t know at which point we found out about it. I don\u2019t\nknow, but we did have to find it out from the men.",
        "A: Probably, I don\u2019t know. Or maybe we already knew. I couldn\u2019t tell you for sure. But I\nknow that we did find out that he perished in October, October of \u201944.",
        "A: In all likelihood, we\u2019ve thought that in all likelihood that she would not turn up because\nwe\u2019d seen too much and heard too much. We heard too much. You see, having now been\nmixed in with all the people from Auschwitz and in Ravensbrick, with the influx of\npeople from every conceivable part of Poland, it was very easy to piece things together.\nSo that...we had a pretty good idea I think by then, but not a certainty, and certainly did\nnot give up the idea that they might still be alive.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I remember that, yeah. And, not I, but Krysia and Hania, Chris and Hania, we\nall volunteered, and... As I\u2019m fond of saying, we volunteered for what? We didn\u2019t know.\nIt could have been going up the chimney, but we volunteered to get out of Auschwitz, not\nto go wherever - we didn\u2019t know...",
        "A: Out of Ravensbruck, right. We volunteered because things have gotten to be totally\nimpossible, totally. So, they said, whoever wants to go, get on the truck, but where the\ntruck was going nobody knew. But that was a very fine choice, because these were the\nfirst shipments out of Ravensbriick, and we ended up in Retzow, which was an empty\ncamp, which was later to be receiving other prisoners, but we were lucky enough to staff\nthat camp. I ended up a maid for an SS woman. Hania ended up a maid for the - in an\noffice. Chris didn\u2019t have a good job - I forgot, Chris told me, she reminded me the other\nday how I spoke on - you know, this I have to really relate again because...\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10",
        "A: Yes, I forgot. She actually reminded me of it, but I remembered after she refreshed my\nmemory. I worked for the SS woman. Our section, the women\u2019s section of Ravensbrick -\nof Retzow, excuse me - was ran by SS women, and they were a category of their own,\nawful, brutal people. And they of course needed servants, and I was one of the personal\nservants. She lived in a room. I did her laundry, I brought in wood to keep the stove\ngoing, you know, and cleaned the house and so on. She took a liking to me, but I was still\na Jew. And she would not come near me ever. I would walk in, she would walk out. And\nif she talked to me, she talked to me from another end of the - because she just wouldn\u2019t\nbe near me. So, then she started leaving crusts of bread for me. She didn\u2019t like crusts. So,\nshe said, \u201cIll be leaving this crust. If you find it on the table, that\u2019s for you.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cThank you very much.\u201d So, meanwhile, one day she came in and she says, \u201cDid you\nfind the crusts I left for you?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, thank you very much. I eat them.\u201d And she\nsays, \u201cHow are things going for you? Who are you here with? Do you know anybody, do\nyou have family?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I have one sister who works in the office, she cleans\nthe office, and then I have another sister, but she does not have a good job.\u201d I forgot what\nKrysia did. She says, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll get her a good job.\u201d So, Krysia was assigned to the\nkitchen, and that was really a great, wonderful thing. Of course, she was the most vicious\nthing, but in a very paradoxical way, I really benefited greatly toward my liberation from\nbeing her servant, because they were so - they lorded over everybody so you not only had\nto do for her and so on. When the evacuation of Retzow was organized, we had to carry\ntheir rucksacks. They took their stuff, and we had to carry - the maids had to carry - not\nGod forbid somebody else. So, when we were evacuated from Retzow, as the eastern\nfront was approaching, the Russians were approaching closer and closer; the war was\nalready going toward the end. I think this was by then probably April - end of March,\nearly April. When we found ourselves on the road with all the evacuees of every stripe\nand of every possible persuasion, because you had the Jewish prisoners of war - Jewish -\nyou know, prisoners from the concentration camps, and you had Polish laborers who\nworked on the farm, and you had German military and German out of uniform, and\nGerman civilians with dogs and cars and whatever - we had to carry their stuff. And then\nwhen it came to a point where the road was so clogged up we couldn\u2019t move, they told us\nto sit down. Well, we made a way - there were the few maids that were carrying the\nrucksacks - and by the way, I kept saying that there were twelve of us, but Hania\nreminded me it was ten, and Helena was one. There was one woman there, Helena, she\nwas blonde, one of the servants, or whatever. She spoke German very well. I think she\nwas from Krakow or somewhere. When we made it off the road, the main road where the\nevacuees were, I had this woman\u2019s rucksack with all her belongings, so in final analysis, I\nproved to be a skunk, because what Helena did - she was carrying somebody else\u2019s - and\nyou know, they had those black capes, these women, they had black wool capes that they\nwore. So, Helena put her cape, the cape over her clothes and put the woman\u2019s hat, and we\nall decided... No, I didn\u2019t decide... But the ten of us, not the twelve, the ten of us who\nmade it off the road, onto the field and away from the evacuees on the road, were\nsupposed to pretend that we are the prisoners and Helena was our guard, and she was\nguiding us - no, not guiding us. Guarding us. She was guarding us, you see. So, we had\nthe paraphernalia, the German paraphernalia. So, she probably, in the final analysis, the\nSS woman, who trusted me, who took a liking, she probably said, \u201cWell, like all the\nJews, she betrayed me.\u201d She was so vicious, she was very, very... But to me, she was\nabsolutely wonderful.",
        "A: I cannot explain it. I cannot explain it. The mere fact that she didn\u2019t want to be near me\nbut she left me crusts of bread, that she asked me if I have it well, if everything 1s fine,\nand if I have family, on the one hand. And then on the other hand, I saw how what she\ndid to other people. So, I cannot explain it.",
        "A: From the time we left Ravensbriick, which probably was February or so, in February.\nYeah, about a couple of months, right, because the evacuation from Retzow was about\nearly April, for 1945.",
        "A: Well, the food was better because - I really got ahead of my story - but I didn\u2019t say that\nafter we - those trucks out of Ravensbrick - that brought us 1n, all the so-called spots\nwere filled with us, maid and this and the other, women were brought in - in fact, some of\nthe people we knew from Poland - were brought into this camp, because there was an air\nforce base, a German air force base, not far, and they were digging anti-aircraft ditches or\nwhatever. So, these laborers were supposed to be working for the - maybe not only the air\nforce - no, airport, or whatever you call it. Anyhow, once the camp was filled, we found\nthat there were people who we knew from the other camps. And, of course, we had it\nvery fine now, because having to work for the German women who didn\u2019t really want us\nto mingle with the population, so we slept in separate quarters under the kitchen. So\nKrysia always brought down a little more bread, and so that was really fine. And so we\ngot restored again before the big evacuation on the road.",
        "A: Yes. Now, Chris remembers it much better, and I know that Hania fainted and all this, but\nI don\u2019t really recall this. I only remember it because Chris told me about it. I really truly\ndidn\u2019t remember that. I\u2019m beginning, you know, as I analyze and think back, I really\nthink I that I obliterated certain things from my mind. Because I have a very distinct\nrecollection about certain things and none about other things, so there has to be some\nselective thinking here. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, ten women, ten.",
        "A: No, we are, the total of us is ten.",
        "A: Yes, Helena is, because she is wearing the black cape.",
        "A: She has blonde hair and she speaks German very well. And we slide down an\nembankment. Because, you know, the traffic came to a dead stop. Every - you couldn\u2019t\ngo if you tried - everything on the road. It isn\u2019t that we stopped for our own sake. There\nwas no place to move. All the cars and all the trucks and all the military equipment and\nall the peasants with the wagons, and everything is stopped dead. And they are\nmeanwhile giving out rations from Sweden - packages, Red Cross packages from\nSweden.",
        "A: On the road, in the middle of all this. And the German women are grabbing the cigarettes\nlike crazy - there are cigarettes then - and these German women with whom we served,\nthey are grabbing them. And I remember getting sardines there; we got sardines. But\nanyhow, I remember, we are stuck on this road, which is completely choked up traffic,\nand we slide down an embankment - we don\u2019t slide, we go down an embankment. The\nfields are a little lower than the road on an embankment. And we as far as where there 1s\nlike - no, not snow - cut grass piled up. What do you call that?",
        "A: Hay, right. We go behind these haystacks and we sit there hoping to sit 1t out, to wait\nuntil they move on. And before we know it, a person comes over, a man. He hears us\nspeak Polish, and he asks if we\u2019re Polish. And we say, \u201cYes, we\u2019re Polish. We ran away\nfrom this here, this evacuation route.\u201d And he says, \u201cYou know, there is a lot of Poles\nhere because we\u2019re working on the, in the farm. Why don\u2019t you go to that house over\nthere and tell them I sent you, and they\u2019ll put you up.\u201d So, that\u2019s what happened. We\nwalked away. Nobody ever missed us. We got to the villa, it was a German villa, and we\nstayed there until the Germans came That\u2019s how we were liberated - except, one of the\ngirls among the ten was a Russian, and she said the Russians rape women, so we should\nnot stay around, which we had no intentions of staying around, no intention. We just were\nmostly here to get back and find out finally, put all of the pieces of the puzzle together to\nsee who survived and who... So, very soon, we started toward the railroad and we got on\nthe trains going back east. But that was easier said than done because everybody - people\nwere so dislocated, and everybody wanted to get east, further east. So, we were on the\ntrain for a few stops, then we got bumped off. And then, there were Russian soldiers\nriding and all sorts of other people, and then we got on the train again. We didn\u2019t know\nwhere we were going, but we were going east, wherever the train will take us, as far as\nBibgost (ph). Bibgost (ph) we knew was sort of a - what do you call it - a cross-, no, sort\nof a central line crossing. We still didn\u2019t know - we thought we were going to\nStarachowice, of course. We just said, \u201cWe\u2019ll make our way to Poland and from there,\nwe'll worry about going to Starachowice.\u201d But we met a Russian soldier who was Jewish\non the train, and he told us, if we\u2019re Jewish, not to go back, because it\u2019s not safe in those\nsmall - he asked us how big a town it was, and we said, \u201cSmall town.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t go back; go to a big city.\u201d And we said, \u201cBig city? But we don\u2019t anybody.\u201d He\nsays, \u201cNo, you go to a big city, and you can register with the Jewish agents. And that\u2019s\nwhere you can find family, not in a small town.\u201d Which is what we did, we went to Lodz,\nand he gave us an address of his sister, so we stayed overnight, and then next day we\nwent to register, and we were given a place - not an apartment. It was a bombed-out\nplace, but they assigned it to us, the Jewish agency. And I think they gave us ration cards\nor something like that. And soon enough, we found out that Uncle Alexander survived,\nthat he was in Lodz. And, of course, then we started finding out what happened, that all\nthese people who were resettled [shakes head] were no longer alive, because they were\nexterminated. They were not resettled. And all the people that might not show up didn\u2019t\nnecessarily get resettled either. They died of a million different causes. If it wasn\u2019t\nstarvation, it was sickness. If it wasn\u2019t sickness, it was a bullet. But then it came out that\nthere were extermination camps, which served only the purpose of killing en masse. And\nthat was something totally new. We knew about shootings on the highway and on the\nroad and starvation and typhus. We knew; we saw it; we were part of it. We never really -\nof course, in Auschwitz, we also knew about Auschwitz - but we had no idea about all\nthese other places, where all this was happening at the same time. So, the resettlement\nwas a euphemism, and how the secrets were kept for all those years, when the Germans\nwere committing the most heinous crime of all history, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how\nthat could altogether happen without people knowing, but that\u2019s how it happened. And\nwe settled in Lodz, you know, after the war. And Hania and Chris went back to Poland,\nand I told you about Genia (ph), that maid of ours. She absolutely said she had nothing,\nand she threatened them. And Mrs.Paliszewska - that night, the little children that came\nback from Auschwitz were killed in my hometown. And Mrs. Paliszewska - one of\nwomen of the Paliszewska sisters worked at the railroad station, she sold tickets there,\nand they lived very near the railroad station, so she secured tickets for them and put them\non the train and they came back to Lodz. So, that was where the end of the war found us.",
        "A: Well, we are really in shock still, because we survived, and we still cannot figure out how\nit happened that we did survive. We are not yet aware of the entire truth of everything.\nGrandmother - after all, we had a tremendous family, extended family, on my mother\u2019s\nside especially. Originally, there were nine children - I don\u2019t mean children - nine\nsiblings, who had all the kids and their kids, and my father\u2019s family wasn\u2019t so large, but it\nwas large, too. So, eventually, we pieced it all together to find out that people perished.\nBut it really took many years before the truth came out because, as you know, people\nwere reluctant to talk about it. Everybody was busy trying to live, to return to normal life,\nand nobody wanted - was willing to talk about Holocaust. They just lived through it; why\ntalk about it? So that, not too many things were yet known, but we knew now for a fact\nthat Mother had perished in Treblinka, because we knew that the transport out of\nStarachowice, after the original evacuation of the Jewish population, from the square\nwhere they were segregated, that those trains when straight to Treblinka. So, we knew\nthat. Then we knew that a lot of people perished in Starachowice camp, and then they\nperished right along as we got along. So, then, of course, it came out that there were such\ncamps where slave labor was not required. The ultimate purpose of that camp was\ngenocide, and that only Jews were being selected for that genocide. So, that was a total\neye-opener. But, you know, life went on. Chris met Miles and they got married, and they\nsort of adopted me, so I stayed with them. I went to school while we were living in Lodz.\nHania, Anna, went to school of diplomacy in Warsaw. But we lived with Uncle\nAlexander - Miles, Chris, I and Uncle Alexander. Uncle Alexander went to Sweden\nbecause his wife survived - she survived in one of the camps like Retzow - but she was\nshipped out to Sweden because she was quite ill at liberation time. And that was -\nsubsequently, Miles, Chris and I went to Berlin, and I went to school in Berlin. And we\nwere in Berlin from about March/April of \u201946 until January of \u201947, because we arrived in\nAmerica February 11\", in 1947. So, that chapter was closed. We more or less knew how\nour parents perished. We also found out from people from Ostrowiec what happened to\nGrandma and the aunts. I had two aunts living there. One was single, and the other,\nRegina - another Regina - Aunt Regina, who was married, and Angia, who wasn\u2019t\nmarried - they lived with the grandmother because they ran a printing shop. And so they\nwent - Regina with her husband and Angia and Babka - and Grandma - they all were sent\nto Treblinka, as well, because Ostrowiec was slated for Treblinka. And my father\u2019s\nfamily, only my cousin survived. One aunt, I mean, Uncle Alexander survived with his\nwife, and then one of my father\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter, survived, and a cousin, Angia, who\nlives in Israel. And the extended family numbered - I cannot begin to tell you because I\nwouldn\u2019t really know, but really, a very big number. And we did have three uncles who\nescaped from Poland in the 20\u2019s. Not escaped, but made their way out, because they were\ngoing to be conscripted. So, they made their way out, and they lived in Canada, so we\neventually got in touch with them. But as far as the Holocaust story of our family is\nconcerned, I mean, this is in essence not just a narrative covering our survival, the three\nof us, but really, the extended family, how that was decimated. Unfortunately, you know?\nIt was such a fine family, you know, my mother\u2019s big family. But unfortunately that\u2019s all\ngone. We\u2019ve made peace with that, you know?",
        "A: No, you see, I mentioned before in the interview that I felt older people had a harder time\nin the camps, and I also think they had a harder time after the war, whether adjusting to a\nnew language, a new country, a new culture, or whichever, or altogether, even if they\nwent back to stay in Europe, adjusting to the emptiness, to the horror that was still in the\nsoil, so to say, European soil. In my case, I found that, because I had never lived and I\nalways wanted to taste life, I had no time. I had absolutely - I came out of the war like a\nracing horse coming out of a stable. I was ready and willing and raring to go. I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to look back and I wasn\u2019t going to contemplate and I wasn\u2019t going to analyze, I\nwanted to live. And I did. Everything, you know that - in fact, when I was in Jefferson\nHigh School, and Dr. Horowitz, who - they gave me a big party for my 18\" birthday\nbecause I\u2019d done this and that - so, he said he wanted the newspaper to write about the\nparty, so he brings in people from the newspapers - the Jewish paper and the Post - the\nNew York Post was in those days a different paper, liberal paper - so, this guy is\ninterviewing me for the Post, and he says, \u201cI understand you have a number. Could you\nshow me your number?\u201d So, I showed him the number, and he took a picture of my arm,\nand that\u2019s how the Post printed it - me and they wrote about the birthday party and how\nthe whole class was throwing me a birthday party and that I was a victim. So, when he\nsaid for me to show him the number, I thought, \u201cIsn\u2019t that ridiculous.\u201d But I didn\u2019t want\nto disappoint Dr. Horowitz, because it was in his house and he was doing the party. I\nthought it was so ridiculous to start dwelling on those things. I am just trying to show you\nby illustration how I felt. I had no time for that. That was a closed chapter. Now, I didn\u2019t\ngo to school yet, I didn\u2019t finish anything, I wanted to study, I wanted to do, I wanted to\nlive, I wanted - I loved to dance. Here I am going to go through the thing - I\u2019d had\nenough of it! And I really think a lot of people felt that way if they were yet young\nenough to more or less not to have the broken spirit because they had known already\ngrown-up life, you see. So, I just burst right into life in America. In fact, I already had a\ngreat time in Berlin, when I was in Berlin. But when I came to America, that was\nabsolutely everything, because I mean, I could now do all of these things, including going\nto school and going to college and having a great time and marrying and having\nwonderful children and all this. Of course, now, because I have translated a lot of works\non the Holocaust, I discovered - I have been discovering constantly new phases of the\nwar that I was totally unaware of, because I didn\u2019t even want to dwell on it So, now, all\nthese years later, 50 years later, I am first finding out about, okay, I knew about the Lodz\nghetto, I wrote - I translated a book on this. So, I knew about this ghetto and I did this\ncamp and such camp, where there 1s true translation or true people I know. But there is a\nwhole world of Holocaust experiences that I never even knew about, which I am finding\nout about now. But in those days, when I came to the United States, why would I want to\nbother with that? Who had the time for that? I didn\u2019t have time. I didn\u2019t have time for\nanything, only for forging ahead. And that, I think, carried me through life, in the sense\nthat, if I look back, of course, I always, always think of my parents and the loss of my\nparents and the loss of my family, the tremendous loss of the family. But to regret the life\nthat was? I cannot, because, if I went back now, that life would be nothing like the\nwonderful life that I had in America. So, you cannot go home again, and I don\u2019t want to\ngo home again, because I\u2019ve been to Poland twice, and believe me, that would be the last\nplace I would want to live in, under the Communist regime, especially, you know? So\nthat, to sum it all up, I was lucky enough to be young enough to survive the war as a\nyoungster, and to still be able - even though at the beginning, I did feel a little\nimbalanced, you know, my head was a little bit further away - higher - not higher - more\nprogressive - my head progressed a little better than my other emotional, but eventually,\nit evened out, you see? And of course, I sort of apply the experiences to my life as it\u2019s\nlived from day to day. For example, everyone said, \u201cHow much do your kids know about\nyour background?\u201d My kids always knew everything they wanted to know. They knew I\nwent through the camps, and I told them all the time, \u201cPlease ask me. I will never set you\ndown and say, \u2018Sit down and I want to tell you this.\u2019\u201d I never did that. That was never - I\nsaid, \u201cBut if you want to know, anything you want to know, I will tell you.\u201d And every\nnow and then I would relay an anecdote, and of course, they saw the films, and we\u2019re\nvery close - our family generally, you know, our family - the Lermans and the Wilsons\nand the kids and the grandkids - we\u2019re very, very close. So you know, the stories are\nexchanged, but not as an imposition. I would never think of saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hear\nmy story.\u201d I myself wasn\u2019t interested in my story when the war ended. I just wanted to\nsay, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s another chapter, case closed, keep on going.\u201d So, that was my attitude\nand still is. And, as you noticed, I am very short on specifics. For example, my sister\nAnna, she knows a lot of specifics about the hierarchy of the camps and who was what\nand how the camps were run. I don\u2019t know. I just know the particulars pertaining to my\npersonal survival. And the fact that, when the war ended, everything was fresh in my\nmind, but I wasn\u2019t interested. I wasn\u2019t interested in me, period. I was interested in the\nnew life, and the me could wait. And of course, 1t waited until now, when every day I am\nfinding out about another thing that I never knew about. So, the other day I read in the\nPolish press about Dietwagner (ph), this Polish community not far from Warsaw. Now,\n60 years later, I am first, first finding out. Now I read avidly, whether it\u2019s in Polish or in\nEnglish, on the subject. But in those years, it wasn\u2019t taboo. When I married Victor I told\nhim, \u201cAnything you want to know, ask me. But I don\u2019t have patience nor the time for\nthat.\u201d There were other intellectual pursuits and other pursuits. I had to fit 1n all these\nother things that I missed. I\u2019m going to talk about Auschwitz and about Ravensbrick?\nWho needs it?\nEnd of Tape #10\nTape #11\n[Picture shown]",
        "A: This picture was taken in Lodz in June 1945, right after we came back from Germany to\nPoland. And I have a few of these at home, and because of their size, I am quite sure that\nthey were made for identification, meaning for my passport or ID cards or whichever. But\nthis is what you call an official picture, and this is really what I looked like after we came\nback. I was 15\u2019.\n[New picture shown]",
        "A: This is a group picture taken in Berlin, in a DP (ph) camp in Berlin, probably somewhere\naround June or July in 1946. I think our class was celebrating Lakbaumer (ph). At any\nrate, we were the oldest group in that school. We were on the high school level at that\ntime. And if I were to identify, on the extreme left is my friend Tunia Rebak Couture\n(ph), who lived in Argentina and unfortunately passed away a year ago. Next to her is\nRachel Kafaigenbaum (ph) whose married name was Gross. Unfortunately, she passed\naway four years ago. Next to her, I am Renia or Regina Gelb. Going further to the right\nside is Hanka Drescher (ph), living in Argentina, also. We have kept in touch with her.\nNext to her is a girl whose name I really forgot, and the last one 1s Heike, that was her\nname, but I really even don\u2019t remember her last name.

We met in New York\nthree years before we were married. We met in 1950, and Victor went to the army in the\nmeanwhile, because it was the Korean war, and I was at Indiana University, completing\nmy degree, and when I got back, and Victor was just honorably discharged from the\narmy, we got married, which was the right thing to do.\n[New photo shown]",
