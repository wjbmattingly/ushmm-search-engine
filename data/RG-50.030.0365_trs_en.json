        "Q: Good morning.",
        "A: Good morning, Joan.",
        "Q: Can you tell us your name and the name that you were born with, because I know it is\ndifferent than your name now, and when you were born and where?",
        "A: I was born September 17, 1916, in Hannover, Germany. My name at that time was\nBernard Fuchs, and I was born and raised in Hannover; and until 1936, I went through\nthe schools and read the Nuremberg law, and it became too hard for us. I had to leave the\nuniversity because no Jews could study further.",
        "Q: Let's go back a little bit. Tell me about your family -- about your mother and your father\nand sister.",
        "A: My father and mother both came from L\u00e9dz. They had left Poland around when the war\nbroke out, 1914 -- no before that -- 1913, they went to Elsass-Lothringen, which is part of\nFrance now and was at that time also. And there they lived until 1915 when they went to\nlive in Germany. Father was a custom tailor, and he built up his own studio and built up a\nwonderful clientele. He was really the number-one custom tailor in Hannover. And my\nmother, may she rest in peace, died very young. She died already 1928, when I was 12\nyears old and is buried in Hannover. My father remarried in 1932 and had another son in\n1933 and -- when I had to leave the university, I went on hash'alah\u2019 to be processed to go\nat that time Palestine. But my father got sick. He had a very serious operation, and he\nasked me to stay back and take care of his wife and son. So, this way, that is why I did\nnot go to Palestine at that time. Then in 1938, there was a big Aktion\u2019 by the Germans\nwhere they took all foreigners, that means stateless or not, of German nationality -- Jews\n-- and collected them all in a concert hall in Hannover, and -- where we stayed for a day\nand a night. And then they took us in cattle trains to the Polish border.",
        "Q: I'd like to go back. It must have been very difficult when your mother passed away at\nsuch a young age for you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And when your father remarried, I gather you didn't stay at home after that happened?\n' It is unclear what the interviewee said, however, it sounds as if he said \"hash'alah.\" The\nfigurative meaning of \"hash'alah\" is \"on loan\" (Hebrew).\n* Any nonmilitary campaign with political, racial, or eugenic ends (German).",
        "A: No, I left home. And -- I could not stay at that time. I just couldn't live with her. It\nbecame impossible. So, I had left when I was 14.",
        "Q: And you lived alone?",
        "A: I lived alone, yes. I lived with friends, with their parents. I rented a room there. And I\nearned money, and at that time I paid the rent there and lived until the Aktion started.",
        "Q: But you remained close with your father and sister?",
        "A: Well, I had to, yes. My sister got engaged to be married with a -- not a Jewish man -- but\nwe liked him. He was a very nice man. He was a dress manufacturer, special designed\ndresses. And so how far back do you want me to go now?",
        "A: You can certainly talk about this, sure.",
        "Q: And when the Aktion started, as I mentioned, we were sent to Poland, and when we came\nto the Polish border, on one side we had the SS with the bayonets pointed at us, and on\nthe other side we had the Polish with bayonets pointed at us, and we were 1n no-man's\nland for 48 hours before some intervention the Poles opened the border and let us into a\nvery small village. The name is Zbaszyn. There -- I was always an organizer -- so when\nwe went there, there was no housing because it was a small village and here we were\nabout 2,000 people. So we organized. I took a few young people and we put\nhandkerchiefs around our arms, our sleeves, and then we went and cleaned out pig sties\nwhere the cattle was and also some housing which were empty. So, there we took care of\nthe old people and the sick people and the children; some children were born right there.\nAnd we were in Zbaszyn until six weeks before the war broke out. In the meantime, a lot\nof people who had family in Poland were released and they went to their people, and so\nmy father also went back to Lodz because he had two brothers living there with their\nfamilies and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in Zbaszyn because it was just\nabout six weeks before the war started. Then I went to Krakow with -- myself with some\npeople that I had befriended and then later to Czestochowa. In Czestochowa, I stayed\nuntil I think it was September 1940. The ghetto in Lodz had already been closed the first\nof May. So, one evening a car came with a man named David Gertler, and he came in\nwhere I lived in Czestochowa, because I had corresponded with my sister in Lodz, so she\nknows where I was. And she had sent this man with an SS man in a private car to pick me\nup in Czestochowa and took me into the ghetto to be reunited with my sister and father.\nI was not too long in the ghetto, just a few days, when I got a call from Rumkowski,\u2019 an\nElder of the Jews, for a long interview. And there he said, \u201cI want you to take over the\nlabor department because we have to register every Jew, every child in the ghetto\nbecause we have to give them work.\u201d For work we will get bread and we can live. So we\nregistered --",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. You're how old at this time?",
        "A: At that time I was 24 years old.",
        "Q: What was your sister -- your sister's name 1s?",
        "A: Dora.",
        "Q: What was she doing?",
        "A: She was the executive secretary of the Rumkowsk1.",
        "Q: Did you know this when you were writing to her?",
        "A: No. I knew it only when I came to the ghetto.",
        "Q: Was it surprising to you that she sent an SS man to get you?",
        "A: Yes, only then I realized why she could have done it because of her position. She was\nable to do that.",
        "Q: Did it worry you when these people came to the door?",
        "A: At first, yes, at first. But immediately when he told me who he is and what he came for,\nnaturally I was relieved, and naturally I went with them to be reunited with my family.",
        "Q: When you saw your family at first, did your sister explain to you about Rumkowski and\ntell you things about him so that when you met him you had some idea?",
        "A: No, she just told me of what is going on and what has to be done because Rumkowski\nwas in a position to deal with the Ghettoverwaltung,\u2019 to tell them you give us material.\nWe will manufacture it and in turn you give us food and whatever we need.\n> Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski (1877-1944); Chairman of the Judenrat in the Lodz\nghetto.\n* \"Ghetto Administration\" which also oversaw the activities of the Judenrat (German).",
        "Q: Let me ask you something in terms of reflecting back a little bit. When you were in\nHannover and the Nazis took over, you were in some sense fighting the Nazis, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You remember the Maccabees?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Can you explain what that organization was?",
        "A: It was an underground organization of students who, like me, had to leave the\nuniversities, and we decided to make sabotage. We became, like in other words, terrorists\nand we got hold of explosives and we broke up -- we bombed their trains, any transport\nof the SS people and stuff like this. So, we really gave them a hard time.\nAnd in 1936, I was arrested for the first time by the Gestapo for three weeks, interrogated\nevery day, the same questions asked, but they could not have any proof or couldn't tell\nanything of what I had done, so they had to let me go. That was in 1936. Then in '38, I\nmentioned to you already, I was sent to Zbaszyn in Poland.",
        "Q: So, when you got to L\u00e9dz, what did you think the Germans were doing in the course of\nthe war to these Jews, since you had already experienced the Nuremberg laws and kicked\nout of the university, and at least some violence against the Jews?",
        "A: Absolutely, yes. When I came to the ghetto, and I was told and I saw with my own eyes,\nof how the people have to live in the ghetto, and naturally I was right up in arms. I could\nnot digest it that easily. And when the Elders of the Jews called on me to head the\ndepartment, and naturally I was pleased that I got to do something productive for the\nghetto, even though people today have said I worked with the Germans and helped them,\nwhich is naturally it's nonsense because if we would not have done what we did in the\nghetto, in 1942, that ghetto would have been liquidated completely and no one would\nhave survived. And thanks to Rumkowski, and thanks to his negotiation power he was\nable to convince the Germans, and actually the Lodz ghetto became a model for all the\nghettos in the other areas. So, three days and three nights we registered all the people.",
        "Q: How did you do that?",
        "A: Well, I got a staff and I got an office and people came day and night. There were\nhundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, and we were able to do it in three days\nand three nights and everybody who registered also got where to go, to what factory. So\nwe delegated people directly into the various factories.",
        "Q: So, Rumkowski sees you and tells you to head -- did you head this department by\nyourself at that point?",
        "A: At that point, yes, I organized it myself.",
        "Q: So, how long did it take you to figure out this organization after he had spoken to you?",
        "A: Well, I was given people to interview and I interviewed the people and whomever felt\nthey could do the job I would tell them, yes, they were hired.",
        "Q: So how many people were on your staff at that point?",
        "A: At that time I couldn't tell you exactly. It was over 20. Between 20 and 30 people.",
        "Q: Now, when you registered, did you have cards printed out so you could register people?",
        "A: Yes, we had books and later on we made big index cards. But people themselves, they\ngot a piece of paper with where to go, where to report to, to what factory, and with this\nthey were given 1.d. cards and cards to be able to get food, like food stamps, coupons for\nfood. And this entitled them to a soup. There were various soups around the ghetto where\nthe people who worked the factories were able to get a soup. Some a little bit heavier,\nsome a little bit lighter soups, as you can imagine. And as the time passed, I had, for\ninstance, I took a very sick-looking person out of a factory and delegated him to a kitchen\nwhile I took a healthy- looking guy from the kitchen and put him into the factory. So,\nwith one signature of mine I made a friend and an enemy, which you can understand. The\nones who worked in the kitchen, they were sitting. They got a little bit more to eat than\nthe others. So, this went on, then, until 1944 --",
        "Q: Now you're moving too fast. When you're registering people, there are clearly some\nelderly people and there are kids who probably can't work.",
        "A: They still got cards. They still were registered.",
        "Q: And did they go with family members to certain factories or would they stay in an\napartment?",
        "A: They would register but they would not actually work because they couldn't work. They\nwere unable to work, but if we would have left them without registration, without 1.d.\ncards, they would die for hunger because they wouldn't get any rations.",
        "Q: So, everybody is registered whether they are really working or not.",
        "A: Yes, everybody had to be registered.",
        "Q: And when you came into the ghetto and you're registering there are almost 200,000\npeople, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What is happening with housing at this point? When you came in was everybody living\nwhere they're supposed to be living or are they moving around?",
        "A: Well, they had since the ghetto was closed the first of May. Naturally, all these people\ncoming from the other side of the town into the ghetto had to be housed. So, naturally,\nthere wasn't enough housing available for every family. So you found in most cases that\nin one room lived four families. In every corner a different family, OK, and the\nconditions naturally were unbearable to live, really, because there was no running water.\nThere were no toilets in the room. People didn't have bathrooms. They would have to go\nto outhouses. And they would have to go and pump the water from a pump and bring it\nup into the room. So, the conditions naturally as you can imagine was anything but\nhuman.",
        "Q: And were there a number of pumps in different parts of the ghetto?",
        "A: No, mostly in every house they had some water supply, but it was like I said: no\nbathroom and not every house had running water.",
        "Q: Were you living with your father and your sister?",
        "A: Yes, in the beginning.",
        "Q: I gather that your father's second wife and child had left?",
        "A: No, she had left in 1939 to England. She was a nurse by profession and she got a job in\nEngland as a nurse, so she took off with her son and went to England.",
        "Q: And had your father wanted to go and they didn't allow him to, or you don't know?",
        "A: She didn't get any papers for him. She got papers just for herself and her son, and father\nwas very active in the ghetto also being a custom tailor. He was always working and had\nalso quite a few tailors working together and they made for these people, even for the\npeople in the ghetto. He had to make their suits for them, right.",
        "Q: Once this big registration happened, with all these people, and all of the people are going\nto their particular factories or work places, what is then your job? What are your\nresponsibilities once that happened?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: What would be a day?",
        "A: They were always going movements on. People had died from hunger. They had to be\nreplaced.\nOK, so, there was always a lot of switching of personnel because you can imagine so\nmany people and so many various factories, so there was always something going on\nwhere the department of labor had to act accordingly, right. So, there was always\nsomething going on that kept us busy.",
        "Q: Were you meeting with Rumkowski regularly?",
        "A: Not regularly but often. He came to my office or I was called upon for meetings. And --\noh, yes, frequently I saw Rumkowski, yes.",
        "Q: What was your relationship like? What kinds of things would you discuss? Would it only\nbe business or were you also discussing the situation?",
        "A: Well, if we were socially somewhere together, then yes, I would talk with him a little bit\nabout various subjects and incidents which occurred which I wanted to know more\ndetails about. And also, about my background, what he wanted to know. But otherwise,\nhe was very busy and there wasn't much time for socializing, except when we had\nconcerts. We had our own orchestra, and so it was really a city by itself in itself.",
        "Q: Was this a hard job for you?",
        "A: It was not an easy job, and especially when the Aktion took place when they asked for\n800 people or 1,000 people or 2,000 people to be sent out allegedly to other working\ncamps. I had no dealings with this because I left this to my partner, to Czenszenski.",
        "Q: When did he come in?",
        "A: He came in about a year after I had the office organized, and then later on when we got a\ntransport from Czechoslovakia there was also a gentleman who was told by the Eldest of\nthe Jews, by Rumkowski, to work with me in the department of labor, especially for the\nCzech people. So, we had actually three at that time heading the department.",
        "Q: And who was the third?",
        "A: Anders was his name. He came from Prague. Terrific elements in that transport.\nProfessionals, very intelligent people but unfortunately they died like flies.\nThey could not adjust themselves to the conditions of the ghetto. When they came into\nthe station in Marysin, where we had our railroad station, they asked, \"Where we can get\na taxi? Is there a hotel?\" As funny as it seems, but at that time, the tears came into my\neyes when I saw these people and unfortunately we lost so many of them at that time very\nfast.",
        "Q: Now, you said that when -- the department of labor was somehow involved in the\ndeportations?",
        "A: Well, naturally they were asked by Rumkowski to select certain people at random to be\nsent. The first transport for instance were the three Fs\u201d in German: Fleisher,\u00b0\nFuhrmann\u2019...what was the third F? I don't even remember the third. Well, in any case\nthese three groups, from three groups the transports, the first transports went to a labor\ncamp and a lot of them survived, thank heaven, because they really went to working\ncamps because Auschwitz came later on and naturally we didn't know that. We had no\ndealings with the outside world and there was no communication with the outside\nworld...and the Lodz ghetto.",
        "Q: There was no underground radio?",
        "A: Yes, underground radio, I myself with a friend of mine, Dr. Smulovitcz, we had a radio.\nWe listened to the radio at nighttime and we lost a very important person because of that\n-- Doctor...Irene, she would remember the name. He was shot because he listened to the\nradio. He was caught listening to the radio. That was a very dangerous thing to do but we\ndid it.",
        "Q: What did you learn when you were listening to the radio?",
        "A: We learned about the war what was going on but naturally of what happened with us we\ndid not being informed through the radio, we didn't know. Only much, much later we\nfound some little paper in one of the cattle carts that came back, that they went to\nAuschwitz -- \u201cOswiecim\u201d it's called in Polish, and -- but it was a rumor but nobody really\n> The interviewee is probably referring to occupations, not surnames.\n\u00b0 butcher (German).\n\u2019 carriage driver (German).\nhad facts because nobody returned from there. But they, a lot of people survived even\nAuschwitz and Birkenau.",
        "Q: But the 1942 transports went to Chelmno.",
        "A: Which we did not know, I did not.\nAs a matter of fact, some of the first transports could write into the ghetto. We received\nmail into the ghetto from these various camps. So, how we were supposed to know that\nthey are going to their death? Nobody actually knew, nobody knew.",
        "Q: And you think Rumkowski didn't know?",
        "A: I don't think he did because he heard the same rumors that we heard.",
        "Q: What was daily life like? What time did you get up in the morning and where did you\neat? Did you eat at home?",
        "A: Well, I finally got myself an apartment and I found Irene in 1942. I engaged with her in\n1942.",
        "Q: Tell us about your meeting.",
        "A: We had a date to meet at a friend's house.",
        "Q: Why did you have this date?",
        "A: That evening. And, well, I saw Irene when she walked on the street, and I fell in love\nwith her, just by seeing her the way she walked. And then when I saw her face, so it went\nwith it. So, I said to one of my O.D.* men, who was always my lifeguard if you want to\ncall it, I said to him, \"I want to meet this girl. I want to meet this girl. You have to make a\ndate for me.\" And it happened to be that I was at that time I had a slight cold or\nsomething. I was home and -- no that was afterwards. So, finally we made a date and he\nmade a date with her not telling her that she had a date with me. So, he made the date\nwith her and it was late at night and she was an hour late and he still was there but he was\njust about going away when she came. And she came and the whole night she was sitting\nand talking and I was serenading her, playing on my violin and finally she fell in love\nwith me, too. So, then one evening in November, the 11th of November to be exact, we\nhad -- in a friend's house, she was ready and I went to her parents and I asked for her\n* Ordnungs Dienst [Organization for public order\" (German).\nhand. I want to marry their daughter and they allowed this. They said, \u201cOK, you can\nmarry our daughter.\u201d\nThen I went to the party where we met for the evening and I said, \u201cCongratulations we\nare engaged to be married.\u201d And that was then the way I met Irene and then we married\nin June of 1943, by the Elders of the Jews, together with 18 or 19 other couples.",
        "Q: Did you life change?",
        "A: Since then? Well, to me in my eyes, yes, because she's a wonderful woman, very bright,\nvery intelligent, and down to earth with a lot of common sense and a tremendous\nintuition. She knows things which happen later on, she knows beforehand. And so then I\ngot an apartment with a room and a kitchen and I lived there with Irene then. And...so, I\ngot up in the morning like seven o'clock, was at my office at eight, and Irene was also\nworking in one of the factories and we lived there with the various happenings during\nthis time in the ghetto which is already known today by everybody who is interested in it\nbecause it's a matter of documentation already of what had happened in between '42 and\n'44. We have lost a lot of people by transporting them out of the ghetto, by attrition, and\nas the time passed by more and more and more starved. Of course sickness, hunger and in\n1944 the last transport to Auschwitz was the next to the last transport, there was also was\nthe Elders of the Jews, Rumkowski, and all his staff and his wife and his brother, and\nthey went to Auschwitz and unfortunately, as we learned later on, he was immediately\nkilled when he got to Auschwitz. And then we were the last transport out of the ghetto in\n'44 and we did not go to Auschwitz. We went to Sachsenhausen.",
        "Q: Let me go back and try to ask you some details.",
        "A: OK.",
        "Q: I know that it's difficult. Did people come to you and ask you for favors? I mean you\nwere in a position to make decisions?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you must have been put in situations where people asked you to do things.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: For them and other people?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you talk about some of those kinds of difficulties?",
        "A: I will not remember the details, but one thing was certain, that I did not take any bribes.\nNobody could buy me, and I did it to the best of my ability and to my conscience. So, if\nsomebody asked me a favor and I could do it I gladly did it, and if I couldn't, I couldn't. I\nhad to say no. But that I did really select someone to do a favor, no, I did not.",
        "Q: There were some mass demonstrations and strikes early on.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you have sympathy with these strikers or did you find them disruptive?",
        "A: Well, these people did not know the background of why the happenings what happened\nso they tried, they thought by striking or by demonstrating they could better their lives by\ngetting maybe more bread or more to eat, but it didn't do any good because Rumkowsk1\ndid the only thing he could do was what he did. All right, he was a little bit rough, but if\nyou put yourself into his position, what could he have done? Like for instance, the\ntransport when they asked for children, his heart was breaking, but what could he have\ndone, because if he wouldn't have done it, it would have been worse. Because, for\ninstance, a transport was supposed to go out of the ghetto and they could not fulfill the\nquota, they came in and blocked off, you know, two or three or four houses and took\neverybody that was found in there and sent them away. So, what was the lesser evil?\nNothing could have been done.",
        "Q: Do you remember that day when he gave that talk about \u201cgive me your children\u2019\u2019?",
        "A: No, I don't remember, and I wasn't there. I wasn't there and I did not take part in that.",
        "Q: Did you hear him speak?",
        "A: No, no, I learned it when I saw the film. I knew that a transport had to go out, but I did\nnot hear the speech. I wasn't present when he spoke.",
        "Q: Did you decide not to go or were you just doing something else?",
        "A: I tried to stay away from all the various Aktions.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: I didn't want to take part in it.",
        "Q: You had police protection?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Two guards with you?",
        "A: Yes, well, they stayed in the office to keep order because when there is a line of people\noutside everybody wants to be the first. Everybody tries to be -- so they kept order.",
        "Q: So, it wasn't to protect you, or was it as well?",
        "A: The main reason was to keep order and then also to protect me.",
        "Q: Were you in danger, do you think?",
        "A: Listen, in a position like I had, well, naturally people, as I mentioned to you before, with\none signature I made a friend and an enemy at the same time. So, naturally, not that I was\nscared or something like this but everybody had to be careful because you never know\nwhat people do when they're desperate. So they kept order. Now, then, as I mentioned we\nwere the last transport. Only 800 people were left in the ghetto officially to liquidate the\nghetto. We were sent to Sachsenhausen. In Sachsenhausen, we were there for two weeks\nand then we were bought as slaves by a firm and we went to Koenigswusterhausen,\nwhere there were new barracks put for us and naturally also straw mattresses. We worked\nand made to cut certain wood and plywoods which we sent away to be assembled -- we\ndidn\u2019t do the assembly -- and we understand they were boxes sent to the eastern front\nagainst Russia. They would put certain ice-melting stuff in there, like some flame\nthrowers or something like this, and thank heaven the war did not last two weeks longer\nbecause I probably would have been shot for sabotage because what I cut on the circular\nsaw was a quarter of inch too long, a quarter of an inch too short.\nWe dealt with centimeters. It was a half a centimeter less or half a centimeter larger, so,\nbut it wouldn't fit together. So, thank heaven it ended when it ended because otherwise I\nprobably would have been killed for sabotage.\nWhat else can I say, what else can I tell you? In the mean time I had other experiences,\nlike my back was broken -- not broken but fractured, because one day I had to go into the\nforest to build some tank traps and next to me was a man, an elderly man, who could not\nwork. So I did something for him so one of the SS men who watched us came over and\ntold him to work, and he was just leaning over his shovel and said, \u201cI can't, I can't.\u201d So,\nhe hit him, and when he hit him I said I will work for him. I will do his part. So, he gave\nme over the back with his rifle and I had a slight fracture of L-2, as they call it in that\nlanguage. And I was hiding for a while because I could not stand, but thank heaven it\nhealed. And I needed an operation which was performed in 1966 and thank heaven\neverything is all right. So any further details you would like to know?",
        "Q: Yes, I want to go back to the ghetto.",
        "A: Let\u2019s go back.",
        "Q: You had a newspaper or more than one newspaper in the ghetto?",
        "A: We had a newspaper in the ghetto, yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of it?",
        "A: No. It\u2019s a blank.",
        "Q: What kind of a newspaper was it, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Well, daily routines, what has to be done, some what happened, and really I don't recall\nright now. It\u2019s a blank.",
        "Q: Do you recall whether this was a newspaper put out by the Jewish council and\nRumkowski or was this done by --",
        "A: Oh, definitely within the ghetto.",
        "Q: But by the organization of the ghetto as opposed to --",
        "A: Yes, by the organization not because everything that came from the Ghettoverwaltung\nwould be on a poster.",
        "Q: Was there any underground newspaper?",
        "A: Not that I know of.",
        "Q: Now, when you went to concerts, did they have cafes and concerts? Were there a lot of\ndifferent sorts of cultural activities?",
        "A: Well, they had the theater and the orchestra. Yes, they gave concerts.",
        "Q: Did one have to pay, use the money from the ghetto to go, or was this free?",
        "A: No, it was free.",
        "Q: And what was the money used for?",
        "A: Inside, people bought themselves cigarettes, hand made cigarettes, various things. It\ndidn't have any value outside the ghetto, it was only within the ghetto.",
        "Q: Did this money have Rumkowskt's picture on it or some of the money?",
        "A: Yes, oh, yes.",
        "Q: What did you think of that?",
        "A: At that time it was absolutely natural for me. It was an organization. It was a city.",
        "Q: Was anybody else's picture on the money?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Were there coins as well as paper money\u2019?",
        "A: There were coins, too, yes, but mostly paper money. What else would you like to know?",
        "Q: What kind of a hierarchy between people who came in richer and people who came in\npoorer and people who came in from outside, the Czech transports, the German\ntransports? Do you remember gypsy transport coming in?",
        "A: I don't recall. We got a lot of transports coming from little villages and towns around the\nvicinity of Lodz, but I don't remember.",
        "Q: Do you recall whether there was a difference in treatment with the people who were\nalready in Lodz from the people who were coming in from transports who might not, then\nhad to get apartments or parts of apartments? Do you think there was a distinction\nbetween those people?",
        "A: Well, I would say that some of them who were affected by the newcomers, as you want\nto call them, because they had to share a room with them or whatever, so naturally they\nmight take objection to it.\nBut in general, everybody tried to help, actually, the other.",
        "Q: Was there sufficient -- I don't mean a lot of food -- but could every one get something to\neat or was there a lot of starvation among certain groups, do you think?",
        "A: There was starvation, absolutely.",
        "Q: That must have been very difficult?",
        "A: It was difficult. It was difficult because the bread ration which varied from time to time\nwas too much to die but not enough to live. But eventually and slowly people starved,\nstarved, and no resistance to sicknesses and a lot of people got tuberculosis and just died\naway. So, it was very much decimated by people going on transport, being sent out of the\nghetto and by attrition, and died by starvation. So, from the 200,000 people coming to the\nghetto, there were in 1944 maybe, maybe by estimation, I estimate maybe 30,000 or\n40,000 people left. They either died away or were sent on transports.",
        "Q: Was there a different kind of work for men than there was for women in terms of the\ndivision of labor you have there?",
        "A: Well, naturally, it is as you have today, too. There are certain jobs women can not just do\nand men have to do it, but I don't think there was any distinction made and women had to\ndo the same work as the men, at least they were delegated to do the job. Whether they\ncould do it with the help or without the help it's a different story, but we could not make\nany distinction between the various genders.",
        "Q: Who took care of children if both parents or every adult --",
        "A: There were Kindergartens. Children had to go and stay over the day and were taken care\nof, which was one of the fort\u00e9s of Rumkowski because children was his life.\nBefore the war, he was heading an orphanage and they were taken care of but naturally\nthe same thing. They didn't have enough food and a lot of children died.",
        "Q: Did the children get a ration or did the children share the parents ration?",
        "A: No, they got their own.",
        "Q: They got their own?",
        "A: Yes. Every head had to get a certain ration. That's why they had to be registered. Whether\na child or the elderly, it doesn\u2019t matter. They had to be registered to get the 1.d. and to get\nthe ration card.",
        "Q: When you remember the people that you were seeing and talking with, do you remember\nif people were depressed, they were frightened, or was there a kind of accommodation to\nlife?",
        "A: No, no, it was very dim. People tried to live as good as they could. In other words, they\ntried to make the best of it but naturally you can not help it. They had to be depressed\nbecause nobody knew what the next day would bring. And so, the whole situation made it\nso that you had to be depressed.",
        "Q: So, you were depressed, too?",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. Because I saw with my eyes of what had happened to these\nvarious people. I saw them. They hardly could walk and they had to go to the factory. So\nwhen you see the people walking hardly being able to put one foot in front of the other\nand knowing that they have to go to do some job otherwise they wouldn't eat, you\ncouldn't help it. You had to be depressed. You couldn't put a wall around you because\nyou lived with it.",
        "Q: Do you know people who committed suicide?",
        "A: I personally didn't know anybody who committed but we had plenty of suicides, yes.\nThey could not just take it anymore.",
        "Q: Did you ever think about it?",
        "A: Of suicide? Not at that time. Well, I was prepared for it.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: I had made two rings, one for myself and one for Irene. We were able to get Zyankali\u2019\nand put it in the ring for when the time would come where we suffered to such a degree\nthat we couldn't stand it anymore we could take it. But then my mother-in-law, may she\nrest in peace, without us knowing it, she removed it. We didn't know it because we never\nused it. We never took it off, but the ring survived in my violin and my daughter has it\nnow.",
        "Q: Were you thinking about the ring in terms of the transport or just that the situation would\nget so bad?",
        "A: No, just the situation where we couldn't stand it any more.\n\u201d cyanide (German).",
        "Q: When was -- or did it become clear to you late in 1944 that these transports were not\nresettlement and were not work camps? Did you know?",
        "A: We still didn't know. We had rumors but we still didn't know... We didn't know that the\ntransport before us went to Auschwitz, that we are not going to Auschwitz, that we are\ngoing somewhere else. We didn't know.",
        "Q: Did you have dealings with Biebow\u2019\u2019 or with the Gestapo?",
        "A: Not directly, not directly. He came to my office maybe once or twice but I had no\npersonal dealings with him, no.",
        "Q: Any of the German personnel that were in Lodz, did you have dealings with?",
        "A: I had some dealings, yes.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: The one I dealt with was personally to me very nice, and I had not seen that he committed\nanything to the contrary. And he himself was not on the same level as the others. By \u201con\nthe level\u201d I mean psychological because he felt with us, but he couldn't do anything, but\nat least he gave me some lift up.",
        "Q: But he didn't indicate to you what was going on?",
        "A: No, no. Oh, no. He didn't divulge anything of that sort.",
        "Q: Were they brutal inside the ghetto?",
        "A: Oh, plenty of brutalities in the ghetto. I saw where they played football with a baby and\ntook the children and threw them right on the truck.\nSure, we saw brutalities. I saw brutalities where the Kripo, the Kriminalpolizei,'\u2019 which\nwere in the ghetto, which had the sole purpose of selecting jewelry and all valuable from\nthe people. They were sitting at the window and shooting at random, like a sniper. By the\nway, I had him arrested after the war, but he was able to escape so they asked me for help\nto find him. So, I told them the next time I find someone from the war criminals, he won't\nbe able to escape.\n'\u00ae Hans Biebow (1902-1947), was the head of the Lodz ghetto administration.\n' criminal police (German).",
        "Q: When they were doing the shooting --",
        "A: At random.",
        "Q: What went through your head that this meshuggenah\u201d\u2019 guy is doing this, or this is a\npolicy, or I got to try to stop it, or there\u2019s no way to stop it? Did things go through your\nhead, confusing things, when you saw this?",
        "A: Confusing in what way?",
        "Q: What does this mean? I mean, you had been in 1936 to \u201838 blowing up trains, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: After you left Lodz you were also doing some sabotage. In Lodz did you think about that\nor did it seem like the situation where one couldn't do anything?",
        "A: Exactly, you couldn't do anything. You were helpless. What could you have done? Well,\nnaturally you felt awful, but what could you have done? You were helpless. You couldn't\ndo anything. This led also to depression. There was no way. You felt like doing\nsomething, especially with my hot blood, but what could I have done? We had no\nweapons. People have asked me, \u201cWhy didn't you make a riot like they did in Warsaw?\u201d\nBecause with whom and with what? The Warsaw ghetto had dealings with the outside.\nWe didn't. They could trade something for weapons. We didn't have anybody to trade\nwith, and we didn't have with what to trade, so how can we compare the Warsaw uprising\nwith Lodz ghetto? Oranges and apples.\nSo naturally whenever we saw any brutality, it hurt. You wanted to cry out and you\nwanted to kill the guy, but could you have done? You were helpless.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s take a break.",
        "A: OK.\nEnd of Tape #1\n* crazy (Yiddish).\nTape #2",
        "Q: Bert, can we go back to your earlier years for a few minutes? Tell me a little bit about\nyour boxing career?",
        "A: Well, it wasn't much of a career, but I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, and I\nstarted to get into the ring with my name on the poster. I must have been 14 years old and\nI was a junior welter featherweight. I started boxing when I was about 12 years old,\nstarted training. The Jewish sport club Bar-Kochba had no boxing in Hannover. We had\nno boxing, so I joined the Heros-Eintracht boxing club in Hannover. And when I was\nabout 14 I was ready to go into the ring. My name was on the poster and I started boxing\nas a junior featherweight and I did fairly well, and I was just about ready to go into the\nchampionship fights when I was paired against one who was not very friendly towards\nme because we went to the same school and he was one of the first Nazis.\nWhen it came to a championship fight -- no, I'm sorry. I have to go back now. I got him\ninto the ring and I fought him and I won. I won that fight. Then about a year later, at that\ntime the Nazis started already but I was still allowed to box in that club. I fought him the\nsecond time and he lost again. Then I saw him for the first time in a SS uniform and when\nit came to that last fight I just could not hold back but, and I hit him with everything I had\nand I knocked him out, and he was the one who arrested me in 1938 to bring me in the\nconcert hall where we were sent away into no-man's land. So, that was my boxing career.\nThen, naturally, I could not go any further because at that time the Nazis were in full\nswing and full force and a Jew could not any more be in any public place for that reason.\nSo, this was the boxing career to answer your question.",
        "Q: Do you think having boxed was in any way a help to you?",
        "A: Well, I lived in sports. I played soccer for 15 years from when I was a youngster until --\nsometimes as a goalkeeper. I played two games, at 10 o'clock in the youth and at one\no'clock in the second league. So, I was pretty good at it, too. I was a pretty good\ngoalkeeper. And I was an oarsman in high school, and field and track I wasn't too fast in\nrunning, but I was in very good physical condition and I think this has helped me in\ngoing through the other bad environments I was forced into.",
        "Q: Now at the same time you were involved in music. You were a violinist?",
        "A: Yes. I did not play officially anywhere. I just played for myself and as Irene told you, I\nserenaded her our first night meeting. And I played with my daughter. The violin has a\nvery, very sentimental value because it survived the holocaust, and we had as when I\nwalked away from the ghetto that was the only thing I took with me and I kept it until I\ncame to Sachsenhausen where they took it away from me.\nAnd they took a accordion away from another colleague, but when we came to\nKoenigswusterhausen, to the factory where we were slaves, they gave me the violin and\nthey gave him the accordion under the condition that he play for them. So, every so often\nin the evening we had to play for them and entertain them while they were drinking and\nlaughing and so on. And it helped me also a little bit in the assignment, because as I said,\nI was on the circular saw, but at one time we had to go to an outside commando to a tank\ntrap, and I had that incident with that elderly man of ours and where I could not see him\nbeaten because he could not do his job so I had to take it for him. I mentioned that to you\nbefore, and so this is the violin, and I played until not too many years ago, but my fingers\nare a little bit arthritic now. They are getting stiff so 1t wasn't for me anymore, so I gave it\nas a Bar Mitzvah gift to my grandson. He has not played it as yet. He is very good on the\npiano and he's a tremendous flutist, but maybe one day he will take up the violin, too.\nHe's a very ambitious guy.",
        "Q: What did you play for these guards at the camp. What did you and your friend play?",
        "A: In the barracks.",
        "Q: What kind of music?",
        "A: All kinds of music, operetta, waltzes, I think at that time known hits.",
        "Q: Popular music?",
        "A: Popular music.",
        "Q: Did you play in the ghetto other than for Irene?",
        "A: Well, not officially as I said. Privately yes, amongst our friends, yes.",
        "Q: Did you play with a group sometimes?",
        "A: Yes. I did that, too, and also I had the violin on one of our cruises -- oh, no, I didn't have\nthe violin, but I played the violin on the cruise. It was amateur evening, a talent show.",
        "Q: This was after the war?",
        "A: Yes, it was after the war. That was the only time I played the violin officially for a crowd.",
        "Q: Can you talk about your barber and what he did for and what you ended up doing for\nhim?",
        "A: In the ghetto, I had a barber coming every day to shave me and when I needed to give me\na haircut. Naturally when you see him every day you talk about everything, also intimate\nthings in their lives and we were very friendly and he was a nice guy. And when it came\nto the curfew into the -- I should take you to the time when nobody was allowed to go out\nof the house because the Gestapo planned an Aktion where they wanted to have\neverybody in the house where they could easily get them and transport them away. I took\nthis barber, his wife and two daughters, and locked them in my apartment for the three\ndays where the Sperre'\u201d was in effect, and in doing so I probably saved their lives. Even\nafter the war we saw each other regularly and they never forgot what I did for them and\nthanks to me I think they are alive. Unfortunately, the barber and his wife passed away\nlast year, but the two daughters are living, one in Boston and the other one in Pittsburgh.",
        "Q: And Irene didn't know you had done this?",
        "A: No, after the fact she knew about that.",
        "Q: Irene was also --",
        "A: I sent her to Marysin, a little bit outside, the periphery of the ghetto. So, it was not\nincluded in the Aktion and then after she knew from them. I did not tell her anything but\nthey told her. She found out from them what I did.",
        "Q: You talked about yourself before that you never allowed yourself to take a bribe. This\nwas not something you would do?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: And there was one circumstance where someone actually came in?",
        "A: Yes, he wanted a favor from me and he offered me -- I don't even remember what it was,\nbut he offered me something and I took him by his collar and threw him out of my office.",
        "Q: I bet he was surprised at this.",
        "A: Well, I don't know if he was surprised or not but he was not very friendly towards me\nafterwards, and I couldn't care less. But I did everything what I did with a good\n'\u00b0 This term is a derivation of Gehsperre, or the ban on movement within the ghetto. The\npolicy was instituted concurrent to the violent Selektion process and prior to the\ndeportation of the Jews to Chelmno.\nconscience so I could sleep in peace because I didn't do any harm to anybody knowingly.\nSo, whatever was in my power I did for what I wanted to do not what I could get out of it.",
        "Q: When you described the evacuations and deportations, and that you wouldn't go and that\nyou sent your partner, was he willing to go? He didn't say, \"I'm not going to do this\"?",
        "A: Not that I know of. He was asked to do it and he did 1t because somebody had to do it and\nsince I disqualified myself any old way I could, then he had to go and had to do what was\nasked of him.",
        "Q: Did he survive?",
        "A: He survived and he died I think last year in Israel.",
        "Q: Did you meet him after the war?",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "Q: One wonders whether there are conversations about these circumstances or choices?",
        "A: I did not. I met, after the war I met David Gertler, the gentleman who came with the SS\nmen and picked me up from Czestochowa. I met him after the war, yes. He had a store in\nMunich, in Germany, and I met with him. Unfortunately he also passed away in the\nmeantime.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of the ghetto that you think would be important to try to talk\nabout that we haven't talked about?",
        "A: Not really, not really. But as I said, I did my duties as good as I could and I could not\nthink of any details right now which are outstanding of the normal everyday routine.",
        "Q: Did you ever think of resigning that position? Did it sometimes get to be too much?",
        "A: Well, many times I thought, but I had no choice, because even if I wanted to resign,\nRumkowski would have never allowed it. Because I mentioned a few times that I feel it's\ntoo much for me and he said, \u201cYou are doing a job, so do it, and stick with it.\u201d",
        "Q: Do you think he needed you?",
        "A: I tried to think, yes... because if I would not have satisfied in what I had to do, I think he\nwould have let me know and he would have set me aside, whether my sister was his right\nhand or not, but I think it doesn't have anything to do with it because by that time I\nshowed my own abilities, I would say, in doing what I had to do, what I was asked to do.",
        "Q: Do you think he would have punished you if you would have said, \"I'm sorry, I really\ncan't\"?",
        "A: I don't know, he might have. He might have.",
        "Q: And your sister, can you talk about her and what she had to do as far as you know?",
        "A: I think that my sister had many sleepless nights because she saw and knew more than\nanybody else what was going on inside and outside the ghetto. And one time I remember\nthey took Rumkowski outside the ghetto and he didn't come back until the next day, so\nwe had feared for the worst. But he came back and nobody every spoke of what had\nhappened. Nobody even tried to guess of why he was taken away and why he was\nbrought back. In my eyes, he was not the despot, the demigod, as people made him or\nsaid he was, because as I mention to anybody I talk if not Rumkowski, no matter what he\ndid, the ghetto would have liquidated in 1942, completely, without any resistance,\nwithout anybody I believe, without me being alive today.",
        "Q: Do you think Dora knew what had happened when he left and didn't come back\novernight, your sister?",
        "A: She might have. She never answered the question because that's another thing that people\nwanted to know, of what transpired. She would completely ignore the question, so I don't\nknow if she knew or she didn't know.",
        "Q: Do you think she ever wanted to resign? Did she ever talk to you because she was so\nclose to all of this?",
        "A: No, no. She was so much involved that she never spoke with me about whether to resign\nor not to resign. She had three girls working with her in the executive office and she\nworked there very, very hard, I know, long hours, and I'm sure it was nerve-racking for\nher, but she was quite a character.",
        "Q: Can you describe her?",
        "A: How shall I describe her? Very bright, extremely intelligent, quick to the draw, down to\nearth, and a tremendous inside view of what is happening -- all the surroundings of her.\nShe was quite a woman.",
        "Q: So you were close to each other?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Or not?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was she married in the ghetto or was she single?",
        "A: No, they married after the ghetto. She married the brother of the second in command of\nEric Yakobovitch. He was the vice president, if I can say so, and he was in charge of all\nthe factories and he was a second in command. So, when Rumkowski was unable to do\nsomething, he was the one to enforce everything. He was the one to do it, and his brother\nmarried my sister after the war.",
        "Q: Did she ever say what it was like to work with Rumkowski? Was he easy to work with or\ndifficult to work with?",
        "A: We knew it was difficult to work for him. She didn't have to answer that because\neverybody knew it was a horrible job for anybody because as I said, he really took\neverything out of you especially when you were that close like she was to him. He was\ndemanding. He was demanding, and he wanted you to do something you better do it.",
        "Q: Was he like this before?",
        "A: I didn't know him before, but I know that he was a very charitable man and was always\ngoing around fundraising for his orphanage which was very close to him. I was told,\nbecause I did not know him, naturally, from before.",
        "Q: It seems to me that the picture of any human being 1s very complicated, so someone\ndamning a person or completely praising someone may not be quite appropriate. Do you\nthink there was anything negative -- I mean you've said very powerful things about him\nin terms of what you think he was able to do that wouldn't have happened without him.\nDo you think anything negatively about him?",
        "A: Well, one thing is he lost his temper very easily... and then watch out. That's what I can\nsay about him, and you had to do what he wanted. And very, very seldom did I do against\nwhat he said. If he said A and I wanted B, I went B. I was a hothead too, you know, but it\nnever came really to a fight or something with him.",
        "Q: So, you controlled yourself in spite of your rage?",
        "A: I did, I did. Today I can say, yes, I controlled myself, but he was redheaded -- a hot guy.",
        "Q: But he also had power, so that --",
        "A: Tremendous power. He had absolute control of the ghetto. He was the man.",
        "Q: So, that if he, if you went against him, he could get you deported?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Q: That's a bit frightening to be around.",
        "A: Well, you lived with either or. You could have had the same thing from the Germans\nbecause if they didn't like something they could have done the same thing. So it was not\nan easy situation all around. All right?",
        "Q: Do you think that these workers who had demonstrated these early mass demonstrations,\nmany of them were sent in the early deportations?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Possibly because they had gone on strike?",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: Had -- and probably Rumkowski wanted them out because they were trouble in terms of\nwhat he was trying to do. Do you think they might have been the core of resistance or is\nthat just a stupid idea?",
        "A: Well, as I said, they tried to better themselves. They tried to get more food and they did\nnot realize by the same token you have today's strikes which absolutely nonsense because\nwhat do they achieve? At that time it was even more ridiculous but they didn't realize\nthat. They just tried and mobilize themselves and tried to better their condition.\nBut naturally it was in vain because what could they do? What could Rumkowski have\ndone? Just because they demonstrated, he could not go to the Germans and say I want\nmore food for my people, all right, and whatever we had we had to work for. So even\nwhen I was interviewed by Ross (ph), at his interview with me, he said how do I feel\ntoday that I cooperated with the Germans. I didn't cooperate with the Germans. Just\nbecause we manufactured something the Germans could use, well, that was our\nlivelihood. That was our bread. And a lot of people don't understand that. Okay, we made\nmunitions parts. Okay we made something the German army could use, but did we have\nanother choice? It was our work and our labor which saved us from complete starvation.\nWhat little we got but we got it because we worked for it, so there was no cooperation,\nyou know, with the Germans. So that is a misunderstanding which still goes around in a\nlot of people. But they don't think. They just go with the masses. Why? Can you imagine\nthat after the all documentation you see in public television and whatever, the Holocaust -\n- the American army when they went into these camps and made all these films of what\nthey found and still people today can say denying that there was such a thing, that it is all\npropaganda. For what propaganda? Who won the war? The Germans and the Japanese.\nThey didn't lose the war, they won it. The Marshall Plan lift them up until they are one of\nthe biggest nations of the world. Am I right or wrong?",
        "Q: Do you think that was a bad idea?",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: Can you talk about the last few months when you think about 30,000 or 40,000 people\nleft in the ghetto before the last deportations or are there more than that?",
        "A: Well, it all depends on what timeframe are we talking. We're talking 1944. We're talking\nabout the timeframe between January or February '44 to September, October. There\nmight have been about 60,000 or 70,000 people left, and all the transports took place at\nthat timeframe. We were taking into the hospital and we stayed there to be transported\nout of the ghetto. A few days before Rumkowski and Rosenblat (ph), you know, the\npolice chief and his brother and a lot of other dignitaries went with the transport to\nAuschwitz. We however, went, as I mentioned, to Sachsenhausen and then wound up in\nKoenigswusterhausen in that factory. And only about 800 people were left to liquidate\nthe ghetto and they came out smelling like a rose because they found all these treasures\nwhich were left behind in the ghetto. So, they came out fairly well-off and today they are\nall set. More power to them because better them than the Germans.",
        "Q: So there's a group that's left to liquidate, to tidy up everything?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And they can obviously accumulate because --",
        "A: Whatever they found they could hide for themselves and then Germany was finished and\nthen they had what they took. What they found they had for themselves.",
        "Q: Now you and your father and Dora goes with Irene and her mother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And David --",
        "A: David and her father and my father, we went together.",
        "Q: All of you were together?",
        "A: We were separated. We went to Sachsenhausen and they went to Ravensbriick, and then\nvery late, it must have been, we were liberated on the 27th of April in '45 so that must\nhave been in the beginning of '45 where a transport of women were sent where we were\ninto another barrack, separated from us.\nWe had no contact and -- except when we went to labor, but I was in the factory, so, but\nthey worked outside with some men also. So in the evening they were separated again.\nAnd Eric Yakobovitch\u2019s son, who lives now in Florida, he was at that time five years old\nor six years old and he came with his mother also. But Irene and my sister, they did not\ncome with that transport. They were left in Ravensbrtick and they were liberated by the\nRussians, as we were also, in April. And just only maybe 50 or 60 women and children\ncame where we were. The rest were left, yes, and we were liberated the 27th of April\n1945 at 4:00 in the morning the Russians came. Before, I must tell you, a very bad thing\nhappened. We had also air raid trenches, and every night the sirens, you know, they came\nduring the night we were working and at day time they were bombing. So every time\nthere was an air raid we had assigned places in these trenches. The first few alarms I went\nwith my father and we went to the place where we were supposed to be, but then I said,\n\"Papa, we are not going anymore.\" I was lying on the floor under the bunks. On this end\nof the barrack my father was on the other end of the barrack and every time a bomb or\ngrenade hit we called each other to make sure that we were okay because we had 66\nshrapnel in our barrack, and where we were supposed to be there were four young\nbrothers. They came originally from Pabianice. They were in our spot where we were and\na grenade hit them full blast and all four were wiped out. It would have happened to us if\nwe would have been there. That's fate. That\u2019s fate and that's kismet.",
        "Q: Where was David?",
        "A: David, he was taken -- oh, yeah, one day towards the end I was sent to the outside\ncommando and when we came back that late afternoon, 70 men had been taken away\nfrom the camp, amongst them my father-in-law, may he rest in peace and my brother-in-\nlaw, may he rest in peace. They were taken together with the others. They were sent on a\nmarch by foot. They were supposed to go up to the North Sea, put on a boat and as a final\nsolution being bombed out and drowned. And my father-in-law, he was shot, after the\nwar had ended already, the third of May. He couldn't walk anymore and they shot him.\nMy brother-in-law was able to escape at that time. So, that was the last few days. And I\nhad my violin. That's all I took. Of course I had a few hidden items there. And I went\nwith my father after the fourth or the fifth day after we were liberated because I said\n\"Let's not go out because they're still shooting.\" And I went with the Russian commando\nto organize bread and meat and wurst and whatever. I warned people, \"Don't overeat,\ntake it easy,\" and sure enough a few people overate and got sick and blew themselves up.\nAnd I went with father and we went across a field and there was a trunk and it was\ncovered with blood and I could open it and I opened it up and there were money, German\nmoney, the Reichsmark, it must have been at least a million or more and I said to my\nfather, \"Papa, if this is here full of blood it's not worth anything because I feel that the\nReichsmark will be nothing worth after the war and there will be new money.\" If I would\nhave known that until 1948 these Reichsmarks were good and valid, I would have been a\nmillionaire at that time. I could have bought whole blocks of houses. I didn't even touch\nit. I didn't even touch one piece of paper money and I walked off with my fiddle. I went\nover to the Elbe River and there was a Russian commander and I wanted to go across the\nriver because the Americans were on the other side. That's where I wanted to be. I didn't\nwant to be with the Russians.\nSo, I went to the commandant and asked him if I could go with the first transport. They\nwere French, French prisoners of war. They were allowed to cross the Elbe River the\nnext morning and I went to the commandant and asked I would like to go with them. So,\nI go back to my hometown. So he said, \"You are a German, so you have to wait until the\nGermans can go.\" So we smuggled, my father and I smuggled ourselves into the group of\nFrench people and we made it to the ferry boat and made it across the river. We went to\nthe Americans. I went to the commander there and I introduced ourselves -- what we are\nand where we are coming from -- and so he asked me a few questions, how is \"father\" in\nHebrew, how is \"mother\" in Hebrew and, \u201cWhat kind of brakhah\" do you say over this?\u201d\nAnd so I answered him so he knew that, yes, and since then the big love affair between\nthem and us and they wanted to give us everything. I had to help him. I was as, as a, an\ninterpreter for a few days until we could freely travel until everything was clear and\nbefore we would get the first papers to travel. So, once I was very eager to go home to\nmy hometown. So the commander gave me a jeep, papers I could go everywhere to get\ngas. They called it petrol at that time, and papers that I could travel and that I have\n* blessing (Hebrew.)\nlegitimately this jeep. And so, I started driving and everywhere I asked for my wife,\nwhether somebody has seen my wife. And nobody knew. Nobody said anything. Then I\nfinally came to Hannover, to my hometown, and I started working right away in the town\nhall and registered all the people who were coming from the various camps and I\nrepatriated people like Poles to Poland and Czechs to Czech and I took them all with\nvarious passes to the various border towns and I left them there and I took the buses back\nhome because they were all from the post office. In Germany all the buses are run by the\npost office. Everywhere I was I asked people, survivors whether they know or have heard\nof my wife. Then one girl, showed it to her, which she saw the picture of the dolly said\nIrene was bombed out. She's not alive anymore. And later on Irene told me that she was\ntold that I was bombed out. So, it took us ten months after the liberation that she found\nme back in my hometown.",
        "Q: Did you believe it when this woman told you that she was bombed out?",
        "A: I didn't know. And, well, naturally I was, I was, I was very unhappy. You know, I could\nnot get over it that easy until I saw her and then naturally you can imagine, OK, after ten\nmonths of not knowing whether she's alive or not and then we started our life back\ntogether and a year later we had our daughter, our first daughter, and then in '49 we\nfinally immigrated to the United States.",
        "Q: Was there a problem with your name?",
        "A: And we came here and the first dilemma was at the pier. I was the chief interpreter on\nboard the ship and every time the office was down below and every time I had to make\nthe announcement on the deck I had to go all the way up and down and up and down. It\nwas quite strenuous, but this way I earned my trip over to the United States. I didn't feel\nlike I get charity. We came to the pier and I had to wait until the last man left the boat\nand get them through the customs. Finally, we were the last. I had three big boxes,\nplywood boxes, big ones, and a total of 11 items of luggage so I had quite, I had all our\nbelongings and a custom agent came and asked me to open up everything. I had three\npackers packing my trunks at home in Germany before I left and here all by myself it was\nalready about eight at night at that time. Aviva, our daughter, got very sick on board the\nship. She had 104 fever and she was at eight. Irene and the child was taken off board the\nship and went to the hospital. I didn't know what happened to my child. I didn't know\nwhere they were and here I was crying. It was November seven. It was a very raw day,\nmisty, cold and I had to unpack and naturally they didn't find anything. Somebody who\nloves me showed them that I brought up a fortune and I didn't declare it, but everything I\nhad there was on my declaration, OK? So, to make it short, I had to put everything back\ninto the trunk, nail them down and here they took it away into storage and I went to look\nfor my wife and my daughter and it was not before 10 at night in the Hotel Breslin on\nBroadway that I heard that my daughter is in the hospital on Metropolitan Island at that\ntime, the Metropolitan Hospital, and I had 20 dollars in my pocket which went away the\nnext day for the taxi fare to the hospital.\nSo, that same night I went to the waterfront and I saw a sign \"help wanted\", and I went in\nthere and the foreman was also of German descent so we spoke German so I got the job.\nWhat was the job? 75 cents an hour cleaning the presses. It was a spare box folding box\nfactory on Tenth and -- I don't remember this, it was on 70th or 80th street somewhere --\nin any case what was my job? To clean with kerosene the printing presses and the cutting\npresses. Three months later I was an a sample maker. I made samples and I made one\npatent for them also, which was patented for which I got a dollar because it was made\nunder their name and their time so I got a dollar for it and then six months later I took\nover the night shift. I was a superintendent for the night shift. I worked there another\nthree months and every time I wanted a raise they said don't rush the seasons, don't rush\nthe seasons. So, I quit and went to Bulova. \u201cWhat I am?\u201d \u201cAn engineer.\u201d And I started up\nat Bulova, a watch company, and they found out I had pyrotechnic experience so I went, I\ngot clearance, secret clearance and I went on the missile program. It was a very\ninteresting job I started there and I was with Bulova close to 11 years, over 10 years.\nThen I was involved in the correspondence with another outfit, Daystrom, who had to\ntake a bid on a big program also in the missile field, and they had heard of me because I\nhad made myself a name already. So, they wanted me, and another firm, TRW, in\nCleveland, they wanted me so I went for an interview and first to Cleveland.\nI spent the whole day and at that time we were in Scranton, we lived in Scranton and then\nI went to Strattford in Connecticut to Avco. I spent a whole day being interviewed there\nand they made me an offer I could not refuse.\nSo since my contract at Daystrom had a two year option that I felt I should not take, I\nwent to work for Avco Lycoming in Strattford for 20 years, and I went up to, to become a\ndirector of a department with about 400 people.",
        "Q: Did you get a degree in engineering here?",
        "A: Yes. I finished up here, yes.",
        "Q: And where did you go to school?",
        "A: In Germany and here.",
        "Q: And here.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me, what happened to Aviva? She was in the hospital. We didn't --",
        "A: Aviva, thank heaven, she came through with it after eight days. We had papers to go to\nNorfolk. So we took Aviva when she was all right, we took her to Norfolk. We had to\ntake a ferry from somewhere down in Maryland, I guess, to go across to Norfolk, Cape\nMay, I guess, Cape May it was. And we come to Norfolk and they received us there with\nopen arms and brought us to an apartment, and Irene and I felt like crying. That much dirt\non the floor, a refrigerator with a motor on top yet, you know, like 1850. And we looked\nat her, thanked her for it, and all night long Irene and I with the razor blades we're\nscraping the floor. The next morning, I met the people I should work with and I came\nback home and I said, we really thanked them from the bottom of our hearts, but we don't\nstay here, this is not for us. We went to New York.",
        "Q: What about your name change?",
        "A: That was also when I asked for first papers, I was called to the Immigration Office, and\nthey started interrogating me for about three hours, maybe a hundred questions, and I\nsaid, \"What is this all about?\" I didn't sit down, they didn't ask me to sit down, I was\nstanding. They interrogated me. Every week I was called. Every week I heard the same\nquestions standing up. This went on for over a year, almost a year and a half. One day I\ncome, \"Mr. Fuchs, sit down.\" So I sat down. \"Now we can tell you, you have good\nfriends.\" I said, \"What happened?\" \"They said that you were a Gestapo man, and that you\nhave a lot of people on your conscious. But now we found out that it's not you. There was\na Gestapo man with your name, Kommisar Fuchs.\u201d He said, \"They thought it's you. We\ngive you the papers now, and we allow you to change your name through us so you don't\nhave to go through court.\" So we were driving home with Irene and she saw Rhonda\nFleming on a movie house. So she said, \"Fleming, that's a good name, let's be Fleming,\nso we don't have to change our initials, Bernard Fuchs, Bert Fleming, it's the same\ninitials.\" So that's the game by what we become Fleming.",
        "Q: Did you realize what they were questioning you about?",
        "A: Yeah, well, they asked me what I did, where I was, what my duties were, and always they\nshook their heads, and always the same questions. Then I naturally I figured that\nsomebody must have said something. But what? And they told me that they thought that\nI'm the Gestapo Fuchs.",
        "Q: Can you describe the situation that there was someone in Connecticut who was also\nmaking accusations against --",
        "A: I was supposed to have a speech about my experience during the Holocaust in my\nMasonic Lodge, and it was publicized that I will be speaking on this subject, and the\nMaster of the Lodge called me up and said, \"Bert, we have to cancel you.\" There was\nsome accusation made that about, probably, almost the same thing of what the other\naccusations were. When I heard this, I went to my Rabbi, Rabbi Stein, and I said, \"Rabbi,\nthis and this and this happened. This and this accusations were made, and I would like to\ntake this woman for a deen Torah.\u2019\u201d\u201d'\u201d That means for a rabbinical justice, a rabbinical\ncourt. So he investigated very thoroughly. He called Europe. He called the organizations\nhere of the former Lodge people. He finally came to the end result and told that woman,\n\"You better keep your mouth shut, because he can sue you for everything you have.\" And\nhe told me, \"Bert, don't worry about it. Everything is fine.\"",
        "Q: Did you know this woman?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And she was in...",
        "A: I knew her by name only. I didn't have any dealings with her. But Irene knew them very\nwell. And, but she passed away a year after what, after that happened. So that's the other\nhappening I had. But I didn't worry about it, because you know I have a clean conscience\nand now I'm lecturing high school -- Merkaz students I lecture, and also some various\nspeech, and I'm very active in B'nai Brith. I'm four years now the vice president, and I'm\na Mason, and I'm very active in the Synagogue as well their federation. So we live a very\ncomfortable life, and happy, as much as we can be happy.",
        "Q: What do the students ask you, when you talk to the young students? Do they have\nquestions or --",
        "A: They ask a lot of questions, yes. But I must say that they were almost mesmerized when I\nspoke to them. They followed every word, and afterwards they sent, every student sent\nme a nice little letter thanking me of and the impression they had and what they have\nlearned, because I left them always a message.",
        "Q: And what was that message?",
        "A: The message is: remember what we tell you, because we are dying out. So you have to\ntell your children; they have to tell their children of what happened, and make sure that it\nwill never happen again. Have your ears and eyes wide open. Rot the weed out as soon as\nyou see it. Any other things you would like to know? Did we cover it, all the territory?\n'\u00b0 \u201cDeen\u201d means verdict or court decision (Hebrew); \u201cDeen Torah\u201d is a verdict based on\nthe laws of a rabinnical court.",
        "Q: I think we covered a lot of territory. Is there anything you would like to add?",
        "A: I had a very successful career before I retired. I had a very interesting job. I was almost in\nthe limelight, and I've harvested the fruits of what I'd seeded because I was very lucky in\nall my endeavors. I was a troubleshooter. I found the trouble, I corrected them, I proved\nit, and that's not an easy task, and I'm very happy and lucky that I achieved it. I went up\nthe ladder, not by prodigy, not by anything else but my own ability. That's about it.",
        "Q: Thank you very much, Bert.",
        "A: Thank you. I hope the archive will learn something, whoever will listen or read of what\nhad happened, and really make sure that nothing happens again of that type. All right?",
        "Q: All right. Thank you.",
        "A: Thank you.\nEnd of Tape #2\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Q: Good morning.",
        "Q: Can you tell us your name and the name that you were born with, because I know it is\ndifferent than your name now, and when you were born and where?",
        "Q: Let's go back a little bit. Tell me about your family -- about your mother and your father\nand sister.",
        "Q: I'd like to go back. It must have been very difficult when your mother passed away at\nsuch a young age for you?",
        "Q: And when your father remarried, I gather you didn't stay at home after that happened?",
        "Q: And you lived alone?",
        "Q: But you remained close with your father and sister?",
        "Q: And when the Aktion started, as I mentioned, we were sent to Poland, and when we came\nto the Polish border, on one side we had the SS with the bayonets pointed at us, and on\nthe other side we had the Polish with bayonets pointed at us, and we were 1n no-man's\nland for 48 hours before some intervention the Poles opened the border and let us into a\nvery small village. The name is Zbaszyn. There -- I was always an organizer -- so when\nwe went there, there was no housing because it was a small village and here we were\nabout 2,000 people. So we organized. I took a few young people and we put\nhandkerchiefs around our arms, our sleeves, and then we went and cleaned out pig sties\nwhere the cattle was and also some housing which were empty. So, there we took care of\nthe old people and the sick people and the children; some children were born right there.\nAnd we were in Zbaszyn until six weeks before the war broke out. In the meantime, a lot\nof people who had family in Poland were released and they went to their people, and so\nmy father also went back to Lodz because he had two brothers living there with their\nfamilies and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in Zbaszyn because it was just\nabout six weeks before the war started. Then I went to Krakow with -- myself with some\npeople that I had befriended and then later to Czestochowa. In Czestochowa, I stayed\nuntil I think it was September 1940. The ghetto in Lodz had already been closed the first\nof May. So, one evening a car came with a man named David Gertler, and he came in\nwhere I lived in Czestochowa, because I had corresponded with my sister in Lodz, so she\nknows where I was. And she had sent this man with an SS man in a private car to pick me\nup in Czestochowa and took me into the ghetto to be reunited with my sister and father.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. You're how old at this time?",
        "Q: What was your sister -- your sister's name 1s?",
        "Q: What was she doing?",
        "Q: Did you know this when you were writing to her?",
        "Q: Was it surprising to you that she sent an SS man to get you?",
        "Q: Did it worry you when these people came to the door?",
        "Q: When you saw your family at first, did your sister explain to you about Rumkowski and\ntell you things about him so that when you met him you had some idea?",
        "Q: Let me ask you something in terms of reflecting back a little bit. When you were in\nHannover and the Nazis took over, you were in some sense fighting the Nazis, right?",
        "Q: You remember the Maccabees?",
        "Q: Can you explain what that organization was?",
        "Q: So, when you got to L\u00e9dz, what did you think the Germans were doing in the course of\nthe war to these Jews, since you had already experienced the Nuremberg laws and kicked\nout of the university, and at least some violence against the Jews?",
        "Q: How did you do that?",
        "Q: So, Rumkowski sees you and tells you to head -- did you head this department by\nyourself at that point?",
        "Q: So, how long did it take you to figure out this organization after he had spoken to you?",
        "Q: So how many people were on your staff at that point?",
        "Q: Now, when you registered, did you have cards printed out so you could register people?",
        "Q: Now you're moving too fast. When you're registering people, there are clearly some\nelderly people and there are kids who probably can't work.",
        "Q: And did they go with family members to certain factories or would they stay in an\napartment?",
        "Q: So, everybody is registered whether they are really working or not.",
        "Q: And when you came into the ghetto and you're registering there are almost 200,000\npeople, right?",
        "Q: What is happening with housing at this point? When you came in was everybody living\nwhere they're supposed to be living or are they moving around?",
        "Q: And were there a number of pumps in different parts of the ghetto?",
        "Q: Were you living with your father and your sister?",
        "Q: I gather that your father's second wife and child had left?",
        "Q: And had your father wanted to go and they didn't allow him to, or you don't know?",
        "Q: Once this big registration happened, with all these people, and all of the people are going\nto their particular factories or work places, what is then your job? What are your\nresponsibilities once that happened?",
        "Q: What would be a day?",
        "Q: Were you meeting with Rumkowski regularly?",
        "Q: What was your relationship like? What kinds of things would you discuss? Would it only\nbe business or were you also discussing the situation?",
        "Q: Was this a hard job for you?",
        "Q: When did he come in?",
        "Q: And who was the third?",
        "Q: Now, you said that when -- the department of labor was somehow involved in the\ndeportations?",
        "Q: There was no underground radio?",
        "Q: What did you learn when you were listening to the radio?",
        "Q: But the 1942 transports went to Chelmno.",
        "Q: And you think Rumkowski didn't know?",
        "Q: What was daily life like? What time did you get up in the morning and where did you\neat? Did you eat at home?",
        "Q: Tell us about your meeting.",

        "Q: Did you life change?",
        "Q: Let me go back and try to ask you some details.",
        "Q: I know that it's difficult. Did people come to you and ask you for favors? I mean you\nwere in a position to make decisions?",
        "Q: So you must have been put in situations where people asked you to do things.",
        "Q: For them and other people?",
        "Q: Can you talk about some of those kinds of difficulties?",
        "Q: There were some mass demonstrations and strikes early on.",
        "Q: Did you have sympathy with these strikers or did you find them disruptive?",
        "Q: Do you remember that day when he gave that talk about \u201cgive me your children\u2019\u2019?",
        "Q: Did you hear him speak?",
        "Q: Did you decide not to go or were you just doing something else?",

        "Q: Now, when you went to concerts, did they have cafes and concerts? Were there a lot of\ndifferent sorts of cultural activities?",
        "Q: Did one have to pay, use the money from the ghetto to go, or was this free?",
        "Q: And what was the money used for?",
        "Q: Did this money have Rumkowskt's picture on it or some of the money?",
        "Q: What did you think of that?",
        "Q: Was anybody else's picture on the money?",
        "Q: Were there coins as well as paper money\u2019?",
        "Q: What kind of a hierarchy between people who came in richer and people who came in\npoorer and people who came in from outside, the Czech transports, the German\ntransports? Do you remember gypsy transport coming in?",
        "Q: Do you recall whether there was a difference in treatment with the people who were\nalready in Lodz from the people who were coming in from transports who might not, then\nhad to get apartments or parts of apartments? Do you think there was a distinction\nbetween those people?",
        "Q: Was there sufficient -- I don't mean a lot of food -- but could every one get something to\neat or was there a lot of starvation among certain groups, do you think?",

        "Q: When was -- or did it become clear to you late in 1944 that these transports were not\nresettlement and were not work camps? Did you know?",
        "Q: Did you have dealings with Biebow\u2019\u2019 or with the Gestapo?",
        "Q: Any of the German personnel that were in Lodz, did you have dealings with?",

        "Q: What does this mean? I mean, you had been in 1936 to \u201838 blowing up trains, right?",
        "Q: After you left Lodz you were also doing some sabotage. In Lodz did you think about that\nor did it seem like the situation where one couldn't do anything?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s take a break.",
        "Q: Bert, can we go back to your earlier years for a few minutes? Tell me a little bit about\nyour boxing career?",
        "Q: Do you think having boxed was in any way a help to you?",
        "Q: Now at the same time you were involved in music. You were a violinist?",

        "Q: Irene was also --",
        "Q: You talked about yourself before that you never allowed yourself to take a bribe. This\nwas not something you would do?",

        "Q: I bet he was surprised at this.",
        "Q: When you described the evacuations and deportations, and that you wouldn't go and that\nyou sent your partner, was he willing to go? He didn't say, \"I'm not going to do this\"?",
        "Q: Did he survive?",
        "Q: Did you meet him after the war?",
        "Q: One wonders whether there are conversations about these circumstances or choices?",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of the ghetto that you think would be important to try to talk\nabout that we haven't talked about?",
        "Q: Did you ever think of resigning that position? Did it sometimes get to be too much?",
        "Q: Do you think he needed you?",
        "Q: Do you think he would have punished you if you would have said, \"I'm sorry, I really\ncan't\"?",

        "Q: Or not?",
        "Q: Was she married in the ghetto or was she single?",
        "Q: Did she ever say what it was like to work with Rumkowski? Was he easy to work with or\ndifficult to work with?",
        "Q: Was he like this before?",
        "Q: It seems to me that the picture of any human being 1s very complicated, so someone\ndamning a person or completely praising someone may not be quite appropriate. Do you\nthink there was anything negative -- I mean you've said very powerful things about him\nin terms of what you think he was able to do that wouldn't have happened without him.\nDo you think anything negatively about him?",
        "Q: So, you controlled yourself in spite of your rage?",
        "Q: But he also had power, so that --",
        "Q: So, that if he, if you went against him, he could get you deported?",
        "Q: That's a bit frightening to be around.",
        "Q: Do you think that these workers who had demonstrated these early mass demonstrations,\nmany of them were sent in the early deportations?",
        "Q: Possibly because they had gone on strike?",
        "Q: Had -- and probably Rumkowski wanted them out because they were trouble in terms of\nwhat he was trying to do. Do you think they might have been the core of resistance or is\nthat just a stupid idea?",
        "Q: Do you think that was a bad idea?",
        "Q: Can you talk about the last few months when you think about 30,000 or 40,000 people\nleft in the ghetto before the last deportations or are there more than that?",
        "Q: So there's a group that's left to liquidate, to tidy up everything?",

        "A: Good morning, Joan.",
        "A: I was born September 17, 1916, in Hannover, Germany. My name at that time was\nBernard Fuchs, and I was born and raised in Hannover; and until 1936, I went through\nthe schools and read the Nuremberg law, and it became too hard for us. I had to leave the\nuniversity because no Jews could study further.",
        "A: My father and mother both came from L\u00e9dz. They had left Poland around when the war\nbroke out, 1914 -- no before that -- 1913, they went to Elsass-Lothringen, which is part of\nFrance now and was at that time also. And there they lived until 1915 when they went to\nlive in Germany. Father was a custom tailor, and he built up his own studio and built up a\nwonderful clientele. He was really the number-one custom tailor in Hannover. And my\nmother, may she rest in peace, died very young. She died already 1928, when I was 12\nyears old and is buried in Hannover. My father remarried in 1932 and had another son in\n1933 and -- when I had to leave the university, I went on hash'alah\u2019 to be processed to go\nat that time Palestine. But my father got sick. He had a very serious operation, and he\nasked me to stay back and take care of his wife and son. So, this way, that is why I did\nnot go to Palestine at that time. Then in 1938, there was a big Aktion\u2019 by the Germans\nwhere they took all foreigners, that means stateless or not, of German nationality -- Jews\n-- and collected them all in a concert hall in Hannover, and -- where we stayed for a day\nand a night. And then they took us in cattle trains to the Polish border.",
        "A: Yes.\n' It is unclear what the interviewee said, however, it sounds as if he said \"hash'alah.\" The\nfigurative meaning of \"hash'alah\" is \"on loan\" (Hebrew).\n* Any nonmilitary campaign with political, racial, or eugenic ends (German).",
        "A: No, I left home. And -- I could not stay at that time. I just couldn't live with her. It\nbecame impossible. So, I had left when I was 14.",
        "A: I lived alone, yes. I lived with friends, with their parents. I rented a room there. And I\nearned money, and at that time I paid the rent there and lived until the Aktion started.",
        "A: Well, I had to, yes. My sister got engaged to be married with a -- not a Jewish man -- but\nwe liked him. He was a very nice man. He was a dress manufacturer, special designed\ndresses. And so how far back do you want me to go now?",
        "A: You can certainly talk about this, sure.\nI was not too long in the ghetto, just a few days, when I got a call from Rumkowski,\u2019 an\nElder of the Jews, for a long interview. And there he said, \u201cI want you to take over the\nlabor department because we have to register every Jew, every child in the ghetto\nbecause we have to give them work.\u201d For work we will get bread and we can live. So we\nregistered --",
        "A: At that time I was 24 years old.",
        "A: Dora.",
        "A: She was the executive secretary of the Rumkowsk1.",
        "A: No. I knew it only when I came to the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, only then I realized why she could have done it because of her position. She was\nable to do that.",
        "A: At first, yes, at first. But immediately when he told me who he is and what he came for,\nnaturally I was relieved, and naturally I went with them to be reunited with my family.",
        "A: No, she just told me of what is going on and what has to be done because Rumkowski\nwas in a position to deal with the Ghettoverwaltung,\u2019 to tell them you give us material.\nWe will manufacture it and in turn you give us food and whatever we need.\n> Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski (1877-1944); Chairman of the Judenrat in the Lodz\nghetto.\n* \"Ghetto Administration\" which also oversaw the activities of the Judenrat (German).",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: It was an underground organization of students who, like me, had to leave the\nuniversities, and we decided to make sabotage. We became, like in other words, terrorists\nand we got hold of explosives and we broke up -- we bombed their trains, any transport\nof the SS people and stuff like this. So, we really gave them a hard time.\nAnd in 1936, I was arrested for the first time by the Gestapo for three weeks, interrogated\nevery day, the same questions asked, but they could not have any proof or couldn't tell\nanything of what I had done, so they had to let me go. That was in 1936. Then in '38, I\nmentioned to you already, I was sent to Zbaszyn in Poland.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes. When I came to the ghetto, and I was told and I saw with my own eyes,\nof how the people have to live in the ghetto, and naturally I was right up in arms. I could\nnot digest it that easily. And when the Elders of the Jews called on me to head the\ndepartment, and naturally I was pleased that I got to do something productive for the\nghetto, even though people today have said I worked with the Germans and helped them,\nwhich is naturally it's nonsense because if we would not have done what we did in the\nghetto, in 1942, that ghetto would have been liquidated completely and no one would\nhave survived. And thanks to Rumkowski, and thanks to his negotiation power he was\nable to convince the Germans, and actually the Lodz ghetto became a model for all the\nghettos in the other areas. So, three days and three nights we registered all the people.",
        "A: Well, I got a staff and I got an office and people came day and night. There were\nhundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, and we were able to do it in three days\nand three nights and everybody who registered also got where to go, to what factory. So\nwe delegated people directly into the various factories.",
        "A: At that point, yes, I organized it myself.",
        "A: Well, I was given people to interview and I interviewed the people and whomever felt\nthey could do the job I would tell them, yes, they were hired.",
        "A: At that time I couldn't tell you exactly. It was over 20. Between 20 and 30 people.",
        "A: Yes, we had books and later on we made big index cards. But people themselves, they\ngot a piece of paper with where to go, where to report to, to what factory, and with this\nthey were given 1.d. cards and cards to be able to get food, like food stamps, coupons for\nfood. And this entitled them to a soup. There were various soups around the ghetto where\nthe people who worked the factories were able to get a soup. Some a little bit heavier,\nsome a little bit lighter soups, as you can imagine. And as the time passed, I had, for\ninstance, I took a very sick-looking person out of a factory and delegated him to a kitchen\nwhile I took a healthy- looking guy from the kitchen and put him into the factory. So,\nwith one signature of mine I made a friend and an enemy, which you can understand. The\nones who worked in the kitchen, they were sitting. They got a little bit more to eat than\nthe others. So, this went on, then, until 1944 --",
        "A: They still got cards. They still were registered.",
        "A: They would register but they would not actually work because they couldn't work. They\nwere unable to work, but if we would have left them without registration, without 1.d.\ncards, they would die for hunger because they wouldn't get any rations.",
        "A: Yes, everybody had to be registered.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, they had since the ghetto was closed the first of May. Naturally, all these people\ncoming from the other side of the town into the ghetto had to be housed. So, naturally,\nthere wasn't enough housing available for every family. So you found in most cases that\nin one room lived four families. In every corner a different family, OK, and the\nconditions naturally were unbearable to live, really, because there was no running water.\nThere were no toilets in the room. People didn't have bathrooms. They would have to go\nto outhouses. And they would have to go and pump the water from a pump and bring it\nup into the room. So, the conditions naturally as you can imagine was anything but\nhuman.",
        "A: No, mostly in every house they had some water supply, but it was like I said: no\nbathroom and not every house had running water.",
        "A: Yes, in the beginning.",
        "A: No, she had left in 1939 to England. She was a nurse by profession and she got a job in\nEngland as a nurse, so she took off with her son and went to England.",
        "A: She didn't get any papers for him. She got papers just for herself and her son, and father\nwas very active in the ghetto also being a custom tailor. He was always working and had\nalso quite a few tailors working together and they made for these people, even for the\npeople in the ghetto. He had to make their suits for them, right.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: They were always going movements on. People had died from hunger. They had to be\nreplaced.\nOK, so, there was always a lot of switching of personnel because you can imagine so\nmany people and so many various factories, so there was always something going on\nwhere the department of labor had to act accordingly, right. So, there was always\nsomething going on that kept us busy.",
        "A: Not regularly but often. He came to my office or I was called upon for meetings. And --\noh, yes, frequently I saw Rumkowski, yes.",
        "A: Well, if we were socially somewhere together, then yes, I would talk with him a little bit\nabout various subjects and incidents which occurred which I wanted to know more\ndetails about. And also, about my background, what he wanted to know. But otherwise,\nhe was very busy and there wasn't much time for socializing, except when we had\nconcerts. We had our own orchestra, and so it was really a city by itself in itself.",
        "A: It was not an easy job, and especially when the Aktion took place when they asked for\n800 people or 1,000 people or 2,000 people to be sent out allegedly to other working\ncamps. I had no dealings with this because I left this to my partner, to Czenszenski.",
        "A: He came in about a year after I had the office organized, and then later on when we got a\ntransport from Czechoslovakia there was also a gentleman who was told by the Eldest of\nthe Jews, by Rumkowski, to work with me in the department of labor, especially for the\nCzech people. So, we had actually three at that time heading the department.",
        "A: Anders was his name. He came from Prague. Terrific elements in that transport.\nProfessionals, very intelligent people but unfortunately they died like flies.\nThey could not adjust themselves to the conditions of the ghetto. When they came into\nthe station in Marysin, where we had our railroad station, they asked, \"Where we can get\na taxi? Is there a hotel?\" As funny as it seems, but at that time, the tears came into my\neyes when I saw these people and unfortunately we lost so many of them at that time very\nfast.",
        "A: Well, naturally they were asked by Rumkowski to select certain people at random to be\nsent. The first transport for instance were the three Fs\u201d in German: Fleisher,\u00b0\nFuhrmann\u2019...what was the third F? I don't even remember the third. Well, in any case\nthese three groups, from three groups the transports, the first transports went to a labor\ncamp and a lot of them survived, thank heaven, because they really went to working\ncamps because Auschwitz came later on and naturally we didn't know that. We had no\ndealings with the outside world and there was no communication with the outside\nworld...and the Lodz ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, underground radio, I myself with a friend of mine, Dr. Smulovitcz, we had a radio.\nWe listened to the radio at nighttime and we lost a very important person because of that\n-- Doctor...Irene, she would remember the name. He was shot because he listened to the\nradio. He was caught listening to the radio. That was a very dangerous thing to do but we\ndid it.",
        "A: We learned about the war what was going on but naturally of what happened with us we\ndid not being informed through the radio, we didn't know. Only much, much later we\nfound some little paper in one of the cattle carts that came back, that they went to\nAuschwitz -- \u201cOswiecim\u201d it's called in Polish, and -- but it was a rumor but nobody really\n> The interviewee is probably referring to occupations, not surnames.\n\u00b0 butcher (German).\n\u2019 carriage driver (German).\nhad facts because nobody returned from there. But they, a lot of people survived even\nAuschwitz and Birkenau.",
        "A: Which we did not know, I did not.\nAs a matter of fact, some of the first transports could write into the ghetto. We received\nmail into the ghetto from these various camps. So, how we were supposed to know that\nthey are going to their death? Nobody actually knew, nobody knew.",
        "A: I don't think he did because he heard the same rumors that we heard.",
        "A: Well, I finally got myself an apartment and I found Irene in 1942. I engaged with her in\n1942.",
        "A: We had a date to meet at a friend's house.",
        "A: That evening. And, well, I saw Irene when she walked on the street, and I fell in love\nwith her, just by seeing her the way she walked. And then when I saw her face, so it went\nwith it. So, I said to one of my O.D.* men, who was always my lifeguard if you want to\ncall it, I said to him, \"I want to meet this girl. I want to meet this girl. You have to make a\ndate for me.\" And it happened to be that I was at that time I had a slight cold or\nsomething. I was home and -- no that was afterwards. So, finally we made a date and he\nmade a date with her not telling her that she had a date with me. So, he made the date\nwith her and it was late at night and she was an hour late and he still was there but he was\njust about going away when she came. And she came and the whole night she was sitting\nand talking and I was serenading her, playing on my violin and finally she fell in love\nwith me, too. So, then one evening in November, the 11th of November to be exact, we\nhad -- in a friend's house, she was ready and I went to her parents and I asked for her\n* Ordnungs Dienst [Organization for public order\" (German).\nhand. I want to marry their daughter and they allowed this. They said, \u201cOK, you can\nmarry our daughter.\u201d\nThen I went to the party where we met for the evening and I said, \u201cCongratulations we\nare engaged to be married.\u201d And that was then the way I met Irene and then we married\nin June of 1943, by the Elders of the Jews, together with 18 or 19 other couples.",
        "A: Since then? Well, to me in my eyes, yes, because she's a wonderful woman, very bright,\nvery intelligent, and down to earth with a lot of common sense and a tremendous\nintuition. She knows things which happen later on, she knows beforehand. And so then I\ngot an apartment with a room and a kitchen and I lived there with Irene then. And...so, I\ngot up in the morning like seven o'clock, was at my office at eight, and Irene was also\nworking in one of the factories and we lived there with the various happenings during\nthis time in the ghetto which is already known today by everybody who is interested in it\nbecause it's a matter of documentation already of what had happened in between '42 and\n'44. We have lost a lot of people by transporting them out of the ghetto, by attrition, and\nas the time passed by more and more and more starved. Of course sickness, hunger and in\n1944 the last transport to Auschwitz was the next to the last transport, there was also was\nthe Elders of the Jews, Rumkowski, and all his staff and his wife and his brother, and\nthey went to Auschwitz and unfortunately, as we learned later on, he was immediately\nkilled when he got to Auschwitz. And then we were the last transport out of the ghetto in\n'44 and we did not go to Auschwitz. We went to Sachsenhausen.",
        "A: OK.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I will not remember the details, but one thing was certain, that I did not take any bribes.\nNobody could buy me, and I did it to the best of my ability and to my conscience. So, if\nsomebody asked me a favor and I could do it I gladly did it, and if I couldn't, I couldn't. I\nhad to say no. But that I did really select someone to do a favor, no, I did not.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, these people did not know the background of why the happenings what happened\nso they tried, they thought by striking or by demonstrating they could better their lives by\ngetting maybe more bread or more to eat, but it didn't do any good because Rumkowsk1\ndid the only thing he could do was what he did. All right, he was a little bit rough, but if\nyou put yourself into his position, what could he have done? Like for instance, the\ntransport when they asked for children, his heart was breaking, but what could he have\ndone, because if he wouldn't have done it, it would have been worse. Because, for\ninstance, a transport was supposed to go out of the ghetto and they could not fulfill the\nquota, they came in and blocked off, you know, two or three or four houses and took\neverybody that was found in there and sent them away. So, what was the lesser evil?\nNothing could have been done.",
        "A: No, I don't remember, and I wasn't there. I wasn't there and I did not take part in that.",
        "A: No, no, I learned it when I saw the film. I knew that a transport had to go out, but I did\nnot hear the speech. I wasn't present when he spoke.",
        "A: I tried to stay away from all the various Aktions.",
        "A: I didn't want to take part in it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, well, they stayed in the office to keep order because when there is a line of people\noutside everybody wants to be the first. Everybody tries to be -- so they kept order.",
        "A: The main reason was to keep order and then also to protect me.",
        "A: Listen, in a position like I had, well, naturally people, as I mentioned to you before, with\none signature I made a friend and an enemy at the same time. So, naturally, not that I was\nscared or something like this but everybody had to be careful because you never know\nwhat people do when they're desperate. So they kept order. Now, then, as I mentioned we\nwere the last transport. Only 800 people were left in the ghetto officially to liquidate the\nghetto. We were sent to Sachsenhausen. In Sachsenhausen, we were there for two weeks\nand then we were bought as slaves by a firm and we went to Koenigswusterhausen,\nwhere there were new barracks put for us and naturally also straw mattresses. We worked\nand made to cut certain wood and plywoods which we sent away to be assembled -- we\ndidn\u2019t do the assembly -- and we understand they were boxes sent to the eastern front\nagainst Russia. They would put certain ice-melting stuff in there, like some flame\nthrowers or something like this, and thank heaven the war did not last two weeks longer\nbecause I probably would have been shot for sabotage because what I cut on the circular\nsaw was a quarter of inch too long, a quarter of an inch too short.\nWe dealt with centimeters. It was a half a centimeter less or half a centimeter larger, so,\nbut it wouldn't fit together. So, thank heaven it ended when it ended because otherwise I\nprobably would have been killed for sabotage.\nWhat else can I say, what else can I tell you? In the mean time I had other experiences,\nlike my back was broken -- not broken but fractured, because one day I had to go into the\nforest to build some tank traps and next to me was a man, an elderly man, who could not\nwork. So I did something for him so one of the SS men who watched us came over and\ntold him to work, and he was just leaning over his shovel and said, \u201cI can't, I can't.\u201d So,\nhe hit him, and when he hit him I said I will work for him. I will do his part. So, he gave\nme over the back with his rifle and I had a slight fracture of L-2, as they call it in that\nlanguage. And I was hiding for a while because I could not stand, but thank heaven it\nhealed. And I needed an operation which was performed in 1966 and thank heaven\neverything is all right. So any further details you would like to know?",
        "A: Let\u2019s go back.",
        "A: We had a newspaper in the ghetto, yes.",
        "A: No. It\u2019s a blank.",
        "A: Well, daily routines, what has to be done, some what happened, and really I don't recall\nright now. It\u2019s a blank.",
        "A: Oh, definitely within the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, by the organization not because everything that came from the Ghettoverwaltung\nwould be on a poster.",
        "A: Not that I know of.",
        "A: Well, they had the theater and the orchestra. Yes, they gave concerts.",
        "A: No, it was free.",
        "A: Inside, people bought themselves cigarettes, hand made cigarettes, various things. It\ndidn't have any value outside the ghetto, it was only within the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, oh, yes.",
        "A: At that time it was absolutely natural for me. It was an organization. It was a city.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: There were coins, too, yes, but mostly paper money. What else would you like to know?",
        "A: I don't recall. We got a lot of transports coming from little villages and towns around the\nvicinity of Lodz, but I don't remember.",
        "A: Well, I would say that some of them who were affected by the newcomers, as you want\nto call them, because they had to share a room with them or whatever, so naturally they\nmight take objection to it.\nBut in general, everybody tried to help, actually, the other.",
        "A: There was starvation, absolutely.",
        "A: It was difficult. It was difficult because the bread ration which varied from time to time\nwas too much to die but not enough to live. But eventually and slowly people starved,\nstarved, and no resistance to sicknesses and a lot of people got tuberculosis and just died\naway. So, it was very much decimated by people going on transport, being sent out of the\nghetto and by attrition, and died by starvation. So, from the 200,000 people coming to the\nghetto, there were in 1944 maybe, maybe by estimation, I estimate maybe 30,000 or\n40,000 people left. They either died away or were sent on transports.",
        "A: Well, naturally, it is as you have today, too. There are certain jobs women can not just do\nand men have to do it, but I don't think there was any distinction made and women had to\ndo the same work as the men, at least they were delegated to do the job. Whether they\ncould do it with the help or without the help it's a different story, but we could not make\nany distinction between the various genders.",
        "A: There were Kindergartens. Children had to go and stay over the day and were taken care\nof, which was one of the fort\u00e9s of Rumkowski because children was his life.\nBefore the war, he was heading an orphanage and they were taken care of but naturally\nthe same thing. They didn't have enough food and a lot of children died.",
        "A: No, they got their own.",
        "A: Yes. Every head had to get a certain ration. That's why they had to be registered. Whether\na child or the elderly, it doesn\u2019t matter. They had to be registered to get the 1.d. and to get\nthe ration card.",
        "A: No, no, it was very dim. People tried to live as good as they could. In other words, they\ntried to make the best of it but naturally you can not help it. They had to be depressed\nbecause nobody knew what the next day would bring. And so, the whole situation made it\nso that you had to be depressed.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. Because I saw with my eyes of what had happened to these\nvarious people. I saw them. They hardly could walk and they had to go to the factory. So\nwhen you see the people walking hardly being able to put one foot in front of the other\nand knowing that they have to go to do some job otherwise they wouldn't eat, you\ncouldn't help it. You had to be depressed. You couldn't put a wall around you because\nyou lived with it.",
        "A: I personally didn't know anybody who committed but we had plenty of suicides, yes.\nThey could not just take it anymore.",
        "A: Of suicide? Not at that time. Well, I was prepared for it.",
        "A: I had made two rings, one for myself and one for Irene. We were able to get Zyankali\u2019\nand put it in the ring for when the time would come where we suffered to such a degree\nthat we couldn't stand it anymore we could take it. But then my mother-in-law, may she\nrest in peace, without us knowing it, she removed it. We didn't know it because we never\nused it. We never took it off, but the ring survived in my violin and my daughter has it\nnow.",
        "A: No, just the situation where we couldn't stand it any more.\n\u201d cyanide (German).",
        "A: We still didn't know. We had rumors but we still didn't know... We didn't know that the\ntransport before us went to Auschwitz, that we are not going to Auschwitz, that we are\ngoing somewhere else. We didn't know.",
        "A: Not directly, not directly. He came to my office maybe once or twice but I had no\npersonal dealings with him, no.",
        "A: I had some dealings, yes.",
        "A: The one I dealt with was personally to me very nice, and I had not seen that he committed\nanything to the contrary. And he himself was not on the same level as the others. By \u201con\nthe level\u201d I mean psychological because he felt with us, but he couldn't do anything, but\nat least he gave me some lift up.",
        "A: No, no. Oh, no. He didn't divulge anything of that sort.",
        "A: Oh, plenty of brutalities in the ghetto. I saw where they played football with a baby and\ntook the children and threw them right on the truck.\nSure, we saw brutalities. I saw brutalities where the Kripo, the Kriminalpolizei,'\u2019 which\nwere in the ghetto, which had the sole purpose of selecting jewelry and all valuable from\nthe people. They were sitting at the window and shooting at random, like a sniper. By the\nway, I had him arrested after the war, but he was able to escape so they asked me for help\nto find him. So, I told them the next time I find someone from the war criminals, he won't\nbe able to escape.\n'\u00ae Hans Biebow (1902-1947), was the head of the Lodz ghetto administration.\n' criminal police (German).",
        "A: At random.",
        "A: Confusing in what way?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Exactly, you couldn't do anything. You were helpless. What could you have done? Well,\nnaturally you felt awful, but what could you have done? You were helpless. You couldn't\ndo anything. This led also to depression. There was no way. You felt like doing\nsomething, especially with my hot blood, but what could I have done? We had no\nweapons. People have asked me, \u201cWhy didn't you make a riot like they did in Warsaw?\u201d\nBecause with whom and with what? The Warsaw ghetto had dealings with the outside.\nWe didn't. They could trade something for weapons. We didn't have anybody to trade\nwith, and we didn't have with what to trade, so how can we compare the Warsaw uprising\nwith Lodz ghetto? Oranges and apples.\nSo naturally whenever we saw any brutality, it hurt. You wanted to cry out and you\nwanted to kill the guy, but could you have done? You were helpless.",
        "A: OK.\nEnd of Tape #1\n* crazy (Yiddish).\nTape #2",
        "A: Well, it wasn't much of a career, but I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, and I\nstarted to get into the ring with my name on the poster. I must have been 14 years old and\nI was a junior welter featherweight. I started boxing when I was about 12 years old,\nstarted training. The Jewish sport club Bar-Kochba had no boxing in Hannover. We had\nno boxing, so I joined the Heros-Eintracht boxing club in Hannover. And when I was\nabout 14 I was ready to go into the ring. My name was on the poster and I started boxing\nas a junior featherweight and I did fairly well, and I was just about ready to go into the\nchampionship fights when I was paired against one who was not very friendly towards\nme because we went to the same school and he was one of the first Nazis.\nWhen it came to a championship fight -- no, I'm sorry. I have to go back now. I got him\ninto the ring and I fought him and I won. I won that fight. Then about a year later, at that\ntime the Nazis started already but I was still allowed to box in that club. I fought him the\nsecond time and he lost again. Then I saw him for the first time in a SS uniform and when\nit came to that last fight I just could not hold back but, and I hit him with everything I had\nand I knocked him out, and he was the one who arrested me in 1938 to bring me in the\nconcert hall where we were sent away into no-man's land. So, that was my boxing career.\nThen, naturally, I could not go any further because at that time the Nazis were in full\nswing and full force and a Jew could not any more be in any public place for that reason.\nSo, this was the boxing career to answer your question.",
        "A: Well, I lived in sports. I played soccer for 15 years from when I was a youngster until --\nsometimes as a goalkeeper. I played two games, at 10 o'clock in the youth and at one\no'clock in the second league. So, I was pretty good at it, too. I was a pretty good\ngoalkeeper. And I was an oarsman in high school, and field and track I wasn't too fast in\nrunning, but I was in very good physical condition and I think this has helped me in\ngoing through the other bad environments I was forced into.",
        "A: Yes. I did not play officially anywhere. I just played for myself and as Irene told you, I\nserenaded her our first night meeting. And I played with my daughter. The violin has a\nvery, very sentimental value because it survived the holocaust, and we had as when I\nwalked away from the ghetto that was the only thing I took with me and I kept it until I\ncame to Sachsenhausen where they took it away from me.\nAnd they took a accordion away from another colleague, but when we came to\nKoenigswusterhausen, to the factory where we were slaves, they gave me the violin and\nthey gave him the accordion under the condition that he play for them. So, every so often\nin the evening we had to play for them and entertain them while they were drinking and\nlaughing and so on. And it helped me also a little bit in the assignment, because as I said,\nI was on the circular saw, but at one time we had to go to an outside commando to a tank\ntrap, and I had that incident with that elderly man of ours and where I could not see him\nbeaten because he could not do his job so I had to take it for him. I mentioned that to you\nbefore, and so this is the violin, and I played until not too many years ago, but my fingers\nare a little bit arthritic now. They are getting stiff so 1t wasn't for me anymore, so I gave it\nas a Bar Mitzvah gift to my grandson. He has not played it as yet. He is very good on the\npiano and he's a tremendous flutist, but maybe one day he will take up the violin, too.\nHe's a very ambitious guy.",
        "A: In the barracks.",
        "A: All kinds of music, operetta, waltzes, I think at that time known hits.",
        "A: Popular music.",
        "A: Well, not officially as I said. Privately yes, amongst our friends, yes.",
        "A: Yes. I did that, too, and also I had the violin on one of our cruises -- oh, no, I didn't have\nthe violin, but I played the violin on the cruise. It was amateur evening, a talent show.",
        "A: Yes, it was after the war. That was the only time I played the violin officially for a crowd.",
        "A: In the ghetto, I had a barber coming every day to shave me and when I needed to give me\na haircut. Naturally when you see him every day you talk about everything, also intimate\nthings in their lives and we were very friendly and he was a nice guy. And when it came\nto the curfew into the -- I should take you to the time when nobody was allowed to go out\nof the house because the Gestapo planned an Aktion where they wanted to have\neverybody in the house where they could easily get them and transport them away. I took\nthis barber, his wife and two daughters, and locked them in my apartment for the three\ndays where the Sperre'\u201d was in effect, and in doing so I probably saved their lives. Even\nafter the war we saw each other regularly and they never forgot what I did for them and\nthanks to me I think they are alive. Unfortunately, the barber and his wife passed away\nlast year, but the two daughters are living, one in Boston and the other one in Pittsburgh.",
        "A: No, after the fact she knew about that.",
        "A: I sent her to Marysin, a little bit outside, the periphery of the ghetto. So, it was not\nincluded in the Aktion and then after she knew from them. I did not tell her anything but\nthey told her. She found out from them what I did.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Yes, he wanted a favor from me and he offered me -- I don't even remember what it was,\nbut he offered me something and I took him by his collar and threw him out of my office.",
        "A: Well, I don't know if he was surprised or not but he was not very friendly towards me\nafterwards, and I couldn't care less. But I did everything what I did with a good\n'\u00b0 This term is a derivation of Gehsperre, or the ban on movement within the ghetto. The\npolicy was instituted concurrent to the violent Selektion process and prior to the\ndeportation of the Jews to Chelmno.\nconscience so I could sleep in peace because I didn't do any harm to anybody knowingly.\nSo, whatever was in my power I did for what I wanted to do not what I could get out of it.",
        "A: Not that I know of. He was asked to do it and he did 1t because somebody had to do it and\nsince I disqualified myself any old way I could, then he had to go and had to do what was\nasked of him.",
        "A: He survived and he died I think last year in Israel.",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "A: I did not. I met, after the war I met David Gertler, the gentleman who came with the SS\nmen and picked me up from Czestochowa. I met him after the war, yes. He had a store in\nMunich, in Germany, and I met with him. Unfortunately he also passed away in the\nmeantime.",
        "A: Not really, not really. But as I said, I did my duties as good as I could and I could not\nthink of any details right now which are outstanding of the normal everyday routine.",
        "A: Well, many times I thought, but I had no choice, because even if I wanted to resign,\nRumkowski would have never allowed it. Because I mentioned a few times that I feel it's\ntoo much for me and he said, \u201cYou are doing a job, so do it, and stick with it.\u201d",
        "A: I tried to think, yes... because if I would not have satisfied in what I had to do, I think he\nwould have let me know and he would have set me aside, whether my sister was his right\nhand or not, but I think it doesn't have anything to do with it because by that time I\nshowed my own abilities, I would say, in doing what I had to do, what I was asked to do.",
        "A: I don't know, he might have. He might have.",
        "A: I think that my sister had many sleepless nights because she saw and knew more than\nanybody else what was going on inside and outside the ghetto. And one time I remember\nthey took Rumkowski outside the ghetto and he didn't come back until the next day, so\nwe had feared for the worst. But he came back and nobody every spoke of what had\nhappened. Nobody even tried to guess of why he was taken away and why he was\nbrought back. In my eyes, he was not the despot, the demigod, as people made him or\nsaid he was, because as I mention to anybody I talk if not Rumkowski, no matter what he\ndid, the ghetto would have liquidated in 1942, completely, without any resistance,\nwithout anybody I believe, without me being alive today.",
        "A: She might have. She never answered the question because that's another thing that people\nwanted to know, of what transpired. She would completely ignore the question, so I don't\nknow if she knew or she didn't know.",
        "A: No, no. She was so much involved that she never spoke with me about whether to resign\nor not to resign. She had three girls working with her in the executive office and she\nworked there very, very hard, I know, long hours, and I'm sure it was nerve-racking for\nher, but she was quite a character.",
        "A: How shall I describe her? Very bright, extremely intelligent, quick to the draw, down to\nearth, and a tremendous inside view of what is happening -- all the surroundings of her.\nShe was quite a woman.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, they married after the ghetto. She married the brother of the second in command of\nEric Yakobovitch. He was the vice president, if I can say so, and he was in charge of all\nthe factories and he was a second in command. So, when Rumkowski was unable to do\nsomething, he was the one to enforce everything. He was the one to do it, and his brother\nmarried my sister after the war.",
        "A: We knew it was difficult to work for him. She didn't have to answer that because\neverybody knew it was a horrible job for anybody because as I said, he really took\neverything out of you especially when you were that close like she was to him. He was\ndemanding. He was demanding, and he wanted you to do something you better do it.",
        "A: I didn't know him before, but I know that he was a very charitable man and was always\ngoing around fundraising for his orphanage which was very close to him. I was told,\nbecause I did not know him, naturally, from before.",
        "A: Well, one thing is he lost his temper very easily... and then watch out. That's what I can\nsay about him, and you had to do what he wanted. And very, very seldom did I do against\nwhat he said. If he said A and I wanted B, I went B. I was a hothead too, you know, but it\nnever came really to a fight or something with him.",
        "A: I did, I did. Today I can say, yes, I controlled myself, but he was redheaded -- a hot guy.",
        "A: Tremendous power. He had absolute control of the ghetto. He was the man.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.",
        "A: Well, you lived with either or. You could have had the same thing from the Germans\nbecause if they didn't like something they could have done the same thing. So it was not\nan easy situation all around. All right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "A: Well, as I said, they tried to better themselves. They tried to get more food and they did\nnot realize by the same token you have today's strikes which absolutely nonsense because\nwhat do they achieve? At that time it was even more ridiculous but they didn't realize\nthat. They just tried and mobilize themselves and tried to better their condition.\nBut naturally it was in vain because what could they do? What could Rumkowski have\ndone? Just because they demonstrated, he could not go to the Germans and say I want\nmore food for my people, all right, and whatever we had we had to work for. So even\nwhen I was interviewed by Ross (ph), at his interview with me, he said how do I feel\ntoday that I cooperated with the Germans. I didn't cooperate with the Germans. Just\nbecause we manufactured something the Germans could use, well, that was our\nlivelihood. That was our bread. And a lot of people don't understand that. Okay, we made\nmunitions parts. Okay we made something the German army could use, but did we have\nanother choice? It was our work and our labor which saved us from complete starvation.\nWhat little we got but we got it because we worked for it, so there was no cooperation,\nyou know, with the Germans. So that is a misunderstanding which still goes around in a\nlot of people. But they don't think. They just go with the masses. Why? Can you imagine\nthat after the all documentation you see in public television and whatever, the Holocaust -\n- the American army when they went into these camps and made all these films of what\nthey found and still people today can say denying that there was such a thing, that it is all\npropaganda. For what propaganda? Who won the war? The Germans and the Japanese.\nThey didn't lose the war, they won it. The Marshall Plan lift them up until they are one of\nthe biggest nations of the world. Am I right or wrong?",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "A: Well, it all depends on what timeframe are we talking. We're talking 1944. We're talking\nabout the timeframe between January or February '44 to September, October. There\nmight have been about 60,000 or 70,000 people left, and all the transports took place at\nthat timeframe. We were taking into the hospital and we stayed there to be transported\nout of the ghetto. A few days before Rumkowski and Rosenblat (ph), you know, the\npolice chief and his brother and a lot of other dignitaries went with the transport to\nAuschwitz. We however, went, as I mentioned, to Sachsenhausen and then wound up in\nKoenigswusterhausen in that factory. And only about 800 people were left to liquidate\nthe ghetto and they came out smelling like a rose because they found all these treasures\nwhich were left behind in the ghetto. So, they came out fairly well-off and today they are\nall set. More power to them because better them than the Germans.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Whatever they found they could hide for themselves and then Germany was finished and\nthen they had what they took. What they found they had for themselves.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: David and her father and my father, we went together.",
        "A: We were separated. We went to Sachsenhausen and they went to Ravensbriick, and then\nvery late, it must have been, we were liberated on the 27th of April in '45 so that must\nhave been in the beginning of '45 where a transport of women were sent where we were\ninto another barrack, separated from us.\nWe had no contact and -- except when we went to labor, but I was in the factory, so, but\nthey worked outside with some men also. So in the evening they were separated again.\nAnd Eric Yakobovitch\u2019s son, who lives now in Florida, he was at that time five years old\nor six years old and he came with his mother also. But Irene and my sister, they did not\ncome with that transport. They were left in Ravensbrtick and they were liberated by the\nRussians, as we were also, in April. And just only maybe 50 or 60 women and children\ncame where we were. The rest were left, yes, and we were liberated the 27th of April\n1945 at 4:00 in the morning the Russians came. Before, I must tell you, a very bad thing\nhappened. We had also air raid trenches, and every night the sirens, you know, they came\nduring the night we were working and at day time they were bombing. So every time\nthere was an air raid we had assigned places in these trenches. The first few alarms I went\nwith my father and we went to the place where we were supposed to be, but then I said,\n\"Papa, we are not going anymore.\" I was lying on the floor under the bunks. On this end\nof the barrack my father was on the other end of the barrack and every time a bomb or\ngrenade hit we called each other to make sure that we were okay because we had 66\nshrapnel in our barrack, and where we were supposed to be there were four young\nbrothers. They came originally from Pabianice. They were in our spot where we were and\na grenade hit them full blast and all four were wiped out. It would have happened to us if\nwe would have been there. That's fate. That\u2019s fate and that's kismet.",
        "A: David, he was taken -- oh, yeah, one day towards the end I was sent to the outside\ncommando and when we came back that late afternoon, 70 men had been taken away\nfrom the camp, amongst them my father-in-law, may he rest in peace and my brother-in-\nlaw, may he rest in peace. They were taken together with the others. They were sent on a\nmarch by foot. They were supposed to go up to the North Sea, put on a boat and as a final\nsolution being bombed out and drowned. And my father-in-law, he was shot, after the\nwar had ended already, the third of May. He couldn't walk anymore and they shot him.\nMy brother-in-law was able to escape at that time. So, that was the last few days. And I\nhad my violin. That's all I took. Of course I had a few hidden items there. And I went\nwith my father after the fourth or the fifth day after we were liberated because I said\n\"Let's not go out because they're still shooting.\" And I went with the Russian commando\nto organize bread and meat and wurst and whatever. I warned people, \"Don't overeat,\ntake it easy,\" and sure enough a few people overate and got sick and blew themselves up.\nAnd I went with father and we went across a field and there was a trunk and it was\ncovered with blood and I could open it and I opened it up and there were money, German\nmoney, the Reichsmark, it must have been at least a million or more and I said to my\nfather, \"Papa, if this is here full of blood it's not worth anything because I feel that the\nReichsmark will be nothing worth after the war and there will be new money.\" If I would\nhave known that until 1948 these Reichsmarks were good and valid, I would have been a\nmillionaire at that time. I could have bought whole blocks of houses. I didn't even touch\nit. I didn't even touch one piece of paper money and I walked off with my fiddle. I went\nover to the Elbe River and there was a Russian commander and I wanted to go across the\nriver because the Americans were on the other side. That's where I wanted to be. I didn't\nwant to be with the Russians.\nSo, I went to the commandant and asked him if I could go with the first transport. They\nwere French, French prisoners of war. They were allowed to cross the Elbe River the\nnext morning and I went to the commandant and asked I would like to go with them. So,\nI go back to my hometown. So he said, \"You are a German, so you have to wait until the\nGermans can go.\" So we smuggled, my father and I smuggled ourselves into the group of\nFrench people and we made it to the ferry boat and made it across the river. We went to\nthe Americans. I went to the commander there and I introduced ourselves -- what we are\nand where we are coming from -- and so he asked me a few questions, how is \"father\" in\nHebrew, how is \"mother\" in Hebrew and, \u201cWhat kind of brakhah\" do you say over this?\u201d\nAnd so I answered him so he knew that, yes, and since then the big love affair between\nthem and us and they wanted to give us everything. I had to help him. I was as, as a, an\ninterpreter for a few days until we could freely travel until everything was clear and\nbefore we would get the first papers to travel. So, once I was very eager to go home to\nmy hometown. So the commander gave me a jeep, papers I could go everywhere to get\ngas. They called it petrol at that time, and papers that I could travel and that I have\n* blessing (Hebrew.)\nlegitimately this jeep. And so, I started driving and everywhere I asked for my wife,\nwhether somebody has seen my wife. And nobody knew. Nobody said anything. Then I\nfinally came to Hannover, to my hometown, and I started working right away in the town\nhall and registered all the people who were coming from the various camps and I\nrepatriated people like Poles to Poland and Czechs to Czech and I took them all with\nvarious passes to the various border towns and I left them there and I took the buses back\nhome because they were all from the post office. In Germany all the buses are run by the\npost office. Everywhere I was I asked people, survivors whether they know or have heard\nof my wife. Then one girl, showed it to her, which she saw the picture of the dolly said\nIrene was bombed out. She's not alive anymore. And later on Irene told me that she was\ntold that I was bombed out. So, it took us ten months after the liberation that she found\nme back in my hometown.",
        "A: I didn't know. And, well, naturally I was, I was, I was very unhappy. You know, I could\nnot get over it that easy until I saw her and then naturally you can imagine, OK, after ten\nmonths of not knowing whether she's alive or not and then we started our life back\ntogether and a year later we had our daughter, our first daughter, and then in '49 we\nfinally immigrated to the United States.",
        "A: And we came here and the first dilemma was at the pier. I was the chief interpreter on\nboard the ship and every time the office was down below and every time I had to make\nthe announcement on the deck I had to go all the way up and down and up and down. It\nwas quite strenuous, but this way I earned my trip over to the United States. I didn't feel\nlike I get charity. We came to the pier and I had to wait until the last man left the boat\nand get them through the customs. Finally, we were the last. I had three big boxes,\nplywood boxes, big ones, and a total of 11 items of luggage so I had quite, I had all our\nbelongings and a custom agent came and asked me to open up everything. I had three\npackers packing my trunks at home in Germany before I left and here all by myself it was\nalready about eight at night at that time. Aviva, our daughter, got very sick on board the\nship. She had 104 fever and she was at eight. Irene and the child was taken off board the\nship and went to the hospital. I didn't know what happened to my child. I didn't know\nwhere they were and here I was crying. It was November seven. It was a very raw day,\nmisty, cold and I had to unpack and naturally they didn't find anything. Somebody who\nloves me showed them that I brought up a fortune and I didn't declare it, but everything I\nhad there was on my declaration, OK? So, to make it short, I had to put everything back\ninto the trunk, nail them down and here they took it away into storage and I went to look\nfor my wife and my daughter and it was not before 10 at night in the Hotel Breslin on\nBroadway that I heard that my daughter is in the hospital on Metropolitan Island at that\ntime, the Metropolitan Hospital, and I had 20 dollars in my pocket which went away the\nnext day for the taxi fare to the hospital.\nSo, that same night I went to the waterfront and I saw a sign \"help wanted\", and I went in\nthere and the foreman was also of German descent so we spoke German so I got the job.\nWhat was the job? 75 cents an hour cleaning the presses. It was a spare box folding box\nfactory on Tenth and -- I don't remember this, it was on 70th or 80th street somewhere --\nin any case what was my job? To clean with kerosene the printing presses and the cutting\npresses. Three months later I was an a sample maker. I made samples and I made one\npatent for them also, which was patented for which I got a dollar because it was made\nunder their name and their time so I got a dollar for it and then six months later I took\nover the night shift. I was a superintendent for the night shift. I worked there another\nthree months and every time I wanted a raise they said don't rush the seasons, don't rush\nthe seasons. So, I quit and went to Bulova. \u201cWhat I am?\u201d \u201cAn engineer.\u201d And I started up\nat Bulova, a watch company, and they found out I had pyrotechnic experience so I went, I\ngot clearance, secret clearance and I went on the missile program. It was a very\ninteresting job I started there and I was with Bulova close to 11 years, over 10 years.\nThen I was involved in the correspondence with another outfit, Daystrom, who had to\ntake a bid on a big program also in the missile field, and they had heard of me because I\nhad made myself a name already. So, they wanted me, and another firm, TRW, in\nCleveland, they wanted me so I went for an interview and first to Cleveland.\nI spent the whole day and at that time we were in Scranton, we lived in Scranton and then\nI went to Strattford in Connecticut to Avco. I spent a whole day being interviewed there\nand they made me an offer I could not refuse.\nSo since my contract at Daystrom had a two year option that I felt I should not take, I\nwent to work for Avco Lycoming in Strattford for 20 years, and I went up to, to become a\ndirector of a department with about 400 people.",
        "A: Yes. I finished up here, yes.",
        "A: In Germany and here.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Aviva, thank heaven, she came through with it after eight days. We had papers to go to\nNorfolk. So we took Aviva when she was all right, we took her to Norfolk. We had to\ntake a ferry from somewhere down in Maryland, I guess, to go across to Norfolk, Cape\nMay, I guess, Cape May it was. And we come to Norfolk and they received us there with\nopen arms and brought us to an apartment, and Irene and I felt like crying. That much dirt\non the floor, a refrigerator with a motor on top yet, you know, like 1850. And we looked\nat her, thanked her for it, and all night long Irene and I with the razor blades we're\nscraping the floor. The next morning, I met the people I should work with and I came\nback home and I said, we really thanked them from the bottom of our hearts, but we don't\nstay here, this is not for us. We went to New York.",
        "A: That was also when I asked for first papers, I was called to the Immigration Office, and\nthey started interrogating me for about three hours, maybe a hundred questions, and I\nsaid, \"What is this all about?\" I didn't sit down, they didn't ask me to sit down, I was\nstanding. They interrogated me. Every week I was called. Every week I heard the same\nquestions standing up. This went on for over a year, almost a year and a half. One day I\ncome, \"Mr. Fuchs, sit down.\" So I sat down. \"Now we can tell you, you have good\nfriends.\" I said, \"What happened?\" \"They said that you were a Gestapo man, and that you\nhave a lot of people on your conscious. But now we found out that it's not you. There was\na Gestapo man with your name, Kommisar Fuchs.\u201d He said, \"They thought it's you. We\ngive you the papers now, and we allow you to change your name through us so you don't\nhave to go through court.\" So we were driving home with Irene and she saw Rhonda\nFleming on a movie house. So she said, \"Fleming, that's a good name, let's be Fleming,\nso we don't have to change our initials, Bernard Fuchs, Bert Fleming, it's the same\ninitials.\" So that's the game by what we become Fleming.",
        "A: Yeah, well, they asked me what I did, where I was, what my duties were, and always they\nshook their heads, and always the same questions. Then I naturally I figured that\nsomebody must have said something. But what? And they told me that they thought that\nI'm the Gestapo Fuchs.",
        "A: I was supposed to have a speech about my experience during the Holocaust in my\nMasonic Lodge, and it was publicized that I will be speaking on this subject, and the\nMaster of the Lodge called me up and said, \"Bert, we have to cancel you.\" There was\nsome accusation made that about, probably, almost the same thing of what the other\naccusations were. When I heard this, I went to my Rabbi, Rabbi Stein, and I said, \"Rabbi,\nthis and this and this happened. This and this accusations were made, and I would like to\ntake this woman for a deen Torah.\u2019\u201d\u201d'\u201d That means for a rabbinical justice, a rabbinical\ncourt. So he investigated very thoroughly. He called Europe. He called the organizations\nhere of the former Lodge people. He finally came to the end result and told that woman,\n\"You better keep your mouth shut, because he can sue you for everything you have.\" And\nhe told me, \"Bert, don't worry about it. Everything is fine.\"",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I knew her by name only. I didn't have any dealings with her. But Irene knew them very\nwell. And, but she passed away a year after what, after that happened. So that's the other\nhappening I had. But I didn't worry about it, because you know I have a clean conscience\nand now I'm lecturing high school -- Merkaz students I lecture, and also some various\nspeech, and I'm very active in B'nai Brith. I'm four years now the vice president, and I'm\na Mason, and I'm very active in the Synagogue as well their federation. So we live a very\ncomfortable life, and happy, as much as we can be happy.",
        "A: They ask a lot of questions, yes. But I must say that they were almost mesmerized when I\nspoke to them. They followed every word, and afterwards they sent, every student sent\nme a nice little letter thanking me of and the impression they had and what they have\nlearned, because I left them always a message.",
        "A: The message is: remember what we tell you, because we are dying out. So you have to\ntell your children; they have to tell their children of what happened, and make sure that it\nwill never happen again. Have your ears and eyes wide open. Rot the weed out as soon as\nyou see it. Any other things you would like to know? Did we cover it, all the territory?\n'\u00b0 \u201cDeen\u201d means verdict or court decision (Hebrew); \u201cDeen Torah\u201d is a verdict based on\nthe laws of a rabinnical court.",
        "A: I had a very successful career before I retired. I had a very interesting job. I was almost in\nthe limelight, and I've harvested the fruits of what I'd seeded because I was very lucky in\nall my endeavors. I was a troubleshooter. I found the trouble, I corrected them, I proved\nit, and that's not an easy task, and I'm very happy and lucky that I achieved it. I went up\nthe ladder, not by prodigy, not by anything else but my own ability. That's about it.",
        "A: Thank you. I hope the archive will learn something, whoever will listen or read of what\nhad happened, and really make sure that nothing happens again of that type. All right?",
        "A: Thank you.\nEnd of Tape #2\nConclusion of Interview\n"
