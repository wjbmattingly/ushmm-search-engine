        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nHarry Merin, by Stephanie Blyskal, on November 9\", 2008, in Alexandria,\nVirginia. Good morning, Mr. Merin.",
        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "Q: Could you tell me where you were born, when you were born and what your\nname was at birth?",
        "A: Okay, it\u2019s Harry Arnold Merin. I was born in Holland, Amsterdam,\nDecember 9\", 1941.",
        "Q: Wow, that\u2019s interesting. And what were \u2014 what were your parents like, what did\nthey do?",
        "A: My \u2014I don\u2019t know what my mom did, but my dad sold \u2014 actually, during that\ntime, I think he did advertising, he did sign \u2014 made signs for stores and so on.",
        "Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?",
        "A: I have a sister who was born in Holland after the war, and then a brother who\nwas born in Fort Wayne, Indiana.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you\u2019re the oldest.",
        "A: I\u2019m the oldest.",
        "Q: Okay, so, obviously you were a baby \u2014",
        "A: Obviously.",
        "Q: \u2014 during the war. So tell me a little bit about what your parents were, where they\nwere, what they were doing at this \u2014 when you were born.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I know they moved, I \u2014 I\u2019m not that \u2014 I don\u2019t have the history\nexactly, of my parents. My parents really never discussed that with me. To me, I\nwas considered too young. I know what he did after the war, I know they were\nhidden with different families. One of them was in Broek in Waterland, would be\nwith \u2014 would be Friese(ph) and Preym(ph) is the persons who they were hidden ith\n\u2014 with. And that was right at the end of the war, and my dad used to travel back and\nforth in Amsterdam. He \u2014 he had invented and wore the original roller skates, two\nwheels, and that\u2019s what he traveled with, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they moved pretty fast.\nSo, my dad had s \u2014 put money away during the war so he could get to it. And so\nthere were \u2014 I do know they were captured once and they escaped. But otherwise,\nthey had left me pretty well in the dark. The only think I knew, I was at \u2014 at the\ncamps, I was picked up. I was with a nurse, picked up and taken to the camps. I\nfound out a few years ago that I was part of a group of kids because at my age you\nfeel, how did I survive the camp, you know, when you\u2019re two and a half years old? I\nfound out I was with a group called unver kenter kinder in, where there\u2019s a whole\nmemorial at the museum. There were 51 of us, almost all of us survived.",
        "Q: Hold on. All right. Sorry for the interruption. You were talking about being in\nthe camp.",
        "A: Yes. I know I was in Bergen-Belsen and Theresienstadt. I was, after the war I\nwas brought to Hilversum, and I know my dad picked me up. Again, not much was\nsaid, but I do know he had found a motorcycle, and picked me up in a motorcycle\nfrom one of the buses, and that he had found my name in a newspaper, under the\nname Yetterman(ph). And when he got there, someone pointed to a sple \u2014 school\nbuses, or buses, some type, and he pointed to which bus I would be on. So that is\nbasically more than they used to tell me. Because they used to, you know, f\u2014a\ngroup of them got together, per se, my parents\u2019 friends, who also either hidden or\ncamp survivors, and they used to discuss things. But I was basically never allowed\ninto the group. I do know my mom has had nightmares. I didn\u2019t know how bad, that\nshe basically had nightmare almost every night. But that\u2019s \u2014 was the point, so \u2014",
        "Q: Was your family religious?",
        "A: My family was not very religious. We kept kosher, but I was not \u2014 we\u2019re not\nglatt kosher, and I still am not, but we did keep kosher. In Holland, if we traveled,\nwe had salads, or fish. And that is \u2014 that\u2019s it. Oh, except I\u2014 I\u2014 I know I used to go\nto services on Saturday, and my dad would join me once in awhile, but most of the\ntime I went to services, they sent me to services. Saturday I went by myself. And\nthat would be probably from the age of six or seven. There was no fear of me\ngetting lost, I had a very good sense of direction. And \u2014",
        "Q: And this was in Holland still?",
        "A: This was in Holland.",
        "Q: When you were born, did you \u2014 did you have a bris?",
        "A: [had a bris. I have records of what hospital I was born in, and I got records of\nthings \u2014 the person who discovered me and br-brought me into this organization per\nse, is Hans van der Bruk, Kulp(ph). Kulp(ph) is his Jewish name. And he is the\none who basically got this whole group together. And the only reason he\u2019s not here\nthis time is because he\u2019s down with lung cancer. So \u2014 but otherwise, I would not\nknow, and he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s had his hands on papers which are not open to the public.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He\u2019s been able to get into the files in Holland somehow, and got documents\nwhich shows that \u2014 in fact, the last ttme when we had the conference in Holland, I\nwent to where my grandparents used to live. And, in fact, the first time, I was back\nabout 10 years before that, so it would be about 13 years ago, the first time I went\nback to Holland. And I showed my wife where I used to live. I remember things \u2014 I\nremember what school I went to, how to find that. I went to the [indecipherable]\npark. Again, I showed her my house. I showed her where the grocery was where I\nused to go. They had a very neat operation there. You can get fresh potatoes peeled.\nThey had a machine where you threw your potatoes in. It peels it, 1t washes, you\nbuy a pound, you buy two pounds, and you bring it home. And it\u2019s some \u2014 you\nknow, nobody in the States has seen, basically. And when I went back there, I\nshowed my wife where that machine was at. So, things what a small child\nremembers, that I remember. When we left Holland, they didn\u2019t even tell me we\nwere leaving. They \u2014 they were very secretive about going anyplace. We just all of\na sudden the car was piled up with suitcases, we were going on vacation. They just\ndidn\u2019t tell me we weren\u2019t coming back. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have any family left in Holland?",
        "A: There was no family left. My mom\u2019s total family was wiped out. My dad had a\nbrother in the States, and actually he has a sister who lives in New York, my aunt,\nwho was in the Nuremberg trials because she was a secretary to the\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So, that is all that I really know. And like I said, I\u2019m finding out about my roots,\nbasically, especially the first ca \u2014 so I ris \u2014 I\u2019ve have a lot of incosyncrasies(ph) in\nmy life, and I found out I wasn\u2019t the only one. You know, I \u2014I put more f\u2014 more\nfood away than most people, I \u2014 you know, we always have extra stuff. I don\u2019t\nbelieve in wasting food. Of course, that\u2019s one of the reason why I got a little fatter,\nbecause if the kids didn\u2019t eat it all, I'd eat it. You don\u2019t leave food on your plate.\nAnd I get upset with my son-in-law, who fills up a plate and then leaves half of it,\nyou know. So, it just \u2014 so there are some items which I\u2019ve grown up with, which\nI\u2019ve done, which make sense now, but they didn\u2019t then.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, do you \u2014 this is sort of an odd question, but what do you think\nyour first memory is? What is the thing that you can remember first from your\nchildhood, whether it be a picture of something in your br \u2014 1n your mind, or \u2014",
        "A: I have a\u2014I have a \u2014a block conference. In other words, anything which is bad,\nwhich has happened to me, gets blocked out. I do know that when I was in the\nsecond grade, and there was a lady, a girl in the first grade, who works at the Jewish\nMuseum in Holland. When I went there the first time 13 years ago, I was looking to\nsee what type of information I can find on me. And I gave her my last name, and\nshe turned around and she says, you\u2019re Harry. And my mouth dropped open.\nBecause at that time, when was in first grade, I still remembered. But I have\nforgotten totally.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s blo \u2014 it\u2019s 1n there, but it\u2019s blocked. I have phobias which have come\ninto light now, which I\u2019ve never had.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I\u2019ve got some thought about it, but I don\u2019t know exactly why, but I do know I\u2019ve\ngot some phobias which I didn't have in the past and they\u2019re coming out. So, but the\n[indecipherable] the shock of, for some odd reason, 40 years later, she remembered\nmy name, my first name, my story and so on.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So of course that means she\u2019s got an excellent memory, maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s\nworking at the museum.",
        "Q: Where are you liber \u2014 sorry, this is \u2014 where are you liberated from?",
        "A: It would have been from Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: Bergen-Belsen, okay, so you were four years old?",
        "A: About four years old, yes.",
        "Q: Do you ha \u2014 you don\u2019t have any recollection of that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember anything. I do remember the persons, the nurse where I stayed\nat, I know she was still alive after the war, and I know my parents took me there,\nonce in a great while. And again, I remember things. Her husband, he was hard of\nhearing and I remember he had a big horn, and you had to speak into that big horn.\nBut, in other words, it\u2019s items what a small child will remember, close to the\nground.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Those are the things I remember. I remember in Holland, when I went to visit\nthe house, which was also very unusual, because there was a fellow who was a\ncantor, who lived there now, a Jewish fellow. So, when I knocked, some stranger,\nI\u2019m showing my wife where I used to live 40 years ago. You know, they let me go\nin and I s \u2014 there used to be something down here, you know, like a frog in\nsomething. He says, yeah, we moved that \u2014 about \u2014 after we moved into the house\n10 years ago. So those are the things you remember.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So it\u2019s \u2014 I remember my parents used to send me to [indecipherable] a lot. I\ndon\u2019t remember how, but there was a place back there, someplace how you can\nescape out of the backyard, and I used to wander through the \u2014 the dunes there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: At the beach. And again, I could be back in time for dinner, and they weren\u2019t\nworried about me \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014I was a regular visitor there. They had a room for me year round.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My parents used to travel a lot. After the war my dad sold ladies\u2019 hats and\ndresses, and he was \u2014 he sold hats all through Europe. So he had salespeople on the\nroad, and then every so often he\u2019d go to all his clients, you know, personally. But \u2014\nso \u2014 and I know I went to [indecipherable] but I didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was too structured. But again, you know, for \u2014 for a six and seven year old \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 just be able to \u2014 they put me on a train, someone would pick me up. And it\nwould s \u2014 again, one time my sense of direction was \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 excellent. And I used to walk from the synagogue where I went to \u2014 on\nShabbas, for the high holidays, I walk all the way to this [indecipherable]\nsynagogue downtown in Amsterdam. And you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 probably a good three\nmile walk, and considering when you\u2019re seven and eight years old. You know,\npeople nowadays wouldn\u2019t let your child to go that far.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But again, they didn\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019d find my way back, so \u2014 so it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: So when did you come to the United States? When does your family pack up\nthe car and head into ha \u2014 what was the journey like?",
        "A: Well, I remember we went to \u2014 my parents had to do something, I was left in a\nchild [indecipherable] in Germany. Wer \u2014 I know we \u2014 we left out of Germany. I\nwas there, I was two weeks at camp over there. Again, a young person doesn\u2019t have\nany problem communication.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Communication. And there was \u2014 oh, you know, you had minefields there and\nbombs and stuff, but again, you know, I got along with the other kids, and we\u2019d go\n\u2014 used to go scavenging for metal, which you can take to the junkyard, and then you\ncan take that money and buy candies with it. So, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Now it\u2019s pretty good.",
        "A: Yeah, and then we were in a \u2014 a camp [indecipherable] camp, probably for at\nleast six months. And it\u2019s like apartment buildings and you know, you \u2014 I, of\ncourse, pick up the milk in the morning fu \u2014 you know, in a bucket, and so on, and I\ndon\u2019t remember much else. I know there was \u2014 the Black Forest was nearby, and\nit\u2019s one place they said I shouldn\u2019t go, because you can get lost in there. But you\nknow, know, they have paths and \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 we used to walk on the paths every so often. And I remember for Rosh\nHashanah, they had a Shochet there and they would bake a live chicken, and it was\n\u2014 shochet it, you know, there on the spot and so on. So \u2014 but otherwise, no. A-And\nI remember the boat trip over. We came in December, and they had a nice, big\nstorm. And I know all the adults were sick, and all us kids were happy because we\ngot to go down and \u2014 and have all the desserts we want. So \u2014",
        "Q: And where did you arrive into?",
        "A: We arrived actually, December the ninth in New Orleans.",
        "Q: Aha.",
        "A: And I have not been able to figure out what ship I came on. I know it was a\nAmerican destroyer \u2014 well, American ship of some type, which was converted to a\npassenger. But I don\u2019t remember \u2014",
        "Q: So you arrived on your birthday.",
        "A: I arrived on my birthday. That made it easy for me to remember. And I\nremember they had a TV there, so you could watch Hopalong Cassidy and all\nthese cowboy shows, which of course, I didn\u2019t understand, but you know that was \u2014\nit was a movie. So \u2014 and us kids sat there in front of the tube while the adults were\nbusy with everything what was going on. Yeah, I was \u2014 I turned 10 when I arrived.\nAnd I know we left Harlem when I was \u2014 was about eight and a half. We traveled\nactually to Europe for almost a year for \u2014",
        "Q: And \u2014 and then you moved to \u2014 to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Then we moved from \u2014 my mom wanted someplace warm, like someplace like\nNew Orleans, and my dad says no, we\u2019ll go someplace a little further north, so we\nended up in Saint Louis, since his brother lived in Saint Louis.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We stayed there one summer, and then we moved to Detroit, it was too hot. The\nonly thing you had in Saint Louis in those days were window air conditioners. It\nwas very little \u2014 you didn\u2019t have houses, you had window \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, so that was it. So, like I said, one summer is all that it took.",
        "Q: Move farther north.",
        "A: Move further north. I remember Eisenhower, everybody was talking about\nEisenhower, and I was talking, who\u2019s he? So \u2014",
        "Q: And what languages were you speaking at this point?",
        "A: At that point I was still speaking Hollands. I did not know any English. You\nlearned the words yes and no, and so on. And thank you. I went to a Jewish day\nschool in Saint Louis for a few months, and my parents didn\u2019t think I was learning\nenough English.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I went to a public school. And like I said, by that fall we \u2014 we were moving \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 to \u2014 to Detroit. I know we stayed in the apartment for probably about a year,\nand then we moved into a house.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And you were speaking more English by this point, were you picking it\nup? How was \u2014",
        "A: I was \u2014 well, I was picking \u2014 I was learning more English as I was going along,\nyes.",
        "Q: And how was school for you?",
        "A: Nowadays, they have persons who speak your language and they take you to\nthrough the year right along. In those days they did not. I know I started off in first\ngrade with \u2014 with English and then I progressed \u2014 you know, I\u2019d skip one or two\nsemester \u2014 you know, you \u2014 during \u2014 during the year I\u2019d move up one more grade.\nMath I was all right in.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Cause it\u2019s a universal language.",
        "A: But story problems I still have problems with. My wife \u2014 in fact, even in college,\nmy wife \u2014 I\u2019d write the paper, then my wife translates it, corrects the spelling, and\neverything. Because in English I\u2019m very poor at spelling. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s it, but\nshe did my term papers and everything else.",
        "Q: So where did you wind up going to college?",
        "A: I went to, actually, Perdue University.",
        "Q: Perdue. What did you study?",
        "A: Interior decorating.",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: So, and that\u2019s my field.",
        "Q: Wow. And did you meet your wife in college, or did you know her before?",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I knew her before, she was a blind date.",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "Q: And she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s originally from?",
        "A: Fort Wayne.",
        "Q: Fort Wayne.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we got married in \u201971 and I had been dating her for almost nine\nyears. So \u2014",
        "Q: A-And how many kids do you have?",
        "A: We have three kids, and I got seven grandkids.",
        "Q: Wow, that\u2019s wonderful.",
        "A: So \u2014 and my two daughters live in Cincinnati. My son-in-law, well, a month ago\nhe finally closed \u2014 he had a restaurant, a kosher restaurant here. And he did not get\nsupport of the city. Ninety percent of his clients during the day were non-Jewish,\nand he \u2014 he finally had to close it.",
        "Q: Yeah. That\u2019s too bad.",
        "A: Closed it up just before the holidays because basically with the holidays, you\u2019re\nclosed all month anyhow, so.",
        "Q: Right, right. Well, is there anything else you want to mention, anything else you\nwant to add\u2019? Anything else you\u2019re thinking about?",
        "A: It\u2019s basically, like I said, with the conferences, I\u2019m finding out stuff. I don\u2019t\nknow almost nothing about my parents. Again, they wouldn't talk about it. I did find\nout from my aunt that my dad used to live on the border between Germany and\nHolland, and then he basically snuck across the border into Holland. And my dad\nsays, if you pay taxes and stuff, they\u2019Il let you stay.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: As long as you\u2019re paying them good money, they u \u2014 they want you to stay.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they \u2014 he met my mom in Holland and they got married. I do have the\nrecords of that because I want to \u2014 in Amsterdam, I want to \u2014 what e \u2014 whatever\nthe house is, whatever \u2014 it\u2019s a registrant, you know, for information and I \u2014I got\nactually copies of my mom\u2019s, and I got a copy of my birth certificate there.",
        "Q: Right. But it\u2019s just something that you\u2019ve blocked.",
        "A: Yeah, I wa \u2014 that part I didn\u2019t block.",
        "Q: Right. But \u2014",
        "A: But I never knew about it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Again, th-there are incidents in my life which I have blocked.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I just \u2014 and I still do that today.",
        "Q: And did you ever ask your parents about any of this, or was it just one of those\nthings that you just didn\u2019t do?",
        "A: My parents \u2014 no, European-wise, you just didn\u2019t do it. And if you did ask, oh,\nit\u2019s not important, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, we really don\u2019t want to \u2014 basically, we really\ndon\u2019t want to talk about it to you.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay. Actually, my brother found out more than I did. And well, by that time \u2014\nhe is 18 years younger than me, and my did didn\u2019t have the strength to fight\n[indecipherable]. So, he is th \u2014 he is the baby, and my mom 1s still alive, but she 1s\nnot totally coherent any more, she\u2019s \u2014 she 1s, but she isn\u2019t. She can\u2019t \u2014 she\u2019s\nbedridden, and she has been for the last three years, totally.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So-",
        "Q: It\u2019s too hard.",
        "A: Yeah, it just \u2014 yeah. And like I said, you do have her story on tape, which \u2014",

        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "A: Okay, it\u2019s Harry Arnold Merin. I was born in Holland, Amsterdam,\nDecember 9\", 1941.",
        "A: My \u2014I don\u2019t know what my mom did, but my dad sold \u2014 actually, during that\ntime, I think he did advertising, he did sign \u2014 made signs for stores and so on.",
        "A: I have a sister who was born in Holland after the war, and then a brother who\nwas born in Fort Wayne, Indiana.",
        "A: I\u2019m the oldest.",
        "A: Obviously.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I know they moved, I \u2014 I\u2019m not that \u2014 I don\u2019t have the history\nexactly, of my parents. My parents really never discussed that with me. To me, I\nwas considered too young. I know what he did after the war, I know they were\nhidden with different families. One of them was in Broek in Waterland, would be\nwith \u2014 would be Friese(ph) and Preym(ph) is the persons who they were hidden ith\n\u2014 with. And that was right at the end of the war, and my dad used to travel back and\nforth in Amsterdam. He \u2014 he had invented and wore the original roller skates, two\nwheels, and that\u2019s what he traveled with, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they moved pretty fast.\nSo, my dad had s \u2014 put money away during the war so he could get to it. And so\nthere were \u2014 I do know they were captured once and they escaped. But otherwise,\nthey had left me pretty well in the dark. The only think I knew, I was at \u2014 at the\ncamps, I was picked up. I was with a nurse, picked up and taken to the camps. I\nfound out a few years ago that I was part of a group of kids because at my age you\nfeel, how did I survive the camp, you know, when you\u2019re two and a half years old? I\nfound out I was with a group called unver kenter kinder in, where there\u2019s a whole\nmemorial at the museum. There were 51 of us, almost all of us survived.",
        "A: Yes. I know I was in Bergen-Belsen and Theresienstadt. I was, after the war I\nwas brought to Hilversum, and I know my dad picked me up. Again, not much was\nsaid, but I do know he had found a motorcycle, and picked me up in a motorcycle\nfrom one of the buses, and that he had found my name in a newspaper, under the\nname Yetterman(ph). And when he got there, someone pointed to a sple \u2014 school\nbuses, or buses, some type, and he pointed to which bus I would be on. So that is\nbasically more than they used to tell me. Because they used to, you know, f\u2014a\ngroup of them got together, per se, my parents\u2019 friends, who also either hidden or\ncamp survivors, and they used to discuss things. But I was basically never allowed\ninto the group. I do know my mom has had nightmares. I didn\u2019t know how bad, that\nshe basically had nightmare almost every night. But that\u2019s \u2014 was the point, so \u2014",
        "A: My family was not very religious. We kept kosher, but I was not \u2014 we\u2019re not\nglatt kosher, and I still am not, but we did keep kosher. In Holland, if we traveled,\nwe had salads, or fish. And that is \u2014 that\u2019s it. Oh, except I\u2014 I\u2014 I know I used to go\nto services on Saturday, and my dad would join me once in awhile, but most of the\ntime I went to services, they sent me to services. Saturday I went by myself. And\nthat would be probably from the age of six or seven. There was no fear of me\ngetting lost, I had a very good sense of direction. And \u2014",
        "A: This was in Holland.",
        "A: [had a bris. I have records of what hospital I was born in, and I got records of\nthings \u2014 the person who discovered me and br-brought me into this organization per\nse, is Hans van der Bruk, Kulp(ph). Kulp(ph) is his Jewish name. And he is the\none who basically got this whole group together. And the only reason he\u2019s not here\nthis time is because he\u2019s down with lung cancer. So \u2014 but otherwise, I would not\nknow, and he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s had his hands on papers which are not open to the public.",
        "A: He\u2019s been able to get into the files in Holland somehow, and got documents\nwhich shows that \u2014 in fact, the last ttme when we had the conference in Holland, I\nwent to where my grandparents used to live. And, in fact, the first time, I was back\nabout 10 years before that, so it would be about 13 years ago, the first time I went\nback to Holland. And I showed my wife where I used to live. I remember things \u2014 I\nremember what school I went to, how to find that. I went to the [indecipherable]\npark. Again, I showed her my house. I showed her where the grocery was where I\nused to go. They had a very neat operation there. You can get fresh potatoes peeled.\nThey had a machine where you threw your potatoes in. It peels it, 1t washes, you\nbuy a pound, you buy two pounds, and you bring it home. And it\u2019s some \u2014 you\nknow, nobody in the States has seen, basically. And when I went back there, I\nshowed my wife where that machine was at. So, things what a small child\nremembers, that I remember. When we left Holland, they didn\u2019t even tell me we\nwere leaving. They \u2014 they were very secretive about going anyplace. We just all of\na sudden the car was piled up with suitcases, we were going on vacation. They just\ndidn\u2019t tell me we weren\u2019t coming back. So \u2014",
        "A: There was no family left. My mom\u2019s total family was wiped out. My dad had a\nbrother in the States, and actually he has a sister who lives in New York, my aunt,\nwho was in the Nuremberg trials because she was a secretary to the\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: So, that is all that I really know. And like I said, I\u2019m finding out about my roots,\nbasically, especially the first ca \u2014 so I ris \u2014 I\u2019ve have a lot of incosyncrasies(ph) in\nmy life, and I found out I wasn\u2019t the only one. You know, I \u2014I put more f\u2014 more\nfood away than most people, I \u2014 you know, we always have extra stuff. I don\u2019t\nbelieve in wasting food. Of course, that\u2019s one of the reason why I got a little fatter,\nbecause if the kids didn\u2019t eat it all, I'd eat it. You don\u2019t leave food on your plate.\nAnd I get upset with my son-in-law, who fills up a plate and then leaves half of it,\nyou know. So, it just \u2014 so there are some items which I\u2019ve grown up with, which\nI\u2019ve done, which make sense now, but they didn\u2019t then.",
        "A: I have a\u2014I have a \u2014a block conference. In other words, anything which is bad,\nwhich has happened to me, gets blocked out. I do know that when I was in the\nsecond grade, and there was a lady, a girl in the first grade, who works at the Jewish\nMuseum in Holland. When I went there the first time 13 years ago, I was looking to\nsee what type of information I can find on me. And I gave her my last name, and\nshe turned around and she says, you\u2019re Harry. And my mouth dropped open.\nBecause at that time, when was in first grade, I still remembered. But I have\nforgotten totally.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s blo \u2014 it\u2019s 1n there, but it\u2019s blocked. I have phobias which have come\ninto light now, which I\u2019ve never had.",
        "A: I\u2019ve got some thought about it, but I don\u2019t know exactly why, but I do know I\u2019ve\ngot some phobias which I didn't have in the past and they\u2019re coming out. So, but the\n[indecipherable] the shock of, for some odd reason, 40 years later, she remembered\nmy name, my first name, my story and so on.",
        "A: So of course that means she\u2019s got an excellent memory, maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s\nworking at the museum.",
        "A: It would have been from Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: About four years old, yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember anything. I do remember the persons, the nurse where I stayed\nat, I know she was still alive after the war, and I know my parents took me there,\nonce in a great while. And again, I remember things. Her husband, he was hard of\nhearing and I remember he had a big horn, and you had to speak into that big horn.\nBut, in other words, it\u2019s items what a small child will remember, close to the\nground.",
        "A: Those are the things I remember. I remember in Holland, when I went to visit\nthe house, which was also very unusual, because there was a fellow who was a\ncantor, who lived there now, a Jewish fellow. So, when I knocked, some stranger,\nI\u2019m showing my wife where I used to live 40 years ago. You know, they let me go\nin and I s \u2014 there used to be something down here, you know, like a frog in\nsomething. He says, yeah, we moved that \u2014 about \u2014 after we moved into the house\n10 years ago. So those are the things you remember.",
        "A: So it\u2019s \u2014 I remember my parents used to send me to [indecipherable] a lot. I\ndon\u2019t remember how, but there was a place back there, someplace how you can\nescape out of the backyard, and I used to wander through the \u2014 the dunes there.",
        "A: At the beach. And again, I could be back in time for dinner, and they weren\u2019t\nworried about me \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I was a regular visitor there. They had a room for me year round.",
        "A: My parents used to travel a lot. After the war my dad sold ladies\u2019 hats and\ndresses, and he was \u2014 he sold hats all through Europe. So he had salespeople on the\nroad, and then every so often he\u2019d go to all his clients, you know, personally. But \u2014\nso \u2014 and I know I went to [indecipherable] but I didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: It was too structured. But again, you know, for \u2014 for a six and seven year old \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 just be able to \u2014 they put me on a train, someone would pick me up. And it\nwould s \u2014 again, one time my sense of direction was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 excellent. And I used to walk from the synagogue where I went to \u2014 on\nShabbas, for the high holidays, I walk all the way to this [indecipherable]\nsynagogue downtown in Amsterdam. And you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 probably a good three\nmile walk, and considering when you\u2019re seven and eight years old. You know,\npeople nowadays wouldn\u2019t let your child to go that far.",
        "A: But again, they didn\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019d find my way back, so \u2014 so it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Well, I remember we went to \u2014 my parents had to do something, I was left in a\nchild [indecipherable] in Germany. Wer \u2014 I know we \u2014 we left out of Germany. I\nwas there, I was two weeks at camp over there. Again, a young person doesn\u2019t have\nany problem communication.",
        "A: Communication. And there was \u2014 oh, you know, you had minefields there and\nbombs and stuff, but again, you know, I got along with the other kids, and we\u2019d go\n\u2014 used to go scavenging for metal, which you can take to the junkyard, and then you\ncan take that money and buy candies with it. So, you know \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and then we were in a \u2014 a camp [indecipherable] camp, probably for at\nleast six months. And it\u2019s like apartment buildings and you know, you \u2014 I, of\ncourse, pick up the milk in the morning fu \u2014 you know, in a bucket, and so on, and I\ndon\u2019t remember much else. I know there was \u2014 the Black Forest was nearby, and\nit\u2019s one place they said I shouldn\u2019t go, because you can get lost in there. But you\nknow, know, they have paths and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we used to walk on the paths every so often. And I remember for Rosh\nHashanah, they had a Shochet there and they would bake a live chicken, and it was\n\u2014 shochet it, you know, there on the spot and so on. So \u2014 but otherwise, no. A-And\nI remember the boat trip over. We came in December, and they had a nice, big\nstorm. And I know all the adults were sick, and all us kids were happy because we\ngot to go down and \u2014 and have all the desserts we want. So \u2014",
        "A: We arrived actually, December the ninth in New Orleans.",
        "A: And I have not been able to figure out what ship I came on. I know it was a\nAmerican destroyer \u2014 well, American ship of some type, which was converted to a\npassenger. But I don\u2019t remember \u2014",
        "A: I arrived on my birthday. That made it easy for me to remember. And I\nremember they had a TV there, so you could watch Hopalong Cassidy and all\nthese cowboy shows, which of course, I didn\u2019t understand, but you know that was \u2014\nit was a movie. So \u2014 and us kids sat there in front of the tube while the adults were\nbusy with everything what was going on. Yeah, I was \u2014 I turned 10 when I arrived.\nAnd I know we left Harlem when I was \u2014 was about eight and a half. We traveled\nactually to Europe for almost a year for \u2014",
        "A: Then we moved from \u2014 my mom wanted someplace warm, like someplace like\nNew Orleans, and my dad says no, we\u2019ll go someplace a little further north, so we\nended up in Saint Louis, since his brother lived in Saint Louis.",
        "A: We stayed there one summer, and then we moved to Detroit, it was too hot. The\nonly thing you had in Saint Louis in those days were window air conditioners. It\nwas very little \u2014 you didn\u2019t have houses, you had window \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, so that was it. So, like I said, one summer is all that it took.",
        "A: Move further north. I remember Eisenhower, everybody was talking about\nEisenhower, and I was talking, who\u2019s he? So \u2014",
        "A: At that point I was still speaking Hollands. I did not know any English. You\nlearned the words yes and no, and so on. And thank you. I went to a Jewish day\nschool in Saint Louis for a few months, and my parents didn\u2019t think I was learning\nenough English.",
        "A: So I went to a public school. And like I said, by that fall we \u2014 we were moving \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to \u2014 to Detroit. I know we stayed in the apartment for probably about a year,\nand then we moved into a house.",
        "A: I was \u2014 well, I was picking \u2014 I was learning more English as I was going along,\nyes.",
        "A: Nowadays, they have persons who speak your language and they take you to\nthrough the year right along. In those days they did not. I know I started off in first\ngrade with \u2014 with English and then I progressed \u2014 you know, I\u2019d skip one or two\nsemester \u2014 you know, you \u2014 during \u2014 during the year I\u2019d move up one more grade.\nMath I was all right in.",
        "A: But story problems I still have problems with. My wife \u2014 in fact, even in college,\nmy wife \u2014 I\u2019d write the paper, then my wife translates it, corrects the spelling, and\neverything. Because in English I\u2019m very poor at spelling. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s it, but\nshe did my term papers and everything else.",
        "A: I went to, actually, Perdue University.",
        "A: Interior decorating.",
        "A: So, and that\u2019s my field.",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I knew her before, she was a blind date.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "A: Fort Wayne.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we got married in \u201971 and I had been dating her for almost nine\nyears. So \u2014",
        "A: We have three kids, and I got seven grandkids.",
        "A: So \u2014 and my two daughters live in Cincinnati. My son-in-law, well, a month ago\nhe finally closed \u2014 he had a restaurant, a kosher restaurant here. And he did not get\nsupport of the city. Ninety percent of his clients during the day were non-Jewish,\nand he \u2014 he finally had to close it.",
        "A: Closed it up just before the holidays because basically with the holidays, you\u2019re\nclosed all month anyhow, so.",
        "A: It\u2019s basically, like I said, with the conferences, I\u2019m finding out stuff. I don\u2019t\nknow almost nothing about my parents. Again, they wouldn't talk about it. I did find\nout from my aunt that my dad used to live on the border between Germany and\nHolland, and then he basically snuck across the border into Holland. And my dad\nsays, if you pay taxes and stuff, they\u2019Il let you stay.",
        "A: As long as you\u2019re paying them good money, they u \u2014 they want you to stay.",
        "A: And they \u2014 he met my mom in Holland and they got married. I do have the\nrecords of that because I want to \u2014 in Amsterdam, I want to \u2014 what e \u2014 whatever\nthe house is, whatever \u2014 it\u2019s a registrant, you know, for information and I \u2014I got\nactually copies of my mom\u2019s, and I got a copy of my birth certificate there.",
        "A: Yeah, I wa \u2014 that part I didn\u2019t block.",
        "A: But I never knew about it.",
        "A: Again, th-there are incidents in my life which I have blocked.",
        "A: I just \u2014 and I still do that today.",
        "A: My parents \u2014 no, European-wise, you just didn\u2019t do it. And if you did ask, oh,\nit\u2019s not important, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, we really don\u2019t want to \u2014 basically, we really\ndon\u2019t want to talk about it to you.",
