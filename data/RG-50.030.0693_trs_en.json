So we all got up,\neverybody got dressed except me, I stayed in my pajamas. We looked out the\nwindow. And this is what we heard a-afterwards, th-that somebody came to the\nbakery and asked if there are Jews in the house, and they said no. So they went\naway. And apparently one of the kids I tangled with at one time mentioned, on the\nsecond floor, Jews living. So they ca \u2014 so th-they came in the house, went onto the\nsecond \u2014 the second floor. On each floor there were two apar \u2014 uni \u2014 each landing,\nApril 15, 2013\nyou know, there were two apartments.

So they asked them to get the ga \u2014 an ax from the basement. So\nthey came up, and just before they went into their apartment, they said, are you\nJews? And they said no, we are not Jews, they are the Jews. S-So they came into our\napartment, and they chased us out. So we went one floor up, in the \u2014 you know, the\nnext floor up, so up the stairs. And they started smashing furniture, musical\ninstruments, split open the feather beds. The mur \u2014 mur \u2014 we had a \u2014 a \u2014 sort of a big\ncupboard where my mother had made jams and you know, pickled stuff, they\nsmashed that. So you can imagine the feathers, and the pickles, and a real mess. But\nfortunately, they didn\u2019t arrest my father. Because a lot of men were arrested. As a\nmatter of fact, even people my age were arrested. I don\u2019t know, it may come up later\nin the story, a fre \u2014 friends of ours, the son was arrested wi \u2014 and the father. But the\nson was released right \u2014 right away. So after that we had to move into a house where\nonly Jews lived. So we \u2014\nApril 15, 2013",

But this really \u2014 at that time it sinks in that \u2014 you\nknow, that you\u2019re threatened, you know. So we had to move into a house where only\nJewish people lived. Yeah?",
        "Q: Before that happens \u2014 excuse me \u2014 were you able \u2014 able to salvage anything from\nyour old apartment?",

So one day they were leaving\n\u2014 you know, they made arrangements, they were leaving for England to wait out\ntheir quo-quota number, to be called at a later date. And my father s \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nho \u2014I\u2014I don\u2019t know what go-got in his mind. He said to me, you want to go with\nApril 15, 2013\nthem? And I said, if you come along. I think he re \u2014 tried to smuggle me \u2014 you\nknow, we had those letters that \u2014 th-th-these letters were August \u201939, and the war\nstarted September \u2014",
        "Q: September.",
        "A: \u2014 \u201839",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: So, this was in \u2014 this was in Se-September, when these fre \u2014 when these \u2014 the fre\n\u2014 the friends were moving to England. On that day he asked me if I want to come,\nhe s \u2014 he \u2014I said, if he would come. So we went, and there\u2019s some things, like I said,\nI for \u2014 I forgot completely, but was aware of again, when I received \u2014 when I was re-\nrecently reading my let \u2014 the letters. So what happened was, they were going on a \u2014\non the train to Wurzburg, to m \u2014 get an express train that goes through Holland.\nAnd I had \u2014 didn\u2019t have papers. I \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what was in his mind, I didn\u2019t\nhave papers to go to Holland. In Holland we had a \u2014 a cousin living. Maybe he tried\nto smu-smuggle me over. I don \u2014 I really don\u2019t know what was in his mind. Okay, so\nwe were supposed to take that train to Wiirzburg, took an express train. And\naccording to the story in the letters, the \u2014 the train was delayed, which meant that we\ndidn\u2019t get the express train. So when we go to Wurzburg, we got another train, it\nstopped in Cologne. Wa \u2014 as we were in the station, a group of Kindertransport\nwas going to England. My father asked them if I could travel with them, so they\nApril 15, 2013\nsaid okay, if \u2014 if \u2014 1f you have papers. And it so happened that in Cologne was an\nEnglish consulate. We go \u2014 he and I, we went there. It was closed. They told me to\nwait a block away. Somehow he got inside. He got a stamp in my passport. It was\nthe last day of the co \u2014 the consul to be there. It\u2019s the last day. So he got in, got a\nstamp in my passport, with a notation, see letter. You know, the letter from Berlin\nand \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: \u2014 sort of \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 and th \u2014 and it was like a puzzle where one piece fitted into the other. If \u2014\nif \u2014 if there wouldn\u2019t have been a \u2014 a children transport in Cologne, I wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen \u2014 come to England.

So nobody had the\nfaintest idea what the future would bring. I would say that in in their mind, they felt\nwe had to get out; we were restricted, we were persecuted. But they figured, there is\ngoing to be a war, which eventually ends, and sooner or later we\u2019ll be out of here,\nyou know? That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my feeling.

Taylor jumped on the running board of the car,\nand forced the driver, who was wearing Luftwaffe uniform, to pull up. There were\nfour men in the car, and one who spoke English said he had papers for Field\nMarshall Montgomery to sign. Taylor then asked a German policeman if the papers\nwere in order and the German replied, yes. Still not satisfied, Taylor took the\noccupants of the car to Fusilier Miller, the interpreter and Miller immediately had\nthem taken before the c.o. Taylor returned to his post on the bridge and a few\nminutes later one of the men he had arrested was marched onto the bridge again, and\nhis photograph was taken with the c.o. and adjutant. This man was the notorious\nSeyss-Inquart. So thanks to the vigilance of one of our battalion\u2019s men, another war\ncriminal was in the bag. Terrific. Let\u2019s put that in there.

On that day he asked me if I want to come,\nhe s \u2014 he \u2014I said, if he would come. So we went, and there\u2019s some things, like I said,\nI for \u2014 I forgot completely, but was aware of again, when I received \u2014 when I was re-\nrecently reading my let \u2014 the letters. So what happened was, they were going on a \u2014\non the train to Wurzburg, to m \u2014 get an express train that goes through Holland.\nAnd I had \u2014 didn\u2019t have papers. I \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what was in his mind, I didn\u2019t\nhave papers to go to Holland. In Holland we had a \u2014 a cousin living. Maybe he tried\nto smu-smuggle me over. I don \u2014 I really don\u2019t know what was in his mind. Okay, so\nwe were supposed to take that train to Wiirzburg, took an express train. And\naccording to the story in the letters, the \u2014 the train was delayed, which meant that we\ndidn\u2019t get the express train. So when we go to Wurzburg, we got another train, it\nstopped in Cologne. Wa \u2014 as we were in the station, a group of Kindertransport\nwas going to England. My father asked them if I could travel with them, so they\nApril 15, 2013\nsaid okay, if \u2014 if \u2014 1f you have papers. And it so happened that in Cologne was an\nEnglish consulate. We go \u2014 he and I, we went there. It was closed. They told me to\nwait a block away. Somehow he got inside. He got a stamp in my passport. It was\nthe last day of the co \u2014 the consul to be there. It\u2019s the last day. So he got in, got a\nstamp in my passport, with a notation, see letter.
