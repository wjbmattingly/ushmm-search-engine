        "Question: This is an interview with Professor Edward Anders, conducted by Randy Goldman on\nFebruary 28\"\", 1997. Tape one, side A.",
        "Answer: I\u2019m Edward Anders. My birth name was Edward Alperovich. I was born on June 21\",\n1926 in Libau, Latvia with the Latvian name of the place 1s Liepaja.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. My father, whose name was -- was Adolf, nothing -- no relation to the notorious\nAdolf, wa-was a businessman, he had inherited a grain export business from his father. And in\naddition to that he had a -- a partnership 1n a grain mill, and for awhile he also had leased a\nnumber of movie theaters, which was very nice for us because we could go to the movies for\nfree. And he -- h-he was fairly wealthy, but the depression affected his business a lot and the\nincome went way down and we found it necessary to move into a much smaller apartment,\nactually in the house of my grandmother. And so we had to live on a very limited budget for a\nnumber of years during the depression years. My mother was a v -- a very attractive woman. Her\nparents had -- well, her f-father was born in Libau, her mother actually came from Mitau, which\nwas the capital of the former Duchy of Courland, and her family, I think, had lived in Latvia for\nquite a few generations. My mother was the youngest of three daughters, had -- they also had a\nson. Her father, again, was fairly prosperous before World War I, but then, with the German\ntroops advancing into Latvia, decided to flee to Saint Petersburg, and somehow during the war\nand revolution, managed to lose all his money, so he came back almost penniless, and somehow\nthe -- the family never recovered, th-they lived rather modestly. Okay, about my childhood, yes,\nin the early years, we lived in a -- in a comfortable apartment, my brother and I each had a -- a\ngoverness, and as -- which was the custom in those days. Our family was somewhat Germanized,\nlike many of the e-educated Jews in -- in Courland and sort of western Latvia. My parents had\ngone to Russian schools so they would often speak Russian to one another when they didn\u2019t want\nus children to understand. But the rest of time we all spoke German. And I never learned to\nspeak Yiddish. My father could, my -- my mother could also speak it, but not quite as fluently.\nAnd we -- my -- my brother was t -- his name was George, was two years old than I. My father\nwas rather partial to his oldest son, which of -- in the early years was a bit of a problem for me,\nbut in -- eventually, I think shortly before he died, he began to treat us equally. Okay, maybe you\ncan ask me another question.",
        "Q: Did -- was your family religious?",
        "A: My mother was fairly religious. We certainly observed the major holidays, usually went to\nour grandparents or had a Seder in our own house. Usually at the grandparents. My father, for\nsome reason, had quit the Jewish temple, it -- 1t doesn\u2019t mean that he totally abandoned the\nreligion, there -- I think there were some quasi-political differences. My paternal grandfather\nactually was a -- a gabbai of the local temple was apparently a highly regarded member of the\ncongregation. And then when -- as -- as I approached the Bar Mitzvah -- both my brother and I\nhad Bar Mitzvah and for me that\u2019s -- marked the beginning of a religious period, and I was --\nwas very religious, said all the prayers and did all the right things and so on. That process was s -\n- \u00a7 -- stopped by the war.",
        "Q: What was the Jewish community in Liepaja like? Was it -- was it a large community? Were\nyou involved with it? Did you go to a religious school?",
        "A: No, the community was relatively large, 1t was about 12 percent of the population of town,\nmaybe se -- 7,000 people. I was v -- during my religious phase I certainly went to the temple on\nho -- high holidays and possibly some of the lesser holidays. We also celebrated Succos, for\nexample, and Purim. But I was too young to be involved in the religious life and my father\nsimply wouldn't participate in it.",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to get a sense of if your friends were Jewish, if your friends were mixed, did you\ngo to a public school, and that sort of --",
        "A: I -- the first school I went to was a German school. The -- at that time -- it was 1931, I think,\nthe street signs in Latvia were still in three languages, Latvian, German and Russian and German\nwas still -- a-and both German and Russian were still considered acceptable languages, although\nthe Latvian government emphasi -- tried to emphasize Latvian. We went to a German school,\nand then [indecipherable] I stayed there until spring of \u201932. Hitler had not yet come to power in\nGermany, but it was clearly -- he was on the rise, and there was a perception that anti-Semitism\nwas going to get worse in Germany, and in the German community, so my parents decided to\ntake me out of there. They also decided to put me in a Latvian public school. I understand that\nonly about 10 percent of the Jewish children went to Latvian schools, the others went to -- to na -\n- Jewish schools. I was quite aloof, found it difficult to make friends. I never had more than two\nclose friends. Often they were -- were Latvian, because there were relatively few Jewish children\nin the school and I\u2019m not sure I would have given them preference anyway. But in -- especially\nin -- in high school my -- the last two years that I went to school, my -- my best friend actually\nwas Jewish. I should say something about him, per-perhaps later on.",
        "Q: Did you have a lot of contact with non-Jewish Latvians, your neighbors, or -- I mean, did --",
        "A: Yes, usually I had some Latvian friends and since I had very few friends, they generally were\nthe close friends. So I did have a fair amount of contact with them. The neighbors again, I don\u2019t\nthink we had any Jewish neighbors in the building, or perhaps there were some next door, but I --\nI don\u2019t remember any. So we had contact mainly with -- with Latvians. But my father, of course,\nhad a lot of business contacts with the local Jewish community and my wife -- my -- not my\nwife, my mother had s-some Jewish friends as well as a number of -- of Gentile friends.",
        "Q: Were you aware of anti-Semitism as this point in your life?",
        "A: I\u2019ve sort of been giving myself a push lately to think about it and try to remember it. And the\nworst thing that I can remember happened to me in school, all the years that I went to a Latvian\nschool, is that a few times one of the other boys would f-fold a piece of cloth so it remember --\nresemb -- remem -- sorry, resembled a pig\u2019s ear and sort of pointed it at me as if to taunt me that\nI was a Jew and we were not allowed to -- to eat pork. And that was the worst thing that ever\nhappened to me. I don\u2019t recall ever being called bad names, or getting into fights because I was\nJewish. Children generally are -- tend to be fairly cruel and s-s -- I\u2019m s -- tend to torment\nminorities, but I experienced very little of that. And my general perception was, a-again, in part\ntriggered by Ezergailis\u2019 book, who tries to show that Latvia wasn\u2019t any more anti-Semitic than\nother European countries. Frankly, from all the details I remember, I must give him right. And\none of the anti-Semitic actions I do remember is that my father\u2019s grain mill was nationalized with\ninadequate compensation, and I thought this was of an anti-Jewish act. Ezergailis points out that\nactually a number of non-Jewish businesses were also nationalized, and the intent was not so\nmuch to drive the Jews out of business, because in some branches the Jews were left unmolested.\nIt\u2019s just that the government, which patterned itself Mussolini\u2019s Italy, wanted to sort of nati -- to\nget state ownership of certain branches of business and industry. And if there happened to be\nsome Jewish companies in the way, they were nationalized. And in other areas, where they didn\u2019t\nseem to care at -- at the time, they left the Jews alone.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the Latvian government?",
        "A: The Latvian government, yes, yes, we\u2019re still in this, the pre-war era. So the anti-Semitism\ndefinitely was -- was not bad, and I think another fact is, of course that a number of German\nJewish refugees came to Latvia and established themselves and felt reasonably comfortable.",
        "Q: They came because of Hitler?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay, so you had a fair amount of knowledge about what was going on in Germany --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- prior to his occupation?",
        "A: We were quite well informed. We would regularly listen to -- to the BBC, to German\nbroadcasts and we -- as long as it was possible we subscribed to a Swiss political weekly that wa\n-- called the [indecipherable], which at that time was quite famous for being anti-Nazi, and the\neditor-in-chief was very outspoken and very critical of Hitler and we sort of enjoyed reading his\neditorials just because he would mince no words. And I thought we were quite well informed,\nuntil 19 -- June 1940 when of course the -- the s -- Soviets took over Latvia and cut off the\nsupply of foreign newspapers. We also subscribed to some German magazines. So I think we\nwere well informed, but we heard only a few sporadic reports about atrocities, even after the\noutbreak of the war in Poland, and the famous [indecipherable] Kristallnacht, and of course that\nwas supposed to be in retaliation for the assassination of a German diplomat, and we did hear\nthere were excesses. But we didn\u2019t realize how many killings there had been, we heard about\nproperty damage and so forth. And we thought, well this is sort of an isolated incident, it\u2019s a\nshame that it happened. But somehow we weren\u2019t prepared to change my family\u2019s and many\nother Jew\u2019s perception of ger -- of the Germans being basically fair. Maybe they were very strict\nwith Jews, they were depriving them of some civil rights, but we thought that by and large there\nwas -- you pretty much got what you deserved. We thought that they would be discriminating in\ntheir treatment of -- of Jews, Jews who in their eyes had conducted themselves badly, or had\nharmed German interests would of -- would of course be persecuted, and Jews that had been --\nhad not done so would presumably be judged on their merits. Th-That -- that was the notion we\nhad, and I think there is perhaps another indication of that, that when the w -- the war broke out,\nand Germany attacked Russia, only about a quarter of the Jews from Latvia fled with the\nRussians. In my family, out of 27 people, only two fled. The o -- the others all stayed, which\nmeans they felt that th-the Germans were the lesser evil. So we -- there was just a further factor,\nnamely the Latvian government was trying to keep good relations with both the Soviet Union\nand Nazi Germany, and this means that they purposely suppressed any kind of derogatory,\nunfavorable news about th-the Germans an-and the Russians, so we didn\u2019t learn as much about\nsome of the atrocities were going on in -- say in Poland, a-as we should have. And -- but BBC\nagain didn\u2019t report anything, so we -- we had the impression that there were just some small\nscale atrocities, but nothing major, and sort of isolated. And furthermore, the final solution had\nnot yet started, because there certainly wasn\u2019t -- th-the systematic large scale killing of Jews only\nstarted with the attack on Russia.",
        "Q: You started to mention the Russian occupation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about that, your memories of what happened when the Russians\ncame in, whether there was support for the Russians, whether there was local resistance, and\nwhat -- and how that changed your life.",
        "A: Well, the first encounter with the Russians came on October \u201939, when under the Molotov-\nRibbentrop Pact, they demanded military bases from the Latvian government, including a large\nbase in my hometown, which had been the principle naval port of the Tsarist empire. In fact, the\nRussian navy that -- th-the fleet that sailed around -- halfway around the world to fight the\nJapanese in the Russian Japanese war of 1904 started in Libau. So, they had a large -- established\na large Russian garrison in -- in Libau and the town was full of Russian soldiers, and in the f -- as\na kid, at first it\u2019s a little exciting to see all these strange uniforms and so on, but we soon learned\nthat these were really quite unwelcome people. The population I -- I had a summer job at the\ntime and -- at a carpenter\u2019s shop, and some of the workers were rather pleased, they were --\nLibau was a somewhat leftist town and the workers, well [indecipherable] sort of glad that they\nnow the -- the workers are going to own everything, and the government will -- will take from\nthe rich and give to the poor and so forth. So a number of them were sympathetic. I met some of\nthese same workers months later and they were furious because they realized that all these\npromises had been broken with -- they were -- for example, there were signs up in the streetcars,\njust, the streetcars now belong to you. Well hell, you still had to pay. And all -- all the other\nthings, practically everything in the economy had changed for the worse and all these promises\nsimply had not been delivered. And a large part of the reason for that was that Latvia was part of\nEurope and had a much higher living standard than Russia. And so when it was annexed to -- to\nRussia, they had to level everything. And the way they did it is they raised prices to s -- to Soviet\nlevels and they raised -- which in some cases was 10 to 30 fold, and they raised wages maybe\ndouble or so, but in -- in -- the net effect was still that the purchasing power, it was very much\nless. And in turns -- for the Russian soldiers this was still paradise. They would sort of --\ncrowded the shops and buy everything they c -- they saw for their rubles. So the disenchantment\nset in very quickly with many people, but there still was a hard core of Latvians, and I wou --\nmust -- must say also, a number of Jews who in the past had leftist political sympathies, either\nsocial democrats, who were, of course, banned at the time, or -- and were the enemies of both the\nLatvian government and the communists, or communists. Those people were glad they s -- their\nexcuse was well maybe things are not working perfectly, cause we\u2019re building a New World\norder and -- and creating a new type of man, Soviet man and everything is going to be alright and\nit\u2019s going to be much better than you could ever dream of. So these people were still true\nbelievers, but a lot of people were disenchanted. And certainly we were, because we were the\nbourgeois, as they would call them, we were s-suddenly the enemies of -- class enemies. The\nRussians expropriated my father\u2019s business. He was a-allowed to keep his debts, but he -- all the\nassets were taken away from him. And in general there were lots of restrictions. For instance,\nthey decreed that every person was entitled to only nine square meters of living space, with some\nsort of allowances for -- which means most people had to -- to sublet -- to rent rooms to their\napartments. And there were some allowances made if -- if you rented or -- a room that was\naccessible only through another room, then this other room didn\u2019t count fully, you could still\nkeep that because you lost your privacy, your roomer would always walk through that other\nroom. So we were forced to rent our -- a couple of rooms in our apartment. And as it turned out\nth -- these were two people from the border guards, which was a branch of the Russian security\napparatus that was not identical to but closely allied to the KGB, and they were later involved in\ndeportation. One of the men was -- was actually a Jew, Kleinman, and he moved out after\nawhile. And the other one was a -- an ethnic Russian from -- from Latvia. Sort of a young, rather\ninnocuous looking man who sort of rent the apartment, and was just w-wearing civilian clothes\nand then one day instead of opening the door with his key, about a month or two later he rang the\ndoorbell, and my mother opened the door and she saw this large man in a Russian major\u2019s\nuniform and at first she didn\u2019t recognize him, she was scared. He was proudly showing off his\nnew uniform. Well, he is actually the man who saved us from deportation to Russia. What\nhappened is that a week before the outbreak of the German Russian war, the Russians went to a\nnumber of homes in the middle of the night, sort of got the people out of bed, told them get\ndressed, pack your -- your bags, and come with us, get on the truck. And the next morning we\nfound out that a lot of wealthy families, including a fair number of Jews had been deported. And\nso we thought, well, by class and so on, by our status, we were very likely to be included, and\nbefore long there was a phone call saying don\u2019t leave the house, pack your bags and wait, we\u2019 ll\ncome for you. So we -- we packed, we did as we were told, and of course we weren\u2019t at all happy\nabout the prospect, and then we realized that our roomer had not come home that night, he was\nout rounding up people, he was one of the leaders in this aktion. So when he finally came home,\nmy mother went to see him and asked if he could take us off the list. And he sort of joked and\nteased first, well don\u2019t you want to go to a sa -- to a great s -- Socialist Motherland, or whatever\nhe called it, and my mother answered diplomatically, well it\u2019s interesting [indecipherable] we\u2019re\nquite happy here, we\u2019d rather stay here. And so he did manage to take us off the list and so for\nthe moment we were saved. But this, of course, this event, this mass deportation is what -- as the\nGermans subsequently exploited a lot to arouse population against the Jews, but I presume we\u2019 ll\ncome to that a little later.",
        "Q: So during the Russian occupation, economic -- economically, it was disastrous.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What about were you able to continue school, religious practices, wha -- did any of that\nchange?",
        "A: At my level religious practices were not affected. I don\u2019t know whether any pressure was put\non the Jewish congregations, but I wasn\u2019t aware of it. School, I was still allowed to stay, but\ncertainly I was of -- invisibly marked in the eyes of my fellow students, I was a bourgeois. And\nw-we -- I had a compulsory political education class, and of course there were tirades against the\nbourgeoisie, Marxism, Leninism, all this garbage. But this didn\u2019t really affect the way my fellow\nclassmates treated me. They sensed that -- well, they were for the most part unhappy with the\nRussians. We had one real communist in class, and the others were unhappy to varying degrees,\nand they realized that I was unhappy too, so we -- we made common cause, there was no tension,\nthey didn\u2019t hold me responsible as a Jew f-for the communist occupation and so on. It -- it didn\u2019t\nreally affect me.",
        "Q: How long did this last?",
        "A: Almost exactly one year. They marched into -- in Latvia fanned out from there and crossed\nthe border in June of 1940, and then 1 -- 1 -- a year later almost to the day came these deportations\nand another week later the Germans attacked. M-Maybe I sh -- I should mention a little bit about\nthese -- these days. I ha-had a summer job in the city construction office, a-and on -- one day\nbefore the German attack, I-I was working on some project, and I was told the morning by my\nboss, stop whatever you\u2019re doing, we have something very urgent and -- and I and some of the\nother apprentices who were working there, were -- were told then to run off as many copies as\nwe could of some drawings for sort of air raid shelters, that were actually really trenches, very\nprimitive, like the fallout shelters that were built in the U.S.. And a-all day there was a sort of\nhustle and bustle with people coming and going and picking up copies. So apparently -- I\nrealized the next morning when the -- we heard about the attacks on -- on the radio, I realized\nwhy I was made to work late that day and why we suddenly worked on these air raid shelter\nplans. That apparently the Russian sort of military leadership had gotten wind of the German\nattack because the Germans had, after all, massed three and a half million troops along the\nborder, and there were a number of -- even some German deserters who crossed into Russia and\nwarned them of the attack and they\u2019d been warned from other sides. Stalin didn\u2019t want to believe\nany of this. His -- but his generals [indecipherable] tried to see him a week before the attack and\nwarn him, they decided to go ahead on their own and -- and do -- make at least minimum\npreparations without telling him. But still, they were totally surprised. And then when -- when\nthe war started [indecipherable] we were really elated, we heard on the radio that Germany had\nattacked Russia, we felt this was the lesser evil. We certainly had not sympathized with the\nGermans when it -- 1-1n their war against the west. There we certainly preferred the western\nallies, but we really disliked the Soviet regime intensely, not only because they had nationalized\nmy father\u2019s business, but also because of the terror, th-the lies, the hypocrisy, the deceit. And I\nshould say a word about the terror. One of the things that happened is they took over some of the\nbiggest buildings in town as their police headquarters. Police, KGB, whatever. One of the first\nthings that happened is the windows on -- on the basement level windows were bricked in. These\na-afterwards became torture chambers and execution chambers and we suspected so much right\naway. And previously the Latvian police didn\u2019t engage in torture, they didn\u2019t have any need for\nthis, and it just looked suspicious that suddenly the basement windows were -- were sealed off.\nSo there were a number of things. One heard rumors from time to time about people\ndisappearing, and of course these -- these rumors then very soon became reality during these\nmass deportations the week before the start of the war.",
        "Q: \u2019'm going to stop you here.",
        "A: Mm-hm. [tape break]",
        "Q: Would you continue?",
        "A: Okay. I understand that according to German plans they were supposed to -- to occupy my\nhometown the second day of the war because it was only 70 kilometers away from the German\nborder. It actually took them a week, and there was considerably more resistance than they\nexpected, both from -- from German troops, and then apparently from Latvian volunteers. As I\nsaid, Libau was a rather pink town, and a number of the workers and communist youth and so on\ngot weapons and they tried to defend the city. So as a result we got considerably more bombing\nand shelling than we normally would have had, and especially the last night, there was almost\nnonstop bombing and a-artillery bombardment and in particular was rather heavy artillery\ncoming from the sea. And so the center of town was pretty much in ruins, burned down. The\nstandard lie that was s-spread immediately after th-the German occupation is the Jews burned\ndown the town. They say -- they claimed in every city. In my hometown I can very definitely say\nthis was a -- a -- a totally untenable lie because the buildings that had burned down were -- were\nvery badly damaged. They were -- had been hit by bombs and by artillery shells, the walls had\ncollapsed and so on. A burned out building normally is burned out, it\u2019s blackened by soot,\neverything combustible is gone, the roof may be gone, but the walls are still standing. So this\nwas in -- in the case of Libau this was demonstrably a lie. Then the f-first few days with German\noccupation [indecipherable] nothing much happened, but the real jolt came, I think on July 5\",\nwhen suddenly there appeared signs of -- notices everywhere on the walls, regulations for Jews,\nand there were a list of eight or nine things that Jews were supposed to do or not to do. I mean,\nobvious ones like turning in weapons, not so obvious ones as turning in all means of\ntransportation, including bicycles. Then th -- they were not -- they were supposed to | -- to lee --\nto step from the sidewalk in the gutter whenever they saw a German soldier approaching, have to\n-- to -- to pay their respect. They were allowed to leave their houses only a couple of hours in the\nmorning, couple hours in the afternoon, they were supposed to shop only two hours in -- in the\nmorning. The men were -- were supposed to report to work at seven a.m. 1n -- every morning,\nand so on. It looked Draconian but not disastrous. We had sort of expected we\u2019d lose some of our\ncivil rights, but certainly we had not expected any danger to our li-lives. And so re-re-reading\nthese -- the -- these regulations I\u2019ve -- recently I felt that they weren't all that threatening. They\nwere Draconian, but they were not threatening, yet my father was quite concerned, and in\nretrospect I -- I think what -- what happened is the following. A few days after the Germans\nmarched in, there was a massacre of some 200 to 300 Jews in one of the parks, in my hometown.\nI had not known about this until about two months ago when I read about it in Ezergailis\u2019s book.\nThis was -- in that park some trenches had been dug, presumably the -- the Russian and Latvian\ndefenders expected to fight s -- s -- s -- block by block, so to speak. And German army units --\nthe SD had not yet established itself -- well, apparently killed several hundred Jews and just\ndumped the corpses in these trenches. Allegedly the Jews were afterwards allowed to remove the\nbodies and bury them in the Jewish cemetery, which was [indecipherable] exception. I strongly\nsuspect that my father had heard about this and that\u2019s why he was so worried, because these\nregulations at work and so on and not using the sidewalk weren\u2019t all that bad. And so he\nsummoned us and said, things look grim, and I have the following suggestion. And he said, why\ndon\u2019t we claim that my mother 1s not the biological child of her parents, but that she\u2019s an Aryan\nfoundling. Sh-She w-was f-found on the doorstep of her -- her parents in a little basket, with a\nnote saying Erika, and then a cross, implying that she is baptized. And Erika was a very German\nname, so it was implied that she was a German child. And that would make my brother and me\nhalf Jews, and as such on-only second class citizens rather than total outcasts. And it -- it -- it left\nno escape hatch for my father, unfortunately, but th-the hope was that perhaps we could send --\nhe could go off to a farm, work for a farmer in som-some lonely place, and then sort of wait until\nthe war was over. Because we had naively assumed that the war would be over within a matter of\nmonths, since it was only a matter of playing for time.",
        "Q: I want to ask you a couple questions here. First, it was alw -- it\u2019s been my understanding that\na half Jew under Nazi racial theory, is a Jew. Why did you think that this would give you a\ndifferent kind of status?",
        "A: In 1935 the Germans passed the so-called Nuremberg laws, where they defined the status of\nwhat they called mischlinga, or racially mixed people. And the -- the first level was half Jews,\nthey were deprived of a number of civil rights, but they were still a lev -- a notch or so above\nJews. And quarter Jews, again they were banned from certain things, like government jobs and\nso forth. But -- and anything beyond that was -- was not so bad. I-It -- they -- their -- the -- the\nrule was that you had to prove that all four of your grandparents were Aryan. For a quarter Jew,\none grandparent was Jewish, for a half Jew, two grandparents were Jewish. They were --",
        "Q: In 1941, this mattered?",
        "A: We -- th-that was still the law. Of course, th-they could reinterpret the law and change it\nwithout telling us, but up to that time we knew that half Jews still were not as ca -- mi -- were not\nset equal to Jews. And so we thought that this -- this was about as far as we dared go. There --\nthere were all sorts of supplementary laws that -- that were Byzantine in their complexity. For\ninstance, there was some rule that half Jews normally could not hold government jobs unless\nthey had held these jobs before August 1\u2018, 1914. Which means these were old time civil servants\nfrom way back, or the exceptions were made if they had fought in World War I, and been\ndecorated, and so on. So there were -- even among half Jews there were different levels. And\nmind you, until that time there had been no sort of program o-of mass killing of Jews, and\ntherefore there didn\u2019t seem to be any -- any problem with half Jews. We certainly knew that they\nwould not be treated as badly. And this was about as far as -- as my father dared to go. My best\nfriend at that time in school, who was Edward -- no, George Specter, who was a -- his parents\nwere German Jewish refugees, had come to Latvia, and they also had two sons George and\nEdward, only the age relationship was reversed. They played pretty much the same game, they\nclaimed that their mother was Russian, not Jewish, and there was a grain of truth to it, I think she\nhad a Russian grandmother, and -- but all the other grandpa -- grandparents were Jewish. So she\nclaimed she was Russian, made her Gentile children were half Jews. And for awhile that was\nokay, but then they somehow felt sorry for the father, who was lef-left out in the cold, and they\ndecided to try something new, and found an old woman who supposedly had worked as a cook in\ntheir household and she then claimed in a affidavit that the f -- the father was really an\nillegitimate child of hers, and since she was Aryan, that\u2019d make the father half Jew and then\nmove everybody else up a notch. And that was too much for the Germans. They didn\u2019t believe it\nand they f-found a -- a pretext, I believe the -- the youngest son had made some change in the\nfather\u2019s passport, and that was document forgery, they arrested him, they arrested the family and\nof course they were all killed immediately. So what -- first of all one had -- could only go so far,\nif you s -- the story became too implausible, then you lost the whole game. And the -- the other\nthing was -- was that we didn\u2019t realize yet that not all Gentiles were equal in -- in the eyes of the\nGermans. The Germans were the highest of the hierarchy, they didn\u2019t want to shed any German\nblood, even if it was only 50 percent, but R-Russians were only one level above Jews, and so\nthey didn't much care for those. Is this about the time to flip the tape, or shall -- shall I go on?\nYeah, so my mother quickly found a farmer who would t-take my father as an unpaid f-farmhand\nand so he went out in the countryside, and we just av -- sort of waited for -- for the war to end.\nAnd then, very soon, since we did not wear the yellow patch, of course we -- I th -- I think we\nmay have been stopped by the police and we told them that we are half Jews, and they said, oh if\n-- if -- if you had -- if that\u2019s your excuse, you have to have it -- you have to go and clear that with\nthe German SD, the Sicherheitsdienst. And the commander of that was Untersturmfuehrer\nKugler, a f-fairly notorious man later, as it turned out. So my mother and my older brother went\nto see him. And my mother was a very attractive woman and a good actress and sh-she told her\nstory with -- with great conviction and apparently impressed him so much that he promptly\ndictated some special passes for us at -- a-ag-against the -- the -- the German E-Erika\nAlperovich, and her sons, half Jews George and Edward Alperovich, a -- the regulations\nconcerning Jews shall not be applied. And while this was being typed, he sort of grunted, th-the\nJews always got the best German woman. Well, my mother sort of returned the compliment by\nwhen she left she raised her -- her -- her arm and said, heil Hitler. So she had fooled him. And we\nthought, great, well now we have these passes, they -- there was no time limit on them, there\nwere no conditions attached to it, we thought, well we\u2019re home free, so all we have to worry\nabout is my father. Is this the time to -- to switch, or we still -- we still go?",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: Yeah. Okay, so there were a number of cases where we were -- were sort of -- anti-Semites\nreported us to the police and say here are some Jews that are not wearing the yellow patches, and\nwe\u2019re summoned to the police and we showed our passes. And of course the -- the Germans were\nmuch higher 1-in the hierarchy than the Latvians. The Latvians pretty well had to do what the\nGermans told them, and we had this official document with a s-stamp of the SD, and so they let\nus go free. It was still unpleasant for my mother because a lot of people in town knew her. It was\nan absolutely crazy story for us to start, it was extremely audacious. She had her -- her parents,\nof course, lived in town all their lives, there were lots of people who knew them. She had two\nolder sisters that conveniently died in the 1930\u2019s and there were a number of people who knew\nthat the three sisters looked pretty much alike, and so realized that she was the natural child of\nher parents. We\u2019re still -- and there was one woman in town who had given birth to a -- a child\nthe same day that my mother was born, and in the same hospital. So here were these two women,\nmy maternal grandmother and this other woman, both giving birth to a child, in same maternity\nward, knowing of each other. So if tha -- that woman had known exactly what story we told the\nGermans, which most of them didn\u2019t know, th-they knew for some reason we are -- we are\nimmune, she could very easily have refuted and that she knows my mother was the natural child.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Edward Anders on February 28\", 1997.",
        "A: So, as I mentioned, it was a very audacious plan and we -- if we had any inkling that the war\nwas going to last another four years, we never would have tried this plan, because this is a -- a lie\nthat simply couldn\u2019t go on for four years. We were just playing for time. Well, 1t worked all\nright. The -- I didn\u2019t lose my summer job, they kept me there, although I was half Jew, somewhat\nquestionable whether I was employable or not, neither did my -- my brother. But at the end of the\nsummer both of us, of course, had to quit our summer jobs and we tr -- and we had to earn some\nmoney because my father no longer had an income. And turned out nobody would hire us. The\nstatus of half Jews was somewhat indeterminate and most people just didn\u2019t want to -- to touch\nus. Also, the Germans, of course, were trying to -- to get control over the population, find out\nwho the Jews were, so periodically people had to go to the police and re-register their passports,\nget another stamp and so forth. My mother -- this was in late September \u201941, my mother went to\nthe police office, and the Latvian police official treated her with utmost respect and sort of said\nin almost so many words that he has high regard for her family, he\u2019s not going to do anything\nagainst her, and she\u2019s just going to renew her passport and no questions asked, which was\nanother example that -- of some decent Latvians. There also were enough of the other kind. So,\nthings seemed to be going along fine. We con-continued to look for w -- for -- for jobs, without\nsuccess. My mother gave some private lessons to various people who wanted to learn German.\nMost of her pupils were serious. There was one rather peculiar young woman, who was\ninterested only in the sp -- the specialized vocabulary, such as undress and underwear and so on.\nSo anyway my -- my mother taught her whatever she wanted to know or needed to know for her\nprofession, and didn\u2019t matter, she paid. Then in November, at -- at my -- the -- at the end of\nOctober, the -- this was -- was after harvest time, the farmer decided he no longer needed my\nfather and so sent him home. My -- by then we had also realized very quickly what was ha -- ha -\n- happening to -- to the Jews that were ar-arrested. I forgot to mention that within a few days of\nthe German occupation, once the Jews were marked with their yellow patches, that army trucks\nwould cruise around the town and when they saw a Jew, they would stop, check to see his papers\nand then put him on the truck, and he was never seen again. Or, they would come to Jewish\nhomes and again, round up the men, take them away, never seen again. And within a very few\ndays there were rumors in town what had happened to them. Some people had actually seen that\nthey were just taken to the dunes behind the fisherman\u2019s wh-wharf, and were shot. Later they\nfound -- the Germans found some -- an execution site farther aw-away in the restricted naval port\narea and so on, where there weren\u2019t as many witnesses.",
        "Q: Did you learn this at the time?",
        "A: Yes, I knew it within a couple weeks or so. And th -- ma -- I -- I heard this from one of our\nneighbors who obviously was -- felt terribly sorry for the Jews, and he was telling us mainly to\nwarn us. I mean, he -- I don\u2019t know whether he had seen himself, whether he had heard it, but it\nwas common knowledge in town within a matter of days.",
        "Q: When you were walking down the street, did you see any violence or brutality?",
        "A: No, never saw any violence. I did see some Jews put on the truck, and I later, after the war, I\nwas supposed to testify at the Nuremberg Trials of the German high command, because I\nremembered the license plates of those trucks. I knew that they had German army insignia and\nnavy. And that -- after the war, of course, was fashionable to blame everything on the SS, but the\narmy and the navy were involved. And then one day, standing at the streetcar stop, a -- a German\nsailor stood there and s-struck up a conversation, and of course he enjoyed it because I spoke\nfluent German. And he said, \u201cOh you have a lot of Jews in your town.\u201d I said yes. Oh, then he\nsaid, we have -- and then he made a movement of this trigger finger, pulling it several times. We\nhave blank blank a number of them. In other words, executed. Now, he was speaking as a\nGerman sailjer -- sailor, I\u2019m not -- one can\u2019t be absolutely certain by we he -- he meant w-we the\nnavy, or we the army, or other and -- and the SS, but I think there is evidence that at least the\nearly killings were -- were done with considerable involvement, if not exclusively by -- by the\narmy.",
        "Q: When -- when this sailor said this to you, what was your personal reaction?",
        "A: Well, I mean, you just show a poker face, what can you do? I mean, it would be dis-disastrous\nif you made a long face and then sounded -- a-and -- and acted as if this were a -- a real shock to\nyou.",
        "Q: But did it scare you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think scare is q -- is quite the word because it may not have been quite the first such --\nsu-such news that I got. Even if it was, when you hear about something\u2019s happening to others,\nespecially when you\u2019re a teenager, you think it can never happen to you. Drunk driving for\nexample, or getting cancer from smoking. Teenagers think they\u2019re immortal. And that time we\nknew that while there -- some number of Jews were killed, well th -- let\u2019s hope it -- maybe\ntheyll stop the killing. Maybe this was done just in the excess of the first few days of -- of the\noccupation or what. But in reality of course, there was lots of reason to worry, and some of our\nrelatives disappeared, and -- and th-the pattern that developed in -- in my hometown was that --\nI-I have -- course during -- at the time, I didn\u2019t have access to accurate statistics, but In -- I now\nhave seen some of the numbers and every week or two there were 50 or 100 Jews executed. They\nwere rounded up in the streets. One of my older relatives, a woman, was picked up when she was\nstanding in line at the only grocery store where Jews were still allowed to shop. And that was a\nconvenient place if they wanted to harvest some Jews, they just send a truck over there, take the\npeople standing in line, they won\u2019t need the groceries anyway. And so it happened on the -- in --\nin a trickle, so to speak. My maternal grandfather was arrested on Rosh Hashonah, which was the\nSeptember 22\". He was 83, and he was a rather defiant man who decided since the temple was\nrazed and he couldn\u2019t go to the -- to the temple, that he was going to stand at the window of his\napartment with his tallis and pray. Of course, it was a provocation. Police saw him at the\nwindow, picked him up, took him away, Presumably they ki -- that -- checked the town rather\ncarefully that day to see if there weren\u2019t any other Jews that were practicing their religion. And I\nthink there were 61 or so shot that day, he was one of them. Then there -- also the -- they -- the-\nthese synagogues were torn down. None of them had been destroyed or set on fire by either the\npopulation or as in some other cities, by the SD, but they were just torn down, brick by brick.\nAnd then they of course took the s -- the scrolls, the Torah scrolls -- and I didn\u2019t see this myself,\nbut I heard reports that they unrolled them in one of the squares of town and then forced some\nJews to step on them, to -- to -- to march on them. And the same person who told me this said\nthat the German soldier came along and he was careful not to step on it, he took a big step across\nand said, \u201cTh-that\u2019s -- that\u2019s Holy Scripture.\u201d So there were certainly a lot of warnings things\nwere infinitely worse than we had expected, and we -- we didn\u2019t realize at the time that this was -\n- or perhaps we did, this was a total change in policy, that\u2019s [indecipherable] the -- now that the\nGermans had entered the Soviet Union, they were going to kill Jews systematically. Now there\u2019s\nalso something about human psychology. Although ther -- there were lots of detailed rumors\ncirculating in town about the executions of Jews, there were quite a number of Jews who didn\u2019t\nbelieve it. There was -- people grasp at straws in such situations. There were occasional rumors\nthat somebody had traveled along a country road, and he had passed a huge camp with lots of\nJews working there. What they were doing, so on, is pure invention. Railroad traffic was still\ndisrupted, so it -- there wasn\u2019t much traffic from one city to another, and there was a report by\nthe occasional traveler, yes, he had seen such a camp, how reassuring. And yet, the truth was\neasy enough to find out, it\u2019s just a question of how much wishful thinking you want to engage in.\nWell, anyway, one day in the -- after my -- when my father was at -- returned from his farm, he\nrealized that according to th-th-the law, he was supposed to register with the labor office,\nvolunteer for -- or show up for work at s-seven a.m., but by then it was quite obvious what was\nhappening to men, especially, and so it would be suicide. And then the alternative then was to try\nto hide somewhere. So we decided to hide him in a s -- s-small sort of store -- storage room next\nto our kitchen, it -- really a little pantry. We put up a stack of f-firewood, and there -- there was\nenough space be-behind the firewood for him to hide, and we strategically placed some -- so-\nsome stools and so on there so that it -- when the doorbell rang, the idea was for him to climb up\nover the stack and hide behind it, and only then open the door. And one day we weren\u2019t sure\nwhether the doorbell had rung or not, m-my mother thought it had, and I thought it hadn\u2019t. I\u2019m\nnot sure what my brother said. So my father didn\u2019t go in his hiding place, he hadn\u2019t heard it\neither, and just then my mo-mother opened the door and there was a Latvian policeman and he\nsaid, I am looking for Adolf -- Adolf Alperovich, your husband. My mother realized of course 1s\nthat we were in real hot water. And of course my f-father had immediately heard his voice. His\nretreat to his hiding place was cut off, so all he could do is -- he wa -- he was in the bedroom at\nthe time, so he sort of climbed into the wardrobe and hid behind clothes. And meanwhile the\npoliceman had entered the apartment, was standing in the kitchen and questioning my mother\nand -- yeah, questioning my mother, and she -- and meanwhile my father was trying to hide and\nwas making some noise. And realizing that this was very suspicious, my mother decided to\nthrow a sort of quasi-hysterical fit. Said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where my husband is. You -- you people\ntook him away. Tell me where my husband is!\u201d And grabbed his wrist and began to shake him,\nand of course the policeman got quite uncomfortable and uneasy and with her shouting and so\non, she masked some of the noises in the bedroom, and of course we -- we all could hear them,\nand I don\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t get suspicious of -- he was sufficiently flustered, when he\nsearched the apartment he didn\u2019t happen to look in the wardrobe. Well, we thought, managed to\nsurvive this, we\u2019ll be a lot more careful in the future. But what we didn\u2019t realize is that there\nwere two people in the building who had reported what -- that my father was hiding in the\napartment. One of them was the janitor, who was often in the basement tending to the boiler, we\nhad a sort of ground floor apartment. And then the other one was a woman next door, and she\ncould probably hear my father\u2019s voice through the wall, the c-common wall between the two\napartments. And so they must have reported that my father 1s still there, he had a lower voice\nthan -- than my brother and I, and they could probably hear it. So I was -- second of December\n\"41, I was out looking for work without success and came home and as I opened the door I heard\nthe crashing of firewood, and I heard a -- a German -- shouting in German, as -- at my father,\nlike something I couldn\u2019t quite understand, then heard my father reply, \u201cI am not a criminal.\u201d\nAnd these were the last words of my father that I heard. What happened 1s that this time 10\npolicemen, led by a German had come to the apartment, including the man who had searched for\nmy father before and not found him. And they checked the whole apartment as thoroughly as\nthey could and they were about to leave, and then the policeman, whose name was Sproigis,\ndecided to look behind the firewood. The -- he is the one who had searched before and not found\nmy father, and naturally found him. So they took him and my mother away, they left me and I\njust thought I probably won\u2019t see my parents again. My brother had found a job. He came home\nat night, I told him the bad news. Then, I think it was either that day or the next, the German\npoliceman came back, escorted by Latvian, and was -- was very friendly and said, \u201cWell, we just\nwant to look around the apartment a little bit.\u201d And then he went, sort of looked the books, oh\n[indecipherable] novels and such things, not too interesting. Then he spotted the radio and said,\n\u201cTo whom did this radio belong, to your father, or to your mother?\u201d And I said, \u201cActually to\nneither, it belongs to a former roomer.\u201d This was, of course, a -- an ext -- a lie. We Jews were\nsupposed to turn in the radios, among other things. And he said, \u201cWell, how long ago since he\nwas here?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201che wa -- he was here in -- still in June.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is\nDecember. Isn\u2019t it strange that you haven\u2019t her -- heard from him all this time? I\u2019Il take the radio\nalong, and if you -- this roomer shows up, tell him it\u2019s at the security police.\u201d And so he told the\nLatvian flunky who was with him to pick up the radio, it was a big, heavy model, and off he\nwent. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your parents, they\u2019Il be home soon.\u201d Well, half of what he\nsaid was true, my mother was released the evening of the -- the eighth of December, and sh-she\nhad signed some waiver that she was never going to tell anybody what happened to her 1-in jail\nand so on. But she realized that my father was in very serious danger. And so the next morning\nshe dashed off to the police, the German police and asked them, I mean -- or tried to plead for\nmy father\u2019s life, and they said it\u2019s too late, he was shot that morning. She claimed actually she\nhad -- that on her way she had sort of approached the jail and she saw a truck parked there and\nshe saw several people getting on the truck and she thought she recognized my father from a\ndistance. So, he was shot on the ninth of December. And of course we were pretty shocked, but\nwhat -- what can you do, this had happened to a lot of people, now it happened to us, but at least\nwe were still alive and we are still protected by these passes. Well that extra protection lasted\nexactly six days. Four o\u2019clock in the morning on December 15\", I su-suddenly woke up, the light\nhad gone on in my bedroom and I opened my eyes and I saw two Latvian policeman s-stand\nthere -- st-standing there with rifles over their shoulders and is -- told my brother and me, get\ndressed, come with us. So what\u2019s -- what\u2019s the matter? Well, we produced our passes, showing\nthat we are half Jews and they -- nothing -- that they should not -- we -- we were exempt from all\nthe r-rules about Jews. They asked for my father and my -- my mother said that -- she had let the\npolice in, they had been -- they had rung the doorbell, and they -- they searched the apartment for\nhim, she told them that he had been arrested two weeks earlier. Well, he was still on their list and\nthen they -- they checked everywhere. [indecipherable] and when the finished searching the\napartment they opened the back door and there was a policeman standing behind that, cut off any\nescape. So we asked them, where are you taking us? And they said, we can\u2019t tell you. And the na\n-- older policeman who had -- had a bit -- a touch of humanity left said, \u201cAll I can tell you is,\ndress warmly.\u201d So we dressed warmly and went with them, and we kept protesting. They\nmarched us down a block or two and we protested that you have no right to arrest us, we\u2019re\nexempt from an -- any actions against Jews. And that -- they stopped at a building about two or\nthree blocks from -- from ours, and this is where our great-aunt lived, and she was actually the\ndearest of our relatives. And a few of the policemen went in, and we saw the lights go on in one\napartment, in the second apartment they had roused some Jewish families, tell them to get\ndressed. Meanwhile, th-the other police stayed outside, we had our faces to the wall, we were\nbeing guarded. And we had been arguing with them. So one young policeman was -- became\nabsolutely livid with this insubordination. And so he went to his superior sergeant, whatever, and\nasked for permission to shoot us on the spot. And we couldn\u2019t hear the answer of the policeman,\nbut anyway, he didn\u2019t shoot. I -- in Riga at the time, they actually killed -- out of 24,000 Jews\nthat were taken to the execution, they killed about a thousand o-on the way, for not walking fast\nenough, for trying to escape, for talking back, for any number of things. And Libau for some\nreason, they did not want to -- to have corpses lying on the street, I presume. Maybe they did --\nhad orders not to do this, and frankly the logical answer would have been, what do you care, you\nknow, a few hours later they\u2019ll be dead anyway. So we slowly worked our way toward th-the jail,\nstopping every block or so to round up another Jewish family. In one building a woman came out\nwith her two children and then few minutes later she said, \u201cOh, I forgot -- I forgot to take your\nfather\u2019s picture.\u201d The poor woman thought that they were going to be deported and it would --\nwould be nice to have the father\u2019s picture as a souvenir. Of course, they were all going to be\nkilled. We knew it, but -- and our great-aunt knew it and she -- she just looked very composed,\npretended not to recognize us, but she knew where it was headed. So the rest of us then -- all of\nus then slowly worked our way toward the prison. After -- as we approached the prison we could\nsee there were similar processions coming from other side streets, always escorted by Latvian\npolice, and we\u2019re admitted int -- into the prison yard. We were one of the last groups to -- to\narrive. It was still dark, it was around seven a.m. or a little before. They -- there was a German\npoliceman reading out lists and he had reached the letter K, I still remember, he was reading the\nname Katzenelinbogin, so we -- we were -- our ni -- name began with A, so our -- we had been\ncalled quite awhile ago. And since we were some of the last to enter, were near the gate, faces to\nthe wall, the Latvian gatekeeper sort of snuck up to us and said, \u201cHey fellows, do you have any\nwatches, or any jewelry with you? Your -- you\u2019re all going to be taken to -- to Germany, and\nthere they\u2019 Il take them away from you. Isn\u2019t it better to leave them with your fellow\ncountrymen?\u201d Anyway, we held onto our watches, didn't give him anything. And then f -- a few\nminutes later was -- was a commotion and we saw that my m -- my mother had managed to\nsneak into the prison yard with another group of Jews. She had first tried to join our group and\nthey wouldn\u2019t take her, she was not on the list. And so, now since they -- or they knew who she\nwas, she tried joining another group, but she was recognized, she was pushed out of the prison.\nAnd then, another couple minutes later, a German policeman appeared, approached us, and with\ntwo or three of the Latvian police in tow who had been -- who had arrested us. And he -- he a --\nso he asked, what\u2019s your story? And so we showed him our passes and told him. And so he\nstared at us for about 10 seconds and then suddenly he motioned, go. Now, probably didn\u2019t hurt,\nall of us were blonde and -- and blue-eyed and didn\u2019t [indecipherable] hurt that some of my\nblonde hair was sticking out from under my cap and so I looked sufficiently Aryan, my brother\ndid too. Told us, g-go. Barely got out on the street, we almost bumped into my mother. She had,\nhaving been kicked out of the prison, she had rushed over -- well, she had previously, she had ru-\nrushed over to the German police, managed to see some -- somebody\u2019s -- some official, I don\u2019t\nknow how high ranking he was, if he was not the top man, and said look what\u2019s happened, my --\nmy sons are half Jews, they\u2019re not supposed to be arrested, and they have been t-taken and can\nyou get them out. And the man was sympathetic, but then he said, what time were they picked\nup? And she said four o\u2019clock. He looked at the watch, it was seven. Sorry, he said, it\u2019s too late.\nWell, they had no walkie-talkies in those days and it was about a three or four hour march to the\nexecution site, so in principle we would have been, if everything had moved as quickly as he\nthought, we would have been on our way by then, and they couldn\u2019t very easily send a car after\nus. But we weren\u2019t, things were moving more slowly. So she thought that if we were dead, then\nshe certainly didn\u2019t want to live and so her only thought was to get back in the prison, join one of\nthe other groups of Jews, and just be killed with everybody else. And so suddenly she saw us\ncoming. And during all this to-do, as well, during the arrest and the arguments with the police\nand so on, we were absolutely calm. I think our mood can best be described as of re-restrained\nindignation. We were indignant but not to the point of -- of shouting or raising our voices, or th-\nthrowing a fit. But now all of a sudden we began to shake, and -- anyway, the shakes lasted for\nawhile. We walked home, by the time we got home they were over. My brother had to go to\nwork that -- that day, showed up about an hour late, and I\u2019m not sure what excuse h-he gave.\nAnd so we realized we had survived it. Later that day I saw -- in town, I saw a group of Jews\nbeing marched across the bridge north of the city to -- to the execution site. And it\u2019s a ver -- a sad\nsight to realize that here are these people, we had all been arrested together, I got out, but they\ndidn\u2019t. And two months ago I learned in graphic detail what would have happened to me if the\npoliceman had not said go, if he had said stay instead. And Ezergailis in his book has an accurate\ndescription based on court depositions by some of the Latvian henchman on just how the\nexecutions were carried out. And it\u2019s weird when after 55 years, when your life, you had reached\na crossroads and you took a turn to the right and your life had evolved in a well known way and\nyou were still alive, and you suddenly sort of get a flashback where you were at this crossroads\n55 years ago and you suddenly realize in great detail what would have happened to you if you\nhad gone -- taken the left fork instead of the right fork. Yeah, so it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know if anybody\nelse survived. There -- I think there was one Jew who had working papers, I think he would --\nalso had been rounded up, not in our troop, but I happened to notice there was another troop and\nhe produced some paper. Jews in those days who had special skills, and it\u2019s very important to the\nGermans, were spared, at least for the time being. That included craftsmen. One of the wonderful\noddities of the German SD in our town is -- was the German SD was in a building separate from\nthat of the Latvian SD, and the Latvians were not supposed to go anywhere except the ground\nfloor of the building. In the basement they had a number of Jewish craftsmen, watchmakers,\njewelers, goldsmiths, this sort of thing. Now it\u2019s remarkable why po -- a police unit needs\ngoldsmiths on -- on the side. It -- I -- I think nowhere in the U.S. is a police unit that has\ngoldsmiths, and -- and watchmakers and so on. And neither do the Swiss police or any other I\nknow of. On the other hand, th-the German security police was a rather special organization. So\nwe were -- we were free, but then, couple days later we got a summons to go to the police and\nwe as -- were to turn in our passes. And they said, well, this 1s now out of the security police\u2019s\nhands, mixed bloods are now handled by the civilian administration, the so-called kibice\ncommissar. And you have to go to the office, there is a man named Butkarite who takes care of\nsuch things. So my mother and my older brother, who was -- usually went -- I was considered\ntoo young, of the two of us he was a more obvious companion on such missions, went there, she\ntold her story and he said well, we\u2019ll -- you\u2019Il have to do several things right away. First of all,\nyou'll have to file for divorce from your husband. Then you\u2019ll have to get at least two affidavits\nfrom people that know you, that can prove that -- that your story 1s true. And then, he said, you\u2019 ll\nhave to produce a baptismal certificate. Okay, filing su -- for divorce was no big deal, she did.\nThen months or so later, a -- a -- a letter arrived from the court, saying that proceedings had been\n-- been dr-dropped, because the case was moot, since the state prosecutor had notified the court\nthat my father had died on the ninth of December 1941. Well, this came in handy after the war\nwhen my mother was trying to get some restitution payments -- pension from -- from German\nauthorities and they wanted to have some proof that my father was killed, and under the\ncircumstances this was the next best thing to an actual death certificate. S-So I-I will actually\ndeposit a copy of this with the -- with the archives. Then the affidavits turned out not to be a\nproblem, and I considered it somewhat indicative of the fact that there still were a fairly large\nnumber of decent people among Latvians. We had moved into our building only two years\nearlier, and there was one -- the f -- of our neighbors there was one family who clearly were v-\nvery troubled by the way we were treated, and they just -- at every opportunity they showed that\ntheir sympathies were the Jews. So my mother went to them and asked, could you help us? So\nquickly they figured out the best thing to do was the mother of -- of our neighbor would file an\naffidavit claiming that many years ago -- she was an old lady by then, that she had met, in going\nto the park with her own daughter and she had met th -- a sort of maid that was taking care of my\n-- my mother. And they\u2019d often taken out the children for walks together, and then the maid told\nher one day, this is not the real child of her parents, it\u2019s a foundling, a Christian foundling and so\non. And so embellish the story [indecipherable] all well known. So that was affidavit number\none. The other one was by a younger woman who again test -- testified that she had met my --\nmy mother oh so, 10 to 15 years before the war, they\u2019d become friends, and then one day my\nmother again confided in her that she wasn\u2019t the real child of her parents and so forth. And then\nshe went on to say, well we, together -- she really had a Christian orientation, together we\nattended services in Saint Anne\u2019s church and so forth. A -- a number of embellishments or\noutright inventions and so forth, then stressed that well, th-the children were brought up le -- no -\n- in -- in the [indecipherable] Christian spirit. That wasn\u2019t true at all, but th-they -- they went to a\nLatvian school, not to a Jewish school. At home they used the German language and so forth. So\nagain, she did her -- her best to make the story sound as plausible as possible. One thing I forgot\nto mention earlier, that the first -- when we got our first set of passes, and my mother had\npractically n-nothing to prove her case. But for years she had been corresponding with, of all\nthings, the Rosicrucian fellowship in Oceanside, California. They had a correspondence service\nin any number of languages, she corresponded in German. I\u2019m not quite sure why she\ncorresponded with them, in part because she wanted some health advice, in part because there\nwere some strains in her marriage and she wanted some counseling and so on, and they basically\nlevel-headed people, gave her some good advice. And there were occasional references to Jesus\nChrist, and you know, praying to him and -- and all would be well. And those she was able to\nfilter out, and she was concentrating more on some vegetarian or whatever recipes, some herbal\nteas and so forth, and some of the good, common sense advice about how to deal with my father.\nBut this was helpful, this was obviously a Christian organization and it\u2019s before the war, before\nthere was any si -- ca -- question of trying to h-hide your Jewish origin, she was -- obviously had\na Christian orientation. And the U.S. at that time had not yet been in the war, so -- this was\nbefore Pearl Harbor, so those letters came in handy. Now that the tough part were the baptismal\ncertificates. We were told that the archives of the Baltic German churches had all been removed\nto what -- to Posen, which originally was a town in Poland, in western Poland, and of course\nthey\u2019d been annexed by the Germans. And they had settled a number of Baltic Germans there,\nand they clearly want to expand German -- ethnic German settlement eastward as much as\npossible. This 1s -- was already part of -- of Germany. So the church records were supposed to be\nthere, and she was supposed to write to them. Okay, so composed the letter, sent it off.\nFortunately, mail took one month to -- to Posen and then one month back. It was in early \u00b042.\nThen, the first -- it turned out the first address they\u2019d given us wasn\u2019t the right one, so th -- took\nanother set of letters and by the time the three months were up, all she had is this first letter\nsaying sorry, you wrote to the wrong address. So she went to the kibice commissar, Mr.\nButkarite and said, well, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve tried to do what you told me, but it\u2019s taking awhile, and here\nis the st-story. So he gave her a three month extension. He wasn\u2019t totally happy about it. Then\nafter three months, well we had another exchange and the people at the archives had\nmisunderstood the question. They -- they said well, before we can do a search, you have to give\nthe exact names of your parents and the date of your birth and the date of your baptism and all\nthat. And my mother\u2019s date of birth was -- in -- in the records, was supposed to be the date when\nshe was found, so she must have been born sometime previous to that. So, clearly they had\nmisunderstood the question, this took another round of letters, and now Mr. Butkarite was\ngetting impatient, he said, I'll give you one more three month extension, but that\u2019s going to be it.\nThree months were up and of course we didn\u2019t have anything yet. And as the 90 days approached\ntheir end, you know, you start closing your accounts with the world and just be -- be prepared\nthat you will be taken away and you will be shot, like so many people before you. And my\nmother went there with my brother and asked Mr. Butkarite and they said, oh no, he\u2019s no longer\nhere. It\u2019s now Mr. Persil has taken his place. So my mother did some fast footwork and sort of\nbackspaced a little bit and -- in the story and sort of took Mr. Persil to -- a few steps back from\nwhere we actually were, to gain time. Persil gave her the three months extension. And again, his\npatience gradually wore thin. And just when it seemed to be over, might have given us the final\nthree months extension, once again he -- he was transferred, and in his place was a certain Mr. --\nMr. Gudschmidt. And well, meanwhile what been happening, it turned out that the church\nrecords were in Riga after all, they were not in -- in Posen any more. The Riga state archive was\nclosed indefinitely and so that gained us some more time, but in then end it was opened. My\nmother and I went to Riga and looked the records, and lo and behold we found two girls were\nbaptized Erika in the three months preceding the supposed date that my mother was found. Now\nthe next step would have been to prove that my mother was one of these, which how do you -- do\nyou prove that? I suppose you -- you prove that there was -- this person vanished without a trace.\nAnd Mr. Gudschmidt was no fool, he realized that as long as my mother was doing the -- this\nresearch herself, she could suppress any unfavorable evidence, and this could go on forever. And\nso he flatly refused to extend the passes. Well, we -- now we went home and we thought well,\nwill the police come today or tomorrow? Will they come and pick us up at home or at work?\nAnd if at home will it be during the day or during the night? And no, we were prepared for the\nworst. Instead, nothing whatsoever happened. Well, one of the weird things is during 41 and\n\"42, there were a number of anti-Semites who repeatedly reported us to the police, and said here\nare some Jews who are not wearing the yellow patch. And eventually they got discouraged, and\none rumor that was -- was circulated in town was that we had connections to high places,\nspecifically to Goering\u2019s staff. Well, Ih -- wondered why Goering and I s-suddenly realized why\n-- why they came up with this story. My mother had an office job in a tiny, little four person\noffice. It had a very, sort-of pretentious name. It was the Ostland was in -- the name for the three\nBaltic countries, plus Byelorussia. It was Ostland Iron Trading company of the state works,\nHerman Goering -- in the name of Herman Goering. All it was is a small purchasing office that\nwas supposed to negotiate exports of the products of a large metal working factory in Libau and\nhave them shipped to Germany. And they would transfer the orders, negotiate delivery schedules\nand so on. Totally innocuous. But o-on -- on this street level, on th-the building, there was a\nplaque saying Ostland [speaks foreign language here] etcetera, etcetera, Herman Goering. Well,\nthese are big words that the average Latvian probably had trouble figuring them out. The only\nthing that probably made sense to them was Herman Goering, and so they saw my mother going\nin and out of this building and they thought well, there 1s some office close that\u2019s close to\nHerman Goering and sh-she has ca -- she has access to it, and sh-she has some -- some dealings\nwith them. Well, I wish I knew who started this rumor, because I couldn't have invented a better\none myself.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: -- side A of an interview with Professor Edward Anders, on February 28\", 1997, being\nconducted by Randy Goldman.",
        "A: Yes, well this sudden lifting of our passes occurred in -- of -- the early fall of 1943, and from\nthen on we were without any protection whatsoever. We were fair game, but nobody came to\nshoot us. The ill-wishers who would have liked to see us six feet under had sort of given up\nbecause they thought that for some mysterious reason we are immune from any kind of per-per-\npersecution. The police chief, the Latvian police chief himself, who was in a good position to\nknow that my mother was the biological child of her parents, because he had lived next door to\nthem, again decided not to lift a finger against us. He said that he would not give me a -- a\npassport, which he would -- I -- I was required to have from age 16, but at the same time h-he\nwasn\u2019t going to do anything against me, which was -- left me in some kind of a limbo, but it\nturned out to be not such a bad place to be. A substitute that became increasingly important was,\nsince I was not allowed to continue school, I enrolled in some correspondence course -- well,\nactually this was more of a home study course, with some so-called Rustian Institute in Potsdam,\nGermany. And they send you little booklets for various subjects, for -- depending on what\nprogram you took. There were different, many different programs. And the first thing they s --\nthey sent me was a very impressive looking I.D. card with my picture and a -- a big Prussian\neagle. It wasn\u2019t the -- Hit-Hitler\u2019s eagle with a swas -- swastika, but it was still a very impressive\nbird. And so that was a very handy, official looking identification card, which I could use on --\non occasion. Th-Then w-we were so -- I should now take the story back to -- so -- a couple of\nweeks after we had been released from prisons, was -- was shortly before New Year\u2019s, 1942. The\n-- the --",
        "Q: \u00b042?",
        "A: Yeah, well -- yes. It was very late \u201941, let\u2019s say, after Christmas \u201941. There were only about\n300 Jews left in town. A few months later they were moved into a ghetto, Latvians were cleared\nout of some part of town and Jews were moved in. We had essentially no contact with the Jews\nin the ghetto. My mother would occasionally see some -- some Jews on the street, she would\noccasionally talk to them. Some of them were happy that we were spared. Others -- but they told\nus that others resented it, that how -- why do we go free, and why do they have to suffer? I\nshould mention a -- a very minor incident. One winter night I walked past the ghetto, and I saw --\nit -- there was light snowfall and I saw that somebody was signaling, presumably with Morse\ncode from the ghetto to an apartment across the street, the window. So there was communication\nbetween the ghetto and -- and -- and Latvians living outside. There were a number of boy scouts\nin town, they\u2019d all learned the Morse code, so this was not a bad way to communicate. The Libau\nghetto lasted in -- I think until \u201943, then the last few hundred Jews, mainly craftsmen and such,\nwere deported to Riga, then they were put in the Riga ghetto.",
        "Q: Were you at all in a position to help people in the ghetto by sm-smuggling in food, or\nanything?",
        "A: It would have been difficult, and for me it would have been fatal. I think even for a Latvian,\nthis was a crime a-and I sa -- just looked here in the archives at some of the reports from Latvian\npolice and so on. And certainly anybody who had contact with Jews, and so on was -- was in\nquite a bit of trouble, and since I was highly exposed already, this would -- would have been very\ndangerous for me. We did have contact with -- wi-with some -- very few people. One night th-\nthe doorbell rang and my mother opened, and it was a Jewish woman, whom she knew. It must\nhave been late \u201943 -- late \u00b042, early \u201943 perhaps. I\u2019ve forgotten her name. She had been hiding in\nthe apartment of some Latvian family and from time to time she had to pay them rent, in\nquotation marks. She would -- generally gave them some -- some jewelry. And she claimed that\nshe had to go out of the house to some hiding place and get the jewelry, actually it was all sewn\ninto her clothes. Anyway, she had heard that we were still alive, and we were free so she had\ncome to see us and we had a -- a talk with her. I think we saw her once or twice more. She said it\nwas not easy, the people, while they were taking this rent from her, while they certainly did take\non a risk in hiding her, they weren't especially nice. And there was a 10 year old girl, sometimes\nspat on her. So it was -- it was un -- certainly unpleasant. After the war we heard that this woman\nhad finally been -- been found out, in -- probably in \u201944, put in a concentration camp and people\nwho had seen her in the concentration camp felt that she was already losing her mind. She was\nwearing some strange clothes in strange colors and just acting very strangely and so probably she\ndid not survive the war, but she was one of the few people who didn\u2019t -- able to hide until then.\nOkay, so backspace until -- to oh, right after Christmas \u201941. We -- I finally found a job. There\nwas a man in the state employment office who was very sympathetic to me. He knew, of course,\nthat I was a [indecipherable] half Jew if he believed the story, and he was most anxious to place\nme and to help me. So he sent me on interviews, most of the time when they found out who I\nwas they didn\u2019t want me. But they then managed to get me a job as a messenger in a support\nconstruction authority that worked largely for the German navy. And so fine, I was hired there as\na messenger, and they sent me on errands, and one day I was sent to the German security police,\nof all places, with some letter. So I handed it to some German official and said a few words in\nGerman and he replied, and I replied again, so he got excited when he realized that I spoke fluent\nGerman. And so he had s-said, \u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t you like to join the -- the Shutzmanshuf, the --\nth-the Latvian auxiliary police?\u201d And put me on the spot because you can\u2019t say no, I don\u2019t want\nto. And I certainly didn\u2019t want to say yes. And so I -- I started yes, but -- and so he interrupt me\nin mid-sentence and said, that\u2019s wonderful. \u201cWell we can so -- put you in uniform right away and\ns -- just ta -- fil -- take care of the papers and so on, start immediately.\u201d I say, \u201cWell there\u2019s one\ncomplication. I am -- I\u2019m a half Jew.\u201d Oh, the man was very disappointed. He -- this would have\nbeen supreme irony that maybe these people would hire me as one of them, but two weeks earlier\nthey tried to -- to take me to execution. But -- but there were lots of absurdities.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t there ever a point when being a half Jew wasn\u2019t good enough? I mean, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s\nkind of amazing to me.",
        "A: Well, it is -- we had a special status. A half Jew was neither fish nor fowl, and at least for a\nlong time it was not counted as a fowl. I have been told that there -- on the internet there 1s -- is a\nwebsite of Jews who sa -- served in the German army, it turned out that -- that virtually all of\nthem were half Jews, or quarter Jews, whatever. And I understand that Hitler said at one point, I\ndecide who 1s a Jew, and who isn\u2019t. And so they would make some people honorary Aryans, but\nof course the flipside of the coin was that you were made to serve in the German army. So it -- in\nLatvia -- you will probably si -- hear it during the rest of my story, much of the time people still\nweren't sure wh-what -- what rights I had and what rights I-I didn\u2019t. And some were -- were\nprudent and just didn\u2019t want to -- anything to do with half Jews, others would take a chance.",
        "Q: Right, but you -- it sounds like, if I\u2019m understanding you correctly, you were dealing with not\nonly Latvian officials, but -- but German officials as well?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, this German official\u2019s attitude was, the half Jew, maybe I was not bad enough\nto shoot, but I was not good enough to -- then to put on a police uniform. It wasn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] I was not considered reliable. So that was out, but he may have called my boss\nat the office and the boss then having found out that I was a half Jew, he fired me. Well, I wasn\u2019t\nt-too sorry to -- to leave because things had become unpleasant at the office again, about the time\nthat they found out. One day the -- the accountant started a conversation in a loud voice when I\nwas in the room, telling one of them, do you know that we\u2019re now -- that we are now drinking\nthe blood of the Jews? He said, when they were shot, he said, the blood seeped into the ground\nand now it\u2019s coming out as drinking water. You know, what do you s -- what do you say in such\n-- and of course he was staring at me and see how I would -- whether I would squirm and so on.\nWell, you have to -- you got to learn to keep a poker face. So I wasn\u2019t sorry to leave the -- the\noffice, the atmosphere was less than congenial. But th-then I was sent to another office in a\nconstruction firm, and there the boss, although he was a Nazi party member, had what -- very\nsensible attitudes toward Jews. He hired me knowing who I was, he had previously hired my\nbrother. And he tolerated us. He was a simple-minded man, he\u2019d been a -- just a -- a carpenter\nand -- and in Danzig, Germany where the headquarters of the company was, and he was made\nthe boss of the local company with some 80 workers. And he so -- he said at one point, to me this\nmakes no difference. To him, Jews, half Jews, Germ -- Aryans, they\u2019re all the same, all of God\u2019s\nchildren, so to speak. Not that he was particularly religious or anything. A number of months\nlater, this company was working for the German military and I had a construction project\ninvolving a German army construction battalion with architects and such people. And we were\nsort of liaison people, my brother and I, because we spoke fluent German. And the soldiers liked\nus, they were trained architects and so on. But then the major, the commander of the battalion\none day learned that we were half Jews, and so he promptly wrote a letter to my boss, and said, I\ndo not want these half Jews on my project. So when our boss got this letter, he [indecipherable]\ngot quite indignant and said, that major seems to be a real nice guy, but he said it sarcastically.\nAnd he said, well to me it makes no difference. So he said fine, we won\u2019t put you on that project,\nyou work on another project. And it\u2019s a ne -- one of a number of examples of decent people\ndespite his Nazi party membership pin. One -- one learns to be a lot more discriminating in\njudging other people when -- when you meet them as individuals. So that I ha -- I had a job, a st -\n- a Steady job, and by and large there were no further problems. There was one strange person\nwho worked for this company for awhile. He had been with the Latvian SD, and the reputation\nthat he had was that he was involved in some of the killings. He was always quite sugary with\nme, of course I couldn\u2019t say anything what -- but my interpretation of his sugary attitude was that\nhe thought, the dead Jews won\u2019t testify against me, but if I\u2019m nice to some survivors, maybe if th\n-- as the war\u2019s over and if Germany loses, maybe they\u2019Il put in a good word for me. Th-That was\nan example of the other kind. Then, at these construction firms, since they did a fair amount of\ntheir work in the naval port, one -- they -- some of them actually saw the executions. One of\nthem in particular, a t -- a teamster who had just had to transport building materials with his\nhorse and wagon, told us how he had been sort of traveling along the road, and he saw at a\ndistance, he saw a group of people lined up at the top of a dune. And then he heard a salvo and\nsaw them topple over like bowling pins. And then, after awhile another row appeared, and again\nthey fell. And this agrees completely with the description to Ezergailis\u2019 book, which was taken\nfrom quite another source, namely from some of the executioners themselves, later they would\ntest -- they would give depositions -- they were in -- in Russian custody and they gave\ndepositions for some German war times -- war crime trials. Then there were other rumors, which\nagain turned out to be in -- very consistent with Ezergailis\u2019s book from other sources. One of\nthem, for instance, was that the original orders to the executioners w-were to shoot -- to fire --\naim one bullet at -- at the head and another one at the heart. And then word came from\nheadquarters, both bullets at the head. Then that is -- that they were getting whatever it was, half\na liter or a liter of vodka a day for the -- for their efforts, the executioners. And there was a fair\namount of alcohol involved in -- in some of these executions. So, 1t was really common\nknowledge in town what was happening to a -- to a remarkable degree. I did not know exactly\nwhat the organizational structure behind all of it was. I didn\u2019t hear the word Einsatzgruppen until\nafter the war. In retrospect, yes, I could tell from the uniforms th -- that the people involved in\nthese were -- were a mixture. Some of them were the so-called SD, or Sicherheits Politsi, they\nhad one kind of uniform. Some of them were of the Shutz Politsi which had a -- even a different\nshade of green. The ma -- the policeman who finally told us that we could leave the jail, he was a\nman of the Shutz Politsi, which was normally a -- an organization that was not so involved in the\nkillings. But these Einsatzgruppen was a -- a mixture. They had assigned or recruited people\nfrom different branches of the German police and SS, so they had different uniforms and\ndifferent positions.",
        "Q: Was it your understanding at the time that the local population was also quite involved in a lot\nof these -- the killings?",
        "A: The -- the population as such, actually was not. There were, probably in all of Latvia, I\u2019m sure\nthere were several thousand who were actively or passively involved in the killings. There were\nsome executions squads. I think the most notorious one was based in Riga, the so-called Arajs\nCommando, several hundred who traveled in notorious blue buses all over the country to execute\nJews that had been rounded up by the local police. There were others who were Latvian police\nwho really just traffic cops and so on. They were assigned the job of rounding up Jews, as the\nones who arrested us, but in just leading them to the execution site, or in Riga, driving people to\nthe execution site. And th -- and there in Riga the shootings were done by Germans at the time\nthat the -- the big executions. In Libau there were several execution squads, as I found out much\nlater from Ezergailis\u2019 book. There was one Latvian squad and a German squad and they would\ntake turns. The Germans always tried to s -- to st -- to stress the local people\u2019s role in these\nexecutions. They would often take pictures only when a local squad was -- was doing the\nshooting and so on. Kugler, the -- the head of the SD, who had given us the first set of passes,\napparently was a -- a passionate photographer and he went to every execution, even if it involved\nonly few dozen Jews and always took pictures. And supposedly these pictures have been found\nin the -- apparently it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a well known collection. I don\u2019t particularly want to see it.",
        "Q: When the Latvians worked as -- you know, administrators, or --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- nestled couriers or guards, was it your sense that they worked with enthusiasm or that they\nin a position where they really had to follow the German directives?",
        "A: Those that did the dirty work, from rounding up Jews and certainly those who did the killing,\nthere was no indication of any touch of sympathy for the victims. Certainly 1t would not have\nbeen safe to show it, because even if a few of them felt some slight sympathy and said this --\nwell, this -- I\u2019m sorry that I have to do this dirty job, there were others who were doing it with\nenthusiasm, like the young policeman who was prepared to shoot us on the spot. And if he had\nnoticed that one of the other policeman felt sorry for us, that would have been a lot of trouble for\nthem. But I was interested -- yesterday, in the seminar I read a short quote from the report of the\nGerman police commander. He issued sort of biweekly situation reports a-about all sorts of\nevents under his jurisdiction, and always starting with, oh what\u2019s the mood of the people. And\nthe report immediately after these mass executions of mid-December of 1941, he said there is\nwidespread unease and disapproval among the local people about the execution of Jews. Many of\nthem feel sorry for what happened to the Jews, and only a few have expressed themselves\npositively. And in retrospect I can agree with that, because somehow when you -- when you\u2019re in\nthe midst of it, what registers much more strongly is the occasional anti-Semitic remark or act.\nWhat registers much less strongly is the passive tolerance, and there were an awful lot of people\nthat tolerated us, that could have turned us in and didn\u2019t. Occa -- some of them went so far as to\nsay some kind words and express their sympathies and so on, and we t -- we quickly found out\nwho they were an-and in retrospect, I remember quite a few of them. And others simply decided\nto look the other way, and not do anything for us, not do anything against us. So L-Libau was\nperhaps a little different in the sense that there was -- the population by and large was friendlier\nto the Jews than in so-some other towns, although it was -- I don\u2019t think it was that different\nelsewhere. They simply were not the so c -- the -- they didn\u2019t deserve -- the -- the majority of\npeople weren\u2019t the stereotype bloodthirsty Latvian henchmen as th-the executioners were.\nThere\u2019s no question that there were a few thousand involved in various capacities, who\ncommitted the-these atrocities, and did it with -- with -- with pleasure.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether you felt a lot of stress or fear, anxiety, during this time when you\nwere passing as a half Jew, but you weren\u2019t -- you weren\u2019t really in hiding, you were in public.",
        "A: First of all, if you live a lie, after awhile you begin to believe it, almost. I was circumcised,\nand so there was a constant fear I would be in a situation where this would be found out. So that\nwas the danger, but teenagers always think that they\u2019re invulnerable and immortal. And\nfurthermore, life kept you busy. There were the problems of everyday life, I had a job, I didn\u2019t\nhave that -- I worked six days a week, I didn\u2019t have that much free time, and then the routines of\neveryday life took time. I had some friends, Latvian friends and so on, who -- who were very\nnice to me and enjoyed associating with me and so on. So life was too busy to worry, and\nworrying 1s not going to change it anyway. I -- one of my favorite philosophers is Schopenhauer,\nonce said that when you are concerned about a calamity that may happen in the future -- there are\nreally two kinds of calamities, there is the -- the calamity that you know it\u2019s going to happen, but\nyou don\u2019t know when. The second kind 1s, it may or may not happen on a particular date that is\nalready fixed. So in the first case, you should act as if this calamity was going to happen in the\nvery distant future, so don\u2019t worry about it. In the second case, yes, the date\u2019s approaching, but\nlet\u2019s hope for the best. And actually that\u2019s good advice, and so I pretty much live by that. So I\ncan\u2019t remember ever being really depressed and so on, it was a game to survive and I f -- I felt\nthat I was going to do my best and just hope I did the right thing each time when I came to some\ndecision point.",
        "Q: So there was a part of this that was almost an adventure?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, in fact, this was certainly one of the stronger emotions the -- the night that I was\narrested, that I felt this was an injustice, these people had no right to arrest me, I was a half Jew. I\nalmost believed it myself. Chutzpah. Yes.",
        "Q: Did you feel conflict -- conflicted at the time about friends or family who were taken away?\nYou talked about how 55 years later you s -- you\u2019d reflected on this.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: On had you taken a different path. At the time, did you think about that at all?",
        "A: I thought about it. A number of our relatives were in Riga, so we only had indirect\ninformation. There was one postcard that came from my aunt saying that her husband and son\nwere in the countryside. She believed it, perhaps, or maybe this was her code word, but this was\nclear they\u2019d been rounded up within the first few weeks of the German occupation and shot. And\nI suspected so much at the time; by then we knew what the game was. Those in -- in Libau were\nmainly elderly relatives. My grandfather, of course, war arrested on Rosh Hashonah. My\ngrandmother, who was also in her 80\u2019s was put to work cleaning the mortar off bricks from\nbombed out buildings. But -- but she was again arrested in this mid-December action and she\nwas shot, my great-aunt, and -- and so they were picked off. There weren\u2019t all that -- that many\nof them, but they were picked off one after the other, the men jun -- in July, and the women, at\nlatest, December. And I understand that the others did too. One of them after the war, I found\nout, was still alive as late as \u201944, but then died in concentration camp. And so I -- I didn\u2019t really\nknow about some of the individuals, especially in Riga, but I pretty well expected that few, if\nany, would survive. And there was nothing I could do for them.",
        "Q: Just must have been an odd feeling at the time, to see other people taken out, or -- you know.",
        "A: Yes. I -- you can\u2019t let the, sort of emotions and so on, really overwhelm you. It is very sad,\nbut somehow you -- you realize that your primary task is to survive in spite of it. A-And, I mean,\ndo the best you can and just try to rise to each challenge. Yes, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a great injustice that\nthe Jews are being killed, but the most constructive thing I co -- I could make -- I could do 1s try\nto survive myself. And if there was an opportunity that -- certainly I would have bi -- would have\nliked to help them, but it was -- was dangerous.",
        "Q: Do you think there 1s something about the way you were raised, the way your parents are, that\nenabled you to pull this off in a way that other people might not have been able to? Are there\ncertain qualities?",
        "A: The most important thing probably was not to look Jewish. This was always a ve -- almost a -\n- ajoke among relatives, friends and so on when they first met us, they -- they said, well, they --\nthey don\u2019t look Jewish, my brother and I, and so on. Well -- and at the time it was of an oddity,\nbut 1-it -- 1t was -- was no practical consequences, but suddenly the consequence became very\nimportant. They were -- alright, Pll probably come to that a little later. Do you have another\nquestion that you want to check?",
        "Q: It seems that in a way you had a sort of contradictory approach in terms of dealing with the\nGermans.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: On one hand, you followed through on whatever you needed to, you reported when you had\nto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: At the same time, you said you were a half Jew.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So 1-it makes me wonder when you would report for -- or when they were interested in\ninducting you into the military.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you expect to be rejected by saying you were a half Jew? And if you hadn\u2019t been rejected,\ndid you think about what that might have involved?",
        "A: Yes. Let me take up this whole complex of military service. In -- after Stalingrad, Goebbels\ngave a famous speech in Berlin, s -- asking the audience, carefully handpicked audience, do you\nwant total war and they all shouted yes? And then he said, yes we\u2019ll have total war and it means\nsuch and such, and yes, it\u2019s total war. Well, one of the consequence of total war is that the\nGermans suddenly decided that they were going to get -- they ca -- whatever help they can get\nfrom whatever quarter. So they established a draft in Latvia, set up a Latvian SS legion.\nPreviously they had organized only police battalions which were used in some fairly low level\ncapacity fighting guerillas be-behind the front lines, so -- but these were going to be combat\ndivisions of the Waffen SS. And they -- I think they said that there\u2019s six years, around 1919 to\n1924, wherever that went out, to report to military for -- were going to be inducted. And it took\nseveral months for them to set everything up, so my brother\u2019s turn, he was born in 1924 came in\nabout November of 1943. And it -- he was summoned by the military authorities, he passed the\nphysical as anybody would have, and he was sent off to Latvian police battalion in Riga. They\nhad organized a special company called the labor company there, and this was a gathering place\nfor racial dregs. There were some surviving Gypsies -- majority of Gypsies had been killed, he\nthe half Jew. There were some Latvian ethnic Poles because normally the Poles were just one sn\n-- notch above Jews, and some Ukrainians, and whatnot, I mean -- so they were put in this\nspecial unit for basic training and one day they got a pep talk, and they said, you will be sent to\nthe toughest combat. Those of you who prove themselves, will have a place in the new Europe,\nwhich was Hitler\u2019s slogan for what was going to come after the war, and those that don\u2019t, well,\nbeware. So, what choice do you have? But then 1-1f -- few weeks later, the -- they s -- the\nGerman liaison officer apparently decided that it wasn\u2019t right that a half Jew should be wearing a\nGerman police uniform, and so he s -- ordered that my brother be dismissed. He -- my brother\nwrote a petition which I still have, asking to be allowed to fight against Bolshevism, which was\nterribly important and so forth. And the co-company commander, Latvian approved it, the\nbattalion commander, also Latvian, approved it, the German liaison officer rejected it.\nSupposedly he said he knew of one place in Germany where some half Jew with some particular\nmerits was allowed to st -- to stay in the German police, but lacking these special merits, my\nbrother didn\u2019t qualify, so he was sent home. And he had to -- barely arrived home than the draft\nboard got after him and said, well you\u2019ll have to come for another examination and we will just\ndraft you in the Waffen SS. And my brother said, well the police didn\u2019t want him, oh the Waffen\nSS is different, they\u2019re not as choosy. Well, before he could appear there, he got sick with -- with\ntyphoid and diphtheria, was put in a hospital. My mother visited him several times and she felt\nthat the personnel were anti-Semitic, maybe they had seen that he was circumcised, gave him\nvery bad care, and he died. A day or so before he died, he told her -- he was already in -- in\nfever, he told her that he had to [indecipherable] he had a -- a bad dream that he had to climb su -\n- a mountain of death, which is strange that -- this premonition. And the next day he died. So this\nwas a very hard blow for me because we had become very close since -- at the time we -- I had\none or two other friends, but we were much closer, very reliant on one another. Was nothing to\ndo, eventually my turn would come, I was two years younger. And realizing that my turn would\ncome soon, I thought, well anything was better than serving in -- in the ground forces. Air force\nwas the lead unit, it was out of the question. I tried to volunteer for the navy, and they said, well\nsorry, we can\u2019t take half Jews. Then there was the German labor organization, but normally they\ntook people at 17 f-for [indecipherable] anything to gain time, that may -- may be better than\nmilitary service, again they wouldn\u2019t take me. And then, at the end of July \u00b044, they -- a notice\nappeared in the paper that everybody born in 1926 was to appear for induction. And the Russians\nhad been advancing with giant strides into Latvia, at the rate of, you know, sometimes 30 - 50\nmiles a day, and at that rate they would have been in my hometown within a few days. The result\nis that of some 500 young men of that age group, only about eight showed up for induction. Two\nhalf Jews. Me, and the real one, his mother was Greek. We did not dare take any chances, cause\nif the Russians weren\u2019t there the next day, or in a few days, 1f we hadn\u2019t shown up for induction\nthis would have been a wonderful excuse for them to kill us. The Latvians could play games,\nthey could hide on a farm and so on. We didn\u2019t have these connections, we couldn\u2019t have done it,\nso nothing -- no, we showed up for induction. And then they were ready to draft us, but then we\nsaid we are half Jews, oh well, that shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. And I said, well my f -- my\nbrother was in -- inducted in the police battalion, then he was discharged a half Jew. Oh no, no,\nthe SS is different, but to be on the safe side, we\u2019ll check with headquarters, and they gave me a\ntemporary deferment until further notice, and also the other half Jew. And -- well, again, play for\ntime. Just about the same time, since the Russians were advancing very quickly, a lot of people\nwere afraid that the Russians would take my hometown, and they would be under the Russians\nagain and by then the Germans were sufficiently indebted to the Latvians that they decided that\nLatvians could, in principle, seek refuge in Germany, but subject to political clearance, that they\nwere reliable. So we felt that 1t was a question of a mount -- Mohammed going to the mountain\nbecause w-we could have sat there forever waiting for the -- the western allies to come to Latvia,\nit wasn\u2019t going to happen, that we had to move west, and this was our chance. So it turned out\nthat , well the -- the first thing to do was to get this political clearance. And I had to go to the\nvery same police that had wanted to arrest me and -- and shoot me a f -- a few years earlier.\nFilled out the form, and then every hour a policeman would come out with a stack of forms that\nhad been at -- ei-either accept or rejected, and he would call out the names, and so I had to --\ntook time off from work, just stand there and wait, because I didn\u2019t want my name to be called\nevery hour because there would be enough people to -- who would recognize it, and I might be in\ndeep trouble. So, as soon as my n -- my name and my mother\u2019s name was -- was called, I\npromptly got the slips, looked at them, and they were both stamped okay, approved to\nemigration. I don\u2019t know what files they checked. We were on their death list a couple of years\nearlier, and now all of a sudden we\u2019re kosher again. Was absurd. Th-The tape --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So they -- there was a notation on my sl-slip saying that for the time being, is not\npermitted to leave because I\u2019m a man between 16 and 60 and they have to be kept in Latvia.\nWell, my mother, in her usual way said, I don\u2019t want to go anywhere without you, let\u2019s drop it. I\nsaid, no, no, no. Let\u2019s try to get some papers for you. The next step was to get an I.D. card, and --\nto emigrate into Germany. And I had -- my mother\u2019s passport had a couple of very serious\nhandicaps. One was her Jewish first name, Rachel. And I had taken that out with sodium\nhypochlorite [indecipherable] a budding chemist, and there\u2019s some -- still a nice stain on the\npassport, showing where that was. And the second one, her m-maiden name was Scheftelovich, a\nvery Jewish sounding name, and Leventhals, which -- which, come to think of it, Leventhal is\nalso a Jewish name. And these -- these double names have a strange origin from Tsarist times\nbecause in the Tsarist days when -- when somebody was drafted into the army, that was for 25\nyears, which means you can just say goodbye to a normal life, no marriage, no children and so\nforth. And so the game was to avoid military service at all costs. I don\u2019t know exactly how the\ngame was played, but apparently one of the tricks was to find some childless families that would\nsort of pretend that your child was theirs. And so that my grandfather\u2019s children were all farmed\nout to different families and so each t-time, each such incident gave rise to another double name.\nMy mother ended up a Scheftelovich-Leventhals. So we had to go to the -- again to the kibice\ncommissar\u2019s office, and apply f-for -- and se -- an I.D. card for my mother. And standing in line,\nI looked over the girls that were taking care of these applications and I tried to pick the dumbest\none. She was mentally slow and seemed confused. Anyway, when my turn came, she was -- was\nbewildered by these multiple names, and so, on my mother\u2019s passport, and she was quite happy\nto let me dictate to her what she was to write. So first of all I told her to write just Leventhals.\nThe Latvian spelling didn\u2019t look -- to a German eyes, didn\u2019t look too obviously like Leventhal.\nAnd -- but -- and Scheftelovich was completely edited out this way. And then she said, what\nnationality? I said, write Volksdeutsche. German. So she did. Fine, but then she had to take it\ninto her boss to -- to sign, and the -- the boss saw Volksdeutsche. Are you registered with Miss\nSo and So, who apparently was the person there that kept track of all the -- the ethnic Germans.\nAnd I said no. \u201cOh, then you can\u2019t claim to be Volksdeutsche.\u201d So he told the girl, \u201cWhy did you\nwrite Volksdeutsche? Cross it out, and write Latland\u201d -- Latvia. That -- yeah, that -- okay, that\nmeant -- he didn\u2019t say to write that she was Latvian, she just had to write Latvia, the country. But\n-- and although Volksdeutsche was crossed out, it was still legible. And this was just good\nenough, when we got to Germany later to pretend that she was a Volksdeutsche from Latland,\nwhich is the somewhat quaint way of -- of saying that. So we had Aryanized her by another\ncouple of -- of steps.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B, of an interview with Professor Edward Anders, on February 28\",\n1997.",
        "A: I have to give you a name.",
        "Q: One question that I wanted to go back to. In your efforts to get inducted into the German or\nthe Latvian military, at the same time saying that you were Jewish, or part Jewish, did you expect\nthat that would disqualish -- disqualify you, or had you -- was your intention really to become\npart of the military?",
        "A: I most certainly did not want to be -- to join the military, because this was the last year of the\nwar, and the conditions were pretty grim. Being in an SS uniform, of course made you much\nmore likely to be, sort of, killed if the Russians succeeded in capturing you. And conditions were\nvery rough at the front, so I certainly didn\u2019t want to serve in the military. But I also had no\nrealistic way of -- of dodging the draft. Latvians could go and hide on a farm, they could\ndisappear in the woods and join some of the small guerilla units. I had no such option. And of\ncourse the f -- the farther -- th-the longer those -- the war lasted, the more conspicuous were a\nyoung man of military age who were not in uniform. So I was prepared to take my chances. I\ncertainly had to tell them sooner rather than later I was a half Jew, but if they had said, that\u2019s\nquite alright, we\u2019ll draft you, I would have had no choice, would -- would have put on a uniform\nand been gone wherever they\u2019d sent me. And I am very glad it never came to it.",
        "Q: By saying you were a half Jew, did you think at some level you would be disqualified?",
        "A: Well, from my experience -- from my brother\u2019s experience, he was disqualified for a police\nbattalion, but not for the Waffen SS. At least that was our understanding at -- at the time he died,\nthat they would have been glad to draft him. And maybe the rules had changed, so I s -- half\nexpected to be drafted, but I hoped I wouldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did you think about what you might have had to do if you had been drafted?",
        "A: Yes, the Waffen SS, it\u2019s sort of an oddity of German military organization, that they put the\nso-called Latvian legionnaires into the Waffen SS. They could just as well have put them in the\nregular army, because they had essentially no connection with the SS, and the atrocities that are\nassociated with the s -- SS. For some reason they organized these foreign legions, so to speak, as\npart of the Waffen SS, which was an elite organization and -- but without all the connotations\nthat go with it. Naturally, among the Latvian legionnaires, there were a number wh-who were,\nespecially among the officers [indecipherable] had been involved in killing Jews and so forth.\nAnd other were anti-Semites just from way back. But by and large it was a -- sort of a fairly\naverage bunch of Latvians. They -- if taken prisoner by the Russians -- of course, since these\nwere nominally Soviet citizens as far as they were concerned, of course they were all likely to be\ntreated very badly, possibly killed or sent to the gulag or whatever. But th-that\u2019s something you\npretty much had to accept in those days. It\u2019s just that I had no real alternative, and as a -- asa\nhalf Jew, I could not dodge the draft.",
        "Q: Okay, you had -- you were talking about the fact that you and your mother were cleared,\npolitically to go west --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- into Germany. And I\u2019II let you pick up your story.",
        "A: Yes. So at th -- at this point we had a new I.D. card for my mother, which was significantly\nAryanized, and we -- but we didn\u2019t have anything for me, and I was not allowed to go. The\nRussians had stopped their advance temporarily, but then came September they were advancing\nagain, and th -- th-they -- before long, in -- in early October, they al-also managed to take Riga,\nand the Germans decided that they were going to make my home province of Courland into a --\nessentially a fortress. So everybody who was not working was then pressed into service to go out\nin the countryside and dig trenches all day and come back late in the evening. My mother and I\nhad to do that. After a few days I had developed some serious problems with my ankle, and some\nyoung German medics decided that I was not suitable for hard physical work, and he gave me an\nexemption so I could stay home. There were very frequent air raids. I stayed home and sort of\ncooked meals and so on. My mother went out to -- to dig trenches, and my principle in those\ndays was never to wash the dishes until evening because you never knew whether the house\nwould be destroyed by bombs, in that case why waste the effort of washing dishes first? So this -\n- we somehow managed to last through September, and then in early October the Russians\nmanaged to -- to punch through to the Baltic in -- somewhere in Lithuania, and -- effectively\ncutting off what was left of Latvia. At that point, apparently, for a few days the Germans decided\nthat things looked a bit risky and they had better evacuate those civilians who were friendly to\nthem. So all of a sudden this restriction that men were not allowed to leave was lifted, and I got\nthe green light. Of course, we promptly signed up to leave, and managed to get on a ship, and\nwere taken to Danzig, arrived there in the middle of the night. I produced my I.D. card from this\nhome study institute and it was duly stamped by -- with the immigration stamp with the official\nGerman eagle, so it ha -- I now had an I.D. that at least had semi-official status, thanks to the\nimmigration stamp.",
        "Q: How many were on this -- this boat with you?",
        "A: Probably a couple thousand people. It was a fairly sizeable freighter and it was full. They --\nthey took as many people as they could possibly put on it. And of -- the military situation again\nwas quite fluid, there were frequent air raids on -- on Libau, and one never knew whether the\nRussians wouldn\u2019t manage to -- to take the rest of -- of Latvia in the next few days. As it\nhappened, that part of Latvia remained under German rule until the end of the war. They finally\nsurrendered after the -- the armistice, and then the Russians occupied it. So we got to -- to\nGermany, and were put on the train and ended up in the Stargard transient camp, which is -- is a\ncamp that probably metamorphosed several times from concentration camp to camp for foreign\nlaborers, and then for friendly allies and so on. And within a few days I came down with\ndiphtheria. I was put in the hospital ward of the camp, and my mother had a great fear, having\nlost one son already to bad medical care by anti-Semitic personnel, she didn\u2019t want to -- to leave\nme there, so she managed to, by a little bit of bribery and fast talking, she managed to find a\nplace for me in an auxiliary hospital in -- in town that was a special diphtheria hospital, which\nwas endemic at the time. Th -- mainly children, but also a number of adults. It was run by some\nsisters, the M.D.s were a couple of Italian prisoners of war, and I checked in and stayed there for\nthree weeks, and was discharged more or less cured. We didn\u2019t want to go back to the camp. We\nhad, meanwhile, taken up contact with a German family in the Sudetenland in Kometau. It was\nthe family of a railroad man. He and his wife had lived with us for a number of months 1-in -- in -\n- in our apartment. And we had been nice to them, and they said, well, 1-1f you ever want to come\nto -- to Germany, then let us know, we\u2019 ll be glad to -- to host you. So it was very important at\nthis stage, if you want to get out of that camp, to have a contact, have an invitation. So we\nmanaged to secure the invitation, we were al-allowed to leave. We checked into a hotel, again\nthrough some bribery. The hotel, of course, you promptly had to fill out the police registration\nform. I began to fill 1t out and I came to the question whether we were half Jew or quarter Jew,\nand I was about to check myself off as a half Jew, and then suddenly I realized that 1t would be\ncrazy to do so at this late stage. Certainly the Jews and half Jews had been deported from -- from\nGermany, and it would be very dangerous for me to admit that, and I also realized that here I was\nin -- in Germany, nobody knew me. I had no reason to tell them the truth. So I just wrote down\nVolksdeutsche, and that was fine, but now wa -- we had carefully saved all this wonderful\ncorrespondence with the various archives about my mother\u2019s baptismal certificate and so on. So\nwe went through our documents and tore up everything that in any way 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- hinted at -- at\nthe status as -- as -- as a half Jew, and my mother being sort of a probational -- an Aryan -- tore\nup all these hard won papers, tore up family pictures of my grandfaren -- parents, who looked\nJewish. Anything that was incriminating and the -- we had to dispose of these papers in the\ntoilets down the hall, so every little while we went to the toilet, there was big flush. So, anybody\nwho was watching us would have thought that somebody must have, you know, dysentery, going\nto the toilet this often. Anyway, we got rid of all the -- the papers and we felt we had a new\nidentity. And then was just a matter of taking a train and going to our fi -- this -- our family F-\nFisher in the Sudetenland.",
        "Q: Now just before you move on --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- I want to ask you a couple questions --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- about Stargard.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It was a transit camp, and where -- where did you say it was located?",
        "A: It was lo-located -- the town of Stargard is fairly close to the -- what s -- used to be called\nStettin, is now Szczecin, a large city. Stargard itself was a picturesque small German town, with\nmaybe 30,000 population. I think it was fairly close to the center of town, or it wa -- the whole --\nwhole town wasn\u2019t very big, it was on the outskirts.",
        "Q: Were all of the other people in this camp in your position, or were there people who were\nthere under more forced --",
        "A: No, at that time, as far as I could tell -- that the -- the camp had very light security, and so\nthese were, for the most part, friendly allies, refugees from Baltic countries and those that had no\nbetter place to go, had no invitation, were sent to -- to Posner, to some other place, and others\nwere allowed to go and see their respective hosts.",
        "Q: And how long were you there?",
        "A: In the camp probably, officially I was presumably still registered at the camp when I was in\nthe hospital, but let -- let\u2019s say I may have been there four or five days before I was put in the\nhospital, at most. Maybe not even that long.",
        "Q: So you could -- people could come and go from the camp, you weren\u2019t concentrated there?",
        "A: No, well you -- you could check out of the camp if -- provided you had an invitation to go\nsomeplace else. But you were -- you could certainly go into town if you wanted or -- or f-f-for a\nfew hours, go to the post office, and so on.",
        "Q: As you get out of Latvia, got into Germany, did you learn more about what -- what had been\nhappening during the war, about the concentration camps, or --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know of Auschwitz, of the death camps until after the war. I-I had known about\nconcentration camps like Dachau and Buchenwald for -- for years, and I thought these were\nsomething com -- comparable to penitentiaries elsewhere. I didn\u2019t think that there was a lot of\nkilling going on, certainly it was no Hilton, but I was totally unaware of the death camps. On the\nother hand, I talked to some Germans. I -- later, in -- in Kometau I sort of dated a -- a -- a\nGerman girl a few times. Was a very sensible girl and -- and she realized the war was lost, and\nshe said, I would fully understand if we were treated the way we have treated the Jews. And it\nwas clear from the way she said that, she knew that lots and lots of Jews had been killed. So fr --\nfr -- at least for -- all those who had -- didn\u2019t deliberately shut their ears as information was\navailable, it was widely available. But there were other people who didn\u2019t want to hear. Soldiers\nwere -- officially were not allowed to -- to tell tales out of school, so there were rumors. And you\ncould choose to believe the rumors, or not. Now if you had a relative that was -- had been at the\nfront and knew about these atrocities and decide -- decided that he could trust his family when he\nwas on home leave, and tell them the truth, he would. And then, from then on the family knew,\nthey had it from a reliable source and if they want to take chances, they could pass information\non to friends. But it was dangerous. If this sort of information eventually reaches the police, they\ncan trace it to their source, and you can all be in deep trouble. So, but it was certainly the\nthinking Germans, for the most part, had some idea of what was going on.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll let you continue.",
        "A: Yeah. I should sort of inter -- interpolate briefly, that I met a very outstanding German, who\nwas just a private in the army, he was a -- an architect working in a construction battalion, who\nempathized very strongly with Jews, to the point where h-he gave six-sevenths of his weekly\nbread ration to Jews. And at his -- well, he -- he had occasionally had the opportunity to go to a\nplace where Jewish workers were employed, and he would generally give them a signal and so\nthat he\u2019ll leave a loaf of bread in some mutually agreed on place so that two minutes later they\nwould stop by and pick it up and hide it. And so he had only one-third of a loaf of bread for all --\nfor the whole week. The -- his comrades -- he also re-refused to use the sidewalk, since it was\nforbidden for Jews to use, he always walked in the gutter. His comrades knew it, they teased\nhim, said oh, Miller is making a long face, he must have seen another Jew. But it was good-\nnatured teasing. Their own sympathies didn\u2019t go quite as far, although -- but at the same time\nthese were basically decent people as far as I could tell. And nothing happened to him. It was\nperhaps significant that although the man was a -- a -- a-a architect\u2019s diploma that he was not an\nofficer, but just a -- a plain private. So there were some decent, idealistic Germans. I met some\nothers. We -- for a short while one of our roomers during the war was a Latvian former diplomat.\nAnd when we needed -- who was originally from Riga and then he went back to Riga. And when\nwe needed to go to Riga to the archives, we needed a place to stay, we wrote him, and he said,\nwe'll be very happy to have you stay with us. So he treated us very nicely. He knew our story\nand he could very well see through it, he was smart enough for that. So when we were there, he\nhad invited some of his friends, and -- including a German soldier who had learned Latvian, and\nthey were so -- outdoing themselves, including the German soldier, in making derogatory\nremarks about Hitler and the Nazi regime. And these were Latvian intellectuals, and they\ncertainly were nice to us. They could easily have done us in just on the basis on their suspicions,\nand they didn\u2019t. And yet it was also quite clear that they were not in sympathy with the Nazis. So\nthey were decent people and those people were critical of the regime, but what should not be\nunderestimated is how difficult it 1s to rise against the police state. Okay, shall I continue with\nthe story? Well, we got to the -- to Kometau, and arrived at the -- the home of our -- our prospect\n-- the Fisher family. We had with us a sort of as -- a small bag with five pounds of Latvian\nbacon. Of course, they were starved for anything like this, and they all ate to their hearts content\nand got sick to their stomachs, but I mean [indecipherable] used to such rich fare. We had went --\ns-spent the night waiting in the station, there was no local transportation, we didn\u2019t know where\nto go, so we had a sleepless night, and only had to wait until daybreak before we could visit our\nhosts. So we arrived there midaft -- mid-morning, and anyway by -- sort of shortly after noon we\ndecided we need a nap. The family said, why don\u2019t you go to our bedroom, and just stretch out\nand sleep. Aft -- and we left our -- our bags downstairs. Afterwards when we came down I\nnoticed that my mother had not locked the bag, and in her suitcase the uppermost item was a\nJewish prayer book, which she had taken with her and had put in the most accessible spot in an\nunlocked suitcase. I do not know -- these people were rather nosey, I do not know whether they\never opened the suitcase, whether they saw it. The prayer book was in German, this was for\npeople who, like many Jewish women of the time, didn\u2019t read Hebrew, and it was quite obvious\nwhat it was. If they had looked, they didn\u2019t breathe a word to anyone, which was rather\ncharacteristic of many people. Their -- I don\u2019t think they were really out of sympathy with Hitler\nbut they drew the line at not really wanting to be involved in any -- anything hostile -- a -- any\nhostile actions against Jews. There were Sudeten Germans, not all Sudeten Germans -- Schindler\nwas a S-Sudeten German too. Not all of them were -- were as decent as Schindler\n[indecipherable] these -- I don\u2019t think these people were anywhere near it. But it\u2019s another\nexample of people who could have done us in and chose not to. So anyway, we were welcome to\nstay there only as long as -- as the bacon lasted. When that was eaten up it was intimated to us,\nwell you better find yourself some housing. We went to the appropriate office, and was --\nappeared there as Volksdeutsche and at first they weren\u2019t too re-responsive, but my mother\nbegan to [indecipherable] and was very good at making a good impression and before long she\nhad persuaded them that they should get us a furnished roo -- room somewhere. And they had --\nit turned out they -- they had room that was ostensibly reserved for somebody else, it was in a\nvery nice part of town 1n a very nice apartment, and they probably didn\u2019t want your average, sort\nof eastern European refugee there, but after looking my mother over, and me, we looked\nrespectable, so they as-assigned that room to us. Well, there was actually -- there was no\nfurniture, but then they gave us special permits to buy some very cheap, sort of very e-\nemergency, essentially unpainted furniture. Some straw for straw mattresses, little stove, just the\nbare necessities. This was late \u201944. Large parts of Europe were certainly living under quite\ndifficult conditions, but the Germans still managed to look after their own. We were now\nconsidered their own, so we were able as -- as refugees, were able to get at least the minimal\nnecessities for life, as well as [indecipherable] halfway adequate ration cards. Well, the next\nproblem of course, was that I was 18 years old at the time, I was not in uniform, I\n[indecipherable] this was most unusual situation. The German army should have come after me,\nthey never did. But f-fortunately, something prevented me from -- fr-from being put in uniform.\nNow, we -- my mother and I sort of had to go shopping until we got settled, and I kept telling\nher, please don\u2019t walk so fast. And the problem wasn\u2019t that she was walking too fast, 1t was just\nthat my heart was giving out. This is a complication that often happens when adults get\ndiphtheria, that they get myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle. So, before\nlong I was in bed, and one of our neighbors was a doctor, she came up, listened to my heart,\nshook her head and said you better get yourself to a hospital. So I was in the hospital for two\nmonths, bedridden with myocarditis. And meanwhile the labor office had decided that they\ncouldn\u2019t put me in the army, but somehow it didn\u2019t seem right that an 18 year old should not be\nin uniform, and they had just the ideal job for me. I was to be a -- a guard at a -- a factory,\nguarding prisoners of war and forced laborers. These we-were armed guards with -- with rifles,\nand who were -- whose job it was to get the last ounce of effort out of these poor, undernourished\npeople. And a number of them were killed after the war. So while I was in the hospital, I kept\ngetting one summons after another to appear there, and to b-be sort of signed up for this par-\nparamilitary unit. I always write them, sorry, I\u2019m still bedridden, still in the hospital. Soon as I\ngot out of the hospital they again want to put me in that -- so -- in that unit, and I said sorry, but I\nam s-still quite sick and I c -- I\u2019m not yet ready to work. So they sent me to one of their doctors\nwho told me just to -- to do a few bends and then checked my pulse, which was well over 200 by\nthen. So he said okay, you -- you\u2019re unfit to work, I\u2019ll exempt you from work until May 15\".\nWell, the war ended on May eighth, very conveniently, so I had no further trouble from that\nsource. And while I was in the hospital there were several air raids, one was in our -- our town,\nbut the others were generally to other cities. And I was there the night that Dresden was bombed,\nand it was an air raid, we didn\u2019t hear any bombs falling, or any anti-aircraft artillery, so we just\nstepped out on the street to look, and we saw flashes of light at the horizon in the direction of\nDresden. And there was a mountain range between us, so we couldn\u2019t see too much, but we saw\nthese white flashes, then gradually they were replaced by a red glow which rose higher and\nhigher in the sky. And realizing what was happening there, it was rather scary. And of course,\nafterwards, you know, that night 60,000 people got killed in Dresden. The Germans still feel this\nwas a war crime, it was done with the British and the Royal Air Force. So we were not in great\ndanger, there were a few more bombings, in one of the [indecipherable] towns 500 people got\nkilled. There were also bombings in Libau, but the closest danger was that once or twice a bomb\nfell within about a hundred meters from us, but they were small bombs, and other than breaking\nwindows, nothing much happened. Well, we were just listening to the -- to th-the radio and\nmanaged to get the BBC, and we knew pretty well what was happening, and our German\nneighbors also realized what was happening, and -- and by April they -- they knew the war was\nlost and they were sort of wondering how to prepare themselves for the next [indecipherable]\nchange that was emi -- imminent. They -- one sort of triumph that came our way is that the\nneighbors on the ground floor were perfectly decent people, but since they lived in the ground\nfloor apartment, it was their duty to -- to hoist the German flag on official occasions, and they\ndecided at this point that this flag with a swastika was s-somewhat a incriminating material and\nthey want to get rid of it. They decided to burn it, but they couldn\u2019t burn it in their own\napartment because people could have looked in through the window. So we were on -- on the\nsecond floor and they asked if they could come and burn the flag in our stove and we were\nabsolutely delighted. Something else that I -- I me-meant to mention 1s that -- is that living in the\nSi -- in constant danger and not knowing exactly when the police would come to take us away\nand what would happen after that, we thought it was a good idea to prepare ourselves and get\nsome poison. So, as a budding chemist I found a recipe for making potassium cyanide and I\ncooked up a batch for myself and my mother and we carried it with us until sometime after the\nend of the war, until we could get out of the Russian occupation zone. Fortunately we never had\nto use it. The stuff is vile tasting and it\u2019s a bit ironic that as far as taste is concerned, the -- the\ngas, hydrogen cyanide at Auschwitz 1s -- is less disagreeable than -- than swallowing potassium\ncyanide, but the difference is, if you decide to kill yourself with potassium cyanide, that is\npreferable to being killed against your wishes. And so to us this would have been definitely the --\nthe lesser evil. Then we f -- about a week before the end of war, we heard that American troops\nhad -- were within -- within about 50 kilometers of Kometau where we lived, and the Russian\ntroops were still 300 kilometers away, and we knew nothing of the Yalta agreement. So we\nthought that the race goes to the swiftest and expected the Americans to show up any day. And\nthen nothing happened, the Russians kept advancing and the Americans were standing pat. So it\nwas once again a case of Mohammed going to the mountain. Suddenly the war was over, it was\nMar -- M-May the eighth. M -- in the last few days of the war we had seen long processions of\npeople on foot, m-most of the time from the east. It was a strange mixture of people, the\noccasional concentration camp inmate in striped garb, the occasional SS man, guarding him, or\njust looking out for -- for his own interest. I particularly remember one Jew who -- who really\nlooked pretty awful. He was clearly undernourished, but from his face you could tell that the man\nwas close to losing his mind. I don\u2019t know what became of him. And it was pathetic. There were\nsome others that didn\u2019t look quite so bad, but this was as -- a very sad case.",
        "Q: So what you\u2019re describing is death marches from the camps west -- going west, or --",
        "A: It was -- it was a mic -- a strange mixture. There were a lot of civilians, there were some s-\nsoldiers in uniform, and then the occasional camp inmate. Presumably he wasn\u2019t free to go where\nhe wanted, there was -- was a guard nearby, but these weren\u2019t large contingents of refugees, this\nwas not one of -- all of concentration camp inmates. This was not one of the main routes of the\ndeath marches, but there was just a sprinkling of these people. I -- I don\u2019t know where they came\nfrom, so on. Well, came the -- the eighth of May. Of course we had been delighted before to hear\nthat Hitler had committed suicide, although that\u2019s not the way the story was told. But then, on the\neighth of May the ma -- the war was over, Germany had surrendered, my mother went out on the\nstreet, and an -- an old lady asked her just what is all this commotion about? People are so fa --\nhustling and bustling. And ma -- my mother said, \u201cThe war is over.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d this lady said,\n\u201cwonderful. So we won.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d my mother said, \u201cGermany lost.\u201d \u201cHow dare you say that? \u2019'm\ngoing to report you to the Gestapo.\u201d Well, it\u2019s remarkable that on the eighth of May, that there\nwas still a German woman who didn\u2019t realize that the war -- that they were losing the war. That\nin itself is a -- is an interesting topic, how a number of people clung to the hope that they might\nstill win the war. Course, Goebbels had all this propaganda about these secret weapons, that he\nhad -- one -- he said at one point that he had seen the new s-secret, retaliatory weapons and they\nmade the blood freeze in your veins. Well, it was a complete bluff, there was no such thing. After\nthe V-2 they have nothing more. But now the problem was the war was over and there was still\nno sign of either Americans or Russians. And then we realized the Russians were advancing and\nwe had better get out. And in place it was -- where the Americans were supposed to be with\nKarlsbad. So we went to the station and -- just to see what kind of transportation there was, and\nlo and behold there was a Red Cross train with so-some French prisoners of war, a former\nLithuanian p-prime minister who had been kept political prisoner in some castle, the Belgian\npriests, the Crown Prince of Montenegro. So, a weird assortment. Anyway, we s -- my mother so\nfast talked her way onto that train and we were allowed to get on. And so the train traveled a few\nkilometers, stopped for a few hours, travel again. One station on the way I saw an SS man in full\nregalia, marching, parading up and down. The war had been over for two days but this was still\nunoccupied territory, and it was scary to -- to see this man still completely self confident, as if he\nwere on top of the world. Anyway. Then, a few kilometers further the train stopped and then\nthere\u2019s -- I forget who it was, came and announced that all civilians and so on, refugees, get out,\nyou have to get off the train. Only the people who are authorized by the Red Cross can stay. So\nwe were 10 kilometers from Karlsbad, took our suitcases and just walked the last 10 kilometers.\nIt was not a very good thing for my heart because turned out that I had a good relapse at the time,\nso -- which kept me bedridden in -- in Karlsbad for a few more months. But we got to Karlsbad\nin the afternoon, walked around town, saw an American Jeep and were delighted. Went to bed,\nand we managed to find a refuge with -- with our neighbors who had taken us there, they had\nsome friends, we managed to sleep in someone\u2019s kitchen. Thought the next morning, we must go\nto the -- find the am -- American whatever, military office and sort of report there and say who\nwe are and just ask for protection. The next morning we were just -- we walked downstairs and a\nwoman stopped us in the stairs, hey you people, you better hide your watches, the town is full of\nRussians. The Russians were great watch collectors. Some of them would wear as many as five\nwristwatches proudly on the wrist. So what had happened is that [indecipherable] the Yalta\nagreement, the town was divided between Americans and Russians at the time. We were on the\nwrong, sort of, bank of the river, th-the Americans were on the other side. It\u2019s -- few people\nmanaged to swim ashore during the night. We -- I was in no condition to do that. The soldiers\nthat we had seen in the Jeep the night before, they were just having a joyride through the -- what\nwas to be the Russian sector of the town, and th-they have then returned to their own sector. We\ndid manage to get across the American sector and talk to a major who heard me out and said\nwell, why don\u2019t you wait a few days until we -- we have established control over the -- the town\nand then come back again. Well, it turned out there was no coming back because they pulled out\nthe next day. They turned out the -- turned the whole town over to the Russians, and so once\nagain we were in the clutches of the Russians. And once again it was a great convenience to have\n-- to be sick and not being sort of fit to be transported back to | -- to Latvia. Well, I should really\nstop at this point and maybe go back to the war time experiences, because we are now in the\npost-war era. The only thing that\u2019s left of the post-war era would be the Nuremberg Trials, or\ntrial.",
        "Q: Okay, what would you like to --",
        "A: Yeah, I can perhaps backspace --",
        "Q: -- s-speak -- s-speak about now?",
        "A: Yes. Okay, in 1948 I was a student in Munich, and somehow I saw an appeal to --",
        "Q: Okay, well so you -- so you are going to continue on?",

        "A: I-If you want me to I can talk about the -- the other stuff but th-that\u2019s our post war\nexperiences, little dangers to life or limb.",
        "Q: Well, I just -- I guess, you know, up-upon the point at which you felt truly liberated and safe.",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "Q: You know, what -- what kind of decisions did you make, how did you make them, where did\nyou go?",
        "A: Yeah. Alright, until I got to the American zone 1-in Bavaria, yes, okay that\u2019s a couple more\nminutes, tiny bit more maybe. Alright, so I was in Karlsbad, once again bedridden, unfit to be\nshipped back to Latvia, and therefore safe. I-I sort -- registered with the -- with the Czech police\nand -- and registered as Jew, f-first time in years. The Czechs were quite chauvinistic. They had\nfour levels of ration cards, the largest food rations were given to Czechs and Slovaks. I think the\nsecond category was to friendly aliens, and this included Jews. The third one was for Austrians.\nThey still had some soft spot for their former Austro-Hungarian masters, and the lowest one was\nfor Germans. So we were still qualified for num -- for number two treatment. Well, 1t was fine, it\nwas a relatively a com -- relatively a comfortable place to be in. But then, since Czechoslovakia\nhad -- was supposed to become independent and the Russian a-and the American troops were\nsupposed to be withdrawn, by October the Russians were trying to round up their nationals and\nship them back and my illness was -- had regressed far enough that it was no longer an excuse\nand we realized that we would be in trouble if we didn\u2019t want to go back to Latvia again. So, we\ndidn't quite know what to do and then fortunately we met a Romanian Jewish woman who was a\nlot more worldly than we were, we were really quite naive in spite of all these experiences. And\nshe told us, look, there is -- the Americans are in Marienbad and there\u2019s train service available,\nwhy don\u2019t you just get on the train and go over there? And so we did, first as reconnaissance and\nit was relatively simple. The train stopped at one point, the Russian guard came on board, check\neverybody\u2019s I.D. card and then the train moved on a couple hundred meters and then an\nAmerican came on board and ch-checked people\u2019s I.D. cards, and a Czech policeman also came.\nSo we quickly realized that the smart place to be is in the farthest corner of the car where it was\nhard for the -- for the guard to take a close look at your I.D. card. So I had got my old school I.D.\ncard that you just saw, because Latvian has the same diacritical marks as Czech, so to the\nRussian this looked like Czech, to the American it probably looked like Czech, and to the -- I\ndon\u2019t know what it looked like to the Czech, maybe he didn\u2019t have 20/20 vision. So we managed\nto get through without any difficulty, trying to keep a poker face as usual. We got to Marienbad,\nfound where the -- the American sort of -- the sa -- sa -- military commander was, went to his --\nhis office. They had -- shall I stop? Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape three, side A, of an interview with Professor Edward Anders, on February 28\",\n1997, conducted by Randy Goldman.",
        "A: Okay, so we went to the American military office. There was a German interpreter whose\nEnglish was more fluent than mine. He had a hammer and sickle in his buttonhole, was\nobviously a German communist, or at least [indecipherable] this would make him a little more\nacceptable to the Czechs at the time. We told our s -- our story to them, and the American officer\nshook his head and says, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re -- you\u2019re living in Karlsbad, that\u2019s under the Russians,\nthere\u2019s nothing we can do for you. So we had long faces, and went out in the corridor and the\nGerman communist came after us and said, look, people, there\u2019s an easy solution. Why don\u2019t you\njust come here again, check into a hotel, then you will have established residence here. And we\nhave a standing rule that any foreigners not wishing to return to their home country will be taken\nto the U.S. zone of Germany. And so all you have to do is check into a hotel, and come back.\nGood advice. Went back to Karlsbad, packed up our belongings, took the same train back, got\ninto a hotel, appeared there and things worked like -- like a charm. We were now under\nAmerican jurisdiction, supposed to be shipped off to Germany. We were then told that the very\nnext morning we were to appear at eight o\u2019clock someplace, and we would be put on a truck and\ntaken to -- to a transient camp from which we would then go to Germany. So we appeared there\nat -- and we were the first ones in line and the line formed behind us, and I then, looking around\nto the -- the other people, everybody had baggage tags with their names, only we didn\u2019t. I\nthought, well, it was a smart idea, you can become separated from your baggage and this is an\neasier way to trace it. I better go and get some baggage tags. So I went looking, stationery stores\nand so on for baggage tags, and since I could only speak German to the Czechs, they didn\u2019t\nreally want to sell anything to a German, so I was -- they shook their heads and sent me from -- I\nwent from store to store. By the time I finally got these tags and came back, a big trailer truck,\nU.S. army trailer truck had arrived. People were being loaded on it, we\u2019d lost our place in line.\nWe were just about the last ones to get on, in the very back. Well, turned out this once -- once\nagain saved our lives. We were then -- truck went on its way, on the road to Pilsen. Was a light\nrain and the road started getting a bit slippery, and the driver was going a bit too fast. And I stood\nup in the rear of the truck and just enjoyed the feeling of sa -- wind in my face, and suddenly I --\nsomething hit me in the forehead, it was an overhanging branch of a -- of a tree. And I promptly\nsat down and then the woman looked at me and started screaming, because blood was pouring\ndown my face. I had a deep gash in my -- my -- my scalp. And before we could do anything\nabout it, suddenly the whole truck sort of overturned; hit a tree, overturned, and I had wonderful\nsensation of being a tennis ball. I just flew through the air, landed in the grass, one of my\nsuitcases beside me. I knew right away where I had some emergency bandages, so I got the\nbandage out, got myself bandaged up. Turned out that four people who were at the very front of\nthe trailer, where we would have been, had -- were all killed. And there were a few more people\nwho were injured. Before long an ambulance appeared, took me and two other people to the\nhospital and I was sort of st-stitched up by the Czechs and they weren\u2019t too happy about doing\nthis for me, it wa -- they asked where I was from, and they became a little friendlier when I said I\nwas from Latvia, I was not German. And then they want to know whether Latvians were a Slavic\npeople, so for once I made the Latvians into Slavs and say yes, we are Slavs and [indecipherable]\nI got -- got treated well after that. So we got to this camp in Pilsen and before long we are\nshipped across the border. We arrived in the U.S. zoned in Bavaria and yes, for the first time we\nfelt free. It was probably that time that we threw away our potassium cyanide, which was a -- an\n-- an important symbolic act showing that we now felt that we were safe. So I\u2019Il s -- really like to\nsort of skip ahead, unless you want me to go through the rest, and just go on to 1948, when a -- I\nhad joined the -- oh, there were a few funny incidents after the war. I en-enrolled as a student,\nand there was a Jewish student\u2019s organization in Munich. I didn\u2019t see any particular reason to\njoin it, but one of my friends, Jewish friends urged me to, so I -- I joined. And no sooner had I\njoined when they summoned me for what they called a court of honor. They wanted me to prove\nthat I was not a former SS man, and I said, well [indecipherable] my name is Alperovich, I can\ntell you a -- where we are from and so forth. How do I know that your name wasn\u2019t Goering\nyesterday? So once again Goering had intruded in my life. I said, here is my school I.D. see,\nfrom 1940, the one that you just saw. So he realized, few years older, but the same face, same\nname, so th-then they s -- let -- let me off. The second funny incident along these lines happened\n-- actually was three -- then, sometime later my mother was summoned before a board of rabbis\nto prove that she was Jewish, because they didn\u2019t believe her, she looked too Aryan for them.\nAnd she overheard the rabbis whispering among themselves, one of them said in Yiddish that, I\nbet her mother wasn\u2019t Jewish. That was ironic that here we had s-struggled so hard all these\nyears to prove that we were not Jewish, and then afterward, after the war, 1t was just as hard to\nprove that we were Jewish.",
        "Q: Why was it -- why did -- why did she need to do that? What was the rabbis role --",
        "A: Well, as a -- as a Jew, you were eligible for better food rations and some -- some other\nbenefits. Nothing major, but it -- it was helpful to be registered there. And the third incident was\nwe were, of course, trying to emigrate to the U.S., and we had a bunch of papers with us, even\nafter that s-s -- destruction session in the Stargard hotel, including some claims from my father\u2019s\nbusiness, and various other papers which -- some of which turned out to be quite important in\ngetting a pension for my mother out -- from the Germans. And so being very law abiding\ncitizens, there was still a -- a -- as -- military censorship in Germany at the time, and so we\ninquired, we have a bunch of papers and so on, do -- is it alright to take those? You can take\nthose, but you have to bring them to the censor first, the censor will check them over. And you\ncan pick them up next Tuesday. So I went there next Tuesday and they said, well, sorry, well\nthere\u2019s -- some of the documents were in Latvian and it will take us a little while to get them\ntranslated. Could you come back tomorrow afternoon at two o\u2019clock? So I came back the next\nday at two o\u2019clock, I was ushered into a Jeep, there were -- a military policeman beside me. They\ndroo -- drove me to the CIC headquarters, that was Central Intelligence Corps of the U.S. army.\nAnd I was ushered to a room where there was a proud sign saying, into this room wa-walk the\nsharpest investigators in Europe. And I happened to see the file on his desk, Edward Alperovich,\nformer Latvian SS man, wants to emigrate to the United States. And that George Alperovich,\nformer SS -- Latvian SS man wants to emigrate to the United States. Well, George had been dead\nfor over a year. Then they sa -- well, several years. Anyway, they started grilling me and they\nhad a Pole who apparently worked for them. First of all they had me s -- stripped me naked and\nthey searched me everywhere for tattoos, because SS men often had tattoos, couldn\u2019t find\nanything. Well, then the American sat across from me, he was carrying on a conversation with\nthe Pole. Did you see? He\u2019s circumcised. No, for me it\u2019s sure. What he meant to say, I\u2019m sure\nthat he is an SS man. So they -- they searched and they hemmed and they hawed, and I was very\ncalm, and I said -- he said, were you in Prague? I say, yeah, I was in Prague for a couple days\nafter the war, I was trying to get the visa to go to Switzerland, which of course they wouldn\u2019t\ngive me. And they asked me a few other question and they said -- I said, well, when was I\nsupposed to be in the SS? Just tell me the time and I will show you documents where I was at the\ntime. I was never in the SS, it was the hospital much of the time. They wouldn\u2019t tell me when.\nThere was -- in that suitcase there were letters from my brother when he was in the Latvian\npolice battalion. There was some correspondence with some SS office about getting his passport\nback after he had been discharged from the police battalion, they hadn\u2019t returned his civilian\npassport. And my mother also tried to get some kind of a pension because he had died right after\nbeing discharged from military service, and was a good chance that he got his typhoid and\ndiphtheria when he was still in the military. So there was correspondence, we had saved it, we\nhad nothing to hide, and they got terribly suspicious. So in the end they gave up on me and let\nme go. But it was really funny that the shoe was now on the other foot, having to prove that I\nwas not an SS man.",
        "Q: Were you, for any period of time in a DP camp?",
        "A: Yes. I was in -- near Munich. When we came to Bavaria we were shipped off there, and I\nworked as a draftsman there, and then just -- just trying to find out what options I had and I -- I\nheard that some -- UNRRA had opened the university in -- in Munich, and so I went there just to\nsee how do I get back on an educational track. And it turned out that they were running a\nrefresher course for people who had lost their high school diplomas. And they said why don\u2019t\nyou take this class, in about four or six weeks of classes and there\u2019ll be exams afterwards. So I\nsaid, can\u2019t really, because I have not finished high school, I was still three years short. Oh, take it\nanyway. So anyway, I t -- I took classes, and managed to als -- to move out of the DP camp, and\nto Munich, passed the exam and I was admitted to the university.",
        "Q: So you were in the DP camp how long?",
        "A: I think a couple of weeks perhaps.",
        "Q: What was the name?",
        "A: Fernwald.",
        "Q: In those few weeks --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: -- you, I guess for the first time, met people who had really been through a very different side\nof the war.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you describe that? Your reaction to it, what people looked like?",
        "A: As far as I remember, there were no people that I could identify as concentration camp\ninmates. There were some Hungarian Jews who had, as far as I know had been -- had not\nsuffered too much. How and why I -- I didn\u2019t have a chance to find out. There were a number of\npeople who had re -- entered Germany from Poland, from -- from Russia and so on, in the first\nfew months after the war when the Iron Curtain wasn\u2019t very tight, and so most of them did not\nlook like the -- the really sort of hard core concentration camp survivors. Ea-Each of them had a\ndifferent story, of course, but th -- I th -- I think the -- the real hard core survivors, they were\nmainly in the British zone, that\u2019s where Dachau was -- no, no, Dachau wasn\u2019t in Bavaria, but I\u2019m\nnot sure what became of the Dachau people, Bergen-Belsen was in the British zone.",
        "Q: But at this point you learned a lot more about what had gone on in Poland in -- in the camps?",
        "A: By then, of course the German newspapers were carrying a lot of this. There were\ndocumentaries shown o-on -- in the movie theaters and so forth, so it -- and in fact, I had seen the\nfirst pictures in Bergen-Belsen, yeah, soon as they came out -- n-not as soon as -- they came out\nlate April, probably when Bergen-Belsen was liberated. And I certainly saw those no later than\nwhen -- when I was in Czechoslovakia, because th-the Czechs would certainly play up German\natrocities. They weren\u2019t especially partial to the Jews and so on, but this was very graphic\nevidence of how the Germans had behaved.",
        "Q: Was this surprising to you, that it had really been so drastic?",
        "A: To a considerable extent, yes, because it\u2019s one thing to hear in the abstract about\nconcentration camps and so on. We had a ghetto in town, we saw the Jews. They didn\u2019t look th --\ns -- badly un-undernourished. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t get quite enough to eat, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as\nbad as in -- in the concentration camps, this extreme emaciation, with people looked like walking\nskeletons, and so on, this was total news to me, and 1-1t shocked me.",
        "Q: So you enrolled in this UNRRA university?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Near Munich or in Munich?",
        "A: It was in Munich, right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: For awhile I commuted, left the -- the camp every morning at five a.m., and then returned the\nevening around eight or nine. And that got to be a little too much, so I managed to get a room in -\n- furnished room in town, moved out of the camp, mo-moved into town.",
        "Q: Was your mother still with you?",
        "A: Yes. We had been together all -- all this time. Yes, so anyway, I passed the exam and was\nthen eligible to enroll at the UNRRA university. I also, shortly after, when the University of\nMunich opened, I registered there as well, which was a good thing because the UNRRA\nuniversity was closed after a year and a half, forcibly by UNRRA. They just suddenly withdrew\nsupport overnight. There -- there was a lot of unhappiness among the students because we were\nreally hopeful that this was something new, an international university and s -- and so on, but\nanyway, they -- it -- it was destroyed by -- by UNRRA. Anyhow, so then I was a student at the\nUniversity of Munich, and somehow in -- in \u201948 I saw an appeal from the prosecutors at the --\none of the Nuremberg Trials of the German high command, asking for witnesses from the Baltic\ncountries who could testify against the commander in chief of the army group north, Field\nMarshall Vonlabe. And yes, I was from a Baltic country and I realized that, having seen that --\nthe license plates of the germ -- of the trucks that rounded up Jews, that a -- and having heard the\nsi -- German soldier brag how they had killed -- shot the Jews and so forth, I-I -- I could say a\nthing or two. So I re -- I-I notified them that I was available, they asked me to come up to\nNuremberg. I was then interrogated by one of the prosecution staff, who showed me on the\nfamous Einsatzgruppen a report by Stahlecker, and that\u2019s where I saw this hideous map with the\ncoffins and so on for the -- for the first time, showing how many people they had killed. He gave\nme a number of copies of documents and I told him about my experiences, and he felt this was\nquite useful information that would implicate Vonlabe. Then I -- he got onto Russians and\ncommunists and so forth and I could tell that as soon as I started telling him about my bad\nexperiences with the Russians, so on, he sort of froze, he became quite uncomfortable. A few\nyears later there were headlines, fr-front page headlines in the New York papers that two\nAmerican prosecution staff members had defected to Russia, he was one of them. He wa -- we --\nwe talked a-about an -- at -- he said, well, no matter ho-how bad you say things are in the Soviet\nUnion, there is no anti-Semitism. [indecipherable] there -- there is. So, well, you\u2019ve had some\nbad personal experiences. But it was clear that he was, even then, quite sympathetic, and then at\nsome point the damn fool defected. He was, as far as I know he wa -- I think he was a Viennese\nJew, and just had this -- this strange notion that -- that Soviet Union was a good place to be, and\nthis was about at the -- \u201948, that was the time of the -- the doctor\u2019s plot, you know, Stalin was --\nwhich was when Russia became strongly anti-Semitic, was -- became -- official policy was\nStalin\u2019s paranoia. Anyway, before long they had introduced me to the chief prosecutor, Walter\nRapp, who decided that my testimony was important enough that he was going to interrogate me\npersonally before the court, and was scheduled several days in the future. And then they said, are\nyou interested in -- in hearing Ohlendorf, the commander of the Einsatzgruppe D, testify? He had\nalready been sentenced to death but they hadn\u2019t executed him, he had volunteered to cooperate.\nThey said well, under the rules, you are not supposed to appear in courtroom until you testify.\nOtherwise it\u2019s -- you'll -- you\u2019Il be prejudiced. Sit way in the back and make sure that you are\nnot too conspicuous. So I went there, it was interesting to see Ohlendorf testify. The prosecutor\ntold me the man was highly intelligent and it\u2019s really so sad and mystifying why somebody so\nintelligent would do such horrors, and maybe this was his way of showing his -- his remorse. The\ndefense lawyer, of course, tried very hard to discredit his testimony, and his final question was,\nyou are under sentence of death, aren\u2019t you? And Ohlendorf said yes. It was a strange sight to see\nthe German high command lined up on the defendant\u2019s bench. They were little, old men. They\nhad -- th-they no longer had their shiny army boots, a number of them were wearing slippers,\ntogether with [indecipherable] which looked pathetic. And they were tiny. I think they still had\nthe mil -- some of the military insignia, I can\u2019t quite remember. When they wanted to go to the t -\n- the toilet, a -- a big, burly, black American MP walked in, towering over thi-this pathetic tiny\nfigure in slippers. I happened to be using the urinal at the same time as one of them. It may have\nbeen Vonlabe, I don\u2019t know. But it was such a contrast these people di -- a few years earlier they\nwere the people that were looked up to, they were the high commanders of whole army groups,\nand so on, countless divisions. And now they were just ordinary mortals, looking pathetic. But\nthen came the day for my testimony, a-and -- and the -- Rapp started to interrogate me. And they\nwere very pleased when we had sort of rehearsed my testimony, they said [indecipherable] how\ndid you know these were ar-ar-army trucks, and I told him the license plate numbers and so\nforth, the din -- designations and uniforms. I remembered a lot of details. Suddenly the defense\na-attorney cut in and said that this, sorry, this is new evidence that should not be allowed at this\nstage -- the trial by then was at the rebuttal stage. And so the court recessed for two days and\nthen finally decided -- while the attorneys were arguing -- and finally decided yes, this was\nindeed new evidence, it was too late for that, so it was stricken from the record. Vonlabe got only\nthree years, he was 70 at the time. I learned since then that Vonlabe was an anti-Semitic s.o.b.\nfrom way back, from World War I. He had been major or lieutenant colonel, or whatever in\nRomania, and there had -- they had some problems with guerillas there in World War I. And he\nwrote to somebody that he [indecipherable] requests permission to hang a lot of Jews, he thought\nthe Jews were behind these guerilla activities. That was long before Hitler. So he certainly had it\ncoming. It\u2019s unfortunate that he only got a three year term, I would have loved to see him\n[indecipherable] a little longer. I met a few witnesses there. There were a couple of former\nRussian prisoners of war, Jewish. There -- neither of them looked Jewish and they described\nsome of their experiences to me. I\u2019m not sure in which trial they were to testify, I-I didn\u2019t hear\nmuch about their testimony, but they told me some of their stories, how they had been taken\nprisoner. And one of them was of -- assigned as a -- not quite valet, it\u2019s too fancy a term, but to\nsome German medic, and the German medic apparently knew, for whatever reason, that this man\nwas circumcised, and he said, well, I know that before long there will be -- you will all be\nstripped and they\u2019 ll try to find the Jews among you, and if it\u2019s all right with you Pll perform a\nlittle operation so that you -- it won\u2019t be obvious that you -- you\u2019re circumcised. And if they ask\nyou, then say you had phimosis, which is of a -- when the foreskin gets very tight, so that\n[indecipherable] it can\u2019t quite normally function, then one normally operates it -- and then it\nleaves some scars, but it\u2019s not like a full circumcision. So he -- he did this operation for him,\nwhich put the -- the man was rather uncomfortable for three days, but after that it healed, and it\nmay have saved his life. And it\u2019s -- again it\u2019s a case where a German had the opportunity to save\nsomebody\u2019s life. He had gotten to know this man a little bit, and apparently wanted to save his\nlife. One incident, it\u2019s a little bit out of sequence. Right after the end of war in Karlsbad, we were\nstaying in the apartment of some people we didn\u2019t even know, just a -- our -- our neighbors from\nKometau had introduced us and managed to -- to get us into their apartment. And there was a -- a\nyoung man, probably in his mid or late 20\u2019s, who was a bit depressed about th-the fact that\nGermany had lost the war, and we went for a walk in the town together. And he said, well you\nknow, I have done a lot of reading, and I know now why we\u2019re -- we lost the war. It\u2019s all because\nof the -- the Jewish conspiracy. I didn\u2019t say anything one way or another, I didn\u2019t do anything. I\ndidn\u2019t feel like turning him in to the police. And I\u2019ve asked myself occasionally, was that the\nright response? He was basically a pleasant young kid. He had read some Nazi propaganda about\nJews, world domination, and this sort of stuff. Incidentally, when -- right after the Germans\noccupied Latvia, within weeks they started publishing Latvian translations of the protocols of --\nof the elders of Zion. And I felt that the man would probably get his just desserts sooner or later.\nMaybe his eyes will be opened, but 1t wasn\u2019t up to me to turn him in. Quite possibly this was the\nfeeling that a number of people had who could have acted against Jews, and again didn\u2019t want to\nget their hands dirty. Th -- somehow, when you know a -- a person, unless you a ver -- a very --\nsomehow a -- full of hate against another group, when you\u2019ve got to know a person, even for just\nfive minutes or so, you feel that you don\u2019t really want to have his blood on -- on your hands.\nThat\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s probably a normal reaction. This case, they had lost the war, I now know\nthat Sudeten Germans, thousands of them, were actually killed during the deportations, the others\nhad a pretty rough time getting out. I imagine that he presumably paid for it, and in the end\nmaybe his eyes were opened. But perhaps one could call me a coward for not doing anything, or\n-- or saying anything. I certainly did not feel like saying, you\u2019re talking to a Jew.",
        "Q: Actually, this is s-sort of that same period of time. The first time when you were in\nCzechoslovakia, and you were filling out papers, and you -- you wrote down that you were a Jew",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that must have been a difficult decision, or --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t so much a difficult decision, I had to give myself a push to write this word, which I\nhad been avoiding all these years, and just to make the complete 180 degree turn, you know, all\nthis time be claim -- be something other, then suddenly to come clean and say, I\u2019m a Jew.",
        "Q: Did it occur to you not to do it?",
        "A: No. At that time there were practical reasons. If I had -- if I had written Latvian, there could\nhave been problems. Th-They might have decided to s -- to ship me back to Soviet Union, and I\nsomehow didn\u2019t really want to get mixed up with the Latvians. But the Latvians who had gotten\nout of Latvia included a number of Hitler sympathizers, as well as some people like ourselves,\nwho just want to -- to avoid living under Stalin, who were basically decent people. But I -- I felt\nthat -- that -- that wasn\u2019t much of a choice, I might as well come clean.",
        "Q: Was that the point at which you sort of consciously acknowledged again that you were\nJewish?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, definitely. Part of it was the practical reason, if you could say that you are Jewish,\nin a way this ab-absolves you from all suspicion of being a Latvian with some things to hide and\nso on, or a German, or whatever. That was practical, but in -- in part it -- it just seemed natural. I\ndidn\u2019t feel especially close to Jews from other countries. I did belong to this Federation of\nLatvian Jews, it was called, and I di -- discovered that there were -- were several differences in --\nin -- in the -- even in the Yiddish, of Lithuanian Jews, Polish Jews and so forth, and the mentality\nand so on. That -- Latvian Jews were terribly naive compared to Hungarian or Romanian Jews,\nwho were very, very wise in the -- the ways of the world. So yes, but primarily I was -- cer-\ncertainly I consider myself a Jew, and this -- I had sort of concealed this fact for years and now it\nwas out in the open.",
        "Q: Now, you were not terribly religious, although you observed certain holidays, prior to the\nwar?",
        "A: I became religious after my Bar Mitzvah. E-Every day I would put on the Tefillin and say my\nprayers and so on, and I was trying to be, not maybe 100 percent, it certainly wouldn\u2019t satisfy the\nOrthodox today, but I -- I was pretty religious.",
        "Q: Did you return to that after the war, did you think about returning to that sort of religiousness?",
        "A: No, I -- I thought about it, but I had become -- I\u2019m not sure whether estranged 1s -- is the right\nword. I -- that -- somehow I was now five years older than I had been at the time. I can\u2019t say that\nI'd lost my faith in God or anything, but I felt that the -- first of all the external observances of\nreligion I-I found less and less meaningful and significant. I\u2019m not one of those people who feels\nthat there can be no God, how could He have -- have permitted the Holocaust and so on. Th-This\nis -- has not been my problem, it\u2019s just that I felt that the religion to -- to me had become --\nshould be less nationalistic, less tied to various rituals. There were also be certain teachings of\nJudaism that I approved of, certain traditions that I approved of, others I wasn\u2019t so happy with.\nSo I didn\u2019t really feel that I wanted to return to become as 100 percent a -- a -- obs -- observing\nJew. And then there were sort of f-festivals like -- like Passover. This was a family festival, and\nwe had -- we had no family left. And you know what, my mother and I should have a Seder\ntogether, it didn\u2019t seem right that -- yes, well the notion of the exodus and so on is -- als --\nalways seemed like one of the -- the -- the highlights of Jewish history, and I could still relate to\nthat, but the external observances somehow became less and less acceptable to me. But I still\nconsider myself a Jew. On the ship that took me from Germany to the U.S., I was put in charge\nof the ship\u2019s newspaper, which was a good outlet for my sense of humor, such as it is. And I\nreported with -- I would show the drafts regularly to the IRO officer, IRO is International\nRefugee Organization, the successor of UNRRA. Was a Frenchman. I think he was Jewish, but\nI\u2019m not s -- not sure. And he asked me to [indecipherable] what nation-nationality, and I said,\nI\u2019m -- \u2019ma Jew. Yes, but from what country are you? I said, from Latvia. Then why didn\u2019t you\nsay you\u2019re a Latvian? Now, that was my first encounter with the difference be -- the eastern and\nthe western European definition of a Jew. One case it\u2019s just a religion, and the other case it\u2019s\nreligion and race, or ethnic identity. And I took it seriously, and I -- I began to think about it, and\nI felt yes, well why not just make it a religious affiliation, why should it be national? And I so --\nalso felt that in Latvia you never had the choice of assimilating, I would have liked to assimilate.\nI wanted to become an agronomist, Latvia was an agricultural country and I wanted to be 120\npercent Latvian patriot. The smart thing to do then is to become a -- an agronomist and advise\nfarmers on how to grow bigger and better crops and so forth. I was steered in other directions\nafter that. But in Latvia I never had the choice of fully assimilating. Minorities were given their\nrights, they could have their own schools, their own newspapers and so on, but they were\npermanently excluded. There were no Latvians in the government or in the s -- no Jews in the\ngovernment or the civil service. There was something for the Latvians and the Jews, their\nfamilies could have lived there for 400 years, but they were still outsiders. And then I was\npleased to find that in the U.S., you get your citizenship papers, you get your passport, and you\nare a -- an American by passport. Not by blood, or by name, or whatever. And I much prefer that\nsystem.",
        "Q: Would you like some water? Do you have a glass? Pll get some. You chose to emigrate to the\nUnited States, is that primarily because you were in the U.S. zone, or was that something that\nyou gave a lot of thought to?",
        "A: We had some very distant relatives in New York, so that was one consideration. There were\nsome other relatives that I never succeeded in locating, that would have been a little closer. At\none time, having read a fair amount of anti-American propaganda during the war, I thought the\nUnited States has a lot of problems. It\u2019s an interesting country, a large and powerful country, but\nsomehow I felt that maybe it\u2019s a -- it -- there\u2019s a lot of light, a lot of -- of shadow too. I thought,\nwell, I'd like to emigrate to an English speaking country, maybe Canada, maybe Australia or\nwhatever, but at the time they weren't taking Jews with no strings attached. In one of them you\nhad to -- you could go there if you agreed to work as a lumberjack for two years. Well, that\ndidn\u2019t quite fit into my career plans. So I gave up and decided maybe the U.S. was -- was the\nbest place after all, and from I had seen of America and Americans in the U.S. occupation zone,\nI-I just really liked what I saw, and I got to know more. I read the New York Herald Tribune\nwhen I -- whenever I could, and I -- I liked what I saw and decided yes, I want to go there. At\none time I\u2019d thought of going to Switzerland, but then, through a -- the Hillel foundation, I think,\nthey\u2019ve got the scholarship for me at the University of Oklahoma. Fortunately I never made it\nthere, it was a bit of backwater. Among my papers at one point I discovered I was also offered a\nscholarship at the University of -- of Zurich in Switzerland. And though at one time I had the\nambition of going there, a -- by then Switzerland was no longer interesting option, I wanted to go\nto the U.S..",
        "Q: You wanted to get out of Europe?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Thi -- this was a general feeling among many DPs, that we have been caught up in\none European war and we\u2019ve just barely escaped and we would talk occasionally, what is the\nbest kind of passport to have. Well, a very small cun -- country, like Andorra, so what?\nNobody\u2019s going to start a war with Andorra, or San Marino or whatever. Well, the next best\nthing that 1s, a passport of a large country, preferably at the other side of the ocean. So that was\ncertainly an element, but the other one was that I became more and more aware of the great\npotential o-of the U.S. freedom, the opportunities and so I -- I liked the idea of going to the U.S..",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t have too much difficulty getting over here?",
        "A: Thad a lot and -- and you may have s -- I\u2019m not sure how much of that I actually -- yes, I --\nthe copy of the biography that you have, I\u2019m not sure whether it actually goes to the time of\nemigration, but I don\u2019t know whether you want me to go into that story or not.",
        "Q: Well, there is a bit of it in there --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- I just didn\u2019t know if there was anything that you wanted to say about that.",
        "A: P-Probably not, it-it\u2019s that -- 1t\u2019s -- I got to the U.S. two years later than I was supposed to\nbecause of some foolish things that happened, but I -- at one point I was ruled to be that my --\nmy admission would be prejudicial to the best interests of the United States. F-Fortunately I-I\nprepared to prove that -- that 1t wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: When you arrived here, in New York, I assume.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What -- what were your first impressions? Do you remember what you thought?",
        "A: Well, I -- I arrived in Boston. I liked the uniforms of the Massachusetts State Police. That\u2019s\none of the first impressions. The second impression was I had about six dollars in my pocket. I\nhad not had a chance to eat bananas during the war, I had a great urge to eat bananas. And I just,\nwell, I can buy some. Went to a grocery store, still near the place where we had landed. Went to\nthe store -- and I had seven years of English in school, and I suddenly realized nobody had ever\ntaught me how to ask, how much are these bananas, because I had no idea whether they would be\n10 dollars a pound, or one dollar a pound, or 10 cents a pound, whatever. But this sort of\npractical question nobody had taught me, so I stood there like a fool, waiting for somebody to --\nto notice my plight and then explain myself. Anyway, I ate lots of bananas that summer.",
        "Q: Let me turn this over.",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape three, side B, of an interview with Professor Edward Anders on February 28\",\n1997.",
        "A: Okay. Well, one of my first impressions, of course, was New York City, which is unique.\nAnd we arrived there in -- in June, it was a good heat wave, which was also unique, a new\nexperience. There was -- the next experience was I found myself in the Catskills of all places, in\na-a very low budget vegetarian hotel belonging to a very distant relative, and I was pressed into\nservice as a waiter -- I was a lousy waiter, incidentally. And the problem was that this was a\nplace where people went to lose weight, who had -- people who had eaten more than enough all\nyear and they were delighted to be in a place where they were getting sort of low calorie diets.\nAnd -- and I had not really had too much to eat in Germany in the last two weeks or so in -- in\nthe camp before we -- and 1-in Bremerhaven before we got on the ship. The people there who ran\nthe camp realized that they could steal all the food they wanted, the -- the people who managed\nthe camp. That people, being this far along with the immigration process didn\u2019t want to make\nany waves and they wouldn\u2019t complain. So the food was very inadequate in -- in quantity and\nquality. On the ship most of us were seasick and couldn\u2019t eat. So we arrived in the U.S. and one\nthing I really wanted is lots of good food. Wrong place, this vegetarian place. Anyways, I\n[indecipherable] going to [indecipherable] anyway we -- people gave us fairly decent tips, it was,\nof course, a low budget hotel, but maybe by standards of posher places it [indecipherable]. But it\n-- it was enough for me then to pay th -- to pay tuition, I applied to several colleges and it turned\nout that for most of them I -- I was sort of neither fish nor fowl. I was too far along to qualify for\nan undergraduate degree, and I was not far enough along to -- to go to graduate school, the one\nplace that took me was Columbia. They had a big, sort of school of general studies, which was a\ncatchall for people going to night classes, or people that again, didn\u2019t fit the regular system, that\nthey want -- just wanted to look over. And then after first semester my grades were very good\nand so they were quite pleased to put me immediately into graduate school, and I was fine. One\nof my other strong impressions of the U.S., an early impression was -- is -- it was, d-during the\nKorean war, and Harry Truman had decided to sort of -- to take over the steel industry because\nthere was a strike. And it was during the war, he felt it was wrong to strike. And then a lowly\nU.S. district judge overruled him, and said it was illegal to intervene, the strike was legitimate.\nAnd to me this was a tremendously impressive demonstration of what the U.S. was all about, that\nin the European tradition it\u2019s unthinkable that a third level judge would rule against his president,\nespecially the president of the almighty United States. So that was really a wonderful object\nlesson. And there were many others, and there were quite a few things I liked about the U.S., and\nvery much impressed me, and you think living the U.S. makes you -- opens your eyes to a lot of\nthings that you previously weren\u2019t aware of, not that I approve of everything that goes on in the\nU.S., but it -- 1t was a -- a very great experience, and I was certainly very glad that I -- that I was\nallowed to come to the U.S..",
        "Q: Can you just very briefly kind of summarize your life after the war in terms of schooling,\nyour career, marriage, kids, just briefly summarize it for me.",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Schooling, I -- from my second semester on I was in graduate school, and was\nadmitted to the PhD. program, got a fellowship. I wasn\u2019t eligible for a government fellowship, so\nI got an industrial fellowship. Got a teaching assistantship, and managed to get my degree. My\nfirst academic job was at the University of Illinois. I thought all American universities were like\nColumbia. They weren\u2019t. Illinois was a very conservative place, run by old men, and they, in the\ndivision that I was in, they only had two kinds of faculty, those who had been there for 25 years\nor longer, and those who had been there for a year or less, nothing in between. And the young\nmen were sort of very much put in their place. It turns out I didn\u2019t have the right to choose the\ntextbook I wanted, the department chairman had written a textbook, and oh ye -- in principle I\nwas free to use it, but in practice I wasn\u2019t. And so on, there were a number of things that I didn\u2019t\nlike, so I was delighted after a year and a half, I got an offer from the University of Chicago,\nwhich was very much like Columbia in that respect, young faculty members had the same\nprivileges as old ones.",
        "Q: Your -- the area? What field?",
        "A: I was trained as a chemist, actually as a radio chemist, having to do with radioactivity, which\nis now an unpopular subject. And I -- while still a student, I fell in love with meteorites. I took a\ncourse in geochemistry and one day the professor brought some meteorites to class and passed\nthem around. And this was several years before Sputnik, before space travel and so on, and I was\nf -- th-thought it was tremendously romantic that here are these bits of rock or metal that come\nfrom hundreds of millions of miles away, from where no man has ever been, or had much hope\nof ever being. That were older than anything, any rock on the earth by quite a bit, and that you\ncould study in the laboratory and you could do measurements on, it would tell you something\nabout the origin of the solar system, the earliest [indecipherable] the earth. It was fascinating. I --\nI want to do work in this field. It was love at first sight, really. And unfortunately I had a tiger by\nthe tail, I had been -- somehow I had been persuaded by a Nobel laureate to look for one of the\nlast missing elements in nature. There were four holes in the periodic table where there ought to\nbe an element that hadn\u2019t yet been found, and some forms of this element had been produced\nartificially, but nothing had been found in nature, and he persuaded me that I should look for it\nby some modern techniques, that there was a good chance that the people that looked for it\nbefore had missed it. And so I -- I spent the next seven years on that, which was a wild goose\nchase. And I had to solve the problem one way or another, in the end I solved it when -- I had\nsome -- I kept getting experiments which suggested it -- th-that the results were not good enough\nto publish, and not bad enough to quit, always were in between. And finally I managed to repeat\nan experiment I\u2019d done earlier and show that the earlier data were wrong, that the new result,\nwhich was really negative, was hundred times more sensitive than the old one, and so completely\noverruled it and I felt that I was now a free man, I could work on meteorites. So I did that the rest\nof my life. And I worked on lunar rocks and various other things, and had a certain amount of\nrecognition, and I had fun. And th-the only good thing that happened at the University of Illinois\nis I met my wife. Both of us had just newly arrived, she was a Canadian who had just recently\nmoved to the U.S., she was a dietician at the girl\u2019s residence hall, and I was newly a-arrived\ninstructor. And there was Lincoln\u2019s birthday, which is a big deal in Illinois, of course. They had\na party for grad students, faculty and staff, and she went there as staff, I went there as faculty. It\nwas a dance, I sort of looked over the girls that had -- were there, and decided none of them were\ninteresting, so I positioned myself near the door to intercept any good looking ones that came in,\nso I -- I -- before anybody else got to them. Anyway, I did intercept her, and the rest is -- is\nhistory. And we had two children, and -- and a very happy marriage. My mother turned out to be\nextremely difficult, because she had focused all her emotions on me. I was the only survivor, and\nas a psychiatrist later explained to me that I had fu-fulfilled all the roles of son and husband and\nprotector and whatnot. And she kept saying for years that she wanted me to get married, but\nwhen it actually came to it she was very much against it. Also, she had suddenly ha -- she had\nalso really detached herself pretty well from Judaism, but when the time came to talk about the\nwedding and so on, she suddenly rediscovered her roots, objected to any kind of a church\nwedding. My wife is Presbyterian, and so my mother was -- was very difficult and we had\nendless troubles with her. She lived with us, we had -- I felt that all the years we\u2019d lived together,\ncontrary to all the advice you normally get, can\u2019t very well push her out. And then, at one point\nshe attempted suicide. She went -- went to the psychiatric ward of the hospital and was under\npsychiatric treatment for quite awhile. I paid all the bills and so on. And -- and gradually we\nreached an accommodation, but we never knew where we stood, because she was schizophrenic,\nand part of the time she was a very charming, very sweet person, and parts of the time she was\njust a paranoid devil. And it continued like this, she made life especially difficult for our\ndaughter, was a very dear child. As one psychiatrist explained, that she hates women in general.\nShe hates my wife, she hated my daughter. It\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s -- don\u2019t quite know why, but it -\n- it was a problem. When she began to get Alzheimer\u2019s, many people have a personality change\nfor the worse, hers was for the better, she became very mellow, we could do no wrong. The early\nstages of Alzheimer\u2019s, no matter what we did, it was fine, it was -- she was at peace with herself.\nBut it was not easy. But it -- in a way it -- it made my -- my wife and me closer, and also it --\nperhaps the experiences were -- were traumatic for my -- my daughter, she went through a stage\nwhere she was anorectic and so on and she needed counseling, but she\u2019s -- she\u2019s fine now. But\nmy mother had treated her quite badly and my -- my wife insisted the children had to see the\ngrandmother every Saturday morning and not realizing what kind of mental torture my daughter\nwas going through, especially. So anyway, that\u2019s past. But I\u2019ve had a happy life, I worked very\nhard all my life, but I had a happy life in the U.S.. Relations to Judaism, so very gradually sort of\ncooled off in the sense that, I have good Jewish friends, but I don\u2019t have any ties to the religion.\nWe raised our children -- of course there had to be some sort of compromises with my mother,\nbut the understanding was that they would not be baptized. They were told about their\nbackground early on. We lived in a neighborhood of the university where it was actually a matter\nof prestige to be a Jew. And so they have no hang-ups about their background and we felt that\nthey should choose for themselves, and whatever they chose would be fine with us. As it\nhappened, I think one married a Catholic, the other one married a Protestant. But they are not\nparticularly ashamed of their background, they can talk freely about it. And to me this, of course,\nhas -- brings up the question that I asked myself many years ago. When this outstanding German\narchitect who I met during the war, when he said he would not consider it unfortunate if the\nGerman people ceased to exist as a nation after the war. Said, they have done so m -- so many\nbad things as a nation, he said he doesn\u2019t want the individual people to be destroyed, but if they\nceased to [indecipherable] as a nation it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. And to me this was a bit shocking,\nbut then over the years I\u2019ve asked myself -- nationalism has caused a lot of problems in this\nworld, and each nation, each group should ask itself, what are the quintessential qualities that we\nwant to preserve? In Judaism I think there is the respect for learning, which has been extremely\nimportant. The strong sense of justice and of siding with the underdog, which again is very\nadmirable. The Jewish sense of humor. There -- there are a number of qualities and they really\nshould be universal qualities. Maybe the Jews have a special sort of aptitude for it, the special\nresponsibility to propagate these qualities and I\u2019m glad in a way that there\u2019s a state of Israel and\nJews no longer have to be pushed around, and so on, and it -- it\u2019s only proper that those who feel\nuncomfortable where they\u2019re living, that they should be able to move to Israel and -- and live in a\n100 percent Jewish society. But to some extent I must say, I was -- I -- the Holocaust has left its\nscars. The -- I did not want my children to be -- ever to go through it again. I\u2019ve occasionally\nasked myself, could another Hitler arise in the U.S.? I\u2019ve -- I first asked myself this question\nbefore my children were born. And I saw a movie, \u201cJudgment at Nuremberg\u2019, and my wife and I\nsort of went for a long, long walk after, late in the night after the movie and we asked ourself,\nwhat is it that prevents the U.S. from getting a Hitler? And I realized one thing is a free press,\nand another one is an outspoken intelligentsia. And that\u2019s very important, when we have\nsomebody like Nixon and so on, there was no lack of protest from the intelligentsia, from the\npress. We sometimes get annoyed at the press, but as long as we have a free press, there is hope.\nOne can go on philosophizing about this theme, but m-my own feeling toward religion is I don\u2019t\nlike to associate with any foreign religion. In my research, of course, I have a fair amount to do\nwith astronomy, and to me looking at the sky 1s one of the most -- night sky, is one of the most\nreligious experiences. Just to realize that -- the vastness of the universe, and to read about\nbiology and to just know how intricately designed organisms are. And I am not taking sides\nwhether there was a -- God created various living forms and so on, or whether this all, you know,\nis just by evolution, what role God, or some combination of both, I think it\u2019s just -- nature is a\nvery wonderful place, and I find it perfectly possible to believe in a deity that presides over it all,\nmaybe with minimal intervention. I have trouble believing in a personal God that is -- is petty\nand keeps track of how many times a day I say my prayers and so forth. And I-I\u2019m -- \u2019m\ncomfortable with that. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s certainly not conventional Judaism, and I\u2019m not sure that it\ndeserves any label.",
        "Q: But that ta -- ta -- your brand of faith grew out of your experiences.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I mean, had the war not happened, you would have -- could have still been worshipping daily\nin Latvia.",
        "A: Probably not. I was 13 -- of course at bar -- Bar Mitzvah, I did this from 13 to 15, and I think\nI have grown a lot since, I\u2019ve asked myself a lot of questions. Also, someday I would have had to\ncome to terms why my father didn\u2019t belong to the temple, and just what was the proper dose of\nreligion, the proper form of religion. I mean it -- so long as you were treated as -- as a -- as a Jew,\nas a almost foreign element by society, well if society defines you as -- as -- as a Jew, then you\ndon\u2019t have much choice, you -- you make the best of it. But Judaism, of course, as I learned only\nafter leaving Latvia, that there are many brands of Judaism, Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and\nso on. I find a lot of -- a lot of appealing elements in Reform Judaism. But for awhile I would\nactually go to -- to some churches and go to some temples and so on and I would listen. And the\none thing I found myself looking for was humility. And really the only place I found it was at the\nUnitarian church. Now, I haven\u2019t s -- set foot in a Unitarian church in decades and I can\u2019t\nproperly call myself a Unitarian, but there was humility and tolerance, and a sort of attitude,\nwell, we are not all sure we have the right answers. We have no dogma. We are all trying to get\nto the same place, perhaps by different routes, and think we\u2019re -- one definition 1s reverent\nagnosticism. And I go to a Protestant church and I find this us versus them, and we have a\nmonopoly on the right religion. I go to a Jewish temple, I hear the same thing. And to me there is\nso much we don\u2019t know, and I think it\u2019s wonderful to believe in a God, but even that should be\noptional. But then to start with precise attributes of the God, and -- and precise dogmas and so\nforth, especially if it\u2019s that we have the right answers and all the other people are wrong, I find\nthis more and more objectionable, and that would have hit me even if I s-stayed in Latvia.",
        "Q: When you were in tight spots during the war, did you pray?",
        "A: Actually, I still do. Though I didn\u2019t pray when I was in -- well, I suppose I must have prayed a\nfew times when I was in tight spots, but I don\u2019t -- I-I don\u2019t think that I prayed in the sen -- I don\u2019t\nthink I prayed in the sense that I expected -- I was in a tight spot and I expected my prayer to\nresult in -- in a quick solution to my problem.",
        "Q: But you prayed because it was a comfort, because you needed to do something.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And your mother carried this prayer book with her, but that was probably sentimental as\nmuch as religious, I would think.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Well, yes, wa -- she\u2019s na -- I th -- think with -- with her it was -- it was both. She\ncertainly read the prayer book and she would get some comfort from it.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a few other things. When you were living through the war years, did you find\nhaving your mother with you a source of strength, or a responsibility that made things more\ndifficult for you?",
        "A: Mainly, I would say a source of strength. There were times when I felt that we had to do\nsomething. For instance, I decided that we had to get out of Latvia, and she didn\u2019t want to for\nawhile, and she got -- she didn\u2019t want me to get th-the famous I.D. card for her. There were\ncertain decisions where we had to argue things out and of course it was a little difficult for her to\naccept that this -- this child has now grown up to be a young man and maybe he has more\n[indecipherable] than -- than I do. So we were a team. We did have our occasional friction, but as\nlong as there were just the two of us, and bef-before my wife appeared in the picture and so on\nthere, we generally managed to straighten things out.",
        "Q: When you got over here to the United States, did you finally feel safe, did you trust everyone,\nor is that something that\u2019s -- one has to learn gradually -- relearn?",
        "A: To me a very natural attitude is to -- to consider everybody a gentleman til he or she proves to\nbe the contrary. And so trusting people is still natural to me. I think I wouldn\u2019t carry it to\nridiculous extremes, and I tend to be rather aloof and -- and sort of a bit buttoned up. My mother\nwould sit down at the park bench next to a person and within five minutes they were telling each\nother their life stories. And she thought it was just wonderful if the other person told their life\nstory. My mother actually didn\u2019t want to talk about her Jewish background and her experiences,\nso on, but she loved it when people opened up to her, and she wouldn\u2019t reciprocate. She resented\nbeing quizzed and so forth. I -- I am not that sort of person at all. I think I mentioned to you that\nthey\u2019re only -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve told my wartime experiences to only about a dozen people outside\nfamily in 55 years, including a number of close friends I\u2019ve never -- never told them about. They\nknow of my Jewish background, but somehow I didn\u2019t really feel that I need to entertain them\nwith a rather bizarre story.",
        "Q: Have you thought about what sorts of long term impact these experiences have had on your\nlife, had on the way you\u2019 ve lived it, you raised your kids, or just on your personality? You\u2019ve\nspoken a bit about your relationship with your mother, and your mother and your wife --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but aside from that?",
        "A: I think it has taught me not to generalize about people, and th-there are really two factors that\npushed me in that direction. One of them was that before the German occupation, we thought\nthat just because my -- my father was a very decent businessman, he had some letters from his\nGerman customers commending him for having warned them about some unfair practices of\nsome -- some other business people, that no matter what -- whether there were any legitimate\ncomplaints that the anti-Semites had about certain Jews, that my father had a-a-an excellent\nrecord and that he would be treated accordingly, that they would not -- not treat everybody the\nsame regardless of what you -- you\u2019ve done as a person. And similarly Germans, I\u2019ve learned\nvery quickly that there were some -- some awful Germans, some monsters, and there were some\nangels, and lots of in between, and -- and the same with Latvians. And so I began to realize that\nit\u2019s absolutely wrong to generalize. I -- I don\u2019t like to say the Germans, or the -- the Jews, or the\nLat-Latvians. I tend to view people as individuals. So that\u2019s one important lesson that I learned.\nAnd the other thing is that I feel that sort of ethnic religious labels are some of the less important\ndescriptives of a person. The story that I like that illustrates this very well, a number of years\nago, there was a conductor named Dean Dixon, an American. When he first gave a concert in\nEurope -- he spent much of his career in Europe, the newspapers would write about the\nAmerican Negro conductor, Dean Dixon. After the second concert it was the American\nconductor Dean Dixon. After the third one it was the conductor Dean Dixon. They should have\nstarted with the third concert right away, because to s-size up Dean Dixon the most important\nthing is a conductor. He was a good conductor, he was a mediocre conductor but he obviously\nknows a lot about music and so on. Prefers certain kinds of music and so on. It\u2019s less important\nthat he is Am-American, music 1s fairly universal. Still less important that he is black. In the end\nall of these factors have to be considered, but they went at them in the reverse order. And I want\nto be known primarily as -- as Edward Anders, who has done such and such with his life, done\nsome good things and some bad things, made some mistakes, had certain quirks and so forth. I\nhave [indecipherable] done research in certain area, I\u2019ve done this or that, and it\u2019s considerably\nless important that -- that I am an American, or that I\u2019m a Jew by birth. So, to me these are less\nim-important because there\u2019s such a tremendous variety of Americans, there\u2019s such a tremendous\nvariety of Jews, and to start with either my American citizenship or my Jewish background and\nput that as the number one label on me, I -- I think it\u2019s putting the cart before the horse.",
        "Q: How else do you think these experiences have affected you?",
        "A: Strangely enough, not all that much in the sense of long term or short term damage. The only\nrecognizable quirk that I have is I don\u2019t like anybody barging into my bedroom in the middle of\nthe night, and we had to train our children when they had a bad dream they were welcome to run,\nbut to our bedroom door, and they could knock, or they could otherwise make -- make a sound,\nwe had the intercom anyway, to their rooms, but they were not to barge into the bedroom. They\ngrew up normally in spite of this restriction.",
        "Q: And you told them, at some point, about all your experiences, or --",
        "A: Yeah, I think when -- when they\u2019re s-small you don\u2019t go into un-unnecessary detail, it\u2019s just\nthis is a rule and that\u2019s it. And since then, of course, they\u2019ve learned t-to -- little by little.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s interesting that in all this time you\u2019ve s -- you\u2019ve spoken about this so little. Maybe\npeople don\u2019t talk about where they\u2019ve come from, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s something you\u2019ve\nbeen reluctant to share.",
        "A: Yes. It is a hang-up. It\u2019s -- e-even today I behave in some ways a little lit -- bit like a child\nthat does not speak until it\u2019s spoken to. My wife and I are very close, we share a lot. And when\nI\u2019ve read something interesting, I sort of wait for her to ask me, did you read anything interesting\ntoday, and then I tell her. My excuse is that I want to make sure that she\u2019s really prepared to\nlisten, that she\u2019s -- she\u2019s ready, that she doesn\u2019t have other things in -- in her mind. And with\nthese wartime experiences, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s that factor and perhaps also that it\u2019s something highly\npersonal. It\u2019s quite far back, it hasn\u2019t really changed my personality all that much as far as I can\ntell. And as I mentioned in my written notes that I -- I\u2019m rather thin-skinned and I have a fairly\nshort temper, I\u2019m impatient and when I look back I had all these traits before the war, so I can\u2019t\nblame them on the war. Well, in that case, I probably would be a fairly similar person if I hadn\u2019t\nbeen through these experiences, if I had been born in the U.S., for example. Well, in that case it\u2019s\nno longer an important de-descriptor of my personality or of me.",
        "Q: Are you more demanding of your -- are you demanding of your children? Were you\nprotective of your children?",
        "A: ?'m a bit of -- more than a bit of a perfectionist. I try to be understanding. I had fairly high\nexpectations and I\u2019ve realized subsequently that some were a little too high. And my daughter\nonce reminded me that she called me from college and she said she got three A\u2019s and a B and I\n[indecipherable] to ask her what\u2019s the B for? I would not do that again.

        "Q: Are there any -- I sort of want to finish with that, are there any circumstances that kind of\nbring back and evoke your earlier experiences in a -- in a profound way for you? Are there any\nlasting images, are there any --",
        "A: I can remember a lot of the -- the circumstances I told you about I can remember quite\nvividly, I can remember the scene in the prison, and -- with the guard asked us for our watches, I\nknow exactly where the German policeman stood and was calling out names. A | -- lot of these\nimages are very vivid, the things that I described to you. And sometimes even some secondary\nevents about the same time than an -- also -- wh-which were not painful or dangerous or\nanything, I can also remember. They don\u2019t exactly haunt me. I did have to come to terms a little\nbit with it when I read Ezergailis\u2019 book in the last few months. When I came to the detailed\ndescriptions of the executions and so on, there was one night I had a little trouble going to sleep\nand I -- when I wake up early -- and I\u2019m a bit of an insomniac, then again I couldn\u2019t go back to\nsleep because I kept thinking of this. So during the weeks that I worked on my talk and my paper\nfor the seminar, let\u2019s say that I did get a little less sleep. But it\u2019s not -- was not to the point of\ngiving me nightmares or otherwise dominating my sleep --",
        "Q: There are, over the years, certain images that have stuck with you in an uncomfortable way,\nor --",
        "A: No, nothing has haunted me, just that I can bring them back a-at will, and if I so occupied\nmyself too intensely with them, yes, then they will probably bother me a little more than they --\nthan -- than is good for me. But as long as I don\u2019t bring them up myself, they don\u2019t haunt me. I --\nI\u2019m supposed to have a fairly good memory, which was very helpful in -- in my research, but --\nand of course it\u2019s not as good now as it used to be. I can remember a lot of detail, but it -- I can\u2019t\nsay that it torments me.",
        "Q: Then -- and it\u2019s -- and you -- once you assumed a new life here, you didn\u2019t dwell on it much.\nYou didn\u2019t think about it too much?",
        "A: No, there are other things to -- to keep you occ -- nowadays I talk a lot with my wife about\nthis. I dredge up little details, something I\u2019d forgotten, so on, and I talk to her about it and she\u2019s\nalways interested, and occasionally I add it to my notes.",
        "Q: But this is -- but this 1s recent, what you\u2019re talking about --",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: -- you know, for the last 35 years or so , this was not something that you paid much attention\nto.",
        "A: No. We -- it was part of my life, but it was there with -- with -- along with some other parts. I\ndidn\u2019t try to -- to run away from it. And -- but at the same time, I have seen a lot of things, done\na lot of things, and yes, this is perhaps different from everything else because it involved\nconsiderable danger to me. But may -- you -- you been through it and you file it away in the\nproper place, you know where to find it when you need it. The -- the file drawers don\u2019t pop open\nspontaneously.",
        "Q: When di -- you just said but you -- you know when to sort of call on it when you need it.\nWhat sort of circumstances would make you need it?",
        "A: Well, when I talk to somebody, either family, if my daughter is interested in -- 1n some detail,\nmy wife, or this history professor, he wants to know more about it, then -- then I -- I try to\nremember additional detail, occasionally things come back. And certainly you asked a number of\ngood questions, and I sort of tried to --",
        "Q: You tried.",

        "A: No, I think we\u2019ve covered a fair amount of ground. This -- you ask very good questions.",
        "Q: What I\u2019d like to do -- I thank you for your time -- is ask you about some of the documents --",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and pull them out.",
        "A: The first one is my school I.D., and -- when I was 14 years old, and this served as my I.D.\nafter the war in Czechoslovakia for a few months, because it was not in German and didn\u2019t have\nan eagle on it. Unfortunately the beautiful German I.D. with the eagle, I -- was-was one of the\nthings that I tore up after the war. I was afraid that the -- the Czechs might decide that I had a\nstronger connection with Nazi Germany than -- than was safe to have. The next item is my\nmother\u2019s Latvian passport. There, the interesting part 1s first of all that she had a -- a double\nsurname, Scheftelovich-Leventals, as maiden name, both of which were Jewish, and there was\nalso at one time there was a -- a Jewish first name, Rachel, which I took out with sodium\nhypochlorite, and the others had to be Aryanized, and -- which I succeeded in doing when I\napplied for her I.D. card in 1944, and ended up with a girl that was quite willing to let me dictate\nto her which parts of the personal information to copy and which one not to. Then here is a -- a --\nthe letter from the Herman Goering works, which merely certify that my mother had -- had\nworked there in the office for a year, and that she -- |-lately her health had suffered beca -- by the\ndeath of her oldest son to the point where she no longer was able to carry out her duties. This\nwas written less than a month after my brother died. And the -- the funny thing about this 1s of\ncourse that is the small purchasing office that was -- had the -- the name of Herman Goering on\nit, that may have given rise to these weird rumors about us having a connection with Herman\nGoering. Here are the two affidavits which should really be translated verbatim, of those two\nkind ladies that th-then -- that testified that they had known for many years that my mother was -\n- was really an Aryan, a Christian. And in -- in one case I think it\u2019s es-especially noteworthy that\nmy mother barely knew the woman who -- who wrote this and she was a mother of our neighbor,\nwho ha -- sh -- we had also known for only two years, that people still were willing to perjure\nthemselves and take considerable risks by certifying that we had -- that my mother was -- was\nGentile. Here is the police registration in -- in Karlsbad where, for the first time since the war, I\ngave as my nationality Jew. And it\u2019s -- asks here, nationality before an-and after October 10\",\n1938, of course it was Jew both times. They didn\u2019t ask what I was in between. Here is an -- an\noddity, the Federation of the Liberated Latvian Jews, they wrote a letter saying that I was the in -\n- their -- I was employed in their war crimes department and therefore it was important that I am\nable to continue this work. This happened at the time when the Haganah was actively recruiting\nmembers for this Jewish army, just before the 1 -- and during the Independence War in Israel.\nAnd since I had no intention of emigrating to Israel, I felt that really it\u2019s -- I shouldn\u2019t be asked\nto go and fight for Israel. The rest of the documents are self-explanatory. There is one document\nin Latvian, dating from the mid-30\u2019s, which only -- which certifies that my -- my father was\nrecorded in the -- in the Jewish birth register of 1897, and [indecipherable] document dated 1934.\nThe rest is straightforward and doesn\u2019t require any comment.",

        "Q: Wasn\u2019t there ever a point when being a half Jew wasn\u2019t good enough? I mean, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s\nkind of amazing to me.",
        "Q: Right, but you -- it sounds like, if I\u2019m understanding you correctly, you were dealing with not\nonly Latvian officials, but -- but German officials as well?",
        "Q: Was it your understanding at the time that the local population was also quite involved in a lot\nof these -- the killings?",
        "Q: When the Latvians worked as -- you know, administrators, or --",

        "Q: -- that must have been a difficult decision, or --",
        "Q: Did it occur to you not to do it?",

        "Answer: I\u2019m Edward Anders. My birth name was Edward Alperovich. I was born on June 21\",\n1926 in Libau, Latvia with the Latvian name of the place 1s Liepaja.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. My father, whose name was -- was Adolf, nothing -- no relation to the notorious\nAdolf, wa-was a businessman, he had inherited a grain export business from his father. And in\naddition to that he had a -- a partnership 1n a grain mill, and for awhile he also had leased a\nnumber of movie theaters, which was very nice for us because we could go to the movies for\nfree. And he -- h-he was fairly wealthy, but the depression affected his business a lot and the\nincome went way down and we found it necessary to move into a much smaller apartment,\nactually in the house of my grandmother. And so we had to live on a very limited budget for a\nnumber of years during the depression years. My mother was a v -- a very attractive woman. Her\nparents had -- well, her f-father was born in Libau, her mother actually came from Mitau, which\nwas the capital of the former Duchy of Courland, and her family, I think, had lived in Latvia for\nquite a few generations. My mother was the youngest of three daughters, had -- they also had a\nson. Her father, again, was fairly prosperous before World War I, but then, with the German\ntroops advancing into Latvia, decided to flee to Saint Petersburg, and somehow during the war\nand revolution, managed to lose all his money, so he came back almost penniless, and somehow\nthe -- the family never recovered, th-they lived rather modestly. Okay, about my childhood, yes,\nin the early years, we lived in a -- in a comfortable apartment, my brother and I each had a -- a\ngoverness, and as -- which was the custom in those days. Our family was somewhat Germanized,\nlike many of the e-educated Jews in -- in Courland and sort of western Latvia. My parents had\ngone to Russian schools so they would often speak Russian to one another when they didn\u2019t want\nus children to understand. But the rest of time we all spoke German. And I never learned to\nspeak Yiddish. My father could, my -- my mother could also speak it, but not quite as fluently.\nAnd we -- my -- my brother was t -- his name was George, was two years old than I. My father\nwas rather partial to his oldest son, which of -- in the early years was a bit of a problem for me,\nbut in -- eventually, I think shortly before he died, he began to treat us equally. Okay, maybe you\ncan ask me another question.",
        "A: My mother was fairly religious. We certainly observed the major holidays, usually went to\nour grandparents or had a Seder in our own house. Usually at the grandparents. My father, for\nsome reason, had quit the Jewish temple, it -- 1t doesn\u2019t mean that he totally abandoned the\nreligion, there -- I think there were some quasi-political differences. My paternal grandfather\nactually was a -- a gabbai of the local temple was apparently a highly regarded member of the\ncongregation. And then when -- as -- as I approached the Bar Mitzvah -- both my brother and I\nhad Bar Mitzvah and for me that\u2019s -- marked the beginning of a religious period, and I was --\nwas very religious, said all the prayers and did all the right things and so on. That process was s -\n- \u00a7 -- stopped by the war.",
        "A: No, the community was relatively large, 1t was about 12 percent of the population of town,\nmaybe se -- 7,000 people. I was v -- during my religious phase I certainly went to the temple on\nho -- high holidays and possibly some of the lesser holidays. We also celebrated Succos, for\nexample, and Purim. But I was too young to be involved in the religious life and my father\nsimply wouldn't participate in it.",
        "A: I -- the first school I went to was a German school. The -- at that time -- it was 1931, I think,\nthe street signs in Latvia were still in three languages, Latvian, German and Russian and German\nwas still -- a-and both German and Russian were still considered acceptable languages, although\nthe Latvian government emphasi -- tried to emphasize Latvian. We went to a German school,\nand then [indecipherable] I stayed there until spring of \u201932. Hitler had not yet come to power in\nGermany, but it was clearly -- he was on the rise, and there was a perception that anti-Semitism\nwas going to get worse in Germany, and in the German community, so my parents decided to\ntake me out of there. They also decided to put me in a Latvian public school. I understand that\nonly about 10 percent of the Jewish children went to Latvian schools, the others went to -- to na -\n- Jewish schools. I was quite aloof, found it difficult to make friends. I never had more than two\nclose friends. Often they were -- were Latvian, because there were relatively few Jewish children\nin the school and I\u2019m not sure I would have given them preference anyway. But in -- especially\nin -- in high school my -- the last two years that I went to school, my -- my best friend actually\nwas Jewish. I should say something about him, per-perhaps later on.",
        "A: Yes, usually I had some Latvian friends and since I had very few friends, they generally were\nthe close friends. So I did have a fair amount of contact with them. The neighbors again, I don\u2019t\nthink we had any Jewish neighbors in the building, or perhaps there were some next door, but I --\nI don\u2019t remember any. So we had contact mainly with -- with Latvians. But my father, of course,\nhad a lot of business contacts with the local Jewish community and my wife -- my -- not my\nwife, my mother had s-some Jewish friends as well as a number of -- of Gentile friends.",
        "A: I\u2019ve sort of been giving myself a push lately to think about it and try to remember it. And the\nworst thing that I can remember happened to me in school, all the years that I went to a Latvian\nschool, is that a few times one of the other boys would f-fold a piece of cloth so it remember --\nresemb -- remem -- sorry, resembled a pig\u2019s ear and sort of pointed it at me as if to taunt me that\nI was a Jew and we were not allowed to -- to eat pork. And that was the worst thing that ever\nhappened to me. I don\u2019t recall ever being called bad names, or getting into fights because I was\nJewish. Children generally are -- tend to be fairly cruel and s-s -- I\u2019m s -- tend to torment\nminorities, but I experienced very little of that. And my general perception was, a-again, in part\ntriggered by Ezergailis\u2019 book, who tries to show that Latvia wasn\u2019t any more anti-Semitic than\nother European countries. Frankly, from all the details I remember, I must give him right. And\none of the anti-Semitic actions I do remember is that my father\u2019s grain mill was nationalized with\ninadequate compensation, and I thought this was of an anti-Jewish act. Ezergailis points out that\nactually a number of non-Jewish businesses were also nationalized, and the intent was not so\nmuch to drive the Jews out of business, because in some branches the Jews were left unmolested.\nIt\u2019s just that the government, which patterned itself Mussolini\u2019s Italy, wanted to sort of nati -- to\nget state ownership of certain branches of business and industry. And if there happened to be\nsome Jewish companies in the way, they were nationalized. And in other areas, where they didn\u2019t\nseem to care at -- at the time, they left the Jews alone.",
        "A: The Latvian government, yes, yes, we\u2019re still in this, the pre-war era. So the anti-Semitism\ndefinitely was -- was not bad, and I think another fact is, of course that a number of German\nJewish refugees came to Latvia and established themselves and felt reasonably comfortable.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: We were quite well informed. We would regularly listen to -- to the BBC, to German\nbroadcasts and we -- as long as it was possible we subscribed to a Swiss political weekly that wa\n-- called the [indecipherable], which at that time was quite famous for being anti-Nazi, and the\neditor-in-chief was very outspoken and very critical of Hitler and we sort of enjoyed reading his\neditorials just because he would mince no words. And I thought we were quite well informed,\nuntil 19 -- June 1940 when of course the -- the s -- Soviets took over Latvia and cut off the\nsupply of foreign newspapers. We also subscribed to some German magazines. So I think we\nwere well informed, but we heard only a few sporadic reports about atrocities, even after the\noutbreak of the war in Poland, and the famous [indecipherable] Kristallnacht, and of course that\nwas supposed to be in retaliation for the assassination of a German diplomat, and we did hear\nthere were excesses. But we didn\u2019t realize how many killings there had been, we heard about\nproperty damage and so forth. And we thought, well this is sort of an isolated incident, it\u2019s a\nshame that it happened. But somehow we weren\u2019t prepared to change my family\u2019s and many\nother Jew\u2019s perception of ger -- of the Germans being basically fair. Maybe they were very strict\nwith Jews, they were depriving them of some civil rights, but we thought that by and large there\nwas -- you pretty much got what you deserved. We thought that they would be discriminating in\ntheir treatment of -- of Jews, Jews who in their eyes had conducted themselves badly, or had\nharmed German interests would of -- would of course be persecuted, and Jews that had been --\nhad not done so would presumably be judged on their merits. Th-That -- that was the notion we\nhad, and I think there is perhaps another indication of that, that when the w -- the war broke out,\nand Germany attacked Russia, only about a quarter of the Jews from Latvia fled with the\nRussians. In my family, out of 27 people, only two fled. The o -- the others all stayed, which\nmeans they felt that th-the Germans were the lesser evil. So we -- there was just a further factor,\nnamely the Latvian government was trying to keep good relations with both the Soviet Union\nand Nazi Germany, and this means that they purposely suppressed any kind of derogatory,\nunfavorable news about th-the Germans an-and the Russians, so we didn\u2019t learn as much about\nsome of the atrocities were going on in -- say in Poland, a-as we should have. And -- but BBC\nagain didn\u2019t report anything, so we -- we had the impression that there were just some small\nscale atrocities, but nothing major, and sort of isolated. And furthermore, the final solution had\nnot yet started, because there certainly wasn\u2019t -- th-the systematic large scale killing of Jews only\nstarted with the attack on Russia.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, the first encounter with the Russians came on October \u201939, when under the Molotov-\nRibbentrop Pact, they demanded military bases from the Latvian government, including a large\nbase in my hometown, which had been the principle naval port of the Tsarist empire. In fact, the\nRussian navy that -- th-the fleet that sailed around -- halfway around the world to fight the\nJapanese in the Russian Japanese war of 1904 started in Libau. So, they had a large -- established\na large Russian garrison in -- in Libau and the town was full of Russian soldiers, and in the f -- as\na kid, at first it\u2019s a little exciting to see all these strange uniforms and so on, but we soon learned\nthat these were really quite unwelcome people. The population I -- I had a summer job at the\ntime and -- at a carpenter\u2019s shop, and some of the workers were rather pleased, they were --\nLibau was a somewhat leftist town and the workers, well [indecipherable] sort of glad that they\nnow the -- the workers are going to own everything, and the government will -- will take from\nthe rich and give to the poor and so forth. So a number of them were sympathetic. I met some of\nthese same workers months later and they were furious because they realized that all these\npromises had been broken with -- they were -- for example, there were signs up in the streetcars,\njust, the streetcars now belong to you. Well hell, you still had to pay. And all -- all the other\nthings, practically everything in the economy had changed for the worse and all these promises\nsimply had not been delivered. And a large part of the reason for that was that Latvia was part of\nEurope and had a much higher living standard than Russia. And so when it was annexed to -- to\nRussia, they had to level everything. And the way they did it is they raised prices to s -- to Soviet\nlevels and they raised -- which in some cases was 10 to 30 fold, and they raised wages maybe\ndouble or so, but in -- in -- the net effect was still that the purchasing power, it was very much\nless. And in turns -- for the Russian soldiers this was still paradise. They would sort of --\ncrowded the shops and buy everything they c -- they saw for their rubles. So the disenchantment\nset in very quickly with many people, but there still was a hard core of Latvians, and I wou --\nmust -- must say also, a number of Jews who in the past had leftist political sympathies, either\nsocial democrats, who were, of course, banned at the time, or -- and were the enemies of both the\nLatvian government and the communists, or communists. Those people were glad they s -- their\nexcuse was well maybe things are not working perfectly, cause we\u2019re building a New World\norder and -- and creating a new type of man, Soviet man and everything is going to be alright and\nit\u2019s going to be much better than you could ever dream of. So these people were still true\nbelievers, but a lot of people were disenchanted. And certainly we were, because we were the\nbourgeois, as they would call them, we were s-suddenly the enemies of -- class enemies. The\nRussians expropriated my father\u2019s business. He was a-allowed to keep his debts, but he -- all the\nassets were taken away from him. And in general there were lots of restrictions. For instance,\nthey decreed that every person was entitled to only nine square meters of living space, with some\nsort of allowances for -- which means most people had to -- to sublet -- to rent rooms to their\napartments. And there were some allowances made if -- if you rented or -- a room that was\naccessible only through another room, then this other room didn\u2019t count fully, you could still\nkeep that because you lost your privacy, your roomer would always walk through that other\nroom. So we were forced to rent our -- a couple of rooms in our apartment. And as it turned out\nth -- these were two people from the border guards, which was a branch of the Russian security\napparatus that was not identical to but closely allied to the KGB, and they were later involved in\ndeportation. One of the men was -- was actually a Jew, Kleinman, and he moved out after\nawhile. And the other one was a -- an ethnic Russian from -- from Latvia. Sort of a young, rather\ninnocuous looking man who sort of rent the apartment, and was just w-wearing civilian clothes\nand then one day instead of opening the door with his key, about a month or two later he rang the\ndoorbell, and my mother opened the door and she saw this large man in a Russian major\u2019s\nuniform and at first she didn\u2019t recognize him, she was scared. He was proudly showing off his\nnew uniform. Well, he is actually the man who saved us from deportation to Russia. What\nhappened is that a week before the outbreak of the German Russian war, the Russians went to a\nnumber of homes in the middle of the night, sort of got the people out of bed, told them get\ndressed, pack your -- your bags, and come with us, get on the truck. And the next morning we\nfound out that a lot of wealthy families, including a fair number of Jews had been deported. And\nso we thought, well, by class and so on, by our status, we were very likely to be included, and\nbefore long there was a phone call saying don\u2019t leave the house, pack your bags and wait, we\u2019 ll\ncome for you. So we -- we packed, we did as we were told, and of course we weren\u2019t at all happy\nabout the prospect, and then we realized that our roomer had not come home that night, he was\nout rounding up people, he was one of the leaders in this aktion. So when he finally came home,\nmy mother went to see him and asked if he could take us off the list. And he sort of joked and\nteased first, well don\u2019t you want to go to a sa -- to a great s -- Socialist Motherland, or whatever\nhe called it, and my mother answered diplomatically, well it\u2019s interesting [indecipherable] we\u2019re\nquite happy here, we\u2019d rather stay here. And so he did manage to take us off the list and so for\nthe moment we were saved. But this, of course, this event, this mass deportation is what -- as the\nGermans subsequently exploited a lot to arouse population against the Jews, but I presume we\u2019 ll\ncome to that a little later.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: At my level religious practices were not affected. I don\u2019t know whether any pressure was put\non the Jewish congregations, but I wasn\u2019t aware of it. School, I was still allowed to stay, but\ncertainly I was of -- invisibly marked in the eyes of my fellow students, I was a bourgeois. And\nw-we -- I had a compulsory political education class, and of course there were tirades against the\nbourgeoisie, Marxism, Leninism, all this garbage. But this didn\u2019t really affect the way my fellow\nclassmates treated me. They sensed that -- well, they were for the most part unhappy with the\nRussians. We had one real communist in class, and the others were unhappy to varying degrees,\nand they realized that I was unhappy too, so we -- we made common cause, there was no tension,\nthey didn\u2019t hold me responsible as a Jew f-for the communist occupation and so on. It -- it didn\u2019t\nreally affect me.",
        "A: Almost exactly one year. They marched into -- in Latvia fanned out from there and crossed\nthe border in June of 1940, and then 1 -- 1 -- a year later almost to the day came these deportations\nand another week later the Germans attacked. M-Maybe I sh -- I should mention a little bit about\nthese -- these days. I ha-had a summer job in the city construction office, a-and on -- one day\nbefore the German attack, I-I was working on some project, and I was told the morning by my\nboss, stop whatever you\u2019re doing, we have something very urgent and -- and I and some of the\nother apprentices who were working there, were -- were told then to run off as many copies as\nwe could of some drawings for sort of air raid shelters, that were actually really trenches, very\nprimitive, like the fallout shelters that were built in the U.S.. And a-all day there was a sort of\nhustle and bustle with people coming and going and picking up copies. So apparently -- I\nrealized the next morning when the -- we heard about the attacks on -- on the radio, I realized\nwhy I was made to work late that day and why we suddenly worked on these air raid shelter\nplans. That apparently the Russian sort of military leadership had gotten wind of the German\nattack because the Germans had, after all, massed three and a half million troops along the\nborder, and there were a number of -- even some German deserters who crossed into Russia and\nwarned them of the attack and they\u2019d been warned from other sides. Stalin didn\u2019t want to believe\nany of this. His -- but his generals [indecipherable] tried to see him a week before the attack and\nwarn him, they decided to go ahead on their own and -- and do -- make at least minimum\npreparations without telling him. But still, they were totally surprised. And then when -- when\nthe war started [indecipherable] we were really elated, we heard on the radio that Germany had\nattacked Russia, we felt this was the lesser evil. We certainly had not sympathized with the\nGermans when it -- 1-1n their war against the west. There we certainly preferred the western\nallies, but we really disliked the Soviet regime intensely, not only because they had nationalized\nmy father\u2019s business, but also because of the terror, th-the lies, the hypocrisy, the deceit. And I\nshould say a word about the terror. One of the things that happened is they took over some of the\nbiggest buildings in town as their police headquarters. Police, KGB, whatever. One of the first\nthings that happened is the windows on -- on the basement level windows were bricked in. These\na-afterwards became torture chambers and execution chambers and we suspected so much right\naway. And previously the Latvian police didn\u2019t engage in torture, they didn\u2019t have any need for\nthis, and it just looked suspicious that suddenly the basement windows were -- were sealed off.\nSo there were a number of things. One heard rumors from time to time about people\ndisappearing, and of course these -- these rumors then very soon became reality during these\nmass deportations the week before the start of the war.",
        "A: Mm-hm. [tape break]",
        "A: Okay. I understand that according to German plans they were supposed to -- to occupy my\nhometown the second day of the war because it was only 70 kilometers away from the German\nborder. It actually took them a week, and there was considerably more resistance than they\nexpected, both from -- from German troops, and then apparently from Latvian volunteers. As I\nsaid, Libau was a rather pink town, and a number of the workers and communist youth and so on\ngot weapons and they tried to defend the city. So as a result we got considerably more bombing\nand shelling than we normally would have had, and especially the last night, there was almost\nnonstop bombing and a-artillery bombardment and in particular was rather heavy artillery\ncoming from the sea. And so the center of town was pretty much in ruins, burned down. The\nstandard lie that was s-spread immediately after th-the German occupation is the Jews burned\ndown the town. They say -- they claimed in every city. In my hometown I can very definitely say\nthis was a -- a -- a totally untenable lie because the buildings that had burned down were -- were\nvery badly damaged. They were -- had been hit by bombs and by artillery shells, the walls had\ncollapsed and so on. A burned out building normally is burned out, it\u2019s blackened by soot,\neverything combustible is gone, the roof may be gone, but the walls are still standing. So this\nwas in -- in the case of Libau this was demonstrably a lie. Then the f-first few days with German\noccupation [indecipherable] nothing much happened, but the real jolt came, I think on July 5\",\nwhen suddenly there appeared signs of -- notices everywhere on the walls, regulations for Jews,\nand there were a list of eight or nine things that Jews were supposed to do or not to do. I mean,\nobvious ones like turning in weapons, not so obvious ones as turning in all means of\ntransportation, including bicycles. Then th -- they were not -- they were supposed to | -- to lee --\nto step from the sidewalk in the gutter whenever they saw a German soldier approaching, have to\n-- to -- to pay their respect. They were allowed to leave their houses only a couple of hours in the\nmorning, couple hours in the afternoon, they were supposed to shop only two hours in -- in the\nmorning. The men were -- were supposed to report to work at seven a.m. 1n -- every morning,\nand so on. It looked Draconian but not disastrous. We had sort of expected we\u2019d lose some of our\ncivil rights, but certainly we had not expected any danger to our li-lives. And so re-re-reading\nthese -- the -- these regulations I\u2019ve -- recently I felt that they weren't all that threatening. They\nwere Draconian, but they were not threatening, yet my father was quite concerned, and in\nretrospect I -- I think what -- what happened is the following. A few days after the Germans\nmarched in, there was a massacre of some 200 to 300 Jews in one of the parks, in my hometown.\nI had not known about this until about two months ago when I read about it in Ezergailis\u2019s book.\nThis was -- in that park some trenches had been dug, presumably the -- the Russian and Latvian\ndefenders expected to fight s -- s -- s -- block by block, so to speak. And German army units --\nthe SD had not yet established itself -- well, apparently killed several hundred Jews and just\ndumped the corpses in these trenches. Allegedly the Jews were afterwards allowed to remove the\nbodies and bury them in the Jewish cemetery, which was [indecipherable] exception. I strongly\nsuspect that my father had heard about this and that\u2019s why he was so worried, because these\nregulations at work and so on and not using the sidewalk weren\u2019t all that bad. And so he\nsummoned us and said, things look grim, and I have the following suggestion. And he said, why\ndon\u2019t we claim that my mother 1s not the biological child of her parents, but that she\u2019s an Aryan\nfoundling. Sh-She w-was f-found on the doorstep of her -- her parents in a little basket, with a\nnote saying Erika, and then a cross, implying that she is baptized. And Erika was a very German\nname, so it was implied that she was a German child. And that would make my brother and me\nhalf Jews, and as such on-only second class citizens rather than total outcasts. And it -- it -- it left\nno escape hatch for my father, unfortunately, but th-the hope was that perhaps we could send --\nhe could go off to a farm, work for a farmer in som-some lonely place, and then sort of wait until\nthe war was over. Because we had naively assumed that the war would be over within a matter of\nmonths, since it was only a matter of playing for time.",
        "A: In 1935 the Germans passed the so-called Nuremberg laws, where they defined the status of\nwhat they called mischlinga, or racially mixed people. And the -- the first level was half Jews,\nthey were deprived of a number of civil rights, but they were still a lev -- a notch or so above\nJews. And quarter Jews, again they were banned from certain things, like government jobs and\nso forth. But -- and anything beyond that was -- was not so bad. I-It -- they -- their -- the -- the\nrule was that you had to prove that all four of your grandparents were Aryan. For a quarter Jew,\none grandparent was Jewish, for a half Jew, two grandparents were Jewish. They were --",
        "A: We -- th-that was still the law. Of course, th-they could reinterpret the law and change it\nwithout telling us, but up to that time we knew that half Jews still were not as ca -- mi -- were not\nset equal to Jews. And so we thought that this -- this was about as far as we dared go. There --\nthere were all sorts of supplementary laws that -- that were Byzantine in their complexity. For\ninstance, there was some rule that half Jews normally could not hold government jobs unless\nthey had held these jobs before August 1\u2018, 1914. Which means these were old time civil servants\nfrom way back, or the exceptions were made if they had fought in World War I, and been\ndecorated, and so on. So there were -- even among half Jews there were different levels. And\nmind you, until that time there had been no sort of program o-of mass killing of Jews, and\ntherefore there didn\u2019t seem to be any -- any problem with half Jews. We certainly knew that they\nwould not be treated as badly. And this was about as far as -- as my father dared to go. My best\nfriend at that time in school, who was Edward -- no, George Specter, who was a -- his parents\nwere German Jewish refugees, had come to Latvia, and they also had two sons George and\nEdward, only the age relationship was reversed. They played pretty much the same game, they\nclaimed that their mother was Russian, not Jewish, and there was a grain of truth to it, I think she\nhad a Russian grandmother, and -- but all the other grandpa -- grandparents were Jewish. So she\nclaimed she was Russian, made her Gentile children were half Jews. And for awhile that was\nokay, but then they somehow felt sorry for the father, who was lef-left out in the cold, and they\ndecided to try something new, and found an old woman who supposedly had worked as a cook in\ntheir household and she then claimed in a affidavit that the f -- the father was really an\nillegitimate child of hers, and since she was Aryan, that\u2019d make the father half Jew and then\nmove everybody else up a notch. And that was too much for the Germans. They didn\u2019t believe it\nand they f-found a -- a pretext, I believe the -- the youngest son had made some change in the\nfather\u2019s passport, and that was document forgery, they arrested him, they arrested the family and\nof course they were all killed immediately. So what -- first of all one had -- could only go so far,\nif you s -- the story became too implausible, then you lost the whole game. And the -- the other\nthing was -- was that we didn\u2019t realize yet that not all Gentiles were equal in -- in the eyes of the\nGermans. The Germans were the highest of the hierarchy, they didn\u2019t want to shed any German\nblood, even if it was only 50 percent, but R-Russians were only one level above Jews, and so\nthey didn't much care for those. Is this about the time to flip the tape, or shall -- shall I go on?\nYeah, so my mother quickly found a farmer who would t-take my father as an unpaid f-farmhand\nand so he went out in the countryside, and we just av -- sort of waited for -- for the war to end.\nAnd then, very soon, since we did not wear the yellow patch, of course we -- I th -- I think we\nmay have been stopped by the police and we told them that we are half Jews, and they said, oh if\n-- if -- if you had -- if that\u2019s your excuse, you have to have it -- you have to go and clear that with\nthe German SD, the Sicherheitsdienst. And the commander of that was Untersturmfuehrer\nKugler, a f-fairly notorious man later, as it turned out. So my mother and my older brother went\nto see him. And my mother was a very attractive woman and a good actress and sh-she told her\nstory with -- with great conviction and apparently impressed him so much that he promptly\ndictated some special passes for us at -- a-ag-against the -- the -- the German E-Erika\nAlperovich, and her sons, half Jews George and Edward Alperovich, a -- the regulations\nconcerning Jews shall not be applied. And while this was being typed, he sort of grunted, th-the\nJews always got the best German woman. Well, my mother sort of returned the compliment by\nwhen she left she raised her -- her -- her arm and said, heil Hitler. So she had fooled him. And we\nthought, great, well now we have these passes, they -- there was no time limit on them, there\nwere no conditions attached to it, we thought, well we\u2019re home free, so all we have to worry\nabout is my father. Is this the time to -- to switch, or we still -- we still go?",
        "A: Yeah. Okay, so there were a number of cases where we were -- were sort of -- anti-Semites\nreported us to the police and say here are some Jews that are not wearing the yellow patches, and\nwe\u2019re summoned to the police and we showed our passes. And of course the -- the Germans were\nmuch higher 1-in the hierarchy than the Latvians. The Latvians pretty well had to do what the\nGermans told them, and we had this official document with a s-stamp of the SD, and so they let\nus go free. It was still unpleasant for my mother because a lot of people in town knew her. It was\nan absolutely crazy story for us to start, it was extremely audacious. She had her -- her parents,\nof course, lived in town all their lives, there were lots of people who knew them. She had two\nolder sisters that conveniently died in the 1930\u2019s and there were a number of people who knew\nthat the three sisters looked pretty much alike, and so realized that she was the natural child of\nher parents. We\u2019re still -- and there was one woman in town who had given birth to a -- a child\nthe same day that my mother was born, and in the same hospital. So here were these two women,\nmy maternal grandmother and this other woman, both giving birth to a child, in same maternity\nward, knowing of each other. So if tha -- that woman had known exactly what story we told the\nGermans, which most of them didn\u2019t know, th-they knew for some reason we are -- we are\nimmune, she could very easily have refuted and that she knows my mother was the natural child.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: So, as I mentioned, it was a very audacious plan and we -- if we had any inkling that the war\nwas going to last another four years, we never would have tried this plan, because this is a -- a lie\nthat simply couldn\u2019t go on for four years. We were just playing for time. Well, 1t worked all\nright. The -- I didn\u2019t lose my summer job, they kept me there, although I was half Jew, somewhat\nquestionable whether I was employable or not, neither did my -- my brother. But at the end of the\nsummer both of us, of course, had to quit our summer jobs and we tr -- and we had to earn some\nmoney because my father no longer had an income. And turned out nobody would hire us. The\nstatus of half Jews was somewhat indeterminate and most people just didn\u2019t want to -- to touch\nus. Also, the Germans, of course, were trying to -- to get control over the population, find out\nwho the Jews were, so periodically people had to go to the police and re-register their passports,\nget another stamp and so forth. My mother -- this was in late September \u201941, my mother went to\nthe police office, and the Latvian police official treated her with utmost respect and sort of said\nin almost so many words that he has high regard for her family, he\u2019s not going to do anything\nagainst her, and she\u2019s just going to renew her passport and no questions asked, which was\nanother example that -- of some decent Latvians. There also were enough of the other kind. So,\nthings seemed to be going along fine. We con-continued to look for w -- for -- for jobs, without\nsuccess. My mother gave some private lessons to various people who wanted to learn German.\nMost of her pupils were serious. There was one rather peculiar young woman, who was\ninterested only in the sp -- the specialized vocabulary, such as undress and underwear and so on.\nSo anyway my -- my mother taught her whatever she wanted to know or needed to know for her\nprofession, and didn\u2019t matter, she paid. Then in November, at -- at my -- the -- at the end of\nOctober, the -- this was -- was after harvest time, the farmer decided he no longer needed my\nfather and so sent him home. My -- by then we had also realized very quickly what was ha -- ha -\n- happening to -- to the Jews that were ar-arrested. I forgot to mention that within a few days of\nthe German occupation, once the Jews were marked with their yellow patches, that army trucks\nwould cruise around the town and when they saw a Jew, they would stop, check to see his papers\nand then put him on the truck, and he was never seen again. Or, they would come to Jewish\nhomes and again, round up the men, take them away, never seen again. And within a very few\ndays there were rumors in town what had happened to them. Some people had actually seen that\nthey were just taken to the dunes behind the fisherman\u2019s wh-wharf, and were shot. Later they\nfound -- the Germans found some -- an execution site farther aw-away in the restricted naval port\narea and so on, where there weren\u2019t as many witnesses.",
        "A: Yes, I knew it within a couple weeks or so. And th -- ma -- I -- I heard this from one of our\nneighbors who obviously was -- felt terribly sorry for the Jews, and he was telling us mainly to\nwarn us. I mean, he -- I don\u2019t know whether he had seen himself, whether he had heard it, but it\nwas common knowledge in town within a matter of days.",
        "A: No, never saw any violence. I did see some Jews put on the truck, and I later, after the war, I\nwas supposed to testify at the Nuremberg Trials of the German high command, because I\nremembered the license plates of those trucks. I knew that they had German army insignia and\nnavy. And that -- after the war, of course, was fashionable to blame everything on the SS, but the\narmy and the navy were involved. And then one day, standing at the streetcar stop, a -- a German\nsailor stood there and s-struck up a conversation, and of course he enjoyed it because I spoke\nfluent German. And he said, \u201cOh you have a lot of Jews in your town.\u201d I said yes. Oh, then he\nsaid, we have -- and then he made a movement of this trigger finger, pulling it several times. We\nhave blank blank a number of them. In other words, executed. Now, he was speaking as a\nGerman sailjer -- sailor, I\u2019m not -- one can\u2019t be absolutely certain by we he -- he meant w-we the\nnavy, or we the army, or other and -- and the SS, but I think there is evidence that at least the\nearly killings were -- were done with considerable involvement, if not exclusively by -- by the\narmy.",
        "A: Well, I mean, you just show a poker face, what can you do? I mean, it would be dis-disastrous\nif you made a long face and then sounded -- a-and -- and acted as if this were a -- a real shock to\nyou.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think scare is q -- is quite the word because it may not have been quite the first such --\nsu-such news that I got. Even if it was, when you hear about something\u2019s happening to others,\nespecially when you\u2019re a teenager, you think it can never happen to you. Drunk driving for\nexample, or getting cancer from smoking. Teenagers think they\u2019re immortal. And that time we\nknew that while there -- some number of Jews were killed, well th -- let\u2019s hope it -- maybe\ntheyll stop the killing. Maybe this was done just in the excess of the first few days of -- of the\noccupation or what. But in reality of course, there was lots of reason to worry, and some of our\nrelatives disappeared, and -- and th-the pattern that developed in -- in my hometown was that --\nI-I have -- course during -- at the time, I didn\u2019t have access to accurate statistics, but In -- I now\nhave seen some of the numbers and every week or two there were 50 or 100 Jews executed. They\nwere rounded up in the streets. One of my older relatives, a woman, was picked up when she was\nstanding in line at the only grocery store where Jews were still allowed to shop. And that was a\nconvenient place if they wanted to harvest some Jews, they just send a truck over there, take the\npeople standing in line, they won\u2019t need the groceries anyway. And so it happened on the -- in --\nin a trickle, so to speak. My maternal grandfather was arrested on Rosh Hashonah, which was the\nSeptember 22\". He was 83, and he was a rather defiant man who decided since the temple was\nrazed and he couldn\u2019t go to the -- to the temple, that he was going to stand at the window of his\napartment with his tallis and pray. Of course, it was a provocation. Police saw him at the\nwindow, picked him up, took him away, Presumably they ki -- that -- checked the town rather\ncarefully that day to see if there weren\u2019t any other Jews that were practicing their religion. And I\nthink there were 61 or so shot that day, he was one of them. Then there -- also the -- they -- the-\nthese synagogues were torn down. None of them had been destroyed or set on fire by either the\npopulation or as in some other cities, by the SD, but they were just torn down, brick by brick.\nAnd then they of course took the s -- the scrolls, the Torah scrolls -- and I didn\u2019t see this myself,\nbut I heard reports that they unrolled them in one of the squares of town and then forced some\nJews to step on them, to -- to -- to march on them. And the same person who told me this said\nthat the German soldier came along and he was careful not to step on it, he took a big step across\nand said, \u201cTh-that\u2019s -- that\u2019s Holy Scripture.\u201d So there were certainly a lot of warnings things\nwere infinitely worse than we had expected, and we -- we didn\u2019t realize at the time that this was -\n- or perhaps we did, this was a total change in policy, that\u2019s [indecipherable] the -- now that the\nGermans had entered the Soviet Union, they were going to kill Jews systematically. Now there\u2019s\nalso something about human psychology. Although ther -- there were lots of detailed rumors\ncirculating in town about the executions of Jews, there were quite a number of Jews who didn\u2019t\nbelieve it. There was -- people grasp at straws in such situations. There were occasional rumors\nthat somebody had traveled along a country road, and he had passed a huge camp with lots of\nJews working there. What they were doing, so on, is pure invention. Railroad traffic was still\ndisrupted, so it -- there wasn\u2019t much traffic from one city to another, and there was a report by\nthe occasional traveler, yes, he had seen such a camp, how reassuring. And yet, the truth was\neasy enough to find out, it\u2019s just a question of how much wishful thinking you want to engage in.\nWell, anyway, one day in the -- after my -- when my father was at -- returned from his farm, he\nrealized that according to th-th-the law, he was supposed to register with the labor office,\nvolunteer for -- or show up for work at s-seven a.m., but by then it was quite obvious what was\nhappening to men, especially, and so it would be suicide. And then the alternative then was to try\nto hide somewhere. So we decided to hide him in a s -- s-small sort of store -- storage room next\nto our kitchen, it -- really a little pantry. We put up a stack of f-firewood, and there -- there was\nenough space be-behind the firewood for him to hide, and we strategically placed some -- so-\nsome stools and so on there so that it -- when the doorbell rang, the idea was for him to climb up\nover the stack and hide behind it, and only then open the door. And one day we weren\u2019t sure\nwhether the doorbell had rung or not, m-my mother thought it had, and I thought it hadn\u2019t. I\u2019m\nnot sure what my brother said. So my father didn\u2019t go in his hiding place, he hadn\u2019t heard it\neither, and just then my mo-mother opened the door and there was a Latvian policeman and he\nsaid, I am looking for Adolf -- Adolf Alperovich, your husband. My mother realized of course 1s\nthat we were in real hot water. And of course my f-father had immediately heard his voice. His\nretreat to his hiding place was cut off, so all he could do is -- he wa -- he was in the bedroom at\nthe time, so he sort of climbed into the wardrobe and hid behind clothes. And meanwhile the\npoliceman had entered the apartment, was standing in the kitchen and questioning my mother\nand -- yeah, questioning my mother, and she -- and meanwhile my father was trying to hide and\nwas making some noise. And realizing that this was very suspicious, my mother decided to\nthrow a sort of quasi-hysterical fit. Said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where my husband is. You -- you people\ntook him away. Tell me where my husband is!\u201d And grabbed his wrist and began to shake him,\nand of course the policeman got quite uncomfortable and uneasy and with her shouting and so\non, she masked some of the noises in the bedroom, and of course we -- we all could hear them,\nand I don\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t get suspicious of -- he was sufficiently flustered, when he\nsearched the apartment he didn\u2019t happen to look in the wardrobe. Well, we thought, managed to\nsurvive this, we\u2019ll be a lot more careful in the future. But what we didn\u2019t realize is that there\nwere two people in the building who had reported what -- that my father was hiding in the\napartment. One of them was the janitor, who was often in the basement tending to the boiler, we\nhad a sort of ground floor apartment. And then the other one was a woman next door, and she\ncould probably hear my father\u2019s voice through the wall, the c-common wall between the two\napartments. And so they must have reported that my father 1s still there, he had a lower voice\nthan -- than my brother and I, and they could probably hear it. So I was -- second of December\n\"41, I was out looking for work without success and came home and as I opened the door I heard\nthe crashing of firewood, and I heard a -- a German -- shouting in German, as -- at my father,\nlike something I couldn\u2019t quite understand, then heard my father reply, \u201cI am not a criminal.\u201d\nAnd these were the last words of my father that I heard. What happened 1s that this time 10\npolicemen, led by a German had come to the apartment, including the man who had searched for\nmy father before and not found him. And they checked the whole apartment as thoroughly as\nthey could and they were about to leave, and then the policeman, whose name was Sproigis,\ndecided to look behind the firewood. The -- he is the one who had searched before and not found\nmy father, and naturally found him. So they took him and my mother away, they left me and I\njust thought I probably won\u2019t see my parents again. My brother had found a job. He came home\nat night, I told him the bad news. Then, I think it was either that day or the next, the German\npoliceman came back, escorted by Latvian, and was -- was very friendly and said, \u201cWell, we just\nwant to look around the apartment a little bit.\u201d And then he went, sort of looked the books, oh\n[indecipherable] novels and such things, not too interesting. Then he spotted the radio and said,\n\u201cTo whom did this radio belong, to your father, or to your mother?\u201d And I said, \u201cActually to\nneither, it belongs to a former roomer.\u201d This was, of course, a -- an ext -- a lie. We Jews were\nsupposed to turn in the radios, among other things. And he said, \u201cWell, how long ago since he\nwas here?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201che wa -- he was here in -- still in June.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is\nDecember. Isn\u2019t it strange that you haven\u2019t her -- heard from him all this time? I\u2019Il take the radio\nalong, and if you -- this roomer shows up, tell him it\u2019s at the security police.\u201d And so he told the\nLatvian flunky who was with him to pick up the radio, it was a big, heavy model, and off he\nwent. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your parents, they\u2019Il be home soon.\u201d Well, half of what he\nsaid was true, my mother was released the evening of the -- the eighth of December, and sh-she\nhad signed some waiver that she was never going to tell anybody what happened to her 1-in jail\nand so on. But she realized that my father was in very serious danger. And so the next morning\nshe dashed off to the police, the German police and asked them, I mean -- or tried to plead for\nmy father\u2019s life, and they said it\u2019s too late, he was shot that morning. She claimed actually she\nhad -- that on her way she had sort of approached the jail and she saw a truck parked there and\nshe saw several people getting on the truck and she thought she recognized my father from a\ndistance. So, he was shot on the ninth of December. And of course we were pretty shocked, but\nwhat -- what can you do, this had happened to a lot of people, now it happened to us, but at least\nwe were still alive and we are still protected by these passes. Well that extra protection lasted\nexactly six days. Four o\u2019clock in the morning on December 15\", I su-suddenly woke up, the light\nhad gone on in my bedroom and I opened my eyes and I saw two Latvian policeman s-stand\nthere -- st-standing there with rifles over their shoulders and is -- told my brother and me, get\ndressed, come with us. So what\u2019s -- what\u2019s the matter? Well, we produced our passes, showing\nthat we are half Jews and they -- nothing -- that they should not -- we -- we were exempt from all\nthe r-rules about Jews. They asked for my father and my -- my mother said that -- she had let the\npolice in, they had been -- they had rung the doorbell, and they -- they searched the apartment for\nhim, she told them that he had been arrested two weeks earlier. Well, he was still on their list and\nthen they -- they checked everywhere. [indecipherable] and when the finished searching the\napartment they opened the back door and there was a policeman standing behind that, cut off any\nescape. So we asked them, where are you taking us? And they said, we can\u2019t tell you. And the na\n-- older policeman who had -- had a bit -- a touch of humanity left said, \u201cAll I can tell you is,\ndress warmly.\u201d So we dressed warmly and went with them, and we kept protesting. They\nmarched us down a block or two and we protested that you have no right to arrest us, we\u2019re\nexempt from an -- any actions against Jews. And that -- they stopped at a building about two or\nthree blocks from -- from ours, and this is where our great-aunt lived, and she was actually the\ndearest of our relatives. And a few of the policemen went in, and we saw the lights go on in one\napartment, in the second apartment they had roused some Jewish families, tell them to get\ndressed. Meanwhile, th-the other police stayed outside, we had our faces to the wall, we were\nbeing guarded. And we had been arguing with them. So one young policeman was -- became\nabsolutely livid with this insubordination. And so he went to his superior sergeant, whatever, and\nasked for permission to shoot us on the spot. And we couldn\u2019t hear the answer of the policeman,\nbut anyway, he didn\u2019t shoot. I -- in Riga at the time, they actually killed -- out of 24,000 Jews\nthat were taken to the execution, they killed about a thousand o-on the way, for not walking fast\nenough, for trying to escape, for talking back, for any number of things. And Libau for some\nreason, they did not want to -- to have corpses lying on the street, I presume. Maybe they did --\nhad orders not to do this, and frankly the logical answer would have been, what do you care, you\nknow, a few hours later they\u2019ll be dead anyway. So we slowly worked our way toward th-the jail,\nstopping every block or so to round up another Jewish family. In one building a woman came out\nwith her two children and then few minutes later she said, \u201cOh, I forgot -- I forgot to take your\nfather\u2019s picture.\u201d The poor woman thought that they were going to be deported and it would --\nwould be nice to have the father\u2019s picture as a souvenir. Of course, they were all going to be\nkilled. We knew it, but -- and our great-aunt knew it and she -- she just looked very composed,\npretended not to recognize us, but she knew where it was headed. So the rest of us then -- all of\nus then slowly worked our way toward the prison. After -- as we approached the prison we could\nsee there were similar processions coming from other side streets, always escorted by Latvian\npolice, and we\u2019re admitted int -- into the prison yard. We were one of the last groups to -- to\narrive. It was still dark, it was around seven a.m. or a little before. They -- there was a German\npoliceman reading out lists and he had reached the letter K, I still remember, he was reading the\nname Katzenelinbogin, so we -- we were -- our ni -- name began with A, so our -- we had been\ncalled quite awhile ago. And since we were some of the last to enter, were near the gate, faces to\nthe wall, the Latvian gatekeeper sort of snuck up to us and said, \u201cHey fellows, do you have any\nwatches, or any jewelry with you? Your -- you\u2019re all going to be taken to -- to Germany, and\nthere they\u2019 Il take them away from you. Isn\u2019t it better to leave them with your fellow\ncountrymen?\u201d Anyway, we held onto our watches, didn't give him anything. And then f -- a few\nminutes later was -- was a commotion and we saw that my m -- my mother had managed to\nsneak into the prison yard with another group of Jews. She had first tried to join our group and\nthey wouldn\u2019t take her, she was not on the list. And so, now since they -- or they knew who she\nwas, she tried joining another group, but she was recognized, she was pushed out of the prison.\nAnd then, another couple minutes later, a German policeman appeared, approached us, and with\ntwo or three of the Latvian police in tow who had been -- who had arrested us. And he -- he a --\nso he asked, what\u2019s your story? And so we showed him our passes and told him. And so he\nstared at us for about 10 seconds and then suddenly he motioned, go. Now, probably didn\u2019t hurt,\nall of us were blonde and -- and blue-eyed and didn\u2019t [indecipherable] hurt that some of my\nblonde hair was sticking out from under my cap and so I looked sufficiently Aryan, my brother\ndid too. Told us, g-go. Barely got out on the street, we almost bumped into my mother. She had,\nhaving been kicked out of the prison, she had rushed over -- well, she had previously, she had ru-\nrushed over to the German police, managed to see some -- somebody\u2019s -- some official, I don\u2019t\nknow how high ranking he was, if he was not the top man, and said look what\u2019s happened, my --\nmy sons are half Jews, they\u2019re not supposed to be arrested, and they have been t-taken and can\nyou get them out. And the man was sympathetic, but then he said, what time were they picked\nup? And she said four o\u2019clock. He looked at the watch, it was seven. Sorry, he said, it\u2019s too late.\nWell, they had no walkie-talkies in those days and it was about a three or four hour march to the\nexecution site, so in principle we would have been, if everything had moved as quickly as he\nthought, we would have been on our way by then, and they couldn\u2019t very easily send a car after\nus. But we weren\u2019t, things were moving more slowly. So she thought that if we were dead, then\nshe certainly didn\u2019t want to live and so her only thought was to get back in the prison, join one of\nthe other groups of Jews, and just be killed with everybody else. And so suddenly she saw us\ncoming. And during all this to-do, as well, during the arrest and the arguments with the police\nand so on, we were absolutely calm. I think our mood can best be described as of re-restrained\nindignation. We were indignant but not to the point of -- of shouting or raising our voices, or th-\nthrowing a fit. But now all of a sudden we began to shake, and -- anyway, the shakes lasted for\nawhile. We walked home, by the time we got home they were over. My brother had to go to\nwork that -- that day, showed up about an hour late, and I\u2019m not sure what excuse h-he gave.\nAnd so we realized we had survived it. Later that day I saw -- in town, I saw a group of Jews\nbeing marched across the bridge north of the city to -- to the execution site. And it\u2019s a ver -- a sad\nsight to realize that here are these people, we had all been arrested together, I got out, but they\ndidn\u2019t. And two months ago I learned in graphic detail what would have happened to me if the\npoliceman had not said go, if he had said stay instead. And Ezergailis in his book has an accurate\ndescription based on court depositions by some of the Latvian henchman on just how the\nexecutions were carried out. And it\u2019s weird when after 55 years, when your life, you had reached\na crossroads and you took a turn to the right and your life had evolved in a well known way and\nyou were still alive, and you suddenly sort of get a flashback where you were at this crossroads\n55 years ago and you suddenly realize in great detail what would have happened to you if you\nhad gone -- taken the left fork instead of the right fork. Yeah, so it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know if anybody\nelse survived. There -- I think there was one Jew who had working papers, I think he would --\nalso had been rounded up, not in our troop, but I happened to notice there was another troop and\nhe produced some paper. Jews in those days who had special skills, and it\u2019s very important to the\nGermans, were spared, at least for the time being. That included craftsmen. One of the wonderful\noddities of the German SD in our town is -- was the German SD was in a building separate from\nthat of the Latvian SD, and the Latvians were not supposed to go anywhere except the ground\nfloor of the building. In the basement they had a number of Jewish craftsmen, watchmakers,\njewelers, goldsmiths, this sort of thing. Now it\u2019s remarkable why po -- a police unit needs\ngoldsmiths on -- on the side. It -- I -- I think nowhere in the U.S. is a police unit that has\ngoldsmiths, and -- and watchmakers and so on. And neither do the Swiss police or any other I\nknow of. On the other hand, th-the German security police was a rather special organization. So\nwe were -- we were free, but then, couple days later we got a summons to go to the police and\nwe as -- were to turn in our passes. And they said, well, this 1s now out of the security police\u2019s\nhands, mixed bloods are now handled by the civilian administration, the so-called kibice\ncommissar. And you have to go to the office, there is a man named Butkarite who takes care of\nsuch things. So my mother and my older brother, who was -- usually went -- I was considered\ntoo young, of the two of us he was a more obvious companion on such missions, went there, she\ntold her story and he said well, we\u2019ll -- you\u2019Il have to do several things right away. First of all,\nyou'll have to file for divorce from your husband. Then you\u2019ll have to get at least two affidavits\nfrom people that know you, that can prove that -- that your story 1s true. And then, he said, you\u2019 ll\nhave to produce a baptismal certificate. Okay, filing su -- for divorce was no big deal, she did.\nThen months or so later, a -- a -- a letter arrived from the court, saying that proceedings had been\n-- been dr-dropped, because the case was moot, since the state prosecutor had notified the court\nthat my father had died on the ninth of December 1941. Well, this came in handy after the war\nwhen my mother was trying to get some restitution payments -- pension from -- from German\nauthorities and they wanted to have some proof that my father was killed, and under the\ncircumstances this was the next best thing to an actual death certificate. S-So I-I will actually\ndeposit a copy of this with the -- with the archives. Then the affidavits turned out not to be a\nproblem, and I considered it somewhat indicative of the fact that there still were a fairly large\nnumber of decent people among Latvians. We had moved into our building only two years\nearlier, and there was one -- the f -- of our neighbors there was one family who clearly were v-\nvery troubled by the way we were treated, and they just -- at every opportunity they showed that\ntheir sympathies were the Jews. So my mother went to them and asked, could you help us? So\nquickly they figured out the best thing to do was the mother of -- of our neighbor would file an\naffidavit claiming that many years ago -- she was an old lady by then, that she had met, in going\nto the park with her own daughter and she had met th -- a sort of maid that was taking care of my\n-- my mother. And they\u2019d often taken out the children for walks together, and then the maid told\nher one day, this is not the real child of her parents, it\u2019s a foundling, a Christian foundling and so\non. And so embellish the story [indecipherable] all well known. So that was affidavit number\none. The other one was by a younger woman who again test -- testified that she had met my --\nmy mother oh so, 10 to 15 years before the war, they\u2019d become friends, and then one day my\nmother again confided in her that she wasn\u2019t the real child of her parents and so forth. And then\nshe went on to say, well we, together -- she really had a Christian orientation, together we\nattended services in Saint Anne\u2019s church and so forth. A -- a number of embellishments or\noutright inventions and so forth, then stressed that well, th-the children were brought up le -- no -\n- in -- in the [indecipherable] Christian spirit. That wasn\u2019t true at all, but th-they -- they went to a\nLatvian school, not to a Jewish school. At home they used the German language and so forth. So\nagain, she did her -- her best to make the story sound as plausible as possible. One thing I forgot\nto mention earlier, that the first -- when we got our first set of passes, and my mother had\npractically n-nothing to prove her case. But for years she had been corresponding with, of all\nthings, the Rosicrucian fellowship in Oceanside, California. They had a correspondence service\nin any number of languages, she corresponded in German. I\u2019m not quite sure why she\ncorresponded with them, in part because she wanted some health advice, in part because there\nwere some strains in her marriage and she wanted some counseling and so on, and they basically\nlevel-headed people, gave her some good advice. And there were occasional references to Jesus\nChrist, and you know, praying to him and -- and all would be well. And those she was able to\nfilter out, and she was concentrating more on some vegetarian or whatever recipes, some herbal\nteas and so forth, and some of the good, common sense advice about how to deal with my father.\nBut this was helpful, this was obviously a Christian organization and it\u2019s before the war, before\nthere was any si -- ca -- question of trying to h-hide your Jewish origin, she was -- obviously had\na Christian orientation. And the U.S. at that time had not yet been in the war, so -- this was\nbefore Pearl Harbor, so those letters came in handy. Now that the tough part were the baptismal\ncertificates. We were told that the archives of the Baltic German churches had all been removed\nto what -- to Posen, which originally was a town in Poland, in western Poland, and of course\nthey\u2019d been annexed by the Germans. And they had settled a number of Baltic Germans there,\nand they clearly want to expand German -- ethnic German settlement eastward as much as\npossible. This 1s -- was already part of -- of Germany. So the church records were supposed to be\nthere, and she was supposed to write to them. Okay, so composed the letter, sent it off.\nFortunately, mail took one month to -- to Posen and then one month back. It was in early \u00b042.\nThen, the first -- it turned out the first address they\u2019d given us wasn\u2019t the right one, so th -- took\nanother set of letters and by the time the three months were up, all she had is this first letter\nsaying sorry, you wrote to the wrong address. So she went to the kibice commissar, Mr.\nButkarite and said, well, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve tried to do what you told me, but it\u2019s taking awhile, and here\nis the st-story. So he gave her a three month extension. He wasn\u2019t totally happy about it. Then\nafter three months, well we had another exchange and the people at the archives had\nmisunderstood the question. They -- they said well, before we can do a search, you have to give\nthe exact names of your parents and the date of your birth and the date of your baptism and all\nthat. And my mother\u2019s date of birth was -- in -- in the records, was supposed to be the date when\nshe was found, so she must have been born sometime previous to that. So, clearly they had\nmisunderstood the question, this took another round of letters, and now Mr. Butkarite was\ngetting impatient, he said, I'll give you one more three month extension, but that\u2019s going to be it.\nThree months were up and of course we didn\u2019t have anything yet. And as the 90 days approached\ntheir end, you know, you start closing your accounts with the world and just be -- be prepared\nthat you will be taken away and you will be shot, like so many people before you. And my\nmother went there with my brother and asked Mr. Butkarite and they said, oh no, he\u2019s no longer\nhere. It\u2019s now Mr. Persil has taken his place. So my mother did some fast footwork and sort of\nbackspaced a little bit and -- in the story and sort of took Mr. Persil to -- a few steps back from\nwhere we actually were, to gain time. Persil gave her the three months extension. And again, his\npatience gradually wore thin. And just when it seemed to be over, might have given us the final\nthree months extension, once again he -- he was transferred, and in his place was a certain Mr. --\nMr. Gudschmidt. And well, meanwhile what been happening, it turned out that the church\nrecords were in Riga after all, they were not in -- in Posen any more. The Riga state archive was\nclosed indefinitely and so that gained us some more time, but in then end it was opened. My\nmother and I went to Riga and looked the records, and lo and behold we found two girls were\nbaptized Erika in the three months preceding the supposed date that my mother was found. Now\nthe next step would have been to prove that my mother was one of these, which how do you -- do\nyou prove that? I suppose you -- you prove that there was -- this person vanished without a trace.\nAnd Mr. Gudschmidt was no fool, he realized that as long as my mother was doing the -- this\nresearch herself, she could suppress any unfavorable evidence, and this could go on forever. And\nso he flatly refused to extend the passes. Well, we -- now we went home and we thought well,\nwill the police come today or tomorrow? Will they come and pick us up at home or at work?\nAnd if at home will it be during the day or during the night? And no, we were prepared for the\nworst. Instead, nothing whatsoever happened. Well, one of the weird things is during 41 and\n\"42, there were a number of anti-Semites who repeatedly reported us to the police, and said here\nare some Jews who are not wearing the yellow patch. And eventually they got discouraged, and\none rumor that was -- was circulated in town was that we had connections to high places,\nspecifically to Goering\u2019s staff. Well, Ih -- wondered why Goering and I s-suddenly realized why\n-- why they came up with this story. My mother had an office job in a tiny, little four person\noffice. It had a very, sort-of pretentious name. It was the Ostland was in -- the name for the three\nBaltic countries, plus Byelorussia. It was Ostland Iron Trading company of the state works,\nHerman Goering -- in the name of Herman Goering. All it was is a small purchasing office that\nwas supposed to negotiate exports of the products of a large metal working factory in Libau and\nhave them shipped to Germany. And they would transfer the orders, negotiate delivery schedules\nand so on. Totally innocuous. But o-on -- on this street level, on th-the building, there was a\nplaque saying Ostland [speaks foreign language here] etcetera, etcetera, Herman Goering. Well,\nthese are big words that the average Latvian probably had trouble figuring them out. The only\nthing that probably made sense to them was Herman Goering, and so they saw my mother going\nin and out of this building and they thought well, there 1s some office close that\u2019s close to\nHerman Goering and sh-she has ca -- she has access to it, and sh-she has some -- some dealings\nwith them. Well, I wish I knew who started this rumor, because I couldn't have invented a better\none myself.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yes, well this sudden lifting of our passes occurred in -- of -- the early fall of 1943, and from\nthen on we were without any protection whatsoever. We were fair game, but nobody came to\nshoot us. The ill-wishers who would have liked to see us six feet under had sort of given up\nbecause they thought that for some mysterious reason we are immune from any kind of per-per-\npersecution. The police chief, the Latvian police chief himself, who was in a good position to\nknow that my mother was the biological child of her parents, because he had lived next door to\nthem, again decided not to lift a finger against us. He said that he would not give me a -- a\npassport, which he would -- I -- I was required to have from age 16, but at the same time h-he\nwasn\u2019t going to do anything against me, which was -- left me in some kind of a limbo, but it\nturned out to be not such a bad place to be. A substitute that became increasingly important was,\nsince I was not allowed to continue school, I enrolled in some correspondence course -- well,\nactually this was more of a home study course, with some so-called Rustian Institute in Potsdam,\nGermany. And they send you little booklets for various subjects, for -- depending on what\nprogram you took. There were different, many different programs. And the first thing they s --\nthey sent me was a very impressive looking I.D. card with my picture and a -- a big Prussian\neagle. It wasn\u2019t the -- Hit-Hitler\u2019s eagle with a swas -- swastika, but it was still a very impressive\nbird. And so that was a very handy, official looking identification card, which I could use on --\non occasion. Th-Then w-we were so -- I should now take the story back to -- so -- a couple of\nweeks after we had been released from prisons, was -- was shortly before New Year\u2019s, 1942. The\n-- the --",
        "A: Yeah, well -- yes. It was very late \u201941, let\u2019s say, after Christmas \u201941. There were only about\n300 Jews left in town. A few months later they were moved into a ghetto, Latvians were cleared\nout of some part of town and Jews were moved in. We had essentially no contact with the Jews\nin the ghetto. My mother would occasionally see some -- some Jews on the street, she would\noccasionally talk to them. Some of them were happy that we were spared. Others -- but they told\nus that others resented it, that how -- why do we go free, and why do they have to suffer? I\nshould mention a -- a very minor incident. One winter night I walked past the ghetto, and I saw --\nit -- there was light snowfall and I saw that somebody was signaling, presumably with Morse\ncode from the ghetto to an apartment across the street, the window. So there was communication\nbetween the ghetto and -- and -- and Latvians living outside. There were a number of boy scouts\nin town, they\u2019d all learned the Morse code, so this was not a bad way to communicate. The Libau\nghetto lasted in -- I think until \u201943, then the last few hundred Jews, mainly craftsmen and such,\nwere deported to Riga, then they were put in the Riga ghetto.",
        "A: It would have been difficult, and for me it would have been fatal. I think even for a Latvian,\nthis was a crime a-and I sa -- just looked here in the archives at some of the reports from Latvian\npolice and so on. And certainly anybody who had contact with Jews, and so on was -- was in\nquite a bit of trouble, and since I was highly exposed already, this would -- would have been very\ndangerous for me. We did have contact with -- wi-with some -- very few people. One night th-\nthe doorbell rang and my mother opened, and it was a Jewish woman, whom she knew. It must\nhave been late \u201943 -- late \u00b042, early \u201943 perhaps. I\u2019ve forgotten her name. She had been hiding in\nthe apartment of some Latvian family and from time to time she had to pay them rent, in\nquotation marks. She would -- generally gave them some -- some jewelry. And she claimed that\nshe had to go out of the house to some hiding place and get the jewelry, actually it was all sewn\ninto her clothes. Anyway, she had heard that we were still alive, and we were free so she had\ncome to see us and we had a -- a talk with her. I think we saw her once or twice more. She said it\nwas not easy, the people, while they were taking this rent from her, while they certainly did take\non a risk in hiding her, they weren't especially nice. And there was a 10 year old girl, sometimes\nspat on her. So it was -- it was un -- certainly unpleasant. After the war we heard that this woman\nhad finally been -- been found out, in -- probably in \u201944, put in a concentration camp and people\nwho had seen her in the concentration camp felt that she was already losing her mind. She was\nwearing some strange clothes in strange colors and just acting very strangely and so probably she\ndid not survive the war, but she was one of the few people who didn\u2019t -- able to hide until then.\nOkay, so backspace until -- to oh, right after Christmas \u201941. We -- I finally found a job. There\nwas a man in the state employment office who was very sympathetic to me. He knew, of course,\nthat I was a [indecipherable] half Jew if he believed the story, and he was most anxious to place\nme and to help me. So he sent me on interviews, most of the time when they found out who I\nwas they didn\u2019t want me. But they then managed to get me a job as a messenger in a support\nconstruction authority that worked largely for the German navy. And so fine, I was hired there as\na messenger, and they sent me on errands, and one day I was sent to the German security police,\nof all places, with some letter. So I handed it to some German official and said a few words in\nGerman and he replied, and I replied again, so he got excited when he realized that I spoke fluent\nGerman. And so he had s-said, \u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t you like to join the -- the Shutzmanshuf, the --\nth-the Latvian auxiliary police?\u201d And put me on the spot because you can\u2019t say no, I don\u2019t want\nto. And I certainly didn\u2019t want to say yes. And so I -- I started yes, but -- and so he interrupt me\nin mid-sentence and said, that\u2019s wonderful. \u201cWell we can so -- put you in uniform right away and\ns -- just ta -- fil -- take care of the papers and so on, start immediately.\u201d I say, \u201cWell there\u2019s one\ncomplication. I am -- I\u2019m a half Jew.\u201d Oh, the man was very disappointed. He -- this would have\nbeen supreme irony that maybe these people would hire me as one of them, but two weeks earlier\nthey tried to -- to take me to execution. But -- but there were lots of absurdities.",
        "A: Well, it is -- we had a special status. A half Jew was neither fish nor fowl, and at least for a\nlong time it was not counted as a fowl. I have been told that there -- on the internet there 1s -- is a\nwebsite of Jews who sa -- served in the German army, it turned out that -- that virtually all of\nthem were half Jews, or quarter Jews, whatever. And I understand that Hitler said at one point, I\ndecide who 1s a Jew, and who isn\u2019t. And so they would make some people honorary Aryans, but\nof course the flipside of the coin was that you were made to serve in the German army. So it -- in\nLatvia -- you will probably si -- hear it during the rest of my story, much of the time people still\nweren't sure wh-what -- what rights I had and what rights I-I didn\u2019t. And some were -- were\nprudent and just didn\u2019t want to -- anything to do with half Jews, others would take a chance.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, this German official\u2019s attitude was, the half Jew, maybe I was not bad enough\nto shoot, but I was not good enough to -- then to put on a police uniform. It wasn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] I was not considered reliable. So that was out, but he may have called my boss\nat the office and the boss then having found out that I was a half Jew, he fired me. Well, I wasn\u2019t\nt-too sorry to -- to leave because things had become unpleasant at the office again, about the time\nthat they found out. One day the -- the accountant started a conversation in a loud voice when I\nwas in the room, telling one of them, do you know that we\u2019re now -- that we are now drinking\nthe blood of the Jews? He said, when they were shot, he said, the blood seeped into the ground\nand now it\u2019s coming out as drinking water. You know, what do you s -- what do you say in such\n-- and of course he was staring at me and see how I would -- whether I would squirm and so on.\nWell, you have to -- you got to learn to keep a poker face. So I wasn\u2019t sorry to leave the -- the\noffice, the atmosphere was less than congenial. But th-then I was sent to another office in a\nconstruction firm, and there the boss, although he was a Nazi party member, had what -- very\nsensible attitudes toward Jews. He hired me knowing who I was, he had previously hired my\nbrother. And he tolerated us. He was a simple-minded man, he\u2019d been a -- just a -- a carpenter\nand -- and in Danzig, Germany where the headquarters of the company was, and he was made\nthe boss of the local company with some 80 workers. And he so -- he said at one point, to me this\nmakes no difference. To him, Jews, half Jews, Germ -- Aryans, they\u2019re all the same, all of God\u2019s\nchildren, so to speak. Not that he was particularly religious or anything. A number of months\nlater, this company was working for the German military and I had a construction project\ninvolving a German army construction battalion with architects and such people. And we were\nsort of liaison people, my brother and I, because we spoke fluent German. And the soldiers liked\nus, they were trained architects and so on. But then the major, the commander of the battalion\none day learned that we were half Jews, and so he promptly wrote a letter to my boss, and said, I\ndo not want these half Jews on my project. So when our boss got this letter, he [indecipherable]\ngot quite indignant and said, that major seems to be a real nice guy, but he said it sarcastically.\nAnd he said, well to me it makes no difference. So he said fine, we won\u2019t put you on that project,\nyou work on another project. And it\u2019s a ne -- one of a number of examples of decent people\ndespite his Nazi party membership pin. One -- one learns to be a lot more discriminating in\njudging other people when -- when you meet them as individuals. So that I ha -- I had a job, a st -\n- a Steady job, and by and large there were no further problems. There was one strange person\nwho worked for this company for awhile. He had been with the Latvian SD, and the reputation\nthat he had was that he was involved in some of the killings. He was always quite sugary with\nme, of course I couldn\u2019t say anything what -- but my interpretation of his sugary attitude was that\nhe thought, the dead Jews won\u2019t testify against me, but if I\u2019m nice to some survivors, maybe if th\n-- as the war\u2019s over and if Germany loses, maybe they\u2019Il put in a good word for me. Th-That was\nan example of the other kind. Then, at these construction firms, since they did a fair amount of\ntheir work in the naval port, one -- they -- some of them actually saw the executions. One of\nthem in particular, a t -- a teamster who had just had to transport building materials with his\nhorse and wagon, told us how he had been sort of traveling along the road, and he saw at a\ndistance, he saw a group of people lined up at the top of a dune. And then he heard a salvo and\nsaw them topple over like bowling pins. And then, after awhile another row appeared, and again\nthey fell. And this agrees completely with the description to Ezergailis\u2019 book, which was taken\nfrom quite another source, namely from some of the executioners themselves, later they would\ntest -- they would give depositions -- they were in -- in Russian custody and they gave\ndepositions for some German war times -- war crime trials. Then there were other rumors, which\nagain turned out to be in -- very consistent with Ezergailis\u2019s book from other sources. One of\nthem, for instance, was that the original orders to the executioners w-were to shoot -- to fire --\naim one bullet at -- at the head and another one at the heart. And then word came from\nheadquarters, both bullets at the head. Then that is -- that they were getting whatever it was, half\na liter or a liter of vodka a day for the -- for their efforts, the executioners. And there was a fair\namount of alcohol involved in -- in some of these executions. So, 1t was really common\nknowledge in town what was happening to a -- to a remarkable degree. I did not know exactly\nwhat the organizational structure behind all of it was. I didn\u2019t hear the word Einsatzgruppen until\nafter the war. In retrospect, yes, I could tell from the uniforms th -- that the people involved in\nthese were -- were a mixture. Some of them were the so-called SD, or Sicherheits Politsi, they\nhad one kind of uniform. Some of them were of the Shutz Politsi which had a -- even a different\nshade of green. The ma -- the policeman who finally told us that we could leave the jail, he was a\nman of the Shutz Politsi, which was normally a -- an organization that was not so involved in the\nkillings. But these Einsatzgruppen was a -- a mixture. They had assigned or recruited people\nfrom different branches of the German police and SS, so they had different uniforms and\ndifferent positions.",
        "A: The -- the population as such, actually was not. There were, probably in all of Latvia, I\u2019m sure\nthere were several thousand who were actively or passively involved in the killings. There were\nsome executions squads. I think the most notorious one was based in Riga, the so-called Arajs\nCommando, several hundred who traveled in notorious blue buses all over the country to execute\nJews that had been rounded up by the local police. There were others who were Latvian police\nwho really just traffic cops and so on. They were assigned the job of rounding up Jews, as the\nones who arrested us, but in just leading them to the execution site, or in Riga, driving people to\nthe execution site. And th -- and there in Riga the shootings were done by Germans at the time\nthat the -- the big executions. In Libau there were several execution squads, as I found out much\nlater from Ezergailis\u2019 book. There was one Latvian squad and a German squad and they would\ntake turns. The Germans always tried to s -- to st -- to stress the local people\u2019s role in these\nexecutions. They would often take pictures only when a local squad was -- was doing the\nshooting and so on. Kugler, the -- the head of the SD, who had given us the first set of passes,\napparently was a -- a passionate photographer and he went to every execution, even if it involved\nonly few dozen Jews and always took pictures. And supposedly these pictures have been found\nin the -- apparently it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a well known collection. I don\u2019t particularly want to see it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Those that did the dirty work, from rounding up Jews and certainly those who did the killing,\nthere was no indication of any touch of sympathy for the victims. Certainly 1t would not have\nbeen safe to show it, because even if a few of them felt some slight sympathy and said this --\nwell, this -- I\u2019m sorry that I have to do this dirty job, there were others who were doing it with\nenthusiasm, like the young policeman who was prepared to shoot us on the spot. And if he had\nnoticed that one of the other policeman felt sorry for us, that would have been a lot of trouble for\nthem. But I was interested -- yesterday, in the seminar I read a short quote from the report of the\nGerman police commander. He issued sort of biweekly situation reports a-about all sorts of\nevents under his jurisdiction, and always starting with, oh what\u2019s the mood of the people. And\nthe report immediately after these mass executions of mid-December of 1941, he said there is\nwidespread unease and disapproval among the local people about the execution of Jews. Many of\nthem feel sorry for what happened to the Jews, and only a few have expressed themselves\npositively. And in retrospect I can agree with that, because somehow when you -- when you\u2019re in\nthe midst of it, what registers much more strongly is the occasional anti-Semitic remark or act.\nWhat registers much less strongly is the passive tolerance, and there were an awful lot of people\nthat tolerated us, that could have turned us in and didn\u2019t. Occa -- some of them went so far as to\nsay some kind words and express their sympathies and so on, and we t -- we quickly found out\nwho they were an-and in retrospect, I remember quite a few of them. And others simply decided\nto look the other way, and not do anything for us, not do anything against us. So L-Libau was\nperhaps a little different in the sense that there was -- the population by and large was friendlier\nto the Jews than in so-some other towns, although it was -- I don\u2019t think it was that different\nelsewhere. They simply were not the so c -- the -- they didn\u2019t deserve -- the -- the majority of\npeople weren\u2019t the stereotype bloodthirsty Latvian henchmen as th-the executioners were.\nThere\u2019s no question that there were a few thousand involved in various capacities, who\ncommitted the-these atrocities, and did it with -- with -- with pleasure.",
        "A: First of all, if you live a lie, after awhile you begin to believe it, almost. I was circumcised,\nand so there was a constant fear I would be in a situation where this would be found out. So that\nwas the danger, but teenagers always think that they\u2019re invulnerable and immortal. And\nfurthermore, life kept you busy. There were the problems of everyday life, I had a job, I didn\u2019t\nhave that -- I worked six days a week, I didn\u2019t have that much free time, and then the routines of\neveryday life took time. I had some friends, Latvian friends and so on, who -- who were very\nnice to me and enjoyed associating with me and so on. So life was too busy to worry, and\nworrying 1s not going to change it anyway. I -- one of my favorite philosophers is Schopenhauer,\nonce said that when you are concerned about a calamity that may happen in the future -- there are\nreally two kinds of calamities, there is the -- the calamity that you know it\u2019s going to happen, but\nyou don\u2019t know when. The second kind 1s, it may or may not happen on a particular date that is\nalready fixed. So in the first case, you should act as if this calamity was going to happen in the\nvery distant future, so don\u2019t worry about it. In the second case, yes, the date\u2019s approaching, but\nlet\u2019s hope for the best. And actually that\u2019s good advice, and so I pretty much live by that. So I\ncan\u2019t remember ever being really depressed and so on, it was a game to survive and I f -- I felt\nthat I was going to do my best and just hope I did the right thing each time when I came to some\ndecision point.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, in fact, this was certainly one of the stronger emotions the -- the night that I was\narrested, that I felt this was an injustice, these people had no right to arrest me, I was a half Jew. I\nalmost believed it myself. Chutzpah. Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I thought about it. A number of our relatives were in Riga, so we only had indirect\ninformation. There was one postcard that came from my aunt saying that her husband and son\nwere in the countryside. She believed it, perhaps, or maybe this was her code word, but this was\nclear they\u2019d been rounded up within the first few weeks of the German occupation and shot. And\nI suspected so much at the time; by then we knew what the game was. Those in -- in Libau were\nmainly elderly relatives. My grandfather, of course, war arrested on Rosh Hashonah. My\ngrandmother, who was also in her 80\u2019s was put to work cleaning the mortar off bricks from\nbombed out buildings. But -- but she was again arrested in this mid-December action and she\nwas shot, my great-aunt, and -- and so they were picked off. There weren\u2019t all that -- that many\nof them, but they were picked off one after the other, the men jun -- in July, and the women, at\nlatest, December. And I understand that the others did too. One of them after the war, I found\nout, was still alive as late as \u201944, but then died in concentration camp. And so I -- I didn\u2019t really\nknow about some of the individuals, especially in Riga, but I pretty well expected that few, if\nany, would survive. And there was nothing I could do for them.",
        "A: Yes. I -- you can\u2019t let the, sort of emotions and so on, really overwhelm you. It is very sad,\nbut somehow you -- you realize that your primary task is to survive in spite of it. A-And, I mean,\ndo the best you can and just try to rise to each challenge. Yes, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a great injustice that\nthe Jews are being killed, but the most constructive thing I co -- I could make -- I could do 1s try\nto survive myself. And if there was an opportunity that -- certainly I would have bi -- would have\nliked to help them, but it was -- was dangerous.",
        "A: The most important thing probably was not to look Jewish. This was always a ve -- almost a -\n- ajoke among relatives, friends and so on when they first met us, they -- they said, well, they --\nthey don\u2019t look Jewish, my brother and I, and so on. Well -- and at the time it was of an oddity,\nbut 1-it -- 1t was -- was no practical consequences, but suddenly the consequence became very\nimportant. They were -- alright, Pll probably come to that a little later. Do you have another\nquestion that you want to check?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Let me take up this whole complex of military service. In -- after Stalingrad, Goebbels\ngave a famous speech in Berlin, s -- asking the audience, carefully handpicked audience, do you\nwant total war and they all shouted yes? And then he said, yes we\u2019ll have total war and it means\nsuch and such, and yes, it\u2019s total war. Well, one of the consequence of total war is that the\nGermans suddenly decided that they were going to get -- they ca -- whatever help they can get\nfrom whatever quarter. So they established a draft in Latvia, set up a Latvian SS legion.\nPreviously they had organized only police battalions which were used in some fairly low level\ncapacity fighting guerillas be-behind the front lines, so -- but these were going to be combat\ndivisions of the Waffen SS. And they -- I think they said that there\u2019s six years, around 1919 to\n1924, wherever that went out, to report to military for -- were going to be inducted. And it took\nseveral months for them to set everything up, so my brother\u2019s turn, he was born in 1924 came in\nabout November of 1943. And it -- he was summoned by the military authorities, he passed the\nphysical as anybody would have, and he was sent off to Latvian police battalion in Riga. They\nhad organized a special company called the labor company there, and this was a gathering place\nfor racial dregs. There were some surviving Gypsies -- majority of Gypsies had been killed, he\nthe half Jew. There were some Latvian ethnic Poles because normally the Poles were just one sn\n-- notch above Jews, and some Ukrainians, and whatnot, I mean -- so they were put in this\nspecial unit for basic training and one day they got a pep talk, and they said, you will be sent to\nthe toughest combat. Those of you who prove themselves, will have a place in the new Europe,\nwhich was Hitler\u2019s slogan for what was going to come after the war, and those that don\u2019t, well,\nbeware. So, what choice do you have? But then 1-1f -- few weeks later, the -- they s -- the\nGerman liaison officer apparently decided that it wasn\u2019t right that a half Jew should be wearing a\nGerman police uniform, and so he s -- ordered that my brother be dismissed. He -- my brother\nwrote a petition which I still have, asking to be allowed to fight against Bolshevism, which was\nterribly important and so forth. And the co-company commander, Latvian approved it, the\nbattalion commander, also Latvian, approved it, the German liaison officer rejected it.\nSupposedly he said he knew of one place in Germany where some half Jew with some particular\nmerits was allowed to st -- to stay in the German police, but lacking these special merits, my\nbrother didn\u2019t qualify, so he was sent home. And he had to -- barely arrived home than the draft\nboard got after him and said, well you\u2019ll have to come for another examination and we will just\ndraft you in the Waffen SS. And my brother said, well the police didn\u2019t want him, oh the Waffen\nSS is different, they\u2019re not as choosy. Well, before he could appear there, he got sick with -- with\ntyphoid and diphtheria, was put in a hospital. My mother visited him several times and she felt\nthat the personnel were anti-Semitic, maybe they had seen that he was circumcised, gave him\nvery bad care, and he died. A day or so before he died, he told her -- he was already in -- in\nfever, he told her that he had to [indecipherable] he had a -- a bad dream that he had to climb su -\n- a mountain of death, which is strange that -- this premonition. And the next day he died. So this\nwas a very hard blow for me because we had become very close since -- at the time we -- I had\none or two other friends, but we were much closer, very reliant on one another. Was nothing to\ndo, eventually my turn would come, I was two years younger. And realizing that my turn would\ncome soon, I thought, well anything was better than serving in -- in the ground forces. Air force\nwas the lead unit, it was out of the question. I tried to volunteer for the navy, and they said, well\nsorry, we can\u2019t take half Jews. Then there was the German labor organization, but normally they\ntook people at 17 f-for [indecipherable] anything to gain time, that may -- may be better than\nmilitary service, again they wouldn\u2019t take me. And then, at the end of July \u00b044, they -- a notice\nappeared in the paper that everybody born in 1926 was to appear for induction. And the Russians\nhad been advancing with giant strides into Latvia, at the rate of, you know, sometimes 30 - 50\nmiles a day, and at that rate they would have been in my hometown within a few days. The result\nis that of some 500 young men of that age group, only about eight showed up for induction. Two\nhalf Jews. Me, and the real one, his mother was Greek. We did not dare take any chances, cause\nif the Russians weren\u2019t there the next day, or in a few days, 1f we hadn\u2019t shown up for induction\nthis would have been a wonderful excuse for them to kill us. The Latvians could play games,\nthey could hide on a farm and so on. We didn\u2019t have these connections, we couldn\u2019t have done it,\nso nothing -- no, we showed up for induction. And then they were ready to draft us, but then we\nsaid we are half Jews, oh well, that shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. And I said, well my f -- my\nbrother was in -- inducted in the police battalion, then he was discharged a half Jew. Oh no, no,\nthe SS is different, but to be on the safe side, we\u2019ll check with headquarters, and they gave me a\ntemporary deferment until further notice, and also the other half Jew. And -- well, again, play for\ntime. Just about the same time, since the Russians were advancing very quickly, a lot of people\nwere afraid that the Russians would take my hometown, and they would be under the Russians\nagain and by then the Germans were sufficiently indebted to the Latvians that they decided that\nLatvians could, in principle, seek refuge in Germany, but subject to political clearance, that they\nwere reliable. So we felt that 1t was a question of a mount -- Mohammed going to the mountain\nbecause w-we could have sat there forever waiting for the -- the western allies to come to Latvia,\nit wasn\u2019t going to happen, that we had to move west, and this was our chance. So it turned out\nthat , well the -- the first thing to do was to get this political clearance. And I had to go to the\nvery same police that had wanted to arrest me and -- and shoot me a f -- a few years earlier.\nFilled out the form, and then every hour a policeman would come out with a stack of forms that\nhad been at -- ei-either accept or rejected, and he would call out the names, and so I had to --\ntook time off from work, just stand there and wait, because I didn\u2019t want my name to be called\nevery hour because there would be enough people to -- who would recognize it, and I might be in\ndeep trouble. So, as soon as my n -- my name and my mother\u2019s name was -- was called, I\npromptly got the slips, looked at them, and they were both stamped okay, approved to\nemigration. I don\u2019t know what files they checked. We were on their death list a couple of years\nearlier, and now all of a sudden we\u2019re kosher again. Was absurd. Th-The tape --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So they -- there was a notation on my sl-slip saying that for the time being, is not\npermitted to leave because I\u2019m a man between 16 and 60 and they have to be kept in Latvia.\nWell, my mother, in her usual way said, I don\u2019t want to go anywhere without you, let\u2019s drop it. I\nsaid, no, no, no. Let\u2019s try to get some papers for you. The next step was to get an I.D. card, and --\nto emigrate into Germany. And I had -- my mother\u2019s passport had a couple of very serious\nhandicaps. One was her Jewish first name, Rachel. And I had taken that out with sodium\nhypochlorite [indecipherable] a budding chemist, and there\u2019s some -- still a nice stain on the\npassport, showing where that was. And the second one, her m-maiden name was Scheftelovich, a\nvery Jewish sounding name, and Leventhals, which -- which, come to think of it, Leventhal is\nalso a Jewish name. And these -- these double names have a strange origin from Tsarist times\nbecause in the Tsarist days when -- when somebody was drafted into the army, that was for 25\nyears, which means you can just say goodbye to a normal life, no marriage, no children and so\nforth. And so the game was to avoid military service at all costs. I don\u2019t know exactly how the\ngame was played, but apparently one of the tricks was to find some childless families that would\nsort of pretend that your child was theirs. And so that my grandfather\u2019s children were all farmed\nout to different families and so each t-time, each such incident gave rise to another double name.\nMy mother ended up a Scheftelovich-Leventhals. So we had to go to the -- again to the kibice\ncommissar\u2019s office, and apply f-for -- and se -- an I.D. card for my mother. And standing in line,\nI looked over the girls that were taking care of these applications and I tried to pick the dumbest\none. She was mentally slow and seemed confused. Anyway, when my turn came, she was -- was\nbewildered by these multiple names, and so, on my mother\u2019s passport, and she was quite happy\nto let me dictate to her what she was to write. So first of all I told her to write just Leventhals.\nThe Latvian spelling didn\u2019t look -- to a German eyes, didn\u2019t look too obviously like Leventhal.\nAnd -- but -- and Scheftelovich was completely edited out this way. And then she said, what\nnationality? I said, write Volksdeutsche. German. So she did. Fine, but then she had to take it\ninto her boss to -- to sign, and the -- the boss saw Volksdeutsche. Are you registered with Miss\nSo and So, who apparently was the person there that kept track of all the -- the ethnic Germans.\nAnd I said no. \u201cOh, then you can\u2019t claim to be Volksdeutsche.\u201d So he told the girl, \u201cWhy did you\nwrite Volksdeutsche? Cross it out, and write Latland\u201d -- Latvia. That -- yeah, that -- okay, that\nmeant -- he didn\u2019t say to write that she was Latvian, she just had to write Latvia, the country. But\n-- and although Volksdeutsche was crossed out, it was still legible. And this was just good\nenough, when we got to Germany later to pretend that she was a Volksdeutsche from Latland,\nwhich is the somewhat quaint way of -- of saying that. So we had Aryanized her by another\ncouple of -- of steps.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: I have to give you a name.",
        "A: I most certainly did not want to be -- to join the military, because this was the last year of the\nwar, and the conditions were pretty grim. Being in an SS uniform, of course made you much\nmore likely to be, sort of, killed if the Russians succeeded in capturing you. And conditions were\nvery rough at the front, so I certainly didn\u2019t want to serve in the military. But I also had no\nrealistic way of -- of dodging the draft. Latvians could go and hide on a farm, they could\ndisappear in the woods and join some of the small guerilla units. I had no such option. And of\ncourse the f -- the farther -- th-the longer those -- the war lasted, the more conspicuous were a\nyoung man of military age who were not in uniform. So I was prepared to take my chances. I\ncertainly had to tell them sooner rather than later I was a half Jew, but if they had said, that\u2019s\nquite alright, we\u2019ll draft you, I would have had no choice, would -- would have put on a uniform\nand been gone wherever they\u2019d sent me. And I am very glad it never came to it.",
        "A: Well, from my experience -- from my brother\u2019s experience, he was disqualified for a police\nbattalion, but not for the Waffen SS. At least that was our understanding at -- at the time he died,\nthat they would have been glad to draft him. And maybe the rules had changed, so I s -- half\nexpected to be drafted, but I hoped I wouldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes, the Waffen SS, it\u2019s sort of an oddity of German military organization, that they put the\nso-called Latvian legionnaires into the Waffen SS. They could just as well have put them in the\nregular army, because they had essentially no connection with the SS, and the atrocities that are\nassociated with the s -- SS. For some reason they organized these foreign legions, so to speak, as\npart of the Waffen SS, which was an elite organization and -- but without all the connotations\nthat go with it. Naturally, among the Latvian legionnaires, there were a number wh-who were,\nespecially among the officers [indecipherable] had been involved in killing Jews and so forth.\nAnd other were anti-Semites just from way back. But by and large it was a -- sort of a fairly\naverage bunch of Latvians. They -- if taken prisoner by the Russians -- of course, since these\nwere nominally Soviet citizens as far as they were concerned, of course they were all likely to be\ntreated very badly, possibly killed or sent to the gulag or whatever. But th-that\u2019s something you\npretty much had to accept in those days. It\u2019s just that I had no real alternative, and as a -- asa\nhalf Jew, I could not dodge the draft.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. So at th -- at this point we had a new I.D. card for my mother, which was significantly\nAryanized, and we -- but we didn\u2019t have anything for me, and I was not allowed to go. The\nRussians had stopped their advance temporarily, but then came September they were advancing\nagain, and th -- th-they -- before long, in -- in early October, they al-also managed to take Riga,\nand the Germans decided that they were going to make my home province of Courland into a --\nessentially a fortress. So everybody who was not working was then pressed into service to go out\nin the countryside and dig trenches all day and come back late in the evening. My mother and I\nhad to do that. After a few days I had developed some serious problems with my ankle, and some\nyoung German medics decided that I was not suitable for hard physical work, and he gave me an\nexemption so I could stay home. There were very frequent air raids. I stayed home and sort of\ncooked meals and so on. My mother went out to -- to dig trenches, and my principle in those\ndays was never to wash the dishes until evening because you never knew whether the house\nwould be destroyed by bombs, in that case why waste the effort of washing dishes first? So this -\n- we somehow managed to last through September, and then in early October the Russians\nmanaged to -- to punch through to the Baltic in -- somewhere in Lithuania, and -- effectively\ncutting off what was left of Latvia. At that point, apparently, for a few days the Germans decided\nthat things looked a bit risky and they had better evacuate those civilians who were friendly to\nthem. So all of a sudden this restriction that men were not allowed to leave was lifted, and I got\nthe green light. Of course, we promptly signed up to leave, and managed to get on a ship, and\nwere taken to Danzig, arrived there in the middle of the night. I produced my I.D. card from this\nhome study institute and it was duly stamped by -- with the immigration stamp with the official\nGerman eagle, so it ha -- I now had an I.D. that at least had semi-official status, thanks to the\nimmigration stamp.",
        "A: Probably a couple thousand people. It was a fairly sizeable freighter and it was full. They --\nthey took as many people as they could possibly put on it. And of -- the military situation again\nwas quite fluid, there were frequent air raids on -- on Libau, and one never knew whether the\nRussians wouldn\u2019t manage to -- to take the rest of -- of Latvia in the next few days. As it\nhappened, that part of Latvia remained under German rule until the end of the war. They finally\nsurrendered after the -- the armistice, and then the Russians occupied it. So we got to -- to\nGermany, and were put on the train and ended up in the Stargard transient camp, which is -- is a\ncamp that probably metamorphosed several times from concentration camp to camp for foreign\nlaborers, and then for friendly allies and so on. And within a few days I came down with\ndiphtheria. I was put in the hospital ward of the camp, and my mother had a great fear, having\nlost one son already to bad medical care by anti-Semitic personnel, she didn\u2019t want to -- to leave\nme there, so she managed to, by a little bit of bribery and fast talking, she managed to find a\nplace for me in an auxiliary hospital in -- in town that was a special diphtheria hospital, which\nwas endemic at the time. Th -- mainly children, but also a number of adults. It was run by some\nsisters, the M.D.s were a couple of Italian prisoners of war, and I checked in and stayed there for\nthree weeks, and was discharged more or less cured. We didn\u2019t want to go back to the camp. We\nhad, meanwhile, taken up contact with a German family in the Sudetenland in Kometau. It was\nthe family of a railroad man. He and his wife had lived with us for a number of months 1-in -- in -\n- in our apartment. And we had been nice to them, and they said, well, 1-1f you ever want to come\nto -- to Germany, then let us know, we\u2019 ll be glad to -- to host you. So it was very important at\nthis stage, if you want to get out of that camp, to have a contact, have an invitation. So we\nmanaged to secure the invitation, we were al-allowed to leave. We checked into a hotel, again\nthrough some bribery. The hotel, of course, you promptly had to fill out the police registration\nform. I began to fill 1t out and I came to the question whether we were half Jew or quarter Jew,\nand I was about to check myself off as a half Jew, and then suddenly I realized that 1t would be\ncrazy to do so at this late stage. Certainly the Jews and half Jews had been deported from -- from\nGermany, and it would be very dangerous for me to admit that, and I also realized that here I was\nin -- in Germany, nobody knew me. I had no reason to tell them the truth. So I just wrote down\nVolksdeutsche, and that was fine, but now wa -- we had carefully saved all this wonderful\ncorrespondence with the various archives about my mother\u2019s baptismal certificate and so on. So\nwe went through our documents and tore up everything that in any way 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- hinted at -- at\nthe status as -- as -- as a half Jew, and my mother being sort of a probational -- an Aryan -- tore\nup all these hard won papers, tore up family pictures of my grandfaren -- parents, who looked\nJewish. Anything that was incriminating and the -- we had to dispose of these papers in the\ntoilets down the hall, so every little while we went to the toilet, there was big flush. So, anybody\nwho was watching us would have thought that somebody must have, you know, dysentery, going\nto the toilet this often. Anyway, we got rid of all the -- the papers and we felt we had a new\nidentity. And then was just a matter of taking a train and going to our fi -- this -- our family F-\nFisher in the Sudetenland.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was lo-located -- the town of Stargard is fairly close to the -- what s -- used to be called\nStettin, is now Szczecin, a large city. Stargard itself was a picturesque small German town, with\nmaybe 30,000 population. I think it was fairly close to the center of town, or it wa -- the whole --\nwhole town wasn\u2019t very big, it was on the outskirts.",
        "A: No, at that time, as far as I could tell -- that the -- the camp had very light security, and so\nthese were, for the most part, friendly allies, refugees from Baltic countries and those that had no\nbetter place to go, had no invitation, were sent to -- to Posner, to some other place, and others\nwere allowed to go and see their respective hosts.",
        "A: In the camp probably, officially I was presumably still registered at the camp when I was in\nthe hospital, but let -- let\u2019s say I may have been there four or five days before I was put in the\nhospital, at most. Maybe not even that long.",
        "A: No, well you -- you could check out of the camp if -- provided you had an invitation to go\nsomeplace else. But you were -- you could certainly go into town if you wanted or -- or f-f-for a\nfew hours, go to the post office, and so on.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know of Auschwitz, of the death camps until after the war. I-I had known about\nconcentration camps like Dachau and Buchenwald for -- for years, and I thought these were\nsomething com -- comparable to penitentiaries elsewhere. I didn\u2019t think that there was a lot of\nkilling going on, certainly it was no Hilton, but I was totally unaware of the death camps. On the\nother hand, I talked to some Germans. I -- later, in -- in Kometau I sort of dated a -- a -- a\nGerman girl a few times. Was a very sensible girl and -- and she realized the war was lost, and\nshe said, I would fully understand if we were treated the way we have treated the Jews. And it\nwas clear from the way she said that, she knew that lots and lots of Jews had been killed. So fr --\nfr -- at least for -- all those who had -- didn\u2019t deliberately shut their ears as information was\navailable, it was widely available. But there were other people who didn\u2019t want to hear. Soldiers\nwere -- officially were not allowed to -- to tell tales out of school, so there were rumors. And you\ncould choose to believe the rumors, or not. Now if you had a relative that was -- had been at the\nfront and knew about these atrocities and decide -- decided that he could trust his family when he\nwas on home leave, and tell them the truth, he would. And then, from then on the family knew,\nthey had it from a reliable source and if they want to take chances, they could pass information\non to friends. But it was dangerous. If this sort of information eventually reaches the police, they\ncan trace it to their source, and you can all be in deep trouble. So, but it was certainly the\nthinking Germans, for the most part, had some idea of what was going on.",
        "A: Yeah. I should sort of inter -- interpolate briefly, that I met a very outstanding German, who\nwas just a private in the army, he was a -- an architect working in a construction battalion, who\nempathized very strongly with Jews, to the point where h-he gave six-sevenths of his weekly\nbread ration to Jews. And at his -- well, he -- he had occasionally had the opportunity to go to a\nplace where Jewish workers were employed, and he would generally give them a signal and so\nthat he\u2019ll leave a loaf of bread in some mutually agreed on place so that two minutes later they\nwould stop by and pick it up and hide it. And so he had only one-third of a loaf of bread for all --\nfor the whole week. The -- his comrades -- he also re-refused to use the sidewalk, since it was\nforbidden for Jews to use, he always walked in the gutter. His comrades knew it, they teased\nhim, said oh, Miller is making a long face, he must have seen another Jew. But it was good-\nnatured teasing. Their own sympathies didn\u2019t go quite as far, although -- but at the same time\nthese were basically decent people as far as I could tell. And nothing happened to him. It was\nperhaps significant that although the man was a -- a -- a-a architect\u2019s diploma that he was not an\nofficer, but just a -- a plain private. So there were some decent, idealistic Germans. I met some\nothers. We -- for a short while one of our roomers during the war was a Latvian former diplomat.\nAnd when we needed -- who was originally from Riga and then he went back to Riga. And when\nwe needed to go to Riga to the archives, we needed a place to stay, we wrote him, and he said,\nwe'll be very happy to have you stay with us. So he treated us very nicely. He knew our story\nand he could very well see through it, he was smart enough for that. So when we were there, he\nhad invited some of his friends, and -- including a German soldier who had learned Latvian, and\nthey were so -- outdoing themselves, including the German soldier, in making derogatory\nremarks about Hitler and the Nazi regime. And these were Latvian intellectuals, and they\ncertainly were nice to us. They could easily have done us in just on the basis on their suspicions,\nand they didn\u2019t. And yet it was also quite clear that they were not in sympathy with the Nazis. So\nthey were decent people and those people were critical of the regime, but what should not be\nunderestimated is how difficult it 1s to rise against the police state. Okay, shall I continue with\nthe story? Well, we got to the -- to Kometau, and arrived at the -- the home of our -- our prospect\n-- the Fisher family. We had with us a sort of as -- a small bag with five pounds of Latvian\nbacon. Of course, they were starved for anything like this, and they all ate to their hearts content\nand got sick to their stomachs, but I mean [indecipherable] used to such rich fare. We had went --\ns-spent the night waiting in the station, there was no local transportation, we didn\u2019t know where\nto go, so we had a sleepless night, and only had to wait until daybreak before we could visit our\nhosts. So we arrived there midaft -- mid-morning, and anyway by -- sort of shortly after noon we\ndecided we need a nap. The family said, why don\u2019t you go to our bedroom, and just stretch out\nand sleep. Aft -- and we left our -- our bags downstairs. Afterwards when we came down I\nnoticed that my mother had not locked the bag, and in her suitcase the uppermost item was a\nJewish prayer book, which she had taken with her and had put in the most accessible spot in an\nunlocked suitcase. I do not know -- these people were rather nosey, I do not know whether they\never opened the suitcase, whether they saw it. The prayer book was in German, this was for\npeople who, like many Jewish women of the time, didn\u2019t read Hebrew, and it was quite obvious\nwhat it was. If they had looked, they didn\u2019t breathe a word to anyone, which was rather\ncharacteristic of many people. Their -- I don\u2019t think they were really out of sympathy with Hitler\nbut they drew the line at not really wanting to be involved in any -- anything hostile -- a -- any\nhostile actions against Jews. There were Sudeten Germans, not all Sudeten Germans -- Schindler\nwas a S-Sudeten German too. Not all of them were -- were as decent as Schindler\n[indecipherable] these -- I don\u2019t think these people were anywhere near it. But it\u2019s another\nexample of people who could have done us in and chose not to. So anyway, we were welcome to\nstay there only as long as -- as the bacon lasted. When that was eaten up it was intimated to us,\nwell you better find yourself some housing. We went to the appropriate office, and was --\nappeared there as Volksdeutsche and at first they weren\u2019t too re-responsive, but my mother\nbegan to [indecipherable] and was very good at making a good impression and before long she\nhad persuaded them that they should get us a furnished roo -- room somewhere. And they had --\nit turned out they -- they had room that was ostensibly reserved for somebody else, it was in a\nvery nice part of town 1n a very nice apartment, and they probably didn\u2019t want your average, sort\nof eastern European refugee there, but after looking my mother over, and me, we looked\nrespectable, so they as-assigned that room to us. Well, there was actually -- there was no\nfurniture, but then they gave us special permits to buy some very cheap, sort of very e-\nemergency, essentially unpainted furniture. Some straw for straw mattresses, little stove, just the\nbare necessities. This was late \u201944. Large parts of Europe were certainly living under quite\ndifficult conditions, but the Germans still managed to look after their own. We were now\nconsidered their own, so we were able as -- as refugees, were able to get at least the minimal\nnecessities for life, as well as [indecipherable] halfway adequate ration cards. Well, the next\nproblem of course, was that I was 18 years old at the time, I was not in uniform, I\n[indecipherable] this was most unusual situation. The German army should have come after me,\nthey never did. But f-fortunately, something prevented me from -- fr-from being put in uniform.\nNow, we -- my mother and I sort of had to go shopping until we got settled, and I kept telling\nher, please don\u2019t walk so fast. And the problem wasn\u2019t that she was walking too fast, 1t was just\nthat my heart was giving out. This is a complication that often happens when adults get\ndiphtheria, that they get myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle. So, before\nlong I was in bed, and one of our neighbors was a doctor, she came up, listened to my heart,\nshook her head and said you better get yourself to a hospital. So I was in the hospital for two\nmonths, bedridden with myocarditis. And meanwhile the labor office had decided that they\ncouldn\u2019t put me in the army, but somehow it didn\u2019t seem right that an 18 year old should not be\nin uniform, and they had just the ideal job for me. I was to be a -- a guard at a -- a factory,\nguarding prisoners of war and forced laborers. These we-were armed guards with -- with rifles,\nand who were -- whose job it was to get the last ounce of effort out of these poor, undernourished\npeople. And a number of them were killed after the war. So while I was in the hospital, I kept\ngetting one summons after another to appear there, and to b-be sort of signed up for this par-\nparamilitary unit. I always write them, sorry, I\u2019m still bedridden, still in the hospital. Soon as I\ngot out of the hospital they again want to put me in that -- so -- in that unit, and I said sorry, but I\nam s-still quite sick and I c -- I\u2019m not yet ready to work. So they sent me to one of their doctors\nwho told me just to -- to do a few bends and then checked my pulse, which was well over 200 by\nthen. So he said okay, you -- you\u2019re unfit to work, I\u2019ll exempt you from work until May 15\".\nWell, the war ended on May eighth, very conveniently, so I had no further trouble from that\nsource. And while I was in the hospital there were several air raids, one was in our -- our town,\nbut the others were generally to other cities. And I was there the night that Dresden was bombed,\nand it was an air raid, we didn\u2019t hear any bombs falling, or any anti-aircraft artillery, so we just\nstepped out on the street to look, and we saw flashes of light at the horizon in the direction of\nDresden. And there was a mountain range between us, so we couldn\u2019t see too much, but we saw\nthese white flashes, then gradually they were replaced by a red glow which rose higher and\nhigher in the sky. And realizing what was happening there, it was rather scary. And of course,\nafterwards, you know, that night 60,000 people got killed in Dresden. The Germans still feel this\nwas a war crime, it was done with the British and the Royal Air Force. So we were not in great\ndanger, there were a few more bombings, in one of the [indecipherable] towns 500 people got\nkilled. There were also bombings in Libau, but the closest danger was that once or twice a bomb\nfell within about a hundred meters from us, but they were small bombs, and other than breaking\nwindows, nothing much happened. Well, we were just listening to the -- to th-the radio and\nmanaged to get the BBC, and we knew pretty well what was happening, and our German\nneighbors also realized what was happening, and -- and by April they -- they knew the war was\nlost and they were sort of wondering how to prepare themselves for the next [indecipherable]\nchange that was emi -- imminent. They -- one sort of triumph that came our way is that the\nneighbors on the ground floor were perfectly decent people, but since they lived in the ground\nfloor apartment, it was their duty to -- to hoist the German flag on official occasions, and they\ndecided at this point that this flag with a swastika was s-somewhat a incriminating material and\nthey want to get rid of it. They decided to burn it, but they couldn\u2019t burn it in their own\napartment because people could have looked in through the window. So we were on -- on the\nsecond floor and they asked if they could come and burn the flag in our stove and we were\nabsolutely delighted. Something else that I -- I me-meant to mention 1s that -- is that living in the\nSi -- in constant danger and not knowing exactly when the police would come to take us away\nand what would happen after that, we thought it was a good idea to prepare ourselves and get\nsome poison. So, as a budding chemist I found a recipe for making potassium cyanide and I\ncooked up a batch for myself and my mother and we carried it with us until sometime after the\nend of the war, until we could get out of the Russian occupation zone. Fortunately we never had\nto use it. The stuff is vile tasting and it\u2019s a bit ironic that as far as taste is concerned, the -- the\ngas, hydrogen cyanide at Auschwitz 1s -- is less disagreeable than -- than swallowing potassium\ncyanide, but the difference is, if you decide to kill yourself with potassium cyanide, that is\npreferable to being killed against your wishes. And so to us this would have been definitely the --\nthe lesser evil. Then we f -- about a week before the end of war, we heard that American troops\nhad -- were within -- within about 50 kilometers of Kometau where we lived, and the Russian\ntroops were still 300 kilometers away, and we knew nothing of the Yalta agreement. So we\nthought that the race goes to the swiftest and expected the Americans to show up any day. And\nthen nothing happened, the Russians kept advancing and the Americans were standing pat. So it\nwas once again a case of Mohammed going to the mountain. Suddenly the war was over, it was\nMar -- M-May the eighth. M -- in the last few days of the war we had seen long processions of\npeople on foot, m-most of the time from the east. It was a strange mixture of people, the\noccasional concentration camp inmate in striped garb, the occasional SS man, guarding him, or\njust looking out for -- for his own interest. I particularly remember one Jew who -- who really\nlooked pretty awful. He was clearly undernourished, but from his face you could tell that the man\nwas close to losing his mind. I don\u2019t know what became of him. And it was pathetic. There were\nsome others that didn\u2019t look quite so bad, but this was as -- a very sad case.",
        "A: It was -- it was a mic -- a strange mixture. There were a lot of civilians, there were some s-\nsoldiers in uniform, and then the occasional camp inmate. Presumably he wasn\u2019t free to go where\nhe wanted, there was -- was a guard nearby, but these weren\u2019t large contingents of refugees, this\nwas not one of -- all of concentration camp inmates. This was not one of the main routes of the\ndeath marches, but there was just a sprinkling of these people. I -- I don\u2019t know where they came\nfrom, so on. Well, came the -- the eighth of May. Of course we had been delighted before to hear\nthat Hitler had committed suicide, although that\u2019s not the way the story was told. But then, on the\neighth of May the ma -- the war was over, Germany had surrendered, my mother went out on the\nstreet, and an -- an old lady asked her just what is all this commotion about? People are so fa --\nhustling and bustling. And ma -- my mother said, \u201cThe war is over.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d this lady said,\n\u201cwonderful. So we won.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d my mother said, \u201cGermany lost.\u201d \u201cHow dare you say that? \u2019'm\ngoing to report you to the Gestapo.\u201d Well, it\u2019s remarkable that on the eighth of May, that there\nwas still a German woman who didn\u2019t realize that the war -- that they were losing the war. That\nin itself is a -- is an interesting topic, how a number of people clung to the hope that they might\nstill win the war. Course, Goebbels had all this propaganda about these secret weapons, that he\nhad -- one -- he said at one point that he had seen the new s-secret, retaliatory weapons and they\nmade the blood freeze in your veins. Well, it was a complete bluff, there was no such thing. After\nthe V-2 they have nothing more. But now the problem was the war was over and there was still\nno sign of either Americans or Russians. And then we realized the Russians were advancing and\nwe had better get out. And in place it was -- where the Americans were supposed to be with\nKarlsbad. So we went to the station and -- just to see what kind of transportation there was, and\nlo and behold there was a Red Cross train with so-some French prisoners of war, a former\nLithuanian p-prime minister who had been kept political prisoner in some castle, the Belgian\npriests, the Crown Prince of Montenegro. So, a weird assortment. Anyway, we s -- my mother so\nfast talked her way onto that train and we were allowed to get on. And so the train traveled a few\nkilometers, stopped for a few hours, travel again. One station on the way I saw an SS man in full\nregalia, marching, parading up and down. The war had been over for two days but this was still\nunoccupied territory, and it was scary to -- to see this man still completely self confident, as if he\nwere on top of the world. Anyway. Then, a few kilometers further the train stopped and then\nthere\u2019s -- I forget who it was, came and announced that all civilians and so on, refugees, get out,\nyou have to get off the train. Only the people who are authorized by the Red Cross can stay. So\nwe were 10 kilometers from Karlsbad, took our suitcases and just walked the last 10 kilometers.\nIt was not a very good thing for my heart because turned out that I had a good relapse at the time,\nso -- which kept me bedridden in -- in Karlsbad for a few more months. But we got to Karlsbad\nin the afternoon, walked around town, saw an American Jeep and were delighted. Went to bed,\nand we managed to find a refuge with -- with our neighbors who had taken us there, they had\nsome friends, we managed to sleep in someone\u2019s kitchen. Thought the next morning, we must go\nto the -- find the am -- American whatever, military office and sort of report there and say who\nwe are and just ask for protection. The next morning we were just -- we walked downstairs and a\nwoman stopped us in the stairs, hey you people, you better hide your watches, the town is full of\nRussians. The Russians were great watch collectors. Some of them would wear as many as five\nwristwatches proudly on the wrist. So what had happened is that [indecipherable] the Yalta\nagreement, the town was divided between Americans and Russians at the time. We were on the\nwrong, sort of, bank of the river, th-the Americans were on the other side. It\u2019s -- few people\nmanaged to swim ashore during the night. We -- I was in no condition to do that. The soldiers\nthat we had seen in the Jeep the night before, they were just having a joyride through the -- what\nwas to be the Russian sector of the town, and th-they have then returned to their own sector. We\ndid manage to get across the American sector and talk to a major who heard me out and said\nwell, why don\u2019t you wait a few days until we -- we have established control over the -- the town\nand then come back again. Well, it turned out there was no coming back because they pulled out\nthe next day. They turned out the -- turned the whole town over to the Russians, and so once\nagain we were in the clutches of the Russians. And once again it was a great convenience to have\n-- to be sick and not being sort of fit to be transported back to | -- to Latvia. Well, I should really\nstop at this point and maybe go back to the war time experiences, because we are now in the\npost-war era. The only thing that\u2019s left of the post-war era would be the Nuremberg Trials, or\ntrial.",
        "A: Yeah, I can perhaps backspace --",
        "A: Yes. Okay, in 1948 I was a student in Munich, and somehow I saw an appeal to --",
        "A: This was -- will only deal with the --",
        "A: -- with the -- with -- no, with the war time -- with the -- the hike -- German high command\ntrial, Nuremberg Trial because th -- my other --",
        "A: I-If you want me to I can talk about the -- the other stuff but th-that\u2019s our post war\nexperiences, little dangers to life or limb.",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "A: Yeah. Alright, until I got to the American zone 1-in Bavaria, yes, okay that\u2019s a couple more\nminutes, tiny bit more maybe. Alright, so I was in Karlsbad, once again bedridden, unfit to be\nshipped back to Latvia, and therefore safe. I-I sort -- registered with the -- with the Czech police\nand -- and registered as Jew, f-first time in years. The Czechs were quite chauvinistic. They had\nfour levels of ration cards, the largest food rations were given to Czechs and Slovaks. I think the\nsecond category was to friendly aliens, and this included Jews. The third one was for Austrians.\nThey still had some soft spot for their former Austro-Hungarian masters, and the lowest one was\nfor Germans. So we were still qualified for num -- for number two treatment. Well, 1t was fine, it\nwas a relatively a com -- relatively a comfortable place to be in. But then, since Czechoslovakia\nhad -- was supposed to become independent and the Russian a-and the American troops were\nsupposed to be withdrawn, by October the Russians were trying to round up their nationals and\nship them back and my illness was -- had regressed far enough that it was no longer an excuse\nand we realized that we would be in trouble if we didn\u2019t want to go back to Latvia again. So, we\ndidn't quite know what to do and then fortunately we met a Romanian Jewish woman who was a\nlot more worldly than we were, we were really quite naive in spite of all these experiences. And\nshe told us, look, there is -- the Americans are in Marienbad and there\u2019s train service available,\nwhy don\u2019t you just get on the train and go over there? And so we did, first as reconnaissance and\nit was relatively simple. The train stopped at one point, the Russian guard came on board, check\neverybody\u2019s I.D. card and then the train moved on a couple hundred meters and then an\nAmerican came on board and ch-checked people\u2019s I.D. cards, and a Czech policeman also came.\nSo we quickly realized that the smart place to be is in the farthest corner of the car where it was\nhard for the -- for the guard to take a close look at your I.D. card. So I had got my old school I.D.\ncard that you just saw, because Latvian has the same diacritical marks as Czech, so to the\nRussian this looked like Czech, to the American it probably looked like Czech, and to the -- I\ndon\u2019t know what it looked like to the Czech, maybe he didn\u2019t have 20/20 vision. So we managed\nto get through without any difficulty, trying to keep a poker face as usual. We got to Marienbad,\nfound where the -- the American sort of -- the sa -- sa -- military commander was, went to his --\nhis office. They had -- shall I stop? Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Okay, so we went to the American military office. There was a German interpreter whose\nEnglish was more fluent than mine. He had a hammer and sickle in his buttonhole, was\nobviously a German communist, or at least [indecipherable] this would make him a little more\nacceptable to the Czechs at the time. We told our s -- our story to them, and the American officer\nshook his head and says, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re -- you\u2019re living in Karlsbad, that\u2019s under the Russians,\nthere\u2019s nothing we can do for you. So we had long faces, and went out in the corridor and the\nGerman communist came after us and said, look, people, there\u2019s an easy solution. Why don\u2019t you\njust come here again, check into a hotel, then you will have established residence here. And we\nhave a standing rule that any foreigners not wishing to return to their home country will be taken\nto the U.S. zone of Germany. And so all you have to do is check into a hotel, and come back.\nGood advice. Went back to Karlsbad, packed up our belongings, took the same train back, got\ninto a hotel, appeared there and things worked like -- like a charm. We were now under\nAmerican jurisdiction, supposed to be shipped off to Germany. We were then told that the very\nnext morning we were to appear at eight o\u2019clock someplace, and we would be put on a truck and\ntaken to -- to a transient camp from which we would then go to Germany. So we appeared there\nat -- and we were the first ones in line and the line formed behind us, and I then, looking around\nto the -- the other people, everybody had baggage tags with their names, only we didn\u2019t. I\nthought, well, it was a smart idea, you can become separated from your baggage and this is an\neasier way to trace it. I better go and get some baggage tags. So I went looking, stationery stores\nand so on for baggage tags, and since I could only speak German to the Czechs, they didn\u2019t\nreally want to sell anything to a German, so I was -- they shook their heads and sent me from -- I\nwent from store to store. By the time I finally got these tags and came back, a big trailer truck,\nU.S. army trailer truck had arrived. People were being loaded on it, we\u2019d lost our place in line.\nWe were just about the last ones to get on, in the very back. Well, turned out this once -- once\nagain saved our lives. We were then -- truck went on its way, on the road to Pilsen. Was a light\nrain and the road started getting a bit slippery, and the driver was going a bit too fast. And I stood\nup in the rear of the truck and just enjoyed the feeling of sa -- wind in my face, and suddenly I --\nsomething hit me in the forehead, it was an overhanging branch of a -- of a tree. And I promptly\nsat down and then the woman looked at me and started screaming, because blood was pouring\ndown my face. I had a deep gash in my -- my -- my scalp. And before we could do anything\nabout it, suddenly the whole truck sort of overturned; hit a tree, overturned, and I had wonderful\nsensation of being a tennis ball. I just flew through the air, landed in the grass, one of my\nsuitcases beside me. I knew right away where I had some emergency bandages, so I got the\nbandage out, got myself bandaged up. Turned out that four people who were at the very front of\nthe trailer, where we would have been, had -- were all killed. And there were a few more people\nwho were injured. Before long an ambulance appeared, took me and two other people to the\nhospital and I was sort of st-stitched up by the Czechs and they weren\u2019t too happy about doing\nthis for me, it wa -- they asked where I was from, and they became a little friendlier when I said I\nwas from Latvia, I was not German. And then they want to know whether Latvians were a Slavic\npeople, so for once I made the Latvians into Slavs and say yes, we are Slavs and [indecipherable]\nI got -- got treated well after that. So we got to this camp in Pilsen and before long we are\nshipped across the border. We arrived in the U.S. zoned in Bavaria and yes, for the first time we\nfelt free. It was probably that time that we threw away our potassium cyanide, which was a -- an\n-- an important symbolic act showing that we now felt that we were safe. So I\u2019Il s -- really like to\nsort of skip ahead, unless you want me to go through the rest, and just go on to 1948, when a -- I\nhad joined the -- oh, there were a few funny incidents after the war. I en-enrolled as a student,\nand there was a Jewish student\u2019s organization in Munich. I didn\u2019t see any particular reason to\njoin it, but one of my friends, Jewish friends urged me to, so I -- I joined. And no sooner had I\njoined when they summoned me for what they called a court of honor. They wanted me to prove\nthat I was not a former SS man, and I said, well [indecipherable] my name is Alperovich, I can\ntell you a -- where we are from and so forth. How do I know that your name wasn\u2019t Goering\nyesterday? So once again Goering had intruded in my life. I said, here is my school I.D. see,\nfrom 1940, the one that you just saw. So he realized, few years older, but the same face, same\nname, so th-then they s -- let -- let me off. The second funny incident along these lines happened\n-- actually was three -- then, sometime later my mother was summoned before a board of rabbis\nto prove that she was Jewish, because they didn\u2019t believe her, she looked too Aryan for them.\nAnd she overheard the rabbis whispering among themselves, one of them said in Yiddish that, I\nbet her mother wasn\u2019t Jewish. That was ironic that here we had s-struggled so hard all these\nyears to prove that we were not Jewish, and then afterward, after the war, 1t was just as hard to\nprove that we were Jewish.",
        "A: Well, as a -- as a Jew, you were eligible for better food rations and some -- some other\nbenefits. Nothing major, but it -- it was helpful to be registered there. And the third incident was\nwe were, of course, trying to emigrate to the U.S., and we had a bunch of papers with us, even\nafter that s-s -- destruction session in the Stargard hotel, including some claims from my father\u2019s\nbusiness, and various other papers which -- some of which turned out to be quite important in\ngetting a pension for my mother out -- from the Germans. And so being very law abiding\ncitizens, there was still a -- a -- as -- military censorship in Germany at the time, and so we\ninquired, we have a bunch of papers and so on, do -- is it alright to take those? You can take\nthose, but you have to bring them to the censor first, the censor will check them over. And you\ncan pick them up next Tuesday. So I went there next Tuesday and they said, well, sorry, well\nthere\u2019s -- some of the documents were in Latvian and it will take us a little while to get them\ntranslated. Could you come back tomorrow afternoon at two o\u2019clock? So I came back the next\nday at two o\u2019clock, I was ushered into a Jeep, there were -- a military policeman beside me. They\ndroo -- drove me to the CIC headquarters, that was Central Intelligence Corps of the U.S. army.\nAnd I was ushered to a room where there was a proud sign saying, into this room wa-walk the\nsharpest investigators in Europe. And I happened to see the file on his desk, Edward Alperovich,\nformer Latvian SS man, wants to emigrate to the United States. And that George Alperovich,\nformer SS -- Latvian SS man wants to emigrate to the United States. Well, George had been dead\nfor over a year. Then they sa -- well, several years. Anyway, they started grilling me and they\nhad a Pole who apparently worked for them. First of all they had me s -- stripped me naked and\nthey searched me everywhere for tattoos, because SS men often had tattoos, couldn\u2019t find\nanything. Well, then the American sat across from me, he was carrying on a conversation with\nthe Pole. Did you see? He\u2019s circumcised. No, for me it\u2019s sure. What he meant to say, I\u2019m sure\nthat he is an SS man. So they -- they searched and they hemmed and they hawed, and I was very\ncalm, and I said -- he said, were you in Prague? I say, yeah, I was in Prague for a couple days\nafter the war, I was trying to get the visa to go to Switzerland, which of course they wouldn\u2019t\ngive me. And they asked me a few other question and they said -- I said, well, when was I\nsupposed to be in the SS? Just tell me the time and I will show you documents where I was at the\ntime. I was never in the SS, it was the hospital much of the time. They wouldn\u2019t tell me when.\nThere was -- in that suitcase there were letters from my brother when he was in the Latvian\npolice battalion. There was some correspondence with some SS office about getting his passport\nback after he had been discharged from the police battalion, they hadn\u2019t returned his civilian\npassport. And my mother also tried to get some kind of a pension because he had died right after\nbeing discharged from military service, and was a good chance that he got his typhoid and\ndiphtheria when he was still in the military. So there was correspondence, we had saved it, we\nhad nothing to hide, and they got terribly suspicious. So in the end they gave up on me and let\nme go. But it was really funny that the shoe was now on the other foot, having to prove that I\nwas not an SS man.",
        "A: Yes. I was in -- near Munich. When we came to Bavaria we were shipped off there, and I\nworked as a draftsman there, and then just -- just trying to find out what options I had and I -- I\nheard that some -- UNRRA had opened the university in -- in Munich, and so I went there just to\nsee how do I get back on an educational track. And it turned out that they were running a\nrefresher course for people who had lost their high school diplomas. And they said why don\u2019t\nyou take this class, in about four or six weeks of classes and there\u2019ll be exams afterwards. So I\nsaid, can\u2019t really, because I have not finished high school, I was still three years short. Oh, take it\nanyway. So anyway, I t -- I took classes, and managed to als -- to move out of the DP camp, and\nto Munich, passed the exam and I was admitted to the university.",
        "A: I think a couple of weeks perhaps.",
        "A: Fernwald.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: As far as I remember, there were no people that I could identify as concentration camp\ninmates. There were some Hungarian Jews who had, as far as I know had been -- had not\nsuffered too much. How and why I -- I didn\u2019t have a chance to find out. There were a number of\npeople who had re -- entered Germany from Poland, from -- from Russia and so on, in the first\nfew months after the war when the Iron Curtain wasn\u2019t very tight, and so most of them did not\nlook like the -- the really sort of hard core concentration camp survivors. Ea-Each of them had a\ndifferent story, of course, but th -- I th -- I think the -- the real hard core survivors, they were\nmainly in the British zone, that\u2019s where Dachau was -- no, no, Dachau wasn\u2019t in Bavaria, but I\u2019m\nnot sure what became of the Dachau people, Bergen-Belsen was in the British zone.",
        "A: By then, of course the German newspapers were carrying a lot of this. There were\ndocumentaries shown o-on -- in the movie theaters and so forth, so it -- and in fact, I had seen the\nfirst pictures in Bergen-Belsen, yeah, soon as they came out -- n-not as soon as -- they came out\nlate April, probably when Bergen-Belsen was liberated. And I certainly saw those no later than\nwhen -- when I was in Czechoslovakia, because th-the Czechs would certainly play up German\natrocities. They weren\u2019t especially partial to the Jews and so on, but this was very graphic\nevidence of how the Germans had behaved.",
        "A: To a considerable extent, yes, because it\u2019s one thing to hear in the abstract about\nconcentration camps and so on. We had a ghetto in town, we saw the Jews. They didn\u2019t look th --\ns -- badly un-undernourished. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t get quite enough to eat, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as\nbad as in -- in the concentration camps, this extreme emaciation, with people looked like walking\nskeletons, and so on, this was total news to me, and 1-1t shocked me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was in Munich, right.",
        "A: For awhile I commuted, left the -- the camp every morning at five a.m., and then returned the\nevening around eight or nine. And that got to be a little too much, so I managed to get a room in -\n- furnished room in town, moved out of the camp, mo-moved into town.",
        "A: Yes. We had been together all -- all this time. Yes, so anyway, I passed the exam and was\nthen eligible to enroll at the UNRRA university. I also, shortly after, when the University of\nMunich opened, I registered there as well, which was a good thing because the UNRRA\nuniversity was closed after a year and a half, forcibly by UNRRA. They just suddenly withdrew\nsupport overnight. There -- there was a lot of unhappiness among the students because we were\nreally hopeful that this was something new, an international university and s -- and so on, but\nanyway, they -- it -- it was destroyed by -- by UNRRA. Anyhow, so then I was a student at the\nUniversity of Munich, and somehow in -- in \u201948 I saw an appeal from the prosecutors at the --\none of the Nuremberg Trials of the German high command, asking for witnesses from the Baltic\ncountries who could testify against the commander in chief of the army group north, Field\nMarshall Vonlabe. And yes, I was from a Baltic country and I realized that, having seen that --\nthe license plates of the germ -- of the trucks that rounded up Jews, that a -- and having heard the\nsi -- German soldier brag how they had killed -- shot the Jews and so forth, I-I -- I could say a\nthing or two. So I re -- I-I notified them that I was available, they asked me to come up to\nNuremberg. I was then interrogated by one of the prosecution staff, who showed me on the\nfamous Einsatzgruppen a report by Stahlecker, and that\u2019s where I saw this hideous map with the\ncoffins and so on for the -- for the first time, showing how many people they had killed. He gave\nme a number of copies of documents and I told him about my experiences, and he felt this was\nquite useful information that would implicate Vonlabe. Then I -- he got onto Russians and\ncommunists and so forth and I could tell that as soon as I started telling him about my bad\nexperiences with the Russians, so on, he sort of froze, he became quite uncomfortable. A few\nyears later there were headlines, fr-front page headlines in the New York papers that two\nAmerican prosecution staff members had defected to Russia, he was one of them. He wa -- we --\nwe talked a-about an -- at -- he said, well, no matter ho-how bad you say things are in the Soviet\nUnion, there is no anti-Semitism. [indecipherable] there -- there is. So, well, you\u2019ve had some\nbad personal experiences. But it was clear that he was, even then, quite sympathetic, and then at\nsome point the damn fool defected. He was, as far as I know he wa -- I think he was a Viennese\nJew, and just had this -- this strange notion that -- that Soviet Union was a good place to be, and\nthis was about at the -- \u201948, that was the time of the -- the doctor\u2019s plot, you know, Stalin was --\nwhich was when Russia became strongly anti-Semitic, was -- became -- official policy was\nStalin\u2019s paranoia. Anyway, before long they had introduced me to the chief prosecutor, Walter\nRapp, who decided that my testimony was important enough that he was going to interrogate me\npersonally before the court, and was scheduled several days in the future. And then they said, are\nyou interested in -- in hearing Ohlendorf, the commander of the Einsatzgruppe D, testify? He had\nalready been sentenced to death but they hadn\u2019t executed him, he had volunteered to cooperate.\nThey said well, under the rules, you are not supposed to appear in courtroom until you testify.\nOtherwise it\u2019s -- you'll -- you\u2019Il be prejudiced. Sit way in the back and make sure that you are\nnot too conspicuous. So I went there, it was interesting to see Ohlendorf testify. The prosecutor\ntold me the man was highly intelligent and it\u2019s really so sad and mystifying why somebody so\nintelligent would do such horrors, and maybe this was his way of showing his -- his remorse. The\ndefense lawyer, of course, tried very hard to discredit his testimony, and his final question was,\nyou are under sentence of death, aren\u2019t you? And Ohlendorf said yes. It was a strange sight to see\nthe German high command lined up on the defendant\u2019s bench. They were little, old men. They\nhad -- th-they no longer had their shiny army boots, a number of them were wearing slippers,\ntogether with [indecipherable] which looked pathetic. And they were tiny. I think they still had\nthe mil -- some of the military insignia, I can\u2019t quite remember. When they wanted to go to the t -\n- the toilet, a -- a big, burly, black American MP walked in, towering over thi-this pathetic tiny\nfigure in slippers. I happened to be using the urinal at the same time as one of them. It may have\nbeen Vonlabe, I don\u2019t know. But it was such a contrast these people di -- a few years earlier they\nwere the people that were looked up to, they were the high commanders of whole army groups,\nand so on, countless divisions. And now they were just ordinary mortals, looking pathetic. But\nthen came the day for my testimony, a-and -- and the -- Rapp started to interrogate me. And they\nwere very pleased when we had sort of rehearsed my testimony, they said [indecipherable] how\ndid you know these were ar-ar-army trucks, and I told him the license plate numbers and so\nforth, the din -- designations and uniforms. I remembered a lot of details. Suddenly the defense\na-attorney cut in and said that this, sorry, this is new evidence that should not be allowed at this\nstage -- the trial by then was at the rebuttal stage. And so the court recessed for two days and\nthen finally decided -- while the attorneys were arguing -- and finally decided yes, this was\nindeed new evidence, it was too late for that, so it was stricken from the record. Vonlabe got only\nthree years, he was 70 at the time. I learned since then that Vonlabe was an anti-Semitic s.o.b.\nfrom way back, from World War I. He had been major or lieutenant colonel, or whatever in\nRomania, and there had -- they had some problems with guerillas there in World War I. And he\nwrote to somebody that he [indecipherable] requests permission to hang a lot of Jews, he thought\nthe Jews were behind these guerilla activities. That was long before Hitler. So he certainly had it\ncoming. It\u2019s unfortunate that he only got a three year term, I would have loved to see him\n[indecipherable] a little longer. I met a few witnesses there. There were a couple of former\nRussian prisoners of war, Jewish. There -- neither of them looked Jewish and they described\nsome of their experiences to me. I\u2019m not sure in which trial they were to testify, I-I didn\u2019t hear\nmuch about their testimony, but they told me some of their stories, how they had been taken\nprisoner. And one of them was of -- assigned as a -- not quite valet, it\u2019s too fancy a term, but to\nsome German medic, and the German medic apparently knew, for whatever reason, that this man\nwas circumcised, and he said, well, I know that before long there will be -- you will all be\nstripped and they\u2019 ll try to find the Jews among you, and if it\u2019s all right with you Pll perform a\nlittle operation so that you -- it won\u2019t be obvious that you -- you\u2019re circumcised. And if they ask\nyou, then say you had phimosis, which is of a -- when the foreskin gets very tight, so that\n[indecipherable] it can\u2019t quite normally function, then one normally operates it -- and then it\nleaves some scars, but it\u2019s not like a full circumcision. So he -- he did this operation for him,\nwhich put the -- the man was rather uncomfortable for three days, but after that it healed, and it\nmay have saved his life. And it\u2019s -- again it\u2019s a case where a German had the opportunity to save\nsomebody\u2019s life. He had gotten to know this man a little bit, and apparently wanted to save his\nlife. One incident, it\u2019s a little bit out of sequence. Right after the end of war in Karlsbad, we were\nstaying in the apartment of some people we didn\u2019t even know, just a -- our -- our neighbors from\nKometau had introduced us and managed to -- to get us into their apartment. And there was a -- a\nyoung man, probably in his mid or late 20\u2019s, who was a bit depressed about th-the fact that\nGermany had lost the war, and we went for a walk in the town together. And he said, well you\nknow, I have done a lot of reading, and I know now why we\u2019re -- we lost the war. It\u2019s all because\nof the -- the Jewish conspiracy. I didn\u2019t say anything one way or another, I didn\u2019t do anything. I\ndidn\u2019t feel like turning him in to the police. And I\u2019ve asked myself occasionally, was that the\nright response? He was basically a pleasant young kid. He had read some Nazi propaganda about\nJews, world domination, and this sort of stuff. Incidentally, when -- right after the Germans\noccupied Latvia, within weeks they started publishing Latvian translations of the protocols of --\nof the elders of Zion. And I felt that the man would probably get his just desserts sooner or later.\nMaybe his eyes will be opened, but 1t wasn\u2019t up to me to turn him in. Quite possibly this was the\nfeeling that a number of people had who could have acted against Jews, and again didn\u2019t want to\nget their hands dirty. Th -- somehow, when you know a -- a person, unless you a ver -- a very --\nsomehow a -- full of hate against another group, when you\u2019ve got to know a person, even for just\nfive minutes or so, you feel that you don\u2019t really want to have his blood on -- on your hands.\nThat\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s probably a normal reaction. This case, they had lost the war, I now know\nthat Sudeten Germans, thousands of them, were actually killed during the deportations, the others\nhad a pretty rough time getting out. I imagine that he presumably paid for it, and in the end\nmaybe his eyes were opened. But perhaps one could call me a coward for not doing anything, or\n-- or saying anything. I certainly did not feel like saying, you\u2019re talking to a Jew.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t so much a difficult decision, I had to give myself a push to write this word, which I\nhad been avoiding all these years, and just to make the complete 180 degree turn, you know, all\nthis time be claim -- be something other, then suddenly to come clean and say, I\u2019m a Jew.",
        "A: No. At that time there were practical reasons. If I had -- if I had written Latvian, there could\nhave been problems. Th-They might have decided to s -- to ship me back to Soviet Union, and I\nsomehow didn\u2019t really want to get mixed up with the Latvians. But the Latvians who had gotten\nout of Latvia included a number of Hitler sympathizers, as well as some people like ourselves,\nwho just want to -- to avoid living under Stalin, who were basically decent people. But I -- I felt\nthat -- that -- that wasn\u2019t much of a choice, I might as well come clean.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, definitely. Part of it was the practical reason, if you could say that you are Jewish,\nin a way this ab-absolves you from all suspicion of being a Latvian with some things to hide and\nso on, or a German, or whatever. That was practical, but in -- in part it -- it just seemed natural. I\ndidn\u2019t feel especially close to Jews from other countries. I did belong to this Federation of\nLatvian Jews, it was called, and I di -- discovered that there were -- were several differences in --\nin -- in the -- even in the Yiddish, of Lithuanian Jews, Polish Jews and so forth, and the mentality\nand so on. That -- Latvian Jews were terribly naive compared to Hungarian or Romanian Jews,\nwho were very, very wise in the -- the ways of the world. So yes, but primarily I was -- cer-\ncertainly I consider myself a Jew, and this -- I had sort of concealed this fact for years and now it\nwas out in the open.",
        "A: I became religious after my Bar Mitzvah. E-Every day I would put on the Tefillin and say my\nprayers and so on, and I was trying to be, not maybe 100 percent, it certainly wouldn\u2019t satisfy the\nOrthodox today, but I -- I was pretty religious.",
        "A: No, I -- I thought about it, but I had become -- I\u2019m not sure whether estranged 1s -- is the right\nword. I -- that -- somehow I was now five years older than I had been at the time. I can\u2019t say that\nI'd lost my faith in God or anything, but I felt that the -- first of all the external observances of\nreligion I-I found less and less meaningful and significant. I\u2019m not one of those people who feels\nthat there can be no God, how could He have -- have permitted the Holocaust and so on. Th-This\nis -- has not been my problem, it\u2019s just that I felt that the religion to -- to me had become --\nshould be less nationalistic, less tied to various rituals. There were also be certain teachings of\nJudaism that I approved of, certain traditions that I approved of, others I wasn\u2019t so happy with.\nSo I didn\u2019t really feel that I wanted to return to become as 100 percent a -- a -- obs -- observing\nJew. And then there were sort of f-festivals like -- like Passover. This was a family festival, and\nwe had -- we had no family left. And you know what, my mother and I should have a Seder\ntogether, it didn\u2019t seem right that -- yes, well the notion of the exodus and so on is -- als --\nalways seemed like one of the -- the -- the highlights of Jewish history, and I could still relate to\nthat, but the external observances somehow became less and less acceptable to me. But I still\nconsider myself a Jew. On the ship that took me from Germany to the U.S., I was put in charge\nof the ship\u2019s newspaper, which was a good outlet for my sense of humor, such as it is. And I\nreported with -- I would show the drafts regularly to the IRO officer, IRO is International\nRefugee Organization, the successor of UNRRA. Was a Frenchman. I think he was Jewish, but\nI\u2019m not s -- not sure. And he asked me to [indecipherable] what nation-nationality, and I said,\nI\u2019m -- \u2019ma Jew. Yes, but from what country are you? I said, from Latvia. Then why didn\u2019t you\nsay you\u2019re a Latvian? Now, that was my first encounter with the difference be -- the eastern and\nthe western European definition of a Jew. One case it\u2019s just a religion, and the other case it\u2019s\nreligion and race, or ethnic identity. And I took it seriously, and I -- I began to think about it, and\nI felt yes, well why not just make it a religious affiliation, why should it be national? And I so --\nalso felt that in Latvia you never had the choice of assimilating, I would have liked to assimilate.\nI wanted to become an agronomist, Latvia was an agricultural country and I wanted to be 120\npercent Latvian patriot. The smart thing to do then is to become a -- an agronomist and advise\nfarmers on how to grow bigger and better crops and so forth. I was steered in other directions\nafter that. But in Latvia I never had the choice of fully assimilating. Minorities were given their\nrights, they could have their own schools, their own newspapers and so on, but they were\npermanently excluded. There were no Latvians in the government or in the s -- no Jews in the\ngovernment or the civil service. There was something for the Latvians and the Jews, their\nfamilies could have lived there for 400 years, but they were still outsiders. And then I was\npleased to find that in the U.S., you get your citizenship papers, you get your passport, and you\nare a -- an American by passport. Not by blood, or by name, or whatever. And I much prefer that\nsystem.",
        "A: We had some very distant relatives in New York, so that was one consideration. There were\nsome other relatives that I never succeeded in locating, that would have been a little closer. At\none time, having read a fair amount of anti-American propaganda during the war, I thought the\nUnited States has a lot of problems. It\u2019s an interesting country, a large and powerful country, but\nsomehow I felt that maybe it\u2019s a -- it -- there\u2019s a lot of light, a lot of -- of shadow too. I thought,\nwell, I'd like to emigrate to an English speaking country, maybe Canada, maybe Australia or\nwhatever, but at the time they weren't taking Jews with no strings attached. In one of them you\nhad to -- you could go there if you agreed to work as a lumberjack for two years. Well, that\ndidn\u2019t quite fit into my career plans. So I gave up and decided maybe the U.S. was -- was the\nbest place after all, and from I had seen of America and Americans in the U.S. occupation zone,\nI-I just really liked what I saw, and I got to know more. I read the New York Herald Tribune\nwhen I -- whenever I could, and I -- I liked what I saw and decided yes, I want to go there. At\none time I\u2019d thought of going to Switzerland, but then, through a -- the Hillel foundation, I think,\nthey\u2019ve got the scholarship for me at the University of Oklahoma. Fortunately I never made it\nthere, it was a bit of backwater. Among my papers at one point I discovered I was also offered a\nscholarship at the University of -- of Zurich in Switzerland. And though at one time I had the\nambition of going there, a -- by then Switzerland was no longer interesting option, I wanted to go\nto the U.S..",
        "A: Yes, yes. Thi -- this was a general feeling among many DPs, that we have been caught up in\none European war and we\u2019ve just barely escaped and we would talk occasionally, what is the\nbest kind of passport to have. Well, a very small cun -- country, like Andorra, so what?\nNobody\u2019s going to start a war with Andorra, or San Marino or whatever. Well, the next best\nthing that 1s, a passport of a large country, preferably at the other side of the ocean. So that was\ncertainly an element, but the other one was that I became more and more aware of the great\npotential o-of the U.S. freedom, the opportunities and so I -- I liked the idea of going to the U.S..",
        "A: Thad a lot and -- and you may have s -- I\u2019m not sure how much of that I actually -- yes, I --\nthe copy of the biography that you have, I\u2019m not sure whether it actually goes to the time of\nemigration, but I don\u2019t know whether you want me to go into that story or not.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: P-Probably not, it-it\u2019s that -- 1t\u2019s -- I got to the U.S. two years later than I was supposed to\nbecause of some foolish things that happened, but I -- at one point I was ruled to be that my --\nmy admission would be prejudicial to the best interests of the United States. F-Fortunately I-I\nprepared to prove that -- that 1t wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I -- I arrived in Boston. I liked the uniforms of the Massachusetts State Police. That\u2019s\none of the first impressions. The second impression was I had about six dollars in my pocket. I\nhad not had a chance to eat bananas during the war, I had a great urge to eat bananas. And I just,\nwell, I can buy some. Went to a grocery store, still near the place where we had landed. Went to\nthe store -- and I had seven years of English in school, and I suddenly realized nobody had ever\ntaught me how to ask, how much are these bananas, because I had no idea whether they would be\n10 dollars a pound, or one dollar a pound, or 10 cents a pound, whatever. But this sort of\npractical question nobody had taught me, so I stood there like a fool, waiting for somebody to --\nto notice my plight and then explain myself. Anyway, I ate lots of bananas that summer.",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Okay. Well, one of my first impressions, of course, was New York City, which is unique.\nAnd we arrived there in -- in June, it was a good heat wave, which was also unique, a new\nexperience. There was -- the next experience was I found myself in the Catskills of all places, in\na-a very low budget vegetarian hotel belonging to a very distant relative, and I was pressed into\nservice as a waiter -- I was a lousy waiter, incidentally. And the problem was that this was a\nplace where people went to lose weight, who had -- people who had eaten more than enough all\nyear and they were delighted to be in a place where they were getting sort of low calorie diets.\nAnd -- and I had not really had too much to eat in Germany in the last two weeks or so in -- in\nthe camp before we -- and 1-in Bremerhaven before we got on the ship. The people there who ran\nthe camp realized that they could steal all the food they wanted, the -- the people who managed\nthe camp. That people, being this far along with the immigration process didn\u2019t want to make\nany waves and they wouldn\u2019t complain. So the food was very inadequate in -- in quantity and\nquality. On the ship most of us were seasick and couldn\u2019t eat. So we arrived in the U.S. and one\nthing I really wanted is lots of good food. Wrong place, this vegetarian place. Anyways, I\n[indecipherable] going to [indecipherable] anyway we -- people gave us fairly decent tips, it was,\nof course, a low budget hotel, but maybe by standards of posher places it [indecipherable]. But it\n-- it was enough for me then to pay th -- to pay tuition, I applied to several colleges and it turned\nout that for most of them I -- I was sort of neither fish nor fowl. I was too far along to qualify for\nan undergraduate degree, and I was not far enough along to -- to go to graduate school, the one\nplace that took me was Columbia. They had a big, sort of school of general studies, which was a\ncatchall for people going to night classes, or people that again, didn\u2019t fit the regular system, that\nthey want -- just wanted to look over. And then after first semester my grades were very good\nand so they were quite pleased to put me immediately into graduate school, and I was fine. One\nof my other strong impressions of the U.S., an early impression was -- is -- it was, d-during the\nKorean war, and Harry Truman had decided to sort of -- to take over the steel industry because\nthere was a strike. And it was during the war, he felt it was wrong to strike. And then a lowly\nU.S. district judge overruled him, and said it was illegal to intervene, the strike was legitimate.\nAnd to me this was a tremendously impressive demonstration of what the U.S. was all about, that\nin the European tradition it\u2019s unthinkable that a third level judge would rule against his president,\nespecially the president of the almighty United States. So that was really a wonderful object\nlesson. And there were many others, and there were quite a few things I liked about the U.S., and\nvery much impressed me, and you think living the U.S. makes you -- opens your eyes to a lot of\nthings that you previously weren\u2019t aware of, not that I approve of everything that goes on in the\nU.S., but it -- 1t was a -- a very great experience, and I was certainly very glad that I -- that I was\nallowed to come to the U.S..",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Schooling, I -- from my second semester on I was in graduate school, and was\nadmitted to the PhD. program, got a fellowship. I wasn\u2019t eligible for a government fellowship, so\nI got an industrial fellowship. Got a teaching assistantship, and managed to get my degree. My\nfirst academic job was at the University of Illinois. I thought all American universities were like\nColumbia. They weren\u2019t. Illinois was a very conservative place, run by old men, and they, in the\ndivision that I was in, they only had two kinds of faculty, those who had been there for 25 years\nor longer, and those who had been there for a year or less, nothing in between. And the young\nmen were sort of very much put in their place. It turns out I didn\u2019t have the right to choose the\ntextbook I wanted, the department chairman had written a textbook, and oh ye -- in principle I\nwas free to use it, but in practice I wasn\u2019t. And so on, there were a number of things that I didn\u2019t\nlike, so I was delighted after a year and a half, I got an offer from the University of Chicago,\nwhich was very much like Columbia in that respect, young faculty members had the same\nprivileges as old ones.",
        "A: I was trained as a chemist, actually as a radio chemist, having to do with radioactivity, which\nis now an unpopular subject. And I -- while still a student, I fell in love with meteorites. I took a\ncourse in geochemistry and one day the professor brought some meteorites to class and passed\nthem around. And this was several years before Sputnik, before space travel and so on, and I was\nf -- th-thought it was tremendously romantic that here are these bits of rock or metal that come\nfrom hundreds of millions of miles away, from where no man has ever been, or had much hope\nof ever being. That were older than anything, any rock on the earth by quite a bit, and that you\ncould study in the laboratory and you could do measurements on, it would tell you something\nabout the origin of the solar system, the earliest [indecipherable] the earth. It was fascinating. I --\nI want to do work in this field. It was love at first sight, really. And unfortunately I had a tiger by\nthe tail, I had been -- somehow I had been persuaded by a Nobel laureate to look for one of the\nlast missing elements in nature. There were four holes in the periodic table where there ought to\nbe an element that hadn\u2019t yet been found, and some forms of this element had been produced\nartificially, but nothing had been found in nature, and he persuaded me that I should look for it\nby some modern techniques, that there was a good chance that the people that looked for it\nbefore had missed it. And so I -- I spent the next seven years on that, which was a wild goose\nchase. And I had to solve the problem one way or another, in the end I solved it when -- I had\nsome -- I kept getting experiments which suggested it -- th-that the results were not good enough\nto publish, and not bad enough to quit, always were in between. And finally I managed to repeat\nan experiment I\u2019d done earlier and show that the earlier data were wrong, that the new result,\nwhich was really negative, was hundred times more sensitive than the old one, and so completely\noverruled it and I felt that I was now a free man, I could work on meteorites. So I did that the rest\nof my life. And I worked on lunar rocks and various other things, and had a certain amount of\nrecognition, and I had fun. And th-the only good thing that happened at the University of Illinois\nis I met my wife. Both of us had just newly arrived, she was a Canadian who had just recently\nmoved to the U.S., she was a dietician at the girl\u2019s residence hall, and I was newly a-arrived\ninstructor. And there was Lincoln\u2019s birthday, which is a big deal in Illinois, of course. They had\na party for grad students, faculty and staff, and she went there as staff, I went there as faculty. It\nwas a dance, I sort of looked over the girls that had -- were there, and decided none of them were\ninteresting, so I positioned myself near the door to intercept any good looking ones that came in,\nso I -- I -- before anybody else got to them. Anyway, I did intercept her, and the rest is -- is\nhistory. And we had two children, and -- and a very happy marriage. My mother turned out to be\nextremely difficult, because she had focused all her emotions on me. I was the only survivor, and\nas a psychiatrist later explained to me that I had fu-fulfilled all the roles of son and husband and\nprotector and whatnot. And she kept saying for years that she wanted me to get married, but\nwhen it actually came to it she was very much against it. Also, she had suddenly ha -- she had\nalso really detached herself pretty well from Judaism, but when the time came to talk about the\nwedding and so on, she suddenly rediscovered her roots, objected to any kind of a church\nwedding. My wife is Presbyterian, and so my mother was -- was very difficult and we had\nendless troubles with her. She lived with us, we had -- I felt that all the years we\u2019d lived together,\ncontrary to all the advice you normally get, can\u2019t very well push her out. And then, at one point\nshe attempted suicide. She went -- went to the psychiatric ward of the hospital and was under\npsychiatric treatment for quite awhile. I paid all the bills and so on. And -- and gradually we\nreached an accommodation, but we never knew where we stood, because she was schizophrenic,\nand part of the time she was a very charming, very sweet person, and parts of the time she was\njust a paranoid devil. And it continued like this, she made life especially difficult for our\ndaughter, was a very dear child. As one psychiatrist explained, that she hates women in general.\nShe hates my wife, she hated my daughter. It\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s -- don\u2019t quite know why, but it -\n- it was a problem. When she began to get Alzheimer\u2019s, many people have a personality change\nfor the worse, hers was for the better, she became very mellow, we could do no wrong. The early\nstages of Alzheimer\u2019s, no matter what we did, it was fine, it was -- she was at peace with herself.\nBut it was not easy. But it -- in a way it -- it made my -- my wife and me closer, and also it --\nperhaps the experiences were -- were traumatic for my -- my daughter, she went through a stage\nwhere she was anorectic and so on and she needed counseling, but she\u2019s -- she\u2019s fine now. But\nmy mother had treated her quite badly and my -- my wife insisted the children had to see the\ngrandmother every Saturday morning and not realizing what kind of mental torture my daughter\nwas going through, especially. So anyway, that\u2019s past. But I\u2019ve had a happy life, I worked very\nhard all my life, but I had a happy life in the U.S.. Relations to Judaism, so very gradually sort of\ncooled off in the sense that, I have good Jewish friends, but I don\u2019t have any ties to the religion.\nWe raised our children -- of course there had to be some sort of compromises with my mother,\nbut the understanding was that they would not be baptized. They were told about their\nbackground early on. We lived in a neighborhood of the university where it was actually a matter\nof prestige to be a Jew. And so they have no hang-ups about their background and we felt that\nthey should choose for themselves, and whatever they chose would be fine with us. As it\nhappened, I think one married a Catholic, the other one married a Protestant. But they are not\nparticularly ashamed of their background, they can talk freely about it. And to me this, of course,\nhas -- brings up the question that I asked myself many years ago. When this outstanding German\narchitect who I met during the war, when he said he would not consider it unfortunate if the\nGerman people ceased to exist as a nation after the war. Said, they have done so m -- so many\nbad things as a nation, he said he doesn\u2019t want the individual people to be destroyed, but if they\nceased to [indecipherable] as a nation it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. And to me this was a bit shocking,\nbut then over the years I\u2019ve asked myself -- nationalism has caused a lot of problems in this\nworld, and each nation, each group should ask itself, what are the quintessential qualities that we\nwant to preserve? In Judaism I think there is the respect for learning, which has been extremely\nimportant. The strong sense of justice and of siding with the underdog, which again is very\nadmirable. The Jewish sense of humor. There -- there are a number of qualities and they really\nshould be universal qualities. Maybe the Jews have a special sort of aptitude for it, the special\nresponsibility to propagate these qualities and I\u2019m glad in a way that there\u2019s a state of Israel and\nJews no longer have to be pushed around, and so on, and it -- it\u2019s only proper that those who feel\nuncomfortable where they\u2019re living, that they should be able to move to Israel and -- and live in a\n100 percent Jewish society. But to some extent I must say, I was -- I -- the Holocaust has left its\nscars. The -- I did not want my children to be -- ever to go through it again. I\u2019ve occasionally\nasked myself, could another Hitler arise in the U.S.? I\u2019ve -- I first asked myself this question\nbefore my children were born. And I saw a movie, \u201cJudgment at Nuremberg\u2019, and my wife and I\nsort of went for a long, long walk after, late in the night after the movie and we asked ourself,\nwhat is it that prevents the U.S. from getting a Hitler? And I realized one thing is a free press,\nand another one is an outspoken intelligentsia. And that\u2019s very important, when we have\nsomebody like Nixon and so on, there was no lack of protest from the intelligentsia, from the\npress. We sometimes get annoyed at the press, but as long as we have a free press, there is hope.\nOne can go on philosophizing about this theme, but m-my own feeling toward religion is I don\u2019t\nlike to associate with any foreign religion. In my research, of course, I have a fair amount to do\nwith astronomy, and to me looking at the sky 1s one of the most -- night sky, is one of the most\nreligious experiences. Just to realize that -- the vastness of the universe, and to read about\nbiology and to just know how intricately designed organisms are. And I am not taking sides\nwhether there was a -- God created various living forms and so on, or whether this all, you know,\nis just by evolution, what role God, or some combination of both, I think it\u2019s just -- nature is a\nvery wonderful place, and I find it perfectly possible to believe in a deity that presides over it all,\nmaybe with minimal intervention. I have trouble believing in a personal God that is -- is petty\nand keeps track of how many times a day I say my prayers and so forth. And I-I\u2019m -- \u2019m\ncomfortable with that. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s certainly not conventional Judaism, and I\u2019m not sure that it\ndeserves any label.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Probably not. I was 13 -- of course at bar -- Bar Mitzvah, I did this from 13 to 15, and I think\nI have grown a lot since, I\u2019ve asked myself a lot of questions. Also, someday I would have had to\ncome to terms why my father didn\u2019t belong to the temple, and just what was the proper dose of\nreligion, the proper form of religion. I mean it -- so long as you were treated as -- as a -- as a Jew,\nas a almost foreign element by society, well if society defines you as -- as -- as a Jew, then you\ndon\u2019t have much choice, you -- you make the best of it. But Judaism, of course, as I learned only\nafter leaving Latvia, that there are many brands of Judaism, Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and\nso on. I find a lot of -- a lot of appealing elements in Reform Judaism. But for awhile I would\nactually go to -- to some churches and go to some temples and so on and I would listen. And the\none thing I found myself looking for was humility. And really the only place I found it was at the\nUnitarian church. Now, I haven\u2019t s -- set foot in a Unitarian church in decades and I can\u2019t\nproperly call myself a Unitarian, but there was humility and tolerance, and a sort of attitude,\nwell, we are not all sure we have the right answers. We have no dogma. We are all trying to get\nto the same place, perhaps by different routes, and think we\u2019re -- one definition 1s reverent\nagnosticism. And I go to a Protestant church and I find this us versus them, and we have a\nmonopoly on the right religion. I go to a Jewish temple, I hear the same thing. And to me there is\nso much we don\u2019t know, and I think it\u2019s wonderful to believe in a God, but even that should be\noptional. But then to start with precise attributes of the God, and -- and precise dogmas and so\nforth, especially if it\u2019s that we have the right answers and all the other people are wrong, I find\nthis more and more objectionable, and that would have hit me even if I s-stayed in Latvia.",
        "A: Actually, I still do. Though I didn\u2019t pray when I was in -- well, I suppose I must have prayed a\nfew times when I was in tight spots, but I don\u2019t -- I-I don\u2019t think that I prayed in the sen -- I don\u2019t\nthink I prayed in the sense that I expected -- I was in a tight spot and I expected my prayer to\nresult in -- in a quick solution to my problem.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Well, yes, wa -- she\u2019s na -- I th -- think with -- with her it was -- it was both. She\ncertainly read the prayer book and she would get some comfort from it.",
        "A: Mainly, I would say a source of strength. There were times when I felt that we had to do\nsomething. For instance, I decided that we had to get out of Latvia, and she didn\u2019t want to for\nawhile, and she got -- she didn\u2019t want me to get th-the famous I.D. card for her. There were\ncertain decisions where we had to argue things out and of course it was a little difficult for her to\naccept that this -- this child has now grown up to be a young man and maybe he has more\n[indecipherable] than -- than I do. So we were a team. We did have our occasional friction, but as\nlong as there were just the two of us, and bef-before my wife appeared in the picture and so on\nthere, we generally managed to straighten things out.",
        "A: To me a very natural attitude is to -- to consider everybody a gentleman til he or she proves to\nbe the contrary. And so trusting people is still natural to me. I think I wouldn\u2019t carry it to\nridiculous extremes, and I tend to be rather aloof and -- and sort of a bit buttoned up. My mother\nwould sit down at the park bench next to a person and within five minutes they were telling each\nother their life stories. And she thought it was just wonderful if the other person told their life\nstory. My mother actually didn\u2019t want to talk about her Jewish background and her experiences,\nso on, but she loved it when people opened up to her, and she wouldn\u2019t reciprocate. She resented\nbeing quizzed and so forth. I -- I am not that sort of person at all. I think I mentioned to you that\nthey\u2019re only -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve told my wartime experiences to only about a dozen people outside\nfamily in 55 years, including a number of close friends I\u2019ve never -- never told them about. They\nknow of my Jewish background, but somehow I didn\u2019t really feel that I need to entertain them\nwith a rather bizarre story.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think it has taught me not to generalize about people, and th-there are really two factors that\npushed me in that direction. One of them was that before the German occupation, we thought\nthat just because my -- my father was a very decent businessman, he had some letters from his\nGerman customers commending him for having warned them about some unfair practices of\nsome -- some other business people, that no matter what -- whether there were any legitimate\ncomplaints that the anti-Semites had about certain Jews, that my father had a-a-an excellent\nrecord and that he would be treated accordingly, that they would not -- not treat everybody the\nsame regardless of what you -- you\u2019ve done as a person. And similarly Germans, I\u2019ve learned\nvery quickly that there were some -- some awful Germans, some monsters, and there were some\nangels, and lots of in between, and -- and the same with Latvians. And so I began to realize that\nit\u2019s absolutely wrong to generalize. I -- I don\u2019t like to say the Germans, or the -- the Jews, or the\nLat-Latvians. I tend to view people as individuals. So that\u2019s one important lesson that I learned.\nAnd the other thing is that I feel that sort of ethnic religious labels are some of the less important\ndescriptives of a person. The story that I like that illustrates this very well, a number of years\nago, there was a conductor named Dean Dixon, an American. When he first gave a concert in\nEurope -- he spent much of his career in Europe, the newspapers would write about the\nAmerican Negro conductor, Dean Dixon. After the second concert it was the American\nconductor Dean Dixon. After the third one it was the conductor Dean Dixon. They should have\nstarted with the third concert right away, because to s-size up Dean Dixon the most important\nthing is a conductor. He was a good conductor, he was a mediocre conductor but he obviously\nknows a lot about music and so on. Prefers certain kinds of music and so on. It\u2019s less important\nthat he is Am-American, music 1s fairly universal. Still less important that he is black. In the end\nall of these factors have to be considered, but they went at them in the reverse order. And I want\nto be known primarily as -- as Edward Anders, who has done such and such with his life, done\nsome good things and some bad things, made some mistakes, had certain quirks and so forth. I\nhave [indecipherable] done research in certain area, I\u2019ve done this or that, and it\u2019s considerably\nless important that -- that I am an American, or that I\u2019m a Jew by birth. So, to me these are less\nim-important because there\u2019s such a tremendous variety of Americans, there\u2019s such a tremendous\nvariety of Jews, and to start with either my American citizenship or my Jewish background and\nput that as the number one label on me, I -- I think it\u2019s putting the cart before the horse.",
        "A: Strangely enough, not all that much in the sense of long term or short term damage. The only\nrecognizable quirk that I have is I don\u2019t like anybody barging into my bedroom in the middle of\nthe night, and we had to train our children when they had a bad dream they were welcome to run,\nbut to our bedroom door, and they could knock, or they could otherwise make -- make a sound,\nwe had the intercom anyway, to their rooms, but they were not to barge into the bedroom. They\ngrew up normally in spite of this restriction.",
        "A: Yeah, I think when -- when they\u2019re s-small you don\u2019t go into un-unnecessary detail, it\u2019s just\nthis is a rule and that\u2019s it. And since then, of course, they\u2019ve learned t-to -- little by little.",
        "A: Yes. It is a hang-up. It\u2019s -- e-even today I behave in some ways a little lit -- bit like a child\nthat does not speak until it\u2019s spoken to. My wife and I are very close, we share a lot. And when\nI\u2019ve read something interesting, I sort of wait for her to ask me, did you read anything interesting\ntoday, and then I tell her. My excuse is that I want to make sure that she\u2019s really prepared to\nlisten, that she\u2019s -- she\u2019s ready, that she doesn\u2019t have other things in -- in her mind. And with\nthese wartime experiences, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s that factor and perhaps also that it\u2019s something highly\npersonal. It\u2019s quite far back, it hasn\u2019t really changed my personality all that much as far as I can\ntell. And as I mentioned in my written notes that I -- I\u2019m rather thin-skinned and I have a fairly\nshort temper, I\u2019m impatient and when I look back I had all these traits before the war, so I can\u2019t\nblame them on the war. Well, in that case, I probably would be a fairly similar person if I hadn\u2019t\nbeen through these experiences, if I had been born in the U.S., for example. Well, in that case it\u2019s\nno longer an important de-descriptor of my personality or of me.",
        "A: ?'m a bit of -- more than a bit of a perfectionist. I try to be understanding. I had fairly high\nexpectations and I\u2019ve realized subsequently that some were a little too high. And my daughter\nonce reminded me that she called me from college and she said she got three A\u2019s and a B and I\n[indecipherable] to ask her what\u2019s the B for? I would not do that again. But I think that\u2019s a way I\n-- I\u2019m pretty hard on myself and I unthinkingly rel -- applied this to my children.",
        "A: I can remember a lot of the -- the circumstances I told you about I can remember quite\nvividly, I can remember the scene in the prison, and -- with the guard asked us for our watches, I\nknow exactly where the German policeman stood and was calling out names. A | -- lot of these\nimages are very vivid, the things that I described to you. And sometimes even some secondary\nevents about the same time than an -- also -- wh-which were not painful or dangerous or\nanything, I can also remember. They don\u2019t exactly haunt me. I did have to come to terms a little\nbit with it when I read Ezergailis\u2019 book in the last few months. When I came to the detailed\ndescriptions of the executions and so on, there was one night I had a little trouble going to sleep\nand I -- when I wake up early -- and I\u2019m a bit of an insomniac, then again I couldn\u2019t go back to\nsleep because I kept thinking of this. So during the weeks that I worked on my talk and my paper\nfor the seminar, let\u2019s say that I did get a little less sleep. But it\u2019s not -- was not to the point of\ngiving me nightmares or otherwise dominating my sleep --",
        "A: No, nothing has haunted me, just that I can bring them back a-at will, and if I so occupied\nmyself too intensely with them, yes, then they will probably bother me a little more than they --\nthan -- than is good for me. But as long as I don\u2019t bring them up myself, they don\u2019t haunt me. I --\nI\u2019m supposed to have a fairly good memory, which was very helpful in -- in my research, but --\nand of course it\u2019s not as good now as it used to be. I can remember a lot of detail, but it -- I can\u2019t\nsay that it torments me.",
        "A: No, there are other things to -- to keep you occ -- nowadays I talk a lot with my wife about\nthis. I dredge up little details, something I\u2019d forgotten, so on, and I talk to her about it and she\u2019s\nalways interested, and occasionally I add it to my notes.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: No. We -- it was part of my life, but it was there with -- with -- along with some other parts. I\ndidn\u2019t try to -- to run away from it. And -- but at the same time, I have seen a lot of things, done\na lot of things, and yes, this is perhaps different from everything else because it involved\nconsiderable danger to me. But may -- you -- you been through it and you file it away in the\nproper place, you know where to find it when you need it. The -- the file drawers don\u2019t pop open\nspontaneously.",
        "A: Well, when I talk to somebody, either family, if my daughter is interested in -- 1n some detail,\nmy wife, or this history professor, he wants to know more about it, then -- then I -- I try to\nremember additional detail, occasionally things come back. And certainly you asked a number of\ngood questions, and I sort of tried to --",
        "A: Yes, sometimes it takes me an hour or two to dredge up the detail that I -- I need at the sp-\nspecific moment.",
        "A: No, I think we\u2019ve covered a fair amount of ground. This -- you ask very good questions.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The first one is my school I.D., and -- when I was 14 years old, and this served as my I.D.\nafter the war in Czechoslovakia for a few months, because it was not in German and didn\u2019t have\nan eagle on it. Unfortunately the beautiful German I.D. with the eagle, I -- was-was one of the\nthings that I tore up after the war. I was afraid that the -- the Czechs might decide that I had a\nstronger connection with Nazi Germany than -- than was safe to have. The next item is my\nmother\u2019s Latvian passport. There, the interesting part 1s first of all that she had a -- a double\nsurname, Scheftelovich-Leventals, as maiden name, both of which were Jewish, and there was\nalso at one time there was a -- a Jewish first name, Rachel, which I took out with sodium\nhypochlorite, and the others had to be Aryanized, and -- which I succeeded in doing when I\napplied for her I.D. card in 1944, and ended up with a girl that was quite willing to let me dictate\nto her which parts of the personal information to copy and which one not to. Then here is a -- a --\nthe letter from the Herman Goering works, which merely certify that my mother had -- had\nworked there in the office for a year, and that she -- |-lately her health had suffered beca -- by the\ndeath of her oldest son to the point where she no longer was able to carry out her duties. This\nwas written less than a month after my brother died. And the -- the funny thing about this 1s of\ncourse that is the small purchasing office that was -- had the -- the name of Herman Goering on\nit, that may have given rise to these weird rumors about us having a connection with Herman\nGoering. Here are the two affidavits which should really be translated verbatim, of those two\nkind ladies that th-then -- that testified that they had known for many years that my mother was -\n- was really an Aryan, a Christian. And in -- in one case I think it\u2019s es-especially noteworthy that\nmy mother barely knew the woman who -- who wrote this and she was a mother of our neighbor,\nwho ha -- sh -- we had also known for only two years, that people still were willing to perjure\nthemselves and take considerable risks by certifying that we had -- that my mother was -- was\nGentile. Here is the police registration in -- in Karlsbad where, for the first time since the war, I\ngave as my nationality Jew. And it\u2019s -- asks here, nationality before an-and after October 10\",\n1938, of course it was Jew both times. They didn\u2019t ask what I was in between. Here is an -- an\noddity, the Federation of the Liberated Latvian Jews, they wrote a letter saying that I was the in -\n- their -- I was employed in their war crimes department and therefore it was important that I am\nable to continue this work. This happened at the time when the Haganah was actively recruiting\nmembers for this Jewish army, just before the 1 -- and during the Independence War in Israel.\nAnd since I had no intention of emigrating to Israel, I felt that really it\u2019s -- I shouldn\u2019t be asked\nto go and fight for Israel. The rest of the documents are self-explanatory. There is one document\nin Latvian, dating from the mid-30\u2019s, which only -- which certifies that my -- my father was\nrecorded in the -- in the Jewish birth register of 1897, and [indecipherable] document dated 1934.\nThe rest is straightforward and doesn\u2019t require any comment.",
