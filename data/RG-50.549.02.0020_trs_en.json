        "Answer: We can talk about my broken oven and stove and the repairman or we can talk\nabout the man that\u2019s coming to fix my faucet. Which do you want to hear about first?",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s your interview, so it\u2019s up to you.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you for taking time out from all your domestic disasters to --",
        "A: It\u2019s just one of those days. I mean, you can use the bathroom, but you can\u2019t use the\nsink.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, let me just ask you to say your name and you know, where we are today.",

        "Q: Okay. And once again, thanks for taking time out to do this interview today. You have\nalready done a video interview with the museum in Washington about your early\nexperiences and your experiences during the war, and really the purpose of this interview,\nis sort of to pick up that story from where you left off and take it up to the present. So I\nwould like to ask you, though, if we could go back maybe a step and if you could\ndescribe what your circumstances were right around the time leading up to when you\nwere liberated. What it -- where you were, what happened and then how liberation took\nplace.",
        "A: Liberation from the camps or once we\u2019ve gotten out of the camps? I mean, which part\ndo you want to hear about?",
        "Q: Well, I was thinking sort of when the Russians picked you up. But if you want, you --\nwherever you would -- wherever you would like to start from, actually, would be fine.",
        "A: Okay, we can start --",
        "Q: It -- do you want to talk about how you got away from the camps?",
        "A: Well, actually, we were on the Death March and my particular group was liberated by\nthe Russian army. After we were liberated, we were put into a holding camp, which was a\nFritzie Fritshall does contain a 5 second black out at the beginning of the interview. The interviewer asked Ms.\nFritshall to state her name and where the interview was being conducted. In responding to the question, Ms.\nFritshall inadvertently stated her address. At the request of the interviewee, her statement of her address has been\nblacked out on the user copy and removed from the transcript to protect her privacy. However, the master copy and\nprotection copies have not been altered. The three asterisks in the body of the transcript indicate the removed\naddress spoken by Ms. Fritshall.\nDP camp. And, of course they had to delouse us. They had to give us medical attention\nand they feed us and try and sort of organize. I mean, we were a -- a -- a very displaced\ngroup, a very sick group at that point. And once they took our names and asked us if we\nhad a home to go to, or whatever -- some of us chose to go back to our original homes\nand some of us stayed behind and stayed in the DP camps for a long time. I was in a DP\ncamp for quite awhile and then I chose to go back home to my hometown, hoping that\npossibly my brothers or someone that had survived, had come back home and that we\ncould reunite. But I truly was mistaken, because no one came back. One aunt, who\nsurvived Auschwitz concentration camp, went to Budapest rather than coming to our\nhometown in Czechoslovakia, thinking that I hadn\u2019t survived, although sh -- she did see\nme in Auschwitz camp, so she knew I was there. But she thought that I, too had gone to\nthe gas chambers, as millions of others had. And when she heard that I had survived, she\ntoo came back home. So actually it was just the two of us. We came back home and\nfound our home -- my mother\u2019s home that we lived in, destroyed. Our home was used for\na lookout post. It was like on a little hill and the soldiers had used that and it was\ndestroyed. My grandmother\u2019s home -- which was my aunt\u2019s home who came back, stood.\nThe home was totally stripped of everything inside. There were nothing but walls and\nwindows left. And w-we moved into this home. Actually, I was the very first one to come\nhome in our community and I was the first one to move into my grandmother\u2019s home.\nAnd I would go and meet a train that passed through our little town once a day, hoping\nthat someone survived and people would come back. And little by little, some young\npeople did trickle back. And -- including my aunt and we all lived in my grandmother\u2019s\nhome. When we came back we had no money, we had no food and we just had the\nclothes on our backs. Our neighbors had stripped our homes, our furniture was used by\nneighbors. We recognized some of our clothes that was worn by some of our neighbors.\nBut no one came, no one offered and no one asked. What we had to do was go and dig\nfor potatoes in the field. Gather some potatoes and whatever we could from the harvest.\nAnd this is what we lived on for quite awhile. And I knew my father was in the United\nStates, but I did not know where. And I could have never found him, except that he found\nme. My dad had -- after the war, my dad had contacted some of the neighbors that he\nremembered and he wrote to the Post Office in our town, looking for his family, looking\nfor survivors. And I had gotten a letter through the Post Office, from my dad and gotten\nhis address and was able to get in touch with him. And he was able to send me American\ndollars through the letters that came. A five dollar bill, a 10 dollar bill -- which we were\nselling on the Black Market. At that time an American money, we were getting a lot for\nit, because the money in Europe was really devalued at that particular time, so we were\nable to buy food after awhile. We were also getting clothes through -- I believe it\u2019s the\nUnited Restitutio -- I don -- I don\u2019t know, it was called Unrah. I don\u2019t know what it\nstands for, actually.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we were getting clothes from them and I remember getting packages and opening\nthe packages and getting clothes that was actually used already and getting shoes that\ndidn\u2019t fit and looking for the candy that was inside and we were getting gum. And we\nwould open the package of gum and didn\u2019t know that we were supposed to chew this\ngum and chew it, you know, we just ate it like candy, thinking, \u201cGee, this 1s kind of\nfunny candy,\u201d you know?",
        "Q: You\u2019d never seen gum before?",
        "A: I had never seen gum before. And we stayed in my grandmother\u2019s home until some of\nthe organiza -- some of the young people were able to get it -- in touch with some of the\norganizations and some of them were getting help in other ways. And I was able to get in\ntouch with my dad. And then the borders closed. And I had gotten caught on the side of\nCommunism. Both my aunt and I had gotten caught on the side of Communism and we\nwere not able to leave. And I was not able to come to this country at that point, or get in\ntouch with my dad any longer.",
        "Q: Can I s-stop you here one second? You said the borders closed, do you remember\nwhat year that was?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. Actually, I don\u2019t remember the year -- the exact year.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we leave your story where it is at the moment, the borders have closed. I --\nif you wouldn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to go back a couple steps and ask you about a -- a couple\nthings you\u2019ve -- you\u2019ve mentioned already.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And bring out a little more detail. First of all, could you just tell us th-this aunt that\nyour -- you\u2019ve mentioned, could you tell us her name?",
        "A: Yes. She was my dad\u2019s sister and she\u2019s the only one that survived on my dad\u2019s side,\nactually, and her name was Freida Weiss. And eventually, she was also able to make her\nway to this country. My aunt had my dad, who was a brother and she had two other\nbrothers living in this country and through them she was able to make her way to this\ncountry.",
        "Q: And in your video interview, you talk about her and she was in the camp with you and\nyou tell that story. I'd like to go back to -- oh, sorry --",
        "A: No, the -- my aunt that I speak of in the video was my mother\u2019s sister. The aunt that\nI\u2019m speaking of now was my father\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: The aunt that I spoke of in the video had not survived the camps. We were separated\nin the camp and she was taken to another camp and I had found out years later, through\nsomeone that knew her and was 1n a camp with her, that she lived to see liberation. The\nday she -- the day her camp was liberated, she was still alive and died that day, the day\nthe camp was liberated. But, I think of her often, because she was my inspiration all\nthrough the camp. She was the one that kept telling me every single day, \u201cWe will make\nit and tomorrow will be better.\u201d I made it, she did not. But I couldn\u2019t have done it without\nher.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Her name was Bella Davidovitch.",
        "Q: And which camp did she --",
        "A: She -- we were separated. We were in Auschwitz together and then we were\nseparated. I was taken to -- actually, what happened was that our -- our barracks was\nemptied and we were put into a holding barrack and our barrack was to go into the gas\nchambers and we knew it. My -- they had a separation, my aunt was chosen to go onto a\ntruck to be taken somewhere\u2019s else and the last she saw of me was walking towards the\ngas chambers. And when she left me, she did not think that I had survived, she thought\nthat we had all gone to the gas chambers, her entire family and she really did not fight for\nher life at that point. So, possibly, if she had known some of us had survived, she maybe\ntoo, could have survived.",
        "Q: And you -- what you tell in your video, it\u2019s a remarkable story, you actually were in\nthe doorway, I believe, of the gas chamber?",
        "A: They -- people that were in Auschwitz, after they were in the camp for, I believe,\nprobably an hour, they knew about the gas chambers. You know, one separation had\ntaken place and once we were taken into the barracks and once we started to ask about\nour families, what had happened to our families, the people that had been in the barracks\nprior to us coming there, the prisoners, would point to the gas chambers. This is how we\nfound out what had happened to millions of others, to the children that we were separated\nfrom, to our parents, to the rest of our family, by just -- they would just raise their hand\nand they would tell us to look at the smoke. And of course, this is how we found out\nabout the gas chambers. We lived with it day in and day out we lived with the gas\nchambers. We watched the trains coming in, we watched the separations, we watched\npeople marching to the gas chambers, but there was no way we could help them or do\nanything. So, we learned -- we learned every single day, twice a day, there was a thing\ncalled a pell, where we all had to line up to be counted. When they called a pell in the\nmorning and at night, nobody wanted to be in the beginning of the line, or at the end of\nthe line, cause there was always punishment. People were always pulled from the\nbeginning of the line or the end of the line. Sometimes from the center, but basically, it\nwas easier to pull from the beginning or the end. So everybody fought to be in the center\nof the lines and there were only so many middles, somebody had to be in the beginning.\nBecause my aunt was on this particular truck, leaving, I had -- was hoping I could go\nwith her and so I was at the very end of the line and she watched all of us marching into\nthe gas chambers. And in the very last moment, six of us were pulled out and put onto\nanother truck to do s -- go to a factory to do slave labor. But her truck had pulled away\nalready and she did not see me not walking into the gas chamber, so she assumed that I\ntoo had gone into the gas chambers with the rest.",
        "Q: Yeah. And do you know if she ever knew whether you had survived? Did word ever\nreach her somehow? Do you have any way of knowing?",
        "A: I have no way of knowing, but I believe she did not know, because the people that\nwere with her, that told us that they knew her and she had died, remember her speaking\nabout everyone being killed one way or another or going to the gas chamber. So I -- I am\nassuming she did not know.",
        "Q: And do you know the day she died, which was the day when her camp was liberated?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the dates.",
        "Q: Yeah, no, no, not the date, but 1t was the day the camp was liberated that she died.\nWas that because of just, you know, illness or that she was in a run down condition, or --",
        "A: She was ill. She had gotten an infection in an -- in a leg -- 1s -- from what we had\nheard, and blood poisoning had set in her leg and at that point she really didn\u2019t care. She -\n- you know, when -- when we were in the camps, there -- there came a point, during a\nlow moment maybe or when hope was lost, where people didn\u2019t care whether they lived\nor died, especially if they knew no one else survived, they just didn\u2019t care. And at that\npoint, I believe that she didn\u2019t care. I don't know how else to express this, except that I --\nI believe that she felt she was the last one of the family and -- and she too gave up.",
        "Q: Sorry to bring this up, but something just came on, 1s that the air conditioning, or --",
        "A: Maybe. I don\u2019t know. Could be the refrigerator. I don\u2019t know how to shut it.",
        "Q: Oh. You never turn that off, huh? Okay. Occasional noises you might hear in the\nbackground, they\u2019re household appliances that can\u2019t be shut off.",
        "A: Well, it must be the air conditioner.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s hot in here and we need the air conditioner, guys.",
        "Q: Okay. All right, we'll just go -- we\u2019ll go along with that. So -- do you -- you were --\ndo you remember -- did you even have time much, to have much of a reaction when they\nsuddenly pulled you away from the gas chamber and sent you in another direction? Can\nyou remember what you felt or was it just so hectic that --",
        "A: Do you know, things were happening in the camp where one didn\u2019t have the normal\nfeelings. We were, for the lack of a better word, dehumanized, maybe? We learned to\naccept life as it was on that particular moment and when you are with people in a barrack\nfor a le -- any length of time and you see them marching into a gas chamber, you don\u2019t\nthink, \u201cWell gee, I am the lucky one, I walked away.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m not the lucky one,\nmaybe they are the lucky ones, because I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to be taking\nme and it might be worse than where I am now. So, the reaction was a -- was not, \u201cGee,\nI\u2019m really glad because I\u2019m still alive.\u201d It just -- you accept it as 1t comes, that particular\nmoment. The fear is always there, that you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re being taken, that\nyou\u2019re going to get less food than you had that particular moment. That you might be --\nfeel hunger more than you do that particular moment, because you\u2019re already hungry,\nyou\u2019re already abused, you\u2019re already skinny, you\u2019re already sick. And the moment\ncomes when you just say, \u201cOkay, this is another thing that\u2019s happening to me today.\u201d\nAnd so you just flow with it.",
        "Q: Did you know w -- that -- where -- while you were still in the camp, did you know\nwhere your aunt was or where she\u2019d been taken, or did you not find out what happened to\nher until the war was over?",
        "A: I did not know where she was being taken to. As far as I was concerned, she could\nhave been taken to another camp and put to death in a -- in a gas chamber in another\ncamp. I didn\u2019t know what she did or -- or even if she was alive, until after the war.\nActually, we found out -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a big world, but it\u2019s a small world. You\nknow, you talk to people and one will say, \u201cWell, I was in this camp,\u201d or \u201cI was in that\ncamp.\u201d And when you give a family name or when you start asking, people remember\nand people know and you get a little information.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And this is how I found out.",
        "Q: In your video, you describe it, maybe just very briefly here you could say, you -- you\ndid get out of the camp and then you got into the forest, basically, towards the end of the\nwar. Where -- where\u2019d you -- can you tell us the name of the forest, where 1t was?",
        "A: No. We were -- what -- what they did is, I don\u2019t know if you saw any other videos, but\n-- but -- or if you\u2019ve read anything about the Holocaust, but towards the end of the war,\nwhen Hitler started to lose the war, he started -- I use the word he because of Hitler, but\nbasically it\u2019s -- he didn\u2019t do it alone, obviously, he had his machinery that worked for\nhim, all the people that ran the camps and gathered the Jews and drove the Jews to the\ndeath camps and drove the trains and so forth. I -- I will refer to them as his mach-\nmachinery, because this is what it was. They -- the Germans started to empty the factories\nwhere slave labor -- labor was being done. They started to bring the people in from all\nover, wherever they did slave labor and they brought them together with the people in\nconcentration camps and they created a group at that point, a huge, huge group. Men and\nwomen together at that point. And it is known today as a Death March. It was -- they\nbrought us all together, we were in rags. I recall that I had -- my -- my shoes didn\u2019t fit,\nmy clogs. I could hardly walk in them because I had outgrown them, obviously. And it\nwas very cold and I -- I recall taking rags and wrapping rags around my feet as I was\nwalking. And they really walked us in circles, at least 1t seemed to us as 1f we were\nwalking in circles. They walked us through the towns, they walked us through fields.\nThey -- we slept in -- around haystacks. I mean they -- then -- and whatever. Most of us\nwere very sick, some people had gotten dysentery and they had to stop, of course and\nthey were being shot on the spot. They would walk us into -- through forest areas and I\nrecall at one point sleeping on the fields and just watching the planes -- the planes, I\nmean, American planes coming down low, passing us and we were hoping that they\nwould bomb us. We were sick, we were tired, we were hungry, we were thirsty and we\ndidn\u2019t care. At one point they started to walk us through a forest. We were on the road\nactually, but -- but the road was through the forests. And a friend and I realized that some\nof the people were trying to escape at that point. And it was also towards the very end of\nthe war and the Germans were also tired, taking us through the fields, you know, and all\nof this. And when -- we were watching people escape and they were shooting at these\npeople and -- and they were -- they were being horrible to us, even at that point. I recall,\nas we were walking through towns -- they would walk us through towns -- the people in\ntown knew and saw and heard, we were like -- like a herd of cattles taking over this town\nand walking through the town. I recall shades being pulled down, windows being closed,\ndoors being locked so that they wouldn\u2019t -- they pretended they didn\u2019t see and they didn\u2019t\nhear. But yes, occasionally, a window would open and a piece of bread would come out,\na potato would come out. Something would fly out a window. We all pounced on this\nbecause we were terribly hungry, they weren\u2019t feeding us. And we would pounce on this\nfood and th-the SS men -- the soldiers would shoot at us in groups. We didn\u2019t care, we\nwanted that piece of bread, we wanted that food. When we came to this forest, my aunt\nand | -- my -- my girlfriend and I took our hands and looked at each other and said we\u2019re\ngoing to try to escape. If they shoot us, they shoot us, but we cannot take this any longer,\nwe will try to escape. And we picked a time where they -- other people also tried to\nescape on both sides and the soldiers were busy shooting at other people and we escaped\nand they did try to shoot at us at that point, then we came into a forest. If I tell you that\nevery time I think of this escape, I can count my heartbeat even today. I mean, our hearts\nwere -- we -- we took each other\u2019s hands after we hid behind -- behind some bushes and\ntrees, and we took each other\u2019s hands and we were feeling each other\u2019s hearts as our\nhearts were beating. It was like it was going to come out, pop out. And we stayed in that\nforest all night long. We stayed hidden and we watched people walking by -- the\nprisoners walking by. The next day, we stayed in the forest and when it started to get\ndark, we decided that we\u2019re going to try and see if we can find a home, a farm, steal food\nsomewhere, steal clothes somewheres. You need to remember, our heads were shaved,\nwe were very skinny, we were in striped uniforms. I mean, you could -- you could spot\nus a mile away, we couldn\u2019t lie about who or what we were, okay? We came to this farm,\nand we were two dumb kids. We were totally dumb children. We knocked on the door\nand I recall a man opening the door and staring at us and all we said is that we\u2019re very\nhungry. And we spoke German, we lived in Germany. And he looked at us and he said,\nwell, he couldn\u2019t give us food, but he will take us into the barn. Well, he took us into the\nbarn and he let us stay in the barn and he did bring us food, he brought us pieces of bread\nand he brought us some hot soup. And he let us stay in the barn and we were supposedly\nhidden in this barn. The next morning he came to us and he said he has to go into town\nand he has to get food stamps for us. Now here are two -- two Jewish kids that are hiding\nin a German barn, dumb, believing this man is going to go and get food stamps for us,\nbecause he has to had food stamps or whatever story he told us, in order to feed us, and\nwe believed. We\u2019re two stupid kids and we believed. And we stood there and we looked\nat each other and he left. And all of a sudden it dawned on us, this man is going to turn us\nin. I mean, what is he going to do, go and tell people he\u2019s getting food ti -- food stamps\nfor two Jewish kids? So we stayed there and we watched him leave. And his wife stayed\nin the house. And we left the barn and we went into the forest area again and we hid in\nthe forest. And we were trying to pick, we picked snails. Today, it\u2019s called escargot and\nit\u2019s a delicacy. Do you know what snails look like when they come out of dirt and dirty\nsnails? We absolutely had no water to wash them with. We dug for whatever food we\ncould in the forest and we stayed in the forest and eventually we saw the Russian army\ncome in and take over, and we went out. And the Russians took us and they put us on --\non a truck and they took us to an area where they already had -- had freed some prisoners,\nand --",
        "Q: If I could just --",
        "A: -- we joined this -- this group.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you -- you -- how did you -- how did you see the Russians? You --\nyou could just see --",
        "A: We could see them through -- as they -- we saw their trucks. We saw their trucks\ncoming and we saw their insignia and we knew it was -- we didn\u2019t care who it was as\nlong as it wasn\u2019t the Germans. I mean, it could have been Pakistani for all we knew. I\nmean, it happened to have been the Russians, but at that point we didn\u2019t know it was the\nRussian lead -- we just knew an army came and we were going to be freed. But it was the\nRussian army that came.",
        "Q: Do you remember exactly how you met them when you walked up to them? What -- if\nyou could tell me what happened, what -- you know --",
        "A: I just recall walking out. My -- my friend and I, the two of us just walked out of the\nforest and they saw us and they knew -- they knew who we were. They gave us food. I\nremember one man, in fact, one of the soldiers, a Russian soldier, pulled up his sleeve\nand he had watches. He had an arm full of watches on his -- and he looked at me, he said,\n\u201cDo you want to pick a watch?\u201d I mean, the last thing in the world I ever wanted at that\npoint was a watch and I said, \u201cNo.\u201d And he had a man\u2019s ring and he took off a man\u2019s ring\nand he gave it to me. To this day I don\u2019t know what I did with the ring, cause I don\u2019t\nhave it and I must have lost it somewheres, cause it didn\u2019t fit me. He handed me this ring.\nHe just wanted -- he wanted to be nice. He -- he -- he saw that we were these two hungry\nkids and he tried to be nice to us and he was. And they brought us into this -- which they\nestablished, a DP camp and there were people there already and they had given us a\nshower and they gave us -- they deloused us and they gave us clean clothes and they gave\nus food and they -- medical attention for those that needed medical attention and I\nremember them telling us, eat slowly, just a little bit of soup, just -- and -- and I just\nwanted to take all of that in at one point, you know, but I must say at that point, they\nwere good to us, they were nice. You know, so --",
        "Q: Did you -- you know, you -- you mentioned the guy offering you a watch, did you\neven know what the date was?",
        "A: No and I don\u2019t know to this day. I have no recollection. I have a bad memory for dates\nanyhow. I mean, I had to ask what today\u2019s date was.",
        "Q: Right. I mean, I -- I wa -- my -- the -- the point -- my question Is -- is -- given the\ncircumstances you were in, at the time did you even know what the date was?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you even know what month it was?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you know what year it was?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t even know what day it was. I mean you lose -- totally lose\ntrack. I -- if you\u2019ve ever been in a hospital and they give you drugs or -- or whatever and\nyou\u2019re there three days, you think you\u2019ve been there a month. You just lose track of time\nand it didn\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t care. You know, there are -- certain people have certain\npriorities. I didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to get out of -- of the clothes that -- that was biting\nme, that I wanted -- needed to be deloused and I needed to know that there was a taste of\nfreedom.",
        "Q: Where was this camp, roughly? What country?",
        "A: It was -- I -- I believe it was in Germany -- a area of Germany they -- they took over,\nyou know, and it was in Germany, but I don\u2019t know. It was -- they had -- the particular\ncamp was -- there were houses that I was put into, 1t was -- they had taken over like an\napartment building. You know, like several -- actually several apartment buildings they\nhad taken over. And I recall that they had put like -- like wires on the windows so that the\nsoldiers -- the Russian soldiers couldn\u2019t get at the women. They weren\u2019t protecting us\nfrom their soldiers, they were protecting their soldiers from us, cause we were carriers of\ndisease at that point and they were sure -- wanted to make sure that their soldiers\nwouldn\u2019t get at any of the women. So --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, with\nFritzie Fritzshall. This is tape number one, side B.",
        "A: -- wires on the windows so that the soldiers -- the Russian soldiers couldn\u2019t get at the\nwomen. They weren\u2019t protecting us from their soldiers, they were protecting their\nsoldiers from us, cause we were carriers of disease at that point and they were sure --\nwanted to make sure that their soldiers wouldn\u2019t get at any of the women. So we were\nreally being guarded at that point, you know. But, it was --",
        "A: But it was -- 1t was to protect you, or to protect them?",
        "Q: To protect them. We still didn\u2019t have medical attention, we were still not deloused at\nthat point and you know, when you come out of a camp, who knows what kind of a\ndisease you have? And these were soldiers and they were afraid of -- you know, that they\nwould come and rape us, or whatever. And they were protecting their soldiers from us.\nSo we were getting protection in the same way, actually, but 1t wasn\u2019t for our protection,\nit was for theirs, you know?",
        "Q: And what happens next?",
        "A: Well, I was there for awhile, until they gave me medical attention and they fed me and\nthey deloused me and there was a lot of talk amongst ourselves, amongst the people that\nwere freed. Amongst the Jews who -- where are we going to go? What are we going to\ndo? Do we have a home to go to? Who has survived? Do we want to go back to our\nhometowns? These are the people that didn\u2019t want us. We were afraid to go back to our\nhometowns. So there were a lot of discussions of what to do, but how long can you stay\nin a DP camp and how long are they going to keep you in a DP camp? Although today I\nknow that many people stayed for many months in DP camps, but I didn\u2019t know this at\nthe time. I was anxious to get out of there and I chose to go back to my hometown. And\nthe Russians did give me passage to go to my hometown. Didn\u2019t give me extra money,\ndid not give me any extra clothes, but did give me passage to go back to my hometown.\nAnd when I -- of course when I came home, I found nothing and no one.",
        "Q: Let me just ask couple things. One is, the friend that you escaped with into the forest,\nwhat was her --",
        "A: We lost each other. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t even -- we knew each other by first names, but\nwe hever even knew each other\u2019s last names. And sometimes that was done on purpose.\nWhen you were in a barrack with someone, you didn\u2019t want to know their last name\nbecause today they were your friend and tomorrow they were in a gas chambers or they\nwere laying in a ditch somewheres and we couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t handle it and it was\nmuch easier to handle if I just knew your first name.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: So, oftentimes we didn\u2019t ask for last names. And after we were liberated, we just lost\ntouch with each other.",
        "Q: Do you remember her first name?",
        "A: Her first name was Sima.",
        "Q: Sima? Could you spell that? Do you know?",
        "A: I -- I think it\u2019s S-i-m-a, I think.",
        "Q: Okay. And you decided to go back to your town. If you could tell us the name of your\ntown and where it was.",
        "A: The name of the town was Klucharky and it is better known by -- there was a -- like a\nbig city, which even today, it\u2019s called Mooncartch or Mooncartchavo in the Czech\nlanguage. Kluchark -- Mooncartchavo at that point was known for it\u2019s Jewish culture, it\nwas known for it\u2019s -- the Yeshivas, which are Jewish universities and it\u2019s even today a\nvery well-known city. And we lived like -- it was like a suburb, like maybe Evanston to\nChicago kind of a suburb and we used to walk to the big city all the time. And so I chose\nto go back home. And after I was in touch with my dad, I wanted to come to this country\nand of course he tried to get me to this country, but then Communism took over and the\nborders were closed. And --",
        "Q: I -- If I -- again, I\u2019m sorry to stop you here, but this is sort of where we left off before\nand you said that when you got back to the town that the people of the town -- 1f you\ncould describe again what it was like to go back there, how they saw you returning. You\nsaid that you saw people wearing clothes, living in your houses. Tell us a little more\nabout that.",
        "A: How does one describe of -- seeing someone or not seeing someone, okay? We were\nthe people -- we were the Jews that came back, that our neighbors gave up, okay? One\nway or another they gave us up. They turned in our names when the Germans first came\nin. They may not have pointed all of us out on the street, but they did have to turn in our\nnames. When we were being gathered -- when we were being taken to the train, while we\nwere in the ghetto, in our hometown, these neighbors never came to ask if we needed\nanything, if they could help us, if we were hungry, if we were thirsty. We were in this\nghetto as prisoners. When we came back, after the war, we were the people that didn\u2019t\nexist. They looked through us. They didn\u2019t speak to us, they didn\u2019t acknowledge us. They\ndidn\u2019t ask us if we needed anything. They didn\u2019t offer to give back my mother\u2019s clothes\nor my mother\u2019s furniture. They didn\u2019t offer to make us a meal. We were just the invisible\npeople, so to speak. So, we came back, but as far as they were concerned, they didn\u2019t\naccept us back. And, when you go to a place where you\u2019re not accepted, you in turn get\nthis attitude of, well, they didn\u2019t really want me, so I don\u2019t want them either, okay? And\nwe did the best we could without associating with neighbors. Which is very strange\nbecause, if you\u2019ve been to Europe, the houses are close together. It\u2019s -- you live as a\ncommunity. Prior to the war, we lived as a -- as a community, we were part of the\ncommunity. We went to school together, we lived together, we -- we played together.\nAnd here I come back home -- this was my home, I came back home. But there was\nnobody waiting for me and nobody to accept me back into this community. So, it was a\nvery strange feeling and I have to tell you that I couldn\u2019t wait to get away from there. I\ncouldn\u2019t wait to get out of there. I was afraid to go to sleep at night. I don't know if you\ncan understand this today, but there was -- we -- we lived with the fear of bei -- being\nturned in again. There -- there was no freedom when we came back. We had to leave.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any encounters with any of your former neighbors or\nacquaintances? Any -- any conversations, encounters in the street, anything you\nremember? Or you stayed in these sort of sep -- they were in their separate world and you\nwere in your separate world at that point?",
        "A: It was a totally separate world. It was strange because when my dad -- after I had\ncontacted my dad and he had gotten my first letter, he called me long distance, of course,\nto -- to Europe, from the United States. We had one telephone in town and that was in the\npost office. So the postman came to tell me that I was going to get a long distance call\ntomorrow at three o\u2019clock, from America. I mean America was this -- this big country,\nyou know, the -- the symbol of freedom. When I came to the post office, the next day at\nthree o\u2019clock, to wait for my call, the entire town was out there listening and looking, but\nnobody acknowledged me, but the ears were all there. And, so it was kind of interesting,\nbecause obviously they knew. Everybody listened in and of course, when you are not\nused to speaking on a telephone, you shout. You think that you need to shout cause, you\nknow, the ocean and -- and it\u2019s going to get across the ocean, you know? And, so\nobviously they did hear my end of the conversation. I\u2019m sure they heard it across the\nocean, you know, cause I was shouting, but didn\u2019t hear the other end of the conversation.\nBut they were curious enough to leave their homes and to come to this. But no offer of\nany help. And, I think to this day, I live in a sense of amazement, shock, maybe wonder,\nthat people could be that way -- that people could act that way. That if people see a\nhungry child, not to offer food. That, of people to see someone hurting, not to ask why. It\nwas an amazing world and amazing people and to this day I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t\nunderstand it. And probably, if I were to go back there today and speak to them about\nthis, they would see it in a different way and they would remember it in a different way\nthan I do. But I have a very clear hurt -- hurt memory of this, that even after the war -- I\nthink I would have respected them more if they had come to us after the war and if they\nhad said, \u201cThis was a mad world, we didn\u2019t know what we were doing.\u201d Or, \u201cWe did\nknow what we were doing, but we misjudged.\u201d Or, \u201cHow can we help you today, to\novercome this?\u201d Or, \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry for what happened.\u201d I would look at these\npeople and I would say, \u201cI can understand.\u201d But I can not understand indifference.\nIndifference hurts. Indifference causes wars. Indifference causes children to be killed and\ncauses hunger and I think we all need to care. And maybe we\u2019 ve learned from this. But\nright after the war, the lesson wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: I take it from what you\u2019re saying that you\u2019ve never gone back to the area?",
        "A: I\u2019ve been back to Europe and I was not far and I was going to cross the border and I\nwas going to go back there, out of curiosity. You need to know that there 1s a place that I\nwas born in, I have wonderful memories of. And also very sad and very bitter memories.\nThe draw is there to go back and relive some of my good memories, but the other part is\nthat there\u2019s no one I know there. Do I really want to see what my house looks like today?\nDo I really want to go back? And there\u2019s this -- this constant fight, there\u2019s this -- yes, part\nof me wants to go back and see and the other part of me says, \u201cBut you weren\u2019t wanted\nthere. You left there cause you weren\u2019t wanted there, why do you want to go back?\u201d But\nI\u2019m also going to Europe in three weeks, through the Washington Holocaust Museum and\nthis thought plays in my mind even today, am I going to go back, am I not? Cause I\u2019m\nnot going to be that far. So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: The other time, you decided not to go?",
        "A: I decided not to go. The hurt was -- I couldn\u2019t face it. I chose not to face it. The\nmemories are too fresh. When I -- many people -- most of us were liberated from the\ncamps 50 some years ago. I was liberated when I started to speak about my experiences\nand the memories are still too fresh. And I -- I can\u2019t face the hurt just now.",
        "Q: Do you remember -- you s -- you were talking about -- talking to your father on the\nphone, now that was the first time in years you\u2019d heard his voice, I\u2019ve -- I guess, right?\nCause he was in America while -- while all this happened to the rest of your family.\nOther than the people all being there and listening to you, can you re -- you remember\nmuch of that conversation or what it felt like to -- to finally be able to -- to speak with\nhim again?",
        "A: I -- th-the one memory that I really have of is him crying at one end on the phone and\nme crying at the other end of the phone. And him asking of do I know if anybody else\nhad survived and -- and telling me that he was going to try and bring me to this country,\nthat he wanted me to come here. And my end was mostly, \u201cOh, yes,\u201d you know. And --\nand I remember the tears, just a lot of -- a-at that point they were tears of sadness and of\nhappiness and -- and the first conversation was -- was a very sad conversation for both of\nUS.",
        "Q: How old were you at that point?",
        "A: I think I was 15.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So then I guess the next step 1s to get to America, huh?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s not so easy to get to America when you live in Europe right after the war\nand you\u2019re caught under Communism. So there are steps to be taken from there. Some o -\n- some of the Jews had left that part of the country and had gone to -- the -- the areas had\nbecome divided and part of Germany had become the Su -- the Sudatenlands. And my\nmother\u2019s one brother had lived and gone to the Sudatenlands and he knew that I had\nsurvived and he was in touch with me. And he paid a man money to have me smuggled\nover the border from where I lived, under Communism, into the Sudatenlands. So, he\npaid this man money and this man was a professional smuggler of people. And there\nwere several of us 1n this group, several women. And he collected the money ahead of\ntime and he took us in the group. It was in the winter, in snow up to our knees, in the\nmiddle of the night. We all gathered and had our little knapsacks on our backs and he is\ngoing to help us cross the border. So now, he takes us at night and he takes us into the\nforest and we\u2019re going to cross the border, okay? We came into the forest in the middle\nof the night and he -- we walked -- after walking hours and hours and hours in snow in --\nin -- in the forest and slipping and being cold and being hungry and he brings us into a\nlittle bit of a shack, some sort of a shack. And in this shack, there are beds and there\u2019s hot\nsoup waiting for us. And it was nice and warm and he told us that we are to spend the\nnight in this shack and we\u2019re to have the hot soup and get a good night\u2019s rest. And he is\ngoing to come back the next day and he 1s going to lead us the rest of the way. And he\nleaves us and he forgets to come back. He never came back. So, we stayed in this little\nshack -- cottage -- whatever it was, for two days and three days and four days and we\ndidn\u2019t know whether we had crossed the border or hadn\u2019t crossed the border. We didn\u2019t\nknow which way the border was and we didn\u2019t know what to do. And we finally realized\nthat this man is not going to come back. So, we decided we\u2019re going to take a chance and\njust pick a direction and we\u2019re going to go in a particular direction, which we did. And\nwe made our way through the forest at night and when daybreak came, we came to a little\ntown and we came near a river. And there were small boats near the river that were\nturned over -- like dinghies, I guess they call them, they were turned over because it was\nwinter. And so we did -- in the -- in the day, we all climbed underneath these boats. You\nknow, two or three of us would take one little boat and we climbed underneath the boat\nand we spend the day there and when evening came, we came out of the boats. At this\npoint we\u2019re hungry and we came out and we started to walk into town, three of us at one\npoint. And we came into the town and when I looked up at the town -- I don\u2019t even recall\nnow, I remembered my grandmother had family living in this town. So, I started to ask\nquestions and their name was Weissburger, so I stopped someone on the street and I\nasked, \u201cDo you know where the Weissburgers live and did any of them come back?\u201d And\nthe person said, \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are two brothers that survived the war and\ncame back,\u201d\u2019-- excuse me -- and showed us where to go. So the three of us came to my\ncousin, who opened the door and when I -- they didn\u2019t known me and I told them who I\nwas and what we -- what had happened. They took us in and they went and brought the\nrest of the group to come to their home. At that point, when we crossed the bor -- when\nthe man was going to bring us across the border, we all had families or friends waiting\nfor us with falsified papers, so we could stay in the Sudatenlands, okay? My uncle was\nwaiting for me with falsified papers and I also had one cousin that crossed the border\nwith me and she was going to be met by someone else with falsified papers. Well, we\nstayed with my family there for several days and their friends and families were notified\nand they all came to get them with their papers, as did my uncle. My cousin couldn\u2019t get\nin touch with whoever it was who was bringing her papers and she walked out one day\nand she was caught and sent back over the border. I had learned since that she stayed\nthere and had married someone and had raised a family, but stayed under Communism. I,\non the other hand, went to where my uncle lived and stayed with him. My uncle had a\nlittle grocery store and I helped him in this grocery store. After a while, he also smuggled\nmy aunt, who came to stay with me in Europe. He had her smuggled out with someone\nelse and she also lived with us in this little grocery store and we helped my uncle. I was\nable to get in touch with my father through there -- through letters, and he was able to\nsend me papers. He also -- every time he wrote me a le-letter, there was either a dollar\nbill or a five dollar bill or a ten dollar bill in there. What I didn\u2019t know was that my mail\nwas being censored, okay? But it was handed to me. The day I was leaving on the train,\nwith my feet on the train, with my passport in hand, the police came to ask me what\nhappened to the money that my father had sent me, because that meant that I was selling\nat black market, right? My aunt is standing at the train, my uncle is standing at the train,\nmy friends came to see me off, there are motorcycles all over the place that friends came\nto see me off cause I was leaving the Sudatenlands and going to Sweden. I am standing\non the steps of this train as the police are looking at me and asking me what happened to\nthe money. And I held up my passport and visa and I said, \u201cOh, I had to pay for my\npassport and my visa with that money. I had to go and pay.\u201d And the train started and I\nleft. It was like, I can\u2019t believe I was thinking this fast. What made me give this answer?\nYou know, so it was quite a -- quite an escape at that point.",
        "Q: Hm. You had mentioned before getting the -- you all were getting the packages from\nthe UN with -- was that in this place, was that in the -- in your old hometown? Where\nwere you --",
        "A: It was in my old -- in my hometown we were getting it, when we first came home,\nthey were -- the Unrah packages were coming, you know. And I remember getting what\nwe called the high button shoes, which -- you know, the shoes that were lacing up. You\nknow, you\u2019re a young girl, you come out of a camp and you gain a little bit of weight and\n-- and you think the world is all yours and here I\u2019m -- I may not have had much, but I\ndon\u2019t really want to wear those ugly shoes. I mean, couldn\u2019t they have sent -- I\u2019m sure\nthat in America, they have nicer shoes, I mean. But we didn\u2019t care about the clothes, we\nwanted the food. We kept opening the packages and we wou -- there would be cookies in\nthere. There would be candy bars in there, cigarettes, gum and also clothes and some\ncanned -- canned goods were in there and so we -- we appreciated the food. We may have\nlooked down on the shoes, but we did appreciate the food, because we were hungry even\nthere and we needed -- everything was being rationed still. And we truly thanked -- every\ntime a package came, we said thank you. We -- we did appreciate it.",
        "Q: Did you ever catch on that the gum was for chewing?",
        "A: Not until I came here. Not until I came to this country did I catch on that gum is to be\nchewed. No, it was very sweet and it was -- it tasted like candy and probably still\ngrowing in my stomach.",
        "Q: So you get on the train and your next stop 1s Sweden?",
        "A: Came to Sweden and we came to Sweden and stayed in Sweden several days and\nSweden to me, at that time, was the land of plenty. It was Guttenburg, Sweden. And we\nwere given all the chocolate we wanted, we were given food, we were given fruit. I\nremember I was given a banana and I hated -- I -- the smell of banana and -- and could\nnever eat the banana, but there you could have had all the bananas you wanted. And from\nthere I was -- I took a ship called the Grippsholm, which I believe is still in service today,\nit\u2019s a Swedish liner. And I came over with many of our young people, many Jewish\npeople that were lucky enough to get their passports and visas. Immigration was very,\nvery tight right after the war, to come into this country. This country didn\u2019t open it\u2019s\ndoors freely to us immigrants. And at that point, one had to show that one had family\nhere or friends that could vouch for them, that th -- they wouldn\u2019t be a burden on the\ngovernment. The government did not want to support us in any way, so we had to prove\nthat there was someone we were coming to. It took a long time to get the passports and\nthe visas. I was one of the lucky people, because I was still what was considered under\nage. And so I was able to get my passport and my visa and came over on a child\u2019s -- still\non a child\u2019s passport and visa, so I -- my -- the quota -- I did not have to wait for the long\nquota numbers at that particular time. And so when we boarded the ship, the Grippsholm,\nwe tried to stay together. We did not have first class passage, let me tell you. And I\nremember my cabinmate -- is that what they call them? The person that shared the cabin\nwith me was an American young woman. And -- a very pretty young woman and she had\na birthmark on her face -- a dark birthmark on her face. We could not communicate in\nany way. She was a little older than I was and she ignored me very much at that point.\nAnd we couldn\u2019t communicate anyhow, so it didn\u2019t matter. But I remember sitting up on\nmy bunk bed and -- cause we had the -- up, and watching her put on make-up and I didn\u2019t\nknow anything about make-up at that point, but I remember watching her, how she was\ncovering up that birthmark. And when she covered it up with make-up, one couldn\u2019t see\nit and she was absolutely beautiful and really had this beautiful smile. But we would stay\nby ourselves. The young people -- the young Jewish people would stay by ourselves. And\nI need to tell you that I really wanted to come and see my dad and wanted to come to this\ncountry as freedom, but my first choice was Israel. I wanted to go to Israel, cause most of\nmy friends, at that point, were going to Israel. I didn\u2019t care that I was being smuggled\ninto Israel, I didn\u2019t care that I had to fight for the freedom there. I felt that was going to\nbe my country and I wanted to go to Israel, but because my dad was here and the need to\nsee him, I came to this country.",
        "Q: Did you ever -- either on the telephone or in writing to your father while he was trying\nto get you over here, bring that up with him?",
        "A: No. No, I never did. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him in any way and I was just happy to be\nreunited with him. But my ultimate goal was to go to Israel. I mean, I was going to come\nhere and then go to Israel. And I remember going into -- we left Sweden and we came to\nEngland and then we came to New York. And I had my dad\u2019s brother and sister-in-law --\nmy uncle, whom I remembered from Europe, he left. He was one of the lucky ones, he\nwas able to leave. He was like almost the last person able to leave Europe and come to\nthis country. And I remembered skipping school. We still lived in freedom at that point\nand, skipping school and going to the train to watch him leave. Cause I love him, he was\n-- my dad was here and he sort of became like my dad. And I remember being punished\nfor skipping school. So, when I came to this country, he was the one that met me in New\nYork and he and his wife, who was American born, and -- took me to New Jersey. And at\nthat point it was East Orange, New Jersey and I didn\u2019t see my dad til the next day. But I\nremember my mother also had a sister living in Brooklyn and when my aunt and uncle\ncame to meet me in New York, my aunt\u2019s sister -- my -- my mother\u2019s sister also came.\nNow this was -- one was my father\u2019s brother and sister-in-law and one was my mother\u2019s\nsister. My father and my aunt didn\u2019t get along and -- and -- so one was pulling me to go\nto their house and one was pulling me to go to her house, cause I was her sister\u2019s\ndaughter and she wanted me to go there. But I wound up going with my uncle, whom I\nknew, because I did not know my aunt on the other side. I mean I knew -- didn\u2019t even\nknow she existed until I came into this country. And I stayed with my aunt and uncle and\nwent to bed that night and I remember waking up the very next morning and someone\nwas sitting on the edge of my bed, looking down at me. This man is sitting at the edge of\nthe bed, staring at me as I am sleeping. And you know, you get that feeling and I opened\nmy eyes and it was my dad. He -- he was -- that\u2019s the first I had seen him in many, many\nyears. In fact, I didn\u2019t even remember him. So, it was a very strange feeling.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know he was going to be there, huh?",

        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: Well, what happened? We were -- in -- in the very beginning --",
        "Q: I was -- I was thinking, right then, do you remember any more of tha-that scene right\nthere? I mean, quite a scene.",
        "A: The scene Is -- it\u2019s very hard to describe. How does one describe a father seeing his\nchild for the first time in many years? Or -- or a child seeing her father for the first time,\nin freedom? It was a lot of emotion. I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t even describe it. And especially\non my dad\u2019s part, because I believe that all his life, he lived with the guilt that he left and\nhe lost his family there. He lost his two sons, he lost his wife. He didn\u2019t leave us by\nchoice, he didn\u2019t desert us. He left us to make a better living for himself and for us, so it\nisn\u2019t that he walked away from us; he always supported us. But his feelings were always\nthat maybe if he had stayed, he could have done something more. Or maybe if he --\nmaybe he could have sent papers sooner -- which he couldn\u2019t. We had all our papers to\ncome to this country. We just got caught in the madness of it. And he never should have\nfelt guilt and he never should have blamed himself, because he did whatever he needed to\ndo and the best he knew how. So, I honestly believe that all his life, he lived with -- with\nthe guilts of that. But as far as I was concerned, he nee -- he -- he didn\u2019t need to, because\nhe couldn\u2019t have done more. And he certainly did everything he could for me, once I\ncame here. I was one of the lucky ones. Many survivors that came to this country didn\u2019t\nhave it easy when they first came here. Many tell the stories of being brought here, but\nfamilies were sending them to work the next day and they had to live in -- in -- in the\nbasement and they weren\u2019t really welcome and they had very hard times. My dad was not\na wealthy man, but he certainly provided for me when I first came. He gave me love. I\nnever lived with him when I first came here, cause he lived in a small apartment and I\nlived with his brother and sister-in-law, who -- my aunt and uncle and my aunt, to this\nday -- she\u2019s 82 years old and if she was my mother I couldn\u2019t love her more and she\ncouldn\u2019t have been better to me. I came to a loving family. I came to a family that opened\ntheir arms to me and did the best they knew how. So I really was one of the lucky ones.",
        "Q: Where was your father living at this time?",
        "A: My father lived here in Chicago, on Armitage Avenue.",
        "Q: Okay, so he -- he met you in New York, but --",
        "A: Brought me back here.",
        "Q: Brought you here?",
        "A: Brought me here and I lived here all the time.",
        "Q: And your aunt and the other people you\u2019re talking about were also here?",
        "A: Lived here -- yes, lived here in Chicago and to this day my aunt is the most loving,\nmost wonderful lady. Had three children of her own and raised me as her own. Taught\nme how to speak English. Taught me -- sent me to school. Made sure I learned how,\nwhen and where, the ways of this country and was just wonderful. So, I was one of the\nlucky people that came to a loving family.",
        "Q: You talked about the -- the guilt your father felt. Is -- that whole situation. Did you\nand he ever discuss that or is what you just described basic -- comes from your\nunderstanding of him? Did you ever talk about it or was just something you -- you knew\nand felt?",
        "A: My father was a man of few words. You could be in the same room with my dad all\nday long and maybe you would hear five words out of him. I don\u2019t know where I got the\ngift of gab, but certainly not from him. He was a very quiet individual. My dad talked to\nme once, actually -- deep talk, once. Do I know what happened to my mother and am I\nsure my mother died? Am I sure my brothers died? No, I wasn\u2019t sure my brothers died at\nthat point, cause I saw them alive once in Auschwitz. My dad and I tried to trace them\nthrough organizations, but obviously couldn\u2019t. He wanted to find his family. We talked\nabout the war once and then we didn\u2019t talk about it any longer. He didn\u2019t talk to me\nbecause he felt that he was opening wounds. I didn\u2019t discuss it with him because I felt the\nsame way, but by his looks and by his actions -- he did remarry many years later -- many\nyears later. In fact, I was married already and -- and -- excuse me -- I believe I was\npregnant with my son when my dad remarried. So, it took him all of these many years to\nremarry. But I believe that he lived with his guilts all his life, cause he loved his family.\nHe wanted his family.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Herman Weiss. When I went back to -- to Auschwitz several years ago, back then --\n\u201893, I believe, there\u2019s a room in Auschwitz where it has all luggage, suitcases. I walked\ninto this room and the first suitcase that stares at me is Weiss, W-e-1-s-s. That was my\nmaiden name. Do I know if it was ours? No. Would I recognize it? No. Could it have\nbeen? Yes. Do you know what that does to one\u2019s insides? Standing there, looking at that?",
        "Q: When you did come over, what year was that?",
        "A: I came over in \u201845, I believe.",
        "Q: It was *45 and you\u2019re -- are you still --",
        "A: \u201845 -- 40 s -- *46.",
        "Q: \u201846. So you\u2019re still, what, 15 - 16, somewhere -- somewhere in there. Was it hard to --\nyou know, it sounds like in many ways you were 1n a really good situation with your\nfamily. Was it hard to adjust to this country? Was this a very strange place? Did you like\nit, did it kind of put you o -- how did you feel about that?",
        "A: When I first came -- when I first got off the sh -- the ship in New York and I\u2019m in this\ncar with my aunt and uncle and they take me into a Walgreen\u2019s for a soda -- ice cream,\nokay? Now, here I am, in this Walgreen\u2019s that 1s big and that has everything. Here it is\nselling medicine on one corner and you can buy a pair of shoes in the other corner. Now,\nin Europe, it\u2019s an -- if it\u2019s a drugstore, it only sells medicine, you know. Dat -- apotocare\n-- | can\u2019t even pronounce it -- where it\u2019s -- medicine is sold. And I remember sitting there\nand just sitting on this stool that would turn. What do they call those stools, where you\ncould turn them and you could turn in all directions? By the counter, the counter stools.\nAnd I remember holding the soda in -- in my hand and just turning in this chair in\namazement and looking around in this drugstore where you can just walk and take\nsomething off a shelf and just pay for it. There\u2019s everything here in this drugstore and I\u2019m\nsaying to myself, \u201cMy God,\u201d you know, \u201cwhere am I, what is 1t?\u201d And of course, New\nYork City, do I need to tell you about the tax1 cabs\u2019? I mean, it wasn\u2019t as bad as it is\ntoday. In Europe, yes, we had cars and trucks and all of that, but I remember riding a\nmotorcycle with my uncle cause we didn\u2019t have a car and I remember getting a flat tire\nevery other block, cause we didn\u2019t have the good tires, you know, right after the war.\nAnd here is all the buses and the trucks and the streetcars and the -- and the confusion\nand the people in all directions. And it was like it was mind boggling that first day.\nAbsolutely mind boggling. When I came to Chicago, I -- I had stayed with my aunt and\nuncle in New York for a few weeks. And when I came to Chicago, it -- it became now --\nin New York, I lived in New Jersey, which is more of a small community. When I came\nto Chicago, I came into the city, okay? Now I\u2019m living in this big city. I came from a\nlittle town in Europe, I did not come from this big city. So it was very different and very\nstrange and I remember the clothes that I came -- that I brought from Europe was the\nwrong clothes. I came with all the wrong clothes, you know, so when I was in New\nJersey, my aunt took that clothes away from me and she got rid of it and bought me new\nclothes. When I came to Chicago, to my aunt here, my aunt decided -- my aunt in\nChicago decided that my aunt in New -- New Jersey bought me all the wrong clothes. So\nnow she emptied out this -- this suitcase and she took me shopping for different clothes.\nSo now I had to learn how to do this. My aunt was a young woman at the time also and\nshe had three children. Now, I spoke German when I came here. I spoke Hungarian, I\nspoke Yiddish, okay? I spoke Czech, but did not speak English. My aunt spoke a little bit\nof German. So, between her little bit of German that she had and my German, we were\nable to communicate. And of course, with my dad, Is -- could speak Yiddish or I could\nspeak, you know, in Hungarian. And it didn\u2019t matter, you know, cause my dad\u2019s -- when\nmy dad came to this country, he didn\u2019t have time to go to school and -- and he -- his\nEnglish was with a very heavy accent, as we all have, but his, you know, he never really\nlearned how to speak proper English, so to speak. My aunt decided that I was going to\nlearn how to speak with her children, with her three children. And every time I would say\nsomething that wasn\u2019t so, as I was learning, she would correct me. And to this day there\u2019s\na family joke where her little boy must have been two or two and a half years old at the\ntime and she -- his name was Jimmy and she called Jimmy and he -- his answer was,\n\u201cHere I are, Mommy, here I are.\u201d And now, my aunt did not correct her two year old or\ntwo and a half year old, but she looked at me and she, with her finger goes, \u201cFritzie, you\ndon\u2019t say here I are. You never say here I are.\u201d You know, so she made sure that I\nlearned how to speak. And send me to school and -- and I think it\u2019s due to her that I\nspeak a little better English than some of us that came over here. And -- but I was always\nunhappy, I always wanted to go to Israel. Always, all the time and now I am starting to\nspeak out loud and now I am telling my dad, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to stay here, it\u2019s very\nhard, I don\u2019t know the language. I don\u2019t know, I don't dress properly, I don\u2019t do anything,\nI\u2019m -- I -- I want to go to Israel.\u201d And he always said, \u201cNo, you\u2019ll learn, you\u2019ll learn.\u201d\nAnd I guess one day he decided he is going to call my bluff and he looked at me one day\nand he said, \u201cOkay. If that\u2019s what you really want, if that\u2019s what will make you happy, I\nwill send you to Israel. When do you want to leave?\u201d And at this point I go, \u201cWell,\nmaybe I really don\u2019t want to go to Israel. Maybe I really like it here,\u201d you know. And I\nhave to tell you that I love this country. Yes, I am a flag waver, with it\u2019s politics and with\nall that\u2019s going on, I feel it is my country and -- and I treat it as such. I love it.",
        "Q: Did you go to public schools?",
        "A: I went to a special school originally, it was called Adante School. And I remember\ntaking the streetcar from where we lived to -- and it was quite a way to go, it was about\n35 minutes by streetcar. And I remember coming there once and ha -- needing to get off,\nbecause the streetcar wasn\u2019t stopping and I\u2019m standing at the back door and I\u2019m\nhollering, \u201cUp, up, up,\u201d instead of saying that I need to get out. I didn\u2019t know how to\nspeak and everybody is standing there laughing at me because I am hollering, \u201cUp,\u201d\ninstead of that I need to get off this -- this streetcar. And eventually somebody caught on\nand said, \u201cI guess she needs to get off,\u201d you know and they pulled that bell or whatever it\nwas. And then -- so I would go to school and then my dad worked for Vienna sausage\ncompany where -- which was like maybe a block away and I remember after school every\nday, I would walk to Vienna sausage company and have a sandwich there and wait for\nmy dad to finish work and then I would -- he would drive me back home. So this -- this\nwas going on for quite awhile. And I hated to -- I -- I -- I learned to hate corned beef\nsandwiches, cause I had one every day. Today we find out it\u2019s cholesterol heaven, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Right. What -- what neighborhood were you in?",
        "A: We lived -- originally, when I came here, we lived in East Rogersburg. 1348 and a\nhalf Esther Street. I li -- we lived in a four room apartment with three little children, my\naunt, my uncle and Fritzie. And originally I slept on -- they had those chairs that\nconverted into beds at that time. That was my bed, because we were really cramped until\nwe moved into bigger -- a bigger apartment. But, it was very hard in the beginning. It was\n-- this is not an easy country to come to. You need to remember that during the time we\ncame here, right after the war, the Americans were not the travelers they have become\ntoday. The Americans, at that time, were not as tolerant of an accent as they are today.\nBecause today they travel and they\u2019ve become the foreigners in the foreign lands and\nthey -- they know what it means to learn a different language. They were not tolerant of\nus; we were called the greena in -- in Jewish. We were called the refugees. We were told\nnot to speak our -- about our past, we should forget about it. Nobody wants to listen to us,\nnobody wants to hear it. Some of us could not speak about our past, but some of us\nneeded to speak about our past and nobody would listen to us and nobody wanted to hear\nit. We were told to keep quiet. We were just -- people did not tolerate us and were not\nalways nice to us when we first came here and was very difficult. This is a very difficult\nlanguage to learn. One word can have different meanings and especially to spell, my\nGod, I mean, I\u2019Il never learn how to spell. I still don\u2019t know why there is a k in front of a\nknife, you know, but -- the word knife. But it was very difficult. Most of us found it very\ndifficult when we first came here.",
        "Q: You were saying that you were told to forget about what had happened to you, that --\nthat people didn\u2019t want to hear wh -- who was -- who was telling you this?",
        "A: The families. The } -- the other Jewish people, the people that -- that one needed to\ntalk to, our neighbors, everybody. Nobody wanted to listen, nobody wanted to hear about\nwhat happened in the past. Whether it was from guilt, that nobody did anything here or\nwhat it was from. I remember when I got married and -- and -- and my husband and I\nwent to the movies, the Chicago theater, downtown. And in those days they used to show\na newsreel before the movie started. I recall a newsreel coming on while we were sitting\nin the theater and it showed openings of camps and -- and the atrocities of some of it,\nduring that time. And I couldn\u2019t face up to it and I walked out. And my husband followed\nme and we came to -- we were in the lobby of the Chicago theater and as we\u2019re standing\nthere, people are saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand while -- why they are showing those\natrocities. We know that didn\u2019t happen. Those things could have never happened the way\nthey are showing them.\u201d And I\u2019m standing there, me, who has just come out of one of\nthose places and not answering, because of ignorance of people. So, they didn\u2019t want to\nknow. How many of us close our eyes and close our ears to things that are going on 1n the\nworld today? We don\u2019t want to know. And maybe we could help and maybe we can\u2019t,\nbut we don\u2019t.",
        "Q: You mentioned in your video interview that your way of dealing with the Holocaust\nand your experiences was that for many years, I think the phrase you used was you put\nthem on the shelf and you sort of kept them to yourself. Why -- is that what happened\nand why -- why did that happen? Was it because of these messages you felt like you were\ngetting, or --",
        "A: We were getting very mixed messages and we were also -- each one of us needs to\nhandle a death or an atrocity or a tragedy in our own ways. We -- we can\u2019t predict how\nwe\u2019re going to react and we should never judge the next person of their -- of how they are\nhandling it. I have learned this. My aunt and uncle that I lived with in Chicago -- I\u2019m just\ngoing to use this then, as an example, were -- were going on vacation. My uncle had just\nsold his business and they were going to take their first vacation and they were driving to\nCalifornia and they got into a terrible accident. It was a head on collision and my uncle\nwas killed instantly. And I remember getting this call that my uncle was killed and that\nthe rest of them were all hurt and -- in this automobile accident. Now, I loved my uncle\nas much as I loved my father or anyone in the family, cause I lived with him, he became\nmy father image. And I recall getting this call and going hysterical laughing. Laughing\nand crying, tears, but -- but -- like I was in -- in a hysterical -- now that was my way of\naccepting it at that time. The concentration camps were similar, but a different story. The\nshock of the camps, the things we saw, the things we lived through. And you might sit\nhere for two weeks listening to some of the things that we had gone through in one day\nand listen to two different people from the same place, experiencing the same thing, but\nseeing it and experiencing it in a different way and both reacting in a different way.\nWhen I got out of the camps and when I came here, I -- I couldn\u2019t live with those\nthoughts. I couldn\u2019t handle them. I just -- I would have been -- they would have put me in\nan institution if I had lived with it day in and day out. So, I guess my way was to pretend.\nI pretended. All of those people were in a camp, my family and all the other Jewish\nfamilies, they were all in Auschwitz. All those babies were killed in Auschwitz. The gas\nchambers were going day in and day out. I saw them in a movie, it never happened to me.\nI was not there. This was a nightmare. I needed to walk away from it. I couldn\u2019t think\nabout it, I couldn\u2019t live with myself. I couldn\u2019t watch my dad\u2019s sad eyes. So, I went into a\npretend world. I needed to be a young girl. If Iam going to be this young girl, I am going\nto be this normal young girl and live a normal life, right? So you put yourself in this\npretend world and you live your days this way and it works. For the most part, 1t works.\nThen come the nights. You don\u2019t have control over your mind at night when you\u2019re\nsleeping. You don\u2019t have control over your dreams and your nightmares. So, yes, you do\npretend in the daytime, but the reality sets in through your dreams and through your\nnightmares, every single night. Every single night, somebody had to wake me and tell me\nit was -- \u201cit\u2019s a dream, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay now, you\u2019re free.\u201d To this day, when I\nspeak about it, my husband still has to wake me and tell me, \u201cIt\u2019s okay -- you\u2019re okay.\u201d\nSo, for many years, I needed to live a different kind of a life and deny the fact that I was\nthere. And I did this for many years. When our son was old enough to go to school, they\ndidn\u2019t teach anything about the Holocaust. I don\u2019t know if they did when you went to\nschool, but there was very little in those days. It isn\u2019t like today. We didn\u2019t have a\nWashington Holocaust Museum to tell us. He learned about the Holocaust in Sunday\nschool and he\u2019d come home and ask questions. And I couldn\u2019t answer them. I pretended\nthat it didn\u2019t happen to me, but I didn\u2019t say this to him, I just said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk\nabout it, we\u2019re not going to talk about it.\u201d Yes, my me -- my family knew I was a\nsurvivor. My in-laws knew, my husband knew. I didn\u2019t pretend in front of them. I never\nhid it from anyone, I couldn\u2019t. I have this accent, I\u2019m Jewish. I came from Europe, how\ndo I hide it? But, in our home -- immediate home, we couldn\u2019t speak about it. It was not a\nsubject that was brought up. When our son went to high school, he would come home\nand ask questions and I would give very little information. I couldn\u2019t. When he got\nmarried and our first grandson was born, he needed to know more. For his own sake, he\nneeded to know more. And those were the days when they were beginning to find some\nof the Germans that had lied about what they did during the times of the war and lied\nabout taking parts in concentration camps and came to this country and they were finding\nsome of them. And those were the days when there was a janitor that lived in Hyde Park,\nI believe, I\u2019m not quite sure where, and they found out that he was a Nazi 1n one of the\nconcentration camps and they wanted to prosecute him and all his neighbors stood up and\nsaid, \u201cWell, how can you do this? He\u2019s such a good man, he\u2019s such a good neighbor, he\u2019s\nsuch a good janitor.\u201d The fact that he committed murder the times before -- God only\nknows of how many, didn\u2019t count, okay? But maybe if he had killed their sister or their\nbrother or their mother, he wouldn\u2019t have been this wonderful person. And I\u2019m saying to\nmyself, \u201cThey don\u2019t know. These people don\u2019t know. They weren\u2019t there. He didn\u2019t kill\ntheir family. He, like the rest, needs to pay for his crime.\u201d This is a country where we\nneed to account for our -- for ourselves, for what we\u2019ve done. Then my son came to me\nand said that he saw this article that was put in through the Holocaust foundation in\nSkokie, about asking for survivors to come forth and have their stories recorded. And\nyes, I saw it many times. But those were still the days when I did not speak out. So all\nthis was beginning to come to a head. My son needed to know. The janitor needed -- the\npeople needed to know what happened in concentration camps. And I started to think\nabout this and I said, \u201cMaybe some of us do need to speak out. Maybe it\u2019s going to hurt,\nbut maybe we can set the world straight.\u201d\u201d And when my son called and said, \u201cMom, you\nneed to do this because I need to know and your grandchildren will need to know.\u201d And\nthis is where a grandma and a mother gets caught. And his words were, \u201cDon\u2019t ask for\nanything. Sign whatever they want you to sign. Take a blank tape and ask for a copy of a\ntape.\u201d Which is what I did. And I went and I was interviewed. And I remember sitting in\nthis room for the very first time, coming to this home to be interviewed and I was\ninterviewed by Dr. Leon Stein, who is head of the history department, I believe, at\nRoosevelt University, who has since become a friend, but this is the first time I\u2019ve met\nhim. I remember he came there with cameras and as we started this interview, the camera\nbroke down. And I said, \u201cSee, I\u2019m not supposed to be doing this.\u201d Okay, so they asked\nme would I come back the next day -- and I had a friend go with me the first day and the\nnext day. And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, you know, I don\u2019t know that I can go through this.\u201d\nBut I did go back. And we still have a tape of that first interview, which was terrible,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t speak and it was a very bad interview. The -- the questions didn\u2019t\ncome the way they should. And I remember was a short interview and my friend that\ncame with me and I went back into my car and we sat down and when I got into the car,\nthe floodgates opened. And I went hysterical, crying on her shoulder. This 1s the first\ntime I have given this interview and I -- it just -- it just opened this gate. And then I said,\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask me anything. This is what I could have told them, that\u2019s what I could\nhave told them, this is what I should have said. But they didn\u2019t ask and I didn\u2019t think of\nsaying anything and I\u2019m never giving another interview, this is too painful. I cannot do\nthis and -- and I\u2019m never doing another interview.\u201d The next day I get a call from this\nprofessor and he says to me, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s going to be a panel discussion at the\nuniversity, would you come and go on this?\u201d And I go, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a public speaker, I\ndon\u2019t know how to do this. I am not going.\u201d He said, \u201cI live in your neighborhood. I will\npick you up, I will bring you home and let\u2019s do this.\u201d Well, this is how it started, where I\nbeca-gun to speak out. One thing led to another and I started to go into schools and I\nstarted to go into universities, started to go into synagogues and I started to work --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

One thing led to\nanother and I started to go into schools and I started to go into universities, started to go\ninto synagogues and I started to work with Mayor Daly, our mayor in Chicago. When\nMayor Daly came into office, he had a Day of Remembrance. He was the first mayor that\never had a Day of Remembrance. And I started to work with him in the schools and when\nhe had a Day of Remembrance, I was his first keynote speaker at the Daly Center and I\nspoke out at the Daly Center. And then I started to work -- Mayor Daly every year has a\nDay of Remembrance, but prior to everybody going, what most people don\u2019t know is that\nhe holds a breakfast and invites two students from every Chicago school -- the high\nschool and they have a breakfast first -- beautiful breakfast and then there\u2019s a speaker that\nspeaks to these students first and I have been his speaker for many years. This last year\nwas the first time that I did not speak, cause I said, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d And little by\nlittle, I have started to speak out and have realized the importance of a survivor to speak\nout. I have realized that only through survivors can the rest of the world learn, cause we\nwere the ones that had the experience. I realize that as we\u2019re getting older, there are not\ngoing to be many that can stand up and speak out and the revisionists are doing their\nwork now. I realize that there are hundreds of books that the revisionists are writing,\ncalling us survivors liars, that it never happened. They\u2019re on the internet today, with\nprograms, teaching children that the Holocaust did not happen. So, I have realized the\nimportance of all of this. When Washington was first in the talking stages, before there\nwas a hole in the ground, I was asked to appear on Milt Rosenberg\u2019s show and speak\nabout the Holocaust and speak about the importance of the Washington Holocaust\nMuseum. I was one of the very first to jump onto this bandwagon and have been\nspeaking out for the Washington Holocaust Museum and about it\u2019s importance, it\u2019s\nteachings, where it brings children in from all over the country, to teach about the\nHolocaust. And now that I have gotten older, my grandchildren need to know. Their\ngrandchildren will need to know, as will yours and as will sti -- as will the generation that\nwill be here after us. And this is one of the big reasons that I speak out today.",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious about when you first went to that first interview, the thing that sort of set\nyou off on this road that yo -- that you\u2019re on now, of ta -- of talking about it, was because\nof your son and him wanting to know what had happened to you. And you got a tape of\nthat first interview made, but you said it wasn\u2019t a very good interview. Have -- did you\ngo on to have discussions or talk to him directly about what happened, or did you -- did\nyou leave it to the tapes, you know, I mean, especially since that first one wasn\u2019t very\nsatisfactory.",
        "A: This is very interesting. When I was the keynote speaker the first time with Mayor\nDaly, my daughter-in-law came to listen as did some friends and family. My son did not.\nI think it\u2019s too painful for him. That was recorded, as was the first tape. I\u2019ve been on\ntelevision, I\u2019ve been in newspapers. And the tape from Washington, of course. My son\nhas never come to listen to me speak in person. But he has saved every little print,\neverything that has been written, every tape that\u2019s been made. And I expect a copy of this\nand he also wants it and he saves everything. Last year, our synagogue, where my\ngrandchildren go to Hebrew school and Sunday school had asked me to come and speak\nto the class. This is the first that my son came to listen. It was like -- they gave me maybe\na half hour and you speak to children and you speak different than you speak to adults,\nbecause you don\u2019t want to send them home crying that this lady scared them and Mommy\ncalling me the next day. So you speak different, but my son came with his video camera,\nto listen to me. My oldest grandson chose to sit in and listen to me. My youngest\ngrandchu-son -- chose not to. He chose to go to his class, which he had -- which we\nallowed him to do. I was very conscious through this entire speaking time, that my son\nwas standing there with the camera and listen to his mother relate this story. And we\u2019ve\ntalked about it. We\u2019ve talked about different aspects of it. He\u2019s read about it. He\u2019s read\nMichael Beerenbaum\u2019s book where I\u2019ve been quoted and they\u2019ve also sent it to my\ngrandson for his -- for his Bar Mitzvah. And of course my grandchildren -- my oldest one\nnow 1s in high school and he has written about the Holocaust and he has been to\nWashington. So we do speak about it, but very little, very little. We don\u2019t -- he\u2019s watched\nevery tape and he wants everything. And he puts everything away. \u201cMom, I need a\ncopy.\u201d You know? But, we speak about it very little.",
        "Q: So y -- so you and your son have never sat across a table or sat in the living room or\nwhatever, an-and --",
        "A: He will ask questions and I will answer them, but we\u2019ve never had this kind of a\ndiscussion, this serious kind of a discussion, you know. An-And it\u2019s interesting, because\nwhen I was a -- first time I was on television and I came back and I said to him, \u201cWell,\nwhat do you think?\u201d And he says, \u201cWhen did you start speaking with an accent?\u201d I mean,\nthis is what he -- you know, but we don\u2019t go into the deep end of it. Like, I\u2019m going back\nto Europe now and his question to me 1s, \u201cWhy do you want to put yourself through this?\nWhy do you need to put yourself through this?\u201d You know? And he hurts for me and he\u2019s\nafraid for me. So, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard.",
        "Q: Once you did start speaking about it more, did the nightmares decrease in number?\nDid it have any affect on that part of your life?",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s interesting, cause oftentimes I speak at group meetings and I -- for\nfundraising for the Washington Holocaust Museum and we get different groups of people\nin and they -- people analyze survivors and they\u2019 Il sit there and they\u2019Il stare at you and\nthey try and analyze you. And this particular evening, we had a group of doctors from\none of the hospitals and I know I\u2019m being analyzed. I mean, I just -- I can feel it. You\ndon\u2019t -- you know? So we were all done and we had this small discussion afterwards and\n-- and I don\u2019t know one of the doctors. And he was asking me different questions and\nwhatever, I don\u2019t know how we came to it and -- and I\u2019ve often said that probably I do\nneed to be analyzed, cause there are many things that I -- that I cannot remember, and --\nthings that -- during the times of the camps. And I looked at him and I said, \u201cSo, you\nanalyzed me,\u201d I said, \u201cso what do you think?\u201d He says, \u201cWell, I think that you live with a\nlot of guilts.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh? Well, what kind of guilts do I live with?\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWell, survivors guilts.\u201d He says, \u201cYou -- you feel guilty that you survived and a lot of\npeople didn\u2019t.\u201d And when I hear that I -- I -- I get angry. And I said, \u201cYou know,\u201d I said,\n\u201cyou are reading the wrong books.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any -- I may have lots of guilts\nthat I live with, but that is not one of them. I did not survive at anyone\u2019s expense. I did\nnot steal with anyone -- from anyone. I did not steal their food. I did not kill anyone. I\nwas one of the lucky ones. If there\u2019s one thing that I don\u2019t live with, is the fact that I\nsurvived and others didn\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201cSo you\u2019ve been reading the wrong books.\u201d And I\u2019ve\nheard this from many people, that survivors live with the guilts that they survived and\nothers didn\u2019t, and maybe some of us do. I don\u2019t. I -- that -- that\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t. I -- I -\n- that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s n -- I don\u2019t have, is the -- the guilt that I survived.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I question it. I question why my brothers didn\u2019t survive. I ques-question that other\npeople didn\u2019t survive. I live with the guilt of sending my mother into the wrong line. I do\nnot live with the guilt that I survived and others did not. So, you know.",
        "Q: What about the nightmares, did they go down or not?",
        "A: The nightmares, that was the question. Okay.",
        "Q: It was a good answer, but --",
        "A: That was the question. I got sidetracked. When I first started to speak, people told me\nthat once I speak out, that the nightmares would go away. The answer is no. The\nnightmares have always been there and I believe the nightmares will always be there. Not\njust for me, but for all of us that have gone this horrible route. My husband always knows\nwhen I have had to speak. When I did a fund-raiser when I was in a school, it just brings\nit all back and the pictures all there. The screen is showing it all and you know, it doesn\u2019t\nmake it easier. It doesn\u2019t make it easier. It open -- this 1s -- this is a wound that does not\nclose. Just because we speak about it, doesn\u2019t make it go away, it makes it deeper. But we\nspeak about it, because we realize the importance of speaking out. We know the wound 1s\nthere. We don\u2019t need to open it. Survivors don\u2019t need to open it. But what we\u2019re trying to\ndo, is prevent this from happening again. And I do believe the old saying, what goes\naround, comes around. Yesterday it was Jews. Today, they\u2019re fighting over other things,\nreligion, in other parts of the world. Tomorrow it might be blue eyed people, or a\ndifferent ethnic group. But it does -- the wheel turns, it does go around. And if we don\u2019t\nspeak out and if we don\u2019t teach and if we don\u2019t show a -- what a gun can do and if we\ndon\u2019t show what hatred can do, what bigotry can do, what racism can do -- then we need\nto live with -- with fear, with hate, all our lives. We need to teach our children. Our\nchildren are not born with hatred, we teach hatred. I don\u2019t like you because you\u2019re blue\neyed or because you\u2019re black or because you\u2019re Jewish or because you\u2019re Christian. I\nteach you, my child, to hate instead of si -- teaching them nice things, do I need to teach\nthem to hate? When I go into a school -- when I go into a school, I ask these children,\nhow many of you are guilty of tormenting someone because they\u2019re too fat or too skinny\nor too blonde or they don\u2019t meet some of your quali-qualifications? They don\u2019t speak the\nway you think they should speak? What makes you the judge? What makes you\ndifferent? Why do you think that you can sit in judgment of me? How many of you\nchildren have been guilty of this? Of tormenting another child? You\u2019d be surprised how\nmany sit there and shake their hands. They know. They know. But maybe I can touch a\nnerve.",
        "Q: How do you feel about -- I know that in -- you said you\u2019ve gone back to Europe, how\ndo you feel about Germany and Germans?",
        "A: When I go back to Germany, my skin crawls. When I look at the old Germans, I\nwonder where they were and what they did during that particular time. But that doesn\u2019t\nmean that I hate the young Germans or the young people. They are not the guilty ones,\nthey didn\u2019t do it. But I think that every one of them and the Polish people and all the\nother people in the world that didn\u2019t help -- we need to remember that there were 12\nmillion people killed during that time. A million and a half babies. Babies, okay?\nSomebody did it. Somebody\u2019s father did it, somebody\u2019s grandfather did it. And I want to\nquestion the young people, \u201cDo you know what your father or your grandfather did\nduring the time of the war?\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean that the young person of today is\nguilty of what their father or their grandfather did. But the country itself, or Poland itself,\njust because it is Germany and just because it is Poland and just because this is where all\nthe horrible atrocities were taking place, make my skin crawl.",
        "Q: When -- on trips back, you -- so you have been in Germany? [indecipherable] ever\nbeen for any length of time or just for a day or two, or --",
        "A: Have to tell you one story. Several years ago, very first time I went back to Germany\nand Austria, I went back on business. And I traveled with a young woman who was very\nblonde and very bu -- blue eyed and very Christian. She -- I am the Jew and she was the\nChristian person that I was working with at the time and we went back to Germany. And,\nwhen we flew into Germany -- we were taking a train -- we decided to take a train from\nMunich to wherever we were going. And we got on the train and we came into this\ncompartment and it was winter and pe -- we put down our luggage -- we were the only\ntwo people in the compartment, and we closed the door. And we -- it was cold and we\nwalked into this -- to this warm compartment and both of us started to doze. Next thing\nwe knew, the door opened and it was the conductor asking for passports, in German. And\nKay, who was my friend that I traveled with, took out her passport and handed her\npassport and I froze. I totally froze. I am this Jewish girl that is back on this train, seeing\nthis conductor coming at me, in German, asking for my passport. And he kept going,\n\u201cPassport, fraulein,\u201d and I kept staring at him. Finally, Kay, went with her elbow at me,\n\u201cFritzie, Show him your passport.\u201d And I got there -- that far, I have to have one, right?\nShe finally realized what happened and she reached into my purse and she took out my\npassport and if I tell you this conductor studied me and studied this passport for a good\nthree minutes, cause I don\u2019t think he understood what happened. He left. Kay handed me\nback the passport and I started to cry. And she looked at me and she said, \u201cWell, why?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But took me back to another time, in another place, on another\ntrain. And it just totally took me back.\u201d And I been back since, and I\u2019ve been back to\nPoland since, and I feel very uncomfortable. But I want to tell you that that pwa --\npassport is going to stay with me, because that was our lifeline during the time when we\nneeded it and couldn\u2019t get it, that would have been our lifeline. And I feel very\nuncomfortable being in those countries, cause I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m loved, as a Jew. But I'll\nnever forget that first time going back.",
        "Q: Is that when this incident on the train happened?",
        "A: The first time I went back. When the Washington Museum opened -- I don\u2019t know if\nyou \u2019ve been there, but they have a boxcar that took children to a concentration camp, that\nthe Polish people sent to Washington and one needs to walk through the boxcar to go\nthrough the museum. You can walk around it, but one really should walk into this boxcar\nand walk through it. And the very first time, after the museum opened, I couldn\u2019t walk\ninto it. I could not walk into this boxcar. And Maggie Daly, Mayor Daly\u2019s wife, walked\nwith me and held my hand and took me through this boxcar. And I often tell students that\ngo to Washington, that when they stand in that boxcar, if they stand very quietly, they\nwill hear voices. Voices of children that were taken to their death in that boxcar. I think\nthe turning of the wheels and the trains will always have a certain fear, a certain reminder\nto all of us.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s change sub-subjects a bit. I wanted to ask you how you met your husband. Let\u2019s\ntalk about something more pleasant for awhile.",
        "A: Okay. I have to tell you about my husband, first of all. How well do you know your\nWorld War Two history?",
        "Q: Oh, it\u2019s -- for somebody my age, it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: My husband 1s American born, was a Marine on Wake Island during the war. My\nhusband was taken prisoner on Wake Island and was a Japanese prisoner of war. So he\nhad his own horror stories to tell. My husband\u2019s a decorated soldier and -- and he\u2019s very\nproud of this, as he well should be. But he always -- he was always able to speak about\nhis experiences and he always told our son about the horrors and what -- and -- and we\nwent back to reunions with his group and there are just really a handful of them left, that\nfought on Wake Island and they\u2019re a very brave, wonderful group of people that\ndefended Wake Island. When I first came to this country, after I lived with my aunt for\nawhile, I shared an apartment with a friend of mine who had friends that were Hungarian\npeople. They came here prior to the war, Hungarian Jewish people. And she took me --\nthese friends of hers owned a small grocery store and she took me to visit them, her\nfriends, and -- in the grocery store. And, while I was in the grocery store, my husband,\nwho at that time -- whom I didn\u2019t know at the time, and his mother, walked in. They --\nthey were next door neighbors and they walked into the grocery store. And we started to\ntalk and my mother-in-law, who became my mother-in-law later on, looked at me and\nsaid, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be my daughter-in-law.\u201d It was like a premonition, but I -- I met\nhim in a grocery store. You know, so it\u2019s a funny story.",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: Norman.",
        "Q: Norman?",
        "A: Fritzshall.",
        "Q: Okay. And when -- what year was it you met him, do you remember?",
        "A: I met him in -- in \u201848.",
        "Q: So you had been here maybe two years, I guess, when you met?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Right. But he always had his own story. And I honestly think that\nthe fact that he was a prisoner and he had the hard life that he had, he knew how to cope\nwith me and my life and my nightmares. And I must say that he has supported me from\nday one. With the Washington Holocaust Museum, with my going with the fundraising,\nwith the Skokie Holocaust Museum, where I\u2019m also active and with the schools and he\nhelps me and supports me in everything I do, so it\u2019s been -- it\u2019s been -- made life easier.",
        "Q: When -- when you and he first got -- when you met and when you got married, was --\nwere you already in the period where you were no longer -- basically, you were no longer\nspeaking about what had happened to you?",
        "A: Right. I did not speak about it at all, during that time. Actually, we did -- we didn\u2019t\ndiscuss it until -- well, he and I did, you know, but not publicly, I didn\u2019t, or with anyone\nelse. I mean, I never denied it to him. But, as far as speaking out publicly, I didn\u2019t, until\nactually our first grandson was born.",
        "Q: But -- but you -- I\u2019m] -- I\u2019m just -- want to know, did you speak much about it -- talk\nabout what had happened to you with him much, or it was just, he knew you were a\nsurvivor, you\u2019ve had it -- you sort of had this understanding that that was true, but you\ndidn\u2019t talk about it much?",
        "A: Exactly. We did not -- we did not go into a deep discussions. He did know I was a\nsurvivor. He did know I was in Auschwitz camp. If he would ask me a question, I would\nanswer it, but we did not go in -- into any deep discussions about it.",
        "Q: And what about his own wartime experiences? Was it -- was it the same way with\nhim? Did he not speak much about what happened to him?",
        "A: His wartime experiences, he always spoke about.",
        "Q: He did.",
        "A: And his wartime experiences should be recorded and one day they should -- there --\nthere\u2019s a book written, but they should record these experiences, cause they really just --\nthere are just a handful of survivors and they had their own horror stories. They were the\nones that worked in the coal mines and they are the ones that built the River Kwai and --\nand -- that you saw in the -- and had their own bloodshed and had their own hardships.\nSo, their stories are hard stories and they\u2019re history and they should be recorded.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you have a son, 1s that your only child?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And his name 1s?",
        "A: Steven.",
        "Q: And then hi -- your grandchildren? Their names, ages --",
        "A: We have two.",
        "Q: -- all that.",
        "A: We have two grandchildren. Our older one is Scott. And Scott is 15, he\u2019s second year\nhigh school and our younger one is Andrew and Andrew is 11 and he\u2019s in sixth grade.\nSo, it\u2019s kind of neat. They\u2019re neat kids and I love them much. And they\u2019re -- they\u2019re just\nwonderful. These are -- these are the dividends and the pleasures and I often look at them\nand I often wonder -- I look at them often, and I say -- especially when they were\nyounger, the innocence of children and here Hitler went and killed all of this innocence\nand -- and -- and killed all of these children that had so much to live for and so much to\ngive and so much to teach. And -- and God only knows what they would have been and\nhe took these lives, these -- these innocent lives. And I often look at my grandson of 15\nand I say, \u201cGod -- I hope to God the test never comes, but -- could he, would he have\nsurvived?\u201d America teaches different than Europe did, we had a different kind of life,\nalthough I too, came from a pampered home, so you can\u2019t judge it that way. But the\nstrength -- one doesn\u2019t know until one is tested. I really believe that one needs to be\ntested to find one\u2019s strength, cause we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re capable of.",
        "Q: Have you been to Israel?",
        "A: No. One day. My dream. One day. We were going to go last year, but my husband\nwasn\u2019t well enough to travel. But we will.",
        "Q: That time that your father said to you, \u201cOkay, when do you want to go to Israel?\u201d And\nthen you said, \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019Il stick around here for awhile.\u201d Was that -- did that end\nyour feeling?",
        "A: What it -- what 1t ended was -- no, what I discovered at that time was that I really did\nwant to stay here, that I love this country. This is my country and I love it. But Israel is\nhome to the Jews, as you well know and someday I really do want to go there and -- and -\n- and feel the freedom of Israel, feel the freedom of what it\u2019s like to walk down the street\nwhere -- where your people are and you don\u2019t have to watch your back because of your\nreligion. And I need to do this and I will do this. But there\u2019s a different feeling for Israel\nthan there is for this country. This is my country, with it\u2019s faults. Israel 1s my home as a\nJew. Does that make sense?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: As a Jew, I -- I feel Israel is my home, but this is my country, where I live, that I love.\nAnd yes I am a flag waver, but -- but Israel 1s, to all Jews I think, home. I -- I honestly\nbelieve and -- if we had an Israel during that time -- during the time of the Holocaust, this\nwould not have happened. Millions of people would have been saved, if we had an Israel.\nBut we didn\u2019t. We had to fight for it and we have to fight to keep it.",
        "Q: Was your family in Europe very political in any way?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember them as being political. I don\u2019t remember any politics being\ndiscussed. I remember the whispers when Hitler was going to occupy us. I remember the\nfear of Hitler, because we\u2019d begun to know that a lot of Jews were being taken away\nfrom their homes. We didn\u2019t know where they were being taken to, but we knew they\nwere -- a lot of homes were already being taken from them and they were put into\nghettos. We know about the -- the Jews that were sent ba -- 0 -- back over to Poland.\nWhen Hitler came into power, the Jews that came -- that immigrated to Germany from\nPoland, to make a better life for themselves. They fought for Germany, they became\nGermans. They -- they considered themselves German first, Jews second. Everything was\ntaken away from them and sent over the border, and we knew this. But, politically, as far\nas fear, yes. But I don\u2019t remember as a child, any politics being discussed in our home.",
        "Q: I was wondering if maybe, you know, yo -- cause you -- you came out of the war with\nsuch a strong feeling about going to Israel and about Israel, I was wondering perhaps if,\nyou know, there was any --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- you know, the Zionist trend.",
        "A: Well -- well, you need to remember one thing that we didn\u2019t discuss, so you can\u2019t\nremember it. I came -- I was raised as an Orthodox child, I came from an Orthodox home.\nI remember my grandfather saying his prayers twice a day. I remember -- there\u2019s a Jewish\nword, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know what they call tefillimin and it\u2019s a parchment that the\nJews use for --",
        "Q: Tefillin?",

The synagogue I went to, the women had to sit upstairs, separated from their\nmen, so I was raised in a strict, Orthodox home. And it was always someday Israel, you\nknow? It wasn\u2019t called Israel at the time, but -- but it -- this was always that someday --\nthis 1s how the prayer ends, that -- or maybe it begins, I real-really don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s --\nwas always with someday, next year in Israel or next year in Palestine. So, we knew. I\nwas raised with this, okay? And especially after the war, especially after the war, when\nthe Jews were being persecuted. Where was I going to go to have this freedom if not\nIsrael, if not Palestine? So it was always there. Plus, I -- I was this young person and I\nknew that it was hard to get into Israel, we\u2019d have to fight our way in and I -- I wanted to\nfight for it. This was going to be my home and this -- I wanted this freedom. I wanted to\nfight for their freedom. I would go fight for it today if I weren\u2019t too old. But -- so Israel\nwas always part of my Jewish upbringing and part of my religion. You know, and my\nstrong feelings are still there for Israel. I mean, I may be an American, but I am a Jew. An\nAmerican Jew.",
        "Q: Did -- after you got married, did you -- did you work? Have you -- you know, have\nyou had a -- a career? Did you stay home and raise a child? How did -- what\u2019d you do?",
        "A: I worked prior to being married. I worked after I was married. I worked til I was in my\nseventh month for my son. Then I stayed home til he was almost nine years old. I was a\nhome Mommy and then I went back to work and I work to this day. I need to work for\nmy brain, for myself, for -- and I also consider my volunteer work that I do as part of my\nwork. I work in a soup kitchen in Evanston. On Tuesdays I serve lunch at a church, it\u2019s a\nblack church. And I go and do that on Tuesdays. I help with the fundraising and -- for the\nHolocaust Museum in Washington. I am on the board in the Skokie Holocaust Museum. I\ngo into the schools and this 1s part of my giving back. This is my way of saying, \u201cThank\nyou, God,\u201d and I am giving back.",
        "Q: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m wondering, if it\u2019s possible to say, how mu -- I mean just as you, you know,\ngo through your life now -- you know, this is -- what happened to you, happened 50 years\nago -- if there\u2019s any way to -- to know it or figure it out, just as you go through your\nnormal routine of the day, with nothing special happening. No special reminders, you\nknow, in the air or the newspaper or in a conversation or whatever, about the Holocaust\nor any of that. When none of that is just in the atmosphere, I\u2019m wondering how often you\nmight think of it? Whether on just a regular day, any thoughts of that pass through your\nmind, or are there long stretches where you don\u2019t think of it any more?",
        "A: Every single day and I believe for as long as I will live, it will be every single day, I\nmiss not having a family -- extended family. I miss when the holidays come, not having\nmy extended family with me. I miss not having a brother. I am an only child. If you\u2019re an\nonly child when you\u2019re born an only child, I think it\u2019s different than when you had\nsiblings and they\u2019re not there. They tell us that one misses their mother more as they get\nolder and I\u2019m here to tell you it\u2019s so. I miss not having a mother. I am very sorry that\nshe\u2019s not here to see her grandchild or her great-grandchildren. I think she would have\nbeen very proud of all of them, cause they\u2019re wonderful human beings. I think my father\nmissed his family terribly. I sometimes look at a family, a whole family, with generations\nand I envy them. I on -- don\u2019t envy their wealth, I don\u2019t envy anything that other people\nhave, but I envy their extended family. I miss going to a doctor and not having history to\ntell. I miss for my grandchildren, not knowing a grandparent. I miss a life I had and I\noften dream that I really have it. These are things that we will never have. These are\nthings that have been taken away from us, that other people have and have had. And why\nwas it taken away from us? Simply because we were born a Jew. Not because we\ncommitted a crime. We don\u2019t look any different from other people. We don\u2019t feel any\ndifferent from other people. Yes, I go to a synagogue and you go to a church, but am I so\ndifferent from you? I miss the same things that you have and that you have had and I\ndon\u2019t have. And I miss them every day and I think about them every day.",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m sort of out of questions. Is there anything that you\u2019d like to add, that we\nhaven\u2019t talked about?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t think now. Probably when you walk away, I will. But I don\u2019t\nknow. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: You know, I\u2019ve done several of these interviews with people and there\u2019s -- I always\ncome away from them, you know, that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s impossible to talk to anybody who --\nwho lived through any part of this, you know, and I\u2019ve ju -- some of the people I\u2019ve\ntalked to were never in concentration camps, managed to escape getting put in them or\nwhatever. But it\u2019s impossible to have any of these conversations without feeling how\nmuch -- you know, what a depth of emotion 1s inside, you know, is constantly with the\npeople who -- who live through this. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I always walk away, sort of --\nyou know, whatever the specifics are, that\u2019s the -- that\u2019s the thing that sort of sticks with\nme the longest.",
        "A: I think -- there are also several reasons for this. When one loses a parent -- it is normal\nfor a child to lose a parent, one has a cemetery. I know I have comfort, because my father\nis buried in a cemetery here and I can go and I can visit. Those of us that watched our\nfamilies killed in Europe, we don\u2019t know -- we don\u2019t have -- we can\u2019t visit. They\u2019re\nscattered. When you watch babies walking towards a gas chamber, when you watch\nreligious people walking towards a gas chamber as they are praying still to God when\nthey\u2019re walking towards the gas chamber, when you watch someone dig a grave and then\nyou see them shot and fall into the grave they have dug for themselves, when you watch\ninnocent blood spilled, there\u2019s a hole that there\u2019s no cover on. The cover will not fit, the\nhole doesn\u2019t close. You live with it. It\u2019s like an ulcer that eats away at you. Some of us\nhandle it better. Some of us live with it easier, but the wound 1s always there. Maybe if\nwe had seen a normal death, which, we expect a normal death, we would get over it. But\nthis was -- there was nothing normal about his war. There was nothing normal about the\nHolocaust. We cannot forget. We cannot forgive for those people that have done it and\nwe must never forget of what has been done to the Jews, to the Gypsies, to the innocent\npeople that got caught during the time of the war. But we must re -- also remember, that\nmaybe a lot of people would have been put in danger, had they helped. They could have\nhelped. We must honor the people that helped. We must honor the righteous. They were\nthe ones that stood up and said, \u201cThis is wrong, we will help.\u201d We must always\nremember those people that did stand up and did help. Unfortunately, there are not many\nof them. Israel has honored them, Israel has planted trees for them. The forests are not\novergrowing with trees. We have an Avenue of the Righteous in Evanston. It\u2019s not\novergrowing with trees, but there were the few, there were the Schindlers, but not\nenough. And so I honor those people and I teach about those people. But we can never\nforgive and we can never forget, for the ones that did not help, that ni -- that did not stand\nup, that turned in the Jews, when they didn\u2019t need to. They didn\u2019t benefit by it, other than\ntaking our possessions. Is it worth to give a life for possessions? I hope that the ones that\nare still living, that committed the crimes, I hope that they think about what they did. I\nhope they live with it every single day, in their minds. I hope they can see the bloodshed\nthat was done and not forget. And I hope we can all learn from the past. Thank you.",
        "Q: Actually, I had one more question, if you don\u2019t mind me asking. That was a great\nplace to end, but there was something. You triggered something in my mind, which was,\nin your video interview, you mentioned every day having to run, in front of Dr. Mengele\nor Dr. Mengele\u2019s lieutenants. And -- you know, off and on, through the years, there were\nstories, possible sightings of him, you know, people searching for Mengele. It was maybe\n-- what was it, maybe 10 years ago or 15 years ago, where supposedly they found these\nbones in -- where was it, Paraguay, I think, and --",
        "A: Paraguay.",
        "Q: Yeah, and some of that was happening, I believe, during the period where you were\nbeing silent about your experiences in the Holocaust and when that -- when -- when you\nwould -- did you ever encounter these stories in the news or whatever and I\u2019m ju -- I just\nwas curious --",
        "A: About Dr. Mengele?",
        "Q: Yeah, about him.",
        "A: About the death of Dr. Mengele or what --",
        "Q: Or before that, you know, it was like, where is he? There were -- you know, every\nonce in awhile there\u2019d be a story that oh, he was seen in Brazil or he was possibly in this\nplace, there were people hunting for him. I mean, I was just curious whether --",
        "A: People hunting for him and people hiding him.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And there are many others that are being hidden in Paraguay and other places. And\nit\u2019s amazing, because they are le -- still living in freedom. I mean, some of them might be\nolder now, but I -- I do believe that they need to pay for their crimes. Dr. Mengele, I\nbelieve -- I\u2019m not sure that there has been proof that those were -- that he died and all of\nthat. I would have loved to have seen him taken alive. It would have been a great day if\nthey had taken him alive and if he could have paid a little bit for some of the crimes that\nhe committed, some of the experiments that he did, some of the atrocities that -- that have\ncome out that he has done. But, unfortunately he died without -- without -- okay, so he\ndow -- died in drowning, but big deal, you know? He should have felt some of -- of the\npain that he caused for so many, many hundreds of pe -- of people, you know? But yeah,\nhe -- he -- Dr. Mengele was one of the doctors that did the selection and -- in Auschwitz.\nAnd he did the experiments on pregnant women and -- and he did a lot of the\nexperiments without drugs and -- and so forth. He was one of the doctors and -- with his\nentourage that would -- would have selections in the morning. We would have to get\nundressed and not walk, but run in front of him. But we knew there was going to be a\nselection and oftentimes when our hair started to grow back and -- and then somebody\u2019s\nhair would be gray, we would take dirt and rub it into that person\u2019s head and hair -- to try\nand cover the gray hair so they looked younger. We would try and pinch cheeks to show\nthat they -- we still had a little color in our face, that we didn\u2019t look so pale and dead,\neven though we were hungry and hardly had any strength. But let me tell you, strength\ncame from somewheres when there were selections, because not -- we did not walk, we\nran in front of them -- Dr. Mengele, as he stood there with his entourage, with his stick\nand -- and pointing one way or another. And some went into one line and some into\nanother. One never knew which was the good line. One -- one line went directly to the\ngas chambers, while the other line walked back into the barracks. But he was one of the --\none of the big players in -- in Auschwitz and -- and I\u2019m really sorry that he didn\u2019t stand\ntrial and didn\u2019t pay for his crime.",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious about -- about you, though and whether these stories or mentions of him\nin the news or whatever, would --",
        "A: Well, every time -- actually, every time we did hear about him and -- and it brought\nback memories. Just the name itself, you know, Dr. Mengele, my God, you know, you\ncan visualize this man standing there with his gloves and his -- and his stick in his hand. I\nmean, I can just see him in front of me. And the prayer was always there, please catch\nhim, please get him. And I know they\u2019ve gotten close to getting him [indecipherable] but\nyou know -- and then, it hurt when -- when I heard and read afterwards -- read afterwards\nthat his son visited him. He had a son who -- who knew where he was and his son visited\nhim and -- and all of that. And I kept saying, \u201cSure, he,\u201d you know, \u201che\u2019s -- he\u2019s still\nliving a good life and look what he did to all the other people.\u201d But there are many of\nthem that are still living, you know, and denying, and -- [knocking] It\u2019s open.",
        "Q: Well, we were sort of at the end of our interview anyway, so now that the plumber is\nhere to -- which sink is it that he\u2019s looking at?",
        "A: Bathroom.",
        "Q: Oh, okay. So he\u2019s here to fix the sink in the bathroom. Life goes on, so --",

And you got a tape of\nthat first interview made, but you said it wasn\u2019t a very good interview.

After we were liberated, we were put into a holding camp, which was a\nFritzie Fritshall does contain a 5 second black out at the beginning of the interview.

And, of course they had to delouse us. They had to give us medical attention\nand they feed us and try and sort of organize. I mean, we were a -- a -- a very displaced\ngroup, a very sick group at that point. And once they took our names and asked us if we\nhad a home to go to, or whatever -- some of us chose to go back to our original homes\nand some of us stayed behind and stayed in the DP camps for a long time. I was in a DP\ncamp for quite awhile and then I chose to go back home to my hometown, hoping that\npossibly my brothers or someone that had survived, had come back home and that we\ncould reunite. But I truly was mistaken, because no one came back. One aunt, who\nsurvived Auschwitz concentration camp, went to Budapest rather than coming to our\nhometown in Czechoslovakia, thinking that I hadn\u2019t survived, although sh -- she did see\nme in Auschwitz camp, so she knew I was there. But she thought that I, too had gone to\nthe gas chambers, as millions of others had. And when she heard that I had survived, she\ntoo came back home. So actually it was just the two of us. We came back home and\nfound our home -- my mother\u2019s home that we lived in, destroyed. Our home was used for\na lookout post. It was like on a little hill and the soldiers had used that and it was\ndestroyed. My grandmother\u2019s home -- which was my aunt\u2019s home who came back, stood.\nThe home was totally stripped of everything inside. There were nothing but walls and\nwindows left. And w-we moved into this home. Actually, I was the very first one to come\nhome in our community and I was the first one to move into my grandmother\u2019s home.\nAnd I would go and meet a train that passed through our little town once a day, hoping\nthat someone survived and people would come back. And little by little, some young\npeople did trickle back. And -- including my aunt and we all lived in my grandmother\u2019s\nhome. When we came back we had no money, we had no food and we just had the\nclothes on our backs. Our neighbors had stripped our homes, our furniture was used by\nneighbors. We recognized some of our clothes that was worn by some of our neighbors.\nBut no one came, no one offered and no one asked. What we had to do was go and dig\nfor potatoes in the field. Gather some potatoes and whatever we could from the harvest.\nAnd this is what we lived on for quite awhile. And I knew my father was in the United\nStates, but I did not know where. And I could have never found him, except that he found\nme. My dad had -- after the war, my dad had contacted some of the neighbors that he\nremembered and he wrote to the Post Office in our town, looking for his family, looking\nfor survivors. And I had gotten a letter through the Post Office, from my dad and gotten\nhis address and was able to get in touch with him. And he was able to send me American\ndollars through the letters that came. A five dollar bill, a 10 dollar bill -- which we were\nselling on the Black Market. At that time an American money, we were getting a lot for\nit, because the money in Europe was really devalued at that particular time, so we were\nable to buy food after awhile. We were also getting clothes through -- I believe it\u2019s the\nUnited Restitutio -- I don -- I don\u2019t know, it was called Unrah. I don\u2019t know what it\nstands for, actually.",
        "A: And we were getting clothes from them and I remember getting packages and opening\nthe packages and getting clothes that was actually used already and getting shoes that\ndidn\u2019t fit and looking for the candy that was inside and we were getting gum. And we\nwould open the package of gum and didn\u2019t know that we were supposed to chew this\ngum and chew it, you know, we just ate it like candy, thinking, \u201cGee, this 1s kind of\nfunny candy,\u201d you know?",
        "A: I had never seen gum before. And we stayed in my grandmother\u2019s home until some of\nthe organiza -- some of the young people were able to get it -- in touch with some of the\norganizations and some of them were getting help in other ways. And I was able to get in\ntouch with my dad. And then the borders closed. And I had gotten caught on the side of\nCommunism. Both my aunt and I had gotten caught on the side of Communism and we\nwere not able to leave. And I was not able to come to this country at that point, or get in\ntouch with my dad any longer.",

And eventually, she was also able to make her\nway to this country. My aunt had my dad, who was a brother and she had two other\nbrothers living in this country and through them she was able to make her way to this\ncountry.",
        "A: No, the -- my aunt that I speak of in the video was my mother\u2019s sister. The aunt that\nI\u2019m speaking of now was my father\u2019s sister.",
        "A: The aunt that I spoke of in the video had not survived the camps. We were separated\nin the camp and she was taken to another camp and I had found out years later, through\nsomeone that knew her and was 1n a camp with her, that she lived to see liberation. The\nday she -- the day her camp was liberated, she was still alive and died that day, the day\nthe camp was liberated. But, I think of her often, because she was my inspiration all\nthrough the camp. She was the one that kept telling me every single day, \u201cWe will make\nit and tomorrow will be better.\u201d I made it, she did not. But I couldn\u2019t have done it without\nher.",
        "A: Her name was Bella Davidovitch.",
        "A: She -- we were separated. We were in Auschwitz together and then we were\nseparated. I was taken to -- actually, what happened was that our -- our barracks was\nemptied and we were put into a holding barrack and our barrack was to go into the gas\nchambers and we knew it. My -- they had a separation, my aunt was chosen to go onto a\ntruck to be taken somewhere\u2019s else and the last she saw of me was walking towards the\ngas chambers. And when she left me, she did not think that I had survived, she thought\nthat we had all gone to the gas chambers, her entire family and she really did not fight for\nher life at that point. So, possibly, if she had known some of us had survived, she maybe\ntoo, could have survived.",
        "A: They -- people that were in Auschwitz, after they were in the camp for, I believe,\nprobably an hour, they knew about the gas chambers. You know, one separation had\ntaken place and once we were taken into the barracks and once we started to ask about\nour families, what had happened to our families, the people that had been in the barracks\nprior to us coming there, the prisoners, would point to the gas chambers. This is how we\nfound out what had happened to millions of others, to the children that we were separated\nfrom, to our parents, to the rest of our family, by just -- they would just raise their hand\nand they would tell us to look at the smoke. And of course, this is how we found out\nabout the gas chambers. We lived with it day in and day out we lived with the gas\nchambers. We watched the trains coming in, we watched the separations, we watched\npeople marching to the gas chambers, but there was no way we could help them or do\nanything. So, we learned -- we learned every single day, twice a day, there was a thing\ncalled a pell, where we all had to line up to be counted. When they called a pell in the\nmorning and at night, nobody wanted to be in the beginning of the line, or at the end of\nthe line, cause there was always punishment. People were always pulled from the\nbeginning of the line or the end of the line. Sometimes from the center, but basically, it\nwas easier to pull from the beginning or the end. So everybody fought to be in the center\nof the lines and there were only so many middles, somebody had to be in the beginning.\nBecause my aunt was on this particular truck, leaving, I had -- was hoping I could go\nwith her and so I was at the very end of the line and she watched all of us marching into\nthe gas chambers. And in the very last moment, six of us were pulled out and put onto\nanother truck to do s -- go to a factory to do slave labor. But her truck had pulled away\nalready and she did not see me not walking into the gas chamber, so she assumed that I\ntoo had gone into the gas chambers with the rest.",
        "A: I have no way of knowing, but I believe she did not know, because the people that\nwere with her, that told us that they knew her and she had died, remember her speaking\nabout everyone being killed one way or another or going to the gas chamber. So I -- I am\nassuming she did not know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the dates.",
        "A: She was ill. She had gotten an infection in an -- in a leg -- 1s -- from what we had\nheard, and blood poisoning had set in her leg and at that point she really didn\u2019t care. She -\n- you know, when -- when we were in the camps, there -- there came a point, during a\nlow moment maybe or when hope was lost, where people didn\u2019t care whether they lived\nor died, especially if they knew no one else survived, they just didn\u2019t care. And at that\npoint, I believe that she didn\u2019t care. I don't know how else to express this, except that I --\nI believe that she felt she was the last one of the family and -- and she too gave up.",
        "A: Maybe. I don\u2019t know. Could be the refrigerator. I don\u2019t know how to shut it.",
        "A: Well, it must be the air conditioner.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s hot in here and we need the air conditioner, guys.",
        "A: Do you know, things were happening in the camp where one didn\u2019t have the normal\nfeelings. We were, for the lack of a better word, dehumanized, maybe? We learned to\naccept life as it was on that particular moment and when you are with people in a barrack\nfor a le -- any length of time and you see them marching into a gas chamber, you don\u2019t\nthink, \u201cWell gee, I am the lucky one, I walked away.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m not the lucky one,\nmaybe they are the lucky ones, because I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to be taking\nme and it might be worse than where I am now. So, the reaction was a -- was not, \u201cGee,\nI\u2019m really glad because I\u2019m still alive.\u201d It just -- you accept it as 1t comes, that particular\nmoment. The fear is always there, that you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re being taken, that\nyou\u2019re going to get less food than you had that particular moment. That you might be --\nfeel hunger more than you do that particular moment, because you\u2019re already hungry,\nyou\u2019re already abused, you\u2019re already skinny, you\u2019re already sick. And the moment\ncomes when you just say, \u201cOkay, this is another thing that\u2019s happening to me today.\u201d\nAnd so you just flow with it.",
        "A: I did not know where she was being taken to. As far as I was concerned, she could\nhave been taken to another camp and put to death in a -- in a gas chamber in another\ncamp. I didn\u2019t know what she did or -- or even if she was alive, until after the war.\nActually, we found out -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a big world, but it\u2019s a small world. You\nknow, you talk to people and one will say, \u201cWell, I was in this camp,\u201d or \u201cI was in that\ncamp.\u201d And when you give a family name or when you start asking, people remember\nand people know and you get a little information.",
        "A: And this is how I found out.",
        "A: No. We were -- what -- what they did is, I don\u2019t know if you saw any other videos, but\n-- but -- or if you\u2019ve read anything about the Holocaust, but towards the end of the war,\nwhen Hitler started to lose the war, he started -- I use the word he because of Hitler, but\nbasically it\u2019s -- he didn\u2019t do it alone, obviously, he had his machinery that worked for\nhim, all the people that ran the camps and gathered the Jews and drove the Jews to the\ndeath camps and drove the trains and so forth. I -- I will refer to them as his mach-\nmachinery, because this is what it was. They -- the Germans started to empty the factories\nwhere slave labor -- labor was being done. They started to bring the people in from all\nover, wherever they did slave labor and they brought them together with the people in\nconcentration camps and they created a group at that point, a huge, huge group. Men and\nwomen together at that point. And it is known today as a Death March. It was -- they\nbrought us all together, we were in rags. I recall that I had -- my -- my shoes didn\u2019t fit,\nmy clogs. I could hardly walk in them because I had outgrown them, obviously. And it\nwas very cold and I -- I recall taking rags and wrapping rags around my feet as I was\nwalking. And they really walked us in circles, at least 1t seemed to us as 1f we were\nwalking in circles. They walked us through the towns, they walked us through fields.\nThey -- we slept in -- around haystacks. I mean they -- then -- and whatever. Most of us\nwere very sick, some people had gotten dysentery and they had to stop, of course and\nthey were being shot on the spot. They would walk us into -- through forest areas and I\nrecall at one point sleeping on the fields and just watching the planes -- the planes, I\nmean, American planes coming down low, passing us and we were hoping that they\nwould bomb us. We were sick, we were tired, we were hungry, we were thirsty and we\ndidn\u2019t care. At one point they started to walk us through a forest. We were on the road\nactually, but -- but the road was through the forests. And a friend and I realized that some\nof the people were trying to escape at that point. And it was also towards the very end of\nthe war and the Germans were also tired, taking us through the fields, you know, and all\nof this. And when -- we were watching people escape and they were shooting at these\npeople and -- and they were -- they were being horrible to us, even at that point. I recall,\nas we were walking through towns -- they would walk us through towns -- the people in\ntown knew and saw and heard, we were like -- like a herd of cattles taking over this town\nand walking through the town. I recall shades being pulled down, windows being closed,\ndoors being locked so that they wouldn\u2019t -- they pretended they didn\u2019t see and they didn\u2019t\nhear. But yes, occasionally, a window would open and a piece of bread would come out,\na potato would come out. Something would fly out a window. We all pounced on this\nbecause we were terribly hungry, they weren\u2019t feeding us. And we would pounce on this\nfood and th-the SS men -- the soldiers would shoot at us in groups. We didn\u2019t care, we\nwanted that piece of bread, we wanted that food. When we came to this forest, my aunt\nand | -- my -- my girlfriend and I took our hands and looked at each other and said we\u2019re\ngoing to try to escape. If they shoot us, they shoot us, but we cannot take this any longer,\nwe will try to escape. And we picked a time where they -- other people also tried to\nescape on both sides and the soldiers were busy shooting at other people and we escaped\nand they did try to shoot at us at that point, then we came into a forest. If I tell you that\nevery time I think of this escape, I can count my heartbeat even today. I mean, our hearts\nwere -- we -- we took each other\u2019s hands after we hid behind -- behind some bushes and\ntrees, and we took each other\u2019s hands and we were feeling each other\u2019s hearts as our\nhearts were beating. It was like it was going to come out, pop out. And we stayed in that\nforest all night long. We stayed hidden and we watched people walking by -- the\nprisoners walking by. The next day, we stayed in the forest and when it started to get\ndark, we decided that we\u2019re going to try and see if we can find a home, a farm, steal food\nsomewhere, steal clothes somewheres. You need to remember, our heads were shaved,\nwe were very skinny, we were in striped uniforms. I mean, you could -- you could spot\nus a mile away, we couldn\u2019t lie about who or what we were, okay? We came to this farm,\nand we were two dumb kids. We were totally dumb children. We knocked on the door\nand I recall a man opening the door and staring at us and all we said is that we\u2019re very\nhungry. And we spoke German, we lived in Germany. And he looked at us and he said,\nwell, he couldn\u2019t give us food, but he will take us into the barn. Well, he took us into the\nbarn and he let us stay in the barn and he did bring us food, he brought us pieces of bread\nand he brought us some hot soup. And he let us stay in the barn and we were supposedly\nhidden in this barn. The next morning he came to us and he said he has to go into town\nand he has to get food stamps for us. Now here are two -- two Jewish kids that are hiding\nin a German barn, dumb, believing this man is going to go and get food stamps for us,\nbecause he has to had food stamps or whatever story he told us, in order to feed us, and\nwe believed. We\u2019re two stupid kids and we believed. And we stood there and we looked\nat each other and he left. And all of a sudden it dawned on us, this man is going to turn us\nin. I mean, what is he going to do, go and tell people he\u2019s getting food ti -- food stamps\nfor two Jewish kids? So we stayed there and we watched him leave. And his wife stayed\nin the house. And we left the barn and we went into the forest area again and we hid in\nthe forest. And we were trying to pick, we picked snails. Today, it\u2019s called escargot and\nit\u2019s a delicacy. Do you know what snails look like when they come out of dirt and dirty\nsnails? We absolutely had no water to wash them with. We dug for whatever food we\ncould in the forest and we stayed in the forest and eventually we saw the Russian army\ncome in and take over, and we went out. And the Russians took us and they put us on --\non a truck and they took us to an area where they already had -- had freed some prisoners,\nand --",
        "A: -- we joined this -- this group.",
        "A: We could see them through -- as they -- we saw their trucks. We saw their trucks\ncoming and we saw their insignia and we knew it was -- we didn\u2019t care who it was as\nlong as it wasn\u2019t the Germans. I mean, it could have been Pakistani for all we knew. I\nmean, it happened to have been the Russians, but at that point we didn\u2019t know it was the\nRussian lead -- we just knew an army came and we were going to be freed. But it was the\nRussian army that came.",
        "A: I just recall walking out. My -- my friend and I, the two of us just walked out of the\nforest and they saw us and they knew -- they knew who we were. They gave us food. I\nremember one man, in fact, one of the soldiers, a Russian soldier, pulled up his sleeve\nand he had watches. He had an arm full of watches on his -- and he looked at me, he said,\n\u201cDo you want to pick a watch?\u201d I mean, the last thing in the world I ever wanted at that\npoint was a watch and I said, \u201cNo.\u201d And he had a man\u2019s ring and he took off a man\u2019s ring\nand he gave it to me. To this day I don\u2019t know what I did with the ring, cause I don\u2019t\nhave it and I must have lost it somewheres, cause it didn\u2019t fit me. He handed me this ring.\nHe just wanted -- he wanted to be nice. He -- he -- he saw that we were these two hungry\nkids and he tried to be nice to us and he was. And they brought us into this -- which they\nestablished, a DP camp and there were people there already and they had given us a\nshower and they gave us -- they deloused us and they gave us clean clothes and they gave\nus food and they -- medical attention for those that needed medical attention and I\nremember them telling us, eat slowly, just a little bit of soup, just -- and -- and I just\nwanted to take all of that in at one point, you know, but I must say at that point, they\nwere good to us, they were nice. You know, so --",
        "A: No and I don\u2019t know to this day. I have no recollection. I have a bad memory for dates\nanyhow. I mean, I had to ask what today\u2019s date was.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t even know what day it was. I mean you lose -- totally lose\ntrack. I -- if you\u2019ve ever been in a hospital and they give you drugs or -- or whatever and\nyou\u2019re there three days, you think you\u2019ve been there a month. You just lose track of time\nand it didn\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t care. You know, there are -- certain people have certain\npriorities. I didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to get out of -- of the clothes that -- that was biting\nme, that I wanted -- needed to be deloused and I needed to know that there was a taste of\nfreedom.",
        "A: It was -- I -- I believe it was in Germany -- a area of Germany they -- they took over,\nyou know, and it was in Germany, but I don\u2019t know. It was -- they had -- the particular\ncamp was -- there were houses that I was put into, 1t was -- they had taken over like an\napartment building. You know, like several -- actually several apartment buildings they\nhad taken over. And I recall that they had put like -- like wires on the windows so that the\nsoldiers -- the Russian soldiers couldn\u2019t get at the women. They weren\u2019t protecting us\nfrom their soldiers, they were protecting their soldiers from us, cause we were carriers of\ndisease at that point and they were sure -- wanted to make sure that their soldiers\nwouldn\u2019t get at any of the women. So --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: -- wires on the windows so that the soldiers -- the Russian soldiers couldn\u2019t get at the\nwomen. They weren\u2019t protecting us from their soldiers, they were protecting their\nsoldiers from us, cause we were carriers of disease at that point and they were sure --\nwanted to make sure that their soldiers wouldn\u2019t get at any of the women. So we were\nreally being guarded at that point, you know. But, it was --",
        "A: But it was -- 1t was to protect you, or to protect them?",
        "A: Well, I was there for awhile, until they gave me medical attention and they fed me and\nthey deloused me and there was a lot of talk amongst ourselves, amongst the people that\nwere freed. Amongst the Jews who -- where are we going to go? What are we going to\ndo? Do we have a home to go to? Who has survived? Do we want to go back to our\nhometowns? These are the people that didn\u2019t want us. We were afraid to go back to our\nhometowns. So there were a lot of discussions of what to do, but how long can you stay\nin a DP camp and how long are they going to keep you in a DP camp? Although today I\nknow that many people stayed for many months in DP camps, but I didn\u2019t know this at\nthe time. I was anxious to get out of there and I chose to go back to my hometown. And\nthe Russians did give me passage to go to my hometown. Didn\u2019t give me extra money,\ndid not give me any extra clothes, but did give me passage to go back to my hometown.\nAnd when I -- of course when I came home, I found nothing and no one.",
        "A: We lost each other. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t even -- we knew each other by first names, but\nwe hever even knew each other\u2019s last names. And sometimes that was done on purpose.\nWhen you were in a barrack with someone, you didn\u2019t want to know their last name\nbecause today they were your friend and tomorrow they were in a gas chambers or they\nwere laying in a ditch somewheres and we couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t handle it and it was\nmuch easier to handle if I just knew your first name.",
        "A: So, oftentimes we didn\u2019t ask for last names. And after we were liberated, we just lost\ntouch with each other.",
        "A: Her first name was Sima.",
        "A: I -- I think it\u2019s S-i-m-a, I think.",
        "A: The name of the town was Klucharky and it is better known by -- there was a -- like a\nbig city, which even today, it\u2019s called Mooncartch or Mooncartchavo in the Czech\nlanguage. Kluchark -- Mooncartchavo at that point was known for it\u2019s Jewish culture, it\nwas known for it\u2019s -- the Yeshivas, which are Jewish universities and it\u2019s even today a\nvery well-known city. And we lived like -- it was like a suburb, like maybe Evanston to\nChicago kind of a suburb and we used to walk to the big city all the time. And so I chose\nto go back home. And after I was in touch with my dad, I wanted to come to this country\nand of course he tried to get me to this country, but then Communism took over and the\nborders were closed. And --",
        "A: How does one describe of -- seeing someone or not seeing someone, okay? We were\nthe people -- we were the Jews that came back, that our neighbors gave up, okay? One\nway or another they gave us up. They turned in our names when the Germans first came\nin. They may not have pointed all of us out on the street, but they did have to turn in our\nnames. When we were being gathered -- when we were being taken to the train, while we\nwere in the ghetto, in our hometown, these neighbors never came to ask if we needed\nanything, if they could help us, if we were hungry, if we were thirsty. We were in this\nghetto as prisoners. When we came back, after the war, we were the people that didn\u2019t\nexist. They looked through us. They didn\u2019t speak to us, they didn\u2019t acknowledge us. They\ndidn\u2019t ask us if we needed anything. They didn\u2019t offer to give back my mother\u2019s clothes\nor my mother\u2019s furniture. They didn\u2019t offer to make us a meal. We were just the invisible\npeople, so to speak. So, we came back, but as far as they were concerned, they didn\u2019t\naccept us back. And, when you go to a place where you\u2019re not accepted, you in turn get\nthis attitude of, well, they didn\u2019t really want me, so I don\u2019t want them either, okay? And\nwe did the best we could without associating with neighbors. Which is very strange\nbecause, if you\u2019ve been to Europe, the houses are close together. It\u2019s -- you live as a\ncommunity. Prior to the war, we lived as a -- as a community, we were part of the\ncommunity. We went to school together, we lived together, we -- we played together.\nAnd here I come back home -- this was my home, I came back home. But there was\nnobody waiting for me and nobody to accept me back into this community. So, it was a\nvery strange feeling and I have to tell you that I couldn\u2019t wait to get away from there. I\ncouldn\u2019t wait to get out of there. I was afraid to go to sleep at night. I don't know if you\ncan understand this today, but there was -- we -- we lived with the fear of bei -- being\nturned in again. There -- there was no freedom when we came back. We had to leave.",
        "A: It was a totally separate world. It was strange because when my dad -- after I had\ncontacted my dad and he had gotten my first letter, he called me long distance, of course,\nto -- to Europe, from the United States. We had one telephone in town and that was in the\npost office. So the postman came to tell me that I was going to get a long distance call\ntomorrow at three o\u2019clock, from America. I mean America was this -- this big country,\nyou know, the -- the symbol of freedom. When I came to the post office, the next day at\nthree o\u2019clock, to wait for my call, the entire town was out there listening and looking, but\nnobody acknowledged me, but the ears were all there. And, so it was kind of interesting,\nbecause obviously they knew. Everybody listened in and of course, when you are not\nused to speaking on a telephone, you shout. You think that you need to shout cause, you\nknow, the ocean and -- and it\u2019s going to get across the ocean, you know? And, so\nobviously they did hear my end of the conversation. I\u2019m sure they heard it across the\nocean, you know, cause I was shouting, but didn\u2019t hear the other end of the conversation.\nBut they were curious enough to leave their homes and to come to this. But no offer of\nany help. And, I think to this day, I live in a sense of amazement, shock, maybe wonder,\nthat people could be that way -- that people could act that way. That if people see a\nhungry child, not to offer food. That, of people to see someone hurting, not to ask why. It\nwas an amazing world and amazing people and to this day I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t\nunderstand it. And probably, if I were to go back there today and speak to them about\nthis, they would see it in a different way and they would remember it in a different way\nthan I do. But I have a very clear hurt -- hurt memory of this, that even after the war -- I\nthink I would have respected them more if they had come to us after the war and if they\nhad said, \u201cThis was a mad world, we didn\u2019t know what we were doing.\u201d Or, \u201cWe did\nknow what we were doing, but we misjudged.\u201d Or, \u201cHow can we help you today, to\novercome this?\u201d Or, \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry for what happened.\u201d I would look at these\npeople and I would say, \u201cI can understand.\u201d But I can not understand indifference.\nIndifference hurts. Indifference causes wars. Indifference causes children to be killed and\ncauses hunger and I think we all need to care. And maybe we\u2019 ve learned from this. But\nright after the war, the lesson wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: I\u2019ve been back to Europe and I was not far and I was going to cross the border and I\nwas going to go back there, out of curiosity. You need to know that there 1s a place that I\nwas born in, I have wonderful memories of. And also very sad and very bitter memories.\nThe draw is there to go back and relive some of my good memories, but the other part is\nthat there\u2019s no one I know there. Do I really want to see what my house looks like today?\nDo I really want to go back? And there\u2019s this -- this constant fight, there\u2019s this -- yes, part\nof me wants to go back and see and the other part of me says, \u201cBut you weren\u2019t wanted\nthere. You left there cause you weren\u2019t wanted there, why do you want to go back?\u201d But\nI\u2019m also going to Europe in three weeks, through the Washington Holocaust Museum and\nthis thought plays in my mind even today, am I going to go back, am I not? Cause I\u2019m\nnot going to be that far. So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I decided not to go. The hurt was -- I couldn\u2019t face it. I chose not to face it. The\nmemories are too fresh. When I -- many people -- most of us were liberated from the\ncamps 50 some years ago. I was liberated when I started to speak about my experiences\nand the memories are still too fresh. And I -- I can\u2019t face the hurt just now.",
        "A: I -- th-the one memory that I really have of is him crying at one end on the phone and\nme crying at the other end of the phone. And him asking of do I know if anybody else\nhad survived and -- and telling me that he was going to try and bring me to this country,\nthat he wanted me to come here. And my end was mostly, \u201cOh, yes,\u201d you know. And --\nand I remember the tears, just a lot of -- a-at that point they were tears of sadness and of\nhappiness and -- and the first conversation was -- was a very sad conversation for both of\nUS.",
        "A: I think I was 15.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s not so easy to get to America when you live in Europe right after the war\nand you\u2019re caught under Communism. So there are steps to be taken from there. Some o -\n- some of the Jews had left that part of the country and had gone to -- the -- the areas had\nbecome divided and part of Germany had become the Su -- the Sudatenlands. And my\nmother\u2019s one brother had lived and gone to the Sudatenlands and he knew that I had\nsurvived and he was in touch with me. And he paid a man money to have me smuggled\nover the border from where I lived, under Communism, into the Sudatenlands. So, he\npaid this man money and this man was a professional smuggler of people. And there\nwere several of us 1n this group, several women. And he collected the money ahead of\ntime and he took us in the group. It was in the winter, in snow up to our knees, in the\nmiddle of the night. We all gathered and had our little knapsacks on our backs and he is\ngoing to help us cross the border. So now, he takes us at night and he takes us into the\nforest and we\u2019re going to cross the border, okay? We came into the forest in the middle\nof the night and he -- we walked -- after walking hours and hours and hours in snow in --\nin -- in the forest and slipping and being cold and being hungry and he brings us into a\nlittle bit of a shack, some sort of a shack. And in this shack, there are beds and there\u2019s hot\nsoup waiting for us. And it was nice and warm and he told us that we are to spend the\nnight in this shack and we\u2019re to have the hot soup and get a good night\u2019s rest. And he is\ngoing to come back the next day and he 1s going to lead us the rest of the way. And he\nleaves us and he forgets to come back. He never came back. So, we stayed in this little\nshack -- cottage -- whatever it was, for two days and three days and four days and we\ndidn\u2019t know whether we had crossed the border or hadn\u2019t crossed the border. We didn\u2019t\nknow which way the border was and we didn\u2019t know what to do. And we finally realized\nthat this man is not going to come back. So, we decided we\u2019re going to take a chance and\njust pick a direction and we\u2019re going to go in a particular direction, which we did. And\nwe made our way through the forest at night and when daybreak came, we came to a little\ntown and we came near a river. And there were small boats near the river that were\nturned over -- like dinghies, I guess they call them, they were turned over because it was\nwinter. And so we did -- in the -- in the day, we all climbed underneath these boats. You\nknow, two or three of us would take one little boat and we climbed underneath the boat\nand we spend the day there and when evening came, we came out of the boats. At this\npoint we\u2019re hungry and we came out and we started to walk into town, three of us at one\npoint. And we came into the town and when I looked up at the town -- I don\u2019t even recall\nnow, I remembered my grandmother had family living in this town. So, I started to ask\nquestions and their name was Weissburger, so I stopped someone on the street and I\nasked, \u201cDo you know where the Weissburgers live and did any of them come back?\u201d And\nthe person said, \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are two brothers that survived the war and\ncame back,\u201d\u2019-- excuse me -- and showed us where to go. So the three of us came to my\ncousin, who opened the door and when I -- they didn\u2019t known me and I told them who I\nwas and what we -- what had happened. They took us in and they went and brought the\nrest of the group to come to their home. At that point, when we crossed the bor -- when\nthe man was going to bring us across the border, we all had families or friends waiting\nfor us with falsified papers, so we could stay in the Sudatenlands, okay? My uncle was\nwaiting for me with falsified papers and I also had one cousin that crossed the border\nwith me and she was going to be met by someone else with falsified papers. Well, we\nstayed with my family there for several days and their friends and families were notified\nand they all came to get them with their papers, as did my uncle. My cousin couldn\u2019t get\nin touch with whoever it was who was bringing her papers and she walked out one day\nand she was caught and sent back over the border. I had learned since that she stayed\nthere and had married someone and had raised a family, but stayed under Communism. I,\non the other hand, went to where my uncle lived and stayed with him. My uncle had a\nlittle grocery store and I helped him in this grocery store. After a while, he also smuggled\nmy aunt, who came to stay with me in Europe. He had her smuggled out with someone\nelse and she also lived with us in this little grocery store and we helped my uncle. I was\nable to get in touch with my father through there -- through letters, and he was able to\nsend me papers. He also -- every time he wrote me a le-letter, there was either a dollar\nbill or a five dollar bill or a ten dollar bill in there. What I didn\u2019t know was that my mail\nwas being censored, okay? But it was handed to me. The day I was leaving on the train,\nwith my feet on the train, with my passport in hand, the police came to ask me what\nhappened to the money that my father had sent me, because that meant that I was selling\nat black market, right? My aunt is standing at the train, my uncle is standing at the train,\nmy friends came to see me off, there are motorcycles all over the place that friends came\nto see me off cause I was leaving the Sudatenlands and going to Sweden. I am standing\non the steps of this train as the police are looking at me and asking me what happened to\nthe money. And I held up my passport and visa and I said, \u201cOh, I had to pay for my\npassport and my visa with that money. I had to go and pay.\u201d And the train started and I\nleft. It was like, I can\u2019t believe I was thinking this fast. What made me give this answer?\nYou know, so it was quite a -- quite an escape at that point.",
        "A: It was in my old -- in my hometown we were getting it, when we first came home,\nthey were -- the Unrah packages were coming, you know. And I remember getting what\nwe called the high button shoes, which -- you know, the shoes that were lacing up. You\nknow, you\u2019re a young girl, you come out of a camp and you gain a little bit of weight and\n-- and you think the world is all yours and here I\u2019m -- I may not have had much, but I\ndon\u2019t really want to wear those ugly shoes. I mean, couldn\u2019t they have sent -- I\u2019m sure\nthat in America, they have nicer shoes, I mean. But we didn\u2019t care about the clothes, we\nwanted the food. We kept opening the packages and we wou -- there would be cookies in\nthere. There would be candy bars in there, cigarettes, gum and also clothes and some\ncanned -- canned goods were in there and so we -- we appreciated the food. We may have\nlooked down on the shoes, but we did appreciate the food, because we were hungry even\nthere and we needed -- everything was being rationed still. And we truly thanked -- every\ntime a package came, we said thank you. We -- we did appreciate it.",
        "A: Not until I came here. Not until I came to this country did I catch on that gum is to be\nchewed. No, it was very sweet and it was -- it tasted like candy and probably still\ngrowing in my stomach.",
        "A: Came to Sweden and we came to Sweden and stayed in Sweden several days and\nSweden to me, at that time, was the land of plenty. It was Guttenburg, Sweden. And we\nwere given all the chocolate we wanted, we were given food, we were given fruit. I\nremember I was given a banana and I hated -- I -- the smell of banana and -- and could\nnever eat the banana, but there you could have had all the bananas you wanted. And from\nthere I was -- I took a ship called the Grippsholm, which I believe is still in service today,\nit\u2019s a Swedish liner. And I came over with many of our young people, many Jewish\npeople that were lucky enough to get their passports and visas. Immigration was very,\nvery tight right after the war, to come into this country. This country didn\u2019t open it\u2019s\ndoors freely to us immigrants. And at that point, one had to show that one had family\nhere or friends that could vouch for them, that th -- they wouldn\u2019t be a burden on the\ngovernment. The government did not want to support us in any way, so we had to prove\nthat there was someone we were coming to. It took a long time to get the passports and\nthe visas. I was one of the lucky people, because I was still what was considered under\nage. And so I was able to get my passport and my visa and came over on a child\u2019s -- still\non a child\u2019s passport and visa, so I -- my -- the quota -- I did not have to wait for the long\nquota numbers at that particular time. And so when we boarded the ship, the Grippsholm,\nwe tried to stay together. We did not have first class passage, let me tell you. And I\nremember my cabinmate -- is that what they call them? The person that shared the cabin\nwith me was an American young woman. And -- a very pretty young woman and she had\na birthmark on her face -- a dark birthmark on her face. We could not communicate in\nany way. She was a little older than I was and she ignored me very much at that point.\nAnd we couldn\u2019t communicate anyhow, so it didn\u2019t matter. But I remember sitting up on\nmy bunk bed and -- cause we had the -- up, and watching her put on make-up and I didn\u2019t\nknow anything about make-up at that point, but I remember watching her, how she was\ncovering up that birthmark. And when she covered it up with make-up, one couldn\u2019t see\nit and she was absolutely beautiful and really had this beautiful smile. But we would stay\nby ourselves. The young people -- the young Jewish people would stay by ourselves. And\nI need to tell you that I really wanted to come and see my dad and wanted to come to this\ncountry as freedom, but my first choice was Israel. I wanted to go to Israel, cause most of\nmy friends, at that point, were going to Israel. I didn\u2019t care that I was being smuggled\ninto Israel, I didn\u2019t care that I had to fight for the freedom there. I felt that was going to\nbe my country and I wanted to go to Israel, but because my dad was here and the need to\nsee him, I came to this country.",
        "A: No. No, I never did. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him in any way and I was just happy to be\nreunited with him. But my ultimate goal was to go to Israel. I mean, I was going to come\nhere and then go to Israel. And I remember going into -- we left Sweden and we came to\nEngland and then we came to New York. And I had my dad\u2019s brother and sister-in-law --\nmy uncle, whom I remembered from Europe, he left. He was one of the lucky ones, he\nwas able to leave. He was like almost the last person able to leave Europe and come to\nthis country. And I remembered skipping school. We still lived in freedom at that point\nand, skipping school and going to the train to watch him leave. Cause I love him, he was\n-- my dad was here and he sort of became like my dad. And I remember being punished\nfor skipping school. So, when I came to this country, he was the one that met me in New\nYork and he and his wife, who was American born, and -- took me to New Jersey. And at\nthat point it was East Orange, New Jersey and I didn\u2019t see my dad til the next day. But I\nremember my mother also had a sister living in Brooklyn and when my aunt and uncle\ncame to meet me in New York, my aunt\u2019s sister -- my -- my mother\u2019s sister also came.\nNow this was -- one was my father\u2019s brother and sister-in-law and one was my mother\u2019s\nsister. My father and my aunt didn\u2019t get along and -- and -- so one was pulling me to go\nto their house and one was pulling me to go to her house, cause I was her sister\u2019s\ndaughter and she wanted me to go there. But I wound up going with my uncle, whom I\nknew, because I did not know my aunt on the other side. I mean I knew -- didn\u2019t even\nknow she existed until I came into this country. And I stayed with my aunt and uncle and\nwent to bed that night and I remember waking up the very next morning and someone\nwas sitting on the edge of my bed, looking down at me. This man is sitting at the edge of\nthe bed, staring at me as I am sleeping. And you know, you get that feeling and I opened\nmy eyes and it was my dad. He -- he was -- that\u2019s the first I had seen him in many, many\nyears. In fact, I didn\u2019t even remember him. So, it was a very strange feeling.",
        "A: Well, I knew he was coming the next day, but he must have either come in during the\nnight or must have come very early that morning, and --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: -- have come very early that morning, and -- to see me, you know. Cause he was\nworking and couldn\u2019t meet me the day I came in, but he was there the very next morning.\nSo, it was very strange.",
        "A: Well, what happened? We were -- in -- in the very beginning --",
        "A: The scene Is -- it\u2019s very hard to describe. How does one describe a father seeing his\nchild for the first time in many years? Or -- or a child seeing her father for the first time,\nin freedom? It was a lot of emotion. I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t even describe it. And especially\non my dad\u2019s part, because I believe that all his life, he lived with the guilt that he left and\nhe lost his family there. He lost his two sons, he lost his wife. He didn\u2019t leave us by\nchoice, he didn\u2019t desert us. He left us to make a better living for himself and for us, so it\nisn\u2019t that he walked away from us; he always supported us. But his feelings were always\nthat maybe if he had stayed, he could have done something more. Or maybe if he --\nmaybe he could have sent papers sooner -- which he couldn\u2019t. We had all our papers to\ncome to this country. We just got caught in the madness of it. And he never should have\nfelt guilt and he never should have blamed himself, because he did whatever he needed to\ndo and the best he knew how. So, I honestly believe that all his life, he lived with -- with\nthe guilts of that. But as far as I was concerned, he nee -- he -- he didn\u2019t need to, because\nhe couldn\u2019t have done more. And he certainly did everything he could for me, once I\ncame here. I was one of the lucky ones. Many survivors that came to this country didn\u2019t\nhave it easy when they first came here. Many tell the stories of being brought here, but\nfamilies were sending them to work the next day and they had to live in -- in -- in the\nbasement and they weren\u2019t really welcome and they had very hard times. My dad was not\na wealthy man, but he certainly provided for me when I first came. He gave me love. I\nnever lived with him when I first came here, cause he lived in a small apartment and I\nlived with his brother and sister-in-law, who -- my aunt and uncle and my aunt, to this\nday -- she\u2019s 82 years old and if she was my mother I couldn\u2019t love her more and she\ncouldn\u2019t have been better to me. I came to a loving family. I came to a family that opened\ntheir arms to me and did the best they knew how. So I really was one of the lucky ones.",
        "A: My father lived here in Chicago, on Armitage Avenue.",
        "A: Brought me back here.",
        "A: Brought me here and I lived here all the time.",
        "A: Lived here -- yes, lived here in Chicago and to this day my aunt is the most loving,\nmost wonderful lady. Had three children of her own and raised me as her own. Taught\nme how to speak English. Taught me -- sent me to school. Made sure I learned how,\nwhen and where, the ways of this country and was just wonderful. So, I was one of the\nlucky people that came to a loving family.",
        "A: My father was a man of few words. You could be in the same room with my dad all\nday long and maybe you would hear five words out of him. I don\u2019t know where I got the\ngift of gab, but certainly not from him. He was a very quiet individual. My dad talked to\nme once, actually -- deep talk, once. Do I know what happened to my mother and am I\nsure my mother died? Am I sure my brothers died? No, I wasn\u2019t sure my brothers died at\nthat point, cause I saw them alive once in Auschwitz. My dad and I tried to trace them\nthrough organizations, but obviously couldn\u2019t. He wanted to find his family. We talked\nabout the war once and then we didn\u2019t talk about it any longer. He didn\u2019t talk to me\nbecause he felt that he was opening wounds. I didn\u2019t discuss it with him because I felt the\nsame way, but by his looks and by his actions -- he did remarry many years later -- many\nyears later. In fact, I was married already and -- and -- excuse me -- I believe I was\npregnant with my son when my dad remarried. So, it took him all of these many years to\nremarry. But I believe that he lived with his guilts all his life, cause he loved his family.\nHe wanted his family.",
        "A: Herman Weiss. When I went back to -- to Auschwitz several years ago, back then --\n\u201893, I believe, there\u2019s a room in Auschwitz where it has all luggage, suitcases. I walked\ninto this room and the first suitcase that stares at me is Weiss, W-e-1-s-s. That was my\nmaiden name. Do I know if it was ours? No. Would I recognize it? No. Could it have\nbeen? Yes. Do you know what that does to one\u2019s insides? Standing there, looking at that?",

        "A: When I first came -- when I first got off the sh -- the ship in New York and I\u2019m in this\ncar with my aunt and uncle and they take me into a Walgreen\u2019s for a soda -- ice cream,\nokay? Now, here I am, in this Walgreen\u2019s that 1s big and that has everything. Here it is\nselling medicine on one corner and you can buy a pair of shoes in the other corner. Now,\nin Europe, it\u2019s an -- if it\u2019s a drugstore, it only sells medicine, you know. Dat -- apotocare\n-- | can\u2019t even pronounce it -- where it\u2019s -- medicine is sold. And I remember sitting there\nand just sitting on this stool that would turn. What do they call those stools, where you\ncould turn them and you could turn in all directions? By the counter, the counter stools.\nAnd I remember holding the soda in -- in my hand and just turning in this chair in\namazement and looking around in this drugstore where you can just walk and take\nsomething off a shelf and just pay for it. There\u2019s everything here in this drugstore and I\u2019m\nsaying to myself, \u201cMy God,\u201d you know, \u201cwhere am I, what is 1t?\u201d And of course, New\nYork City, do I need to tell you about the tax1 cabs\u2019? I mean, it wasn\u2019t as bad as it is\ntoday. In Europe, yes, we had cars and trucks and all of that, but I remember riding a\nmotorcycle with my uncle cause we didn\u2019t have a car and I remember getting a flat tire\nevery other block, cause we didn\u2019t have the good tires, you know, right after the war.\nAnd here is all the buses and the trucks and the streetcars and the -- and the confusion\nand the people in all directions. And it was like it was mind boggling that first day.\nAbsolutely mind boggling. When I came to Chicago, I -- I had stayed with my aunt and\nuncle in New York for a few weeks. And when I came to Chicago, it -- it became now --\nin New York, I lived in New Jersey, which is more of a small community. When I came\nto Chicago, I came into the city, okay? Now I\u2019m living in this big city. I came from a\nlittle town in Europe, I did not come from this big city. So it was very different and very\nstrange and I remember the clothes that I came -- that I brought from Europe was the\nwrong clothes. I came with all the wrong clothes, you know, so when I was in New\nJersey, my aunt took that clothes away from me and she got rid of it and bought me new\nclothes. When I came to Chicago, to my aunt here, my aunt decided -- my aunt in\nChicago decided that my aunt in New -- New Jersey bought me all the wrong clothes. So\nnow she emptied out this -- this suitcase and she took me shopping for different clothes.\nSo now I had to learn how to do this. My aunt was a young woman at the time also and\nshe had three children. Now, I spoke German when I came here. I spoke Hungarian, I\nspoke Yiddish, okay? I spoke Czech, but did not speak English. My aunt spoke a little bit\nof German. So, between her little bit of German that she had and my German, we were\nable to communicate. And of course, with my dad, Is -- could speak Yiddish or I could\nspeak, you know, in Hungarian. And it didn\u2019t matter, you know, cause my dad\u2019s -- when\nmy dad came to this country, he didn\u2019t have time to go to school and -- and he -- his\nEnglish was with a very heavy accent, as we all have, but his, you know, he never really\nlearned how to speak proper English, so to speak. My aunt decided that I was going to\nlearn how to speak with her children, with her three children. And every time I would say\nsomething that wasn\u2019t so, as I was learning, she would correct me. And to this day there\u2019s\na family joke where her little boy must have been two or two and a half years old at the\ntime and she -- his name was Jimmy and she called Jimmy and he -- his answer was,\n\u201cHere I are, Mommy, here I are.\u201d And now, my aunt did not correct her two year old or\ntwo and a half year old, but she looked at me and she, with her finger goes, \u201cFritzie, you\ndon\u2019t say here I are. You never say here I are.\u201d You know, so she made sure that I\nlearned how to speak. And send me to school and -- and I think it\u2019s due to her that I\nspeak a little better English than some of us that came over here. And -- but I was always\nunhappy, I always wanted to go to Israel. Always, all the time and now I am starting to\nspeak out loud and now I am telling my dad, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to stay here, it\u2019s very\nhard, I don\u2019t know the language. I don\u2019t know, I don't dress properly, I don\u2019t do anything,\nI\u2019m -- I -- I want to go to Israel.\u201d And he always said, \u201cNo, you\u2019ll learn, you\u2019ll learn.\u201d\nAnd I guess one day he decided he is going to call my bluff and he looked at me one day\nand he said, \u201cOkay. If that\u2019s what you really want, if that\u2019s what will make you happy, I\nwill send you to Israel. When do you want to leave?\u201d And at this point I go, \u201cWell,\nmaybe I really don\u2019t want to go to Israel. Maybe I really like it here,\u201d you know. And I\nhave to tell you that I love this country. Yes, I am a flag waver, with it\u2019s politics and with\nall that\u2019s going on, I feel it is my country and -- and I treat it as such. I love it.",
        "A: I went to a special school originally, it was called Adante School. And I remember\ntaking the streetcar from where we lived to -- and it was quite a way to go, it was about\n35 minutes by streetcar. And I remember coming there once and ha -- needing to get off,\nbecause the streetcar wasn\u2019t stopping and I\u2019m standing at the back door and I\u2019m\nhollering, \u201cUp, up, up,\u201d instead of saying that I need to get out. I didn\u2019t know how to\nspeak and everybody is standing there laughing at me because I am hollering, \u201cUp,\u201d\ninstead of that I need to get off this -- this streetcar. And eventually somebody caught on\nand said, \u201cI guess she needs to get off,\u201d you know and they pulled that bell or whatever it\nwas. And then -- so I would go to school and then my dad worked for Vienna sausage\ncompany where -- which was like maybe a block away and I remember after school every\nday, I would walk to Vienna sausage company and have a sandwich there and wait for\nmy dad to finish work and then I would -- he would drive me back home. So this -- this\nwas going on for quite awhile. And I hated to -- I -- I -- I learned to hate corned beef\nsandwiches, cause I had one every day. Today we find out it\u2019s cholesterol heaven, you\nknow.",
        "A: We lived -- originally, when I came here, we lived in East Rogersburg. 1348 and a\nhalf Esther Street. I li -- we lived in a four room apartment with three little children, my\naunt, my uncle and Fritzie. And originally I slept on -- they had those chairs that\nconverted into beds at that time. That was my bed, because we were really cramped until\nwe moved into bigger -- a bigger apartment. But, it was very hard in the beginning. It was\n-- this is not an easy country to come to. You need to remember that during the time we\ncame here, right after the war, the Americans were not the travelers they have become\ntoday. The Americans, at that time, were not as tolerant of an accent as they are today.\nBecause today they travel and they\u2019ve become the foreigners in the foreign lands and\nthey -- they know what it means to learn a different language. They were not tolerant of\nus; we were called the greena in -- in Jewish. We were called the refugees. We were told\nnot to speak our -- about our past, we should forget about it. Nobody wants to listen to us,\nnobody wants to hear it. Some of us could not speak about our past, but some of us\nneeded to speak about our past and nobody would listen to us and nobody wanted to hear\nit. We were told to keep quiet. We were just -- people did not tolerate us and were not\nalways nice to us when we first came here and was very difficult. This is a very difficult\nlanguage to learn. One word can have different meanings and especially to spell, my\nGod, I mean, I\u2019Il never learn how to spell. I still don\u2019t know why there is a k in front of a\nknife, you know, but -- the word knife. But it was very difficult. Most of us found it very\ndifficult when we first came here.",
        "A: The families. The } -- the other Jewish people, the people that -- that one needed to\ntalk to, our neighbors, everybody. Nobody wanted to listen, nobody wanted to hear about\nwhat happened in the past. Whether it was from guilt, that nobody did anything here or\nwhat it was from. I remember when I got married and -- and -- and my husband and I\nwent to the movies, the Chicago theater, downtown. And in those days they used to show\na newsreel before the movie started. I recall a newsreel coming on while we were sitting\nin the theater and it showed openings of camps and -- and the atrocities of some of it,\nduring that time. And I couldn\u2019t face up to it and I walked out. And my husband followed\nme and we came to -- we were in the lobby of the Chicago theater and as we\u2019re standing\nthere, people are saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand while -- why they are showing those\natrocities. We know that didn\u2019t happen. Those things could have never happened the way\nthey are showing them.\u201d And I\u2019m standing there, me, who has just come out of one of\nthose places and not answering, because of ignorance of people. So, they didn\u2019t want to\nknow. How many of us close our eyes and close our ears to things that are going on 1n the\nworld today? We don\u2019t want to know. And maybe we could help and maybe we can\u2019t,\nbut we don\u2019t.",
        "A: We were getting very mixed messages and we were also -- each one of us needs to\nhandle a death or an atrocity or a tragedy in our own ways. We -- we can\u2019t predict how\nwe\u2019re going to react and we should never judge the next person of their -- of how they are\nhandling it. I have learned this. My aunt and uncle that I lived with in Chicago -- I\u2019m just\ngoing to use this then, as an example, were -- were going on vacation. My uncle had just\nsold his business and they were going to take their first vacation and they were driving to\nCalifornia and they got into a terrible accident. It was a head on collision and my uncle\nwas killed instantly. And I remember getting this call that my uncle was killed and that\nthe rest of them were all hurt and -- in this automobile accident. Now, I loved my uncle\nas much as I loved my father or anyone in the family, cause I lived with him, he became\nmy father image. And I recall getting this call and going hysterical laughing. Laughing\nand crying, tears, but -- but -- like I was in -- in a hysterical -- now that was my way of\naccepting it at that time. The concentration camps were similar, but a different story. The\nshock of the camps, the things we saw, the things we lived through. And you might sit\nhere for two weeks listening to some of the things that we had gone through in one day\nand listen to two different people from the same place, experiencing the same thing, but\nseeing it and experiencing it in a different way and both reacting in a different way.\nWhen I got out of the camps and when I came here, I -- I couldn\u2019t live with those\nthoughts. I couldn\u2019t handle them. I just -- I would have been -- they would have put me in\nan institution if I had lived with it day in and day out. So, I guess my way was to pretend.\nI pretended. All of those people were in a camp, my family and all the other Jewish\nfamilies, they were all in Auschwitz. All those babies were killed in Auschwitz. The gas\nchambers were going day in and day out. I saw them in a movie, it never happened to me.\nI was not there. This was a nightmare. I needed to walk away from it. I couldn\u2019t think\nabout it, I couldn\u2019t live with myself. I couldn\u2019t watch my dad\u2019s sad eyes. So, I went into a\npretend world. I needed to be a young girl. If Iam going to be this young girl, I am going\nto be this normal young girl and live a normal life, right? So you put yourself in this\npretend world and you live your days this way and it works. For the most part, 1t works.\nThen come the nights. You don\u2019t have control over your mind at night when you\u2019re\nsleeping. You don\u2019t have control over your dreams and your nightmares. So, yes, you do\npretend in the daytime, but the reality sets in through your dreams and through your\nnightmares, every single night. Every single night, somebody had to wake me and tell me\nit was -- \u201cit\u2019s a dream, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay now, you\u2019re free.\u201d To this day, when I\nspeak about it, my husband still has to wake me and tell me, \u201cIt\u2019s okay -- you\u2019re okay.\u201d\nSo, for many years, I needed to live a different kind of a life and deny the fact that I was\nthere. And I did this for many years. When our son was old enough to go to school, they\ndidn\u2019t teach anything about the Holocaust. I don\u2019t know if they did when you went to\nschool, but there was very little in those days. It isn\u2019t like today. We didn\u2019t have a\nWashington Holocaust Museum to tell us. He learned about the Holocaust in Sunday\nschool and he\u2019d come home and ask questions. And I couldn\u2019t answer them. I pretended\nthat it didn\u2019t happen to me, but I didn\u2019t say this to him, I just said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk\nabout it, we\u2019re not going to talk about it.\u201d Yes, my me -- my family knew I was a\nsurvivor. My in-laws knew, my husband knew. I didn\u2019t pretend in front of them. I never\nhid it from anyone, I couldn\u2019t. I have this accent, I\u2019m Jewish. I came from Europe, how\ndo I hide it? But, in our home -- immediate home, we couldn\u2019t speak about it. It was not a\nsubject that was brought up. When our son went to high school, he would come home\nand ask questions and I would give very little information. I couldn\u2019t. When he got\nmarried and our first grandson was born, he needed to know more. For his own sake, he\nneeded to know more. And those were the days when they were beginning to find some\nof the Germans that had lied about what they did during the times of the war and lied\nabout taking parts in concentration camps and came to this country and they were finding\nsome of them. And those were the days when there was a janitor that lived in Hyde Park,\nI believe, I\u2019m not quite sure where, and they found out that he was a Nazi 1n one of the\nconcentration camps and they wanted to prosecute him and all his neighbors stood up and\nsaid, \u201cWell, how can you do this? He\u2019s such a good man, he\u2019s such a good neighbor, he\u2019s\nsuch a good janitor.\u201d The fact that he committed murder the times before -- God only\nknows of how many, didn\u2019t count, okay? But maybe if he had killed their sister or their\nbrother or their mother, he wouldn\u2019t have been this wonderful person. And I\u2019m saying to\nmyself, \u201cThey don\u2019t know. These people don\u2019t know. They weren\u2019t there. He didn\u2019t kill\ntheir family. He, like the rest, needs to pay for his crime.\u201d This is a country where we\nneed to account for our -- for ourselves, for what we\u2019ve done. Then my son came to me\nand said that he saw this article that was put in through the Holocaust foundation in\nSkokie, about asking for survivors to come forth and have their stories recorded. And\nyes, I saw it many times. But those were still the days when I did not speak out. So all\nthis was beginning to come to a head. My son needed to know. The janitor needed -- the\npeople needed to know what happened in concentration camps. And I started to think\nabout this and I said, \u201cMaybe some of us do need to speak out. Maybe it\u2019s going to hurt,\nbut maybe we can set the world straight.\u201d\u201d And when my son called and said, \u201cMom, you\nneed to do this because I need to know and your grandchildren will need to know.\u201d And\nthis is where a grandma and a mother gets caught. And his words were, \u201cDon\u2019t ask for\nanything. Sign whatever they want you to sign. Take a blank tape and ask for a copy of a\ntape.\u201d Which is what I did. And I went and I was interviewed. And I remember sitting in\nthis room for the very first time, coming to this home to be interviewed and I was\ninterviewed by Dr. Leon Stein, who is head of the history department, I believe, at\nRoosevelt University, who has since become a friend, but this is the first time I\u2019ve met\nhim. I remember he came there with cameras and as we started this interview, the camera\nbroke down. And I said, \u201cSee, I\u2019m not supposed to be doing this.\u201d Okay, so they asked\nme would I come back the next day -- and I had a friend go with me the first day and the\nnext day. And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, you know, I don\u2019t know that I can go through this.\u201d\nBut I did go back. And we still have a tape of that first interview, which was terrible,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t speak and it was a very bad interview. The -- the questions didn\u2019t\ncome the way they should. And I remember was a short interview and my friend that\ncame with me and I went back into my car and we sat down and when I got into the car,\nthe floodgates opened. And I went hysterical, crying on her shoulder. This 1s the first\ntime I have given this interview and I -- it just -- it just opened this gate. And then I said,\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask me anything. This is what I could have told them, that\u2019s what I could\nhave told them, this is what I should have said. But they didn\u2019t ask and I didn\u2019t think of\nsaying anything and I\u2019m never giving another interview, this is too painful. I cannot do\nthis and -- and I\u2019m never doing another interview.\u201d The next day I get a call from this\nprofessor and he says to me, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s going to be a panel discussion at the\nuniversity, would you come and go on this?\u201d And I go, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a public speaker, I\ndon\u2019t know how to do this. I am not going.\u201d He said, \u201cI live in your neighborhood. I will\npick you up, I will bring you home and let\u2019s do this.\u201d Well, this is how it started, where I\nbeca-gun to speak out. One thing led to another and I started to go into schools and I\nstarted to go into universities, started to go into synagogues and I started to work --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- do this.\u201d Well, this is how it started, where I beca-gun to speak out. One thing led to\nanother and I started to go into schools and I started to go into universities, started to go\ninto synagogues and I started to work with Mayor Daly, our mayor in Chicago. When\nMayor Daly came into office, he had a Day of Remembrance. He was the first mayor that\never had a Day of Remembrance. And I started to work with him in the schools and when\nhe had a Day of Remembrance, I was his first keynote speaker at the Daly Center and I\nspoke out at the Daly Center. And then I started to work -- Mayor Daly every year has a\nDay of Remembrance, but prior to everybody going, what most people don\u2019t know is that\nhe holds a breakfast and invites two students from every Chicago school -- the high\nschool and they have a breakfast first -- beautiful breakfast and then there\u2019s a speaker that\nspeaks to these students first and I have been his speaker for many years. This last year\nwas the first time that I did not speak, cause I said, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d And little by\nlittle, I have started to speak out and have realized the importance of a survivor to speak\nout. I have realized that only through survivors can the rest of the world learn, cause we\nwere the ones that had the experience. I realize that as we\u2019re getting older, there are not\ngoing to be many that can stand up and speak out and the revisionists are doing their\nwork now. I realize that there are hundreds of books that the revisionists are writing,\ncalling us survivors liars, that it never happened. They\u2019re on the internet today, with\nprograms, teaching children that the Holocaust did not happen. So, I have realized the\nimportance of all of this. When Washington was first in the talking stages, before there\nwas a hole in the ground, I was asked to appear on Milt Rosenberg\u2019s show and speak\nabout the Holocaust and speak about the importance of the Washington Holocaust\nMuseum. I was one of the very first to jump onto this bandwagon and have been\nspeaking out for the Washington Holocaust Museum and about it\u2019s importance, it\u2019s\nteachings, where it brings children in from all over the country, to teach about the\nHolocaust. And now that I have gotten older, my grandchildren need to know. Their\ngrandchildren will need to know, as will yours and as will sti -- as will the generation that\nwill be here after us. And this is one of the big reasons that I speak out today.",
        "A: This is very interesting. When I was the keynote speaker the first time with Mayor\nDaly, my daughter-in-law came to listen as did some friends and family. My son did not.\nI think it\u2019s too painful for him. That was recorded, as was the first tape. I\u2019ve been on\ntelevision, I\u2019ve been in newspapers. And the tape from Washington, of course. My son\nhas never come to listen to me speak in person. But he has saved every little print,\neverything that has been written, every tape that\u2019s been made. And I expect a copy of this\nand he also wants it and he saves everything. Last year, our synagogue, where my\ngrandchildren go to Hebrew school and Sunday school had asked me to come and speak\nto the class. This is the first that my son came to listen. It was like -- they gave me maybe\na half hour and you speak to children and you speak different than you speak to adults,\nbecause you don\u2019t want to send them home crying that this lady scared them and Mommy\ncalling me the next day. So you speak different, but my son came with his video camera,\nto listen to me. My oldest grandson chose to sit in and listen to me. My youngest\ngrandchu-son -- chose not to. He chose to go to his class, which he had -- which we\nallowed him to do. I was very conscious through this entire speaking time, that my son\nwas standing there with the camera and listen to his mother relate this story. And we\u2019ve\ntalked about it. We\u2019ve talked about different aspects of it. He\u2019s read about it. He\u2019s read\nMichael Beerenbaum\u2019s book where I\u2019ve been quoted and they\u2019ve also sent it to my\ngrandson for his -- for his Bar Mitzvah. And of course my grandchildren -- my oldest one\nnow 1s in high school and he has written about the Holocaust and he has been to\nWashington. So we do speak about it, but very little, very little. We don\u2019t -- he\u2019s watched\nevery tape and he wants everything. And he puts everything away. \u201cMom, I need a\ncopy.\u201d You know? But, we speak about it very little.",

And this particular evening, we had a group of doctors from\none of the hospitals and I know I\u2019m being analyzed. I mean, I just -- I can feel it. You\ndon\u2019t -- you know? So we were all done and we had this small discussion afterwards and\n-- and I don\u2019t know one of the doctors. And he was asking me different questions and\nwhatever, I don\u2019t know how we came to it and -- and I\u2019ve often said that probably I do\nneed to be analyzed, cause there are many things that I -- that I cannot remember, and --\nthings that -- during the times of the camps. And I looked at him and I said, \u201cSo, you\nanalyzed me,\u201d I said, \u201cso what do you think?\u201d He says, \u201cWell, I think that you live with a\nlot of guilts.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh? Well, what kind of guilts do I live with?\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWell, survivors guilts.\u201d He says, \u201cYou -- you feel guilty that you survived and a lot of\npeople didn\u2019t.\u201d And when I hear that I -- I -- I get angry.

I did not survive at anyone\u2019s expense. I did\nnot steal with anyone -- from anyone. I did not steal their food. I did not kill anyone. I\nwas one of the lucky ones. If there\u2019s one thing that I don\u2019t live with, is the fact that I\nsurvived and others didn\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201cSo you\u2019ve been reading the wrong books.\u201d And I\u2019ve\nheard this from many people, that survivors live with the guilts that they survived and\nothers didn\u2019t, and maybe some of us do.

        "A: The nightmares, that was the question. Okay.",
        "A: That was the question. I got sidetracked. When I first started to speak, people told me\nthat once I speak out, that the nightmares would go away. The answer is no. The\nnightmares have always been there and I believe the nightmares will always be there. Not\njust for me, but for all of us that have gone this horrible route. My husband always knows\nwhen I have had to speak. When I did a fund-raiser when I was in a school, it just brings\nit all back and the pictures all there. The screen is showing it all and you know, it doesn\u2019t\nmake it easier. It doesn\u2019t make it easier. It open -- this 1s -- this is a wound that does not\nclose. Just because we speak about it, doesn\u2019t make it go away, it makes it deeper. But we\nspeak about it, because we realize the importance of speaking out. We know the wound 1s\nthere. We don\u2019t need to open it. Survivors don\u2019t need to open it. But what we\u2019re trying to\ndo, is prevent this from happening again. And I do believe the old saying, what goes\naround, comes around. Yesterday it was Jews. Today, they\u2019re fighting over other things,\nreligion, in other parts of the world. Tomorrow it might be blue eyed people, or a\ndifferent ethnic group. But it does -- the wheel turns, it does go around. And if we don\u2019t\nspeak out and if we don\u2019t teach and if we don\u2019t show a -- what a gun can do and if we\ndon\u2019t show what hatred can do, what bigotry can do, what racism can do -- then we need\nto live with -- with fear, with hate, all our lives. We need to teach our children. Our\nchildren are not born with hatred, we teach hatred. I don\u2019t like you because you\u2019re blue\neyed or because you\u2019re black or because you\u2019re Jewish or because you\u2019re Christian. I\nteach you, my child, to hate instead of si -- teaching them nice things, do I need to teach\nthem to hate? When I go into a school -- when I go into a school, I ask these children,\nhow many of you are guilty of tormenting someone because they\u2019re too fat or too skinny\nor too blonde or they don\u2019t meet some of your quali-qualifications? They don\u2019t speak the\nway you think they should speak? What makes you the judge? What makes you\ndifferent? Why do you think that you can sit in judgment of me? How many of you\nchildren have been guilty of this? Of tormenting another child? You\u2019d be surprised how\nmany sit there and shake their hands. They know. They know.

She -- I am the Jew and she was the\nChristian person that I was working with at the time and we went back to Germany. And,\nwhen we flew into Germany -- we were taking a train -- we decided to take a train from\nMunich to wherever we were going. And we got on the train and we came into this\ncompartment and it was winter and pe -- we put down our luggage -- we were the only\ntwo people in the compartment, and we closed the door. And we -- it was cold and we\nwalked into this -- to this warm compartment and both of us started to doze. Next thing\nwe knew, the door opened and it was the conductor asking for passports, in German. And\nKay, who was my friend that I traveled with, took out her passport and handed her\npassport and I froze. I totally froze. I am this Jewish girl that is back on this train, seeing\nthis conductor coming at me, in German, asking for my passport. And he kept going,\n\u201cPassport, fraulein,\u201d and I kept staring at him. Finally, Kay, went with her elbow at me,\n\u201cFritzie, Show him your passport.\u201d And I got there -- that far, I have to have one, right?\nShe finally realized what happened and she reached into my purse and she took out my\npassport and if I tell you this conductor studied me and studied this passport for a good\nthree minutes, cause I don\u2019t think he understood what happened. He left. Kay handed me\nback the passport and I started to cry. And she looked at me and she said, \u201cWell, why?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But took me back to another time, in another place, on another\ntrain. And it just totally took me back.\u201d And I been back since, and I\u2019ve been back to\nPoland since, and I feel very uncomfortable. But I want to tell you that that pwa --\npassport is going to stay with me, because that was our lifeline during the time when we\nneeded it and couldn\u2019t get it, that would have been our lifeline.

        "A: The first time I went back. When the Washington Museum opened -- I don\u2019t know if\nyou \u2019ve been there, but they have a boxcar that took children to a concentration camp, that\nthe Polish people sent to Washington and one needs to walk through the boxcar to go\nthrough the museum. You can walk around it, but one really should walk into this boxcar\nand walk through it. And the very first time, after the museum opened, I couldn\u2019t walk\ninto it. I could not walk into this boxcar. And Maggie Daly, Mayor Daly\u2019s wife, walked\nwith me and held my hand and took me through this boxcar. And I often tell students that\ngo to Washington, that when they stand in that boxcar, if they stand very quietly, they\nwill hear voices. Voices of children that were taken to their death in that boxcar. I think\nthe turning of the wheels and the trains will always have a certain fear, a certain reminder\nto all of us.",

They came here prior to the war, Hungarian Jewish people. And she took me --\nthese friends of hers owned a small grocery store and she took me to visit them, her\nfriends, and -- in the grocery store. And, while I was in the grocery store, my husband,\nwho at that time -- whom I didn\u2019t know at the time, and his mother, walked in.

They were the\nones that worked in the coal mines and they are the ones that built the River Kwai and --\nand -- that you saw in the -- and had their own bloodshed and had their own hardships.\nSo, their stories are hard stories and they\u2019re history and they should be recorded.",

Those of us that watched our\nfamilies killed in Europe, we don\u2019t know -- we don\u2019t have -- we can\u2019t visit. They\u2019re\nscattered. When you watch babies walking towards a gas chamber, when you watch\nreligious people walking towards a gas chamber as they are praying still to God when\nthey\u2019re walking towards the gas chamber, when you watch someone dig a grave and then\nyou see them shot and fall into the grave they have dug for themselves, when you watch\ninnocent blood spilled, there\u2019s a hole that there\u2019s no cover on. The cover will not fit, the\nhole doesn\u2019t close. You live with it. It\u2019s like an ulcer that eats away at you. Some of us\nhandle it better. Some of us live with it easier, but the wound 1s always there. Maybe if\nwe had seen a normal death, which, we expect a normal death, we would get over it. But\nthis was -- there was nothing normal about his war. There was nothing normal about the\nHolocaust. We cannot forget. We cannot forgive for those people that have done it and\nwe must never forget of what has been done to the Jews, to the Gypsies, to the innocent\npeople that got caught during the time of the war. But we must re -- also remember, that\nmaybe a lot of people would have been put in danger, had they helped. They could have\nhelped. We must honor the people that helped. We must honor the righteous. They were\nthe ones that stood up and said, \u201cThis is wrong, we will help.\u201d We must always\nremember those people that did stand up and did help. Unfortunately, there are not many\nof them. Israel has honored them, Israel has planted trees for them. The forests are not\novergrowing with trees. We have an Avenue of the Righteous in Evanston. It\u2019s not\novergrowing with trees, but there were the few, there were the Schindlers, but not\nenough. And so I honor those people and I teach about those people.

But, unfortunately he died without -- without -- okay, so he\ndow -- died in drowning, but big deal, you know? He should have felt some of -- of the\npain that he caused for so many, many hundreds of pe -- of people, you know? But yeah,\nhe -- he -- Dr. Mengele was one of the doctors that did the selection and -- in Auschwitz.\nAnd he did the experiments on pregnant women and -- and he did a lot of the\nexperiments without drugs and -- and so forth. He was one of the doctors and -- with his\nentourage that would -- would have selections in the morning. We would have to get\nundressed and not walk, but run in front of him. But we knew there was going to be a\nselection and oftentimes when our hair started to grow back and -- and then somebody\u2019s\nhair would be gray, we would take dirt and rub it into that person\u2019s head and hair -- to try\nand cover the gray hair so they looked younger. We would try and pinch cheeks to show\nthat they -- we still had a little color in our face, that we didn\u2019t look so pale and dead,\neven though we were hungry and hardly had any strength. But let me tell you, strength\ncame from somewheres when there were selections, because not -- we did not walk, we\nran in front of them -- Dr. Mengele, as he stood there with his entourage, with his stick\nand -- and pointing one way or another. And some went into one line and some into\nanother. One never knew which was the good line. One -- one line went directly to the\ngas chambers, while the other line walked back into the barracks. But he was one of the --\none of the big players in -- in Auschwitz and -- and I\u2019m really sorry that he didn\u2019t stand\ntrial and didn\u2019t pay for his crime.",
        "A: Well, every time -- actually, every time we did hear about him and -- and it brought\nback memories. Just the name itself, you know, Dr. Mengele, my God, you know, you\ncan visualize this man standing there with his gloves and his -- and his stick in his hand. I\nmean, I can just see him in front of me. And the prayer was always there, please catch\nhim, please get him. And I know they\u2019ve gotten close to getting him [indecipherable] but\nyou know -- and then, it hurt when -- when I heard and read afterwards -- read afterwards\nthat his son visited him. He had a son who -- who knew where he was and his son visited\nhim and -- and all of that. And I kept saying, \u201cSure, he,\u201d you know, \u201che\u2019s -- he\u2019s still\nliving a good life and look what he did to all the other people.\u201d But there are many of\nthem that are still living, you know, and denying, and -- [knocking] It\u2019s open.",
