        "Q: I need to begin by having you state your name as it was then, the date of birth and where\nyou were born.",
        "A: My name is Icek Baum. I'm born in Warsaw the first of January, 1925. And this\nneighborhood where I was born in Warsaw, it called Powisle, this was just on the river\nbut Poland the big river is Vistula, maybe you know, and that neighborhood was called\nlike that. And my father was a tailor for the army, and so far my father was not alive. He\nwas not bad but he died. I was very young. I don't remember. It could be 1934, '33, '34,\nsomething like that. And my mother she was with seven kids. It was very, very hard. So\nthat's the beginning of a very, very hard life for all of us. I was very young at this time,\nmaybe ten-years-old, maybe younger. Maybe a little bit younger.",
        "Q: Were you the middle child, older brothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes. I have older brothers. I was the second youngster, so I have three sisters, it was three\nsisters and four brothers. So I was the more youngster, the second youngster.",
        "Q: Now, your life was difficult because your mother had so many of you to take care of, but\nperhaps you have good memories before the war?",
        "A: Good memories, yes, good memories, little bit, yes. And time when my mother couldn't\nsupport everything and I was -- it was time to go to school and first time I was in Polish\nschool. In this neighborhood there was no Jewish school and Polish and I was there but I\nwas maybe lucky, maybe my mother was lucky. She sent me to Dr. Korezak\u2019. I was in\norphanage by Korczak. Maybe you know about Korczak, something like that.",
        "Q: Now, let me just hear a little bit more about your lifestyle first, and then I do want to talk\nmore about Dr. Korczak. You went to a public school?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And many of your friends and neighbors were Christian?",
        "A: Most of them was Christian, yes. Perhaps some Jewish too, but just in this neighborhood\nwhere we were living there was not many Jews, was most Christians. And we was living\n-- like I can remember -- it was good because even I don't know what different between\nChristian or not Christian so. I remember just once when it was holidays, Passover, so we\n' Janusz Korczak (1879-1942), physician, writer, and educator. In 1912 he was appointed director the Jewish\norphanage at Krochmalna Street in Warsaw, Poland.\nhad change and we give them matzos, and they bake beautiful nice cake. And this was\nthe difference between a Jew and non-Jew and that's it.",
        "Q: So you had a good relations?",
        "A: We had a very good relationship, yes. And I think my father, my mother, she have too\ngood relationship with these peoples.",
        "Q: Did you do anything that was very uniquely Jewish, other than the holidays?",
        "A: Yes, because we went before to go to the public school my parents would send me, send -\n- us, brothers too, in the Jewish cheder*. Maybe you know. This is most religion school.\nSo that's the one that was really different between the Christians.",
        "Q: So your parents were fairly religious?",
        "A: Not very religious, but like maybe more than in this time. But my father keep always the\nSabbath and my mother she prepare always for the Friday, like a Jewish home.",
        "Q: Did you experience or were you aware of any antisemitism before Hitler came to power\nor before the war?",
        "A: Yes, lot. Yes. This would be after my father die, so you know when we becoming older\nalready say we understood more and even on the street \u201cJew, Jew.\u201d It was always the\nyoung people, they beating us and they make all kinds of stories, all kinds of things,\nbecause we was Jews. I didn't see any difference, but maybe they saw the difference\nbetween Jew and non-Jew.",
        "Q: By these were the same people that you were friendly with?",
        "A: Yes. But when they are coming older maybe they was more antisemitic \u2014 that\u2019s one of\nthe reasons. Maybe the parents teach them like that. Maybe when in the churches, when\nthey go to the churches the priest say, \u201cDon't buy by Jew. Don\u2019t.... Kill the Jews.\nBecause they killed our Jesus Christus.\u201d That's it.",
        "Q: So this was at a time when Hitler had come to power in Germany but before the war?",
        "A: That's when all before the war -- far before the war. This one, like I say, it was between\n1930, '35, 734, \u00b033, \u00b034, \u201935.",
        "Q: And these were the same people that you said a few minutes ago you went to school\nwith?\n* Orthodox primary school (Yiddish).",
        "A: Yeah, we went to school. But even in the school when we went the first time and I was in\nthe public school, so it was always that the -- but in Poland the people were very religious\nand when it\u2019s coming the time to religion -- we don't have to -- but I went out, out from\nthe classroom, and so after \u201cJew, Jew, Jew,\u201d and if they couldn't, they beat us because\nlook, we was just couple youngsters. Not so many like them. We are scared from them\nand they take advantage of us, that's it. It was very, very hard this time. So even like\nyoungster, and believe me I don't know, I couldn't understand why, why? Because I'm\nJew? And I don't see no difference because I was the same thing. We don't have no horn.\nWe don't have nothing. We took the same language. We eat the same thing. And they was\nso -- they kill. If they can't kill, they beat us. They make all kind of trouble. Sometimes,\nwe saw, they break the windows. They break all these things. Why? Because they were --\nthey're Jewish family, and believe me at this time we were very, very poor. I remember\nmine house. When my father died we were very, very poor because we had my mother.\nShe was with seven kids and support seven kids wasn't easy. She have a very, very, very\nhard life. Very hard life.",
        "Q: What did you know about what was happening in Germany before you were invaded?",
        "A: Lots of things. I don't know. The truth, just what we read sometimes in the paper, you\nknow. The Nationalsozialistische Partei\u2019, they win, you know. At this time it was\nHindenburg\u2019 -- Hindenburg lose the power and the German took the power. So when the\n-- 1939 -- just when it was Rosh Hashanah is decreed the war was starting. So the\nGermans start to come into Poland. I remember when the Pole -- I never want to believe\nthat the Poland going to lose the war. But at this time I was very young so maybe I don't\nunderstood very well, but I remember once my mother told me \u2014 she told us, \u201cYou know\nwhat, you\u2019ll see, when the Germans come in here, I don't think they are going to handle\nwith us very badly because they not the antisemites like the Polacks. Because,\u201d she say,\n\u2018I remember in the war in 1914-18 they were very friendly, because we Jews are\nspeaking Jewish\u201d, and the Jewish is a lot like German so we could understood\naltogether.\u201d And 1t wasn\u2019t -- was like she was saying.",
        "Q: So, you all knew what was happening in Germany but you thought that it wouldn't\nhappen to you in Poland?",
        "A: What happen German, I don't know exactly. Because maybe I know what we read in the\n* National Socialist Party (German); Nazi political party in Germany.\n* Paul von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (1847-1934); German army officer and statesman, president of\nGermany 1925-1934.\n> Yiddish\npapers, but, you know, we couldn't have no radios, no TV\u2019s and the media was not strong\nlike today. So we don't know exactly everything. But one thing I remember is when\nHitler is coming on power, they send out most the Jews from Germany. And the Jews,\nthey come into Poland and lots coming to Warsaw and we was talking with them and\nthey tell us what kind of pogrom was there, you know, with the Kristallnacht and the\nbeating and the -- don't let live the Jews. The Jews have no right, the Jews was second,\neven not the second citizen. They couldn't work. They couldn't have absolute nothing. So\nwe know already there is trouble.",
        "Q: Do you remember the first day of the war or when Poland was occupied, do you\nremember what was happening?",
        "A: When the -- first of all, the Polish people, the Polack, they keep the fight one month, 30\ndays. And this was a very, very badly because we was in Warsaw and I remember it was\nwhen shrapnel -- you know what the shrapnel -- it was maybe two, three windows away\nfrom our apartment. So in the house if you run down, all my mother she prepare for\neverybody, pullover, you know, something to put on clothes. So we run to the shelters.\nSo after maybe one or two hours later we go out. We went back to the apartment and we\neat what we have. We don't have much but we eat everything. And just the second day, I\nthink, they started again and it was fire bombs that fell in the house where we was living\nand everything was burned. And we don't have time to take nothing, nothing, we run out\njust what we have on our back. And everybody -- all these houses, all of Warsaw was\nburning. So we have nowhere to go. That's what I remember and it was on the same street\nit was a bath -- public bath. So we went there. We have a little. We took a little broom\nand my mother she was living, sleeping in the bath tub. That's what I remember. And\nwhen the Germans come in, the first thing what they do they start to give food for the\npeoples, soup and bread. So it was not bad. But after they doesn\u2019t \u2014 they start with the\nJews. No Jew have right to have bread. No Jew have nothing. And sometimes my mother\n-- she was blond, she wasn't very dark and so it was not so easy to recognize her like a\nJew, so she went and have bread. But sometimes, next day or two days later when she go\nagain, some Polack recognize her and they say, \u201cAh there\u2019s a Jew, there is a Jew.\u201d And\nthey throw her out so we didn't have nothing.",
        "Q: So this was in the bath house?",
        "A: That was in the bath house.",
        "Q: And there was Polish people and Jewish people?",
        "A: All together, yeah. But as soon as the German come in, you know, they saw what is all\nthe difference. We were treated a little bit better because from the Jews, but we were\nalways scared to go out because it was not very, very pleasant. Not easy.",
        "Q: How long were you in this facility? Do you remember?",
        "A: I can't tell you exactly how long because--",
        "Q: Days, weeks?",
        "A: It was couple, maybe one or two weeks until we find a shelter very, very far out from\ntown and there we was maybe the whole time until -- this was 1939, and 1939, '40 the\nwinter was very, very hard winter so we stay there until 1t makes 1940. I think 1940. So, I\nwas, I was by Korezak.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you a question and then I want to ask you about the orphanage. When you\nwere in this bath house, wasn't there any feeling of -- I don't know -- camaraderie,\nbetween the Polish people and the Jewish people because, in fact, you were all being\ninvaded by the Germans?",
        "A: Not special, not special. No. Because first of all, I don't know, we was scared. If the\nPolish people was scared from the Germans, I don't know. But it was, there was a\ndistance between the Jewish people and the Polish people because the German they start\nalready -- the Jew. They take away everything from the Jews and they start to talk about\nthe ghetto and they start, you know, every Jew have to have, you know, the Jew shtern\u2019\u00ae.\nSo we -- there was a certain distance between the Polish and the Jews.",
        "Q: Maybe the Polish thought they could protect themselves by separating?",
        "A: You know, it's very hard to tell you, because the Polish people -- I going to tell you just\nonce. The antisemitic by the Polish people -- by the Polish woman there was already\ninject in the breast of from the woman and they give it to the children. But the children\ntook the breast from their mothers and start to give them the milk. They give them the\nhateness for the Jews. And it was all over, all over, every time you have always, you\nknow. There was terrible. Even sometimes you know this day I remember I stay up about\ntwo, three o'clock in the night to make a line to have a piece of bread. And when one\nPolack or somebody see a man what is a Jew, they threw him out. They kicked him out.\nThey beat him.",
        "Q: And yet your early memories were good. Early memories everybody was friendly. It all\nchanged.",
        "A: That doesn't change. And I think nothing change today. I don't think something change\n\u00b0 star (Yiddish).\ntoday.",
        "Q: But what I am saying is when you were young you lived around a lot of Polish people\nand everybody was friends?",
        "A: Yes. Because, you know, everybody was friends because we was young, little one. I was\nvery young. So we don't see the difference but in the moment when we come just to the\nreason, the moment when the brain start to work, they change. They change today\nbecause maybe, like I say, maybe the churches, maybe the priest, maybe they put the\npoison in this brains. Maybe the brainwash you, I don't know what. They always know\nthat they pretend always, \u201cThe Jews they kill Christus -- Jesus Christus.\u201d What I have to\ndo with 2000 years with all this thing?",
        "Q: At what point were you sent to the orphanage and why were you sent there?",
        "A: I was sent to the orphanage because like I say we was poor. It was very hard and this\ntime, it was time when I have to go to school and it was maybe very hard to my mother,\nyou know. So somebody give her the address from this orphanage and she put me there.",
        "Q: Do you remember what year this was?",
        "A: This should be about '35, 1934, '35, maybe '36, in this year.",
        "Q: Can you tell me in a full sentence what that is 1934, 1935 you were sent to the orphanage\nand tell me what it was called?",
        "A: What you mean it was called?",
        "Q: What was the name of this orphanage?",
        "A: This was -- I'm sorry Dom Sierot\u2019. It was Polish this is orphan home for the orphanages\nand this was a private -- not private, but we have to pay. But I think they reach people\nfrom Warsaw who support themselves and this was the hope -- the director -- maybe for\nher was Dr. Janusz Korcezak. His really name is Henry Goldsmith. He was a doctor and\nthey have the Mrs. Wilczynska\u00ae, she was the director too because Dr. Korczak doesn\u2019t\nwas always there. I think he was busy, you know, to collect the money, to collect all the\nthings for us. And he have always an audition on the radio. He talk on the radio once a\nweek, I think.\n\u2019 Orphan home (Polish)\n* Stephania Wilczynska (1886-1942), head teacher and co-director of Korczak\u2019s orphanage.",
        "Q: He was well known?",
        "A: Yeah. And they call him the stary\u2019 doctor, the old doctor. And I remember he took me\nonce with him to the radio and he was -- moment I was I think, in September, October it\nwas cold outside. He talk about the flu, and there was a moment I have to cough and I\nforgot to cough and he say \u201cCough, cough, cough.\u201d And then I did it. He was a very, very\nnice man and we was there 107 children, 56 girls and 51 boys. My number was 46.",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: Bitte\u2019?",
        "Q: About how old were you?",
        "A: About six, seven years.",
        "Q: No, no, how old were you when you went into the orphanage?",
        "A: Seven years, maybe.",
        "Q: Oh, you were young?",
        "A: Yes, yes. They don't took old people because when you were 13, 14 years, you have to\nleave -- to live -- you have to go out because they took somebody else in your place.",
        "Q: Now, did your brothers and sisters go with you to the orphanage?",
        "A: I was alone but sometimes, every Saturday I go home to visit my parents and there, I was\nthere a whole year. But in summertime we have a camp they call Kolonia Rozyczka'' and\nit was a vacation. I'm sorry. So when I come in they took me out from the school the\nChristian school and they send me to the Jewish school, not the Jewish, but it was a\npublic school but it was most Jews was there. That was there. So when we have vacation\nso we went to the kolonia\u2019\u2019 for two months and I have my little brother. So it was hard\nfor me. It was so nice. It was so good that I have food. I have nice bed I have everything.\nHe have to stay home, so I ask, I make questions and they allow him. So I went home and\nhe was in my place for one month.",
        "Q: Was this after you went to the orphanage, or before?",
        "A: In the orphanage.\n* old (Polish)\n'\u00ae please, pardon (Yiddish)\n'' Little Rose Camp (Polish); children\u2019s summer camp connected with Korcezak\u2019s orphanage.\n'? summer camp (Polish)",
        "Q: The school you were talking about, was that part of the orphanage?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: And the other thing I'm confused about, if you don't mind is -- now, you were born in\n1925?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And your father died in, around maybe 1935?",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: You don't remember exactly?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you went to the orphanage after that. I was thinking you would be a couple years\nolder?",
        "A: Maybe.",
        "Q: You don't remember exactly how old you were?",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "Q: Okay. But your parents sent you?",
        "A: My mother, yes.",
        "Q: Can you talk about life in the orphanage?",
        "A: Life in the orphanage, it was very nice. First of all, we, you know, everybody have his\nbed. You have to, like you say, sleeping places for the girls, for the boys, everybody have\nhis own bed. And I think, like I remember this day, it was six, six-thirty in the morning.\nWe have to be washed, clothed and we have a breakfast and everybody have to prepare to\ngo to school. We went to school so we went to different schools. And the school -- I\nremember the first couple years when the first I start from the third degree because I was\nalready-- so after school start one o'clock to six afternoon. So before we have breakfast\nand everybody have to make his bed and we have to clean the beds. And the -- we have\nto make the homeworks, and after we have lunch and then have to be dressed, shoes\nshined and we went to school. And we have some people, some children who start the\nschool at eight o'clock in the morning until one o'clock.",
        "Q: Did you -- was there a certain organization in the orphanage? Did you each have\nresponsibilities or --",
        "A: Yes. Everybody have his responsibilities, they have to take care. First one, the oldest take\ncare the youngsters. So when you arrive about 10 years, 11 years and when a youngster\ncome in, so you take care of him. You teach him. You say the rules for the orphanage,\nyou know. Until a certain time you was responsible for him. If he do something that not\nsupposed to be, you be punished. Not him. But this guy, what was responsible for the\nchild, he was punished. But children thinks it was very, very -- but still -- and you know,\nwe have like supper all together. It was about seven o'clock supper and we could play.\nWe have ping pong. We have a piano and we have lessons every day you could. They\nteach us to play mandolin if you want to or the piano. They teach us Hebrew always\nwhen you want to. Nobody force you to do something. And you know, they have all kind\nof -- wintertime, we went out and we play with winter things and we have, we can go ice\nskating too. So it was very, very nice, very pleasant. But Saturday after dinner everybody\ncould go home to the parent or visit the parent or something like that, and sometimes we\nmake a play in the orphanage and we would invite the parents and they come. We invite\nthe parents and they come to ho... see how the play.",
        "Q: Now, were the people -- the kids in the orphanage -- were they Christian or Jewish?",
        "A: No, no. It was just Jewish.",
        "Q: Just Jewish. What were the ages?",
        "A: The ages were from six to 14; 13, 14 years.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay in there?",
        "A: I was until the war, 1939, even I was longer. When I finished the school they find --\nsummertime and place I was working in an office. The office, the factory they make all\nkind office supplies like pens, like all these things, and I was in the office there and this\nwas summertime because my brother was in kolonia, so it was until 1939, until the\nGermans come in. When the German come in, so the owner from this company they give\nit over to peoples. I think they was swear in or something like that, and they go in. And\nwhen they swear and they go in, every Jew have to go out. We \u2014 I was laid off from\nthere. And at this time, like I say, I went back to the kolonia -- to the camp because in the\nwartime the peoples they steal the beds, and the mattress and the all the extras that we\nhave there. So we call the police and they went with the police, to the houses, and take all\nthe things back. So when the all the people, all the children going back to Warsaw\nbecause they think the school going to start. So we was three or five still there in the\ncamp to take care of that because we have -- it was a very, very big place. So this was\nuntil maybe -- \u2018til 1941. I remember it was, I remember it was a winter there to take care,\nand after the Germans come and they make a ghetto for this camp because there was lots\nof barracks there. They have like sleeping block. Block for the boys, sleeping block for\nthe girls, with a very big dining room. Have a kitchen. We have a very big washroom,\nyou know, to take showers and all this thing. And so Germans come in. They took this\naway and they make a ghetto. Because there was in town is called Wawer, and they took\nall the Jews to put them, and they make a ghetto. And they started again with the killing\nthere and with the shooting. All the things. So I was there a little time.",
        "Q: I'm sorry to stop you, but I want to talk a little bit more about the orphanage before we\ntalk about the ghetto, if you don't mind. So in the orphanage it sounds like you had a\ngood time?",
        "A: Very good time.",
        "Q: Sounds like you had a good time. And tell me a little bit more about Dr. Korczak. What\nwas he like?",
        "A: Dr. Korcezak was a terrific man. He was good. This man was, I can't describe you. He\ndidn't have no hair. He have a little beard. He was a beautiful, good man. He was a\ndoctor. He was a very, very good man, and he kiss everybody. He was so warm -- is very\nhard. Something wonderful, something terrific about this man and I wonder because\nnobody talk about him. They make a movie but is far away from what he was really. He\nwas a doctor -- really, really, really, really, good. He was like more than a father. He was\na father to 107 and maybe \u2014 what do I say -- yes, 107 children -- but you have some\nteachers there, about 120 peoples.",
        "Q: It sounds like he was quite a character. He was going out and getting money. He was all\nover the place. He had Polish friends and Jewish friends?",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I don't think so. I don't know exactly, but I don\u2019t think so. The Polish\npeople, they wouldn't accept him like a Jew because his name is -- Korczak is really\nPolish name -- but his name is, was Henry Goldsmith. This was his really, really, really\nname. And I think he was from a very nice family and he travel very much before the\nwar. He was in Berlin, he was in Austria and even the German, lots of German know\nhim.",
        "Q: How was he able to accomplish all of this?",
        "A: I don't know. I can't tell because unique. He was very, very nice and every time when\nsomebody was sick or what, he was always there. When we need him he was always\nthere.",
        "Q: Do you have any other real distinct memories about him like the radio show?",
        "A: He was -- I remember once, like I say, he went once with him out in Poland and he had\non always his uniform -- because he was major in the army in the Polish Army. So you\nhave the uniform and I tell him, \u201cDoctor, please, why you put the uniform? It's so\ndangerous, it\u2019s so dangerous. Why you don't take them out?\u201d He say, \u201cOh, no, this is my\nuniform. I'm a Polish soldier. I'm going to keep the uniform.\u201d And I remember when we\nwas in the camp, some Polish people, women, come in and ask for the Doctor, \u201cDoctor,\nplease, my child is sick,\u201d or something like that. It doesn't make no question what kind, if\nit's Jew, if it's not Jew. What happened? He took -- I remember he had a little, little bag.\nHe took his little bag. He went to the people and doesn't charge, doesn't take any money.\nDon't take nothing. I don't think so, for this man he was any difference. He was -- he\ndon't think any difference if he\u2019s a Jew, if he\u2019s not a Jew -- a human being, a child. That's\nit.",
        "Q: I understand he wouldn't wear the Jewish star?",
        "A: Bitte?",
        "Q: I understand he wouldn't wear a Jewish star?",
        "A: I don't think so, no. I don\u2019t think so, I don't know if he speak Jewish. He never -- with\nother Jewish, if he speak Jewish, he never speak Jewish. Something like that, he was a\nhuman being. A 150 percent human being. I don't think so you can find men like that\ntoday. He was...",
        "Q: Now, you were there for several years until the war?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then you left, and at that point were any of your brothers and sisters also in the\norphanage?",
        "A: No, no, no. It was just my little brother. He wasn't in the orphanage. It was just in the\nvacation and camp there, but not special. He don't know his name, so they call him\n\u201cMaly\u201d? Icek\u201d -- the \u201cLittle Icek\u201d. Because that's -- he was always one month, because,\nyou know, vacation time, like here, they're vacation took two months and one month I\nwas home and he was there.\n'> Small (Polish).",
        "Q: Now, you didn't really have to leave during the war because the orphanage stayed\ntogether, but were you at an age where you were ready to leave the orphanage?",
        "A: Yes. Just in the wartime in 1939 I was age, you know, to live there, but I couldn't come\nevery day or once, twice a week to eat no supper, the meals with the friends all together\nuntil 1939, until the war. That's when the war, yes, 1940, until the war. So they need help\nbecause the camp was empty. Everything was stolen and the children, they was too\nyoung to go. So they ask me if I would, I would and I say, yes, I -- and there was nothing\nto do there, the school. We have no more school because the Jews, you couldn't go\nnowhere. So I went and I was there and then -- in the camp until the Germans make a\nghetto. And after when they start with all this shooting and all this thing.",
        "Q: So you helped out with the orphanage a little bit when you were older?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you make good friends in the orphanage?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I have very good friends I have even, yes, a little girlfriend -- very nice.\nShe not survive. She go over, over with Korczak to the oven.",
        "Q: Do you remember what your duties were in the orphanage?",
        "A: My duty, yes. My duty was after breakfast I have to go and, you know, we have passages\nbetween the beds, and I have, I think, two passages to clean, with the broom and the floor\nwas polished. That was my job and sometimes we change. So I have to wash the cups in\nthe morning after breakfast, and there was a girl, Ewa Zylberberg, she is no more there.",
        "Q: She was your girlfriend in the orphanage?",
        "A: Yes, young love.",
        "Q: Very young.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did the girls have different jobs than the boys or did everybody --",
        "A: Yes. It depends. They have to, but most of the girls were working in the clothes shop. Not\nthe shop but, you know, like to sew the numbers, and sometimes they have, the socks to\nrepair and to see after our clothes. Something like that.",
        "Q: Everybody had numbers on your clothes?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Everybody.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: Because not to mix them, because I say I could have maybe 10, 11, 12 years and there\nwas a little one who was six years who was maybe short, too high, so everybody have his\nclothes. So when they come from the washing, everybody knows this one was his.\nEverybody know there one was his and there was one was hers -- everybody have a\nnumber and my number was 46. So, you know, if you go to take showers you have to\nchange underwear, so the underwear was there. So I don't want to take somebody else\nbecause I know my number is 46. So I have to take number 46, the socks were 46.\nEverything in the -- everything was marked.",
        "Q: Were there other ways in which the girls and the boys were different in the orphanage?",
        "A: There was girl and boys, yes. There was difference but, you know, we were -- they\nhandled us exactly the same thing. They have tables, you know, the table -- I think we\nwas six children, I think. So there was boys and girls together for the breakfast, for lunch\nor something like that. They was all together. There was no difference.",
        "Q: You just had different jobs?",
        "A: We had different jobs. Even we went to school together, everything. Even in the same\nclass together. We was together but, you know, when it was time to go to bed, that's only\ndifference. That's it.",
        "Q: It sounds like it was a really nice experience.",
        "A: I think it was one of the nice, this time in young. It was the nicest time, the best time in\nmy life -- this time, you know, if you don't have no war. We have everything. We don't\nhave no war. We have everything -- and you can\u2019t imagine -- something is coming like\nholidays. When I say \"holidays\" the Christian holidays. So we have -- we receive\noranges. It was something. You -- this was something in Poland for the war, an orange\nwas something. You can't dream about that. And this coming from Israel, you know, from\nPalestine. This time it was market; Jaffa oranges, bananas, all kind of fruit. Was\nsomething. It was amazing. Nobody can dream about this, in this time and it's as poor\nwho we was.",
        "Q: How was Korczak able to get the money to do all of this?",
        "A: Like I say, this guy, he doesn't rest. He run the whole days and like I say -- there was\nvery rich people in Poland, in Warsaw, and poor ones too. Was Jewish people, and they\nsupport and I think the Jewish organization from Israel to help him, lots of them. Because\nyou know Mrs. Stefa Wilczynska, I think she went to Israel. This was maybe '36 or '37, I\ndon't remember exactly, and the plan was to take all the orphanages, all the children to\nIsrael. But no time. And after, when I was there, you know, when the German come into\nWarsaw, they make a ghetto. How we come in it, I don't know. There I was in kolonia\nbut I know it was very, very big problem. My brothers, my sisters, my mother, she\ndoesn't have food, she doesn\u2019t \u2014 nothing to eat absolute nothing. So when they make the\nghetto in the camp. So I know a man, he was a butcher. So he come to me and say, \u201cYou\nknow what, if you want to make some money, you can earn some money. Like you have\na face nobody can say you a Jew. You take meat. You go to the ghetto. You sell the meat.\nI give you the address, everything and you have some money. You help me, you help\nyourself. You can help your family.\u201d So at certain time every day in the morning, about\nfive o'clock in the morning when the first streetcar pass -- because in the ghetto, Warsaw\nghetto, it was a streetcar passing by the ghetto, but nobody can go down. It pass just the\nghetto and it was from one Christian side to the other. Nobody can see go in, because\nthere was police there and they take care. So I have every day, every day I have my\nshoulder -- I have in back, and I have meat. I don't remember exactly, maybe 25 kilo, 30\nkilo, and I have, a band with the -- and this one I took it. I have it in my pocket. So, he\ntold me, he teach me, he say, \u201c\u201cYou know you go there and when the streetcar, it pass, it\nturn to the second street he slowed down, and this time you go down and you go in the\nhouse. You put on your things and you go, and this and this address. You said it, you\u2019re\ngoing to have it.\u201d But I say, \u201cbut the police!\u201d \u201cSo the police \u2014 don't worry, the police\ngoing to turn his back with the hand behind and you push in some money and doesn't see,\ndoesn't look at you.\u201d It was to every day, every day.",
        "Q: This was the Jewish police or the German police?",
        "A: No, no. Polish police.",
        "Q: Polish police.",
        "A: Every day I go down and it was very -- at home -- that was nothing to eat, nothing, and I\nhad to help them. And this one the of the reasons. That's why I help them I go over this\nmeat.",
        "Q: So you got on the streetcar? You took off your armband and you went out to the Polish\nside to meet with --",
        "A: No. I go out from the camp. I was on the Polish side, so I don't have no band. Off. I went\nto the streetcar. Off. I pay my streetcar and I have to take in correspondence and second\nticket. And when I come in the street and I take the streetcar, the same streetcar, it pass\nthe ghetto from the other side of the ghetto to the Polish side. So I go in and the\npoliceman was there with his hand behind his back, I give him some money. I jump\ndown. I put my armband and I was a Jew and nobody see. And when I sold the meat. I\ngive the meat, I have some money so I could buy something, potatoes or something like\nthat. I took it home. I give them and I go out and I wait exactly the same place. When the\nstreetcar is coming, take off my band, jump on the -- and I was a Polack again. One day\nin this ghetto there was a man, a butcher too, he was killing the cattles so he say, \u201cyou\nknow, I going to give you\u201d -- I remember very, very, well, \u201c25 zlotys.\u201d It was very, very,\nmuch money -- \u201cwhen you bring me my knife.\u201d You know, the man have a special knife\nto kill. So I say, \u201cokay.\u201d You know, young, no brains, I don't see the danger what I going\nto do. So he give me the address and when I go down with my meat, I sold the meat. I go\nto my mother, give her the money. So I go in this place and I think he going give me a\nlittle knife. She give me a knife like that, so I say, \u201cI promise, \u2018I\u2019m going to do it, \u2019'm\ngoing to do it.\u201d I put the knife -- 1t was in box -- I put it in here between my shirt and my\nbody. I put it there and exactly the same thing. Jump on the streetcar. But I don't go in the\nstreetcar. I was just in the front by the driver and when I was there, two Gestapo come\nout. They doesn't talk to me. I don't talk to them. I was quiet do nothing and I went \u2018til\nthe end on the streetcar until the terminus of the streetcar. And I bring him the knife. And\nhe was wondering, \u201cHow you do that?\u201d He give me 25 dollars. You can imagine what\nthis 25 dollars in this days, lots and lots of money. And when they start, you know, with\nthe Jews and they start to make trouble, and they start to take the Jews to the\nconcentration camps from Warsaw. And I say \u201cStop, I have to go.\u201d\nSo I run away and I was marching from Warsaw to Plonsk -- that's about 50 kilometers.\nThere, my older brother was there, my mother was there, and there it doesn't -- was, you\nknow, Poland was split. The Generalgouvernement'* and the annexed territory and there\nwas territory \u2014 so I want to go there, and I was walking two days and when I arrived there\nso. It was okay the first time. There was no ghetto there and they was living not so very\nwell, but okay. We was in little room, like here would be ten peoples, but it was okay and\nI start to work by turps'\u2019. You know what turps? Turps, that's when they take a piece out\nfrom the air and when it was dry the people burn that, like coal. And I was working very,\nvery, very hard when I was working there and I --",
        "Q: Can I stop you a moment?",
        "A: Yes.\n'* German established administrative territory encompassing portions of Poland that were not incorportated into the\nReich after the German invasion of Poland in 1939.\n> turpentine",
        "Q: First of all how are we on tape? I want to make sure we have enough tape. I want to just\ngo back to the ghetto a minute. I'm sort of curious about what it was like in the ghetto and\nhow your life changed and how your family lived and what a day was like?",
        "A: Oh, God.",
        "Q: I know it's not a happy memory.",
        "A: First of all, they took all the Jews.",
        "Q: Can you start out by just saying in the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto, exactly what happened in the ghetto, I can't tell you. I was not very long in\nWarsaw in ghetto, but I know everytime -- when I come there, I see people lying outside\nstarving. The German come in, they laughing, you know, they make all kind of pictures\nfrom the poor peoples and it was is very, very hard to explain you. It's not a life. The\npeople you have -- the people are dead, all dead. You don't have nothing there, nothing\nthere. No food, cold. Peoples was outside begging you for pieces of bread and some, they\nhave children they go in the past the wall, you know, to the Polish side to take something,\nto have some potatoes and when they was chased from the Germans, they kill them, they\nshoot them, I -- you know, I can't explain to you. I can't explain.",
        "Q: Did you ever see this happen?",
        "A: I saw, yes. I remember once like I said, you know, one time I have my meat on my back\nand I have to go, and I couldn't go down because they have a German soldier, German\ngendarme was in the tram. I couldn't go down. I have to go \u2018til the other side. When I\narrived there it was just in cemetery, in Jewish cemetery. To go to the ghetto, I have to\npass the cemetery and I arrive in the middle from the cemetery. They start to shoot. I\nhear, you know with the machine gun, and I was there. So I said, \u201cNow 1s finished.\u201d So,\nyou know in this time there was so many dead people, because by the Jews you have no\nright to make the grave before you have the body at the cemetery and the preparer of the\nholes. One thing that I have to do is I have to jump there and I have lie the whole night\nbetween two deads -- and I hear what the shooting, what the machine guns around and\nthey was walking over my head. So you can imagine. It was the whole night there in this\nhole.",
        "Q: Should we stop and change tape?\nTape #2",
        "Q: All right. So let's just talk a little bit more about the conditions and in the ghetto and the\nstructure of it. What was going on with the Jewish council and the Jewish police?",
        "A: It was the Jewish police to take care and sometimes they make -- they took the peoples go\nout from the ghetto, you know, with the Germans to work. All kind of work. Like\nwintertime to clean the snow, clean the highways and all kind of things like that. And\nsometimes they took them to work, you know, to make the uniforms for the Germans.\nBut there was nobody have the chance to have something and it was very, very, very,\nhard in Warsaw. In the street and every place, you have dead peoples, and peoples\nbegging. It was, you know, horrible to see. Really is very, very hard to explain. It's just --\nI can't believe that I passed there. I saw all this. It's no human nature can see this. You\nknow, I saw lots of things but it was, it's really terrible. I can't understand, you know,\nbecause the Germans they are cultivated people and they couldn't do things like that. I\ncan't understand it. I can\u2019t, I can't understand it.",
        "Q: Were there activities going on? Was there any semblance of real life in the ghetto? Was\nthere music? Was there school?",
        "A: Yes, school. Nobody school, you know, when sometimes you have the teachers, the\nJewish teachers were teaching in the school before the war. They're teaching their own\nchildren. They can do that for nothing. Nobody want to pay. And every time when the\nJewish community, the community when the German make and they\u2019re always -- they\nask for money and they ask the peoples to work and they send the peoples, you know, to\nthe different camps to break the stones to make highways, and all kind of things. Because\nthe Germans, they was the was the worst. The work -- they need the uniforms. They need\neverything, so the Jews was very cheap labor. So they took the peoples and that's it.\nSometimes, I remember, my brother tell me once he was \u2014 they took him in school, in a\nbig school, and they give him brush, teeth brush to wash the floors. And there was the\nladies\u2019 room, they have to take off pants and to clean it. It was terrible.",
        "Q: Now, weren't there also more secretive activities going on? Weren't there youth\norganization and schools and cultural activities?",
        "A: Nothing. You have sometimes, but you need money for clubs. We have some clubs. We\nhave some singers. We have some players. But you need money to get in. Where you\ngoing to take the money?",
        "Q: So there wasn't so much?",
        "A: There was nothing, most of nothing. It was very hard for the living, very hard. And after\nthey start to evacuate the ghetto, to take to Majdanek, to Treblinka, and the peoples they\nstart to know they kill these people. So it was the ghetto uprising. Maybe you remember.\nMaybe you hear about that. It was too something terrible and this people inside, they\nbegging outside they ask to help. They ask the Russian, they a and the American, they\nask the German. I think the English to help to send some weapons, send some\nammunition. Nothing is coming, absolute nothing, nothing, nothing. So what they do?\nThey kill out -- they killed everybody and they burn. The whole ghetto was destroyed.\nEverything was destroyed.",
        "Q: But there were youth organizations that were involved in the resistance there?",
        "A: The youth organizations doesn\u2019t help us with absolute nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,\nnothing.",
        "Q: There was --",
        "A: They couldn't help.",
        "Q: It didn't work, but there was resistance?",
        "A: There was Resistance, yes, and the underground too, but the underground was from the\nPolish people, and some people, some Jews, they was escaped from the ghetto, escape\nfrom the uprising. They went to the partisans, you know. And that's all, I think.",
        "Q: Well, there was also resistance within the ghetto?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: There was also resistance effort inside the ghetto?",
        "A: Inside the ghetto, but not in this time. It was when they start to evacuate this ghetto\nbecause nobody, nobody can imagine they going to send peoples -- they going to burn\ntheir whole family. They are going to kill their whole family, and the killing going on and\ngoing on and going on, until they come, until to Warsaw. There was the uprising, but\nwhat could they help? They had nothing, no rifles, no absolute nothing. They have little\nbit, but absolute nothing.",
        "Q: Now, I think we were talking about this off camera, so I just want to make sure you say\nthis for the record, that where was your family and where were you at this point?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: I just want you to say what you told me for the record, which was essentially, that your\nfamily was in the ghetto, you, one of the youngest, were out doing things. How did all of\nthis happen?",
        "A: You know, when we was in shelter after, when the Germans come in, and because the\napartment we was living was burned up. We had absolute nothing. So we went to the\nbath house and we find a shelter, but when the Germans come in we have to move from\nthere to the ghetto. I was with Korczak at this time. This was in 1940, '41, I think.",
        "Q: You need to explain to us that you were no longer really in the orphanage at this point.\nYou were at --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You were at the summer camp?",
        "A: At this time I was -- this was in summer. I think in summertime they move from Warsaw\nto the camp. And they ask me, too, if I want to go to the camp. I say, \u201cyeah,\u201d because I\ndidn\u2019t have nothing to do there, and they start the ghetto in Warsaw. All the Jews have to\ngo to the ghetto \u2014 towards the ghetto, and this time even my mother say, \u201cWhat you\ngoing to do here? Go to camp.\u201d I went to camp and how to come to the ghetto, I don't\nknow. I know once, you know, they give me the address. I knew they was in the ghetto\nand there was very, very bad situation. Very bad situation. They was hungry. They have\nnothing to eat, and \u201cthis,\u201d I decide \u201cthis time.\u201d So I have possibility to help them and this\nwas my opportunity to help them, risk my life to help them.",
        "Q: And this was because you were outside of the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: But you moved pretty freely between the ghetto and outside the ghetto. You seemed to\nget back and forth pretty well.",
        "A: Yes. I have to go and I was feeling very angry because I saw the Polish people, the Polish\nboys in my age they running free. They eating. They have everything, and I have to\nhiding myself all over. Take care. Doesn't talk, doesn't speak, doesn't go nowhere. You\nkeep yourself. You just -- you know, because don\u2019t forget one thing, \u201cYou a Jew, you a\nJew, you don\u2019t have no right to live.\u201d",
        "Q: Did you pretend you weren't a Jew?",
        "A: I pretend I wasn't a Jew, but one thing I know. I say to myself, \u201cIf this was finished, I\ndon't want to be any more a Jew. I don't know why they hate me. I don't do nothing. I\ncan't understand. I don't want to -- I want to be free. I want to eat. I want a piece of bread\nlike everybody. I don't want to hate you.\u201d This was in my mind.",
        "Q: This is while you were still a boy before the camps?",
        "A: Before the concentration camp -- maybe not. When I escaped from Warsaw, I went, you\nknow, to my family. There I know there was Jew. It was hard for me too, sometimes I\nthink about not to be Jew, but I born a Jew, I couldn't help it.",
        "Q: So when you were helping your family, they were in the ghetto. You were on the outside.\nWhen you were on the outside, did you talk to people, did you pretend you weren't a\nJew?",
        "A: I don't talk to nobody. I was scared, very scared, you know. Each time, if somebody\nrecognize me or what, because first of all, with the meat. Second, if a Jew, they kill me --\nthey kill me one hundred per cent. Not scared \u2014 yes, I was scared but it was, I say, look,\nlike what they can do to me? Kill me, that\u2019s it. Not kill, but hang me? That's it, you know.\nBecause they say if you\u2019re a Jew, a bullet too expensive. I couldn't help.",
        "Q: Did you ever spend much time in the Warsaw ghetto?",
        "A: Every time a couple hours, but really long time, no.",
        "Q: Was there any sort of confinement or ghetto up at Rose Camp'*?",
        "A: No. I don't think so. One thing, I was very happy when I went out. I feel a little bit, I'm\nfree a little bit, but outside. But inside, you know, my heart was beating very, very --\nevery time when I was in gendarme -- in the German gendarme I said, \u201cOh! You finished,\nyou finished.\u201d Like the same thing when I have the knife in my back and why I go on this\nstreetcar. Just the two Gestapo come in, and I don't want to say they followed me, but in\nthe way \u2014 they went in the same way that I was. Believe me, you know, if I'm today alive,\nI don't have a heart attack this time, oh, I was very, very strong. So when I come in I give\nhim this knife. I say to myself, \u201cIf I can do that, I can do something else.\u201d",
        "Q: I thought you said there was a ghetto up at the camp also.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. So I was there and so, you know, they have some peoples in the ghetto, but\n'\u00ae Kolonia Rozyczka\nthey have family in Warsaw and they was young peoples, and they ask me if I want to\nbring them to the ghetto. And I say, \u201cLook, I can\u2019t go.\u201d So I go with this peoples. They\npay me but it doesn't pay very much. They pay me just, you know, they pay me just a\ndinner or something like just for survival, but nothing special. I make it because I can\nhelp. But nothing special. But to understand this, that the shooting and the killing there\nand my family was already dead. As I say, \u201cStop, is enough, you have to run away from\nhere.\u201d So I go away and, you know, it was about 70 kilometers. I went there and I was\nwandering two days without food, because when I come on the border, was -- on one side\nwas the Polish police, and on the other side was the German police and, \u201cHalt, where are\nyou going?\u201d \u201cI go working to the farm to keep the potatoes,\u201d because it was not me\nalone, but some Polish people did traveling, too. So I listen to him. I say, \u201cI go for the\npotato.\u201d So, \u201cI go for the potato\u201d and I was a young boy, so they let me pass. And I have\nsome couple money. They took away the money but I don't care. I went, and we have to\npass a bridge and I say, just two Germans gendarmes. And they go just to me, and I say\n\u201cAy, ay, two gendarmes, it\u2019s finished with you.\u201d But behind me was an old woman with a\nlittle boy and they stopped the woman, and I pass.\nAnd I come on the road and it was two gendarmes and they threw out a family from this\nhouse -- maybe they want to take the house -- and they threw out and they say \u201cHey,\ncome here.\u201d And they say, \u201chelp,\u201d and I help these people to put on the wagon. And I\nremember it, was a bread, a big, big bread and the bread fell down and the hard side fell\ndown. So I take the hard side, I put it in my jacket and -- because eight days I don\u2019t eat\nno piece of bread -- and I help them, but this piece I hide for me. And I sit on the wagon\nand they bring me to a little point because they turn and I have to go straight and I go\nstraight. And I go to the farm and I ask, \u201cMaybe you have place to sleep?\u201d So it's an old\nfarm. They say, \u201cLook, I have one place but here you can sleep -- there is a lady laying in\nbed -- 1f you want.\u201d So the lady in one side and I was on the other side. The whole night I\neat this bread. The next day, in the morning, I say, \u201coff.\u201d I go to the town and I was in the\nfamily. But in certain time the peoples from this town, they need papers. I don't have no\npapers and the paper was, you know, the fingerprint and this one is the Bloody Sunday.\nThe Gestapo come in, 1n this town and they throw out -- everybody have to go out, and\nthey start to control the papers. I don't have no papers. My brother doesn't have papers. If\nhe don't have no papers, so they have to start to hit the stakes over the head, over the\nback, all over. Because if you don't have paper, you have to go on this side. If you are\ngoing to see my brother \u2014 he has here, on his lip, was open from hitting him.",
        "Q: This is the town of Plonsk,",
        "A: Plonsk, yes. And they put us and they going to ask you for the bloody Sunday. I'm going\nto tell you about this. They put everyone on a field. I don't know, maybe a thousand\npeoples, on one field and we stay there two nights, one night or two nights, I don't\nremember. And they put us in a camp. They will call Pomiechowek and this was a really\ndeath camp. And there we was, I think, six week. I can't explain the trouble what they\nhave there. It was those barracks, stone barracks and was so many peoples. We have to\nlay down on the floors like the herring, you know, in the tins. If one want to turn,\neverybody have to turn. Soon it was dark until morning. You have to stay there. It was\nvery, very hard, but one thing it was not German, I think, 1t was Germans but it was the\nSA. Maybe you hear about SA -- Sturmabteilung'\u2019 -- that's when the Germans with war,\nthe brown shirts and with the Hakenkreuz'\u00ae. It was very, very bad peoples. There was,\nthere was Volksdeutsche'\u201d, it was most of the Polacks, but there was maybe Germans, I\ndon't know what kind. It was very, very bad and they was very bad peoples. They hit us.\nWe don't have no food. And I can't explain what kind of trouble what -- I don't know how\nwe survived there. There was hundred and hundred of people and, you know, we couldn't\nhave no washroom, nothing. So they make a grave in hole with a stake and everybody,\nwomen, men all together, we have to go there, if we need to go. And sometimes a passing\nGerman push in. I can't explain. And was always one, he pass in the barrack and tell,\n\u201cYou stay up!\u201d When you stay up is okay. When you kind of stay up so fast, so he have,\n\u201cYou sick. Take out to kill.\u2019 And they shoot every day, every day, you hear the guns.\nThey shoot these people something terrible. And my little brother, Erwin he was there,\nbut he escaped. And how I come out from there, I don't know. I don't know, I don\u2019t\nremember. I know once my brother told me I was sick. I had typhus and all these people\nthat have typhus they have to be killed. And I remember one time I was laying on the\noutside to wait until they going to shoot me. So I know once my brother, the oldest one,\ncome and take me on his shoulder and put me in a wagon. They run away and they pass,\nand we have to go, they send us back to Warsaw to the ghetto. Before coming to Warsaw\nto the pass the, the front, they make a big fire, and all these people have to pass this fire.\nThe other side there was the ghetto, the free, but we have to pass this fire. We have so\nmany -- you feel it. You pass on the people that first down. They couldn't survive.",
        "Q: You went through the fire?",
        "A: Through the fire.",
        "Q: It was a big fire?",
        "A: Was a big fire and my brother, I don't remember, but my brother told me because we\npass. I know I have smell the burn, smell the burn.",
        "Q: So you had to walk through this fire to get to the ghetto?",
        "A: Walk the fire, pass the fire to go in the ghetto, back to the Warsaw ghetto. And when we\narrived in the Warsaw ghetto, I don't remember exactly what happened, but once I was\n'\u201d storm troopers (German)\n'S Swastika (German)\n\u201d ethnic German (German)\nlaying on the floor, and I was in a hospital and they wash myself and they put me in a bed\nin the hospital. And there was maybe one or two days and I start to cry, because they put\nsomebody in the bed with me. And so there was a nurse come in and she ask me, \u201cWhy\nyou crying?\u201d So I say, \u201cI don't know, they put somebody in maybe he have typhus. I\u2019m\ngoing to have too.\u201d So she say, \u201cWhat you think what are?\u201d and they let me there a\ncouple days. A couple days, maybe one week, and when I was already health more, so I\nwent out and I remember it was just a wagon come in with stones. The men, they ask me,\n\u201cHey, you want to help me to put down the stones?\u201d I say, \u201cyes.\u201d They give me 50 cent\nand I buy pickle, a sour pickle. And I found my brother. We don't have no place to go.\nWe don't have no place to sleep. We don't have no money. Absolute nothing. So my\nbrother told me, \u201cWhat you going to do?\u201d So, you know, in Poland in the houses there\nwas the stoves and they have in the ovens, they have the doors. There was like a cup and\nthe houses that was destroyed. So we took that and we sold it. We have some money. We\npay a guy \u2014 and we go out from the ghetto and we have just enough to pay to buy a\nbread, because we want to go back to the same town where my mother and my sister.",
        "Q: And this is Plonsk?",
        "A: Yeah. And we have just enough money to buy a bread, but from there we have to pass a\nbridge to the station and from the station we have to take a little train to, I don't\nremember. And this town a little bit closer to Plonsk. So we go to the, into the train. We\nhave already tickets -- no. There was -- we was waiting outside because the train --\nsomebody come I don't know, it was a Polack, I don't remember, a woman or a man \u2014 and\nshe say, \u201cDon't go in because they can recognize you, you a Jew and they going to send\nyou back or they going to arrest you.\u201d So I say, \u201cBut we want to go.\u201d So he or she, I\ndon\u2019t remember, \u201cGive me your money. I will go buy tickets.\u201d So we give him the money\nand he buy tickets for us and we have the tickets. We go in the train. We sit on the train\nand this train start to go. So he\u2019s coming, the control man for the ticket, so he looks, \u201cAre\nyou Jews? I going to call the Gestapo.\u201d So I start to cry, \u201cWhy you going to call the\nGestapo? We don't do nothing. We want to go.\u201d \u201cNo, no, you Jews. You don't have the\nright to go. You don't have the right to be here.\u201d So I say, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d So he say,\n\u201cPay me.\u201d So I say, \u201cWhat can I pay you? We don't have no money. We don\u2019t have\nnothing.\u201d One thing my brother say, \u201cMaybe you going to give him a gown.\u201d I remember\nI had a gown for my sister, a nightgown. So I tell him, \u201cLook, I have a nightgown. If you\nwant to, I give you the nightgown.\u201d He said, \u201cyes.\u201d I have to go to the end train, take out\nthe nightgown and give him the nightgown. So, he let us go. So we went a couple miles\nand we go down. We don't have no money. We don't have nothing to eat. We have to\nlive. We have to do something. So actually, you know what, we go here we go begging.\nSo I took to the house and somebody give us some beets. So we have beets. We eat the\nbeets and we sleep outside. And we stay and we go again, and they stay and we go again.\nThis time we walking again. We want to go to this town and it's very hard. It's not so\neasy, SO --",
        "Q: You\u2019re walking to this town?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How far is it?",
        "A: About 70 kilometers and we was running with the train, maybe 10 or 15 kilometers. But\nthere was somebody. He make travel past the peoples. So we ask him, maybe he want to\ntravel, to help us to travel. So he say, \u201cYes, but you have to pay me.\u201d But we have\nnothing. So I remember when I was in camp I receive a pair of boots from UNRRA\u201d or\nthe Jewish Committee*\u2019 -- I don't remember. So I say, \u201cYou know, that I have boots. I\ncan give you -- you take my boots.\u201d And we past there. And we was together certain time\nand after they took us to the concentration camp, so they start there with the\nconcentration camp. Exactly the same thing, you know.",
        "Q: Now this Bloody Sunday in Plonsk, going back a little bit. Did this take place in a lot of\ntowns at the same time?",
        "A: I don't know. I know it take place -- one second, I think it take 1n two or three places in\nPlonsk and it was a couple kilometers was in town, the same thing, the same thing. That\u2019s\nthe Bloody Sunday.",
        "Q: Is it unusual that you went from ghetto to a camp then back to the ghetto? Is that\nunusual?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Because generally when the people leave the ghetto they leave for good, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You were very resourceful.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: You were very resourceful.",
        "A: What can I do? I have to. I can't help. And then after when we was the last ghetto the last\ntime. So, you know, the propaganda was from the German and they say, \u201cDon't worry.\nThe oldest people, your old people, you're going to work.\u201d This was the propaganda.\n** United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\n*! American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\n\u201cTook what you can, warm clothes most important. Took it to a Jew and you're going to\nwork, okay? The youngest people, they are going to work. The older people they're going\nto keep the children and the household.\u201d So this was the reason. Most the Jewish people,\nthey go, but nobody can imagine -- but when, you know, they going die it was already\ntoo late. They're already there. They couldn't help. So first I know when they start to send\ntickets. \u201cThis family, this family, this family.\u201d",
        "Q: I'm sorry. Were you at this point?",
        "A: In Plonsk. Now, I told you Warsaw was already liquidated. It wasn't completely\nliquidated but is started.",
        "Q: What year do you think this was?",
        "A: This was 1941, 1942.",
        "Q: But was Warsaw ghetto wasn't liquidated that early, I don't think.",
        "A: They start, I think, but the uprising was 1n, I think --",
        "Q: '43?",
        "A: '43. So they start -- first of all, in Warsaw, there was a big ghetto. There was lots of\npeople and there lots of Jews was working for the Germans and the factories, like the\ntailors for the uniform. And so this when they start already to evacuate.",
        "Q: To evacuate?",
        "A: And to evacuate it. And first one -- the policy from the Germans they say, \u201cWhy do we\nhave to kill them? They are going to kill themselves.\u201d And that's true. The people\nstarving on the streets, no food. In the wintertime the people was freezing completely,\ndead freezing, dead. They have nothing. So they don't care. So they just to help so they\nevacuated to Treblinka. And Treblinka, soon they come in and the older people, the\nwoman, the older men and children, they put them on the trucks. The trucks come into\nthe crematorium to say, \u201cYou go to bath. You going to take a shower.\u201d But the shower is\ngas. That's it. And there in Plonsk they start to send people to get this family and this\nfamily and that family. They have to be at this time and that time, and that time they have\nto be at the station. On the grand Platz\u201d was the place they have to be there. At this time\nmy mother and the younger brother and the two sisters -- my sisters receive the paper.\nMy brother and I were supposed to stay there, but -- and they took them back. So after,\n** plaza (German)\nyou know, he\u2019s coming, an officer and he say, \u201cWho want to go to have place? Who want\nto go?\u201d So, I say to my brother, \u201cWhat they going to do here?\u201d The ghetto was -- this\ntown was three-quarter empty. \u201cWhat we going to do? Come, we're going to work. Come\nwe're going, too.\u201d So we going and this was when the family was together. My mother,\nsister, my little brother was together until they send us to Auschwitz and this took, I\nthink, three or four days just traveling.",
        "Q: What was it like on that train ride?",
        "A: We was packed. Peoples was crying, you know, packed. No food, no water. Absolute\nnothing. But the one chance it was in, I think, 1n fall, so it doesn\u2019t was very hot. So you\ndon't feel this so thirsty like in summertime and that helped, a lot. So we arrived, I\nremember we arrived in Auschwitz. It was at night or very early in the morning, and\nwhen we go out from the trains they start to beating and to shoot. So I say to my brother,\nI say, \u201cCome, we have to go fast so we don't be beat.\u201d So we was all together and he is\ncoming, the German, and they start, \u201cMen, and women on the other side.\u201d",
        "Q: I'm sorry, may I stop you? I want to hear a little bit more about the trip on the train. It\ntook several days. Did you know where you were going?",
        "A: No, no. We know we want to go to work. And when we went in the train, so, I think, I\nwas young, but I think peoples in mind couldn't imagine this finish. We go to death.",
        "Q: Had you had any information on the camps?",
        "A: No, we didn't have -- like I say nothing. They say always, \u201cDon't worry. Everything be\nfine. You go to work.\u201d But when we was on the train, the train was blocked, nobody can\nopen. But now it was too late. But for me, I don\u2019t know, I couldn't believe, could happen\nthings like that. So I say to myself, \u201cThey told us, we going to work, okay? We're going\nto work.\u201d But who couldn't believe from, we know. Every day the German was a very\npolite people. The German was very [unintelligible] people. Who couldn't imagine. They\nimagine and kill machine like that. It's impossible. But then we go to -- when we arrive in\nAuschwitz and they separate men and women, children with women. So I say, \u201cOh, this\nsmell not good.\u201d And coming Mengele\u201d and he come in and he start, \u201cMen\u201d -- all like\nthe young men, like I and my brother, healthy, from the regular to the bigger \u2014 so \u201cright.\u201d\n\u201cLeft\u201d and my little brother have to go the women. And like I say, I was feel like\nsomething wrong. So we was there and we was the first of the first, because I say, always\nyou have to be careful not to be beaten. If not, they kill you with stakes, with pipes, with\nrubber, with all this thing? So I he come and, you know, the German was like that. He\nwas tall. He jumped between his legs and come in my side, and I was there with a friend -\n> Josef Mengele (1911-19787), German doctor and SS officer.\n- my, my friend live today, is in Toronto-- they lift him little bit and he started to look,\nstart to -- it's too late. They don't see him and we was together.",
        "Q: So you were able to have your little brother come with you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, how did you know this was Dr. Mengele?",
        "A: I recognize him after because he came to our camp. I saw him many time because when I\nwas already in camp, they make selection, you know, about selection. Yeah, the one have\nto die. The one have to go to the gas chamber. So we have to unclothed, take out the\nclothes and we have to pass like in barrack and the barrack was -- it doors. There was two\ndoors. One there was no the block, the chief block and they have to get the prisoners first\nin the second, so it was to the -- so we have to go out from one door and down, and\nMengele was there and we pass by him and he look at you, and the chief on the block,\nyou have -- a card -- you don't have no names. We have just a number and he have the\ncard, you know, and we pass. So I know. I see him many times and peoples out there,\nthey know him before, \u201cthis one is Dr. Mengele,\u201d and so...",
        "Q: So you got off the train and there was a lot of shouting?",
        "A: A lot of shouting and separation and crying and all kind of things. And after you pull\ntogether and after we went on march to Auschwitz and went into concentration camp.\nFrom the station in Auschwitz we went to concentration. The first thing that we saw, you\nknow, they bring us just on the wires, electrified wire, doubled wires, and we saw some\npeople hanging on, so he say, \u201cYou see that? In case somebody want to escape, he going\nto have exactly the same thing.\u201d So they put us, you know -- first, there was outside many\ncouple hours. After we have to take off our clothes. We went to the barber to cut the hair\ncompletely, and showers. After the showers we have to go to the room. And they make\nthe numbers, and they made the numbers, you know, the numbers with little point and\nthey, I don't know what with, a pen or something like that. And they make the numbers.",
        "Q: Did it hurt?",
        "A: Oh, yes. But a couple days later it was okay.",
        "Q: Did you still think you were going to work?",
        "A: To work?",
        "Q: Did you still think the reason you were going there was just to work?",
        "A: At this time, no. At this time I thought I was finished. This time I was finished and the\npeoples, you know, because it was -- already people was prisoners in Auschwitz and this\nI always say, \u201cDon't think you go some place to work. Once you can go, you see the\nchimney there?\u201d We saw the chimney -- the smell, the smell. \u201cThis what I told you. See\nthe chimney? That's where the crematorium.\u201d The first time, I didn't know what he mean\nand he, \u201cburn the people.\u201d And so I ask, \u201cBurn alive?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, no, no. First,\nall the people go in the gas chamber and from the gas chamber they go in there.\u201d",
        "Q: Now what year was that?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: What year do you think this was?",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: Do you think this was about 19--",
        "A: What year? I'm sorry. It was beginning '42, I think, beginning '42. Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So after you're showered then you're tattooed and you're with your brothers?",
        "A: The two brothers, yes. And we still together. No food, nothing. And we have to go to the\ntailor room with the numbers and they give us numbers to put on. They give us the\nuniform. Some uniform is too long, too short, and they took away the shoes. They give\nyou some wood shoes, and here was some stuff, tissue, and wood shoes, they are very,\nvery hard to walk. And one moment we lose my brother, the older one. The little one is\nstill with me. And we was there in Auschwitz about three days, I don't remember exactly\nhow long. It always was the same. We have to go to tailor. You have to put your number\non your pant and on your jacket, and they took us to Buna I.G. Farben district. And this\nwas about three kilometers from Auschwitz. So we go there. It was, I think, at night. I\ndon't remember exactly because we have to pass the town in Auschwitz. Maybe he\ndoesn't want the people to see the prisoners. I don't know exactly. And there we go to\nBuna there. We arrive there and we went to quarantine.",
        "Q: What was that?",
        "A: Quarantine.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: Quarantine. They think maybe we are sick or we have some typhus or something like\nthat. So if somebody going to be sick, they have to kill all the peoples. So we was there\nsix week. It was very, very bad. Every day we have to make some exercise. Every day it\nwas the same thing. The hanging and killing and beating and every day. Sometimes, you\nknow, they hang us with the hands in the back and they hang us just like that. And, you\nknow, who was the chief, it was the murder -- German murder. No one else but the\nmurderers. But the Germans, they was maybe condemned to death. The place to kill\nthem, they put them in concentration camp and it was the chief of the Jew, from the\nJewish Haftlinger**. And this was six weeks there, and after six week, we have to go to\nwork. They send us off and we went to the camp where all the peoples. And maybe this\ntime the whole camp was maybe six, 800 people. And we when there just to build this\nconcentration camp, and we start to work there and we make the wire and the barracks,\nbecause every time when the camp was ready, they was coming always new prisoners\nfrom all the countries. From Poland, from Belgium, from Czechoslovakia, from all over,\nall over. And then in the end, I think there was about 15 or 18,000 prisoners there in this\ncamp. And there was a, maybe you read about the I.G. Farben industry, and they have a\nfactory. They make all for the war. They make ammunition. They make even gasoline for\nthe planes.",
        "Q: Wasn't this a synthetic rubber plant?",
        "A: It was a plant.",
        "Q: For rubber?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: For rubber?",
        "A: No you take -- some peoples was working you know in the coal mine. So from the coals,\nthey take out and make the gasoline and they make all the things, and we build it all\ntogether. And it was exactly the same thing. And after, they bring over there maybe, you\nknow -- in the end it was in this I.G. Farben maybe one million people was working\nthere. All kind of nationality you can imagine. Even the war prisoners from Americans,\nEnglish peoples, French peoples, all of the soldiers that was taking --",
        "Q: How long did it take you to do this construction, do you remember\u2019?\n** Prisoner (German)",
        "A: We work always. The construction take about two, three years to build up everything,\nthat the kind of work. And it was very, very hard. Every day we lose lots and lots of\npeoples dying there, by working very hard job. Very hard labor -- very hard job. You\nhave to stay up about five o'clock in the morning and it was Appellplatz\u201d\u2019, cold winter.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the Appell\u201d\u00b0?",
        "A: It was a very, very big place and there was the barracks, and in each barracks was the --\ndepends, 100, 150 men and we have to go up, you know, in the morning. Sometimes they\ngive you a little bit of coffee, water, and you have to go to the Appell.",
        "Q: What time was this?",
        "A: They count so many, so many. They have to. They know exactly how many peoples. And\nit was a block -- block one to 53. I don't remember. And each block you have so many, so\nmany peoples, and so we have to stay to five and they count every block in the morning,\nso much and so many, and they look on the list. If exactly number people what there are,\neven dead. Even somebody die, we have to take him out, you know, to -- he count like\nprisoner. It was very hard in the beginning. I was \u2014 you know first, I don't understand\nGerman at this time and they talk always German. And like soldiers, so in the morning\nwhen the German pass, so you know, they give orders the \u201cMiitzen ab!\u201d\u201d\u201d -- that mean\ntake off your. And first of all, you have to be straight out, it was two words, it was very\nhard to understand for me, \u201crichtet euch!\u201d*> You have to be, stay nicely, and you -- after\nyou say, you can stay. Just like that and this -- I was mixing up. I make always upside\ndown. So you can imagine. They beat me so much until in the end I understand already\nwhat they mean.",
        "Q: Why was the Appell so awful?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: Why was role call so --",
        "A: Well, you know to take respect for the SS.",
        "Q: But why did people think this was such a terrible thing?",
        "A: They was the rules. Like you say, because Jews don't have right to live. The all day, you\n* roll call grounds (German)\n*\u00b0 roll call (German).\n*7 Hats off! (German)\n*\u00ae Straighten up! (German)\nlisten, you hear, just what; \u201cIhr verfluchte Jude,\u2019 dirty Jew, you Christus, you murder,\u201d\nand all kind of things. I can't remember all the things, but in the end they say always, you\ndon't hear about, we was used to that. Okay. You talk because maybe in an hour they\ngoing to shoot us. Maybe in an hour we going to be dead. So we don't care about that.\nWe never, never, never one minute never think about survive. And my, my policy, and I\nsay always, \u201cI have to do all mine better. I have to try to survive.\u201d And we was this\nstruggling there was until January 18, January 1945 and 18 and 17, January, so we start\nalready, we listen already, you know, the bombardment. So we say you, \u201cOh, oh,\nsomething's wrong.\u201d and before you -- yes -- before you know, it was already alarm, fleet\nalarm the bomb, the American flyers coming and the Russian coming at night, American\nday. And was all day, you know, they destroy completely, the I.G. Farben. But the\ncrematorium and the gas chamber, they never destroy because Churchill\u00b0\u201d say this one is\nnot a military object.",
        "Q: Let me see, how we are doing on tape?",
        "A: The what.",
        "Q: I have to check on the tape.",
        "A: So maybe I don't have to say that.",
        "Q: No, no that's okay. Let's get back to the building part. Do you remember how you felt\nabout the work you were doing?",
        "A: Yes. We have all kind of work. First one was the old building was in concrete, okay. And\nI remember it was, trains come in with stones and sand because 1s not like today with the\nbig trucks with the mixer. We have to make ourselves, so my job was to put on the\nwagon stones. So much, so much stones, and so much, so much sand and there was two\nof them. We have to push the wagon to the machine. We have to turn the machine and to\nput the stones with the sand in a mixer. Not a mixer, but it was in back in big box and the\nguy what was working the machine was a German guy. He put the cement and he lift this\nin the machine and they mix it. On the side was again two peoples like we was and the\ncement, the concrete fall in and we have to go with them to the building to the builders\nthat build and -- to put like today, you know, the concrete fall down and they make it. It\nwas a very, very hard job. This was my job, my job, and we have to go fast and\nsometimes the cement, they use very much cement and sometimes cement is coming, you\n\u00bb\u00b0 you damn Jew (German)\n*\u00b0 Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965); British statesman and author who served as Prime Minister during the\nSecond World War.\nknow, with trains. The same thing, except they coming at night at this time.\nSo, what do we hear, \u201cJuden raus\u2019\u2019,\u201d where we have to out from the block and five they\ncount so much, so much, and we have to go to take out the cement from the trains, from\nthe wagons. And I was, this time I was maybe, I don't remember, maybe 16 years, 15, 16\nyears and you have to, you know, put on your shoulder in back of cement sack, and it was\nover 100 pounds. And you have to run with that and sometimes when the Germans when\nthe SS, they outside they start, \u201cschnell, schnell, schnell\u2019\u201d.\u201d They want to go home so\nthey put two and you can't run, so they hit us with the rifles. And one German, he hit\nmany, many times and he smashed my kidney, and they have to take out the kidney. So I\nhave just one kidney. But what can you do? I couldn't say nothing because if somebody\ndoesn't listen, if somebody fall down with \u2014 so they call \u201cHey, take him.\u201d If not, if he\ndoesn't want to, so he shoot him on the spot. You have them carried to the camp dead. So\nwhat -- I couldn't do nothing.",
        "Q: This is probably a strange question, but when they took out your kidney, was there any\nrelief that you were in a hospital for a few days?",
        "A: But, no the kidney was removed after the war.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But, you know, I was suffering from the kidney in camp, but I was scared to go to the\ndoctor at the camp because they send me to the gas chamber. But this one was in the\nbeginning. But after -- so when you are already an old prisoner, you know a little bit the\nrules. So I couldn't manage to not go to this work first of all. Second one, you know, the\ncamp was already built and the buildings was already built so, you know, we don't make\nany cement. But in this time they start to make like professionals work. Electricians,\ncarpenters, painting, because all everything have to be paint and you -- they make some\npeoples -- they have to work for the -- to put on the Skelett\u00ae\u2019, you know, for the building\nthat\u2019s from the ironwork, you know, the big things. So, you know, it was very, very hard,\nbut we don't have to. We don't have to carry the cement, all this thing and first of all, and\nsecond, I was already an old prisoner so I know this rule. So we can manage, you know,\nto not to work so hard. So I manage to be an electrician.",
        "Q: Okay. I have got to stop you because I think we're out of tape. We'll pick up when you\nbecome an electrician.\n*! Jews, out! (German)\n** quickly! hurry! (German)\n*> framework (German)\nTape #3",
        "Q: When we stopped we were talking about your work --",
        "A: Yeah, by the cement. When I went it was already a longer, little bit longer then camp. So\nwe Start to know the rules first of all. Second one, when I was 79,000 but at this time,\nafter -- first of all, when the building was already finished. We was--",
        "Q: Now which building was this?",
        "A: Any kind of building. There was many buildings and they start to bring in from the east\nlike civil peoples. [Technical conversation] So -- and this time, this was maybe two years\nafter, maybe, they start to bring in all kind of peoples Ostarbeiter**. That mean the people\nfrom east, like the French workers from Belgium, civilian workers. They was going in\nfreiwillig\u2019\u2019. That mean they go for themselves because they make big propaganda \u201cCome\nto work for Germany. You going to be fine. You going to be good.\u201d And the same thing\nwas from Poland, from France, from Belgium, from the Russian, from Ukraine, from all\nover, all over Europe and this Buna works and this Buna I.G. Farben industry they make\nwas at least one million of workers. We was in the concentration camp already, I don't\nknow exactly, maybe 12 or 15,000, but you have and -- after this coming all the prisoners\nfrom war, from the English people, the American soldiers, the French sol-- you know\nthey -- what was the prisoner from the war. There was -- they have on the back marked\n\u201cpy\u201d prisoner of war. There was two there so, you know, this work, it was already -- I\ndon't want to easy, but it was a little bit easy. And at this time I was already an old\nprisoner so I know the rules. So I don't want to work. It's too hard and I think sometimes\nin my mind I say myself, \u201cThe world have to finish once. Maybe, we going to be free or\nmaybe we going to be dead.\u201d So I say, \u201cI have to try to survive long as I can so I try not\nto work too much.\u201d And I become in a Kommando\u201d\u2019. A Kommando, that mean every\nprisoner was to the Kommando, and Kommando does what kind of work? Some people\nwas electricians, painters, was builders, was carpenters and I was younger this time, so I\ndon't have no trade. So I have a Kapo\u201d\u2019, you know, the Kapo. That mean it was he\norganize, not organize but he take care on a certain group of people for the work, like a\nmanager for work. So I ask him, \u201cMaybe you want to take me to your job,\u201d because it\nwas not so hard.\n** eastern worker (German); forced laborer from Eastern Europe.\n*\u00b0 Voluntarily (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 In a later conversation the interviewee clarified that he had meant to say \u201cPW.\u201d\n\u00b07 commando (German)\n*$ Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners.\nSo I was a Kommando 120 \u2014 800 \u2014 28. I was electric Kommando specialist, you know,\nthe work was already little bit easy. First off all, I don't have to carry nothing but, you\nknow, sometimes we have a pliers. Sometimes, you have a case and box with tools or\nlittle wire or little cable, and even when we have to pull cables there was a special\nKommando, Kommando nine and they pull the cables, and there was that Kommando.\nThere the peoples not survive no longer than four, five weeks.",
        "Q: Why was that?",
        "A: Because it was very hard. First, they were big cable and it was hard and they were very\nbig. And the Kapo was very bad man. He was from Austria. But I never want to go. I take\ncare always not to fall in, in this Kommando because that finished. So I in was\nKommando 128. It was very -- not easy, but it was easy. And one day the chief of -- the\nGerman chief come in and I was working with two Polish guys. They was in\nconcentration camp too. But they was okay. So I was the helper. I have to help them. I\nwas carry tools. I was carry the box and they was my chiefs, my managers. So the chief\ncome in and say \u201cLook, you have to go in this, this place, you have to connect the cable\nto 4000 volt.\u201d I remember very good.\nSo it was in, Tadek and we have to go there. And it was a big cable and there was a box,\nyou know, for the fuses and it was the long fuse. And on the top there was power and on\nthe end there was no power, because you have to put the fuse and you have to connect\nthis cable. So we put the cable in this box and he say, \u201cYou know, what? I'm going to\npush him. You push in and you make the screws and we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d And so, he was\nstronger for me, and after the cable I screw a little bit. Not so much because I was not so\nstrong like him. So he say, \u201cYou know what? Now, you come lift little bit the cable. I\u2019m\ngoing to screw.\u201d So I have -- the box was big -- I have my face always in the box and I\nkeep this cable. And he took a key, a metal key and turned the nuts, you know, to close it\nvery fast. And in the middle it turned and placed from down to up and from up to down,\nand it make a short and there was a flame and I have it all, everything in my face. The\nwhole face was burned and he have, you know, split his hand and I think I was burning,\nso I wipe up and I take out all this meat, all the skin to the bones. It was, first of all, it\nwas hell. So I look at him. So I say, \u201cTell me, what you do?\u201d When he saw me he say,\n\u201cWe have to go some place.\u201d So we run to the commanders place where the SS was there\nand we arrive there. So, I remember the SS, they say, \u201cWas hast du -- Icek, was hast du\ngemacht?\u201d\u2019\u2019 What you are doing? So I say I was in -- meantime there was no power in\nthe center there. So, they call to the -- we have in Krankenbau\u201d\u2019 and like a little hospital,\n*\u00b0 \u201cWhat have you \u2014 Icek, what have you done?\u201d (German)\n\u201d Infirmery (German)\nand they say for me, \u201cHe was wounded -- he was burned. You have to come and take\nhim.\u201d Because I can't see any more, nothing. So -- but the SS still, they give me cigarette,\nmaybe they have pity for me, I don't know. And it is coming with the table. Put me on a\ntable I went to the hospital and I was there. So I say -- it was a doctor, it was Polack -- I\nsay \u201cLook, I hope I can go out tomorrow, day after tomorrow.\u201d So he say, \u201cYou crazy?\nEven in 15 days, you can't go out.\u201d And, you know, every day the doctor come and take\nout the dry skin. But I was so bad burned so they have to put me some place because\nMengele come in every time to looking after, and when he find me, he send me to the gas\nchamber because I was very sick. So they hide me at certain time. I was covered with all\nkind of things -- he doesn't see me. And I was in the hospital for maybe six weeks. After\nsix weeks I come out and we start to work again. So no more electrician.",
        "Q: So they let you stay in the hospital six weeks and not many people they let stay six --",
        "A: Oh, no, oh, no. Because every day, every day you have peoples coming in truck and take\nthem out and they send them to the gas chamber.",
        "Q: And these doctors were nice and they hid you?",
        "A: He didn't see me. I don't know how they manage it. But they -- because of, I don't know.\nMaybe they like me. Maybe I was lucky. And it was a very nice man. The doctor was\nvery nice. He clean it every day. He take out the dry skin. It hurt very much.",
        "Q: Now where was your brother at this point?",
        "A: My brother, he was in Birkenau. They take him away to Birkenau.",
        "Q: Did he start at Buna with you?",
        "A: He start at Buna with me and this I want to see before my accident. The burn accident.\nThe transport from the same town when I was in Plonsk is coming, the next transport. It\nwas my oldest brother come in and he took the place, the transport took the place from us\nin the quarantine. And in quarantine they find out one or two, they have typhus, and they\ntake the whole transport and they send them to Birkenau. And they went -- most of them,\n80 or 90 percent from this -- they went to the gas chamber. And my brother was between\nthem.\nSo we have to \u2014 you know, in column -- we was always -- all this was about four or five\no'clock afternoon. When the war was finished, the day war was finished, we have to walk\nto the camp. We never walked when it was dark, not in the morning, not at night. We\nhave to come into the camp when it was lights. So when I come -- when my Kommando\ncome to the camp, so I saw the whole column from my brother and he saw me. He say\nme, he say me \u201cGoodbye. We doesn't see you -- We don't see us anymore.\u201d And this was\nthe end.",
        "Q: Your brother waved goodbye?",
        "A: And my little brother was already in Birkenau. He find, maybe next day he find his\nclothes.",
        "Q: Now, when you were building over at Buna, what were you building?",
        "A: Blocks, buildings, all kind of buildings. Because like I say --",
        "Q: Can you just begin that thought with, when we got to Buna we were building?",
        "A: First of all, we building the camp because it was not camp. It was just empty, not empty\nplaces, just a couple barracks. It was not the wires, the electrified wires. We have to build\nthat. We put it --",
        "Q: The barracks?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Your own housing?",
        "A: We have to make that. And we made it because -- first of all, we make the holes to put\nthe Beton\"', you know, around and after we have to pull the wires the, you know \u2014 how\ndo you call -- what they make on the prisons, the wires. You can't pass there, the wires.\nAnd after they have the wires electrify with -- I think, 220 volts around, and something\nwe have to put on this one. We have to put barracks because every time, every time there\nwas newcomers, newcomers like from all kinds of Jews. Most, they coming from all over\nfrom Greece, from Yugoslavia, from Belgium, from France, from all over, all over, all\nover, and we have to build a place for them. So this was the building. After, when the\ncamp was built, so we went in certain group. Went out to the Buna \u2014 work -- we start\nexactly the same thing to build it. Carpenters to prepare to make the things for, to make\nthe Beton, the concrete, and some people like electricians to build all this building. And\nwe have the masters, the masters -- the chiefs, they was Germans. Germans engineers,\nGermans architect, all the Germans was -- and we was just, we made just the dirty work,\nthe hard work.\n* concrete (German)",
        "Q: So you build your part of the camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then after all this was built, did you stay at Buna?",
        "A: I stay always at Buna, yes. Until the end. Until the 18th of January, 1945.",
        "Q: Because you were there at the beginning, did you have a good sense of the layout of the\ncamp and how everything was organized?",
        "A: Layout of the camp, no. But one thing we know, we don\u2019t going to survive there. They\nhave to -- first of all, you know, when you fall sick, was finished. And they have to every\nday, every time, they have to kill in certain number from this prisoners. There was this\npolicy, the German policy.",
        "Q: Did you work in the German industry as well?",
        "A: The whole camp was German industry.",
        "Q: But in the -- did you work in the coal mines? Did you work in the munitions? Did you\nwork in the rubber making?",
        "A: We make, yes. I was working there and in the industry because it was our job. Like I say,\nI was working like electrician and we always have to be ready, because we make\nsometimes, you know, they have some trouble with the electricity. There was the, you\nknow, how can I explain you? It was in building 700, and this 700 they make the gasoline\nfor the planes and there was a roll, and under this it was like a carpet, long carpet. It was\nrolling and over there they put some, not coal, but cox.\nYou know what cox? Cox is coal. You take out the coal \u2014 you take out the gas from them\nand from them they took out, they make gasoline and this have to run the whole day. You\nput it in the machine to take out the stuff, and we have to always take care of that, to\nrepair. Sometimes it was missing. Sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes it was a fuse\nwas burned up or something like that, and we have to be always there. They run 24 hours\na day. So this one 1s the job I was working there.",
        "Q: How long were you in that job?",
        "A: This was maybe about two years.",
        "Q: How many workers were over there?",
        "A: In this whole company, they all I.G. Farben industry, was about, I can't lie to you, about a\nmillion something, a million people.",
        "Q: In the part where you were working?",
        "A: The part I was working was about, maybe 35 peoples. Just my Kommando for me. This\nwas just the prisoners.",
        "Q: Were there women working at Buna?",
        "A: No, no, no. There was women, yes. But there was no prisoners with us. There was the\ncivil workers, the Ost** workers from east, from east, from Poland, from Ukraine, from\nRussian, and sometimes there was even the prisoners from the war, from American\nprisoners, English prisoners, Australian prisoners. They all take part in the war. They was\nthere in this I.G. Farben industry.",
        "Q: And you're calling all these prisoners of war? These civilian workers, even though they\nwere prisoners of war?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how was this organized? You did certain job and they did certain jobs?",
        "A: Yes. We have -- first of all, we don't have no right to speak with any kind of civil\nworkman. When is a German we have like chief German, German chiefs, like architects,\nlike engineers.\nWhen these spoke there was a Kapo, they take care of us. So he was talking with him and\nhe give us orders, but personal. I don't have no right to talk with any kind of civil worker,\nany kind of civil business. Nothing. If they catch me, they hang us, you know. We have\nevery day, every day there was before supper, supper what we have. We come in, and we\nsaw already the thing was made and today they going to hang one or three or five or\nsomething. I remember, there was one bombardment and there was a young man -- I don't\nremember how old he was -- He eat his piece of bread that he receive for breakfast, and\nthe German SS take them and they put him in jail. They make a jail, a hole. They put him\nin jail and the next day they hang him, and because they say he was stealing bread. And\n\u201d East (German)\ntime from the bombardment was not good, and I remember young man was maybe 17,\n18-years-old, he begging them officers \u2014 Obersturmbannfuhrer -- and they begging him,\nthey kiss his boot, \u201cPlease, it\u2019s not true, I don't do nothing.\u201d He doesn\u2019t help, absolute\nnothing. They put him on -- they put his cut on his neck and he poor guy, he couldn't die.\nThere was a guy -- a Rackers\u201d\u2019, terrible bitch an German, took his feet and pull him so\ndown to die fast. And this one was the order for the day was, maybe every day, every\nsecond day. One day we coming up, we coming to the camp after the work and they saw\nalready, in each place from the Appellplatz was the German with the rifle, with the\nmachine gun, and we say, \u201cOh, oh, something happen.\u201d And three young boys was\nhanging because he say they want to escape from the camp. That wasn't true and they\nhang him. So I remember one scream, \u201cKopf hoch, Kamerad!\u201d\u201d* -- I'm sorry...\u201d",
        "Q: Take your time.",
        "A: I'm sorry. He say, \u201cKopf hoch. Kamerad! Wir die letzten\u201d? -- he say, \u201cup his head\u201d --\n\u201cwe are the last one.\u201d And the last one he say, \u201cLeben die Freiheit!\u2019\u201d\u201d\u201d\u00b0 \u201clong life and\nliberty.\u201d They hang three young peoples for what? Did exactly the same thing, pull them\nby the legs because they couldn't die. And sometimes even to die, even to hang, you have\nto know how to hang. And sometimes, you know, you have to -- they think, you know,\nthey have to put it here just to break the neck. But he just put on the thing and put here.\nThis guy don't know how the neck, so he pull on the legs to die. How did they do that?",
        "Q: What were you thinking as all of this is happening?",
        "A: Every day, every day, every day was the same thing. Every day we saw it and sometimes,\nsome days, we talking about it and I have it before my eyes. I saw the young boys, and\nafter we have to march, you know. You know was about 12 or 15,000 peoples, I don't\nremember. We have to pass by them and have to look on them, how they hang dead.\nSomething terrible.",
        "Q: Did you feel terribly isolated?",
        "A: You see in a moment there -- sometimes I wake up at night, you see, 50 years after and I\nsay, 1t was impossible. Is dream. I dream about that, but it's impossible that things happen\nin the 20th century and peoples, like Germany, they are cultivated people. So organized\npeople doing things like that. It is something impossible. When the-- you know,\n* SS Technical Sergeant Bernhard Rackers\n\u201c Head high, comerade! (German)\n* Head high, comerade! We are the last. (German)\n\u201c\u00a9 Long live liberty! (German)\nliquidated the ghetto there was the German to go to take out the peoples, took the little\nchildren, little babies by their feet and they smash their heads on the wall and -- and the\ngovernment doesn't know, the United States government don't know, the government\nfrom England doesn\u2019t know -- they know everything but nobody lift their little finger,\nbecause maybe, because they are Jews, but maybe -- they don't kill not just Jews. They\nhave Christian too. And nobody, nobody lift. Nobody say one word because, you know,\nand God, where was God? God. And the Germans have this belt was marked God, God is\nwith us. The Germans not with us. They kill people. They kill rabbis. They kill priests.\nThey kill everybody. Where was God?",
        "Q: Where did you think God was at the time? Did you think there was a God?",
        "A: No. Even not today, no. Look at what happened. That still, but still 1s not maybe a\nHolocaust, but they kill. They still kill all those people. Why? Why did they kill? Okay. I\ngoing to say they kill the oldest people, maybe they going to do something, but the young\nbabies, the old men -- I had an uncle he was over 100 years. They kill him. Why?",
        "Q: Do you remember if you prayed at all when you were in the camp? Did you pray?",
        "A: Did I pray?",
        "Q: Did you pray?",
        "A: Pray to who? No, no. Even not today, no! Because to who I going to pray? To kill me a\nlittle bit faster? I like to believe \u2014 I like to believe, I'm a Jew 100 percent. There is no\nquestion. But pray for who? For who? Where is he? What to do? God, I see with my\neyes. We was wondering there was a priest, an older priest and he fall on his knees by the\nSaint Maria in Poland. You know, there was the Christ and all these things, and a\nGerman come in, a young German kill him on the spot. And there is nothing there. Even\nthis guy should -- his hand should be paralyzed and, you going to tell me there 1s a God?\nThere is a priest. There is a Pope, all these things, but, nothing 1s not true. Is nothing\nthere. Even today in the 21st century we believe, make such a thing as murders, killing\nlittle babies, little children. Why? What difference? Jew, not Jew? We all the same. They\nhave the same blood. Why? Who you going to ask? Who you going to ask? Who we\ngoing to ask? Stop it. What are you going to say? I have the same thing.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, was there -- did you ever feel like you would get out of there?",
        "A: No, no. I know once in 1945 in 18 of January. So we don't go out no day before. Two\ndays before, we don't go out to work. The Kommandos were a little, you know, some no\nproblem, but the Germans was very hard, so I say, \u201cUh-oh, something happen.\u201d And this\ntime they start to make the bombardment on the camp. You know, the I.G. Farben was\nbombarded. The repair was bombarded. It was something. So on the 18 of January there\nwas an order, we have to go together and we was out. The camp was liquidated and the\nBuna. We have to go out. So we was walking the whole night until a certain camp,\nGleiwitz.\nSO we was in camp. We went to the camp. We stay over night and the next day they\ncome in. We have to go to the train station. And in this gruppe\u2019\u2019, I was most of the last\none. And we have to take out the peoples what was first in the Krankenhaus\u2019\u2019, in hospital\nthere. So we have peoples. There was a little, not all young. They was a little sick, you\nknow, and we have to take them out, and they sit outside the place. It was -- I saw was\none or two SS, they shoot them, they shoot all those people. There was a river from\nblood. I couldn't -- we go to the station and they put us in trains, you know that. They put\nin the beast, you know, the cows. They put us in the trains, and it was maybe eight days\nlong. It was a ride maybe eight kilometers up and down, up and down, and everything\nwas closed. We don't have no water. It was wintertime, no water, no food, nothing, but in\nthe trains, in the wagons there was a -- you know, between the wood was little bit open.\nSo we have the air. So we coming back to Gleiwitz and I was hearing an order is coming\nfrom the Germans, and they say, \u201cSS abriicken, Haftlinge stehenlassen.\u201d\u201d\nSo the SS have to go away but they have to leave the prisoners in the wagons. So one\nofficer say, \u201cNo, we have to take the prisoners with us. They was a -- they going to\nprotect us.\u201d And they open the wagon with the machine rifle they start to shoot them. I\nhave just one. I received here. I don't know if you can see. (Indicating.)",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So I fell down and have to roll. I don't know how long. I don't remember because it was\njust shooting and lots of dead, and we was walking in the bushes, and from both sides the\nSS with machine rifles they shoot. It was lots of people run away, run to the bushes. I\ndon't know if they catch them or kill them. And we are were wandering the whole night.\nWe were walking until the next day. We come in the morning. We come in the prison,\nand we fell on the floors, and we sleep on the floor until next day. Next day we have to\nwalk. And we walk 2000 kilometers from 18 of January until ninth of May, 1945. And\nwe was by streets, all kind of towns, and sometimes we have a place to stay, in place one\nday. One day -- it was in March -- we come in a place. I don't remember anymore the\nplace, and there it was, a camp just for the Polish people. I don't know if it was\n\u201c7 Group (German); military term for basic unit of 10 men.\n*S Hospital (German)\n\u201d SS go away, prisoners stay (German)\nconcentration, if it was a work camp. And so the SS, I hear what they say, \u201cWe going put\nthe prisoners there and we going to have a rest for one or two days.\u201d Because, I think,\nthey was tired, too. But the chief in the camp, he doesn\u2019t want to let us in. And in this\ntown it was a mountain, a little mountain and they make a tunnel -- you know what a\ntunnel is -- in case the fliers come in to bomb. And so the people from this town can go in\nand to be safe, but it doesn't make it right through. And the chief say, \u201cOkay, we going to\nput the prisoners over there.\u201d They put us there and it was not so very high and so it was\ncold. Everybody go on the end but it was closed. You couldn't go nowhere because it was\nnot finished, it was not finished.\nThe compress us. All the things was outside, so I went there too, and it was a little warm\nbut after I say, \u201cIs little bit but no air. I want to go in the front.\u201d And they wanting the\nchief, the commandant in this camp. They make soup, you know, liquid soup. So I have it\nwas a part with me, and I say I going to go in the front every time and I going to take a\nlittle bit. I have to eat, so I take one and I say I going to take one, and I have a nice time.\nIn meantime we start to missing air in the end, no air, no air, and everybody want to go in\nthe front. So like here, you have the door. When you open the door, it was a place --\n\u201cThis one for me -- a good place, I gonna go there, I go to hide there. Nobody going to\nsee me and I have the fresh air.\u201d And the front was two SS and every time when the\npeoples want to go to the front, they shoot them. They kill them and they kill lots of\npeoples. And they put in -- there was a wagon outside and they put a wagon in front so\nnobody can go in. What I going to tell you? I can't describe it. There was screaming and\ncrying and the peoples, they running to the walls. They licked the walls because it was\nwet from the no air, and you see the oxide coming out. It was there in March. It was\nabout six o'clock. It was dark and the front was the SS. They let nobody out. We have to\nstay inside until the next day in the morning, and the morning was lights come in, maybe\neight o'clock and they called all the SS to come in, and they let out the people that was\nstill alive, and the firework was coming. They couldn't go in. They had to take the gas\nmask, they couldn\u2019t go in the end and from the end they took out peoples there. Dead.\nMaybe 100, 150 people was dead. And some peoples could survive on the end, coming\nout after five, six minutes they outside, they fell down and die because the lungs, they\ncouldn't support.\nAnd I was there maybe couple days, and they took the dead peoples put between the\nbarracks outside, they all frozen. Food, no question about food for us there. And about\neight days later we have to go away. And we start again to walk, and the order was to\nshoot the people, to kill us. But they couldn't kill us in town because it civil people there\nand they couldn't -- they doesn't want to give us to deliver to the Russian, because the\nRussians coming from the other side. And they don't want to give us to the American\nsoldier, but the American was too far. So we was between and we was walking every\nday. Every day we was walking. It was a couple SS and they pull out peoples and they\nshoot. So I say, \u201cGod, something happen. I won't survive.\u201d So I have -- on my side it was\na little SS. He was -- I don't know if he was from Yugoslavia, an older man, maybe 60,\nmaybe more, and he have on backsack. So I say to him, \u201cLook, you not a young man.\nYou know what? Give me your back. I going to carry them.\u201d So he say, \u201cWhy you want\nto do that?\u201d \u201cI want to help you. You tired. I want to help you. I think that's good.\u201d So he\ntake out -- he give me the thing he was walking just on the side from me. So every time\nthey eat, they have food, they have bread, so he give me just a piece of bread for me. It\nwas good and I can walk, first of all. Second, I was sure no SS going to come and grab\nme to kill me because I have his things, and he going to take care of it because he want\nalready \u2014 I have \u2014 SS they want to come in and grab me he say, \u201cUh-oh, don't touch it\u2019s\nmine.\u201d So I was already okay, and when I was doing that so many peoples, not many\nhave prisoners like me to do that. There was about five, six that we carried the SS sack.\nAnd in summertime, so we find a wagon. We put all these goods from the Germans, from\nthe SS, on the wagon, and we was pushing the wagon. And we was okay. We didn't have\nfood, but at least I was sure -- I was not sure -- but I was sure I was going to live until\nnight. I don't know what going to be next day. So they put us in all kind of place to sleep,\nand in the morning we see one dead on one side, one dead on other side \u2014 the people\ndying like nothing. And it coming May 9, 1945 about seven, eight o'clock in the morning,\nand it was not far from Friedland in Sudetenland. There was still a little SS come into me\nand took me by the arm.\nHe say to me in German, \u201cGo hin\u2019\u2019, where you wollt\u201d\u2019, aber lasst euch ja nicht erwischen\nbei unsere Briider.\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cGo where you want, but take care the Germans doesn't catch\nyou.\u201d And this was my liberation. The Russian come in there and this was May 1945, and\nI was with my friend from Holland. My friend and we was running, running, and we saw\nalready, you know, the Germans was sitting the rifles and all these things, all on the side.\nNo more. And one moment everybody who running -- the Germans was running, all the\nsoldiers was running. So I was on the highway and I stay and I wasn't German, and I say,\n\u201cHey, why you running so fast?\u201d So he say, \u201cFast, fast, Ivan come!\u201d And the Russian\ncoming, this was the liberation. He was lucky he was the first officer that I saw. It was a\nJew, Russian, Jew, Russian, and this when was the liberation. So you can imagine.",
        "Q: Could you believe this was really true?",
        "A: No, and the first thing that he say, \u201cYou go back about five or 10 kilometers because here\nwe have to find, it still the Hitlerjugend\u201d\u201d\u201d -- was still in the bushes was hiding and \u2014 \u201cwe\nhave to clean it up.\u201d But this was impossible -- I couldn't believe it. I was at this time, I\n*\u00b0 there (German)\n>! want (German)\n** but don\u2019t let yourself be caught by our brothers (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization.\nwas maybe 30 kilos, about 60 pounds and eating -- I don't have eat maybe, one or two\nweeks and it was very hard not to eat, but in this time, you know, the snow, there, it was\nmelted, it was blackened, and this is what we ate. This was our nourishment.",
        "Q: You ate the snow?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, did the Russians then come back and take care of you?",
        "A: Yeah. The Russian was there and we going back, and I was -- we went to Ringelshain in\nthis one -- in Sudetenland, you know, and Czechoslovakia and I was there. I was there a\nlittle time and I don't know nothing about my brothers. Because all this time I think\nmaybe they are all dead. So one thing that happened, you know, there was lots of people,\nwatch us passing in this town, and so there was boy. He was passing and I was talking\nwith him. So I told, I ask him, \u201cWhere you going?\u2019 So he say \u201cOh, I don't want to stay\nhere. I go to Germany. From Germany I go to Belgium.\u201d And I say, \u201cMaybe, maybe, you\nsaw my brother.\u201d I don't know. But this guy he went like say, he say, he went to Germany\nand from Germany he went to Belgium and he go exactly the same place where my\nbrother was. So the same thing I ask him and so he say, \u201cI saw your brother. Yes, your\nbrother is dead.\u201d So, I receive a letter from him. I receive a letter, I say, \u201cI don't have\nnothing to do here.\u201d So from Czechoslovakia I went to Germany and I go to Munich, to\nGermany, and when I arrive there so, you know, we have all over friend. I have all over\npeople I know from camp. So I saw one, he say \u201cAye, look, your brother is looking after\nyou.\u201d \u201cMy brother is looking after me?\u201d He say, \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cHow is looking, my brother?\u201d\nHe describe me completely like my older brother is -- he went to gas chambers \u2014 so I say,\n\u201cLook, I think you made a mistake.\u201d And he say, \u201cNo, I don't make a mistake, I think\nhe\u2019s younger from you.\u201d He told me, \u201cand is that and that and that.\u201d \u201cYou have the\naddress?\u201d And he say \u201cNo, I don't have the address.\u201d So we took a taxi. We run the\nwhole day over all Munich and that night I find him, and he doesn\u2019t know from me, and\nhe doesn\u2019t know from me from my brother -- that was in Belgium. And I said \u201cLook,\nAaron is alive and is there and there.\u201d And we send him a telegram. He went from\nBelgium. He come to Munich, to Germany and from Germany went to Belgium. We were\nall three together, and after my two brothers, they went to Israel. From Israel they went to\nBelgium and from Belgium to Canada and here I am.",
        "Q: So the three of you were together?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And they went to Israel?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: They went to Israel?",
        "A: No, they, went my brother went to Israel in 1947, or '48. After '48, you know by Israel\nwas country received the independence. They went to Israel.",
        "Q: And how come you didn't go with them?",
        "A: Because I was married in Belgium.",
        "Q: Did you have a difficult time getting to Canada?",
        "A: I don't have no difficult in Canada, but I have very much difficult in Belgium, yes.\nBecause they ask me always papers \u2014 and we don\u2019t have no papers -- you couldn't stay in\nBelgium. And we want to stay in Belgium. We don't have no right to work, no have to\nright to make business, and every three months we have to go to the police. And, you\nknow, to present, to say, \u201cI'm here,\u201d and always was the same question. \u201cWhat you doing\nhere? And why you stay here?\u201d So the one thing I say 1s, \u201cfor the moment I want to here,\nbut we want to go to Israel, to Palestine.\u201d And he gave me, you know, for three months\nand again for three months and -- but before, when we arrived in Belgium, we was in a\nhome for old peoples, like an orphan house, but it is not for young but was already old,\n17, 18 years. But before that we have was maybe, you know, Namur.\nNamur was a priest, a very, very good man, a very fine man, and have trouble with the\npolice because they doesn't want to let us be there. So the gendarmes, the Belgium\ngendarmes they want to take out to pass the border. So they took one, they put on the\ntruck, and time they want to take someone else. They escaped. It was the priest. He say,\n\u201cStop. I going to take all.\u201d So he took all the peoples in the church. Jewish people went\nall there until a Jewish chaplain from the American Army, he know about that, and he\ntook the \u2014 all this people, Brux-- Linkebeek.\nAnd it was a home there. It was in Linkebeek in this home, and we was support by the\nJewish committee until a certain time. After they liquidate this home and everybody have\nto go to work, but we have some trouble with the work and we need an carte d\u2019identit\u00e9>\u2019,\na card. Some people have a white card, some people have an Model \u201cC\u201d this one with\n\u00bb* identity card (French)\njust use fingerprints. And we have trouble to stay there. We never could be a Belgium\ncitizen. So the best way is to go out. And we start, you know, to make the registration to\nAustralia, to New Zealand, and to Canada. So the first thing my brother, the younger\nbrother, went to Canada here and after we come.",
        "Q: But I thought he was already in Israel.",
        "A: No. From Israel he come, you know, he make his service, military service.",
        "Q: He came back?",
        "A: Came back from Belgium. He come here to Canada.",
        "Q: So you applied to various countries and Canada accepted you first?",
        "A: Yes. Now Canada is my home.",
        "Q: Were you in the DP camp in Czechoslovakia long?",
        "A: There was no camp.",
        "Q: There wasn't a camp?",
        "A: No, I was not in camp. I was in private home. I was in Czechoslovakia, about a year, a\nyear and a half because I have to find somebody. I couldn't imagine the whole family,\nnobody dead. So I travel. I want to go to Poland but when I come to Polish, on the border,\nPolish-Czechoslovakia they start to take us to the army. So I say, \u201cHold it, stop. First of\nall, I can't kill nobody. Second, I am no good for the army. I was already five year in the\nconcentration camp.\u201d Not for me, the army. So, I remember very well. It was the German\nprisoners, the sick, wounded prisoners that was from the war. They was in train this pass\nfrom Poland and Poland Czechoslovakia and most of prisoners from the Russian front\nfrom the German. They pass Czechoslovakia, Poland, Czechoslovakia. So the first thing\nat night there was a train. I jump on the train and I went in Czechoslovakia because\nCzechoslovakia was the maybe, is today I don't know, it was the one civilized country\nfrom the old eastern country. First of all, no antisemite is there. There are very, very fine\npeople. There are today very fine people, very good, and they help lot, they help. Red\nCross, they help me and after I went to UNRRA and I was very good there. But soon I\nreceive a letter from my brothers. I say and the same thing and this time, you know, I\ndon't know if you know, Masaryk\u201d was the president from Czechoslovakia, he kill\nhimself and this started the trouble with the Communists.\n\u00bb\u00b0 Jan Masaryk (1886-1948); Czech statesman.\nAnd I say, \u201cI'm not a Communist. I was in diktature\u201d\u00ae already long enough. I want to be\nfree. I want to freedom so nobody can tell me what I do, what I -- nobody can do what I\nhave to say. What I have to do, what I have to say. I want out.\u201d So, the first thing that I\ndo, I take my friend and we went to Prague and in Prague was just -- you know, I listen\nby the radio. It was the Nuremberg process. So they make the process and the next day\nwe smuggle the border, and we arrive to Germany and then Munchen, you know -- not\nMunchen, but it was in West Germany. And from the West Germany I say, \u201cNow I am in\na democratic country.\u201d The American was there. I don't care but I don't stay not long,\nbecause we went to Belgium. Belgium we have trouble but the government doesn\u2019t let us\nthere.",
        "Q: You're with your brother at this point?",
        "A: I was always with my brothers, yes. And that's the way was. Look, we go to United States\n-- not to United States -- we went to Canada then.",
        "Q: Did the Russians treat you well when they liberated you?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. At first you know we cry. We cry.",
        "Q: You know what --",
        "A: They was very, fine. Very good.\n\u00b0\u00b0 dictatorship (Yiddish)\nTape #4",
        "Q: I'd just like to finish up what we were talking about earlier, which was I was asking you\nhow the Russians who liberated you, how they treated you.",
        "A: Very, very good. First of all, they know already because before they coming to us, they\npass already Auschwitz and Buna there, and the whole way that they make from the\nRussian country \u2018til us. They liberated 100 different prisons and they saw all of that, and\nthey saw the crematoriums, they saw all these things. So when they arrived on us, they\nsaw this. They know about us. They know, and I remember when the Russian arrived, the\nofficer, the first thing what he gave me a piece of bread. And he have a motorcycle and\nhe told me, \u201cYou know what? You sit on the side car. You going show me all the\nGermans that kill, that was bad.\u201d And, you know, it was the first soldier that coming and\nit was always with motorcycle and on this motorcycle was a machine gun. And, you\nknow, they was in the middle and all the soldiers, the German soldiers have to be on the\nside because, you know, they was the Russian soldiers come in, and they took them all to\nthe camp. And I, so far I remember, I was \u2014 gun -- I saw a gun and I start to play with it\nand the gun start to shoot, and maybe I kill some Germans. I don't know.",
        "Q: Did you want to?",
        "A: No. I can't watch them. I know it was and I say, \u201cHey, hey, stop it. I don't know how to\nstop it.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t take time, it was so fast. And I remember we coming back, I don\u2019t\nknow if he was talking Russian. Meantime, they take away all the Germans, all the SS\nwith the Germans, they took to the camp.",
        "Q: What camp did they take them to?",
        "A: The prisoner camp, and after they separate them, SS one camp the Wehrmacht\u201d\u2019 in\nsecond camp, and the women was to the SS women was... and I remember it was an\nofficer with a motorcycle come in. He want to pass, and on his motorcycle have a\nmachine gun. So the Russians, the Russian officer, he say, \u201chey stop, go down and come\nin.\u201d And the officer was saying -- and he talk to his soldiers, \u201cTake him, bring him there.\u201d\nHe doesn't want to. He stay up. He want to take the gun, so they kill him. They shoot him\nand the first thing that I do -- I have no shoes -- so I take his boots. They were beautiful,\nnice boots, and I take his boots and I look in his pocket. Maybe he have bread or\nsomething like that. So I take -- and I find a piece of bread and a piece of soap. The first\n\u00b07 General title of German armed forces from 1935 to 1945.\ntime. So the Germans, they give us, you know, machorka\u2019\u00ae, it was the tabek\u201d\u201d -- to things\n-- and bread, and we have some meat. Not meat, but salami, the Russian salami. And they\nsay, \u201cgo back\u201d and we went back. So we went back maybe about 10 kilometers, back. We\nhave meantime, I have a car. I have a horse. I have a bicycle. I have a car. I don't know\nhow to drive, but I drive a car a little bit. But so far, so long we have gasoline. We don't\nhave no gasoline, and after I have a horse, but the horse was more tired than me so I leave\nit there, until I have a bicycle. And we went to a town, a town called Ringelshain and I\nsaw a little house on the mountain.\nAnd I say to my friend Jackie, I say, \u201cYou know what, Jackie, we are going up there. We\nare going to try to pass the night over there, but here on the road is going to be very noisy\nbecause the army pass.\u201d And so he say, \u201cokay.\u201d So we go up the little hill and it was a\nlittle house, and we knocked. There was two old, one man and one woman and I was\nmaybe crazy, not crazy but I very polite, and they were German too. And I say, \u201cI'm\nsorry, we coming from concentration camp. We\u2019re very tired -- so, maybe we can pass\nthe night here? I don't want to stay here, but maybe you have a shed or something like\nthat?\u201d So he told us, \u201cLook, we are not farmers. We don't have nothing. But there\u201d -- he\nshow me over there -- \u201cis a big farm, over there you can go and you can pass.\u201d In\nmeantime there was a young lady stick out her head and she say, \u201cHey, hey, come here.\nHow you talk? You speak Russian?\u201d So, I say, \u201cYes.\u201d But you believe me, at this time\nbelieve me or not, but at this time I was talking about -- speaking about seven language.\nBut I was with all kind of people. We have French -- not English -- French and Russian\nand Yugoslav. All kind of the slavish tongue, and we have Hungarian. We have Greek.\nAnd this all you have to understood all together, so for each language you take a couple\nwords and you learn. So I say, \u201cyes.\u201d So she say, \u201cYou want to come in because some\nRussian come in and they make us some trouble, and we can't speak with them. Maybe\nyou can speak with them.\u201d So we go in and first of all, we was so dirty. So we have to go\nand wash up and they give us, I remember she start to cut bread, but little slices. So I say,\n\u201cOh, no. That\u2019s not for us.\u201d I took a big slice of bread. And the first time after so many\nyears, I sleep in a good bed. And the next day we go out and we were looking for brother,\nmaybe a sister. Maybe was and we went to the Russian commandant too, and they give\nus all kind of things too and it was very, very nice. Very good.",
        "Q: Let me just go back a minute to the camp and ask you a few questions. One is, when you\nwere in Buna, did you have much connection with or much knowledge about was\nhappening in the rest of the complex?\n\u00b0\u00a7 Tobacco (Polish)\n\u00bb Snuff (Yiddish)",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: In Birkenau?",
        "A: Yes. We have all the news. We have all the news because it was every day, every day\nwas the same thing. Because first, you know, Mengele was, most of time, he was in he\nwas camp in the morning, when we was marching out from camp to work he was there.\nHe was there with a little stick, you know, and when he showing somebody, \u201cthis guy\nhave to be take out,\u201d and he went, you know, in a special block and they put them, they\nput all of them. There was the bed, three beds, but they took out the wood between and\nthey close them like a box. Inside they put in these people and the next day they come,\nyou know, with the truck and to put all these people in that. They want to send to the gas\nchamber. So we know that because we knew every day, every day. It is not just sick\npeople. Even the healthy peoples.",
        "Q: But did you know sort of what the structure of the other camps were or did people come\nfrom those camps to you and tell you what it was like at the different camps?",
        "A: Yes. My brother, when he was taken away from Auschwitz they send him to\nJawischowitz, and Jawischowitz was a coal mine. Now, in Buna, if somebody have a bad\nrecord, like in Kapo, you know, a Kapo he went to the jail, to the SS, and say \u201clook, this\nguy is not a good worker,\u201d or something like that. So he doesn't kill him, but they send\nhim to a very hard job and in the coal mines. They have, you know, it was punishment.\nSo they send him for eight days -- not eight days, maybe three weeks, four weeks in coal\nmine. In coal mine like my brother told me, he was there, he was working on his belly, so\ndeep, they have to shovel the coals it was so deep. So it was very, very hard. And how I\nknow? Because this guy, he was strong, so he survive. And after surviving he come back\nto us and he give me news. He say, \u201cLook, I saw your brother. Your brother is in\nJawischowitz. He work there.\u201d So I make all my possible. He was a guy, he was Erwin,\ncalled him -- he was an Altreich\u201d\u201d Jew.\nHe was an Rapport-Schreiber\u00ae\u2019. He was working in the office with the German for the\nworker. If somebody change the commander or somebody go from one block -- the first\nthing, I was in block four. After they send me to block 14. After from block 14 they send\nme to block 51. And this was the, like I say, an accountant. And they make all the\npaperwork. So I was talking with him, and I tell him -- I beg him, \u201cLook, I have my\nbrother. He was working there and there and maybe you can do something. Maybe try.\u201d\n\u00b0\u00b0 Old empire (German); term used for regions within Germany\u2019s pre-1938 borders.\n\u00b0! Report writer (German)\nSo he promised me. I say, \u201cMy brother\u2019s a barber. He, you know, he going to shave you.\u201d\nI promise all kind of thing, so he say \u201cI going to try to do that.\u201d So he so that, So he\nmake him like an electrician, special electrician, special. So, I think it was end of 1943.\nMy brother come to my camp in Buna camp. I was in Buna and he was the same\nelectrician. I was electrician. He was electrician, so you can imagine what kind of\nelectrician we was there. So these people they told us everything that happened there, like\nsome people coming from Birkenau, they took every time to put is called a\nSonderkommando\u201d. That mean, I don't remember exactly how many, but these people,\nthey took out when the people was gassed dead in the gas chamber. They took out these\npeople, put them on the wagon and push them to the oven. But these people don't do long\ntime because -- I'm sorry -- they put out the dead peoples and they put on the wagon. And\nmost of them, they put two men and one women because the women, they burn faster and\nbetter for men. And they put them off a little wagon and they push them in the oven to be\nburned. And these people doesn\u2019t work long. Maybe after two weeks, they are gassed,\nkilled, because they don't want nobody to have to live. Can't tell nobody what happened,\nso they kill them. And we know that. Then they have special peoples. They was very\ngood traitor. They received very good food, but eight days later, two weeks later, they\nhave to go, and they took somebody else. And we know that. Exactly the same thing.\nThey took the Russian prisoners, the women prisoners. They took out the marrow from\nthe bones to put to inject the German soldiers. We know that. The experiments, because\nsomething the doctors tell us the same thing.",
        "Q: The doctors told you?",
        "A: They talk together and they have peoples, like I say, they go into this camp to take the\nclothes from the dead, because they don't have so many. But in the end, like 1945,\nbeginning -- not '45 but middle '44, so before the end '44, we don't have any uniforms,\nlike with the stripes. They don't have anymore. So we have civilian clothes, but we have\nto put a patch on the back so you know yellow or other kind of patch. So they know they\nare prisoners.",
        "Q: You were in the hospital for a long time. Were you aware of any medical\nexperimentation?",
        "A: No. In Buna there was no medical experiments because the hospital was not very big. But\nonce I remember, I was passing there, and I saw it was a very special place where they\nput the dead peoples there, and I saw two doctors. I can say it was Mengele and\nsomebody else and they was playing with human brains. The door was open, there was\nhuman brains.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Special commando (German); A commando of Jewish prisoners in the six extermination camp selected to work\nin the gas chambers and crematoria.",
        "Q: You saw this?",
        "A: I saw it with my eyes, yes.",
        "Q: Could you hear what they were talking about?",
        "A: I have to run away because I was scared for them. They was looking for pistol or for gun\nor something like that.\nAnd once when my brother come in camp, you know, from Jawischowitz into my camp --\nhe was a muselman\u201d. He was very skinny, and so I try to help him. So he was working\nfor the Kommando, for the Luftgaukommando\u2122 -- that mean they make the graves and\nthe holes in the special machine guns against the planes, and they receive very good food,\nthe Germans -- but he was in the commander and they have a couple men with him. And\nthe Germans received this food. But always in the cans they leave a little bit of soup and\nbefore these cans have to go back to the camp they have to be washed. So they give him,\nthey say, \u201cHey, you, you come here. Take the soup but wash the cans.\u201d But the cans was\nwashed with iron brushes, and he was always hungry, he doesn't see -- so ate the soup\nand he swallowed a piece of wire. One Sunday he come to me and he say he was -- it was\nafter, so you have to be a barber and so he shave this guy and somebody else and he say,\n\u201cT have such a pains in my stomach. I don't know what happened. I have lots of pains.\u201d\nSo I say, \u201cYou know what, come, I go with you to the hospital.\u201d But I know this chief of\nthe doctors for the hospital. So, I say \u201cStefan\u201d -- he was a Polack -- \u201cStefan, look, my\nbrother have pains. You come see something.\u201d So he put him on a bench like that there.\nWas many doctors coming in and he was saying appendix. He had such big pains, so they\nput him at night -- not at night -- to operate him and I was on the other side. I was hiding\nbut I saw everything that happened. So it was Dr. Mengele's, because even between the\nprisoners, there was some good doctors and they worked in this hospital. And they want\nto operate him, so they open the belly. In meantime everything was open. There was an\nalarm, you know, the planes. I don't know if English or Russian planes come in. No\nlights. He was laying down with open stomach. It just take I don't know, very long but\nthe lights coming back. And the doctors coming back. I was behind. I saw that. I saw Dr.\nMengele come into him and say on his shoulder, \u201cJude, when you live now, you going to\nlive long time.\u201d And they operate on him. But they pull out all the intestine together very\nbadly and he have very big trouble today, and they can do absolute nothing. Even when\neat a little bit too much, they have to put him to the hospital, they have to take out\neverything. He was very, very sick.\n\u00b0\u2019 Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death.\nAir defense administration (German)",
        "Q: But were you aware of any other weird medical experimentation in the camp?",
        "A: By us, I can't say, no. And I was scared. I never want to go there because I have enough,\nand I was burned because everything was gone. So I don't want to know. I don't want to\ngo there.",
        "Q: So you really didn't know that there was much medical --",
        "A: I know that they make some but I don't think so that they make by us, no. But I know\nthey make with the Gypsies. I know because -- and I know they make with the Russians\nladies, the prisoners. I know from the Jewish people, Jewish woman, they was sterilized.",
        "Q: How did you know this?",
        "A: They told me after the war.",
        "Q: How did they know?",
        "A: The Jewish women, they alive today. They have in Canada and Montreal. I have one.\nThey can't have no children and -- .",
        "Q: So this was information you got later on?",
        "A: In camp. I have from people that coming from Auschwitz, and Birkenau and the other\ncamp because --",
        "Q: Did anyone say, \u201cI have had some injections?\u201d",
        "A: No, no, no. Like I say, I have an injection in my breast. It was so thick. What that mean\nthis time, I don't know. What kind of injection and I have experience with my tooth.\nWhat this means, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don't know what it means?",
        "A: It was take a little time and it was gone. Maybe some people have a reaction, but I don't\nknow. I don't know because there was so many peoples.",
        "Q: So they gave you an injection. You don't know what it was? And a few days later you\nwere Okay.",
        "A: I couldn't -- and because if I ask, I have a slap in the face.",
        "Q: They didn't say, \u201cWe're giving you a shot for the flu?\u201d",
        "A: No, no, no. They never, never say for what. But we know, we have an injection and\nmaybe one or two days we going to die. If not, lucky for me.",
        "Q: So they just said, \u201cCome, we're going to give you a shot?\u201d",
        "A: They say, \u201cJuden have to go there and there and wait.\u201d Or sometimes they say,\n\u201cKommando this number and this number Kommando, have to go there.\u201d Because, like I\nsay, there was maybe 12 or 13,000 people. So they couldn't give in one day the injection\nfor everybody, so they take a certain number of people. Like a block. Like I was in block\n51, it was maybe a 100 people, 120 peoples and other block was exactly 220. So they\ntake about 200 peoples and, or 150 peoples, and this where you go there, and this was if\nan experiments, it's possible.",
        "Q: Were you aware of any significant attempts in the camp to resist or sabotage the\nGermans?",
        "A: I remember once, it was short before the end. They threw out everybody from the\nbarracks and it was a block resistor. There was a guy, he was responsible for the block.\nHe was a Holland man, Bernard I think -- and they took him away. And they look in\nevery bed, under the bed, every barrack, supposed to have some weapon in camp. This I\nknow, positive. If they find something, maybe. I can't say because we don't see this guy\nanymore. Not just him. Some people, couple peoples, but he was in Holland. I think he\nwas somebody. He was from the army and big man, but was in concentration camp. But\nwhy, I don't know. And he was, you know, already in block he was something special.\nAnd they took him away. I'm sure they took him away to Auschwitz and the Gestapo, and\nover there they make some questions and pop -- that's it! Because I know in Auschwitz it\nwas in block 14, block 14 was, and in that block everybody would have to \u2014 be shot.\nThey took him to the block 14, and from block 14 was finished. Nobody can go out.\nBecause by us in Buna, they doesn\u2019t shot -- they shot, sure -- but no somebody wasn't\ntried to the Gestapo. Maybe tried to hang. This was most of time, almost every day -- it\nwas not news. So we know when we come into the camp, we saw in Appellplatz,\nAppellplatz, we saw soldiers come in, in every corner, soldiers with machine gun and,\n\u201cOh, somebody is free today. He going to have his freedom.\u201d That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: You weren't aware really of a lot of efforts for people to try to sabotage the Germans in\nthe factory or --",
        "A: In the factory, special work we didn't have. They don't trust us. We make -- like I say, we\nmake all the dirty jobs, the hard jobs, but special jobs they don't trust. They have their\nown peoples. Like they have the Hitlerjugend, they have the old people, the chiefs, the\nengineers, the architects were all the foreign German peoples, even the women --",
        "Q: How do you think you lasted so long? How did you last so long?",
        "A: I was young. And, you know, this one was maybe my luck because we don't see the\ndanger and we try to keep -- the first thing what I know, I remember when we arrived to\ncamp after the quarantine and we went outside, we were waiting because there was a\ntable. There was all the Gestapo and they marking down what kind of trade you have.\nWhat you can do?\nSo there was a guy -- he's already dead a long time -- he said -- Chaim Komslowski --\nand he come to me, he say, \u201cLook, I can't understand why you are here.\u201d I say, \u201cWhy I\nhere? The same thing why you are here -- I'm a Jew.\u201d But he say, \u201cBut nobody can say\nyou are a Jew.\u201d But the first thing he say, \u201cLook, if you are -- I give you a little advice --\nif you want to live, try to avoid any beating. Try to avoid not to drink water, and if they\ngoing to ask you what you can do, what kind of trade you have, you say you are a\ncarpenter.\u201d I never was a carpenter in my life. I was 14 years. How could I be carpenter?\nSo it coming my time, you know, to go before Gestapo, and, \u201cYour number, name?\u201d \u201cNo\nname,\u201d I say, \u201c79630.\u201d \u201cWhat is your trade?\u201d So I say, \u201cI'm a carpenter\u201d so the Gestapo,\nthe Gestapo say, \u201cWhat? What? You are a carpenter? You so young. You\u2019re a\ncarpenter?\u201d I say, \u201cI'm sorry. I was learning carpenter.\u201d So they put me with the\ncarpenters. It was good, but I have a couple Polack, the son of a bitch -- I'm sorry -- some\nmurderer. So I go to the, you know, to the barrack to work things like a carpenter, and\nthey give me a stick and they say, you make a broom. I don't know how to do that. I\nnever saw a carpenter, like, you know, how to make it round. I don't know how. So,\nnobody want to show me because they were scared and this bitch come in and he say,\n\u201cYou not a carpenter. You\u201d -- and they start to hit me, to kick me, to hit me. There was --\nan SS was sitting there. So he come in and ask him, \u201cHey, why do you hit him?\u201d So he\nsay, \u201cBecause he was lying. He is not a carpenter.\u201d So he tell him, \u201cYou let him go.\u201d So\nhe called me and he say, \u201cHere, you have the cans, you are going to wash the cans. You\ncan clean the toilet.\u201d And this was my luck. So times like I say you have some Germans\nthat was....\nConclusion of interview.\n"

And this\nneighborhood where I was born in Warsaw, it called Powisle, this was just on the river\nbut Poland the big river is Vistula, maybe you know, and that neighborhood was called\nlike that. And my father was a tailor for the army, and so far my father was not alive. He\nwas not bad but he died. I was very young. I don't remember. It could be 1934, '33, '34,\nsomething like that. And my mother she was with seven kids. It was very, very hard. So\nthat's the beginning of a very, very hard life for all of us. I was very young at this time,\nmaybe ten-years-old, maybe younger. Maybe a little bit younger.",
        "A: Yes. I have older brothers. I was the second youngster, so I have three sisters, it was three\nsisters and four brothers. So I was the more youngster, the second youngster.",
        "A: Good memories, yes, good memories, little bit, yes. And time when my mother couldn't\nsupport everything and I was -- it was time to go to school and first time I was in Polish\nschool. In this neighborhood there was no Jewish school and Polish and I was there but I\nwas maybe lucky, maybe my mother was lucky. She sent me to Dr. Korezak\u2019. I was in\norphanage by Korczak. Maybe you know about Korczak, something like that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Most of them was Christian, yes. Perhaps some Jewish too, but just in this neighborhood\nwhere we were living there was not many Jews, was most Christians. And we was living\n-- like I can remember -- it was good because even I don't know what different between\nChristian or not Christian so. I remember just once when it was holidays, Passover, so we\n' Janusz Korczak (1879-1942), physician, writer, and educator. In 1912 he was appointed director the Jewish\norphanage at Krochmalna Street in Warsaw, Poland.\nhad change and we give them matzos, and they bake beautiful nice cake. And this was\nthe difference between a Jew and non-Jew and that's it.",
        "A: We had a very good relationship, yes. And I think my father, my mother, she have too\ngood relationship with these peoples.",
        "A: Yes, because we went before to go to the public school my parents would send me, send -\n- us, brothers too, in the Jewish cheder*. Maybe you know. This is most religion school.\nSo that's the one that was really different between the Christians.",
        "A: Not very religious, but like maybe more than in this time. But my father keep always the\nSabbath and my mother she prepare always for the Friday, like a Jewish home.",
        "A: Yes, lot. Yes. This would be after my father die, so you know when we becoming older\nalready say we understood more and even on the street \u201cJew, Jew.\u201d It was always the\nyoung people, they beating us and they make all kinds of stories, all kinds of things,\nbecause we was Jews. I didn't see any difference, but maybe they saw the difference\nbetween Jew and non-Jew.",
        "A: Yes. But when they are coming older maybe they was more antisemitic \u2014 that\u2019s one of\nthe reasons. Maybe the parents teach them like that. Maybe when in the churches, when\nthey go to the churches the priest say, \u201cDon't buy by Jew. Don\u2019t.... Kill the Jews.\nBecause they killed our Jesus Christus.\u201d That's it.",
        "A: That's when all before the war -- far before the war. This one, like I say, it was between\n1930, '35, 734, \u00b033, \u00b034, \u201935.\n* Orthodox primary school (Yiddish).",
        "A: Yeah, we went to school. But even in the school when we went the first time and I was in\nthe public school, so it was always that the -- but in Poland the people were very religious\nand when it\u2019s coming the time to religion -- we don't have to -- but I went out, out from\nthe classroom, and so after \u201cJew, Jew, Jew,\u201d and if they couldn't, they beat us because\nlook, we was just couple youngsters. Not so many like them. We are scared from them\nand they take advantage of us, that's it. It was very, very hard this time. So even like\nyoungster, and believe me I don't know, I couldn't understand why, why? Because I'm\nJew? And I don't see no difference because I was the same thing. We don't have no horn.\nWe don't have nothing. We took the same language. We eat the same thing. And they was\nso -- they kill. If they can't kill, they beat us. They make all kind of trouble. Sometimes,\nwe saw, they break the windows. They break all these things. Why? Because they were --\nthey're Jewish family, and believe me at this time we were very, very poor. I remember\nmine house. When my father died we were very, very poor because we had my mother.\nShe was with seven kids and support seven kids wasn't easy. She have a very, very, very\nhard life. Very hard life.",
        "A: Lots of things. I don't know. The truth, just what we read sometimes in the paper, you\nknow. The Nationalsozialistische Partei\u2019, they win, you know. At this time it was\nHindenburg\u2019 -- Hindenburg lose the power and the German took the power. So when the\n-- 1939 -- just when it was Rosh Hashanah is decreed the war was starting. So the\nGermans start to come into Poland. I remember when the Pole -- I never want to believe\nthat the Poland going to lose the war. But at this time I was very young so maybe I don't\nunderstood very well, but I remember once my mother told me \u2014 she told us, \u201cYou know\nwhat, you\u2019ll see, when the Germans come in here, I don't think they are going to handle\nwith us very badly because they not the antisemites like the Polacks. Because,\u201d she say,\n\u2018I remember in the war in 1914-18 they were very friendly, because we Jews are\nspeaking Jewish\u201d, and the Jewish is a lot like German so we could understood\naltogether.\u201d And 1t wasn\u2019t -- was like she was saying.",
        "A: What happen German, I don't know exactly. Because maybe I know what we read in the\n* National Socialist Party (German); Nazi political party in Germany.\n* Paul von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (1847-1934); German army officer and statesman, president of\nGermany 1925-1934.\n> Yiddish\npapers, but, you know, we couldn't have no radios, no TV\u2019s and the media was not strong\nlike today. So we don't know exactly everything. But one thing I remember is when\nHitler is coming on power, they send out most the Jews from Germany. And the Jews,\nthey come into Poland and lots coming to Warsaw and we was talking with them and\nthey tell us what kind of pogrom was there, you know, with the Kristallnacht and the\nbeating and the -- don't let live the Jews. The Jews have no right, the Jews was second,\neven not the second citizen. They couldn't work. They couldn't have absolute nothing. So\nwe know already there is trouble.",
        "A: When the -- first of all, the Polish people, the Polack, they keep the fight one month, 30\ndays. And this was a very, very badly because we was in Warsaw and I remember it was\nwhen shrapnel -- you know what the shrapnel -- it was maybe two, three windows away\nfrom our apartment. So in the house if you run down, all my mother she prepare for\neverybody, pullover, you know, something to put on clothes. So we run to the shelters.\nSo after maybe one or two hours later we go out. We went back to the apartment and we\neat what we have. We don't have much but we eat everything. And just the second day, I\nthink, they started again and it was fire bombs that fell in the house where we was living\nand everything was burned. And we don't have time to take nothing, nothing, we run out\njust what we have on our back. And everybody -- all these houses, all of Warsaw was\nburning. So we have nowhere to go. That's what I remember and it was on the same street\nit was a bath -- public bath. So we went there. We have a little. We took a little broom\nand my mother she was living, sleeping in the bath tub. That's what I remember. And\nwhen the Germans come in, the first thing what they do they start to give food for the\npeoples, soup and bread. So it was not bad. But after they doesn\u2019t \u2014 they start with the\nJews. No Jew have right to have bread. No Jew have nothing. And sometimes my mother\n-- she was blond, she wasn't very dark and so it was not so easy to recognize her like a\nJew, so she went and have bread. But sometimes, next day or two days later when she go\nagain, some Polack recognize her and they say, \u201cAh there\u2019s a Jew, there is a Jew.\u201d And\nthey throw her out so we didn't have nothing.",
        "A: That was in the bath house.",
        "A: All together, yeah. But as soon as the German come in, you know, they saw what is all\nthe difference. We were treated a little bit better because from the Jews, but we were\nalways scared to go out because it was not very, very pleasant. Not easy.",
        "A: I can't tell you exactly how long because--",
        "A: It was couple, maybe one or two weeks until we find a shelter very, very far out from\ntown and there we was maybe the whole time until -- this was 1939, and 1939, '40 the\nwinter was very, very hard winter so we stay there until 1t makes 1940. I think 1940. So, I\nwas, I was by Korezak.",
        "A: Not special, not special. No. Because first of all, I don't know, we was scared. If the\nPolish people was scared from the Germans, I don't know. But it was, there was a\ndistance between the Jewish people and the Polish people because the German they start\nalready -- the Jew. They take away everything from the Jews and they start to talk about\nthe ghetto and they start, you know, every Jew have to have, you know, the Jew shtern\u2019\u00ae.\nSo we -- there was a certain distance between the Polish and the Jews.",
        "A: You know, it's very hard to tell you, because the Polish people -- I going to tell you just\nonce. The antisemitic by the Polish people -- by the Polish woman there was already\ninject in the breast of from the woman and they give it to the children. But the children\ntook the breast from their mothers and start to give them the milk. They give them the\nhateness for the Jews. And it was all over, all over, every time you have always, you\nknow. There was terrible. Even sometimes you know this day I remember I stay up about\ntwo, three o'clock in the night to make a line to have a piece of bread. And when one\nPolack or somebody see a man what is a Jew, they threw him out. They kicked him out.\nThey beat him.",
        "A: That doesn't change. And I think nothing change today. I don't think something change\n\u00b0 star (Yiddish).\ntoday.",
        "A: Yes. Because, you know, everybody was friends because we was young, little one. I was\nvery young. So we don't see the difference but in the moment when we come just to the\nreason, the moment when the brain start to work, they change. They change today\nbecause maybe, like I say, maybe the churches, maybe the priest, maybe they put the\npoison in this brains. Maybe the brainwash you, I don't know what. They always know\nthat they pretend always, \u201cThe Jews they kill Christus -- Jesus Christus.\u201d What I have to\ndo with 2000 years with all this thing?",
        "A: I was sent to the orphanage because like I say we was poor. It was very hard and this\ntime, it was time when I have to go to school and it was maybe very hard to my mother,\nyou know. So somebody give her the address from this orphanage and she put me there.",

But I think they reach people\nfrom Warsaw who support themselves and this was the hope -- the director -- maybe for\nher was Dr. Janusz Korcezak. His really name is Henry Goldsmith. He was a doctor and\nthey have the Mrs. Wilczynska\u00ae, she was the director too because Dr. Korczak doesn\u2019t\nwas always there.

He talk about the flu, and there was a moment I have to cough and I\nforgot to cough and he say \u201cCough, cough, cough.\u201d And then I did it.

So when I come in they took me out from the school the\nChristian school and they send me to the Jewish school, not the Jewish, but it was a\npublic school but it was most Jews was there. That was there. So when we have vacation\nso we went to the kolonia\u2019\u2019 for two months and I have my little brother. So it was hard\nfor me. It was so nice. It was so good that I have food.

And I think, like I remember this day, it was six, six-thirty in the morning.\nWe have to be washed, clothed and we have a breakfast and everybody have to prepare to\ngo to school. We went to school so we went to different schools. And the school -- I\nremember the first couple years when the first I start from the third degree because I was\nalready-- so after school start one o'clock to six afternoon. So before we have breakfast\nand everybody have to make his bed and we have to clean the beds. And the -- we have\nto make the homeworks, and after we have lunch and then have to be dressed, shoes\nshined and we went to school. And we have some people, some children who start the\nschool at eight o'clock in the morning until one o'clock.",
        "A: Yes. Everybody have his responsibilities, they have to take care. First one, the oldest take\ncare the youngsters. So when you arrive about 10 years, 11 years and when a youngster\ncome in, so you take care of him. You teach him. You say the rules for the orphanage,\nyou know. Until a certain time you was responsible for him. If he do something that not\nsupposed to be, you be punished. Not him. But this guy, what was responsible for the\nchild, he was punished. But children thinks it was very, very -- but still -- and you know,\nwe have like supper all together. It was about seven o'clock supper and we could play.\nWe have ping pong. We have a piano and we have lessons every day you could. They\nteach us to play mandolin if you want to or the piano. They teach us Hebrew always\nwhen you want to. Nobody force you to do something. And you know, they have all kind\nof -- wintertime, we went out and we play with winter things and we have, we can go ice\nskating too. So it was very, very nice, very pleasant.

        "A: No, no. It was just Jewish.",
        "A: The ages were from six to 14; 13, 14 years.",
        "A: I was until the war, 1939, even I was longer. When I finished the school they find --\nsummertime and place I was working in an office. The office, the factory they make all\nkind office supplies like pens, like all these things, and I was in the office there and this\nwas summertime because my brother was in kolonia, so it was until 1939, until the\nGermans come in. When the German come in, so the owner from this company they give\nit over to peoples. I think they was swear in or something like that, and they go in. And\nwhen they swear and they go in, every Jew have to go out. We \u2014 I was laid off from\nthere. And at this time, like I say, I went back to the kolonia -- to the camp because in the\nwartime the peoples they steal the beds, and the mattress and the all the extras that we\nhave there. So we call the police and they went with the police, to the houses, and take all\nthe things back. So when the all the people, all the children going back to Warsaw\nbecause they think the school going to start. So we was three or five still there in the\ncamp to take care of that because we have -- it was a very, very big place. So this was\nuntil maybe -- \u2018til 1941. I remember it was, I remember it was a winter there to take care,\nand after the Germans come and they make a ghetto for this camp because there was lots\nof barracks there. They have like sleeping block. Block for the boys, sleeping block for\nthe girls, with a very big dining room. Have a kitchen. We have a very big washroom,\nyou know, to take showers and all this thing. And so Germans come in. They took this\naway and they make a ghetto. Because there was in town is called Wawer, and they took\nall the Jews to put them, and they make a ghetto. And they started again with the killing\nthere and with the shooting. All the things.

The Polish\npeople, they wouldn't accept him like a Jew because his name is -- Korczak is really\nPolish name -- but his name is, was Henry Goldsmith. This was his really, really, really\nname.

        "A: He was -- I remember once, like I say, he went once with him out in Poland and he had\non always his uniform -- because he was major in the army in the Polish Army. So you\nhave the uniform and I tell him, \u201cDoctor, please, why you put the uniform? It's so\ndangerous, it\u2019s so dangerous. Why you don't take them out?\u201d He say, \u201cOh, no, this is my\nuniform. I'm a Polish soldier. I'm going to keep the uniform.\u201d And I remember when we\nwas in the camp, some Polish people, women, come in and ask for the Doctor, \u201cDoctor,\nplease, my child is sick,\u201d or something like that. It doesn't make no question what kind, if\nit's Jew, if it's not Jew. What happened? He took -- I remember he had a little, little bag.\nHe took his little bag. He went to the people and doesn't charge, doesn't take any money.\nDon't take nothing. I don't think so, for this man he was any difference. He was -- he\ndon't think any difference if he\u2019s a Jew, if he\u2019s not a Jew -- a human being, a child. That's\nit.",

        "A: No, no, no. It was just my little brother. He wasn't in the orphanage. It was just in the\nvacation and camp there, but not special. He don't know his name, so they call him\n\u201cMaly\u201d? Icek\u201d -- the \u201cLittle Icek\u201d.

Just in the wartime in 1939 I was age, you know, to live there, but I couldn't come\nevery day or once, twice a week to eat no supper, the meals with the friends all together\nuntil 1939, until the war. That's when the war, yes, 1940, until the war. So they need help\nbecause the camp was empty. Everything was stolen and the children, they was too\nyoung to go. So they ask me if I would, I would and I say, yes, I -- and there was nothing\nto do there, the school. We have no more school because the Jews, you couldn't go\nnowhere. So I went and I was there and then -- in the camp until the Germans make a\nghetto. And after when they start with all this shooting and all this thing.",

My duty was after breakfast I have to go and, you know, we have passages\nbetween the beds, and I have, I think, two passages to clean, with the broom and the floor\nwas polished. That was my job and sometimes we change. So I have to wash the cups in\nthe morning after breakfast, and there was a girl, Ewa Zylberberg, she is no more there.",
        "A: Yes, young love.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. It depends. They have to, but most of the girls were working in the clothes shop. Not\nthe shop but, you know, like to sew the numbers, and sometimes they have, the socks to\nrepair and to see after our clothes. Something like that.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Everybody.",
        "A: Because not to mix them, because I say I could have maybe 10, 11, 12 years and there\nwas a little one who was six years who was maybe short, too high, so everybody have his\nclothes. So when they come from the washing, everybody knows this one was his.\nEverybody know there one was his and there was one was hers -- everybody have a\nnumber and my number was 46. So, you know, if you go to take showers you have to\nchange underwear, so the underwear was there. So I don't want to take somebody else\nbecause I know my number is 46. So I have to take number 46, the socks were 46.\nEverything in the -- everything was marked.",
        "A: There was girl and boys, yes. There was difference but, you know, we were -- they\nhandled us exactly the same thing. They have tables, you know, the table -- I think we\nwas six children, I think. So there was boys and girls together for the breakfast, for lunch\nor something like that. They was all together. There was no difference.",
        "A: We had different jobs. Even we went to school together, everything. Even in the same\nclass together. We was together but, you know, when it was time to go to bed, that's only\ndifference. That's it.",
        "A: I think it was one of the nice, this time in young. It was the nicest time, the best time in\nmy life -- this time, you know, if you don't have no war. We have everything. We don't\nhave no war. We have everything -- and you can\u2019t imagine -- something is coming like\nholidays. When I say \"holidays\" the Christian holidays. So we have -- we receive\noranges. It was something. You -- this was something in Poland for the war, an orange\nwas something. You can't dream about that. And this coming from Israel, you know, from\nPalestine. This time it was market; Jaffa oranges, bananas, all kind of fruit. Was\nsomething. It was amazing. Nobody can dream about this, in this time and it's as poor\nwho we was.",
        "A: Like I say, this guy, he doesn't rest. He run the whole days and like I say -- there was\nvery rich people in Poland, in Warsaw, and poor ones too. Was Jewish people, and they\nsupport and I think the Jewish organization from Israel to help him, lots of them. Because\nyou know Mrs. Stefa Wilczynska, I think she went to Israel. This was maybe '36 or '37, I\ndon't remember exactly, and the plan was to take all the orphanages, all the children to\nIsrael. But no time. And after, when I was there, you know, when the German come into\nWarsaw, they make a ghetto. How we come in it, I don't know. There I was in kolonia\nbut I know it was very, very big problem. My brothers, my sisters, my mother, she\ndoesn't have food, she doesn\u2019t \u2014 nothing to eat absolute nothing. So when they make the\nghetto in the camp. So I know a man, he was a butcher. So he come to me and say, \u201cYou\nknow what, if you want to make some money, you can earn some money. Like you have\na face nobody can say you a Jew. You take meat. You go to the ghetto. You sell the meat.\nI give you the address, everything and you have some money. You help me, you help\nyourself. You can help your family.\u201d So at certain time every day in the morning, about\nfive o'clock in the morning when the first streetcar pass -- because in the ghetto, Warsaw\nghetto, it was a streetcar passing by the ghetto, but nobody can go down. It pass just the\nghetto and it was from one Christian side to the other. Nobody can see go in, because\nthere was police there and they take care. So I have every day, every day I have my\nshoulder -- I have in back, and I have meat. I don't remember exactly, maybe 25 kilo, 30\nkilo, and I have, a band with the -- and this one I took it. I have it in my pocket. So, he\ntold me, he teach me, he say, \u201c\u201cYou know you go there and when the streetcar, it pass, it\nturn to the second street he slowed down, and this time you go down and you go in the\nhouse. You put on your things and you go, and this and this address. You said it, you\u2019re\ngoing to have it.\u201d But I say, \u201cbut the police!\u201d \u201cSo the police \u2014 don't worry, the police\ngoing to turn his back with the hand behind and you push in some money and doesn't see,\ndoesn't look at you.\u201d It was to every day, every day.",
        "A: No, no. Polish police.",
        "A: Every day I go down and it was very -- at home -- that was nothing to eat, nothing, and I\nhad to help them. And this one the of the reasons. That's why I help them I go over this\nmeat.",
        "A: No. I go out from the camp. I was on the Polish side, so I don't have no band. Off. I went\nto the streetcar. Off. I pay my streetcar and I have to take in correspondence and second\nticket. And when I come in the street and I take the streetcar, the same streetcar, it pass\nthe ghetto from the other side of the ghetto to the Polish side. So I go in and the\npoliceman was there with his hand behind his back, I give him some money. I jump\ndown. I put my armband and I was a Jew and nobody see. And when I sold the meat. I\ngive the meat, I have some money so I could buy something, potatoes or something like\nthat. I took it home. I give them and I go out and I wait exactly the same place. When the\nstreetcar is coming, take off my band, jump on the -- and I was a Polack again. One day\nin this ghetto there was a man, a butcher too, he was killing the cattles so he say, \u201cyou\nknow, I going to give you\u201d -- I remember very, very, well, \u201c25 zlotys.\u201d It was very, very,\nmuch money -- \u201cwhen you bring me my knife.\u201d You know, the man have a special knife\nto kill. So I say, \u201cokay.\u201d You know, young, no brains, I don't see the danger what I going\nto do. So he give me the address and when I go down with my meat, I sold the meat. I go\nto my mother, give her the money. So I go in this place and I think he going give me a\nlittle knife. She give me a knife like that, so I say, \u201cI promise, \u2018I\u2019m going to do it, \u2019'm\ngoing to do it.\u201d I put the knife -- 1t was in box -- I put it in here between my shirt and my\nbody. I put it there and exactly the same thing. Jump on the streetcar. But I don't go in the\nstreetcar. I was just in the front by the driver and when I was there, two Gestapo come\nout. They doesn't talk to me. I don't talk to them. I was quiet do nothing and I went \u2018til\nthe end on the streetcar until the terminus of the streetcar. And I bring him the knife. And\nhe was wondering, \u201cHow you do that?\u201d He give me 25 dollars. You can imagine what\nthis 25 dollars in this days, lots and lots of money. And when they start, you know, with\nthe Jews and they start to make trouble, and they start to take the Jews to the\nconcentration camps from Warsaw. And I say \u201cStop, I have to go.\u201d\nSo I run away and I was marching from Warsaw to Plonsk -- that's about 50 kilometers.\nThere, my older brother was there, my mother was there, and there it doesn't -- was, you\nknow, Poland was split. The Generalgouvernement'* and the annexed territory and there\nwas territory \u2014 so I want to go there, and I was walking two days and when I arrived there\nso. It was okay the first time. There was no ghetto there and they was living not so very\nwell, but okay. We was in little room, like here would be ten peoples, but it was okay and\nI start to work by turps'\u2019. You know what turps? Turps, that's when they take a piece out\nfrom the air and when it was dry the people burn that, like coal. And I was working very,\nvery, very hard when I was working there and I --",
        "A: Yes.\n'* German established administrative territory encompassing portions of Poland that were not incorportated into the\nReich after the German invasion of Poland in 1939.\n> turpentine",
        "A: Oh, God.",
        "A: First of all, they took all the Jews.",
        "A: In the ghetto, exactly what happened in the ghetto, I can't tell you. I was not very long in\nWarsaw in ghetto, but I know everytime -- when I come there, I see people lying outside\nstarving. The German come in, they laughing, you know, they make all kind of pictures\nfrom the poor peoples and it was is very, very hard to explain you. It's not a life. The\npeople you have -- the people are dead, all dead. You don't have nothing there, nothing\nthere. No food, cold. Peoples was outside begging you for pieces of bread and some, they\nhave children they go in the past the wall, you know, to the Polish side to take something,\nto have some potatoes and when they was chased from the Germans, they kill them, they\nshoot them, I -- you know, I can't explain to you. I can't explain.",
        "A: I saw, yes. I remember once like I said, you know, one time I have my meat on my back\nand I have to go, and I couldn't go down because they have a German soldier, German\ngendarme was in the tram. I couldn't go down. I have to go \u2018til the other side. When I\narrived there it was just in cemetery, in Jewish cemetery. To go to the ghetto, I have to\npass the cemetery and I arrive in the middle from the cemetery. They start to shoot. I\nhear, you know with the machine gun, and I was there. So I said, \u201cNow 1s finished.\u201d So,\nyou know in this time there was so many dead people, because by the Jews you have no\nright to make the grave before you have the body at the cemetery and the preparer of the\nholes. One thing that I have to do is I have to jump there and I have lie the whole night\nbetween two deads -- and I hear what the shooting, what the machine guns around and\nthey was walking over my head. So you can imagine. It was the whole night there in this\nhole.\nTape #2",
        "A: It was the Jewish police to take care and sometimes they make -- they took the peoples go\nout from the ghetto, you know, with the Germans to work. All kind of work. Like\nwintertime to clean the snow, clean the highways and all kind of things like that. And\nsometimes they took them to work, you know, to make the uniforms for the Germans.\nBut there was nobody have the chance to have something and it was very, very, very,\nhard in Warsaw. In the street and every place, you have dead peoples, and peoples\nbegging. It was, you know, horrible to see. Really is very, very hard to explain. It's just --\nI can't believe that I passed there. I saw all this. It's no human nature can see this. You\nknow, I saw lots of things but it was, it's really terrible. I can't understand, you know,\nbecause the Germans they are cultivated people and they couldn't do things like that. I\ncan't understand it. I can\u2019t, I can't understand it.",
        "A: Yes, school. Nobody school, you know, when sometimes you have the teachers, the\nJewish teachers were teaching in the school before the war. They're teaching their own\nchildren. They can do that for nothing. Nobody want to pay. And every time when the\nJewish community, the community when the German make and they\u2019re always -- they\nask for money and they ask the peoples to work and they send the peoples, you know, to\nthe different camps to break the stones to make highways, and all kind of things. Because\nthe Germans, they was the was the worst. The work -- they need the uniforms. They need\neverything, so the Jews was very cheap labor. So they took the peoples and that's it.\nSometimes, I remember, my brother tell me once he was \u2014 they took him in school, in a\nbig school, and they give him brush, teeth brush to wash the floors. And there was the\nladies\u2019 room, they have to take off pants and to clean it. It was terrible.",
        "A: Nothing. You have sometimes, but you need money for clubs. We have some clubs. We\nhave some singers. We have some players. But you need money to get in. Where you\ngoing to take the money?",
        "A: There was nothing, most of nothing. It was very hard for the living, very hard. And after\nthey start to evacuate the ghetto, to take to Majdanek, to Treblinka, and the peoples they\nstart to know they kill these people. So it was the ghetto uprising. Maybe you remember.\nMaybe you hear about that. It was too something terrible and this people inside, they\nbegging outside they ask to help. They ask the Russian, they a and the American, they\nask the German. I think the English to help to send some weapons, send some\nammunition. Nothing is coming, absolute nothing, nothing, nothing. So what they do?\nThey kill out -- they killed everybody and they burn. The whole ghetto was destroyed.\nEverything was destroyed.",

        "A: They couldn't help.",
        "A: There was Resistance, yes, and the underground too, but the underground was from the\nPolish people, and some people, some Jews, they was escaped from the ghetto, escape\nfrom the uprising. They went to the partisans, you know. And that's all, I think.",
        "A: The what?",
        "A: Inside the ghetto, but not in this time. It was when they start to evacuate this ghetto\nbecause nobody, nobody can imagine they going to send peoples -- they going to burn\ntheir whole family. They are going to kill their whole family, and the killing going on and\ngoing on and going on, until they come, until to Warsaw. There was the uprising, but\nwhat could they help? They had nothing, no rifles, no absolute nothing. They have little\nbit, but absolute nothing.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: You know, when we was in shelter after, when the Germans come in, and because the\napartment we was living was burned up. We had absolute nothing. So we went to the\nbath house and we find a shelter, but when the Germans come in we have to move from\nthere to the ghetto. I was with Korczak at this time. This was in 1940, '41, I think.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: At this time I was -- this was in summer. I think in summertime they move from Warsaw\nto the camp. And they ask me, too, if I want to go to the camp. I say, \u201cyeah,\u201d because I\ndidn\u2019t have nothing to do there, and they start the ghetto in Warsaw. All the Jews have to\ngo to the ghetto \u2014 towards the ghetto, and this time even my mother say, \u201cWhat you\ngoing to do here? Go to camp.\u201d I went to camp and how to come to the ghetto, I don't\nknow. I know once, you know, they give me the address. I knew they was in the ghetto\nand there was very, very bad situation. Very bad situation. They was hungry. They have\nnothing to eat, and \u201cthis,\u201d I decide \u201cthis time.\u201d So I have possibility to help them and this\nwas my opportunity to help them, risk my life to help them.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes. I have to go and I was feeling very angry because I saw the Polish people, the Polish\nboys in my age they running free. They eating. They have everything, and I have to\nhiding myself all over. Take care. Doesn't talk, doesn't speak, doesn't go nowhere. You\nkeep yourself. You just -- you know, because don\u2019t forget one thing, \u201cYou a Jew, you a\nJew, you don\u2019t have no right to live.\u201d",
        "A: I pretend I wasn't a Jew, but one thing I know. I say to myself, \u201cIf this was finished, I\ndon't want to be any more a Jew. I don't know why they hate me. I don't do nothing. I\ncan't understand. I don't want to -- I want to be free. I want to eat. I want a piece of bread\nlike everybody. I don't want to hate you.\u201d This was in my mind.",
        "A: Before the concentration camp -- maybe not. When I escaped from Warsaw, I went, you\nknow, to my family. There I know there was Jew. It was hard for me too, sometimes I\nthink about not to be Jew, but I born a Jew, I couldn't help it.",
        "A: I don't talk to nobody. I was scared, very scared, you know. Each time, if somebody\nrecognize me or what, because first of all, with the meat. Second, if a Jew, they kill me --\nthey kill me one hundred per cent. Not scared \u2014 yes, I was scared but it was, I say, look,\nlike what they can do to me? Kill me, that\u2019s it. Not kill, but hang me? That's it, you know.\nBecause they say if you\u2019re a Jew, a bullet too expensive. I couldn't help.",
        "A: Every time a couple hours, but really long time, no.",
        "A: No. I don't think so. One thing, I was very happy when I went out. I feel a little bit, I'm\nfree a little bit, but outside. But inside, you know, my heart was beating very, very --\nevery time when I was in gendarme -- in the German gendarme I said, \u201cOh! You finished,\nyou finished.\u201d Like the same thing when I have the knife in my back and why I go on this\nstreetcar. Just the two Gestapo come in, and I don't want to say they followed me, but in\nthe way \u2014 they went in the same way that I was. Believe me, you know, if I'm today alive,\nI don't have a heart attack this time, oh, I was very, very strong. So when I come in I give\nhim this knife. I say to myself, \u201cIf I can do that, I can do something else.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. So I was there and so, you know, they have some peoples in the ghetto, but\n'\u00ae Kolonia Rozyczka\nthey have family in Warsaw and they was young peoples, and they ask me if I want to\nbring them to the ghetto. And I say, \u201cLook, I can\u2019t go.\u201d So I go with this peoples. They\npay me but it doesn't pay very much. They pay me just, you know, they pay me just a\ndinner or something like just for survival, but nothing special. I make it because I can\nhelp. But nothing special. But to understand this, that the shooting and the killing there\nand my family was already dead. As I say, \u201cStop, is enough, you have to run away from\nhere.\u201d So I go away and, you know, it was about 70 kilometers. I went there and I was\nwandering two days without food, because when I come on the border, was -- on one side\nwas the Polish police, and on the other side was the German police and, \u201cHalt, where are\nyou going?\u201d \u201cI go working to the farm to keep the potatoes,\u201d because it was not me\nalone, but some Polish people did traveling, too. So I listen to him. I say, \u201cI go for the\npotato.\u201d So, \u201cI go for the potato\u201d and I was a young boy, so they let me pass. And I have\nsome couple money. They took away the money but I don't care. I went, and we have to\npass a bridge and I say, just two Germans gendarmes. And they go just to me, and I say\n\u201cAy, ay, two gendarmes, it\u2019s finished with you.\u201d But behind me was an old woman with a\nlittle boy and they stopped the woman, and I pass.\nAnd I come on the road and it was two gendarmes and they threw out a family from this\nhouse -- maybe they want to take the house -- and they threw out and they say \u201cHey,\ncome here.\u201d And they say, \u201chelp,\u201d and I help these people to put on the wagon. And I\nremember it, was a bread, a big, big bread and the bread fell down and the hard side fell\ndown. So I take the hard side, I put it in my jacket and -- because eight days I don\u2019t eat\nno piece of bread -- and I help them, but this piece I hide for me. And I sit on the wagon\nand they bring me to a little point because they turn and I have to go straight and I go\nstraight. And I go to the farm and I ask, \u201cMaybe you have place to sleep?\u201d So it's an old\nfarm. They say, \u201cLook, I have one place but here you can sleep -- there is a lady laying in\nbed -- 1f you want.\u201d So the lady in one side and I was on the other side. The whole night I\neat this bread. The next day, in the morning, I say, \u201coff.\u201d I go to the town and I was in the\nfamily. But in certain time the peoples from this town, they need papers. I don't have no\npapers and the paper was, you know, the fingerprint and this one is the Bloody Sunday.\nThe Gestapo come in, 1n this town and they throw out -- everybody have to go out, and\nthey start to control the papers. I don't have no papers. My brother doesn't have papers. If\nhe don't have no papers, so they have to start to hit the stakes over the head, over the\nback, all over. Because if you don't have paper, you have to go on this side. If you are\ngoing to see my brother \u2014 he has here, on his lip, was open from hitting him.",
        "A: Plonsk, yes. And they put us and they going to ask you for the bloody Sunday. I'm going\nto tell you about this. They put everyone on a field. I don't know, maybe a thousand\npeoples, on one field and we stay there two nights, one night or two nights, I don't\nremember. And they put us in a camp. They will call Pomiechowek and this was a really\ndeath camp. And there we was, I think, six week. I can't explain the trouble what they\nhave there. It was those barracks, stone barracks and was so many peoples. We have to\nlay down on the floors like the herring, you know, in the tins. If one want to turn,\neverybody have to turn. Soon it was dark until morning. You have to stay there. It was\nvery, very hard, but one thing it was not German, I think, 1t was Germans but it was the\nSA. Maybe you hear about SA -- Sturmabteilung'\u2019 -- that's when the Germans with war,\nthe brown shirts and with the Hakenkreuz'\u00ae. It was very, very bad peoples. There was,\nthere was Volksdeutsche'\u201d, it was most of the Polacks, but there was maybe Germans, I\ndon't know what kind. It was very, very bad and they was very bad peoples. They hit us.\nWe don't have no food. And I can't explain what kind of trouble what -- I don't know how\nwe survived there. There was hundred and hundred of people and, you know, we couldn't\nhave no washroom, nothing. So they make a grave in hole with a stake and everybody,\nwomen, men all together, we have to go there, if we need to go. And sometimes a passing\nGerman push in. I can't explain. And was always one, he pass in the barrack and tell,\n\u201cYou stay up!\u201d When you stay up is okay. When you kind of stay up so fast, so he have,\n\u201cYou sick. Take out to kill.\u2019 And they shoot every day, every day, you hear the guns.\nThey shoot these people something terrible. And my little brother, Erwin he was there,\nbut he escaped. And how I come out from there, I don't know. I don't know, I don\u2019t\nremember. I know once my brother told me I was sick. I had typhus and all these people\nthat have typhus they have to be killed. And I remember one time I was laying on the\noutside to wait until they going to shoot me. So I know once my brother, the oldest one,\ncome and take me on his shoulder and put me in a wagon. They run away and they pass,\nand we have to go, they send us back to Warsaw to the ghetto. Before coming to Warsaw\nto the pass the, the front, they make a big fire, and all these people have to pass this fire.\nThe other side there was the ghetto, the free, but we have to pass this fire. We have so\nmany -- you feel it. You pass on the people that first down. They couldn't survive.",
        "A: Through the fire.",
        "A: Was a big fire and my brother, I don't remember, but my brother told me because we\npass. I know I have smell the burn, smell the burn.",
        "A: Walk the fire, pass the fire to go in the ghetto, back to the Warsaw ghetto. And when we\narrived in the Warsaw ghetto, I don't remember exactly what happened, but once I was\n'\u201d storm troopers (German)\n'S Swastika (German)\n\u201d ethnic German (German)\nlaying on the floor, and I was in a hospital and they wash myself and they put me in a bed\nin the hospital. And there was maybe one or two days and I start to cry, because they put\nsomebody in the bed with me. And so there was a nurse come in and she ask me, \u201cWhy\nyou crying?\u201d So I say, \u201cI don't know, they put somebody in maybe he have typhus. I\u2019m\ngoing to have too.\u201d So she say, \u201cWhat you think what are?\u201d and they let me there a\ncouple days. A couple days, maybe one week, and when I was already health more, so I\nwent out and I remember it was just a wagon come in with stones. The men, they ask me,\n\u201cHey, you want to help me to put down the stones?\u201d I say, \u201cyes.\u201d They give me 50 cent\nand I buy pickle, a sour pickle. And I found my brother. We don't have no place to go.\nWe don't have no place to sleep. We don't have no money. Absolute nothing. So my\nbrother told me, \u201cWhat you going to do?\u201d So, you know, in Poland in the houses there\nwas the stoves and they have in the ovens, they have the doors. There was like a cup and\nthe houses that was destroyed. So we took that and we sold it. We have some money. We\npay a guy \u2014 and we go out from the ghetto and we have just enough to pay to buy a\nbread, because we want to go back to the same town where my mother and my sister.",
        "A: Yeah. And we have just enough money to buy a bread, but from there we have to pass a\nbridge to the station and from the station we have to take a little train to, I don't\nremember. And this town a little bit closer to Plonsk. So we go to the, into the train. We\nhave already tickets -- no. There was -- we was waiting outside because the train --\nsomebody come I don't know, it was a Polack, I don't remember, a woman or a man \u2014 and\nshe say, \u201cDon't go in because they can recognize you, you a Jew and they going to send\nyou back or they going to arrest you.\u201d So I say, \u201cBut we want to go.\u201d So he or she, I\ndon\u2019t remember, \u201cGive me your money. I will go buy tickets.\u201d So we give him the money\nand he buy tickets for us and we have the tickets. We go in the train. We sit on the train\nand this train start to go. So he\u2019s coming, the control man for the ticket, so he looks, \u201cAre\nyou Jews? I going to call the Gestapo.\u201d So I start to cry, \u201cWhy you going to call the\nGestapo? We don't do nothing. We want to go.\u201d \u201cNo, no, you Jews. You don't have the\nright to go. You don't have the right to be here.\u201d So I say, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d So he say,\n\u201cPay me.\u201d So I say, \u201cWhat can I pay you? We don't have no money. We don\u2019t have\nnothing.\u201d One thing my brother say, \u201cMaybe you going to give him a gown.\u201d I remember\nI had a gown for my sister, a nightgown. So I tell him, \u201cLook, I have a nightgown. If you\nwant to, I give you the nightgown.\u201d He said, \u201cyes.\u201d I have to go to the end train, take out\nthe nightgown and give him the nightgown. So, he let us go. So we went a couple miles\nand we go down. We don't have no money. We don't have nothing to eat. We have to\nlive. We have to do something. So actually, you know what, we go here we go begging.\nSo I took to the house and somebody give us some beets. So we have beets. We eat the\nbeets and we sleep outside. And we stay and we go again, and they stay and we go again.\nThis time we walking again. We want to go to this town and it's very hard. It's not so\neasy, SO --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: About 70 kilometers and we was running with the train, maybe 10 or 15 kilometers. But\nthere was somebody. He make travel past the peoples. So we ask him, maybe he want to\ntravel, to help us to travel. So he say, \u201cYes, but you have to pay me.\u201d But we have\nnothing. So I remember when I was in camp I receive a pair of boots from UNRRA\u201d or\nthe Jewish Committee*\u2019 -- I don't remember. So I say, \u201cYou know, that I have boots. I\ncan give you -- you take my boots.\u201d And we past there. And we was together certain time\nand after they took us to the concentration camp, so they start there with the\nconcentration camp. Exactly the same thing, you know.",
        "A: I don't know. I know it take place -- one second, I think it take 1n two or three places in\nPlonsk and it was a couple kilometers was in town, the same thing, the same thing. That\u2019s\nthe Bloody Sunday.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: What can I do? I have to. I can't help. And then after when we was the last ghetto the last\ntime. So, you know, the propaganda was from the German and they say, \u201cDon't worry.\nThe oldest people, your old people, you're going to work.\u201d This was the propaganda.\n** United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\n*! American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\n\u201cTook what you can, warm clothes most important. Took it to a Jew and you're going to\nwork, okay? The youngest people, they are going to work. The older people they're going\nto keep the children and the household.\u201d So this was the reason. Most the Jewish people,\nthey go, but nobody can imagine -- but when, you know, they going die it was already\ntoo late. They're already there. They couldn't help. So first I know when they start to send\ntickets. \u201cThis family, this family, this family.\u201d",
        "A: In Plonsk. Now, I told you Warsaw was already liquidated. It wasn't completely\nliquidated but is started.",
        "A: This was 1941, 1942.",
        "A: They start, I think, but the uprising was 1n, I think --",
        "A: '43. So they start -- first of all, in Warsaw, there was a big ghetto. There was lots of\npeople and there lots of Jews was working for the Germans and the factories, like the\ntailors for the uniform. And so this when they start already to evacuate.",
        "A: And to evacuate it. And first one -- the policy from the Germans they say, \u201cWhy do we\nhave to kill them? They are going to kill themselves.\u201d And that's true. The people\nstarving on the streets, no food. In the wintertime the people was freezing completely,\ndead freezing, dead. They have nothing. So they don't care. So they just to help so they\nevacuated to Treblinka. And Treblinka, soon they come in and the older people, the\nwoman, the older men and children, they put them on the trucks. The trucks come into\nthe crematorium to say, \u201cYou go to bath. You going to take a shower.\u201d But the shower is\ngas. That's it. And there in Plonsk they start to send people to get this family and this\nfamily and that family. They have to be at this time and that time, and that time they have\nto be at the station. On the grand Platz\u201d was the place they have to be there. At this time\nmy mother and the younger brother and the two sisters -- my sisters receive the paper.\nMy brother and I were supposed to stay there, but -- and they took them back. So after,\n** plaza (German)\nyou know, he\u2019s coming, an officer and he say, \u201cWho want to go to have place? Who want\nto go?\u201d So, I say to my brother, \u201cWhat they going to do here?\u201d The ghetto was -- this\ntown was three-quarter empty. \u201cWhat we going to do? Come, we're going to work. Come\nwe're going, too.\u201d So we going and this was when the family was together. My mother,\nsister, my little brother was together until they send us to Auschwitz and this took, I\nthink, three or four days just traveling.",
        "A: We was packed. Peoples was crying, you know, packed. No food, no water. Absolute\nnothing. But the one chance it was in, I think, 1n fall, so it doesn\u2019t was very hot. So you\ndon't feel this so thirsty like in summertime and that helped, a lot. So we arrived, I\nremember we arrived in Auschwitz. It was at night or very early in the morning, and\nwhen we go out from the trains they start to beating and to shoot. So I say to my brother,\nI say, \u201cCome, we have to go fast so we don't be beat.\u201d So we was all together and he is\ncoming, the German, and they start, \u201cMen, and women on the other side.\u201d",
        "A: No, no. We know we want to go to work. And when we went in the train, so, I think, I\nwas young, but I think peoples in mind couldn't imagine this finish. We go to death.",
        "A: No, we didn't have -- like I say nothing. They say always, \u201cDon't worry. Everything be\nfine. You go to work.\u201d But when we was on the train, the train was blocked, nobody can\nopen. But now it was too late. But for me, I don\u2019t know, I couldn't believe, could happen\nthings like that. So I say to myself, \u201cThey told us, we going to work, okay? We're going\nto work.\u201d But who couldn't believe from, we know. Every day the German was a very\npolite people. The German was very [unintelligible] people. Who couldn't imagine. They\nimagine and kill machine like that. It's impossible. But then we go to -- when we arrive in\nAuschwitz and they separate men and women, children with women. So I say, \u201cOh, this\nsmell not good.\u201d And coming Mengele\u201d and he come in and he start, \u201cMen\u201d -- all like\nthe young men, like I and my brother, healthy, from the regular to the bigger \u2014 so \u201cright.\u201d\n\u201cLeft\u201d and my little brother have to go the women. And like I say, I was feel like\nsomething wrong. So we was there and we was the first of the first, because I say, always\nyou have to be careful not to be beaten. If not, they kill you with stakes, with pipes, with\nrubber, with all this thing? So I he come and, you know, the German was like that. He\nwas tall. He jumped between his legs and come in my side, and I was there with a friend -\n> Josef Mengele (1911-19787), German doctor and SS officer.\n- my, my friend live today, is in Toronto-- they lift him little bit and he started to look,\nstart to -- it's too late. They don't see him and we was together.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I recognize him after because he came to our camp. I saw him many time because when I\nwas already in camp, they make selection, you know, about selection. Yeah, the one have\nto die. The one have to go to the gas chamber. So we have to unclothed, take out the\nclothes and we have to pass like in barrack and the barrack was -- it doors. There was two\ndoors. One there was no the block, the chief block and they have to get the prisoners first\nin the second, so it was to the -- so we have to go out from one door and down, and\nMengele was there and we pass by him and he look at you, and the chief on the block,\nyou have -- a card -- you don't have no names. We have just a number and he have the\ncard, you know, and we pass. So I know. I see him many times and peoples out there,\nthey know him before, \u201cthis one is Dr. Mengele,\u201d and so...",
        "A: A lot of shouting and separation and crying and all kind of things. And after you pull\ntogether and after we went on march to Auschwitz and went into concentration camp.\nFrom the station in Auschwitz we went to concentration. The first thing that we saw, you\nknow, they bring us just on the wires, electrified wire, doubled wires, and we saw some\npeople hanging on, so he say, \u201cYou see that? In case somebody want to escape, he going\nto have exactly the same thing.\u201d So they put us, you know -- first, there was outside many\ncouple hours. After we have to take off our clothes. We went to the barber to cut the hair\ncompletely, and showers. After the showers we have to go to the room. And they make\nthe numbers, and they made the numbers, you know, the numbers with little point and\nthey, I don't know what with, a pen or something like that. And they make the numbers.",
        "A: Oh, yes. But a couple days later it was okay.",
        "A: To work?",
        "A: At this time, no. At this time I thought I was finished. This time I was finished and the\npeoples, you know, because it was -- already people was prisoners in Auschwitz and this\nI always say, \u201cDon't think you go some place to work. Once you can go, you see the\nchimney there?\u201d We saw the chimney -- the smell, the smell. \u201cThis what I told you. See\nthe chimney? That's where the crematorium.\u201d The first time, I didn't know what he mean\nand he, \u201cburn the people.\u201d And so I ask, \u201cBurn alive?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, no, no. First,\nall the people go in the gas chamber and from the gas chamber they go in there.\u201d",
        "A: The what?",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "A: What year? I'm sorry. It was beginning '42, I think, beginning '42. Yes.",
        "A: The two brothers, yes. And we still together. No food, nothing. And we have to go to the\ntailor room with the numbers and they give us numbers to put on. They give us the\nuniform. Some uniform is too long, too short, and they took away the shoes. They give\nyou some wood shoes, and here was some stuff, tissue, and wood shoes, they are very,\nvery hard to walk. And one moment we lose my brother, the older one. The little one is\nstill with me. And we was there in Auschwitz about three days, I don't remember exactly\nhow long. It always was the same. We have to go to tailor. You have to put your number\non your pant and on your jacket, and they took us to Buna I.G. Farben district. And this\nwas about three kilometers from Auschwitz. So we go there. It was, I think, at night. I\ndon't remember exactly because we have to pass the town in Auschwitz. Maybe he\ndoesn't want the people to see the prisoners. I don't know exactly. And there we go to\nBuna there. We arrive there and we went to quarantine.",
        "A: Quarantine.",
        "A: Quarantine. They think maybe we are sick or we have some typhus or something like\nthat. So if somebody going to be sick, they have to kill all the peoples. So we was there\nsix week. It was very, very bad. Every day we have to make some exercise. Every day it\nwas the same thing. The hanging and killing and beating and every day. Sometimes, you\nknow, they hang us with the hands in the back and they hang us just like that. And, you\nknow, who was the chief, it was the murder -- German murder. No one else but the\nmurderers. But the Germans, they was maybe condemned to death. The place to kill\nthem, they put them in concentration camp and it was the chief of the Jew, from the\nJewish Haftlinger**. And this was six weeks there, and after six week, we have to go to\nwork. They send us off and we went to the camp where all the peoples. And maybe this\ntime the whole camp was maybe six, 800 people. And we when there just to build this\nconcentration camp, and we start to work there and we make the wire and the barracks,\nbecause every time when the camp was ready, they was coming always new prisoners\nfrom all the countries. From Poland, from Belgium, from Czechoslovakia, from all over,\nall over. And then in the end, I think there was about 15 or 18,000 prisoners there in this\ncamp. And there was a, maybe you read about the I.G. Farben industry, and they have a\nfactory. They make all for the war. They make ammunition. They make even gasoline for\nthe planes.",
        "A: It was a plant.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: No you take -- some peoples was working you know in the coal mine. So from the coals,\nthey take out and make the gasoline and they make all the things, and we build it all\ntogether. And it was exactly the same thing. And after, they bring over there maybe, you\nknow -- in the end it was in this I.G. Farben maybe one million people was working\nthere. All kind of nationality you can imagine. Even the war prisoners from Americans,\nEnglish peoples, French peoples, all of the soldiers that was taking --\n** Prisoner (German)",
        "A: We work always. The construction take about two, three years to build up everything,\nthat the kind of work. And it was very, very hard. Every day we lose lots and lots of\npeoples dying there, by working very hard job. Very hard labor -- very hard job. You\nhave to stay up about five o'clock in the morning and it was Appellplatz\u201d\u2019, cold winter.",
        "A: It was a very, very big place and there was the barracks, and in each barracks was the --\ndepends, 100, 150 men and we have to go up, you know, in the morning. Sometimes they\ngive you a little bit of coffee, water, and you have to go to the Appell.",
        "A: They count so many, so many. They have to. They know exactly how many peoples. And\nit was a block -- block one to 53. I don't remember. And each block you have so many, so\nmany peoples, and so we have to stay to five and they count every block in the morning,\nso much and so many, and they look on the list. If exactly number people what there are,\neven dead. Even somebody die, we have to take him out, you know, to -- he count like\nprisoner. It was very hard in the beginning. I was \u2014 you know first, I don't understand\nGerman at this time and they talk always German. And like soldiers, so in the morning\nwhen the German pass, so you know, they give orders the \u201cMiitzen ab!\u201d\u201d\u201d -- that mean\ntake off your. And first of all, you have to be straight out, it was two words, it was very\nhard to understand for me, \u201crichtet euch!\u201d*> You have to be, stay nicely, and you -- after\nyou say, you can stay. Just like that and this -- I was mixing up. I make always upside\ndown. So you can imagine. They beat me so much until in the end I understand already\nwhat they mean.",
        "A: The what?",
        "A: Well, you know to take respect for the SS.",
        "A: They was the rules. Like you say, because Jews don't have right to live. The all day, you\n* roll call grounds (German)\n*\u00b0 roll call (German).\n*7 Hats off! (German)\n*\u00ae Straighten up! (German)\nlisten, you hear, just what; \u201cIhr verfluchte Jude,\u2019 dirty Jew, you Christus, you murder,\u201d\nand all kind of things. I can't remember all the things, but in the end they say always, you\ndon't hear about, we was used to that. Okay. You talk because maybe in an hour they\ngoing to shoot us. Maybe in an hour we going to be dead. So we don't care about that.\nWe never, never, never one minute never think about survive. And my, my policy, and I\nsay always, \u201cI have to do all mine better. I have to try to survive.\u201d And we was this\nstruggling there was until January 18, January 1945 and 18 and 17, January, so we start\nalready, we listen already, you know, the bombardment. So we say you, \u201cOh, oh,\nsomething's wrong.\u201d and before you -- yes -- before you know, it was already alarm, fleet\nalarm the bomb, the American flyers coming and the Russian coming at night, American\nday. And was all day, you know, they destroy completely, the I.G. Farben. But the\ncrematorium and the gas chamber, they never destroy because Churchill\u00b0\u201d say this one is\nnot a military object.",
        "A: The what.",
        "A: So maybe I don't have to say that.",
        "A: Yes. We have all kind of work. First one was the old building was in concrete, okay. And\nI remember it was, trains come in with stones and sand because 1s not like today with the\nbig trucks with the mixer. We have to make ourselves, so my job was to put on the\nwagon stones. So much, so much stones, and so much, so much sand and there was two\nof them. We have to push the wagon to the machine. We have to turn the machine and to\nput the stones with the sand in a mixer. Not a mixer, but it was in back in big box and the\nguy what was working the machine was a German guy. He put the cement and he lift this\nin the machine and they mix it. On the side was again two peoples like we was and the\ncement, the concrete fall in and we have to go with them to the building to the builders\nthat build and -- to put like today, you know, the concrete fall down and they make it. It\nwas a very, very hard job. This was my job, my job, and we have to go fast and\nsometimes the cement, they use very much cement and sometimes cement is coming, you\n\u00bb\u00b0 you damn Jew (German)\n*\u00b0 Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965); British statesman and author who served as Prime Minister during the\nSecond World War.\nknow, with trains. The same thing, except they coming at night at this time.\nSo, what do we hear, \u201cJuden raus\u2019\u2019,\u201d where we have to out from the block and five they\ncount so much, so much, and we have to go to take out the cement from the trains, from\nthe wagons. And I was, this time I was maybe, I don't remember, maybe 16 years, 15, 16\nyears and you have to, you know, put on your shoulder in back of cement sack, and it was\nover 100 pounds. And you have to run with that and sometimes when the Germans when\nthe SS, they outside they start, \u201cschnell, schnell, schnell\u2019\u201d.\u201d They want to go home so\nthey put two and you can't run, so they hit us with the rifles. And one German, he hit\nmany, many times and he smashed my kidney, and they have to take out the kidney. So I\nhave just one kidney. But what can you do? I couldn't say nothing because if somebody\ndoesn't listen, if somebody fall down with \u2014 so they call \u201cHey, take him.\u201d If not, if he\ndoesn't want to, so he shoot him on the spot. You have them carried to the camp dead. So\nwhat -- I couldn't do nothing.",
        "A: But, no the kidney was removed after the war.",
        "A: But, you know, I was suffering from the kidney in camp, but I was scared to go to the\ndoctor at the camp because they send me to the gas chamber. But this one was in the\nbeginning. But after -- so when you are already an old prisoner, you know a little bit the\nrules. So I couldn't manage to not go to this work first of all. Second one, you know, the\ncamp was already built and the buildings was already built so, you know, we don't make\nany cement. But in this time they start to make like professionals work. Electricians,\ncarpenters, painting, because all everything have to be paint and you -- they make some\npeoples -- they have to work for the -- to put on the Skelett\u00ae\u2019, you know, for the building\nthat\u2019s from the ironwork, you know, the big things. So, you know, it was very, very hard,\nbut we don't have to. We don't have to carry the cement, all this thing and first of all, and\nsecond, I was already an old prisoner so I know this rule. So we can manage, you know,\nto not to work so hard. So I manage to be an electrician.\n*! Jews, out! (German)\n** quickly! hurry! (German)\n*> framework (German)\nTape #3",
        "A: Yeah, by the cement. When I went it was already a longer, little bit longer then camp. So\nwe Start to know the rules first of all. Second one, when I was 79,000 but at this time,\nafter -- first of all, when the building was already finished. We was--",
        "A: Any kind of building. There was many buildings and they start to bring in from the east\nlike civil peoples. [Technical conversation] So -- and this time, this was maybe two years\nafter, maybe, they start to bring in all kind of peoples Ostarbeiter**. That mean the people\nfrom east, like the French workers from Belgium, civilian workers. They was going in\nfreiwillig\u2019\u2019. That mean they go for themselves because they make big propaganda \u201cCome\nto work for Germany. You going to be fine. You going to be good.\u201d And the same thing\nwas from Poland, from France, from Belgium, from the Russian, from Ukraine, from all\nover, all over Europe and this Buna works and this Buna I.G. Farben industry they make\nwas at least one million of workers. We was in the concentration camp already, I don't\nknow exactly, maybe 12 or 15,000, but you have and -- after this coming all the prisoners\nfrom war, from the English people, the American soldiers, the French sol-- you know\nthey -- what was the prisoner from the war. There was -- they have on the back marked\n\u201cpy\u201d prisoner of war. There was two there so, you know, this work, it was already -- I\ndon't want to easy, but it was a little bit easy. And at this time I was already an old\nprisoner so I know the rules. So I don't want to work. It's too hard and I think sometimes\nin my mind I say myself, \u201cThe world have to finish once. Maybe, we going to be free or\nmaybe we going to be dead.\u201d So I say, \u201cI have to try to survive long as I can so I try not\nto work too much.\u201d And I become in a Kommando\u201d\u2019. A Kommando, that mean every\nprisoner was to the Kommando, and Kommando does what kind of work? Some people\nwas electricians, painters, was builders, was carpenters and I was younger this time, so I\ndon't have no trade. So I have a Kapo\u201d\u2019, you know, the Kapo. That mean it was he\norganize, not organize but he take care on a certain group of people for the work, like a\nmanager for work. So I ask him, \u201cMaybe you want to take me to your job,\u201d because it\nwas not so hard.\n** eastern worker (German); forced laborer from Eastern Europe.\n*\u00b0 Voluntarily (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 In a later conversation the interviewee clarified that he had meant to say \u201cPW.\u201d\n\u00b07 commando (German)\n*$ Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners.\nSo I was a Kommando 120 \u2014 800 \u2014 28. I was electric Kommando specialist, you know,\nthe work was already little bit easy. First off all, I don't have to carry nothing but, you\nknow, sometimes we have a pliers. Sometimes, you have a case and box with tools or\nlittle wire or little cable, and even when we have to pull cables there was a special\nKommando, Kommando nine and they pull the cables, and there was that Kommando.\nThere the peoples not survive no longer than four, five weeks.",
        "A: Because it was very hard. First, they were big cable and it was hard and they were very\nbig. And the Kapo was very bad man. He was from Austria. But I never want to go. I take\ncare always not to fall in, in this Kommando because that finished. So I in was\nKommando 128. It was very -- not easy, but it was easy. And one day the chief of -- the\nGerman chief come in and I was working with two Polish guys. They was in\nconcentration camp too. But they was okay. So I was the helper. I have to help them. I\nwas carry tools. I was carry the box and they was my chiefs, my managers. So the chief\ncome in and say \u201cLook, you have to go in this, this place, you have to connect the cable\nto 4000 volt.\u201d I remember very good.\nSo it was in, Tadek and we have to go there. And it was a big cable and there was a box,\nyou know, for the fuses and it was the long fuse. And on the top there was power and on\nthe end there was no power, because you have to put the fuse and you have to connect\nthis cable. So we put the cable in this box and he say, \u201cYou know, what? I'm going to\npush him. You push in and you make the screws and we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d And so, he was\nstronger for me, and after the cable I screw a little bit. Not so much because I was not so\nstrong like him. So he say, \u201cYou know what? Now, you come lift little bit the cable. I\u2019m\ngoing to screw.\u201d So I have -- the box was big -- I have my face always in the box and I\nkeep this cable. And he took a key, a metal key and turned the nuts, you know, to close it\nvery fast. And in the middle it turned and placed from down to up and from up to down,\nand it make a short and there was a flame and I have it all, everything in my face. The\nwhole face was burned and he have, you know, split his hand and I think I was burning,\nso I wipe up and I take out all this meat, all the skin to the bones. It was, first of all, it\nwas hell. So I look at him. So I say, \u201cTell me, what you do?\u201d When he saw me he say,\n\u201cWe have to go some place.\u201d So we run to the commanders place where the SS was there\nand we arrive there. So, I remember the SS, they say, \u201cWas hast du -- Icek, was hast du\ngemacht?\u201d\u2019\u2019 What you are doing? So I say I was in -- meantime there was no power in\nthe center there. So, they call to the -- we have in Krankenbau\u201d\u2019 and like a little hospital,\n*\u00b0 \u201cWhat have you \u2014 Icek, what have you done?\u201d (German)\n\u201d Infirmery (German)\nand they say for me, \u201cHe was wounded -- he was burned. You have to come and take\nhim.\u201d Because I can't see any more, nothing. So -- but the SS still, they give me cigarette,\nmaybe they have pity for me, I don't know. And it is coming with the table. Put me on a\ntable I went to the hospital and I was there. So I say -- it was a doctor, it was Polack -- I\nsay \u201cLook, I hope I can go out tomorrow, day after tomorrow.\u201d So he say, \u201cYou crazy?\nEven in 15 days, you can't go out.\u201d And, you know, every day the doctor come and take\nout the dry skin. But I was so bad burned so they have to put me some place because\nMengele come in every time to looking after, and when he find me, he send me to the gas\nchamber because I was very sick. So they hide me at certain time. I was covered with all\nkind of things -- he doesn't see me. And I was in the hospital for maybe six weeks. After\nsix weeks I come out and we start to work again. So no more electrician.",
        "A: Oh, no, oh, no. Because every day, every day you have peoples coming in truck and take\nthem out and they send them to the gas chamber.",
        "A: He didn't see me. I don't know how they manage it. But they -- because of, I don't know.\nMaybe they like me. Maybe I was lucky. And it was a very nice man. The doctor was\nvery nice. He clean it every day. He take out the dry skin. It hurt very much.",
        "A: My brother, he was in Birkenau. They take him away to Birkenau.",
        "A: He start at Buna with me and this I want to see before my accident. The burn accident.\nThe transport from the same town when I was in Plonsk is coming, the next transport. It\nwas my oldest brother come in and he took the place, the transport took the place from us\nin the quarantine. And in quarantine they find out one or two, they have typhus, and they\ntake the whole transport and they send them to Birkenau. And they went -- most of them,\n80 or 90 percent from this -- they went to the gas chamber. And my brother was between\nthem.\nSo we have to \u2014 you know, in column -- we was always -- all this was about four or five\no'clock afternoon. When the war was finished, the day war was finished, we have to walk\nto the camp. We never walked when it was dark, not in the morning, not at night. We\nhave to come into the camp when it was lights. So when I come -- when my Kommando\ncome to the camp, so I saw the whole column from my brother and he saw me. He say\nme, he say me \u201cGoodbye. We doesn't see you -- We don't see us anymore.\u201d And this was\nthe end.",
        "A: And my little brother was already in Birkenau. He find, maybe next day he find his\nclothes.",
        "A: Blocks, buildings, all kind of buildings. Because like I say --",
        "A: First of all, we building the camp because it was not camp. It was just empty, not empty\nplaces, just a couple barracks. It was not the wires, the electrified wires. We have to build\nthat. We put it --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We have to make that. And we made it because -- first of all, we make the holes to put\nthe Beton\"', you know, around and after we have to pull the wires the, you know \u2014 how\ndo you call -- what they make on the prisons, the wires. You can't pass there, the wires.\nAnd after they have the wires electrify with -- I think, 220 volts around, and something\nwe have to put on this one. We have to put barracks because every time, every time there\nwas newcomers, newcomers like from all kinds of Jews. Most, they coming from all over\nfrom Greece, from Yugoslavia, from Belgium, from France, from all over, all over, all\nover, and we have to build a place for them. So this was the building. After, when the\ncamp was built, so we went in certain group. Went out to the Buna \u2014 work -- we start\nexactly the same thing to build it. Carpenters to prepare to make the things for, to make\nthe Beton, the concrete, and some people like electricians to build all this building. And\nwe have the masters, the masters -- the chiefs, they was Germans. Germans engineers,\nGermans architect, all the Germans was -- and we was just, we made just the dirty work,\nthe hard work.\n* concrete (German)",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I stay always at Buna, yes. Until the end. Until the 18th of January, 1945.",
        "A: Layout of the camp, no. But one thing we know, we don\u2019t going to survive there. They\nhave to -- first of all, you know, when you fall sick, was finished. And they have to every\nday, every time, they have to kill in certain number from this prisoners. There was this\npolicy, the German policy.",
        "A: The whole camp was German industry.",
        "A: We make, yes. I was working there and in the industry because it was our job. Like I say,\nI was working like electrician and we always have to be ready, because we make\nsometimes, you know, they have some trouble with the electricity. There was the, you\nknow, how can I explain you? It was in building 700, and this 700 they make the gasoline\nfor the planes and there was a roll, and under this it was like a carpet, long carpet. It was\nrolling and over there they put some, not coal, but cox.\nYou know what cox? Cox is coal. You take out the coal \u2014 you take out the gas from them\nand from them they took out, they make gasoline and this have to run the whole day. You\nput it in the machine to take out the stuff, and we have to always take care of that, to\nrepair. Sometimes it was missing. Sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes it was a fuse\nwas burned up or something like that, and we have to be always there. They run 24 hours\na day. So this one 1s the job I was working there.",
        "A: This was maybe about two years.",
        "A: In this whole company, they all I.G. Farben industry, was about, I can't lie to you, about a\nmillion something, a million people.",
        "A: The part I was working was about, maybe 35 peoples. Just my Kommando for me. This\nwas just the prisoners.",
        "A: No, no, no. There was women, yes. But there was no prisoners with us. There was the\ncivil workers, the Ost** workers from east, from east, from Poland, from Ukraine, from\nRussian, and sometimes there was even the prisoners from the war, from American\nprisoners, English prisoners, Australian prisoners. They all take part in the war. They was\nthere in this I.G. Farben industry.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. We have -- first of all, we don't have no right to speak with any kind of civil\nworkman. When is a German we have like chief German, German chiefs, like architects,\nlike engineers.\nWhen these spoke there was a Kapo, they take care of us. So he was talking with him and\nhe give us orders, but personal. I don't have no right to talk with any kind of civil worker,\nany kind of civil business. Nothing. If they catch me, they hang us, you know. We have\nevery day, every day there was before supper, supper what we have. We come in, and we\nsaw already the thing was made and today they going to hang one or three or five or\nsomething. I remember, there was one bombardment and there was a young man -- I don't\nremember how old he was -- He eat his piece of bread that he receive for breakfast, and\nthe German SS take them and they put him in jail. They make a jail, a hole. They put him\nin jail and the next day they hang him, and because they say he was stealing bread. And\n\u201d East (German)\ntime from the bombardment was not good, and I remember young man was maybe 17,\n18-years-old, he begging them officers \u2014 Obersturmbannfuhrer -- and they begging him,\nthey kiss his boot, \u201cPlease, it\u2019s not true, I don't do nothing.\u201d He doesn\u2019t help, absolute\nnothing. They put him on -- they put his cut on his neck and he poor guy, he couldn't die.\nThere was a guy -- a Rackers\u201d\u2019, terrible bitch an German, took his feet and pull him so\ndown to die fast. And this one was the order for the day was, maybe every day, every\nsecond day. One day we coming up, we coming to the camp after the work and they saw\nalready, in each place from the Appellplatz was the German with the rifle, with the\nmachine gun, and we say, \u201cOh, oh, something happen.\u201d And three young boys was\nhanging because he say they want to escape from the camp. That wasn't true and they\nhang him. So I remember one scream, \u201cKopf hoch, Kamerad!\u201d\u201d* -- I'm sorry...\u201d",
        "A: I'm sorry. He say, \u201cKopf hoch. Kamerad! Wir die letzten\u201d? -- he say, \u201cup his head\u201d --\n\u201cwe are the last one.\u201d And the last one he say, \u201cLeben die Freiheit!\u2019\u201d\u201d\u201d\u00b0 \u201clong life and\nliberty.\u201d They hang three young peoples for what? Did exactly the same thing, pull them\nby the legs because they couldn't die. And sometimes even to die, even to hang, you have\nto know how to hang. And sometimes, you know, you have to -- they think, you know,\nthey have to put it here just to break the neck. But he just put on the thing and put here.\nThis guy don't know how the neck, so he pull on the legs to die. How did they do that?",
        "A: Every day, every day, every day was the same thing. Every day we saw it and sometimes,\nsome days, we talking about it and I have it before my eyes. I saw the young boys, and\nafter we have to march, you know. You know was about 12 or 15,000 peoples, I don't\nremember. We have to pass by them and have to look on them, how they hang dead.\nSomething terrible.",
        "A: You see in a moment there -- sometimes I wake up at night, you see, 50 years after and I\nsay, 1t was impossible. Is dream. I dream about that, but it's impossible that things happen\nin the 20th century and peoples, like Germany, they are cultivated people. So organized\npeople doing things like that. It is something impossible. When the-- you know,\n* SS Technical Sergeant Bernhard Rackers\n\u201c Head high, comerade! (German)\n* Head high, comerade! We are the last. (German)\n\u201c\u00a9 Long live liberty! (German)\nliquidated the ghetto there was the German to go to take out the peoples, took the little\nchildren, little babies by their feet and they smash their heads on the wall and -- and the\ngovernment doesn't know, the United States government don't know, the government\nfrom England doesn\u2019t know -- they know everything but nobody lift their little finger,\nbecause maybe, because they are Jews, but maybe -- they don't kill not just Jews. They\nhave Christian too. And nobody, nobody lift. Nobody say one word because, you know,\nand God, where was God? God. And the Germans have this belt was marked God, God is\nwith us. The Germans not with us. They kill people. They kill rabbis. They kill priests.\nThey kill everybody. Where was God?",
        "A: No. Even not today, no. Look at what happened. That still, but still 1s not maybe a\nHolocaust, but they kill. They still kill all those people. Why? Why did they kill? Okay. I\ngoing to say they kill the oldest people, maybe they going to do something, but the young\nbabies, the old men -- I had an uncle he was over 100 years. They kill him. Why?",
        "A: Did I pray?",
        "A: Pray to who? No, no. Even not today, no! Because to who I going to pray? To kill me a\nlittle bit faster? I like to believe \u2014 I like to believe, I'm a Jew 100 percent. There is no\nquestion. But pray for who? For who? Where is he? What to do? God, I see with my\neyes. We was wondering there was a priest, an older priest and he fall on his knees by the\nSaint Maria in Poland. You know, there was the Christ and all these things, and a\nGerman come in, a young German kill him on the spot. And there is nothing there. Even\nthis guy should -- his hand should be paralyzed and, you going to tell me there 1s a God?\nThere is a priest. There is a Pope, all these things, but, nothing 1s not true. Is nothing\nthere. Even today in the 21st century we believe, make such a thing as murders, killing\nlittle babies, little children. Why? What difference? Jew, not Jew? We all the same. They\nhave the same blood. Why? Who you going to ask? Who you going to ask? Who we\ngoing to ask? Stop it. What are you going to say? I have the same thing.",
        "A: No, no. I know once in 1945 in 18 of January. So we don't go out no day before. Two\ndays before, we don't go out to work. The Kommandos were a little, you know, some no\nproblem, but the Germans was very hard, so I say, \u201cUh-oh, something happen.\u201d And this\ntime they start to make the bombardment on the camp. You know, the I.G. Farben was\nbombarded. The repair was bombarded. It was something. So on the 18 of January there\nwas an order, we have to go together and we was out. The camp was liquidated and the\nBuna. We have to go out. So we was walking the whole night until a certain camp,\nGleiwitz.\nSO we was in camp. We went to the camp. We stay over night and the next day they\ncome in. We have to go to the train station. And in this gruppe\u2019\u2019, I was most of the last\none. And we have to take out the peoples what was first in the Krankenhaus\u2019\u2019, in hospital\nthere. So we have peoples. There was a little, not all young. They was a little sick, you\nknow, and we have to take them out, and they sit outside the place. It was -- I saw was\none or two SS, they shoot them, they shoot all those people. There was a river from\nblood. I couldn't -- we go to the station and they put us in trains, you know that. They put\nin the beast, you know, the cows. They put us in the trains, and it was maybe eight days\nlong. It was a ride maybe eight kilometers up and down, up and down, and everything\nwas closed. We don't have no water. It was wintertime, no water, no food, nothing, but in\nthe trains, in the wagons there was a -- you know, between the wood was little bit open.\nSo we have the air. So we coming back to Gleiwitz and I was hearing an order is coming\nfrom the Germans, and they say, \u201cSS abriicken, Haftlinge stehenlassen.\u201d\u201d\nSo the SS have to go away but they have to leave the prisoners in the wagons. So one\nofficer say, \u201cNo, we have to take the prisoners with us. They was a -- they going to\nprotect us.\u201d And they open the wagon with the machine rifle they start to shoot them. I\nhave just one. I received here. I don't know if you can see. (Indicating.)",
        "A: So I fell down and have to roll. I don't know how long. I don't remember because it was\njust shooting and lots of dead, and we was walking in the bushes, and from both sides the\nSS with machine rifles they shoot. It was lots of people run away, run to the bushes. I\ndon't know if they catch them or kill them. And we are were wandering the whole night.\nWe were walking until the next day. We come in the morning. We come in the prison,\nand we fell on the floors, and we sleep on the floor until next day. Next day we have to\nwalk. And we walk 2000 kilometers from 18 of January until ninth of May, 1945. And\nwe was by streets, all kind of towns, and sometimes we have a place to stay, in place one\nday. One day -- it was in March -- we come in a place. I don't remember anymore the\nplace, and there it was, a camp just for the Polish people. I don't know if it was\n\u201c7 Group (German); military term for basic unit of 10 men.\n*S Hospital (German)\n\u201d SS go away, prisoners stay (German)\nconcentration, if it was a work camp. And so the SS, I hear what they say, \u201cWe going put\nthe prisoners there and we going to have a rest for one or two days.\u201d Because, I think,\nthey was tired, too. But the chief in the camp, he doesn\u2019t want to let us in. And in this\ntown it was a mountain, a little mountain and they make a tunnel -- you know what a\ntunnel is -- in case the fliers come in to bomb. And so the people from this town can go in\nand to be safe, but it doesn't make it right through. And the chief say, \u201cOkay, we going to\nput the prisoners over there.\u201d They put us there and it was not so very high and so it was\ncold. Everybody go on the end but it was closed. You couldn't go nowhere because it was\nnot finished, it was not finished.\nThe compress us. All the things was outside, so I went there too, and it was a little warm\nbut after I say, \u201cIs little bit but no air. I want to go in the front.\u201d And they wanting the\nchief, the commandant in this camp. They make soup, you know, liquid soup. So I have it\nwas a part with me, and I say I going to go in the front every time and I going to take a\nlittle bit. I have to eat, so I take one and I say I going to take one, and I have a nice time.\nIn meantime we start to missing air in the end, no air, no air, and everybody want to go in\nthe front. So like here, you have the door. When you open the door, it was a place --\n\u201cThis one for me -- a good place, I gonna go there, I go to hide there. Nobody going to\nsee me and I have the fresh air.\u201d And the front was two SS and every time when the\npeoples want to go to the front, they shoot them. They kill them and they kill lots of\npeoples. And they put in -- there was a wagon outside and they put a wagon in front so\nnobody can go in. What I going to tell you? I can't describe it. There was screaming and\ncrying and the peoples, they running to the walls. They licked the walls because it was\nwet from the no air, and you see the oxide coming out. It was there in March. It was\nabout six o'clock. It was dark and the front was the SS. They let nobody out. We have to\nstay inside until the next day in the morning, and the morning was lights come in, maybe\neight o'clock and they called all the SS to come in, and they let out the people that was\nstill alive, and the firework was coming. They couldn't go in. They had to take the gas\nmask, they couldn\u2019t go in the end and from the end they took out peoples there. Dead.\nMaybe 100, 150 people was dead. And some peoples could survive on the end, coming\nout after five, six minutes they outside, they fell down and die because the lungs, they\ncouldn't support.\nAnd I was there maybe couple days, and they took the dead peoples put between the\nbarracks outside, they all frozen. Food, no question about food for us there. And about\neight days later we have to go away. And we start again to walk, and the order was to\nshoot the people, to kill us. But they couldn't kill us in town because it civil people there\nand they couldn't -- they doesn't want to give us to deliver to the Russian, because the\nRussians coming from the other side. And they don't want to give us to the American\nsoldier, but the American was too far. So we was between and we was walking every\nday. Every day we was walking. It was a couple SS and they pull out peoples and they\nshoot. So I say, \u201cGod, something happen. I won't survive.\u201d So I have -- on my side it was\na little SS. He was -- I don't know if he was from Yugoslavia, an older man, maybe 60,\nmaybe more, and he have on backsack. So I say to him, \u201cLook, you not a young man.\nYou know what? Give me your back. I going to carry them.\u201d So he say, \u201cWhy you want\nto do that?\u201d \u201cI want to help you. You tired. I want to help you. I think that's good.\u201d So he\ntake out -- he give me the thing he was walking just on the side from me. So every time\nthey eat, they have food, they have bread, so he give me just a piece of bread for me. It\nwas good and I can walk, first of all. Second, I was sure no SS going to come and grab\nme to kill me because I have his things, and he going to take care of it because he want\nalready \u2014 I have \u2014 SS they want to come in and grab me he say, \u201cUh-oh, don't touch it\u2019s\nmine.\u201d So I was already okay, and when I was doing that so many peoples, not many\nhave prisoners like me to do that. There was about five, six that we carried the SS sack.\nAnd in summertime, so we find a wagon. We put all these goods from the Germans, from\nthe SS, on the wagon, and we was pushing the wagon. And we was okay. We didn't have\nfood, but at least I was sure -- I was not sure -- but I was sure I was going to live until\nnight. I don't know what going to be next day. So they put us in all kind of place to sleep,\nand in the morning we see one dead on one side, one dead on other side \u2014 the people\ndying like nothing. And it coming May 9, 1945 about seven, eight o'clock in the morning,\nand it was not far from Friedland in Sudetenland. There was still a little SS come into me\nand took me by the arm.\nHe say to me in German, \u201cGo hin\u2019\u2019, where you wollt\u201d\u2019, aber lasst euch ja nicht erwischen\nbei unsere Briider.\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cGo where you want, but take care the Germans doesn't catch\nyou.\u201d And this was my liberation. The Russian come in there and this was May 1945, and\nI was with my friend from Holland. My friend and we was running, running, and we saw\nalready, you know, the Germans was sitting the rifles and all these things, all on the side.\nNo more. And one moment everybody who running -- the Germans was running, all the\nsoldiers was running. So I was on the highway and I stay and I wasn't German, and I say,\n\u201cHey, why you running so fast?\u201d So he say, \u201cFast, fast, Ivan come!\u201d And the Russian\ncoming, this was the liberation. He was lucky he was the first officer that I saw. It was a\nJew, Russian, Jew, Russian, and this when was the liberation. So you can imagine.",
        "A: No, and the first thing that he say, \u201cYou go back about five or 10 kilometers because here\nwe have to find, it still the Hitlerjugend\u201d\u201d\u201d -- was still in the bushes was hiding and \u2014 \u201cwe\nhave to clean it up.\u201d But this was impossible -- I couldn't believe it.

This was our nourishment.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. The Russian was there and we going back, and I was -- we went to Ringelshain in\nthis one -- in Sudetenland, you know, and Czechoslovakia and I was there. I was there a\nlittle time and I don't know nothing about my brothers. Because all this time I think\nmaybe they are all dead. So one thing that happened, you know, there was lots of people,\nwatch us passing in this town, and so there was boy. He was passing and I was talking\nwith him. So I told, I ask him, \u201cWhere you going?\u2019 So he say \u201cOh, I don't want to stay\nhere. I go to Germany. From Germany I go to Belgium.\u201d And I say, \u201cMaybe, maybe, you\nsaw my brother.\u201d I don't know. But this guy he went like say, he say, he went to Germany\nand from Germany he went to Belgium and he go exactly the same place where my\nbrother was. So the same thing I ask him and so he say, \u201cI saw your brother. Yes, your\nbrother is dead.\u201d So, I receive a letter from him. I receive a letter, I say, \u201cI don't have\nnothing to do here.\u201d So from Czechoslovakia I went to Germany and I go to Munich, to\nGermany, and when I arrive there so, you know, we have all over friend. I have all over\npeople I know from camp. So I saw one, he say \u201cAye, look, your brother is looking after\nyou.\u201d \u201cMy brother is looking after me?\u201d He say, \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cHow is looking, my brother?\u201d\nHe describe me completely like my older brother is -- he went to gas chambers \u2014 so I say,\n\u201cLook, I think you made a mistake.\u201d And he say, \u201cNo, I don't make a mistake, I think\nhe\u2019s younger from you.\u201d He told me, \u201cand is that and that and that.\u201d \u201cYou have the\naddress?\u201d And he say \u201cNo, I don't have the address.\u201d So we took a taxi. We run the\nwhole day over all Munich and that night I find him, and he doesn\u2019t know from me, and\nhe doesn\u2019t know from me from my brother -- that was in Belgium. And I said \u201cLook,\nAaron is alive and is there and there.\u201d And we send him a telegram. He went from\nBelgium. He come to Munich, to Germany and from Germany went to Belgium. We were\nall three together, and after my two brothers, they went to Israel. From Israel they went to\nBelgium and from Belgium to Canada and here I am.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: No, they, went my brother went to Israel in 1947, or '48. After '48, you know by Israel\nwas country received the independence. They went to Israel.",
        "A: Because I was married in Belgium.",
        "A: I don't have no difficult in Canada, but I have very much difficult in Belgium, yes.\nBecause they ask me always papers \u2014 and we don\u2019t have no papers -- you couldn't stay in\nBelgium. And we want to stay in Belgium. We don't have no right to work, no have to\nright to make business, and every three months we have to go to the police. And, you\nknow, to present, to say, \u201cI'm here,\u201d and always was the same question. \u201cWhat you doing\nhere? And why you stay here?\u201d So the one thing I say 1s, \u201cfor the moment I want to here,\nbut we want to go to Israel, to Palestine.\u201d And he gave me, you know, for three months\nand again for three months and -- but before, when we arrived in Belgium, we was in a\nhome for old peoples, like an orphan house, but it is not for young but was already old,\n17, 18 years. But before that we have was maybe, you know, Namur.\nNamur was a priest, a very, very good man, a very fine man, and have trouble with the\npolice because they doesn't want to let us be there. So the gendarmes, the Belgium\ngendarmes they want to take out to pass the border. So they took one, they put on the\ntruck, and time they want to take someone else. They escaped. It was the priest. He say,\n\u201cStop. I going to take all.\u201d So he took all the peoples in the church. Jewish people went\nall there until a Jewish chaplain from the American Army, he know about that, and he\ntook the \u2014 all this people, Brux-- Linkebeek.\nAnd it was a home there. It was in Linkebeek in this home, and we was support by the\nJewish committee until a certain time. After they liquidate this home and everybody have\nto go to work, but we have some trouble with the work and we need an carte d\u2019identit\u00e9>\u2019,\na card. Some people have a white card, some people have an Model \u201cC\u201d this one with\n\u00bb* identity card (French)\njust use fingerprints. And we have trouble to stay there. We never could be a Belgium\ncitizen. So the best way is to go out. And we start, you know, to make the registration to\nAustralia, to New Zealand, and to Canada. So the first thing my brother, the younger\nbrother, went to Canada here and after we come.",
        "A: No. From Israel he come, you know, he make his service, military service.",
        "A: Came back from Belgium. He come here to Canada.",
        "A: Yes. Now Canada is my home.",
        "A: There was no camp.",
        "A: No, I was not in camp. I was in private home. I was in Czechoslovakia, about a year, a\nyear and a half because I have to find somebody. I couldn't imagine the whole family,\nnobody dead. So I travel. I want to go to Poland but when I come to Polish, on the border,\nPolish-Czechoslovakia they start to take us to the army. So I say, \u201cHold it, stop. First of\nall, I can't kill nobody. Second, I am no good for the army. I was already five year in the\nconcentration camp.\u201d Not for me, the army. So, I remember very well. It was the German\nprisoners, the sick, wounded prisoners that was from the war. They was in train this pass\nfrom Poland and Poland Czechoslovakia and most of prisoners from the Russian front\nfrom the German. They pass Czechoslovakia, Poland, Czechoslovakia. So the first thing\nat night there was a train. I jump on the train and I went in Czechoslovakia because\nCzechoslovakia was the maybe, is today I don't know, it was the one civilized country\nfrom the old eastern country. First of all, no antisemite is there. There are very, very fine\npeople. There are today very fine people, very good, and they help lot, they help. Red\nCross, they help me and after I went to UNRRA and I was very good there. But soon I\nreceive a letter from my brothers. I say and the same thing and this time, you know, I\ndon't know if you know, Masaryk\u201d was the president from Czechoslovakia, he kill\nhimself and this started the trouble with the Communists.\n\u00bb\u00b0 Jan Masaryk (1886-1948); Czech statesman.\nAnd I say, \u201cI'm not a Communist.

What I have to do, what I have to say. I want out.\u201d So, the first thing that I\ndo, I take my friend and we went to Prague and in Prague was just -- you know, I listen\nby the radio. It was the Nuremberg process. So they make the process and the next day\nwe smuggle the border, and we arrive to Germany and then Munchen, you know -- not\nMunchen, but it was in West Germany. And from the West Germany I say, \u201cNow I am in\na democratic country.\u201d The American was there. I don't care but I don't stay not long,\nbecause we went to Belgium. Belgium we have trouble but the government doesn\u2019t let us\nthere.",

First of all, they know already because before they coming to us, they\npass already Auschwitz and Buna there, and the whole way that they make from the\nRussian country \u2018til us. They liberated 100 different prisons and they saw all of that, and\nthey saw the crematoriums, they saw all these things. So when they arrived on us, they\nsaw this. They know about us. They know, and I remember when the Russian arrived, the\nofficer, the first thing what he gave me a piece of bread. And he have a motorcycle and\nhe told me, \u201cYou know what? You sit on the side car. You going show me all the\nGermans that kill, that was bad.\u201d And, you know, it was the first soldier that coming and\nit was always with motorcycle and on this motorcycle was a machine gun. And, you\nknow, they was in the middle and all the soldiers, the German soldiers have to be on the\nside because, you know, they was the Russian soldiers come in, and they took them all to\nthe camp. And I, so far I remember, I was \u2014 gun -- I saw a gun and I start to play with it\nand the gun start to shoot, and maybe I kill some Germans. I don't know.",
        "A: No. I can't watch them. I know it was and I say, \u201cHey, hey, stop it. I don't know how to\nstop it.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t take time, it was so fast. And I remember we coming back, I don\u2019t\nknow if he was talking Russian. Meantime, they take away all the Germans, all the SS\nwith the Germans, they took to the camp.",
        "A: The prisoner camp, and after they separate them, SS one camp the Wehrmacht\u201d\u2019 in\nsecond camp, and the women was to the SS women was... and I remember it was an\nofficer with a motorcycle come in. He want to pass, and on his motorcycle have a\nmachine gun. So the Russians, the Russian officer, he say, \u201chey stop, go down and come\nin.\u201d And the officer was saying -- and he talk to his soldiers, \u201cTake him, bring him there.\u201d\nHe doesn't want to. He stay up. He want to take the gun, so they kill him. They shoot him\nand the first thing that I do -- I have no shoes -- so I take his boots. They were beautiful,\nnice boots, and I take his boots and I look in his pocket. Maybe he have bread or\nsomething like that. So I take -- and I find a piece of bread and a piece of soap. The first\n\u00b07 General title of German armed forces from 1935 to 1945.\ntime. So the Germans, they give us, you know, machorka\u2019\u00ae, it was the tabek\u201d\u201d -- to things\n-- and bread, and we have some meat. Not meat, but salami, the Russian salami. And they\nsay, \u201cgo back\u201d and we went back. So we went back maybe about 10 kilometers, back. We\nhave meantime, I have a car. I have a horse. I have a bicycle. I have a car. I don't know\nhow to drive, but I drive a car a little bit. But so far, so long we have gasoline. We don't\nhave no gasoline, and after I have a horse, but the horse was more tired than me so I leave\nit there, until I have a bicycle. And we went to a town, a town called Ringelshain and I\nsaw a little house on the mountain.\nAnd I say to my friend Jackie, I say, \u201cYou know what, Jackie, we are going up there. We\nare going to try to pass the night over there, but here on the road is going to be very noisy\nbecause the army pass.\u201d And so he say, \u201cokay.\u201d So we go up the little hill and it was a\nlittle house, and we knocked. There was two old, one man and one woman and I was\nmaybe crazy, not crazy but I very polite, and they were German too. And I say, \u201cI'm\nsorry, we coming from concentration camp. We\u2019re very tired -- so, maybe we can pass\nthe night here? I don't want to stay here, but maybe you have a shed or something like\nthat?\u201d So he told us, \u201cLook, we are not farmers. We don't have nothing. But there\u201d -- he\nshow me over there -- \u201cis a big farm, over there you can go and you can pass.\u201d In\nmeantime there was a young lady stick out her head and she say, \u201cHey, hey, come here.\nHow you talk? You speak Russian?\u201d So, I say, \u201cYes.\u201d But you believe me, at this time\nbelieve me or not, but at this time I was talking about -- speaking about seven language.\nBut I was with all kind of people. We have French -- not English -- French and Russian\nand Yugoslav. All kind of the slavish tongue, and we have Hungarian. We have Greek.\nAnd this all you have to understood all together, so for each language you take a couple\nwords and you learn. So I say, \u201cyes.\u201d So she say, \u201cYou want to come in because some\nRussian come in and they make us some trouble, and we can't speak with them. Maybe\nyou can speak with them.\u201d So we go in and first of all, we was so dirty. So we have to go\nand wash up and they give us, I remember she start to cut bread, but little slices. So I say,\n\u201cOh, no. That\u2019s not for us.\u201d I took a big slice of bread. And the first time after so many\nyears, I sleep in a good bed. And the next day we go out and we were looking for brother,\nmaybe a sister. Maybe was and we went to the Russian commandant too, and they give\nus all kind of things too and it was very, very nice.

        "A: What?",
        "A: Yes. We have all the news. We have all the news because it was every day, every day\nwas the same thing. Because first, you know, Mengele was, most of time, he was in he\nwas camp in the morning, when we was marching out from camp to work he was there.\nHe was there with a little stick, you know, and when he showing somebody, \u201cthis guy\nhave to be take out,\u201d and he went, you know, in a special block and they put them, they\nput all of them. There was the bed, three beds, but they took out the wood between and\nthey close them like a box. Inside they put in these people and the next day they come,\nyou know, with the truck and to put all these people in that. They want to send to the gas\nchamber. So we know that because we knew every day, every day. It is not just sick\npeople. Even the healthy peoples.",
        "A: Yes. My brother, when he was taken away from Auschwitz they send him to\nJawischowitz, and Jawischowitz was a coal mine. Now, in Buna, if somebody have a bad\nrecord, like in Kapo, you know, a Kapo he went to the jail, to the SS, and say \u201clook, this\nguy is not a good worker,\u201d or something like that. So he doesn't kill him, but they send\nhim to a very hard job and in the coal mines. They have, you know, it was punishment.\nSo they send him for eight days -- not eight days, maybe three weeks, four weeks in coal\nmine. In coal mine like my brother told me, he was there, he was working on his belly, so\ndeep, they have to shovel the coals it was so deep. So it was very, very hard. And how I\nknow? Because this guy, he was strong, so he survive. And after surviving he come back\nto us and he give me news. He say, \u201cLook, I saw your brother. Your brother is in\nJawischowitz. He work there.\u201d So I make all my possible. He was a guy, he was Erwin,\ncalled him -- he was an Altreich\u201d\u201d Jew.\nHe was an Rapport-Schreiber\u00ae\u2019. He was working in the office with the German for the\nworker. If somebody change the commander or somebody go from one block -- the first\nthing, I was in block four. After they send me to block 14. After from block 14 they send\nme to block 51. And this was the, like I say, an accountant. And they make all the\npaperwork. So I was talking with him, and I tell him -- I beg him, \u201cLook, I have my\nbrother. He was working there and there and maybe you can do something. Maybe try.\u201d\n\u00b0\u00b0 Old empire (German); term used for regions within Germany\u2019s pre-1938 borders.\n\u00b0! Report writer (German)\nSo he promised me.

So, I think it was end of 1943.\nMy brother come to my camp in Buna camp. I was in Buna and he was the same\nelectrician. I was electrician. He was electrician, so you can imagine what kind of\nelectrician we was there. So these people they told us everything that happened there, like\nsome people coming from Birkenau, they took every time to put is called a\nSonderkommando\u201d. That mean, I don't remember exactly how many, but these people,\nthey took out when the people was gassed dead in the gas chamber. They took out these\npeople, put them on the wagon and push them to the oven. But these people don't do long\ntime because -- I'm sorry -- they put out the dead peoples and they put on the wagon. And\nmost of them, they put two men and one women because the women, they burn faster and\nbetter for men. And they put them off a little wagon and they push them in the oven to be\nburned. And these people doesn\u2019t work long. Maybe after two weeks, they are gassed,\nkilled, because they don't want nobody to have to live. Can't tell nobody what happened,\nso they kill them. And we know that. Then they have special peoples. They was very\ngood traitor. They received very good food, but eight days later, two weeks later, they\nhave to go, and they took somebody else. And we know that. Exactly the same thing.\nThey took the Russian prisoners, the women prisoners. They took out the marrow from\nthe bones to put to inject the German soldiers. We know that. The experiments, because\nsomething the doctors tell us the same thing.",
        "A: They talk together and they have peoples, like I say, they go into this camp to take the\nclothes from the dead, because they don't have so many. But in the end, like 1945,\nbeginning -- not '45 but middle '44, so before the end '44, we don't have any uniforms,\nlike with the stripes. They don't have anymore. So we have civilian clothes, but we have\nto put a patch on the back so you know yellow or other kind of patch. So they know they\nare prisoners.",
        "A: No. In Buna there was no medical experiments because the hospital was not very big.

He was very skinny, and so I try to help him. So he was working\nfor the Kommando, for the Luftgaukommando\u2122 -- that mean they make the graves and\nthe holes in the special machine guns against the planes, and they receive very good food,\nthe Germans -- but he was in the commander and they have a couple men with him. And\nthe Germans received this food. But always in the cans they leave a little bit of soup and\nbefore these cans have to go back to the camp they have to be washed. So they give him,\nthey say, \u201cHey, you, you come here. Take the soup but wash the cans.\u201d But the cans was\nwashed with iron brushes, and he was always hungry, he doesn't see -- so ate the soup\nand he swallowed a piece of wire. One Sunday he come to me and he say he was -- it was\nafter, so you have to be a barber and so he shave this guy and somebody else and he say,\n\u201cT have such a pains in my stomach. I don't know what happened. I have lots of pains.\u201d\nSo I say, \u201cYou know what, come, I go with you to the hospital.\u201d But I know this chief of\nthe doctors for the hospital.

He had such big pains, so they\nput him at night -- not at night -- to operate him and I was on the other side. I was hiding\nbut I saw everything that happened. So it was Dr. Mengele's, because even between the\nprisoners, there was some good doctors and they worked in this hospital. And they want\nto operate him, so they open the belly. In meantime everything was open. There was an\nalarm, you know, the planes. I don't know if English or Russian planes come in. No\nlights. He was laying down with open stomach. It just take I don't know, very long but\nthe lights coming back. And the doctors coming back. I was behind. I saw that. I saw Dr.\nMengele come into him and say on his shoulder, \u201cJude, when you live now, you going to\nlive long time.\u201d And they operate on him. But they pull out all the intestine together very\nbadly and he have very big trouble today, and they can do absolute nothing.
