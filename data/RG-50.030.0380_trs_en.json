        "Q: Good afternoon, Dr. Friedman.",
        "A: Good afternoon.",
        "Q: I'd like to start by having you tell us just basic information about when and where you were\nborn and take us rather quickly, if you would, to where you found yourself in the spring of\n1945.",
        "A: Well, that covers quite a bit of territory. I was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, on March the\ntenth in 1920 and I was the fourth of five children and eventually my father and mother took\nin a cousin who was orphaned. So there were three boys and three girls in the family. I went\nto school locally in St. Joseph, Missouri, and of course grew up during the Depression. That\ncovered quite a long era. We all worked. It was the usual paper route, selling magazines,\neventually working in the drugstore and working my way through school as much as I could.\nFortunately, we had a junior college in St. Joseph and I was able to go there for my first two\nyears and get an Associate Arts degree. But after that, Iran out of money, so I was in search\nof jobs that would pay more. With that in mind, I went out to Colorado, where I had an older\nbrother and his family, and I worked in an amusement park in Colorado \u2014 Lakeside\nAmusement Park. It was a very good job for the summer because a lot of college kids\nworked there as they did in ranches, dude ranches, in Colorado. So it was very pleasant work\nbut by the end of the summer I still didn\u2019t have enough money to go back to school. So I\nwent back home \u2014 I was homesick and my folks wanted me to come back. I went back\naround Thanksgiving of 1939. And made enough money to enter my first year of college\u2014\nof podiatry school. I\u2019m almost afraid to go down that alley because it was my first\nprofession. I went there because Dad wanted me to be a doctor. I didn\u2019t want to be a doctor\nbut this was the next best thing. In fact, it was difficult at that time, even to get into medical\nschool. There were Jewish quotas. But I did go to Chicago and I talked to the registrar and\nwhen I came home during the summer of \u201939, to make a decision as to what I wanted to do,\nI decided to go to podiatry school. Well, that was in the fall of \u201941, and we know what\nhappened on December the seventh. During the Christmas holidays, although they asked us\nto remain in school as much as we could, everybody was gung ho. We wanted to get into the\narmy and fight the Japanese because of this atrocity that they had inflicted upon us at Pearl\nHarbor. Well, I tried to get into the Navy but, at that time, they were very strict and I\ncouldn\u2019t get in on account of my eyes, plus the fact that they did encourage us to stay in\nschool \u2014 at least to finish that year, which I did. I went back to school, but during the week of\nfinals, I got the orders to come report to my selective draft board and fill a quota and I did. I\ncame home and went into the army. I went into basic training to , Texas, with\nthe 95\" Infantry Division. I had had ROTC in high school at that time. ROTC was very good\nbecause we were able to wear uniforms and it would save on our clothing. Although they tell\nyou never to volunteer for anything in the Army, when they asked if anyone had had any\nclose order drill, my hand went up and I was immediately put in charge of a platoon. At the\nend of the first month, fortunately, I made PFC. The second month, I made buck sergeant,\nI\u2019m sorry, corporal, then buck sergeant, that\u2019s three stripes, then staff sergeant. Then I was\nready to go to OCS. I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. I had a first sergeant, was\nregular army, very anti-semitic, and when I put in my papers for OCS, he didn\u2019t send them\ninto headquarters, so I didn\u2019t get to go.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk to him about that?",
        "A: Yes, yes, and the reason he didn\u2019t put the papers in, although he\u2019d called me, in all the\npromotions that I got, I found out that he kept saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want a kike (ph) on my staff\u2019.\nThe other officers would override him and I was promoted from time to time, through the\nranks. The reason he didn\u2019t send me to OCS was he was going out to the 97\" Infantry\nDivision and he wanted me to go along with him, which was quite a strange thing, until you\nthink of the fact that I did all his work. And also, one of the officers in my company said that\nI was going through too fast and that OCS 1s very difficult. They were flunking out at least\nhalf of them and it would do me good to have a little more training, a little more of a sense of\narmy, and what\u2019s expected of me, and the extra six months or so that I\u2019d have to spend\nwould be to my advantage. And it was true. I did go to OCS and it was very difficult. I think\naround 520 of us matriculated and there were maybe 200, 280 or 85 that finally graduated\nand got their bars. Then we were sent to different camps. I finally ended up at a headquarters\ncompany at Camp Blanding, Florida, doing various jobs. And then went overseas.",
        "Q: When did you go overseas?",
        "A: Went overseas during the winter of \u201842-43. We were stationed in Preston, Lancashire, and\nwe crossed the channel on a Polish ship called the Sobiesky (ph) and when we got midway\nthrough the channel, there was a lot of submarine and anti-aircraft activity by the Germans,\nso we had to back to Southampton. I later read, after the war, that the ship that left\nSouthampton the same time we did was torpedoed.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: It was. .. the dates are going to be a little difficult for me.",
        "Q: The general time of year?",
        "A: Oh, it was during Christmas, it was during Christmas. It was the same night that Glenn\nMiller disappeared over the channel. Which later came into a lot of things that I did after the\nwar, or a lot of things that I thought about as being \u2014 if something took off, took of\nparamount importance to me, I would think of the time that I crossed the channel, and how\nlucky that I was. When they said that, \u201cyou get on this ship, or you get on this ship, how\nmany are in your complement\u201d, I said, \u201cSix officers and 96 men\u2019. \u201cOkay, you get on this\none, you get on that one.\u201d We were lucky enough to get on the Sobiesky (ph) that turned\nback. The other one was torpedoed, with a loss of about 90% of the personnel. I didn\u2019t know\nthis until after the war ended, when they were printing these statistics. At any rate, we\nlanded. We had to go over the side of the ship with a rope ladder and landed in landing craft\nand went into LeHarve(ph). Now this was after the invasion, and although we weren\u2019t being\nshot at, it was still very difficult and very cold wading through the water until we get onto\ndry land. Once, and I\u2019m going very fast because there\u2019s quite a bit to cover, once we got into\nFrance, we started moving very rapidly. In fact, I know there were a lot of articles written\nabout Patton streaking across France and into Germany and across the Rhine, across the\nRaymoggan (ph) bridge head, which we crossed, and into Tree Air (ph). Then we went to,\nwe were in the battle of Baston, we were in Belgium, Luxembourg, and then into Germany.",
        "Q: You came into about the tail end of the winter, fighting.",
        "A: From the beginning of winter, of \u201944, 45.",
        "Q: And the Battle of the Bulge was going on.",
        "A: In winter of *45.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \"44,45.",
        "Q: And then you were at Baston in February?",
        "A: Around that time. I once read where someone was telling an account of, 1t might not have\nbeen his war stories, it was something and what stuck in my mind was, he said \u201cMy memory\nhas a lot of holes in it.\u201d So I\u2019m going to paraphrase what he said, or copy what he said, and\ntell you that my memory, after 50 years of not going back to all this, until I was given an\nopportunity to give this oral history, my memory is going to have a lot of holes in it. So there\nwill be a time period that will have quite a spread. Now with the Third Army, i 1\nhope -- it would have been nice if it all happened that quickly to bring me to this point, but I\nknow that this is the major thrust of the interview.",
        "Q: We\u2019re in April.",
        "A: We\u2019re in April. Our troops uncovered the concentration camp at Ordruff (ph). Now Ordruff\n(ph) was one of the satellite camps at Bookenblow (ph) near Gotha (ph) and you can\u2019t get\nthe full measure or the full thrust of what happens to you when you walk into a place like\nthis and see bodies, emaciated bodies, stacked one on top of the other.",
        "Q: Back up a little bit for me. When you got the orders to go in and you were, how did you\napproach, what did the area look like, what time of day was it, can you remember those\nthings?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you have that whole memory?",
        "A: Yes. Vividly, vividly, it was daylight. Those who were left, there were still bodies burning in\nthe ovens, and we could still smell it. In fact, after the war was over when my mother would\nfix a chicken and try to burn off the little feathers that were left, I had to get out of the house.\nI couldn\u2019t smell that odor, that odor that gets into your nostrils, and never leaves. I\u2019ve never\nbought a pair of striped pajamas in my life, because that\u2019s what they were wearing \u2014 these\nstriped pajamas, and I know what happened. I kept salivating. You know there\u2019s, before you\nvomit, something happens to the salivary glands and it\u2019s kind of a, well if you\u2019ve ever done\nit, if you\u2019ve ever had it, you know that it just, before you give it all up, there\u2019s, you know that\nyou're going to throw up. And that\u2019s rather indelicate, but this is what happens. Some of the\ndead were in very grotesque positions, leaning against a tree with their legs covered, and\ndead. Just all sorts of, maybe some in fetal positions, lying in the camp. Those who were still\nalive, in the barracks, if you could call it a barracks, they were sort of lean-tos with straw,\nwere so weak that if the one next to him was dead, he didn\u2019t have the strength to push him\noff so that he could at least have maybe the small luxury of being able to turn around on this\npallet that had been his bed for many years. We did whatever we could \u2014 we did in the way\nof food, whatever we could give them, whatever help we could give them, but we were still\nmoving on. I was still with the combat troop. Actually, I had a litter bearer platoon, and my\nmen were the ones who saw the first casualties, the first line of casualties, and would carry\nthem back to the evac hospitals that were in the rear of the combat line. We did whatever we\ncould to make them comfortable. I heard that, after we left, there was such pandemonium,\nand I think that this continued until the end of the war, there was never, nothing ever ran\nsmoothly, it seems. As much as we tried, there was always some trouble brewing somewhere\nand something to be taken care of, that needed immediate attention. But I understand that the\nBurgermeister (ph) of Ordruff (ph) was murdered by the inmates who were left and his body\nwas dismembered and he was strung up on a tree in the center of town, the civic center. I\nthink this is true.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t see it?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see it.",
        "Q: But you have reason to believe...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Could you see, when you first came in, some of the people who were still alive were able to\nwalk around and talk with you?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: And did you talk with people?",
        "A: Briefly, briefly. \u201cCause we\u2019d both cry. There wasn\u2019t too much, we\u2019d start a conversation and\nthey would love us and kiss us and we would hug them and whatever we had we would give\nthem. Then there was the language barrier. Some spoke Russian, some spoke Polish, some\nUkrainian, Lithuanian, Estonians, Latvian. They came from the Balkan countries as well,\nRomania, Hungary. There was a whole cacophony of voices and languages but we knew one\nthing. They all had one thing in common \u2014 that they were free. And I think, I think, wanted\nto get revenge. I probably would have behaved in the same way, to avenge six years, some of\nthem, of torture, of having their families taken away from them. And murdered in such a\nmanner, in such a diabolical manner, that we\u2019ve all learned about since then. I didn\u2019t know\nall this at that time. I was aware...",
        "Q: What did you know then? Did you why these people were in this camp? Did you know who\nthey were?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right away?",
        "A: Well, I knew, I knew, I knew that they were slave laborers. I knew that the majority of them\nwere Jews.",
        "Q: Do you know how you knew that?",
        "A: Well, in my fractured Yiddish, and they told me, and I was able to understand a little bit of\nGerman. But I just sensed that most of them were, because by then, what had been written in\nthe Stars and Stripes, which was the army newspaper in Germany, or in Europe, we started\nhearing about these atrocities. But I didn\u2019t have any visual evidence of it until I went into the\nconcentration camp. I didn\u2019t know how they got there, well, I knew how they got there, they\nwere forced there, but I didn\u2019t know until later on when I read how they were put in vans,\nand put on trains and in boxcars and the methodical way that they were loaded into boxcars\nwith the elderly going in first, pushed in. And then the younger ones and then the younger\nchildren and then perhaps, from six on down, they were just picked up by their legs and\nthrown into the boxcar to land on top of whoever was there and then the boxcar was sealed.\nIf they had to defecate, or urinate, they had to do it in place, in the boxcars. The boxcars\ncame into play, when the vans that they used to gas \u2014 you know they would use vans and\nthey would hook a pipe onto the exhaust and put the pipe into the van and by the time they\ngot to Treblinka, or Auschwitz. . . I didn\u2019t know all this until much later. When I saw them,\nwell, they were prisoners who hadn\u2019t been fed who worked for the German war machine\nand given, not even, minimal rations. Not even just something to keep them going so they\ncould keep the war machine going, and when they couldn\u2019t any longer do that, it was off to\nthe ovens. That was all I knew then.",
        "Q: And you saw mostly men?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you see women?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t recall seeing any women then.",
        "Q: And did you spend some time \u2014 how big was the camp and what did you see there and what\ndid you piece together from seeing what was at the camp? Did you see what work they were\ndoing? Did you know that?",
        "A: No. No. By then, by the time we got there, the guards had disappeared. They tried to kill as\nmany as they could before they left. A lot of what went on there, we were told as we went\non, as we left, and talked to each other about what had been happening there, and were given\nall sorts of lectures, again, on what had been happening in these camps. I didn\u2019t see firsthand\nwhere they worked \u2014 they weren\u2019t working anymore. They sort of spread out over the\ncountryside because, as we progressed, as the army progressed, we would see them.",
        "Q: Walking?",
        "A: Walking \u2014 in the striped pajamas, foraging for food, perhaps killing justifiably, we thought.",
        "Q: How long did you stay at Ordruff ph)?",
        "A: Perhaps the larger part of two days. Maybe a day and then left on the second day. But during\nthat time, during that time, something must have started germinating in my mind. I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but think, of course, there but for the grace of God, go I. I and my antecedents were all\nfrom Russia, and I could very well have been one of the inmates of the concentration camp,\nhad I lived in that surrounding, in Russia. The entire village, I later learned, the entire village\nthat my parents and grandparents lived in and aunts and uncles whom I\u2019d never met and\ncousins \u2014 they were entirely wiped out. I later learned that they were all herded into a barn\nand the barn was set on fire and as they tried to escape, they were machine-gunned. This 1s in\n1939 when the Germans went into Poland. I didn\u2019t know that that happened. I just know that\nwe stopped getting letters from my grandparents in 1939. We stopped getting mushrooms.\nThey used to send mother \u2014 my grandmother used to send her dried mushrooms and she\nmade delicious mushroom and barley soup. That all stopped of course.",
        "Q: So even before you went in the service, you were aware of the situation for Jewish people in\nthe eastern part...",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: You knew.",
        "A: I knew. I wanted to go into Germany in 1938. I wanted to take a bicycle tour through\nGermany and I had talked to a friend who had been there and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t go. It\u2019s not the\nplace for Jews.\u201d So we knew as early, actually, as 1933, the things that were happening, the\nlaws. I didn\u2019t pay that much attention to it. I was 13 years old then and the prom was much\nmore important at the time, I guess.",
        "Q: But your parents were concerned and keeping in touch with relatives?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were relatives coming over during the thirties?",
        "A: At the end of the thirties. An uncle of mine who survived, or who was able to come over,\ncame over. But we didn\u2019t talk about it a lot. And I found that to be true among many first\ngeneration Americans, as I was. We were too busy trying to Americanize our parents. Which\nwas a mistake. What we should have been doing was talking to them and getting this\nbeautiful, beautiful background that they had in Europe. I know later on when I\u2019d take\nMother for a ride in my car and we went out into the country because I came from a small\ntown, in Missouri, and when the wheat was being harvested and the corn, she\u2019d take it in.\nShe\u2019d smell the wheat and she\u2019d say, \u201cOh, this is just like home.\u201d It was always home. And\noddly enough, in the many years that I\u2019d been away from St. Joe and I\u2019d been away to school\nand in the theater, I\u2019ve been away altogether, I guess, close to 50 years, whenever I told my\nwife, whenever I talked about home, she always knew that it meant St. Joseph. It wasn\u2019t\nwhere we were living at the time. That was a house. And we\u2019ve lived all over the world. And\nI guess the army took me all over the world, too. But home, home was always St. Joe, the\nway Russia was always home to Mother and Dad. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t find out more\nabout that. We got busy with making a living, going to school, and finding the American\ndream. I\u2019m digressing.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s okay. Dr. Friedman, when you spent that day and a half, more or less, in Ordruff\n... when you left, what was it that the army was able to do for those people in that short\namount of time? Very much?",
        "A: Not a lot. Just enough to keep them alive. It became quite a hot potato after a while, on what\nto do with these people. I do know, and it might have been, it might be a rumor, but I was\ntold that our Air Force, who did almost pinpoint bombing, eventually, was told not to bomb\nany of the German military camps. Or any of the IG Farban (ph) buildings. Now the IG\nFarban was this tremendous cartel that had quite a bit of American money involved in it. The\narmy barracks, we knew that we were going to have to use them for the displaced persons,\nuntil they could be repatriated. Now it wasn\u2019t that difficult to send the western Europeans\nback, who\u2019d been slave laborers, send them back to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy \u2014\nalthough Italy was Allied Germany for a while \u2014 they were also working in the war effort\nand had to be sent home. But we couldn\u2019t do anything with this tremendous, tremendous\nhorde of eastern Europeans until we made contact with the Russians and that took \u201ctil the end\nof the war, and then some. And then problems.",
        "Q: Is there anything else about that day and a half in Ordruff that you remember, that you want\nto relay? Anything about the town itself, the local people in the town? Did you have any\nopportunity to interact with the local people?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t speak with any of them, but they all stood around as though. . .",
        "Q: They came \u2014 was the camp right in town?",
        "A: Yes. On the edge of town, on the edge of town. They acted as though, as they were surprised.\nBut I honestly believe that no matter where the camps were, the people knew. They knew!\nThey smelled it! They smelled the ovens. They smelled the smoke that came out of the\novens. They didn\u2019t think they were baking bread there.",
        "Q: And the camp itself was close enough to the town...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: . . that was no doubt in your mind that people must have smelled and seen.",
        "A: Now, they might not have seen. They might not have been all that aware of how, how really\ndespicable the conditions were \u2014 how horrible they were. But I\u2019m sure that they knew what\nwas going on, and didn\u2019t care. Jews! Who cared? Hasn\u2019t that always been the history?",
        "Q: Did you, at the time, did you feel resentment towards those local people right away? Did that\noccur to you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I can\u2019t say that I did. I really didn\u2019t know enough then, and didn\u2019t feel enough. But what I\ndid feel, and I guess that\u2019s what later led me, I\u2019m taking all this in, probably, led me to\nvolunteer to stay over after the war ended. Or to get into the work of repatriating the\ndisplaced persons. I thought if I could, that whatever I could do, that I would try. In fact, it\nbecame a problem to the United States Army before the war ended, because when the camps\nthat were overrun, eventually all of them, knew that they would get better treatment from the\nUnited States Army, and, as we progressed, I would see hundreds, literally hundreds,\nthousands even, Russians walking, displaced persons walking along the street, along the\nhighway that we were driving on to get from one town to another. They had to be put in\ncamps, otherwise we couldn\u2019t feed them, we couldn\u2019t clothe them, we couldn\u2019t control them.",
        "Q: What happened to you after you left Ordruff in April? Where did you go? Where were you\non your way to? What was your destination then?",
        "A: I am, actually my platoon was broken up shortly after that. And, \u2018cause the war was winding\ndown.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t, you weren\u2019t, that function wasn\u2019t necessary anymore.",
        "A: No. No. I still had control of them but they were assigned to various combat troops. At times\nwe were with, I forget the names of the various corps, the 12\" Corps, the 22\" the 15\", and\nfrom time to time, I would see them and sort of oversee them and see that they got their\nrations and see that they got their pay and see that they got their mail. But other than that,\nother than that, I, the work really for me sort of died down a bit, until, until my commanding\nofficer asked me if I thought I would like to get involved in working with the displaced\npersons. And it wasn\u2019t all altruistic, at the time. I thought if I would get involved with that,\nwhen the war ended I wouldn\u2019t be sent to the Pacific. I\u2019m being honest 1n saying that that\nwas a factor, also. But the overriding factor, I believe, was something inside me that just\nwanted to help. You know, I\u2019m beginning to think, and as I hear myself and as we go on\nwith this oral history, I\u2019m going, you\u2019re going to hear I a lot, I guess.",
        "Q: (laughter) It\u2019s about you.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 you really can\u2019t be modest about these things, can you?",
        "Q: No. It\u2019s your story.",
        "A: Pronouns tend to get all knocked all over the place. But I know of no other way I can tell you\nthis. But I really, honestly and truly, wanted to do what I could to help.",
        "Q: Where were you \u2014 do you remember hearing that the war was over?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know the war was over until three days after it was over. And it\u2019s in my notes here.\nWe were near a camp and there were two German planes that landed near us. A German\nofficer and a blonde came out of one of the planes with a case of champagne. And he\u2019s the\none who told us, the group that I was with, that the war had ended. I think it was a, I think\nthe war ended, what May the 52 This was about May the 8\". I wrote home and I told them\nthat I found out that the war had ended. Now other things happened along the way. I\nreceived a promotion from second \u2014 I was a second lieutenant. And I received a promotion\nfrom second lieutenant to first lieutenant. Now I can along on this vein for awhile, if you\nwish...",
        "Q: It\u2019s up to you.",
        "A: And then we can go back to the camps.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But it is germane to what has happened. I received a promotion, first lieutenant, and while I\nwas in Koburg (ph), one of the camps, we were constantly being inspected. There was a\ngroup of officers that came in from Third Army. No one wanted the responsibility of running\none of these camps, because by this time, there were all sorts of letters written to the paper,\nand all sorts of surveys being made on how the camps were run and how the Jews were\nbeing treated. Governor Lame (ph) and I recall reading in the Stars and Stripes that the Jews\nwere being treated worse by the American army and by Unrah, (ph) and so on in the camps,\nthan they were in the concentration camps. Well, this wasn\u2019t true, entirely, but there was\nsome truth in it. They didn\u2019t know whether to put the Jews in with all the other DPs, or,\nbecause the Jews were stateless, they were homeless then. They couldn\u2019t go back home\nbecause their homes had already been taken over by the Poles, the Russians, or whatever and\nthey were happy. They were happy. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.",
        "Q: No. We\u2019re in the summer of 1945 when there is still a very chaotic situation in the camp \u2014\neverybody\u2019s thrown together and they haven\u2019t been and the ones who could go home\nhaven\u2019t yet really gone...",

        "A: Right. Now when you go into the Holocaust Museum, here, the first photo that you see 1s\nOrdruff, my camp, the one that I went into. It\u2019s a huge blowup on the wall \u2014 that\u2019s the first\nthing that you see. And you see Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton looking at these corpses\nabout 11 days after we were there. I think, I think the date on that photograph is about the\n16\", something like that, and we went in around April the 4\u201d or 5\". Patton, there\u2019s an article\nwritten by his aide-de-camp, and it\u2019s in one of the books that\u2019s in the library here, wrote that\nPatton became so ill when he saw this that he had to around one of the barracks and vomit.\nPatton. April, May, June, July, August, September \u2014 there\u2019s quite an article about Patton and\nthe DPs in the same magazine where Patton went into a camp, which camp was it? It was an\nall-Jewish camp. And he went in and he said, \u201cThe filthy Jews were worse than animals.\nThey defecate on the floors and they urinate in corners and it the Feast of Yom Kippur, the\nFeast of Yom Kippur, and they made a room into a synagogue and there\u2019s a man, a priest\nthey call a rabbi. He had some paper rolled around a pole that\u2019s called the Talmud but we\nknow it\u2019s the Torah. And the rabbi looked like King Henry the Eighth, with a filthy hat and\nfur on it. The prayers were in such gibberish that no one understood what they were \u2014 what\nanyone was saying. The stench of all these filthy bodies was such that when I left, I couldn\u2019t\nenjoy my dinner.\u201d Tough.",
        "Q: Did you ever have occasion to meet Patton?",
        "A: I saw him. I saw him in his jeep on the Raymoggan (ph) bridge head. I didn\u2019t meet him.\nLittle second lieutenants don\u2019t meet, well, I shouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m sure that the private he\nSlapped in the hospital and told him that he was malingering and should get back to the front\n\u2014 he had a nice meeting with Patton.",

        "Q: Did you have these feelings about Patton at the time?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Patton was my god. Look what he did for us. They called it the Red Ball Express. We went\nthrough France, through Germany. We went through because we overwhelmed them with\npersonnel and material. Not because of Patton\u2019s genius, I don\u2019t think. Am I being a traitor? I\ndon\u2019t know. You might want to cut this out.",

        "A: But I still had my men, but also, I\u2019m sort of working my way into working in the DP camps,\nwith the knowledge of my commanding officer. He had received orders to send whoever he\ncould to a school that would train us for these camps. Now the school was run by army\nofficers who had already been in a camp and knew some of the problems. I think, I think the\nschool lasted all of ten days, if that long. And I was ready.",

        "A: ... with my platoon. And I was relieved of all my duties with the company and put on\ntemporary duty with the G-5 section of the Third Army which is the military government\nsection. And the first camp that I went to was in Bamburg(ph), Germany. I brought a map,\nincidentally, perhaps later on, we can go through it. And I received the best training that\nanybody could ever have, in this camp. The way the camps were set up, we used, we had\nUnrah (ph) personnel. We had German personnel.",
        "Q: Civilian.",
        "A: Civilian. And army. We had, now understand, in order to run all these places, we had to have\npeople who were knowledgeable about the gasworks, about the waterworks, about the\nelectrical companies \u2014 and who knew these things? Germans. Nazis. If they weren\u2019t\nmembers of the Nazi Party, they didn\u2019t hold these positions, so we had to use them. Course\nPatton was later accused of playing footsie with all of them, but to some extent he had to.\nOne thing leads to another, doesn\u2019t it? They all had to fill out what they called a\nFraggoboggen (ph) \u2014 are you familiar with the questionnaire that the Nazis had to fill out?\nWell, it tells about their history in the Nazi Party and of course all of them said that they\ndidn\u2019t, or many of them had a supplement to it, which I have here, and I\u2019m going to leave\nwith the Archives \u2014 a supplement to the Fraggoboggen (ph) that this one man filled out. \u201cT\nwas never a member of the Nazi Party.\u201d That\u2019s what he said. \u201cI was never involved in any of\nthe atrocities.\u201d They all were. They all were \u2014 if they weren\u2019t actively involved in it, they\nwere guilty because they were there and allowed it to start as far back as 1933 and did\nnothing. Or when they started coming after the Germans who disagreed. And the Catholics\nwho disagreed, after they got through with the Jews and the gypsies and the homosexuals.\nThat\u2019s when people started taking note. Maybe there\u2019s a juggernaut that we can\u2019t stop \u2014 that\nwe\u2019re going to need help. Now I\u2019m in a camp, and the camps were run as cities. They had\ntheir own administration. We had an entire Polish army complement in camp. I have it right\nhere \u2014 the badges that they wore.",
        "Q: In Bamburg (ph).",
        "A: In Bamburg (ph). And later in Koburg, (ph) also. And the camp \u2014 we were constantly being\ninspected because, we were being inspected by all the, by major generals, and colonels,\nbecause everybody was coming down on them, from President Truman on down.",
        "Q: Action, they wanted...",
        "A: They wanted, they wanted what\u2019s going on in these camps. So they\u2019d come in. Now, at one\ntime, by being on temporary \u2014 this 1s just a little story. By being on temporary duty and away\nfrom my original company, I wasn\u2019t able to draw any rations \u2014 any of my rations from my\ncompany \u2014 like cigarettes. We were able to get liquor, too, incidentally. Heavens knows we\nneeded a little schnapps once in a while. Cigarettes, liquor and candy. And when I tried to\nget it from my company, they said we didn\u2019t draw any rations for you because, PX rations, I\nguess they called it, because you\u2019re not assigned to us. You\u2019re away on temporary duty. And\nwhen I tried to get it from the army headquarters, they said, you\u2019re not on our roster, you\u2019re\nonly here on temporary duty. So on one of the times that, on one of the times that my camp\nwas being inspected, when the officers got through, there were about eight of them, and I\nhave the listing here of all of them. The general just happened to mention, \u201cYou deserve a lot\nof credit for the work that you\u2019ve done here.\u201d And I said, \u201cI deserve a rest.\u201d\u2019 And the rest of\nthe officers \u2014 I guess their chin dropped between their knees because you just don\u2019t talk that\nway, . Very G.I. And he said, \u201cOh, what would you like to do?\u201d And you know,\nI was very young then, and very flip. I said, \u201cI think I'd like to go to the Riviera for ten days\nor so.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, how soon could you be ready?\u201d \u201cHow soon could you get a man here\nto replace me?\u201d He said, \u201cCan you be in Munich at 5:00 or 9:00 in the morning or\nwhatever? We\u2019ll fly you to the Riviera.\u201d \u201cCertainly I can be there.\u201d So before going, we had\na camp barber \u2014 and the reason I\u2019m telling you this 1s because one story begets another story\n\u2014 and he was cutting my hair, I had hair then. He was a Frenchman and I told him, I said,\n\u201cNow I want you to do a good job because I\u2019m going to the Riviera. I\u2019m going to stay at the\nHotel Carlton. I go to Nice and to Monte Carlo while I\u2019m there.\u201d He said, \u201cMy family lives\nin Cannes. I haven\u2019t seen them in eight years \u2014 I haven\u2019t written to them and there\u2019s no way\nthat they could write to me. Would you call on them?\u201d I said, \u201cOf course.\u201d He gave me their\naddress of where they lived. They lived up above Cannes \u2014 Gros(ph)? Well, and one day I\ntook a cab and went up there and I met his family and I invited his sister, a little 16-year-old\nsister to come back to the hotel with me to have dinner. Well, the Hotel Carlton, this is where\nthey have the Cannes Film Festival, as you know, and everything is very, very elegant there.\nThere\u2019s a waiter behind each chair. The little girl was sitting there, I don\u2019t she\u2019s ever, I don\u2019t\nwhat she\u2019s ever had in the way of food, or the way it was served, but I want you to know it\nwas quite elegant. And she brought a little bottle of perfume for me as a gift for letting her\nfamily know that her brother was still alive. That little bottle of perfume is the only thing that\nI have left. When I came back to the states and we staged at Camp Philip Morris \u2014 you know\nthey named the staging camps in France after cigarettes \u2014 I had a musette (ph) full of\nsouvenirs \u2014 perfume, lighters. I had a bottle of, I had a fifth of Three Feathers, which 1s\nbourbon liquor that my dad had given me two years before. He said, he wanted, he said,\n\u201cYasilah, (ph) I want you to give this to your colonel so he won\u2019t send you overseas.\u201d And I\nthought to my, I told my commanding officer, I said, \u201cMy dad wants me to give you this so\nyou won\u2019t send me overseas.\u201d We both had a good laugh. I thought if we landed safely, I'd\nbreak open the bottle. Every celebration that we had, I was going to use that bottle that my\ndad gave me. I never did. I never did because there was always liquor available. And this\nbecame kind of an icon, kind of a talisman. I thought as long as I had that, nothing\u2019s going to\nhappen to me. Because it somehow, it\u2019s somehow sacred. When I had this in my musette\n(ph) bag, with that little bottle of perfume, along with perfume for all the women in my\nfamily, Chanel, and Flue de Racai (ph), and all the Caron and I had lace from Belgium that I\nhad picked up and saved to take home as souvenirs. Everything was stolen out of my\nstateroom but that little bottle of perfume. And, the bottle of bourbon. And my dad and I had\nthe first two drinks out of that bottle. Well, I came back from the Riviera and kept working\nand for a while, we went, I was sent to Veeldflecken (ph). Now Veeldflecken (ph) was taken\nover by an Unrah (ph) team and we were already old hands at this. I only spent two weeks\nthere, about two weeks, and a member of the Unrah (ph) team was Kathleen Hulm (ph) who\nlater wrote \u201cA Nun\u2019s Story\u201d, that was made into a movie with Audrey Hepburn. And I met\nher and I have a copy of her book. I had a copy of her book but it\u2019s now in the archives, here\nin the museum. It\u2019s out of print and it\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful account of how a displaced\nperson camp is run, and how it should be run. All the trials, all the vicissitudes, all the\nproblems, all the glory and all the good feelings that you have when you see a job well done.\nI came back to Bamburg (ph) and by this time there was quite an attrition among the officers\nand enlisted men who were going back to the States. They\u2019d earned enough points to be sent\nback and I was put in, they had spread us out over several camps and I was sent to Koburg\n(ph) and that\u2019s where I had my greatest glory if there 1s such a thing. And I\u2019Il tell you what\nhappened at Koburg (ph).",
        "Q: Good. Let\u2019s take a break and then we\u2019ll come back to Koburg (ph). Good.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape #2",
        "Q: We\u2019re gonna start with now, in the fall of 1945. You come back from the Riviera and you\nhave been assigned to Koburg (ph).",
        "A: Right. It was quite a coup, actually, I was the only officer in the camp. I was the second\nlieutenant. I had six enlisted men who were gems. They had been in DP camps, they had\nworked in DP camps, and we were the only American army personnel in the camp. The\ncamp, however, held between 11,000 and 15,000 eastern Europeans, mostly Poles.",
        "Q: They were there when you got there?",
        "A: They were there when I got there. They\u2019d been collecting them. See, nothing travels faster\nthan a rumor in the army, or in a situation like this. When they told the people, the people\nwho\u2019d been slave laborers that they could get billeting and rations and so on, under the\nAmerican auspices, under the American army auspices, have a place to sleep, have a place to\neat, until they could be repatriated, but, on the other hand, many of them were already, had\nalready been repatriated and had come back. Because they had been fooled by Stalin. Stalin\neven sent special troops into the area to sort of prepare the people for coming home by\ntelling them that you\u2019re going to come home, you\u2019re going to be with your families, you\u2019re\ngoing to be on your farms, you\u2019re going to be in your villages, and life is going to be like it\nwas before. It didn\u2019t happen. Once the boxcars were sealed, I don\u2019t think they were really\nsealed in the manner that the boxcars were sealed, that\u2019s probably not a good word. Once\nthey were closed and they started the long trek to the East, when they got there, stories came\nback that they weren\u2019t even allowed to go into their own villages. That they went on to\nvarious goulag in Siberia and spent so much time because Stalin, Stalin sent his own son to\none of them, who\u2019d been in Germany as a slave laborer. He said they should have chosen\ndeath rather than work for the German war machine. That fought against Russia.",
        "Q: Were you present for any of these \u2014 what were they called, repatriation . . .",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: . . .transports.",
        "A: Yes. Many of them.",
        "Q: Those happened at Koburg (ph). People were organized to be sent back to Russia.",
        "A: We would organize, we would send them to a railhead at Lichtenfelds (ph) which was about\n15 kilometers from Koburg (ph), Koburg (ph). That was the railhead. We would put them on\ntrucks and the trucks, incidentally, belonged to the 1 1\" Panzer (ph) Division. They were SS\ntroops, run by Major McLean (ph), and this is a walking stick that he later carved and gave\nto me. Here it says, Coatsing (ph), that was their headquarters, May the 5\" 11\" Panzer (ph)\nDivision, 1945. Although it\u2019s a Scottish name, he was quite German. He had a complement\nof 175 vehicles, German vehicles. Some of them were halftracks, some were regular trucks,\nsome were similar to our jeeps, and some were what you might call pleasure cars, for\nofficers, perhaps an Opal, or one of the other small German car, Volkswagen. And we would\nload them onto these trucks. We gave them five days ration for the long trek back to Russia\nor Poland, to their villages. We saw that they were well clothed, we saw that families went\ntogether, quite unlike the transports that went to Treblinka and Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Were these people eager to go?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Willing to go?",
        "A: In the beginning. And then we had to force them to get on the trucks.",
        "Q: How many of these...",
        "A: 1500 a day.",
        "Q: For how long?",
        "A: It seemed to go on forever. But it was around, I guess this lasted, this lasted until about\nMarch of \u201946.",
        "Q: So, six months?",
        "A: Five or six months.",
        "Q: Daily?",
        "A: Almost daily. The constant\u2014we took a census of the camp from time to time. It wasn\u2019t a\ndaily census \u2014 maybe every week, every two weeks and found that the constant number was\nalways between 13,000 and 15,000 people. But there were around 1500 a day that left for the\nrailhead and around 1500 a day that came in from other camps, from the German\ncountryside, people who\u2019d continued to work, under the German \u2014 not as slave laborers. But\nsome of them stayed in Germany who heard about what was going on after they were being\nrepatriated. Some of the them wanted to stay in Germany and work on the German economy.\nThat didn\u2019t last too long. They started coming into camps where they could get rations, from\nthe American Army, from Unrah(ph), from Quakers, from \u2014 there were many organizations\nthat would send boxes of food in. Dry milk, dried eggs, whatever. And this was, this was the\nalmost, you\u2019d almost count on 1500 going out every day or two and we have of course, we\nhave photos of all that. They send \u2014 and they decorated the trucks with boughs. It looked like\nArbor Day. They put all sorts of tree branches on the trucks. Then they had huge photos of\nStalin and Lenin and they sang Russian songs and we had Russian officers at the exchange\npoints, at Lichtenfelds (ph) to see that everything was run properly, that they got on these\ntrains. Later on, to our shame, our halftracks drove up and guns were mounted on the\nhalftracks, and they were forced to get on the trains to go back.",
        "Q: When did that change happen? Was it \u2014 do you remember an incident where suddenly you\nknew that things were different or was it gradual?",
        "A: Actually, it was gradual. And then it got to the point where I didn\u2019t always go to the\nrailheads. I went there very seldom after it started running. To Lichtenfelds (ph).",
        "Q: But in the beginning, you would go?",
        "A: In the beginnings, I would go. On some of the trains there. . .",
        "Q: But you felt the people were genuinely . . .",
        "A: Happy. Happy, singing.",
        "Q: And later, when you say that the Americans had to force these people. What was the nature\nof that coercion?",
        "A: Maybe a little subterfuge. A little tell the story about how nice it was going to be after they\ngot there, that they were going to their own villages, using the same line that the Russians\nused. And the Russians were there to back us up, to help us with this.",
        "Q: But you knew that wasn\u2019t true?",
        "A: It slowly dawned on all of us. It\u2019s in all the books now \u2014 our disgraceful forced repatriation.\nBut we couldn\u2019t do anything else \u2014 they couldn\u2019t live with us for -- in the camps forever.\nThey couldn\u2019t live on the German economy forever. Even the Germans were having \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t sympathize with them that much, only as one human being to another \u2014 but they were\nhaving a difficult time. As a matter of fact, those who saved Jewish children started turning\nthem over to the American army so that we would make different billets and different camps\nfor them. And I think I showed you earlier, in the chronology of what happened during the\nwar, that the Joint Distribution Committee and they were a tremendous during the war, a\ntremendous help. They saved my life many times. Gathered up orphans from Buchenwald,\nin the Buchenwald area and sent them to France. I received orders from Third Army\nheadquarters to form an orphanage for Jewish children who\u2019d been turned back by the\nGermans who had saved them during the war and were turning them back to the army to be\nfed and clothed by army personnel. And there was a sanitarium, the Strooth (ph) Sanitarium.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve mentioned that name in years. But now I know, that was the name of it.\nThe Strooth (ph) Sanitarium near Onzbock (ph). And I was to get 40 orphans to billet there\nand my main adversary was an American officer who received orders about the same time\nthat I did for the orphans, he received orders to find billets for returning German prisoners of\nwar. And I had to put up a big fight to get this Strooth (ph) Sanitarium for my orphans. And\ninstead of getting 40, over 200 came in. And while I\u2019m on the story, the Joint Distribution\nCommittee had teachers, or they had people who \u2014 they were preparing these orphans for\nIsrael, like the Opon (ph) and they taught them Hebrew, they were teaching them folk\ndancing. And it was a wonderful, wonderful camp and wonderful experience for them. And\none day, one -- a little girl from the camp came into my office and gave me that block of\nwood that\u2019s now in the archives at the museum. She had carved what looked like the Fleur\nde Lee (ph) that the Girl Scouts \u2014 apparently they were basing their training perhaps on what\nthey do with the Girl Scouts. And she gave this to me and I saved it all these years, 50 years,\nuntil I came here 1n the end of June to turn over a lot of my artifacts and that\u2019s one of the\nthings that I gave to the museum. I later heard from her, from Israel, it was Palestine then,\ntelling me how happy she was. I haven\u2019t been able to find that letter. I saved all the letters\nthat I received. My dear, dear sisters saved all the letters that I wrote for four years in the\narmy and I have a journal for almost every day because I wrote quite a bit and I had a little\nhigh school girl working in my home the past month or so before school started and she was\nputting the letters into polyurethane sleeves and so far she\u2019s used 1200 sleeves. It doesn\u2019t\nmean I wrote 1200 letters. This is just the year of 1945 and beginning of \u201946 before I came\nhome. But several of my letters were five and six pages long. But I\u2019m so happy to have this\nall, all four years preserved. And also letters that I got from different people \u2014 I\u2019m doing the\nsame thing with them. But I haven\u2019t found her letter. I haven\u2019t found her letter.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go to spring of \u201946 and these repatriation transports are coming to an end you said more\nor less in March?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Of that year?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And they were getting less pleasant.",
        "A: Well, not only were they coming to an end, but the army involvement was becoming less and\nless and they were being turned over to Unrah (ph). The camps were being run by Unrah\n(ph). Now before that time, I had to suffer through another inspection that turned out to be\nquite a coup for me. Major General Robertson, commanding general of the 15\" Corps, I\nbelieve it was, came into my camp, with Major General Richardson. And he, too, was very\ncomplimentary and then he left. He sent back a letter of commendation which I have here.\nYes. 15\" Corps. Major General Robertson. \u201cI wish to take this opportunity to commend you\nfor the excellent work you\u2019ve done at Koburg (ph) Displaced Persons Camp. My recent\ninspection revealed that your earnest efforts and ingenius use of all available facilities have\nsolved many seemingly hopeless problems. A fine organization and administration of the\ncamp reflects the highest credit upon you and your accomplishments.\u201d",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about those \u2014 ingentuses that he\u2019s referring to. Why does it take ingeniuses to run a\ncamp?",
        "A: Well...",
        "Q: What was the...",
        "A: Well, I'll give you one example. We had to find enough coal and enough wood to heat the\ncauldrons that made the food. The main food was soups, different soups.",
        "Q: You were feeding 11,000...",
        "A: 11,000 people a day. We had to cut down entire forests, to get wood to burn 1n the kitchens.",
        "Q: You'd just go out in the nearby countryside. . .",
        "A: We\u2019d go out, well, that\u2019s where the German \u2014 the German battalion that worked with me \u2014\nthey were very good at ferreting out these places. It so happened that one of them belonged\nto a baroness. She came into my camp and begged me not to touch her trees. We had to. We\nhad to. It was in our area and we needed, we needed the wood. Before \u2014 now, do you know\nthat Germany was divided into four parts after the war? The American Occupied Zone of\nGermany, the British, French and Russian Occupied Zone. During the early days of the\nRussian occupation of Germany, which was just north of us, I found out that there was a\nwarehouse that had the leather pants that the SS troop, the motorcycle troops wore. And\nthere were hundreds of thousands of those leather pants. So Germans, well, many Europeans\nlove rubber stamps. If something has a rubber stamp on it, 1t must be authentic. So I had a\nbunch of rubber stamps made up, in Koburg (ph), in one of the offices that made them and it\nsaid, \u201cPlease give bearer, whatever, the above merchandise,\u201d and stamped it military\ngovernment, Unites States Military Government. I\u2019ve forgotten now what I put on it. But I\nsent these German trucks up to Soldenburg (ph), which was just beyond the American\nOccupied Zone of Germany and into the Russian Occupied Zone. And they loaded those\ntrucks up with all the leather pants. Now the reason I did that is because in my zone, my area,\nthere was a shoe factory. They didn\u2019t have any uppers, but they had all the Airsots (ph)\nleathers, Airsots (ph) soles. And we were buying these things, we were buying equipment\nfrom the German \u2014 or articles of clothing from the Germans for the DPs and for the slave\nlaborers. We were able, with one pair of leather pants, we were able to make six pairs of\nshoes. Now I wanted to bring one pair home, as a souvenir, but I thought if I bring a pair of\nshoes home, that means somebody\u2019s going to have to without shoes, and I didn\u2019t. Oh, oh, do\nI think of that, when I see the shoes in the museum. That\u2019s what I think about \u2014 what we did\nso that they\u2019d have shoes. DPs. And what they did, and what they did when they took the\nshoes off -- the Jews before going in the undressing rooms -- before going into the\ncrematoria. So worried that our men wouldn\u2019t have shoes and they were so worried that they\ncouldn\u2019t take \u2018em off fast enough. They\u2019re in the bin, aren\u2019t they \u2014 in the museum. That\u2019s\nwhat I think about. Well, I received a letter of commendation from another major. I won\u2019t\nread it \u2014 it\u2019s on record, thanking me for this ingenuity. But you do things. I don\u2019t know\nwhere it comes from. You \u2014 I set up a theater. You have pictures of that. They had their own\nentertainment. We had a hospital \u2014 we had a wonderful hospital. I also had Polish army\npersonnel attached to my camp.",
        "Q: How did that happen? How did they happen to be here?",
        "A: They had been slave laborers but they had been taken as prisoners. But they were army\nofficers. They were Polish army officers and the Polish army in exile in London decreed that\nthey work in these camps to help repatriate the Poles. And if I can put my hand on it right\naway, maybe I won\u2019t take the time now, but they wore patches that said Polish Army\nDisplaced Person, Third Army, Number Ten. That was my camp. DPTA10 \u2014 that was the\nname of my camp. Oh, what a badge of honor that was \u2014 for them. It gave them the run of\nthe camp. They had wonderful uniforms to wear \u2014 it was kind of a mixed uniform \u2014\nAmerican officer uniform and Polish officer uniforms. But they wore their berets with the\nPolish emblem on it and this nice emblem wasn\u2019t like the yellow Star of David the Jews had\nto wear, in disgrace.",
        "Q: What was the \u2014 what were living conditions like for people at Koburg (ph)? There were big\nformer German army barracks where people were housed?",
        "A: They were housed in the barracks . . .",
        "Q: Can you describe the living situation? Were families together?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Not only were families together, but sometimes when they got their potato rations,\nthey made vodka. And every once in a while, we had to raid the camp, when we knew that\nthere were stills, and people told us, because, actually, it was \u2014 1t had become poisonous, a\nlot of the vodka that they made. I don\u2019t know what they mixed it with. They mixed it with\nalcohol that you put in cars and there were some horrible scenes. But they lived, I assure\nyou, they lived much better than they had ever lived up until that time under the German\nrule.",
        "Q: They had three meals a day?",
        "A: They had three meals a day. Not only did they have three meals a day but we had a\nnutritionist attached to the camp. Two nutritionists \u2014 we had an American nutritionist and\none on the Unrah (ph) team. There was a schedule, there was a roster \u2014 so many calories for\nadults, so many calories for children at a certain age, so many calories for youngsters, those\nwho got skim milk, those got regular milk with cream. Incidentally, Strooth (ph) Sanitarium,\nfor the orphans, was near Striker\u2019s Farm. Striker, who was the number one Jew-Baiter (ph)\nof Germany \u2014 I saw him \u2014 I went to the Nuremburg war trials one day. We were able to get\neggs and butter and milk from his farm. His farm functioned during the entire war \u2014 it never\nstopped producing. At first 1t bothered me and then I thought why should it bother me?\nWe\u2019re getting all this good stuff from him. Incidentally, we got fresh vegetables and butter\nand fresh meat from the German economy. We had demands, we had regular requisitions\nthat we gave the military, the German military command, in each city, and they had to\nsupply so much.",
        "Q: And they did?",
        "A: And they did. And they cried plenty. I have letters here, telling us that it\u2019s getting more and\nmore difficult to supply us with what, with what we\u2019re requesting. Well, we cut it down. We\ncompromised. But we weren\u2019t . We were a little more humane.",
        "Q: So some of the supplies were coming from the army. . .",
        "A: Army.",
        "Q: And some you would work through the local German military authorities and they would\nsupply...",
        "A: The German, actually, the German civilian. It was called, had the name here, called the\nGerman Food Commission, I believe. And they had set up this commission to supply fresh\nfood for the camps.",
        "Q: And what kind of \u2014 vegetables grown locally?",
        "A: Yes. Whatever they could get \u2014 beans, corn, lentils which of course is a form of beans.",
        "Q: And some fresh meat?",
        "A: Fresh meat. I rather think some of the nice meat we got was horse meat. But as long as, as\nlong, and I\u2019ve eaten it. As long as I didn\u2019t know what it was, it didn\u2019t bother me. And it was\nsupplemented by different charity organizations that would send food in.",
        "Q: So you were constantly balancing what you had in your warehouse with how many people\nwere around and how many were expected...",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But you never really knew from month to month how many people you were going to have?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: But somehow it worked out, somehow it worked out. There were times, there were times\nwhen I felt like I was in a pressure cooker and I had to let off some steam. And there was a\nvery, you couldn\u2019t call it a mountain, \u2018course Bavaria 1s beautiful and there\u2019s all sorts of\nmountains around in the area, but a couple of times I had to get in my jeep and drive up to\nthe highest point and get out and scream. Just scream. To know what?",
        "Q: Just because you felt so much pressure, so tense? Can you describe some of \u2014 specific\nreasons why you would feel tense? Was it negotiating with people that was difficult for you\n\u2014 what was it?",
        "A: Well, it was getting orders that camp was going to be inspected and trying to get everybody\nto work, to see that things were clean. And inspect the kitchens, to see, we didn\u2019t want\ntyphus to break out. We didn\u2019t want any of the, any contagious diseases. We didn\u2019t, we kept\nfighting, we kept fighting food sources. That was the main thing. And whenever a shipment\ncame in, right into the camp, people knew about it. Especially, if they came, if they were\nthings that came, not from the army or from the German economy but things that came in\nfrom some of the other support groups. I keep saying Quakers because they were really very\npredominant in this but there were other \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think of some of the other civilian\ngroups in the United States that sent food over. But when those, when those shipments came\nin, they would gather around the truck and almost act like, I don\u2019t like to use the word\nanimals, but it, everybody wanted to get in front. \u201cThrow me a box of this. Throw this to me.\nI want this. Throw it. I\u2019m here. Throw it to me. Ah, here, I need this. My child needs this.\u201d\n\u2018\u201cHere\u2019s some dry milk. Here\u2019s some Hersheys, some Hersheys candy bars. Cigarettes.\u201d\nThese are the things that were prized and that\u2019s what I had my nightmares over after I got\nhome, many, many months later.",
        "Q: Those scenes of people trying to get things...",
        "A: I'd wake up and look at the end of the bed and I'd see these people coming over it, over my\nknees, and screaming for food.",
        "Q: Did you get satisfaction at the time, that you were able to help them, or did it always feel like\nyou couldn\u2019t do enough?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There were a lot of perks, believe me. I was amply repaid. And not\njust, 1t was, it was a very good feeling to know that you\u2019re helping these people. Because of,\nbecause of the, because of the commendation that I got, from Major General Robertson, I\nwas able to, he promoted me to captain. A major general can do that \u2014 they call it a\nbattlefield promotion. That was wonderful. I went in as a private and thought, gee, I\u2019d like to\ncome out as a captain. That seemed like \u2014 I didn\u2019t want anything more. And it did happen.\nAnd then because of Major General Robertson, because of this letter of commendation, it\nentitled me to the army commendation medal, which I have. And I thought I brought it in\nhere.",
        "Q: Did, in your camp, did you have, I know you had a flow in and out of people from different\nplaces but what was the situation in Koburg (ph) in, let\u2019s say the first six months or so, for\nJewish DPs? Did you have a lot of Jewish people there?",
        "A: Yes, but before I go into that...",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In sending the western Europeans home, and I\u2019Il come back to that, in sending the western\nEuropeans home, we had a French team attached to the camp and it was called the MMLA,\nMission Militaire Liaison (ph) Administratif. We had three French officers, men, and one\nfemale officer. The female officer was Russian, of Russian origin, but had lived in France\nmany years. And they helped us repatriate the western Europeans. And they were\ntremendous help. One was a doctor, two of them, two of them were doctors. One wore a\nsignet ring \u2014 it didn\u2019t mean anything to me at the time, and Ill tell you what happened much\nlater on, but he was a Bourbon (ph), he was of the Bourbon (ph) royalty. French Bourbon\n(ph). And the most helpful was the woman because I had all these eastern Europeans, too, as\nwell as the western Europeans. And they wanted to stay, they worked very hard and it was\nan opportunity for them to learn English, from us, and we learned as much French as we\ncould from them. Now, you asked me, about the camp that I was coming back to...",
        "Q: I asked you about Jews.",
        "A: The Jews.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Up until that time, up until that time, there were Jews, but they came in as DPs. This was in\nthe beginning. They came into camp and when I knew who they were, and they had their\nown way of, of, of being in their own group. And when they realized that this camp was\nreally a repatriation camp, a camp that was sending people back east, when they realized\nthey couldn\u2019t go back, then they wanted to get to Jewish camps. And who took them to the\nJewish camps? What irony. My German major from the Panzer (ph) Division in his trucks.\nLoaded them up \u2014 and he knew. And I knew that he knew. But they got very good treatment\nand they went to camps in southern Bavaria. There was Ogsburg (ph), there was a camp in\nOgsburg (ph), there was a camp at Strowbing (ph), there was a camp, there was one they\ncalled the Funk Casairn (ph). Casairn (ph) means camp. I knew that that was a Jewish camp\nand he and his men had orders to take the Jews.",
        "Q: So after what period of time \u2014 do you remember when that was, in the winter of \u201945, maybe,\nthat soon?",
        "A: Early \u00b046.",
        "Q: Early \u00b046.",
        "A: Beginning, beginning in winter of \u201945 and early \u201946. Now, when, when Unrah (ph) started\ntaking over the camps, I was transferred. I\u2019m trying to think if there was anything more I\nwanted to tell you about Koburg, except that 1t was running rather smoothly, although people\nstarted trickling back and telling their countrymen that they weren\u2019t allowed to go home, that\nthey were sent to Siberia. So that meant that more came in and that we would have to\ncontinue to take care of them. On Bastille Day in camp, one of the French officers almost\nblew up the camp celebrating Bastille Day. Jacques Jencam (ph) was his name. And when he\nleft, he told me if I ever got to Paris to be sure and look him up, which I later did, but that\u2019s,\nPll go into that. Now, I, when the work was running smoothly in the camps, and, as I said,\nthey had their own hospitals, they had their own entertainment. We were invited to many of\nthe affairs that they had in camp, as guests of honor, and I went. I danced to many a oom-\npah-pah band and Polish, and the polka. I liked to dance. Then I was transferred to Onzbock\n(ph) which was outside of Nuremburg. And I was put in charge of several DP camps and\nalso the exchange point at Hoapf, (ph) Germany, and we have that on the map. Now the\nreason it was called an exchange point is because, apparently, and I believe it was at the\nYalta Conference, we, that is the four major powers, said that we would repatriate the\nGermans, also, who had been displaced because of war. German for German, who had been\ndisplaced prior to September the 1\u00b0, 1936. And they all, and they came from Russian zone\ninto the American zone through Hoapf (ph), Germany. And I was in charge of that exchange\npoint. Excuse me. And it was through this exchange point, the Jews came in. They also had\ngone back to Poland, or wherever. And they thought that they, well they did, they knew their\nhomes were already occupied, their farms had been occupied, and they were being killed.\nThe progroms had started. A little anecdote. When the Allies got onto the government of\nPoland, after the war, immediately after the war, and started chastising them for starting\nthese anti-Semitic picadilloes again, this one telegram that they got, or communicae that they\ngot, said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can be so unhappy with us. We\u2019ve only burned one\nsynagogue since last August.\u201d This 1s what was happening. Lodz (ph), Lodz (ph), the city of\nLodz (ph), that had 200,000 Jews before the war, two of them came back. The Lodz (ph)\nUprising. When they were subdued, they were all taken out, but 40 of them hid 1n the, in\nvarious cellars, underground sewers. This is why they either didn\u2019t go, or went and came\nback. Poles wanted to kill them. They didn\u2019t want to give up their homes. They didn\u2019t want\nto give up their farms. I\u2019m not talking about the Poles that came to American during the\nmass migration in 1906 and 1909. They came for the same reason my folks came \u2014 to get\naway from religious persecution and to have a better life for their children. There was a\nPolish family that took care of all of us in Saint, little St. Joseph, Missouri. They were like\nbrothers and sisters to my father and mother because they spoke Polish. My folks did too --\nRussian Polish. These are people that had been so indoctrinated with the hatred who had\nhelped, I think they showed the Nazis a few things, and so did the Estonians and Lithuanians\nand the Latvians. They came out smelling like a rose, too, after the war. To make Patton say,\nwhen he talked about the dirty, filthy Jews, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re nothing like the Estonians.\u201d\nWell, how could they be? Where was the soap? Where were the water levels in the billets\nthat they were in? There wasn\u2019t any water, there wasn\u2019t any running water! How could they\nuse the latrines or the toilets? He didn\u2019t think about that. And it was against his Anglo-Saxon\nsensitivities to put them in German homes. You can\u2019t displace Germans! For the Jews? \u201cI\ncan\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. I\u2019m digressing.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about Hoapf (ph).",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you organize that? It sounds like a big job.",
        "A: It was a big job. It was a big job and I didn\u2019t do it alone. We had security troops there\nstationed...",
        "Q: Can you remind me, give me a little time frame here? Do you remember roughly when you\nwent to that assignment?",
        "A: March.",
        "Q: Were we talking March?",
        "A: March. We\u2019re talking about March, \u201946.",
        "Q: Spring.",
        "A: February, March.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We had security patrols around there and we had, we had people, offices set up and they all\nhad papers. They all had the, they all had the papers. Everyone had papers . . .",
        "Q: Everyone...",
        "A: Germans had papers, the Jews coming across had their papers. I don\u2019t think that they were\nthe correct papers, I know that they weren\u2019t. I know that they were false papers but they were\ncoming in as German nationals. And they had been doing that for months. I know at least\nthat \u2019d helped about 900 come through. And this one time, I might as well get onto this\nstory, because it happened. There were 125 caught coming, Jews, coming across the border\nwith, at Hoapf (ph). They had the security patrol pick them up and he called in Onzbock\n(ph), and wanted to know what to do with them. I said, \u201cPut them all in jail at Hoapf (ph).\u201d\nNow this is in Mittenwald (ph). Mittenwald (ph) is the county and Hoapf (ph) is the main\ncity. The Joint Distribution Committee was working out of the jail and they were handling\nall the Jews, many of the Jews that were coming through. Now there\u2019s a lot that enters into\nthis. The extreme efficiency of the Germans. By now the trains were running, by now the\nelectricity was on, all the gas, water and that wasn\u2019t too long after the war ended.",
        "Q: Less than a year.",
        "A: Less than a year. And the people that were supposed to be doing all this were still back in the\nmilitary government schools at the University, the University of Michigan, Harvard or Yale\n\u2014 the Ivy League schools. They were learning German, they were learning Polish, they were\nlearning Russian, they were learning French, so that they\u2019d know how to handle the DPs\nwhen they got to Europe. They got there after it was all over. But it worked. And now this\nwas an officer \u2014 this was a captain, the security officer and he wanted to know what to do\nwith their papers. I said, \u201cSend them to me by courier,\u201d and incidentally, among my pictures\nthat I gave Bob Kesting (ph), just yesterday, I have a picture of the courier. And it got to me,\nin Onzbock (ph), to my billet, at the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel, about three in the morning,\nand I burned them. I don\u2019t know why. It just seemed to be the thing to do. You have\nevidence of some transgression \u2014 you get rid of it.",
        "Q: And \u2014 meaning you knew these were false papers.",
        "A: It really didn\u2019t matter \u2014 about burning them because I knew that they could make new\npapers. It amounted to just the same as the paper \u2014 but I didn\u2019t want to have any of the\nevidence because of what was going to happen. I knew I would have to account for it. By\nmorning, by morning, they were all out of jail. The guards had been bribed with money, with\ndrinks, with liquor and the Jews were on trains, again going to Jewish DP camps in the\nAmerican Occupied Zone of Germany. The story doesn\u2019t end there with me. I was called\ninto the office\u2014my commanding officer\u2019s office \u2014 who was a colonel. And I shan\u2019t tell you\nhis name. I\u2019ve never mentioned his name. He was regular army. He had appropriated the\nfinest chalet in Onzbock, for his family. They were coming over. After all, this was a war of\noccupation. He had appropriated one of Hitler\u2019s specially built Mercedes-Benz bullet-proof\ntouring cars for his own. And he called me in because the security officer at Hoapf (ph) told\nhim what had happened. He said, \u201cWhat do you know about this?\u201d I said \u201cWell, I know\nthat 125 Jews, approximately, 125 Jews tried to come across the border last night and I told\nthe captain to put them all in jail.\u201d He said \u201cWell, they\u2019re all gone now. Where do you think\nthey are?\u2019 And I said \u201cWell, I think they\u2019re all very happily ensconced in Jewish DP camps\nin Bavaria, in southern Germany.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, this is conduct unbecoming an\nAmerican officer and I\u2019m going to have to court-martial you.\u201d Well. \u201cWe, Pll send for\nsomeone from the Judge Advocate Division, Third Army headquarters to come up and take a\ndeposition. Meanwhile, you\u2019re under arrest of quarters at the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel.\u201d I\nfound this the other night. I knew something would happen \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be able to put my\nhands on these things. Nevertheless, that\u2019s where we were billeted. It was a little\nembarrassing to go from his office, with two MPs, one on each side of me and put me under\narrest of quarters in my hotel room. And I could only leave to go to eat, also, under guard.\nHe, I saw him afterwards, before the, it would have been the attorney from the judge\nadvocate, judge advocate\u2019s office, whatever, to come up and take a deposition prior to a\ncourt martial \u2014 I saw him. My colonel. And I said, \u201cColonel\u201d \u2014 now I want you to know that\nI was just a kid, according to what I am now, I was just a kid, but you grow up very fast in\nthe army. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me if you court martial me. I\u2019m\nsure I'll be breaking rocks at Fort Leavenworth. But you\u2019re going to be right beside me.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cI'll just have to tell them how you allowed all your men\nto go into my DP camps, your officers gave them furloughs and leaves to go into my DP\ncamps and shack up with the women in the camp. You gave them extra rations. You drew\narmy rations that you shouldn\u2019t have so that they could have a wonderful time sleeping with\nmy women in the camps!\u201d They were so bold and so blazen about this that they walked\naround in their uniforms. They didn\u2019t even bother to get into civilian clothes.",
        "Q: And that was forbidden, that they should go...",
        "A: Of course. Yes. Couldn\u2019t fraternize with them at all. There were all sorts of directives. We\nhad a little pamphlet that Bradley put out. It\u2019s in the archives \u2014 I gave it to them. \u201cSo Pll\nhave to tell them that.\u201d And he thought for a moment. I said, \u201c\u201cYou know, you can delegate\ncommand in the army, as a colonel, you can tell me, as a captain, what to do, but the\nresponsibility is still your responsibility. And all this happened under your nose.\u201d What\u2019s\n125 Jews? There were close to a thousand. This had been going on for months. And it\nworked. It didn\u2019t mean anything to him. The lives of 125 Jews, or even a thousand,\ncompared to what he was going to have after his family came over. This fine chalet in\nOnzbock (ph) where they could go skiing at Garmish (ph), Garmish Pardonkershem (ph).\nWhere they could go into Nuremburg, where the Passion Play already started. And over\nAmergal (ph), they could have that. Oh, I don\u2019t know how he ended up. Probably, may be,\nmaybe made general one day, who knows? I was, but. . .",
        "Q: We\u2019re about to run out of time. Let\u2019s pick up on the next reel.",
        "A: Alright.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Dr. Friedman, you were telling us, in the last tape about your having allowed these 125 Jews\nto come through Hoapf (ph), which means that you understood the underground organization\nthat had been created in Europe to move Jews from east to west and eventually down to the\nMediterranean \u2014 their passage to Palestine.",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "Q: Explain how you became aware of this and how do you witness its function?",
        "A: That\u2019s very good. Sometime in the summer of \u201945, perhaps around June...",
        "Q: \u201945? Right after the end of the war?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. A group of Palestinian officers, now we must remember it wasn\u2019t called Israel\nthen, they were Jewish officers who had fought with the Palestinian brigade in North Africa.\nAnd they had permission from Third Army headquarters and they had their papers with them\nand they had a roster of families and names with them. And you have a picture of that in\nyour archives. And I\u2019m so proud of them. I\u2019m standing right in the middle of them. I just\nwanted to be with them because of what they were doing. They were trying to find,\nostensibly, they were trying to find, survivors of the relatives of members of the Palestinian\nBrigade. Well, this is true, they were, and they did find as many as they could. But, it was to\nbe a cover for the Jewish Underground. And what they were trying to do was to get the\nsympathies of the American Jewish officers, mostly American Jewish officers, although a\nvery dear friend of mine that I worked with who is non-Jewish helped a lot. And therein lies\nanother story but, and when they realized that I would do all that I could to help out, they,\nthey were satisfied and pleased. And I think, I think if, if the museum would blow up this\nphoto that I had, that there might be some faces on there that are easily recognizable because\nI\u2019m sure that they later became leaders in the state of Israel or in, again, with repatriation of,\nof Jewish DPs, Jewish slave laborers. And I think we might find among them some who had\nreally dedicated the rest of their lives to this type of work.",
        "Q: And how, how did the, this sort of, you say ostensibly they were looking for relatives, how\ndid the sort of surreptitious become communicated to you? Did they take you aside and tell\nyou? Or was it all reading between the lines?",
        "A: No, no, I was told.",
        "Q: Directly.",
        "A: I was told, yes. I was told when they found out that \u2014 I had actually been sending, I\u2019d been\nsending Jews. They knew and I told them that I was sending them with the German battalion\nto various camps and so it wasn\u2019t, it really wasn\u2019t all that new for me to do. All it meant was\nthat they knew that they could come into my camp, you know, with an open heart, and\nfreely, and without fear of being spied upon and told to go back.",
        "Q: We should say for the record, that at the time, this migration was an illegal migration\nbecause it was not, people were not being allowed to go into Palestine.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They had closed it immigration.",
        "A: Yes. The White Paper, the Offer Declaration, the, the many sad stories of barely getting to\nthe shores and not being allowed to land. Incidentally, they were not only coming from Italy,\nthey were coming from Greece, also.",
        "Q: Those ships.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And once then, so you met these soldiers in the summer of \u201945?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And it was clear to you immediately that there was this continent-wide organization?",
        "A: In Bavaria, anyway.",
        "Q: And you, did you have contact with them \u2014 those specific soldiers, subsequently?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or other...",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: And did they identify themselves as an organization?",
        "A: Yes. They had, they had legitimate papers that were given to them by the military\ngovernment of the Third Army. They\u2019d come up, the papers were dated and had the\nletterheads \u2014 were from the Third Army Headquarters at Bod Toles (ph) which was south of\nMunich and it was very legitimate. The legitimate part was that they were looking for\nsurvivors. The other part was that they were also looking for people who were sympathetic\ntowards getting the Jews into camps, helping them get into camps. But, God bless the Jews,\nthey sort of organized themselves and knew where they wanted to go, and knew how to get\nthere. They just, they just couldn\u2019t have, didn\u2019t want any interference. There was still, you\nsee when the war ended, there was such a, there was such a, a, thrust by the Germans, the\nyoung Germans, to poison the minds of the American soldiers. Now these were soldiers who\nhad never fought in any of the wars, they were fresh from the States and they came in and\nthey saw all the dirty DPs and they saw the dirty French and they saw the dirty Poles, and\nthey saw the dirty this and the dirty that, and the nice clean efficient Germans. Well, of\ncourse they were. All the soap went to Germany. \u201cCourse they might have been washing\nthemselves with one of their ancestors, I don\u2019t know. We know how some of the soap was\nmade. In fact, I have a ship, or had one, that had the Nina, one of Columbus\u2019s vessels, a\ncopy of it, and the sails were made out of human skin. And I wanted to bring it back and put\nit in one of the museums in St. Joe. And I did bring it back, but it\u2019s disappeared.",
        "Q: So what you\u2019re saying is that the G.I.s were strongly prejudiced against Jewish people . . .",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ... after the war?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Not all. Not all but this was just another little murder. This was another little battle\nthat we had to contend with. They didn\u2019t have to draw, they didn\u2019t have to draw KP\nanymore. The Germans did that, the Germans peeled the potatoes, the Germans did the\ncooking for the army. They didn\u2019t have to draw extensive guard duty. You know, there was\nno more, you know there was no more fear of being invaded, of having your, your command\npost taken over by Germans or any kind of invading army. Was no longer in existence. All\nthey had to do was sleep with the German girls and drink the champagne and schnapps. It\nwas a great life! We didn\u2019t want these dirty people to interfere with it. Get rid of \u2018em. Put\n\u2018em in jail.",
        "Q: And that was the overwhelming sentiment, you think, of the average G.I.?",
        "A: I really do. Maybe I\u2019m very cynical about it, maybe I\u2019m overemphasizing it, but I saw it\nright after the war ended. Perhaps with all the directives that were sent out and that little\nbooklet that every soldier had to have, that Omar Bradley \u2014 you have it, they have it at the\nmuseum. I gave it to them. Perhaps with that, 1f they complied with what he asked them to,\nthings might have been better afterwards. But they were seeing the world through Uncle Sam\nand having a ball. They knew nothing about what went before. If they had read about it, or if\nthey were told about it, it didn\u2019t have the force or the power or the \u2014 it didn\u2019t affect them the\nway it did the soldiers who were right there and really knew what had happened.",
        "Q: By that you mean \u2014 what?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t go into the concentration camps.",
        "Q: Most of the G.I.s never did. So they didn\u2019t really understand . . .",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: ... what these people, or who these people were and what they\u2019d been through. Didn\u2019t \u2014\nEisenhower seems was very adamant about getting the word out...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ... about what had happened in these camps. He invited journalists to come immediately . . .",
        "A: It\u2019s true.",
        "Q: ... camera crews came right away. He brought in civilians from and he and other officers\ninsisted that civilian, that German civilians be brought to see what had happened. So he, he\nseemed to be making \u2014 there seemed to be some effort being made to let the world know .. .",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ... what was happening.",
        "A: Yes. And Truman followed suit. Truman did the same thing after he went after because\nRoosevelt died during this time, \u201945...",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: ... and Truman wanted separate camps set up for Jews if the \u2014 go into the German homes,\nhad no qualms about it. Didn\u2019t bother them to go into the Jewish homes and kick everybody\nout.",
        "Q: But you are, I think saying, that part of the reason for the surreptitious nature of this effort to\nget Jews out was resistance by American military personnel, as well as the law prohibiting\nJews from migrating to Palestine.",
        "A: Well, you know, everybody was torn during those times. If you wanted to obey directives, if\nyou knew that they couldn\u2019t land in Palestine, then you tried to do \u2014 I\u2019m talking about\nregular army \u2014 you thought why, why would I put them in camps? Or why, why would I try\nto get them down to Italy so that they could get on ships for Israel \u2018cause they\u2019re not going to\ntake them anyway? They won\u2019t take them \u2014 they started taking them in Brazil, incidentally.\nWe didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t take them until much later but that\u2019s a whole other story. Again, it was\nvery chaotic, even at that time, as to what to do. Most important thing was to see that they\nwere well fed and clothed and had some degree of contentment and family because they,\nand, in some way, and some way that they could really reckon with their tremendous loss.",
        "Q: And the people that were coming from east to west, among them the 125 that you have\nalready described \u2014 who were they, mostly?",
        "A: They were mostly Jews who had gone back to Poland.",
        "Q: And...",
        "A: And found, they were either being killed, or they killed, some of them. There\u2019s records,\nthere\u2019s, there\u2019s documentation of some who did this. Couldn\u2019t get back into their homes.\nLook, it had been how many years since they\u2019d been gone? If we go back to \u201933 and now,\nwell not so much in Poland, we\u2019ll go to \u201939 and here it\u2019s \u201945, \u201946 \u2014 people\u2019d been living in\ntheir homes for five years and tilling the soil, their farms, milking their cows and had a\ndegree of prosperity that they had never known before. The Russians, the Poles, who had\ntaken over, mostly Poland, Lithuania, had taken over the Jewish homes. They didn\u2019t want\nthem back and they knew that if they stayed they would, 1n all probability, be killed because\nthe progroms were starting again. Those were the ones who were coming back and they\ndidn\u2019t want to stay in the Russian zone. They knew that they would get better treatment in\nthe American zone. And by coming into the American zone, they could get closer, and\ncloser, and closer to either the United States or Israel. Those were the two main places that\nthey wanted to go.",
        "Q: Do you have any sense of how many people, Jewish people, you may have helped come\nthrough Hoapf (ph) other \u2014 was it those 125 or were there more?",
        "A: Yes, there were more. There were more. I...",
        "Q: Were they coming in all the time, every day for a period of time?",
        "A: No. No. No. No. I estimate, at one time, that as closely as I could remember, that there must\nhave been around 900, close to 900 to a thousand who had come through there. I know\nbecause that\u2019s the figure that I threw at my commanding officer.",
        "Q: And they were in small groups? And always sort of a similar situation with papers ...",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: ... that had been supplied to them by...",
        "A: Either themselves, their own little group, their own little group leader, the Joint Distribution\nCommittee, with the ubiquitous rubber stamp. That rubber stamp had to be on everything \u2014\ndidn\u2019t mean anything. Well, it did mean something. It meant that the, that the illegal papers\nwere legal.",
        "Q: Lots of times there were guards that were bribed...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you ever involved in that kind of thing?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It would have been done on the other side of the border?",
        "A: And then when they came across to get on trains...",
        "Q: So yours was a position to accept or deny. You weren\u2019t actually, you were not sort of part of\ntheir. . .",
        "A: Migration.",
        "Q: ... bureaucracy in a sense.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: But you had the \u2014 you could make the decision to let them in or not let them in.",
        "A: Yeah, but I had to be very careful, you see. I had, I had, above all, I was an American army\nofficer. I was in charge of the other Displaced Person Camps in the area, as well as this\nexchange point so I had to sort of walk",
        "Q: You were highly visible.",
        "A: Yes. Kind of a thin line. I really couldn\u2019t do anything. I couldn\u2019t go to Hoapf (ph) and\noversee this transfer unless .. .",
        "Q: Because that would be obvious, sort of participating . . .",
        "A: Yeah, I could, yes, I could oversee the German transfer. But it was carried along as the same\ntime as the Jews were coming across. So it was best just to let 1t happen.",
        "Q: And some of them then, I guess, would come into the camps that you were overseeing?",
        "A: That, not from Hoapf (ph), not so much, no. By that time, they were going into Jewish\ncamps.",
        "Q: And none of those were among your ten?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you ever have a chance to meet up with any of these groups of people at any...",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: ... any of these thousand people?",
        "A: No. Only the one, no. None of those. But of course those who came through my camp at\nKoburg (ph), I knew when they were coming through and I knew when they were going out\nwith the, in the trucks and they got special care \u2014 food, clothing. Years later, well let\u2019s go\nback to where, if you like, where I was almost court-martialed. Is that alright? Anyway, I\nwas put under arrest of quarters in Onzbock (ph). In the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel. And as I\nsaid before, I told the colonel that you can\u2019t, that the responsibility was all his and it was\nunder his command. Now and he had all his family coming over, they were all ready to come\nover for the duration, however long that was going to be. And the next day, there were orders\nthat came from Third Army Headquarters sending me home. That\u2019s among the orders that\nyou have. Now they would send divisions home, they would send battalions home, and my\norders came through, one person, Captain Joe Friedman, report to Camp Philip Morris. And\nI was escorted by the two military government, by the two MPs, to the train. We went by car\nto Frankfurt \u2014 we got on the train there for Paris. Now Jacques Jangcam (ph), who had the\nBourbon (ph) signet ring, or crest, told me that if I ever got to Paris, to call him. Well, we\nhad to change trains, either from the Guardinore (ph), or whatever. I don\u2019t remember\nbecause, because it\u2019s been 50 years ago. But I took a chance and I called him. Had his phone\nnumber in my little book when I knew I was going through Paris and I called him and he\nasked me \u2014 and he was home! And he asked me where I was and I told him I was at the train\nstation. And I told him what the circumstances were \u2014 that were two MPs guarding me \u2014 but\nat the time they were looking at magazines and French postcards in the train station. And he\nsaid, \u201cI know that train station.\u201d He said, \u201cI'll be over there. You stay in the phone booth\nand pretend that you\u2019re talking to me. I\u2019Il be over there in about ten minutes and when you\nsee me in the doorway, you come out of the telephone booth and come right to where I am\nand we\u2019 ll get in my car and I\u2019Il take you home \u2014 to my, to my home.\u201d And that\u2019s what\nhappened. I don\u2019t think anything happened to the MPs, because they were all so happy to get\nrid of me. I\u2019m sure that when he went back, when they went back to Onzbock (ph), and told\nthe colonel what had happened, he probably felt that it would be fine if I was arrested for\nbeing AWOL, or whatever. But, what actually happened was that Jacques took me to his\nhome. And his home happened to be a floor through apartments, apartment in the\nTrockadeero (ph) Section of Paris. And you could see the Eiffel Tower from their home,\ntheir apartment. And it was the type of apartment that the elevator opened up into their, well\nas long as it\u2019s French I\u2019d better say foyer, but it opened up into their foyer. And I, his\ngrandmother lived with them, and I received her, I was given her suite of rooms while I was\nthere, which consisted of a sitting room, a bedroom and a bathroom. And I was served\nbreakfast in bed. In fact, I had to wait until the maid got out, left the room so I could get out\nof bed and put the tray on the dresser so I could have breakfast comfortably. I found out what\nthe signet ring was: their dining room \u2014 they had tapestries all over the, all over the\napartment and they were these tapestries that depicted all the wars that the Bourbons (ph)\nhad fought in from whenever to wherever. And he was the descendant of the kings and it\ndidn\u2019t mean anything to him except that he had this signet ring that he wore. And it was also\nin needlepoint on the back of all the chairs in the dining room. And Jacques had a sister who\nshowed me around Paris. We went to the Louvre \u2014 we did all the typical tourist things and I\nwas there for about four days. I was very anxious \u2014 I was a little afraid that something might\nhappen and I did leave after, I think it was four or five days. But I\u2019d been to the Leedo (ph)\nand the Moulon (ph) Rouge and the Casino de Paris and to the Napoleon\u2019s tomb and the\nfamous cemetery \u2014 well, whatever. I'll think of it. And I got to Camp Philip Morris. I could\nhave stayed in Paris for a month! When I reported there, they said, \u201cWell, you\u2019 Il go out on\nthe next available ship, boat.\u201d Washtub is what it was. It was a victory ship. I crossed in the\nAmsterdam, the SS something Amsterdam which was a huge luxury vessel. Took us four\nand a half days to cross \u2014 took me ten days to get back, and it was during that time and I was\nin a stateroom with other officers, and that\u2019s when all my things were stolen. With the\nexception of that one bottle of perfume and the fifth of Three Feathers. That was a very\npopular brand of bourbon during the war that I later had with my dad. Then, I came home\nand I had a very difficult time. I was being separated from the service at Jefferson Barracks\nand I sort of broached on this subject when we were talking before, but the first person I saw\nwas a friend of mine that I grew up with in St. Joe and he was playing cards in the officers\u2019\nrecreation room. And I ran up to him and I said, \u201cPaul!\u201d You know, I was so happy to be\nhome! I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be in St. Joe! They\u2019re shipping me out tomorrow! Is there\nanything you want me to tell your folks \u2014 I'll call them!\u201d And he said, \u201cEh, I see them every\nweekend.\u201d He had spent the entire war in Jefferson Barracks. I guess he did something.\nSomething that was necessary to the war effort. But it hit me, really, how . Four\nyears I\u2019ve been in this man\u2019s army. Finally got home. I\u2019d been home before on furloughs and\non leaves during the time that I was in the States. My army career was sort of evenly divided.\nI, I spent two years in the States and two years in Europe. Then I was ordered to report to the\nparade grounds at Jefferson Barracks before being separated from the service. And I was\nwearing my captain, my captain\u2019s bars and I thought oh-oh, my AWOL caught up with me.\nHere it comes, the saber, you know, cutting all these things off. But instead, that\u2019s when I\nwas given the army, the commendation medal, that beautiful commendation medal, because\nin my records it had this letter from Major General Robertson which entitled me to the --\nand the orders in my file.",
        "Q: But no mention of the AWOL...",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: ... and the threat of the court-martial.",
        "A: Nothing, nothing, nothing. Nothing.",
        "Q: So what, what was it like then, to be a civilian, suddenly. You mentioned it was hard.",
        "A: Very difficult. Very difficult. I, in the army you always wait for someone to tell you what to\ndo. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a private and the corporal tells you to pick up cigarette\nbutts or clean the latrine, or your platoon leader, your captain tells you to shape up these men\n\u2014 go on bivouac, maneuvers. There\u2019s always someone above you to tell you what to do and I\nwas waiting for someone to tell me what to do. I had this brother and sister living out in\nColorado and I went to visit them. And I spent almost the entire summer there \u2014 went to the\nmountains, breathing some nice fresh air and just relaxing. And slowly, the time was coming\nto go, when I would have to go back to school \u2014 if I wanted to finish school. And I was really\nvery reluctant to go and I think that this same thing followed me, this same feeling followed\nme until I gave up practice until I gave up my practice and left St. Joseph to seek my career \u2014\nanother career in the theater. I had the typical midlife crisis. I did go back to school because I\nthought let me finish one thing that I started. Let me at least do that. But I was very unhappy\nwhen I went back. Many men, many of the students in my class were much younger. They\nhad just come out of high school or you know, they\u2019d gotten a B.A. in college and had gone\non to podiatry school. And quite a few were married and I was kind of an old man at 26. And\nan angry old man because the world had passed me by. And I\u2019d lost four years. I really\nhadn\u2019t. It was the most formative four years that I could have had to prepare me for what\ncame later and that was just \u2014 that was life. I went back to school and I came back to St.\nJoseph to practice. My first year back at school, though, was the hardest and I knew that I\nwould need help. And the Veterans Administration had a counseling service at the\nUniversity of Chicago and I was able to go there, on Saturdays, every week for about six\nweeks. And I had a very intense and intensive meeting with a very, very good psychologist,\nanalyst, therapist, counselor that finally culminated in taking various tests. And I did. I took,\nbut I tried, I tried as objective as I could with these tests and they grade you, you know, on\nthe curve. Like, say in law, maybe four people will be better than you are if you follow that\nfield but 95 won\u2019t be as good as you. And, as I said, I tried to be as objective as I could in\ntaking the tests but the results were that I would probably be best in personnel management,\nlaw and then medicine. Medicine, of course, I\u2019d had two years of pre-med prior to going into\npodiatry school. So, I\u2019m sure that that showed up in the exams. And I came back and I\npracticed and I had a very lucrative practice for 14 years and then I had the typical midlife\ncrisis. And I see, gee, and I kept thinking about life back in the DP camps and how tenuous it\nis and how it just could hang by a thin thread. And you\u2019re here today and tomorrow the\nwhole thing could be wiped out. So live each day and, that\u2019s not knew with me, of course.\nBut live it the way you want to live it. And live it the way it'll give you the most pleasure,\nnot the most remuneration. But just that\u20191l make you a good man and I picked the most\ndifficult profession in the world. And I left St. Joe and joined a melodrama troupe in\nColorado, on the western slope. They called it the Kerosene (ph) Circuit. And I played\nAspen, Glenwood Springs, Leadville, Durango, Steamboat Springs \u2014 did it an entire\nsummer. And I was 42 years old then.",
        "Q: As an actor?",
        "A: As an actor in a melodrama. And I was fat and bald at that time, too. But at the end of the\nseason I went to New York and David Merrick, who was a very well-known producer at the\ntime, wasn\u2019t waiting for me. There was no red carpet, and I knew that if I wanted to do\ntheater, I\u2019d have to study and, at least the glossary of the theater. Even the terms: stage right,\nstage left, although in civic theater, I did quite a bit of it. Except we say now, \u201cYou go on\nthat side of the stage,\u201d when you\u2019re saying it and \u201cyou go on the other side of the stage.\u201d But,\nnevertheless, I did well. I started doing the soaps and I started doing, I did a couple of\nBroadway shows. I did several off-Broadway shows. I toured in industrials, I did\ncommercials and I met my dear, dear lovely wife. She was a gift.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019d like to ask you, if I could, if, you\u2019 ve mentioned that your father was an Orthodox\nJew, and that he was observant, and that your parents both came to this country from a small\ntown...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But that you as a young man were interested in being an American, in being Americanized.\nWhen you came back from your tour in Europe, and having had the experiences that you did,\nand seeing what had happened to the Jewish people in Europe and what could have\nhappened to your, to you, had you been there \u2014 how did that affect your relationship with\nyour parents and your family? Did it? And your sense of yourself as a Jew? Did those things\nchange gradually or at all? After your experience with, in the DP camps?",
        "A: Well, a lot of things entered into it. Yes they did. To begin with, I\u2019Il just give you a short\nhistory of my father. My father came over in the great wave of immigration, 1906. He was\nmarried, already, and had a child \u2014 my oldest brother, who will be 87 in November, next\nmonth. And he started peddling. It\u2019s the typical American story of the Jews who came over\nand put a pack on their back which he did, and sold needles and notions and dry goods \u2014\nwhatever he could carry \u2014 until he made enough money to buy a horse so that he could carry\nmore things over into Kansas from St. Joseph, Missouri. It\u2019s on the border between the, right\non the border between Kansas and Missouri. Made enough money then to buy a wagon so he\ncould carry more goods. Then made enough money to bring Mother over and my brother and\nhis sister. \u2019'm giving you all this background because of what has happened. When he had\nhis family over, when he had Mother, he didn\u2019t want to go peddling anymore. He wanted to\nestablish, to take root somewhere \u2014 in St. Joe. So he opened up a feed store. After all, there\nwere no, there were very few cars. I once read what, what really has happened in my lifetime\nin the way of automobiles and radio and television and airplanes and all the computers. This\nhas all happened, gee, in this century \u2014 not even the entire century, beginning, I remember\nlistening to the radio on the little battery. What\u2019d they call \u2014 my brother made it. We would\nlisten, we had earphones and I\u2019d listen on one and he\u2019d listen on the other. But then, we had\nthe last, after the feed store and when there weren\u2019t too many more horses, Dad opened up a\ngrocery store. In 1919, and to this day, my brother-in-law has that store. He and my oldest\nsister took over the store when I came home from, when my brother-in-law came home from\nthe army. Incidentally, my brother-in-law and I were both in the same unit, until we were\nseparated and I went into all this other work and he stayed with the 95\" Infantry Division.\nAnd every once in a while, if he has two beers, he\u2019 II let you know how he took Metts (ph) \u2014\nand, and he did. Wonderful, wonderful man but I just lost my sister a few months before my\nwife died. These letters that she saved...",
        "Q: Your sister...",
        "A: Now. When I came home, there were a number of things that happened. Oh, but I grew up in\na very Orthodox family but I was younger. Now my brother, after his Bar-Mitzvah, he did\nthe tfillin (ph), I guess until he got, until after he got married and I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t. I went to\nHebrew school and I studied. I can read Hebrew today. I don\u2019t know everything \u2014 I can\u2019t\ninterpret it, but I can read it. And I was bar-mitzvahed, but that was it. I was too busy,\nafterwards. I, I followed two sisters who were National Honor Society, and Quill and Scroll\nand all the honors in school and when they heard my name, they said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re Lil\u2019s\nbrother and you\u2019re Bess\u2019s brother.\u201d There\u2019s the two sisters between my oldest brother and\nmyself. \u201cOh!\u201d And they expected me to do everything that they did. And I, during the\nDepression I worked \u2014 worked at the drugstore. And I was just busy \u2014 busy keeping myself\ngoing. It was rather selfish, I presume, but it was difficult being Jewish in a small town. Not\nas difficult as it is now. We only have about 200 souls in St. Joseph. Before the war, there\nwere around 4500. We didn\u2019t become assimilated. We had our own synagogue, of course.\nWe had our own fraternity, sorority \u2014 we had our own groups that we socialized with. Little\nby little, course we couldn\u2019t go to the St. Joseph Country Club, which is a joke that I had on\nthem much later on when I received Alumnus of the Year from my college and the dinner\nwas held at the St. Joseph Country Club. There were many times when I refused to go there\n\u2014 they couldn\u2019t allow Jews as members, they certainly didn\u2019t want us there when we were\nreceiving any kind of honors. It\u2019s all changed now, however. But I wasn\u2019t as, I really wasn\u2019t\nas observant as my dad. I went to the synagogue on holidays with him and when my mother\npassed away I said Koddish (ph) when I could, as many times as I could. Also, I came home,\nthere were times that I received, there was a time when I received a letter from home saying\nthat mother was recuperating before I received a letter saying what was wrong. Mother\u2019d\nhad, had gone to Mayo Clinic for a mastectomy in 19, 1945. And she\u2019d lived to 1954 when it\nhad metastasized. So all this took place. You asked me if I was as observant a Jew. I, I\nthought God had forsaken my people. I really did. I was very angry with Him. How could\nyou let this happen? So I was going to get even. I Just wouldn\u2019t do anything that He wanted\nme to do. What were the prayers? So, they were hollow. Why would He listen to mine when\nHe didn\u2019t listen to their cries. I heard them. I don\u2019t think I really know to this day and that\nwas reinforced because He took my wife away. He, she, the spirit, I don\u2019t know. But I do\nknow this. Though it didn\u2019t happen to me, those who did believe, and today, those who\nbelieve with all their heart and those who believe the way my dad did, had a much easier\ntime of it. For some reason.",
        "Q: You spent the last 50 years angry? About what?",
        "A: I never spoke about it \u2014 I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve probably talked more now in these few hours than I\nhave my whole lifetime, since then. Oh, there was a time in Los Angeles, when I was living\nthere, that one of the high school teachers was rewriting history. And he said that this really\ndidn\u2019t happen. He was teaching his classes that all these emaciated bodies were coming from\nCentral Casting. And, course we hear these stories over and over again. And my optometrist,\nat the time, was a survivor \u2014 an emigre, and he was telling me about this. And I told him my\ninvolvement in the DP camps and he asked me if I would work. They were going to set up a\nround robin with survivors and liberators, such as myself, in a church, actually. And it was, I\nthink it was on Wilshire Boulevard, on Pico Boulevard. There was a church that had\nclassrooms and we were going to have a round robin about, well I have all the papers \u2014 we\nwere going to take turns and tell our story over and over and over again. And the classrooms\nthat were bussed in would be in this class and then they would do \u2014 they would go, each one\nof them, in time, would hear the story of about six of us. And incidentally, the Fonz was one\nof them \u2014 Henry Winkler. I think that that was the main attraction for a lot of these kids that\ncame in because, you know, Happy Days was running on the crest of television waves. And I\ngot involved, then, and that\u2019s, that was the change of name. I think you, I was using Joe\nFrederick at the time because when I went into the theater, you couldn\u2019t have a very ethnic-\nsounding name if you wanted to work. In fact, the first man that interviewed me for a job\nsaid that he looked at his calendar and when he saw Joe Friedman, he said, he thought to\nhimself, he said, \u201cEh, another accountant? Another insurance salesman? I have plenty of\ninsurance and I have my own accountant. I don\u2019t need anybody like that.\u201d And he told me\nthis when I went in. He was the director of Love of Life and Secret Storm \u2014 these were soaps\nthat were going on at that time, in New York. And I wanted to work. He says, \u201cYou'll never\nwork under the name of Joe Friedman.\u201d Well, I wanted to keep the same initials. And also, a\nstrange thing happened before I left St. Joe. One of my patients called me Frederick, by\naccident. She called me Dr. Frederick and I thought, gee, what a nice sounding name and it\u2019s\nthe same initial. But I didn\u2019t have to worry about that because there was a dancer in the\nEquity, one of the actors\u2019 union, who was Joe Friedman, and it didn\u2019t matter to him \u2014 he was\na dancer. And so I couldn\u2019t use my name, anyway. \u201cCause you can\u2019t use the same name in\nthe union. Excuse me. So it became Joe Frederick. And that\u2019s how it was when I did this\nround robin. And as a result of that, we were honored at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple in\nLos Angeles when they were, as liberators \u2014 there were several and there all pictures here,\nand I was given a certificate by Vice-President Mondale. And I\u2019m very proud of that. The\nonly other time, in Los Angeles that I spoke of it and, again, I keep referring to the pictures\nthat I have and I left 1t with the museum \u2014 the Ludz (ph) survivors have a very strong club in\nLos Angeles. A very affluent club and they do wonderful work with the survivors. And they\ncalled the Federation in Los Angeles and asked for entertainers for a fundraiser that they\nwere going to have and I was sent to go to this Beverly Hills mansion and entertain. I have a\nlittle act that I do \u2014 I was in Fiddler on the Roof for three years \u2014 I did close to 3,000\nperformances. I was in Las Vegas for four months with it. So I sing, and I, and I do Al\nJolson. I used to go down on my knee, but then when I couldn\u2019t get up one time, I stopped\nthat. At any rate, this Shobby Shoptie (ph) who\u2019s a terrorist from, he\u2019s one of the leading\nexponents of, an Israeli on terrorism. He was the main speaker and I was the entertainment.\nAnd I felt because of the occasion, and because they were all Ludz (ph) people from the,\nfrom the ghetto, that I would tell them a little bit about my experience. And I started talking\nand a lady came up and she threw her arms around me and she said, \u201cYou saved my life. I\nknow who you are. I was in your camp.\u201d That\u2019s what happened. We both had a good cry.\nShe was in my camp. She was on a truck from Koburg (ph) going down to, it was the Funk\nCasairn (ph) \u2014 she told me.",
        "Q: Shall we take a break? We\u2019ll pick it up.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Here we have a picture of members of the Palestinian Brigade, who came into my camp,\naround the end of June. They had a list of members of the Palestinian Brigade who fought in\nNorth Africa and ostensibly they wanted to see if there were still relatives of members of the\nBrigade that were alive and living in the Displaced Person Camps and they had legitimate\norders from Third Army Headquarters at Bogtoles (ph) to come into the camps and when\nthey came into mine, I was very happy to see them. And, underneath it all, they were looking\nfor the possibility of the sympathies of the American Jewish officers who might help out\ninforming the links between various camps for Jewish DPs, who were coming out of the\nRussian Occupied Zone of Germany into the American Occupied Zone for a number of\nreasons that we\u2019ve already talked about. So that they could go down to Italy and get on ships\nfor Israel. This is an aerial view of Koburg (ph). Now Koburg (ph) was a tremendous\nGerman army camp. As you can see, all the barracks were built out of brick to last forever.\nUnlike our camps, we built out camps out of wood and plaster, and tore them down right\nafter the war. But Germany had theirs to go on forever. Fortunately, we had these because\nwe knew that we were going to house the displaced persons in these camps after the war\nended. So they did serve a great purpose for us. This is a wonderful Unrah (ph) team that\nwere immeasurable help in Koburg (ph) for me and they\u2019re sort of a polygog of nationalities.\nThe head of the Unrah (ph) team on the extreme left, the man, the balding man, was royalty.\nHe was related to the royals of Belgium. And the one kneeling in front of him was White\nRussian. And she was married to an official of Macy\u2019s in New York and felt that during the\ntime that they escaped from Russia, people helped her family and this was the only way that\nshe could pay back in kind and she joined this Unrah (ph) team \u2014 spoke excellent Russian. In\nfact, she spoke about five different languages. The other members \u2014 there were two doctors,\ntwo nutritionists, a nutritionist for the entire camp, a nutritionist for the hospital, a nurse and\nchauffeurs. And they worked day and night, right along with us, and God bless them. This is\na typical truck that, carrying the displaced persons from Koburg (ph) to Lichtenfelds (ph)\nwhich 1s a railhead, and, as you know, it was a happy time for them until they later learned\nwhat their fate held in store after they got to Russia or to Poland. But nevertheless, they\ndecorated the trucks with leaves and trees and branches and also with pictures of their\nleaders. I don\u2019t know where those pictures came from \u2014 they just appeared out of nowhere\nand were on the trucks. And we saw to it that they plenty of food and clothing and sent\nfamilies back together, quite unlike other trucks that carried out people to crematoria. This is\na photo of Russians and American soldiers, at, at a checkpoint. They were there to see that\nthings were carried out according to our own United States directives and the Russian\ndirectives. At first, they were very, rather shy, the Russians, and not as talkative as our\nAmerican officers, but later on there was quite a symbiotic relationship that developed\nbetween the two. We wanted things from them and they wanted things from us. And\nbetween the two forces we got quite a bit done. Well, that happens to be a picture of me, in\nmy Mercedes. That was a 1936 Mercedes convertible, I think they called it a cabrolay (ph).\nAnd I got it quite legitimately \u2014 we paid for it \u2014 the Germans couldn\u2019t use a lot of their\nvehicles because they couldn\u2019t get gasoline for it. In order for me to be able to draw gasoline\nand to have it serviced at the motor pool, I had to have it painted OD, and had to put the\narmy emblem on it, a white star on it, and I put some fictitious ordinance number on the\nhood of the car. So there you have it, I\u2019m, if the authorities find out at this late date, I'll\nprobably have to go to jail. This obviously is a wedding that was held in Bamburg (ph). I\nwas in Koburg (ph) at the time, and they invited me to come up to Bamburg (ph), because\nthey were people that I had worked with when I was in the camp at Bamburg (ph). The\ngroom is Sergeant Richard Lane and the bride, her name 1s Hettie. I don\u2019t know her last\nname but she was Estonian and she had been a dental assistant and very bright. Her matron\nof honor was also from the, from one of the Baltic countries. And then, I\u2019m, you can see part\nof my head behind her. We were all in the wedding party and it was nice. It was nice to\nknow that life could go on and that some of the institutions that we revered throughout life\ncould take place under these most extreme circumstances. As a footnote to this, many, many\nyears later, I visited Hettie and Bob in San Francisco. They had both gone back to college\nand were very, very happy. A happily married couple. This was an entertainment hall that we\nhad in camp. They had their own musicians. They did requisition musical instruments and I\nhave a whole roster here of what they requisitioned: guitars and violins, accordions \u2014 they all\nplayed accordions and the Bolla Lika (ph). I really thought that before it was all over with,\nI'd be an expert at doing the, the Kuzotzka (ph) or the polka. One of the other, or both. But, I\nenjoyed going to these concerts and they enjoyed having us there because they realized that\nwe were interested in the cultural aspect of their life as well as the necessities, the other\nnecessities of life such as eating, clothing and a roof over their heads. This was a bonus for\nthem. Here I am again. Periodically, of course, I inspected the camp and would see to it that\nthey had enough in the warehouses. We were always, always after enough wood so that we\ncould heat the cauldrons that made the soup which was the mainstay of all the DPs in the\ncamps. We would cut down entire forests in order to get enough wood and here\u2019s an\nexample of how we would stockpile it and store it and just, it was as valuable as gold to us.\nAs we spoke of this before, the camp was run the same way an entire city would be run. And\nthis is the hospital of the camp. Many of the doctors, I should say that the majority of the\ndoctors, were Polish although they, we would, they would answer to American medical,\nmembers in the medical corps of the American army. And they received wonderful\ntreatment. Whatever they requisitioned for the hospitals we were able to get. We would\neither get it from our own medical supply or we would get it from the German medical\nsupplies but whatever had to be done was done. Well this is a Polish doctor. He was a very\nfine man. I had occasion to talk him on a few, a few times that I went over to the hospital and\nof course many of the times when he came into my office to request medical supplies. But he\nwas dedicated and very happy to be able to be a surgeon, to be a doctor again, which he\ncouldn\u2019t do under the German thumb.",
        "Q: Do you recall his name?",
        "A: No I don\u2019t. No, I don\u2019t. I probably have it somewhere, on a requisition. I\u2019d have to go\nthrough the papers. I\u2019m certain that there\u2019s a name on the requisitions. I have, I have a whole\nlist of all the Polish personnel and also I have the emblem that they wore on their jackets that\nI\u2019m gong to give to the museum. This is an interesting story. This gentleman had been a\ncollaborationist. Not in the sense that he collaborated with the Germans, although he might\nhave, but we do know that whatever organization took over the various DP camps, if he had\nbeen a member of the camp, he was able to ingratiate himself into the hierarchy of the camp\nto the extent where he was able to get supplies and whatever the camps needed. But he\nwould also service himself by doing this. He probably worked the black market in cigarettes,\nin candy, in clothing, in liquor and the DPs knew about him. When I became commander of\nthe camp in Koburg (ph), he started this same thing with me. And I was quite ignorant of\nwhat had gone before, and very innocent and he brought a beautiful dagger that he gave to\nme that he had sort of confiscated, I guess, himself and had belonged at one time to the\nForestmeister of the Black Forest, near TreeAir (ph), Germany. I still have that dagger but\nthis gentleman is no longer with us because the night of the day that he gave me this\nsouvenir, he was murdered by other members of the camp.\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Q: Right.",

        "A: Good afternoon.",
        "A: Well, that covers quite a bit of territory. I was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, on March the\ntenth in 1920 and I was the fourth of five children and eventually my father and mother took\nin a cousin who was orphaned. So there were three boys and three girls in the family. I went\nto school locally in St. Joseph, Missouri, and of course grew up during the Depression. That\ncovered quite a long era. We all worked. It was the usual paper route, selling magazines,\neventually working in the drugstore and working my way through school as much as I could.\nFortunately, we had a junior college in St. Joseph and I was able to go there for my first two\nyears and get an Associate Arts degree. But after that, Iran out of money, so I was in search\nof jobs that would pay more. With that in mind, I went out to Colorado, where I had an older\nbrother and his family, and I worked in an amusement park in Colorado \u2014 Lakeside\nAmusement Park. It was a very good job for the summer because a lot of college kids\nworked there as they did in ranches, dude ranches, in Colorado. So it was very pleasant work\nbut by the end of the summer I still didn\u2019t have enough money to go back to school. So I\nwent back home \u2014 I was homesick and my folks wanted me to come back. I went back\naround Thanksgiving of 1939. And made enough money to enter my first year of college\u2014\nof podiatry school. I\u2019m almost afraid to go down that alley because it was my first\nprofession. I went there because Dad wanted me to be a doctor. I didn\u2019t want to be a doctor\nbut this was the next best thing. In fact, it was difficult at that time, even to get into medical\nschool. There were Jewish quotas. But I did go to Chicago and I talked to the registrar and\nwhen I came home during the summer of \u201939, to make a decision as to what I wanted to do,\nI decided to go to podiatry school. Well, that was in the fall of \u201941, and we know what\nhappened on December the seventh. During the Christmas holidays, although they asked us\nto remain in school as much as we could, everybody was gung ho. We wanted to get into the\narmy and fight the Japanese because of this atrocity that they had inflicted upon us at Pearl\nHarbor. Well, I tried to get into the Navy but, at that time, they were very strict and I\ncouldn\u2019t get in on account of my eyes, plus the fact that they did encourage us to stay in\nschool \u2014 at least to finish that year, which I did. I went back to school, but during the week of\nfinals, I got the orders to come report to my selective draft board and fill a quota and I did. I\ncame home and went into the army. I went into basic training to , Texas, with\nthe 95\" Infantry Division. I had had ROTC in high school at that time. ROTC was very good\nbecause we were able to wear uniforms and it would save on our clothing. Although they tell\nyou never to volunteer for anything in the Army, when they asked if anyone had had any\nclose order drill, my hand went up and I was immediately put in charge of a platoon. At the\nend of the first month, fortunately, I made PFC. The second month, I made buck sergeant,\nI\u2019m sorry, corporal, then buck sergeant, that\u2019s three stripes, then staff sergeant. Then I was\nready to go to OCS. I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. I had a first sergeant, was\nregular army, very anti-semitic, and when I put in my papers for OCS, he didn\u2019t send them\ninto headquarters, so I didn\u2019t get to go.",
        "A: Yes, yes, and the reason he didn\u2019t put the papers in, although he\u2019d called me, in all the\npromotions that I got, I found out that he kept saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want a kike (ph) on my staff\u2019.\nThe other officers would override him and I was promoted from time to time, through the\nranks. The reason he didn\u2019t send me to OCS was he was going out to the 97\" Infantry\nDivision and he wanted me to go along with him, which was quite a strange thing, until you\nthink of the fact that I did all his work. And also, one of the officers in my company said that\nI was going through too fast and that OCS 1s very difficult. They were flunking out at least\nhalf of them and it would do me good to have a little more training, a little more of a sense of\narmy, and what\u2019s expected of me, and the extra six months or so that I\u2019d have to spend\nwould be to my advantage. And it was true. I did go to OCS and it was very difficult. I think\naround 520 of us matriculated and there were maybe 200, 280 or 85 that finally graduated\nand got their bars. Then we were sent to different camps. I finally ended up at a headquarters\ncompany at Camp Blanding, Florida, doing various jobs. And then went overseas.",
        "A: Went overseas during the winter of \u201842-43. We were stationed in Preston, Lancashire, and\nwe crossed the channel on a Polish ship called the Sobiesky (ph) and when we got midway\nthrough the channel, there was a lot of submarine and anti-aircraft activity by the Germans,\nso we had to back to Southampton. I later read, after the war, that the ship that left\nSouthampton the same time we did was torpedoed.",
        "A: It was. .. the dates are going to be a little difficult for me.",
        "A: Oh, it was during Christmas, it was during Christmas. It was the same night that Glenn\nMiller disappeared over the channel. Which later came into a lot of things that I did after the\nwar, or a lot of things that I thought about as being \u2014 if something took off, took of\nparamount importance to me, I would think of the time that I crossed the channel, and how\nlucky that I was. When they said that, \u201cyou get on this ship, or you get on this ship, how\nmany are in your complement\u201d, I said, \u201cSix officers and 96 men\u2019. \u201cOkay, you get on this\none, you get on that one.\u201d We were lucky enough to get on the Sobiesky (ph) that turned\nback. The other one was torpedoed, with a loss of about 90% of the personnel. I didn\u2019t know\nthis until after the war ended, when they were printing these statistics. At any rate, we\nlanded. We had to go over the side of the ship with a rope ladder and landed in landing craft\nand went into LeHarve(ph). Now this was after the invasion, and although we weren\u2019t being\nshot at, it was still very difficult and very cold wading through the water until we get onto\ndry land. Once, and I\u2019m going very fast because there\u2019s quite a bit to cover, once we got into\nFrance, we started moving very rapidly. In fact, I know there were a lot of articles written\nabout Patton streaking across France and into Germany and across the Rhine, across the\nRaymoggan (ph) bridge head, which we crossed, and into Tree Air (ph). Then we went to,\nwe were in the battle of Baston, we were in Belgium, Luxembourg, and then into Germany.",
        "A: From the beginning of winter, of \u201944, 45.",
        "A: In winter of *45.",
        "A: \"44,45.",
        "A: Around that time. I once read where someone was telling an account of, 1t might not have\nbeen his war stories, it was something and what stuck in my mind was, he said \u201cMy memory\nhas a lot of holes in it.\u201d So I\u2019m going to paraphrase what he said, or copy what he said, and\ntell you that my memory, after 50 years of not going back to all this, until I was given an\nopportunity to give this oral history, my memory is going to have a lot of holes in it. So there\nwill be a time period that will have quite a spread. Now with the Third Army, i 1\nhope -- it would have been nice if it all happened that quickly to bring me to this point, but I\nknow that this is the major thrust of the interview.",
        "A: We\u2019re in April. Our troops uncovered the concentration camp at Ordruff (ph). Now Ordruff\n(ph) was one of the satellite camps at Bookenblow (ph) near Gotha (ph) and you can\u2019t get\nthe full measure or the full thrust of what happens to you when you walk into a place like\nthis and see bodies, emaciated bodies, stacked one on top of the other.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Vividly, vividly, it was daylight. Those who were left, there were still bodies burning in\nthe ovens, and we could still smell it. In fact, after the war was over when my mother would\nfix a chicken and try to burn off the little feathers that were left, I had to get out of the house.\nI couldn\u2019t smell that odor, that odor that gets into your nostrils, and never leaves. I\u2019ve never\nbought a pair of striped pajamas in my life, because that\u2019s what they were wearing \u2014 these\nstriped pajamas, and I know what happened. I kept salivating. You know there\u2019s, before you\nvomit, something happens to the salivary glands and it\u2019s kind of a, well if you\u2019ve ever done\nit, if you\u2019ve ever had it, you know that it just, before you give it all up, there\u2019s, you know that\nyou're going to throw up. And that\u2019s rather indelicate, but this is what happens. Some of the\ndead were in very grotesque positions, leaning against a tree with their legs covered, and\ndead. Just all sorts of, maybe some in fetal positions, lying in the camp. Those who were still\nalive, in the barracks, if you could call it a barracks, they were sort of lean-tos with straw,\nwere so weak that if the one next to him was dead, he didn\u2019t have the strength to push him\noff so that he could at least have maybe the small luxury of being able to turn around on this\npallet that had been his bed for many years. We did whatever we could \u2014 we did in the way\nof food, whatever we could give them, whatever help we could give them, but we were still\nmoving on. I was still with the combat troop. Actually, I had a litter bearer platoon, and my\nmen were the ones who saw the first casualties, the first line of casualties, and would carry\nthem back to the evac hospitals that were in the rear of the combat line. We did whatever we\ncould to make them comfortable. I heard that, after we left, there was such pandemonium,\nand I think that this continued until the end of the war, there was never, nothing ever ran\nsmoothly, it seems. As much as we tried, there was always some trouble brewing somewhere\nand something to be taken care of, that needed immediate attention. But I understand that the\nBurgermeister (ph) of Ordruff (ph) was murdered by the inmates who were left and his body\nwas dismembered and he was strung up on a tree in the center of town, the civic center. I\nthink this is true.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Briefly, briefly. \u201cCause we\u2019d both cry. There wasn\u2019t too much, we\u2019d start a conversation and\nthey would love us and kiss us and we would hug them and whatever we had we would give\nthem. Then there was the language barrier. Some spoke Russian, some spoke Polish, some\nUkrainian, Lithuanian, Estonians, Latvian. They came from the Balkan countries as well,\nRomania, Hungary. There was a whole cacophony of voices and languages but we knew one\nthing. They all had one thing in common \u2014 that they were free. And I think, I think, wanted\nto get revenge. I probably would have behaved in the same way, to avenge six years, some of\nthem, of torture, of having their families taken away from them. And murdered in such a\nmanner, in such a diabolical manner, that we\u2019ve all learned about since then. I didn\u2019t know\nall this at that time. I was aware...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I knew, I knew, I knew that they were slave laborers. I knew that the majority of them\nwere Jews.",
        "A: Well, in my fractured Yiddish, and they told me, and I was able to understand a little bit of\nGerman. But I just sensed that most of them were, because by then, what had been written in\nthe Stars and Stripes, which was the army newspaper in Germany, or in Europe, we started\nhearing about these atrocities. But I didn\u2019t have any visual evidence of it until I went into the\nconcentration camp. I didn\u2019t know how they got there, well, I knew how they got there, they\nwere forced there, but I didn\u2019t know until later on when I read how they were put in vans,\nand put on trains and in boxcars and the methodical way that they were loaded into boxcars\nwith the elderly going in first, pushed in. And then the younger ones and then the younger\nchildren and then perhaps, from six on down, they were just picked up by their legs and\nthrown into the boxcar to land on top of whoever was there and then the boxcar was sealed.\nIf they had to defecate, or urinate, they had to do it in place, in the boxcars. The boxcars\ncame into play, when the vans that they used to gas \u2014 you know they would use vans and\nthey would hook a pipe onto the exhaust and put the pipe into the van and by the time they\ngot to Treblinka, or Auschwitz. . . I didn\u2019t know all this until much later. When I saw them,\nwell, they were prisoners who hadn\u2019t been fed who worked for the German war machine\nand given, not even, minimal rations. Not even just something to keep them going so they\ncould keep the war machine going, and when they couldn\u2019t any longer do that, it was off to\nthe ovens. That was all I knew then.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t recall seeing any women then.",
        "A: No. No. By then, by the time we got there, the guards had disappeared. They tried to kill as\nmany as they could before they left. A lot of what went on there, we were told as we went\non, as we left, and talked to each other about what had been happening there, and were given\nall sorts of lectures, again, on what had been happening in these camps. I didn\u2019t see firsthand\nwhere they worked \u2014 they weren\u2019t working anymore. They sort of spread out over the\ncountryside because, as we progressed, as the army progressed, we would see them.",
        "A: Walking \u2014 in the striped pajamas, foraging for food, perhaps killing justifiably, we thought.",
        "A: Perhaps the larger part of two days. Maybe a day and then left on the second day. But during\nthat time, during that time, something must have started germinating in my mind. I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but think, of course, there but for the grace of God, go I. I and my antecedents were all\nfrom Russia, and I could very well have been one of the inmates of the concentration camp,\nhad I lived in that surrounding, in Russia. The entire village, I later learned, the entire village\nthat my parents and grandparents lived in and aunts and uncles whom I\u2019d never met and\ncousins \u2014 they were entirely wiped out. I later learned that they were all herded into a barn\nand the barn was set on fire and as they tried to escape, they were machine-gunned. This 1s in\n1939 when the Germans went into Poland. I didn\u2019t know that that happened. I just know that\nwe stopped getting letters from my grandparents in 1939. We stopped getting mushrooms.\nThey used to send mother \u2014 my grandmother used to send her dried mushrooms and she\nmade delicious mushroom and barley soup. That all stopped of course.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: I knew. I wanted to go into Germany in 1938. I wanted to take a bicycle tour through\nGermany and I had talked to a friend who had been there and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t go. It\u2019s not the\nplace for Jews.\u201d So we knew as early, actually, as 1933, the things that were happening, the\nlaws. I didn\u2019t pay that much attention to it. I was 13 years old then and the prom was much\nmore important at the time, I guess.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: At the end of the thirties. An uncle of mine who survived, or who was able to come over,\ncame over. But we didn\u2019t talk about it a lot. And I found that to be true among many first\ngeneration Americans, as I was. We were too busy trying to Americanize our parents. Which\nwas a mistake. What we should have been doing was talking to them and getting this\nbeautiful, beautiful background that they had in Europe. I know later on when I\u2019d take\nMother for a ride in my car and we went out into the country because I came from a small\ntown, in Missouri, and when the wheat was being harvested and the corn, she\u2019d take it in.\nShe\u2019d smell the wheat and she\u2019d say, \u201cOh, this is just like home.\u201d It was always home. And\noddly enough, in the many years that I\u2019d been away from St. Joe and I\u2019d been away to school\nand in the theater, I\u2019ve been away altogether, I guess, close to 50 years, whenever I told my\nwife, whenever I talked about home, she always knew that it meant St. Joseph. It wasn\u2019t\nwhere we were living at the time. That was a house. And we\u2019ve lived all over the world. And\nI guess the army took me all over the world, too. But home, home was always St. Joe, the\nway Russia was always home to Mother and Dad. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t find out more\nabout that. We got busy with making a living, going to school, and finding the American\ndream. I\u2019m digressing.",
        "A: Not a lot. Just enough to keep them alive. It became quite a hot potato after a while, on what\nto do with these people. I do know, and it might have been, it might be a rumor, but I was\ntold that our Air Force, who did almost pinpoint bombing, eventually, was told not to bomb\nany of the German military camps. Or any of the IG Farban (ph) buildings. Now the IG\nFarban was this tremendous cartel that had quite a bit of American money involved in it. The\narmy barracks, we knew that we were going to have to use them for the displaced persons,\nuntil they could be repatriated. Now it wasn\u2019t that difficult to send the western Europeans\nback, who\u2019d been slave laborers, send them back to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy \u2014\nalthough Italy was Allied Germany for a while \u2014 they were also working in the war effort\nand had to be sent home. But we couldn\u2019t do anything with this tremendous, tremendous\nhorde of eastern Europeans until we made contact with the Russians and that took \u201ctil the end\nof the war, and then some. And then problems.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t speak with any of them, but they all stood around as though. . .",
        "A: Yes. On the edge of town, on the edge of town. They acted as though, as they were surprised.\nBut I honestly believe that no matter where the camps were, the people knew. They knew!\nThey smelled it! They smelled the ovens. They smelled the smoke that came out of the\novens. They didn\u2019t think they were baking bread there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Now, they might not have seen. They might not have been all that aware of how, how really\ndespicable the conditions were \u2014 how horrible they were. But I\u2019m sure that they knew what\nwas going on, and didn\u2019t care. Jews! Who cared? Hasn\u2019t that always been the history?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I can\u2019t say that I did. I really didn\u2019t know enough then, and didn\u2019t feel enough. But what I\ndid feel, and I guess that\u2019s what later led me, I\u2019m taking all this in, probably, led me to\nvolunteer to stay over after the war ended. Or to get into the work of repatriating the\ndisplaced persons. I thought if I could, that whatever I could do, that I would try. In fact, it\nbecame a problem to the United States Army before the war ended, because when the camps\nthat were overrun, eventually all of them, knew that they would get better treatment from the\nUnited States Army, and, as we progressed, I would see hundreds, literally hundreds,\nthousands even, Russians walking, displaced persons walking along the street, along the\nhighway that we were driving on to get from one town to another. They had to be put in\ncamps, otherwise we couldn\u2019t feed them, we couldn\u2019t clothe them, we couldn\u2019t control them.",
        "A: I am, actually my platoon was broken up shortly after that. And, \u2018cause the war was winding\ndown.",
        "A: No. No. I still had control of them but they were assigned to various combat troops. At times\nwe were with, I forget the names of the various corps, the 12\" Corps, the 22\" the 15\", and\nfrom time to time, I would see them and sort of oversee them and see that they got their\nrations and see that they got their pay and see that they got their mail. But other than that,\nother than that, I, the work really for me sort of died down a bit, until, until my commanding\nofficer asked me if I thought I would like to get involved in working with the displaced\npersons. And it wasn\u2019t all altruistic, at the time. I thought if I would get involved with that,\nwhen the war ended I wouldn\u2019t be sent to the Pacific. I\u2019m being honest 1n saying that that\nwas a factor, also. But the overriding factor, I believe, was something inside me that just\nwanted to help. You know, I\u2019m beginning to think, and as I hear myself and as we go on\nwith this oral history, I\u2019m going, you\u2019re going to hear I a lot, I guess.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 you really can\u2019t be modest about these things, can you?",
        "A: Pronouns tend to get all knocked all over the place. But I know of no other way I can tell you\nthis. But I really, honestly and truly, wanted to do what I could to help.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know the war was over until three days after it was over. And it\u2019s in my notes here.\nWe were near a camp and there were two German planes that landed near us. A German\nofficer and a blonde came out of one of the planes with a case of champagne. And he\u2019s the\none who told us, the group that I was with, that the war had ended. I think it was a, I think\nthe war ended, what May the 52 This was about May the 8\". I wrote home and I told them\nthat I found out that the war had ended. Now other things happened along the way.

Now I can along on this vein for awhile, if you\nwish...",
        "A: And then we can go back to the camps.",
        "A: But it is germane to what has happened. I received a promotion, first lieutenant, and while I\nwas in Koburg (ph), one of the camps, we were constantly being inspected. There was a\ngroup of officers that came in from Third Army. No one wanted the responsibility of running\none of these camps, because by this time, there were all sorts of letters written to the paper,\nand all sorts of surveys being made on how the camps were run and how the Jews were\nbeing treated. Governor Lame (ph) and I recall reading in the Stars and Stripes that the Jews\nwere being treated worse by the American army and by Unrah, (ph) and so on in the camps,\nthan they were in the concentration camps. Well, this wasn\u2019t true, entirely, but there was\nsome truth in it. They didn\u2019t know whether to put the Jews in with all the other DPs, or,\nbecause the Jews were stateless, they were homeless then. They couldn\u2019t go back home\nbecause their homes had already been taken over by the Poles, the Russians, or whatever and\nthey were happy. They were happy. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.",

It\u2019s a huge blowup on the wall \u2014 that\u2019s the first\nthing that you see. And you see Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton looking at these corpses\nabout 11 days after we were there. I think, I think the date on that photograph is about the\n16\", something like that, and we went in around April the 4\u201d or 5\". Patton, there\u2019s an article\nwritten by his aide-de-camp, and it\u2019s in one of the books that\u2019s in the library here, wrote that\nPatton became so ill when he saw this that he had to around one of the barracks and vomit.\nPatton. April, May, June, July, August, September \u2014 there\u2019s quite an article about Patton and\nthe DPs in the same magazine where Patton went into a camp, which camp was it? It was an\nall-Jewish camp. And he went in and he said, \u201cThe filthy Jews were worse than animals.\nThey defecate on the floors and they urinate in corners and it the Feast of Yom Kippur, the\nFeast of Yom Kippur, and they made a room into a synagogue and there\u2019s a man, a priest\nthey call a rabbi. He had some paper rolled around a pole that\u2019s called the Talmud but we\nknow it\u2019s the Torah. And the rabbi looked like King Henry the Eighth, with a filthy hat and\nfur on it. The prayers were in such gibberish that no one understood what they were \u2014 what\nanyone was saying. The stench of all these filthy bodies was such that when I left, I couldn\u2019t\nenjoy my dinner.\u201d Tough.",

We went through because we overwhelmed them with\npersonnel and material. Not because of Patton\u2019s genius, I don\u2019t think. Am I being a traitor? I\ndon\u2019t know.

He had received orders to send whoever he\ncould to a school that would train us for these camps. Now the school was run by army\nofficers who had already been in a camp and knew some of the problems. I think, I think the\nschool lasted all of ten days, if that long. And I was ready.",

And the first camp that I went to was in Bamburg(ph), Germany. I brought a map,\nincidentally, perhaps later on, we can go through it. And I received the best training that\nanybody could ever have, in this camp. The way the camps were set up, we used, we had\nUnrah (ph) personnel. We had German personnel.",
        "A: Civilian. And army. We had, now understand, in order to run all these places, we had to have\npeople who were knowledgeable about the gasworks, about the waterworks, about the\nelectrical companies \u2014 and who knew these things? Germans. Nazis. If they weren\u2019t\nmembers of the Nazi Party, they didn\u2019t hold these positions, so we had to use them. Course\nPatton was later accused of playing footsie with all of them, but to some extent he had to.\nOne thing leads to another, doesn\u2019t it? They all had to fill out what they called a\nFraggoboggen (ph) \u2014 are you familiar with the questionnaire that the Nazis had to fill out?\nWell, it tells about their history in the Nazi Party and of course all of them said that they\ndidn\u2019t, or many of them had a supplement to it, which I have here, and I\u2019m going to leave\nwith the Archives \u2014 a supplement to the Fraggoboggen (ph) that this one man filled out. \u201cT\nwas never a member of the Nazi Party.\u201d That\u2019s what he said. \u201cI was never involved in any of\nthe atrocities.\u201d They all were. They all were \u2014 if they weren\u2019t actively involved in it, they\nwere guilty because they were there and allowed it to start as far back as 1933 and did\nnothing. Or when they started coming after the Germans who disagreed. And the Catholics\nwho disagreed, after they got through with the Jews and the gypsies and the homosexuals.\nThat\u2019s when people started taking note. Maybe there\u2019s a juggernaut that we can\u2019t stop \u2014 that\nwe\u2019re going to need help. Now I\u2019m in a camp, and the camps were run as cities. They had\ntheir own administration. We had an entire Polish army complement in camp. I have it right\nhere \u2014 the badges that they wore.",
        "A: In Bamburg (ph). And later in Koburg, (ph) also. And the camp \u2014 we were constantly being\ninspected because, we were being inspected by all the, by major generals, and colonels,\nbecause everybody was coming down on them, from President Truman on down.",
        "A: They wanted, they wanted what\u2019s going on in these camps. So they\u2019d come in. Now, at one\ntime, by being on temporary \u2014 this 1s just a little story. By being on temporary duty and away\nfrom my original company, I wasn\u2019t able to draw any rations \u2014 any of my rations from my\ncompany \u2014 like cigarettes. We were able to get liquor, too, incidentally. Heavens knows we\nneeded a little schnapps once in a while. Cigarettes, liquor and candy. And when I tried to\nget it from my company, they said we didn\u2019t draw any rations for you because, PX rations, I\nguess they called it, because you\u2019re not assigned to us. You\u2019re away on temporary duty. And\nwhen I tried to get it from the army headquarters, they said, you\u2019re not on our roster, you\u2019re\nonly here on temporary duty. So on one of the times that, on one of the times that my camp\nwas being inspected, when the officers got through, there were about eight of them, and I\nhave the listing here of all of them. The general just happened to mention, \u201cYou deserve a lot\nof credit for the work that you\u2019ve done here.\u201d And I said, \u201cI deserve a rest.\u201d\u2019 And the rest of\nthe officers \u2014 I guess their chin dropped between their knees because you just don\u2019t talk that\nway, . Very G.I. And he said, \u201cOh, what would you like to do?\u201d And you know,\nI was very young then, and very flip. I said, \u201cI think I'd like to go to the Riviera for ten days\nor so.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, how soon could you be ready?\u201d \u201cHow soon could you get a man here\nto replace me?\u201d He said, \u201cCan you be in Munich at 5:00 or 9:00 in the morning or\nwhatever? We\u2019ll fly you to the Riviera.\u201d \u201cCertainly I can be there.\u201d So before going, we had\na camp barber \u2014 and the reason I\u2019m telling you this 1s because one story begets another story\n\u2014 and he was cutting my hair, I had hair then. He was a Frenchman and I told him, I said,\n\u201cNow I want you to do a good job because I\u2019m going to the Riviera. I\u2019m going to stay at the\nHotel Carlton. I go to Nice and to Monte Carlo while I\u2019m there.\u201d He said, \u201cMy family lives\nin Cannes. I haven\u2019t seen them in eight years \u2014 I haven\u2019t written to them and there\u2019s no way\nthat they could write to me. Would you call on them?\u201d I said, \u201cOf course.\u201d He gave me their\naddress of where they lived. They lived up above Cannes \u2014 Gros(ph)? Well, and one day I\ntook a cab and went up there and I met his family and I invited his sister, a little 16-year-old\nsister to come back to the hotel with me to have dinner. Well, the Hotel Carlton, this is where\nthey have the Cannes Film Festival, as you know, and everything is very, very elegant there.\nThere\u2019s a waiter behind each chair. The little girl was sitting there, I don\u2019t she\u2019s ever, I don\u2019t\nwhat she\u2019s ever had in the way of food, or the way it was served, but I want you to know it\nwas quite elegant. And she brought a little bottle of perfume for me as a gift for letting her\nfamily know that her brother was still alive. That little bottle of perfume is the only thing that\nI have left. When I came back to the states and we staged at Camp Philip Morris \u2014 you know\nthey named the staging camps in France after cigarettes \u2014 I had a musette (ph) full of\nsouvenirs \u2014 perfume, lighters. I had a bottle of, I had a fifth of Three Feathers, which 1s\nbourbon liquor that my dad had given me two years before. He said, he wanted, he said,\n\u201cYasilah, (ph) I want you to give this to your colonel so he won\u2019t send you overseas.\u201d And I\nthought to my, I told my commanding officer, I said, \u201cMy dad wants me to give you this so\nyou won\u2019t send me overseas.\u201d We both had a good laugh. I thought if we landed safely, I'd\nbreak open the bottle. Every celebration that we had, I was going to use that bottle that my\ndad gave me. I never did. I never did because there was always liquor available. And this\nbecame kind of an icon, kind of a talisman. I thought as long as I had that, nothing\u2019s going to\nhappen to me. Because it somehow, it\u2019s somehow sacred. When I had this in my musette\n(ph) bag, with that little bottle of perfume, along with perfume for all the women in my\nfamily, Chanel, and Flue de Racai (ph), and all the Caron and I had lace from Belgium that I\nhad picked up and saved to take home as souvenirs. Everything was stolen out of my\nstateroom but that little bottle of perfume. And, the bottle of bourbon. And my dad and I had\nthe first two drinks out of that bottle. Well, I came back from the Riviera and kept working\nand for a while, we went, I was sent to Veeldflecken (ph). Now Veeldflecken (ph) was taken\nover by an Unrah (ph) team and we were already old hands at this. I only spent two weeks\nthere, about two weeks, and a member of the Unrah (ph) team was Kathleen Hulm (ph) who\nlater wrote \u201cA Nun\u2019s Story\u201d, that was made into a movie with Audrey Hepburn. And I met\nher and I have a copy of her book. I had a copy of her book but it\u2019s now in the archives, here\nin the museum. It\u2019s out of print and it\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful account of how a displaced\nperson camp is run, and how it should be run. All the trials, all the vicissitudes, all the\nproblems, all the glory and all the good feelings that you have when you see a job well done.\nI came back to Bamburg (ph) and by this time there was quite an attrition among the officers\nand enlisted men who were going back to the States. They\u2019d earned enough points to be sent\nback and I was put in, they had spread us out over several camps and I was sent to Koburg\n(ph) and that\u2019s where I had my greatest glory if there 1s such a thing. And I\u2019Il tell you what\nhappened at Koburg (ph).\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape #2",
        "A: Right. It was quite a coup, actually, I was the only officer in the camp. I was the second\nlieutenant. I had six enlisted men who were gems. They had been in DP camps, they had\nworked in DP camps, and we were the only American army personnel in the camp. The\ncamp, however, held between 11,000 and 15,000 eastern Europeans, mostly Poles.",
        "A: They were there when I got there. They\u2019d been collecting them. See, nothing travels faster\nthan a rumor in the army, or in a situation like this. When they told the people, the people\nwho\u2019d been slave laborers that they could get billeting and rations and so on, under the\nAmerican auspices, under the American army auspices, have a place to sleep, have a place to\neat, until they could be repatriated, but, on the other hand, many of them were already, had\nalready been repatriated and had come back. Because they had been fooled by Stalin. Stalin\neven sent special troops into the area to sort of prepare the people for coming home by\ntelling them that you\u2019re going to come home, you\u2019re going to be with your families, you\u2019re\ngoing to be on your farms, you\u2019re going to be in your villages, and life is going to be like it\nwas before. It didn\u2019t happen. Once the boxcars were sealed, I don\u2019t think they were really\nsealed in the manner that the boxcars were sealed, that\u2019s probably not a good word. Once\nthey were closed and they started the long trek to the East, when they got there, stories came\nback that they weren\u2019t even allowed to go into their own villages. That they went on to\nvarious goulag in Siberia and spent so much time because Stalin, Stalin sent his own son to\none of them, who\u2019d been in Germany as a slave laborer. He said they should have chosen\ndeath rather than work for the German war machine. That fought against Russia.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Many of them.",
        "A: We would organize, we would send them to a railhead at Lichtenfelds (ph) which was about\n15 kilometers from Koburg (ph), Koburg (ph). That was the railhead. We would put them on\ntrucks and the trucks, incidentally, belonged to the 1 1\" Panzer (ph) Division. They were SS\ntroops, run by Major McLean (ph), and this is a walking stick that he later carved and gave\nto me. Here it says, Coatsing (ph), that was their headquarters, May the 5\" 11\" Panzer (ph)\nDivision, 1945. Although it\u2019s a Scottish name, he was quite German. He had a complement\nof 175 vehicles, German vehicles. Some of them were halftracks, some were regular trucks,\nsome were similar to our jeeps, and some were what you might call pleasure cars, for\nofficers, perhaps an Opal, or one of the other small German car, Volkswagen. And we would\nload them onto these trucks. We gave them five days ration for the long trek back to Russia\nor Poland, to their villages. We saw that they were well clothed, we saw that families went\ntogether, quite unlike the transports that went to Treblinka and Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In the beginning. And then we had to force them to get on the trucks.",
        "A: 1500 a day.",
        "A: It seemed to go on forever. But it was around, I guess this lasted, this lasted until about\nMarch of \u201946.",
        "A: Five or six months.",
        "A: Almost daily. The constant\u2014we took a census of the camp from time to time. It wasn\u2019t a\ndaily census \u2014 maybe every week, every two weeks and found that the constant number was\nalways between 13,000 and 15,000 people. But there were around 1500 a day that left for the\nrailhead and around 1500 a day that came in from other camps, from the German\ncountryside, people who\u2019d continued to work, under the German \u2014 not as slave laborers. But\nsome of them stayed in Germany who heard about what was going on after they were being\nrepatriated. Some of the them wanted to stay in Germany and work on the German economy.\nThat didn\u2019t last too long. They started coming into camps where they could get rations, from\nthe American Army, from Unrah(ph), from Quakers, from \u2014 there were many organizations\nthat would send boxes of food in. Dry milk, dried eggs, whatever. And this was, this was the\nalmost, you\u2019d almost count on 1500 going out every day or two and we have of course, we\nhave photos of all that. They send \u2014 and they decorated the trucks with boughs. It looked like\nArbor Day. They put all sorts of tree branches on the trucks. Then they had huge photos of\nStalin and Lenin and they sang Russian songs and we had Russian officers at the exchange\npoints, at Lichtenfelds (ph) to see that everything was run properly, that they got on these\ntrains. Later on, to our shame, our halftracks drove up and guns were mounted on the\nhalftracks, and they were forced to get on the trains to go back.",
        "A: Actually, it was gradual. And then it got to the point where I didn\u2019t always go to the\nrailheads. I went there very seldom after it started running. To Lichtenfelds (ph).",
        "A: In the beginnings, I would go. On some of the trains there. . .",
        "A: Happy. Happy, singing.",
        "A: Maybe a little subterfuge. A little tell the story about how nice it was going to be after they\ngot there, that they were going to their own villages, using the same line that the Russians\nused. And the Russians were there to back us up, to help us with this.",
        "A: It slowly dawned on all of us. It\u2019s in all the books now \u2014 our disgraceful forced repatriation.\nBut we couldn\u2019t do anything else \u2014 they couldn\u2019t live with us for -- in the camps forever.\nThey couldn\u2019t live on the German economy forever. Even the Germans were having \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t sympathize with them that much, only as one human being to another \u2014 but they were\nhaving a difficult time. As a matter of fact, those who saved Jewish children started turning\nthem over to the American army so that we would make different billets and different camps\nfor them. And I think I showed you earlier, in the chronology of what happened during the\nwar, that the Joint Distribution Committee and they were a tremendous during the war, a\ntremendous help. They saved my life many times. Gathered up orphans from Buchenwald,\nin the Buchenwald area and sent them to France. I received orders from Third Army\nheadquarters to form an orphanage for Jewish children who\u2019d been turned back by the\nGermans who had saved them during the war and were turning them back to the army to be\nfed and clothed by army personnel. And there was a sanitarium, the Strooth (ph) Sanitarium.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve mentioned that name in years. But now I know, that was the name of it.\nThe Strooth (ph) Sanitarium near Onzbock (ph). And I was to get 40 orphans to billet there\nand my main adversary was an American officer who received orders about the same time\nthat I did for the orphans, he received orders to find billets for returning German prisoners of\nwar. And I had to put up a big fight to get this Strooth (ph) Sanitarium for my orphans. And\ninstead of getting 40, over 200 came in. And while I\u2019m on the story, the Joint Distribution\nCommittee had teachers, or they had people who \u2014 they were preparing these orphans for\nIsrael, like the Opon (ph) and they taught them Hebrew, they were teaching them folk\ndancing. And it was a wonderful, wonderful camp and wonderful experience for them. And\none day, one -- a little girl from the camp came into my office and gave me that block of\nwood that\u2019s now in the archives at the museum. She had carved what looked like the Fleur\nde Lee (ph) that the Girl Scouts \u2014 apparently they were basing their training perhaps on what\nthey do with the Girl Scouts. And she gave this to me and I saved it all these years, 50 years,\nuntil I came here 1n the end of June to turn over a lot of my artifacts and that\u2019s one of the\nthings that I gave to the museum. I later heard from her, from Israel, it was Palestine then,\ntelling me how happy she was. I haven\u2019t been able to find that letter. I saved all the letters\nthat I received. My dear, dear sisters saved all the letters that I wrote for four years in the\narmy and I have a journal for almost every day because I wrote quite a bit and I had a little\nhigh school girl working in my home the past month or so before school started and she was\nputting the letters into polyurethane sleeves and so far she\u2019s used 1200 sleeves. It doesn\u2019t\nmean I wrote 1200 letters. This is just the year of 1945 and beginning of \u201946 before I came\nhome. But several of my letters were five and six pages long. But I\u2019m so happy to have this\nall, all four years preserved. And also letters that I got from different people \u2014 I\u2019m doing the\nsame thing with them. But I haven\u2019t found her letter. I haven\u2019t found her letter.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, not only were they coming to an end, but the army involvement was becoming less and\nless and they were being turned over to Unrah (ph). The camps were being run by Unrah\n(ph). Now before that time, I had to suffer through another inspection that turned out to be\nquite a coup for me. Major General Robertson, commanding general of the 15\" Corps, I\nbelieve it was, came into my camp, with Major General Richardson. And he, too, was very\ncomplimentary and then he left. He sent back a letter of commendation which I have here.\nYes. 15\" Corps. Major General Robertson. \u201cI wish to take this opportunity to commend you\nfor the excellent work you\u2019ve done at Koburg (ph) Displaced Persons Camp. My recent\ninspection revealed that your earnest efforts and ingenius use of all available facilities have\nsolved many seemingly hopeless problems. A fine organization and administration of the\ncamp reflects the highest credit upon you and your accomplishments.\u201d",
        "A: Well...",
        "A: Well, I'll give you one example. We had to find enough coal and enough wood to heat the\ncauldrons that made the food. The main food was soups, different soups.",
        "A: 11,000 people a day. We had to cut down entire forests, to get wood to burn 1n the kitchens.",
        "A: We\u2019d go out, well, that\u2019s where the German \u2014 the German battalion that worked with me \u2014\nthey were very good at ferreting out these places. It so happened that one of them belonged\nto a baroness. She came into my camp and begged me not to touch her trees. We had to. We\nhad to. It was in our area and we needed, we needed the wood. Before \u2014 now, do you know\nthat Germany was divided into four parts after the war? The American Occupied Zone of\nGermany, the British, French and Russian Occupied Zone. During the early days of the\nRussian occupation of Germany, which was just north of us, I found out that there was a\nwarehouse that had the leather pants that the SS troop, the motorcycle troops wore. And\nthere were hundreds of thousands of those leather pants. So Germans, well, many Europeans\nlove rubber stamps. If something has a rubber stamp on it, 1t must be authentic. So I had a\nbunch of rubber stamps made up, in Koburg (ph), in one of the offices that made them and it\nsaid, \u201cPlease give bearer, whatever, the above merchandise,\u201d and stamped it military\ngovernment, Unites States Military Government. I\u2019ve forgotten now what I put on it. But I\nsent these German trucks up to Soldenburg (ph), which was just beyond the American\nOccupied Zone of Germany and into the Russian Occupied Zone. And they loaded those\ntrucks up with all the leather pants. Now the reason I did that is because in my zone, my area,\nthere was a shoe factory. They didn\u2019t have any uppers, but they had all the Airsots (ph)\nleathers, Airsots (ph) soles. And we were buying these things, we were buying equipment\nfrom the German \u2014 or articles of clothing from the Germans for the DPs and for the slave\nlaborers. We were able, with one pair of leather pants, we were able to make six pairs of\nshoes. Now I wanted to bring one pair home, as a souvenir, but I thought if I bring a pair of\nshoes home, that means somebody\u2019s going to have to without shoes, and I didn\u2019t. Oh, oh, do\nI think of that, when I see the shoes in the museum. That\u2019s what I think about \u2014 what we did\nso that they\u2019d have shoes. DPs. And what they did, and what they did when they took the\nshoes off -- the Jews before going in the undressing rooms -- before going into the\ncrematoria. So worried that our men wouldn\u2019t have shoes and they were so worried that they\ncouldn\u2019t take \u2018em off fast enough. They\u2019re in the bin, aren\u2019t they \u2014 in the museum. That\u2019s\nwhat I think about. Well, I received a letter of commendation from another major. I won\u2019t\nread it \u2014 it\u2019s on record, thanking me for this ingenuity. But you do things. I don\u2019t know\nwhere it comes from. You \u2014 I set up a theater. You have pictures of that. They had their own\nentertainment. We had a hospital \u2014 we had a wonderful hospital. I also had Polish army\npersonnel attached to my camp.",
        "A: They had been slave laborers but they had been taken as prisoners. But they were army\nofficers. They were Polish army officers and the Polish army in exile in London decreed that\nthey work in these camps to help repatriate the Poles. And if I can put my hand on it right\naway, maybe I won\u2019t take the time now, but they wore patches that said Polish Army\nDisplaced Person, Third Army, Number Ten. That was my camp. DPTA10 \u2014 that was the\nname of my camp. Oh, what a badge of honor that was \u2014 for them. It gave them the run of\nthe camp. They had wonderful uniforms to wear \u2014 it was kind of a mixed uniform \u2014\nAmerican officer uniform and Polish officer uniforms. But they wore their berets with the\nPolish emblem on it and this nice emblem wasn\u2019t like the yellow Star of David the Jews had\nto wear, in disgrace.",
        "A: They were housed in the barracks . . .",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Not only were families together, but sometimes when they got their potato rations,\nthey made vodka. And every once in a while, we had to raid the camp, when we knew that\nthere were stills, and people told us, because, actually, it was \u2014 1t had become poisonous, a\nlot of the vodka that they made. I don\u2019t know what they mixed it with. They mixed it with\nalcohol that you put in cars and there were some horrible scenes. But they lived, I assure\nyou, they lived much better than they had ever lived up until that time under the German\nrule.",
        "A: They had three meals a day. Not only did they have three meals a day but we had a\nnutritionist attached to the camp. Two nutritionists \u2014 we had an American nutritionist and\none on the Unrah (ph) team. There was a schedule, there was a roster \u2014 so many calories for\nadults, so many calories for children at a certain age, so many calories for youngsters, those\nwho got skim milk, those got regular milk with cream. Incidentally, Strooth (ph) Sanitarium,\nfor the orphans, was near Striker\u2019s Farm. Striker, who was the number one Jew-Baiter (ph)\nof Germany \u2014 I saw him \u2014 I went to the Nuremburg war trials one day. We were able to get\neggs and butter and milk from his farm. His farm functioned during the entire war \u2014 it never\nstopped producing. At first 1t bothered me and then I thought why should it bother me?\nWe\u2019re getting all this good stuff from him. Incidentally, we got fresh vegetables and butter\nand fresh meat from the German economy. We had demands, we had regular requisitions\nthat we gave the military, the German military command, in each city, and they had to\nsupply so much.",
        "A: And they did. And they cried plenty. I have letters here, telling us that it\u2019s getting more and\nmore difficult to supply us with what, with what we\u2019re requesting. Well, we cut it down. We\ncompromised. But we weren\u2019t . We were a little more humane.",
        "A: Army.",
        "A: The German, actually, the German civilian. It was called, had the name here, called the\nGerman Food Commission, I believe. And they had set up this commission to supply fresh\nfood for the camps.",
        "A: Yes. Whatever they could get \u2014 beans, corn, lentils which of course is a form of beans.",
        "A: Fresh meat. I rather think some of the nice meat we got was horse meat. But as long as, as\nlong, and I\u2019ve eaten it. As long as I didn\u2019t know what it was, it didn\u2019t bother me. And it was\nsupplemented by different charity organizations that would send food in.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: But somehow it worked out, somehow it worked out. There were times, there were times\nwhen I felt like I was in a pressure cooker and I had to let off some steam. And there was a\nvery, you couldn\u2019t call it a mountain, \u2018course Bavaria 1s beautiful and there\u2019s all sorts of\nmountains around in the area, but a couple of times I had to get in my jeep and drive up to\nthe highest point and get out and scream. Just scream. To know what?",
        "A: Well, it was getting orders that camp was going to be inspected and trying to get everybody\nto work, to see that things were clean. And inspect the kitchens, to see, we didn\u2019t want\ntyphus to break out. We didn\u2019t want any of the, any contagious diseases. We didn\u2019t, we kept\nfighting, we kept fighting food sources. That was the main thing. And whenever a shipment\ncame in, right into the camp, people knew about it. Especially, if they came, if they were\nthings that came, not from the army or from the German economy but things that came in\nfrom some of the other support groups. I keep saying Quakers because they were really very\npredominant in this but there were other \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think of some of the other civilian\ngroups in the United States that sent food over. But when those, when those shipments came\nin, they would gather around the truck and almost act like, I don\u2019t like to use the word\nanimals, but it, everybody wanted to get in front. \u201cThrow me a box of this. Throw this to me.\nI want this. Throw it. I\u2019m here. Throw it to me. Ah, here, I need this. My child needs this.\u201d\n\u2018\u201cHere\u2019s some dry milk. Here\u2019s some Hersheys, some Hersheys candy bars. Cigarettes.\u201d\nThese are the things that were prized and that\u2019s what I had my nightmares over after I got\nhome, many, many months later.",
        "A: I'd wake up and look at the end of the bed and I'd see these people coming over it, over my\nknees, and screaming for food.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There were a lot of perks, believe me. I was amply repaid. And not\njust, 1t was, it was a very good feeling to know that you\u2019re helping these people. Because of,\nbecause of the, because of the commendation that I got, from Major General Robertson, I\nwas able to, he promoted me to captain. A major general can do that \u2014 they call it a\nbattlefield promotion. That was wonderful. I went in as a private and thought, gee, I\u2019d like to\ncome out as a captain. That seemed like \u2014 I didn\u2019t want anything more. And it did happen.\nAnd then because of Major General Robertson, because of this letter of commendation, it\nentitled me to the army commendation medal, which I have. And I thought I brought it in\nhere.",
        "A: Yes, but before I go into that...",
        "A: In sending the western Europeans home, and I\u2019Il come back to that, in sending the western\nEuropeans home, we had a French team attached to the camp and it was called the MMLA,\nMission Militaire Liaison (ph) Administratif. We had three French officers, men, and one\nfemale officer. The female officer was Russian, of Russian origin, but had lived in France\nmany years. And they helped us repatriate the western Europeans. And they were\ntremendous help. One was a doctor, two of them, two of them were doctors. One wore a\nsignet ring \u2014 it didn\u2019t mean anything to me at the time, and Ill tell you what happened much\nlater on, but he was a Bourbon (ph), he was of the Bourbon (ph) royalty. French Bourbon\n(ph). And the most helpful was the woman because I had all these eastern Europeans, too, as\nwell as the western Europeans. And they wanted to stay, they worked very hard and it was\nan opportunity for them to learn English, from us, and we learned as much French as we\ncould from them. Now, you asked me, about the camp that I was coming back to...",
        "A: The Jews.",
        "A: Up until that time, up until that time, there were Jews, but they came in as DPs. This was in\nthe beginning. They came into camp and when I knew who they were, and they had their\nown way of, of, of being in their own group. And when they realized that this camp was\nreally a repatriation camp, a camp that was sending people back east, when they realized\nthey couldn\u2019t go back, then they wanted to get to Jewish camps. And who took them to the\nJewish camps? What irony. My German major from the Panzer (ph) Division in his trucks.\nLoaded them up \u2014 and he knew. And I knew that he knew. But they got very good treatment\nand they went to camps in southern Bavaria. There was Ogsburg (ph), there was a camp in\nOgsburg (ph), there was a camp at Strowbing (ph), there was a camp, there was one they\ncalled the Funk Casairn (ph). Casairn (ph) means camp. I knew that that was a Jewish camp\nand he and his men had orders to take the Jews.",
        "A: Early \u00b046.",
        "A: Beginning, beginning in winter of \u201945 and early \u201946. Now, when, when Unrah (ph) started\ntaking over the camps, I was transferred. I\u2019m trying to think if there was anything more I\nwanted to tell you about Koburg, except that 1t was running rather smoothly, although people\nstarted trickling back and telling their countrymen that they weren\u2019t allowed to go home, that\nthey were sent to Siberia. So that meant that more came in and that we would have to\ncontinue to take care of them. On Bastille Day in camp, one of the French officers almost\nblew up the camp celebrating Bastille Day. Jacques Jencam (ph) was his name. And when he\nleft, he told me if I ever got to Paris to be sure and look him up, which I later did, but that\u2019s,\nPll go into that. Now, I, when the work was running smoothly in the camps, and, as I said,\nthey had their own hospitals, they had their own entertainment. We were invited to many of\nthe affairs that they had in camp, as guests of honor, and I went. I danced to many a oom-\npah-pah band and Polish, and the polka. I liked to dance. Then I was transferred to Onzbock\n(ph) which was outside of Nuremburg. And I was put in charge of several DP camps and\nalso the exchange point at Hoapf, (ph) Germany, and we have that on the map. Now the\nreason it was called an exchange point is because, apparently, and I believe it was at the\nYalta Conference, we, that is the four major powers, said that we would repatriate the\nGermans, also, who had been displaced because of war. German for German, who had been\ndisplaced prior to September the 1\u00b0, 1936. And they all, and they came from Russian zone\ninto the American zone through Hoapf (ph), Germany. And I was in charge of that exchange\npoint. Excuse me. And it was through this exchange point, the Jews came in. They also had\ngone back to Poland, or wherever. And they thought that they, well they did, they knew their\nhomes were already occupied, their farms had been occupied, and they were being killed.\nThe progroms had started. A little anecdote. When the Allies got onto the government of\nPoland, after the war, immediately after the war, and started chastising them for starting\nthese anti-Semitic picadilloes again, this one telegram that they got, or communicae that they\ngot, said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can be so unhappy with us. We\u2019ve only burned one\nsynagogue since last August.\u201d This 1s what was happening. Lodz (ph), Lodz (ph), the city of\nLodz (ph), that had 200,000 Jews before the war, two of them came back. The Lodz (ph)\nUprising. When they were subdued, they were all taken out, but 40 of them hid 1n the, in\nvarious cellars, underground sewers. This is why they either didn\u2019t go, or went and came\nback. Poles wanted to kill them. They didn\u2019t want to give up their homes. They didn\u2019t want\nto give up their farms. I\u2019m not talking about the Poles that came to American during the\nmass migration in 1906 and 1909. They came for the same reason my folks came \u2014 to get\naway from religious persecution and to have a better life for their children. There was a\nPolish family that took care of all of us in Saint, little St. Joseph, Missouri. They were like\nbrothers and sisters to my father and mother because they spoke Polish. My folks did too --\nRussian Polish. These are people that had been so indoctrinated with the hatred who had\nhelped, I think they showed the Nazis a few things, and so did the Estonians and Lithuanians\nand the Latvians. They came out smelling like a rose, too, after the war. To make Patton say,\nwhen he talked about the dirty, filthy Jews, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re nothing like the Estonians.\u201d\nWell, how could they be? Where was the soap? Where were the water levels in the billets\nthat they were in? There wasn\u2019t any water, there wasn\u2019t any running water! How could they\nuse the latrines or the toilets? He didn\u2019t think about that. And it was against his Anglo-Saxon\nsensitivities to put them in German homes. You can\u2019t displace Germans! For the Jews? \u201cI\ncan\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. I\u2019m digressing.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was a big job. It was a big job and I didn\u2019t do it alone. We had security troops there\nstationed...",
        "A: March.",
        "A: March. We\u2019re talking about March, \u201946.",
        "A: February, March.",
        "A: We had security patrols around there and we had, we had people, offices set up and they all\nhad papers. They all had the, they all had the papers. Everyone had papers . . .",
        "A: Germans had papers, the Jews coming across had their papers. I don\u2019t think that they were\nthe correct papers, I know that they weren\u2019t. I know that they were false papers but they were\ncoming in as German nationals. And they had been doing that for months. I know at least\nthat \u2019d helped about 900 come through. And this one time, I might as well get onto this\nstory, because it happened. There were 125 caught coming, Jews, coming across the border\nwith, at Hoapf (ph). They had the security patrol pick them up and he called in Onzbock\n(ph), and wanted to know what to do with them. I said, \u201cPut them all in jail at Hoapf (ph).\u201d\nNow this is in Mittenwald (ph). Mittenwald (ph) is the county and Hoapf (ph) is the main\ncity. The Joint Distribution Committee was working out of the jail and they were handling\nall the Jews, many of the Jews that were coming through. Now there\u2019s a lot that enters into\nthis. The extreme efficiency of the Germans. By now the trains were running, by now the\nelectricity was on, all the gas, water and that wasn\u2019t too long after the war ended.",
        "A: Less than a year. And the people that were supposed to be doing all this were still back in the\nmilitary government schools at the University, the University of Michigan, Harvard or Yale\n\u2014 the Ivy League schools. They were learning German, they were learning Polish, they were\nlearning Russian, they were learning French, so that they\u2019d know how to handle the DPs\nwhen they got to Europe. They got there after it was all over. But it worked. And now this\nwas an officer \u2014 this was a captain, the security officer and he wanted to know what to do\nwith their papers. I said, \u201cSend them to me by courier,\u201d and incidentally, among my pictures\nthat I gave Bob Kesting (ph), just yesterday, I have a picture of the courier. And it got to me,\nin Onzbock (ph), to my billet, at the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel, about three in the morning,\nand I burned them. I don\u2019t know why. It just seemed to be the thing to do. You have\nevidence of some transgression \u2014 you get rid of it.",
        "A: It really didn\u2019t matter \u2014 about burning them because I knew that they could make new\npapers. It amounted to just the same as the paper \u2014 but I didn\u2019t want to have any of the\nevidence because of what was going to happen. I knew I would have to account for it. By\nmorning, by morning, they were all out of jail. The guards had been bribed with money, with\ndrinks, with liquor and the Jews were on trains, again going to Jewish DP camps in the\nAmerican Occupied Zone of Germany. The story doesn\u2019t end there with me. I was called\ninto the office\u2014my commanding officer\u2019s office \u2014 who was a colonel. And I shan\u2019t tell you\nhis name. I\u2019ve never mentioned his name. He was regular army. He had appropriated the\nfinest chalet in Onzbock, for his family. They were coming over. After all, this was a war of\noccupation. He had appropriated one of Hitler\u2019s specially built Mercedes-Benz bullet-proof\ntouring cars for his own. And he called me in because the security officer at Hoapf (ph) told\nhim what had happened. He said, \u201cWhat do you know about this?\u201d I said \u201cWell, I know\nthat 125 Jews, approximately, 125 Jews tried to come across the border last night and I told\nthe captain to put them all in jail.\u201d He said \u201cWell, they\u2019re all gone now. Where do you think\nthey are?\u2019 And I said \u201cWell, I think they\u2019re all very happily ensconced in Jewish DP camps\nin Bavaria, in southern Germany.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, this is conduct unbecoming an\nAmerican officer and I\u2019m going to have to court-martial you.\u201d Well. \u201cWe, Pll send for\nsomeone from the Judge Advocate Division, Third Army headquarters to come up and take a\ndeposition. Meanwhile, you\u2019re under arrest of quarters at the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel.\u201d I\nfound this the other night. I knew something would happen \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be able to put my\nhands on these things. Nevertheless, that\u2019s where we were billeted. It was a little\nembarrassing to go from his office, with two MPs, one on each side of me and put me under\narrest of quarters in my hotel room. And I could only leave to go to eat, also, under guard.\nHe, I saw him afterwards, before the, it would have been the attorney from the judge\nadvocate, judge advocate\u2019s office, whatever, to come up and take a deposition prior to a\ncourt martial \u2014 I saw him. My colonel. And I said, \u201cColonel\u201d \u2014 now I want you to know that\nI was just a kid, according to what I am now, I was just a kid, but you grow up very fast in\nthe army. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me if you court martial me. I\u2019m\nsure I'll be breaking rocks at Fort Leavenworth. But you\u2019re going to be right beside me.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cI'll just have to tell them how you allowed all your men\nto go into my DP camps, your officers gave them furloughs and leaves to go into my DP\ncamps and shack up with the women in the camp. You gave them extra rations. You drew\narmy rations that you shouldn\u2019t have so that they could have a wonderful time sleeping with\nmy women in the camps!\u201d They were so bold and so blazen about this that they walked\naround in their uniforms. They didn\u2019t even bother to get into civilian clothes.",
        "A: Of course. Yes. Couldn\u2019t fraternize with them at all. There were all sorts of directives. We\nhad a little pamphlet that Bradley put out. It\u2019s in the archives \u2014 I gave it to them. \u201cSo Pll\nhave to tell them that.\u201d And he thought for a moment. I said, \u201c\u201cYou know, you can delegate\ncommand in the army, as a colonel, you can tell me, as a captain, what to do, but the\nresponsibility is still your responsibility. And all this happened under your nose.\u201d What\u2019s\n125 Jews? There were close to a thousand. This had been going on for months. And it\nworked. It didn\u2019t mean anything to him. The lives of 125 Jews, or even a thousand,\ncompared to what he was going to have after his family came over. This fine chalet in\nOnzbock (ph) where they could go skiing at Garmish (ph), Garmish Pardonkershem (ph).\nWhere they could go into Nuremburg, where the Passion Play already started. And over\nAmergal (ph), they could have that. Oh, I don\u2019t know how he ended up. Probably, may be,\nmaybe made general one day, who knows? I was, but. . .",

        "A: That\u2019s very good. Sometime in the summer of \u201945, perhaps around June...",
        "A: Yes. Yes. A group of Palestinian officers, now we must remember it wasn\u2019t called Israel\nthen, they were Jewish officers who had fought with the Palestinian brigade in North Africa.\nAnd they had permission from Third Army headquarters and they had their papers with them\nand they had a roster of families and names with them. And you have a picture of that in\nyour archives. And I\u2019m so proud of them. I\u2019m standing right in the middle of them. I just\nwanted to be with them because of what they were doing. They were trying to find,\nostensibly, they were trying to find, survivors of the relatives of members of the Palestinian\nBrigade. Well, this is true, they were, and they did find as many as they could. But, it was to\nbe a cover for the Jewish Underground. And what they were trying to do was to get the\nsympathies of the American Jewish officers, mostly American Jewish officers, although a\nvery dear friend of mine that I worked with who is non-Jewish helped a lot. And therein lies\nanother story but, and when they realized that I would do all that I could to help out, they,\nthey were satisfied and pleased. And I think, I think if, if the museum would blow up this\nphoto that I had, that there might be some faces on there that are easily recognizable because\nI\u2019m sure that they later became leaders in the state of Israel or in, again, with repatriation of,\nof Jewish DPs, Jewish slave laborers. And I think we might find among them some who had\nreally dedicated the rest of their lives to this type of work.",
        "A: No, no, I was told.",
        "A: I was told, yes. I was told when they found out that \u2014 I had actually been sending, I\u2019d been\nsending Jews. They knew and I told them that I was sending them with the German battalion\nto various camps and so it wasn\u2019t, it really wasn\u2019t all that new for me to do. All it meant was\nthat they knew that they could come into my camp, you know, with an open heart, and\nfreely, and without fear of being spied upon and told to go back.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes. The White Paper, the Offer Declaration, the, the many sad stories of barely getting to\nthe shores and not being allowed to land. Incidentally, they were not only coming from Italy,\nthey were coming from Greece, also.",

They\u2019d come up, the papers were dated and had the\nletterheads \u2014 were from the Third Army Headquarters at Bod Toles (ph) which was south of\nMunich and it was very legitimate. The legitimate part was that they were looking for\nsurvivors. The other part was that they were also looking for people who were sympathetic\ntowards getting the Jews into camps, helping them get into camps. But, God bless the Jews,\nthey sort of organized themselves and knew where they wanted to go, and knew how to get\nthere. They just, they just couldn\u2019t have, didn\u2019t want any interference. There was still, you\nsee when the war ended, there was such a, there was such a, a, thrust by the Germans, the\nyoung Germans, to poison the minds of the American soldiers. Now these were soldiers who\nhad never fought in any of the wars, they were fresh from the States and they came in and\nthey saw all the dirty DPs and they saw the dirty French and they saw the dirty Poles, and\nthey saw the dirty this and the dirty that, and the nice clean efficient Germans. Well, of\ncourse they were. All the soap went to Germany. \u201cCourse they might have been washing\nthemselves with one of their ancestors, I don\u2019t know. We know how some of the soap was\nmade. In fact, I have a ship, or had one, that had the Nina, one of Columbus\u2019s vessels, a\ncopy of it, and the sails were made out of human skin. And I wanted to bring it back and put\nit in one of the museums in St. Joe. And I did bring it back, but it\u2019s disappeared.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Not all. Not all but this was just another little murder. This was another little battle\nthat we had to contend with. They didn\u2019t have to draw, they didn\u2019t have to draw KP\nanymore. The Germans did that, the Germans peeled the potatoes, the Germans did the\ncooking for the army. They didn\u2019t have to draw extensive guard duty. You know, there was\nno more, you know there was no more fear of being invaded, of having your, your command\npost taken over by Germans or any kind of invading army. Was no longer in existence. All\nthey had to do was sleep with the German girls and drink the champagne and schnapps. It\nwas a great life! We didn\u2019t want these dirty people to interfere with it. Get rid of \u2018em. Put\n\u2018em in jail.",
        "A: I really do. Maybe I\u2019m very cynical about it, maybe I\u2019m overemphasizing it, but I saw it\nright after the war ended. Perhaps with all the directives that were sent out and that little\nbooklet that every soldier had to have, that Omar Bradley \u2014 you have it, they have it at the\nmuseum. I gave it to them. Perhaps with that, 1f they complied with what he asked them to,\nthings might have been better afterwards. But they were seeing the world through Uncle Sam\nand having a ball. They knew nothing about what went before. If they had read about it, or if\nthey were told about it, it didn\u2019t have the force or the power or the \u2014 it didn\u2019t affect them the\nway it did the soldiers who were right there and really knew what had happened.",

Or why, why would I try\nto get them down to Italy so that they could get on ships for Israel \u2018cause they\u2019re not going to\ntake them anyway? They won\u2019t take them \u2014 they started taking them in Brazil, incidentally.\nWe didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t take them until much later but that\u2019s a whole other story. Again, it was\nvery chaotic, even at that time, as to what to do. Most important thing was to see that they\nwere well fed and clothed and had some degree of contentment and family because they,\nand, in some way, and some way that they could really reckon with their tremendous loss.",
        "A: They were mostly Jews who had gone back to Poland.",

Couldn\u2019t get back into their homes.\nLook, it had been how many years since they\u2019d been gone? If we go back to \u201933 and now,\nwell not so much in Poland, we\u2019ll go to \u201939 and here it\u2019s \u201945, \u201946 \u2014 people\u2019d been living in\ntheir homes for five years and tilling the soil, their farms, milking their cows and had a\ndegree of prosperity that they had never known before. The Russians, the Poles, who had\ntaken over, mostly Poland, Lithuania, had taken over the Jewish homes. They didn\u2019t want\nthem back and they knew that if they stayed they would, 1n all probability, be killed because\nthe progroms were starting again. Those were the ones who were coming back and they\ndidn\u2019t want to stay in the Russian zone. They knew that they would get better treatment in\nthe American zone. And by coming into the American zone, they could get closer, and\ncloser, and closer to either the United States or Israel. Those were the two main places that\nthey wanted to go.",

        "A: Yeah, but I had to be very careful, you see. I had, I had, above all, I was an American army\nofficer. I was in charge of the other Displaced Person Camps in the area, as well as this\nexchange point so I had to sort of walk",

        "A: Yeah, I could, yes, I could oversee the German transfer. But it was carried along as the same\ntime as the Jews were coming across. So it was best just to let 1t happen.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. Only the one, no. None of those. But of course those who came through my camp at\nKoburg (ph), I knew when they were coming through and I knew when they were going out\nwith the, in the trucks and they got special care \u2014 food, clothing. Years later, well let\u2019s go\nback to where, if you like, where I was almost court-martialed. Is that alright? Anyway, I\nwas put under arrest of quarters in Onzbock (ph). In the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel. And as I\nsaid before, I told the colonel that you can\u2019t, that the responsibility was all his and it was\nunder his command. Now and he had all his family coming over, they were all ready to come\nover for the duration, however long that was going to be. And the next day, there were orders\nthat came from Third Army Headquarters sending me home. That\u2019s among the orders that\nyou have. Now they would send divisions home, they would send battalions home, and my\norders came through, one person, Captain Joe Friedman, report to Camp Philip Morris. And\nI was escorted by the two military government, by the two MPs, to the train. We went by car\nto Frankfurt \u2014 we got on the train there for Paris. Now Jacques Jangcam (ph), who had the\nBourbon (ph) signet ring, or crest, told me that if I ever got to Paris, to call him. Well, we\nhad to change trains, either from the Guardinore (ph), or whatever. I don\u2019t remember\nbecause, because it\u2019s been 50 years ago. But I took a chance and I called him. Had his phone\nnumber in my little book when I knew I was going through Paris and I called him and he\nasked me \u2014 and he was home! And he asked me where I was and I told him I was at the train\nstation. And I told him what the circumstances were \u2014 that were two MPs guarding me \u2014 but\nat the time they were looking at magazines and French postcards in the train station. And he\nsaid, \u201cI know that train station.\u201d He said, \u201cI'll be over there. You stay in the phone booth\nand pretend that you\u2019re talking to me. I\u2019Il be over there in about ten minutes and when you\nsee me in the doorway, you come out of the telephone booth and come right to where I am\nand we\u2019 ll get in my car and I\u2019Il take you home \u2014 to my, to my home.\u201d And that\u2019s what\nhappened. I don\u2019t think anything happened to the MPs, because they were all so happy to get\nrid of me. I\u2019m sure that when he went back, when they went back to Onzbock (ph), and told\nthe colonel what had happened, he probably felt that it would be fine if I was arrested for\nbeing AWOL, or whatever. But, what actually happened was that Jacques took me to his\nhome. And his home happened to be a floor through apartments, apartment in the\nTrockadeero (ph) Section of Paris. And you could see the Eiffel Tower from their home,\ntheir apartment. And it was the type of apartment that the elevator opened up into their, well\nas long as it\u2019s French I\u2019d better say foyer, but it opened up into their foyer. And I, his\ngrandmother lived with them, and I received her, I was given her suite of rooms while I was\nthere, which consisted of a sitting room, a bedroom and a bathroom. And I was served\nbreakfast in bed. In fact, I had to wait until the maid got out, left the room so I could get out\nof bed and put the tray on the dresser so I could have breakfast comfortably. I found out what\nthe signet ring was: their dining room \u2014 they had tapestries all over the, all over the\napartment and they were these tapestries that depicted all the wars that the Bourbons (ph)\nhad fought in from whenever to wherever. And he was the descendant of the kings and it\ndidn\u2019t mean anything to him except that he had this signet ring that he wore. And it was also\nin needlepoint on the back of all the chairs in the dining room. And Jacques had a sister who\nshowed me around Paris. We went to the Louvre \u2014 we did all the typical tourist things and I\nwas there for about four days. I was very anxious \u2014 I was a little afraid that something might\nhappen and I did leave after, I think it was four or five days. But I\u2019d been to the Leedo (ph)\nand the Moulon (ph) Rouge and the Casino de Paris and to the Napoleon\u2019s tomb and the\nfamous cemetery \u2014 well, whatever. I'll think of it. And I got to Camp Philip Morris. I could\nhave stayed in Paris for a month! When I reported there, they said, \u201cWell, you\u2019 Il go out on\nthe next available ship, boat.\u201d Washtub is what it was. It was a victory ship. I crossed in the\nAmsterdam, the SS something Amsterdam which was a huge luxury vessel. Took us four\nand a half days to cross \u2014 took me ten days to get back, and it was during that time and I was\nin a stateroom with other officers, and that\u2019s when all my things were stolen. With the\nexception of that one bottle of perfume and the fifth of Three Feathers. That was a very\npopular brand of bourbon during the war that I later had with my dad. Then, I came home\nand I had a very difficult time. I was being separated from the service at Jefferson Barracks\nand I sort of broached on this subject when we were talking before, but the first person I saw\nwas a friend of mine that I grew up with in St. Joe and he was playing cards in the officers\u2019\nrecreation room. And I ran up to him and I said, \u201cPaul!\u201d You know, I was so happy to be\nhome! I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be in St. Joe! They\u2019re shipping me out tomorrow! Is there\nanything you want me to tell your folks \u2014 I'll call them!\u201d And he said, \u201cEh, I see them every\nweekend.\u201d He had spent the entire war in Jefferson Barracks. I guess he did something.\nSomething that was necessary to the war effort. But it hit me, really, how . Four\nyears I\u2019ve been in this man\u2019s army. Finally got home. I\u2019d been home before on furloughs and\non leaves during the time that I was in the States. My army career was sort of evenly divided.\nI, I spent two years in the States and two years in Europe. Then I was ordered to report to the\nparade grounds at Jefferson Barracks before being separated from the service. And I was\nwearing my captain, my captain\u2019s bars and I thought oh-oh, my AWOL caught up with me.\nHere it comes, the saber, you know, cutting all these things off. But instead, that\u2019s when I\nwas given the army, the commendation medal, that beautiful commendation medal, because\nin my records it had this letter from Major General Robertson which entitled me to the --\nand the orders in my file.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing, nothing, nothing. Nothing.",
        "A: Very difficult. Very difficult. I, in the army you always wait for someone to tell you what to\ndo. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a private and the corporal tells you to pick up cigarette\nbutts or clean the latrine, or your platoon leader, your captain tells you to shape up these men\n\u2014 go on bivouac, maneuvers. There\u2019s always someone above you to tell you what to do and I\nwas waiting for someone to tell me what to do. I had this brother and sister living out in\nColorado and I went to visit them. And I spent almost the entire summer there \u2014 went to the\nmountains, breathing some nice fresh air and just relaxing. And slowly, the time was coming\nto go, when I would have to go back to school \u2014 if I wanted to finish school. And I was really\nvery reluctant to go and I think that this same thing followed me, this same feeling followed\nme until I gave up practice until I gave up my practice and left St. Joseph to seek my career \u2014\nanother career in the theater. I had the typical midlife crisis. I did go back to school because I\nthought let me finish one thing that I started. Let me at least do that. But I was very unhappy\nwhen I went back. Many men, many of the students in my class were much younger. They\nhad just come out of high school or you know, they\u2019d gotten a B.A. in college and had gone\non to podiatry school. And quite a few were married and I was kind of an old man at 26. And\nan angry old man because the world had passed me by. And I\u2019d lost four years. I really\nhadn\u2019t. It was the most formative four years that I could have had to prepare me for what\ncame later and that was just \u2014 that was life. I went back to school and I came back to St.\nJoseph to practice. My first year back at school, though, was the hardest and I knew that I\nwould need help. And the Veterans Administration had a counseling service at the\nUniversity of Chicago and I was able to go there, on Saturdays, every week for about six\nweeks. And I had a very intense and intensive meeting with a very, very good psychologist,\nanalyst, therapist, counselor that finally culminated in taking various tests. And I did. I took,\nbut I tried, I tried as objective as I could with these tests and they grade you, you know, on\nthe curve. Like, say in law, maybe four people will be better than you are if you follow that\nfield but 95 won\u2019t be as good as you. And, as I said, I tried to be as objective as I could in\ntaking the tests but the results were that I would probably be best in personnel management,\nlaw and then medicine. Medicine, of course, I\u2019d had two years of pre-med prior to going into\npodiatry school. So, I\u2019m sure that that showed up in the exams. And I came back and I\npracticed and I had a very lucrative practice for 14 years and then I had the typical midlife\ncrisis. And I see, gee, and I kept thinking about life back in the DP camps and how tenuous it\nis and how it just could hang by a thin thread. And you\u2019re here today and tomorrow the\nwhole thing could be wiped out. So live each day and, that\u2019s not knew with me, of course.\nBut live it the way you want to live it. And live it the way it'll give you the most pleasure,\nnot the most remuneration. But just that\u20191l make you a good man and I picked the most\ndifficult profession in the world. And I left St. Joe and joined a melodrama troupe in\nColorado, on the western slope. They called it the Kerosene (ph) Circuit. And I played\nAspen, Glenwood Springs, Leadville, Durango, Steamboat Springs \u2014 did it an entire\nsummer. And I was 42 years old then.",
        "A: As an actor in a melodrama. And I was fat and bald at that time, too. But at the end of the\nseason I went to New York and David Merrick, who was a very well-known producer at the\ntime, wasn\u2019t waiting for me. There was no red carpet, and I knew that if I wanted to do\ntheater, I\u2019d have to study and, at least the glossary of the theater. Even the terms: stage right,\nstage left, although in civic theater, I did quite a bit of it. Except we say now, \u201cYou go on\nthat side of the stage,\u201d when you\u2019re saying it and \u201cyou go on the other side of the stage.\u201d But,\nnevertheless, I did well. I started doing the soaps and I started doing, I did a couple of\nBroadway shows. I did several off-Broadway shows. I toured in industrials, I did\ncommercials and I met my dear, dear lovely wife. She was a gift.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, a lot of things entered into it. Yes they did. To begin with, I\u2019Il just give you a short\nhistory of my father. My father came over in the great wave of immigration, 1906. He was\nmarried, already, and had a child \u2014 my oldest brother, who will be 87 in November, next\nmonth. And he started peddling. It\u2019s the typical American story of the Jews who came over\nand put a pack on their back which he did, and sold needles and notions and dry goods \u2014\nwhatever he could carry \u2014 until he made enough money to buy a horse so that he could carry\nmore things over into Kansas from St. Joseph, Missouri. It\u2019s on the border between the, right\non the border between Kansas and Missouri. Made enough money then to buy a wagon so he\ncould carry more goods. Then made enough money to bring Mother over and my brother and\nhis sister. \u2019'm giving you all this background because of what has happened. When he had\nhis family over, when he had Mother, he didn\u2019t want to go peddling anymore. He wanted to\nestablish, to take root somewhere \u2014 in St. Joe. So he opened up a feed store. After all, there\nwere no, there were very few cars. I once read what, what really has happened in my lifetime\nin the way of automobiles and radio and television and airplanes and all the computers. This\nhas all happened, gee, in this century \u2014 not even the entire century, beginning, I remember\nlistening to the radio on the little battery. What\u2019d they call \u2014 my brother made it. We would\nlisten, we had earphones and I\u2019d listen on one and he\u2019d listen on the other. But then, we had\nthe last, after the feed store and when there weren\u2019t too many more horses, Dad opened up a\ngrocery store. In 1919, and to this day, my brother-in-law has that store. He and my oldest\nsister took over the store when I came home from, when my brother-in-law came home from\nthe army. Incidentally, my brother-in-law and I were both in the same unit, until we were\nseparated and I went into all this other work and he stayed with the 95\" Infantry Division.\nAnd every once in a while, if he has two beers, he\u2019 II let you know how he took Metts (ph) \u2014\nand, and he did. Wonderful, wonderful man but I just lost my sister a few months before my\nwife died. These letters that she saved...",
        "A: Now. When I came home, there were a number of things that happened. Oh, but I grew up in\na very Orthodox family but I was younger. Now my brother, after his Bar-Mitzvah, he did\nthe tfillin (ph), I guess until he got, until after he got married and I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t. I went to\nHebrew school and I studied. I can read Hebrew today. I don\u2019t know everything \u2014 I can\u2019t\ninterpret it, but I can read it. And I was bar-mitzvahed, but that was it. I was too busy,\nafterwards. I, I followed two sisters who were National Honor Society, and Quill and Scroll\nand all the honors in school and when they heard my name, they said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re Lil\u2019s\nbrother and you\u2019re Bess\u2019s brother.\u201d There\u2019s the two sisters between my oldest brother and\nmyself. \u201cOh!\u201d And they expected me to do everything that they did. And I, during the\nDepression I worked \u2014 worked at the drugstore. And I was just busy \u2014 busy keeping myself\ngoing. It was rather selfish, I presume, but it was difficult being Jewish in a small town. Not\nas difficult as it is now. We only have about 200 souls in St. Joseph. Before the war, there\nwere around 4500. We didn\u2019t become assimilated. We had our own synagogue, of course.\nWe had our own fraternity, sorority \u2014 we had our own groups that we socialized with. Little\nby little, course we couldn\u2019t go to the St. Joseph Country Club, which is a joke that I had on\nthem much later on when I received Alumnus of the Year from my college and the dinner\nwas held at the St. Joseph Country Club. There were many times when I refused to go there\n\u2014 they couldn\u2019t allow Jews as members, they certainly didn\u2019t want us there when we were\nreceiving any kind of honors. It\u2019s all changed now, however. But I wasn\u2019t as, I really wasn\u2019t\nas observant as my dad. I went to the synagogue on holidays with him and when my mother\npassed away I said Koddish (ph) when I could, as many times as I could. Also, I came home,\nthere were times that I received, there was a time when I received a letter from home saying\nthat mother was recuperating before I received a letter saying what was wrong. Mother\u2019d\nhad, had gone to Mayo Clinic for a mastectomy in 19, 1945. And she\u2019d lived to 1954 when it\nhad metastasized. So all this took place. You asked me if I was as observant a Jew. I, I\nthought God had forsaken my people. I really did. I was very angry with Him. How could\nyou let this happen? So I was going to get even. I Just wouldn\u2019t do anything that He wanted\nme to do. What were the prayers? So, they were hollow. Why would He listen to mine when\nHe didn\u2019t listen to their cries. I heard them. I don\u2019t think I really know to this day and that\nwas reinforced because He took my wife away. He, she, the spirit, I don\u2019t know. But I do\nknow this. Though it didn\u2019t happen to me, those who did believe, and today, those who\nbelieve with all their heart and those who believe the way my dad did, had a much easier\ntime of it. For some reason.",
        "A: I never spoke about it \u2014 I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve probably talked more now in these few hours than I\nhave my whole lifetime, since then. Oh, there was a time in Los Angeles, when I was living\nthere, that one of the high school teachers was rewriting history. And he said that this really\ndidn\u2019t happen. He was teaching his classes that all these emaciated bodies were coming from\nCentral Casting. And, course we hear these stories over and over again. And my optometrist,\nat the time, was a survivor \u2014 an emigre, and he was telling me about this. And I told him my\ninvolvement in the DP camps and he asked me if I would work. They were going to set up a\nround robin with survivors and liberators, such as myself, in a church, actually. And it was, I\nthink it was on Wilshire Boulevard, on Pico Boulevard. There was a church that had\nclassrooms and we were going to have a round robin about, well I have all the papers \u2014 we\nwere going to take turns and tell our story over and over and over again. And the classrooms\nthat were bussed in would be in this class and then they would do \u2014 they would go, each one\nof them, in time, would hear the story of about six of us. And incidentally, the Fonz was one\nof them \u2014 Henry Winkler. I think that that was the main attraction for a lot of these kids that\ncame in because, you know, Happy Days was running on the crest of television waves. And I\ngot involved, then, and that\u2019s, that was the change of name. I think you, I was using Joe\nFrederick at the time because when I went into the theater, you couldn\u2019t have a very ethnic-\nsounding name if you wanted to work. In fact, the first man that interviewed me for a job\nsaid that he looked at his calendar and when he saw Joe Friedman, he said, he thought to\nhimself, he said, \u201cEh, another accountant? Another insurance salesman? I have plenty of\ninsurance and I have my own accountant. I don\u2019t need anybody like that.\u201d And he told me\nthis when I went in. He was the director of Love of Life and Secret Storm \u2014 these were soaps\nthat were going on at that time, in New York. And I wanted to work. He says, \u201cYou'll never\nwork under the name of Joe Friedman.\u201d Well, I wanted to keep the same initials. And also, a\nstrange thing happened before I left St. Joe. One of my patients called me Frederick, by\naccident. She called me Dr. Frederick and I thought, gee, what a nice sounding name and it\u2019s\nthe same initial. But I didn\u2019t have to worry about that because there was a dancer in the\nEquity, one of the actors\u2019 union, who was Joe Friedman, and it didn\u2019t matter to him \u2014 he was\na dancer. And so I couldn\u2019t use my name, anyway. \u201cCause you can\u2019t use the same name in\nthe union. Excuse me. So it became Joe Frederick. And that\u2019s how it was when I did this\nround robin. And as a result of that, we were honored at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple in\nLos Angeles when they were, as liberators \u2014 there were several and there all pictures here,\nand I was given a certificate by Vice-President Mondale. And I\u2019m very proud of that. The\nonly other time, in Los Angeles that I spoke of it and, again, I keep referring to the pictures\nthat I have and I left 1t with the museum \u2014 the Ludz (ph) survivors have a very strong club in\nLos Angeles. A very affluent club and they do wonderful work with the survivors. And they\ncalled the Federation in Los Angeles and asked for entertainers for a fundraiser that they\nwere going to have and I was sent to go to this Beverly Hills mansion and entertain. I have a\nlittle act that I do \u2014 I was in Fiddler on the Roof for three years \u2014 I did close to 3,000\nperformances. I was in Las Vegas for four months with it. So I sing, and I, and I do Al\nJolson. I used to go down on my knee, but then when I couldn\u2019t get up one time, I stopped\nthat. At any rate, this Shobby Shoptie (ph) who\u2019s a terrorist from, he\u2019s one of the leading\nexponents of, an Israeli on terrorism. He was the main speaker and I was the entertainment.\nAnd I felt because of the occasion, and because they were all Ludz (ph) people from the,\nfrom the ghetto, that I would tell them a little bit about my experience. And I started talking\nand a lady came up and she threw her arms around me and she said, \u201cYou saved my life. I\nknow who you are. I was in your camp.\u201d That\u2019s what happened. We both had a good cry.\nShe was in my camp. She was on a truck from Koburg (ph) going down to, it was the Funk\nCasairn (ph) \u2014 she told me.",
        "A: Here we have a picture of members of the Palestinian Brigade, who came into my camp,\naround the end of June. They had a list of members of the Palestinian Brigade who fought in\nNorth Africa and ostensibly they wanted to see if there were still relatives of members of the\nBrigade that were alive and living in the Displaced Person Camps and they had legitimate\norders from Third Army Headquarters at Bogtoles (ph) to come into the camps and when\nthey came into mine, I was very happy to see them. And, underneath it all, they were looking\nfor the possibility of the sympathies of the American Jewish officers who might help out\ninforming the links between various camps for Jewish DPs, who were coming out of the\nRussian Occupied Zone of Germany into the American Occupied Zone for a number of\nreasons that we\u2019ve already talked about. So that they could go down to Italy and get on ships\nfor Israel. This is an aerial view of Koburg (ph). Now Koburg (ph) was a tremendous\nGerman army camp. As you can see, all the barracks were built out of brick to last forever.\nUnlike our camps, we built out camps out of wood and plaster, and tore them down right\nafter the war. But Germany had theirs to go on forever. Fortunately, we had these because\nwe knew that we were going to house the displaced persons in these camps after the war\nended. So they did serve a great purpose for us. This is a wonderful Unrah (ph) team that\nwere immeasurable help in Koburg (ph) for me and they\u2019re sort of a polygog of nationalities.\nThe head of the Unrah (ph) team on the extreme left, the man, the balding man, was royalty.\nHe was related to the royals of Belgium. And the one kneeling in front of him was White\nRussian. And she was married to an official of Macy\u2019s in New York and felt that during the\ntime that they escaped from Russia, people helped her family and this was the only way that\nshe could pay back in kind and she joined this Unrah (ph) team \u2014 spoke excellent Russian. In\nfact, she spoke about five different languages. The other members \u2014 there were two doctors,\ntwo nutritionists, a nutritionist for the entire camp, a nutritionist for the hospital, a nurse and\nchauffeurs. And they worked day and night, right along with us, and God bless them. This is\na typical truck that, carrying the displaced persons from Koburg (ph) to Lichtenfelds (ph)\nwhich 1s a railhead, and, as you know, it was a happy time for them until they later learned\nwhat their fate held in store after they got to Russia or to Poland. But nevertheless, they\ndecorated the trucks with leaves and trees and branches and also with pictures of their\nleaders. I don\u2019t know where those pictures came from \u2014 they just appeared out of nowhere\nand were on the trucks. And we saw to it that they plenty of food and clothing and sent\nfamilies back together, quite unlike other trucks that carried out people to crematoria. This is\na photo of Russians and American soldiers, at, at a checkpoint. They were there to see that\nthings were carried out according to our own United States directives and the Russian\ndirectives. At first, they were very, rather shy, the Russians, and not as talkative as our\nAmerican officers, but later on there was quite a symbiotic relationship that developed\nbetween the two. We wanted things from them and they wanted things from us. And\nbetween the two forces we got quite a bit done. Well, that happens to be a picture of me, in\nmy Mercedes. That was a 1936 Mercedes convertible, I think they called it a cabrolay (ph).\nAnd I got it quite legitimately \u2014 we paid for it \u2014 the Germans couldn\u2019t use a lot of their\nvehicles because they couldn\u2019t get gasoline for it. In order for me to be able to draw gasoline\nand to have it serviced at the motor pool, I had to have it painted OD, and had to put the\narmy emblem on it, a white star on it, and I put some fictitious ordinance number on the\nhood of the car. So there you have it, I\u2019m, if the authorities find out at this late date, I'll\nprobably have to go to jail. This obviously is a wedding that was held in Bamburg (ph). I\nwas in Koburg (ph) at the time, and they invited me to come up to Bamburg (ph), because\nthey were people that I had worked with when I was in the camp at Bamburg (ph). The\ngroom is Sergeant Richard Lane and the bride, her name 1s Hettie. I don\u2019t know her last\nname but she was Estonian and she had been a dental assistant and very bright. Her matron\nof honor was also from the, from one of the Baltic countries. And then, I\u2019m, you can see part\nof my head behind her. We were all in the wedding party and it was nice. It was nice to\nknow that life could go on and that some of the institutions that we revered throughout life\ncould take place under these most extreme circumstances. As a footnote to this, many, many\nyears later, I visited Hettie and Bob in San Francisco. They had both gone back to college\nand were very, very happy. A happily married couple. This was an entertainment hall that we\nhad in camp. They had their own musicians. They did requisition musical instruments and I\nhave a whole roster here of what they requisitioned: guitars and violins, accordions \u2014 they all\nplayed accordions and the Bolla Lika (ph). I really thought that before it was all over with,\nI'd be an expert at doing the, the Kuzotzka (ph) or the polka. One of the other, or both. But, I\nenjoyed going to these concerts and they enjoyed having us there because they realized that\nwe were interested in the cultural aspect of their life as well as the necessities, the other\nnecessities of life such as eating, clothing and a roof over their heads. This was a bonus for\nthem. Here I am again. Periodically, of course, I inspected the camp and would see to it that\nthey had enough in the warehouses. We were always, always after enough wood so that we\ncould heat the cauldrons that made the soup which was the mainstay of all the DPs in the\ncamps. We would cut down entire forests in order to get enough wood and here\u2019s an\nexample of how we would stockpile it and store it and just, it was as valuable as gold to us.\nAs we spoke of this before, the camp was run the same way an entire city would be run. And\nthis is the hospital of the camp. Many of the doctors, I should say that the majority of the\ndoctors, were Polish although they, we would, they would answer to American medical,\nmembers in the medical corps of the American army. And they received wonderful\ntreatment. Whatever they requisitioned for the hospitals we were able to get. We would\neither get it from our own medical supply or we would get it from the German medical\nsupplies but whatever had to be done was done. Well this is a Polish doctor. He was a very\nfine man. I had occasion to talk him on a few, a few times that I went over to the hospital and\nof course many of the times when he came into my office to request medical supplies. But he\nwas dedicated and very happy to be able to be a surgeon, to be a doctor again, which he\ncouldn\u2019t do under the German thumb.",
        "A: No I don\u2019t. No, I don\u2019t. I probably have it somewhere, on a requisition. I\u2019d have to go\nthrough the papers. I\u2019m certain that there\u2019s a name on the requisitions. I have, I have a whole\nlist of all the Polish personnel and also I have the emblem that they wore on their jackets that\nI\u2019m gong to give to the museum. This is an interesting story. This gentleman had been a\ncollaborationist. Not in the sense that he collaborated with the Germans, although he might\nhave, but we do know that whatever organization took over the various DP camps, if he had\nbeen a member of the camp, he was able to ingratiate himself into the hierarchy of the camp\nto the extent where he was able to get supplies and whatever the camps needed. But he\nwould also service himself by doing this. He probably worked the black market in cigarettes,\nin candy, in clothing, in liquor and the DPs knew about him. When I became commander of\nthe camp in Koburg (ph), he started this same thing with me. And I was quite ignorant of\nwhat had gone before, and very innocent and he brought a beautiful dagger that he gave to\nme that he had sort of confiscated, I guess, himself and had belonged at one time to the\nForestmeister of the Black Forest, near TreeAir (ph), Germany. I still have that dagger but\nthis gentleman is no longer with us because the night of the day that he gave me this\nsouvenir, he was murdered by other members of the camp.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
