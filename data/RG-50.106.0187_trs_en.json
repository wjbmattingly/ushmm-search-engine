There was three Nazi guys and they took\nthe Jewish people out. We were, our house were on a bank of a street, the driveway was right in\nfront of our house. They lined the Jewish people up on one side and they lined us up on the other\nside. In nightgowns. That\u2019s why it was summer, it wasn\u2019t cold. And they took a machine gun\nand they killed the Jewish people. Right there in front of us. We were not, not supposed to cry or\nhelp them. They said if you get out of line, you get shot. So we all stood frozen in one line.\nAnd then the one guy took a pistol, held to my mom and said I shoot you. And my mom said\nJesus help me. And the guy dropped his gun. I don\u2019t know why he dropped the gun, but he\ndropped it. And he couldn\u2019t shoot it anymore. And then he went, my father said if you want to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nshoot anybody you have to shoot me because I\u2019m the one who got the Jewish people in our\nhouse. So they shot him. They shot him right in front of us. We couldn\u2019t say anything, we\ncouldn\u2019t cry, we couldn\u2019t do nothing. Otherwise we would have been killed too. And then the\nwhistle go up, one guy put a whistle in his mouth. The whistle go off. A truck came and they all\nhad to go on the truck. Except my mom. My mom had to stay there and she went in the air raid\nshelter as a Red Cross nurse. She stayed there for four years. And we had to go. They drove us\nat farms. We had to do farm labor like child labor. At ten years you had to milk five cows in the\nmorning, learn how to drive a tractor. How to plow with horses. We did that all at ten years old.\nFirst I cried. I was miserable. And then I got used to it. And but while we were driving out they\nput gasoline on your house, they put your house on fire. So we lost everything. My mom had to\nfind a room somewhere. And we were at these farms. We are all separated. They put us on four\ndifferent farms. And that now a big truck we went. And you couldn\u2019t escape. There was\nnowhere to escape. So we stayed there and I was there for four years. And I got confirmed there\nyou know. So I learned the good work ethic. That\u2019s where I did learn. You know somebody said\nyou have to go to work 5:00, I would be there 5:00. That\u2019s what I did learn. So then after the\nwar, my mom got a taxi. She went to it\u2019s called the Bergersmeister office. You know who the\nBergermeister is. Bergersmeister office. They had all the papers and she found out there\nwhere we were. And she went in this taxi and picked us all up. No warning. AIl of a sudden she\nwas standing there. You know and I was super glad that I saw her again. And she took around\nand picked up all my sisters. My brother had run away. And my parents said he went to the\nHeights MB [ph], to American Legion. And we have never heard from him again. He went\nthere and he disappeared. So he wanted no part of this. So we don\u2019t know where he went. I\nhave looked on the internet, trying to find him but I can\u2019t find him. He might be dead also, cause\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI\u2019m now you know.

That\u2019s how\nGermany got ruled. If you say anything bad they would come. They picked ministers off the\npulpit and the minister was saying they were picking out all the girl scouts, out of the church.\nThey picked me out too. And we were still on the way out that the minister said that is wrong\nwhat you are doing. Leave those kids in here. They are better with God as with you. They took\nhim off the pulpit and shot him. Right in front of the whole congregation.",

There was three Nazi guys and they took\nthe Jewish people out. We were, our house were on a bank of a street, the driveway was right in\nfront of our house. They lined the Jewish people up on one side and they lined us up on the other\nside. In nightgowns. That\u2019s why it was summer, it wasn\u2019t cold. And they took a machine gun\nand they killed the Jewish people. Right there in front of us. We were not, not supposed to cry or\nhelp them. They said if you get out of line, you get shot. So we all stood frozen in one line.\nAnd then the one guy took a pistol, held to my mom and said I shoot you. And my mom said\nJesus help me. And the guy dropped his gun. I don\u2019t know why he dropped the gun, but he\ndropped it. And he couldn\u2019t shoot it anymore. And then he went, my father said if you want to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nshoot anybody you have to shoot me because I\u2019m the one who got the Jewish people in our\nhouse. So they shot him. They shot him right in front of us. We couldn\u2019t say anything, we\ncouldn\u2019t cry, we couldn\u2019t do nothing. Otherwise we would have been killed too. And then the\nwhistle go up, one guy put a whistle in his mouth. The whistle go off. A truck came and they all\nhad to go on the truck. Except my mom. My mom had to stay there and she went in the air raid\nshelter as a Red Cross nurse. She stayed there for four years. And we had to go. They drove us\nat farms. We had to do farm labor like child labor. At ten years you had to milk five cows in the\nmorning, learn how to drive a tractor. How to plow with horses. We did that all at ten years old.\nFirst I cried. I was miserable. And then I got used to it. And but while we were driving out they\nput gasoline on your house, they put your house on fire. So we lost everything. My mom had to\nfind a room somewhere. And we were at these farms. We are all separated. They put us on four\ndifferent farms. And that now a big truck we went. And you couldn\u2019t escape. There was\nnowhere to escape. So we stayed there and I was there for four years. And I got confirmed there\nyou know. So I learned the good work ethic. That\u2019s where I did learn. You know somebody said\nyou have to go to work 5:00, I would be there 5:00. That\u2019s what I did learn. So then after the\nwar, my mom got a taxi. She went to it\u2019s called the Bergersmeister office. You know who the\nBergermeister is. Bergersmeister office. They had all the papers and she found out there\nwhere we were. And she went in this taxi and picked us all up. No warning. AIl of a sudden she\nwas standing there. You know and I was super glad that I saw her again. And she took around\nand picked up all my sisters. My brother had run away. And my parents said he went to the\nHeights MB [ph], to American Legion. And we have never heard from him again. He went\nthere and he disappeared. So he wanted no part of this. So we don\u2019t know where he went. I\nhave looked on the internet, trying to find him but I can\u2019t find him. He might be dead also, cause\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI\u2019m now you know.

That\u2019s how\nGermany got ruled. If you say anything bad they would come. They picked ministers off the\npulpit and the minister was saying they were picking out all the girl scouts, out of the church.\nThey picked me out too. And we were still on the way out that the minister said that is wrong\nwhat you are doing. Leave those kids in here. They are better with God as with you. They took\nhim off the pulpit and shot him. Right in front of the whole congregation.",
        "A: Yeah. I was still in church.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: So you were afraid of them. We are, they put your living daylight in you.

Women bakers didn\u2019t exist here for a while. So I had to\nwork for one week and I made cookies and doughnuts and breads. After one week they said\nyeah, you have ajob. So I stayed there. I only worked there for a half a year. But I did, I baby\nsat a family at night. And they have moved here to Maryland.

They built a house but one short, one\nbedroom was short. I had to live with the daughter in one bedroom. And that\u2019s what I didn\u2019t\nwant to do. So I went to a bakery in Ellicott City, Frederick\u2019s or whatever it\u2019s called. I went\nthere, they are out of business now. But I went there and I, there in the bakery and I had to ice,\nice cakes. Wedding cakes and birthday cakes. And the girl, who decorated them was sick one\nday. For the whole week. And I had to decorate the cakes. And the people came and said after,\neven after she came back, we want Edith\u2019s cakes. So we had the clash there. So I left. I then\nopened my own bakery. In Aras Anna in Baltimore. And it was a laundry and I cleaned it all\nout and I put a bakery in there and but I couldn\u2019t get any help. Help to, for me. I think I am\nperfectionist.
