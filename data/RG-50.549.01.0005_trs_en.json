        "Question: I'm just going to have you say your name and when you were born.",
        "Answer: Thomas Buergenthal, born in Czechoslovakia -- Lubochnia, Czechoslovakia.\nToday it's Slovakia.",
        "Q: I'm going to speak with you today mostly about the period after the war and\nliberation, but I do have one question about the time that you spent in concentration\ncamp, which is this: at the period when you were still with your mother and father,\ndid they ever sit you down and, in essence, sort of give you advice on how to\nsurvive, try to teach you a survival strategy, or did they themselves know what\nactually might work in that situation?",
        "A: Well, I -- not really in any sort of formal sense, at least, I don't remember it. Of\ncourse, as a child, you probably learn much more from observing than you do from\nbeing told things. But I do remember my father saying -- when we were -- when he\nand I were left alone -- that the one thing that was critical was not to eat food that\nwas dirty or contaminated. That's the only sort of thing I remember because a lot of\npeople would try to eat things out of garbage cans, and then of course get sick. He\nalways warned me about that. Otherwise, I really can't think of them sort of telling\nme \u201cYou should do this or that,\u201d but one of course saw a lot of things that one had to\ndo. I observed my father, who's great strength was that, that you could see that he\nalways thought things out before he did it, and he would not be sort of cowed into\nThomas Buergenthal 2\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 2\nrunning but he would make his decision and then stick by it and that was something\nI noticed, that a lot of people got killed or were caught because they acted too fast.\nThey didn't sort of take account of the environment and then act. That's something\nhe did; he was a master at that.",
        "Q: There was a point where you had been separated from your mother and you were\nable to see your mother briefly, in a concentration camp. Did she say anything at that\npoint, give you any advice?",
        "A: No, but, you know, I think both my father and mother sort of knew that I -- I had sort\nof grown up in the camp. And they probably knew that there wasn't any advice that\nthey could give me that I sort of, that I hadn't already been doing. Really the only\nadvice or the only goal of our life, the long-term goal, was to stay alive, and the\nshort-term goal was to have something to eat that day. And that was -- so survival\nwas the long-term goal. But I really can't remember that they said it, or for that\nmatter that they had to say it. I think they probably knew that I knew what had to be\ndone.",
        "Q: In listening to your testimony that you gave on video tape, I was struck by how you\nwere able to be in a situation and make the best of it, for instance, by becoming an\nerrand boy to one of the German soldiers or to a Kapo; or later, right around\nliberation, you became a mascot to a group of Polish soldiers, and every time there\nyou are 1n those situations. How did you end up in those situations?\nThomas Buergenthal 3\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 3",
        "A: You know, it's hard to say. I've never thought about it, but as I said, I'd grown up in\nthe camp and it seemed that sort of the -- that there were certain things you had to do\nin order to be able to survive, and in order to be in the position where you could\nsurvive, and those things sort of came naturally. I don't know, I must say I've never\nthought about it. The mascot part -- this was after liberation -- there that was really\nnot planned at all or\u2014because what happened was that I was liberated and we met\nthese Polish soldiers and they knew that I spoke Polish, and they thought I was\nPolish, and they took me with them. And then sort of the mascot part came naturally.\nSo I can't claim any credit for having known what I was doing, at that stage.",
        "Q: You say that you grew up in the camps, and certainly, when your life was disrupted,\nyou were about five I believe -- and then, you were about ten I believe -- and correct\nme if I'm wrong, when the last place you were was liberated. How did you grow up,\nwhat happened to you, who was the little boy when your life was disrupted, and who\nwas that boy or boy adult when the camps were liberated?",
        "A: Well, we, of course, were already on the run from 1939 on, and I remember very\nlittle from that period. I was born in 1934, so in '39 I was five years old. I was a\nscared little boy, that's all I remember. I remember our crossing the border from\nCzechoslovakia into Poland and worrying that something would happen to my father\nand knowing my father and mother were very worried about what was going to\nhappen; being fascinated by some of the new languages I heard -- Yiddish for the\nThomas Buergenthal 4\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 4\nfirst time in my life in Poland. Really, I didn't start sort of facing the reality of the\nwar and what it meant, and sort of the reality of trying to survive, until probably\n1943, because in the ghetto still, when we survived the first in 1942, when they,\nwhen they dissolved the ghetto and sent most of the people to Treblinka.",
        "Q: This is in Kielce?",
        "A: This is in Kielce, in Poland. I was still very much sort of part -- I would do what my\nparents wanted me to do and I would be the child that did what had to be done. And\nin '43 I sort of began to be aware that I had to -- even though I was still with my\nparents -- that I had to do certain things on my own in order to survive. And then, of\ncourse, when I was left --",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Such as, well, for example, when we were in 1943, we were in a work camp, and\nwhen that camp was dissolved, the initial thing was that I had to hide in order not to\nbe seen by the Gestapo because they were taking all of the children away. And then\nwhat happened, I actually survived this: they saw me of course, we were all lined up\non one of these fields in Kielce, and they start pulling me, and my father pulled me\nback. And then my father took me to the chief of the Gestapo, who was standing in\nfront of everybody, and said to him, \"This is my son.\" And this man looked at me,\nand I said to him, in German, \"I can work.\" And, you know, it just came out of me.\nHow do you say it in German? \u201cIch kann arbeiten\u2019\u2019? And his response in German\nThomas Buergenthal 5\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 5\nwas \"Na, das wollen wir mal sehen\u201d -- \u201c\u201cLet\u2019s see\u201d -- and he let me live. This was -- I\nwas the only one of the children from that -- from Kielce who survived that way.\nThere were two others who hid in the house where they took all of the children. And\nthat was sort of the beginning of my awakening to the fact that I was going to have\nto save my own life.",
        "Q: And in that case, instead of running away or trying not to be noticed, you went right\ninto the belly of the beast. You went right face-to-face with the danger.",
        "A: Well, that, in part, that was really my father's doing, who, who, who had sort of\nanalyzed the Germans and knew that you had to often confront them in certain ways\nand that they had great, sort of, difficulty with their own propaganda and with the\nreality. Here was a kid who spoke German the way their own children spoke\nGerman, who didn't look as Jewish as they perceived Jews to look from Der\nStuirmer, which was the German sort of propaganda newspaper. And suddenly to\nhave this kid talk to them, it personalized it. And I think this was my father's -- he\nsort of contributed to my doing what I did. He must have said himself, \"You have\nto.\" Maybe he -- I don't remember, maybe he said, \"You have to tell them you can\nwork.\" It could well be, but it worked. And after that, in Auschwitz again, the first\ntime, when I worked for the Kapo that, the Kapo was somebody my father had\nknown before, because it was a man who had been in the ghetto with us in Kielce\nand was shipped out of the ghetto to Auschwitz two years before we did. So, by the\nThomas Buergenthal 6\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 6\ntime we came to Auschwitz, he was a Kapo -- quite a brutal one. But he treated his\nfriends well, and he sort of took me in. It was a terrible sort of society, to live. But\nthat helped. I also -- in Kielce still, I worked as an errand boy for the man who ran\nthat work camp, and I must -- I don't know how that came about. But what I\nremember -- I don't know whether I told it on tape, I probably did -- I used to sit\noutside his office and he would listen to the radio and I would listen, and would sort\nof report to my parents on the news because we had no news, of course. So I became\nthe one who tried to memorize all the news that I heard on the German radio, and\nreport it to my father and mother and I suppose through them, to the other people in\nthe camp. I even reported on the fact that Mussolini had been captured and they\ndidn't believe me -- of course they thought this kid is imagining things.",
        "Q: At that point, a young boy, you might have felt angry or even intense hatred for the\nGermans. What was it like to work for one, one-on-one as an errand boy, and how\ndid you cope with that?",
        "A: You know, I didn't have to cope at all, that's the curious thing. He was a very, he was\nvery nice to me. He never mistreated me. But he was quite brutal. He would beat\npeople if he saw them not working. And so I figured out he would do that and so\nwhen he made his inspection tours, I would just really sort of run ahead and make\ncertain motions. He had a hat with a feather and I would motion to people that the\nfeather was coming so everybody started to work, so -- because I had seen him beat\nThomas Buergenthal 7\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 7\na lot of people if he caught them not working. But he wasn't, he wasn't, never abused\nme, never mistreated me. That's strange, you know, as a child I remember he used to\nhave a visit from some officer of the SS who would arrive with a bicycle, and he\nwould hand me the bicycle, to take the bicycle and put it in the bicycle stand. And\nbelieve it or not, in all this environment in which we lived, I learned to ride the bike\nwith this SS man's bicycle. You know, a child 1s a child.",
        "Q: And you weren't afraid to do that that they might come out of the tent and see you\nplaying with the bike?",
        "A: I must say, I thought about it, but then I figured when he told me to take it and as\nlong as I didn't break it, I was all right. You know, the fear factor was not -- the fear\nfactor was one of survival and not of sort of what could happen in between for doing\nthis or doing that. Because I really, when I think back, I was not afraid and not\nbecause I'm not a person who's not afraid, but because it just didn't seem there was\nany reason to be afraid. There were many reasons in the camp to be afraid, but not to\nthese sort of episodes. I was describing to my class -- they asked me the other day --\nI remember breaking in with a friend of mine in Auschwitz and in the kitchen of the\nSS and stealing milk, which was the first milk I had drunk, we had a cup of milk in\ntwo years. And if we had been caught we would have been beaten to death, but it\nsort of: there was the milk and we had to drink it.",
        "Q: Were you ever afraid that you yourself would just arbitrarily get beaten, or perhaps\nThomas Buergenthal 8\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 8\nbe chosen to go into the crematorium? After all, you saw this happen often, every\nday. Did you imagine that happening to you?",
        "A: Well, first of all, beaten. You know, one got beaten because one pushed in the\nfood line, and then they swung the stick and I was beaten on my back, but nothing\nreally very serious. No, the fact that one thought, that I thought I would die in there,\nthat was a reality. And it happened quite a number of times, where the risk existed\nand I knew exactly what was going to happen. As a matter of fact, I was in situations\nwhere I thought I was finished, there was no way out. No, that fear, and that fear was\ntremendous. Until, you know, once I hit a moment when I realized there was nothing\nmore to do, I couldn't escape anymore, and suddenly a tremendous peace came over\nme, I thought I was going to die. I had done everything possible not to get caught\nand there was no escape, and I sort of made peace with myself and with death at that\npoint. But it didn't last very long. You know, the survival instinct comes right back.",
        "Q: Let's move on now to the point at liberation, and if you can, just situate us. Where\nwere you, how old were you, and what kind of physical state were you 1n?",
        "A: I was at liberation, in the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen which is about 20\nkilometers outside of Berlin. And by that time I had survived the death march but\nlost -- I had frostbite, and was operated actually, in an infirmary of Sachsenhausen.\nThey had sort of a hospital set up, because it was one of these model camps,\ndemonstration camps, where they would keep people and could show that they were\nThomas Buergenthal 9\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 9\nactually treating people well, but at the same time would execute people and do\neverything else. But it was a model camp, and I was there. I had two toes amputated.\nAnd then when the war was coming to a close, the Germans decided to evacuate the\ncamp. But those of us who couldn't really walk very much, and some people were\nmuch sicker than I, we were left behind in the hospital. And the assumption was that\nthey were going to come and shoot all of us; this was sort of, we all expected that\nwas going to happen. I was able to move. I had a crutch or a cane or something, so I\nthink I was operated maybe three weeks before, or so. It was strange, after the\nevacuation of the camp, it was very strange but it was very quiet. And then you\nbegin to hear artillery fire coming closer. And I think I went to sleep, evacuation\nmust have been the day before. The next morning I got up and it was very, very\nquiet except for the shooting coming closer. I crawled out, went out and looked up\nand saw in the entrance of the camp, over the entrance on the inside -- they always\nhad a machine gun mounted with SS guards sitting on, and there was nobody there,\nthe machine gun was empty. I came back and told people. Of course, nobody\nbelieved that this was happening. And then we just waited and the shooting came\ncloser. Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in\nthe early afternoon -- we heard the gong, the camp had a big bell in the middle of\nthis field, and a Russian soldier had driven in with a jeep and was ringing the bell\nsaying, \u201cYou're free.\u201d\nThomas Buergenthal 10\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 10",
        "Q: In what language?",
        "A: I don't really know. It must have been in Russian, but Russian and Polish 1s\nrelatively close. And the instructions were that we were free, we could go anyplace\nwe wanted except not this way because that's where the Germans still were, so you\ngo the other way. And the first thing that we did was to storm the place with the SS\nkept their supplies. And people, of course, these were all people who were quite sick\nand everybody dragged themselves to the supply place and people began to eat. It\nwas very lucky for me that I couldn't eat. I remember finding a pickle. There was\nbread and everything else and all I could eat was a pickle. It probably saved my life\nbecause a lot of people ate and not having eaten for a long time, just gorged\nthemselves and got quite sick and many of them died. I didn't. I just couldn't\nswallow. And then sort of a day later, there was a young Pole, must have been in his\nearly 20s and I\u2014we -- decided we were going to leave. So we just went out on the\nroad and started moving, then we were joined by some other people, there were\nsome women, also from -- I don't know where they came, but Polish women. And\nwe -- the houses -- this was the city of where the camp is, Sachsenhausen, 1s\nOranienberg, and we must have been in the area of that, moving away from Berlin.\nThe German houses were standing empty because the Germans had fled, and often\ntimes the tables were still set, dirty dishes were sitting, and you could just occupy a\nhouse and we just moved from one house to the other, until these Polish soldiers\nThomas Buergenthal 11\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 11\ncame and started talking, they talked to the women, of course. And then they saw me\nand they said, \"Where are you going?\" I said that I didn't know where I was going, I\nwas trying to find my parents. And they said, \"Well where they would be?\" And I\nsaid, \"They would probably be in Poland,\" and so they took me with them.",
        "Q: Let's go back a couple steps. I'm curious about what else the Russian said, what was\nthat scene, like when the Russian soldier gonged the bell. Did people come out and\nstand around, then did you guys hug each other? Was there a feeling that you were\nreally liberated at that point, or did that come a little bit later?",
        "A: You know when I see pictures of people who are liberated by American troops, by\nBritish troops, they were liberated. We were none of these scenes as far as I\nremember. The Russians just told us, \"You can go.\" There was no effort made to\nhelp us in any way, to provide any medical services, and there was no hugging. I\ndon't remember, I mean we felt a great sense of relief because we expected to be\nshot, but none of that -- 1t was probably too, in retrospect, it was almost too much. It\nwas hard to believe that we were free after all this and that nothing had happened to\nus. No, I don't remember these scenes of liberation. I really don't remember even\nrealizing that I was liberated until the war was over because everybody started\nshooting into the air, and it came, sort of, on my birthday. But I didn't have any sense\nof the tremendous joy that other people must have experienced. I was alone in many\nways. I think that if my parents had been there it would have been different.\nThomas Buergenthal 12\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 12",
        "Q: And when you had hooked up with the young Polish boy and you were moving\naround in the town outside of Sachsenhausen, did you feel frightened that Germans\ncould come up and recapture you, perhaps? What was the mood like, or were you\njust sitting back with your feet up on the table in these homes and having a nice\ntime?",
        "A: Well, where we were afraid, of course, was when we were still in the camp because\nwe didn't know what happened to the Germans, whether they would come back and\nwhether it was really true that they had left. But once we were out, I don't remember\nworrying about it. It seemed that it was over, and the fact that the Germans had just\ndisappeared without a trace, the soldiers, must have had that impact. But I just don't\nremember that maybe as a child you're liberated, you're free. No, I had no sense that\nthere was any danger from the Germans at that point. Of course, I then ended up,\nwhen I was a mascot, in the battle of Berlin, and that was quite -- there was a really\nalmost hand-to-hand combat and there it was quite dangerous.",
        "Q: Tell us about that. First you met some soldiers from the Polish army, tell us about\nthat. How did you meet them and then what happened?",
        "A: Well, they came to one of these houses, and I must say, it's hard for me to sort of\nremember very clearly, how it came about that they took me with them. But they\ndid. They were members of the First Polish Division, the so-called Kosciusko\nThomas Buergenthal 13\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 13\nDivision,\u2019 which had come from Russia. These were people apparently who had\nbeen, at least the officers, members of the Polish army in '39 who were then shipped\nto Siberia. And when the Russians needed troops, they were brought back and given\na chance to fight in the Polish army under Russian control. And I, so this was the\ngroup and I was in. The soldiers who took me in, they were members of the scout\ncompany, so we were sort of the forefront of the division. They took me in. They\ngave me -- they made me a small uniform and I had shoes. They even gave me a\nsmall revolver, another revolver -- a automatic pistol. They had found a circus horse\nsome place, a pony, and -- because much of the army was still horse-drawn. They\nhad supplies of the Russian and Polish army -- was still brought in by horse-drawn\ncarts. There was a lot of horses, and I had my horse and I could keep up with the\nsoldiers, and I had a wonderful time. One of the things I remember doing -- this was\na great sort of past time at that point, this shows you how children are children --\nshooting at things that I don't know whether people still know what that is -- the\nelectric wires and telegraph on poles are held up, wired around porcelain, white\nporcelain sort of, what would you call it, cups or -- . The big game was to shoot at\nthose things and shoot them down because, of course -- that was one of the pastimes\nI engaged in with my Polish soldiers. And also I learned, the one of the people who\n' The Taduesz Kosciusko Division, a soldiery comprised of Polish patriots under\nRussian command, appeared in July 1943.\nThomas Buergenthal 14\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 14\ntook care of me was a shoemaker for the company, another one was a tailor. And I\nthink -- I don't know whether I could still make a pair of shoes, but I actually\nobserved how you make shoes and I helped and I probably at one point could have\nmade a pair of shoes from scratch.",
        "Q: So here you are, you're a little boy, probably less than six weeks ago you had been\non a death march out of Auschwitz and all of a sudden you're dressed, you have a\nuniform, and you're riding a miniature pony with Polish army division.",
        "A: It's -- when you think about it, it reads like, sounds like, a novel from Garcia\nMarquez,\u201d but it's true. And it, the strange thing is that the sort of, the absurdity of it,\nthe comic aspect of it never occurred to me as a child. Its -- you know, at the same\ntime, all of this I thought was going to lead to my being reunited with my parents,\nand I never even thought that this wasn't going to happen, this was all part of a\nprocess. In the meantime I could eat and I no longer had to be afraid and I had fun. I\nhad a horse. Actually, on the food, I should tell you that I, since I had no appetite and\nthe Poles were quite concerned that I couldn't eat, they started giving me, at first, a\nhalf a spoon of vodka, then a spoon of vodka, and that stimulated my appetite at the\npoint where I could really keep up with them to drinking vodka because it was my\nmedicine. That was sort of the only lingering thing that had survived from the camp.\nWell, of course, I had -- -my amputation was still\u2014I had to change bandages. I did\nThomas Buergenthal 15\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 15\nall of that myself. I don\u2019t even remember ever being taken to a doctor when I was\nliberated.",
        "Q: Tell us more about the eating. What could you eat, and how did that gradually\nchange? Was there some food that was more comforting than others, or when you\nwere able to be around larger amounts of food, perhaps with the Poles, the Polish\narmy division, were there some types of foods that you began to really want to have\nan appetite for?",
        "A: No.\n[end of side one of tape one|\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: What I remember was the Poles would drink a lot of vodka, eat bread and smoked\nbacon with it. And that\u2019s the sort of food I remember eating\u2014a lot of bread, and\nbread, of course, I could eat, although I really didn\u2019t have much appetite. But with\nthe vodka, I ate and drank whatever they did, and I remember a lot of bacon, that the\npoles usually drink this with vodka. But there must have been other food, I just don't\nhave any memory. The only thing I remember is that when we stormed that place in\nSachsenhausen, still, that all I could eat was a pickle, and I hadn't eaten a pickle for a\n* Garcia Marquez, Gabriel Jos\u00e9 (1928-), author.\nThomas Buergenthal 16\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 16\nlong, long time.",
        "Q: Did it bother you that you had been deprived of food for so long? You must have\nfantasized about food or talked about it, and then you could finally eat more freely,\nand you weren't hungry?",
        "A: No, that never occurred to me. It occurs to me now when I know I shouldn't eat and I\nhave what I -- so now it's much more real. Now so often I think, oh here's all this\nfood that I could eat and as a child I was starving and couldn't eat it and now I'm not\nallowed to eat it or shouldn't eat it. But no, I didn't, and I think it has a lot to do with\nhaving, being a child and taking a lot of these things for granted. This was life and\nthis is what happened. One day you don't have anything to eat and the next day\nthere's suddenly food. But I remember though, for years afterwards, would always\nthink that you should always eat before you did anything of importance because you\nnever knew when you were going to eat again.",
        "Q: Did you find when you were younger, that you ate quickly, as if someone might take\nthe food away from you?",
        "A: That could be because I still eat quickly, probably too quickly. I don't know whether\nit's related to that or not. There were certain foods that, you know, bread of course,\nto this day good bread is something that I -- I always use the example that when I\nhear the word bread in German or Polish, I can smell it. It has sort of an emotion\nattached to it, whereas the English word for bread is a word that I learned, it's an\nThomas Buergenthal 17\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 17\nintellectual, is an intellectual concept, but it doesn't have all the emotion tied up with\nthe words chleb,* or the word Brot* in German, which was all of the things that I was\ndeprived of and that I needed the most. The one thing that I thought I would never\neat again would be turnips because we used to get turnip soup in Auschwitz, with a\nlittle piece of bread which was often the only meal we had. But now I find that even\nwell done turnip quite good.",
        "Q: Can the smell of it or the taste of it, does it bring back memory flashes?",
        "A: Not anymore. But good bread still brings back sort of feeling of how wonderful it is\nto be able to have this, which I didn't have because we really lived on bread. It was\nthe most important thing, and to this day, I really can't get myself to throw away\nbread. Stale bread is something that I find all kinds of excuses to let somebody else\nthrow it away.",
        "Q: That's interesting. So instead of resenting or hating the bread because it's all you had,\nyou actually sort of cherish it.",
        "A: Oh, yes, very much so. The turnips I hated.",
        "Q: Does your family recognize that about you, the kind of attachment to bread, and will\nthey tease you about it or even get a little frustrated with you: \u201cWhy are you holding\nonto these bread crusts?\u201d\n> Bread (Polish).\n* Bread (German).\nThomas Buergenthal 18\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 18",
        "A: No. The problem is that, of course, they know that for some reason, it must be poetic\njustice, that bread has the worst weight-gaining effect on me, and so I'm not really\nsupposed to eat it. I eat hardly any bread except for when I'm in Europe where my\ndiscipline goes. And they know that. Actually bread and sausages, which, of course,\nI can't eat because I had a bypass a few years ago. All of the things that I missed as a\nchild I can't eat now. It's a small price to pay for survival.",
        "Q: Can you tell us now about being a young boy just liberated from Sachsenhausen and\nyou have hooked up with this group of Polish soldiers? War is not over and you are\nwith them and you go essentially into military situations with them. Tell us about\nthat.",
        "A: Well, the first real military situation I got into was, I helped liberate Berlin. We came\ninto Berlin while the battle for Berlin was still raging and we were camped in the\npark near where the rocket artillery that the Russians had. We're shooting over at the\nGermans and the Germans were shooting back. And I slept in an armored car\nbecause there was still fighting going on, and as we drove into Berlin, you could see\nthere were Russian soldiers, dead soldiers on one side, Germans on the other. The\nbattle was still raging for about two days. But then of course, the Germans\nsurrendered and we actually took German prisoners at the end of the -- when Berlin\nfell. But during the battle, you know, people got killed. That was a danger that\nsomebody could get killed. Actually some people from our company who had\nThomas Buergenthal 19\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 19\nventured out on the street in the truck, the hand grenade was thrown -- because the\nGermans were still occupying the houses -- but nothing happened to me. I didn't\nparticipate in any of the fighting, I didn't shoot either. But we were counting because\nthese rocket-propelled grenades that the Russians had, the Kosciusko would shoot\nout, sort of, six or 12 at the same time, and they were supposed to be moving\nbecause you can very easily locate them. And we were concerned. I remember the\nPolish saying that they really should be moving because the Germans could find\nwhere they were and then start bombarding us and them. But the Germans, at that\npoint, German artillery was no longer very effective and nothing happened.",
        "Q: Were you frightened at that point and you wished that you had not hooked up with\nthese Polish soldiers?",
        "A: Oh, no, I didn't wish that I hadn't hooked up, but I'm sure I was frightened, naturally,\nyeah. It's a long time ago, when you think this is in 1945, late April, beginning of\nMay of 1945; it's a long time. But I remember the concerns that we all had about\nGerman artillery hitting us.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to see the German soldiers brought into custody, taken\nprisoners? What were your feelings toward them? Did you feel like you wanted to\ngo up and say something to them about what you had experienced yourself?",
        "A: Well, I was delighted obviously, that they were prisoners of war and we were being\nguarded. I don't remember, first of all, I don't remember any of the Poles attacking\nThomas Buergenthal 20\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 20\nany of the German prisoners, and I don't remember having that feeling. I remember\nhaving that feeling very much when I came back and I was reunited with my mother\nin Germany and seeing -- we had a balcony in that town, my mother's home town in\nGermany, in Gottingen -- and sitting on the balcony on a Sunday and seeing the\nGerman families taking a walk and my father hadn't come back. And at that point,\nyou know, the desire of sort of seeing -- when I first came back I would love to\nmount the machine gun on that balcony and shoot all of them. But if I think back in\nBerlin of the German prisoners we took, I didn't have that feeling for some strange\nreason. It may have been too distant or... I remember there were negotiations going\non for the surrender of the Germans, and at one point it looked there was some\ndanger because there was a whole forest full of Germans as we were moving back\nand our company was quite exposed but the Germans wanted to surrender. And\nthese negotiations went on all night and I slept through the whole thing and when I\nwoke up in the morning, most of the German officers had merely negotiated in order\nto be able to escape. That's also I remember from that episode.",
        "Q: Did you talk at all about what you had just went through or did you plunge yourself\ninto this new life? Did anyone say, \"What was it like for you to be in one of these\nconcentration camps?\" Was anybody talking to you about that at that point or did\nyou feel a need, a desire to talk about it?",
        "A: No, actually I don't think anybody was talking about it because, of course, these\nThomas Buergenthal 21\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 21\npeople had come out of a Russian concentration camp, they had gone through the\nentire war, they knew what it was all about. If people talked about anything 1t would\nbe always to say, \u201cWhere are you from? \u201cWhere are your parents? \u201cWhat did you\ndo?\u201d There I always had to be very careful because I didn't want -- first of all, I\nwasn't sure it was a good idea to say that I was Jewish, and second I didn't think that\nit was a good idea to say I was born in Czechoslovakia, so they just assumed that I\nwas Polish. And so I sort of structured my own story that I came from Kielce, which\nwas the ghetto where we had been, and that I expected to find my parents back in\nKielce. That was sort of the extent of that conversation, but I must say, I don't\nremember very much of that period. It's strange; I have memories, sort of episodic\nmemory, but not chronological memory. So that I, if you say, \"Well what did you do\nthen and what did you do then,\" it's often that I just simply don't remember.",
        "Q: Actually something you just said raises a question. Did you feel Jewish and if so,\nhow so? I mean, had you been able to in any way affirm your identity as a Jew in\nthis period or were you really too little to have been given that by your parents?",
        "A: No, I felt very much that I was Jewish but it's strange, my family was not a religious\nfamily at all. I had no religious education at all. Religion and Judaism became part of\nsurvival for me and I think that was part of what my father, my family brought me\nup. The Germans wanted to kill us because we were Jews and we were going to win\nthis battle with them as Jews and we were going to survive. And so the Judaism that\nThomas Buergenthal 22\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 22\nwas instilled in me was the Judaism that said that we were going to win over the\nGermans, we're not going to let them kill us and we were going to be proud of the\nfact that we can survive. I remember my father always saying, \"We are going to be\nalive long after they are six feet under.\" So in that sense, Judaism, the fact that we\nwere different, was part of the thing that helped us live. That was very strongly\ninstilled in me. But never religious, never from a religious point of view. But my\nfather was very much, very strong as a believer the fact that he was a Jew, but not a\nreligious Jew at all, neither was my mother.",
        "Q: What happens after the Polish army division pulls back from the battle of Berlin?\nWhat happens to you? What is going on at that point?",
        "A: Well, we pull out of Berlin, eventually we are put on trains, again on trains, end up\nin an army camp in Poland, in a town called Siedlce, sort of a military garrison\nwhere I stay, I don't know really how long, it must have been a few weeks. But one\nof the Jewish soldiers from that company, who knew that I was Jewish and with\nwhom I spoke, then takes me to a Jewish orphanage in Otwock, near Warsaw, which\nshows you that I hid my Judaism one way but as far as the Jewish soldier and I were\nconcerned, I knew that I was Jewish and he knew that I was Jewish. And he took me\nto this orphanage where I stayed for a good year until I found my mother.",
        "Q: Were you sad to be taken away from the army garrison?",
        "A: Oh, in some ways, yes, because I have this sort of wonderful military life. Yes and\nThomas Buergenthal 23\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 23\nno. I -- again, you know, the strange thing is, 1s you ask these questions. Part of my\nlife or the way I used to think was that these things happened -- and you didn't spend\nmuch time thinking about them, very little introspection about events. You -- like,\nit's sort of like swimming. You're downstream, this is part of what has to be done. It\nnever occurred to me that I shouldn't leave. He said it was a good idea to go to the\norphanage and I went with him. The orphanage was actually, a lot of it was quite\nnice. Orphanages sound terrible but this one was where we were treated quite well.\nThat point is when I began to think that I would find my parents. Again you know,\nas a child there was a strong belief that I would find my parents.",
        "Q: Describe arriving at the orphanage. What did it look like? What did you look like?\nWere you in your little military uniform at that point?",
        "A: You know, I should have brought a picture. I still have a picture of my military\nuniform with this Polish soldier who eventually I think went to Israel. I must have\nbecause I had nothing else, so I must have arrived that way. I don't really remember\nthe arrival part but I do remember that I was sort of -- and that made it easier. I was\nthe only one there who had been in the camps. All the other kids had been hidden\nsome place or had come from Russia or some place. So I was sort of an oddity and\nthere was a lot of people asking questions, how was this. And the treatment was\nwonderful. I was still very thin and underweight and the cook in this place always\nmade sure I would get a whole cupful or a soup bowl of cream so that I could gain\nThomas Buergenthal 24\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 24\nsome weight. I don't think that was such a good idea in retrospect. And eggs, you\nknow, all of the things that I don't remember having. And of course the orphanage\nwas interesting because the orphanage was divided into sort of two types of kids.\nAnd, there were the real orphans, and I was considered one of the real orphans,\nwithout a mother and a father, and we were the tough kids. Then there were what we\nconsidered the weaklings because they had one parent but for some reason they were\nthere. And, I was the youngest of that group and was treated extremely well, had a\nlot of fun, played games. And again, sort of, unthinking about what the future was\ngoing to hold and always believing without really doubting it, questioning it, that\nsooner or later I would find my parents.",
        "Q: When you describe yourself being in the group of the tough orphans, it sounds like\nwhen you were young, when you were ten and just coming out of the concentration\ncamp, there was almost a certain amount of pride, that you had survived and that you\ncould handle yourself in these situations. Almost kind of the feelings of a young man\nand after all you were still a little boy.",
        "A: No, I think that was very true. I think that was in part because I saw, and because of\nmy parents, I saw the fact that I survived as a victory, that we had won over them.\nThey wanted to kill us and we made it; we didn't give them the joy of killing us. So\nthere was a tremendous sense of satisfaction, that of survival, unlike what one reads\nnow that people supposedly feel bad that they survived and others didn't. We never\nThomas Buergenthal 25\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 25\nhad that feeling and neither did my mother because my mother survived. I mean we\nfelt very bad that, for example, my father didn't survive. He died just shortly before\nthe end of the war. But we never felt that guilty about the fact of surviving, on the\ncontrary. We were, it was a sense of satisfaction that we had survived. Really it was\na sense of victory, that we didn't let them kill us.",
        "Q: That's an interesting thought, I'm not sure I've really heard that before.",
        "A: I've never heard it. All I read about is people feeling guilty that they survived. I\nmean I can understand that, I can understand it in some ways, other ways I can't\nunderstand that. If you survive, honestly there's no reason you should feel guilty and\nwe certainly didn't. And really the people that I know from the camps never had that\nfeeling.",
        "Q: You said that you played games at the orphanage. What kind of games, and what\nwas that like for you? After all you'd been working, you'd been an errand boy, you'd\nbeen a mascot to an army division. What was that like for you to have your day\nfilled with eating a lot of food and playing?",
        "A: It was wonderful. You know the strange thing is when I think back, here I had my\ntoes amputated and I played soccer. I played a lot of soccer, and I had the great\nadvantage because of my amputation I could also shoot with my left foot, so I was\none of the few kids who could shoot left and right. It -- the transition wasn't difficult\nat all. It was an easy transition. It would have been much harder the other way\nThomas Buergenthal 26\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 26\naround. That is, I think, an important thing. That I, if you were my age, the post\nsurvival period and the adjustment and the survival period was all much easier\nbecause in the camp I never thought like other people must have, my parents, how\nwonderful it was to eat a good meal or anything of that sort. And missing all of the\nconveniences that one had, I couldn't take it today. I've often thought that I couldn't\nsurvive today. But as a child, from my point of view, things got bad but then they\ngot so much better. And, I never thought back that there was any -- it came naturally\nand I didn't think about it.",
        "Q: How much did people ask you about what your life had been like, for instance, in\nAuschwitz, and did you have a feeling that they were trying to find out information\nperhaps for later, for war crime trials or perhaps just to comfort you, to see if you'd\nexperienced any trauma?",
        "A: Well, in the orphanage, since I was the only one there who had been in the camps,\nthe people from newspapers and newsreels would come, and I was sort of a minor\ncelebrity. Whenever people would come to the orphanage I would be trotted out to\nask questions. But not because they wanted to comfort me or anything, it was just\nsomebody -- if they wanted to talk about the orphanage, this was an example.\nActually, you probably know that there was a book written, a diary in the camp, the\nman who wrote that diary and the excerpts from the diary, the parts that deal with\nme, he asked a lot of those questions. And when he describes interviewing me in the\nThomas Buergenthal 27\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 27\nhospital about Auschwitz, he was struck by the fact that it was all sort of reported in\nthe matter of fact way. I -- it's still like this to this day, I think in part because of my\nage or maybe I'm just totally insensitive to the experience but not very introspective\nabout it.",
        "Q: You were speaking about the Norwegian Odd Nansen. Actually he described you as\na very beautiful young boy\u2014\u2018pre-Raphaelite\u201d is how he described you -- and he\nsaid that the only way he saw any anxiety was in your hands and that you had the\nhands of an old man.",
        "A: And now I do. No -- and he described them as very nervous hands and I suppose\nthey still are probably to some extent. No, he was the only one in the camp that I\nremember asking me about things. And I was even -- I sort of thought, how strange\nthat somebody would ask me about these things since we were all living it and there\nwas nothing very unusual about it.",
        "Q: And in fact, he was living it also but what struck him was that you were such a little\nboy and that you might have walked with a canister of gas to the crematorium.",
        "A: Yes, of course, to me that was nothing very unusual or extraordinary, and to him it\nwas very different. He was a wonderful man and one of the few diaries written in the\ncamp on a day-to-day basis. I met him after the war. I found him after the war and\nwe stayed in touch until he died. He actually saved my life in many ways. And I'm\nstill in touch, whenever I'm in Norway, his son and I get together. Actually we were\nThomas Buergenthal 28\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 28\ntogether last year.",
        "Q: You say that often you describe things in a matter-of-fact way. I wonder though that\nkind of being around death all the time -- you've just described a little bit ago about\nseeing the Russian soldiers and the German soldiers and you must have seen many\nbodies in the camps. Is that something that became matter of fact for you also?",
        "A: Yes. Without necessarily saying that it was matter-of-fact in a way that you just\ndon't notice it. It was -- the death and seeing death in the camp and seeing people\ndying could not but affect one in the camp. But again as part of the self-defense\nmechanism, you tried not to think about it, you tried not to see it. Although, you\nknow, it's strange, I can talk about my experience in the camp, I can write about it. I\ncan't see movies about it. I can't read. A lot of things they affect me tremendously,\nincreasingly so. And I think in part because I must have sort of suppressed a lot of\nthings that come out now. But I'm struck by the fact how much more, how difficult\ncertain things are for me today than they were even 20 years ago. I, when I just even\nsee a snippet of a movie, say Schindler's List, they would show something on\ntelevision, I would break down. Despite the fact that I give the impression that\nnothing phases me, that I just simply can't take. For example certain Jewish music,\nreligious music, brings back memories of the camp that are very difficult for me, for\nexample, a ceremony at the Holocaust Museum, to stay without breaking down.\nEnd of Tape 1.\nThomas Buergenthal 29\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 29\nThomas Buergenthal 30\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 30\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: Have you ever been to the Holocaust Museum?",
        "A: Well, actually I've not been able. I haven't had the courage to walk through. I've been\nthere, I've given a talk, I've been in the auditorium, but I haven't been able to do it. I\nprobably will one of these days and I want to take my children. But I just, I don't\nhave the courage. It took me, well I didn't go back to Auschwitz until '92, first time I\nwent to Auschwitz. Actually, it worked out it was much easier than I thought it\nwould be. It was much harder going back to Kielce where I had been in the ghetto.\nI'll have to go the Holocaust Museum, obviously, but I'm afraid of it. That's the\nsame, I haven't been in the Yad Vashem even though I was in Israel and I could have\ngone, emotionally I'm just afraid.",
        "Q: Can you tell us what it was like to go back to Kielce, that is, where you were in the\nwork camp and then there was the massacre? That was where you were in the ghetto\nand then there was the massacre that you survived there.",
        "A: Well, the strange thing is that what we did, my wife and I, decided to sort of go back\nto my roots and we actually went back to the place where I was born and we drove\naround. And she would record, she would ask me questions and I would tell her\nabout things. As we were driving into Kielce, I suddenly remembered the address of\nthe house and the street where we were in the ghetto. I hadn't remembered it for\nThomas Buergenthal 31\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 31\nyears, I couldn't remember it. It suddenly came back to me. And we drove into\nKielce, and I sort of directed her, and I'm a person who gets lost any place. I get lost\nin Washington, DC, if I don't see the Washington monument and here I sort of\ndirected her within two blocks of where we were in the ghetto and found the house.\nThe interesting thing is -- you know how children are -- I kept telling her, \"It's this\nbig house, I don't know, it must be six or seven stories high.\" When we got to it, it\nwas a three-story building. It was just as dilapidated, just as terrible as it was when I\nremembered it. And the faces of the people, there was a tremendous amount of\nantisemitism in Poland, and in Kielce particularly it was quite bad. We were always\nafraid that if you tried to escape from the camp you would be handed over to the\nGermans. The faces of the people and the lack of the fact that there was no\nmonument any place in the ghetto to say this was the ghetto. All I could think about\nwas, I want to get out of here. I just couldn't take it. Thinking that my parents lived\nin this one room in this house. My mother had just died and I couldn't wait to leave.\nIt was lunchtime and we were going to stop and have lunch, I said, \"I don't want to\ndo anything, I just want to get out of this place.\" I'd spent four years of my life there.\nBut it was exactly, I mean the part of the ghetto, that whole area -- and the lack of\nany remembering, any effort made to remember that 20,000 people had lived here\nwho had died. I did go -- we did go to a museum. We tried to find a museum and I\nasked for a book on the Jewish community of Kielce; eventually they found\nThomas Buergenthal 32\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 32\nsomething that had been issued, there had been some exhibit I don't know how long\nago, but there was nothing in the museum that you could see. This was the city\nmuseum of Kielce, and there was nothing about the wartime experience. A book that\nI eventually got -- it's sort of small little book about the Jewish community which\nmust have been issued during the Communist period. It was shocking to me, well,\nfirst the way that nothing had changed, but then it was sort of totally, it's as if all of\nthis that had happened there had no impact on the people and they didn't even want\nto remember it, whereas it was quite different in Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, I had\ncome in, we went first. I was in Birkenau in the nice camp in Auschwitz, so we went\nin there first. And I was very concerned how it would go. As we walked in we saw a\nsign that said, \u201cARCHIVES,\u201d and my wife said, \"Why don't you go in and introduce\nyourself?\" I was at this point thinking I should be writing down my experiences.\nAnd I said, \"No, I want to be a tourist, I don't want to bother with any of that.\" And\nshe insisted, so she usually prevails. I went in, introduced myself, and they took me\nto the director and he then introduced me to the archivist, and they were a whole\ngroup of people who came in. They were at that point actually working on a study\non children in the camp. So they wanted to know, where were you and everything\nelse. And then I had them check my number and find out when I arrived, and they\nhad all of the -- they had the document, they knew the number of people that came\nwith my transport to Auschwitz.\nThomas Buergenthal 33\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 33",
        "Q: This was -- you're talking about the tattoo that you got when you did arrive in\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: Right. And what happened then as a result of this activity, the whole thing for me\nbecame an academic exercise, so then we had a car and they put a guide at my\ndisposal and we went to Birkenau, but it was no longer the Auschwitz. So the\ntransition was made much easier because of all these questions.",
        "Q: I want to go back to the point where you are in the orphanage. Tell us how you were\nreconnected with your mother and any details that you know that were told to you in\nretrospect. How was the tracing actually done?",
        "A: That's a wonderful story because my mother believed that I was alive when\neverybody told her that it couldn't be, but she believed it and she insisted. Matter of\nfact, my mother walked back -- she was liberated not far from Regensburg -- she\nwalked back to Poland, to Kielce, looking for me. There were people who had --\nbecause she and my father had sort of different weigh stations where they were\ngoing to meet after the war. And people there had been in the camp with me and\nsome people had seen me at this point or at that point. They all told her, \"He can't be\nalive, forget it,\" you know. She insisted. Well, my uncle, who lived here in the\nUnited States -- my mother then went back to her hometown in Germany, was very\nsick. She was sort of three months drugged just to sleep it all off, and got in touch\nwith my uncle and they started the search and so the Jewish agency for Palestine and\nThomas Buergenthal 34\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 34\nvarious search bureaus of Red Cross and other things. In the meantime, I was in the\norphanage and in the orphanage -- the orphanage was run by Jewish Communists,\nso-called the Bund party, who wanted Jews to stay in Poland and become good\nCommunists. But the orphanage had been infiltrated by a Zionist organization and\none of our counselors was a young woman, a Zionist woman from the Ha-Shomer\nHa-Za\u2019ir movement, which is a Zionist labor movement. And they decided that\nthose of us who wanted to go to Palestine then -- this was in 1946 -- we should run\naway from the orphanage and we would be picked up by the people from that group\nand then taken to a kibbutz in Poland and then eventually be shipped illegally to\nPalestine. And so, the procedure was that every week or so, one kid who wanted to\ngo there would run away from the orphanage and would disappear. But we all who\nwanted to go, put our names, tell them that we wanted to run away, so they made a\nlist with our names. But I was told that since I had been on newsreels, that if I ran\naway that would really draw attention to the whole thing, so I had to be the last one\nto run away. But the list with names was sent to Palestine and it was sent to the\nJewish agency in Palestine and somebody in the Jewish agency looked at those lists -\n- this 1s pre-computers, imagine -- 1t was written in heaven -- saw a mother looking\nfor her child and a child with the same name on another list. Notified my uncle in the\nUnited States, and then my mother and then eventually they -- an American\norganization smuggled me out of Poland and Czechoslovakia to the American zone\nThomas Buergenthal 35\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 35\nin Germany and then to the British zone in Germany where my mother was. That\nwas in December of 1946, so imagine, I was separated from my mother in 1944.",
        "Q: Do you remember the moment that someone came and told you, \"Your mother's\nalive, she's in this place and we are going to take you to her?\"",
        "A: Well, that was actually very different. I received a letter in Polish supposedly from\nmy mother, written in handwriting, curious enough I could not really read, but I\nknew my mother's handwriting, and I knew that my mother didn't write Polish. And\nI thought it was a trick because every so often people tried to adopt us from the\norphanage so this letter came supposedly from my mother, delighted that she found\nme and she was going to get me out of there. And I was sure that wasn't my mother.\nIt wasn't until I received a letter from my mother in German that I knew it was my\nmother. You see, we couldn't talk on the telephone. None of that existed.",
        "Q: So it was your mother.",
        "A: It was my mother but she had somebody else write the letter in Polish thinking that I\nhad forgotten my German or since it was going to Poland.",
        "Q: And what did that letter say?",
        "A: Well, I really don't remember what it said. I wish I had kept it. Actually the letter\nwas written by a man who was in the camp with us who later became my mother's\nsecond husband, a wonderful man, a doctor. The only surviving doctor from -- who\nthen died unfortunately in '48. But he wrote that letter. I knew my mother couldn't\nThomas Buergenthal 36\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 36\nwrite Polish and we were always, you know, this adoption thing, this is the tough\nkids in the orphanage didn't want to be adopted. It really didn't dawn on me until\nmonths later.",
        "Q: So the orphanage said, \"Fine, his mother is alive.\" And now I'd like to know a little\nmore detail about getting smuggled out of Poland and into -- again it seemingly this\nshould have been easy for you to be reunited with your mother but here you are\nagain in these dangerous situations.",
        "A: Well, nothing was easy after the war. I had no papers for one thing, no passports --\nyou would have had to have visas and everything else. The orphanage was very\ncooperative and the orphanage was also supported by Jewish organizations from the\noutside, particularly the American Joint Distribution Committee. So they, sort of\nthrough my uncle, started beginning to move this reunion and how to get me to\nGermany. What happened was that somebody came and said that they were going to\ntake me to my mother and the orphanage agreed. I suppose they investigated it, and I\nwent with them. We had to be smuggled out of Poland, this was in the winter, this\nwas end of November, December 1946. We crossed over the border into\nCzechoslovakia, it was freezing and I was very affected because of my frostbite. We\nhad to walk across the Czech/Polish border, they had bribed the guards, it wasn't\ndangerous but it was still a sort of, 1t was an illegal operation. I then ended up, I was\npicked up by an American woman working for one of these organizations in Prague,\nThomas Buergenthal 37\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 37\ntaken to a hotel. I had never been in -- what I remember from this, it's funny how\nthese things stay in your mind. It was a revolving door and I didn't know how to get\ninto it. I was just standing there worrying. She walked through the revolving door\nand I was supposed to follow her and here I stood, I didn't know how to -- after all\nthis, the revolving door was something I had never seen before. Well, we stayed in\nPrague for a few days and then again we took a train but we got out of the train --\nthere was another group of border smugglers from a Jewish organization called\nBrichah which took us from the Czech side to a German town called Hirth in\nBavaria; it was the American zone. Again, trudging through border, walking across\nwith bribed border guards, and ending up in Munich and eventually going on a\nmilitary train with her from Munich to Gottingen, crossing into the British zone of\nGermany, and my mother awaiting me -- not in Gottingen, she couldn't wait -- in\nanother town. Well -- and then you know, then I just couldn't believe it at that point,\nthat's when the realization set in.",
        "Q: So, resume, how did your mother recognize you?",
        "A: I don't know how she recognized me, but I recognized her immediately. We had\nonly been separated three years. That was no problem.",
        "Q: Do you remember some of the first things you talked about in those first few\nmoments?",
        "A: Not really, I think it was so overwhelming, you know a lot of crying. The usual\nThomas Buergenthal 38\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 38\nthing.",
        "Q: So then your mother took you home. Had you ever been to where she was living\nbefore?",
        "A: No, because actually, even though my grandparent's house still stood, my\ngrandparent's were forced to sell it and my mother lived in an apartment in a nice\nhouse in town and life suddenly became normal after all of those years.",
        "Q: And, in a sense, it hadn't been that long since you hadn't seen your mother but in\nanother sense you had become essentially a man who figured out how to make his\nway in the middle of this war. How did she react to that? You must have been very\nindependent by that point, not her little boy anymore.",
        "A: I don't know whether that's true. I reverted to being her little boy in many ways. But\nit's interesting because I spent -- we had to think of school and all of this -- and I had\na year, a little more than a year of private tutoring from a retired German teacher,\nand he said that he couldn't get over the fact that I would be a little child in one sense\nand a grown man in another when we discussed things and I imagine that was the\nsame with my mother. Although, with my mother, we discussed -- there was a lot of\nreminiscing about the camp, you know -- where was this, what happened. But I was\na child, I played, I did everything. I wasn't at that point -- this was in 1946, 1947 --\nhow old was I? 14, 13 years old. I couldn't speak German too well. Again, this was\nsort of the interesting part; it took me a while to get back into German because I had\nThomas Buergenthal 39\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 39\nspoken much more Polish than German, and it took me sort of a month or two to be\nfluent again in German even though at home we used to speak German and Polish. I\nspoke German with my mother and father when we were together and Polish with\nmy father when we were alone.",
        "Q: And so there was a kind of -- let's catch up and what happened to you. Where you\ndid sort of sit down and just really debrief with each other?",
        "A: Yes. And things would come back and you would talk about this or that and another\nthing that is so interesting, people often think that when people get together from a\ncamp, all we'd talk about were all these terrible things that happened. The truth of\nthe matter is that we often laughed about things in retrospect, about things that\nhappened that were funny, about this or that happened. So the human spirit -- you\ncouldn't take all this if 1t were only reminiscences about all the terrible things. So my\nwife often sort of marveled about the fact that even in recent years when my mother\nand I would get together we would talk about these things and talk about them often\nand remember this funny thing, and remember this. It wasn't only remembering the\nterrible things that had happened. I imagine it was probably when I was little we\ntalked more about those things.",
        "Q: Because after all life does happen.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: At that point what did you know about the fate of your father? Was it still a mystery,\nThomas Buergenthal 40\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 40\nand if you did know anything, how did you know it?",
        "A: No, at that point my mother already knew that my father had not survived. It's\nstrange because I had always believed that my father would survive. It's strange, my\nmother was not well, my mother had thyroid condition so I assumed that if one or\nthe other of them was going to survive it was going to be my father who was going\nto survive because he was also, he was very strong and very healthy. But he was\nexecuted three days before the war supposedly ended, in another camp, in\nFlossenburg, where they executed a lot of people just before the end of the war.",
        "Q: So that was a situation where perhaps the Germans were going to surrender or leave\nand they just emptied out the camps by killing people?",
        "A: I understand that he was in the group, there were orders given apparently to not let\nany of the prisoners -- most of the camps fall into -- be liberated. And where he was\nthe order was executed, in fact.",
        "Q: How did you find that out? Did people tell you that who were there or did you\nresearch it later in life?",
        "A: No, I didn't find it out, my mother at that point already knew.",
        "Q: So was there a point -- then finally you knew about your father -- where you stepped\nback and took a sort of time to mourn him in any way, you and your mother\ntogether? I'm not sure how.",
        "A: You know it's strange but life was so unordinary if you want, that you didn't mourn\nThomas Buergenthal 41\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 41\nin the same way. It was a loss, you know, we lost so many people. It was a terrible\nthing that my father hadn't survived. It was something that I still feel today but\nmourning wasn't something one did in the way one does for example, if somebody\ndies and one goes through this period. It was a reality one simply accepted, added to\nall the other things that had happened. But one didn't mourn the way we do in\nordinary, everyday life. That simply didn't happen. I'm sure when my mother first\nfound out, it must have been extremely difficult. But by the time I was reunited with\nmy mother I think I -- I don't know when or if ever, on the one hand I always\nbelieved I was going to find my parents, but at the same time I must have at some\npoint in the orphanage already concluded that I wouldn't be reunited, that neither of\nthem lived.",
        "Q: When you think back to when you finally got to Germany and you're with your\nmother, those first few days, and you're looking around and all of a sudden your life\nis beginning to look a little more normal, do you, I mean, was there one moment\nwhen you sort of remember looking around, maybe going to a market with your\nmother and saying, \"Okay, this is pretty normal, my life is normal now?\"",
        "A: No, you know. I think I assumed that my life had been normal from the very\nbeginning. The fact that 1t wasn't normal was part of it being normal, this was all part\nof the life that I had lived. I mean you would think that going back to Germany for\nexample, would be difficult. It was difficult. It was very difficult initially for my\nThomas Buergenthal 42\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 42\nmother but this was the only place she really could go back to. My mother always\ntold the story with a very bad conscious, very guilty, because she was standing on\nthe street corner in her home town and an old lady came up to her and asked her to\nhelp her across the street and my mother said, \"Nobody helped my mother across the\nstreet in this town.\" This was right after she came back. Then for years she would\ntalk about 1t and say how terrible it was that she had acted that way. So you know,\nwe had all of those feelings. But then I went there to school initially but at first the\nthought to go with these kids whose fathers had killed my father. But then you\nrealize that these are people you don't know whether they killed your father, most of\nthem probably didn't, and you make friends. And you find for example, we lived in\nthe house with somebody, who was, a Catholic family that had actually helped the\nJews in town, had been in danger themselves. And so that sort of abstract hatred\nbecomes transformed into the fact that they're human beings regardless of whether\nthey're Germans or not Germans and not every German was guilty.",
        "Q: When you first got there and you had to brush up on your German and you had a\nGerman tutor, how did you feel about that? I mean you were after all learning this\nlanguage that you must, at that point, you might have associated with the camps and\nkind of negative things.",
        "A: But remember, it was also the language of my mother. I've never made that\nassociation. I always had terrible trouble seeing Germans in uniform but not the\nThomas Buergenthal 43\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 43\nlanguage. And it wasn't a problem then. But of course the difficulty was that one did\nsometimes see types on the street that reminded one of the SS and others, so they\nprobably were. My mother would every so often look at some woman walking by\nand say that she must have been a camp guard. And you know, those memories\nwould invariably come back or people would make some remarks or people would\nsee her number. She always wore short sleeves and people would say to her, \"Don't\nyou think you should have this tattoo removed?\" And she would say, \"This is a\nbadge of honor, I would never remove this.\" You know, and she had a lot of the --\n[end of side one of tape 2]\nTape 2, Side B\n-- lived in Italy, starting I think in 1953 until she died. Every so often if she would\nsee a German tour guide, she would make some sort of remark but at the same time\nshe was very forgiving in many ways.",
        "Q: Did you ever consider removing your tatoo?",
        "A: No. But I think it's, it's -- and nobody told me to, that 1t would be a good idea if I\nremoved it. But I think you'd tell it to -- she was a very pretty woman and so I\nsuppose it was a natural thing to say, \"Shouldn't you remove it?\" But no, she was\nvery wonderful, she was a very little person. She was less than five feet tall, very\nThomas Buergenthal 44\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 44\ncharming but very tough. I mean, the fact that she could survive that camp. And she\nactually survived Mengele\u00ae who looked at her in the selection process and said to\nher, \"You have a thyroid condition\" because her eyes would show. And she in her\nwonderful north German looked at her and said, \"Doctor, you're a magnificent\ndiagnostician.\" And he let her go. You know that's kind of sort of --",
        "Q: When you were beginning to integrate yourself into this German town, how open\nwere you about being Jewish, about being a survivor of the camps and was it\nsomething that people talked about or were people saying, \"Some of that's\nexaggeration, it didn't really happen\"? What was going on then in terms of your\nexperience?",
        "A: First of all, we were very proud of being Jews and being survivors. And of course\nyou know, my mother's family was known. This was a small town, this is a famous\nuniversity town, it had 50,000 inhabitants but my mother grew up in that town and\nwe were known. I was the only Jewish child in the school and the German kids\nwould sometimes look at me and say, \"You don't look the ways Jews are supposed\nto look\" because their only notion of Jews were these cartoons that they had seen.\nThe kids, you know children are children. I never experienced any antisemitism in\nthe school, never had any sense. I've experienced antisemitism more in many other\nplaces, but never in school in Germany. People said they didn't know. The only\n> Josef Mengele (1911-19792), Extermination camp doctor at Auschwitz.\nThomas Buergenthal 45\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 45\nincident really that I remember in school was, of course, the teachers tried to avoid\nspeaking about the war altogether. It was never mentioned in history class. History\nwas taught. You spoke about the German mythology and the 17th, 18th century but\nnever about the 20th century. That was never taken up. But in one class, I don't\nknow whether it was even a history class, but the issue came up of the bombing of\nDresden and Hamburg and the teacher was saying how terrible that was and I raised\nmy hand and I said, \"Well, if you're going to talk about that, why don't you also talk\nabout all the other terrible things that you people did,\" and all hell broke loose. The\nteacher got very huffy initially and then, of course, worried because this was right\nafter the war and they had to go through denazification and all of these things. Then\nhe came at some point to our house and apologized. But that was the only incident\nwhich this matter ever came up. Of course, they tried to never talk about it. The kids\nwould sometimes ask, \u201c\u201cWhat's this number?\u201d and \u201cHow bad was it?\u201d Because these\nare kids my age.",
        "Q: What would you tell them, would you be honest?",
        "A: Oh, yes, I would tell them this is what happened, and then they would tell me that\ntheir father was -- you know, some of the kids' fathers were prisoners of war. But it\nwas curiosity more than, but I never had the sense of any sort of antisemitic feeling\nor any sense of, \"Oh, it's a pity that you weren't...\" You know, the usual thing that\none expects 1s, \"How come you survived and why did you survive, what a pity that\nThomas Buergenthal 46\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 46\nyou...\" None of that ever.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any fear that if you were very open about who you were about as\na Jew, or confronted any authority, that somehow the rug could get pulled out from\nunder you again, that you could be persecuted for being Jewish?",
        "A: No, never. You know the strange thing is that when you enter a class, I learned very\nearly because I learned it in the orphanage, too; in the orphanage, I was the kid who\nwas sent to get the mail from the post office, this was in Poland. Because a lot of\nkids, the Poles would throw stones at and attack them and yell antisemitic slogans at\nthem. I would go and pick up the mail and nobody would yell at me. For one thing I\ndidn't look Jewish. But I remember once confronting somebody and who said\nsomething about me and the first reaction was to just slug him, and I learned very\nearly that with all of that, the best way was to just be extremely aggressive and if\nsomebody said something like this, you just whopped them one but you didn't act as\nif you were afraid. And that was also very effective in school in Germany when you\nenter the class. I was quite strong. And so you took on, not because of antisemitism\nor anything else, but when you came into a new environment you had to assert\nyourself and so you took on the fellow who was supposed to be the strongest. And I\nremember I was very good in arm wrestling and I could beat anybody so we would\nprove ourselves, you know the usual, almost like monkeys assert their superiority.\nBut I never had any problems in school. I had to prove myself like I imagine any\nThomas Buergenthal 47\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 47\nother kid has to prove himself.",
        "Q: So you had gotten strong now, you grew strong again, healthy?",
        "A: Yes, I was extremely healthy. Quite athletic. I did, I played soccer in the orphanage.\nI boxed in Germany. I ran -- I actually won the 100-meter championship with my\namputated toes, which nobody knew about. So it -- and I loved sports. It was all of\nthe things that Germans to be able to do was another part.",
        "Q: Did your mother have a strategy for keeping you healthy in terms of cooking? Was it\na kind of concentrated effort?",
        "A: No, I never had the sense that -- she let me do, eat what I wanted and at that point in\nthe beginning it wasn't always easy to get food after the war but we always had\nrelatively good food. Of course, any food we would have had was good from my\npoint of view at the time but I don't remember. We received some care packages\nactually from the United States and my relatives here sent some food. It was always\na big event when a package arrived from the United States with different things\ncoming out of cans.",
        "Q: How did your mother earn money? What was she doing at this point?",
        "A: Well, my mother wasn't doing anything. At that point we -- she -- received a\npension. Initially we received -- there was actually aid given to Jewish, from Jewish\norganizations and at one point she was the president of the Jewish community which\nconsisted, I think, of about 20 Jewish, Jews\u2019 families and individuals. And there was\nThomas Buergenthal 48\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 48\nfood brought and distributed, and we\u2014she -- received after my father, which later\non was increased and she could actually live quite well on that pension. And we\ntraded, you know, we used to trade. If you got a pack of cigarettes from the Unites\nStates you could trade that and you could live for a week on the food that you could\ntrade with the farmers that would come in for coffee or cigarettes. Right after the\nwar until 1948 in Germany, if you got any cigarettes and coffee from the United\nStates, it was a wonderful way to obtain good food from the farmers.",
        "Q: Were there any military Allied troops at all in your town, or did you have any sense\nof a military presence there?",
        "A: Yes, there were English troops. As a matter of fact, it's very interesting. The -- a\ncurrent British member of parliament -- a Jewish member of parliament, a man by\nthe name of Janner,\u00b0 whose father is already represented the Jewish, the east side of\nLondon in the British parliament -- was a young soldier and came to visit us and the\nbefriended us and I stayed in touch with him. He took me to movies and brought us\nsome food, but there was a British occupation troop there.",
        "Q: How did they know you?",
        "A: They apparently asked for somebody, whether there was any Jewish community and\nJewish families, and he made a point of finding us. And that happened often. People,\nif there were Jewish soldiers in town, they would try to find whether there were\nThomas Buergenthal 49\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 49\nJewish families and whether they needed anything.",
        "Q: How aware of you -- were you -- of the rest of the sort of post-war period? Were you\nfor instance following the Nuremberg trial and were you aware of Albert Speer?\u2019\nWas that something you were following or were you --",
        "A: Well, it's interesting you should ask that because I remember the Nuremberg trials\nonly to the extent that I remember the first, almost first English words that I\nremember was \"by hanging,\" and I remember listening to the radio when they\nannounced the sentences and we were listening to that with sort of joy. But that's the\nonly thing that I remember of that period. But I should tell you a story that is\ninteresting connected with occupation forces because we mentioned Mr. Nansen\nwho had written a diary, then a book about me. I forgot his name when I was\nliberated from the camp. I couldn't remember his name. But when I came back to my\nmother I kept saying, \"There was this wonderful man, this Norwegian who had\nsaved my life and was very nice to me, and his father was very famous and his\nfather's pictures were on even the packages of cookies that he once gave me.\" And\nmy mother said, \"He must have been some famous cookie manufacturer.\" So you\nknow, it was just sort of the way you would treat a kid. I kept saying, \"No, no, this\nman...\" Then, one day in 1948, my mother was reading a newspaper that was for\n\u00b0 Janner, Barnett, Lord (1892-), British communal and Zionist leader.\n\u2019 Speer, Albert (1905-1981); Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production,\nThomas Buergenthal 50\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 50\nformer inmates in the camp and there was a little write-up of a book that had just\nbeen published, the diaries of a man, a Norwegian, who had been in Sachsenhausen\nso my mother said to me \"That might be your cookie -- he might know who that man\nwas. Why don't we write to him and find out?\" So we wrote this letter to him asking\nwhether he might know the man who was so nice to me. And of course the mail was\nterrible in those days. Nothing happened for a while. Then one day the doorbell rings\nand there's a big Norwegian military truck outside and the girl who opened the door\nsaid, \"Yes?\" He said, \"Well, we have a package here for the Buergenthal family. So\nshe said, \"Give it to me,\" and they said, \"No, no, no, it's much too heavy, we have to\ntake it in.\" So they take a tremendous crate and they bring it up and it's food\ncollected from Norwegian children with a letter from him saying that he's the person\nand, you know, how delighted he was that I'm alive because he thought that I had\ndied in the camp and as a result that's why the book was dedicated to me, among\nothers, because he thought that I hadn't survived. Then eventually he came and he\nactually took me to Norway to spend six weeks in Norway, and had a wonderful\ntime. But it was, when he learned that I was alive, he announced it in Norway and so\nthe school children began to collect food. And apparently they collected, there was a\nlot of chocolate which was rationed at that time in Norway, so it was quite a sacrifice\nfor Norwegian children to give up their chocolate rations so I could have that. The\nHitler\u2019s chief architect.\nThomas Buergenthal 51\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 51\nScandinavians were just wonderful in the camp.",
        "Q: At this point is your life beginning to be normal? You were about 13, 14, 15, but\nwere you ever having nightmares at anything or at that point did you have memories\nthat plagued you, I suppose?",
        "A: I used to have nightmares for a while in the camp, but then I found a wonderful way\nto solve, deal with my nightmares and I never had them again. Never had them as\nnightmares. I had this recurring dream that I was being executed and then in one\nnightmare when I looked into the barrel of the gun, some flower or grass came out of\nit and they weren't real bullets. So every time this nightmare recurred, I had, saw that\nas nothing to worry about because no bullets are going to come out of this gun and\nthe nightmares were never a problem.",
        "Q: Were you comfortable in Germany?",
        "A: Yes and no. I knew that I wanted to leave. I mean, I wasn't uncomfortable in the\nsense that I didn't feel that I wasn't well-treated. But I felt I really didn't belong. And\nI felt that sooner or later I would leave and the only question was whether I would go\nto Israel or some place else and I actually planned to go to Israel. Then I came to the\nUnited States. Actually I came to the United States really for only one year and\nnever went back but I didn't think I would stay. It was sort of clear to me even before\nI came to the United States, that I really didn't fit in somehow. Not because I had\nbeen made uncomfortable in any way, and this was probably the reason too why my\nThomas Buergenthal 52\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 52\nmother left.",
        "Q: When you began to have those thoughts, what was your mother saying? What were\nher feelings about being separated again?",
        "A: Well, my mother just thought that I would go to the United States for a year and stay\nwith my uncle and come back and she thought that it was a good experience that I\nshould go to America. America was what we imagined, it was heaven and you had\nto see it, it was wonderful, but she didn't think that I would stay. It was hard for her\nwhen I didn't, but I tried to come back as often as I could. But I think she recognized\nthat it was the best thing for me to do.",
        "Q: Tell us about your uncle, his name first of all, and how you first came here. How did\nyou actually get here? Did you come on a boat or did you fly?",
        "A: No, I came on a boat, on a Liberty boat, the SS Greeley (ph), SS General Greeley\n(ph). It was one of these, you know, the tubs that were built for a troop transport. It\nwas a long trip, I think we were at least a week if not longer on the ship, with a large\nnumber of refugees; it was immigrants coming. All nationalities, all languages.\nWell, what can I tell you about it? It was actually quite an interesting trip because I\nrealized again the survival instinct that we talked about. People had to work on the\nboats, people had to paint and sweep. At that point I was 17 and I realized that\nwasn't really the nice thing to have to do and I volunteered to be an interpreter, so I\nwould have to go and make the announcements in different languages over the\nThomas Buergenthal 53\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 53\npublic address system. In that capacity we had a lovely place to stay and we actually\npublished a newspaper. I still have the newspaper that we published on the last day\non the arrival in New York. It was a very wonderful group of people from all over\nincluding a Kalnick (ph) family from the steppes of Russia. I still have some\npictures. Then I came to the United States. For some reason my uncle couldn't pick\nme up, he wasn't allowed to pick me up from the ship but I was picked up by a\nJewish welfare service organization who took me to a house, like a sort of halfway\nhouse in the Bronx where I stayed a week before my uncle picked me up. The very\nfunny thing that happened there, I arrived there and there were other kids in this\nhouse and they of course were natives already, they'd been here a few weeks and\nknew New York and everything. They took me, they said, \"You want to see New\nYork? You want to see Manhattan?\" Of course I wanted to see Manhattan. We got\non the subway and the doors opened up and they got out at one stop and I didn't\nmake it out and I had no idea where I was because I had no address, but we got\nreunited at the next stop. But my uncle and my aunt are wonderful people, they're\nstill alive. My uncle and aunt came, their names are Sylberg, Eric and Senta Sylburg\n(ph). They lived in Paterson, New Jersey, at the time. They came in 1938 to the\nUnited States, a very hard time. They worked in factories, one daughter. They're\nnow in their 80s but still doing very well. And they took me in. They weren't\nwealthy people at all. And I lived with them for a year and a half while I went to\nThomas Buergenthal 54\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 54\nhigh school in Paterson. They were sort of my surrogate parents for many years,\nuntil I went to Bethany.",
        "Q: Did you speak any English at this point?",
        "A: Yes, well, I spoke some English, I had high school German, German high school\nEnglish.",
        "Q: What were your other languages?",
        "A: Well I had Polish, German, and French, which I've basically lost on learning\nSpanish; it's very difficult for me now.",
        "Q: And just to clarify, the boat that you came over on, this was formerly a group of\nrefugees who were given permission to come over and you came as a group?",
        "A: Yes. Well, what happened was this: there was a sort of -- instead of Ellis Island they\nhad established a camp, the U.S. authorities had established a camp in Bremerhaven\nin Germany, where people who had different visas to come to the United States as\nrefugees were first brought into these camps, their papers were examined. And then\nevery few weeks they would have a ship ready and they would take people over on\nthese ships as a refugee ship, and that was one of those ships.",
        "Q: What was your first view of the United States, literally? Was it of Ellis Island and\nthe Statue of Liberty?",
        "A: No, but it was of the Statue of Liberty. Because we arrived -- it was really wonderful\n-- we arrived in the late afternoon and so we couldn't disembark until the next\nThomas Buergenthal 55\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 55\nmorning and so we could see the Statue of Liberty all lit up. As a matter of fact in\nthe newspaper article that each of us wrote in a different language. I wrote mine in\nGerman. I noted the lights of the Statue of Liberty and the lights of New York City,\nwhich made a tremendous impression on me. I reflected on Auschwitz and the\ncrematory and the light. So it was a tremendous moment.",
        "Q: So you did flashback on Auschwitz.",
        "A: Very much so. I reread it the other day and I was struck by how much I -- these\nflashbacks come to me, for example they came to me in El Salvador, they come all\nthe time. One really can't have gone through that experience and when you see\nsomething similar, that brings it back, of course. It doesn't bring it back necessarily\nin a negative way. But I saw it in connection with the El Mozote massacre in El\nSalvador or the killing of the Jesuits. These things came right back to me.",
        "Q: What did you decide to study when you went to college? As we've pointed out\nbefore, you went to Bethany college in West Virginia on a scholarship. When did\nyour interests begin to take shape?",
        "A: Well, it's strange. Initially I thought I wanted to be a journalist but then I decided\nvery early that I wouldn't make much of a journalist in the language that wasn't my\nlanguage. When I went to Bethany, I already, I think the first year in Bethany I\nalready decided I was going to be a lawyer and I was going to do something relating\nto international things, I didn't have it very clear in my mind and I actually was a\nThomas Buergenthal 56\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 56\npre-law student in Bethany. My father was a lawyer so it was sort of an easy -- at\none point I thought of studying medicine but then I realized again that I didn't have\nthe science ability or background. But it's really the lawyer thing was already,\nactually when I was in high school in Paterson I had already decided that.",
        "Q: And as you started to study the law, how did your interest in it take shape? Did you\never at one point think you might be a trial lawyer or some other type of lawyer?",
        "A: No, never. I always thought I wanted to do something with law and international\nrelations of some sort. But you know, in law school -- at least in your first years in\nlaw school, at least in the days that I went to law school -- you couldn't even get a\ncourse in international law in your first or second year. It was usually you got\nelectives only in the third year so I had my first international law course in my third\nyear of law school. It wasn't until I went onto graduate law that I specialized and\ncould specialize in international law. But I always -- at that point when I was in law\nschool I'd made up my mind I would do something in international law.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: Where we are is, I want to go back with a couple questions about college as we're\nmoving into your choice of law as a career. What were you drawn to in terms of\nwhat you wanted to study in college? What kinds of things were you finding\nThomas Buergenthal 57\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 57\nyourself interested in?",
        "A: Well, in college I was very much interested in history, particularly American history.\nThat fascination sort of came out of high school, I had a very fine high school\nhistory course, and then political science, international relations was always there.\nAnd literature -- I actually majored -- I minored in English in college of all things.\nThen in law school I wanted to study international things but I really had only one\ncourse as I mentioned before, then I decided to go on to graduate school. I did my\nlaw school at NYU and I went on to Harvard for a masters and eventually for a\ndoctorate in international law. What was interesting, struck me, I reread my\napplication to Harvard what I wanted to do, and in my application I said that I\nwanted to study international courts among other things, and then I ended up serving\n12 years on an international court without knowing it. It was sort of a strange thing,\nbut that's what I wanted to do. But I did work at Harvard on international\norganizations I was particularly interested in. The European common market was\njust beginning and I was interested in how that court functioned. Then I did my\ndoctorate actually on a subject that everybody is surprised out, I did it on\ninternational air law. But in between I got very much interested in human rights and\nI wrote one of my first articles on human rights.",
        "Q: What was appealing to you about the law? I mean when you actually started to sink\nyour teeth into it and you're studying it every day and verbally, I suppose, debating\nThomas Buergenthal 58\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 58\nit. What were your reactions to it? What did you like about it, what did you dislike\nabout it?",
        "A: Well, if we're just talking law school in general, I disliked almost everything about\nit. I just hated my first year in law school. I thought it was much too technical and\nvery lacking in -- at least the way it was taught in those days -- very little policy\norientation and there was sort of various technical, dry case analysis that didn't, to\nmy mind at the time, didn't focus on what I thought were important issues. It wasn't\nreally until I was able to study what I was really interested in, which was\ninternational law. I got interested, I began to enjoy law really in my third year in law\nschool, and then international law because I saw it as an instrument of being able to\ndeal with some of the problems that I had myself experienced. And I wanted to see\nto what extent law could play a role in preventing some of these things. And I'm not\nsaying this in any sort of philosophical sense, but I thought I had a background in, a\nlanguage background and was sort of naturally drawn to things international. I\ntherefore thought it would be interesting to see to what extent various organizations\nlike the UN, the European Common Market, the Council of Europe; to what extent\nthey're doing something that in fact might prevent the reoccurrence of the things that\nI had experienced. And once I got into it, that was the thing that really captivated\nme.",
        "Q: What was the atmosphere at that time -- the sort of attitude about international law --\nThomas Buergenthal 59\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 59\nwas there a feeling that it was an effective tool, or when you were studying it was\nthere a different feeling?",
        "A: Well, it depends a little bit where -- when I got to Harvard I had some wonderful\nprofessors of international law, probably among the best in the world. And they\ndemonstrated the importance of it and sort of opened a completely new different\nworld for me. But of course, all the people around us, that is to say not in the law\nschool but the world around us believed that all of this really didn't exist, that there\nwas no such thing as international law and that it was totally irrelevant. And so you\nalways had the sense that you were sort of an academic who was studying something\nthat had no relevance to anything that happened in the real world. I never believed\nthis, I always thought that 1t was much more relevant than people thought, than the\naverage person thought, and much more relevant than most Americans thought. I\nthought Americans probably had a much less of an understanding of the importance\nof international law than people in other parts of the world. And less of a realization\nof the importance of the UN for example and the significance of it than people in\nother parts of the world. So it was sort of almost a schizophrenic aspect when you\nwere studying international law. You'd go to a cocktail party and people would say,\n\"Well, what are you studying?\" You'd say, \"International law,\" and they'd say,\n\"Does it really exist?\" Then when I started teaching, you'd get the same, sort of. But\nwhat I was able to do and throughout my life, my professional life, is that I never\nThomas Buergenthal 60\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 60\njust did, I was never just an academic, that I wrote and taught international law,\nparticularly human rights and international organizations. But starting in the early\n70s I really worked -- in the 70s I began to represent the U.S. Government at\nUNESCO in human rights matters, then I ended up on the InterAmerican Court of\nHuman Rights where we dealt with some very nasty cases like disappearances and\nother things. And now I'm on the UN Human Rights Committee, and we're doing the\nsame. I was on the Truth Commission of El Salvador, all the time while continuing\nto teach. So that, to me, international law was never just an academic subject. I also -\n- | have lived it almost all of the years since I began teaching. I've also practiced it in\na way, not in as a law firm lawyer but as a international lawyer working in the field.",
        "Q: When would you say you began to develop a philosophy of human rights law and\nthat you saw that emerge in your ideals in the kinds of choices you were making and\nthe cases you were bringing? And what is your philosophy, I suppose?",
        "A: Well you know, I've never brought a human rights case. I've always thought that I\ncould be much more effective in the human rights area by not being an activist in the\nsense of being a lawyer filing cases, but an academic who could be perceived to\nhave a legitimacy when he spoke on human rights issue that wasn't driven by\npolitical considerations. It wasn't driven by other considerations and that had no\npolitical agenda other than concern for human rights. And that has been enabled me,\n* United Nations Educational and Cultural Organizations\nThomas Buergenthal 61\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 61\nin fact, to be on a human rights court and be put in positions of being able, I think, to\ndo a great deal in the human rights area, and to be taken seriously in the human\nrights area without being viewed as somebody who has a political agenda. I think it's\nvery important for NGOs\u2019 and activist organizations to do the work that they're\ndoing, but it's also important for people to be seen as committed to human rights and\ncommitted to the advancement of human rights who aren't political activists in the\nfield. And I've always thought that I could do much more by doing that, by staying\nabove the sort of political foray, and that was particularly important in Latin\nAmerica, where from the beginning if you spoke about human rights you were\nperceived to be a Communist. As a matter of fact, I founded the InterAmerican\nInstitute of Human Rights in Costa Rica, precisely in order to legitimate just a\ndiscussion of human rights, which when I first came I was involved with Latin\nAmerica in the late 70s, the discussion of human rights wasn't a legitimate subject, it\njust became aggressive political discourse between the right and the left. And so my\nsense has always been that some of us, at any rate, can contribute much more\nthrough teaching and through serving as impartial arbiters in this field. In the\nteaching area, I -- my former professor at Harvard and I -- did the first American\ncase book in international human rights. We established the teaching of international\nhuman rights in the American law schools. And our book came out in 1977 and\n? National Governing Organizations\nThomas Buergenthal 62\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 62\nbefore then only three of us taught the subject. It's now taught in almost all\nAmerican law schools. And, you know, I have a little book for students on the\nteaching of -- on international human rights, which actually the subject has suddenly\ntaken on a life of it's own not only in law schools but every place else, which it didn't\nhave when I first started in this field in the late 60s. Nobody was interested in this\nfield and in the international -- the American Society of International -- didn't even\nconsider human rights to be a subject of international -- so I worked in both of these\nareas and I thought it was always very important. Philosophy -- that's the philosophy\nI suppose. To my mind the most important thing in this field is not to let yourself be\npoliticized; that's the biggest danger that I see. People who promote human rights,\nwhen they politicize the subject, do a great deal of harm to the victims because they\nthen debilitate themselves in being able to protect victims. Also I've learned a great\ndeal of patience in this field. It takes a few lifetimes to be able to achieve anything.\nBut, you know, the most gratifying thing is to -- it's often occurred to me when I\nworked in Zepuan (ph) sitting on the case or when investigating human rights\nviolations in El Salvador or now at the UN -- to think that somebody who had\nsurvived Auschwitz is given the opportunity to be working in this field now. It's a\nwonderful -- it's a gift, it's a blessing when you think about it, you know, that I've\nbeen given this opportunity. It's exciting and that's what sort of makes this all for me.\nEvery time I sit on something that sort of brings back the memory, it seems to me to\nThomas Buergenthal 63\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 63\nsay that it's almost as if there was something written that I'm supposed to be doing\nthis. The irony, the poetic justice of my doing this, comes back so often. It came\nback particularly in El Salvador where so many things that I saw reminded me of the\ncamps, from the massacres to the executions. But to think, you know, to think of the\ncold Polish winters and the tropics of El Salvador, yet the same cruelty, and for me\nto be able to be involved in this, it boggles the mind in many ways.",
        "Q: I'm not sure most people would make that connection unless they had your\nexperience in the camps, that there was a kind of similar, I guess, brutality going on\nbetween treatment of people in the camps and what happened during the worst of the\ncivil war in El Salvador.",
        "A: Well, you know, it struck me long ago when I read Solzhenitsyn! books about the\ngulag, that the unimaginative cruelty, it's always the same. You know, when you\nread what happened in the gulags, you say, \"Gee, this is exactly what happened in\nthe camps.\" And then in El Salvador for example, when the only survivor there\ndescribed the massacre. When she began talking, I could have finished the story for\nher. I was struck by the fact that I could have continued about what happened. It's\nthe same, I mean this brutality and the same thing in Bosnia. There is no -- evil has\nsort of a monotone to it. I don't know, that is the thing that always strikes me, that I\njust can't get over.\nThomas Buergenthal 64\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 64",
        "Q: How do you think your personal experiences shape -- how do you think your\npersonal experiences shape what you actually decide to do in certain situations with\na case? Perhaps when you're sitting on a court -- or maybe the link is not that direct.",
        "A: The link is probably there and it's not there. In other words, it doesn't and it shouldn't\nshape the outcome of the decision. What it does, it's you have a much better sense of\nthe reality in which an event happened. It's as if, you know, if I were a judge sitting\non a commercial case and I'd been prior to that a lawyer practicing in the\ncommercial law area, I would have a much better sense of dealing with this material\nthan somebody who came out of some other environment. Well, it's a little the same\nfor me when I deal with a human rights case. This is a reality. When I hear\nsomebody describe a certain situation, there is an understanding of what could have\nhappened and also doubts raise when somebody tells you something, you say\nwhenever that doesn't sound right. And you can make those, you can have those\ndoubts only if you've lived through something similar. So to that extent there is a\nconnection, and to that extent it's very useful. But it shouldn't affect your decision-\nmaking process. But of course, there is the empathy that comes out of the\nexperience, is there. And I think people shouldn't be in human rights if they don't\nhave some empathy for what it is to be subjected to violations. But I don't know,\nsometimes you wonder and you say to yourself, you know, something at the UN\n' Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr Isayevich (1918-), author.\nThomas Buergenthal 65\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 65\nnow where it's different from being on the court. You sometimes go very fast\nthrough a lot of material and you say, \"Gee, we have 140 countries, 80 countries\nfrom which we can receive reports, individual cases. Death penalty cases, people on\ndeath row for 18 years, things like that. And you wonder, you know, you sit on this\nand what in-roads do you really make? But it's only a very -- I have that in very few\nmoments when the going gets tough.",
        "Q: Do you ever have moments when you think, \"I'm tired of this, I'm just tired of this.\nI've in a sense been looking at this kind of stuff my whole life, since I was a little\nboy, and that I would like to be looking at shipping contracts or something\u201d\u201d?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Actually I do that sometimes. Matter of fact, this year I was involved in a\ncommercial arbitration as an arbitrator. No, you have to get a -- you can't -- first of\nall I've never -- there are some people who sort of live with their concentration camp\nexperience; it's become an obsession. I think I would go crazy if I did. The one good\nthing, I've always been able to relax, with -- I don't need very much time. But if I\nhave these meetings and they go on for three weeks, if we can then take off for just a\nfew days, I don't carry it with me. And this is survivor instinct. No, you have to get\naway. I get away from it in my writings, really, my academic writings. Even though\nI deal a lot with human rights issues, but it's very academic and it's something else.\nAnd I've tried to write at least one or two articles or a book a year so that keeps me\nobsessed in other ways.\nThomas Buergenthal 66\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 66",
        "Q: Have you ever written about your personal experience, whether it would be for some\nsort of publication, or even maybe perhaps for your family?",
        "A: Well, after my bypass operation in '93 I decided -- my kids have been pressing me\nfor a long time -- I decided to begin writing. I've written about three or four chapters.\nBut I've come to the conclusion that I need -- I can't do it by myself. I'm much too\nmuch a lawyer when I write. It doesn't -- I describe things rather than -- and I've\nactually discussed it with somebody, that she might work with me. Because what I\nwrite sort of comes out wooden in many ways. And I don't deal -- I'm particularly\nbad in describing emotions. But it's obvious that one needs to write it down and\nthings come back that have long been forgotten. I was struck by the fact that just\nsitting behind the computer and thinking of a certain event, a lot of things come\nback, names come back that I thought I'd forgotten and 50 years later suddenly the\nname of a camp commandant comes back to me, or the name of a street. That's the\nwonderful thing about doing that and I'll continue doing that. The problem is that\nacademic books come in between them, and then other assignments that sort of -- I\nhave about three of four chapters. And I did write actually in Bethany college, I did\nwrite one story and they had a publication.",
        "Q: Fiction or nonfiction?",
        "A: No, a story about the death march actually, that I reread in order to give the talk at\nthe Holocaust Museum on the Auschwitz -- on the 50th anniversary of the\nThomas Buergenthal 67\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 67\nHolocaust, of the death march. And I had to sort of go back in order to even recall\nsome things. No, it should be written down. I've given some interviews.",
        "Q: You said, \"It's obvious that it should be written down.\" You said that just a while\nago. Then you just said, \"It should be written down.\" Why?",
        "A: Well, first of all, 1t should be sort of written down for the family. What strikes me\nabout this whole thing is that when my kids were little they had no interest at all. I\nmean, they sort of knew, and as they got older, they're now in their late 20s and early\n30s, they now say, \"Write it down.\" And they would say, \"Well, why didn't you tell\nme that before?\" You know, this story or that story. But at the time really when they\nwere young they had no interest whatsoever, at least none that I could perceive. But\nnow they really are very interested and they want to know this and that. So that's one\nreason. I think the other reason is that these things should not be forgotten and those\nof us who have survived and who have the ability to recollect and express\nthemselves about that have an obligation to put it down. It's the kind of thing that if\nnothing else, hopefully it will have an impact on the future, at least in making people\nthink about how you can prevent those things. And also, you know, this notion about\nsome of the Holocaust deniers, here 1s an answer at least that this happened. The\nfurther away we get from it, supposedly, more of this denial is going to come about.",
        "Q: It seems that that's been a struggle from day one, that the Allied forces actually took\nGermans and showed them the camps at a certain point. Have you ever in your own\nThomas Buergenthal 68\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 68\npersonal experience come across someone who's denied that it happened, or the\nextent of it, and you've been able to say, \"Hey just listen to this story\u2019\u201d?",
        "A: No, I haven't. I've often thought that it would be wonderful if one of these people\nwould actually call me a liar so one could maybe bring a libel suit to try to establish\nthe truth of what actually happened. No, I've never had it. For many years I thought\nit wasn't worthwhile taking these people serious and I thought, you know, just a\nbunch of kooks. But it's surprising how some of these people have gained a certain\nlegitimacy and that's why it's important to deal with it. Because, of course, behind\nthis Holocaust denial, it's not so much that they are denying it just for it's own sake\nbut I think they're denying it in order to reestablish the type of political organizations\nthat made this thing possible in the first place. So it's part of the Neofascist, Neonazi-\ntype movement, and if you can deny that, that 1t happened, then it strengthens your\npolitical movement and that's dangerous.",
        "Q: Are you an American citizen?",
        "A: Yes, I am. I became an American citizen in '57. As a matter of fact, it was -- I think\nI'm one of the few people who became an American citizen with the help of the FBI\nbecause I had won the nomination for the Rhodes scholarship from West Virginia\nfrom Bethany and then from the state of West Virginia, and I wasn't a citizen yet and\nin order to compete in the finals I had to be a citizen. A lawyer in West Virginia who\nhad been an FBI agent and who was also a former Rhodes scholar moved all kinds\nThomas Buergenthal 69\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 69\nof things to get me my citizenship, get me cleared very fast so that I could get it. I\nhad been in the country long enough but it would have taken much longer. But I\nmanaged to get it and I managed not to get the Rhodes scholarship because I couldn't\nexplain in the finals why I wanted to go to England when I had just gotten to the\nUnited States, which was very difficult to explain, and I really was lost.",
        "Q: They asked that specific question?",
        "A: They asked me a lot of other things and all of that seemed to be going well until they\nsaid, \"Well, you've just become a US citizen, why do you want to go to England?\"\nAnd I really didn't have a good answer and so I think that was one of the reasons.",
        "Q: After you became a citizen, what was it like for you -- and this would have been\nmore recently, when there were very open Nazi rallies in this country? What were\nyour thoughts about it?",
        "A: Well, I really think that the reaction to the Nazi rallies here have been wrong ones. I\nthink that one should let the people march, one should do what the Norwegians did\nwhen I was in Oslo. At one point, when they had a Nazi demonstration, the people\nall came out led by the bishop of Oslo and when the marchers walked by, all of the\npeople in the street turned their backs to them in silent demonstration, which to me is\nthe way they should be handled. If you start fights and everything, that's exactly\nwhat they want. And first of all, I think in this country we have enough other\nmechanisms to deal with it that we don't need to prohibit those marches. Let them,\nThomas Buergenthal 70\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 70\nbut deal with them with dignity and not pay any attention to them.",
        "Q: I realized you mentioned your sons and we should just clarify a little bit about your\nfamily. Maybe you can just tell us who's in your family, how many people.",
        "A: I have three sons, a stepdaughter and a stepson, and they're all over the world now.\nI'm married and it's my second marriage. My wife is originally from Peru but she has\nthe same sort of mixture that I am. She's a Peruvian, Italian, British background. We\nmet in Costa Rica. My oldest son is in Poland right now working for the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and he will actually be dealing\nwith the elections in Bosnia for the agency. So that, I thought it was interesting that\nat least one of us in the family is going back to his roots. I have one son who works\nhere in Washington, lives in Baltimore. A third son who is clerking for a federal\njudge in Ohio. My stepdaughter lives in Miami and my stepson lives in Costa Rica.\nWe have four grandchildren and a fifth one on the way.",
        "Q: The son who is in Poland, does he speak Polish?",
        "A: No, unfortunately not, I think he regrets that he never bothered to learn it. I,\nunfortunately, have pretty much forgotten much of my Polish. But he just got there.\nHe is a lawyer by training but he worked for AID!' in Costa Rica and has now\nmoved to Warsaw. It's probably more important for him to learn Russian because\nhe's responsible for issues relating to the rule of law all over the former Soviet\nThomas Buergenthal 71\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 71\nRepublics and eastern Europe. The headquarters of the organization is in Warsaw\nbut he has to be traveling all around.",
        "Q: Which languages do you speak now\u2019?",
        "A: Well I speak English and German. I can get along in Polish and I speak Spanish\nquite well, really, because I had to work in Spanish. But I learned Spanish when I\nfirst was elected to the court and I learned it by, not formally, I learned it by listening\nto the interpretation with one ear and to the original in the other. In the process I lost\nboth my Italian and my French. I can still get along in French.",
        "Q: Go back to when your sons were little, when they were about five or six or seven,\nmaybe eight. What were your thoughts? Would you look at them, they were little\nboys like you were, did it surprise you the things they did, did it make you think\nabout what you were like, and how much -- probably they were too young then but\nas they got older, how much did you tell them about what had happened to you, and\nhave you told them everything? Or does a person who's heard the Holocaust\nMuseum video tape, do they perhaps know a few more details about what you\nexperienced in the camps than they do, at this point?",
        "A: I think if you saw the Holocaust video tape, they might know more than my\nchildren. Although my children might know a lot of other details that they wouldn't\nknow. Did I tell them? I suppose on different occasions, different little snippets,\n'l Agency for International Development\nThomas Buergenthal 72\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 72\nparticularly when my mother used to come and visit we would reminisce. But\nprobably not as much either as I could have or as I should have but at the same time\nyou really as a parent, you know, you can't just try to drum things into kids\u2019 heads\nand if they don't want to ask, there's nothing much to tell. I think their interest is\ngradual, has really come more recent. But maybe, you know, I never know, because\nit may well be that they were afraid to ask, that they thought it would be painful,\nalthough it never has been because in our family we always talked about these\nthings. But maybe they didn't want to ask for a variety of reasons. They certainly, I\ndon't think, can really imagine what it was and they never really asked that kind of\nthing. There was something else you asked me that I've forgotten, the first part. It\nwill come back.",
        "Q: For instance, have you ever --",
        "A: Oh, yes, I remember what you asked me, about when I looked at my children, how I\nwould react. Well, you know, every so often when children were sort of my age, I\nwould look at them and I would think, could they survive this? You know, this is the\nage and look, they are such children and this was the age that I was when this\nhappened. Then you somehow think, yes, they could have. When you see street\nchildren in Latin America, how street-smart they are and how they survive, you\nrealize kids have that in them. I've seen this in Brazil, I've seen it in other places, in\nGuatemala. These kids have that survival instinct. But when you look at sort of, our\nThomas Buergenthal 73\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 73\nchildren you say, \u201cNo, they could never make it.\u201d But the fact is they could. There's\ntremendous resilience that children have, some children. Some children may be\nmore sensitive than others but I think children are blessed with this resilience that\nenables them to survive better than grown-ups can survive in many situations.",
        "Q: Obviously you lost your childhood in many ways. Is it something you got back later\non? An example would be, when you're that young you still want to be held a lot.\nDid anybody ever hold you when you were a little boy in the camps or is that\nsomething you just lost?",
        "A: No, nobody held me except my mother and father. But it's interesting, when I came\nback when I found my mother, I think the first year I just stuck to her as if, you\nknow, I kissed her all the time. It was sort of all coming back. But of course I missed\na lot. At the same time, you know, it's sort of curious but I think -- I did eight years\nof school in one year of private tutoring and it turns out I have dyslexia which I\nnever realized I had. One of my children has that problem and he suffered quite a lot\nbecause it appeared in first grade and second grade; it was a problem. I didn't know I\nhad it until he was tested and the doctor tested me and it turned out that my case was\njust as serious as his but because I started so much later, I just learned how to\ncompensate for it. So there are a lot of things that, there were also benefits. Just to\nthink of all the eight years of school one could have skipped without supposedly any\ngreat loss of learning. Although I have always kidded by the fact that I never really\nThomas Buergenthal 14\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 74\nlearned the alphabet properly. I never learned the ABC and stuff, all of these little\nthings that you learned in grade school I never learned.",
        "Q: No, you just have a doctorate degree in international law from Harvard.",
        "A: Yes. It shows you that it's not that difficult, that it must be that all you have to do is\njust skip enough classes.",
        "Q: It is amazing, and I thought this about an hour and half ago, how much we're\nlaughing in this discussion.",
        "A: Well, this is what I try to tell you, that those of us who went through it all went\nthrough it because we were lucky in everything else. But also in a sense, and I'm still\nable to talk about it today, is because we weren't just weighed down by the\nterribleness of it, that we didn't let it affect our whole life. One has to be able to\nlaugh about things, get raving mad. And some things are funny, some things are sad.",
        "Q: Some studies have been done on children of Holocaust survivors and some have\ncharacteristics, and one is depression, is that something that has occurred in your\nfamily and do you see a link there if it has?",
        "A: Fortunately, not at all, no. It may be because I have never been very introspective so\nit hasn't affected my children. No, not at all. They are\u2014no, I don't think it has\naffected them at all, at least not in any negative way that I can think of. Maybe if the\nHolocaust survivor\u2019s husband and wife -- that might be. But, you know, my wife\nwas a native-born American who hasn't gone through any of this and I think that\nThomas Buergenthal 75\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 75\nmay make a difference, although I'm not even sure. I think it depends on the family,\nit depends on the attitude of people.",
        "Q: What about religion? When you brought your children up, not just religion, Jewish\nculture -- how did you convey that to them as they were growing up? Did you make\nsort of a specific effort to do that and how so?",
        "A: Well, I wanted the children to grow up Jewish and so they went to Sunday School,\nthey were Bar Mitzvahed, and all of this. But they were not in a Jewish home in a\nsense that I'm not religious at all. I think my children are more religious, at least two\nof my sons often drag me to a temple on the High Holidays and chide me if I don't\ngo. I think what I try to do which 1s sort of natural, that I try to bring them up in the\nJewish sense from a cultural point of view, that they should have historical sense of\nwhat Judaism means and the contribution of Judaism to culture. And they shouldn't\nbe ashamed of it, that it's something like any other culture, to be proud of.",
        "Q: Where did you raise them primarily?",
        "A: First in Buffalo. I lived in, I taught, except for the first year I taught one year at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania law school and then I taught for 13 years in Buffalo at\nthe State University of New York. And then I taught at the University of Texas, in\nAustin. Then I came to Washington, I was dean at the American University Law\nSchool. Then I left Washington and worked with President Carter at the Carter\nCenter and taught at Emory, the Emory University, then I came here.\nThomas Buergenthal 76\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 76",
        "Q: How often do you think about being in the camps? Is that something that happens a\nlot?",
        "A: No, not really. It happens only if there was some reason that would bring it out. Not\nvery much at all, only if there 1s some sort of specific event that triggers something,\nbut otherwise I don't think about it at all.",
        "Q: Are there sounds that will really bring it out, or something that will just bring back a\nmemory? We talked earlier about the smell of bread. What about sounds or smells?",
        "A: Not really, more events. You know if you read about or if you see, for example, if\nyou see the people behind the barbed wire in Bosnia, that brings it back, those types\nof things. But not anymore. Maybe some things you read about and some German\nwords or something, that might trigger something. But really probably there be\nmonths will go by that I don't think about it at all, it doesn't come back at all.",
        "Q: What about being on a train, just going on a regular American Amtrack train?",
        "A: You know, I haven't been on an American Amtrack train for a long time but I've\nbeen on trains in Europe. No, it doesn't, you know the trains are so comfortable\ncompared to the train I was on, the trains I was on. No that doesn't. It does\nsometimes when I see one of those railroad cars, those sort of open cattle cars, that\nbrings back flashbacks. Or I might even say, you know, \"This looks almost like the\ncar I was in.\" But no, not as much as one would think.",
        "Q: Returning to...\nThomas Buergenthal 77\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 77",
        "A: Although you know, let me tell you something that strikes me. I think I mentioned it\nbefore. I am much more sensitive to some of these issues as I get older and I don't\nknow why that is, 1t bothers me in a sense because I've been able to sort of -- I've\nalways prided myself of being able to just put 1t out of my mind. In the sort of last\nten years its, I find it harder to do and I don't know why that is. You know,\nsometimes people when they get very old they suddenly only remember the\nlanguage they spoke when they were little. I don't know what it is but it's strange, I\nsometimes feel I'm going soft because I've been able just to put things very much out\nof my mind all my life. I find I'm much more sensitive now. Certain things bother\nme more you know.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: No, I find the death of my mother affected me tremendously and since then, I've\nfound that things relating to the camp are much harder for me to take than they were\nbefore. I haven't been able yet, I've been thinking a lot about why that should be that\nthis connection, but it's there. It's had quite an impact on me in terms of those\nmemories. Not only, obviously anyone who's mother dies is affected by it but it's\naffected me in terms of the past, much more than I would have thought. Or it's\nsimply old age, I don't know.",
        "Q: When did your mother die?",
        "A: In '93, no I'm sorry, '92.\nThomas Buergenthal 78\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 78",
        "Q: That's what I wanted to ask you. Are there some things you'd like to say that I\nhaven't touched on?",
        "A: No, you've been very good in getting more out of me than usual, no. Just think\nabout, I think you've -- you know it's strange, there are days when, it sometimes\ndepends on the environment but I think we've spent, gee we've spent about three and\na half hours and you've pretty much covered my life in sort of, in episodes.\nConclusion of Interview.\n"

    "questions": [
        "Question: I'm just going to have you say your name and when you were born.",
        "Q: I'm going to speak with you today mostly about the period after the war and\nliberation, but I do have one question about the time that you spent in concentration\ncamp, which is this: at the period when you were still with your mother and father,\ndid they ever sit you down and, in essence, sort of give you advice on how to\nsurvive, try to teach you a survival strategy, or did they themselves know what\nactually might work in that situation?",
        "Q: There was a point where you had been separated from your mother and you were\nable to see your mother briefly, in a concentration camp. Did she say anything at that\npoint, give you any advice?",
        "Q: In listening to your testimony that you gave on video tape, I was struck by how you\nwere able to be in a situation and make the best of it, for instance, by becoming an\nerrand boy to one of the German soldiers or to a Kapo; or later, right around\nliberation, you became a mascot to a group of Polish soldiers, and every time there\nyou are 1n those situations. How did you end up in those situations?",
        "Q: You say that you grew up in the camps, and certainly, when your life was disrupted,\nyou were about five I believe -- and then, you were about ten I believe -- and correct\nme if I'm wrong, when the last place you were was liberated. How did you grow up,\nwhat happened to you, who was the little boy when your life was disrupted, and who\nwas that boy or boy adult when the camps were liberated?",
        "Q: This is in Kielce?",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "Q: And in that case, instead of running away or trying not to be noticed, you went right\ninto the belly of the beast. You went right face-to-face with the danger.",
        "Q: At that point, a young boy, you might have felt angry or even intense hatred for the\nGermans. What was it like to work for one, one-on-one as an errand boy, and how\ndid you cope with that?",
        "Q: And you weren't afraid to do that that they might come out of the tent and see you\nplaying with the bike?",
        "Q: Were you ever afraid that you yourself would just arbitrarily get beaten, or perhaps",
        "Q: Let's move on now to the point at liberation, and if you can, just situate us. Where\nwere you, how old were you, and what kind of physical state were you 1n?",
        "Q: In what language?",
        "Q: Let's go back a couple steps. I'm curious about what else the Russian said, what was\nthat scene, like when the Russian soldier gonged the bell. Did people come out and\nstand around, then did you guys hug each other? Was there a feeling that you were\nreally liberated at that point, or did that come a little bit later?",
        "Q: And when you had hooked up with the young Polish boy and you were moving\naround in the town outside of Sachsenhausen, did you feel frightened that Germans\ncould come up and recapture you, perhaps? What was the mood like, or were you\njust sitting back with your feet up on the table in these homes and having a nice\ntime?",
        "Q: Tell us about that. First you met some soldiers from the Polish army, tell us about\nthat. How did you meet them and then what happened?",
        "Q: So here you are, you're a little boy, probably less than six weeks ago you had been\non a death march out of Auschwitz and all of a sudden you're dressed, you have a\nuniform, and you're riding a miniature pony with Polish army division.",
        "Q: Tell us more about the eating. What could you eat, and how did that gradually\nchange? Was there some food that was more comforting than others, or when you\nwere able to be around larger amounts of food, perhaps with the Poles, the Polish\narmy division, were there some types of foods that you began to really want to have\nan appetite for?",
        "Q: Did it bother you that you had been deprived of food for so long? You must have\nfantasized about food or talked about it, and then you could finally eat more freely,\nand you weren't hungry?",
        "Q: Did you find when you were younger, that you ate quickly, as if someone might take\nthe food away from you?",
        "Q: Can the smell of it or the taste of it, does it bring back memory flashes?",
        "Q: That's interesting. So instead of resenting or hating the bread because it's all you had,\nyou actually sort of cherish it.",
        "Q: Does your family recognize that about you, the kind of attachment to bread, and will\nthey tease you about it or even get a little frustrated with you: \u201cWhy are you holding\nonto these bread crusts?\u201d\n> Bread (Polish).",
        "Q: Can you tell us now about being a young boy just liberated from Sachsenhausen and\nyou have hooked up with this group of Polish soldiers? War is not over and you are\nwith them and you go essentially into military situations with them. Tell us about\nthat.",
        "Q: Were you frightened at that point and you wished that you had not hooked up with\nthese Polish soldiers?",
        "Q: What was it like for you to see the German soldiers brought into custody, taken\nprisoners? What were your feelings toward them? Did you feel like you wanted to\ngo up and say something to them about what you had experienced yourself?",
        "Q: Did you talk at all about what you had just went through or did you plunge yourself\ninto this new life? Did anyone say, \"What was it like for you to be in one of these\nconcentration camps?\" Was anybody talking to you about that at that point or did\nyou feel a need, a desire to talk about it?",
        "Q: Actually something you just said raises a question. Did you feel Jewish and if so,\nhow so? I mean, had you been able to in any way affirm your identity as a Jew in\nthis period or were you really too little to have been given that by your parents?",
        "Q: What happens after the Polish army division pulls back from the battle of Berlin?\nWhat happens to you? What is going on at that point?",
        "Q: Were you sad to be taken away from the army garrison?",
        "Q: Describe arriving at the orphanage. What did it look like? What did you look like?\nWere you in your little military uniform at that point?",
        "Q: When you describe yourself being in the group of the tough orphans, it sounds like\nwhen you were young, when you were ten and just coming out of the concentration\ncamp, there was almost a certain amount of pride, that you had survived and that you\ncould handle yourself in these situations. Almost kind of the feelings of a young man\nand after all you were still a little boy.",
        "Q: That's an interesting thought, I'm not sure I've really heard that before.",
        "Q: You said that you played games at the orphanage. What kind of games, and what\nwas that like for you? After all you'd been working, you'd been an errand boy, you'd\nbeen a mascot to an army division. What was that like for you to have your day\nfilled with eating a lot of food and playing?",
        "Q: How much did people ask you about what your life had been like, for instance, in\nAuschwitz, and did you have a feeling that they were trying to find out information\nperhaps for later, for war crime trials or perhaps just to comfort you, to see if you'd\nexperienced any trauma?",
        "Q: You were speaking about the Norwegian Odd Nansen. Actually he described you as\na very beautiful young boy\u2014\u2018pre-Raphaelite\u201d is how he described you -- and he\nsaid that the only way he saw any anxiety was in your hands and that you had the\nhands of an old man.",
        "Q: And in fact, he was living it also but what struck him was that you were such a little\nboy and that you might have walked with a canister of gas to the crematorium.",
        "Q: You say that often you describe things in a matter-of-fact way. I wonder though that\nkind of being around death all the time -- you've just described a little bit ago about\nseeing the Russian soldiers and the German soldiers and you must have seen many\nbodies in the camps. Is that something that became matter of fact for you also?",
        "Q: Have you ever been to the Holocaust Museum?",
        "Q: Can you tell us what it was like to go back to Kielce, that is, where you were in the\nwork camp and then there was the massacre? That was where you were in the ghetto\nand then there was the massacre that you survived there.",
        "Q: This was -- you're talking about the tattoo that you got when you did arrive in",
        "Q: I want to go back to the point where you are in the orphanage. Tell us how you were\nreconnected with your mother and any details that you know that were told to you in\nretrospect. How was the tracing actually done?",
        "Q: Do you remember the moment that someone came and told you, \"Your mother's\nalive, she's in this place and we are going to take you to her?\"",
        "Q: So it was your mother.",
        "Q: And what did that letter say?",
        "Q: So the orphanage said, \"Fine, his mother is alive.\" And now I'd like to know a little\nmore detail about getting smuggled out of Poland and into -- again it seemingly this\nshould have been easy for you to be reunited with your mother but here you are\nagain in these dangerous situations.",
        "Q: So, resume, how did your mother recognize you?",
        "Q: Do you remember some of the first things you talked about in those first few\nmoments?",
        "Q: So then your mother took you home. Had you ever been to where she was living\nbefore?",
        "Q: And, in a sense, it hadn't been that long since you hadn't seen your mother but in\nanother sense you had become essentially a man who figured out how to make his\nway in the middle of this war. How did she react to that? You must have been very\nindependent by that point, not her little boy anymore.",
        "Q: And so there was a kind of -- let's catch up and what happened to you. Where you\ndid sort of sit down and just really debrief with each other?",
        "Q: Because after all life does happen.",
        "Q: At that point what did you know about the fate of your father? Was it still a mystery,",
        "Q: So that was a situation where perhaps the Germans were going to surrender or leave\nand they just emptied out the camps by killing people?",
        "Q: How did you find that out? Did people tell you that who were there or did you\nresearch it later in life?",
        "Q: So was there a point -- then finally you knew about your father -- where you stepped\nback and took a sort of time to mourn him in any way, you and your mother\ntogether? I'm not sure how.",
        "Q: When you think back to when you finally got to Germany and you're with your\nmother, those first few days, and you're looking around and all of a sudden your life\nis beginning to look a little more normal, do you, I mean, was there one moment\nwhen you sort of remember looking around, maybe going to a market with your\nmother and saying, \"Okay, this is pretty normal, my life is normal now?\"",
        "Q: When you first got there and you had to brush up on your German and you had a\nGerman tutor, how did you feel about that? I mean you were after all learning this\nlanguage that you must, at that point, you might have associated with the camps and\nkind of negative things.",
        "Q: Did you ever consider removing your tatoo?",
        "Q: When you were beginning to integrate yourself into this German town, how open\nwere you about being Jewish, about being a survivor of the camps and was it\nsomething that people talked about or were people saying, \"Some of that's\nexaggeration, it didn't really happen\"? What was going on then in terms of your\nexperience?",
        "Q: What would you tell them, would you be honest?",
        "Q: Did you ever have any fear that if you were very open about who you were about as\na Jew, or confronted any authority, that somehow the rug could get pulled out from\nunder you again, that you could be persecuted for being Jewish?",
        "Q: So you had gotten strong now, you grew strong again, healthy?",
        "Q: Did your mother have a strategy for keeping you healthy in terms of cooking? Was it\na kind of concentrated effort?",
        "Q: How did your mother earn money? What was she doing at this point?",
        "Q: Were there any military Allied troops at all in your town, or did you have any sense\nof a military presence there?",
        "Q: How did they know you?",
        "Q: How aware of you -- were you -- of the rest of the sort of post-war period? Were you\nfor instance following the Nuremberg trial and were you aware of Albert Speer?\u2019\nWas that something you were following or were you --",
        "Q: At this point is your life beginning to be normal? You were about 13, 14, 15, but\nwere you ever having nightmares at anything or at that point did you have memories\nthat plagued you, I suppose?",
        "Q: Were you comfortable in Germany?",
        "Q: When you began to have those thoughts, what was your mother saying? What were\nher feelings about being separated again?",
        "Q: Tell us about your uncle, his name first of all, and how you first came here. How did\nyou actually get here? Did you come on a boat or did you fly?",
        "Q: Did you speak any English at this point?",
        "Q: What were your other languages?",
        "Q: And just to clarify, the boat that you came over on, this was formerly a group of\nrefugees who were given permission to come over and you came as a group?",
        "Q: What was your first view of the United States, literally? Was it of Ellis Island and\nthe Statue of Liberty?",
        "Q: So you did flashback on Auschwitz.",
        "Q: What did you decide to study when you went to college? As we've pointed out\nbefore, you went to Bethany college in West Virginia on a scholarship. When did\nyour interests begin to take shape?",
        "Q: And as you started to study the law, how did your interest in it take shape? Did you\never at one point think you might be a trial lawyer or some other type of lawyer?",
        "Q: Where we are is, I want to go back with a couple questions about college as we're\nmoving into your choice of law as a career. What were you drawn to in terms of\nwhat you wanted to study in college? What kinds of things were you finding",
        "Q: What was appealing to you about the law? I mean when you actually started to sink\nyour teeth into it and you're studying it every day and verbally, I suppose, debating",
        "Q: What was the atmosphere at that time -- the sort of attitude about international law --",
        "Q: When would you say you began to develop a philosophy of human rights law and\nthat you saw that emerge in your ideals in the kinds of choices you were making and\nthe cases you were bringing? And what is your philosophy, I suppose?",
        "Q: I'm not sure most people would make that connection unless they had your\nexperience in the camps, that there was a kind of similar, I guess, brutality going on\nbetween treatment of people in the camps and what happened during the worst of the\ncivil war in El Salvador.",
        "Q: How do you think your personal experiences shape -- how do you think your\npersonal experiences shape what you actually decide to do in certain situations with\na case? Perhaps when you're sitting on a court -- or maybe the link is not that direct.",
        "Q: Do you ever have moments when you think, \"I'm tired of this, I'm just tired of this.\nI've in a sense been looking at this kind of stuff my whole life, since I was a little\nboy, and that I would like to be looking at shipping contracts or something\u201d\u201d?",
        "Q: Have you ever written about your personal experience, whether it would be for some\nsort of publication, or even maybe perhaps for your family?",
        "Q: Fiction or nonfiction?",
        "Q: You said, \"It's obvious that it should be written down.\" You said that just a while\nago. Then you just said, \"It should be written down.\" Why?",
        "Q: It seems that that's been a struggle from day one, that the Allied forces actually took\nGermans and showed them the camps at a certain point. Have you ever in your own",
        "Q: Are you an American citizen?",
        "Q: They asked that specific question?",
        "Q: After you became a citizen, what was it like for you -- and this would have been\nmore recently, when there were very open Nazi rallies in this country? What were\nyour thoughts about it?",
        "Q: I realized you mentioned your sons and we should just clarify a little bit about your\nfamily. Maybe you can just tell us who's in your family, how many people.",
        "Q: The son who is in Poland, does he speak Polish?",
        "Q: Which languages do you speak now\u2019?",
        "Q: Go back to when your sons were little, when they were about five or six or seven,\nmaybe eight. What were your thoughts? Would you look at them, they were little\nboys like you were, did it surprise you the things they did, did it make you think\nabout what you were like, and how much -- probably they were too young then but\nas they got older, how much did you tell them about what had happened to you, and\nhave you told them everything? Or does a person who's heard the Holocaust\nMuseum video tape, do they perhaps know a few more details about what you\nexperienced in the camps than they do, at this point?",
        "Q: For instance, have you ever --",
        "Q: Obviously you lost your childhood in many ways. Is it something you got back later\non? An example would be, when you're that young you still want to be held a lot.\nDid anybody ever hold you when you were a little boy in the camps or is that\nsomething you just lost?",
        "Q: No, you just have a doctorate degree in international law from Harvard.",
        "Q: It is amazing, and I thought this about an hour and half ago, how much we're\nlaughing in this discussion.",
        "Q: Some studies have been done on children of Holocaust survivors and some have\ncharacteristics, and one is depression, is that something that has occurred in your\nfamily and do you see a link there if it has?",
        "Q: What about religion? When you brought your children up, not just religion, Jewish\nculture -- how did you convey that to them as they were growing up? Did you make\nsort of a specific effort to do that and how so?",
        "Q: Where did you raise them primarily?",
        "Q: How often do you think about being in the camps? Is that something that happens a\nlot?",

        "Answer: Thomas Buergenthal, born in Czechoslovakia -- Lubochnia, Czechoslovakia.\nToday it's Slovakia.",
        "A: Well, I -- not really in any sort of formal sense, at least, I don't remember it. Of\ncourse, as a child, you probably learn much more from observing than you do from\nbeing told things. But I do remember my father saying -- when we were -- when he\nand I were left alone -- that the one thing that was critical was not to eat food that\nwas dirty or contaminated. That's the only sort of thing I remember because a lot of\npeople would try to eat things out of garbage cans, and then of course get sick. He\nalways warned me about that. Otherwise, I really can't think of them sort of telling\nme \u201cYou should do this or that,\u201d but one of course saw a lot of things that one had to\ndo. I observed my father, who's great strength was that, that you could see that he\nalways thought things out before he did it, and he would not be sort of cowed into\nThomas Buergenthal 2\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 2\nrunning but he would make his decision and then stick by it and that was something\nI noticed, that a lot of people got killed or were caught because they acted too fast.\nThey didn't sort of take account of the environment and then act. That's something\nhe did; he was a master at that.",
        "A: No, but, you know, I think both my father and mother sort of knew that I -- I had sort\nof grown up in the camp. And they probably knew that there wasn't any advice that\nthey could give me that I sort of, that I hadn't already been doing. Really the only\nadvice or the only goal of our life, the long-term goal, was to stay alive, and the\nshort-term goal was to have something to eat that day. And that was -- so survival\nwas the long-term goal. But I really can't remember that they said it, or for that\nmatter that they had to say it. I think they probably knew that I knew what had to be\ndone.\nThomas Buergenthal 3\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 3",
        "A: You know, it's hard to say. I've never thought about it, but as I said, I'd grown up in\nthe camp and it seemed that sort of the -- that there were certain things you had to do\nin order to be able to survive, and in order to be in the position where you could\nsurvive, and those things sort of came naturally. I don't know, I must say I've never\nthought about it. The mascot part -- this was after liberation -- there that was really\nnot planned at all or\u2014because what happened was that I was liberated and we met\nthese Polish soldiers and they knew that I spoke Polish, and they thought I was\nPolish, and they took me with them. And then sort of the mascot part came naturally.\nSo I can't claim any credit for having known what I was doing, at that stage.",
        "A: Well, we, of course, were already on the run from 1939 on, and I remember very\nlittle from that period. I was born in 1934, so in '39 I was five years old. I was a\nscared little boy, that's all I remember. I remember our crossing the border from\nCzechoslovakia into Poland and worrying that something would happen to my father\nand knowing my father and mother were very worried about what was going to\nhappen; being fascinated by some of the new languages I heard -- Yiddish for the\nThomas Buergenthal 4\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 4\nfirst time in my life in Poland. Really, I didn't start sort of facing the reality of the\nwar and what it meant, and sort of the reality of trying to survive, until probably\n1943, because in the ghetto still, when we survived the first in 1942, when they,\nwhen they dissolved the ghetto and sent most of the people to Treblinka.",
        "A: This is in Kielce, in Poland. I was still very much sort of part -- I would do what my\nparents wanted me to do and I would be the child that did what had to be done. And\nin '43 I sort of began to be aware that I had to -- even though I was still with my\nparents -- that I had to do certain things on my own in order to survive. And then, of\ncourse, when I was left --",
        "A: Such as, well, for example, when we were in 1943, we were in a work camp, and\nwhen that camp was dissolved, the initial thing was that I had to hide in order not to\nbe seen by the Gestapo because they were taking all of the children away. And then\nwhat happened, I actually survived this: they saw me of course, we were all lined up\non one of these fields in Kielce, and they start pulling me, and my father pulled me\nback. And then my father took me to the chief of the Gestapo, who was standing in\nfront of everybody, and said to him, \"This is my son.\" And this man looked at me,\nand I said to him, in German, \"I can work.\" And, you know, it just came out of me.\nHow do you say it in German? \u201cIch kann arbeiten\u2019\u2019? And his response in German\nThomas Buergenthal 5\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 5\nwas \"Na, das wollen wir mal sehen\u201d -- \u201c\u201cLet\u2019s see\u201d -- and he let me live. This was -- I\nwas the only one of the children from that -- from Kielce who survived that way.\nThere were two others who hid in the house where they took all of the children. And\nthat was sort of the beginning of my awakening to the fact that I was going to have\nto save my own life.",
        "A: Well, that, in part, that was really my father's doing, who, who, who had sort of\nanalyzed the Germans and knew that you had to often confront them in certain ways\nand that they had great, sort of, difficulty with their own propaganda and with the\nreality. Here was a kid who spoke German the way their own children spoke\nGerman, who didn't look as Jewish as they perceived Jews to look from Der\nStuirmer, which was the German sort of propaganda newspaper. And suddenly to\nhave this kid talk to them, it personalized it. And I think this was my father's -- he\nsort of contributed to my doing what I did. He must have said himself, \"You have\nto.\" Maybe he -- I don't remember, maybe he said, \"You have to tell them you can\nwork.\" It could well be, but it worked. And after that, in Auschwitz again, the first\ntime, when I worked for the Kapo that, the Kapo was somebody my father had\nknown before, because it was a man who had been in the ghetto with us in Kielce\nand was shipped out of the ghetto to Auschwitz two years before we did. So, by the\nThomas Buergenthal 6\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 6\ntime we came to Auschwitz, he was a Kapo -- quite a brutal one. But he treated his\nfriends well, and he sort of took me in. It was a terrible sort of society, to live. But\nthat helped. I also -- in Kielce still, I worked as an errand boy for the man who ran\nthat work camp, and I must -- I don't know how that came about. But what I\nremember -- I don't know whether I told it on tape, I probably did -- I used to sit\noutside his office and he would listen to the radio and I would listen, and would sort\nof report to my parents on the news because we had no news, of course. So I became\nthe one who tried to memorize all the news that I heard on the German radio, and\nreport it to my father and mother and I suppose through them, to the other people in\nthe camp. I even reported on the fact that Mussolini had been captured and they\ndidn't believe me -- of course they thought this kid is imagining things.",
        "A: You know, I didn't have to cope at all, that's the curious thing. He was a very, he was\nvery nice to me. He never mistreated me. But he was quite brutal. He would beat\npeople if he saw them not working. And so I figured out he would do that and so\nwhen he made his inspection tours, I would just really sort of run ahead and make\ncertain motions. He had a hat with a feather and I would motion to people that the\nfeather was coming so everybody started to work, so -- because I had seen him beat\nThomas Buergenthal 7\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 7\na lot of people if he caught them not working. But he wasn't, he wasn't, never abused\nme, never mistreated me. That's strange, you know, as a child I remember he used to\nhave a visit from some officer of the SS who would arrive with a bicycle, and he\nwould hand me the bicycle, to take the bicycle and put it in the bicycle stand. And\nbelieve it or not, in all this environment in which we lived, I learned to ride the bike\nwith this SS man's bicycle. You know, a child 1s a child.",
        "A: I must say, I thought about it, but then I figured when he told me to take it and as\nlong as I didn't break it, I was all right. You know, the fear factor was not -- the fear\nfactor was one of survival and not of sort of what could happen in between for doing\nthis or doing that. Because I really, when I think back, I was not afraid and not\nbecause I'm not a person who's not afraid, but because it just didn't seem there was\nany reason to be afraid. There were many reasons in the camp to be afraid, but not to\nthese sort of episodes. I was describing to my class -- they asked me the other day --\nI remember breaking in with a friend of mine in Auschwitz and in the kitchen of the\nSS and stealing milk, which was the first milk I had drunk, we had a cup of milk in\ntwo years. And if we had been caught we would have been beaten to death, but it\nsort of: there was the milk and we had to drink it.\nThomas Buergenthal 8\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 8\nbe chosen to go into the crematorium? After all, you saw this happen often, every\nday. Did you imagine that happening to you?",
        "A: Well, first of all, beaten. You know, one got beaten because one pushed in the\nfood line, and then they swung the stick and I was beaten on my back, but nothing\nreally very serious. No, the fact that one thought, that I thought I would die in there,\nthat was a reality. And it happened quite a number of times, where the risk existed\nand I knew exactly what was going to happen. As a matter of fact, I was in situations\nwhere I thought I was finished, there was no way out. No, that fear, and that fear was\ntremendous. Until, you know, once I hit a moment when I realized there was nothing\nmore to do, I couldn't escape anymore, and suddenly a tremendous peace came over\nme, I thought I was going to die. I had done everything possible not to get caught\nand there was no escape, and I sort of made peace with myself and with death at that\npoint. But it didn't last very long. You know, the survival instinct comes right back.",
        "A: I was at liberation, in the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen which is about 20\nkilometers outside of Berlin. And by that time I had survived the death march but\nlost -- I had frostbite, and was operated actually, in an infirmary of Sachsenhausen.\nThey had sort of a hospital set up, because it was one of these model camps,\ndemonstration camps, where they would keep people and could show that they were\nThomas Buergenthal 9\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 9\nactually treating people well, but at the same time would execute people and do\neverything else. But it was a model camp, and I was there. I had two toes amputated.\nAnd then when the war was coming to a close, the Germans decided to evacuate the\ncamp. But those of us who couldn't really walk very much, and some people were\nmuch sicker than I, we were left behind in the hospital. And the assumption was that\nthey were going to come and shoot all of us; this was sort of, we all expected that\nwas going to happen. I was able to move. I had a crutch or a cane or something, so I\nthink I was operated maybe three weeks before, or so. It was strange, after the\nevacuation of the camp, it was very strange but it was very quiet. And then you\nbegin to hear artillery fire coming closer. And I think I went to sleep, evacuation\nmust have been the day before. The next morning I got up and it was very, very\nquiet except for the shooting coming closer. I crawled out, went out and looked up\nand saw in the entrance of the camp, over the entrance on the inside -- they always\nhad a machine gun mounted with SS guards sitting on, and there was nobody there,\nthe machine gun was empty. I came back and told people. Of course, nobody\nbelieved that this was happening. And then we just waited and the shooting came\ncloser. Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in\nthe early afternoon -- we heard the gong, the camp had a big bell in the middle of\nthis field, and a Russian soldier had driven in with a jeep and was ringing the bell\nsaying, \u201cYou're free.\u201d\nThomas Buergenthal 10\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 10",
        "A: I don't really know. It must have been in Russian, but Russian and Polish 1s\nrelatively close. And the instructions were that we were free, we could go anyplace\nwe wanted except not this way because that's where the Germans still were, so you\ngo the other way. And the first thing that we did was to storm the place with the SS\nkept their supplies. And people, of course, these were all people who were quite sick\nand everybody dragged themselves to the supply place and people began to eat. It\nwas very lucky for me that I couldn't eat. I remember finding a pickle. There was\nbread and everything else and all I could eat was a pickle. It probably saved my life\nbecause a lot of people ate and not having eaten for a long time, just gorged\nthemselves and got quite sick and many of them died. I didn't. I just couldn't\nswallow. And then sort of a day later, there was a young Pole, must have been in his\nearly 20s and I\u2014we -- decided we were going to leave. So we just went out on the\nroad and started moving, then we were joined by some other people, there were\nsome women, also from -- I don't know where they came, but Polish women. And\nwe -- the houses -- this was the city of where the camp is, Sachsenhausen, 1s\nOranienberg, and we must have been in the area of that, moving away from Berlin.\nThe German houses were standing empty because the Germans had fled, and often\ntimes the tables were still set, dirty dishes were sitting, and you could just occupy a\nhouse and we just moved from one house to the other, until these Polish soldiers\nThomas Buergenthal 11\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 11\ncame and started talking, they talked to the women, of course. And then they saw me\nand they said, \"Where are you going?\" I said that I didn't know where I was going, I\nwas trying to find my parents. And they said, \"Well where they would be?\" And I\nsaid, \"They would probably be in Poland,\" and so they took me with them.",
        "A: You know when I see pictures of people who are liberated by American troops, by\nBritish troops, they were liberated. We were none of these scenes as far as I\nremember. The Russians just told us, \"You can go.\" There was no effort made to\nhelp us in any way, to provide any medical services, and there was no hugging. I\ndon't remember, I mean we felt a great sense of relief because we expected to be\nshot, but none of that -- 1t was probably too, in retrospect, it was almost too much. It\nwas hard to believe that we were free after all this and that nothing had happened to\nus. No, I don't remember these scenes of liberation. I really don't remember even\nrealizing that I was liberated until the war was over because everybody started\nshooting into the air, and it came, sort of, on my birthday. But I didn't have any sense\nof the tremendous joy that other people must have experienced. I was alone in many\nways. I think that if my parents had been there it would have been different.\nThomas Buergenthal 12\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 12",
        "A: Well, where we were afraid, of course, was when we were still in the camp because\nwe didn't know what happened to the Germans, whether they would come back and\nwhether it was really true that they had left. But once we were out, I don't remember\nworrying about it. It seemed that it was over, and the fact that the Germans had just\ndisappeared without a trace, the soldiers, must have had that impact. But I just don't\nremember that maybe as a child you're liberated, you're free. No, I had no sense that\nthere was any danger from the Germans at that point. Of course, I then ended up,\nwhen I was a mascot, in the battle of Berlin, and that was quite -- there was a really\nalmost hand-to-hand combat and there it was quite dangerous.",
        "A: Well, they came to one of these houses, and I must say, it's hard for me to sort of\nremember very clearly, how it came about that they took me with them. But they\ndid. They were members of the First Polish Division, the so-called Kosciusko\nThomas Buergenthal 13\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 13\nDivision,\u2019 which had come from Russia. These were people apparently who had\nbeen, at least the officers, members of the Polish army in '39 who were then shipped\nto Siberia. And when the Russians needed troops, they were brought back and given\na chance to fight in the Polish army under Russian control. And I, so this was the\ngroup and I was in. The soldiers who took me in, they were members of the scout\ncompany, so we were sort of the forefront of the division. They took me in. They\ngave me -- they made me a small uniform and I had shoes. They even gave me a\nsmall revolver, another revolver -- a automatic pistol. They had found a circus horse\nsome place, a pony, and -- because much of the army was still horse-drawn. They\nhad supplies of the Russian and Polish army -- was still brought in by horse-drawn\ncarts. There was a lot of horses, and I had my horse and I could keep up with the\nsoldiers, and I had a wonderful time. One of the things I remember doing -- this was\na great sort of past time at that point, this shows you how children are children --\nshooting at things that I don't know whether people still know what that is -- the\nelectric wires and telegraph on poles are held up, wired around porcelain, white\nporcelain sort of, what would you call it, cups or -- . The big game was to shoot at\nthose things and shoot them down because, of course -- that was one of the pastimes\nI engaged in with my Polish soldiers. And also I learned, the one of the people who\n' The Taduesz Kosciusko Division, a soldiery comprised of Polish patriots under\nRussian command, appeared in July 1943.\nThomas Buergenthal 14\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 14\ntook care of me was a shoemaker for the company, another one was a tailor. And I\nthink -- I don't know whether I could still make a pair of shoes, but I actually\nobserved how you make shoes and I helped and I probably at one point could have\nmade a pair of shoes from scratch.",
        "A: It's -- when you think about it, it reads like, sounds like, a novel from Garcia\nMarquez,\u201d but it's true. And it, the strange thing is that the sort of, the absurdity of it,\nthe comic aspect of it never occurred to me as a child. Its -- you know, at the same\ntime, all of this I thought was going to lead to my being reunited with my parents,\nand I never even thought that this wasn't going to happen, this was all part of a\nprocess. In the meantime I could eat and I no longer had to be afraid and I had fun. I\nhad a horse. Actually, on the food, I should tell you that I, since I had no appetite and\nthe Poles were quite concerned that I couldn't eat, they started giving me, at first, a\nhalf a spoon of vodka, then a spoon of vodka, and that stimulated my appetite at the\npoint where I could really keep up with them to drinking vodka because it was my\nmedicine. That was sort of the only lingering thing that had survived from the camp.\nWell, of course, I had -- -my amputation was still\u2014I had to change bandages. I did\nThomas Buergenthal 15\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 15\nall of that myself. I don\u2019t even remember ever being taken to a doctor when I was\nliberated.",
        "A: No.\n[end of side one of tape one|\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: What I remember was the Poles would drink a lot of vodka, eat bread and smoked\nbacon with it. And that\u2019s the sort of food I remember eating\u2014a lot of bread, and\nbread, of course, I could eat, although I really didn\u2019t have much appetite. But with\nthe vodka, I ate and drank whatever they did, and I remember a lot of bacon, that the\npoles usually drink this with vodka. But there must have been other food, I just don't\nhave any memory. The only thing I remember is that when we stormed that place in\nSachsenhausen, still, that all I could eat was a pickle, and I hadn't eaten a pickle for a\n* Garcia Marquez, Gabriel Jos\u00e9 (1928-), author.\nThomas Buergenthal 16\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 16\nlong, long time.",
        "A: No, that never occurred to me. It occurs to me now when I know I shouldn't eat and I\nhave what I -- so now it's much more real. Now so often I think, oh here's all this\nfood that I could eat and as a child I was starving and couldn't eat it and now I'm not\nallowed to eat it or shouldn't eat it. But no, I didn't, and I think it has a lot to do with\nhaving, being a child and taking a lot of these things for granted. This was life and\nthis is what happened. One day you don't have anything to eat and the next day\nthere's suddenly food. But I remember though, for years afterwards, would always\nthink that you should always eat before you did anything of importance because you\nnever knew when you were going to eat again.",
        "A: That could be because I still eat quickly, probably too quickly. I don't know whether\nit's related to that or not. There were certain foods that, you know, bread of course,\nto this day good bread is something that I -- I always use the example that when I\nhear the word bread in German or Polish, I can smell it. It has sort of an emotion\nattached to it, whereas the English word for bread is a word that I learned, it's an\nThomas Buergenthal 17\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 17\nintellectual, is an intellectual concept, but it doesn't have all the emotion tied up with\nthe words chleb,* or the word Brot* in German, which was all of the things that I was\ndeprived of and that I needed the most. The one thing that I thought I would never\neat again would be turnips because we used to get turnip soup in Auschwitz, with a\nlittle piece of bread which was often the only meal we had. But now I find that even\nwell done turnip quite good.",
        "A: Not anymore. But good bread still brings back sort of feeling of how wonderful it is\nto be able to have this, which I didn't have because we really lived on bread. It was\nthe most important thing, and to this day, I really can't get myself to throw away\nbread. Stale bread is something that I find all kinds of excuses to let somebody else\nthrow it away.",
        "A: Oh, yes, very much so. The turnips I hated.\n* Bread (German).\nThomas Buergenthal 18\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 18",
        "A: No. The problem is that, of course, they know that for some reason, it must be poetic\njustice, that bread has the worst weight-gaining effect on me, and so I'm not really\nsupposed to eat it. I eat hardly any bread except for when I'm in Europe where my\ndiscipline goes. And they know that. Actually bread and sausages, which, of course,\nI can't eat because I had a bypass a few years ago. All of the things that I missed as a\nchild I can't eat now. It's a small price to pay for survival.",
        "A: Well, the first real military situation I got into was, I helped liberate Berlin. We came\ninto Berlin while the battle for Berlin was still raging and we were camped in the\npark near where the rocket artillery that the Russians had. We're shooting over at the\nGermans and the Germans were shooting back. And I slept in an armored car\nbecause there was still fighting going on, and as we drove into Berlin, you could see\nthere were Russian soldiers, dead soldiers on one side, Germans on the other. The\nbattle was still raging for about two days. But then of course, the Germans\nsurrendered and we actually took German prisoners at the end of the -- when Berlin\nfell. But during the battle, you know, people got killed. That was a danger that\nsomebody could get killed. Actually some people from our company who had\nThomas Buergenthal 19\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 19\nventured out on the street in the truck, the hand grenade was thrown -- because the\nGermans were still occupying the houses -- but nothing happened to me. I didn't\nparticipate in any of the fighting, I didn't shoot either. But we were counting because\nthese rocket-propelled grenades that the Russians had, the Kosciusko would shoot\nout, sort of, six or 12 at the same time, and they were supposed to be moving\nbecause you can very easily locate them. And we were concerned. I remember the\nPolish saying that they really should be moving because the Germans could find\nwhere they were and then start bombarding us and them. But the Germans, at that\npoint, German artillery was no longer very effective and nothing happened.",
        "A: Oh, no, I didn't wish that I hadn't hooked up, but I'm sure I was frightened, naturally,\nyeah. It's a long time ago, when you think this is in 1945, late April, beginning of\nMay of 1945; it's a long time. But I remember the concerns that we all had about\nGerman artillery hitting us.",
        "A: Well, I was delighted obviously, that they were prisoners of war and we were being\nguarded. I don't remember, first of all, I don't remember any of the Poles attacking\nThomas Buergenthal 20\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 20\nany of the German prisoners, and I don't remember having that feeling. I remember\nhaving that feeling very much when I came back and I was reunited with my mother\nin Germany and seeing -- we had a balcony in that town, my mother's home town in\nGermany, in Gottingen -- and sitting on the balcony on a Sunday and seeing the\nGerman families taking a walk and my father hadn't come back. And at that point,\nyou know, the desire of sort of seeing -- when I first came back I would love to\nmount the machine gun on that balcony and shoot all of them. But if I think back in\nBerlin of the German prisoners we took, I didn't have that feeling for some strange\nreason. It may have been too distant or... I remember there were negotiations going\non for the surrender of the Germans, and at one point it looked there was some\ndanger because there was a whole forest full of Germans as we were moving back\nand our company was quite exposed but the Germans wanted to surrender. And\nthese negotiations went on all night and I slept through the whole thing and when I\nwoke up in the morning, most of the German officers had merely negotiated in order\nto be able to escape. That's also I remember from that episode.",
        "A: No, actually I don't think anybody was talking about it because, of course, these\nThomas Buergenthal 21\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 21\npeople had come out of a Russian concentration camp, they had gone through the\nentire war, they knew what it was all about. If people talked about anything 1t would\nbe always to say, \u201cWhere are you from? \u201cWhere are your parents? \u201cWhat did you\ndo?\u201d There I always had to be very careful because I didn't want -- first of all, I\nwasn't sure it was a good idea to say that I was Jewish, and second I didn't think that\nit was a good idea to say I was born in Czechoslovakia, so they just assumed that I\nwas Polish. And so I sort of structured my own story that I came from Kielce, which\nwas the ghetto where we had been, and that I expected to find my parents back in\nKielce. That was sort of the extent of that conversation, but I must say, I don't\nremember very much of that period. It's strange; I have memories, sort of episodic\nmemory, but not chronological memory. So that I, if you say, \"Well what did you do\nthen and what did you do then,\" it's often that I just simply don't remember.",
        "A: No, I felt very much that I was Jewish but it's strange, my family was not a religious\nfamily at all. I had no religious education at all. Religion and Judaism became part of\nsurvival for me and I think that was part of what my father, my family brought me\nup. The Germans wanted to kill us because we were Jews and we were going to win\nthis battle with them as Jews and we were going to survive. And so the Judaism that\nThomas Buergenthal 22\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 22\nwas instilled in me was the Judaism that said that we were going to win over the\nGermans, we're not going to let them kill us and we were going to be proud of the\nfact that we can survive. I remember my father always saying, \"We are going to be\nalive long after they are six feet under.\" So in that sense, Judaism, the fact that we\nwere different, was part of the thing that helped us live. That was very strongly\ninstilled in me. But never religious, never from a religious point of view. But my\nfather was very much, very strong as a believer the fact that he was a Jew, but not a\nreligious Jew at all, neither was my mother.",
        "A: Well, we pull out of Berlin, eventually we are put on trains, again on trains, end up\nin an army camp in Poland, in a town called Siedlce, sort of a military garrison\nwhere I stay, I don't know really how long, it must have been a few weeks. But one\nof the Jewish soldiers from that company, who knew that I was Jewish and with\nwhom I spoke, then takes me to a Jewish orphanage in Otwock, near Warsaw, which\nshows you that I hid my Judaism one way but as far as the Jewish soldier and I were\nconcerned, I knew that I was Jewish and he knew that I was Jewish. And he took me\nto this orphanage where I stayed for a good year until I found my mother.",
        "A: Oh, in some ways, yes, because I have this sort of wonderful military life. Yes and\nThomas Buergenthal 23\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 23\nno. I -- again, you know, the strange thing is, 1s you ask these questions. Part of my\nlife or the way I used to think was that these things happened -- and you didn't spend\nmuch time thinking about them, very little introspection about events. You -- like,\nit's sort of like swimming. You're downstream, this is part of what has to be done. It\nnever occurred to me that I shouldn't leave. He said it was a good idea to go to the\norphanage and I went with him. The orphanage was actually, a lot of it was quite\nnice. Orphanages sound terrible but this one was where we were treated quite well.\nThat point is when I began to think that I would find my parents. Again you know,\nas a child there was a strong belief that I would find my parents.",
        "A: You know, I should have brought a picture. I still have a picture of my military\nuniform with this Polish soldier who eventually I think went to Israel. I must have\nbecause I had nothing else, so I must have arrived that way. I don't really remember\nthe arrival part but I do remember that I was sort of -- and that made it easier. I was\nthe only one there who had been in the camps. All the other kids had been hidden\nsome place or had come from Russia or some place. So I was sort of an oddity and\nthere was a lot of people asking questions, how was this. And the treatment was\nwonderful. I was still very thin and underweight and the cook in this place always\nmade sure I would get a whole cupful or a soup bowl of cream so that I could gain\nThomas Buergenthal 24\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 24\nsome weight. I don't think that was such a good idea in retrospect. And eggs, you\nknow, all of the things that I don't remember having. And of course the orphanage\nwas interesting because the orphanage was divided into sort of two types of kids.\nAnd, there were the real orphans, and I was considered one of the real orphans,\nwithout a mother and a father, and we were the tough kids. Then there were what we\nconsidered the weaklings because they had one parent but for some reason they were\nthere. And, I was the youngest of that group and was treated extremely well, had a\nlot of fun, played games. And again, sort of, unthinking about what the future was\ngoing to hold and always believing without really doubting it, questioning it, that\nsooner or later I would find my parents.",
        "A: No, I think that was very true. I think that was in part because I saw, and because of\nmy parents, I saw the fact that I survived as a victory, that we had won over them.\nThey wanted to kill us and we made it; we didn't give them the joy of killing us. So\nthere was a tremendous sense of satisfaction, that of survival, unlike what one reads\nnow that people supposedly feel bad that they survived and others didn't. We never\nThomas Buergenthal 25\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 25\nhad that feeling and neither did my mother because my mother survived. I mean we\nfelt very bad that, for example, my father didn't survive. He died just shortly before\nthe end of the war. But we never felt that guilty about the fact of surviving, on the\ncontrary. We were, it was a sense of satisfaction that we had survived. Really it was\na sense of victory, that we didn't let them kill us.",
        "A: I've never heard it. All I read about is people feeling guilty that they survived. I\nmean I can understand that, I can understand it in some ways, other ways I can't\nunderstand that. If you survive, honestly there's no reason you should feel guilty and\nwe certainly didn't. And really the people that I know from the camps never had that\nfeeling.",
        "A: It was wonderful. You know the strange thing is when I think back, here I had my\ntoes amputated and I played soccer. I played a lot of soccer, and I had the great\nadvantage because of my amputation I could also shoot with my left foot, so I was\none of the few kids who could shoot left and right. It -- the transition wasn't difficult\nat all. It was an easy transition. It would have been much harder the other way\nThomas Buergenthal 26\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 26\naround. That is, I think, an important thing. That I, if you were my age, the post\nsurvival period and the adjustment and the survival period was all much easier\nbecause in the camp I never thought like other people must have, my parents, how\nwonderful it was to eat a good meal or anything of that sort. And missing all of the\nconveniences that one had, I couldn't take it today. I've often thought that I couldn't\nsurvive today. But as a child, from my point of view, things got bad but then they\ngot so much better. And, I never thought back that there was any -- it came naturally\nand I didn't think about it.",
        "A: Well, in the orphanage, since I was the only one there who had been in the camps,\nthe people from newspapers and newsreels would come, and I was sort of a minor\ncelebrity. Whenever people would come to the orphanage I would be trotted out to\nask questions. But not because they wanted to comfort me or anything, it was just\nsomebody -- if they wanted to talk about the orphanage, this was an example.\nActually, you probably know that there was a book written, a diary in the camp, the\nman who wrote that diary and the excerpts from the diary, the parts that deal with\nme, he asked a lot of those questions. And when he describes interviewing me in the\nThomas Buergenthal 27\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 27\nhospital about Auschwitz, he was struck by the fact that it was all sort of reported in\nthe matter of fact way. I -- it's still like this to this day, I think in part because of my\nage or maybe I'm just totally insensitive to the experience but not very introspective\nabout it.",
        "A: And now I do. No -- and he described them as very nervous hands and I suppose\nthey still are probably to some extent. No, he was the only one in the camp that I\nremember asking me about things. And I was even -- I sort of thought, how strange\nthat somebody would ask me about these things since we were all living it and there\nwas nothing very unusual about it.",
        "A: Yes, of course, to me that was nothing very unusual or extraordinary, and to him it\nwas very different. He was a wonderful man and one of the few diaries written in the\ncamp on a day-to-day basis. I met him after the war. I found him after the war and\nwe stayed in touch until he died. He actually saved my life in many ways. And I'm\nstill in touch, whenever I'm in Norway, his son and I get together. Actually we were\nThomas Buergenthal 28\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 28\ntogether last year.",
        "A: Yes. Without necessarily saying that it was matter-of-fact in a way that you just\ndon't notice it. It was -- the death and seeing death in the camp and seeing people\ndying could not but affect one in the camp. But again as part of the self-defense\nmechanism, you tried not to think about it, you tried not to see it. Although, you\nknow, it's strange, I can talk about my experience in the camp, I can write about it. I\ncan't see movies about it. I can't read. A lot of things they affect me tremendously,\nincreasingly so. And I think in part because I must have sort of suppressed a lot of\nthings that come out now. But I'm struck by the fact how much more, how difficult\ncertain things are for me today than they were even 20 years ago. I, when I just even\nsee a snippet of a movie, say Schindler's List, they would show something on\ntelevision, I would break down. Despite the fact that I give the impression that\nnothing phases me, that I just simply can't take. For example certain Jewish music,\nreligious music, brings back memories of the camp that are very difficult for me, for\nexample, a ceremony at the Holocaust Museum, to stay without breaking down.\nEnd of Tape 1.\nThomas Buergenthal 29\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 29\nThomas Buergenthal 30\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 30\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: Well, actually I've not been able. I haven't had the courage to walk through. I've been\nthere, I've given a talk, I've been in the auditorium, but I haven't been able to do it. I\nprobably will one of these days and I want to take my children. But I just, I don't\nhave the courage. It took me, well I didn't go back to Auschwitz until '92, first time I\nwent to Auschwitz. Actually, it worked out it was much easier than I thought it\nwould be. It was much harder going back to Kielce where I had been in the ghetto.\nI'll have to go the Holocaust Museum, obviously, but I'm afraid of it. That's the\nsame, I haven't been in the Yad Vashem even though I was in Israel and I could have\ngone, emotionally I'm just afraid.",
        "A: Well, the strange thing is that what we did, my wife and I, decided to sort of go back\nto my roots and we actually went back to the place where I was born and we drove\naround. And she would record, she would ask me questions and I would tell her\nabout things. As we were driving into Kielce, I suddenly remembered the address of\nthe house and the street where we were in the ghetto. I hadn't remembered it for\nThomas Buergenthal 31\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 31\nyears, I couldn't remember it. It suddenly came back to me. And we drove into\nKielce, and I sort of directed her, and I'm a person who gets lost any place. I get lost\nin Washington, DC, if I don't see the Washington monument and here I sort of\ndirected her within two blocks of where we were in the ghetto and found the house.\nThe interesting thing is -- you know how children are -- I kept telling her, \"It's this\nbig house, I don't know, it must be six or seven stories high.\" When we got to it, it\nwas a three-story building. It was just as dilapidated, just as terrible as it was when I\nremembered it. And the faces of the people, there was a tremendous amount of\nantisemitism in Poland, and in Kielce particularly it was quite bad. We were always\nafraid that if you tried to escape from the camp you would be handed over to the\nGermans. The faces of the people and the lack of the fact that there was no\nmonument any place in the ghetto to say this was the ghetto. All I could think about\nwas, I want to get out of here. I just couldn't take it. Thinking that my parents lived\nin this one room in this house. My mother had just died and I couldn't wait to leave.\nIt was lunchtime and we were going to stop and have lunch, I said, \"I don't want to\ndo anything, I just want to get out of this place.\" I'd spent four years of my life there.\nBut it was exactly, I mean the part of the ghetto, that whole area -- and the lack of\nany remembering, any effort made to remember that 20,000 people had lived here\nwho had died. I did go -- we did go to a museum. We tried to find a museum and I\nasked for a book on the Jewish community of Kielce; eventually they found\nThomas Buergenthal 32\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 32\nsomething that had been issued, there had been some exhibit I don't know how long\nago, but there was nothing in the museum that you could see. This was the city\nmuseum of Kielce, and there was nothing about the wartime experience. A book that\nI eventually got -- it's sort of small little book about the Jewish community which\nmust have been issued during the Communist period. It was shocking to me, well,\nfirst the way that nothing had changed, but then it was sort of totally, it's as if all of\nthis that had happened there had no impact on the people and they didn't even want\nto remember it, whereas it was quite different in Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, I had\ncome in, we went first. I was in Birkenau in the nice camp in Auschwitz, so we went\nin there first. And I was very concerned how it would go. As we walked in we saw a\nsign that said, \u201cARCHIVES,\u201d and my wife said, \"Why don't you go in and introduce\nyourself?\" I was at this point thinking I should be writing down my experiences.\nAnd I said, \"No, I want to be a tourist, I don't want to bother with any of that.\" And\nshe insisted, so she usually prevails. I went in, introduced myself, and they took me\nto the director and he then introduced me to the archivist, and they were a whole\ngroup of people who came in. They were at that point actually working on a study\non children in the camp. So they wanted to know, where were you and everything\nelse. And then I had them check my number and find out when I arrived, and they\nhad all of the -- they had the document, they knew the number of people that came\nwith my transport to Auschwitz.\nThomas Buergenthal 33\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 33\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: Right. And what happened then as a result of this activity, the whole thing for me\nbecame an academic exercise, so then we had a car and they put a guide at my\ndisposal and we went to Birkenau, but it was no longer the Auschwitz. So the\ntransition was made much easier because of all these questions.",
        "A: That's a wonderful story because my mother believed that I was alive when\neverybody told her that it couldn't be, but she believed it and she insisted. Matter of\nfact, my mother walked back -- she was liberated not far from Regensburg -- she\nwalked back to Poland, to Kielce, looking for me. There were people who had --\nbecause she and my father had sort of different weigh stations where they were\ngoing to meet after the war. And people there had been in the camp with me and\nsome people had seen me at this point or at that point. They all told her, \"He can't be\nalive, forget it,\" you know. She insisted. Well, my uncle, who lived here in the\nUnited States -- my mother then went back to her hometown in Germany, was very\nsick. She was sort of three months drugged just to sleep it all off, and got in touch\nwith my uncle and they started the search and so the Jewish agency for Palestine and\nThomas Buergenthal 34\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 34\nvarious search bureaus of Red Cross and other things. In the meantime, I was in the\norphanage and in the orphanage -- the orphanage was run by Jewish Communists,\nso-called the Bund party, who wanted Jews to stay in Poland and become good\nCommunists. But the orphanage had been infiltrated by a Zionist organization and\none of our counselors was a young woman, a Zionist woman from the Ha-Shomer\nHa-Za\u2019ir movement, which is a Zionist labor movement. And they decided that\nthose of us who wanted to go to Palestine then -- this was in 1946 -- we should run\naway from the orphanage and we would be picked up by the people from that group\nand then taken to a kibbutz in Poland and then eventually be shipped illegally to\nPalestine. And so, the procedure was that every week or so, one kid who wanted to\ngo there would run away from the orphanage and would disappear. But we all who\nwanted to go, put our names, tell them that we wanted to run away, so they made a\nlist with our names. But I was told that since I had been on newsreels, that if I ran\naway that would really draw attention to the whole thing, so I had to be the last one\nto run away. But the list with names was sent to Palestine and it was sent to the\nJewish agency in Palestine and somebody in the Jewish agency looked at those lists -\n- this 1s pre-computers, imagine -- 1t was written in heaven -- saw a mother looking\nfor her child and a child with the same name on another list. Notified my uncle in the\nUnited States, and then my mother and then eventually they -- an American\norganization smuggled me out of Poland and Czechoslovakia to the American zone\nThomas Buergenthal 35\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 35\nin Germany and then to the British zone in Germany where my mother was. That\nwas in December of 1946, so imagine, I was separated from my mother in 1944.",
        "A: Well, that was actually very different. I received a letter in Polish supposedly from\nmy mother, written in handwriting, curious enough I could not really read, but I\nknew my mother's handwriting, and I knew that my mother didn't write Polish. And\nI thought it was a trick because every so often people tried to adopt us from the\norphanage so this letter came supposedly from my mother, delighted that she found\nme and she was going to get me out of there. And I was sure that wasn't my mother.\nIt wasn't until I received a letter from my mother in German that I knew it was my\nmother. You see, we couldn't talk on the telephone. None of that existed.",
        "A: It was my mother but she had somebody else write the letter in Polish thinking that I\nhad forgotten my German or since it was going to Poland.",
        "A: Well, I really don't remember what it said. I wish I had kept it. Actually the letter\nwas written by a man who was in the camp with us who later became my mother's\nsecond husband, a wonderful man, a doctor. The only surviving doctor from -- who\nthen died unfortunately in '48. But he wrote that letter. I knew my mother couldn't\nThomas Buergenthal 36\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 36\nwrite Polish and we were always, you know, this adoption thing, this is the tough\nkids in the orphanage didn't want to be adopted. It really didn't dawn on me until\nmonths later.",
        "A: Well, nothing was easy after the war. I had no papers for one thing, no passports --\nyou would have had to have visas and everything else. The orphanage was very\ncooperative and the orphanage was also supported by Jewish organizations from the\noutside, particularly the American Joint Distribution Committee. So they, sort of\nthrough my uncle, started beginning to move this reunion and how to get me to\nGermany. What happened was that somebody came and said that they were going to\ntake me to my mother and the orphanage agreed. I suppose they investigated it, and I\nwent with them. We had to be smuggled out of Poland, this was in the winter, this\nwas end of November, December 1946. We crossed over the border into\nCzechoslovakia, it was freezing and I was very affected because of my frostbite. We\nhad to walk across the Czech/Polish border, they had bribed the guards, it wasn't\ndangerous but it was still a sort of, 1t was an illegal operation. I then ended up, I was\npicked up by an American woman working for one of these organizations in Prague,\nThomas Buergenthal 37\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 37\ntaken to a hotel. I had never been in -- what I remember from this, it's funny how\nthese things stay in your mind. It was a revolving door and I didn't know how to get\ninto it. I was just standing there worrying. She walked through the revolving door\nand I was supposed to follow her and here I stood, I didn't know how to -- after all\nthis, the revolving door was something I had never seen before. Well, we stayed in\nPrague for a few days and then again we took a train but we got out of the train --\nthere was another group of border smugglers from a Jewish organization called\nBrichah which took us from the Czech side to a German town called Hirth in\nBavaria; it was the American zone. Again, trudging through border, walking across\nwith bribed border guards, and ending up in Munich and eventually going on a\nmilitary train with her from Munich to Gottingen, crossing into the British zone of\nGermany, and my mother awaiting me -- not in Gottingen, she couldn't wait -- in\nanother town. Well -- and then you know, then I just couldn't believe it at that point,\nthat's when the realization set in.",
        "A: I don't know how she recognized me, but I recognized her immediately. We had\nonly been separated three years. That was no problem.",
        "A: Not really, I think it was so overwhelming, you know a lot of crying. The usual\nThomas Buergenthal 38\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 38\nthing.",
        "A: No, because actually, even though my grandparent's house still stood, my\ngrandparent's were forced to sell it and my mother lived in an apartment in a nice\nhouse in town and life suddenly became normal after all of those years.",
        "A: I don't know whether that's true. I reverted to being her little boy in many ways. But\nit's interesting because I spent -- we had to think of school and all of this -- and I had\na year, a little more than a year of private tutoring from a retired German teacher,\nand he said that he couldn't get over the fact that I would be a little child in one sense\nand a grown man in another when we discussed things and I imagine that was the\nsame with my mother. Although, with my mother, we discussed -- there was a lot of\nreminiscing about the camp, you know -- where was this, what happened. But I was\na child, I played, I did everything. I wasn't at that point -- this was in 1946, 1947 --\nhow old was I? 14, 13 years old. I couldn't speak German too well. Again, this was\nsort of the interesting part; it took me a while to get back into German because I had\nThomas Buergenthal 39\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 39\nspoken much more Polish than German, and it took me sort of a month or two to be\nfluent again in German even though at home we used to speak German and Polish. I\nspoke German with my mother and father when we were together and Polish with\nmy father when we were alone.",
        "A: Yes. And things would come back and you would talk about this or that and another\nthing that is so interesting, people often think that when people get together from a\ncamp, all we'd talk about were all these terrible things that happened. The truth of\nthe matter is that we often laughed about things in retrospect, about things that\nhappened that were funny, about this or that happened. So the human spirit -- you\ncouldn't take all this if 1t were only reminiscences about all the terrible things. So my\nwife often sort of marveled about the fact that even in recent years when my mother\nand I would get together we would talk about these things and talk about them often\nand remember this funny thing, and remember this. It wasn't only remembering the\nterrible things that had happened. I imagine it was probably when I was little we\ntalked more about those things.",
        "A: Of course.\nThomas Buergenthal 40\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 40\nand if you did know anything, how did you know it?",
        "A: No, at that point my mother already knew that my father had not survived. It's\nstrange because I had always believed that my father would survive. It's strange, my\nmother was not well, my mother had thyroid condition so I assumed that if one or\nthe other of them was going to survive it was going to be my father who was going\nto survive because he was also, he was very strong and very healthy. But he was\nexecuted three days before the war supposedly ended, in another camp, in\nFlossenburg, where they executed a lot of people just before the end of the war.",
        "A: I understand that he was in the group, there were orders given apparently to not let\nany of the prisoners -- most of the camps fall into -- be liberated. And where he was\nthe order was executed, in fact.",
        "A: No, I didn't find it out, my mother at that point already knew.",
        "A: You know it's strange but life was so unordinary if you want, that you didn't mourn\nThomas Buergenthal 41\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 41\nin the same way. It was a loss, you know, we lost so many people. It was a terrible\nthing that my father hadn't survived. It was something that I still feel today but\nmourning wasn't something one did in the way one does for example, if somebody\ndies and one goes through this period. It was a reality one simply accepted, added to\nall the other things that had happened. But one didn't mourn the way we do in\nordinary, everyday life. That simply didn't happen. I'm sure when my mother first\nfound out, it must have been extremely difficult. But by the time I was reunited with\nmy mother I think I -- I don't know when or if ever, on the one hand I always\nbelieved I was going to find my parents, but at the same time I must have at some\npoint in the orphanage already concluded that I wouldn't be reunited, that neither of\nthem lived.",
        "A: No, you know. I think I assumed that my life had been normal from the very\nbeginning. The fact that 1t wasn't normal was part of it being normal, this was all part\nof the life that I had lived. I mean you would think that going back to Germany for\nexample, would be difficult. It was difficult. It was very difficult initially for my\nThomas Buergenthal 42\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 42\nmother but this was the only place she really could go back to. My mother always\ntold the story with a very bad conscious, very guilty, because she was standing on\nthe street corner in her home town and an old lady came up to her and asked her to\nhelp her across the street and my mother said, \"Nobody helped my mother across the\nstreet in this town.\" This was right after she came back. Then for years she would\ntalk about 1t and say how terrible it was that she had acted that way. So you know,\nwe had all of those feelings. But then I went there to school initially but at first the\nthought to go with these kids whose fathers had killed my father. But then you\nrealize that these are people you don't know whether they killed your father, most of\nthem probably didn't, and you make friends. And you find for example, we lived in\nthe house with somebody, who was, a Catholic family that had actually helped the\nJews in town, had been in danger themselves. And so that sort of abstract hatred\nbecomes transformed into the fact that they're human beings regardless of whether\nthey're Germans or not Germans and not every German was guilty.",
        "A: But remember, it was also the language of my mother. I've never made that\nassociation. I always had terrible trouble seeing Germans in uniform but not the\nThomas Buergenthal 43\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 43\nlanguage. And it wasn't a problem then. But of course the difficulty was that one did\nsometimes see types on the street that reminded one of the SS and others, so they\nprobably were. My mother would every so often look at some woman walking by\nand say that she must have been a camp guard. And you know, those memories\nwould invariably come back or people would make some remarks or people would\nsee her number. She always wore short sleeves and people would say to her, \"Don't\nyou think you should have this tattoo removed?\" And she would say, \"This is a\nbadge of honor, I would never remove this.\" You know, and she had a lot of the --\n[end of side one of tape 2]\nTape 2, Side B\n-- lived in Italy, starting I think in 1953 until she died. Every so often if she would\nsee a German tour guide, she would make some sort of remark but at the same time\nshe was very forgiving in many ways.",
        "A: No. But I think it's, it's -- and nobody told me to, that 1t would be a good idea if I\nremoved it. But I think you'd tell it to -- she was a very pretty woman and so I\nsuppose it was a natural thing to say, \"Shouldn't you remove it?\" But no, she was\nvery wonderful, she was a very little person. She was less than five feet tall, very\nThomas Buergenthal 44\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 44\ncharming but very tough. I mean, the fact that she could survive that camp. And she\nactually survived Mengele\u00ae who looked at her in the selection process and said to\nher, \"You have a thyroid condition\" because her eyes would show. And she in her\nwonderful north German looked at her and said, \"Doctor, you're a magnificent\ndiagnostician.\" And he let her go. You know that's kind of sort of --",
        "A: First of all, we were very proud of being Jews and being survivors. And of course\nyou know, my mother's family was known. This was a small town, this is a famous\nuniversity town, it had 50,000 inhabitants but my mother grew up in that town and\nwe were known. I was the only Jewish child in the school and the German kids\nwould sometimes look at me and say, \"You don't look the ways Jews are supposed\nto look\" because their only notion of Jews were these cartoons that they had seen.\nThe kids, you know children are children. I never experienced any antisemitism in\nthe school, never had any sense. I've experienced antisemitism more in many other\nplaces, but never in school in Germany. People said they didn't know. The only\n> Josef Mengele (1911-19792), Extermination camp doctor at Auschwitz.\nThomas Buergenthal 45\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 45\nincident really that I remember in school was, of course, the teachers tried to avoid\nspeaking about the war altogether. It was never mentioned in history class. History\nwas taught. You spoke about the German mythology and the 17th, 18th century but\nnever about the 20th century. That was never taken up. But in one class, I don't\nknow whether it was even a history class, but the issue came up of the bombing of\nDresden and Hamburg and the teacher was saying how terrible that was and I raised\nmy hand and I said, \"Well, if you're going to talk about that, why don't you also talk\nabout all the other terrible things that you people did,\" and all hell broke loose. The\nteacher got very huffy initially and then, of course, worried because this was right\nafter the war and they had to go through denazification and all of these things. Then\nhe came at some point to our house and apologized. But that was the only incident\nwhich this matter ever came up. Of course, they tried to never talk about it. The kids\nwould sometimes ask, \u201c\u201cWhat's this number?\u201d and \u201cHow bad was it?\u201d Because these\nare kids my age.",
        "A: Oh, yes, I would tell them this is what happened, and then they would tell me that\ntheir father was -- you know, some of the kids' fathers were prisoners of war. But it\nwas curiosity more than, but I never had the sense of any sort of antisemitic feeling\nor any sense of, \"Oh, it's a pity that you weren't...\" You know, the usual thing that\none expects 1s, \"How come you survived and why did you survive, what a pity that\nThomas Buergenthal 46\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 46\nyou...\" None of that ever.",
        "A: No, never. You know the strange thing is that when you enter a class, I learned very\nearly because I learned it in the orphanage, too; in the orphanage, I was the kid who\nwas sent to get the mail from the post office, this was in Poland. Because a lot of\nkids, the Poles would throw stones at and attack them and yell antisemitic slogans at\nthem. I would go and pick up the mail and nobody would yell at me. For one thing I\ndidn't look Jewish. But I remember once confronting somebody and who said\nsomething about me and the first reaction was to just slug him, and I learned very\nearly that with all of that, the best way was to just be extremely aggressive and if\nsomebody said something like this, you just whopped them one but you didn't act as\nif you were afraid. And that was also very effective in school in Germany when you\nenter the class. I was quite strong. And so you took on, not because of antisemitism\nor anything else, but when you came into a new environment you had to assert\nyourself and so you took on the fellow who was supposed to be the strongest. And I\nremember I was very good in arm wrestling and I could beat anybody so we would\nprove ourselves, you know the usual, almost like monkeys assert their superiority.\nBut I never had any problems in school. I had to prove myself like I imagine any\nThomas Buergenthal 47\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 47\nother kid has to prove himself.",
        "A: Yes, I was extremely healthy. Quite athletic. I did, I played soccer in the orphanage.\nI boxed in Germany. I ran -- I actually won the 100-meter championship with my\namputated toes, which nobody knew about. So it -- and I loved sports. It was all of\nthe things that Germans to be able to do was another part.",
        "A: No, I never had the sense that -- she let me do, eat what I wanted and at that point in\nthe beginning it wasn't always easy to get food after the war but we always had\nrelatively good food. Of course, any food we would have had was good from my\npoint of view at the time but I don't remember. We received some care packages\nactually from the United States and my relatives here sent some food. It was always\na big event when a package arrived from the United States with different things\ncoming out of cans.",
        "A: Well, my mother wasn't doing anything. At that point we -- she -- received a\npension. Initially we received -- there was actually aid given to Jewish, from Jewish\norganizations and at one point she was the president of the Jewish community which\nconsisted, I think, of about 20 Jewish, Jews\u2019 families and individuals. And there was\nThomas Buergenthal 48\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 48\nfood brought and distributed, and we\u2014she -- received after my father, which later\non was increased and she could actually live quite well on that pension. And we\ntraded, you know, we used to trade. If you got a pack of cigarettes from the Unites\nStates you could trade that and you could live for a week on the food that you could\ntrade with the farmers that would come in for coffee or cigarettes. Right after the\nwar until 1948 in Germany, if you got any cigarettes and coffee from the United\nStates, it was a wonderful way to obtain good food from the farmers.",
        "A: Yes, there were English troops. As a matter of fact, it's very interesting. The -- a\ncurrent British member of parliament -- a Jewish member of parliament, a man by\nthe name of Janner,\u00b0 whose father is already represented the Jewish, the east side of\nLondon in the British parliament -- was a young soldier and came to visit us and the\nbefriended us and I stayed in touch with him. He took me to movies and brought us\nsome food, but there was a British occupation troop there.",
        "A: They apparently asked for somebody, whether there was any Jewish community and\nJewish families, and he made a point of finding us. And that happened often. People,\nif there were Jewish soldiers in town, they would try to find whether there were\nThomas Buergenthal 49\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 49\nJewish families and whether they needed anything.",
        "A: Well, it's interesting you should ask that because I remember the Nuremberg trials\nonly to the extent that I remember the first, almost first English words that I\nremember was \"by hanging,\" and I remember listening to the radio when they\nannounced the sentences and we were listening to that with sort of joy. But that's the\nonly thing that I remember of that period. But I should tell you a story that is\ninteresting connected with occupation forces because we mentioned Mr. Nansen\nwho had written a diary, then a book about me. I forgot his name when I was\nliberated from the camp. I couldn't remember his name. But when I came back to my\nmother I kept saying, \"There was this wonderful man, this Norwegian who had\nsaved my life and was very nice to me, and his father was very famous and his\nfather's pictures were on even the packages of cookies that he once gave me.\" And\nmy mother said, \"He must have been some famous cookie manufacturer.\" So you\nknow, it was just sort of the way you would treat a kid. I kept saying, \"No, no, this\nman...\" Then, one day in 1948, my mother was reading a newspaper that was for\n\u00b0 Janner, Barnett, Lord (1892-), British communal and Zionist leader.\n\u2019 Speer, Albert (1905-1981); Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production,\nThomas Buergenthal 50\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 50\nformer inmates in the camp and there was a little write-up of a book that had just\nbeen published, the diaries of a man, a Norwegian, who had been in Sachsenhausen\nso my mother said to me \"That might be your cookie -- he might know who that man\nwas. Why don't we write to him and find out?\" So we wrote this letter to him asking\nwhether he might know the man who was so nice to me. And of course the mail was\nterrible in those days. Nothing happened for a while. Then one day the doorbell rings\nand there's a big Norwegian military truck outside and the girl who opened the door\nsaid, \"Yes?\" He said, \"Well, we have a package here for the Buergenthal family. So\nshe said, \"Give it to me,\" and they said, \"No, no, no, it's much too heavy, we have to\ntake it in.\" So they take a tremendous crate and they bring it up and it's food\ncollected from Norwegian children with a letter from him saying that he's the person\nand, you know, how delighted he was that I'm alive because he thought that I had\ndied in the camp and as a result that's why the book was dedicated to me, among\nothers, because he thought that I hadn't survived. Then eventually he came and he\nactually took me to Norway to spend six weeks in Norway, and had a wonderful\ntime. But it was, when he learned that I was alive, he announced it in Norway and so\nthe school children began to collect food. And apparently they collected, there was a\nlot of chocolate which was rationed at that time in Norway, so it was quite a sacrifice\nfor Norwegian children to give up their chocolate rations so I could have that. The\nHitler\u2019s chief architect.\nThomas Buergenthal 51\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 51\nScandinavians were just wonderful in the camp.",
        "A: I used to have nightmares for a while in the camp, but then I found a wonderful way\nto solve, deal with my nightmares and I never had them again. Never had them as\nnightmares. I had this recurring dream that I was being executed and then in one\nnightmare when I looked into the barrel of the gun, some flower or grass came out of\nit and they weren't real bullets. So every time this nightmare recurred, I had, saw that\nas nothing to worry about because no bullets are going to come out of this gun and\nthe nightmares were never a problem.",
        "A: Yes and no. I knew that I wanted to leave. I mean, I wasn't uncomfortable in the\nsense that I didn't feel that I wasn't well-treated. But I felt I really didn't belong. And\nI felt that sooner or later I would leave and the only question was whether I would go\nto Israel or some place else and I actually planned to go to Israel. Then I came to the\nUnited States. Actually I came to the United States really for only one year and\nnever went back but I didn't think I would stay. It was sort of clear to me even before\nI came to the United States, that I really didn't fit in somehow. Not because I had\nbeen made uncomfortable in any way, and this was probably the reason too why my\nThomas Buergenthal 52\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 52\nmother left.",
        "A: Well, my mother just thought that I would go to the United States for a year and stay\nwith my uncle and come back and she thought that it was a good experience that I\nshould go to America. America was what we imagined, it was heaven and you had\nto see it, it was wonderful, but she didn't think that I would stay. It was hard for her\nwhen I didn't, but I tried to come back as often as I could. But I think she recognized\nthat it was the best thing for me to do.",
        "A: No, I came on a boat, on a Liberty boat, the SS Greeley (ph), SS General Greeley\n(ph). It was one of these, you know, the tubs that were built for a troop transport. It\nwas a long trip, I think we were at least a week if not longer on the ship, with a large\nnumber of refugees; it was immigrants coming. All nationalities, all languages.\nWell, what can I tell you about it? It was actually quite an interesting trip because I\nrealized again the survival instinct that we talked about. People had to work on the\nboats, people had to paint and sweep. At that point I was 17 and I realized that\nwasn't really the nice thing to have to do and I volunteered to be an interpreter, so I\nwould have to go and make the announcements in different languages over the\nThomas Buergenthal 53\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 53\npublic address system. In that capacity we had a lovely place to stay and we actually\npublished a newspaper. I still have the newspaper that we published on the last day\non the arrival in New York. It was a very wonderful group of people from all over\nincluding a Kalnick (ph) family from the steppes of Russia. I still have some\npictures. Then I came to the United States. For some reason my uncle couldn't pick\nme up, he wasn't allowed to pick me up from the ship but I was picked up by a\nJewish welfare service organization who took me to a house, like a sort of halfway\nhouse in the Bronx where I stayed a week before my uncle picked me up. The very\nfunny thing that happened there, I arrived there and there were other kids in this\nhouse and they of course were natives already, they'd been here a few weeks and\nknew New York and everything. They took me, they said, \"You want to see New\nYork? You want to see Manhattan?\" Of course I wanted to see Manhattan. We got\non the subway and the doors opened up and they got out at one stop and I didn't\nmake it out and I had no idea where I was because I had no address, but we got\nreunited at the next stop. But my uncle and my aunt are wonderful people, they're\nstill alive. My uncle and aunt came, their names are Sylberg, Eric and Senta Sylburg\n(ph). They lived in Paterson, New Jersey, at the time. They came in 1938 to the\nUnited States, a very hard time. They worked in factories, one daughter. They're\nnow in their 80s but still doing very well. And they took me in. They weren't\nwealthy people at all. And I lived with them for a year and a half while I went to\nThomas Buergenthal 54\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 54\nhigh school in Paterson. They were sort of my surrogate parents for many years,\nuntil I went to Bethany.",
        "A: Yes, well, I spoke some English, I had high school German, German high school\nEnglish.",
        "A: Well I had Polish, German, and French, which I've basically lost on learning\nSpanish; it's very difficult for me now.",
        "A: Yes. Well, what happened was this: there was a sort of -- instead of Ellis Island they\nhad established a camp, the U.S. authorities had established a camp in Bremerhaven\nin Germany, where people who had different visas to come to the United States as\nrefugees were first brought into these camps, their papers were examined. And then\nevery few weeks they would have a ship ready and they would take people over on\nthese ships as a refugee ship, and that was one of those ships.",
        "A: No, but it was of the Statue of Liberty. Because we arrived -- it was really wonderful\n-- we arrived in the late afternoon and so we couldn't disembark until the next\nThomas Buergenthal 55\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 55\nmorning and so we could see the Statue of Liberty all lit up. As a matter of fact in\nthe newspaper article that each of us wrote in a different language. I wrote mine in\nGerman. I noted the lights of the Statue of Liberty and the lights of New York City,\nwhich made a tremendous impression on me. I reflected on Auschwitz and the\ncrematory and the light. So it was a tremendous moment.",
        "A: Very much so. I reread it the other day and I was struck by how much I -- these\nflashbacks come to me, for example they came to me in El Salvador, they come all\nthe time. One really can't have gone through that experience and when you see\nsomething similar, that brings it back, of course. It doesn't bring it back necessarily\nin a negative way. But I saw it in connection with the El Mozote massacre in El\nSalvador or the killing of the Jesuits. These things came right back to me.",
        "A: Well, it's strange. Initially I thought I wanted to be a journalist but then I decided\nvery early that I wouldn't make much of a journalist in the language that wasn't my\nlanguage. When I went to Bethany, I already, I think the first year in Bethany I\nalready decided I was going to be a lawyer and I was going to do something relating\nto international things, I didn't have it very clear in my mind and I actually was a\nThomas Buergenthal 56\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 56\npre-law student in Bethany. My father was a lawyer so it was sort of an easy -- at\none point I thought of studying medicine but then I realized again that I didn't have\nthe science ability or background. But it's really the lawyer thing was already,\nactually when I was in high school in Paterson I had already decided that.",
        "A: No, never. I always thought I wanted to do something with law and international\nrelations of some sort. But you know, in law school -- at least in your first years in\nlaw school, at least in the days that I went to law school -- you couldn't even get a\ncourse in international law in your first or second year. It was usually you got\nelectives only in the third year so I had my first international law course in my third\nyear of law school. It wasn't until I went onto graduate law that I specialized and\ncould specialize in international law. But I always -- at that point when I was in law\nschool I'd made up my mind I would do something in international law.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3, Side A\nThomas Buergenthal 57\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 57\nyourself interested in?",
        "A: Well, in college I was very much interested in history, particularly American history.\nThat fascination sort of came out of high school, I had a very fine high school\nhistory course, and then political science, international relations was always there.\nAnd literature -- I actually majored -- I minored in English in college of all things.\nThen in law school I wanted to study international things but I really had only one\ncourse as I mentioned before, then I decided to go on to graduate school. I did my\nlaw school at NYU and I went on to Harvard for a masters and eventually for a\ndoctorate in international law. What was interesting, struck me, I reread my\napplication to Harvard what I wanted to do, and in my application I said that I\nwanted to study international courts among other things, and then I ended up serving\n12 years on an international court without knowing it. It was sort of a strange thing,\nbut that's what I wanted to do. But I did work at Harvard on international\norganizations I was particularly interested in. The European common market was\njust beginning and I was interested in how that court functioned. Then I did my\ndoctorate actually on a subject that everybody is surprised out, I did it on\ninternational air law. But in between I got very much interested in human rights and\nI wrote one of my first articles on human rights.\nThomas Buergenthal 58\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 58\nit. What were your reactions to it? What did you like about it, what did you dislike\nabout it?",
        "A: Well, if we're just talking law school in general, I disliked almost everything about\nit. I just hated my first year in law school. I thought it was much too technical and\nvery lacking in -- at least the way it was taught in those days -- very little policy\norientation and there was sort of various technical, dry case analysis that didn't, to\nmy mind at the time, didn't focus on what I thought were important issues. It wasn't\nreally until I was able to study what I was really interested in, which was\ninternational law. I got interested, I began to enjoy law really in my third year in law\nschool, and then international law because I saw it as an instrument of being able to\ndeal with some of the problems that I had myself experienced. And I wanted to see\nto what extent law could play a role in preventing some of these things. And I'm not\nsaying this in any sort of philosophical sense, but I thought I had a background in, a\nlanguage background and was sort of naturally drawn to things international. I\ntherefore thought it would be interesting to see to what extent various organizations\nlike the UN, the European Common Market, the Council of Europe; to what extent\nthey're doing something that in fact might prevent the reoccurrence of the things that\nI had experienced. And once I got into it, that was the thing that really captivated\nme.\nThomas Buergenthal 59\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 59\nwas there a feeling that it was an effective tool, or when you were studying it was\nthere a different feeling?",
        "A: Well, it depends a little bit where -- when I got to Harvard I had some wonderful\nprofessors of international law, probably among the best in the world. And they\ndemonstrated the importance of it and sort of opened a completely new different\nworld for me. But of course, all the people around us, that is to say not in the law\nschool but the world around us believed that all of this really didn't exist, that there\nwas no such thing as international law and that it was totally irrelevant. And so you\nalways had the sense that you were sort of an academic who was studying something\nthat had no relevance to anything that happened in the real world. I never believed\nthis, I always thought that 1t was much more relevant than people thought, than the\naverage person thought, and much more relevant than most Americans thought. I\nthought Americans probably had a much less of an understanding of the importance\nof international law than people in other parts of the world. And less of a realization\nof the importance of the UN for example and the significance of it than people in\nother parts of the world. So it was sort of almost a schizophrenic aspect when you\nwere studying international law. You'd go to a cocktail party and people would say,\n\"Well, what are you studying?\" You'd say, \"International law,\" and they'd say,\n\"Does it really exist?\" Then when I started teaching, you'd get the same, sort of. But\nwhat I was able to do and throughout my life, my professional life, is that I never\nThomas Buergenthal 60\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 60\njust did, I was never just an academic, that I wrote and taught international law,\nparticularly human rights and international organizations. But starting in the early\n70s I really worked -- in the 70s I began to represent the U.S. Government at\nUNESCO in human rights matters, then I ended up on the InterAmerican Court of\nHuman Rights where we dealt with some very nasty cases like disappearances and\nother things. And now I'm on the UN Human Rights Committee, and we're doing the\nsame. I was on the Truth Commission of El Salvador, all the time while continuing\nto teach. So that, to me, international law was never just an academic subject. I also -\n- | have lived it almost all of the years since I began teaching. I've also practiced it in\na way, not in as a law firm lawyer but as a international lawyer working in the field.",
        "A: Well you know, I've never brought a human rights case. I've always thought that I\ncould be much more effective in the human rights area by not being an activist in the\nsense of being a lawyer filing cases, but an academic who could be perceived to\nhave a legitimacy when he spoke on human rights issue that wasn't driven by\npolitical considerations. It wasn't driven by other considerations and that had no\npolitical agenda other than concern for human rights. And that has been enabled me,\n* United Nations Educational and Cultural Organizations\nThomas Buergenthal 61\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 61\nin fact, to be on a human rights court and be put in positions of being able, I think, to\ndo a great deal in the human rights area, and to be taken seriously in the human\nrights area without being viewed as somebody who has a political agenda. I think it's\nvery important for NGOs\u2019 and activist organizations to do the work that they're\ndoing, but it's also important for people to be seen as committed to human rights and\ncommitted to the advancement of human rights who aren't political activists in the\nfield. And I've always thought that I could do much more by doing that, by staying\nabove the sort of political foray, and that was particularly important in Latin\nAmerica, where from the beginning if you spoke about human rights you were\nperceived to be a Communist. As a matter of fact, I founded the InterAmerican\nInstitute of Human Rights in Costa Rica, precisely in order to legitimate just a\ndiscussion of human rights, which when I first came I was involved with Latin\nAmerica in the late 70s, the discussion of human rights wasn't a legitimate subject, it\njust became aggressive political discourse between the right and the left. And so my\nsense has always been that some of us, at any rate, can contribute much more\nthrough teaching and through serving as impartial arbiters in this field. In the\nteaching area, I -- my former professor at Harvard and I -- did the first American\ncase book in international human rights. We established the teaching of international\nhuman rights in the American law schools. And our book came out in 1977 and\n? National Governing Organizations\nThomas Buergenthal 62\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 62\nbefore then only three of us taught the subject. It's now taught in almost all\nAmerican law schools. And, you know, I have a little book for students on the\nteaching of -- on international human rights, which actually the subject has suddenly\ntaken on a life of it's own not only in law schools but every place else, which it didn't\nhave when I first started in this field in the late 60s. Nobody was interested in this\nfield and in the international -- the American Society of International -- didn't even\nconsider human rights to be a subject of international -- so I worked in both of these\nareas and I thought it was always very important. Philosophy -- that's the philosophy\nI suppose. To my mind the most important thing in this field is not to let yourself be\npoliticized; that's the biggest danger that I see. People who promote human rights,\nwhen they politicize the subject, do a great deal of harm to the victims because they\nthen debilitate themselves in being able to protect victims. Also I've learned a great\ndeal of patience in this field. It takes a few lifetimes to be able to achieve anything.\nBut, you know, the most gratifying thing is to -- it's often occurred to me when I\nworked in Zepuan (ph) sitting on the case or when investigating human rights\nviolations in El Salvador or now at the UN -- to think that somebody who had\nsurvived Auschwitz is given the opportunity to be working in this field now. It's a\nwonderful -- it's a gift, it's a blessing when you think about it, you know, that I've\nbeen given this opportunity. It's exciting and that's what sort of makes this all for me.\nEvery time I sit on something that sort of brings back the memory, it seems to me to\nThomas Buergenthal 63\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 63\nsay that it's almost as if there was something written that I'm supposed to be doing\nthis. The irony, the poetic justice of my doing this, comes back so often. It came\nback particularly in El Salvador where so many things that I saw reminded me of the\ncamps, from the massacres to the executions. But to think, you know, to think of the\ncold Polish winters and the tropics of El Salvador, yet the same cruelty, and for me\nto be able to be involved in this, it boggles the mind in many ways.",
        "A: Well, you know, it struck me long ago when I read Solzhenitsyn! books about the\ngulag, that the unimaginative cruelty, it's always the same. You know, when you\nread what happened in the gulags, you say, \"Gee, this is exactly what happened in\nthe camps.\" And then in El Salvador for example, when the only survivor there\ndescribed the massacre. When she began talking, I could have finished the story for\nher. I was struck by the fact that I could have continued about what happened. It's\nthe same, I mean this brutality and the same thing in Bosnia. There is no -- evil has\nsort of a monotone to it. I don't know, that is the thing that always strikes me, that I\njust can't get over.\nThomas Buergenthal 64\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 64",
        "A: The link is probably there and it's not there. In other words, it doesn't and it shouldn't\nshape the outcome of the decision. What it does, it's you have a much better sense of\nthe reality in which an event happened. It's as if, you know, if I were a judge sitting\non a commercial case and I'd been prior to that a lawyer practicing in the\ncommercial law area, I would have a much better sense of dealing with this material\nthan somebody who came out of some other environment. Well, it's a little the same\nfor me when I deal with a human rights case. This is a reality. When I hear\nsomebody describe a certain situation, there is an understanding of what could have\nhappened and also doubts raise when somebody tells you something, you say\nwhenever that doesn't sound right. And you can make those, you can have those\ndoubts only if you've lived through something similar. So to that extent there is a\nconnection, and to that extent it's very useful. But it shouldn't affect your decision-\nmaking process. But of course, there is the empathy that comes out of the\nexperience, is there. And I think people shouldn't be in human rights if they don't\nhave some empathy for what it is to be subjected to violations. But I don't know,\nsometimes you wonder and you say to yourself, you know, something at the UN\n' Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr Isayevich (1918-), author.\nThomas Buergenthal 65\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 65\nnow where it's different from being on the court. You sometimes go very fast\nthrough a lot of material and you say, \"Gee, we have 140 countries, 80 countries\nfrom which we can receive reports, individual cases. Death penalty cases, people on\ndeath row for 18 years, things like that. And you wonder, you know, you sit on this\nand what in-roads do you really make? But it's only a very -- I have that in very few\nmoments when the going gets tough.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Actually I do that sometimes. Matter of fact, this year I was involved in a\ncommercial arbitration as an arbitrator. No, you have to get a -- you can't -- first of\nall I've never -- there are some people who sort of live with their concentration camp\nexperience; it's become an obsession. I think I would go crazy if I did. The one good\nthing, I've always been able to relax, with -- I don't need very much time. But if I\nhave these meetings and they go on for three weeks, if we can then take off for just a\nfew days, I don't carry it with me. And this is survivor instinct. No, you have to get\naway. I get away from it in my writings, really, my academic writings. Even though\nI deal a lot with human rights issues, but it's very academic and it's something else.\nAnd I've tried to write at least one or two articles or a book a year so that keeps me\nobsessed in other ways.\nThomas Buergenthal 66\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 66",
        "A: Well, after my bypass operation in '93 I decided -- my kids have been pressing me\nfor a long time -- I decided to begin writing. I've written about three or four chapters.\nBut I've come to the conclusion that I need -- I can't do it by myself. I'm much too\nmuch a lawyer when I write. It doesn't -- I describe things rather than -- and I've\nactually discussed it with somebody, that she might work with me. Because what I\nwrite sort of comes out wooden in many ways. And I don't deal -- I'm particularly\nbad in describing emotions. But it's obvious that one needs to write it down and\nthings come back that have long been forgotten. I was struck by the fact that just\nsitting behind the computer and thinking of a certain event, a lot of things come\nback, names come back that I thought I'd forgotten and 50 years later suddenly the\nname of a camp commandant comes back to me, or the name of a street. That's the\nwonderful thing about doing that and I'll continue doing that. The problem is that\nacademic books come in between them, and then other assignments that sort of -- I\nhave about three of four chapters. And I did write actually in Bethany college, I did\nwrite one story and they had a publication.",
        "A: No, a story about the death march actually, that I reread in order to give the talk at\nthe Holocaust Museum on the Auschwitz -- on the 50th anniversary of the\nThomas Buergenthal 67\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 67\nHolocaust, of the death march. And I had to sort of go back in order to even recall\nsome things. No, it should be written down. I've given some interviews.",
        "A: Well, first of all, 1t should be sort of written down for the family. What strikes me\nabout this whole thing is that when my kids were little they had no interest at all. I\nmean, they sort of knew, and as they got older, they're now in their late 20s and early\n30s, they now say, \"Write it down.\" And they would say, \"Well, why didn't you tell\nme that before?\" You know, this story or that story. But at the time really when they\nwere young they had no interest whatsoever, at least none that I could perceive. But\nnow they really are very interested and they want to know this and that. So that's one\nreason. I think the other reason is that these things should not be forgotten and those\nof us who have survived and who have the ability to recollect and express\nthemselves about that have an obligation to put it down. It's the kind of thing that if\nnothing else, hopefully it will have an impact on the future, at least in making people\nthink about how you can prevent those things. And also, you know, this notion about\nsome of the Holocaust deniers, here 1s an answer at least that this happened. The\nfurther away we get from it, supposedly, more of this denial is going to come about.\nThomas Buergenthal 68\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 68\npersonal experience come across someone who's denied that it happened, or the\nextent of it, and you've been able to say, \"Hey just listen to this story\u2019\u201d?",
        "A: No, I haven't. I've often thought that it would be wonderful if one of these people\nwould actually call me a liar so one could maybe bring a libel suit to try to establish\nthe truth of what actually happened. No, I've never had it. For many years I thought\nit wasn't worthwhile taking these people serious and I thought, you know, just a\nbunch of kooks. But it's surprising how some of these people have gained a certain\nlegitimacy and that's why it's important to deal with it. Because, of course, behind\nthis Holocaust denial, it's not so much that they are denying it just for it's own sake\nbut I think they're denying it in order to reestablish the type of political organizations\nthat made this thing possible in the first place. So it's part of the Neofascist, Neonazi-\ntype movement, and if you can deny that, that 1t happened, then it strengthens your\npolitical movement and that's dangerous.",
        "A: Yes, I am. I became an American citizen in '57. As a matter of fact, it was -- I think\nI'm one of the few people who became an American citizen with the help of the FBI\nbecause I had won the nomination for the Rhodes scholarship from West Virginia\nfrom Bethany and then from the state of West Virginia, and I wasn't a citizen yet and\nin order to compete in the finals I had to be a citizen. A lawyer in West Virginia who\nhad been an FBI agent and who was also a former Rhodes scholar moved all kinds\nThomas Buergenthal 69\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 69\nof things to get me my citizenship, get me cleared very fast so that I could get it. I\nhad been in the country long enough but it would have taken much longer. But I\nmanaged to get it and I managed not to get the Rhodes scholarship because I couldn't\nexplain in the finals why I wanted to go to England when I had just gotten to the\nUnited States, which was very difficult to explain, and I really was lost.",
        "A: They asked me a lot of other things and all of that seemed to be going well until they\nsaid, \"Well, you've just become a US citizen, why do you want to go to England?\"\nAnd I really didn't have a good answer and so I think that was one of the reasons.",
        "A: Well, I really think that the reaction to the Nazi rallies here have been wrong ones. I\nthink that one should let the people march, one should do what the Norwegians did\nwhen I was in Oslo. At one point, when they had a Nazi demonstration, the people\nall came out led by the bishop of Oslo and when the marchers walked by, all of the\npeople in the street turned their backs to them in silent demonstration, which to me is\nthe way they should be handled. If you start fights and everything, that's exactly\nwhat they want. And first of all, I think in this country we have enough other\nmechanisms to deal with it that we don't need to prohibit those marches. Let them,\nThomas Buergenthal 70\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 70\nbut deal with them with dignity and not pay any attention to them.",
        "A: I have three sons, a stepdaughter and a stepson, and they're all over the world now.\nI'm married and it's my second marriage. My wife is originally from Peru but she has\nthe same sort of mixture that I am. She's a Peruvian, Italian, British background. We\nmet in Costa Rica. My oldest son is in Poland right now working for the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and he will actually be dealing\nwith the elections in Bosnia for the agency. So that, I thought it was interesting that\nat least one of us in the family is going back to his roots. I have one son who works\nhere in Washington, lives in Baltimore. A third son who is clerking for a federal\njudge in Ohio. My stepdaughter lives in Miami and my stepson lives in Costa Rica.\nWe have four grandchildren and a fifth one on the way.",
        "A: No, unfortunately not, I think he regrets that he never bothered to learn it. I,\nunfortunately, have pretty much forgotten much of my Polish. But he just got there.\nHe is a lawyer by training but he worked for AID!' in Costa Rica and has now\nmoved to Warsaw. It's probably more important for him to learn Russian because\nhe's responsible for issues relating to the rule of law all over the former Soviet\nThomas Buergenthal 71\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 71\nRepublics and eastern Europe. The headquarters of the organization is in Warsaw\nbut he has to be traveling all around.",
        "A: Well I speak English and German. I can get along in Polish and I speak Spanish\nquite well, really, because I had to work in Spanish. But I learned Spanish when I\nfirst was elected to the court and I learned it by, not formally, I learned it by listening\nto the interpretation with one ear and to the original in the other. In the process I lost\nboth my Italian and my French. I can still get along in French.",
        "A: I think if you saw the Holocaust video tape, they might know more than my\nchildren. Although my children might know a lot of other details that they wouldn't\nknow. Did I tell them? I suppose on different occasions, different little snippets,\n'l Agency for International Development\nThomas Buergenthal 72\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 72\nparticularly when my mother used to come and visit we would reminisce. But\nprobably not as much either as I could have or as I should have but at the same time\nyou really as a parent, you know, you can't just try to drum things into kids\u2019 heads\nand if they don't want to ask, there's nothing much to tell. I think their interest is\ngradual, has really come more recent. But maybe, you know, I never know, because\nit may well be that they were afraid to ask, that they thought it would be painful,\nalthough it never has been because in our family we always talked about these\nthings. But maybe they didn't want to ask for a variety of reasons. They certainly, I\ndon't think, can really imagine what it was and they never really asked that kind of\nthing. There was something else you asked me that I've forgotten, the first part. It\nwill come back.",
        "A: Oh, yes, I remember what you asked me, about when I looked at my children, how I\nwould react. Well, you know, every so often when children were sort of my age, I\nwould look at them and I would think, could they survive this? You know, this is the\nage and look, they are such children and this was the age that I was when this\nhappened. Then you somehow think, yes, they could have. When you see street\nchildren in Latin America, how street-smart they are and how they survive, you\nrealize kids have that in them. I've seen this in Brazil, I've seen it in other places, in\nGuatemala. These kids have that survival instinct. But when you look at sort of, our\nThomas Buergenthal 73\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 73\nchildren you say, \u201cNo, they could never make it.\u201d But the fact is they could. There's\ntremendous resilience that children have, some children. Some children may be\nmore sensitive than others but I think children are blessed with this resilience that\nenables them to survive better than grown-ups can survive in many situations.",
        "A: No, nobody held me except my mother and father. But it's interesting, when I came\nback when I found my mother, I think the first year I just stuck to her as if, you\nknow, I kissed her all the time. It was sort of all coming back. But of course I missed\na lot. At the same time, you know, it's sort of curious but I think -- I did eight years\nof school in one year of private tutoring and it turns out I have dyslexia which I\nnever realized I had. One of my children has that problem and he suffered quite a lot\nbecause it appeared in first grade and second grade; it was a problem. I didn't know I\nhad it until he was tested and the doctor tested me and it turned out that my case was\njust as serious as his but because I started so much later, I just learned how to\ncompensate for it. So there are a lot of things that, there were also benefits. Just to\nthink of all the eight years of school one could have skipped without supposedly any\ngreat loss of learning. Although I have always kidded by the fact that I never really\nThomas Buergenthal 14\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 74\nlearned the alphabet properly. I never learned the ABC and stuff, all of these little\nthings that you learned in grade school I never learned.",
        "A: Yes. It shows you that it's not that difficult, that it must be that all you have to do is\njust skip enough classes.",
        "A: Well, this is what I try to tell you, that those of us who went through it all went\nthrough it because we were lucky in everything else. But also in a sense, and I'm still\nable to talk about it today, is because we weren't just weighed down by the\nterribleness of it, that we didn't let it affect our whole life. One has to be able to\nlaugh about things, get raving mad. And some things are funny, some things are sad.",
        "A: Fortunately, not at all, no. It may be because I have never been very introspective so\nit hasn't affected my children. No, not at all. They are\u2014no, I don't think it has\naffected them at all, at least not in any negative way that I can think of. Maybe if the\nHolocaust survivor\u2019s husband and wife -- that might be. But, you know, my wife\nwas a native-born American who hasn't gone through any of this and I think that\nThomas Buergenthal 75\nNovember 28, 1995\nPage 75\nmay make a difference, although I'm not even sure. I think it depends on the family,\nit depends on the attitude of people.",
        "A: Well, I wanted the children to grow up Jewish and so they went to Sunday School,\nthey were Bar Mitzvahed, and all of this. But they were not in a Jewish home in a\nsense that I'm not religious at all. I think my children are more religious, at least two\nof my sons often drag me to a temple on the High Holidays and chide me if I don't\ngo. I think what I try to do which 1s sort of natural, that I try to bring them up in the\nJewish sense from a cultural point of view, that they should have historical sense of\nwhat Judaism means and the contribution of Judaism to culture. And they shouldn't\nbe ashamed of it, that it's something like any other culture, to be proud of.",

I lived in, I taught, except for the first year I taught one year at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania law school and then I taught for 13 years in Buffalo at\nthe State University of New York.

        "A: Not really, more events. You know if you read about or if you see, for example, if\nyou see the people behind the barbed wire in Bosnia, that brings it back, those types\nof things.

It does\nsometimes when I see one of those railroad cars, those sort of open cattle cars, that\nbrings back flashbacks.

        "A: Although you know, let me tell you something that strikes me. I think I mentioned it\nbefore. I am much more sensitive to some of these issues as I get older and I don't\nknow why that is, 1t bothers me in a sense because I've been able to sort of -- I've\nalways prided myself of being able to just put 1t out of my mind. In the sort of last\nten years its, I find it harder to do and I don't know why that is. You know,\nsometimes people when they get very old they suddenly only remember the\nlanguage they spoke when they were little. I don't know what it is but it's strange, I\nsometimes feel I'm going soft because I've been able just to put things very much out\nof my mind all my life. I find I'm much more sensitive now.

Not only, obviously anyone who's mother dies is affected by it but it's\naffected me in terms of the past, much more than I would have thought. Or it's\nsimply old age, I don't know.",
