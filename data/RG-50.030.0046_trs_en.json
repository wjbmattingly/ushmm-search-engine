        "Q: Okay, The camera's on. Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Thomas Buergenthal.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Lubochnia, Czechoslovakia, in 1934.",
        "Q: Would you tell me something about your parents, please? Where did they come from?",
        "A: My mother came \u2014 well, my \u2014 actually, my \u2014 both of my parents came to Czechoslovakia\nfrom Germany. They got, came there when Hitler came to power; and I was born there\nshortly after they got to Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: Tell me about growing up. Did you grow up there? And your very early years, before the\nNazis came.",
        "A: What little I remember, really, in that period: I grew up in Czechoslovakia, in that town, very\nuneventfully; a small resort town. From what I remember, what little I remember, a very\npleasant environment.",
        "Q: You moved at one point. Where did you move to, again, before the Nazis?",
        "A: Well, we moved from Lubochnia to a town in Slovakia called Zilina(ph). The\u2014my, my\nfather had bought a hotel in, in this town in Czechoslovakia, in Lubochnia. It was a hotel that\nwas designed to be for German political refugees awaiting the fall of Hitler. My father\nthought that Hitler would not last more than four years, and he wanted to be nearby and have\nhis friends there. Well, by, by 1938, very few people could come out of Czechoslovakia. So\nthe hotel wasn't going very well. And at that point, we left the hotel and moved to Zilina(ph).",
        "Q: All right. What happened there, when by 1938, '39? Did things change?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 in Slovakia, the Hlinka, Hlinka Guard, which was a fascist group aligned with\nthe Nazis, began harassing Jews and looking for certain people, and my father was one of the\npeople they apparently had on, on some list. It became clear to us that if we didn't leave the\nrisk \u2014 at least, the risk to my parents \u2014 that the risk was very great. And that at some point,\nshortly before the German invasion, we tried to cross the border into Poland. It took about a\nweek to cross the border, 1n, in no-man's-land between Poland and, and Czechoslovakia. The\nlast time when we \u2014 in no-man's-land, when we went \u2014 were shipped back to\nCzechoslovakia, then the Germans were already there, in Czechoslovakia. And it was\ncurious that it was the Germans who actually helped us get into Poland at that point.",
        "Q: How do you mean, helped you?",
        "A: Well, the Germans didn't realize who we were. And my father told them that he was Polish,\nand that the Poles wouldn't let us in. And so they actually carried our suitcases and told the\nPoles that they had to let us in. And that's how we entered Poland.",
        "Q: Okay, Okay. But you entered Poland. And where did you go?",
        "A: Well, we had political refugee status, my father, and we went to Katowice, in southern \u2014 in\nPoland, to await our entry, or the right to leave for England. My father had papers that would\nhave allowed him to go to England. We registered in Katowice with the British Consul and\nwaited there until we were supposed to be called up to, to leave for England. And it was\nreally on the day when the Germans moved into, into Poland, on September first that we\nwere supposed to be leaving for England. And we actually left. What happened was that the\nBritish Consul \u2014 there were quite a number of refugees in our position \u2014 were put ona\ntrain chartered by the British to take us to the, to the Balkans, and hopefully, from there to\nEngland. But the plane \u2014 the train \u2014 never got very far; because we were bombed by\nGerman planes and had to abandon the train in Poland not, not very far from the Russian\nborder. And at that point, the question was: \u201cWhat do what do we do next?\u201d My, my father\nactually went and crossed into, into the Soviet Union, across the Bug River; and came back\nand decided \u2014 actually, he had crossed over to see whether we should go to the Soviet\nUnion \u2014 crossed over and decided that we weren't going to be much better off there than if\nwe Stayed in Poland. So he came back. And we then marched with the refugees on the, on\nthe roads and were actually taken over by German tanks on, on the roads near some village\nin Poland. After a while, we ended up in a town more or less in central Poland, called Kielce,\nand eventually ended up in the ghetto of Kielce, and so forth.",
        "Q: Tell us \u2014 by then, you are five. Tell us, if you can \u2014",
        "A: No. By then, I'm \u2014 yeah, five. Yes, six.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me what you remember of Kielce.",
        "A: Well, Kielce was, was \u2014 at least from what I remember initially, or maybe in retrospect \u2014\nit's often very hard to keep these things apart. I had never se \u2014 Kielce really had a very large\nJewish community, and I've since found out that there were more than twenty thousand Jews\nin Kielce \u2014 a long tradition. There were a lot of very religious Jews. There were Jewish\nschools and everything \u2014 things I had never seen before in \u2014 1n Czechoslovakia, where,\nwhere we were. There were \u2014 let me see, what else do I remember from the initial period?\nThere was another language \u2014 two languages, in fact: both Yiddish and Polish. Initially \u2014\nagain, until things, until 1941, '42, things were not all that bad. It was when the when the\nghetto was established, all the Jews were herded into one part of the city.\u2019 Food became very\nscarce. Housing became very scarce. We lived in, in one room that my father and mother and\nI shared. And food was very difficult to come by. A lot of, lot of hunger, but still not as\nserious. There were still a lot of people who lived quite well, who had, had ways of getting\nfood into the, into the ghetto, especially in the beginning. Things gradually became harder\nand harder. And the, the walls were \u2014 protection was built up much heavier than initially.\nInitially, 1t was still possible for people to go in and out, I remember. But after a while that\nbecame more difficult. Then, of course, in 1942, the ghetto. Most of the people in the ghetto\n\u2014 I would think about some close to 20,000 people \u2014 were shipped to Treblinka,\u201d and that\nincluded my grandparents as well. That was sort of the first really serious killing experience\nthat, that I had. During \u2014 I should note, though, that in the ghetto itself there were \u2014 if not\ndaily, certainly sporadic \u2014 killings going on by Germans of people, German guards of Jews\non the street. At the same time, there appeared to be some sort of normalcy that, that reigned,\nbut then in '42, all of that came to an end.",
        "Q: Can you describe the deportation? What did you see?",
        "A: Well, the, the\u2014one morning we were awakened with screaming and shooting outside \u2014\norders in German: \"Everybody out!\" And whoever wasn't to be out would be would be shot,\nand apparently a lot of older people, others who couldn't move, were shot. My father, who\nwas, was a very cool person \u2014 that's sort of the, the memory I have \u2014 wasn't going to move\nuntil he had shaved and had time to think what to do. And \u2014 actually that's what saved us\nbecause he took a group, he took us and a group of people out and marched us to \u2014 he had\nbeen in charge of a shop \u2014 and marched us out to the shop, saying that he had orders to\nprotect the shop and keep the, the people in. And that's \u2014 and safeguard a number of people,\nabout twenty people, protecting the shop. And actually, that's how I was not initially shipped\nout. The \u2014 we did, however, at the end \u2014 when the, when the Nazis finally caught up with\nus \u2014 we were all lined up, as everybody else. And you had most of the people marching in,\nin one direction, and maybe a few hundred people being saved. And we were in that group to\nThe ghetto was established in April 1941.\n; This event, which constituted the liquidation of the ghetto, took place from August 20 to August 24,\n1942.\nend up in another camp, sort of a forced labor camp, also in Kielce. I'm compressing all of\nthis a great deal.",
        "Q: It's okay, we have time, we have time. Can you tell us about the forced labor camp?",
        "A: Well, that was basically \u2014 when you, when you think of the ghetto as a substantial section of\ntown, the forced labor camp was basically one street that was surrounded with barbed wire\nand, and other \u2014 or maybe two streets. And most of the people worked \u2014 were taken out from\nthere to work in various, various jobs. I didn't do anything. I was there with my mother. And\nmatter of fact, my mother had saved two other children from the\u2014whose, whose parents had\n\u2014 were shipped out in, in '42. Two children had been left, and she took them in. So we ended\nup then in, in one-half room, I think, with, with two other children yet. And \u2014 but life still,\nput it \u2014 given what was to follow, was still more or less livable, but very \u2014 under very\ndifficult circumstances. Here the killing increased. Every so often, or anybody tried to\nescape, there would be executions and beatings and other things. The, the worst thing that\nhappened in that camp was towards the end, when the \u2014 when \u2014 I think it was in, in '43, or\nthe beginning of '44 \u2014 and I'm \u2014 my dates are wrong \u2014 when there was another Selektion\u2019.\nBasically, you know, when people were shipped off to be killed. What happened there was\nthat all the \u2014 they lined us up on a sort of like a playground, and separated all the children,\nand that became the, the famous massacre of the children in Kielce. I was the only one to\nsurvive \u2014 at least of the group that was, was visible. Two other children saved themselves by\nhiding in the house where the children were taken. But what happened there was that the, the\nchildren who were taken out, ended up \u2014 were taken to a cemetery and killed with hand\ngrenades. The Jewish cemetery in, in Kielce; I, I survived that one. That was the worst part\nin that, that episode.",
        "Q: How did you survive?",
        "A: Very curious. They had us lined up on the field. The German, the commander of the, of the\ncamp, was standing in the middle making the decision who was going to live and who was\ngoing to die, and they pulled tried to pull me out, and my mother and father more or less\npulled the other direction. And finally, they \u2014 my mother, my father and I deci \u2014 went up to\nthe German commander; and I said, in German, that I \u2014 to let me live, because I could work.\nAnd in German. And I, I think what, what I saw happen in camps a number of times was that\nthey were somehow shocked to find that somebody looked very much like their own\nchildren, who spoke the same language the way their own children would speak, was there.\nThey had \u2014 I think they believed a lot of their own propaganda. And he looked at me and\n; Nazi term for the selection of prisoners for transport.\nsaid in German, \"Well, let's see,\" and let me go. The whole thing may have lasted two\nseconds. And that's how I stayed.",
        "Q: What happened to you after that?",
        "A: Well, after that we ended up in, in a factory, in \u2014 still in Kielce. The surviving people in this\ngroup \u2014 I think about two hundred \u2014 were split up, half taken to one factory, another half to\nanother factory. My parents and I ended up in a, in a \u2014 and, incidentally, the two children\nwho were younger than I that we had then died in that also. We, we ended up in a factory\nwhere they were making carts for \u2014 wooden carts \u2014 for their Eastern Front. At that point I\nhad a very interesting job and assignment. The feeling was that, that to survive there, it was\nimportant to have something to do; and, and I wasn't even 10 years old. So I went to the\ncommander, commander of the German \u2014 of that camp; and told him, asked him whether he\nneeded an errand boy. And he looked at me, and he said, \"Fine.\" And so basically, my, my\njob in that, in that camp consisted of sitting outside his door and doing chores that he needed\nto have done, like getting his bicycle or taking something to one place or another. The, the\njob had great advantages because I could hear what was going on and could report back, and\nI could also alert people to his coming because I would be going ahead of him, running,\nannouncing his coming. And so we had the signal that I would signal. He had \u2014 he wore a\nhat with a feather; and if I went like this to people [gesturing], then he was coming. And \u2014\nbecause if people were seen not working, they would be beaten very badly. One interesting\nepisode in that connection is that I could listen to the radio. He would listen to the radio, and\nI would sit outside, and I could hear. And I heard the, the capture of Mussolini,\u201d reported it.\nOf course, nobody believed me. We had no access to radio or any news. But that was \u2014 and\nthe fact that I worked there actually enabled us to have some food, and my father and mother\nboth worked in that factory. But it was one way of, of surviving, and giving me a cer \u2014\ncertain amount of protection, as well.",
        "Q: Did things change at some point?",
        "A: Well, what changed at, at some point was that in 1944 the decision was made, I guess, to\nship everybody in that camp to Auschwitz. And we were, we were shipped to Auschwitz.\u201d",
        "Q: Can you describe the transport? What was that like?\n' In September 1943.\n\u00b0 In early August 1944.",
        "A: We were in, in open cars, railroad cars\u2014put in. Interestingly enough, the Germans\u2014we, we,\nof course, everybody was worried; and I remember people asking, \"Where are we going?\"\nand so forth. The Germans told us we were being shipped to Germany. And we once \u2014 one\nbelieves what one wants to believe, and I suppose for a while we thought that's where we\nwere going. Again, I remember my father saying initially that the direction of the train was\ngoing to Germany, and then suddenly it, 1t changed. And that's when he knew that we were,\nwe were going to someplace else. And he knew then we were going to Auschwitz. Some\npeople jumped out of the train. The way those trains were set up, the, the Germans had\nmachine guns at the end of the, the train, and if anybody jumped out, they would just try to\nkill the people, and I think a number of people jumped out of the train on the way to \u2014 and I\ndon't know, know whether they were, were hit or not. The, the most memorable thing was to\narrive in, in Auschwitz. It was, you know, from a child's perspective, it was just like having\ndriven into an insane asylum, with people walking back and forth, doing things. We, we saw\na group carrying bricks from one place to another and carrying them back. And we, we\nexpected to be met by machine guns, so we had no idea what the, the arrival in Auschwitz \u2014\napart from, from this total view of people in these prison \u2014 those prison garb carrying,\nrunning different ways, with Kapos\u201d with sticks. Was, was a certain calm. We arrived.\nWe were, we were lined up and told we were going to go to, to a laundry. Had our hair\nshaved. At that point, we expected that things would happen as in Treblinka, where we\nwould be immediately executed. What happened was that since our camp, since our transfer\ncame from these two factories in Kielce, 1t was assumed that everybody there was capable of\nworking. And there was no Selektion. That's really the way I came into Auschwitz. I would\nnever have \u2014 as a child, would never have gotten in because they would have selected me\nright out, at my age, at the camp. But there was no Selektion. We actually went through the,\nthe sauna \u2014 and I mean that they shaved our hair, disinfected us, and eventually, tattooed us;\nbut I don't think right at the, at the arrival and sent us to camp. And we ended up \u2014 this is, of\ncourse, Auschwitz-Birkenau \u2014 ended up in what used to be the Gypsy camp, and was still\nknown as the Zigeunerlager, the, the \"Gypsy camp.\" That's how I got to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Okay. Describe where you were taken and what you did, what the barrack was like where\nyou lived.",
        "A: Well, the barracks were very much like the barracks you see in pictures that one sees. These\nbig three story bunks, very broad, with about ten people fitting into them \u2014 just wooden,\nwooden boards, very crowded. The first night on arrival, that was, was probably one of the\n\u00b0 Overseers (German).\n\u2019 Birkenau section B-IIe.\nworst in, in my experience because this was the night when one or two of the people who\nhad been collaborators in our camp and had shipped some people to Auschwitz were beaten\nvery badly. So this was by people who had \u2014 whom they had shipped to the camp, who in the\nmeantime themselves had become Kapos. The world never changes. But, that was sort of the\nfirst, the first night, that experience. That's, you know, the, the sort of initial thing I\nremember of Auschwitz. We \u2014 there were some people that I. \u2014 my father knew, who had\nbeen shipped out before. There again, my father and some friends thought that the way for\nme to survive was to try to find something to do. And I went \u2014 or rather, I don't know who\nwent. But at any rate, I managed to get to be the errand boy for the Kapo in the, in the\nlaundry and sau \u2014 I don't know what they called it. A place where people... The wash rooms.\nAnd that, again I think, helped because I, I had a certain protection by being there and also\nknowing when the Selektion process was going to, to happen. Because you could \u2014 in\nAuschwitz, the Selektion of people, the Selektion out to the crematorium, to the gas\nchambers would usually happen every six weeks. The Germans, with their efficiency, would\nnever repeat things immediately or do things irregularly. So, you could expect things to\nhappen every four to six weeks, and it usually happened with certain people arriving in the\ncamp. And if you knew that was going to happen and if you were where I was, it gave you a\ncertain amount of protection because you could hide and get out of, out of the way. And that\ncertainly helped me, in some instances, to survive.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what working in a laundry consisted of? I mean, you survived this way.\nWhat did you do there?",
        "A: One of the things that I had to do was to go and fetch gas. Not very often, but I think two or\nthree times \u2014 the same gas that was used for the gassing of people \u2014 this Zyklon C gas\u201d \u2014 to\npick it up, for disinfecting purposes, from the crematorium to the, to the laundry. And that\nwas, and that actually enabled me to go to get out of the camp. But basically, just go deliver\na piece of paper from one place to another, and hang around. I certainly didn't work very\nhard. It wasn't, 1t wasn't a full-time job.",
        "Q: In carrying the gas, did you know that it was the same kind of gas? Did you make a\nconnection?",
        "A: Oh, yes. You, you couldn't, you couldn't live in, in Birkenau without knowing what the gas\nwas for. You have to visualize it. In the, in the Gypsy camp \u2014 that is to say, in the \u2014each \u2014\nthere were a number of camps in Auschwitz, in Birkenau. They were basically streets with\nbarracks on each side surrounded by barbed wire, and there was Camp D and C and B, and\nso forth. The, the gas chambers and crematories were at one side. You could stand, for\nexample, outside your barracks in my camp, and see the smoke billowing out from the, from\n. Zyklon B.\nthe crematory. And not only the smoke, and even almost fire, but also the stench that would\ncome out. So you couldn't be in any place in that environment and not know what was\nhappening. And, of course, 1t was close enough almost to hear the screaming of, of people\n\u2018cause what happened usually, unlike in my case, people would come to Auschwitz at the\nrailroad station, at the \u2014 would be unloaded and there separated \u2014 one group going into the\ncamp, being allowed to go into the camp, and the others going directly to the gas chambers\nand the, and the crematory.",
        "Q: Did you watch this often? Were you in a position to see this process?",
        "A: You \u2014I could see it. To say that I watched it... You, you couldn't help but know what was\ngoing, going on. And as a matter of fact, towards the end, when I was \u2014 at the very end,\nwhen the crematory no longer functioned, we were struck at one point that that suddenly\nthere were birds and other things. There, there was nothing before. It was really sort of a, a\ncloud hanging over the over the place. I was at one point, I was \u2014 later on \u2014 sort of taking the\nstory forward \u2014 I was in a camp that was even closer to the gas chambers and the crematory,\nwhere you could really hear the screaming almost on a...on a regular basis.",
        "Q: Tell me about your parents at this point. You're in Auschwitz. You were with your father?\nWhat happened to your parents?",
        "A: When we came into Auschwitz, my father and I were separated from my mother. My mother\nwas sent to the women's camp in, in Auschwitz, and my father and I were sent together to\nthe, to the Gypsy camp. I saw my mother once during that, that period. I was able \u2014 I was\nsent on some \u2014 or had to go for something to the women's camp; and went just so I could,\ncould see my mother, and we had \u2014 there were systems in which you could get some\nmessages through from one group to the other. But otherwise there were just my, my father\nand I. We were, we were separated, I think, in October of 1944 or, or later \u2014 when there was\nanother, when there was a Selektion. And that was the only time when I wasn't able to\nescape. I \u2014 there were many instances where I avoided the crematorium throughout that\nperiod of stay in, in Auschwitz; but that was the only time when, when I lost. I'd always\ntaken this as sort of a battle between them and us. And I'd always won; because I was never\ncaught up in any Selektion. I was always able to escape. But in the last one, my, my father\nand I, we \u2014 there was a Selektion of people to be sent out to another place, another camp, in\nGermany for work purposes. And Mengele\u2019 and a group of, of doctors were lined up. And\nthey saw me as a child, and they motioned me to go one way, and my father go the other\nway. And that's the last I saw of my, my father. I was retained in the, in the barracks, where\nwe were supposed to then be taken from there to the, to the gas chamber. I knew that you\n\u00b0 Josef Mengele (1911-1979?), extermination camp doctor at Auschwitz.\ncouldn't \u2014 you develop all kinds of expertise as a, as a child growing up. I tried to escape a\nnumber of times \u2014 couldn't, was caught, was beaten and gave up. At that point, I figured\nthere was, there was no way. And I'd tried my best, but it was the end.\nWhat saved me was the fact that there weren't enough people to take to the gas chambers.\nThey made a decision to take us to the sick ward, instead, until they had a larger transport.\nAnd that's what they did. They took us to, to barracks in another camp, which is the camp\ncloser to the crematorium,'\u201d where all of the people had this serious skin disease. It was \u2014 1n,\nin German it was called \"Kratze''.\" I don't know what it is in English, and I didn't develop it.\nThere was a young Polish doctor, who kept giving me alcohol and other things, and told me\nwhat to do. One morning, I, I woke up. I \u2014 it was very difficult in that place to sort of\nseparate nightmares from reality, because you heard the noises all the time. One morning, I\nwoke up and the people I had come with were all gone. And what had happened was that the\nPolish doctor had torn up card with my name on it, which had a \"X\" in back, which meant\nthat I was supposed to go. All the other people were taken out to the gas chamber, and I \u2014 he\nhad written a new card for me, and I was saved. And so...From there, then, I went \u2014 was\nable to get out of that camp \u2014 with the help, curiously enough, of a German\u2014to, to a work\ncamp back in, in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: How did a German help you?",
        "A: I saw a German, and I approached him in German. Told him that I wasn't sick, I shouldn't be\nhere, and I was afraid if I stayed here I would catch something \u2014 couldn't he help me get out?\nAnd he did. And I went to a camp \u2014 the D Lager\u2019 \u2014 which was, which was sort of the major\ncamp. And there was actually there were barracks that sort of children's barracks kids. I think\nall of them were older than, than I was. I, I was about ten at the time. There was a, a Kapo.\nNot really a Kapo, but it was what is known as a Blockiiltester'\u2019 \u2014 the head of the, of the\nbarracks, who had actually sort of indi \u2014 protected the children, saying that they could work.\nAnd he had a whole group of, of young kids.\nTECHNICAL PROBLEMS - LONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: We were in Lager D.\n0 Birkenau section B-IIf.\n\" Scabies (German).\n2 Birkenau section B-IId.\n8 \u201cBlock elder\u2019: The head of a barracks row in the slave-labor and concentration camps, who was\nalmost always a non-Jewish criminal.",
        "A: We were in Lager D, with a, with a group of, of children, and I really don't remember what\nwe did there very much. But it \u2014 that the treatment on the whole, given how bad it had been\nin various other places, was not, not all that bad. We \u2014 there were two of us \u2014 three of us \u2014\nwho became friends. And we had to do all kinds of chores. I remember once we, we broke\ninto the SS kitchen and I drank my first glass of milk in a, in a long time. If they had caught\nus, I suppose they would have beaten us to death. We did those things. We had to, I think\nwhat I remember we had to pick up garbage, and engage in those activities. But then that\nreally didn't last very long because, in Janu \u2014 by January, the liquidation of, of Auschwitz\nhappened. They lined us all up. They came in to announce that the ca \u2014 camp was being\nliquidated. Lined us up, gave us some food, and began to march us out of, out of the camp.\nAnd that started the famous death march out of Auschwitz.\nWe were marched first for about three days, to a town in Upper Silesia called Gliwice. The,\nthe, the three of us kids were together. The kids were put\u2014the, the children's camp group\nwas put in front when we first marched out. But it was \u2014 Polish January is cold, and we didn't\n\u2014 we carried blankets. But after about a 10, 12-hour walk that we began to, to be very tired.\nThe children began to, to fall back. People from the back were pushing, that we weren't\ngoing fast enough. And whoever sat down was, was shot, within, within our view, by the\nguards who were on each side of the road. The three of us developed a system of resting\nwhich was to run up to the front, and then sort of stop almost, until we reached the back. And\nby that time, we had, we had rested, and then we could run up again and we would stay\nwarm. And I don't know how long we did this, but at \u2014 suddenly in the evening there was \u2014\nthey stopped the column and asked for all the children to, to come forward, that they were\ngoing to be put in a farm, on a farm, and they didn't have to march anymore. Well, we had\nhad experience. And we didn't go. And all the children from that group then were, were\ntaken away and apparently shot. So we were the only three that, that stayed. We \u2014 and it\nwasn't easy. There were all kinds of\u2014we, we carried bread, and people kept pushing to get\nthe bread. And everybody had a slice of bread, food, clothes, blankets; and we, we couldn't\ncarry them. After a while, we didn't have anything any more. After three days, we, we came\nto Gliwice, where they did another Selektion out. But the three of us managed to, to run.\nThe, the test was whether you could run across some square, or something. And we together\nheld each other up, and, and made it.\nThat's in Gliwice. They put us on a train which took I think twelve days or so to get to the\ndestination \u2014 my destination. The train stopped at another place, but that was Oranienburg \u2014\nwhich is near Berlin \u2014 where the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen was. I suppose what\nis noteworthy about the train ride: again open cars, January 1945, Polish winters. The train\nwas packed with people. You couldn't breathe. And if you were small, as, as we were, it was\nvery difficult. By the time we arrived, you could walk in the car. People died in tremendous\nnumbers of exposure, of hunger, everything else. And whenever somebody died, they were\nthrown overboard as the as the train moved. I think, in my, in my car alone there were no\nmore than about ten people or so, when we when we arrived for the first time at the railroad\nstation in Berlin. There you might have an interesting footnote to that experience: in Berlin,\nwhen we arrived, I heard a German woman say, \"Es stinkt so wieder nach Juden\" \u2014 which\nmeans, \"It smells again of Jews.\" At the same time, a, a German \u2014 our German guard, who\nwas sitting on our train \u2014 gave me a cup of coffee, which was the first warm thing I, I had\nhad on this entire trip. We \u2014 well, the, the train eventually ended up in Oranienburg, in\nHeinkel \u2014 where there's a factory, airplane factory, where we were kept for about two\nweeks, I, I think.\u201d By that time, I \u2014 the cold was so bad I, I lost some \u2014 my, my legs were\ntotally frostbitten, my hands. Eventually, the toes, some toes had to be amputated. But, you\nknow, Oranienburg, in Heinkel, I remember taking off my shoes and never found my shoes\nagain. They were, they were good shoes. We were there and nothing much happened. Then\nafter two weeks, we were taken to the concentration camp of, of Sachsenhausen \u2014 which was\na German Musterlager, which had been there already in the in the '30's.\nAnd was a\u2014 you came in, there was a big sign saying \"Arbeit Macht das Leben Siiss\" \u2014 all\nof which, which is, \"Work Makes Life Sweet.\" We were put in, in barracks there, after\nactually marching. And it was very difficult at that point for me to, to walk from Heinkel to\nSachsenhausen. German kids were throwing stones at the group that was, that was marching.\nIt was almost a relief to end up in the camp. I don't know how long I was there before I\ncouldn't anymore, with my feet. My toes had turned totally black. And the, the \u2014 1t wasn't\npain; but the nerves were \u2014 I just, I couldn't sleep. I, I could feel everything. I then went to \u2014\nthey had a hospital there. And because it was a model camp, it was actually a well set-up\nhospital. I went there, went into a room. They looked at my foot. And before I knew it, four\npeople grabbed, stretched me out on the table and operated right there on the table, with the I\nthink chloroform or some other thing. They had to operate again because they hadn't \u2014 but\nthe person who operated was a French military doctor, who was very good and very kind,\nand actually saved my leg, because gangrene would have set in. It was black. He saved my\nother foot \u2014 I didn't loose any, any toes on, on my other foot. My, my hands were, were fine.\nAnd then I ended up in the hospital, which, again, was a hospital where usually, after a few\nweeks, you would be \u2014 you would be cured only to be to be killed. But it was coming to the\nend of the war. And actually the camp, the Russians came to the camp in, in April of 1945.\nSo I was, I think, in the, in the hospital ward for about four to six weeks; and was, was\nhelped a lot by, by Norwegians, and others, who so saved my life.\n- The Heinkel facility was a subcamp of Sachsenhausen.\n8 \u201cModel Camp.\u201d Camp after which other camps were modeled.",
        "Q: Tell me, if you would, about your stay in that hospital ward and your meetings with the\nNorwegians. What \u2014 first, what was the ward like?",
        "A: Oh, just a big barracks with, with beds where people \u2014 some were dying, some had...had\nminor injuries. A lot of people -different thing. Every so often, people would be taken out,\npeople would be released. The Selektion was made of people who were actually taken out\nand, and killed, without most of us knowing what was going on. They were called out. The\nNorwegians received packages from the Norwegian Red Cross, or the Swedish Red Cross.\nAnd befriended me and helped me immensely, with \u2014 especially a man by the name of\nFridtjof Nan \u2014 Odd Nansen \u2014 the son of Fridtjof Nansen\u2019\u2019 who was in the camp \u2014 helped me\nwith \u2014 both with food, and also I think with giving food to the people in the ward to, to\nprotect me. It was curious. The, the one thing that I remember from that ward is something\nwhich we \u2014 which people who haven't been in camps don't realize. That when all of this\nterrible tragedy and terrible conditions that were going on, people still had a great sense of\nhumor. It, it didn't leave us. Let me give you one example: in this hospital ward, we had as a\nventilator just a hole in the roof, which was plugged up with a piece of wood.\nSachsenhausen, as I said, was about twenty kilometers outside of Berlin. And when the\nAllies bombed Berlin, the planes would fly over Sachsenhausen. There's another story to\nthis, which I can tell you later. But at any rate, the bombing, of course, the bombs would fall\npretty close. And one day, there, there was a very severe bombing attack, and people were\ngetting out of their beds because of the fear that the barracks would be bombed. And, and\nthere it was all wood and would have been burned. And suddenly there was a tremendous\ncrash of a bomb falling, and a man screaming he's been killed by the bomb. But what had\nhappened was that the piece of wood that had plugged up the ventilator had fallen down, and\njust fallen on him. And, you know \u2014 despite this environment we were in \u2014 that whole block\nof people, maybe a hundred dying people, burst into a roar of laughter which I still\nremember to this day \u2014 about the fact that this poor man thought he had died already. There\nwere many instances of that going on. The other thing which, in which we took great pride\nand joy was that when the bombing raids came, the, the German officers' families and\ninfluential Germans would hide in the camp from the bombing attack. Because the bo \u2014 the\nthe camp was known to the Allies; and they avoided bombing it. As a matter of fact, at night\nthey would drop flares around the camp, in order not to bomb it. And so it was really the\nsafest place nearby. And that, to us, we were beginning to feel that the war, that we were\nmaybe winning.",
        "Q: This is a good moment to change tapes, I think.",
        "A: Uh-huh.\n\u20186 Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930); Norwegian explorer, Nobel peace prize winner.\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: Okay, in the hospital, you tell me that you were befriended by Norwegians \u2014 particularly\nOdd Nansen. Can you tell me something about him, and about your relationship with him?",
        "A: Well, he, he would come and visit various Norwegians 1n the, in the hospital; and that's how\nwe, we met. He, he was writing a diary in the camp. I, of course, didn't know about it at the\ntime. I found out after the war. So he, he came by, talked to a lot of people; and then, when\nhe found out that I was there and that I'd come from Auschwitz, he befriended me. And came\nand visited me almost every week, or maybe even more often and would bring me cookies\nand try and make sure that I was all nght. And brought me ex \u2014 as a matter of fact, brought\nme paper and a pencil to draw. And what, of course, I didn't know was that he wrote down a\nlot of things about my experiences at the time. He was a wonderful man, who had \u2014 really a\ngreat humanitarian; very much in the tradition of his father, who was Fridtjof Nansen \u2014 the\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees during the League of Nations time, after whom the, the\nNansen Passport is named. But he, he helped me immensely. I, I think he, he saved my life.\nHe was then shipped out of the camp shortly before the, the end of the war, when Count\nBernadotte'\u2019 was able to get the Norwegians and Danes out of the camp and get them to\nSweden. At that point we, we didn't see each other again. And after the war, when having\nsurvived I, I tried to, to find him, couldn't remember his name \u2014 only knew that he, that he\nhad a very famous Norwegian name. But wanted to find him and wanted to thank him. I\ndidn't find him until about 1947 or '48, when my mother read in the newspaper that a book\nhad been published. It was a diary of the concentration camp that, among other things dealt\nwith Sachsenhausen. And that it was a Norwegian who had published it. At that point, we,\nwe wrote to him, asking whether he knew that, who that Norwegian might be who helped me\nin the camp. And, of course, it was he. There's a great story to this because I \u2014 mail, of\ncourse, was very slow 1n those days, after the war. Food was very scarce. We didn't hear\nfrom him for \u2014 we didn't receive an answer to the letter for about four or six weeks. And one\nday, there's a knock at the door in the house where we lived in Germany \u2014 in Gottingen \u2014 and\nup pulled a Norwegian military truck. And the soldier came out, and asked whether this was\nour home. And we said, \"Yes.\" And he said he had a little package for us. And so we said,\n\"Well, give it to us.\" And he said, \"No, no. It's, \u2014 we need to carry it.\" And they \u2014 then a\ngroup of Norwegian soldiers jumped out of the car, and brought this tremendous crate \u2014\nwooden crate \u2014 of food that had been collected by Norwegian children, with a letter from\nhim. And shortly thereafter, he came and actually took me to Norway for a few weeks. And\n\u2014 because he had thought that I had died in the camp. And the book, in fact, that he published\nabout the camp \u2014 the diary \u2014 was dedicated to me, among other people, on the assumption\nthat I hadn't survived the \u2014 the camp. So it was a wonderful reunion when we when we\nfinally got together.\n7 Folke Bernadotte (1895-1948); Swedish statesman, Count of Wisbourg and nephew of King\nGustav V.",
        "Q: Okay, let's go back to you in the hospital. When were you released from the hospital?",
        "A: I really wasn't. The camp \u2014 the Germans lost the war before I was released from the hospital,\nor rather, they had to leave the, the camp. Again, this camp was to be liquidated, and people\nwere lined up to march out of the camp. We, we really couldn't walk, and the people in the\nhospital ward were left behind. And we assumed that they would come in and shoot\neverybody in our beds, and it was extremely \u2014 I remember the day when people lined up, and\nthen it became extremely quiet. And you couldn't hear anything. You only \u2014 and we waited,\nbasically, on the assumption that any minute now they would, they would come in. Nothing\nhappened. And of all the people in that, in the barracks, I probably could move better. By\nthen, I had a crutch; and I could move on, on one leg. And finally, I went out to look. With\nall this silence. And the machine gun on the gate of the\u2014overlooking the, the sort of plaza in\nthe camp was empty, for the first ttme. And the Germans had left. You \u2014 by then, you could\nhear already the rumbling of artillery in \u2014 in the background. And there wasn't a soul to be\nseen. Nothing happened for a while, except, you know, we, we realized that maybe we were,\nwe were going to live. The shooting came closer. Eventually the gates swung open and\nRussian troops came in. And they began ringing the, the camp bell to say that we were free.\nThere was \u2014 that, that was freedom. And the first thing, of course, that happened then was\nthat anybody who could move stormed into the German, where the Germans kept provisions,\nand tried to grab as much food as, as possible. I had eaten so little in that time that I couldn't\neat. I remember the only thing I took was a pickle. I found a pickle, and, and I ate it. And\nmaybe that's what saved me, actually, because people died by simply eating too much, and\nnot having eaten for a long time and not being used to, to the food. As a matter of fact, I'll\ncome back to that later. I couldn't eat for anything very much, for weeks after my, my\nliberation. Just couldn't. Could barely eat anything more than a piece of, of dry bread, but a\nlot of people ate and got extremely sick.\nThe Russians did nothing, really. There was no \u2014 unlike from what I hear about the camps\nthat were liberated by the British or American troops, or French troops, there was no doctors\nsent in. No first aid. No supplies. Nothing. We were just simply told we were free, and we\ncould go. And the direction we should go was away from Berlin, because Berlin was still\nnot, not captured. This was about April 20th or so, 1945.'\u00b0 And so whoever could move,\nwent. And there was with me in, in the hospital a, a Pole who he and I got up, and we\ndecided to try to...to move, to...to go, leave the camp. And we got out into Sachsen \u2014 into\nOranienburg, the town where Sachsenhausen was, and there the houses were empty. The\nGermans had, left their homes, left food almost on the table, and, and had left, and we sort of\n8 Sachsenhausen was liberated April 27, 1945.\nmoved from one place to another, from one of these homes to another, until we came upon a\ngroup of the \u2014 a Polish division under Russian command \u2014 the First Division Kosciusko\u2019.\nAnd by then we had accumulated a group of people, about five or six people, all from\nPoland. The \u2014 the Polish soldiers saw me, assumed I was Polish. I, I spoke Polish. And didn't\n\u2014 they had to speak German at the time, of course. And asked me whether I was from\nPoland; and I said, \"Yes.\" And then they said, well, they'll take me to Poland. And so what\nthey did was take me along in with their group. And their \u2014 this particular group was the\nscout company of the First Polish Division. And I became the mascot of the, of the Division.\nI was given a horse and a, a little cart. As a matter of fact, they had, they had captured a\nGerman circus, and this was a small pony. I had my pony, and moved with the troops.\nAnd actually, I always say I helped capture Berlin with my troops because we actually\nmoved on Berlin. And I was in Berlin before Berlin fell, because the, the troops came in. The\nRussians had already advanced, Russian troops had already moved in. But I was in Berlin\nbefore Berlin fell, on the outskirts of Berlin \u2014 actually, in Berlin with Polish, troops. It's\nnever mentioned that Polish troops were in Berlin among the conquerors, and it, it's true. We,\nwe were there. We, actually, until Germany surrendered I was \u2014 we were still following\nGerman troops beyond Berlin. After the fall of Germany, the Polish troops were being\nmoved back to, to Poland. And I was moving back with them. And we initially moved to a,\nto a military garrison in Poland called SiedlIce. It's a town in, in Poland, where I've spent\nsome time until a, a Jewish-Polish soldier in my company took me out one day and took me\nto a Jewish orphanage in Otwock and left me there, and there were a lot of Jewish children in\nthat in the orphanage, that we \u2014 for the first time, I sort of began to live something of a, of a\nnormal life. The period in the orphanage is interesting \u2014 again, as a sort of historical footnote\n\u2014 because our orphanage was an orphanage run by the Jewish Bund, which was a socialist\ncommunist Jewish organization that didn't want people to go to Palestine then. At the same\ntime, the Zionist group \u2014 the Ha-Shomer Ha-Za\u2019ir\u2019\u2019 \u2014 had more or less infiltrated the\norphanage. And there was one counselor who got all of us who wan \u2014 those who wanted to\ngo to, to Israel \u2014 1t was then Palestine \u2014 put the names on a list. And would then run away,\none by one, to the Zionist kibbutz in Poland, or camp. And from \u2014 and would be shipped\nfrom there to Palestine, and I signed up for this group.\nProblem was that, that I was the only one who had been in Auschwitz and in other camps.\nAnd so the decision was made that I should run away last because I would be interviewed on\nnewsreel and on radio about my camp, and they thought that if I ran away it would blow the\n\" The Tadeusz Kosciusko Division appeared in July 1943 and was comprised of Polish patriots\nunder Russian command.

So I was put on to, on the list. The list was sent to the Jewish Agency for\nPalestine, to Jerusalem, but I was told that I would be told when to run away, but I would be\nthe last person. In the meantime, something unbelievable happened. My mother had survived\nthe camp. And my brother, my mother's brother was here in the United States. And they\nbegan looking for me all over, of course, after the war. And they couldn't find me. My\nmother never gave up hope that I was alive. Everybody told her, \"It's impossible that he\nsurvived.\" But she believed that I survived. And among other places where they looked, of\ncourse, was the Jewish Agency for Palestine. Somebody in the Search Bureau of the Jewish\nAgency for Palestine noticed that there was a child in an orphanage in Poland who was\ngoing to be coming to Palestine, who met the description of the child that the woman was\nlooking for in Germany and notified my uncle in the United States. And that's how they, how\nI was eventually reunited with my mother. What happened was that, the, the \u2014 1t wasn't all\nthat easy to leave Poland, you know, I had no papers or anything else. And my mother was\nin Germany at the time, in the, in the British zone, so the American Joint Distribution\nCommittee basically smuggled me out in December of 1946 from Poland to Czechoslovakia,\nCzechoslovakia to the American zone, and then the American zone to the British zone in\nGermany, until I was reunited with my mother. And there was the Joint operated with the\nBrichah*', which had bribed a lot of people on the border. And that's how I got to Germany\nin '46. That was really three years after I'd been separated from my mother. But the \u2014 I think\nthe most telling thing is, 1s the faith that my mother had that I was alive. And there was no\nway for anybody to shake her in the belief that, that I was alive. And I, I really never looked.\nI assumed that if my mother or father were alive, they were going to find me.

        "A: You'll be surprised to hear it when I say to school, as a good academic. No, what I \u2014 what we\ndid was Gottingen was my mother's home town. My father and mother had a, had different\nmeeting places that they had agreed upon if they survived the war. One was in Kielce.

I came, and I had really no schooling\nwhatsoever, and we lived in Gottingen.\nSo I was put \u2014 I was taught a year of private tutoring, and then enrolled in the high school in\nGottingen. And was the \u2014 the only Jewish kid in \u2014 in school in that town, and the only\nJewish kid that anybody in that town \u2014 at least, the children \u2014 had seen. Which was, in itself,\nan experience because they always expected to find somebody with a long nose, and, you\nknow, all the caricatures out of the Sttirmer and other German newspapers. Initially it was\ndifficult. One, one is \u2014 ort of comes with a certain hatred to the town of the people who did\nall of this. And initially, I had this desire of sitting on my balcony to take a machine gun and\nshoot everybody who \u2014 then, gradually, you meet the children and their parents; and the\nabstract of the Germans becomes the reality of human beings. And you sort of gradually\nshed the hatred, and you integrate in the town and tn the school. It helped to \u2014 we spoke\nabout Nansen before. One of the things that I didn't mention was that when Nansen's book\nwas published in German he gave the proceeds for that book to German refugees. And his\nwhole approach to the Holocaust and to the problem was one of reconciliation. And that\nmade a great impression on me, living in that environment and seeing people who hadn't\nparticipated in these killings. But I, I never really felt at home in any sense, in, in Germany;\nalthough I was treated well. Made a lot of friends. Then, in 1951, I, I came to the United\nStates. I came initially alone, just to stay for one year. Came to live with my uncle, who lived\nin New Jersey. And never went back.",
        "Q: What did your mother do?",
        "A: My mother remarried; stayed initially in Germany, but really remarried. And she and her\nhusband, who had been also in, in camp, in some of our camps, went to Italy. He had some\nrelatives in Italy who were in business, and he went to live in Italy. She never came to the\nUnited \u2014 I mean, she came to visit often, but she never came to live in this country. She had\nthis strange notion that if she came to the United States she'd have to work in a factory. And\nhaving worked during the war, she wasn't going to \u2014 despite the fact that we tried to disabuse\nher of this, 1t never worked. She still comes to visit only.",
        "Q: And when you came here, you did work in a factory.",
        "A: Yes, but \u2014 I, well, I came. I had a wonderful \u2014 my uncle and aunt were wonderful to me.\nThey took me in. Was just living as a\u2014 I mean, obviously it was my family; but they, they\nweren't wealthy. They were, they were people who themselves worked in the factory and\nstores. They took me in. They had one daughter, and they treated me like a son. And I came\nin December. In January, I was in high school in Paterson, New Jersey, and became a high\nschool student like everybody else in the United States and enjoyed it very much. I, I liked it.\nI was treated very well. They \u2014 I was tremendously impressed with the very different\natmosphere in the high school from the German environment. Germany was academically\nhigher. The American high schools are a wonderful laboratory of democracy in so many\nways. I liked it very much. And the teachers, I felt, were very good. And they helped me\nimmensely. And they helped me get into college, and so forth.",
        "Q: Is there anything you'd like to add? Any part of the story you want to fill in?",
        "A: Well, you know, I, I think I, I should go on with the, with the college story, in a sense\nbecause it, it's sort of relevant I think for Americans too, in many ways. It's almost part of\nAmericana in its, in its true sense. I\u2014 when I went to high school, of course, I knew nothing\nabout what one does from there on on. All I knew was that I wanted to go and become a\nlawyer, and, and, and write. And, of course, to many people that seemed totally outrageous.\nFor somebody who had just come, that you'd be able to go to university, being an immigrant,\nand so forth. But I had a wonderful advisor \u2014 college advisor\u2014in, in high school, who gave\nme a list of, of ten colleges. And she said all small colleges, that I should write to. And she\ntold me what to write, asking for a scholarship and admission, and that's what I did. The\nproblem was that most of the colleges, on seeing my record looked at it and saw that here\nwas this kid who had had no school\u2014except basically two and a half years of school in, in\nGermany and about a year of high school in New Jersey, and he wanted to go to college and\nhe wanted a scholarship. So the reaction from most of them was: \"Well, we'd admit you, but\nwe can't give you a scholarship until we see how you perform in the first year.\" Well, I\ncouldn't, couldn't afford it. One college I'd written to for a catalog \u2014 which was the sort of the\nfirst step \u2014 was Bethany College in, in West Virginia. And Bethany College, I received the\ncatalog. I opened the catalog, and it said, \"This is a Christian college.\" Coming from Europe,\nwith my experience, I thought that meant that, that they didn't want me. So I didn't apply.\nAnd time went by \u2014 a number of weeks, or months. One day I get called to the, my\ncounselor's office. And she says that \"There is somebody here from Bethany College who\nwould like to meet you.\" And I'm introduced. And the first thing the person says to me is,\n\"Why\u2014you, you, you wrote to Bethany, we sent you the catalog.

        "A: Thomas Buergenthal.",
        "A: I was born in Lubochnia, Czechoslovakia, in 1934.",
        "A: My mother came \u2014 well, my \u2014 actually, my \u2014 both of my parents came to Czechoslovakia\nfrom Germany. They got, came there when Hitler came to power; and I was born there\nshortly after they got to Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: What little I remember, really, in that period: I grew up in Czechoslovakia, in that town, very\nuneventfully; a small resort town. From what I remember, what little I remember, a very\npleasant environment.",
        "A: Well, we moved from Lubochnia to a town in Slovakia called Zilina(ph). The\u2014my, my\nfather had bought a hotel in, in this town in Czechoslovakia, in Lubochnia. It was a hotel that\nwas designed to be for German political refugees awaiting the fall of Hitler. My father\nthought that Hitler would not last more than four years, and he wanted to be nearby and have\nhis friends there. Well, by, by 1938, very few people could come out of Czechoslovakia. So\nthe hotel wasn't going very well. And at that point, we left the hotel and moved to Zilina(ph).",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 in Slovakia, the Hlinka, Hlinka Guard, which was a fascist group aligned with\nthe Nazis, began harassing Jews and looking for certain people, and my father was one of the\npeople they apparently had on, on some list. It became clear to us that if we didn't leave the\nrisk \u2014 at least, the risk to my parents \u2014 that the risk was very great. And that at some point,\nshortly before the German invasion, we tried to cross the border into Poland. It took about a\nweek to cross the border, 1n, in no-man's-land between Poland and, and Czechoslovakia. The\nlast time when we \u2014 in no-man's-land, when we went \u2014 were shipped back to\nCzechoslovakia, then the Germans were already there, in Czechoslovakia. And it was\ncurious that it was the Germans who actually helped us get into Poland at that point.",
        "A: Well, the Germans didn't realize who we were. And my father told them that he was Polish,\nand that the Poles wouldn't let us in. And so they actually carried our suitcases and told the\nPoles that they had to let us in. And that's how we entered Poland.",
        "A: Well, we had political refugee status, my father, and we went to Katowice, in southern \u2014 in\nPoland, to await our entry, or the right to leave for England. My father had papers that would\nhave allowed him to go to England. We registered in Katowice with the British Consul and\nwaited there until we were supposed to be called up to, to leave for England. And it was\nreally on the day when the Germans moved into, into Poland, on September first that we\nwere supposed to be leaving for England. And we actually left. What happened was that the\nBritish Consul \u2014 there were quite a number of refugees in our position \u2014 were put ona\ntrain chartered by the British to take us to the, to the Balkans, and hopefully, from there to\nEngland. But the plane \u2014 the train \u2014 never got very far; because we were bombed by\nGerman planes and had to abandon the train in Poland not, not very far from the Russian\nborder. And at that point, the question was: \u201cWhat do what do we do next?\u201d My, my father\nactually went and crossed into, into the Soviet Union, across the Bug River; and came back\nand decided \u2014 actually, he had crossed over to see whether we should go to the Soviet\nUnion \u2014 crossed over and decided that we weren't going to be much better off there than if\nwe Stayed in Poland. So he came back. And we then marched with the refugees on the, on\nthe roads and were actually taken over by German tanks on, on the roads near some village\nin Poland. After a while, we ended up in a town more or less in central Poland, called Kielce,\nand eventually ended up in the ghetto of Kielce, and so forth.",
        "A: No. By then, I'm \u2014 yeah, five. Yes, six.",
        "A: Well, Kielce was, was \u2014 at least from what I remember initially, or maybe in retrospect \u2014\nit's often very hard to keep these things apart. I had never se \u2014 Kielce really had a very large\nJewish community, and I've since found out that there were more than twenty thousand Jews\nin Kielce \u2014 a long tradition. There were a lot of very religious Jews. There were Jewish\nschools and everything \u2014 things I had never seen before in \u2014 1n Czechoslovakia, where,\nwhere we were. There were \u2014 let me see, what else do I remember from the initial period?\nThere was another language \u2014 two languages, in fact: both Yiddish and Polish. Initially \u2014\nagain, until things, until 1941, '42, things were not all that bad. It was when the when the\nghetto was established, all the Jews were herded into one part of the city.\u2019 Food became very\nscarce. Housing became very scarce. We lived in, in one room that my father and mother and\nI shared. And food was very difficult to come by. A lot of, lot of hunger, but still not as\nserious. There were still a lot of people who lived quite well, who had, had ways of getting\nfood into the, into the ghetto, especially in the beginning. Things gradually became harder\nand harder. And the, the walls were \u2014 protection was built up much heavier than initially.\nInitially, 1t was still possible for people to go in and out, I remember. But after a while that\nbecame more difficult. Then, of course, in 1942, the ghetto. Most of the people in the ghetto\n\u2014 I would think about some close to 20,000 people \u2014 were shipped to Treblinka,\u201d and that\nincluded my grandparents as well. That was sort of the first really serious killing experience\nthat, that I had. During \u2014 I should note, though, that in the ghetto itself there were \u2014 if not\ndaily, certainly sporadic \u2014 killings going on by Germans of people, German guards of Jews\non the street. At the same time, there appeared to be some sort of normalcy that, that reigned,\nbut then in '42, all of that came to an end.",
        "A: Well, the, the\u2014one morning we were awakened with screaming and shooting outside \u2014\norders in German: \"Everybody out!\" And whoever wasn't to be out would be would be shot,\nand apparently a lot of older people, others who couldn't move, were shot. My father, who\nwas, was a very cool person \u2014 that's sort of the, the memory I have \u2014 wasn't going to move\nuntil he had shaved and had time to think what to do. And \u2014 actually that's what saved us\nbecause he took a group, he took us and a group of people out and marched us to \u2014 he had\nbeen in charge of a shop \u2014 and marched us out to the shop, saying that he had orders to\nprotect the shop and keep the, the people in. And that's \u2014 and safeguard a number of people,\nabout twenty people, protecting the shop. And actually, that's how I was not initially shipped\nout. The \u2014 we did, however, at the end \u2014 when the, when the Nazis finally caught up with\nus \u2014 we were all lined up, as everybody else. And you had most of the people marching in,\nin one direction, and maybe a few hundred people being saved. And we were in that group to\nThe ghetto was established in April 1941.\n; This event, which constituted the liquidation of the ghetto, took place from August 20 to August 24,\n1942.\nend up in another camp, sort of a forced labor camp, also in Kielce. I'm compressing all of\nthis a great deal.",
        "A: Well, that was basically \u2014 when you, when you think of the ghetto as a substantial section of\ntown, the forced labor camp was basically one street that was surrounded with barbed wire\nand, and other \u2014 or maybe two streets. And most of the people worked \u2014 were taken out from\nthere to work in various, various jobs. I didn't do anything. I was there with my mother. And\nmatter of fact, my mother had saved two other children from the\u2014whose, whose parents had\n\u2014 were shipped out in, in '42. Two children had been left, and she took them in. So we ended\nup then in, in one-half room, I think, with, with two other children yet. And \u2014 but life still,\nput it \u2014 given what was to follow, was still more or less livable, but very \u2014 under very\ndifficult circumstances. Here the killing increased. Every so often, or anybody tried to\nescape, there would be executions and beatings and other things. The, the worst thing that\nhappened in that camp was towards the end, when the \u2014 when \u2014 I think it was in, in '43, or\nthe beginning of '44 \u2014 and I'm \u2014 my dates are wrong \u2014 when there was another Selektion\u2019.\nBasically, you know, when people were shipped off to be killed. What happened there was\nthat all the \u2014 they lined us up on a sort of like a playground, and separated all the children,\nand that became the, the famous massacre of the children in Kielce. I was the only one to\nsurvive \u2014 at least of the group that was, was visible. Two other children saved themselves by\nhiding in the house where the children were taken. But what happened there was that the, the\nchildren who were taken out, ended up \u2014 were taken to a cemetery and killed with hand\ngrenades. The Jewish cemetery in, in Kielce; I, I survived that one. That was the worst part\nin that, that episode.",
        "A: Very curious. They had us lined up on the field. The German, the commander of the, of the\ncamp, was standing in the middle making the decision who was going to live and who was\ngoing to die, and they pulled tried to pull me out, and my mother and father more or less\npulled the other direction. And finally, they \u2014 my mother, my father and I deci \u2014 went up to\nthe German commander; and I said, in German, that I \u2014 to let me live, because I could work.\nAnd in German. And I, I think what, what I saw happen in camps a number of times was that\nthey were somehow shocked to find that somebody looked very much like their own\nchildren, who spoke the same language the way their own children would speak, was there.\nThey had \u2014 I think they believed a lot of their own propaganda. And he looked at me and\n; Nazi term for the selection of prisoners for transport.\nsaid in German, \"Well, let's see,\" and let me go. The whole thing may have lasted two\nseconds. And that's how I stayed.",
        "A: Well, after that we ended up in, in a factory, in \u2014 still in Kielce. The surviving people in this\ngroup \u2014 I think about two hundred \u2014 were split up, half taken to one factory, another half to\nanother factory. My parents and I ended up in a, in a \u2014 and, incidentally, the two children\nwho were younger than I that we had then died in that also. We, we ended up in a factory\nwhere they were making carts for \u2014 wooden carts \u2014 for their Eastern Front. At that point I\nhad a very interesting job and assignment. The feeling was that, that to survive there, it was\nimportant to have something to do; and, and I wasn't even 10 years old. So I went to the\ncommander, commander of the German \u2014 of that camp; and told him, asked him whether he\nneeded an errand boy. And he looked at me, and he said, \"Fine.\" And so basically, my, my\njob in that, in that camp consisted of sitting outside his door and doing chores that he needed\nto have done, like getting his bicycle or taking something to one place or another. The, the\njob had great advantages because I could hear what was going on and could report back, and\nI could also alert people to his coming because I would be going ahead of him, running,\nannouncing his coming. And so we had the signal that I would signal. He had \u2014 he wore a\nhat with a feather; and if I went like this to people [gesturing], then he was coming. And \u2014\nbecause if people were seen not working, they would be beaten very badly. One interesting\nepisode in that connection is that I could listen to the radio. He would listen to the radio, and\nI would sit outside, and I could hear. And I heard the, the capture of Mussolini,\u201d reported it.\nOf course, nobody believed me. We had no access to radio or any news. But that was \u2014 and\nthe fact that I worked there actually enabled us to have some food, and my father and mother\nboth worked in that factory. But it was one way of, of surviving, and giving me a cer \u2014\ncertain amount of protection, as well.",
        "A: Well, what changed at, at some point was that in 1944 the decision was made, I guess, to\nship everybody in that camp to Auschwitz. And we were, we were shipped to Auschwitz.\u201d\n' In September 1943.\n\u00b0 In early August 1944.",
        "A: We were in, in open cars, railroad cars\u2014put in. Interestingly enough, the Germans\u2014we, we,\nof course, everybody was worried; and I remember people asking, \"Where are we going?\"\nand so forth. The Germans told us we were being shipped to Germany. And we once \u2014 one\nbelieves what one wants to believe, and I suppose for a while we thought that's where we\nwere going. Again, I remember my father saying initially that the direction of the train was\ngoing to Germany, and then suddenly it, 1t changed. And that's when he knew that we were,\nwe were going to someplace else. And he knew then we were going to Auschwitz. Some\npeople jumped out of the train. The way those trains were set up, the, the Germans had\nmachine guns at the end of the, the train, and if anybody jumped out, they would just try to\nkill the people, and I think a number of people jumped out of the train on the way to \u2014 and I\ndon't know, know whether they were, were hit or not. The, the most memorable thing was to\narrive in, in Auschwitz. It was, you know, from a child's perspective, it was just like having\ndriven into an insane asylum, with people walking back and forth, doing things. We, we saw\na group carrying bricks from one place to another and carrying them back. And we, we\nexpected to be met by machine guns, so we had no idea what the, the arrival in Auschwitz \u2014\napart from, from this total view of people in these prison \u2014 those prison garb carrying,\nrunning different ways, with Kapos\u201d with sticks. Was, was a certain calm. We arrived.\nWe were, we were lined up and told we were going to go to, to a laundry. Had our hair\nshaved. At that point, we expected that things would happen as in Treblinka, where we\nwould be immediately executed. What happened was that since our camp, since our transfer\ncame from these two factories in Kielce, 1t was assumed that everybody there was capable of\nworking. And there was no Selektion. That's really the way I came into Auschwitz. I would\nnever have \u2014 as a child, would never have gotten in because they would have selected me\nright out, at my age, at the camp. But there was no Selektion. We actually went through the,\nthe sauna \u2014 and I mean that they shaved our hair, disinfected us, and eventually, tattooed us;\nbut I don't think right at the, at the arrival and sent us to camp. And we ended up \u2014 this is, of\ncourse, Auschwitz-Birkenau \u2014 ended up in what used to be the Gypsy camp, and was still\nknown as the Zigeunerlager, the, the \"Gypsy camp.\" That's how I got to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Well, the barracks were very much like the barracks you see in pictures that one sees. These\nbig three story bunks, very broad, with about ten people fitting into them \u2014 just wooden,\nwooden boards, very crowded. The first night on arrival, that was, was probably one of the\n\u00b0 Overseers (German).\n\u2019 Birkenau section B-IIe.\nworst in, in my experience because this was the night when one or two of the people who\nhad been collaborators in our camp and had shipped some people to Auschwitz were beaten\nvery badly. So this was by people who had \u2014 whom they had shipped to the camp, who in the\nmeantime themselves had become Kapos. The world never changes. But, that was sort of the\nfirst, the first night, that experience. That's, you know, the, the sort of initial thing I\nremember of Auschwitz. We \u2014 there were some people that I. \u2014 my father knew, who had\nbeen shipped out before. There again, my father and some friends thought that the way for\nme to survive was to try to find something to do. And I went \u2014 or rather, I don't know who\nwent. But at any rate, I managed to get to be the errand boy for the Kapo in the, in the\nlaundry and sau \u2014 I don't know what they called it. A place where people... The wash rooms.\nAnd that, again I think, helped because I, I had a certain protection by being there and also\nknowing when the Selektion process was going to, to happen. Because you could \u2014 in\nAuschwitz, the Selektion of people, the Selektion out to the crematorium, to the gas\nchambers would usually happen every six weeks. The Germans, with their efficiency, would\nnever repeat things immediately or do things irregularly. So, you could expect things to\nhappen every four to six weeks, and it usually happened with certain people arriving in the\ncamp. And if you knew that was going to happen and if you were where I was, it gave you a\ncertain amount of protection because you could hide and get out of, out of the way. And that\ncertainly helped me, in some instances, to survive.",
        "A: One of the things that I had to do was to go and fetch gas. Not very often, but I think two or\nthree times \u2014 the same gas that was used for the gassing of people \u2014 this Zyklon C gas\u201d \u2014 to\npick it up, for disinfecting purposes, from the crematorium to the, to the laundry. And that\nwas, and that actually enabled me to go to get out of the camp. But basically, just go deliver\na piece of paper from one place to another, and hang around. I certainly didn't work very\nhard. It wasn't, 1t wasn't a full-time job.",
        "A: Oh, yes. You, you couldn't, you couldn't live in, in Birkenau without knowing what the gas\nwas for. You have to visualize it. In the, in the Gypsy camp \u2014 that is to say, in the \u2014each \u2014\nthere were a number of camps in Auschwitz, in Birkenau. They were basically streets with\nbarracks on each side surrounded by barbed wire, and there was Camp D and C and B, and\nso forth. The, the gas chambers and crematories were at one side. You could stand, for\nexample, outside your barracks in my camp, and see the smoke billowing out from the, from\n. Zyklon B.\nthe crematory. And not only the smoke, and even almost fire, but also the stench that would\ncome out. So you couldn't be in any place in that environment and not know what was\nhappening. And, of course, 1t was close enough almost to hear the screaming of, of people\n\u2018cause what happened usually, unlike in my case, people would come to Auschwitz at the\nrailroad station, at the \u2014 would be unloaded and there separated \u2014 one group going into the\ncamp, being allowed to go into the camp, and the others going directly to the gas chambers\nand the, and the crematory.",
        "A: You \u2014I could see it. To say that I watched it... You, you couldn't help but know what was\ngoing, going on. And as a matter of fact, towards the end, when I was \u2014 at the very end,\nwhen the crematory no longer functioned, we were struck at one point that that suddenly\nthere were birds and other things. There, there was nothing before. It was really sort of a, a\ncloud hanging over the over the place. I was at one point, I was \u2014 later on \u2014 sort of taking the\nstory forward \u2014 I was in a camp that was even closer to the gas chambers and the crematory,\nwhere you could really hear the screaming almost on a...on a regular basis.",
        "A: When we came into Auschwitz, my father and I were separated from my mother. My mother\nwas sent to the women's camp in, in Auschwitz, and my father and I were sent together to\nthe, to the Gypsy camp. I saw my mother once during that, that period. I was able \u2014 I was\nsent on some \u2014 or had to go for something to the women's camp; and went just so I could,\ncould see my mother, and we had \u2014 there were systems in which you could get some\nmessages through from one group to the other. But otherwise there were just my, my father\nand I. We were, we were separated, I think, in October of 1944 or, or later \u2014 when there was\nanother, when there was a Selektion. And that was the only time when I wasn't able to\nescape. I \u2014 there were many instances where I avoided the crematorium throughout that\nperiod of stay in, in Auschwitz; but that was the only time when, when I lost. I'd always\ntaken this as sort of a battle between them and us. And I'd always won; because I was never\ncaught up in any Selektion. I was always able to escape. But in the last one, my, my father\nand I, we \u2014 there was a Selektion of people to be sent out to another place, another camp, in\nGermany for work purposes. And Mengele\u2019 and a group of, of doctors were lined up. And\nthey saw me as a child, and they motioned me to go one way, and my father go the other\nway. And that's the last I saw of my, my father. I was retained in the, in the barracks, where\nwe were supposed to then be taken from there to the, to the gas chamber. I knew that you\n\u00b0 Josef Mengele (1911-1979?), extermination camp doctor at Auschwitz.\ncouldn't \u2014 you develop all kinds of expertise as a, as a child growing up. I tried to escape a\nnumber of times \u2014 couldn't, was caught, was beaten and gave up. At that point, I figured\nthere was, there was no way. And I'd tried my best, but it was the end.\nWhat saved me was the fact that there weren't enough people to take to the gas chambers.\nThey made a decision to take us to the sick ward, instead, until they had a larger transport.\nAnd that's what they did. They took us to, to barracks in another camp, which is the camp\ncloser to the crematorium,'\u201d where all of the people had this serious skin disease. It was \u2014 1n,\nin German it was called \"Kratze''.\" I don't know what it is in English, and I didn't develop it.\nThere was a young Polish doctor, who kept giving me alcohol and other things, and told me\nwhat to do. One morning, I, I woke up. I \u2014 it was very difficult in that place to sort of\nseparate nightmares from reality, because you heard the noises all the time. One morning, I\nwoke up and the people I had come with were all gone. And what had happened was that the\nPolish doctor had torn up card with my name on it, which had a \"X\" in back, which meant\nthat I was supposed to go. All the other people were taken out to the gas chamber, and I \u2014 he\nhad written a new card for me, and I was saved. And so...From there, then, I went \u2014 was\nable to get out of that camp \u2014 with the help, curiously enough, of a German\u2014to, to a work\ncamp back in, in Auschwitz.",

And I went to a camp \u2014 the D Lager\u2019 \u2014 which was, which was sort of the major\ncamp. And there was actually there were barracks that sort of children's barracks kids. I think\nall of them were older than, than I was. I, I was about ten at the time. There was a, a Kapo.\nNot really a Kapo, but it was what is known as a Blockiiltester'\u2019 \u2014 the head of the, of the\nbarracks, who had actually sort of indi \u2014 protected the children, saying that they could work.\nAnd he had a whole group of, of young kids.\nTECHNICAL PROBLEMS - LONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION\n0 Birkenau section B-IIf.\n\" Scabies (German).\n2 Birkenau section B-IId.\n8 \u201cBlock elder\u2019: The head of a barracks row in the slave-labor and concentration camps, who was\nalmost always a non-Jewish criminal.",
        "A: We were in Lager D, with a, with a group of, of children, and I really don't remember what\nwe did there very much. But it \u2014 that the treatment on the whole, given how bad it had been\nin various other places, was not, not all that bad. We \u2014 there were two of us \u2014 three of us \u2014\nwho became friends. And we had to do all kinds of chores. I remember once we, we broke\ninto the SS kitchen and I drank my first glass of milk in a, in a long time. If they had caught\nus, I suppose they would have beaten us to death. We did those things. We had to, I think\nwhat I remember we had to pick up garbage, and engage in those activities. But then that\nreally didn't last very long because, in Janu \u2014 by January, the liquidation of, of Auschwitz\nhappened. They lined us all up. They came in to announce that the ca \u2014 camp was being\nliquidated. Lined us up, gave us some food, and began to march us out of, out of the camp.\nAnd that started the famous death march out of Auschwitz.\nWe were marched first for about three days, to a town in Upper Silesia called Gliwice. The,\nthe, the three of us kids were together. The kids were put\u2014the, the children's camp group\nwas put in front when we first marched out. But it was \u2014 Polish January is cold, and we didn't\n\u2014 we carried blankets. But after about a 10, 12-hour walk that we began to, to be very tired.\nThe children began to, to fall back. People from the back were pushing, that we weren't\ngoing fast enough. And whoever sat down was, was shot, within, within our view, by the\nguards who were on each side of the road. The three of us developed a system of resting\nwhich was to run up to the front, and then sort of stop almost, until we reached the back. And\nby that time, we had, we had rested, and then we could run up again and we would stay\nwarm. And I don't know how long we did this, but at \u2014 suddenly in the evening there was \u2014\nthey stopped the column and asked for all the children to, to come forward, that they were\ngoing to be put in a farm, on a farm, and they didn't have to march anymore. Well, we had\nhad experience. And we didn't go. And all the children from that group then were, were\ntaken away and apparently shot. So we were the only three that, that stayed. We \u2014 and it\nwasn't easy. There were all kinds of\u2014we, we carried bread, and people kept pushing to get\nthe bread. And everybody had a slice of bread, food, clothes, blankets; and we, we couldn't\ncarry them. After a while, we didn't have anything any more. After three days, we, we came\nto Gliwice, where they did another Selektion out. But the three of us managed to, to run.\nThe, the test was whether you could run across some square, or something. And we together\nheld each other up, and, and made it.\nThat's in Gliwice. They put us on a train which took I think twelve days or so to get to the\ndestination \u2014 my destination. The train stopped at another place, but that was Oranienburg \u2014\nwhich is near Berlin \u2014 where the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen was. I suppose what\nis noteworthy about the train ride: again open cars, January 1945, Polish winters. The train\nwas packed with people. You couldn't breathe. And if you were small, as, as we were, it was\nvery difficult. By the time we arrived, you could walk in the car. People died in tremendous\nnumbers of exposure, of hunger, everything else. And whenever somebody died, they were\nthrown overboard as the as the train moved. I think, in my, in my car alone there were no\nmore than about ten people or so, when we when we arrived for the first time at the railroad\nstation in Berlin. There you might have an interesting footnote to that experience: in Berlin,\nwhen we arrived, I heard a German woman say, \"Es stinkt so wieder nach Juden\" \u2014 which\nmeans, \"It smells again of Jews.\" At the same time, a, a German \u2014 our German guard, who\nwas sitting on our train \u2014 gave me a cup of coffee, which was the first warm thing I, I had\nhad on this entire trip. We \u2014 well, the, the train eventually ended up in Oranienburg, in\nHeinkel \u2014 where there's a factory, airplane factory, where we were kept for about two\nweeks, I, I think.\u201d By that time, I \u2014 the cold was so bad I, I lost some \u2014 my, my legs were\ntotally frostbitten, my hands. Eventually, the toes, some toes had to be amputated. But, you\nknow, Oranienburg, in Heinkel, I remember taking off my shoes and never found my shoes\nagain. They were, they were good shoes. We were there and nothing much happened. Then\nafter two weeks, we were taken to the concentration camp of, of Sachsenhausen \u2014 which was\na German Musterlager, which had been there already in the in the '30's.\nAnd was a\u2014 you came in, there was a big sign saying \"Arbeit Macht das Leben Siiss\" \u2014 all\nof which, which is, \"Work Makes Life Sweet.\" We were put in, in barracks there, after\nactually marching. And it was very difficult at that point for me to, to walk from Heinkel to\nSachsenhausen. German kids were throwing stones at the group that was, that was marching.\nIt was almost a relief to end up in the camp. I don't know how long I was there before I\ncouldn't anymore, with my feet. My toes had turned totally black. And the, the \u2014 1t wasn't\npain; but the nerves were \u2014 I just, I couldn't sleep. I, I could feel everything. I then went to \u2014\nthey had a hospital there. And because it was a model camp, it was actually a well set-up\nhospital. I went there, went into a room. They looked at my foot. And before I knew it, four\npeople grabbed, stretched me out on the table and operated right there on the table, with the I\nthink chloroform or some other thing. They had to operate again because they hadn't \u2014 but\nthe person who operated was a French military doctor, who was very good and very kind,\nand actually saved my leg, because gangrene would have set in. It was black. He saved my\nother foot \u2014 I didn't loose any, any toes on, on my other foot. My, my hands were, were fine.\nAnd then I ended up in the hospital, which, again, was a hospital where usually, after a few\nweeks, you would be \u2014 you would be cured only to be to be killed. But it was coming to the\nend of the war. And actually the camp, the Russians came to the camp in, in April of 1945.\nSo I was, I think, in the, in the hospital ward for about four to six weeks; and was, was\nhelped a lot by, by Norwegians, and others, who so saved my life.\n- The Heinkel facility was a subcamp of Sachsenhausen.\n8 \u201cModel Camp.\u201d Camp after which other camps were modeled.",
        "A: Oh, just a big barracks with, with beds where people \u2014 some were dying, some had...had\nminor injuries. A lot of people -different thing. Every so often, people would be taken out,\npeople would be released. The Selektion was made of people who were actually taken out\nand, and killed, without most of us knowing what was going on. They were called out. The\nNorwegians received packages from the Norwegian Red Cross, or the Swedish Red Cross.\nAnd befriended me and helped me immensely, with \u2014 especially a man by the name of\nFridtjof Nan \u2014 Odd Nansen \u2014 the son of Fridtjof Nansen\u2019\u2019 who was in the camp \u2014 helped me\nwith \u2014 both with food, and also I think with giving food to the people in the ward to, to\nprotect me. It was curious. The, the one thing that I remember from that ward is something\nwhich we \u2014 which people who haven't been in camps don't realize. That when all of this\nterrible tragedy and terrible conditions that were going on, people still had a great sense of\nhumor. It, it didn't leave us. Let me give you one example: in this hospital ward, we had as a\nventilator just a hole in the roof, which was plugged up with a piece of wood.\nSachsenhausen, as I said, was about twenty kilometers outside of Berlin. And when the\nAllies bombed Berlin, the planes would fly over Sachsenhausen. There's another story to\nthis, which I can tell you later. But at any rate, the bombing, of course, the bombs would fall\npretty close. And one day, there, there was a very severe bombing attack, and people were\ngetting out of their beds because of the fear that the barracks would be bombed. And, and\nthere it was all wood and would have been burned. And suddenly there was a tremendous\ncrash of a bomb falling, and a man screaming he's been killed by the bomb. But what had\nhappened was that the piece of wood that had plugged up the ventilator had fallen down, and\njust fallen on him. And, you know \u2014 despite this environment we were in \u2014 that whole block\nof people, maybe a hundred dying people, burst into a roar of laughter which I still\nremember to this day \u2014 about the fact that this poor man thought he had died already. There\nwere many instances of that going on. The other thing which, in which we took great pride\nand joy was that when the bombing raids came, the, the German officers' families and\ninfluential Germans would hide in the camp from the bombing attack. Because the bo \u2014 the\nthe camp was known to the Allies; and they avoided bombing it. As a matter of fact, at night\nthey would drop flares around the camp, in order not to bomb it. And so it was really the\nsafest place nearby. And that, to us, we were beginning to feel that the war, that we were\nmaybe winning.",
        "A: Uh-huh.\n\u20186 Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930); Norwegian explorer, Nobel peace prize winner.\nTAPE #2",
        "A: Well, he, he would come and visit various Norwegians 1n the, in the hospital; and that's how\nwe, we met. He, he was writing a diary in the camp. I, of course, didn't know about it at the\ntime. I found out after the war. So he, he came by, talked to a lot of people; and then, when\nhe found out that I was there and that I'd come from Auschwitz, he befriended me. And came\nand visited me almost every week, or maybe even more often and would bring me cookies\nand try and make sure that I was all nght. And brought me ex \u2014 as a matter of fact, brought\nme paper and a pencil to draw. And what, of course, I didn't know was that he wrote down a\nlot of things about my experiences at the time. He was a wonderful man, who had \u2014 really a\ngreat humanitarian; very much in the tradition of his father, who was Fridtjof Nansen \u2014 the\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees during the League of Nations time, after whom the, the\nNansen Passport is named. But he, he helped me immensely. I, I think he, he saved my life.\nHe was then shipped out of the camp shortly before the, the end of the war, when Count\nBernadotte'\u2019 was able to get the Norwegians and Danes out of the camp and get them to\nSweden. At that point we, we didn't see each other again. And after the war, when having\nsurvived I, I tried to, to find him, couldn't remember his name \u2014 only knew that he, that he\nhad a very famous Norwegian name. But wanted to find him and wanted to thank him. I\ndidn't find him until about 1947 or '48, when my mother read in the newspaper that a book\nhad been published. It was a diary of the concentration camp that, among other things dealt\nwith Sachsenhausen. And that it was a Norwegian who had published it. At that point, we,\nwe wrote to him, asking whether he knew that, who that Norwegian might be who helped me\nin the camp. And, of course, it was he. There's a great story to this because I \u2014 mail, of\ncourse, was very slow 1n those days, after the war. Food was very scarce. We didn't hear\nfrom him for \u2014 we didn't receive an answer to the letter for about four or six weeks. And one\nday, there's a knock at the door in the house where we lived in Germany \u2014 in Gottingen \u2014 and\nup pulled a Norwegian military truck. And the soldier came out, and asked whether this was\nour home. And we said, \"Yes.\" And he said he had a little package for us. And so we said,\n\"Well, give it to us.\" And he said, \"No, no. It's, \u2014 we need to carry it.\" And they \u2014 then a\ngroup of Norwegian soldiers jumped out of the car, and brought this tremendous crate \u2014\nwooden crate \u2014 of food that had been collected by Norwegian children, with a letter from\nhim. And shortly thereafter, he came and actually took me to Norway for a few weeks. And\n\u2014 because he had thought that I had died in the camp. And the book, in fact, that he published\nabout the camp \u2014 the diary \u2014 was dedicated to me, among other people, on the assumption\nthat I hadn't survived the \u2014 the camp. So it was a wonderful reunion when we when we\nfinally got together.\n7 Folke Bernadotte (1895-1948); Swedish statesman, Count of Wisbourg and nephew of King\nGustav V.",
        "A: I really wasn't. The camp \u2014 the Germans lost the war before I was released from the hospital,\nor rather, they had to leave the, the camp. Again, this camp was to be liquidated, and people\nwere lined up to march out of the camp. We, we really couldn't walk, and the people in the\nhospital ward were left behind. And we assumed that they would come in and shoot\neverybody in our beds, and it was extremely \u2014 I remember the day when people lined up, and\nthen it became extremely quiet. And you couldn't hear anything. You only \u2014 and we waited,\nbasically, on the assumption that any minute now they would, they would come in. Nothing\nhappened. And of all the people in that, in the barracks, I probably could move better. By\nthen, I had a crutch; and I could move on, on one leg. And finally, I went out to look. With\nall this silence. And the machine gun on the gate of the\u2014overlooking the, the sort of plaza in\nthe camp was empty, for the first ttme. And the Germans had left. You \u2014 by then, you could\nhear already the rumbling of artillery in \u2014 in the background. And there wasn't a soul to be\nseen. Nothing happened for a while, except, you know, we, we realized that maybe we were,\nwe were going to live. The shooting came closer. Eventually the gates swung open and\nRussian troops came in. And they began ringing the, the camp bell to say that we were free.\nThere was \u2014 that, that was freedom. And the first thing, of course, that happened then was\nthat anybody who could move stormed into the German, where the Germans kept provisions,\nand tried to grab as much food as, as possible. I had eaten so little in that time that I couldn't\neat. I remember the only thing I took was a pickle. I found a pickle, and, and I ate it. And\nmaybe that's what saved me, actually, because people died by simply eating too much, and\nnot having eaten for a long time and not being used to, to the food. As a matter of fact, I'll\ncome back to that later. I couldn't eat for anything very much, for weeks after my, my\nliberation. Just couldn't. Could barely eat anything more than a piece of, of dry bread, but a\nlot of people ate and got extremely sick.\nThe Russians did nothing, really. There was no \u2014 unlike from what I hear about the camps\nthat were liberated by the British or American troops, or French troops, there was no doctors\nsent in. No first aid. No supplies. Nothing. We were just simply told we were free, and we\ncould go. And the direction we should go was away from Berlin, because Berlin was still\nnot, not captured. This was about April 20th or so, 1945.'\u00b0 And so whoever could move,\nwent. And there was with me in, in the hospital a, a Pole who he and I got up, and we\ndecided to try to...to move, to...to go, leave the camp. And we got out into Sachsen \u2014 into\nOranienburg, the town where Sachsenhausen was, and there the houses were empty. The\nGermans had, left their homes, left food almost on the table, and, and had left, and we sort of\n8 Sachsenhausen was liberated April 27, 1945.\nmoved from one place to another, from one of these homes to another, until we came upon a\ngroup of the \u2014 a Polish division under Russian command \u2014 the First Division Kosciusko\u2019.\nAnd by then we had accumulated a group of people, about five or six people, all from\nPoland. The \u2014 the Polish soldiers saw me, assumed I was Polish. I, I spoke Polish. And didn't\n\u2014 they had to speak German at the time, of course. And asked me whether I was from\nPoland; and I said, \"Yes.\" And then they said, well, they'll take me to Poland. And so what\nthey did was take me along in with their group. And their \u2014 this particular group was the\nscout company of the First Polish Division. And I became the mascot of the, of the Division.\nI was given a horse and a, a little cart. As a matter of fact, they had, they had captured a\nGerman circus, and this was a small pony. I had my pony, and moved with the troops.\nAnd actually, I always say I helped capture Berlin with my troops because we actually\nmoved on Berlin. And I was in Berlin before Berlin fell, because the, the troops came in. The\nRussians had already advanced, Russian troops had already moved in. But I was in Berlin\nbefore Berlin fell, on the outskirts of Berlin \u2014 actually, in Berlin with Polish, troops. It's\nnever mentioned that Polish troops were in Berlin among the conquerors, and it, it's true. We,\nwe were there. We, actually, until Germany surrendered I was \u2014 we were still following\nGerman troops beyond Berlin. After the fall of Germany, the Polish troops were being\nmoved back to, to Poland. And I was moving back with them. And we initially moved to a,\nto a military garrison in Poland called SiedlIce. It's a town in, in Poland, where I've spent\nsome time until a, a Jewish-Polish soldier in my company took me out one day and took me\nto a Jewish orphanage in Otwock and left me there, and there were a lot of Jewish children in\nthat in the orphanage, that we \u2014 for the first time, I sort of began to live something of a, of a\nnormal life. The period in the orphanage is interesting \u2014 again, as a sort of historical footnote\n\u2014 because our orphanage was an orphanage run by the Jewish Bund, which was a socialist\ncommunist Jewish organization that didn't want people to go to Palestine then. At the same\ntime, the Zionist group \u2014 the Ha-Shomer Ha-Za\u2019ir\u2019\u2019 \u2014 had more or less infiltrated the\norphanage. And there was one counselor who got all of us who wan \u2014 those who wanted to\ngo to, to Israel \u2014 1t was then Palestine \u2014 put the names on a list. And would then run away,\none by one, to the Zionist kibbutz in Poland, or camp. And from \u2014 and would be shipped\nfrom there to Palestine, and I signed up for this group.\nProblem was that, that I was the only one who had been in Auschwitz and in other camps.\nAnd so the decision was made that I should run away last because I would be interviewed on\nnewsreel and on radio about my camp, and they thought that if I ran away it would blow the\n\" The Tadeusz Kosciusko Division appeared in July 1943 and was comprised of Polish patriots\nunder Russian command.

So I was put on to, on the list. The list was sent to the Jewish Agency for\nPalestine, to Jerusalem, but I was told that I would be told when to run away, but I would be\nthe last person. In the meantime, something unbelievable happened. My mother had survived\nthe camp. And my brother, my mother's brother was here in the United States. And they\nbegan looking for me all over, of course, after the war. And they couldn't find me. My\nmother never gave up hope that I was alive. Everybody told her, \"It's impossible that he\nsurvived.\" But she believed that I survived. And among other places where they looked, of\ncourse, was the Jewish Agency for Palestine. Somebody in the Search Bureau of the Jewish\nAgency for Palestine noticed that there was a child in an orphanage in Poland who was\ngoing to be coming to Palestine, who met the description of the child that the woman was\nlooking for in Germany and notified my uncle in the United States. And that's how they, how\nI was eventually reunited with my mother. What happened was that, the, the \u2014 1t wasn't all\nthat easy to leave Poland, you know, I had no papers or anything else. And my mother was\nin Germany at the time, in the, in the British zone, so the American Joint Distribution\nCommittee basically smuggled me out in December of 1946 from Poland to Czechoslovakia,\nCzechoslovakia to the American zone, and then the American zone to the British zone in\nGermany, until I was reunited with my mother. And there was the Joint operated with the\nBrichah*', which had bribed a lot of people on the border. And that's how I got to Germany\nin '46. That was really three years after I'd been separated from my mother. But the \u2014 I think\nthe most telling thing is, 1s the faith that my mother had that I was alive. And there was no\nway for anybody to shake her in the belief that, that I was alive. And I, I really never looked.\nI assumed that if my mother or father were alive, they were going to find me.

One of the things that I didn't mention was that when Nansen's book\nwas published in German he gave the proceeds for that book to German refugees. And his\nwhole approach to the Holocaust and to the problem was one of reconciliation. And that\nmade a great impression on me, living in that environment and seeing people who hadn't\nparticipated in these killings.

And they helped me get into college, and so forth.",
        "A: Well, you know, I, I think I, I should go on with the, with the college story, in a sense\nbecause it, it's sort of relevant I think for Americans too, in many ways. It's almost part of\nAmericana in its, in its true sense. I\u2014 when I went to high school, of course, I knew nothing\nabout what one does from there on on. All I knew was that I wanted to go and become a\nlawyer, and, and, and write. And, of course, to many people that seemed totally outrageous.\nFor somebody who had just come, that you'd be able to go to university, being an immigrant,\nand so forth. But I had a wonderful advisor \u2014 college advisor\u2014in, in high school, who gave\nme a list of, of ten colleges. And she said all small colleges, that I should write to. And she\ntold me what to write, asking for a scholarship and admission, and that's what I did. The\nproblem was that most of the colleges, on seeing my record looked at it and saw that here\nwas this kid who had had no school\u2014except basically two and a half years of school in, in\nGermany and about a year of high school in New Jersey, and he wanted to go to college and\nhe wanted a scholarship. So the reaction from most of them was: \"Well, we'd admit you, but\nwe can't give you a scholarship until we see how you perform in the first year.\" Well, I\ncouldn't, couldn't afford it. One college I'd written to for a catalog \u2014 which was the sort of the\nfirst step \u2014 was Bethany College in, in West Virginia. And Bethany College, I received the\ncatalog. I opened the catalog, and it said, \"This is a Christian college.\" Coming from Europe,\nwith my experience, I thought that meant that, that they didn't want me. So I didn't apply.\nAnd time went by \u2014 a number of weeks, or months. One day I get called to the, my\ncounselor's office. And she says that \"There is somebody here from Bethany College who\nwould like to meet you.\" And I'm introduced. And the first thing the person says to me is,\n\"Why\u2014you, you, you wrote to Bethany, we sent you the catalog. Why didn't you send in\nyour application?\" I hemmed and hawed, and didn't quite know how to explain this. Finally,\nI told him the truth. And he said, \"Oh, this isn't the case at all! I can tell you that if you apply\nto Bethany College, we'll give you a scholarship and a job. And you can \u2014 you won't need a\npenny in order to graduate from school if you, you know, do well.\" And that's where I went.\nAnd they were\u2014this, this is a school that's founded by the Disciples of Christ. I found it to\nbe an extremely liberal school. Nobody cared what religion I had. They treated me\nwonderfully. I got a good education. I went on from there to New York University and to\nHarvard Law School. And \u2014 but they were the ones who gave me this, this wonderful break.\nThe schools, the, the supposedly \"better\" schools, in quotation marks, weren't going to take a\nchance. And I've always been extremely grateful to, to Bethany College.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\n"
