My father\u2019s name was Ian Kaszamerski(ph). I know that they\nboth were born 1n po \u2014 in Warsaw, I\u2019m not sure, because I don\u2019t remember them.\nAnd I also know that they \u2014 my mother had a brother \u2014 her brother, and he survived\nthe war.

I forgot it. And the sad story about it, about the fact that\nI didn\u2019t meet them, n-neither his or \u2014 him or his wife at that time, I \u2014 and th-the\nother sad thing is that I don\u2019t have any track of that letters that gone between my\nadopted mother and himself. So, I don\u2019t know anything. And I think that \u2014 that my\nadopted mother didn\u2019t ask the right questions, because if she would, maybe I would\nknow where I come from, street, who were my parents, what did they do. I don\u2019t\nknow anything.",

        "Q: So tell me, do you have any early memories of Warsaw at all?",
        "A: The only one memory I have is that \u2014 I think we were very, very young age, that\nI am in a pram, in a baby carriage, with my father, in a \u20141n a park. And it was\nsnowing, wintertime, and I remember what \u2014 wearing this snowsuit, white snowsuit,\nwith a \u2014 with thing for \u2014 they call it mufa in Polish, for the hand, from\n[indecipherable]",

        "Q: And is your f\u2014 do you have any memory of how \u2014 what he looked like?",
        "A: I just think \u2014 I don\u2019t know if \u2014 because I saw his pictures, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s\nmy memory, or what ha \u2014 from what I saw. But I \u2014 I remember somebody very tall,\nvery tall and very beautiful.",
        "Q: And your mother?",
        "A: My mother I remember a little bit later, I think. My mother had dark hair. Both\nof them had black hair, I don\u2019t know how I got my blonde hair. And \u2014 and actually,\nthe first mo \u2014 memory of her is for \u2014 what I thought that it was the beginning of \u2014\nbeginning of the war. It was a \u2014 a day that I remember being in a house, and\neverything, all the doors were open, and 1-1t was plenty of movement on the street,\nand they\u2019re shouting and shooting, and people running. And the \u2014 I remember\nhearing this gunshot, this boom, boom. And the \u2014 I saw my dog, I had the Lassie\ndog, on the floor with a hole in his head and something red was coming out and I\nremember myself \u2014 I remember me crawling to the dog. And then it was noise and\nthe door bin \u2014 opened and the big soldier, he was a Ukraine \u2014",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A:\u2014came in \u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how \u2014 how I know. But I know I \u2014- \u2019m\u2014\nI don\u2019t know how I know that he was Ukraine. He was a big man. He lift me up into\nhis arms. He had red cheeks, and a horrible smell of alcohol from his mouth, and\nmy mother was screaming, and he was laughing and holding me in his arms, and\nlaughing. That\u2019s what I remember from them. Then the next thing I remember is\nbeing in a \u2014 quite a dark apartment. My mother was walking backward and forward\nin the room doing this, you know? And then I remember that 1t was a cupboard\nthere, and my mother used to go into the cupboard. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you go with her?",
        "A: No. I ler \u2014I didn\u2019t look Polish \u2014 I didn\u2019t look Jewish, I think. I didn't go with\nher. She was always very ha \u2014 going into this cupboard, and then one day she\ndisappeared.",
        "Q: And, did your father disappear from your life by that point?",
        "A: Yes, at that time, and I th \u2014 I \u2014 somehow, I was making connection between my\nmother\u2019s walking so the f\u2014 backward and forward in the room, and the \u2014 doing this\nwith the \u2014 the \u2014 the disappearing of my father. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right or wrong,\nbut \u2014",
        "Q: But that was what you think your impression was.",
        "A: That\u2019s what my impression was. And then she disappeared, and I was there in\nthis house. I don\u2019t remember the people there. I just \u2014 somehow, again, I just know.\nAnd this is very strange thing, that I know things. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been told,\ncause I didn\u2019t have anybody to tell me about it, but I know that it \u2014 the \u2014 that was\nout of the ghetto, and I \u2014 I assume that my parents were \u2014 they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nreally live very Jewish life, and they probably had a lot of friends. And my \u2014 my\nuncle was a musician, and he had probably his own artist fre \u2014 friends. So, I assume\nthat that\u2019s how we got out of the ghetto.",
        "Q: So you thi \u2014",
        "A: Or we\u2019ve never been \u2014 I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve been in the ghetto. I\u2019m not sure,\nbut I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So this dark apartment, you don\u2019t know where it was?",

        "A: Part of being in the army, which that we knew, I didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And, you don\u2019t know if, aside from your uncle, whether there were any other\nbrothers and sisters that they had?",
        "A: No, there is a picture that they \u2014 because all these pictures been sent to me by my\nuncle, and that there is a picture that they are in some resort, and there is a picture of\nmy father, my mother, that was before they got married. It was from \u2014 because there\nis a date, 1936. And it was my mother, my father, my uncle, and behind, it was\nwritten, Auntie Bronia(ph), but I don\u2019t know who sister she was.",

I mean that the \u2014 the fact that the \u2014 all\nthese years, nobody showed up, but they \u2014 they \u2014 they lived in a place, in a big city\nlike Warsaw. They probably had friends or relatives, family. Nobody ever, except\nmy uncle, nobody ever showed up.",
        "Q: Well, from the pictures, they look very well-to-do.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: As if they came from a very upper class family.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes. But still.",

        "A: The next memory I have is that my mother is coming to take me from this house,\nfrom this apartment, and we are 1n a very crowded place in, it was probably the\nHotel Polski in Warsaw. And then we\u2019re in a little [indecipherable] train, very,\nvery small place, and people were just next to each other, and it was very hard to\nbreathe. And people were crying and screaming and it was \u2014 1t was \u2014 and I was on\nmy \u2014 in \u2014on my mother\u2019s arms. And then I remember that we got to a place, door\nwere opened, and the \u2014 they took us out, you know, like a cattle.",
        "Q: You remember this? You had this \u2014",
        "A: I remember this. I remember this. I remember they took us to showers, very cold\nshowers. And were \u2014 and plenty of women together in this shower, and my mother\nput me on \u2014 on the floor, which was disgusting. It was cold, and the water \u2014 and wet\nand th \u2014 and then she picked me up. And then, when we got out of the showers, I\nwas with her, and with a man. The story goes that my mother \u2014 that be \u2014 I been tell\n\u2014 told later, that it was this arrangement that the German maid with the Jewish\nauthorities or something, that they will exchange people who had a certificate to\nPalestine for German people who lived in Israel \u2014 in Palestine, at that time. They\nwere the T-Templers, tho \u2014 the big communit \u2014 German community in Palestine.\nAnd we know that some of them really adopted the Nazi 1-ideas. And the Germans\nwanted to exchange them, I think. So they announce that the people who has\ncertificate to Palestine will come to Hotel Polski, which was a hotel in Warsaw,\nand they will take to \u2014 take us to Palestine. My mother found this man who had the\n\u2014 on his papers there were, the woman and a child. But they weren\u2019t exist any more.\nSo she paid him, she gave him the \u2014 what she had. And we were with him.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of him?",
        "A: I have a\u2014I-\u2014I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 whatever it\u2019s \u2014 what - my memory\nabout him 1s \u2014 is something wer \u2014 very frightening. Really frightening, he was a\nvery frightening man to me, because he \u2014 later on we knew that he hit me and sort\nof abused me, not \u2014 not sexually, but he abused me. Because I \u2014 my mother been\ntaken away. As we got out of those showers, my mother disappeared, and I left with\nthe man.",
        "Q: Oh, so you never saw her after that time?",
        "A: I saw her, they took me to see her, she was in the hospital. And I thought that\nthere is a hospit \u2014 there was a hospital out of the camp, but I know now that it was a\nho-hospital ou \u2014 inside the camp.",

        "A: Yeah. I think that she was a \u2014 that time she was very, very sick, because she died\nvery soon after. She had TB, tuberculosis, so she died, and that\u2019s why did \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t let her to leave with all the others, they left her there.

        "A: I don\u2019t know, but I know that I didn\u2019t have a bed for myself in the women\u2019s\nbarrack.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I always slept with someone before, but probably in the beginning it was with\nBronka(ph), and later on with somebody else. And then she said, when she had to\nbe transferred, and she had to be taken away, she said on that day, she said \u2014 she\nsaid that she never \u2014 she didn\u2019t talk about it, because she didn\u2019t want me to hear\nabout it. Somehow probably, I heard. And \u2014 and that day, when she went \u2014 taken,\nshe wanted to say goodbye to me and I dis \u2014 just disappeared. And she looked for\nme, but she didn\u2019t have enough time. And then when she was on the other side of\nthe gate, suddenly she heard this scream, and she saw me running to the gate. And I\ngave her something. She \u2014 I put something in her hand. She put it in he-her pocket.\nAnd then she said, you know, you saved my life. What happened was, that \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s hold onto this thought \u2014",

        "A: Okay, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. And it \u2014 one is coming out and another one is going in. I\u2019m keeping the\naudio running so that nothing is interrupted at all. Okay, and let me say, this is a\ncontinuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lily\nCohen. And you were at the point where you were going to tell us about\nBronka(ph) and having her told you many years later, that you saved her life.",
        "A: That\u2019s what she said.",
        "Q: And there was something you gave her, so tell us about that.",
        "A: So, she said that, before she went away, the women and the camp wanted to pass\nsome kind of news about themselves to the relatives, and they didn\u2019t know that she\nis going to another camp, they thought that she\u2019ll be li-liberated. And they sew in\nher coat, she \u2014 they sew names and addresses and the \u2014 and some information. And\nit was all been sewn to th \u2014 her coat. When she got into Vittel, they \u2014 they started to\ncheck \u2014 check on her. They started with her shoes, they told her to \u2014 to open her\nshoes. And they gone up, and she was \u2014 she said, I was so white, I knew that this 1s\nmy e \u2014 the end of me. And they said, okay, take everything out of your pocket. And\nit was a little statue of Maria and the \u2014 and the baby.",
        "Q: Of the Virgin Mary and the baby. And that\u2019s what you had given her.",
        "A: Yeah. So sh \u2014 th-the guard said, okay, that\u2019s all right, we are not that bad, we are\nnot, you know \u2014 so she said, and that saved my life. And I saw this Virgin Mary\nwith a baby later on in life, she kept it.",
        "Q: And do you remember it, or you don\u2019t have a memory of it?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t have memory. I remember many things from the camp, but I don\u2019t\nremember Bronka(ph).",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t remember the little statue, and where you would have gotten it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t even, no, I don\u2019t remember anything of th \u2014 her stories. Was like \u2014 it is\nlike a black hole. And I tried so much to remember. I didn\u2019t manage it. I thought\nthat maybe that was the only good time that I have there, so it just \u2014",
        "Q: What do you \u2014 what \u2014 do you ha \u2014 do you ha \u2014 you said you had other\nmemories, many other memories?",
        "A: I have other memories. I don\u2019t remember the women who took care of me. I\nknew \u2014 I know that there were many women who took turns to take care of me. I\ndon\u2019t remember their faces. I just knew \u2014 know that they were exist. I \u2014 but I do\nremember that it was a camp just next to ours. And I remember nights, and people\nare standin \u2014 men standing there with those traps. And \u2014 and the little hats, and they\nwere always screaming and shouting and crying from that camp. And I was so\nafraid to go out night to do my things. And ev \u2014 I remember this very, very vivid, I\nremember this \u2014",
        "Q: Were there other children in the women\u2019s barracks?",
        "A: It was \u2014 there were two. It was the girl, and it was another boy.",
        "Q: Were they about your age, or were they older?",
        "A: They \u2014 they were older. They were older. And th \u2014 they were with their mother.\nOne of them, that I heard \u2014 I learned later on, she was adopted by the \u2014 by this\nwoman, because her child was dead, and again, the papers. So she took a girl, and\nshe just her \u2014 her son name was Avraham, she put Avrahama. And that was the\ngirl. And she brought this girl to Israel. And this girl, I \u2014 I never met her, but I met\nthe woman, because she was visiting me on a regular basic \u2014 later on in Israel. So I\nkept in touch with her til the \u2014 her last \u2014 last day. And I \u2014 I remember \u2014 what I\nremember from the camp and all this time I \u2014 all my memories are in black and\nwhite.",
        "Q: How odd.",
        "A: They\u2019re all in black and white. Only when we got \u2014 when we were liberated by\nthe Americans, after the train, which I'll tell about it, and we got to this place which\ncalled [indecipherable] this when my movie starting 1n colors. So, the first time\nthat I remember colors.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s \u2014 I find 1t amazing that you \u2014 we don\u2019t have dates for it, but it sounds as\nif your beginning of darkness happens fairly soon after the war breaks out. That \u2014\nthat your mother and yourself are in a \u2014 in a \u2014 an apartment where she has to go into\nthe cupboard, and then you\u2019re in Hotel Polski, and then you have a train to Bergen-\nBelsen. What year could have this been, and the \u2014 the th \u2014 the other thing is, 1s that\nyou must have been a small child as \u2014 a small baby anyway when you were in\nBergen-Belsen \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 you know. So, in some ways it\u2019s a miracle that \u2014 in many ways it\u2019s a miracle\nthat you survived the entire war incarcerated, whereas most children would not have\nsurvived. They would have been found, discovered, gotten rid of. Because, how\nmuch could they work, you know, and what was their value?",
        "A: Yeah. The only thing is the \u2014 that the children that were \u2014 and now I learned\nabout it more and more, the only children that were surv \u2014 is survive the \u2014 all of\nthem were with some relatives, either aunt, uncle, parents, one of the parents. I was\nthe only one who didn\u2019t have anybody. I cannot say that I\u2014 I came with \u2014 I didn\u2019t\ncome with anybody. Even the woman that, when we being taken out of Bergen-\nBelsen to \u2014 it was April \u2014 no, well, before April, it was the March 45. I was with\none of the women, but she was killed on the train. So again, I \u2014 I left alone.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember [indecipherable] face. I just \u2014 I remember one face, I\nhave this face in front of me, it was laughing and had those dimples\n[indecipherable]. But \u2014",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know whose it was.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: By the time 1945 rolls around, it looks as if, from the documents you have, that\nit \u2014 you\u2019re at least seven years old, something like that. And a seven year old\nalready can have certain memories \u2014",
        "A: So that\u2019s what\u2019s really \u2014 really amazed me. I know from one of the testimonies,\none of the ladies, the \u2014 this woman who had the ba \u2014 the \u2014 the g \u2014 the girl, Nuta(ph)\nGudkowski(ph), that she said that I was \u2014 she knows me from the \u2014 from the\nbeginning. Well, she was with the pe-people in Hotel Polski, and came on the same\ntrain, and being in the same barrack. So she said that \u2014 that I was ol \u2014 four or five,\nand al \u2014 when we got out. So I don\u2019t have any \u2014 again, I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t\nknow. And I don\u2019t have the memory o \u2014 I \u2014 now, when all this train story came up,\nand I hear stories of children who were 11 years old, and 10 year \u2014 no, 12 years old,\nthey have a very vivid memory, and memory 1n order, you know, they can tell a\nstory. I don\u2019t feel that I can tell a story. I don\u2019t have it, somehow. I have pictures, I\nhave, you know, so \u2014",
        "Q: Images.",
        "A: Images. But I don\u2019t have story. I get \u2014 I\u2014 I have more of a story when we \u2014\nwhen we went out of \u2014 of Bergen-Belsen, I remember us walking this much, we\nwalked about 10 kilometers. I remember that when we walked out, it was a kitchen\non the other side of the \u2014 of the gate. And with a horrible smell, you know, the \u2014\nwith smell the \u2014 with the soup that they gave us was horrible, horrible smell. And I\nremember that somebody ran into the kitchen, somebody ra \u2014 from the\n[indecipherable] and he \u2014 and he\u2019d been shot, and then somebody else ran into the\nkitchen, been shot as well. And my adopted mother said that I was telling her this\nstory and I said to her that it was a very funny story, a very funny thing, cause we\nwere walking and somebody ran there, and suddenly it was piff puff and the person\nfell on the ground. And there was another one, there was another piff puff, and the\nperson fell on the ground. It was very fu-funny.",
        "Q: Oh, a child, a child. So it\u2019s \u2014 but you don\u2019t remember telling this story, she is\nsomebody who tells you about that.",
        "A: That \u2014 but I told \u2014 I \u2014 I remembered \u2014 I remembered the event.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that I told them the story, but she remember it. And then I\nremember that there \u2014 I remember that [indecipherable] and there were times that\nthere were many \u2014 there were German officers are picking me up on their arms.\nYou know, probably I was a \u2014 you know, I was a blonde and blue eyes. Maybe\nthat\u2019s what saved me.",
        "Q: So, obviously then, you weren't hidden. If German office \u2014",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t \u2014I\u2014-",
        "Q: \u2014 if German officers were picking you up \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I wasn\u2019t hidden, no. No, I wasn\u2019t hidden, no. I just didn\u2019t have my place, cause\nI always slept with somebody, but I \u2014 no, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything of how you spent the days? Do you think you played\nat all?",
        "A: You know what, I don\u2019t remember conversations. I don\u2019t remember people\ntalking. I don\u2019t \u2014 part of the one that I heard about my mother\u2019s death, I don\u2019t\nremember, I don\u2019t remember people talking to me, or I talking to them. I don\u2019t\nremember me talking.",
        "Q: I had a thought as you were talking earlier, did you feel completely alone?",
        "A: I felt com \u2014 I felt co-completely alone all my life.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what my other question was going to be.",
        "A: All my life. I felt \u2014 of course, I had the love of my adopted family and the \u2014 but I\nalways felt sort of floating, no [indecipherable] like \u2014 like alone in the world. I\nalways felt like no \u2014 this is my \u2014 my biggest memory and my biggest feeling, being\nalone. At the same token, I knew that I have only me for myself, and then \u2014 that I\nhave to rel-rely on myself. It\u2019s th \u2014 there\u2019s no trust. I couldn\u2019t trust, especially\n[indecipherable]. Never trusted them. When I came to the kibbutz, and th \u2014 in my\nkibbutz [indecipherable] they all speak he \u2014 Polish, and they all tried very hard to\nmake me forget Polish. And I, again I was lying in the bed listening to two women\nspeak in Polish. And they were talking about how wonderfully \u2014 wonderfully I\nbeen, you know, recovered, and \u2014 and I was thinking to myself, they don\u2019t know. I\nhave a secret, and I\u2019m not going to tell the secret to anybody.",
        "Q: What was your secret?",
        "A: My life in different place, that I don\u2019t \u2014 I know that I live there, I knew that I was\nthere. I knew that all the things that I \u2014 all the - my memories were exist. But I\ndidn\u2019t want to \u2014 to tell them. I felt that I better keep it to myself. And later on I \u2014 I\nthought that that will be \u2014 that was my strategy to how \u2014 somehow to assimilate and\nto survive. Because I came to a place that there were children with the mothers and\nfathers and they look so healthy and so nice. All the things that I wanted to be, and I\nwasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: You mentioned having an adopted mother \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 later on, but let\u2019s go back in our \u2014 to the chronology of when you\u2019re leaving\nBergen-Belsen \u2014",
        "A: The camp.",
        "Q: \u2014 and you\u2019re on the train.",
        "A: Yeah, we were, again, on the train. I remember being with someone, and I\nremember that we weren\u2019t ri \u2014 we were riding this train, again very many, sort of \u2014\nyou know, many people sitting together, and there was smells. I remember smell.\nAnd \u2014 and tha \u2014 then I remember hearing booming and shooting and then the train\nstopped. And we went under the train. There was shooting. We ran \u2014",
        "Q: Was it open train?",
        "A: \u2014 with the woman.",
        "Q: It was an open \u2014 no roof on it?",
        "A: No, it was a roof \u2014 the train was partly cattle cars and partly passengers car. And\nprobably we were in the cattle car, because it was very \u2014 too cozy. And there were\nshooting and the train stopped, and we ran after \u2014 down to \u2014 underneath the train,\nand then I looked at this woman next to me, and she didn't move. She was dead. So,\nthat was \u2014",
        "Q: Who was doing the shooting, do you know?",
        "A: The German. They wanted to bomb this train. Their plan was, initially, to get rid\nof the plane, to bomb it. And one of their cars were full of explosions. So, what\nhappened in the train, that the \u2014 this train, for a week was riding backward and\nforward, many of the railroads were bombed, so they had to go back. And on the\nway they picked up more workers from labor camps, so the train was full of Polish\npeople from Bergen-Belsen and Hungarians and Finnish and all kind of people that\nthey found. Were 2500 people on the train. And th \u2014 1n the end the pr \u2014 the train\nstopped near a city called Magedburg(ph).",
        "Q: Magdeburg, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And now, I remember that it was a \u2014 a train, and it was a hill here, and I\nsaw there a German running away, running, escaping. And again somebody, some\nyoung soldier came back and said, oh, don\u2019t blame us, we\u2019re not all the same, and\nrun away. And we s-stayed there. This woman next to me was dead, I was under the\ntrain. And then came the Americans. They were all chewing chewing gum. So they",
        "Q: So they liberated you from under a train.",
        "A: They \u2014 yeah, so I got out of the tra-train \u2014 from under the train and they came,\nand I ye \u2014 I don\u2019t remember if \u2014 but I know now that in the beginning it was one\ntank with two s-soldiers. And then they \u2014 they went and they brought others,\nbecause what they saw there wasn\u2019t very nice. There were plenty of people dy-\ndying and dead. They took pictures, there are pictures from that site.\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: And you\u2019ve seen those?",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I do-don\u2019t see myself.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But when you see the pictures, have you recognized some memory?",
        "A: I re \u2014 yes, very much so, because for years I \u2014 I always, in my memory it always\nwas a hill. And then I saw pictures of this train, probably from the other side, which\nwas a plateau. And I thought maybe it was, you know, my memory and it\u2019s not as\naccurate. But when I saw the pictures now, I saw that it was exactly how I\nremember it. And now the \u2014 the American came and they gave us \u2014 they \u2014 I\nremember plenty of \u2014 of \u2014 sort of \u2014 plenty of joy. And they gave us something very,\nvery nice and sweet. Was chocolate. Which I never had before. And then they took\nus \u2014 now, I remember they took us to another camp, which was Buchenwald, and I\nremembered it was Buchenwald. I remember myself now alone, standing in the \u2014\nin the line for food, you know, and walking there. And then they evacuated, they\ntook the pla \u2014 th-the people and they put them to pi \u2014 two places, Fursleben(ph)\nand Hillersleben. And nobody took me, so they all left the camp, and I had my little\ndoll that Bronka(ph) made me, which at that time I think that was leg missing, hand\nmissing, whatever. And I was sitting with this little doll, alone. The whole place\nwas empty.",
        "Q: This is Buchenwald, or \u2014",
        "A: Buchenwald.",
        "Q: Buchenwald, mm-hm.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then it was a woman came back, with her son. She said because they\nall \u2014 they had trucks and all kind of vehicles, and she came back. She came back for\nme. She said, give \u2014 give hand to Tommy and come with us. And I didn\u2019t want to. I\nwanted to stay. I was talk \u2014 this time I was remem \u2014 I remember I was talking to my\ndoll. I was telling her that when everyone left, I was telling her that she shouldn\u2019t be\nafraid, because I am with her and I am taking care of her. So then the \u2014 this lady\nsaid, okay, again she ha \u2014 give hand to Tommy and come with us. Tommy was her\nson. I said, well, I can go by myself. And I went with them. I didn\u2019t give hand to\nTommy. And I went with them, and we were taken to Hillersleben. And was a\nbeautiful, beautiful place. I remember sunshine and be \u2014 remember little white\nhouses, beautiful streets, and bougava \u2014 bougainvillea, which was \u2014 it was a \u2014",
        "Q: So, it was a town, or it was \u2014",
        "A: It was a town.",
        "Q: Town, mm-hm.",
        "A: It was a town that the families of the aviation forces lived. And we got the house\nthere. I was with the Hilde Huppert, it was the name of the lady, and her son,\nTommy. And the \u2014 oh, the flowers, that bougainvillea, that was the purple\nbougainvillea.",
        "Q: So you saw your first flowers.",
        "A: This was \u2014 I saw my flir \u2014 yeah, first flowers. The second time I saw this \u2014 this\nexactly flowers, the wa \u2014 purple bougainvillea, it was in \u2014 in another war. In the\nIndependent war, in Jerusalem. So, I remember \u2014 I remember getting into this\nhouse, and they had bed with sh-sheets, white sheets. I never seen white sheets in\nmy life. And Hilde Huppert put us in the bath, she put me in the bath. And it was\nwarm, and nice, and it wasn\u2019t cold any more. It was very, very nice, I didn\u2019t want to\nget out. And \u2014 and she put me in the bed. In the beginning I was with my clothes, I\nwanted to go on the bed, and she said, no, no, you c \u2014 you\u2019re not allowed with\nclothes on bed. So that was a nice time there. I don\u2019t know how long we were \u2014",
        "Q: Who was she? Who was this lady?",
        "A: She was \u2014 she was one of those Palestinians. Her husband had the\n[indecipherable] send them the Palestinians papers, the certificate.",
        "Q: So he was \u2014 she was a \u2014 a Jew from Poland, or from \u2014",
        "A: No, she was a Jew from Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: She [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And she had had those \u2014 she had those certificates.",
        "A: Yes, all our barrack had the certificate. And some of them, like Nuta(ph)\nGudkowski(ph), the one with \u2014 with the girl, her husband also \u2014 they managed to\nrun away because the \u2014 the German in the beginning, they \u2014 they were after the\nmen. So some of the men managed to escape, and they \u2014 some of them escaped to\nPalestine. And that\u2019s how they send us the \u2014 the papers. So, I remember \u2014 at that\ntime I rem \u2014 I remember Tommy was teasing me all the time. He said, you don\u2019t\nhave pa \u2014 father, you don\u2019t have mother, I have a father in Palestine and wa \u2014 we\nwill see him, we go there. And I said, I don\u2019t care. And \u2014 and then we \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow how long we were in Hillersleben, but it was a beautiful place, a nice place.\nSomehow I had the feeling, I\u2019m not sure because I didn\u2019t \u2014 Hilde Huppert wrote a\nbook, \u201cHand in Hand with Tommy.\u201d And I don\u2019t remember that she mentioned it,\nbut th \u2014 it is in my memory that she wanted Tommy to learn English. And she \u2014 she\nhad someone and I was just sitting and listening to this. But again, I don\u2019t know\ncause I \u2014 it haven\u2019t been mentioned and I didn\u2019t ask her about it. But I \u2014 if I\nremember this, probably it was right. And then Hilde Huppert arranged \u2014 she met a\nJewish rabbi in the American Army. Her name was Neueman(ph). And she\narranged for a children transport to Palestine. Somehow they managed to \u2014 to find\nchildren who were from the age of six, seven, five and 20, they\u2019re all children, and\nthey took us there, it was a big transport, and th \u2014 we got to Paris. I remember \u2014",
        "Q: But Tony wasn\u2019t in there.",
        "A: Tommy was with us, I was with her, and with Tommy. I was very much next to\nher, and we all went to Paris, and I remember the Eiffel Tower. We wen \u2014 been\ntaken to Hotel Lutetia, which was a \u2014 still is the hotel in Paris. At that time it was a\n\u2014 the hotel that they brought refugees. And then I \u2014 no, I remember that we been\ntaken to a beautiful place, it was in the country. And we were there for three weeks,\nit was some kind of rehabilitation place, you know, cause the \u2014 it was a river there,\nor a lake, and we were there, and it was very, very nice. And then we got on the\nship, and we taken to Palestine. And we arrived in Palestine in the six, I think,\nsixth of July, 1945.",
        "Q: Did you play with other children on that ship?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember myself playing with anybody. I was with Tommy \u2014",
        "Q: Did you play with Tommy\u201d",
        "A: Sort of. Tommy was a \u2014 sort of. I di \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I remember not \u2014 not liking him\nbecause he was teasing me all the time. And \u2014 but I was very, very attached to\nHilde Huppert, felt very close to her, and she was very, very nice. Very nice lady.\nShe took care of me. But when we arrived in Palestine, we arrived into another\ncamp, which was [indecipherable] camp with \u2014 now there were other soldiers,\ndifferent uniform, but that was a camp, with the barbed wire, with the barracks. At\nthat time Hilde and Tommy, I remember stand \u2014 coming there, and I was with\nthem, and it was a tall man standing on the other side, and they went with him.\nTommy said, this is my father. And to \u2014 and we went with him.",
        "Q: Oh, so you went with them, too?",
        "A: The \u2014 no, they went \u2014 they went with him, and I left in the camp.",
        "Q: What a terrible feeling that must have been.",
        "A: Was very terrible. But I already knew that I am \u2014 I\u2019m on my own. Even when I\nwas with Hilde Huppert, and even when \u2014 when I was with the children. That \u2014\nmaybe that I don\u2019t remember them because I didn\u2019t really develop relationship with\nthem. I remember the first night in Atleet(ph). They gave us what we thought that\nthey are Israeli \u2014 Israeli clothes. Shorts and khaki shirts, and I remember lying in\nbed, and this was near Haifa, and seeing all the lights going by and was thinking\nthat it\u2019s an \u2014 it\u2019s another place, it\u2019s a new place. So that \u2014 that was \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nhow long I was in Atleet(ph). I \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll \u2014 time for a new \u2014 new tape, okay. We\u2019ll wait a little bit, and have a\nchange. [tape break] Okay, so why don\u2019t we continue talking. This is a\ncontinuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lily\nCohen, and you are telling me about Haifa, and your first night in the new camp.\nWho are the soldiers who are surrounding it? What \u2014 what were the uniforms they\nwere wearing?",
        "A: Oh, th \u2014 the shorts. The British soldiers, they have knee socks, knee-high socks.\nAnd di-different \u2014 different hats. They didn\u2019t look so frightening like the German.\nBut they were soldiers, it was a camp. It was a line to food, and \u2014 and it was a barb\nwire, So 1t was a camp.",
        "Q: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something in your \u2014 in the sequence of events, that it sounds like there\nwere people who were watching out for you, but it was all episodic.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: It was not some thread of \u2014 for example, a child alone in a camp like this, I\nwould think there has to be somebody who was responsible for the children who are\nalone in a camp like this, that the child then, you know, goes to.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s just hard to imagine that there you are, a little child in a camp, and there\nisn\u2019t anyone in charge of the children who \u2014 whom \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no. I know from Hilde Huppert\u2019s book that she said when she saw me\nsitting there alone, she said, ah this is \u2014 tha-that was Lily, the girl, she was on her\nown, and we knew that she was walking around, we just saw her always alone. So, I\ndon\u2019t think that anybody was in charge of me, except of the women who took care\nof me at the time. But they all disappeared, for many reasons. Probably some of\nthem died, or I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And is there a reason why Lily \u2014 why Huppert \u2014",
        "A: Bronk -- Bronka(ph).",
        "Q: No, no, no, no, the one with Tommy, what\u2019s her name again?",
        "A: Hilde.",
        "Q: Hilde. Why you didn\u2019t go with them? They were not \u2014",
        "A: Hilde Huppert was in that \u2014 in Bergen-Belsen, and \u2014 but she was in different\nbarrack. She didn\u2019t know me from Bergen-Belsen. She just met me \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 after the train and \u2014 and \u2014 you know. She didn\u2019t know me. She went \u2014 she saw\nme there, then she reme \u2014 she saw me that she said, this is the girl who was always",
        "Q: Alone.",
        "A: \u2014 on her own, alone.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But she didn't know me from before. I don\u2019t know how exactly this camp was,\nbut they \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that they will \u2014 they wer \u2014 it was big enough that they didn\u2019t\nknow each other.",
        "Q: No, I mean when you got to Palestine \u2014",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: \u2014 was there a reason why they didn\u2019t take you there, with the family? Did that\ncross your mind at the time, how come they\u2019re not taking me?",
        "A: No, no, because I \u2014 I didn\u2019t trust \u2014 although I was with her, and although I got\nreally attached to her at the time, but I knew already that there is no n \u2014 adult person\nthat I should trust, that I am on \u2014 I am on my own. So, that happened before, that\nhappened so many times during all these years in Bergen-Belsen, which people\ncame and go and \u2014 in my life. So, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think that I should \u2014 I should\nhave trust anybody. Wasn\u2019t any trust on my part. I knew that there \u2014 I \u2014 I have to\ntake care of myself.",
        "Q: Were you ever adopted?",
        "A: I was adopted, not officially, but I was adopted by the family in Palestine and\nIsrael. And again, when the [indecipherable] was in a kibbutz, Ma\u2019ale\nHamisha(ph) of Jerusalem, their mother, her name is Badana(ph) said to me, you\nknow, you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t call me mother. Don\u2019t you call me mother, you had a\nmother, and you should remember her. I don\u2019t know, it probably should be\nsomething very [indecipherable] educationally, but I do \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that it was\nthe right thing to do.",
        "Q: Yeah, I would agree, you know.",
        "A: So, but that was what \u2014 that was what \u2014 what she said, what happened, and I\nnever called her mother. I \u2014 I\u2019ve really fell in love with \u2014 she already had a \u2014a year\nand a half older son than me, and two weeks baby, two weeks old baby. And she\nwanted to adopt a kid from the Holocaust because \u2014 for the memory of her family,\nwhich been perished in the war. And I didn\u2019t feel that \u2014 that she is my mother. I \u2014 I\nwas in love with my father \u2014 with the father, but maybe they weren\u2019t my \u2014 my\nparents, but the children were my brothers.",
        "Q: Were they?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, they are my brothers, to this ver-very day.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019ve skipped a bit in asking you about that. Let\u2019s try and get the chronology\nin the ne \u2014 back. When we\u2019re back in Haifa and you\u2019re in this camp, what happens\nto you after that?",
        "A: What happened was that I was there alone, and there was a woman who works\nfor Aliyah Tenora(ph), which was the youth \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: A youth organization?",
        "A: The youth organization, Aliyah Tenora(ph). And she came, and she said, I\u2019m\ntaking you to a family wants to be your family. And she took me. She lived in a\nkibbutz next to a kibbutz they lived, and she took me there. And I remember the\nroad to the \u2014 to \u2014 all the road to Jerusalem. And it was funny because not long\nafter, it was the \u201948 war that was there. And th-the \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t the same road.\nAnd I was always thinking, was it my memory that \u2014 that I saw this hills, and this\nmountains? Which from the side, and I never see them again. But when, after the\n\u00b067 war, when they opened this road again, there it was, exactly wa \u2014",
        "Q: As your memory.",
        "A: \u2014as my memory.",
        "Q: So, it also sounds like another thread 1s that your memory has not tricked you.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: In the things that you have remembered \u2014",
        "A: There were \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you\u2019ve been able to find ways to confirm those memories.",
        "A: Yes, yes, very much so.",
        "Q: Have there been any memories that you were \u2014 had the opposite results, where\nyou thought you remembered \u2014",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: \u2014 everything that I remember, and I checked \u2014 I checked up about the holo \u2014 the\n\u2014 the hospital in Bergen-Belsen, and I learned that it was a hospital. Because in the\nbeginning they said to me there wasn\u2019t any hospital, and I remember that my\nmother was in the hospital. And I remember \u2014 I remember the camp. I don\u2019t\nremember \u2014 I remember \u2014 I remember the \u2014 the light inside the barrack. I remember\nthe \u2014 the blankets.",
        "Q: Tell us, what kind of significance do these memories have for you? What kind \u2014",
        "A: Fear.",
        "Q: Fear\u2019?",
        "A: Cold.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s what you remember from them, yeah.",
        "A: I remember and I \u2014 I \u2014I think that I\u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m very, very sensitive to cold, to this\nvery day. And I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s come from there. I remember this wet, cold floor.\nAnd \u2014 and I remember \u2014 yeah, I remember a lot of fear.",
        "Q: It sounds though, that your memories are \u2014 how shall I put it? Because I don\u2019t\nwant to be suggestive if this is not true, that in some ways that your memories are\nboth something you could trust \u2014 of all the things that you couldn\u2019t trust, the\nmemories that you had, you found out you could. And that they were the avenue to\nwho you are. Is that so, or \u2014",
        "A: Probably, probably yeah. Yes, yes. Because when I got into the kibbutz, and I \u2014 I\nremember the first day. They put me with the other children and we all had supper.\nAnd they all looked so different. And I didn\u2019t speak the language. And I remember\nthat somehow a \u2014 and though I was so different, I don\u2019t remember that \u2014 it was\nsomething in that \u2014 in my present that children didn\u2019t laugh at me. And the first\nnight \u2014 night, and then few nights later, they used to \u2014 to give me this treatment for\nthe lice. And that was with this kerosene oil, you know, they \u2014 they used to wash\nyour head, and then \u2014",
        "Q: Wrap it.",
        "A: \u2014 wrap it up, and the horrible smell. And with the \u2014 with the other chil \u2014 other\nthree girls in the same room, and it was really very humiliating, night after night\nafter night. And somehow, I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know what did I do, or\nhow I fel \u2014 I was presented myself. But it wasn\u2019t a laugh, it wasn\u2019t a mockery. And\nI always \u2014 I wanted very much to be like them, of course. I wanted to be \u2014 I wanted\nto have dark hair, I wanted to have freckles. I wanted to \u2014 to speak that \u2014 like them.\nBut after a very short while I understand \u2014 I understood that I won\u2019t be like them,\never. I had this straight, blonde hair, and a \u2014 a white face, and a \u2014 and I remember\nmyself making decision. I remember like always lying in the bed thinking to\nmyself, all right, so if I\u2019m not \u20141f I am different, I will be different. I will be\ndifferent, it\u2019s okay. And I was different. And I \u2014 I\u2014I held myself differently. I\ndidn\u2019t let them \u2014 because I saw how there were other children who came, they were\n\u2014 they always came with the uncles and aunties and fa \u2014 parents to the kibbutz from\nthe Holocaust. And they \u2014 they \u2014 I saw how they related to them, and I s \u2014 I know\nthat th-they didn\u2019t relate to me like that, cause I was a \u2014 like my \u2014 when my brother\nsaid, you are the queen. So that was \u2014 I \u2014 I had \u2014 I\u2014 I make decision. I remember\nmyself making decision. Never \u2014 never f \u2014 be sort of, the girl from there \u2014 from the\nHolocaust. So, I think th-that in a way, my \u2014 my \u2014 my childhood, which was so\ndeprived, was an engine to me growing up in different way.",
        "Q: Yeah. In the \u2014 was it in the kibbutz that you had this unofficial adopted family?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They were there, and then e \u2014 1t were my two brothers. And then when I was 10,\nmy young brother was born, and they were very much my family, very much.",
        "Q: The father that you adored so much, did \u2014 wer \u2014 did he adore you back?",
        "A: Oh yes. I was the only g-girl, he had three boys. Oh yes, he adored me. And my\nmother, she was very, sort of, educational person. She was a teacher and a \u2014 always\nasked psychologists what to do, and she always used to say, Shlamic(ph), you\ndestroying the kid. You spoiling the kid. Cause he used to bring me tea to bed when\nI came out \u2014 I went on holiday. Shlamic(ph) \u2014 and he was a \u2014 he was a wonderful\nman. He was self \u2014",
        "Q: Did he feel t \u2014 did he feel like a father?",
        "A: He feeled like a father. I don\u2019t know what a father \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 should be, but he loved me very much, and yeah.",
        "Q: So, did you trust him?",
        "A: Ver \u2014 yeah, I think I trusted him.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t trust her.",
        "A: I-I\u2014I don\u2019t think so. I learned I \u2014 there were very her \u2014 very tough times for\nboth of us during the years. I think only when she got really old, and now we are in\na wonderful relationship. But, on her 80\" birthday \u2014 90\" birthday, I \u2014 I talked, and I\nsaid that, in spite everything, she was the only mother I know \u2014 I knew. So, she was\nmy mother and she is my mother. I don\u2019t call her my mother. I don\u2019t call her my\nmother, but she ki \u2014 she 1s.",
        "Q: Do you think she \u2014 do you think she said this in a clumsy way, 1-in that she\nwanted to be your mother, but she also wanted to honor the one that you had lost?",
        "A: I think that she want \u2014 wanted me to honored my mother, my parents.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: She wanted me to remember them and honor them, that\u2019s what I think. It wasn\u2019t\nclumsy. She doesn\u2019t do anything clumsy.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. By \u2014 by that I meant that, in a way, her saying it that way almost was,\nI\u2019m not going to be a mother to you, I don\u2019t want to do that. And every child needs\na mother. So, it \u2014 it could be that \u2014 that \u2014 I guess what I\u2019m asking 1s, despite such a\nstatement and it \u2014 what it sounds like, a complex ties, did you feel that she wanted\nto be your mother, even with not the name?",
        "A: I\u2014I think that \u2014 I think that she wanted to be. I don\u2019t know if she wanted to be\nmy mother. I think that she \u2014 she is a very moral person. She \u2014 she\u2019s a very\nbeautiful person, and I think that she wanted to pay respect to \u2014 to the family that\nperished. And I think that \u2014 that I was \u2014 I think that \u2014 that she \u2014 I think that she\nwanted to \u2014 I was symbolizing for her something much bigger than me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: S-So \u2014 and she also wanted me to remember that I had a family. She didn\u2019t want\nme to forget it. And that\u2019s was her main \u2014 main reason \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s so diff \u2014 you know, that\u2019s so very different than many adoptive parents.\nMany people who adopt children don\u2019t want their ado \u2014 their \u2014 their children to\nremember the former family. They want them to become more integrated, and \u2014",
        "A: So on the a \u2014 one \u2014 one side, she wanted me, because that \u2014 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t\nspeak Polish this day. They never spoke Polish to me. And she said in the beginning\nI [indecipherable] Polish \u2014 I spoke Polish, but very di \u2014 very quickly, I really\nforgot it. On the other hand, I think that she, because she has such a family duty,\nand her family is a very, very [indecipherable] very famous family in Israel. And\nso \u2014 so the f\u2014 upper class of the Jewish families, her family 1s, is I think that\ntogether with this, she respected family. She didn\u2019t want me to forget that I had\nmother and father. I can understand it, I just don\u2019t know if I could accept it at the\ntime, but I can understand it.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. In what way are your brother your real brothers?",
        "A: Oh, they are my brothers. They were always my brothers. Also, my mother, my\nadopted mother Anna, her husband, they were very \u2014 my mother is \u2014 was a very\nidealistic person. She worked for the others, she always had duties. She never was\nat home. Even for her own children, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t any difference. And\nhe was the head of \u2014 the kibbutz had a \u2014 a guest house, so he was the head of the\nguest house. And on my 70\", we \u2014 we celebrated my 70\" birthday, what we thought\nit we \u2014 it is, just last October, and \u2014 and [indecipherable] December. And my\nbrother got up and he said, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t have parents, we only had each other.\nSaid in front of her, in front of all the guests. It was a surprise fa \u2014 party. We only\nhad each other, and I had the eldest sister. So yes, we were brothers. One of them\nwas killed when he was 18 and a half.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: He was in the army, was in this commando unit, and got killed. And so we \u2014 we\nleft, the two of them and me. And we are very, very much \u2014 very much attached to\neach other. So, it was a family. Their family, they have a very big fa-family. My\nmother \u2014 my adopted mother had a very \u2014 has a very big family. So there wa \u2014 I\nbeen accepted as a family, completely. And they \u2014 and so much so that they used to\nsay that I look like my father. They were [indecipherable] oh, it show.\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: And why is it you think that they didn\u2019t want you to speak Polish? Do \u2014 were\ntheir \u2014 were their family roots from Poland \u2014",
        "A: They didn\u2019t want me to \u2014 they didn\u2019t want me to speak Polish.",
        "Q: I know. Why? Why, do you think?",
        "A: Because they \u2014 they thought at that time that it\u2019s better to forget. I think that it\nwas their idea of, for all the children that, you know, sort of start new life, and just\nerase what happened there.",
        "Q: Were they also from Poland, or had they been in Palestine \u2014",
        "A: They are in Poland, yeah, the ma \u2014 the kibbutz \u2014 the kibbutz mot \u2014 founders are\nall Polish. And few of them came \u2014 my adopted mother, her name is Badana(ph),\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 her family had the school and kindergar \u2014 garten in Hebrew, in Lodz.\nSo, their first language is Hebrew. And the \u2014 some of the people in the kibbutz, they\nwere in the kindergarten and in the school. This is the Katznelson(ph) family which\nthe Katznelson [indecipherable] family which was [indecipherable] very, sort of\nknown family. So, they didn\u2019t want, because that was their idea in that time. And\nthere were very, very sad stories because of that. Nobody ask questions, nobody\ntalked. We didn\u2019t talk. Of course, I didn\u2019t talk, because I want \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to be\nlike the rest, wanted just stories that I\u2019m telling. And \u2014 and also, I was \u2014 lam \u2014 I -\nwell, I remember very early in my life that I was thinking that I probably did\nsomething horrible, if that\u2019s what happened to me. So, if I don\u2019t have mother and\nfather, and no \u2014 so, that was a thought that walked with me quite a long \u2014 many\nyears in my childhood. Then, there were \u2014 people used to come to look for their\nrelatives, the first years. And each time when they came, I was already \u2014 already\nwas thinking that maybe one day, you know, the door will open and my mother will\ncome in, or my father. And for years and years I used to daydream and night dream\n\u2014no, night dream I was dreaming about horrible things and I was a \u2014 afraid of\ngetting out of the \u2014 of the bed. Was quite awful, the night dreams. But during the\nday I used to daydream that they \u2014 they will come back. They will come for me. So\nall \u2014 each time when somebody came, you know, it was a new hope. But then\nBadana(ph) said, that\u2019s it, stop. I don\u2019t want it any more. And then, when my \u2014\nwhen we heard from my uncle, I think that 1t was after the \u2014 no, 1t was before the\nwar, before the \u201948 war. He discovered me through Aliyah Tenora(ph), through the\nyouth organization. And he started to write letters, and s \u2014 and send me all kind of\nbeautiful clothes, because at that time we all had \u2014 all the children had clothes from\npeople from America, from [indecipherable]. Only me, I didn't have \u2014 also, I\nwouldn\u2019t have because my adopted mother was a very idealistic person and she\nwouldn\u2019t accept it, you know, that \u2014 but he did send me things, beautiful things.\nAnd also, Hilde Huppert used to come to visit me, and Nuta(ph) Gudkowski(ph),\nthis lady with the child. She \u2014 they both used to come to visit me. And Hilde used\nto bring me all things that she was knitted, cause she was a very good knitter. And I\nhave a picture of myself with the knitting sweater that she have. And so, in this\nsense, I \u2014 I felt okay with the other children. And then was the \u201948 war, was another\nwar. So from war to war, and the \u2014 again, I think that I was on my own. I was \u2014 I wa\n\u2014 not on my own at that time, because \u2014 but then a \u2014 was the kindergarten teacher,\nso she was with the other children. That what my brother meant when we were\nalone, with [indecipherable] parents. And I remember sitting on this truck with my\nsix months old brother on my lap, when all the other mothers were sitting with their\nbabies, with their children, and I was sitting with him. So, I was on my own.",
        "Q: When did your story \u2014 when did you start becoming interested 1n the story of\nyour early years and your family? How did you start piecing it together? Clearly\nwhen your uncle wrote, that was a big thing.",
        "A: I didn't relate to it. |\u2014 I \u2014 I think that at that time, and many years later, I really\nwanted to detach myself from a \u2014 the whole thing. And so I knew that I couldn\u2019t\ndeny to myself that I was there, I didn\u2019t want to be part of it. I read books, I saw\nfilms, but always sort of dissociation of that, you know, not being part of it, and I\ndidn't want to talk about it. I never talked. I didn\u2019t talk to my children.",
        "Q: When did you start talking about it?",
        "A: I start talking about it when my granddaughters were at school. I have twin\ngranddaughters, my son children. And they did this work, you know, what they call\nroot work, family. And I wrote to them. I wou \u2014 I decided that I \u2014 I will write to\nthem. And I wrote to them, and telling them sort of in a children language, that I\nwas bor \u2014 born in Poland, and I was in a camp. That was the first time that I really",
        "Q: How old were you, approximately?",
        "A: Approximately. Approximately tho \u2014 that was about 11 years ago, I think.",

        "Q: Very, very recent.",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay. Well, that\u2019s not unusual. Many people don\u2019t want to say things, don\u2019t \u2014\naren\u2019t ready until their children ask, or their grandchildren ask. And only then do\nthey feel that it\u2019s something that they\u2019d like to share, you know.",
        "A: Yes, but with my children, to this very day, I don\u2019t talk. I don\u2019t think that they\nwant to hear. I think that my s \u2014 my son has a big problem with it. I think that my\nson doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "Q: Do you want to change the tape now? Okay, let\u2019s do that. As we\u2019re changing the\ntape, I can ask you this; why do you think he does?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I think that \u2014 that somehow I missed the train. You know, maybe I\n\u2014 I had to talk about it \u2014 I had very special relationship with my son. I ga \u2014 gave\nbirth to him when I was 18 and a half, and I probably grow \u2014 grew up with him.\nAnd I never wanted to [indecipherable] It\u2019s okay?",
        "Q: I got it.",
        "A: I never felt \u2014 I never felt the right moment. What am I going to tell him, how? It\n\u2014 no, it \u2014 it didn't come. And he knew, but it was like he didn't know. I think that a\nfew years la \u2014 a-ago, he said one day, he said, what your father di-did for a living? I\nsaid, I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I found out that he was a soldier, but no \u2014 no more than that.\nI didn\u2019t want to \u2014 even now, when \u2014 he said, cause I went \u2014 we went to see\n[indecipherable] and then here, I said, well, have some fun, it\u2019s \u2014 not everything 1s\nthe Holocaust, you know? Immediately, he was sort of \u2014",
        "Q: So, it \u2014 it \u2014 do you think that he thinks that you are so \u2014 that that\u2019s all that goes\non in your mind, and that that\u2019s what rules you, in some ways?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I think that \u2014 that he \u2014 he \u2014 he wasn't part of me getting with\nthe d\u2014 with the granddaughters. And one day I took the \u2014 my granddaughters to\nvisit Hilde Huppert. I took him \u2014 I took \u2014 they came with their mother, not with\nhim. He never met any of the people that were connected to me.",
        "Q: That\u2019s so unusual. It sounds so unusual.",
        "A: Yeah, I thi \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t think \u2014 he has a big problem about it. I think it is a\nsecond \u2014 it\u2019s like me, I wa \u2014 I am first and second generation because of the age,\nand he is a \u2014 quite a typical second generation 1n this sense.",
        "Q: You\u2019re ready? Okay, we can go. This is a continuation of the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lily Cohen. I\u2019m trying to get a \u2014\nwhen you became active to try and find out bits and pieces of your story, was it\nafter you talked to y-your twins \u2014 grandchildren wanted it, and then you yourself\nbecame proactive?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Not much before.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I think that I \u2014 I think the first time that I really suddenly was talking openly, it\nwas to my friend Linda in \u2014 in Manhattan, it was this horrible restaurant,\ndowntown man \u2014 Manhattan. And I think that I was talking to her because she was\na stranger, she wasn\u2019t anybody who was connected to me. Cause I really didn\u2019t talk\nabout it with people. Somehow I \u2014I grew up and I was thinking to myself, okay, I\ncan do \u2014 do thi \u2014 good things, I \u2014 I think that \u2014 the thing that I was very concerned\nabout, only life that I have to be the best, th-the \u2014 the biggest, the \u2014 you know? I\nhave to prove myself all the time.",

        "Q: Okay. Well, what was your \u2014 how did you do it? What \u2014 in what ways did it\nshow itself?",
        "A: It was some kind of, you know, competition with myself, you know? Oh, and I\nwas that \u2014 I\u2014 I went to the music and dance academy, and I was looking at the girls\nwho were dancing, and I said, if she can do it, I can do it.",
        "Q: And you did.",
        "A: Yeah. That \u2014 but I \u2014 I do think that it was one of the things that I, since very\nearly childhood I had to prove myself all the time. This \u2014 that was my feeling. I\nhave to prove myself.",

        "Q: Yeah. Well, had things not turned out the way they did, you wouldn\u2019t have been\ndeprived. You would have been in a very comfortable family, had there been no\nwar, had there been no Holocaust \u2014",
        "A: Yes",

        "A: Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.",

I\ndidn\u2019t go with them. I didn\u2019t. And the feeling, all these years my feeling was, if I go\nto Warsaw, what am I going to look for? I don\u2019t have any thread of information\nwhere to look, or what to look for. I can \u2014 I don\u2019t have a address, I don\u2019t have\nnames, I don\u2019t have any \u2014 anything.

And they brought some\ndance teachers to the kibbutz, but that wasn\u2019t enough. So, Badana(ph) said, all\nright, I will fight for you. I will get you this. Yet, you have to carry on with the\npiano, because a dancer 1s not only with her legs and feet, she has to know. I said\nokay. So I was the only kid who used to go to Jerusalem at the age of 10 and\nstudied in the conservat \u2014 conservatoire at that time. And I studied dance.

        "A: In political \u2014 political science [indecipherable]. And he\u2019s the dean of NYU in\nIsrael. Proud mother, Jewish mother.",
        "Q: And why not?",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: Why not, yeah.",
        "A: And there \u2014 there \u2014 one thing he did, he went \u2014 what was happening 1s that th-\nthey sending students for three months into different countries. The - NYU has\nbranches. So they \u2014 the first lot of student came, and some of the things they studied\nwas about the Holocaust, or Nazi Germany [indecipherable]. And she came to me\nand ask me 1f I would like to talk to them, to those students.",
        "Q: Your son did?",
        "A: Which was \u2014 yeah, which was really unusual for him. And I did. I said yes. And\nwhen I came and they stood in front of this very, very young guy, used to \u2014 Israeli\nstudents are always 22 - 23, because they go to the army, and here they were 18\nyears old children. I was looking at them and I was thinking, where do I begin to\ntell the story of my life? And I decided not to talk about the war, and not to \u2014 I se \u2014\nI \u2014 I was thinking that they can read about it, they can learn about it. What I chose\nto talk about was how do you live with this story, and how you grow up, and how y\n\u2014 how you make your life and how you became a how \u2014 mother.",
        "Q: In what ways do you think it strengthened you, in what ways do you think it sup\n\u2014 took something away that you couldn\u2019t replace?",
        "A: I-I think that what strengthened me was the idea that I overcomed, I \u2014 I won\nsomething, and I wa \u2014 survived. I think that surviving is the be \u2014 the biggest thing in\nme. I\u2019m a\u2014 I\u2019m a survivor. And whatever happened, I knew that I can stand on my\nown feet, even now, these days. So, I\u2014 I\u2014 I have this strong feeling about it. I think\nthat what been taken away from me is my past. I have this feeling that I don\u2019t have\na past. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: But you \u2014 but you don\u2019t know itt.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Not that long ago, I wanted \u2014 the \u2014 there are many people in Israel are a-\napplying for passports [indecipherable] in different countries because they want to\nbe part of the common market. And \u2014 and my granddaughters asked me to apply for\na Polish passport because th-they might want to learn in \u2014 abroad. So I called this\nwoman, I gave her \u2014 I got number. I got 1t \u2014 call this woman, she\u2019s th \u2014 an Israeli\nspeak \u2014 Hebrew speaking. She works for the Polish embassy. I called her and I told\nher my name, I told her that I was born in Warsaw, and they \u2014 she said, date of\nbirth? I said, I don\u2019t know. So she said, wait a minute. She went, she looked for\nsomething, then she came back to the phone, she said, you are not exist. So\nimmediately I said, for the German I was very exist. So, this is \u2014 this is the thing; I\ndon\u2019t exist. That\u2019s why I do \u2014I didn\u2019t want to go to Poland, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t \u2014\nmaybe now, I don\u2019t know. I have a friend in \u2014 in England. She\u2019s Polish, she\u2019s not\nJewish. Polish th \u2014 couple, they are making films. And she said to me, you know\nwhat? I\u2019Il go with you to Poland, to Warsaw. They really rebuilt old Warsaw.",
        "Q: It\u2019s true.",
        "A: So she said, we will go with the life, not with the death. We will go to the \u2014 to\nthe cafe they will \u2014 they might sit on the way to the theater, to the \u2014 to that\nrestaurant, to that restaurant that you \u2014 they used to dance there. You know, this\nwhere we should go, on [indecipherable] to the theater. And I will go with you.",
        "Q: And does that thought intrigue you?",
        "A: I \u2014 this \u2014 this I could accept, you know. I couldn\u2019t accept that I would go to\nsomething which is not exist any more. And then \u2014 but I do have this feeling that\nit\u2019s been taken away from me, very much so. Maybe this 1s the reason that I didn\u2019t\nwant to talk to my children, because I \u2014 what could I tell them?",
        "Q: My gosh.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have grandmothers that they could relate to, grandfathers. They\ndidn\u2019t have \u2014 they didn\u2019t have any family they could relate to. The only thing that I\nknew there, I knew the names, and by then I have pictures.",
        "Q: Are these your only pictures?",
        "A: No, I have some more. Some more pictures.",
        "Q: But probably not a lot.",
        "A: No. I have a \u2014 pictures from my \u2014 of my uncle in Paris, and I have the pink \u2014\npicture of him standing on the s-stage with his clarinet. And that was five minute\nbefore he died.",
        "Q: Did he have a heart attack or something?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And there was one thread lost, yeah.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But th-the main reason we escaped, I know \u2014 this I know from him, that that one\nof the things that my mother told me, that he had to be in the Judenrite(ph).",
        "Q: Mm-hm, Judenrat.",
        "A: Judenrat in the ge \u2014 ghetto.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And he didn\u2019t want to.",
        "A: So he managed to escape, and I\u2019m sure that he had many friends.",
        "Q: Who could help him do th \u2014 did you ever see the movie, \u201cThe Pianist?\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: Did you think of him as you were seeing that?",
        "A: I was feeling \u2014 not only about him, I was think that the first scene there is\nWarsaw from above.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And when I saw this, I said, this is the Warsaw that I was born to. That was the\nclick.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That was the Warsaw I was born \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019ve been thinking about that as you\u2019ve been speaking, you know, that there\u2019s\nsomething in there that really connects.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That was the place. The other time \u2014 and I was thinking about him, because he\nwrote some very well known music [indecipherable]. Where is my shtetl of bells,\nyou know?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know the music, but \u2014 but that\u2019s very interesting.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we found him on the internet. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So these fragments, these bits and pieces. Lily, 1s there something I haven\u2019t\nasked you about that you think 1s important to include in this part of the story?",
        "A: I \u2014 the reason that I r-really wanted to come here and to do it \u2014 it, because I\nreally wanted that my family would be somewhere. Because [indecipherable] I\u2019m\nnot [indecipherable]. So I wanted there to be some \u2014",

        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "Q: Did you go with her?",

        "Q: It\u2019s so unusual \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 to think that there\u2019s a little girl in the men\u2019s barracks.",
        "Q: Well, in what way \u2014 first, let\u2019s go back to some of those memories of \u2014 of this\nman and \u2014 and in what way was he terrifying? Do you have any \u2014",
        "Q: You remember being hit?",
        "Q: Now, was he in the same bunk as you were, or was he in the next one\nunderneath?",

        "Q: \u2014 Bergen-Belsen. Now what \u2014 how was it \u2014 were you hidden from the German\nauthorities, do you think? Did they know about your existence?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "Q: Yeah. And it \u2014 one is coming out and another one is going in. I\u2019m keeping the\naudio running so that nothing is interrupted at all. Okay, and let me say, this is a\ncontinuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lily\nCohen. And you were at the point where you were going to tell us about\nBronka(ph) and having her told you many years later, that you saved her life.",
        "Q: And there was something you gave her, so tell us about that.",
        "Q: Of the Virgin Mary and the baby. And that\u2019s what you had given her.",
        "Q: And do you remember it, or you don\u2019t have a memory of it?",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t remember the little statue, and where you would have gotten it?",
        "Q: What do you \u2014 what \u2014 do you ha \u2014 do you ha \u2014 you said you had other\nmemories, many other memories?",
        "Q: Were there other children in the women\u2019s barracks?",
        "Q: Were they about your age, or were they older?",
        "Q: How odd.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s \u2014 I find 1t amazing that you \u2014 we don\u2019t have dates for it, but it sounds as\nif your beginning of darkness happens fairly soon after the war breaks out. That \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you know. So, in some ways it\u2019s a miracle that \u2014 in many ways it\u2019s a miracle\nthat you survived the entire war incarcerated, whereas most children would not have\nsurvived. They would have been found, discovered, gotten rid of. Because, how\nmuch could they work, you know, and what was their value?",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know whose it was.",
        "Q: By the time 1945 rolls around, it looks as if, from the documents you have, that\nit \u2014 you\u2019re at least seven years old, something like that. And a seven year old\nalready can have certain memories \u2014",
        "Q: Images.",
        "Q: Oh, a child, a child. So it\u2019s \u2014 but you don\u2019t remember telling this story, she is\nsomebody who tells you about that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, obviously then, you weren't hidden. If German office \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 if German officers were picking you up \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember anything of how you spent the days? Do you think you played\nat all?",
        "Q: I had a thought as you were talking earlier, did you feel completely alone?",
        "Q: That\u2019s what my other question was going to be.",
        "Q: What was your secret?",
        "Q: You mentioned having an adopted mother \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 later on, but let\u2019s go back in our \u2014 to the chronology of when you\u2019re leaving\nBergen-Belsen \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and you\u2019re on the train.",
        "Q: Was it open train?",
        "Q: It was an open \u2014 no roof on it?",
        "Q: Who was doing the shooting, do you know?",
        "Q: Magdeburg, yeah.",
        "Q: So they liberated you from under a train.",
        "Q: And you\u2019ve seen those?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But when you see the pictures, have you recognized some memory?",
        "Q: This is Buchenwald, or \u2014",
        "Q: Buchenwald, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So, it was a town, or it was \u2014",
        "Q: Town, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So you saw your first flowers.",
        "Q: Who was she? Who was this lady?",
        "Q: So he was \u2014 she was a \u2014 a Jew from Poland, or from \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: And she had had those \u2014 she had those certificates.",
        "Q: But Tony wasn\u2019t in there.",
        "Q: Did you play with other children on that ship?",
        "Q: Did you play with Tommy\u201d",
        "Q: Oh, so you went with them, too?",
        "Q: What a terrible feeling that must have been.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll \u2014 time for a new \u2014 new tape, okay. We\u2019ll wait a little bit, and have a\nchange. [tape break] Okay, so why don\u2019t we continue talking. This is a\ncontinuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lily\nCohen, and you are telling me about Haifa, and your first night in the new camp.\nWho are the soldiers who are surrounding it? What \u2014 what were the uniforms they\nwere wearing?",
        "Q: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something in your \u2014 in the sequence of events, that it sounds like there\nwere people who were watching out for you, but it was all episodic.",
        "Q: It was not some thread of \u2014 for example, a child alone in a camp like this, I\nwould think there has to be somebody who was responsible for the children who are\nalone in a camp like this, that the child then, you know, goes to.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s just hard to imagine that there you are, a little child in a camp, and there\nisn\u2019t anyone in charge of the children who \u2014 whom \u2014",
        "Q: And is there a reason why Lily \u2014 why Huppert \u2014",
        "Q: No, no, no, no, the one with Tommy, what\u2019s her name again?",
        "Q: Hilde. Why you didn\u2019t go with them? They were not \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Alone.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: No, I mean when you got to Palestine \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 was there a reason why they didn\u2019t take you there, with the family? Did that\ncross your mind at the time, how come they\u2019re not taking me?",
        "Q: Were you ever adopted?",
        "Q: Yeah, I would agree, you know.",
        "Q: Were they?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019ve skipped a bit in asking you about that. Let\u2019s try and get the chronology\nin the ne \u2014 back. When we\u2019re back in Haifa and you\u2019re in this camp, what happens\nto you after that?",
        "Q: A youth organization?",
        "Q: As your memory.",
        "Q: So, it also sounds like another thread 1s that your memory has not tricked you.",
        "Q: In the things that you have remembered \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you\u2019ve been able to find ways to confirm those memories.",
        "Q: Have there been any memories that you were \u2014 had the opposite results, where\nyou thought you remembered \u2014",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: Tell us, what kind of significance do these memories have for you? What kind \u2014",
        "Q: Fear\u2019?",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s what you remember from them, yeah.",
        "Q: It sounds though, that your memories are \u2014 how shall I put it? Because I don\u2019t\nwant to be suggestive if this is not true, that in some ways that your memories are\nboth something you could trust \u2014 of all the things that you couldn\u2019t trust, the\nmemories that you had, you found out you could. And that they were the avenue to\nwho you are. Is that so, or \u2014",
        "Q: Wrap it.",
        "Q: Yeah. In the \u2014 was it in the kibbutz that you had this unofficial adopted family?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: The father that you adored so much, did \u2014 wer \u2014 did he adore you back?",
        "Q: Did he feel t \u2014 did he feel like a father?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So, did you trust him?",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t trust her.",
        "Q: Do you think she \u2014 do you think she said this in a clumsy way, 1-in that she\nwanted to be your mother, but she also wanted to honor the one that you had lost?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. By \u2014 by that I meant that, in a way, her saying it that way almost was,\nI\u2019m not going to be a mother to you, I don\u2019t want to do that. And every child needs\na mother. So, it \u2014 it could be that \u2014 that \u2014 I guess what I\u2019m asking 1s, despite such a\nstatement and it \u2014 what it sounds like, a complex ties, did you feel that she wanted\nto be your mother, even with not the name?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s so diff \u2014 you know, that\u2019s so very different than many adoptive parents.\nMany people who adopt children don\u2019t want their ado \u2014 their \u2014 their children to\nremember the former family. They want them to become more integrated, and \u2014",

        "Q: Very, very recent.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, that\u2019s not unusual. Many people don\u2019t want to say things, don\u2019t \u2014\naren\u2019t ready until their children ask, or their grandchildren ask. And only then do\nthey feel that it\u2019s something that they\u2019d like to share, you know.",

        "A: My name 1s Lily Kaszamerski(ph) or Kaszamerska(ph), and I was born in\nWarsaw, Poland \u2014 Poland. And my parents\u2019 names were Ada Berlind(ph)\nOberlanski(ph). My father\u2019s name was Ian Kaszamerski(ph). I know that they\nboth were born 1n po \u2014 in Warsaw, I\u2019m not sure, because I don\u2019t remember them.\nAnd I also know that they \u2014 my mother had a brother \u2014 her brother, and he survived\nthe war. He managed to escape the war in the middle of the war, and find himself in\nParis. And after the war he opened a nightclub. He was a musician.",
        "A: Zigmund Berlind(ph).",
        "A: No. I met his wife many, many years later. I didn\u2019t meet him, he died in 1953.\nAnd I think that he found me around 1950 th \u2014 or, well, \u201949.",
        "A: After the independent war in Israel, I think that that\u2019s when he found me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t \u2014 but I think that it wasn\u2019t enough time, just \u2014 but he wrote to me\nthrough my adopted mother, cause they corresponded in Polish, and I didn't know\nPolish at the time, already. I forgot it. And the sad story about it, about the fact that\nI didn\u2019t meet them, n-neither his or \u2014 him or his wife at that time, I \u2014 and th-the\nother sad thing is that I don\u2019t have any track of that letters that gone between my\nadopted mother and himself. So, I don\u2019t know anything. And I think that \u2014 that my\nadopted mother didn\u2019t ask the right questions, because if she would, maybe I would\nknow where I come from, street, who were my parents, what did they do. I don\u2019t\nknow anything.",
        "A: Yeah, but what I want, th \u2014 all the things that \u2014 all \u2014 the only thing that I always\nheard from my aunt was that my mother was the most ele-elegant person in\nWarsaw, but that didn't give me anything.",

And I also know that never been given to a Jew. So, he was the\nonly Jew who got this award. And I have it, I\u2014 I go \u2014 we got it through the internet\nfrom the Polish army museum.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was Polish.",
        "A: But when I arrived to Israel, to Palestine at the time, it was a mixture of\nGerman and Polish and I don\u2019t know what.",
        "A: The only one memory I have is that \u2014 I think we were very, very young age, that\nI am in a pram, in a baby carriage, with my father, in a \u20141n a park. And it was\nsnowing, wintertime, and I remember what \u2014 wearing this snowsuit, white snowsuit,\nwith a \u2014 with thing for \u2014 they call it mufa in Polish, for the hand, from\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, muff. And I was all in white, and I remember myself \u2014 I think that \u2014\nI\u2014 [I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s real, but that\u2019s what I remember, lying in a \u2014 1n baby\npram with my father in the park. This is the early \u2014",
        "A: I just think \u2014 I don\u2019t know if \u2014 because I saw his pictures, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s\nmy memory, or what ha \u2014 from what I saw. But I \u2014 I remember somebody very tall,\nvery tall and very beautiful.",
        "A: My mother I remember a little bit later, I think. My mother had dark hair. Both\nof them had black hair, I don\u2019t know how I got my blonde hair. And \u2014 and actually,\nthe first mo \u2014 memory of her is for \u2014 what I thought that it was the beginning of \u2014\nbeginning of the war. It was a \u2014 a day that I remember being in a house, and\neverything, all the doors were open, and 1-1t was plenty of movement on the street,\nand they\u2019re shouting and shooting, and people running. And the \u2014 I remember\nhearing this gunshot, this boom, boom. And the \u2014 I saw my dog, I had the Lassie\ndog, on the floor with a hole in his head and something red was coming out and I\nremember myself \u2014 I remember me crawling to the dog. And then it was noise and\nthe door bin \u2014 opened and the big soldier, he was a Ukraine \u2014",
        "A:\u2014came in \u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how \u2014 how I know. But I know I \u2014- \u2019m\u2014\nI don\u2019t know how I know that he was Ukraine. He was a big man. He lift me up into\nhis arms. He had red cheeks, and a horrible smell of alcohol from his mouth, and\nmy mother was screaming, and he was laughing and holding me in his arms, and\nlaughing. That\u2019s what I remember from them. Then the next thing I remember is\nbeing in a \u2014 quite a dark apartment. My mother was walking backward and forward\nin the room doing this, you know? And then I remember that 1t was a cupboard\nthere, and my mother used to go into the cupboard. And \u2014",
        "A: No. I ler \u2014I didn\u2019t look Polish \u2014 I didn\u2019t look Jewish, I think. I didn't go with\nher. She was always very ha \u2014 going into this cupboard, and then one day she\ndisappeared.",
        "A: Yes, at that time, and I th \u2014 I \u2014 somehow, I was making connection between my\nmother\u2019s walking so the f\u2014 backward and forward in the room, and the \u2014 doing this\nwith the \u2014 the \u2014 the disappearing of my father. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right or wrong,\nbut \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s what my impression was. And then she disappeared, and I was there in\nthis house. I don\u2019t remember the people there. I just \u2014 somehow, again, I just know.\nAnd this is very strange thing, that I know things. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been told,\ncause I didn\u2019t have anybody to tell me about it, but I know that it \u2014 the \u2014 that was\nout of the ghetto, and I \u2014 I assume that my parents were \u2014 they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nreally live very Jewish life, and they probably had a lot of friends. And my \u2014 my\nuncle was a musician, and he had probably his own artist fre \u2014 friends. So, I assume\nthat that\u2019s how we got out of the ghetto.",
        "A: Or we\u2019ve never been \u2014 I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve been in the ghetto. I\u2019m not sure,\nbut I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know where it was. I\u2019m sure that it wasn\u2019t in the ghetto. Somehow.",

It was from \u2014 because there\nis a date, 1936. And it was my mother, my father, my uncle, and behind, it was\nwritten, Auntie Bronia(ph), but I don\u2019t know who sister she was.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Adela(ph)",
        "A: It is. The whole thing is quite a mystery. I mean that the \u2014 the fact that the \u2014 all\nthese years, nobody showed up, but they \u2014 they \u2014 they lived in a place, in a big city\nlike Warsaw. They probably had friends or relatives, family. Nobody ever, except\nmy uncle, nobody ever showed up.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes. But still.",
        "A: The next memory I have is that my mother is coming to take me from this house,\nfrom this apartment, and we are 1n a very crowded place in, it was probably the\nHotel Polski in Warsaw. And then we\u2019re in a little [indecipherable] train, very,\nvery small place, and people were just next to each other, and it was very hard to\nbreathe. And people were crying and screaming and it was \u2014 1t was \u2014 and I was on\nmy \u2014 in \u2014on my mother\u2019s arms. And then I remember that we got to a place, door\nwere opened, and the \u2014 they took us out, you know, like a cattle.",
        "A: I remember this. I remember this. I remember they took us to showers, very cold\nshowers. And were \u2014 and plenty of women together in this shower, and my mother\nput me on \u2014 on the floor, which was disgusting. It was cold, and the water \u2014 and wet\nand th \u2014 and then she picked me up. And then, when we got out of the showers, I\nwas with her, and with a man. The story goes that my mother \u2014 that be \u2014 I been tell\n\u2014 told later, that it was this arrangement that the German maid with the Jewish\nauthorities or something, that they will exchange people who had a certificate to\nPalestine for German people who lived in Israel \u2014 in Palestine, at that time. They\nwere the T-Templers, tho \u2014 the big communit \u2014 German community in Palestine.\nAnd we know that some of them really adopted the Nazi 1-ideas. And the Germans\nwanted to exchange them, I think. So they announce that the people who has\ncertificate to Palestine will come to Hotel Polski, which was a hotel in Warsaw,\nand they will take to \u2014 take us to Palestine. My mother found this man who had the\n\u2014 on his papers there were, the woman and a child. But they weren\u2019t exist any more.\nSo she paid him, she gave him the \u2014 what she had. And we were with him.",
        "A: I have a\u2014I-\u2014I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 whatever it\u2019s \u2014 what - my memory\nabout him 1s \u2014 is something wer \u2014 very frightening. Really frightening, he was a\nvery frightening man to me, because he \u2014 later on we knew that he hit me and sort\nof abused me, not \u2014 not sexually, but he abused me. Because I \u2014 my mother been\ntaken away. As we got out of those showers, my mother disappeared, and I left with\nthe man.",
        "A: I saw her, they took me to see her, she was in the hospital. And I thought that\nthere is a hospit \u2014 there was a hospital out of the camp, but I know now that it was a\nho-hospital ou \u2014 inside the camp.",
        "A: I was with this man \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and they put me in the man barrack.",
        "A: No, Hotel Polski \u2014 we took us from Hotel Polski, put us on the trains, and we\nthought that this is the end of the \u2014 of the [indecipherable] and that we are going to\nPalestine. But instead they took us to Bergen-Belsen, the whole transport.",
        "A: No, that what we had in Bergen-Belsen \u2014 [ read about it. It was \u2014 we all\nconsidered to be the Palestinian Jew \u2014 Palestinians.",

        "A: Yeah. I think that she was a \u2014 that time she was very, very sick, because she died\nvery soon after. She had TB, tuberculosis, so she died, and that\u2019s why did \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t let her to leave with all the others, they left her there. And they next thing I\nremember was I was on the top bed. You know they had those beds, with \u2014 and I\nwas on top bed in this barrack and there were other people there, about three people,\nor \u2014 few people left in the barrack during the day, and I heard them talking. And I\nheard that they said something like, poor child, her mother died. Something like\nthat. In the same time, when they \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, but they were talking between \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 themselves. And I heard somebody humming. So, always this kind of music\nand bad news. Well \u2014",

They probably didn\u2019t think that I\u2019m listening, or didn\u2019t\nconsider me listening.",
        "A: No, there was only me.",
        "A: Yeah, it was \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what we know from other testimonies and the stories that\nthe women in the women barrack told \u2014 told us that they \u2014 they saw that this man 1s\nreally very hard on me, and then decided to take me away from him.",

I remember smell.\nAnd \u2014 and tha \u2014 then I remember hearing booming and shooting and then the train\nstopped. And we went under the train. There was shooting. We ran \u2014",

        "A: No, it was a roof \u2014 the train was partly cattle cars and partly passengers car. And\nprobably we were in the cattle car, because it was very \u2014 too cozy. And there were\nshooting and the train stopped, and we ran after \u2014 down to \u2014 underneath the train,\nand then I looked at this woman next to me, and she didn't move. She was dead. So,\nthat was \u2014",
        "A: The German. They wanted to bomb this train. Their plan was, initially, to get rid\nof the plane, to bomb it. And one of their cars were full of explosions. So, what\nhappened in the train, that the \u2014 this train, for a week was riding backward and\nforward, many of the railroads were bombed, so they had to go back. And on the\nway they picked up more workers from labor camps, so the train was full of Polish\npeople from Bergen-Belsen and Hungarians and Finnish and all kind of people that\nthey found. Were 2500 people on the train. And th \u2014 1n the end the pr \u2014 the train\nstopped near a city called Magedburg(ph).",

And again somebody, some\nyoung soldier came back and said, oh, don\u2019t blame us, we\u2019re not all the same, and\nrun away. And we s-stayed there. This woman next to me was dead, I was under the\ntrain. And then came the Americans. They were all chewing chewing gum. So they",

And then they \u2014 they went and they brought others,\nbecause what they saw there wasn\u2019t very nice. There were plenty of people dy-\ndying and dead.

        "A: I re \u2014 yes, very much so, because for years I \u2014 I always, in my memory it always\nwas a hill. And then I saw pictures of this train, probably from the other side, which\nwas a plateau. And I thought maybe it was, you know, my memory and it\u2019s not as\naccurate. But when I saw the pictures now, I saw that it was exactly how I\nremember it. And now the \u2014 the American came and they gave us \u2014 they \u2014 I\nremember plenty of \u2014 of \u2014 sort of \u2014 plenty of joy. And they gave us something very,\nvery nice and sweet. Was chocolate. Which I never had before. And then they took\nus \u2014 now, I remember they took us to another camp, which was Buchenwald, and I\nremembered it was Buchenwald. I remember myself now alone, standing in the \u2014\nin the line for food, you know, and walking there. And then they evacuated, they\ntook the pla \u2014 th-the people and they put them to pi \u2014 two places, Fursleben(ph)\nand Hillersleben. And nobody took me, so they all left the camp, and I had my little\ndoll that Bronka(ph) made me, which at that time I think that was leg missing, hand\nmissing, whatever. And I was sitting with this little doll, alone. The whole place\nwas empty.",
        "A: Buchenwald.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then it was a woman came back, with her son. She said because they\nall \u2014 they had trucks and all kind of vehicles, and she came back. She came back for\nme. She said, give \u2014 give hand to Tommy and come with us. And I didn\u2019t want to. I\nwanted to stay. I was talk \u2014 this time I was remem \u2014 I remember I was talking to my\ndoll. I was telling her that when everyone left, I was telling her that she shouldn\u2019t be\nafraid, because I am with her and I am taking care of her. So then the \u2014 this lady\nsaid, okay, again she ha \u2014 give hand to Tommy and come with us. Tommy was her\nson. I said, well, I can go by myself. And I went with them. I didn\u2019t give hand to\nTommy. And I went with them, and we were taken to Hillersleben. And was a\nbeautiful, beautiful place. I remember sunshine and be \u2014 remember little white\nhouses, beautiful streets, and bougava \u2014 bougainvillea, which was \u2014 it was a \u2014",
        "A: It was a town.",
        "A: It was a town that the families of the aviation forces lived. And we got the house\nthere. I was with the Hilde Huppert, it was the name of the lady, and her son,\nTommy. And the \u2014 oh, the flowers, that bougainvillea, that was the purple\nbougainvillea.",
        "A: This was \u2014 I saw my flir \u2014 yeah, first flowers. The second time I saw this \u2014 this\nexactly flowers, the wa \u2014 purple bougainvillea, it was in \u2014 in another war. In the\nIndependent war, in Jerusalem. So, I remember \u2014 I remember getting into this\nhouse, and they had bed with sh-sheets, white sheets. I never seen white sheets in\nmy life. And Hilde Huppert put us in the bath, she put me in the bath. And it was\nwarm, and nice, and it wasn\u2019t cold any more. It was very, very nice, I didn\u2019t want to\nget out. And \u2014 and she put me in the bed. In the beginning I was with my clothes, I\nwanted to go on the bed, and she said, no, no, you c \u2014 you\u2019re not allowed with\nclothes on bed. So that was a nice time there. I don\u2019t know how long we were \u2014",

        "A: She [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, all our barrack had the certificate. And some of them, like Nuta(ph)\nGudkowski(ph), the one with \u2014 with the girl, her husband also \u2014 they managed to\nrun away because the \u2014 the German in the beginning, they \u2014 they were after the\nmen. So some of the men managed to escape, and they \u2014 some of them escaped to\nPalestine. And that\u2019s how they send us the \u2014 the papers. So, I remember \u2014 at that\ntime I rem \u2014 I remember Tommy was teasing me all the time. He said, you don\u2019t\nhave pa \u2014 father, you don\u2019t have mother, I have a father in Palestine and wa \u2014 we\nwill see him, we go there. And I said, I don\u2019t care. And \u2014 and then we \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow how long we were in Hillersleben, but it was a beautiful place, a nice place.\nSomehow I had the feeling, I\u2019m not sure because I didn\u2019t \u2014 Hilde Huppert wrote a\nbook, \u201cHand in Hand with Tommy.\u201d And I don\u2019t remember that she mentioned it,\nbut th \u2014 it is in my memory that she wanted Tommy to learn English. And she \u2014 she\nhad someone and I was just sitting and listening to this. But again, I don\u2019t know\ncause I \u2014 it haven\u2019t been mentioned and I didn\u2019t ask her about it. But I \u2014 if I\nremember this, probably it was right. And then Hilde Huppert arranged \u2014 she met a\nJewish rabbi in the American Army. Her name was Neueman(ph). And she\narranged for a children transport to Palestine. Somehow they managed to \u2014 to find\nchildren who were from the age of six, seven, five and 20, they\u2019re all children, and\nthey took us there, it was a big transport, and th \u2014 we got to Paris. I remember \u2014",

We wen \u2014 been\ntaken to Hotel Lutetia, which was a \u2014 still is the hotel in Paris. At that time it was a\n\u2014 the hotel that they brought refugees. And then I \u2014 no, I remember that we been\ntaken to a beautiful place, it was in the country. And we were there for three weeks,\nit was some kind of rehabilitation place, you know, cause the \u2014 it was a river there,\nor a lake, and we were there, and it was very, very nice. And then we got on the\nship, and we taken to Palestine. And we arrived in Palestine in the six, I think,\nsixth of July, 1945.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember myself playing with anybody. I was with Tommy \u2014",
        "A: Sort of. Tommy was a \u2014 sort of. I di \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I remember not \u2014 not liking him\nbecause he was teasing me all the time. And \u2014 but I was very, very attached to\nHilde Huppert, felt very close to her, and she was very, very nice. Very nice lady.\nShe took care of me. But when we arrived in Palestine, we arrived into another\ncamp, which was [indecipherable] camp with \u2014 now there were other soldiers,\ndifferent uniform, but that was a camp, with the barbed wire, with the barracks. At\nthat time Hilde and Tommy, I remember stand \u2014 coming there, and I was with\nthem, and it was a tall man standing on the other side, and they went with him.\nTommy said, this is my father. And to \u2014 and we went with him.",
        "A: The \u2014 no, they went \u2014 they went with him, and I left in the camp.",
        "A: Was very terrible. But I already knew that I am \u2014 I\u2019m on my own. Even when I\nwas with Hilde Huppert, and even when \u2014 when I was with the children. That \u2014\nmaybe that I don\u2019t remember them because I didn\u2019t really develop relationship with\nthem. I remember the first night in Atleet(ph). They gave us what we thought that\nthey are Israeli \u2014 Israeli clothes. Shorts and khaki shirts, and I remember lying in\nbed, and this was near Haifa, and seeing all the lights going by and was thinking\nthat it\u2019s an \u2014 it\u2019s another place, it\u2019s a new place. So that \u2014 that was \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nhow long I was in Atleet(ph). I \u2014",
        "A: Oh, th \u2014 the shorts. The British soldiers, they have knee socks, knee-high socks.\nAnd di-different \u2014 different hats. They didn\u2019t look so frightening like the German.\nBut they were soldiers, it was a camp. It was a line to food, and \u2014 and it was a barb\nwire, So 1t was a camp.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, no, no. I know from Hilde Huppert\u2019s book that she said when she saw me\nsitting there alone, she said, ah this is \u2014 tha-that was Lily, the girl, she was on her\nown, and we knew that she was walking around, we just saw her always alone. So, I\ndon\u2019t think that anybody was in charge of me, except of the women who took care\nof me at the time. But they all disappeared, for many reasons. Probably some of\nthem died, or I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: Hilde.",

        "A: \u2014 after the train and \u2014 and \u2014 you know. She didn\u2019t know me. She went \u2014 she saw\nme there, then she reme \u2014 she saw me that she said, this is the girl who was always",
        "A: \u2014 on her own, alone.",
        "A: But she didn't know me from before. I don\u2019t know how exactly this camp was,\nbut they \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that they will \u2014 they wer \u2014 it was big enough that they didn\u2019t\nknow each other.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: No, no, because I \u2014 I didn\u2019t trust \u2014 although I was with her, and although I got\nreally attached to her at the time, but I knew already that there is no n \u2014 adult person\nthat I should trust, that I am on \u2014 I am on my own. So, that happened before, that\nhappened so many times during all these years in Bergen-Belsen, which people\ncame and go and \u2014 in my life. So, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think that I should \u2014 I should\nhave trust anybody. Wasn\u2019t any trust on my part. I knew that there \u2014 I \u2014 I have to\ntake care of myself.",
        "A: I was adopted, not officially, but I was adopted by the family in Palestine and\nIsrael. And again, when the [indecipherable] was in a kibbutz, Ma\u2019ale\nHamisha(ph) of Jerusalem, their mother, her name is Badana(ph) said to me, you\nknow, you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t call me mother. Don\u2019t you call me mother, you had a\nmother, and you should remember her. I don\u2019t know, it probably should be\nsomething very [indecipherable] educationally, but I do \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that it was\nthe right thing to do.",
        "A: So, but that was what \u2014 that was what \u2014 what she said, what happened, and I\nnever called her mother. I \u2014 I\u2019ve really fell in love with \u2014 she already had a \u2014a year\nand a half older son than me, and two weeks baby, two weeks old baby. And she\nwanted to adopt a kid from the Holocaust because \u2014 for the memory of her family,\nwhich been perished in the war. And I didn\u2019t feel that \u2014 that she is my mother. I \u2014 I\nwas in love with my father \u2014 with the father, but maybe they weren\u2019t my \u2014 my\nparents, but the children were my brothers.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",

She lived in a\nkibbutz next to a kibbutz they lived, and she took me there. And I remember the\nroad to the \u2014 to \u2014 all the road to Jerusalem. And it was funny because not long\nafter, it was the \u201948 war that was there. And th-the \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t the same road.\nAnd I was always thinking, was it my memory that \u2014 that I saw this hills, and this\nmountains? Which from the side, and I never see them again. But when, after the\n\u00b067 war, when they opened this road again, there it was, exactly wa \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 everything that I remember, and I checked \u2014 I checked up about the holo \u2014 the\n\u2014 the hospital in Bergen-Belsen, and I learned that it was a hospital. Because in the\nbeginning they said to me there wasn\u2019t any hospital, and I remember that my\nmother was in the hospital. And I remember \u2014 I remember the camp. I don\u2019t\nremember \u2014 I remember \u2014 I remember the \u2014 the light inside the barrack. I remember\nthe \u2014 the blankets.",

        "A: Probably, probably yeah. Yes, yes. Because when I got into the kibbutz, and I \u2014 I\nremember the first day. They put me with the other children and we all had supper.\nAnd they all looked so different. And I didn\u2019t speak the language. And I remember\nthat somehow a \u2014 and though I was so different, I don\u2019t remember that \u2014 it was\nsomething in that \u2014 in my present that children didn\u2019t laugh at me. And the first\nnight \u2014 night, and then few nights later, they used to \u2014 to give me this treatment for\nthe lice. And that was with this kerosene oil, you know, they \u2014 they used to wash\nyour head, and then \u2014",

And with the \u2014 with the other chil \u2014 other\nthree girls in the same room, and it was really very humiliating, night after night\nafter night. And somehow, I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know what did I do, or\nhow I fel \u2014 I was presented myself. But it wasn\u2019t a laugh, it wasn\u2019t a mockery. And\nI always \u2014 I wanted very much to be like them, of course. I wanted to be \u2014 I wanted\nto have dark hair, I wanted to have freckles. I wanted to \u2014 to speak that \u2014 like them.\nBut after a very short while I understand \u2014 I understood that I won\u2019t be like them,\never. I had this straight, blonde hair, and a \u2014 a white face, and a \u2014 and I remember\nmyself making decision. I remember like always lying in the bed thinking to\nmyself, all right, so if I\u2019m not \u20141f I am different, I will be different. I will be\ndifferent, it\u2019s okay. And I was different. And I \u2014 I\u2014I held myself differently. I\ndidn\u2019t let them \u2014 because I saw how there were other children who came, they were\n\u2014 they always came with the uncles and aunties and fa \u2014 parents to the kibbutz from\nthe Holocaust. And they \u2014 they \u2014 I saw how they related to them, and I s \u2014 I know\nthat th-they didn\u2019t relate to me like that, cause I was a \u2014 like my \u2014 when my brother\nsaid, you are the queen. So that was \u2014 I \u2014 I had \u2014 I\u2014 I make decision. I remember\nmyself making decision. Never \u2014 never f \u2014 be sort of, the girl from there \u2014 from the\nHolocaust. So, I think th-that in a way, my \u2014 my \u2014 my childhood, which was so\ndeprived, was an engine to me growing up in different way.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They were there, and then e \u2014 1t were my two brothers. And then when I was 10,\nmy young brother was born, and they were very much my family, very much.",
        "A: Oh yes. I was the only g-girl, he had three boys. Oh yes, he adored me. And my\nmother, she was very, sort of, educational person. She was a teacher and a \u2014 always\nasked psychologists what to do, and she always used to say, Shlamic(ph), you\ndestroying the kid. You spoiling the kid. Cause he used to bring me tea to bed when\nI came out \u2014 I went on holiday. Shlamic(ph) \u2014 and he was a \u2014 he was a wonderful\nman. He was self \u2014",

But, on her 80\" birthday \u2014 90\" birthday, I \u2014 I talked, and I\nsaid that, in spite everything, she was the only mother I know \u2014 I knew. So, she was\nmy mother and she is my mother. I don\u2019t call her my mother. I don\u2019t call her my\nmother, but she ki \u2014 she 1s.",

She \u2014 she\u2019s a very\nbeautiful person, and I think that she wanted to pay respect to \u2014 to the family that\nperished.

        "A: S-So \u2014 and she also wanted me to remember that I had a family. She didn\u2019t want\nme to forget it. And that\u2019s was her main \u2014 main reason \u2014",
        "A: So on the a \u2014 one \u2014 one side, she wanted me, because that \u2014 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t\nspeak Polish this day. They never spoke Polish to me. And she said in the beginning\nI [indecipherable] Polish \u2014 I spoke Polish, but very di \u2014 very quickly, I really\nforgot it. On the other hand, I think that she, because she has such a family duty,\nand her family is a very, very [indecipherable] very famous family in Israel. And\nso \u2014 so the f\u2014 upper class of the Jewish families, her family 1s, is I think that\ntogether with this, she respected family. She didn\u2019t want me to forget that I had\nmother and father. I can understand it, I just don\u2019t know if I could accept it at the\ntime, but I can understand it.",
        "A: Oh, they are my brothers. They were always my brothers. Also, my mother, my\nadopted mother Anna, her husband, they were very \u2014 my mother is \u2014 was a very\nidealistic person. She worked for the others, she always had duties. She never was\nat home. Even for her own children, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t any difference. And\nhe was the head of \u2014 the kibbutz had a \u2014 a guest house, so he was the head of the\nguest house. And on my 70\", we \u2014 we celebrated my 70\" birthday, what we thought\nit we \u2014 it is, just last October, and \u2014 and [indecipherable] December. And my\nbrother got up and he said, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t have parents, we only had each other.\nSaid in front of her, in front of all the guests. It was a surprise fa \u2014 party. We only\nhad each other, and I had the eldest sister. So yes, we were brothers. One of them\nwas killed when he was 18 and a half.",
        "A: He was in the army, was in this commando unit, and got killed. And so we \u2014 we\nleft, the two of them and me. And we are very, very much \u2014 very much attached to\neach other. So, it was a family. Their family, they have a very big fa-family. My\nmother \u2014 my adopted mother had a very \u2014 has a very big family. So there wa \u2014 I\nbeen accepted as a family, completely. And they \u2014 and so much so that they used to\nsay that I look like my father. They were [indecipherable] oh, it show.\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: They didn\u2019t want me to \u2014 they didn\u2019t want me to speak Polish.",
        "A: Because they \u2014 they thought at that time that it\u2019s better to forget. I think that it\nwas their idea of, for all the children that, you know, sort of start new life, and just\nerase what happened there.",
        "A: They are in Poland, yeah, the ma \u2014 the kibbutz \u2014 the kibbutz mot \u2014 founders are\nall Polish. And few of them came \u2014 my adopted mother, her name is Badana(ph),\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 her family had the school and kindergar \u2014 garten in Hebrew, in Lodz.\nSo, their first language is Hebrew. And the \u2014 some of the people in the kibbutz, they\nwere in the kindergarten and in the school. This is the Katznelson(ph) family which\nthe Katznelson [indecipherable] family which was [indecipherable] very, sort of\nknown family. So, they didn\u2019t want, because that was their idea in that time. And\nthere were very, very sad stories because of that. Nobody ask questions, nobody\ntalked. We didn\u2019t talk. Of course, I didn\u2019t talk, because I want \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to be\nlike the rest, wanted just stories that I\u2019m telling. And \u2014 and also, I was \u2014 lam \u2014 I -\nwell, I remember very early in my life that I was thinking that I probably did\nsomething horrible, if that\u2019s what happened to me. So, if I don\u2019t have mother and\nfather, and no \u2014 so, that was a thought that walked with me quite a long \u2014 many\nyears in my childhood. Then, there were \u2014 people used to come to look for their\nrelatives, the first years. And each time when they came, I was already \u2014 already\nwas thinking that maybe one day, you know, the door will open and my mother will\ncome in, or my father. And for years and years I used to daydream and night dream\n\u2014no, night dream I was dreaming about horrible things and I was a \u2014 afraid of\ngetting out of the \u2014 of the bed. Was quite awful, the night dreams. But during the\nday I used to daydream that they \u2014 they will come back. They will come for me. So\nall \u2014 each time when somebody came, you know, it was a new hope. But then\nBadana(ph) said, that\u2019s it, stop. I don\u2019t want it any more. And then, when my \u2014\nwhen we heard from my uncle, I think that 1t was after the \u2014 no, 1t was before the\nwar, before the \u201948 war. He discovered me through Aliyah Tenora(ph), through the\nyouth organization. And he started to write letters, and s \u2014 and send me all kind of\nbeautiful clothes, because at that time we all had \u2014 all the children had clothes from\npeople from America, from [indecipherable]. Only me, I didn't have \u2014 also, I\nwouldn\u2019t have because my adopted mother was a very idealistic person and she\nwouldn\u2019t accept it, you know, that \u2014 but he did send me things, beautiful things.\nAnd also, Hilde Huppert used to come to visit me, and Nuta(ph) Gudkowski(ph),\nthis lady with the child. She \u2014 they both used to come to visit me. And Hilde used\nto bring me all things that she was knitted, cause she was a very good knitter. And I\nhave a picture of myself with the knitting sweater that she have. And so, in this\nsense, I \u2014 I felt okay with the other children. And then was the \u201948 war, was another\nwar. So from war to war, and the \u2014 again, I think that I was on my own. I was \u2014 I wa\n\u2014 not on my own at that time, because \u2014 but then a \u2014 was the kindergarten teacher,\nso she was with the other children. That what my brother meant when we were\nalone, with [indecipherable] parents. And I remember sitting on this truck with my\nsix months old brother on my lap, when all the other mothers were sitting with their\nbabies, with their children, and I was sitting with him. So, I was on my own.",
        "A: I didn't relate to it. |\u2014 I \u2014 I think that at that time, and many years later, I really\nwanted to detach myself from a \u2014 the whole thing. And so I knew that I couldn\u2019t\ndeny to myself that I was there, I didn\u2019t want to be part of it. I read books, I saw\nfilms, but always sort of dissociation of that, you know, not being part of it, and I\ndidn't want to talk about it. I never talked. I didn\u2019t talk to my children.",
        "A: I start talking about it when my granddaughters were at school. I have twin\ngranddaughters, my son children. And they did this work, you know, what they call\nroot work, family. And I wrote to them. I wou \u2014 I decided that I \u2014 I will write to\nthem.

        "A: I don\u2019t know, I think that \u2014 that somehow I missed the train. You know, maybe I\n\u2014 I had to talk about it \u2014 I had very special relationship with my son. I ga \u2014 gave\nbirth to him when I was 18 and a half, and I probably grow \u2014 grew up with him.\nAnd I never wanted to [indecipherable] It\u2019s okay?",

I think that a\nfew years la \u2014 a-ago, he said one day, he said, what your father di-did for a living? I\nsaid, I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I found out that he was a soldier, but no \u2014 no more than that.\nI didn\u2019t want to \u2014 even now, when \u2014 he said, cause I went \u2014 we went to see\n[indecipherable] and then here, I said, well, have some fun, it\u2019s \u2014 not everything 1s\nthe Holocaust, you know?

He had a \u2014 when\nmy daughter was five months old, he had the car accident, and he was in the\nhospital. And I was with my daughter. And then when he was a \u2014 back home, after\nawhile, she \u2014 she had \u2014 she was born with a hernia in the diaphragm, and she was in\nthe hospital for two years. So, from the age of one til the age of three she was in the\nhospital. And he had to s \u2014 really come back to his senses after this car accident.\nAnd I was with her, and that again was this alone feeling. That I was with her all the\ntime in the hospital. I was like one of the requisite, you know, chair. Another chair\nin the hospital. And this was ch \u2014 very, very familiar feeling, you know, that there\u2019s\nnobody there. She was three times dead, clinical dead, and \u2014 and I was there all the\ntime, and that was just me. Was ma \u2014 my f\u2014 my war, my battle. Again, to fight for\nsomething, as if this is my fate, you know? Always fighting. And that was \u2014 that hit\nme very, very strongly among all the other things that happened with my daughter,\nthat was one of the \u2014 also I remember, before she was born and my son was small,\nwhen he was just born and I was sitting \u2014 I was waking up in the middle of the\nnight. And I know that many mothers always going to their children to see if they\nare breathing, but I was sitting there thinking, where was I, this age? And I\u2014I-\u2014I\nwas so scared, I used to spend na \u2014 nights and nights and nights next to his bed, just\nwaiting for them to \u2014 to come and take him. So that\u2019s when things came back, but I\ndidn\u2019t want to talk about it, cause whom I going to tell? What am I going to say?",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s true, very true.",

        "A: Yeah, very lonely.",
        "A: My daughter, she had a time when she went to the university, after she spoke to\nNuta(ph), she came \u2014 we lived in England at that \u2014 at that time, and she had to do\nthis essay about prisoners. So she wrote the whole essay like a script, as her being in\na war, age of 13. And of course it ha \u2014 1t was happy ever after at the end, was happy\nend. But she wrote this script which was really now, breathtaking, and she won the\nfirst prize, and everything. And I was thinking, gosh, where this came from?",
        "A: Yeah. And her \u2014 her subject, on her B.A. was hidden art in Nazi Germany.",
        "A: In England. And she did \u2014 her B.A. was in \u2014 in England in Goldsmith College.",
        "A: No, I live in \u2014 I came back to Israel after 14 years. She lives in England now.",
        "A: But my son did his PhD. in England, in scon \u2014 London School of Economics.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "A: In political \u2014 political science [indecipherable]. And he\u2019s the dean of NYU in\nIsrael. Proud mother, Jewish mother.",
        "A: I know.",
        "A: And there \u2014 there \u2014 one thing he did, he went \u2014 what was happening 1s that th-\nthey sending students for three months into different countries. The - NYU has\nbranches. So they \u2014 the first lot of student came, and some of the things they studied\nwas about the Holocaust, or Nazi Germany [indecipherable]. And she came to me\nand ask me 1f I would like to talk to them, to those students.",
        "A: Which was \u2014 yeah, which was really unusual for him. And I did. I said yes. And\nwhen I came and they stood in front of this very, very young guy, used to \u2014 Israeli\nstudents are always 22 - 23, because they go to the army, and here they were 18\nyears old children. I was looking at them and I was thinking, where do I begin to\ntell the story of my life? And I decided not to talk about the war, and not to \u2014 I se \u2014\nI \u2014 I was thinking that they can read about it, they can learn about it. What I chose\nto talk about was how do you live with this story, and how you grow up, and how y\n\u2014 how you make your life and how you became a how \u2014 mother.",
        "A: I-I think that what strengthened me was the idea that I overcomed, I \u2014 I won\nsomething, and I wa \u2014 survived. I think that surviving is the be \u2014 the biggest thing in\nme. I\u2019m a\u2014 I\u2019m a survivor. And whatever happened, I knew that I can stand on my\nown feet, even now, these days. So, I\u2014 I\u2014 I have this strong feeling about it. I think\nthat what been taken away from me is my past. I have this feeling that I don\u2019t have\na past. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know it.",
        "A: Not that long ago, I wanted \u2014 the \u2014 there are many people in Israel are a-\napplying for passports [indecipherable] in different countries because they want to\nbe part of the common market. And \u2014 and my granddaughters asked me to apply for\na Polish passport because th-they might want to learn in \u2014 abroad. So I called this\nwoman, I gave her \u2014 I got number. I got 1t \u2014 call this woman, she\u2019s th \u2014 an Israeli\nspeak \u2014 Hebrew speaking. She works for the Polish embassy. I called her and I told\nher my name, I told her that I was born in Warsaw, and they \u2014 she said, date of\nbirth? I said, I don\u2019t know. So she said, wait a minute. She went, she looked for\nsomething, then she came back to the phone, she said, you are not exist. So\nimmediately I said, for the German I was very exist. So, this is \u2014 this is the thing; I\ndon\u2019t exist. That\u2019s why I do \u2014I didn\u2019t want to go to Poland, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t \u2014\nmaybe now, I don\u2019t know. I have a friend in \u2014 in England. She\u2019s Polish, she\u2019s not\nJewish. Polish th \u2014 couple, they are making films. And she said to me, you know\nwhat? I\u2019Il go with you to Poland, to Warsaw. They really rebuilt old Warsaw.",
        "A: So she said, we will go with the life, not with the death. We will go to the \u2014 to\nthe cafe they will \u2014 they might sit on the way to the theater, to the \u2014 to that\nrestaurant, to that restaurant that you \u2014 they used to dance there. You know, this\nwhere we should go, on [indecipherable] to the theater. And I will go with you.",
        "A: I \u2014 this \u2014 this I could accept, you know. I couldn\u2019t accept that I would go to\nsomething which is not exist any more. And then \u2014 but I do have this feeling that\nit\u2019s been taken away from me, very much so. Maybe this 1s the reason that I didn\u2019t\nwant to talk to my children, because I \u2014 what could I tell them?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have grandmothers that they could relate to, grandfathers. They\ndidn\u2019t have \u2014 they didn\u2019t have any family they could relate to. The only thing that I\nknew there, I knew the names, and by then I have pictures.",
        "A: No, I have some more. Some more pictures.",
        "A: No. I have a \u2014 pictures from my \u2014 of my uncle in Paris, and I have the pink \u2014\npicture of him standing on the s-stage with his clarinet. And that was five minute\nbefore he died.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: [know \u2014 I know why he esc \u2014 why he escaped from Poland, of course he\nescaped.",

        "A: Judenrat in the ge \u2014 ghetto.",
