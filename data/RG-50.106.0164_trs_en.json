        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Thea Sacca Rips, conducted by Gail Schwartz on January 20\", 2004, in\nWashington, D.C.. This is tape number one, side A. What is your full name?",
        "Answer: Thea Marguerita Valeria Sacca Rips.",
        "Q: And when were you born and where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Trieste on February 24, 1922.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your family, how long they had been there.",
        "A: Here in the United States, you mean?",
        "Q: No, how long they had been in Trieste.",
        "A: Well, in Trieste from \u201922 to \u201927, because my father was working -- he was an\nengineer, electrical engineer, and he was working with the shipyards in Monfalcone. And\nwhen it were -- he was transfers to Fiume, which now 1s Rijeka. We moved to Fiume\nwhen I was about five years old. And we lived in Fiume until 1945, until the end of the\nwar. And Father worked there, he was a chief -- he was the director of the electrical\ndepartment of the shipyard. Can-Cantieri Navale del Quarnaro, where they were\nbuilding all kind of ships, from submarines, even to the yacht for Mussolini they built,\nwhich was never delivered. And he was in charge of -- not only of the projects for the\nelectrical equipment on the ships, but also of the -- care of the cranes and all the electrical\nequipment of the shipyard itself. And practically I was born with fascism, grew under\nJanuary 20, 2004\nfascism, without realizing -- it wa -- it w -- 1t was normal for -- for s -- my life. And we\nwent to school. Then they came when -- when we went to school. Of course, we were all\nsupposed to be piccolo Italiani, small, little Italians, because otherwise the schools --\napparently we were not able to go to school, as far as I know. I never realized that, of\ncourse. And I went through the whole system until I finished the -- what we call senior\nhigh school. Actually it is the Liceo Scientifico, Scientific Lyceum, which is practically\ncomparable to the -- to here -- even though it was only four year. Four year of junior high\nand four years of senior high. The junior high I went to the technical institute. The senior\nhigh I went to the Liceo Scientifico. But as far as education, they told me it\u2019s\ncomparable, when you finish Liceo Scientific -- Scientifico, excuse me, like two years of\ncollege in this country, because we had very thorough, you know, the education in\nEurope. And that\u2019s it. My father continued to work. H-He was never a -- a -- a carda -- a\ncard holding fascist. He became -- he had to become or -- or -- a member of the fascist\nparty in 1942, because otherwise he would have lost his job and h-he had responsibilities\n[indecipherable]. He had trouble because he didn\u2019t want to wear the uniform, and he\nnever had a uniform and he never wore the black tie -- the -- the black shirt. But you\nknow, they were, with the exceptions of few fanat -- a few -- several fanatics, the\npopulation was a strange population in Fiume because they were open-minded on one\nside and fascist on the other side because after the first World War, Fiume was next to\nItaly only in 1924, after the famous DiNunzio coup. Apparently th-the Italians didn\u2019t\nJanuary 20, 2004\nwant them, but they felt and they are still feel f -- extremely Italian, even though the\npopulation was mixed and the ch -- the city was occupied by everybody, from the\nEspaniards to the st -- Napoleon, th-the Venetians. It started as an Roman colony and --\nbut they were always, who knows why, very deeply, they felt deeply Italian. And so\nthat\u2019s why they accepted DiNunzio. So DiNunzio and Mussolini, even though they\ndidn\u2019t like each other very, very much, I must say -- for awhile they did, but then -- you\nsee, they connected their fact that they were -- that they could join the Italian, they were\nadmitted to be Italians betwe -- to DiNunzio and to Mussolini. So they felt in that fak --\nka -- in that sense they felt that they were fascists. Fascists because th -- fascism\npermitted them to be Italians, you know? The city was [indecipherable] after. And that\u2019s\nit. I tell you also another thing, that this city which was extremely wealthy, small city, we\nended up with 45,000 people, but we were much smaller when I was little, had many\nplans, many industries. It had the torpedo plant, it had th-the shipyards, it had the oil\nrefinery. It had heavy machinery plant, it had mills, and it -- ab-absolutely everything,\nand the population, the workers were very well off. They had nice houses, we were going\nskiing together at the engineers -- th-th-th-the director, with the son of th-the -- th-th-th-\nth-the -- of -- of everybody. We were really a str -- strong community. We were playing\ntennis together with the children of the workers and so on. So much so that we had a\nlimited number of poor, who were known all by name, you see. And there was a very\nimportant Jewish community, Ashkenazi, coming from the east, from the Balkans, from\nJanuary 20, 2004\nGermany. | don\u2019t think there was a single Sephardic Jew, as far as I can remember. And\nwe had in Villa Firenze where we lived, among the other places, just across of it, a\nbeautiful, beautiful, three domed synagogue with the cupolas covered with copper tiles. It\nwas really beautiful. And living across the street from them, you see -- we were always\nsaying, oh, d -- you know, they were th-the -- the real Orthodox Jews, the one with the\ncurls and the -- and the fur k -- and the hats with the fur around it, you see. And we were\ns -- and -- and they were telling us, you know -- we were children, we were -- we were\nactually not so much children al-already, they were saying, oh well we cou -- we cannot\ngo in there, we cannot go in there, because you know, we -- they don\u2019t allow us to go\nthere and who knows what\u2019s going on there? But I never heard about -- people talking\nabout blood sacrifices or things like this because they were -- we were so interwined that\neven then there were not many, but there were several mixed marriages at the time. And\nin my case, for instance, I found -- I found out that some of my schoolmates in -- in\nschool were Jewish because they were allowed, on the Sabbath -- because at the time we\nwere going to school also on s -- on Saturday -- on the Sabbath they were not going to\nschool, but they were justified. They were allowed not to come, because until the racial\nlaws were applied, unfortunately, there was no problem. And -- and -- and -- and we were\ngoing -- Jewish kids and non-Jewish kids and Protestant kids, we were all together, we\ncouldn\u2019t care less about religion, o-or wherever they were coming from. And that was it.\nSo, what did I say? And I remember, of all these other people, there was a -- a v -- a very\nJanuary 20, 2004\ninteresting man, a -- a Jew, Mr. Tannenbaum, ma -- mister -- well fa -- probably Mr.\nTannenbaum, for us he\u2019s -- it looked like -- like a -- like a priest or something, because\n[indecipherable] we know, with the black caftan and the hat with the fur around. He was\nthe sweetest man in the world. My father knew him well. He didn\u2019t come to our house\noften, but he was going around the house of people he knew, he was friendly. He was\ncollecting money for charities. But charities not for the Jewish population, for everybody\nwho was born in town. He was well known for that. Then, of course, he disappeared. Life\nwas very comfortable in Fiume, very comfortable. Every year we were going to a\n[speaks Italian here]. And th-there I met a-another group of -- I had this group of Jewish\nfriends tha -- the Lagers, Bondy and Kathy Lager, his bra -- his cousin, and we were all\nhaving fun going to the ocean together [indecipherable] this or that. And I remember\nthey were already on guard in the sense that while we kind of ignored the musics from\nAmerica, jazz, the [indecipherable] they already heard, may-maybe because they had\nrelatives here or something, I don\u2019t know for sure. But anyhow, they were bringing this\nmusic and we learned jazz through these Jewish friends of ours, you know. They were\nreally fantastic. I remember that Bondy Lager was very much in love with me. An-And I\nmet Bondy when I first came here in \u201955, and he was married to an Austrian girl --\nJewish girl, and he had a child. And we met in -- in New York where he had a plant or --\nor -- or a store -- 0-of t-toys for -- and it -- 1t was very emotional, you know. After so\nmany years, you know I call, who\u2019s there? He says, B-Bondy\u2019s there. Also because when\nJanuary 20, 2004\nBondy escaped from Fiume in -- just as -- with the last boat which left Naple, it must\nhave been 1940, his parents remained in Fiume. They were merchants and they had a\ndeposit with they had all kind of food, the potatoes, all kind of thing. Th-The parents\nremained in Fiume, but Bondy and his sister came to the States. And they left from\nNaples. And when they left Fiume by train to go to Naples, my sister and myself went to\nthe train to say goodbye. And the funny thing 1s that since at that time I was young and I\nhad many boys at the same time growing around me, my sister was saying, you know, yi\n-- there 1s like a -- like a-a -- a torta, a -- a cake. All the flies go to hel -- you know? So\nthat when Bondy was writing to me, he was saying lot of love to the torta, you know\n[indecipherable]. Well, that was the story of Bondy. His -- his cousin went to Milan, h-\nhe\u2019s -- hid in Milan, the -- Lazi, because they were of Hungarian descent, that Lazi --\nLadizlow, and -- and he was all right. Then what happened with this? The anschluss,\nyes, there\u2019s -- now we come to the real s -- thing, which is important.",
        "Q: Let -- let me just ask you some questions before we get to that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You say you had it -- you have a sister ti -- and what is her name?",
        "A: My sister name 1s Laura and she is five years younger than I am. And f -- wh-while\nwe were in Fiume, more or less we shared our life, but being five years younger, you\nknow, she had -- at that moment she had her group and I had my group. We were always\ntogether because we were hikers and skiers and we were going every f -- every weekend -\nJanuary 20, 2004\n- weekend -- every Sunday of every festivity. We -- Father introduced us to the love of\nnature and -- a-an-and -- and mountains and thing. We were going skiing or hiking. And\nshe was very funny, they loved her very much, so much so that when I f-finished the -- ha\n-- the Lyceum, the senior high and there was the party, she was invited too, because she\nwas so funny, and sh -- and so agile that she was making herself a ball, and they were\nthrowing her like one. It was -- she -- she\u2019s still a funny character, I must say.\nUnfortunately she cannot be a ball any more, but she 1s still go to the -- to the gym.",
        "Q: What are your parent\u2019s names?",
        "A: My father is Giorgio and my mother was Emma Pacore. Because my father parents\nwere -- are -- well, my gr-grandmother from my father\u2019s side was born in Courtsela, and\nmy grandfather was born in Montenegro, in Corta, but they lived always in Trieste. My\ngrandfather was a purser or [indecipherable] there 1s a special name, it\u2019s [speaks\nItalian] which is the assistant purser, but one who 1s in charge of buying all the material\nf-f-food, everything for the ships, for the liners of the Austrian Lloyd, which later on\nbecame Lloyd Adriatico. No, first I think it was Lloyd Triestino, and then Lloyd\nAdriatico. And he traveled a lot to the Orient, so much so that the house of my\ngrandparents had a lot of Oriental stuff, which like stupid we broke, and not only if we\nhad not broken, we had to leave there when we escaped as refugees, so it was all lost.\nAnd my -- and his mother -- I -- we -- I have the documents, but I don\u2019t remember -- I\ndon\u2019t know where she was born, but she was Italian speaking and German speaking, and\nJanuary 20, 2004\nshe had three sons. My grandfather was the youngest one, and when her husband died --\nand I don\u2019t know what her husband did, which I think he was making bottles, wine\nbottles. He had the plant where he was making wine bottles. And she was a -- she didn\u2019t\nfinish school. When my grandfather -- great grandfather died, on my father\u2019s side, she c -\n- finished her school, she became a teacher, and I still have the documents where she\nwrites to the Austrian, to Vienna, to have the permission to teach in a school for girls,\nyou know? But everything written in Italia. When Mussolini, as soon as he took over,\nforbade the people of our area -- we\u2019re in -- th-the interland of Fiume was Slav, Croatian\nand [indecipherable] Trieste Slav, Slovenian, he forbade them to use their language, he\nmade them change their names, and he was stupid, while Franz Josef was smart enough\nto let each -- each nationality to use their own language and si -- that\u2019s why we lost that,\nkind of, because if he had been more intelligent, I will speak Croatian, which I love, and -\n- and they wouldn\u2019t ha -- we -- we wouldn\u2019t have made enemies. Instead, they were\nenemies. Of course, they forced to -- to -- to use a language -- the old people wer -- never\ncould speak Italian, so --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And -- and Fiume is a -- a city on the -- on the Adriatic, a port city on the\nAdriatic --",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable] yes, it\u2019s right, you know, with the eastern peninsula on one side,\nyou know, there 1s like a triangle. There is Trieste. Then, at the tip of the triangle is\nPaola, or Pula as they call it now, and then it\u2019s Fiume on the other side that -- of -- and\nJanuary 20, 2004\nwe -- now it\u2019s called Rijeka, which means Fiume too, beca -- also in Russia, Rijeka is --\nRijeka is Fiume. And then immediately there is the Dalmatian coast and along the\nDalmatian coast, among the islands is the island where my grandmother was born. And\nmy grandmother was speaking German, of course, Croatian and Italian. So did my cra --\ngrandfather. So that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: You have one sister, do you have any other sisters or brothers?",
        "A: No, no, no, only one sister.",
        "Q: Now you say you were born in 1922.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: When a man named Hitler came into power in 1933, did you hear of him then?",
        "A: Well, you know, we kids, we couldn\u2019t care less about politics, you know. I think this\nis typical. Maybe now may -- maybe now kids follow more, but I know more about\nancient history than the history that I lived through. Now I remember, now I start to -- to\ngive importance to the facts, you know, but I went through the war in -- Spanish war,\nwhen -- when we had the Franco, that was a very good chance to go and take a day\nvacation because we were going demonstrating against this, or -- or when the\n[indecipherable] to go demonstrate on the British consulate. You know, it was -- in the\nmeantime we didn\u2019t know -- we\u2019re not going to school. We didn't even know what we are\ndoing, it was just having fun, you know. And as our famous journalist Indro Montanelli,\nwho is now -- now dead [indecipherable] said, you know, who cared about fascism or\nJanuary 20, 2004\nanything until things happened? We were young. We didn\u2019t think, we -- we didn\u2019t -- we\ndidn\u2019t s -- we didn\u2019t suffer. We didn\u2019t follow th-the -- all the stories so much\n[indecipherable] this and that. Father, yes, probably, but in my home we never spoke\nabout politics, never. Father was a rather -- rather closed character, and I think that we\n[indecipherable] never discussed politics. They just didn\u2019t agree, they did what they had\nto do, their job. They didn\u2019t participate to the famous [indecipherable] reunions, every ti\n-- ev-every -- every Saturday. They didn\u2019t -- they were just -- I mean, an-and they were\nnot disturbed, they -- they could live their life.",
        "Q: How religious was your family?",
        "A: Catholic. I was bor -- baptized -- born and baptized in Trieste in the famous San\nGiusto [indecipherable] church, you know, Roman -- beautiful Romanic church, yeah.",
        "Q: So, up to the time of the anschluss --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- you had Jewish friends, you were comfortable with them --",
        "A: Oh, very.",
        "Q: -- you played with them?",
        "A: Oh well, of course. Th-They\u2019 ve -- then, actually only after a -- a f -- I must say, after\nthe anschluss and then in \u201938 the ration laws came about, we realized that there were\nJews and non-Jews. And we were -- | -- I --\nJanuary 20, 2004",
        "Q: These are racial laws in Fiume?",
        "A: In da -- always in Fiume, yes, because we didn\u2019t move from Fiume until the end of\nthe war. A-And --",
        "Q: What -- what were some of the restrictions?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: What were some of the restrictions of the racial laws?",
        "A: Well, they were supposed not to have maids. The ki -- the girls couldn\u2019t come to\nschool, but the professor, for quite a long time, kept an eye closed and the kids were\ncoming to school just the same.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then, when they realized it, they started to be the -- th-the worst part started when the\nGermans took over, because until 1943, when the ger -- when, after the armistice, the\nGermans occupied the area, and it was the only area of Italy which was incorporated into\nGermany. At that time we became part of Germany. And that when the real trouble\nstarted.",
        "Q: A -- but up to that time, did you still have close contact with your Jewish friends?",
        "A: Yes, because after the anschluss, we had these -- well, in the same building was living\nan engineer fa -- naval engineer working [indecipherable] a friend of Father, working in\nthe same shipyard [indecipherable] Fierst, Bruno Fierst. Then there was the fa -- the\nWeiss family, Jewish. The daughter married a Catholic boy, a -- the brother of a friend of\nJanuary 20, 2004\nmine. She was studying piano, she was playing beautifully. On the groun -- on the first\nfloor was living -- were living the Moscovitz. The Moscovitz had a beautiful -- kind of\nhardware store, but they were selling toys and everything. And every Christmas\n[indecipherable] it was a two story thing, you know, and it was on the wa -- in the -- o-\non one of the main s-squares of Fiume, and they had on that -- on the second floor, an\nenormous window and there was appearing a Santa Claus, and showing -- and -- and the\nchildren, we were all on the street, you know, watching what was going on, and -- and he\nwas showing the [indecipherable] and the children, to me, to me, to me, to me, you\nknow, and these were the Moscovitz\u2019, you know? And they were very nice. She was a\nvery lovely little girl -- little woman, bu-but -- but he was even funnier because he was\nvery, very short and very, very, very prim all the time, you know? But wonderful people,\nand they all had the mezuzah, th-the mezuzah on the their door, so what? You know,\nthey [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did they ever confide in you that they were con -- or -- or -- your Jewish friends ever\nconfide in you that they were concerned or frightened?",
        "A: Until \u201943, no, they were not very -- they -- they didn\u2019t like the idea. Many were smart\nenough, many -- I don\u2019t know how many p -- but several left. But these friends, close\nfriends of ours who were living in the same building, they didn\u2019t. Then the -- the Weiss\nleft first. Then the Moscovitz left. They had a maid, the Moscovitz, Paula -- Paola,\nCatholic. And when they left, they left the apartment, they were in the way it was. But\nJanuary 20, 2004\neven -- yes, there it was with the mezuzah on the door. They only gave us to save, to put\naside for them, an enormous portrait, natural size, of Mr. Moscovitz, which we hid\nbehind a -- a -- an armoire we had, you know\u201d? [indecipherable] okay. And when the\nGermans came th-there, that apartment, th-the maid was there -- oh sorry -- that the maid\nwas there, and they occupied the apartment of the Moscovitz. They saw the mezuzah,\nthey could even -- they couldn\u2019t care less. They were there, Paola remained to take care\nof them. They were too old, and one was Rudy Bukovitz, a commander. The other one I\ndon\u2019t remember, he was not -- a-and they were stationed at the shipyard where my father\nwas working, you know, because they -- with the ships. And the -- and the shipyard was\nsupposed then to repair damaged ships which were coming 1-in port, Germans, si --\nItalian.",
        "Q: We\u2019re talking now April 1941, is that what you\u2019re thinking of?",
        "A: Ah, no, this 1s -- this was in \u00b043. With [indecipherable]. I mix up the dates because\nthey are difference -- different people, different stories, you see. This was in \u00b043 when\nthey came. And I know that, for instance, the [indecipherable] the tanks -- we were\nleaving in a very w-wide avenue, you know, and they were coming with the tanks and\nthey stopped under our building. And since they were living in what we call mezzanino,\nwhich is not really the first floor. Here 1s called first floor, but you have a few steps up\nand there\u2019s the doors, you know? And the Moscovitz\u2019 were li-living -- I mean, on the\nmezzanino, and the soldiers knocked at their door, asked for water, they gave them do --\nJanuary 20, 2004\nwater. Then they gave them breakfast and tha-that was it. The soldiers didn\u2019t even di --\nbother them at all, and -- and then they went away. Then finally Bukitz, they took this\napartment and the Moscovitz\u2019 went to Venice and then they were -- they went -- they\nwere -- they took refuge in the island of Saint George, San Giorgio is one of these\nislands around Venice. And there was a kind of a sanitarium or a fi -- a psychiatric thing,\nand -- and they hid there during all the period of the war. Well, if I have to continue about\nthe Moscovitz\u2019, then he died, and then I saw Mrs. Moscovitz when she went to Milan, a-\nafter the war sh-she was there. An-And -- and I think that there she was f -- living in\nMilan, and across her apartment, there was an apartment where there was a couple, I\ndon\u2019t remember the name because I met them only that time, a young couple whose\nhusband of the man and wife -- the wife of the man and the husband of the young woman\ndied in concentration camp. They met in concentration camp, they got married and they\nhad a little daughter. And I was there just for Passover. I didn\u2019t know what was Passover.\nAnd so I invite -- I was sleeping at Mrs. Moscovitz, so we went for -- for the passo -- the\nne -- we were the five of us, it was my first Passover, you know? And they did explain to\nme, and this little girl, she said di -- when she had to tell the story of Passover, she said\nand then the carabinieri came. The ca -- the carabinieri with the [indecipherable] you\nknow. Think it was really cute. And -- and that was it. So -- but then I didn\u2019t see Mrs.\nMoscovitz any more again. I heard that she died. These are the Moscovitz\u2019. The Weiss, I\ndon\u2019t know at -- what happened to them. Then I -- we had very close friends, this was a --\nJanuary 20, 2004\noh, a -- let\u2019s so -- go to the -- the important ones, the -- the Schtitzel. After the anschluss,\nthis family arrives from Vienna. Arnold, Nellie and Anton Schtitzel.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Thea Sacca Rips. This is tape number one, side B, and you\nbegan -- you had begun to tell the story of this family.",
        "A: So they arrived, and they found an apartment. It was a beautiful apartment building\nnear the station an -- and the tennis courts. And there were only two apartments per\nbuilding -- per -- per floor. We were on the fifth floor.",
        "Q: And when was this?",
        "A: 19 -- after -- immediately after the anschluss, what was -- what year was --",
        "Q: So it was spring, 1938?",
        "A: 1938, yes. They arrived -- we were flabbergasted, because they were, all of them,\nabout two fee -- two -- two meter of tall -- one meter -- two meter tall. He was a very\nelegant gentleman, you know, very well dressed. She was a beautiful woman.",
        "Q: Wh-Where had they come from?",
        "A: From Vienna, as far as I remember, and then they had son, Anton, called Tondo in\n[indecipherable] he\u2019s always been Tondo. And I think that he was from very wealthy\nfamily in Vienna. I think that they were [indecipherable] special wines were --\nJanuary 20, 2004\nexpensive, gourmet food. As far as I think -- v-vaguely this -- I -- we never investigated\nwhat they were doing or something, and -- you know. And we started to talk, wi -- you\nknow, th-the balcony, which was giving on the tennis courts, it was the balcony of our\nkitchen, and by the balcony of their kitchen was just looking as -- an -- by us, to our\nbalcony. So we -- I was already -- well, in \u201938, I was already 16 year old\n[indecipherable] something, and my sister was 12. Tondo was the age of -- o-of my\nsister, and we started to talk [indecipherable] soon from the balcony and then we\nbecame friends, we were [indecipherable] with the parents, and then that was it. And\nthey were at four -- ended \u201843. We became very close. When, in \u201943, the Germans took\nover our area, after the armistice, immediately after September eight, we, at that time\nwere h-having our -- spending our vacation at the seashore in Lowranna, or Lovranna\nnow, in Notelle. And we\u2019ve, unfortunately saw them arriving, the soldiers, how would\nyou say? Making pee pee, you know, on the street, you know. Walking whi -- whi-while\nthey were walking, going like this. Then we her -- we heard shots. They shot a couple of\npartisans who were already ready there, and they didn\u2019t let anybody to go near them.\nThere was one in the orchard and we can -- nobody can go -- can go there to take care of\nthis person, and so on. And so, since we didn\u2019t feel safe in the hotel, there was -- there\nwere some Croatian friends who had a villa, which once belonged to one of the\narchdukes, because that area was very famous during the Austro-Hungarian empire. They\nwere keeping their -- their mistresses and they were spending their vacation there, and\nJanuary 20, 2004\nthis kind of thing. And we went to stay with them, eating only sardines and potatoes,\nokay, that was it. And the Schtitzel were also vacationing in the same place, and they got\nextremely scared, of course. And they -- they found a -- a f -- a fisherman, who took them\nby boat to Yugoslavia, to the -- to the Dalmatia actually, to the other coast. They were\nhoping to be able to reach, probably -- I don\u2019t know, southern Italy. And I remember that\nthey gave us a bag with the jewelry and -- and the -- and the key to the apartment. The\nonly thing she took with -- no -- they took the jewelry with them, giving a -- and -- and\nthey went there. Then they came back from Yugoslavia and they came to the apartment\nbecause they felt safe, an-and they were safe, nobody bothered them. But th-the -- we\nknow -- nobody knew for how long they would have been safe, so they wanted to go\naway. And they got in touch with the police commissioner, who probably is on the -- how\ndo you say, the roll of the just or whatever it is in Jerusalem, Panicucci was the -- the\ncommissioner. One was [indecipherable] the name, they made a sort of film about him.\nThe --",
        "Q: Schindler, you mean\u2019?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, the -- the commissioner, the -- th-they made a -- the documentary, that\n-- that 1t was even shown on th -- a couple of weeks ago in the Jewish thing. The last one\nwas about the one who was also killed afterwards, who gave her passports to the Jews,\nand so on, but Panicucci was --",
        "Q: Wallenberg -- Raoul Wallenberg?\nJanuary 20, 2004",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no. In Italian.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: And [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Per-Perlaska?",
        "A: Perlaska, Perlaska. They -- Panicucci was the Perlaska of our area. And so\napparently he gave them -- yeah, and he gave them papers with another name, Sardi, and\nth-the Franciscans father of the church of sa -- of San Geron -- Geronim -- Geronimo\u2019s\nchurch gave them birth certificates, Catholic [indecipherable]. But they fact is that 1-1n --\nin the -- between \u201938 to \u201943, Tondo became a big boy. They were -- in Fiume, everybody\nknew them because they were so visible, you know, tall, handsome, they see all\n[indecipherable] of them going, you know? So, they were -- th-they went to f -- they\nwent to flo -- to the -- they wanted to go to Venice, but how do we go to Venice?\nEverybody knows us, somebody meet you on the train, and if we have different\ndocuments, the Germans were going up and down the train. Okay, we -- Thea can take\nthe -- the -- the documents for you, but -- but you le -- so they left with the f-forged\ndocuments on the train, and on the same train, like an idiot, I was on the same train as\nthey were o-on with their real documents. So -- but we pretended not to know each other.\nI was sitting in one -- I -- I was sitting on one side, in one compartment, they were sitting\non the other. And then, you know, we were in different are -- Tondo and I went on the\ncorridor, we started to talk like two people who just meet, you know, it wa -- it was really\nJanuary 20, 2004\nsomething. They were no trouble. In the meantime we had told to my sist -- my aunt --\nmy mother\u2019s sister, who was living in Trieste, that they were coming, to please -- she s --\nsince she had the large apartment, not many beds, but a large apartment, an enormous\nliving room, dining room, larger than this one, to arrange for them to spend the night\nthere, because the next day they were going to -- to Venice. So when they arrived, we\nwent to the house of my aunt, she had arranged some mats on the floor an-and we slept\nthere. And the next day they went to Venice. Their new names were Sardi. They were no\nmore Schtitzel, they were Sardi, and they went to live for awhile in hotel. But, of course,\nVenice and Fiume are pretty close and they were afraid that some people from Fiume\nwould recognize them there, or [indecipherable]. And I remember that even I went once\nto visit with them -- o-or es -- yes, before leaving they gave us their jewelry, and there\nwas another family too, in Abbazia, where they left a trunk, where she left her fur coats.\nI don\u2019t know what was there because we never saw the trunk and we never saw that\nfamily. And I don\u2019t know if -- how the stuff she gave them left. We -- they left in the\napartment only some wine, some food that he had put aside, Mr. Schtitzel. But they gave\nus the jewelry, and she took only a beautiful diamond ring she had, she took with her.\nAnd they went to -- as I say, they went to Venice. I went to visit with them and by\nmistake I knocked at the door and I said, Mr. Schtitzel. The poor man was scared -- was\nscared to death, but I did -- you know, it win -- I-I -- without thinking. He was so scared.\nAnyhow, from there they moved to Milan where this engineer, Fierst, who was th --\nJanuary 20, 2004\nworking my -- with my father had found refuge in a -- in an apartment building in Milan,\nwhere many Jews were living we -- under ma -- different names, and they moved in\nthere. The portieri knew about them, everybody knew who they were, but nothing\nhappened. But the fact 1s that -- came that time that Tondo had the age to be called into\nthe army. And th -- Mr. Schtitzel, Arnold, got so scared that he -- I don\u2019t know through\nwhom, thi-this we heard later wa -- from -- from the sh -- from the Fierst who told them,\ndon\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that, they might not call him. Hide the boy, don\u2019t do it. Instead,\nno, no, no, no, we go to Switzerland, we go to Switzerland, we go to Switzerland. And\nthe guys who were supposed to take them across the border apparently betrayed them,\nand -- and that was it. For a long time we didn\u2019t hear anything. The war was over. Tito\noccupied our area. And one day a nice gentleman knocks at our door. And he says, I am\nso and so and so. I am the head of the Jewish community here in Fiume. I know that you\nhelped the -- the Schtitzels and that the Schtitzels gave you some jewelry, so on. Oh,\nsays, thank goodness. So we gave to him -- he -- of course he -- he demonstrated\n[indecipherable] and we gave the jewels to him a-and then we didn\u2019t hear from him any\nmore, but I\u2019m -- it -- I\u2019m sure -- how -- how else could he know if -- if they had not told\nhim? We trusted him immediately and we gave him back the jewels. She had -- she had\nhidden her diamond in her rectum when she was traveling and of course they found it,\nyou know, because there -- they were examining a-absolutely everything. And so -- and\nJanuary 20, 2004\nthis man told us that Tondo and her -- and the father died in Auschwitz and, which 1s\neven more terrible, Nellie, the mother, was sick and she was killed by the dogs.",
        "Q: Oh, no. Hm.",
        "A: They were chasing after her and they -- and she died like this. In the meantime, they\nhad left with us the address of her brother, who was living in New York, Otto Weiss.\nAnd I started to correspond -- as soon as I heard this, I wrote to him also, telling him\nabout the jewels and telling him about the few things that they left with us, a -- a -- a\nsilver box, because Mr. Schtitzel, during the first World Wars, was a officer in the\nAustrian army. And the box he left with us was a box that he received from his\ncompanions, I don\u2019t know in what occasion, with all the signatures of his companions.\nAnd we have a photograph of the group of Austrian officers, and he is there, you see? It\nwas -- it -- and so I wrote to Uncle Otto in English, with my poor English, but I managed.\nNo, I -- Ia -- at the time I was speaking some German, I don\u2019t know whether it was\nGerman or English, I mixed up things. I still have the correspondence, it\u2019s home. And so\nhe said well, that to give certain things to -- to -- to I don\u2019t know who it was, and to keep\nthe rest for us, it was a -- the -- th-the -- took the [indecipherable]. And -- and that was\nit. And that was the end o-o-of the Schtitzel. And to us it was just like losing family, and\n-- and to hear that they went like that was really terrible. I kept corresponding with Uncle\nOtto, who was sending us care packages, because under Tito it was much worse than\nduring the war. That was the worst part of -- for us, because Fiume was bombed only by\nJanuary 20, 2004\n-- by the -- but when the British were bombing, where they were coming only with the s -\n- small planes, with the Sp-Spitfires, you know, and they were -- since all the -- th-the --\nthe big industries were along the coast, they were not touching the city. They were going\nba -- th -- shooting at whatever the equipment they had there. But th-then the -- the\nAmericans came and then they bombed also the city, so much so that where we were --\nno, we had shelters since there is the mountain behind th -- we are on the ocean and -- th-\nthe sea and the mountain and the shelters were under the mountain. And when the\nGermans were there, in the -- in the -- a-and they occupied the shipyard, part of the he --\nlighter works were hidden under the rocks under the mountains and so that -- and also,\nnear our home there was a shelter under th-the hills, so that we were safe in there. And\nduring that time, they were recruiting the Germ -- the Germans -- this 1s -- this has\nnothing to -- the Schtitzel were already away, but at that time, yes, we were still -- there\nwere still Jews, men -- several Jews in Fiume. Among them were the two Farcas brother,\nRudy and -- Rudy and Paolo. Rudy was the youngest one, a little bit light-headed,\nsimple, very, very pleasant boy. And Paolo, who was helping my sister with her Latin,\nyou know. And the ta -- the time came that -- when th-the -- the Germans started to\nrecruit the young people to work -- the famous [indecipherable] organization, you know,\nto build a -- fortresses to -- to -- to build for them things all along the border because we\nwere right on the border with the Yugoslavs, you know? And we were saying, Paolo and\nRudy, Paolo, go away, go away, go away. Why do you stay here, why do you stay here?\nJanuary 20, 2004\nAnd they said no, but there is no, we are working there, they are kind to us, they are nice.\nWe are not only Jews there, they were recruiting everybody, you know. And he said, no,\nno, he said, we stay. Then one day they took away their parents, and they said co -- and\nthey took them to Trieste, to the only concentration camp that th-the Germans made in\nTrieste, the famous rice factory, you know, the risia -- Risiera where they -- well, they di\n-- | don\u2019t know wha-what they did to them, they burned them or the wa -- I had -- I had\nno idea what -- what was going on. The Risiera now is the national monument in tr -- in\nTrieste, you know. A me-me -- a memorial. And we were telling them, go away, go\naway. No, no, no. When, after the parents were sent we\u2019d say, but now you better go. No,\nno, no, no, no, no, no. In the meantime also, my sister and myself were recruited and my\nsister became a welder. Be si -- since Father was working at the shipyard, he immediately\nput them to work there. I was studying to be a doctor, so I was in the infirmary, and I was\nthere helping the doctor, giving injections for -- for all kind of people, you know? And\nmy sister was a welder for the ships, you know? And -- and the funny thing 1s that they\nwere repairing the -- one of the -- I think 1t was a cruiser, I don\u2019t rem -- I don\u2019t know the\nname, the American names of the ships, but anyhow, which had been damaged, and the\nwork was not -- never proceeding because the workers were working and undoing. Doing\nand undoing so that the Germans couldn\u2019t get it, you know? But finally they had to do it,\nand they -- because the Germans started to -- so, it was completed, and they went\n[indecipherable] to test, they were only -- but they were only the workers, Italian, that\nJanuary 20, 2004\nthey f -- workers. My father was on board, everybody. They went to sea, they tested, they\ncame back, everything was perfect. The first time that the Germans went at sea with the\n[indecipherable] with the cruiser or whatever name it 1s, all at once we were standing on\n-- in -- looking at the -- at that ship, because working there both of us, we were there at\nthe shipyard with Father. All at once from -- 1t was a sky like this one with broken clouds\nand sun, out of the clouds, Spitsfires started to comes. They knew that there were only\nGermans on board, so there must have been, you know, something. And vroom, vroom,\nvroom, vroom, they came back to the shipyard, you know, with wounded people and so\nand so. That was it. Then they bombed of course the -- the -- the -- the shipyard, the\nAmericans who were in there. We were able to go underground, in -- under the -- th-the\nrocks. Then, when the bombardment was over, they brought some soldiers which were --\nhad been there [indecipherable] the German soldiers, I remember I had to give\nmorphium to whoever there was very heavily wounded, the -- he broke a -- he lost a leg,\nbut I remember he was there. We were -- we were two -- there were the -- the -- the -- the\nreal nurse, then -- it was a man, the doctor and myself, and we had really to work, you\nknow, [indecipherable] morphium Schwester, morphium Schwester, because he was\nin terrible pain. His hand was completely open, like this, you know. I gave him\nmorphium and then they took him to the hospital. I heard that day he lost a leg, this\nsoldier. And so the Farcas brothers were still there and one morning, it was a Sunday, we\nwake up and we could see the synagogue from our building, because it was very opened,\nJanuary 20, 2004\nand we see f-fire. We said, God gracious, that\u2019s the synagogue. So my sister and I got\ndressed. Father and Mother didn\u2019t even dream to say no, don\u2019t go. It was naturally for us,\nwe all -- we went to there and the fra -- th-the -- the synagogue was as fa -- afire. And\nthere he -- who was, Paolo and Rudy Farcas, who said, go away, go away. He says to\n[indecipherable] if the Germans see that you are with us, he said, you are in danger, go\naway. We said my -- no, don\u2019t -- when -- we didn\u2019t go away. We were there crying,\ncrying, crying. You should have seen that synagogue, it was so beautiful. And -- but we\nse -- an-and they didn\u2019t let the firemen to go and take care of the fire. It was a terrible\nday. It was in \u201943 when they burned th-the synagogue, those [indecipherable] th-th-the --\nthe [indecipherable]. And that was it. And of course, after awhile Rudy and Farcas\n[indecipherable] Rudy an-and -- and -- and -- and Paolo didn\u2019t appear any more. They\nwere taken and we don\u2019t know how -- what, we don\u2019t know. We can imagine how they\nend up. So that [indecipherable]. I think that\u2019s as far as our experience with\n[indecipherable]. That\u2019s all that I can remember.",
        "Q: When you were on the train carrying those false papers for -- I mean, carrying the true\npapers --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- were da -- were you questioned at all? Were there any -- wa-was there any incident\nwhere you had to make up a story?\nJanuary 20, 2004",
        "A: No. No. There were -- I was a -- I were just a passenger, period. I -- [indecipherable]\nand I was afra -- I was not afraid, I was not worried. My parents sent me like nothing, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- we didn\u2019t think of the danger, actually. I don\u2019t know why, because we were\nreally -- it -- it was n -- to -- to us it was normal to -- to -- to do that, you know. That was\nit. A-And also for my aunt to give them refuge there for -- that night and -- and also the\npeople in -- in -- 1-1-in Milan, if Arnold wouldn\u2019t have been so afraid for -- for -- for his\nson, probably nothing would have happened, because Fierst came back, went to work in\nGenoa after the war, and, you know.",
        "Q: The fi -- the first names of the Schtikless parents was Arnold --",
        "A: Arnold, and she was Nellie Weiss, Nellie Weiss. But they -- they were adorable\npeople, so nice, so nice. And when I came here, I tried to get in touch with Otto Weiss\nand I was not able to find it. Maybe either he had died, or the company was no more\nthere, or something. But I have the correspondence with Uncle Otto and he actually -- his\nis the one who told -- who wrote to me that he had -- tha-that Nellie was killed that\nhorrible way, you know.",
        "Q: When the synagogue was burning, what about the rest of the people in the town, or\nother people, were they horrified?",
        "A: The -- the people were really hor-horrified -- horrified, but you know, probably there\nwere some fanatics who were really happy, you know, like always, but no, the people\nwere really -- I tell you, until -- it was until \u00b043 that -- that they were living peacefully.\nJanuary 20, 2004\nThen we did -- then the Germans came, then there was the -- of course, the ones who\nwere just accusing people for -- for re-revenge, which happened also when Tito took\nover, they had just to say, well, that was a fascist, even if he had not been ever, he said,\nand they killed several people of ours, and -- with nothing to do. It wa -- under Tito it\nwas terrible. But under Tito I was a -- I left in December to stay with fr -- just to pass --\nspend Christmas with a friend in Valdosta for -- to go skiing and then they arrested th-\nthey -- th-they -- they -- wa -- we call them Titini. The partisans arrested my father as an\nenemy of the people, you know, because then it stopped to be something like a war, it\nwas a -- the Slavs against the Italians. And they arrested everybody who was somebody.\nThe owner of all the bus lines which were going from Fiume to Trieste in the area, the\ndirector of the for -- torpedo plant. Everybody who was somebody. For awhile they were\nin -- in jail all together, and for awhile they had their -- they were very worried,\nespecially for my father because my father, being an engineer, a technician, they were\nlacking personnel but it -- in that -- in -- in that field. We were afraid the -- because some\nwere sent inside Yugoslavia to -- to work there for them. And instead there were some\nworkers who accused Father of mistreatment. Father was a -- a rabbit like I am. Very\ngood on his job, but not -- not a courageous person in the sense that -- courageous, yes he\nwas, but not -- not to beat people or do these things of this kind, but you always find one\nwho was for one reason or another. And then he was for one month in isolation, and --\nand that broke my father. My father had never been the same, and if -- 1t ended --\nJanuary 20, 2004\nfortunately it ended peacefully in, you know, his own bed without ever being sick, but he\nwas a depressed person for an 0 -- when he came I -- 1-in the meantime, I wanted to go\nback to Fiume because before going, they came to have us opting to be Yugoslav or\nItalian. Of course, we all opted to be Italian, to go back to Italy, [indecipherable]. And --\nand I fr -- heard that my father was in prison by some university companions who were\nalso from Fiume, who came to meet me at the station and they said, oh you know, your\nfather 1s in jail in Fiume. That was the way I heard it. So I wanted to run to -- to Fiume.\nAnd I got, with great difficulty, in touch with my family and they told me, please don\u2019t\ncome because otherwise they catch you too, because you were [indecipherable] when\nyou -- okay. So I started to work. I -- I -- at the time I was studying and then I had to start\nto work, that\u2019s why I -- I am not a doctor, because I couldn\u2019t work and so on. Th-The iron\nfist, the British troops who had been stationed in -- in Naples, opened a garrison in\nPadwa and they hire me -- my English was just school English, poor, but 1t was better\nthan nothing. At the time nobody was speaking English, so whatever I spoke was pretty --\nit was better than nothing, you know? And I si --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nJanuary 20, 2004\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Thea Rips. This is tape number two, side A, and let\u2019s just talk a\nlittle bit about the end of the war before we continue on with your story. What was that\nlike for you?",
        "A: Well, the -- as I said, I was working as a nurse in the shipyards, and my sister was a\nwelder, but for -- at the time she stopped working as a welder because she had typhoid\nfever, something like this. She was in the hospital. And when the end was coming, it was\nthe beginning of May, the Yugoslav were bombing with ca -- with ca-cannons, grenades,\nFiume. And in order to be safer, they had -- they -- the engineers had the -- the shifts to\nspend the nights in the shipyard, to keep an eye on whatever was going on, you know?\nAnd | as a nurse, was staying with Father and we were sleeping underground in the\nshelter, under the rocks. It was a very safe shelter, I must say because when they bombed,\nnothing happened to us. They destroyed a lot of things, but the bomb didn\u2019t bother us.\nAnd, in parentheses, my fat -- my father was made th-the head of -- chief of the oompah,\nwhich I don\u2019t remember right now what it means, but it was a -- a -- a group which was\ntaking care of -- in case of a fire -- so-some -- some kind of a fireman, in case of\nbombings and things of this kind. And he and his workers -- how -- how can I say? The\nGermans had put dynamite under all the cranes of the shipyard, because before leaving\nthey wanted to destroy the shipyards. Father and his men of the oompah, I don\u2019t know\nJanuary 20, 2004\nwhen, I don\u2019t know now because he didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t talk about these things, took off\nth -- everything, so that nothing blew up, you know, never s -- never tol -- never\nrecognized because it was an a -- again, a natural thing to do. So th -- he saved the\nshipyard. Never recognized, never got a penny for it, but who wanted it anyhow? So\nanyhow, when they started to bomb th-th-the -- the bombs started to come from the\nYugoslav side and the Yugoslavs were advancing, the partisans and so on, the Germans\nstarted to flee. And it was a heavy bombardment. So we fa -- they said -- Father called the\ndi-director, he said -- th-the -- of the -- of the shipyard, what do I do? He said, here I have\na few men, and do I -- he said, do what you want. Washed their hands. You -- you -- you\ndecide, you do what you want, he said, because I cannot leave here, nobody want -- you\ncan leave because anyhow that is -- so -- so we -- we left and we went walking and it was\nquite the walk, you just -- like going from here, more than down, going to -- from here to\nBethesda, something like this. And we -- we heard the grenades, fssh, pssh, falling\naround us. And I kept the white cas -- boar -- rope, you know, was a [indecipherable] on\nthe street, you know. But do you think that the Germans bothered t-to bother us? They\nwere running. They were passing by us, going, running, scup -- escaping, escaping. And -\n- and then we went -- we went home. And when we reached home, since it was in a\ndangerous positions, we went to stay with a family, some friends of ours for a --for a few\ndays. Then we went back home and -- and 1t was May -- must have been the third or\nfourth, because Tito\u2019s birthday, I think, is on the -- I have to look in my book, but was in\nJanuary 20, 2004\non the fifth or the sixth of May, when they started to shoot like crazy, pom, pom, pom,\npom, pom to -- to celebrate, you know? And ye -- we could see, since we are in this wide\navenue, you know, living, it was just like going through a dead city, you know, all the\nshutters were down. We were looking through the shutters and they were coming with\nthese carts, with the car -- with the -- how do you say, the animals, the [indecipherable]\nthe warri -- [phone ringing] -- sorry. [tape break]. So th-th-this was all the shutters\ndown and they came wi -- on the carts, pulled by the oxen, and that -- a thing which was\nunbelievable, and they di -- and you could see these people sitting la -- you know, th-the\npoor -- I understand they -- they were poor people who lived in the woods, these\npartisans, but they were really mean. And they were s-standing on the streets and dancing\nthe kolo. And th-the ones from Montenegro, th -- with the sh -- sheepco -- sheepskin\ncoats over there ki-killing lice, you know. It was terrible. And that was the time when we\nwere afraid to talk, when we couldn\u2019t even talk to friends because we didn\u2019t know what\nwe're going to do, we -- what they were going to say or something. These people di --\nwent in -- they enter some apartment, they didn\u2019t understand what they\u2019re -- they didn\u2019t\nknow how to use th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the facilities. They were looking\nat the chandeliers, you know, all this light coming from. It was really a [indecipherable]\naffair. And that was it. So then they came, they wanted us to [indecipherable] as I said,\nand -- and then I, as I said, I went to -- first to F-Florence just for a visit. I came back to\nit -- to -- to Fiume, then I went to Valdosta and when I went to Padwa they told me not\nJanuary 20, 2004\nto go back to Fiume. I started to work with the British troops, [indecipherable] head-\nheadquarters Padwa garrison. I worked for there for awhile, taking care of the wives of\nthe English soldiers, Italian wi -- and they picked up some very good kids, but they\npicked up a lot of trash too, you know? And -- and after -- and I was there until \u201948.\nWhen my father came out th -- my -- finally my father was freed because the judge of this\ntribunal of the people w-was -- had been friendly with the Jews too, and he knew about\nour friendships or something, I don\u2019t know how. And I f -- with the excuse that Father\nhad arthritis, one thing and the other, they said no, no, no, he has to go -- he has to go to\nAbbano, which 1s a spa, and Father came out, but th-that man on the street didn\u2019t want to\ntalk. My f -- my father didn\u2019t want to talk. He was turning always his head, he -- no, no,\nno, th-they are following me, they -- they\u2019re -- that was -- Father was ruined, that was it.\nAnd fr -- then in \u201948 he didn\u2019t want to stay in -- in -- he finally found a job down south in\n-- near Foja, in Napolia, that he worked for awhile, and I worked too. I went to teach at\nthe Boys Town in Bari. And in Boys Town in our Bari came an American gentleman,\nMr. Broya to visit this place.

And not because I have ha -- because I -- I know that we are\nfundamentally we are Jews, nothing doing, you know. No, we are Jews. Nothing doing in\ntha -- we\u2019re -- we -- well, we just accept one thing that you didn\u2019t accept, period, but we\nare the same, absolutely. So I was not able to do it, I -- I could not. Not that my parents\nobjected, not at all. My father said, do what you want, you -- you do f -- what you feel\nlike doing. But I didn\u2019t feel like doing it. Then, for -- but I was always going -- my\nhusband was not very observant. We were more observant when we were more with the -\n- with the Korns, you know, and we were going to their house, then we were going to the\nsynagogue. There was a time of -- o-of Rabinovitz, we loved his sermons, we became\nvery good friends, so it -- it was a -- and I went to all the festivities, I enjoyed them very\nmuch, I followed and so on. And sometimes Serge came to -- but I didn\u2019t go to church. I\ndidn\u2019t go. Well, you know, the -- Serge di-didn\u2019t like it, so I didn\u2019t go. Then -- then for a\ncouple of su -- we were -- w-we spent a couple of Christmases [indecipherable]\nCatholic, just let\u2019s go to meet -- went to meet [indecipherable] so we are going to meet\nJanuary 20, 2004\n[indecipherable] an-and a -- and Serge was coming. Then, t-towards the end, th-the feel\n-- the last few years at Easter, Serge was saying, hey, we -- y-you -- this 1s Easter. We --\nyou have to go to chur -- we were -- he was going to church with me, you see? So that\nwas a -- the kind of a di -- di -- mix up. And if you look at my -- 1t was -- we were\nlaughing yesterday with some people, because I have a-an in -- an image of the Virgin\nand on top of the bed I have David with the head of Goliath.

        "Answer: Thea Marguerita Valeria Sacca Rips.",
        "A: I was born in Trieste on February 24, 1922.",
        "A: Here in the United States, you mean?",
        "A: Well, in Trieste from \u201922 to \u201927, because my father was working -- he was an\nengineer, electrical engineer, and he was working with the shipyards in Monfalcone. And\nwhen it were -- he was transfers to Fiume, which now 1s Rijeka. We moved to Fiume\nwhen I was about five years old. And we lived in Fiume until 1945, until the end of the\nwar. And Father worked there, he was a chief -- he was the director of the electrical\ndepartment of the shipyard. Can-Cantieri Navale del Quarnaro, where they were\nbuilding all kind of ships, from submarines, even to the yacht for Mussolini they built,\nwhich was never delivered. And he was in charge of -- not only of the projects for the\nelectrical equipment on the ships, but also of the -- care of the cranes and all the electrical\nequipment of the shipyard itself. And practically I was born with fascism, grew under\nJanuary 20, 2004\nfascism, without realizing -- it wa -- it w -- 1t was normal for -- for s -- my life. And we\nwent to school. Then they came when -- when we went to school. Of course, we were all\nsupposed to be piccolo Italiani, small, little Italians, because otherwise the schools --\napparently we were not able to go to school, as far as I know. I never realized that, of\ncourse. And I went through the whole system until I finished the -- what we call senior\nhigh school. Actually it is the Liceo Scientifico, Scientific Lyceum, which is practically\ncomparable to the -- to here -- even though it was only four year. Four year of junior high\nand four years of senior high. The junior high I went to the technical institute. The senior\nhigh I went to the Liceo Scientifico. But as far as education, they told me it\u2019s\ncomparable, when you finish Liceo Scientific -- Scientifico, excuse me, like two years of\ncollege in this country, because we had very thorough, you know, the education in\nEurope. And that\u2019s it. My father continued to work. H-He was never a -- a -- a carda -- a\ncard holding fascist. He became -- he had to become or -- or -- a member of the fascist\nparty in 1942, because otherwise he would have lost his job and h-he had responsibilities\n[indecipherable]. He had trouble because he didn\u2019t want to wear the uniform, and he\nnever had a uniform and he never wore the black tie -- the -- the black shirt. But you\nknow, they were, with the exceptions of few fanat -- a few -- several fanatics, the\npopulation was a strange population in Fiume because they were open-minded on one\nside and fascist on the other side because after the first World War, Fiume was next to\nItaly only in 1924, after the famous DiNunzio coup. Apparently th-the Italians didn\u2019t\nJanuary 20, 2004\nwant them, but they felt and they are still feel f -- extremely Italian, even though the\npopulation was mixed and the ch -- the city was occupied by everybody, from the\nEspaniards to the st -- Napoleon, th-the Venetians. It started as an Roman colony and --\nbut they were always, who knows why, very deeply, they felt deeply Italian. And so\nthat\u2019s why they accepted DiNunzio. So DiNunzio and Mussolini, even though they\ndidn\u2019t like each other very, very much, I must say -- for awhile they did, but then -- you\nsee, they connected their fact that they were -- that they could join the Italian, they were\nadmitted to be Italians betwe -- to DiNunzio and to Mussolini. So they felt in that fak --\nka -- in that sense they felt that they were fascists. Fascists because th -- fascism\npermitted them to be Italians, you know? The city was [indecipherable] after. And that\u2019s\nit. I tell you also another thing, that this city which was extremely wealthy, small city, we\nended up with 45,000 people, but we were much smaller when I was little, had many\nplans, many industries. It had the torpedo plant, it had th-the shipyards, it had the oil\nrefinery. It had heavy machinery plant, it had mills, and it -- ab-absolutely everything,\nand the population, the workers were very well off. They had nice houses, we were going\nskiing together at the engineers -- th-th-th-the director, with the son of th-the -- th-th-th-\nth-the -- of -- of everybody. We were really a str -- strong community. We were playing\ntennis together with the children of the workers and so on. So much so that we had a\nlimited number of poor, who were known all by name, you see. And there was a very\nimportant Jewish community, Ashkenazi, coming from the east, from the Balkans, from\nJanuary 20, 2004\nGermany. | don\u2019t think there was a single Sephardic Jew, as far as I can remember. And\nwe had in Villa Firenze where we lived, among the other places, just across of it, a\nbeautiful, beautiful, three domed synagogue with the cupolas covered with copper tiles. It\nwas really beautiful. And living across the street from them, you see -- we were always\nsaying, oh, d -- you know, they were th-the -- the real Orthodox Jews, the one with the\ncurls and the -- and the fur k -- and the hats with the fur around it, you see. And we were\ns -- and -- and they were telling us, you know -- we were children, we were -- we were\nactually not so much children al-already, they were saying, oh well we cou -- we cannot\ngo in there, we cannot go in there, because you know, we -- they don\u2019t allow us to go\nthere and who knows what\u2019s going on there? But I never heard about -- people talking\nabout blood sacrifices or things like this because they were -- we were so interwined that\neven then there were not many, but there were several mixed marriages at the time. And\nin my case, for instance, I found -- I found out that some of my schoolmates in -- in\nschool were Jewish because they were allowed, on the Sabbath -- because at the time we\nwere going to school also on s -- on Saturday -- on the Sabbath they were not going to\nschool, but they were justified. They were allowed not to come, because until the racial\nlaws were applied, unfortunately, there was no problem. And -- and -- and -- and we were\ngoing -- Jewish kids and non-Jewish kids and Protestant kids, we were all together, we\ncouldn\u2019t care less about religion, o-or wherever they were coming from. And that was it.\nSo, what did I say? And I remember, of all these other people, there was a -- a v -- a very\nJanuary 20, 2004\ninteresting man, a -- a Jew, Mr. Tannenbaum, ma -- mister -- well fa -- probably Mr.\nTannenbaum, for us he\u2019s -- it looked like -- like a -- like a priest or something, because\n[indecipherable] we know, with the black caftan and the hat with the fur around. He was\nthe sweetest man in the world. My father knew him well. He didn\u2019t come to our house\noften, but he was going around the house of people he knew, he was friendly. He was\ncollecting money for charities. But charities not for the Jewish population, for everybody\nwho was born in town. He was well known for that. Then, of course, he disappeared. Life\nwas very comfortable in Fiume, very comfortable. Every year we were going to a\n[speaks Italian here]. And th-there I met a-another group of -- I had this group of Jewish\nfriends tha -- the Lagers, Bondy and Kathy Lager, his bra -- his cousin, and we were all\nhaving fun going to the ocean together [indecipherable] this or that. And I remember\nthey were already on guard in the sense that while we kind of ignored the musics from\nAmerica, jazz, the [indecipherable] they already heard, may-maybe because they had\nrelatives here or something, I don\u2019t know for sure. But anyhow, they were bringing this\nmusic and we learned jazz through these Jewish friends of ours, you know. They were\nreally fantastic. I remember that Bondy Lager was very much in love with me. An-And I\nmet Bondy when I first came here in \u201955, and he was married to an Austrian girl --\nJewish girl, and he had a child. And we met in -- in New York where he had a plant or --\nor -- or a store -- 0-of t-toys for -- and it -- 1t was very emotional, you know. After so\nmany years, you know I call, who\u2019s there? He says, B-Bondy\u2019s there. Also because when\nJanuary 20, 2004\nBondy escaped from Fiume in -- just as -- with the last boat which left Naple, it must\nhave been 1940, his parents remained in Fiume. They were merchants and they had a\ndeposit with they had all kind of food, the potatoes, all kind of thing. Th-The parents\nremained in Fiume, but Bondy and his sister came to the States. And they left from\nNaples. And when they left Fiume by train to go to Naples, my sister and myself went to\nthe train to say goodbye. And the funny thing 1s that since at that time I was young and I\nhad many boys at the same time growing around me, my sister was saying, you know, yi\n-- there 1s like a -- like a-a -- a torta, a -- a cake. All the flies go to hel -- you know? So\nthat when Bondy was writing to me, he was saying lot of love to the torta, you know\n[indecipherable]. Well, that was the story of Bondy. His -- his cousin went to Milan, h-\nhe\u2019s -- hid in Milan, the -- Lazi, because they were of Hungarian descent, that Lazi --\nLadizlow, and -- and he was all right. Then what happened with this? The anschluss,\nyes, there\u2019s -- now we come to the real s -- thing, which is important.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My sister name 1s Laura and she is five years younger than I am. And f -- wh-while\nwe were in Fiume, more or less we shared our life, but being five years younger, you\nknow, she had -- at that moment she had her group and I had my group. We were always\ntogether because we were hikers and skiers and we were going every f -- every weekend -\nJanuary 20, 2004\n- weekend -- every Sunday of every festivity. We -- Father introduced us to the love of\nnature and -- a-an-and -- and mountains and thing. We were going skiing or hiking. And\nshe was very funny, they loved her very much, so much so that when I f-finished the -- ha\n-- the Lyceum, the senior high and there was the party, she was invited too, because she\nwas so funny, and sh -- and so agile that she was making herself a ball, and they were\nthrowing her like one. It was -- she -- she\u2019s still a funny character, I must say.\nUnfortunately she cannot be a ball any more, but she 1s still go to the -- to the gym.",
        "A: My father is Giorgio and my mother was Emma Pacore. Because my father parents\nwere -- are -- well, my gr-grandmother from my father\u2019s side was born in Courtsela, and\nmy grandfather was born in Montenegro, in Corta, but they lived always in Trieste. My\ngrandfather was a purser or [indecipherable] there 1s a special name, it\u2019s [speaks\nItalian] which is the assistant purser, but one who 1s in charge of buying all the material\nf-f-food, everything for the ships, for the liners of the Austrian Lloyd, which later on\nbecame Lloyd Adriatico. No, first I think it was Lloyd Triestino, and then Lloyd\nAdriatico. And he traveled a lot to the Orient, so much so that the house of my\ngrandparents had a lot of Oriental stuff, which like stupid we broke, and not only if we\nhad not broken, we had to leave there when we escaped as refugees, so it was all lost.\nAnd my -- and his mother -- I -- we -- I have the documents, but I don\u2019t remember -- I\ndon\u2019t know where she was born, but she was Italian speaking and German speaking, and\nJanuary 20, 2004\nshe had three sons. My grandfather was the youngest one, and when her husband died --\nand I don\u2019t know what her husband did, which I think he was making bottles, wine\nbottles. He had the plant where he was making wine bottles. And she was a -- she didn\u2019t\nfinish school. When my grandfather -- great grandfather died, on my father\u2019s side, she c -\n- finished her school, she became a teacher, and I still have the documents where she\nwrites to the Austrian, to Vienna, to have the permission to teach in a school for girls,\nyou know? But everything written in Italia. When Mussolini, as soon as he took over,\nforbade the people of our area -- we\u2019re in -- th-the interland of Fiume was Slav, Croatian\nand [indecipherable] Trieste Slav, Slovenian, he forbade them to use their language, he\nmade them change their names, and he was stupid, while Franz Josef was smart enough\nto let each -- each nationality to use their own language and si -- that\u2019s why we lost that,\nkind of, because if he had been more intelligent, I will speak Croatian, which I love, and -\n- and they wouldn\u2019t ha -- we -- we wouldn\u2019t have made enemies. Instead, they were\nenemies. Of course, they forced to -- to -- to use a language -- the old people wer -- never\ncould speak Italian, so --",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable] yes, it\u2019s right, you know, with the eastern peninsula on one side,\nyou know, there 1s like a triangle. There is Trieste. Then, at the tip of the triangle is\nPaola, or Pula as they call it now, and then it\u2019s Fiume on the other side that -- of -- and\nJanuary 20, 2004\nwe -- now it\u2019s called Rijeka, which means Fiume too, beca -- also in Russia, Rijeka is --\nRijeka is Fiume.

Now I remember, now I start to -- to\ngive importance to the facts, you know, but I went through the war in -- Spanish war,\nwhen -- when we had the Franco, that was a very good chance to go and take a day\nvacation because we were going demonstrating against this, or -- or when the\n[indecipherable] to go demonstrate on the British consulate. You know, it was -- in the\nmeantime we didn\u2019t know -- we\u2019re not going to school. We didn't even know what we are\ndoing, it was just having fun, you know. And as our famous journalist Indro Montanelli,\nwho is now -- now dead [indecipherable] said, you know, who cared about fascism or\nJanuary 20, 2004\nanything until things happened? We were young.

Then there was the fa -- the\nWeiss family, Jewish. The daughter married a Catholic boy, a -- the brother of a friend of\nJanuary 20, 2004\nmine. She was studying piano, she was playing beautifully. On the groun -- on the first\nfloor was living -- were living the Moscovitz. The Moscovitz had a beautiful -- kind of\nhardware store, but they were selling toys and everything. And every Christmas\n[indecipherable] it was a two story thing, you know, and it was on the wa -- in the -- o-\non one of the main s-squares of Fiume, and they had on that -- on the second floor, an\nenormous window and there was appearing a Santa Claus, and showing -- and -- and the\nchildren, we were all on the street, you know, watching what was going on, and -- and he\nwas showing the [indecipherable] and the children, to me, to me, to me, to me, you\nknow, and these were the Moscovitz\u2019, you know? And they were very nice. She was a\nvery lovely little girl -- little woman, bu-but -- but he was even funnier because he was\nvery, very short and very, very, very prim all the time, you know? But wonderful people,\nand they all had the mezuzah, th-the mezuzah on the their door, so what? You know,\nthey [indecipherable]",
        "A: Until \u201943, no, they were not very -- they -- they didn\u2019t like the idea. Many were smart\nenough, many -- I don\u2019t know how many p -- but several left. But these friends, close\nfriends of ours who were living in the same building, they didn\u2019t. Then the -- the Weiss\nleft first. Then the Moscovitz left. They had a maid, the Moscovitz, Paula -- Paola,\nCatholic. And when they left, they left the apartment, they were in the way it was. But\nJanuary 20, 2004\neven -- yes, there it was with the mezuzah on the door. They only gave us to save, to put\naside for them, an enormous portrait, natural size, of Mr. Moscovitz, which we hid\nbehind a -- a -- an armoire we had, you know\u201d? [indecipherable] okay. And when the\nGermans came th-there, that apartment, th-the maid was there -- oh sorry -- that the maid\nwas there, and they occupied the apartment of the Moscovitz. They saw the mezuzah,\nthey could even -- they couldn\u2019t care less. They were there, Paola remained to take care\nof them. They were too old, and one was Rudy Bukovitz, a commander. The other one I\ndon\u2019t remember, he was not -- a-and they were stationed at the shipyard where my father\nwas working, you know, because they -- with the ships. And the -- and the shipyard was\nsupposed then to repair damaged ships which were coming 1-in port, Germans, si --\nItalian.",
        "A: Ah, no, this 1s -- this was in \u00b043. With [indecipherable]. I mix up the dates because\nthey are difference -- different people, different stories, you see. This was in \u00b043 when\nthey came. And I know that, for instance, the [indecipherable] the tanks -- we were\nleaving in a very w-wide avenue, you know, and they were coming with the tanks and\nthey stopped under our building. And since they were living in what we call mezzanino,\nwhich is not really the first floor. Here 1s called first floor, but you have a few steps up\nand there\u2019s the doors, you know? And the Moscovitz\u2019 were li-living -- I mean, on the\nmezzanino, and the soldiers knocked at their door, asked for water, they gave them do --\nJanuary 20, 2004\nwater. Then they gave them breakfast and tha-that was it. The soldiers didn\u2019t even di --\nbother them at all, and -- and then they went away. Then finally Bukitz, they took this\napartment and the Moscovitz\u2019 went to Venice and then they were -- they went -- they\nwere -- they took refuge in the island of Saint George, San Giorgio is one of these\nislands around Venice. And there was a kind of a sanitarium or a fi -- a psychiatric thing,\nand -- and they hid there during all the period of the war. Well, if I have to continue about\nthe Moscovitz\u2019, then he died, and then I saw Mrs. Moscovitz when she went to Milan, a-\nafter the war sh-she was there. An-And -- and I think that there she was f -- living in\nMilan, and across her apartment, there was an apartment where there was a couple, I\ndon\u2019t remember the name because I met them only that time, a young couple whose\nhusband of the man and wife -- the wife of the man and the husband of the young woman\ndied in concentration camp. They met in concentration camp, they got married and they\nhad a little daughter. And I was there just for Passover. I didn\u2019t know what was Passover.\nAnd so I invite -- I was sleeping at Mrs. Moscovitz, so we went for -- for the passo -- the\nne -- we were the five of us, it was my first Passover, you know? And they did explain to\nme, and this little girl, she said di -- when she had to tell the story of Passover, she said\nand then the carabinieri came. The ca -- the carabinieri with the [indecipherable] you\nknow. Think it was really cute. And -- and that was it. So -- but then I didn\u2019t see Mrs.\nMoscovitz any more again. I heard that she died. These are the Moscovitz\u2019. The Weiss, I\ndon\u2019t know at -- what happened to them. Then I -- we had very close friends, this was a --\nJanuary 20, 2004\noh, a -- let\u2019s so -- go to the -- the important ones, the -- the Schtitzel.

        "A: So they arrived, and they found an apartment. It was a beautiful apartment building\nnear the station an -- and the tennis courts. And there were only two apartments per\nbuilding -- per -- per floor. We were on the fifth floor.",
        "A: 19 -- after -- immediately after the anschluss, what was -- what year was --",
        "A: 1938, yes. They arrived -- we were flabbergasted, because they were, all of them,\nabout two fee -- two -- two meter of tall -- one meter -- two meter tall. He was a very\nelegant gentleman, you know, very well dressed. She was a beautiful woman.",
        "A: From Vienna, as far as I remember, and then they had son, Anton, called Tondo in\n[indecipherable] he\u2019s always been Tondo. And I think that he was from very wealthy\nfamily in Vienna. I think that they were [indecipherable] special wines were --\nJanuary 20, 2004\nexpensive, gourmet food. As far as I think -- v-vaguely this -- I -- we never investigated\nwhat they were doing or something, and -- you know. And we started to talk, wi -- you\nknow, th-the balcony, which was giving on the tennis courts, it was the balcony of our\nkitchen, and by the balcony of their kitchen was just looking as -- an -- by us, to our\nbalcony. So we -- I was already -- well, in \u201938, I was already 16 year old\n[indecipherable] something, and my sister was 12. Tondo was the age of -- o-of my\nsister, and we started to talk [indecipherable] soon from the balcony and then we\nbecame friends, we were [indecipherable] with the parents, and then that was it. And\nthey were at four -- ended \u201843. We became very close. When, in \u201943, the Germans took\nover our area, after the armistice, immediately after September eight, we, at that time\nwere h-having our -- spending our vacation at the seashore in Lowranna, or Lovranna\nnow, in Notelle. And we\u2019ve, unfortunately saw them arriving, the soldiers, how would\nyou say? Making pee pee, you know, on the street, you know. Walking whi -- whi-while\nthey were walking, going like this. Then we her -- we heard shots. They shot a couple of\npartisans who were already ready there, and they didn\u2019t let anybody to go near them.\nThere was one in the orchard and we can -- nobody can go -- can go there to take care of\nthis person, and so on. And so, since we didn\u2019t feel safe in the hotel, there was -- there\nwere some Croatian friends who had a villa, which once belonged to one of the\narchdukes, because that area was very famous during the Austro-Hungarian empire. They\nwere keeping their -- their mistresses and they were spending their vacation there, and\nJanuary 20, 2004\nthis kind of thing. And we went to stay with them, eating only sardines and potatoes,\nokay, that was it. And the Schtitzel were also vacationing in the same place, and they got\nextremely scared, of course. And they -- they found a -- a f -- a fisherman, who took them\nby boat to Yugoslavia, to the -- to the Dalmatia actually, to the other coast. They were\nhoping to be able to reach, probably -- I don\u2019t know, southern Italy. And I remember that\nthey gave us a bag with the jewelry and -- and the -- and the key to the apartment. The\nonly thing she took with -- no -- they took the jewelry with them, giving a -- and -- and\nthey went there. Then they came back from Yugoslavia and they came to the apartment\nbecause they felt safe, an-and they were safe, nobody bothered them. But th-the -- we\nknow -- nobody knew for how long they would have been safe, so they wanted to go\naway. And they got in touch with the police commissioner, who probably is on the -- how\ndo you say, the roll of the just or whatever it is in Jerusalem, Panicucci was the -- the\ncommissioner. One was [indecipherable] the name, they made a sort of film about him.\nThe --",
        "A: No, no, no, no, the -- the commissioner, the -- th-they made a -- the documentary, that\n-- that 1t was even shown on th -- a couple of weeks ago in the Jewish thing. The last one\nwas about the one who was also killed afterwards, who gave her passports to the Jews,\nand so on, but Panicucci was --\nJanuary 20, 2004",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no. In Italian.",
        "A: And [indecipherable]",
        "A: Perlaska, Perlaska. They -- Panicucci was the Perlaska of our area. And so\napparently he gave them -- yeah, and he gave them papers with another name, Sardi, and\nth-the Franciscans father of the church of sa -- of San Geron -- Geronim -- Geronimo\u2019s\nchurch gave them birth certificates, Catholic [indecipherable]. But they fact is that 1-1n --\nin the -- between \u201938 to \u201943, Tondo became a big boy. They were -- in Fiume, everybody\nknew them because they were so visible, you know, tall, handsome, they see all\n[indecipherable] of them going, you know? So, they were -- th-they went to f -- they\nwent to flo -- to the -- they wanted to go to Venice, but how do we go to Venice?\nEverybody knows us, somebody meet you on the train, and if we have different\ndocuments, the Germans were going up and down the train. Okay, we -- Thea can take\nthe -- the -- the documents for you, but -- but you le -- so they left with the f-forged\ndocuments on the train, and on the same train, like an idiot, I was on the same train as\nthey were o-on with their real documents. So -- but we pretended not to know each other.\nI was sitting in one -- I -- I was sitting on one side, in one compartment, they were sitting\non the other. And then, you know, we were in different are -- Tondo and I went on the\ncorridor, we started to talk like two people who just meet, you know, it wa -- it was really\nJanuary 20, 2004\nsomething. They were no trouble. In the meantime we had told to my sist -- my aunt --\nmy mother\u2019s sister, who was living in Trieste, that they were coming, to please -- she s --\nsince she had the large apartment, not many beds, but a large apartment, an enormous\nliving room, dining room, larger than this one, to arrange for them to spend the night\nthere, because the next day they were going to -- to Venice. So when they arrived, we\nwent to the house of my aunt, she had arranged some mats on the floor an-and we slept\nthere. And the next day they went to Venice. Their new names were Sardi. They were no\nmore Schtitzel, they were Sardi, and they went to live for awhile in hotel. But, of course,\nVenice and Fiume are pretty close and they were afraid that some people from Fiume\nwould recognize them there, or [indecipherable]. And I remember that even I went once\nto visit with them -- o-or es -- yes, before leaving they gave us their jewelry, and there\nwas another family too, in Abbazia, where they left a trunk, where she left her fur coats.\nI don\u2019t know what was there because we never saw the trunk and we never saw that\nfamily. And I don\u2019t know if -- how the stuff she gave them left. We -- they left in the\napartment only some wine, some food that he had put aside, Mr. Schtitzel. But they gave\nus the jewelry, and she took only a beautiful diamond ring she had, she took with her.\nAnd they went to -- as I say, they went to Venice. I went to visit with them and by\nmistake I knocked at the door and I said, Mr. Schtitzel. The poor man was scared -- was\nscared to death, but I did -- you know, it win -- I-I -- without thinking. He was so scared.\nAnyhow, from there they moved to Milan where this engineer, Fierst, who was th --\nJanuary 20, 2004\nworking my -- with my father had found refuge in a -- in an apartment building in Milan,\nwhere many Jews were living we -- under ma -- different names, and they moved in\nthere. The portieri knew about them, everybody knew who they were, but nothing\nhappened. But the fact 1s that -- came that time that Tondo had the age to be called into\nthe army. And th -- Mr. Schtitzel, Arnold, got so scared that he -- I don\u2019t know through\nwhom, thi-this we heard later wa -- from -- from the sh -- from the Fierst who told them,\ndon\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that, they might not call him. Hide the boy, don\u2019t do it. Instead,\nno, no, no, no, we go to Switzerland, we go to Switzerland, we go to Switzerland. And\nthe guys who were supposed to take them across the border apparently betrayed them,\nand -- and that was it. For a long time we didn\u2019t hear anything. The war was over. Tito\noccupied our area. And one day a nice gentleman knocks at our door. And he says, I am\nso and so and so. I am the head of the Jewish community here in Fiume. I know that you\nhelped the -- the Schtitzels and that the Schtitzels gave you some jewelry, so on. Oh,\nsays, thank goodness. So we gave to him -- he -- of course he -- he demonstrated\n[indecipherable] and we gave the jewels to him a-and then we didn\u2019t hear from him any\nmore, but I\u2019m -- it -- I\u2019m sure -- how -- how else could he know if -- if they had not told\nhim? We trusted him immediately and we gave him back the jewels. She had -- she had\nhidden her diamond in her rectum when she was traveling and of course they found it,\nyou know, because there -- they were examining a-absolutely everything. And so -- and\nJanuary 20, 2004\nthis man told us that Tondo and her -- and the father died in Auschwitz and, which 1s\neven more terrible, Nellie, the mother, was sick and she was killed by the dogs.",
        "A: They were chasing after her and they -- and she died like this. In the meantime, they\nhad left with us the address of her brother, who was living in New York, Otto Weiss.\nAnd I started to correspond -- as soon as I heard this, I wrote to him also, telling him\nabout the jewels and telling him about the few things that they left with us, a -- a -- a\nsilver box, because Mr. Schtitzel, during the first World Wars, was a officer in the\nAustrian army. And the box he left with us was a box that he received from his\ncompanions, I don\u2019t know in what occasion, with all the signatures of his companions.\nAnd we have a photograph of the group of Austrian officers, and he is there, you see? It\nwas -- it -- and so I wrote to Uncle Otto in English, with my poor English, but I managed.\nNo, I -- Ia -- at the time I was speaking some German, I don\u2019t know whether it was\nGerman or English, I mixed up things. I still have the correspondence, it\u2019s home. And so\nhe said well, that to give certain things to -- to -- to I don\u2019t know who it was, and to keep\nthe rest for us, it was a -- the -- th-the -- took the [indecipherable]. And -- and that was\nit. And that was the end o-o-of the Schtitzel. And to us it was just like losing family, and\n-- and to hear that they went like that was really terrible. I kept corresponding with Uncle\nOtto, who was sending us care packages, because under Tito it was much worse than\nduring the war. That was the worst part of -- for us, because Fiume was bombed only by\nJanuary 20, 2004\n-- by the -- but when the British were bombing, where they were coming only with the s -\n- small planes, with the Sp-Spitfires, you know, and they were -- since all the -- th-the --\nthe big industries were along the coast, they were not touching the city. They were going\nba -- th -- shooting at whatever the equipment they had there. But th-then the -- the\nAmericans came and then they bombed also the city, so much so that where we were --\nno, we had shelters since there is the mountain behind th -- we are on the ocean and -- th-\nthe sea and the mountain and the shelters were under the mountain. And when the\nGermans were there, in the -- in the -- a-and they occupied the shipyard, part of the he --\nlighter works were hidden under the rocks under the mountains and so that -- and also,\nnear our home there was a shelter under th-the hills, so that we were safe in there. And\nduring that time, they were recruiting the Germ -- the Germans -- this 1s -- this has\nnothing to -- the Schtitzel were already away, but at that time, yes, we were still -- there\nwere still Jews, men -- several Jews in Fiume. Among them were the two Farcas brother,\nRudy and -- Rudy and Paolo. Rudy was the youngest one, a little bit light-headed,\nsimple, very, very pleasant boy. And Paolo, who was helping my sister with her Latin,\nyou know. And the ta -- the time came that -- when th-the -- the Germans started to\nrecruit the young people to work -- the famous [indecipherable] organization, you know,\nto build a -- fortresses to -- to -- to build for them things all along the border because we\nwere right on the border with the Yugoslavs, you know? And we were saying, Paolo and\nRudy, Paolo, go away, go away, go away. Why do you stay here, why do you stay here?\nJanuary 20, 2004\nAnd they said no, but there is no, we are working there, they are kind to us, they are nice.\nWe are not only Jews there, they were recruiting everybody, you know. And he said, no,\nno, he said, we stay. Then one day they took away their parents, and they said co -- and\nthey took them to Trieste, to the only concentration camp that th-the Germans made in\nTrieste, the famous rice factory, you know, the risia -- Risiera where they -- well, they di\n-- | don\u2019t know wha-what they did to them, they burned them or the wa -- I had -- I had\nno idea what -- what was going on. The Risiera now is the national monument in tr -- in\nTrieste, you know. A me-me -- a memorial. And we were telling them, go away, go\naway. No, no, no. When, after the parents were sent we\u2019d say, but now you better go. No,\nno, no, no, no, no, no. In the meantime also, my sister and myself were recruited and my\nsister became a welder. Be si -- since Father was working at the shipyard, he immediately\nput them to work there. I was studying to be a doctor, so I was in the infirmary, and I was\nthere helping the doctor, giving injections for -- for all kind of people, you know? And\nmy sister was a welder for the ships, you know? And -- and the funny thing 1s that they\nwere repairing the -- one of the -- I think 1t was a cruiser, I don\u2019t rem -- I don\u2019t know the\nname, the American names of the ships, but anyhow, which had been damaged, and the\nwork was not -- never proceeding because the workers were working and undoing. Doing\nand undoing so that the Germans couldn\u2019t get it, you know? But finally they had to do it,\nand they -- because the Germans started to -- so, it was completed, and they went\n[indecipherable] to test, they were only -- but they were only the workers, Italian, that\nJanuary 20, 2004\nthey f -- workers. My father was on board, everybody. They went to sea, they tested, they\ncame back, everything was perfect. The first time that the Germans went at sea with the\n[indecipherable] with the cruiser or whatever name it 1s, all at once we were standing on\n-- in -- looking at the -- at that ship, because working there both of us, we were there at\nthe shipyard with Father. All at once from -- 1t was a sky like this one with broken clouds\nand sun, out of the clouds, Spitsfires started to comes. They knew that there were only\nGermans on board, so there must have been, you know, something. And vroom, vroom,\nvroom, vroom, they came back to the shipyard, you know, with wounded people and so\nand so. That was it. Then they bombed of course the -- the -- the -- the shipyard, the\nAmericans who were in there. We were able to go underground, in -- under the -- th-the\nrocks. Then, when the bombardment was over, they brought some soldiers which were --\nhad been there [indecipherable] the German soldiers, I remember I had to give\nmorphium to whoever there was very heavily wounded, the -- he broke a -- he lost a leg,\nbut I remember he was there. We were -- we were two -- there were the -- the -- the -- the\nreal nurse, then -- it was a man, the doctor and myself, and we had really to work, you\nknow, [indecipherable] morphium Schwester, morphium Schwester, because he was\nin terrible pain. His hand was completely open, like this, you know. I gave him\nmorphium and then they took him to the hospital. I heard that day he lost a leg, this\nsoldier. And so the Farcas brothers were still there and one morning, it was a Sunday, we\nwake up and we could see the synagogue from our building, because it was very opened,\nJanuary 20, 2004\nand we see f-fire. We said, God gracious, that\u2019s the synagogue. So my sister and I got\ndressed. Father and Mother didn\u2019t even dream to say no, don\u2019t go. It was naturally for us,\nwe all -- we went to there and the fra -- th-the -- the synagogue was as fa -- afire. And\nthere he -- who was, Paolo and Rudy Farcas, who said, go away, go away. He says to\n[indecipherable] if the Germans see that you are with us, he said, you are in danger, go\naway. We said my -- no, don\u2019t -- when -- we didn\u2019t go away. We were there crying,\ncrying, crying. You should have seen that synagogue, it was so beautiful. And -- but we\nse -- an-and they didn\u2019t let the firemen to go and take care of the fire. It was a terrible\nday. It was in \u201943 when they burned th-the synagogue, those [indecipherable] th-th-the --\nthe [indecipherable]. And that was it. And of course, after awhile Rudy and Farcas\n[indecipherable] Rudy an-and -- and -- and -- and Paolo didn\u2019t appear any more. They\nwere taken and we don\u2019t know how -- what, we don\u2019t know. We can imagine how they\nend up. So that [indecipherable]. I think that\u2019s as far as our experience with\n[indecipherable]. That\u2019s all that I can remember.",
        "A: Yes, yes.\nJanuary 20, 2004",
        "A: No. No. There were -- I was a -- I were just a passenger, period. I -- [indecipherable]\nand I was afra -- I was not afraid, I was not worried. My parents sent me like nothing, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- we didn\u2019t think of the danger, actually. I don\u2019t know why, because we were\nreally -- it -- it was n -- to -- to us it was normal to -- to -- to do that, you know. That was\nit. A-And also for my aunt to give them refuge there for -- that night and -- and also the\npeople in -- in -- 1-1-in Milan, if Arnold wouldn\u2019t have been so afraid for -- for -- for his\nson, probably nothing would have happened, because Fierst came back, went to work in\nGenoa after the war, and, you know.",
        "A: Arnold, and she was Nellie Weiss, Nellie Weiss. But they -- they were adorable\npeople, so nice, so nice. And when I came here, I tried to get in touch with Otto Weiss\nand I was not able to find it. Maybe either he had died, or the company was no more\nthere, or something. But I have the correspondence with Uncle Otto and he actually -- his\nis the one who told -- who wrote to me that he had -- tha-that Nellie was killed that\nhorrible way, you know.",
        "A: The -- the people were really hor-horrified -- horrified, but you know, probably there\nwere some fanatics who were really happy, you know, like always, but no, the people\nwere really -- I tell you, until -- it was until \u00b043 that -- that they were living peacefully.\nJanuary 20, 2004\nThen we did -- then the Germans came, then there was the -- of course, the ones who\nwere just accusing people for -- for re-revenge, which happened also when Tito took\nover, they had just to say, well, that was a fascist, even if he had not been ever, he said,\nand they killed several people of ours, and -- with nothing to do. It wa -- under Tito it\nwas terrible. But under Tito I was a -- I left in December to stay with fr -- just to pass --\nspend Christmas with a friend in Valdosta for -- to go skiing and then they arrested th-\nthey -- th-they -- they -- wa -- we call them Titini. The partisans arrested my father as an\nenemy of the people, you know, because then it stopped to be something like a war, it\nwas a -- the Slavs against the Italians. And they arrested everybody who was somebody.\nThe owner of all the bus lines which were going from Fiume to Trieste in the area, the\ndirector of the for -- torpedo plant. Everybody who was somebody. For awhile they were\nin -- in jail all together, and for awhile they had their -- they were very worried,\nespecially for my father because my father, being an engineer, a technician, they were\nlacking personnel but it -- in that -- in -- in that field. We were afraid the -- because some\nwere sent inside Yugoslavia to -- to work there for them. And instead there were some\nworkers who accused Father of mistreatment. Father was a -- a rabbit like I am. Very\ngood on his job, but not -- not a courageous person in the sense that -- courageous, yes he\nwas, but not -- not to beat people or do these things of this kind, but you always find one\nwho was for one reason or another. And then he was for one month in isolation, and --\nand that broke my father. My father had never been the same, and if -- 1t ended --\nJanuary 20, 2004\nfortunately it ended peacefully in, you know, his own bed without ever being sick, but he\nwas a depressed person for an 0 -- when he came I -- 1-in the meantime, I wanted to go\nback to Fiume because before going, they came to have us opting to be Yugoslav or\nItalian. Of course, we all opted to be Italian, to go back to Italy, [indecipherable]. And --\nand I fr -- heard that my father was in prison by some university companions who were\nalso from Fiume, who came to meet me at the station and they said, oh you know, your\nfather 1s in jail in Fiume. That was the way I heard it. So I wanted to run to -- to Fiume.\nAnd I got, with great difficulty, in touch with my family and they told me, please don\u2019t\ncome because otherwise they catch you too, because you were [indecipherable] when\nyou -- okay. So I started to work. I -- I -- at the time I was studying and then I had to start\nto work, that\u2019s why I -- I am not a doctor, because I couldn\u2019t work and so on. Th-The iron\nfist, the British troops who had been stationed in -- in Naples, opened a garrison in\nPadwa and they hire me -- my English was just school English, poor, but 1t was better\nthan nothing.

        "A: Well, the -- as I said, I was working as a nurse in the shipyards, and my sister was a\nwelder, but for -- at the time she stopped working as a welder because she had typhoid\nfever, something like this. She was in the hospital. And when the end was coming, it was\nthe beginning of May, the Yugoslav were bombing with ca -- with ca-cannons, grenades,\nFiume. And in order to be safer, they had -- they -- the engineers had the -- the shifts to\nspend the nights in the shipyard, to keep an eye on whatever was going on, you know?\nAnd | as a nurse, was staying with Father and we were sleeping underground in the\nshelter, under the rocks. It was a very safe shelter, I must say because when they bombed,\nnothing happened to us. They destroyed a lot of things, but the bomb didn\u2019t bother us.\nAnd, in parentheses, my fat -- my father was made th-the head of -- chief of the oompah,\nwhich I don\u2019t remember right now what it means, but it was a -- a -- a group which was\ntaking care of -- in case of a fire -- so-some -- some kind of a fireman, in case of\nbombings and things of this kind. And he and his workers -- how -- how can I say? The\nGermans had put dynamite under all the cranes of the shipyard, because before leaving\nthey wanted to destroy the shipyards. Father and his men of the oompah, I don\u2019t know\nJanuary 20, 2004\nwhen, I don\u2019t know now because he didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t talk about these things, took off\nth -- everything, so that nothing blew up, you know, never s -- never tol -- never\nrecognized because it was an a -- again, a natural thing to do. So th -- he saved the\nshipyard. Never recognized, never got a penny for it, but who wanted it anyhow? So\nanyhow, when they started to bomb th-th-the -- the bombs started to come from the\nYugoslav side and the Yugoslavs were advancing, the partisans and so on, the Germans\nstarted to flee. And it was a heavy bombardment. So we fa -- they said -- Father called the\ndi-director, he said -- th-the -- of the -- of the shipyard, what do I do? He said, here I have\na few men, and do I -- he said, do what you want. Washed their hands. You -- you -- you\ndecide, you do what you want, he said, because I cannot leave here, nobody want -- you\ncan leave because anyhow that is -- so -- so we -- we left and we went walking and it was\nquite the walk, you just -- like going from here, more than down, going to -- from here to\nBethesda, something like this. And we -- we heard the grenades, fssh, pssh, falling\naround us. And I kept the white cas -- boar -- rope, you know, was a [indecipherable] on\nthe street, you know. But do you think that the Germans bothered t-to bother us? They\nwere running. They were passing by us, going, running, scup -- escaping, escaping. And -\n- and then we went -- we went home. And when we reached home, since it was in a\ndangerous positions, we went to stay with a family, some friends of ours for a --for a few\ndays. Then we went back home and -- and 1t was May -- must have been the third or\nfourth, because Tito\u2019s birthday, I think, is on the -- I have to look in my book, but was in\nJanuary 20, 2004\non the fifth or the sixth of May, when they started to shoot like crazy, pom, pom, pom,\npom, pom to -- to celebrate, you know? And ye -- we could see, since we are in this wide\navenue, you know, living, it was just like going through a dead city, you know, all the\nshutters were down. We were looking through the shutters and they were coming with\nthese carts, with the car -- with the -- how do you say, the animals, the [indecipherable]\nthe warri -- [phone ringing] -- sorry. [tape break]. So th-th-this was all the shutters\ndown and they came wi -- on the carts, pulled by the oxen, and that -- a thing which was\nunbelievable, and they di -- and you could see these people sitting la -- you know, th-the\npoor -- I understand they -- they were poor people who lived in the woods, these\npartisans, but they were really mean. And they were s-standing on the streets and dancing\nthe kolo. And th-the ones from Montenegro, th -- with the sh -- sheepco -- sheepskin\ncoats over there ki-killing lice, you know. It was terrible. And that was the time when we\nwere afraid to talk, when we couldn\u2019t even talk to friends because we didn\u2019t know what\nwe're going to do, we -- what they were going to say or something. These people di --\nwent in -- they enter some apartment, they didn\u2019t understand what they\u2019re -- they didn\u2019t\nknow how to use th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the facilities. They were looking\nat the chandeliers, you know, all this light coming from. It was really a [indecipherable]\naffair. And that was it. So then they came, they wanted us to [indecipherable] as I said,\nand -- and then I, as I said, I went to -- first to F-Florence just for a visit. I came back to\nit -- to -- to Fiume, then I went to Valdosta and when I went to Padwa they told me not\nJanuary 20, 2004\nto go back to Fiume. I started to work with the British troops, [indecipherable] head-\nheadquarters Padwa garrison. I worked for there for awhile, taking care of the wives of\nthe English soldiers, Italian wi -- and they picked up some very good kids, but they\npicked up a lot of trash too, you know? And -- and after -- and I was there until \u201948.\nWhen my father came out th -- my -- finally my father was freed because the judge of this\ntribunal of the people w-was -- had been friendly with the Jews too, and he knew about\nour friendships or something, I don\u2019t know how. And I f -- with the excuse that Father\nhad arthritis, one thing and the other, they said no, no, no, he has to go -- he has to go to\nAbbano, which 1s a spa, and Father came out, but th-that man on the street didn\u2019t want to\ntalk. My f -- my father didn\u2019t want to talk. He was turning always his head, he -- no, no,\nno, th-they are following me, they -- they\u2019re -- that was -- Father was ruined, that was it.\nAnd fr -- then in \u201948 he didn\u2019t want to stay in -- in -- he finally found a job down south in\n-- near Foja, in Napolia, that he worked for awhile, and I worked too. I went to teach at\nthe Boys Town in Bari. And in Boys Town in our Bari came an American gentleman,\nMr. Broya to visit this place. And at the s -- at the same time, I was working with the\n[indecipherable] of Bari for the rice company of Milan, and they told me that if I could\nbe t-to help them, because Ambassador Dunne was coming to Bari, a-and so I went. And\nthis way I started to get in touch with the Americans, because I went to -- I went to the\ntheater, there were a ceremony, I was there with Ambassador Dunne, | had the pictures\naround. And -- and there there were a certain Mr. Mamoly who was working with the\nJanuary 20, 2004\nMarshall Plan in Rome. So when the fair was over he said, why don\u2019t you come over\nand look for a job? And they -- I got the job with the Marshall Plan. They had organized,\nas kind of a traveling -- 1t was like a circus, it wa -- it looked, you know, it was with a\ntent and something. But there was all booths with propaganda for the Marshall Plan and\nwhat the Marshall Plan was doing. But they were coming from France, the group\n[indecipherable] group. And they were all French, two Americans, an Italian and myself.\nAnd we went from Bari to Catan -- to Sicily, Catania, Palermo, Messina, Bari. And\nthis way I got acquainted with the Americans and fine -- I got the permanent job with the\nMarshall Plan. I worked there from \u201951 to \u201954. In \u201954 they needed interpreters here in\nthis country because with the counterpar -- counterpart funds, which p-program they were\nexchange -- they were sending Italian technicians, politicians, trade union people to learn\nhere in America how things were going. They send somebody from the State Department\nto -- to -- to -- to test several people, and among [indecipherable] and -- and a friend\nwho just died not long ago, and myself were chosen to -- an-and so I came here as an\ninterpreter.

It was living,\nyou know? Only now, going back and remembering these things, yes, I -- I think that it\nwas -- life was while living and probably if I would live again I would do it again the\nsame things as [indecipherable]. And as far as the Jewish situation is concerned, well,\nmy feelings had always been the same.

You know, no prejudice.\nMa -- there was never any prejudice in my family -- I remember even my grandfather --\nnow I remember that they had probably some Jewish friends, from the names that they --\nvaguely I remember, but one more -- one thing really I\u2019m very happy of, that in Trieste\nwe have the most beautiful synagogue, beautiful, and I don\u2019t know how it was not\ntouched. It is -- well, pr-probably they stole something away, they -- they -- they -- they --\nthey -- they used it, the Germans, for something, but it -- it was not torn, it\u2019s a beautiful\nsynagogue. I don\u2019t know how it happen. And -- and in -- in Trieste, for instance, where I\nwas born, 1n my mentality is more Triestini than Italiana. I am very much middle\nEuropean not -- I don\u2019t -- I feel Italian very deeply one way, but more middle European.\nAnd I\u2019m proud of it because if -- you have to read that book by John Morris, you know,\nTrieste [indecipherable] and you will see. And we had, for instance, our great -- two --\ntwo of the greatest Triestini writers, Humberto Saba, he is half Jewish, mother Jewish\nand -- and father not.

This is really another\nJanuary 20, 2004\nexperience really worthwhile te-tell -- recounting, to show what Yugoslavia was under\nTito.

And after the stairs there -- th -- there\nwere the boxes for their mail. Mailboxes with the names, you know? The names were\nthere. To us it was a terrible thing. Not our, that was not, but the Schtitzel were there.\nAnd the Moscovitz were there, but the Moscovitz at least died peacefully, but when we\nsaw the Schtitzel there, it was something so terrible, so terrible.
