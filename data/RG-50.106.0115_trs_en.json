But a man who is married\nwith three \u2014 with si \u2014 with five children, how can you go with that certificate? My\nfather would never leave his wife and children and go to Israel, never. Because\nmine uncle left and his \u2014 my \u2014 my father\u2019s brother left Argentina, and in seven\nyears he couldn\u2019t bring his wife with his child from Baranowicze, so everybody\nused to say, uh-huh, you see?

        "Q: Would you describe yourself as physically strong?",
        "A: Yeah, I was very strong. I nev \u2014 1-1f somebody gets me, I give \u2014 give him the\ndoubles. And first of all, I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I was the type that I was \u2014 never let people hi-hit\nme, because I knew he 1s bigger, he is stronger, I got to start first. And that was\nhappen always, even the Russian army had [indecipherable] I have to fight. When I\nwas in the partisans, I used to go and train people, so they used to tell me, who\nneeds Jews?

        "A: Many times we used to talk, but sometime \u2014 we couldn\u2019t talk openly so much,\nbecause we knew that our father would like to do it, run away, but he hasn\u2019t got\nenough money yet. [indecipherable] make him [indecipherable] when he wants to\ngo so much. So many times we spoke \u2014 I used to speak with my older brother, with\nthe other cousins, that maybe we should run away and we\u2019ll go to Russia for\n[indecipherable] go to Israel. And we were afraid, in case we the oldest too, we\u2019ll\ngo away and Papa stays with Mom, with the smaller children, who knows if\nsomething happen, who is gonna help them? And that\u2019s was the reason we didn\u2019t\ngo. Actually, in \u2014 when \u2014 before Hitler came, we wanted to run away from the\nRussia, and my mama used to told me, okay, if you want to go, go. But you\u2019ll never\nsee your mommy again.",

And we stayed there for a couple of\ndays, because we knew Baranowicze 1s a bigger city and they gonna bomb. So we\ndid smart, went, took off \u2014 adif \u2014 our horses with the wagons and everything what\u2019s\nin the house, it was our little models that we had and [indecipherable] and we came\nback.

How we can do\nmost of it? What \u2014 what should we do? It \u2014 I think that the situation was so tense,\nthe rabbis, the big rabbis run away to li \u2014 to \u2014 to Vilna. From there they want to go\nto America, to Israel, to China, wherever they can go. And the people were left\nlike \u2014 I d\u2014I don\u2019t want to say that, but it \u2014 1t was something wrong. The mazel was\nthat we youngsters, we dint \u2014 we didn\u2019t know about it exactly, but the parents knew.\nAnd this was like a [indecipherable], you know what a [indecipherable]\nfinster(ph), schwartz(ph). This cou \u2014 I-look at it as ar \u2014 it\u2019s something 1s very\nwrong, it\u2019s no [indecipherable] the whole thing. And this was very, very bad,\nbecause people \u2014 you know how you say when you leave \u2014 when you lose money\nit\u2019s nothing, but when you lose hope, you lost everything. And this was a station of\nlosing hope. It was very dangerous situation. Then the Russian come in. When the\nRussian come in, first of all, they took away the rich and the \u2014 and \u2014 and this what \u2014\nand what they didn\u2019t like the ca \u2014 ca \u2014 zi-zi \u2014 Zionist, and took them to Siberia. The\nrove(ph) was in shul, Shabbat, they took him, and many other people who came\nfrom Poland who wasn\u2019t register. And they took him to the wagons \u2014 the wagons to\nKamchatka, I don\u2019t know where they took him to \u2014 to \u2014 to Russia, deep 1-1n\nSiberia. Many die from verra \u2014 from hunger, from anything. But our \u2014 our\n[indecipherable] was alive, he lived [indecipherable] with us, al-all his\nApril 8, 1999\ngrandchildren, his children and the rest of them die in the ghetto barrage. So it was\n[indecipherable], it \u2014 it was a mishmash, that you cannot control it and you cannot\nsay anything. But we were so religious in heart, but Israel [indecipherable] that we\n\u2014 we didn\u2019t blame the rabbis. We \u2014 we didn\u2019t want to say nothing about the rabbis,\nbut in \u2014 in heart you have to say, my good \u2014 my father wouldn\u2019t leave because he\nwants his wife and his children. The rabbi the same thing, got to be in the city,\nbecause he got [indecipherable] city. So is na\u2014I can\u2019t give you the\n[indecipherable] but it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t so [indecipherable], you know.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to see a Russian soldier in a Russian uniform?",
        "A: Well, I, as a Zionist I didn\u2019t like it, because they were wear \u2014 anti \u2014 anti-Zionist\nand \u2014 excuse me \u2014 and they \u2014 the propaganda that I should become a\nKomsomold(ph). A Komsomold(ph) means a communist. And because I didn\u2019t\nwant to become a communist, a Komsomold(ph), they wouldn\u2019t take me in \u2014 into\nthe better schools.

The-They bring you to a place, they put you on a chair, the chair is\nflying, and you look over, yeah, what\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s [indecipherable] too. So\nm-most of the people fall down, and then they have t \u2014 you have to go out and \u2014 on\n[indecipherable] they call it, to \u2014 to pick up [indecipherable] and the things, and\nyour head down and the feet on top, to stay for five minutes like this, a-and \u2014 and\nnot \u2014 and not to move.

        "A: Lida.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and then what happened?",
        "A: Then, when I \u2014 I was in the school over there, I \u2014 I \u2014 it was no kosher food. It\nwas no Shabbas religion there. I felt that my world is going under me. I wanted to\nApril 8, 1999\nrun away, but I c \u2014 I couldn\u2019t, because if I would run away, they would take my\nfamily and send to Siberia. So I had to wait, to wait, to wait until a chance, and all\nof a sudden the school was burning in a fire. Something \u2014 probably Polish guys did\nit. So we had to go home, everybody goes home for awhile, and then the Hitler \u2014\nHitler came. When Hitler came \u2014",

        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 my father didn\u2019t do anything. Didn\u2019t do anything. He used to go to \u2014\ndown [indecipherable] send people to get us [indecipherable] in a private house\nand nobody should know about it. That\u2019s the way they did it.",
        "Q: Was he able to keep his business when the Russians were really \u2014",
        "A: Way \u2014 the business was out 1-1-in \u2014 1n one week they took everything away. They\nclean up the stoves and the milk with the cheeses, it \u2014 it didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t left\neven a smell of it. In one week the city was clean up from everything.

So it \u2014 it wasn \u2014 it wasn\u2019t good, no. But we\nplayed the game, you know, for two years.",
        "Q: And then, during those two years, did you yourself notice any more anti-Se-\nSemitic incidents?",
        "A: Not really. It was much better. The Russian was watching that they sh-shouldn\u2019t\nhappen. Secondly, we had the majority of Jews in the city, who came from Poland.\nWe were almost \u2014 most of the city were Jews. So the Polacks were afraid, so they\nwere quiet, and the White Russian didn\u2019t say anything because they wanted to\nbecome higher and higher.

Quiet, nice, no \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 not hardships, no \u2014 no hard\ntimes. But after being two, three days they show what [indecipherable] they start\nbeating and taking people just in the street to work an-and to ro \u2014 clear th \u2014\neverything what in th \u2014 done is not in order, you know, and everything the Jews has\nto do.

So we \u2014 but we do believe, of course we knew.\nAnd secondly, many Germans used to come to our house and said, run away,\nbecause the Jews were \u2014 will be killed in \u2014 1n a very short time. So I don\u2019t know all\nthe Germans for Jews, or the Germans for Socialists or something like that, but they\nwere all Nazis in the army.

        "Q: Th-These were German soldiers who told you that?\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: Yeah, and we used to say, where we gonna run? How? We have no arms. The\nRussians left everything behind them. Vlasov(ph) give up three million best soldiers\nfrom Vlasov(ph) in the Russian army gave up, because they didn\u2019t like the\ncommunism, right. But after, what Hitler did to the \u2014 I call it to the prisoners, and\nnot many prisoners run away to deep Russia, and they told them, look, th-the\nGermans burn them [indecipherable] they put a \u2014 a \u2014 a little h \u2014 you know, hole,\nand you put naft(ph) and oil and they burn them.

And it came a time they say they\nhad to go [indecipherable], so we go. We \u2014 but we couldn\u2019t take horses and\nwagons with us. You could take only what you can carry. Because the White\nRussians and the Polacks were waiting for this moment and they were \u2014 they used to\nstay and right \u2014 ro-rob everything. They took it away.",
        "Q: Whatever you couldn\u2019t take.",
        "A: Right. And better things, the Germans saw after a few days what the Polacks and\nthe [indecipherable] doing, so they say stop. Now, y-you have [indecipherable] in\nhere. We gonna take first, then what we got leftover, you gonna take. They become\nApril 8, 1999\nsmart. And that\u2019s the way we \u2014 we \u2014 we arrive in a house in Baranowicze at\nPoniatowska street. And over there my uncle - my mommy\u2019s sister had two houses\nand a husband and three children. So when all the family from my mommy\u2019s side to\n\u2014 went the other side and the [indecipherable] side all together came into the\nhouses, maybe 200 people I\u2019m telling you, in the two houses, because \u2014",
        "Q: Stayed in the family relative\u2019s house?",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] in a room like this, maybe 20 people, we build \u2014 we\n[indecipherable] from wood. This is just a bed, this is for the older people. The\nmiddle was for the young people, and at the top, the third floor was for people like\nme, 15 - 16 - 17, they \u2014 you know, they sleep on the third floor. So \u2014",
        "Q: Ha \u2014 had you heard of ghettos before? Did you know what they were?",
        "A: We \u2014- yeah, we knew what they ha \u2014 what \u2014 Jews lived in ghettos, but between\nlisten and \u2014 or \u2014 or read the paper, a \u2014 a \u2014 a book, a-and being yourself is two\ndifferent things. You couldn\u2019t feel, all of a sudden 10 Jews smashed in \u2014 so many\npeople in one room. Then, the water wasn\u2019t inside the house at \u2014 you have to go\noutside, bring the water. So the water was [indecipherable] but it was not toilets\nenough. We have to \u2014 to \u2014 to build toilets because so many people come in such a sh\n\u2014 place. The toilets was always packed, an-and to get water was a problem, but you\nhad it. Then the Germans took young people to work. Every morning w \u2014 you had to\nApril 8, 1999\ncome in the front of the ghetto, and from the ghetto they took the people to work.\nSo, you had groups, people who worked for Russian, for them, with the clothes.\nSome people had, like me, I work in [indecipherable]. This is a group who took all\nthe arms the Russian left and we have to send it to Germany. So we had t-to work\nphysically so hard, no food, no nothing. So we had to be strong people.",
        "Q: What \u2014 wha-what did you take \u2014 what did you, as a 16 - 17 year old take with\nyou from your house to go to the ghetto?",

        "A: Shirts, and underwear and shoes, whatever we can. And you schlepped whatever\nyou could, you could schlep 50 kilos, 60 kilos on yourself, you schlepped. That\u2019s all\nyou had.",
        "Q: Did you take any special books with you, or anything of interest?",
        "A: Very, very few, because it was more important to take a lila(ph) or \u2014 or a\u2014a\nkishala(ph) under your head. A pillow or something like that. Because who wo-\nwould \u2014 would care for the [indecipherable]? Who would care if I\u2019m a \u2014 grand-\ngrandma was na \u2014 103 years old? We \u2014 all the people who were young like me, we\nApril 8, 1999\nhad to do it, everything. So it was not time to think [indecipherable] books. The\nolder people carry books. [indecipherable], but we didn\u2019t took anything. Father\nprobably took. But we used to schlep the \u2014 th-the [indecipherable] the \u2014 many\nthings what is really hard. And it was probably about two, three kilometer to \u2014 to\ncarry, it wasn\u2019t so easy. So the only thing we could do 1s stop \u2014 and again, stop\nagain until we came to the house of our \u2014 our uncle, and then we had to put it \u2014 it\u2019s\nno room to sleep, it\u2019s no room. We didn\u2019t have even tools with what to do it.",
        "Q: Did the ghetto have a wall around it, or wire?",
        "A: Wires. Double wires. It was double wires all around, and in one place it was a\nopening. Th-The Jewish police they called it inside, and the German police outside,\nand in case somebody died, to go out from here, right, to the \u2014 to the\n[indecipherable] you know, to bury it. And that\u2019s it.",

        "A: Right from beginning. From the beginning was a yellow \u2014 like this, half round, a\n| \u2014a little piece, and then this side got to be a Magen David.",
        "Q: How did you feel about wearing those stars?",
        "A: Well, 1-1-1n one case I was proud that I am Jewish. But we cou \u2014 when \u2014 when\nwe had to go to work, or go out \u2014 out to the ghetto, we weren\u2019t allowed to go out\n[indecipherable] we have to go like the horses, on the street. On the street\n[indecipherable] to walk [indecipherable] back and forth. And some people wa \u2014\nused to bee \u2014 beat up or killed on the job because the German like his nose o-or\nmaybe he didn\u2019t work so fast or whatever. They never thought that you hungry.\nSome Germans were very, very [indecipherable]. They used to say \u2014 take it, I have\nenough, I ca \u2014I can\u2019t eat any more, because he \u2014 he likes you, he wants to give you\nhis food, you know, h-half of it. So you \u2014 you \u2014 he was \u2014 this was very nice of him.\nBut from the Polacks we didn\u2019t have nothing. They used to come around the ghetto,\nthey \u2014 well, you got \u2014 what are you waiting, they\u2019re gonna kill you anyway. Give us\nyour clothes, give us your \u2014 what are you waiting for? Give it to us. So different\nbetween one another. The SS, of course, it wasn\u2019t good, the SS and the \u2014 the other\nG-Germans, but a lot of Germans were \u2014 were [indecipherable] work. He used to\nsay to me \u2014 they \u2014 they like me so he give me a name, Otto. Come\nApril 8, 1999\n[indecipherable], instead [indecipherable] he says Otto. I said, why are you\ncalling me Otto? He said, it\u2019s a German nice name and I like you, because you\u2019re\nworking with, you\u2019re always happy. And way \u2014 what could you do? Th-The cho \u2014\n[indecipherable] in life is not to give up and to try with all your care how to hold it,\nyou know, because if you\u2019re holding, a lot of people lu \u2014 do like \u2014 if you can, I'll do\ntr \u2014 I'll try. And I\u2014I did many things that I organize things that people was very\nhappy, helpful. And that was my father\u2019s [indecipherable] he used to tell me\nalways, don\u2019t give up until it\u2019s on the last second, you still have a chance. So that\nwas going on like this until one day they took me and another older man and they\ntook us to the railroad. They had to clean up the railroad, the toilets. Excuse me. So\nthey took me with him and they ta \u2014 and the Hauptman, a German Hauptman\ncame and say, you two, you got to clean up this area. The older man wa \u2014 somehow\nwent to look \u2014 find a pail and smutters and nak \u2014 somehow with his hand, poor guy\ndid it. I didn\u2019t do anything. So I \u2014 and we \u2014 before we had to go to the ghetto back,\nhe came and he says, I want my two man. So we went out from the colony. They\ncalled us and we went back to this place. Went back to the place, he said, who is the\n[indecipherable] who didn\u2019t clean it up? I said, me. And he took his gun like this in\nhis hand and made a smear on my face, like this, you know, my nose, my \u2014 my ear\nwas in a minute like this. And then with his hand on the second side. And I didn\u2019t\nApril 8, 1999\nwait. After I \u2014 when he had th-the hand in the \u2014 still out like this, I start running. I\nthought they were gonna kill me [indecipherable]. I ran zig-zagem(ph), zig-\nzagem(ph) and I came home. And I said to my parents, I am going away to Russia\nor to the partisans, I am not here any more. And my mom start begging me and\nbegging me and begging me. I was lucky that my name wasn\u2019t on the list that I run\naway, otherwise they would come to the ghet \u2014 to find me, you know. And since\nthen I change, and I went to the [indecipherable] where I work with the arms all the\ntime. And from there, I pe \u2014 heard group who was in the Polish army and the\nRussian army, we came out from there in \u2014 at \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 into the ghetto back from\nthe arms \u2014 from the armies, and we decide to fight. We have to organize ourselves,\nwe organize ourself. We had a group \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, ju \u2014 let me ask you a few more questions first. Bef \u2014 an-and we\u2019ll come to\nthat point. What were your parents doing in the early part of the ghetto times? Was\nyour father working?",
        "A: My \u2014 my father was a broken man. It was \u2014 it was \u2014 you cou \u2014 I cou \u2014 ee \u2014 I just\nlook at his face, I \u2014 I wanted to cry.

        "Q: Right, so, which is by word of mouth tn the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah, because we decided he 1s \u2014 he 1s the right man to organize this. We decide\nthat he is the man who can run us. And he was a younger, maybe two years older\nthan us, but he was a\u2014 a mensch. So we decide that he can be the man who \u2014 to\nhold us together.",

        "A: Moma. Moma Kopelowicz, because we were for all parties, I was\n[indecipherable] all my friends were from Betar, some Hatshomer Hatzair, some\nfrom Gordonia(ph). So, 1-it \u2014 we wasn\u2019t like in \u2014 from same school. We were from\nthe same city, friends, but \u2014 but every [indecipherable] idea \u2014 idea. He had to be\nthe [indecipherable] to the idea to bring altogether for the one \u2014 for this one thing\nwhat we have to do. And he did. He very smart. And he was the first that was killed\nin \u2014 in \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the putsch. Later. So he was our master of the group, and we\ndecided one day to get out. When we wanted to get out from the night \u2014\nApril 8, 1999",
        "Q: How many were in the group?",
        "A: We were like 40 \u2014 47 people.",

        "A: It was like 10 women between them too. So all people who used to work by the\nGermans, who ha-had to smuggle into the ghetto arms, bullets, grenades,\neverything. So when time came, we organize ourselves, this was approximately, I\nwould say by the te \u2014- November the \u2014 the 10\" of 1941, we decide to be going. And\nall the people came to my \u2014 to my house, and from my house we had to go out from\nthe [indecipherable]. All of a sudden came, from my city, his name was Eliezer\nLidovsky. He was a big [indecipherable]. He decide that we cannot go out,\nbecause if we gonna go out, what will happen to him and the other groups? It wa \u2014\nwe had \u2014 it was many groups in the ghetto. And he wants to be the top, that he can\nsay to all the groups when to go, when not to go. And we decide we want to go.",
        "Q: Many resistance groups.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So he came and said, if you gonna go out, the Germans will wait for\nyou outside and you all will be killed. So Moma Kopelowicz and another friend,\nEli Zaryckevicz, he was from Russia, a Russian officer, was a young man maybe\nApril 8, 1999\n25 years old. He went with him to the ghetto to explain them that we are going out,\nour little group from 47 people, and after we gonna settled, you know, make it,\neverything [indecipherable] shoot, we\u2019ll come, we\u2019ll take hundreds of people out\nfrom the ghetto. Nice? He says no, you cannot go out. He was afraid that you\u2019ll go\nout, something happened, he gonna be stuck in ghetto. And that what\u2019s happen. So\none of my friend, Moishe Taub(ph), he was in the Russian army too, and he was in\nanother group, from nervous keit, he took and he shot \u2014 he gave a shot in the house\nwith \u2014 with the rifle. Moishe Taub(ph) did it, and everybody thought the Germans\nwill come right now and they\u2019I!l destroy everything here. First of all \u2014",
        "Q: He shot into the air?",
        "A: Yeah. So everything \u2014 everybody went home back again, and I had to repair at\nnight, the cement which we did, in case the Germans come to check everything.\nAnd I worked the whole night in the cement, in the water, un-until my knee \u2014 until I\n\u2014Ire\u2014I repair somehow \u2014",
        "Q: This is closing off that entrance?",
        "A: Yeah. And got \u2014 got \u2014 got [indecipherable] like if nothing happened. They\ndidn\u2019t find it out. Now, in a \u2014 the Germans had a feeling, because they had \u2014 they\nhad e \u2014 e \u2014 espionage probably from the outside people, Polacks, Russians, who\nused to tell them that the Jews running around to buy arms. And they \u2014 they told to\nApril 8, 1999\nthe Germans all these things, that the Jews ca \u2014 buying guns, the Jews trying to\nbring guns from the Germans of \u2014 you know, and this and this. And it \u2014 it was \u2014 it\nwas like this for a f\u2014 for a few months, and then in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: 1942, March \u201942?",
        "A: Fo \u2014 yes, came the [indecipherable] the first [indecipherable] in Baranowicze.\nAnd we were prepared. We were probably five groups, wi-with 500 organized boti \u2014\nrebels to \u2014 to fight the Germans, in case they come in. One of my friend, he just die\nin Israel. Ilya(ph) Schneidel(ph). Ilyong(ph) Schneidel(ph) there had to throw a\nhand grenade, because he was in the police. And he, when he saw the Germans\ncoming, he\u2019s supposed to throw out a hand grenade and we all will go out in the\nstreets, fight the Germans outside the ghetto. We had a \u2014 we had a lot of\nammunition. We had maybe a hundred, a hundred fifty rifles, pistols and machine\nguns. We would kill in the thousands, maybe. So when the \u2014 the Germans arrive,\nthey arrive few and he thought \u2014 he asked over there, what \u2014 what are you doing\nover here, and they \u2014 they said they came for inspection just. And this was the\nbiggest mistake. The way \u2014 where he didn\u2019t throw the hand grenade, after 10 - 15\nminutes they came in the hundreds. Lithuanians, White Russians, all kind, and\nGermans you know, and pouring into the ghetto, fire in the houses, in the people, in\n\u2014all over the places. And this was a \u2014 such a tragedy. We lost half of our best\nApril 8, 1999\npeople was die \u2014 died. The other, after the [indecipherable] \u2014 after the three or four\ndays of [indecipherable] they killed over 5,000 people and they took a lot of people\ninto the concentration camps, not in Germany, but near our place, like\nMoldachewa(ph), kola -- Koldachewa(ph), Moladecznai(ph) and a lot of my\nfamily went into this category, they took them away to work over there, and they\nmade them so miserable, you wouldn't believe what they did, the Germans did to the\nJewish people over there. The White Russian used to tell them things that I am\nashamed to \u2014 t-to say it, what \u2014 what \u2014 what they did to them. And then a lot of\nthem run away to the partisans and the rest were killed by the White Russian police.\nWe are [indecipherable] who would like to run away to the partisans, but we\ncannot go. After the [indecipherable], after they killed they Jews, they made the\nghetto smaller. And all the arms we had was on the second \u2014 on the s \u2014 on the\nsecond half.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what were you doing during this \u2014 these days? Were you in hiding? How\nis that you \u2014 you weren't called up?",
        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014I was, together with my parents, when they took out everybody from \u2014\nfrom my house, when the Germans came in, and they used to came out to say Juden\nraus, Juden raus.

Just a few of my cousin were left in \u2014 in \u2014 inside. After a couple of\nhours we went into the \u2014 look around what \u2014 what\u2019s going on, we find out nobody\u2019s\n\u2014 you know, just the both of us. We went outside to look, maybe we can do\nsomething [indecipherable] something. All of a sudden the police run after us, start\nshooting. And we run, somehow, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re young, you know, we made it.",

He was\nprobably somewhere else. And I used to tell him, we have to run away. He says to\nme, you can run.

And\nhe was killed near the Idolar(ph) Street. And I went to the partisans with a group of\n17 people, or \u2014 or 15 people maybe. How did we went \u2014 how could we go out from\nthe ghetto? We went to a policeman, a White Russian policeman and we told him\nthat the second house from here \u2014 because on the other side was the ghetto before.\nAnd now already the Germans [indecipherable] ghetto. And we wanted to take out\nthe rifles. How could we go to the partisans without \u2014 with no arms?

P\u2019Il give you 90 percent, just give me 10 percent and Ill \u2014 I \u2014 I have enough for\nApril 8, 1999\nme. He said, are \u2014 are you talking it serious? I said yeah. The White Russian said\nokay. Come tonight and[indecipherable]. We came the whole group, we were\nwaiting, and I went the first to \u2014 to see that he is not taking away the rifles from his\nshoulder, you know. He let me in. When I \u2014 he let me in, I had \u2014 before I had to\ncome out, the guys came out, couple of guys [indecipherable] and they cut him,\nyou know [indecipherable] and they cut \u2014 and they did not kill him. They did leave\nhim he couldn\u2019t talk already. Took away his rifle and threw him in a \u2014 in a place\nover there, and we took out the rifles from where we have to go, and went to the\npartisans. Took us two weeks to \u2014 to arrive the partisans. Actually shouldn\u2019t take\nmore than two, three days.",
        "Q: How did you know where to go?",
        "A: We knew.",
        "Q: How\u201d",
        "A: We had a \u2014a guy before, Mishka(ph) Salmonovicz(ph). He went out the first,\nhim and Labolitz(ph) Aitman(ph), the two s \u2014 two guys went before to the\npartisans. And when we came to the partisans and they saw they have to \u2014 rifles and\ngrenades and pistols. So the partisans thought that the Jewish people have so much\narms, we need you, we need you, come on. And then, when we come and not\neverybody has a rifle, and not everybody was young \u2014 we were young, but then\nApril 8, 1999\ncome more groups, plus the \u2014 they\u2019re like \u2014 half of them were already people 40 -\n50 \u2014 45, the partisan didn\u2019t like it. They only wanted just young. And is \u2014 in\nparticular the group what we came to were Zhorkinsis(ph), their name was\nZhorkin(ph), the commandeer was Zhorkin(ph), very anti-Semitic and very bandit\n\u2014 bandit. A very bandit. He killed Jews for \u2014 for shoes, for \u2014 for a watch, he killed\nthem. So, wh-what \u2014 what \u2014 we \u2014 when you come a whole group he couldn\u2019t do it,\nbut if he caught one or two people who run away from ghetto, he \u2014 that what he did.\nAnd he did many like this.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nApril 8, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Noah Roitman. This is tape number two, side\nA.

        "A: Yes, yeah, I saw many \u2014 I saw many of them, hungry, with bad clothes, they\ncouldn\u2019t move. They was skelets(ph), you know what skelets(ph)?",
        "Q: Skeletons?",
        "A: Skeletons. And they were mamesh(ph), never you hear somebody cry or\nsomething, just \u2014 just die from day by day, hour by hour, in thousands, and nobody\ncould help them, because if you do something for them, you were killed from the\nGermans. And another thing, maybe 10 Germans had 5,000 Russians, and they stoo\n\u2014 th-they didn\u2019t stoo-stood up. Just [indecipherable] about it. Why didn\u2019t it \u2014 they\nkill them? They\u2019d killed thousands, the rest was run already to the woods. But when\nwe came to the woods, the partisans they say, you gave away the \u2014 to the Germans\nyour gold, your parents and your money and now you come here to us, we should \u2014\nwe should \u2014 we should keep you, we should watch you? We need partisans. We\nneed women, we need old \u2014 older men, we need arms. That was their \u2014 the we di \u2014\nApril 8, 1999\nthey \u2014 they \u2014 but we became right the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the most of the people\nthey were maybe 10 people, we were already a hundred in \u2014 in \u2014 1n a few weeks. So\nwe had [indecipherable] and we were a Jewish group.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so you didn\u2019t stay with the Russian group, you formed your own Jewish\ngroup?",
        "A: No, when we \u2014 when \u2014 when we came they want to take us the rifles and give us\nju \u2014 junk what they had find somewhere. So we said no, that\u2019s enough. They did it\nalready once to somebody, but no \u2014 not any more. So we didn\u2019t want to be with\nthem. So they were separate, and we were separate. And we become bigger, we had\n300 in the \u2014 1n no time we were \u2014 we were [indecipherable] we were good\n[indecipherable] and all the Christians used to say, you Russians, you just drink\nand you [indecipherable] you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you [indecipherable] what you\ndoing, look the Jewish guys, they go, they destroyed the railroad, they did, they\nbring people that they all over. What are you doing over here, sleeping? Who needs\nyou over here? The goyim used to say this. So they were afraid that something will\nhappen, so they \u2014 and \u2014 and the Russian, a lot of Russian prisoners run away. Five,\n10, 10, you more, more, more, more, and the ghettos was empty already. So they\nbecome m-more than us, how you call it, you know. How you sa \u2014 say it in English?\nMine English is not so good. In the beginning they were \u2014 they fight, 10 \u2014 10\nApril 8, 1999\npartisans [indecipherable] three, four Jews, and then they come more Jews. The\n[indecipherable], how you call it?",
        "Q: Well, your group became larger than theirs.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 so th-they want us to \u2014 to be together, and we didn't want it, but by\nthe time we were 300, they were already 3,000 all of a sudden. And the\n[indecipherable], the Germans used to burn the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the [indecipherable] I\ncall it, the farms, [indecipherable] partisans. And everything toge \u2014 altogether they\nbecome a lot. So we had to become one group, because otherwise they would fight\nwith us. So we didn\u2019t want to fight, so we decide okay, we\u2019ll work with you, we\u2019ll\nbe [indecipherable] Ill be the sergeant. I \u2014 I just \u2014 there should be quiet, you know.\nBut all the jobs we had to do, they were sitting and drinking, an-and ta \u2014 and tell you\nwhat to do.

Come. And then he says, do you\nknow how to get there? You\u2019re sure, do you know the \u2014 the \u2014 the right way? Of\ncourse, I used to ride with my father for years, bring the milk from the \u2014 from the \u2014\nfrom the [indecipherable] you know, from the farms. I know. When it was dark we\ntwo quietly moved away, moved away with the \u2014 from the others, and pffft, we ran\n\u2014 we went into the ghetto.",
        "Q: How far was the ghetto from where you were?",
        "A: [indecipherable] like probably maybe 20 kilometers, something. And we came\ninto the ghetto, he \u2014",
        "Q: What was left in the ghetto?",
        "A: You \u2014 you ha you have li \u2014 you have another probably 10,000 people left, maybe\nmore. So he went to his friend \u2014 his friend and I went to see my uncle, I still had a\nuncle from my mommy\u2019s side. But we went to the ghetto in these houses, my aunt\ncame over there, I\u2014 I knock on the door and my uncle wake up, he says, who is\nthis? I said me. He says to me, I thought you were already dead. Everybody said you\nwere di \u2014 you dead, they killed you. How come you alive? And he fall then on me\nfor \u2014 from his place, and he start crying. I said, Uncle, don\u2019t cry, prepare yourself. I\ncouldn\u2019t talk because if I talked to him, every \u2014 the whole \u2014 the whole house would\n\u2014 would run \u2014 like to run to [indecipherable]. Can I take from the hundreds of\nApril 8, 1999\npeople into \u2014 to the partisans? What shall I do? I\u2019m asking you. And\n[indecipherable] question, you told me before not to ask questions. What can you\ndo? Ica\u2014I-\u2014I-I left \u2014 right away I saw I am \u2014 I have problems, you know. If Pll\nstay here they \u2014 they gonna eat me up. And what \u2014 everybody wants to life \u2014 they\nwant to live. I'll \u2014 I left this place and I went to other place and hide \u2014 in hiding.\nAnd I came to my friend I told him the story. He says no, it\u2019s no good, we gotta take\neverybody. Be \u2014 over here, hundreds of people are waiting already. I don\u2019t know\nhow we\u2019re gonna get out from the ghetto. They\u2019re watching every step of us\n[indecipherable] like that. We had to leave. We had to leave the ghetto at night and\ntell the people how to get out from \u2014 from the job that they working. They should\ncome on the \u2014 to \u2014 on the Polish cemetery behind the city, and we\u2019ll be there, and\nwe'll come over there when they \u2014 by like 10 o\u2019clock at night. In the meantime, we\nhad one Polack, his name was Hatcha(ph). He was one Polack in the city who\nhelped Jews. And says, whenever you go out or you come, you can go to my place\nwhere my car is there, and you can sit and wait over or whatever you need to do,\nstay there, with no problems. It was very nice of him. So we went there and we\nwaited over, and then we went to the \u2014 by 10 o\u2019clock we went to the Polish \u2014",
        "Q: Cemetery.\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: \u2014 cemetery, and we say three [indecipherable] [whistles]. They understood, they\ncame out and we took them and we went to the partisans. We came to the partisans",
        "Q: Okay, how many people were in the group?",
        "A: 17.",
        "Q: And who were they?",
        "A: I\u2014I think you got here the names, I said, my wife is the first, and then two sister,\nLuba(ph) and S-Simma(ph) Mandel. And then sh \u2014 a couple \u2014",

        "A: All young. All young between 17 to 25 maybe.",
        "Q: So you knew your \u2014 your future wife at that point?",
        "A: I knew, but \u2014",
        "Q: How did you know her?",
        "A: I know her because she run away from Poland 1939 and she came to her aunt \u2014\nto her uncle. Her uncle married my \u2014 my cousin in 1938 and he came to America.\nSo when they broke \u2014 when the war broke out, she saw with the Germans beating up\nshi \u2014 Jewish children in her little place, so she decide to run away, came to us. So\nshe was in a different place, but I know her, I \u2014 so I said, if I can t-take her, why\nshouldn\u2019t I? And \u2014 because she was actually working with the whole group on one\nApril 8, 1999\nplace. They used to wash for the Germans officers the \u2014 the clothes. So they said to\ngo back to the group and come to the ghetto, they went \u2014 couple \u2014 couple of us\nbefore that, in hiding and then di \u2014 they went to the cemetery. So I had to take the\nwhole group, but I don\u2019t know the people, I didn\u2019t know. I know maybe five, six,\nseven people, maybe. I didn't know even.",
        "Q: So you and \u2014 were the \u2014 the two leaders brought these people back to the\npartisans?",
        "A: Excuse us?",
        "Q: You said you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you led these people back to the partisans at night?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, at night. It took us more, took us two days to come. It was 70\nkilometer. And then from 10 o\u2019clock at night until four o\u2019clock in the morning\n[indecipherable] young people hungry a little bit, and a little tired, you cannot\nmake 70 kilometer, it\u2019s hard. And the snow was like this. So we had to come to a\nplace and we had a man in a \u2014 in a place we called Ouchosse(ph). And in this place\nthey had a man, a Russian guy who came, the first World War II, he married a\nWhite Russian, and his name was Matt Rosov(ph). And he was the guy who told us\nall this. I sent my son to the police, so nobody will think that I will let Jewish\npartisans in here. And this way we used to come and with the cows, used to stay.\nWe open \u2014 we knew how to open and get in, take hay, lay down sleep over and next\nApril 8, 1999\nday in the evening, we used to go. Come in the \u2014 that day we came to the partisans\nand we arrived at the partisans, the group looked, five to six ladies, no arms, just\ntwo \u2014 two pistols or some, and they said, who needs ladies, who needs Jews? It was\n\u2014 was a\u2014a-\u2014it was a\u2014 you know, we need, arms we need, we don\u2019t need these\nthings. And they wanted to kill me because th-the \u2014 you was organize this, you.\nBecause they knew all the time I used to say, let me go to the ghetto, to bring people\nout, bring arms, bring this. So they knew that I \u2014 I am the [indecipherable] I was a\n[indecipherable] to me \u2014 talk to \u2014 to go, I \u2014 before I \u2014 they knew tha \u2014 I went\nalready. So, they knew that I \u2014 I was the one, but they didn\u2019t kill me, but they had a\neye on me and that next time what \u2014 what to do.",
        "Q: Were you wearing any kind of uniform?",
        "A: Just a\u2014 ab \u2014a blue jacket and still, I call it boots. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: What did you do with that Jewish star you had to wear?",
        "A: We had \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we were \u2014 we were clean, we were washing. We washed\nevery day in cold water.",
        "Q: No, no, the Jewish star that you were \u2014 you had to wear before in the ghetto,\nwhat did you do with it?\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable]. Well, maybe not, maybe I had it, because we had to go in\n\u20141in the ghetto back again, back and forth. I\u2014 I \u2014- I k \u2014I keeped it, I think, a long\ntime. And then it was a little quiet.",
        "Q: Wha-What was the name of the \u2014 of the commandeer of this partisan group?",
        "A: This time \u2014",
        "Q: The Russian commandeer.",
        "A: Bogachev(ph). This time [indecipherable] commandeer was Bogachev(ph) the\ncommandeer. And \u2014",
        "Q: And the Jewish leader was?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t already this \u2014 this \u2014 the Jewish leader jus \u2014 Jewish leader already was\nkilled. What was happen, the group who took us in the beginning, the\nZhorkins(ph), what I said, they murderers, they were o \u2014 that time already like 30\npeople. And they didn\u2019t accept no Russian, no Polack, no nobody, they were just\ntheir group, all Russians, anti-Semites. And they wer \u2014 group was separate. We\nwere already few hundred people. So they decide one day that the Germans\nsupposed to come to check the roads and the railroads, so we want to go with the\ncrossfire there from [indecipherable] from the other side, and they were gonna kill\nthem. But that\u2019s what they did. Moma Kopelowicz was our commandeer. We went\nlike maybe 20 - 30 people, we were sitting in one end of the [indecipherable] and\nApril 8, 1999\nthey sit on the other side, the \u2014 the \u2014 the Russian, the Zhorkinses(ph). By the time\nthe Germans arrive, they quietly left us alone. So when we asked \u2014 asked fire from\nthis side, right, they ca \u2014 they turn around and came from the other side where the\nRussians supposed to be. And was a lot of \u2014 I-lot [indecipherable] between them.\nThey jump in \u2014 into the woods, arms they have so much, they shot on us for an\nhour, millions of \u2014 of bullets. And we were watching every bullet we had, we \u2014 we\nwatch to be perfect, you know. [clears throat] Excuse me. And all of a sudden, my\nfriend Kopelowicz shot a [indecipherable] in his head and he fall down. And a \u2014\nand a second one he was wounded, and then the third one shot him. So our friend\nMoma took out his \u2014 his [indecipherable] and he want to cover his \u2014 his \u2014 so he\nwas with his hand [indecipherable] like this on his head and that\u2019s the way they\nfall. We made it until the evening, in the evening we came. We took off all the\nblood all around him, we made a kevir(ph), we say Kaddish, and we let him, the\nfirst ca \u2014 the first kalban(ph), the first casualty we had. And then, from then we n \u2014\nwe knew that\u2019s a war, we have to \u2014 we\u2019|l have casualties, we got to get used to it. It\nwas very hard for us, because in so many hundred and thousands of people were\nkilled in the ghetto, it wasn\u2019t so shocked like here in the woods. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Wha-What\u2019s the difference?\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: Because over here we \u2014 we were like partisans, we \u2014 we fighting the Germans.\nThey cannot kill us, we got to kill them. So it was \u2014 and he was the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n[indecipherable], he was [indecipherable] it was a shock. But then we get used to\nit, people get killed, it\u2019s a war. They killed, they \u2014 we kill and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the way\nit goes. And then from then \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what were the daily living conditions like? Where did you sleep?",
        "A: The living condition, the first time we sleep under the sky, under the trees. We\nused to take the ha \u2014 the dry wood, branches and make a fire and \u2014 and \u2014 and cook\nlike soup. Some meat or some fish or some fish or some this, we \u2014 we took away\nfrom the Christian population. But after being a half a year already, we went deep\ninto the German zones and we took horses and cows and pigs, and whatever you\nwant to have. And we had like a farm in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 1n the woods. And Jews,\nyou know, they made already milk, cheeses and \u2014 and [indecipherable] an-and\nmeat, and it was \u2014 people, maybe 10 working and preparing everything. Sh \u2014 new\nshoes, new hairs, new clothes, and some people the arms, and th-th \u2014 a factory\nbecome 1-in \u2014 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in less than a year. You wouldn\u2019t believe what there \u2014 a\nhospital we built under \u2014 under the earth, deep and from the trees we had air. The\ntrees were so big, but very old, so you could see the sky.",
        "Q: So you had one location, you were not always moving.\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: No, no, we \u2014 wa \u2014 one \u2014 one location. This is what one location, was a very good\nplace. We call it Ostrow(ph). Why we call it Ostrow(ph)? In Russian is a place\nwhere all around the swamps. And one place in the center, or more or less in the\ncenter, is higher. This place is dry. So we used to live in these places. And over\nthere be you \u2014 for winter, we \u2014 we prepare houses 50 percent inside the earth, and\n50 percent covered with wood, right, and we used to take away from the Germans\nbenzene(ph) or \u2014 or things like this. So we had a [indecipherable] in side, one side\nopen with many holes, put wood and we were burning all of 24 hours. Was warm,\nbeautiful. And a lot of posts, posts every hundred meter, every thousand meter,\nevery 1500 meter, every 2,000 meter. And then, th-the \u2014 when we became already\nstrong, we had the radios an-and wit \u2014 big radios and what \u2014 music and dancing like\n\u2014 like a normal family. Yeah, because the Russians send us paratroopers and they\ncame with radios and \u2014 and many things. And since then \u2014",
        "Q: So Russian soldiers kept joining you?",
        "A: Yes, we had the Russians \u2014 I told you, we have the Russians and Jews together,\nit\u2019s no \u2014 no more are Jews separate.",
        "Q: No, no, no, no, but Russians soldiers would join you, continue to join \u2014 come\ninto the group?\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: Yeah, a lot. Jews wasn\u2019t there already any more, because almost the Jews \u2014\nsome, a gr \u2014 little \u2014 maybe after the second [indecipherable] already was nothing\nleft, one group 200, one group 500, who was to work for the Germans. They were \u2014\nmost just were killed already.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But we \u2014 we \u2014 we wanted to take care of the Jews too, take them out. So \u2014",
        "Q: What were your thoughts when you heard about the second and third selections\nin the ghetto?",
        "A: We went, let\u2019s say, to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to the ghetto few times, and we knew that this \u2014\nthis will happen. So I went tha \u2014 over there, and instead to take a whole group, I\ntook out two \u2014 two people. Bayla(ph) Trebovicz(ph) and Tuvia(ph) Narnek(ph). I\ntook them v \u2014 all the people went already to the [indecipherable] they took them to\nkill, and I took the two girls and went out from the ghetto, and I don\u2019t know what\nthe mazla(ph) had, they didn\u2019t caught us.",
        "Q: Wh-Why did you pick them? How did you decide?",
        "A: There was one had a \u2014 a \u2014 a husband in the \u2014 in the partisans and the second had\na brother. And they were prepared we should take them, so I \u2014 I \u2014 they send me to\ntake them. I want to take them more, but I couldn\u2019t. See, it was a situation that \u2014",
        "Q: How did you handle your fear when you were doing something like this?\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: I [indecipherable] no fear.",
        "Q: How is it you had no fear?",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it didn\u2019t bother me, I \u2014 I \u2014 the only thing was \u2014 I was \u2014 wanted it to do,\nis to kill Germans, and my role was to destroy them. They destroy me. I remember\nmy father used to say, if somebody will be alive, remember what they did to us. And\nafter they killed my father, I was [indecipherable] the yeshiva from school. I\nbecame a lion, I wasn\u2019t afraid for nothing. Always I used to be the first, jump into\nthe fire like a hell. How many times I had bullets in my \u2014 in my head, 1-in my arms\nover here [indecipherable]. I \u2014 I never was wounded, never.",
        "Q: Did you ever kill anybody\u201d?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I had to. I had no choice.",
        "Q: This is while you were a partisan.",
        "A: I\u2014I never kill a\u2014 ara\u2014a White Russian. If I kill somebody it\u2019s because he\nwants to kill me. I\u2014 I kill a partisan too.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: Because he wanted to kill me. The jealousy on me was so big, that even Jewish\npeople were jealous. Where we go [indecipherable] successful. We were \u2014 they --\nlike I told you before, they went to \u2014 to the ghetto too. We come to the ghetto f-five\n[indecipherable] he came back. He used to come to the partisans [indecipherable].\nApril 8, 1999\nSo I \u2014 an-and 1n their look they\u2019re like Christians, the people who went to the\nghetto, people who most \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t, my nose, you can see, like a Jew. I said, I am\nnot afraid with my no \u2014 my Jewish nose, I \u2014 I\u2019ll go an-and I'll be \u2014 PII do it. And I \u2014\nI \u2014I did. I had mazel, I had mazel. Let\u2019s say I \u2014 I had mazel. I save a lot of people, I\nsave maybe, I would say 70 to 80 people I \u2014 I saved out \u2014 fr-from ghetto to take it\nout.",
        "Q: S-S \u2014 70 to 80?",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I went maybe five, six times into the ghetto.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And all the time \u2014 all the time I came out perfectly. Whenever they send me to\ndestroy the jer \u2014 the Germans railroad or bridges, never one man \u2014 I was always the\nresponsible man for the group, and never somebody hit \u2014 was hit from my \u2014 my \u2014\nmine \u2014 mine people, never.",
        "Q: And you were given orders to do these different sabotage?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I \u2014 I\u2014 when \u2014 when the Russians came from Moscow, they teach us\nhow to put mines, how to use arms. So a lot of people doing it, but you see, is not\nwhat is \u2014 is afraid, he is shaky, he is shameful. And \u2014 but a lot of people were like\nApril 8, 1999\ncome on, it\u2019s my life, that\u2019s \u2014 I have to d\u2014I have a chance now to take\n[indecipherable]. I have a chance, do it. But not too many. Not too many, because\nthis was de \u2014 you know, when you leave your woods, you\u2019re in danger for death.\nAnd people were afraid. Probably I di \u2014 I had \u2014 I wasn\u2019t smart enough, yeah.",
        "Q: Was there any particular experience that was extremely \u2014 more dangerous than\nothers?",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was a time that people have tsinga(ph). The teeth fa \u2014 start bending\nand the \u2014 because we didn\u2019t have salt. Now, I have to get salt, we have to get into\nthe German zone, and the Germans, let\u2019s say two, three kilometer from the \u2014 from\nthe farms, they used to give them sugar and \u2014 and salt and \u2014 and salt, everything. 10\n- 15 kilometer deeper they didn\u2019t give nothing, because they want them to die to\n[indecipherable] partisans. So I took a group. Myself, my cousin Arnold(ph)\nSheefis(ph) and Sam Averkovicz(ph) and Davidal(ph) Winarnik(ph) and we went,\nfour guys, young people. We went and we start taking from the ri \u2014 to a gor \u2014 we\ncame to a place with \u2014 very near, maybe two, three kilometer from the Germans. We\nknock on the door, don\u2019t open the light, give us all the salt you have in the house.\nAhh! One more word you killed and the house is going on fire. The lady brings 10\nkilograms salt. And from house to house and house to house, I\u2019m think we went to \u2014\nthe last house that would have to go back we see, so further from the police. We\nApril 8, 1999\ncame over there with a hundred kilogram. This is shre \u2014 hi -- heavy for four people,\nis 25 kilo for each. We came with that, it\u2019s almost morning, we took off the shoes,\nwe Start cleaning out the rifles, and we asked the owner should give us our coffee or\ntea, something to eat. And we were eating, and no shoes on us. And she said,\nchildren, Germans. [indecipherable] a big window, Germans. I said,\n[indecipherable] fire. We let them come close and [indecipherable] fire to the\nwindows, like this. [makes gunfire sound]. And we jump up and go back house\nand they open a fire. You know, they\u2019re \u2014 it \u2014 it what to shoot. And we took the salt\nand we [indecipherable] the shoes, and it was winter. So we run away ina-\u2014ina\nplace where the \u2014 it was a \u2014 a wat \u2014 water, and on top on the water it was like a\nwooden bridge, and under this was lower places on a lot of branches. Our mazel\nthey didn\u2019t have docks. We went under the branches, and they come too look for us\nand they went further and we were sitting freezing all winter day with the salt. In the\nevening we were so hungry and \u2014 and \u2014 and thirsty and from \u2014 I call it the \u2014I-I\ncannot [indecipherable] in English, from [indecipherable] is all, we went out. We\nstood up, look around, not [indecipherable] we went to the first Christian house,\ntell them to give us hot soup and give us shoes. He say he hasn\u2019t got no shoes. Give\nus food, and wa \u2014 you haven\u2019t got shoes? I remember I was so mad on him, he said\nhe had no shoes. I caught him like this and I gave him a knock. He \u2014 I pushed him to\nApril 8, 1999\nthe lext \u2014 next wall. He was running b-b-b-b-b-back. Fall down and I put \u2014 took off\nhis shoes, put them in my sh \u2014 my feet. So he said to me, don\u2019t kill me please. And\nhe give us so much things for everybody, shoes and \u2014 and clothes and he become\nsoft and good. Then we said to him, now we taking your horse. By a Christian\n[indecipherable] horse. He had two, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t take. We took away the\nhorse and we took a\u2014 a\u2014acow and put everything \u2014 salt on this and we went to the\nwoods. To \u2014 we \u2014 we came home, we were heroes. We got salt, ay yi yi yi yi. When\nth-the commandeer came he said I \u2014 he kiss me and he says to me, Noah from today\non your name 1s not Noah. Today ma \u2014 you are Nikolai(ph). This is a little \u2014 little\nstory but this is very \u2014 then \u2014 then th \u2014 the second time I took the same group. And\none of the group, the Averkovicz(ph), Sam Averkovicz(ph) has parents in \u2014 in the\nwoods, a father and a mother from Baranowicze. They told me I should take this\ngroup because I am so successful I \u2014 I should go to find out, because couple\npartisans were killed \u2014 [phone ringing, tape break] \u2014 couple days before, couple\npartisans went to destroy the railroad and the electricity and one of our friends,\nYakov Press(ph) were killed. When they start cutting the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\ncolumn from the electricity to the da\u2014 Germans put a mine. All of a sudden the\nmine destroy, and a-a \u2014 op \u2014 hi \u2014 has \u2014 his head was off. So we took him on the\nrifles and brought him back to the partisans. And then they send me, I should find\nApril 8, 1999\nout who did it. So I went with these three guys. I didn\u2019t want old, I want young kids,\nwhat I say is \u2014 is holy, cause I knew, the young kids, they underst \u2014 not understand\n[indecipherable]. Older one thinks, I will not go, I can be afraid, Pll \u2014 I find it out\nvery short \u2014 in the very beginning, and I said, that\u2019s it, no \u2014 just with these ki \u2014 guys\nI go. And I came to Matrosov(ph) [indecipherable] but he was a Russian, he came\nin the first war took, and he \u2014 he married a White Russian shi \u2014 goya and we went to\n\u2014I went over there and I told him, Mr. Matrosov(ph), we got to find out, your\nneighbors who \u2014 some of them told to the Germans about the group who went to\ndestroy the railroad and they caught him and they killed him. And the \u2014 and the\nJewish guy with another gun, who went to \u2014 to destroy the electricity was killed,\nwas too much, you know, for us to take. And he finded out who \u2014 who \u2014 who did it,\nand we went t-to this guy at night, had two \u2014 two chil \u2014 two daughters, teachers, and\na son in the police by \u2014 by the Germans. And went to the house, the \u2014 the dogs start\nbarking and he came out, he was \u2014 was sure that\u2019s probably policia, so non \u2014\nnobody \u2014 partisans would come here. I told him to take in the dog, she shouldn\u2019t\nbark and should be quiet. He said, wh-who are you, police? [indecipherable] we are\npolice from Moscow. [indecipherable] he became red. [indecipherable] n-nothing.\nAnd I looks up and he brought his daughters dressed to the table and they give us \u2014\nwant to give us a good time, you know. They prepare food. They prepared food and\nApril 8, 1999\nwe ate, and we drink, even enjoy it. And then I said to him, you see, you did this and\nthis and this and you did this and this through your two daughters. You all three get\nkilled with one bullet. And they put them head to head, three \u2014 all three of them on\nthe floor, and one bullet destroyed them all three. The older lady, the m \u2014 his wife\nstart to screaming, so I didn\u2019t want to do it nothing, but we put the whole house on\nfire with [indecipherable] she get burned anyway. We took away the horse and\nwhat we can loaded on the horses, and back again. Paid them off. But many \u2014 man \u2014\nmany things that wasn\u2019t so easy. What I am saying 1s just ah \u2014 but this was taking\ndays to do, to figure out everything and be sure that\u2019s you\u2019re doing right, right? So.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Noah Roitman. This is tape two, side B, and\nwe ve been talking about your experiences with the partisans.",
        "A: I forgot to tell you about when we were a group from Bogachev(ph) and then\nfrom Bogachev(ph) went to the east. So we were left a group with I would say like\nmaybe a hundred people, 80 people were left. What was happening?",
        "Q: Was this Jewish and Russian partisans together?\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: Yes, together. That was the time when we were already in Bogachev\u2019s(ph)\ngroup. Bogachev(ph) was the commandeer.",
        "Q: The Russian commandeer.",
        "A: Right. And he decides to go east, why? I told you before that one of the Jewish\nguys [indecipherable], his name. Hm. Oh, no, no, no, I have to tell you \u2014 tell his\nname. Excuse me a minute, I \u2014 [tape break] I told you before about eza \u2014\nEliezer(ph) Lidovsky(ph), who didn\u2019t want us to leave the ghetto the first \u2014 he was\na older person, had a family in the ghetto and he \u2014 it was true that he will be the first\narriving in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the woods. When he was like second hand by ku \u2014\nBogachev(ph), he used to tell him to do this and get that, tell him stories with\n[indecipherable]. But he didn\u2019t do anything good for anybody. So he \u2014 you \u2014 he\nused to say that if he went as a \u2014 with his face as a goy, and he couldn\u2019t go into the\nghetto, how could I go to the ghetto? And we had a little \u2014 you know, I said to him,\nI am younger, I am stronger than you, I can do it better than you. He didn\u2019t like it.\nAnd when he was such an important man but a commandeer, so I was nothing, and\nh-he wanted to get rid of me somehow, it \u2014 every \u2014 every \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t be in\nbetween, you know? So when the \u2014 the commandeers came in \u2014 in from Moscow,\nwas a commandeer Muha(ph). Muha(ph) is a fly in Russian. He was telling us,\nwhen you go to do something near the Germans, you should know. He gave you a\nApril 8, 1999\nlittle speech. This 1s our land and you should be like a lion. The Germans are\nnothing. Today they are here. In a month, a half a year, in two years they will be\nback in Germany, and we will be in our [indecipherable] here. So you \u2014 he gave\nyou such a impetus to \u2014 to fight, to do something. And young people my type were\nvery encouraged, you know. So when I used to come and do things and that and that\nand all the young people used to come to him and say you [indecipherable] you\u2019re\ndoing nothing, look Noah. With a Jewish nose, he \u2014 he said, he \u2014 he does\neverything. So they \u2014 they wanted to get rid of me, and they \u2014 and they went get rid\nof me. And they send me out to a group who came near Pinsk, and the commandeer\nwas Igor. Igor, when I came to them was plain Russian, all from Moscow.\nMoscow, Leningrad \u2014",
        "Q: Yo-You went \u2014 you were the only one to leave to go to Igor?",
        "A: I was the only one, in Jewish. And I came over there, I see all of a sudden, three\n\u2014my \u2014 from my city, three guys, Worlansky(ph) Eller(ph), Worlansky(ph)\nSimcha(ph), and Worlansky(ph) Abrusha(ph) the youngster, my friend. When I\nsaw them, they said, Noah, where you come from? I said, my group send me over\nhere. I\u2014 he \u2014 they said, what you gonna do? I said, we\u2019re gonna go to destroy the \u2014\nthe railroad here. They said, we have so many people, they know everything. I said,\nI know, too. They said, how do you know\u201d I said, I am already a year and a half in\nApril 8, 1999\nthe partisans, it\u2019s time to learn. They just came, they were just new-coming from \u2014\nthey were [indecipherable] in a \u2014 in a place hid \u2014 hide \u2014 hiding. Okay. Over there\nwas groups, 12 - 15 people groups, and the commandeer was a Russian officer and\nthe rest was all Russians. And they took us, me and the hi \u2014 the younger,\nAbrusha(ph), my friend to the same group. And we went at night. They give us\nclothes forsta \u2014 first of all and machine guns, and good, everything perfect, to be\ndressed like a mensch with grenade, with a pistol, with \u2014 like a mensch you\ndressed, and got arms. They give you a little education what you can do, and which\nbombs you have to put under \u2014 under the railroad. So we came out, over there was\nfive people sitting behind a water. Water was up \u2014 water was he \u2014 to here. So the\nGermans never thought that we\u2019ll be going seven kilometer into the \u2014 into the\nswamp to here to destroy the railroads. So they \u2014 they left this \u2014 this zone open. We\ncame over there vert \u2014 [indecipherable] seven kilometer at night to go, you know,\nand I was short so I had to go with two shtettins I shouldn\u2019t fall in. We came on the\nother side, we were like fi-five people, the communists said, Noah [indecipherable]\nBaloja(ph), you both go to put the mines. Baloja(ph) said to the commandeer, him,\nhe\u2019s Jewish, he doesn\u2019t know ho-how to put mines. I\u2019m not going. So he says, step\naway, right away. In Russia there\u2019s not such a thing you\u2019re not going. So he said,\nwho wants to go? And my friend Abrusha(ph), he \u2014 he \u2014 I\u2019m going with Noah. So\nApril 8, 1999\nwe went both, we put on the mine, you know, we had to dig out the hole, put the\nmine deep that they smell th \u2014 from the dogs, the dogs shouldn\u2019t be able to smell it.\nPut a metal like a half a meter deep. When the railroad come and just a little critch\nis up in the air. We did it, came back and now \u2014 in couple hours after they left the \u2014\nthe swamps, boom [indecipherable]. So the \u2014 the Russian came to me, he said I\u2019m\nsorry, I didn\u2019t know you know how t \u2014 how to \u2014 how to \u2014 the \u2014 they say Jewish\npeople don\u2019t know how to fight. I say, well you\u2019re right, Jewish people don\u2019t know.\nWhat they don\u2019t know, they know. [indecipherable] instead. And I was there with\nthem fighting every night, some other place, some other place, some other place.\nNot fighting with guns, with \u2014 with pistols, just bombs and bombs and bombs. We\ndestroy them like dogs every night a \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 a transport, every night a transport.\nYou know what it is, night \u2014 arms we had, how much we want. Food, the best. It\nwas sitting a whole week every day, then we went back to the grou \u2014 to the\n[indecipherable] near Pinsk. Come there, change clothes, the best shower in the\nworld. Food is unbelievable, the cook was from Hungary [indecipherable] in \u2014 in\norder to cook good food for the commandeer.",

And all of a sudden\nsome Ukrainian about something, start with \u2014 with this [indecipherable] of mine,\nmy friend, my Bilmis(ph) and he told him \u2014 I said, this is this and then he said to\nhim \u2014 to the je \u2014 to the Bilmis(ph), you are parshiva(ph) Jew. You are pig \u2014 pig\nJew. He took the pistol out and he [indecipherable] just shot him on \u2014 on the place.\nEverybody was \u2014 Bilmis(ph) such a officer, such a quiet, such a intelligent. He said,\nI couldn\u2019t take it. I can see my friends all die in the part \u2014 1n the partisans and in the\nghettoes and a Ukrainian like this, who worked together with the Germans, he\u2019s\n[indecipherable] he\u2019|l told me I am a dirty Jew, he cannot live any more on this\nworld [indecipherable] The general \u2014 the general came, he said, [indecipherable]\nBilmis [speaks Russian] friend, what punishment you want? He said, send me on\nApril 8, 1999\nthe front. He said, you got it. Normally, he said, we killing. You should be killed.\nAnd he send him [indecipherable] by Berlin if he \u2014 there was \u2014 he was killed. Was\na big tragedy for all of us because he said, when the war will be over, we\u2019ll all meet\ntogether and we\u2019ll go [indecipherable] to Israel. And that\u2019s aft \u2014 in the \u2014 I was, and\nthat\u2019s the way we \u2014 we went on the front. I went to artillery on the front, and they se\n\u2014 they send me on a course, on this place where I was, I was on a course for a\ncouple of weeks to learn artillery. It\u2019s a minamyot(ph), you know what\nminamyot(ph) and artill \u2014 artillery too. I learn so good, I knew it, I was proud of\nmyself that I learned the way it should be. And I became a sergeant and they send\nme on the front. Send me on the front to white rush \u2014 to shuko(ph) White Russian \u2014\nfirst White Russian front. I came into a place, my general was Plachin(ph), my\ncommandeer was 99 Guardia(ph) artilleriskipolk (ph) and I was Sergeant\nRoitman on the third battery. And since then I fought with all of them until we\ncame to Berlin. But in between, when we be \u2014 didn\u2019t fight, we had to go out, three\nor four people from each cannon and go and get prisoners of Germans. Sometime\nwe did, sometime we didn\u2019t, yeah. Sometime they killed us, sometime we killed\nthem. And one place \u2014 we came to a place, ot -- Ottertoti(ph) Berlin, we saw we \u2014\nthe Germans at \u2014 attack here back again. They instead \u2014 Russian attack \u2014 attack all\nthe time, but they some \u2014 somehow a group of Germans start attack sho \u2014 attack the\nApril 8, 1999\nRussian art \u2014 infantry. And they caught a group, they put all these, they call it \u2014",
        "Q: Belt?",
        "A: Belts to each other and to the hand, to the each other and they killed them out.\nAnd we came, we \u2014 we saw the Germans running and we open fire. We killed them\nall, not one was left. So it was a big tragedy. Here the \u2014 th-the 50 - 60 Germans just\nkilled maybe \u2014 maybe a hundred Russians in \u2014 in \u2014 in a minute. And over here we\ncame and we di \u2014 killed the \u2014 the \u2014 the Germans. But what \u2014 what the Germans\nwhere we ki \u2014 there were so many Russian were killed. So when the army came, the\nofficers tell me everybody was crying like children. Why, oh, thought this Berlin\nready, the last minute we \u2014 we get such a [indecipherable] they \u2014 they killed so\nmany people. It was unbelievable, they couldn\u2019t take it. And then, from then on until\nwe came to Berlin, we didn\u2019t left one German alive, not one. We had oth-other\nundefe \u2014 und \u2014 un \u2014 under \u2014 un \u2014 u-u-under our feet Germans and Russian, are\nmixed, th \u2014 because the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the fight was so intense and the\nartillery of the Russian was giving fire [indecipherable] and bombs that 1-it was a \u2014\nyou couldn\u2019t see anything, like rain before you. And whatever we saw is \u2014 was\nmixed up, until we came to Berlin. We came to Berlin, a commandeer came over,\nhe said Noah, now you see you \u2014 you have to go. Where I have to go? He said. You\ntake one cannon with 10 people and we\u2019ll push you on the ropes, because the trucks\nApril 8, 1999\ncannot go in. The fire is in \u2014 unbelievable.",
        "Q: Before you \u2014 before we get to Berlin, did you see any \u2014 did you come across any\ncamps, any labor camps?",
        "A: Yeah, it was in Lodz when we were on the Wiesel(ph) \u2014 on the Wisla. Wisla\nnear Warsaw. W-We were standing there for months, and then we pushed and we\nwent back to L\u00e9dz to see because we \u2014 we knew they still had the Jewish people\nover there. And in Warsaw we saw was everything destroyed. And from there wh \u2014\nby the way w-we went to \u2014 to Berlin, we came to a \u2014 to the water in the \u2014 the other\n[indecipherable] is like this and the Warta is like this, two waters go\n[indecipherable]. And we \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 and we had to go over on the other side in\norder to stop the ger \u2014 the Germans, they shouldn\u2019t be able to \u2014 to go \u2014 to go the\nbridge. All night long we build the bridges, you know, pontoon bridges under the\nwater. And we took lines, like oil, so the tanks can see the \u2014 the lines oil, how to get\non \u2014 on the bridge, because everything\u2019s under the water. And we came with our\ntruck, a GMC, American GMC and our cannon, 105 millimeter Howitz(ph), and\nwe were sitting on \u2014 and \u2014 and going through and all of a sudden Germans came and\nstarted bombing. And all the bridge was collapsed and our truck is in the water and\nme and one another guy ju-jump out from \u2014 on top of the water was a piece of ice,\nyou know? This was 1945 already, maybe in February, March. And we were sitting\nApril 8, 1999\non the \u2014 on the piece \u2014 on the \u2014 on the ice, and we running with the rifles wet, back\nto Kustrin where the Germans are. I said it \u2014 I am not going, I am jumping. And I\nstart jumping from one piece of ice to the other \u2014 to the other with the big clothes on\nyourself and somehow the energy made it I should be able to come on the other\nside, and we came alive, two of us. When we came on the other side they didn\u2019t\nbelieve we are alive because everybody is under the water already.",
        "Q: As you were on the move, did you see any Jewish refugees?",
        "A: Yes, I saw.",
        "Q: Did you talk to them?",
        "A: I talk.",
        "Q: And what \u2014 what did you talk about?",
        "A: Oh you \u2014 we talk that 1-1f they can be alive another day or two, and we shouldn\u2019t\n\u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they were afraid to \u2014 to eat too much, because the American in some\nplaces they didn\u2019t give them nothing, in some places they give them chocolate. The\nRussians were better, I\u2019m telling you, the Russian gave them soup. Skinny, not that\nfat, just to \u2014 to \u2014 little by little, not too much, so they \u2014 they [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you know anything about the camps at that time?",
        "A: Yeah, sure we knew. We knew everything.",
        "Q: How did you know?\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: Because the trou \u2014 Russian propaganda was \u2014 was telling us everything. Telling\nevery \u2014 we used to hear news three, four times a day.",
        "Q: And you heard of a place called Auschwitz?",
        "A: Sure. Auschwitz and Majdanek and Treblinka. And we knew that this probably\nhappened to Jews and the Russians, because they will not take American or British\nover there, that what we knew. Because all the time we had a \u2014 a [indecipherable]\nwe were afraid that one day [indecipherable] the American and the British will at-\nattack us. It was almost [indecipherable] said, the American going to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nattack us, maybe a day or two or three, it was very close to it. I don\u2019t know why it\ndid not happen, but it was on the agenda in \u2014 in \u2014 in Germany, before we took\nBerlin, because the Russian wanted to press so hard, kill how many Russians and\nGermans together, just to be the first in Berlin. And they did. And we have to be the\nfirst, we have to be the first and push and push. This what I\u2019m telling you is nothing.\nIf I would tell you stories how many days and nights we didn\u2019t sleep, we didn\u2019t eat,\nwe had to fight and fight. Some places we had hills, where the Germans give us fire\nhell. We couldn\u2019t go up the hill. We have to shot for days, you know, in order to get\nthrough to these places, because the Germans were so defendable. They had\n[indecipherable] arms, and \u2014 and \u2014 and good soldiers.",
        "Q: When you were fighting the Germans, were you fighting as a Jew, or were you\nApril 8, 1999\nfighting as a Russian soldier?",
        "A: Well, in my heart I was a Jew, but with the clothes and everything, he \u2014 I was a\nRussian soldier, of course. I couldn\u2019t say \u2014 say \u2014 when \u2014 when I f\u2014 when I get the\nGermans prisoners. So I tell them [speaks German]. He never responded, he never\nsay anything. He thought I am going to kill him a lot. I didn\u2019t touch him, I didn\u2019t do\nnothing to him because I had a order not to do anything. To kill, somebody else will\nkill him, but not me. And if he \u2014 if he a \u2014 he was a general, he wouldn\u2019t even speak\nto a [indecipherable] he wants a general to speak to. Such a chutzpah from the\nGermans y-you wouldn\u2019t believe, yeah. Unheardable, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the respect\nfor [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So \u2014 so now you\u2019re in the outs \u2014 on the outskirts of Berlin?",
        "A: Now \u2014 now we have to go into Berlin, so he says to me, Noah, you take y \u2014 nine\npeople and you will commandeer, and we\u2019ll bring you at night into the city. What\nyou have to do, the first floor everywhere is already Russian soldiers. The second\nfloor, third, Germans. How do we get rid of the Germans, how \u2014 how can we do it,\nwe cannot send our people with \u2014 with rifles? What can \u2014 what can do our infantry\nmen? If we go up, it\u2019ll [indecipherable], it\u2019ll kill them. Now, on every cross is\nsnipers. The Germans killed every Russian, couldn\u2019t go through. So the only thing,\nat night we\u2019ll bring the [indecipherable] and you\u2019ll start shooting in the houses, and\nApril 8, 1999\nthat what we did. We did it for a few days. We destroyed houses, second and third\nfloor mish-mash. So maybe I kill a German [indecipherable] too, I don\u2019t know.\nWhat do you think? So after maybe \u2014 by a week, we couldn\u2019t move the \u2014 the \u2014 th-\nthe machines to other place, because if we would move they would kill us, the\nsnipers. So we stood over there until I heard a shrapnel is coming. A \u2014 when I knew\nwhen the shrapnel is coming, one behind me and one in the side of me, and one\nbefore of me, I knew the [indecipherable] will get into me. So I said to the guys,\nlet\u2019s jump 1n into the \u2014 into the places where the bombs fell before. And we didn\u2019t\nhave a chance to jump out and an air cannon, boom, and nine people were killed in\n\u2014 in one shot. One guy was his head split in half, and I was wounded, but I det \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t feel nothing. I took my [indecipherable] and take his head, it \u2014 1t shouldn\u2019t\nfall apart [indecipherable] ban-bandaged it, and I call for help should come, we \u2014\nwe had nothing. And they used to be in touch with us thr-through telephone. All of a\nsudden the telephone was e \u2014 e \u2014 not in contact. There I knew already so something\nhappened. This was like five in the evening, we found out afterwards \u2014 at this time.\nAnd we were wait \u2014 li-li \u2014 sitting and waiting until 11 o\u2019clock at night they came\nwith that big American truck, and they took us out both, and they took us to\nSchoeneichel(ph). This is Forstit(ph), a little village before Berlin. And they took\nit over there and you see doctors 1-in red, all the clothes is red from \u2014 from blood.\nApril 8, 1999\nAnd you see with the cut hands, legs, people operate \u2014 operate on the field. And I \u2014\nI sa \u2014 I said, oh, I\u2019m nothing. Came to me later somebody with a \u2014 with a scissor,\nstarts cutting my head, I was wounded here, I was wounded here, I was wounded\nhere. I said, a little needle, or something, 1-in Russian, he said, don\u2019t talk nothing.\nWe gonna save your life, otherwise you\u2019re gonna die. And they cut what they did\nwhatever the thing they \u2014 I scream to the \u2014 to the sky, and took me to the hospital. I\n\u2014 took \u2014 took me to hospital. I went to the hospital, I look, full of Germans, full of\nRussians. Full. I took me \u2014 and I look to my \u2014 said to myself [indecipherable] I\u2019m\nalive, maybe they \u2014 I\u2019ll be alive. So the May fifth, three days before the war was\nover, my friend die. He was \u2014 had the split head before, he \u2014 me \u2014 he die. So we had\nnothing left, just me. And I said, my God, I \u2014 I had \u2014 I have no sense t \u2014 of crying,\nor of begging or this. And I cried and said [indecipherable] ah, I am alive. I want to\nsee this \u2014 th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the end of Hitler and then I should die, you know? And I\nwas alive, a-and I ke \u2014 wake up. And my sister came to me, and I see sh \u2014 chocolate\nunder my head, apple. How come? One day, two days, three days, I k \u2014 the best\nfood. In one week I was already ou \u2014 in hospital a \u2014 moving around the hospital.\nAnd they \u2014 they give me some clothes, you know, [indecipherable] and I went to\nthe city.

You see, the whole pi \u2014 the whole politic is against the Jews anyway right\n\u2014 right after the war. So, I would never believe this will happen, but that\u2019s what\nhappen. And then after we \u2014 I c \u2014 we came to Israel in 1946 and th-they \u2014 they took\nus back to ca \u2014 C-Cyprus, right.",

He says to me, you dog, you stay because I am\ngonna smash you with my pistol, you fascist. I said to him, I am Jewish, I am\nwounded May 5\", 1945 from the Germans and you don\u2019t tell me I am fascist. Don\u2019t\ntalk to me like that. I said, I am not afraid for you stomping your f \u2014 your feet like\nthat. I fought for myself. I am deserving something better than this. Not you should\nApril 8, 1999\ntalk to me like that. Take him out, this dog, take him out. Took me out. Took me out\na little truck, and then come out two, three other people, and between the other three\nwas one Meyer(ph) Boldusov(ph). Meyer(ph) Boldusov(ph). He wasn\u2019t Jewish, he\nwas Russian. And he says, when you were answering this, so I was behind you, and\nI heard everything. You good, he says to me. You\u2019re not afraid for them. I said,\nwhat can they do, more than severe, what can they do more? He says to me, I am\nofficer, a major in the army. And in Berlin I couldn\u2019t do whatever they \u2014 they told\nme do this and this and this and I couldn\u2019t do it exactly what they wanted from me.\nSo after two days in fighting with the Germans, they told me that I didn\u2019t fill out the\n\u2014 the \u2014 he didn\u2019t do it hundred percent [indecipherable] and they put him in jail\n[indecipherable] and he got 10 years severe. Now we were sitting 1n the truck, in th\n\u2014 behind the truck, in the \u2014 in the front 1s a officer and our driver. And the driver\nwas a young guy, and the officer was a young si \u2014 we saw right that y-young people\ncame from Russia, from Siberia, somewhere. It\u2019s a \u2014 children. So he th \u2014\nBoldusov(ph) told me, look, I\u2019ll take care on \u2014 on this guy, who was sitting wi-with\nus with a rifle. But you, as a Jew, you gonna run first, because you understand\nGerman. And we got to go away, Poland, Finland, not \u2014 just not Russia. And all of\na sudden he give me a\u2014 a\u2014a~\u2014a [indecipherable] and this guy\u2019s head was already\nlaying down and the rifle is not here. And we jump out the \u2014 the truck runs maybe\nApril 8, 1999\n20 - 30 miles an hour and we jump from the back. No belts, no pagrones(ph), no\nnothing, and like \u2014 like prisoners. And we run. We run maybe two, three kilometer.\nAnd we came to the city where the \u2014 we heard Ein zug, and zug 1s a railroad. Ein\nzug nacht Posen, ein zug nacht Poland, ein zug nacht Czechoslovakia. I heard\nPoland, Lodz, I said to him, come on, because I know the language. And we went\ninto the railroad, to the wagons, yeah. And \u2014 and \u2014 and the railroad is running. And\nwe had to go out \u2014 some out \u2014 to sit between, because if the Russian come in we\u2019 ll \u2014\nthey\u2019 ll ch \u2014 when they check with the [indecipherable] they gonna get you. So we\nwaited until the r \u2014 the locomotive will stop somewhere. And they stop. When they\nstop we jump out and we went in between the two wagons, you know, and we stood,\nfour people, and \u2014 and we hold on each other t \u2014 tight, sh-shouldn\u2019t \u2014 shouldn\u2019t\nmove, we couldn\u2019t \u2014 no, here\u2019s the water \u2014 the water too, we had to go through\n[indecipherable]. We stood and we \u2014 we \u2014 we see what\u2019s going on. The \u2014 the\nRussian already they\u2019re coming just looking for us. Th-The \u2014 every \u2014 every wagon.\nAnd then they stopped, and they went down and we came to \u2014 before L6\u00e9dz in a \u2014 in\na shtetl. Lignitz(ph)? And we went down \u2014 we went down, we went to the \u2014 the \u2014\nchange the \u2014 the \u2014 the wagons from here they go \u2014 go straight, we have to go to\nLodz. So we went down and we took a [indecipherable] everybody was sitting and\nquiet. All of a sudden two \u2014 not two, three girls came in and they were Jewish, I was\n100April 8, 1999\nsure, because they schlepped pack-packages. In that time after the war the Jewish\ngirls used to come from Poland to ger-Germany, bring food from in Poland and\nfrom Germany take some clothes and they used to make a living somehow. And\nthey went in, they were sitting in the corner. And we sitting in this corner. All of a\nsudden you see in the front of the door, Polacks from the army, with the rifles on the\narms like this. Went back and forth, back and forth, and they mimic with the eyes to\neach other, and one went in \u2014 into the caf\u00e9. They went to the caf\u00e9 and we watched\nthem and we see they are going to the g \u2014 where the girls are. So my friend\nShika(ph), my other friend, the Jew, says to me in Yiddish, [indecipherable]. I said\n[indecipherable]? He says, look, they\u2019re going to the girls, they s \u2014 probably\nJewish.

I didn't go to \u2014 to \u2014 to somebody\u2019s\nhouse. So it\u2019s a fact that my father was smart, right? Hm, Aba, you got \u2014 you got s \u2014\nyou got something here. Look, look my grandchildren, look, I tell her. She said,\nyou\u2019re right. My grandchildren learning, 1-it\u2019s some \u2014 it\u2019s no-nothing in the world is\nhard for them.

And then, this way we had to go out with my\nfather many times vacation in the fields, and we start being more aggressive, more\nmensch ma \u2014 stronger and \u2014 and better people, and we hoped that in\u2014 in a\u2014ina\nfew time, in a few years we gonna make what we have to make in order to have th \u2014\nenough money to go out. You couldn\u2019t go without the certificate there\n[indecipherable]. So you have to be [indecipherable]. But a man who is married\nwith three \u2014 with si \u2014 with five children, how can you go with that certificate? My\nfather would never leave his wife and children and go to Israel, never. Because\nmine uncle left and his \u2014 my \u2014 my father\u2019s brother left Argentina, and in seven\nyears he couldn\u2019t bring his wife with his child from Baranowicze, so everybody\nused to say, uh-huh, you see? Aaron left his wife and his child, but he took his time\nApril 8, 1999\nuntil he could save a penny. I mean, I came to America, the first thing I save\nthousand dollar, I went to Argentina to \u2014 to see my uncle. And he told me the story,\neverybody said Aaron is Aaron, look what he did. He left the \u2014 a wife with the\nchild and he\u2019s not taking her.",

        "A: Yes, yes. A-All my Christian friends used to come and tell me, Noah, prepare\nyourself. And making the hands like this, like I\u2019m going to get killed. So I said to\nApril 8, 1999\nthem, if I\u2019m gonna get killed, you gonna get killed too. First will be the Jews, and\nthen the Polacks.",
        "A: Very much so. Not \u2014 not so much from the White Russian, but from the Polacks\nit was terrible. They used to come [indecipherable] and used to scream, don\u2019t buy\nfrom Jewish stores. Poles \u2014 Polacks to Polacks, not to Jews. And they used to make\nnoises, it was anti-Jewish terrible things.",

And first of all, I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I was the type that I was \u2014 never let people hi-hit\nme, because I knew he 1s bigger, he is stronger, I got to start first. And that was\nhappen always, even the Russian army had [indecipherable] I have to fight. When I\nwas in the partisans, I used to go and train people, so they used to tell me, who\nneeds Jews? We need arms. So they put me in jail.\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: Many times \u2014",
        "A: Many times we used to talk, but sometime \u2014 we couldn\u2019t talk openly so much,\nbecause we knew that our father would like to do it, run away, but he hasn\u2019t got\nenough money yet. [indecipherable] make him [indecipherable] when he wants to\ngo so much. So many times we spoke \u2014 I used to speak with my older brother, with\nthe other cousins, that maybe we should run away and we\u2019ll go to Russia for\n[indecipherable] go to Israel. And we were afraid, in case we the oldest too, we\u2019ll\ngo away and Papa stays with Mom, with the smaller children, who knows if\nsomething happen, who is gonna help them? And that\u2019s was the reason we didn\u2019t\ngo. Actually, in \u2014 when \u2014 before Hitler came, we wanted to run away from the\nRussia, and my mama used to told me, okay, if you want to go, go. But you\u2019ll never\nsee your mommy again.",
        "A: They \u2014 I remember th-they f\u2014 they \u2014 they bomb our city, and our house was\nbombed and wit \u2014 and it was destroyed. So we already 1939, before \u2014 before \u2014 a\ncouple of days before the Russian came, we didn't have a house, we didn\u2019t have\nnothing, everything was destroyed.",
        "A: We were in Mush(ph) in the little city what my ma \u2014 where \u2014 what my mommy\nwas born. We went to our uncle over there. And we stayed there for a couple of\ndays, because we knew Baranowicze 1s a bigger city and they gonna bomb. So we\ndid smart, went, took off \u2014 adif \u2014 our horses with the wagons and everything what\u2019s\nin the house, it was our little models that we had and [indecipherable] and we came\nback. Otherwise would have nothing.",

        "A: I-It \u2014 it didn\u2019t bother me the house destroyed, it just bothered me that we have a\nsituation that \u2014 the thought that Hitler is coming and everything will be destroyed.\nApril 8, 1999\nHow \u2014 how we running away, how can we save it, s-something? How we can do\nmost of it? What \u2014 what should we do? It \u2014 I think that the situation was so tense,\nthe rabbis, the big rabbis run away to li \u2014 to \u2014 to Vilna. From there they want to go\nto America, to Israel, to China, wherever they can go. And the people were left\nlike \u2014 I d\u2014I don\u2019t want to say that, but it \u2014 1t was something wrong. The mazel was\nthat we youngsters, we dint \u2014 we didn\u2019t know about it exactly, but the parents knew.\nAnd this was like a [indecipherable], you know what a [indecipherable]\nfinster(ph), schwartz(ph). This cou \u2014 I-look at it as ar \u2014 it\u2019s something 1s very\nwrong, it\u2019s no [indecipherable] the whole thing. And this was very, very bad,\nbecause people \u2014 you know how you say when you leave \u2014 when you lose money\nit\u2019s nothing, but when you lose hope, you lost everything. And this was a station of\nlosing hope. It was very dangerous situation. Then the Russian come in. When the\nRussian come in, first of all, they took away the rich and the \u2014 and \u2014 and this what \u2014\nand what they didn\u2019t like the ca \u2014 ca \u2014 zi-zi \u2014 Zionist, and took them to Siberia. The\nrove(ph) was in shul, Shabbat, they took him, and many other people who came\nfrom Poland who wasn\u2019t register. And they took him to the wagons \u2014 the wagons to\nKamchatka, I don\u2019t know where they took him to \u2014 to \u2014 to Russia, deep 1-1n\nSiberia. Many die from verra \u2014 from hunger, from anything. But our \u2014 our\n[indecipherable] was alive, he lived [indecipherable] with us, al-all his\nApril 8, 1999\ngrandchildren, his children and the rest of them die in the ghetto barrage. So it was\n[indecipherable], it \u2014 it was a mishmash, that you cannot control it and you cannot\nsay anything. But we were so religious in heart, but Israel [indecipherable] that we\n\u2014 we didn\u2019t blame the rabbis. We \u2014 we didn\u2019t want to say nothing about the rabbis,\nbut in \u2014 in heart you have to say, my good \u2014 my father wouldn\u2019t leave because he\nwants his wife and his children. The rabbi the same thing, got to be in the city,\nbecause he got [indecipherable] city. So is na\u2014I can\u2019t give you the\n[indecipherable] but it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t so [indecipherable], you know.",
        "A: Well, I, as a Zionist I didn\u2019t like it, because they were wear \u2014 anti \u2014 anti-Zionist\nand \u2014 excuse me \u2014 and they \u2014 the propaganda that I should become a\nKomsomold(ph).

So I had to wait, to wait, to wait until a chance, and all\nof a sudden the school was burning in a fire. Something \u2014 probably Polish guys did\nit.

        "A: Not really. It was much better. The Russian was watching that they sh-shouldn\u2019t\nhappen. Secondly, we had the majority of Jews in the city, who came from Poland.\nWe were almost \u2014 most of the city were Jews.

Give it to us. So different\nbetween one another. The SS, of course, it wasn\u2019t good, the SS and the \u2014 the other\nG-Germans, but a lot of Germans were \u2014 were [indecipherable] work. He used to\nsay to me \u2014 they \u2014 they like me so he give me a name, Otto. Come\nApril 8, 1999\n[indecipherable], instead [indecipherable] he says Otto. I said, why are you\ncalling me Otto? He said, it\u2019s a German nice name and I like you, because you\u2019re\nworking with, you\u2019re always happy. And way \u2014 what could you do? Th-The cho \u2014\n[indecipherable] in life is not to give up and to try with all your care how to hold it,\nyou know, because if you\u2019re holding, a lot of people lu \u2014 do like \u2014 if you can, I'll do\ntr \u2014 I'll try. And I\u2014I did many things that I organize things that people was very\nhappy, helpful. And that was my father\u2019s [indecipherable] he used to tell me\nalways, don\u2019t give up until it\u2019s on the last second, you still have a chance. So that\nwas going on like this until one day they took me and another older man and they\ntook us to the railroad. They had to clean up the railroad, the toilets. Excuse me. So\nthey took me with him and they ta \u2014 and the Hauptman, a German Hauptman\ncame and say, you two, you got to clean up this area. The older man wa \u2014 somehow\nwent to look \u2014 find a pail and smutters and nak \u2014 somehow with his hand, poor guy\ndid it. I didn\u2019t do anything. So I \u2014 and we \u2014 before we had to go to the ghetto back,\nhe came and he says, I want my two man. So we went out from the colony. They\ncalled us and we went back to this place. Went back to the place, he said, who is the\n[indecipherable] who didn\u2019t clean it up? I said, me. And he took his gun like this in\nhis hand and made a smear on my face, like this, you know, my nose, my \u2014 my ear\nwas in a minute like this. And then with his hand on the second side. And I didn\u2019t\nApril 8, 1999\nwait. After I \u2014 when he had th-the hand in the \u2014 still out like this, I start running. I\nthought they were gonna kill me [indecipherable]. I ran zig-zagem(ph), zig-\nzagem(ph) and I came home. And I said to my parents, I am going away to Russia\nor to the partisans, I am not here any more. And my mom start begging me and\nbegging me and begging me. I was lucky that my name wasn\u2019t on the list that I run\naway, otherwise they would come to the ghet \u2014 to find me, you know. And since\nthen I change, and I went to the [indecipherable] where I work with the arms all the\ntime. And from there, I pe \u2014 heard group who was in the Polish army and the\nRussian army, we came out from there in \u2014 at \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 into the ghetto back from\nthe arms \u2014 from the armies, and we decide to fight. We have to organize ourselves,\nwe organize ourself. We had a group \u2014",
        "A: My \u2014 my father was a broken man. It was \u2014 it was \u2014 you cou \u2014 I cou \u2014 ee \u2014 I just\nlook at his face, I \u2014 I wanted to cry. He was in such a miserable situation he\nprobably felt, what should I do with my wife and my children? What can I do, what\nshould I do? He was \u2014 he never cried, but I saw his face, he was \u2014 was like skin, like\nvery skinny, you know. H-He \u2014 he [indecipherable]. You understood what I mean?\nApril 8, 1999\nHe die in his life. He couldn\u2019t \u2014 he couldn\u2019t take this. And when I came home and I\ntold him the story, he says, you got to take it. You\u2019re young, you\u2019ll be alive and\nyoull do it. But remember, he says, if you gonna get killed and you\u2019 ll be alive, you\nshould be like a lion. A lion. And I used to think to myself, yeah, how can you be\nlion? No arms, no help. Hitler was [indecipherable] into Russia. The Russians are\ndying from hunger over there, what gonna happen here?",
        "A: There was no work. Y-Y-You were happy \u2014",
        "A: She had to cook for five, six, for seven, 10 \u2014 10 people with grandmas and\ngrandmas, we have to give food, how to get food? When I got to work, I used to\n[indecipherable] a Polack or White Russian, my shirt or pants and \u2014 or shoes, when\nhe get some, to make something for soup. O-Or a piece \u2014 a\u2014 a \u2014 or some bread or \u2014\nor something to bring in. And it was m-mazel if you bring it in and he didn\u2019t caught\nyou. If they caught you, they gonna beat up.",
        "A: They were too young. My brother was with me the same thing, he \u2014 he was the \u2014\nwith the same thing what I did, to supply food for the family. And we \u2014 we used to\nbring arms the same time and in our house we built a \u2014 under the floor we built a\nApril 8, 1999\nplace that from our house we could go out to the water supply, to the sept \u2014 system\n\u2014 system. Not septic, no.",
        "A: Sure, si\u2014 sure. And we made a \u2014 a opening to this \u2014 to the sewer.",
        "A: Yeah. And the [indecipherable] house was very close to it.",
        "A: So we prepare everything so we can go out at night only as a group and nobody\ngonna know what\u2019s going on. So we prepare ourselves and we were a group who\ncalled it\u2014 Moma Kopelowicz. Moma Kopelowicz was our commandant \u2014\ncommandeer",
        "A: The ghetto. And we had few places where they had already about 17 rifles, two\nmachine guns and we had like 500 hand grenades, and bullets ready to go out.",
        "A: What, the front? What\u2019s going on in what?\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: Pe \u2014 we \u2014 we had \u2014 we had \u2014 we read the G-German papers, we knew\neverything.",
        "A: Learned it from a friend of mine. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, because we decided he 1s \u2014 he 1s the right man to organize this. We decide\nthat he is the man who can run us. And he was a younger, maybe two years older\nthan us, but he was a\u2014 a mensch. So we decide that he can be the man who \u2014 to\nhold us together.",
        "A: Moma. Moma Kopelowicz, because we were for all parties, I was\n[indecipherable] all my friends were from Betar, some Hatshomer Hatzair, some\nfrom Gordonia(ph). So, 1-it \u2014 we wasn\u2019t like in \u2014 from same school. We were from\nthe same city, friends, but \u2014 but every [indecipherable] idea \u2014 idea. He had to be\nthe [indecipherable] to the idea to bring altogether for the one \u2014 for this one thing\nwhat we have to do. And he did. He very smart. And he was the first that was killed\nin \u2014 in \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the putsch. Later. So he was our master of the group, and we\ndecided one day to get out. When we wanted to get out from the night \u2014\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: We were like 40 \u2014 47 people.",
        "A: All ya \u2014 all young, from \u2014 between 15 - 16 to maybe 27 - 28.",
        "A: It was like 10 women between them too. So all people who used to work by the\nGermans, who ha-had to smuggle into the ghetto arms, bullets, grenades,\neverything. So when time came, we organize ourselves, this was approximately, I\nwould say by the te \u2014- November the \u2014 the 10\" of 1941, we decide to be going. And\nall the people came to my \u2014 to my house, and from my house we had to go out from\nthe [indecipherable]. All of a sudden came, from my city, his name was Eliezer\nLidovsky. He was a big [indecipherable]. He decide that we cannot go out,\nbecause if we gonna go out, what will happen to him and the other groups? It wa \u2014\nwe had \u2014 it was many groups in the ghetto. And he wants to be the top, that he can\nsay to all the groups when to go, when not to go. And we decide we want to go.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So he came and said, if you gonna go out, the Germans will wait for\nyou outside and you all will be killed. So Moma Kopelowicz and another friend,\nEli Zaryckevicz, he was from Russia, a Russian officer, was a young man maybe\nApril 8, 1999\n25 years old. He went with him to the ghetto to explain them that we are going out,\nour little group from 47 people, and after we gonna settled, you know, make it,\neverything [indecipherable] shoot, we\u2019ll come, we\u2019ll take hundreds of people out\nfrom the ghetto. Nice? He says no, you cannot go out. He was afraid that you\u2019ll go\nout, something happened, he gonna be stuck in ghetto. And that what\u2019s happen. So\none of my friend, Moishe Taub(ph), he was in the Russian army too, and he was in\nanother group, from nervous keit, he took and he shot \u2014 he gave a shot in the house\nwith \u2014 with the rifle. Moishe Taub(ph) did it, and everybody thought the Germans\nwill come right now and they\u2019I!l destroy everything here. First of all \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. So everything \u2014 everybody went home back again, and I had to repair at\nnight, the cement which we did, in case the Germans come to check everything.\nAnd I worked the whole night in the cement, in the water, un-until my knee \u2014 until I\n\u2014Ire\u2014I repair somehow \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. And got \u2014 got \u2014 got [indecipherable] like if nothing happened. They\ndidn\u2019t find it out. Now, in a \u2014 the Germans had a feeling, because they had \u2014 they\nhad e \u2014 e \u2014 espionage probably from the outside people, Polacks, Russians, who\nused to tell them that the Jews running around to buy arms. And they \u2014 they told to\nApril 8, 1999\nthe Germans all these things, that the Jews ca \u2014 buying guns, the Jews trying to\nbring guns from the Germans of \u2014 you know, and this and this. And it \u2014 it was \u2014 it\nwas like this for a f\u2014 for a few months, and then in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Fo \u2014 yes, came the [indecipherable] the first [indecipherable] in Baranowicze.\nAnd we were prepared. We were probably five groups, wi-with 500 organized boti \u2014\nrebels to \u2014 to fight the Germans, in case they come in. One of my friend, he just die\nin Israel. Ilya(ph) Schneidel(ph). Ilyong(ph) Schneidel(ph) there had to throw a\nhand grenade, because he was in the police. And he, when he saw the Germans\ncoming, he\u2019s supposed to throw out a hand grenade and we all will go out in the\nstreets, fight the Germans outside the ghetto. We had a \u2014 we had a lot of\nammunition. We had maybe a hundred, a hundred fifty rifles, pistols and machine\nguns. We would kill in the thousands, maybe. So when the \u2014 the Germans arrive,\nthey arrive few and he thought \u2014 he asked over there, what \u2014 what are you doing\nover here, and they \u2014 they said they came for inspection just. And this was the\nbiggest mistake. The way \u2014 where he didn\u2019t throw the hand grenade, after 10 - 15\nminutes they came in the hundreds. Lithuanians, White Russians, all kind, and\nGermans you know, and pouring into the ghetto, fire in the houses, in the people, in\n\u2014all over the places. And this was a \u2014 such a tragedy. We lost half of our best\nApril 8, 1999\npeople was die \u2014 died. The other, after the [indecipherable] \u2014 after the three or four\ndays of [indecipherable] they killed over 5,000 people and they took a lot of people\ninto the concentration camps, not in Germany, but near our place, like\nMoldachewa(ph), kola -- Koldachewa(ph), Moladecznai(ph) and a lot of my\nfamily went into this category, they took them away to work over there, and they\nmade them so miserable, you wouldn't believe what they did, the Germans did to the\nJewish people over there. The White Russian used to tell them things that I am\nashamed to \u2014 t-to say it, what \u2014 what \u2014 what they did to them. And then a lot of\nthem run away to the partisans and the rest were killed by the White Russian police.\nWe are [indecipherable] who would like to run away to the partisans, but we\ncannot go. After the [indecipherable], after they killed they Jews, they made the\nghetto smaller. And all the arms we had was on the second \u2014 on the s \u2014 on the\nsecond half.",
        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014I was, together with my parents, when they took out everybody from \u2014\nfrom my house, when the Germans came in, and they used to came out to say Juden\nraus, Juden raus. Was quiet, me and my cousin were sitting near the opening, in\ncase a German will find the place, we\u2019ll tell him \u2014 we\u2019ll push him \u2014 we\u2019|l shove him\nApril 8, 1999\ninside and cut his head off. Two or three, until my a \u2014 my aunt \u2014 mine uncle,\nYikael(ph), who wanted to me \u2014 to send me back to the yeshiva, his wife Gittl(ph)\nhad two little children, Moishele(ph) and Jankele(ph).

And she\nwas coming out, and everybody like sheef \u2014 I mean, I mean shefson(ph), you know,\nlike animals, the little animals that go, went \u2014 the whole family went after her and\nthey went out. Just a few of my cousin were left in \u2014 in \u2014 inside. After a couple of\nhours we went into the \u2014 look around what \u2014 what\u2019s going on, we find out nobody\u2019s\n\u2014 you know, just the both of us. We went outside to look, maybe we can do\nsomething [indecipherable] something. All of a sudden the police run after us, start\nshooting. And we run, somehow, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re young, you know, we made it.",

They di \u2014 di \u2014 the top man for the\npolice, and they keep asking for people, Altman(ph). So he said, I have no people.\nWhat do you mean you don\u2019t have?

So I\u2014 we used to\norganizize \u2014 organize and say kaddish after them. And my Feder(ph) Phil, my\nUncle Phil was alive. His wife and children weren\u2019t alive, but he was alive. He was\nprobably somewhere else. And I used to tell him, we have to run away. He says to\nme, you can run. If I lost Gitl with my children, I lost everything, I have nothing to\nlearn \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t want to run. And he didn\u2019t want to \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to run. And\nhe was killed near the Idolar(ph) Street. And I went to the partisans with a group of\n17 people, or \u2014 or 15 people maybe. How did we went \u2014 how could we go out from\nthe ghetto? We went to a policeman, a White Russian policeman and we told him\nthat the second house from here \u2014 because on the other side was the ghetto before.\nAnd now already the Germans [indecipherable] ghetto. And we wanted to take out\nthe rifles. How could we go to the partisans without \u2014 with no arms? And he says \u2014 I\nsaid to him, look, we have a lot of gold hidden in the house, and I had to go take it\nout. P\u2019Il give you 90 percent, just give me 10 percent and Ill \u2014 I \u2014 I have enough for\nApril 8, 1999\nme. He said, are \u2014 are you talking it serious? I said yeah. The White Russian said\nokay. Come tonight and[indecipherable]. We came the whole group, we were\nwaiting, and I went the first to \u2014 to see that he is not taking away the rifles from his\nshoulder, you know. He let me in. When I \u2014 he let me in, I had \u2014 before I had to\ncome out, the guys came out, couple of guys [indecipherable] and they cut him,\nyou know [indecipherable] and they cut \u2014 and they did not kill him. They did leave\nhim he couldn\u2019t talk already. Took away his rifle and threw him in a \u2014 in a place\nover there, and we took out the rifles from where we have to go, and went to the\npartisans. Took us two weeks to \u2014 to arrive the partisans. Actually shouldn\u2019t take\nmore than two, three days.",
        "A: We knew.",
        "A: We had a \u2014a guy before, Mishka(ph) Salmonovicz(ph). He went out the first,\nhim and Labolitz(ph) Aitman(ph), the two s \u2014 two guys went before to the\npartisans. And when we came to the partisans and they saw they have to \u2014 rifles and\ngrenades and pistols. So the partisans thought that the Jewish people have so much\narms, we need you, we need you, come on. And then, when we come and not\neverybody has a rifle, and not everybody was young \u2014 we were young, but then\nApril 8, 1999\ncome more groups, plus the \u2014 they\u2019re like \u2014 half of them were already people 40 -\n50 \u2014 45, the partisan didn\u2019t like it. They only wanted just young. And is \u2014 in\nparticular the group what we came to were Zhorkinsis(ph), their name was\nZhorkin(ph), the commandeer was Zhorkin(ph), very anti-Semitic and very bandit\n\u2014 bandit. A very bandit. He killed Jews for \u2014 for shoes, for \u2014 for a watch, he killed\nthem. So, wh-what \u2014 what \u2014 we \u2014 when you come a whole group he couldn\u2019t do it,\nbut if he caught one or two people who run away from ghetto, he \u2014 that what he did.\nAnd he did many like this.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nApril 8, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yes, yeah, I saw many \u2014 I saw many of them, hungry, with bad clothes, they\ncouldn\u2019t move. They was skelets(ph), you know what skelets(ph)?",
        "A: Skeletons. And they were mamesh(ph), never you hear somebody cry or\nsomething, just \u2014 just die from day by day, hour by hour, in thousands, and nobody\ncould help them, because if you do something for them, you were killed from the\nGermans. And another thing, maybe 10 Germans had 5,000 Russians, and they stoo\n\u2014 th-they didn\u2019t stoo-stood up. Just [indecipherable] about it. Why didn\u2019t it \u2014 they\nkill them? They\u2019d killed thousands, the rest was run already to the woods. But when\nwe came to the woods, the partisans they say, you gave away the \u2014 to the Germans\nyour gold, your parents and your money and now you come here to us, we should \u2014\nwe should \u2014 we should keep you, we should watch you? We need partisans. We\nneed women, we need old \u2014 older men, we need arms. That was their \u2014 the we di \u2014\nApril 8, 1999\nthey \u2014 they \u2014 but we became right the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the most of the people\nthey were maybe 10 people, we were already a hundred in \u2014 in \u2014 1n a few weeks. So\nwe had [indecipherable] and we were a Jewish group.",
        "A: No, when we \u2014 when \u2014 when we came they want to take us the rifles and give us\nju \u2014 junk what they had find somewhere. So we said no, that\u2019s enough. They did it\nalready once to somebody, but no \u2014 not any more. So we didn\u2019t want to be with\nthem. So they were separate, and we were separate. And we become bigger, we had\n300 in the \u2014 1n no time we were \u2014 we were [indecipherable] we were good\n[indecipherable] and all the Christians used to say, you Russians, you just drink\nand you [indecipherable] you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you [indecipherable] what you\ndoing, look the Jewish guys, they go, they destroyed the railroad, they did, they\nbring people that they all over. What are you doing over here, sleeping? Who needs\nyou over here? The goyim used to say this. So they were afraid that something will\nhappen, so they \u2014 and \u2014 and the Russian, a lot of Russian prisoners run away. Five,\n10, 10, you more, more, more, more, and the ghettos was empty already. So they\nbecome m-more than us, how you call it, you know. How you sa \u2014 say it in English?\nMine English is not so good. In the beginning they were \u2014 they fight, 10 \u2014 10\nApril 8, 1999\npartisans [indecipherable] three, four Jews, and then they come more Jews. The\n[indecipherable], how you call it?",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 so th-they want us to \u2014 to be together, and we didn't want it, but by\nthe time we were 300, they were already 3,000 all of a sudden. And the\n[indecipherable], the Germans used to burn the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the [indecipherable] I\ncall it, the farms, [indecipherable] partisans. And everything toge \u2014 altogether they\nbecome a lot. So we had to become one group, because otherwise they would fight\nwith us. So we didn\u2019t want to fight, so we decide okay, we\u2019ll work with you, we\u2019ll\nbe [indecipherable] Ill be the sergeant. I \u2014 I just \u2014 there should be quiet, you know.\nBut all the jobs we had to do, they were sitting and drinking, an-and ta \u2014 and tell you\nwhat to do. But we accepted it, we had no choice, until \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And-And the \u2014 when \u2014 I was there three months and we were\nbig group, so I went and I brought my wife, and [indecipherable] a-another group,\nand \u2014 like a group from 17 people, and we came back to the partisans with them \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, but I couldn\u2019t do it le \u2014 legally, so I had to wait for a chance and we going\nfor [indecipherable] you have a \u2014 a mission to do. They send you to \u2014 to destroy\nthe railroad and they give you two weeks. You have to come back from \u2014 from the\nwoods to \u2014 to go to Leshen(ph). Leshen(ph) was a \u2014 a b \u2014 this \u2014 the \u2014 the road is\ncome at here this way and this way and \u2014 and it was the last time that we going like\nthis. We calling it \u2014 like the railroad comes like this, you see here \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, in \u2014 something like this. So we had to go over there and destroy it. And \u2014\nby the same way, we used to have to count at night how many transports come from\nGermany, with wounded and with the \u2014 s-some of us shoot \u2014 shoot down airplanes\nand tanks and this we sent to Russia all what\u2019s going on, that means they \u2014 they\ndestroying the Germans. And by the time they finish up I worked a week \u2014 a week \u2014\nI said to myself, I am going to the ghetto \u2014 Pll \u2014 Pll do something. What I did, I ca \u2014\nI \u2014 I had anof \u2014 another friend what he had suffered in ghetto and he \u2014 I told him the\nstory, he said oh, I\u2019m coming with you.",

Come. And then he says, do you\nknow how to get there? You\u2019re sure, do you know the \u2014 the \u2014 the right way? Of\ncourse, I used to ride with my father for years, bring the milk from the \u2014 from the \u2014\nfrom the [indecipherable] you know, from the farms. I know. When it was dark we\ntwo quietly moved away, moved away with the \u2014 from the others, and pffft, we ran\n\u2014 we went into the ghetto.",
        "A: [indecipherable] like probably maybe 20 kilometers, something. And we came\ninto the ghetto, he \u2014",
        "A: You \u2014 you ha you have li \u2014 you have another probably 10,000 people left, maybe\nmore. So he went to his friend \u2014 his friend and I went to see my uncle, I still had a\nuncle from my mommy\u2019s side. But we went to the ghetto in these houses, my aunt\ncame over there, I\u2014 I knock on the door and my uncle wake up, he says, who is\nthis? I said me. He says to me, I thought you were already dead. Everybody said you\nwere di \u2014 you dead, they killed you. How come you alive? And he fall then on me\nfor \u2014 from his place, and he start crying. I said, Uncle, don\u2019t cry, prepare yourself. I\ncouldn\u2019t talk because if I talked to him, every \u2014 the whole \u2014 the whole house would\n\u2014 would run \u2014 like to run to [indecipherable]. Can I take from the hundreds of\nApril 8, 1999\npeople into \u2014 to the partisans? What shall I do? I\u2019m asking you. And\n[indecipherable] question, you told me before not to ask questions. What can you\ndo? Ica\u2014I-\u2014I-I left \u2014 right away I saw I am \u2014 I have problems, you know. If Pll\nstay here they \u2014 they gonna eat me up. And what \u2014 everybody wants to life \u2014 they\nwant to live. I'll \u2014 I left this place and I went to other place and hide \u2014 in hiding.\nAnd I came to my friend I told him the story. He says no, it\u2019s no good, we gotta take\neverybody. Be \u2014 over here, hundreds of people are waiting already. I don\u2019t know\nhow we\u2019re gonna get out from the ghetto. They\u2019re watching every step of us\n[indecipherable] like that. We had to leave. We had to leave the ghetto at night and\ntell the people how to get out from \u2014 from the job that they working. They should\ncome on the \u2014 to \u2014 on the Polish cemetery behind the city, and we\u2019ll be there, and\nwe'll come over there when they \u2014 by like 10 o\u2019clock at night. In the meantime, we\nhad one Polack, his name was Hatcha(ph). He was one Polack in the city who\nhelped Jews. And says, whenever you go out or you come, you can go to my place\nwhere my car is there, and you can sit and wait over or whatever you need to do,\nstay there, with no problems. It was very nice of him. So we went there and we\nwaited over, and then we went to the \u2014 by 10 o\u2019clock we went to the Polish \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 cemetery, and we say three [indecipherable] [whistles]. They understood, they\ncame out and we took them and we went to the partisans. We came to the partisans",
        "A: 17.",
        "A: I\u2014I think you got here the names, I said, my wife is the first, and then two sister,\nLuba(ph) and S-Simma(ph) Mandel. And then sh \u2014 a couple \u2014",
        "A: All young. All young between 17 to 25 maybe.",

        "A: I know her because she run away from Poland 1939 and she came to her aunt \u2014\nto her uncle. Her uncle married my \u2014 my cousin in 1938 and he came to America.\nSo when they broke \u2014 when the war broke out, she saw with the Germans beating up\nshi \u2014 Jewish children in her little place, so she decide to run away, came to us. So\nshe was in a different place, but I know her, I \u2014 so I said, if I can t-take her, why\nshouldn\u2019t I? And \u2014 because she was actually working with the whole group on one\nApril 8, 1999\nplace. They used to wash for the Germans officers the \u2014 the clothes. So they said to\ngo back to the group and come to the ghetto, they went \u2014 couple \u2014 couple of us\nbefore that, in hiding and then di \u2014 they went to the cemetery. So I had to take the\nwhole group, but I don\u2019t know the people, I didn\u2019t know. I know maybe five, six,\nseven people, maybe. I didn't know even.",
        "A: Excuse us?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, at night. It took us more, took us two days to come. It was 70\nkilometer. And then from 10 o\u2019clock at night until four o\u2019clock in the morning\n[indecipherable] young people hungry a little bit, and a little tired, you cannot\nmake 70 kilometer, it\u2019s hard. And the snow was like this. So we had to come to a\nplace and we had a man in a \u2014 in a place we called Ouchosse(ph). And in this place\nthey had a man, a Russian guy who came, the first World War II, he married a\nWhite Russian, and his name was Matt Rosov(ph). And he was the guy who told us\nall this. I sent my son to the police, so nobody will think that I will let Jewish\npartisans in here. And this way we used to come and with the cows, used to stay.\nWe open \u2014 we knew how to open and get in, take hay, lay down sleep over and next\nApril 8, 1999\nday in the evening, we used to go. Come in the \u2014 that day we came to the partisans\nand we arrived at the partisans, the group looked, five to six ladies, no arms, just\ntwo \u2014 two pistols or some, and they said, who needs ladies, who needs Jews? It was\n\u2014 was a\u2014a-\u2014it was a\u2014 you know, we need, arms we need, we don\u2019t need these\nthings. And they wanted to kill me because th-the \u2014 you was organize this, you.\nBecause they knew all the time I used to say, let me go to the ghetto, to bring people\nout, bring arms, bring this. So they knew that I \u2014 I am the [indecipherable] I was a\n[indecipherable] to me \u2014 talk to \u2014 to go, I \u2014 before I \u2014 they knew tha \u2014 I went\nalready. So, they knew that I \u2014 I was the one, but they didn\u2019t kill me, but they had a\neye on me and that next time what \u2014 what to do.",
        "A: Just a\u2014 ab \u2014a blue jacket and still, I call it boots. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: We had \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we were \u2014 we were clean, we were washing. We washed\nevery day in cold water.",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable]. Well, maybe not, maybe I had it, because we had to go in\n\u20141in the ghetto back again, back and forth. I\u2014 I \u2014- I k \u2014I keeped it, I think, a long\ntime. And then it was a little quiet.",
        "A: This time \u2014",
        "A: Bogachev(ph). This time [indecipherable] commandeer was Bogachev(ph) the\ncommandeer. And \u2014",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t already this \u2014 this \u2014 the Jewish leader jus \u2014 Jewish leader already was\nkilled. What was happen, the group who took us in the beginning, the\nZhorkins(ph), what I said, they murderers, they were o \u2014 that time already like 30\npeople. And they didn\u2019t accept no Russian, no Polack, no nobody, they were just\ntheir group, all Russians, anti-Semites. And they wer \u2014 group was separate. We\nwere already few hundred people. So they decide one day that the Germans\nsupposed to come to check the roads and the railroads, so we want to go with the\ncrossfire there from [indecipherable] from the other side, and they were gonna kill\nthem. But that\u2019s what they did. Moma Kopelowicz was our commandeer. We went\nlike maybe 20 - 30 people, we were sitting in one end of the [indecipherable] and\nApril 8, 1999\nthey sit on the other side, the \u2014 the \u2014 the Russian, the Zhorkinses(ph). By the time\nthe Germans arrive, they quietly left us alone. So when we asked \u2014 asked fire from\nthis side, right, they ca \u2014 they turn around and came from the other side where the\nRussians supposed to be. And was a lot of \u2014 I-lot [indecipherable] between them.\nThey jump in \u2014 into the woods, arms they have so much, they shot on us for an\nhour, millions of \u2014 of bullets. And we were watching every bullet we had, we \u2014 we\nwatch to be perfect, you know. [clears throat] Excuse me. And all of a sudden, my\nfriend Kopelowicz shot a [indecipherable] in his head and he fall down. And a \u2014\nand a second one he was wounded, and then the third one shot him. So our friend\nMoma took out his \u2014 his [indecipherable] and he want to cover his \u2014 his \u2014 so he\nwas with his hand [indecipherable] like this on his head and that\u2019s the way they\nfall. We made it until the evening, in the evening we came. We took off all the\nblood all around him, we made a kevir(ph), we say Kaddish, and we let him, the\nfirst ca \u2014 the first kalban(ph), the first casualty we had. And then, from then we n \u2014\nwe knew that\u2019s a war, we have to \u2014 we\u2019|l have casualties, we got to get used to it. It\nwas very hard for us, because in so many hundred and thousands of people were\nkilled in the ghetto, it wasn\u2019t so shocked like here in the woods. [indecipherable]\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: Because over here we \u2014 we were like partisans, we \u2014 we fighting the Germans.\nThey cannot kill us, we got to kill them. So it was \u2014 and he was the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n[indecipherable], he was [indecipherable] it was a shock. But then we get used to\nit, people get killed, it\u2019s a war. They killed, they \u2014 we kill and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the way\nit goes. And then from then \u2014",
        "A: The living condition, the first time we sleep under the sky, under the trees. We\nused to take the ha \u2014 the dry wood, branches and make a fire and \u2014 and \u2014 and cook\nlike soup. Some meat or some fish or some fish or some this, we \u2014 we took away\nfrom the Christian population. But after being a half a year already, we went deep\ninto the German zones and we took horses and cows and pigs, and whatever you\nwant to have. And we had like a farm in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 1n the woods. And Jews,\nyou know, they made already milk, cheeses and \u2014 and [indecipherable] an-and\nmeat, and it was \u2014 people, maybe 10 working and preparing everything. Sh \u2014 new\nshoes, new hairs, new clothes, and some people the arms, and th-th \u2014 a factory\nbecome 1-in \u2014 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in less than a year. You wouldn\u2019t believe what there \u2014 a\nhospital we built under \u2014 under the earth, deep and from the trees we had air. The\ntrees were so big, but very old, so you could see the sky.\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: No, no, we \u2014 wa \u2014 one \u2014 one location. This is what one location, was a very good\nplace. We call it Ostrow(ph). Why we call it Ostrow(ph)? In Russian is a place\nwhere all around the swamps. And one place in the center, or more or less in the\ncenter, is higher. This place is dry. So we used to live in these places. And over\nthere be you \u2014 for winter, we \u2014 we prepare houses 50 percent inside the earth, and\n50 percent covered with wood, right, and we used to take away from the Germans\nbenzene(ph) or \u2014 or things like this. So we had a [indecipherable] in side, one side\nopen with many holes, put wood and we were burning all of 24 hours. Was warm,\nbeautiful. And a lot of posts, posts every hundred meter, every thousand meter,\nevery 1500 meter, every 2,000 meter. And then, th-the \u2014 when we became already\nstrong, we had the radios an-and wit \u2014 big radios and what \u2014 music and dancing like\n\u2014 like a normal family. Yeah, because the Russians send us paratroopers and they\ncame with radios and \u2014 and many things. And since then \u2014",
        "A: Yes, we had the Russians \u2014 I told you, we have the Russians and Jews together,\nit\u2019s no \u2014 no more are Jews separate.",
        "A: Yeah, a lot. Jews wasn\u2019t there already any more, because almost the Jews \u2014\nsome, a gr \u2014 little \u2014 maybe after the second [indecipherable] already was nothing\nleft, one group 200, one group 500, who was to work for the Germans.

        "A: But we \u2014 we \u2014 we wanted to take care of the Jews too, take them out. So \u2014",
        "A: We went, let\u2019s say, to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to the ghetto few times, and we knew that this \u2014\nthis will happen. So I went tha \u2014 over there, and instead to take a whole group, I\ntook out two \u2014 two people. Bayla(ph) Trebovicz(ph) and Tuvia(ph) Narnek(ph). I\ntook them v \u2014 all the people went already to the [indecipherable] they took them to\nkill, and I took the two girls and went out from the ghetto, and I don\u2019t know what\nthe mazla(ph) had, they didn\u2019t caught us.",
        "A: There was one had a \u2014 a \u2014 a husband in the \u2014 in the partisans and the second had\na brother. And they were prepared we should take them, so I \u2014 I \u2014 they send me to\ntake them. I want to take them more, but I couldn\u2019t. See, it was a situation that \u2014",

I remember\nmy father used to say, if somebody will be alive, remember what they did to us. And\nafter they killed my father, I was [indecipherable] the yeshiva from school. I\nbecame a lion, I wasn\u2019t afraid for nothing. Always I used to be the first, jump into\nthe fire like a hell.

        "A: Because he wanted to kill me. The jealousy on me was so big, that even Jewish\npeople were jealous. Where we go [indecipherable] successful. We were \u2014 they --\nlike I told you before, they went to \u2014 to the ghetto too. We come to the ghetto f-five\n[indecipherable] he came back.

        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] time.",
        "A: I went maybe five, six times into the ghetto.",
        "A: And all the time \u2014 all the time I came out perfectly.

        "A: Oh, yeah, I \u2014 I\u2014 when \u2014 when the Russians came from Moscow, they teach us\nhow to put mines, how to use arms. So a lot of people doing it, but you see, is not\nwhat is \u2014 is afraid, he is shaky, he is shameful. And \u2014 but a lot of people were like\nApril 8, 1999\ncome on, it\u2019s my life, that\u2019s \u2014 I have to d\u2014I have a chance now to take\n[indecipherable]. I have a chance, do it. But not too many. Not too many, because\nthis was de \u2014 you know, when you leave your woods, you\u2019re in danger for death.\nAnd people were afraid. Probably I di \u2014 I had \u2014 I wasn\u2019t smart enough, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was a time that people have tsinga(ph). The teeth fa \u2014 start bending\nand the \u2014 because we didn\u2019t have salt. Now, I have to get salt, we have to get into\nthe German zone, and the Germans, let\u2019s say two, three kilometer from the \u2014 from\nthe farms, they used to give them sugar and \u2014 and salt and \u2014 and salt, everything. 10\n- 15 kilometer deeper they didn\u2019t give nothing, because they want them to die to\n[indecipherable] partisans. So I took a group. Myself, my cousin Arnold(ph)\nSheefis(ph) and Sam Averkovicz(ph) and Davidal(ph) Winarnik(ph) and we went,\nfour guys, young people. We went and we start taking from the ri \u2014 to a gor \u2014 we\ncame to a place with \u2014 very near, maybe two, three kilometer from the Germans. We\nknock on the door, don\u2019t open the light, give us all the salt you have in the house.\nAhh! One more word you killed and the house is going on fire. The lady brings 10\nkilograms salt. And from house to house and house to house, I\u2019m think we went to \u2014\nthe last house that would have to go back we see, so further from the police. We\nApril 8, 1999\ncame over there with a hundred kilogram. This is shre \u2014 hi -- heavy for four people,\nis 25 kilo for each. We came with that, it\u2019s almost morning, we took off the shoes,\nwe Start cleaning out the rifles, and we asked the owner should give us our coffee or\ntea, something to eat. And we were eating, and no shoes on us. And she said,\nchildren, Germans. [indecipherable] a big window, Germans. I said,\n[indecipherable] fire. We let them come close and [indecipherable] fire to the\nwindows, like this. [makes gunfire sound]. And we jump up and go back house\nand they open a fire. You know, they\u2019re \u2014 it \u2014 it what to shoot. And we took the salt\nand we [indecipherable] the shoes, and it was winter. So we run away ina-\u2014ina\nplace where the \u2014 it was a \u2014 a wat \u2014 water, and on top on the water it was like a\nwooden bridge, and under this was lower places on a lot of branches. Our mazel\nthey didn\u2019t have docks. We went under the branches, and they come too look for us\nand they went further and we were sitting freezing all winter day with the salt. In the\nevening we were so hungry and \u2014 and \u2014 and thirsty and from \u2014 I call it the \u2014I-I\ncannot [indecipherable] in English, from [indecipherable] is all, we went out. We\nstood up, look around, not [indecipherable] we went to the first Christian house,\ntell them to give us hot soup and give us shoes. He say he hasn\u2019t got no shoes. Give\nus food, and wa \u2014 you haven\u2019t got shoes? I remember I was so mad on him, he said\nhe had no shoes. I caught him like this and I gave him a knock. He \u2014 I pushed him to\nApril 8, 1999\nthe lext \u2014 next wall. He was running b-b-b-b-b-back. Fall down and I put \u2014 took off\nhis shoes, put them in my sh \u2014 my feet. So he said to me, don\u2019t kill me please. And\nhe give us so much things for everybody, shoes and \u2014 and clothes and he become\nsoft and good. Then we said to him, now we taking your horse. By a Christian\n[indecipherable] horse. He had two, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t take. We took away the\nhorse and we took a\u2014 a\u2014acow and put everything \u2014 salt on this and we went to the\nwoods. To \u2014 we \u2014 we came home, we were heroes. We got salt, ay yi yi yi yi. When\nth-the commandeer came he said I \u2014 he kiss me and he says to me, Noah from today\non your name 1s not Noah. Today ma \u2014 you are Nikolai(ph). This is a little \u2014 little\nstory but this is very \u2014 then \u2014 then th \u2014 the second time I took the same group. And\none of the group, the Averkovicz(ph), Sam Averkovicz(ph) has parents in \u2014 in the\nwoods, a father and a mother from Baranowicze. They told me I should take this\ngroup because I am so successful I \u2014 I should go to find out, because couple\npartisans were killed \u2014 [phone ringing, tape break] \u2014 couple days before, couple\npartisans went to destroy the railroad and the electricity and one of our friends,\nYakov Press(ph) were killed. When they start cutting the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\ncolumn from the electricity to the da\u2014 Germans put a mine. All of a sudden the\nmine destroy, and a-a \u2014 op \u2014 hi \u2014 has \u2014 his head was off. So we took him on the\nrifles and brought him back to the partisans. And then they send me, I should find\nApril 8, 1999\nout who did it. So I went with these three guys. I didn\u2019t want old, I want young kids,\nwhat I say is \u2014 is holy, cause I knew, the young kids, they underst \u2014 not understand\n[indecipherable]. Older one thinks, I will not go, I can be afraid, Pll \u2014 I find it out\nvery short \u2014 in the very beginning, and I said, that\u2019s it, no \u2014 just with these ki \u2014 guys\nI go. And I came to Matrosov(ph) [indecipherable] but he was a Russian, he came\nin the first war took, and he \u2014 he married a White Russian shi \u2014 goya and we went to\n\u2014I went over there and I told him, Mr. Matrosov(ph), we got to find out, your\nneighbors who \u2014 some of them told to the Germans about the group who went to\ndestroy the railroad and they caught him and they killed him. And the \u2014 and the\nJewish guy with another gun, who went to \u2014 to destroy the electricity was killed,\nwas too much, you know, for us to take. And he finded out who \u2014 who \u2014 who did it,\nand we went t-to this guy at night, had two \u2014 two chil \u2014 two daughters, teachers, and\na son in the police by \u2014 by the Germans. And went to the house, the \u2014 the dogs start\nbarking and he came out, he was \u2014 was sure that\u2019s probably policia, so non \u2014\nnobody \u2014 partisans would come here. I told him to take in the dog, she shouldn\u2019t\nbark and should be quiet. He said, wh-who are you, police? [indecipherable] we are\npolice from Moscow. [indecipherable] he became red. [indecipherable] n-nothing.\nAnd I looks up and he brought his daughters dressed to the table and they give us \u2014\nwant to give us a good time, you know. They prepare food. They prepared food and\nApril 8, 1999\nwe ate, and we drink, even enjoy it. And then I said to him, you see, you did this and\nthis and this and you did this and this through your two daughters. You all three get\nkilled with one bullet. And they put them head to head, three \u2014 all three of them on\nthe floor, and one bullet destroyed them all three. The older lady, the m \u2014 his wife\nstart to screaming, so I didn\u2019t want to do it nothing, but we put the whole house on\nfire with [indecipherable] she get burned anyway. We took away the horse and\nwhat we can loaded on the horses, and back again. Paid them off. But many \u2014 man \u2014\nmany things that wasn\u2019t so easy. What I am saying 1s just ah \u2014 but this was taking\ndays to do, to figure out everything and be sure that\u2019s you\u2019re doing right, right? So.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: I forgot to tell you about when we were a group from Bogachev(ph) and then\nfrom Bogachev(ph) went to the east. So we were left a group with I would say like\nmaybe a hundred people, 80 people were left. What was happening?",
        "A: Yes, together. That was the time when we were already in Bogachev\u2019s(ph)\ngroup. Bogachev(ph) was the commandeer.",
        "A: Right. And he decides to go east, why? I told you before that one of the Jewish\nguys [indecipherable], his name. Hm. Oh, no, no, no, I have to tell you \u2014 tell his\nname. Excuse me a minute, I \u2014 [tape break] I told you before about eza \u2014\nEliezer(ph) Lidovsky(ph), who didn\u2019t want us to leave the ghetto the first \u2014 he was\na older person, had a family in the ghetto and he \u2014 it was true that he will be the first\narriving in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the woods. When he was like second hand by ku \u2014\nBogachev(ph), he used to tell him to do this and get that, tell him stories with\n[indecipherable]. But he didn\u2019t do anything good for anybody. So he \u2014 you \u2014 he\nused to say that if he went as a \u2014 with his face as a goy, and he couldn\u2019t go into the\nghetto, how could I go to the ghetto? And we had a little \u2014 you know, I said to him,\nI am younger, I am stronger than you, I can do it better than you. He didn\u2019t like it.\nAnd when he was such an important man but a commandeer, so I was nothing, and\nh-he wanted to get rid of me somehow, it \u2014 every \u2014 every \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t be in\nbetween, you know? So when the \u2014 the commandeers came in \u2014 in from Moscow,\nwas a commandeer Muha(ph). Muha(ph) is a fly in Russian. He was telling us,\nwhen you go to do something near the Germans, you should know. He gave you a\nApril 8, 1999\nlittle speech. This 1s our land and you should be like a lion. The Germans are\nnothing. Today they are here. In a month, a half a year, in two years they will be\nback in Germany, and we will be in our [indecipherable] here. So you \u2014 he gave\nyou such a impetus to \u2014 to fight, to do something. And young people my type were\nvery encouraged, you know. So when I used to come and do things and that and that\nand all the young people used to come to him and say you [indecipherable] you\u2019re\ndoing nothing, look Noah. With a Jewish nose, he \u2014 he said, he \u2014 he does\neverything. So they \u2014 they wanted to get rid of me, and they \u2014 and they went get rid\nof me. And they send me out to a group who came near Pinsk, and the commandeer\nwas Igor. Igor, when I came to them was plain Russian, all from Moscow.\nMoscow, Leningrad \u2014",
        "A: I was the only one, in Jewish. And I came over there, I see all of a sudden, three\n\u2014my \u2014 from my city, three guys, Worlansky(ph) Eller(ph), Worlansky(ph)\nSimcha(ph), and Worlansky(ph) Abrusha(ph) the youngster, my friend. When I\nsaw them, they said, Noah, where you come from? I said, my group send me over\nhere. I\u2014 he \u2014 they said, what you gonna do? I said, we\u2019re gonna go to destroy the \u2014\nthe railroad here. They said, we have so many people, they know everything. I said,\nI know, too. They said, how do you know\u201d I said, I am already a year and a half in\nApril 8, 1999\nthe partisans, it\u2019s time to learn. They just came, they were just new-coming from \u2014\nthey were [indecipherable] in a \u2014 in a place hid \u2014 hide \u2014 hiding. Okay. Over there\nwas groups, 12 - 15 people groups, and the commandeer was a Russian officer and\nthe rest was all Russians. And they took us, me and the hi \u2014 the younger,\nAbrusha(ph), my friend to the same group. And we went at night. They give us\nclothes forsta \u2014 first of all and machine guns, and good, everything perfect, to be\ndressed like a mensch with grenade, with a pistol, with \u2014 like a mensch you\ndressed, and got arms. They give you a little education what you can do, and which\nbombs you have to put under \u2014 under the railroad. So we came out, over there was\nfive people sitting behind a water. Water was up \u2014 water was he \u2014 to here. So the\nGermans never thought that we\u2019ll be going seven kilometer into the \u2014 into the\nswamp to here to destroy the railroads. So they \u2014 they left this \u2014 this zone open. We\ncame over there vert \u2014 [indecipherable] seven kilometer at night to go, you know,\nand I was short so I had to go with two shtettins I shouldn\u2019t fall in. We came on the\nother side, we were like fi-five people, the communists said, Noah [indecipherable]\nBaloja(ph), you both go to put the mines. Baloja(ph) said to the commandeer, him,\nhe\u2019s Jewish, he doesn\u2019t know ho-how to put mines. I\u2019m not going. So he says, step\naway, right away. In Russia there\u2019s not such a thing you\u2019re not going. So he said,\nwho wants to go? And my friend Abrusha(ph), he \u2014 he \u2014 I\u2019m going with Noah. So\nApril 8, 1999\nwe went both, we put on the mine, you know, we had to dig out the hole, put the\nmine deep that they smell th \u2014 from the dogs, the dogs shouldn\u2019t be able to smell it.\nPut a metal like a half a meter deep. When the railroad come and just a little critch\nis up in the air. We did it, came back and now \u2014 in couple hours after they left the \u2014\nthe swamps, boom [indecipherable]. So the \u2014 the Russian came to me, he said I\u2019m\nsorry, I didn\u2019t know you know how t \u2014 how to \u2014 how to \u2014 the \u2014 they say Jewish\npeople don\u2019t know how to fight. I say, well you\u2019re right, Jewish people don\u2019t know.\nWhat they don\u2019t know, they know. [indecipherable] instead. And I was there with\nthem fighting every night, some other place, some other place, some other place.\nNot fighting with guns, with \u2014 with pistols, just bombs and bombs and bombs. We\ndestroy them like dogs every night a \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 a transport, every night a transport.\nYou know what it is, night \u2014 arms we had, how much we want. Food, the best. It\nwas sitting a whole week every day, then we went back to the grou \u2014 to the\n[indecipherable] near Pinsk. Come there, change clothes, the best shower in the\nworld. Food is unbelievable, the cook was from Hungary [indecipherable] in \u2014 in\norder to cook good food for the commandeer.",
        "A: We were like probably about a hundred people.\nApril 8, 1999",
        "A: No, not one. The commandeer [indecipherable] to have it, the cook and\n[indecipherable] was men.",
        "A: They used to clean the pot \u2014 potatoes, wash clothes for the men. They have lot to\ndo, it was a\u2014 a big group, couple hundred men to \u2014 to provide with \u2014 with the \u2014\nclean everything and it was what to do. And then, even my wife, you can ask her,\nshe was on post. Took a rifle an-and \u2014 and to watch, but they close the p \u2014 not the\npost near the officers, you know, not \u2014 not far away, far away just \u2014 just men.",
        "A: Nobody was sick. The sick ova \u2014 become healthy. Sick people from ghetto\nbecome healthy in \u2014 1n the partisans.",
        "A: Yes, yes, it had everything. It\u2019s not per-perfect [indecipherable] but we had.\nLet\u2019s say if y \u2014 if you needed [indecipherable] saw a regular doctor break\n[indecipherable] in order to take the [indecipherable] it was \u2014 things like this\nhappen, many things.",
        "A: Over there \u2014 over there we were until December 1943. In 1943 we had a\npricass(ph). It means you have to go and meet the Russian army, the Russian army\nApril 8, 1999\nneeds you. We haven\u2019t too much \u2014 too many partisans, because the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nGermans going back to Germany, to Poland, right, and is no room for the\npartisans, so it\u2019s enough the older people should stay and watch the Germans\nshouldn\u2019t get in \u2014 into the woods. Because the Germans will t \u2014 take it over.\nUkrainians, Lithuanians, no, they are all who work for the SS, you know? And the\nyounger people had to go on the front. So when we came to a place in whi \u2014 in\nWhite Russia, when we met \u2014 when we went out from the woods, we had a\u2014a\ngarmonika playing music, we knew we \u2014 we met \u2014 we met in the Russian army\nsoon.

They cult \u2014\nculta \u2014 kultura(ph), so people in Russia, they are not, everybody. So we went for\ndancing in Russia, in \u2014 in \u2014 in the Krasny(ph) Baraki(ph), in the place. We all\ncame to see what the \u2014 how the officers dancing, just officers. And all of a sudden\nsome Ukrainian about something, start with \u2014 with this [indecipherable] of mine,\nmy friend, my Bilmis(ph) and he told him \u2014 I said, this is this and then he said to\nhim \u2014 to the je \u2014 to the Bilmis(ph), you are parshiva(ph) Jew.

You should be killed.\nAnd he send him [indecipherable] by Berlin if he \u2014 there was \u2014 he was killed. Was\na big tragedy for all of us because he said, when the war will be over, we\u2019ll all meet\ntogether and we\u2019ll go [indecipherable] to Israel. And that\u2019s aft \u2014 in the \u2014 I was, and\nthat\u2019s the way we \u2014 we went on the front. I went to artillery on the front, and they se\n\u2014 they send me on a course, on this place where I was, I was on a course for a\ncouple of weeks to learn artillery. It\u2019s a minamyot(ph), you know what\nminamyot(ph) and artill \u2014 artillery too. I learn so good, I knew it, I was proud of\nmyself that I learned the way it should be. And I became a sergeant and they send\nme on the front. Send me on the front to white rush \u2014 to shuko(ph) White Russian \u2014\nfirst White Russian front. I came into a place, my general was Plachin(ph), my\ncommandeer was 99 Guardia(ph) artilleriskipolk (ph) and I was Sergeant\nRoitman on the third battery. And since then I fought with all of them until we\ncame to Berlin. But in between, when we be \u2014 didn\u2019t fight, we had to go out, three\nor four people from each cannon and go and get prisoners of Germans. Sometime\nwe did, sometime we didn\u2019t, yeah. Sometime they killed us, sometime we killed\nthem. And one place \u2014 we came to a place, ot -- Ottertoti(ph) Berlin, we saw we \u2014\nthe Germans at \u2014 attack here back again. They instead \u2014 Russian attack \u2014 attack all\nthe time, but they some \u2014 somehow a group of Germans start attack sho \u2014 attack the\nApril 8, 1999\nRussian art \u2014 infantry. And they caught a group, they put all these, they call it \u2014",
        "A: Belts to each other and to the hand, to the each other and they killed them out.\nAnd we came, we \u2014 we saw the Germans running and we open fire. We killed them\nall, not one was left. So it was a big tragedy. Here the \u2014 th-the 50 - 60 Germans just\nkilled maybe \u2014 maybe a hundred Russians in \u2014 in \u2014 in a minute. And over here we\ncame and we di \u2014 killed the \u2014 the \u2014 the Germans. But what \u2014 what the Germans\nwhere we ki \u2014 there were so many Russian were killed. So when the army came, the\nofficers tell me everybody was crying like children. Why, oh, thought this Berlin\nready, the last minute we \u2014 we get such a [indecipherable] they \u2014 they killed so\nmany people. It was unbelievable, they couldn\u2019t take it. And then, from then on until\nwe came to Berlin, we didn\u2019t left one German alive, not one.

And whatever we saw is \u2014 was\nmixed up, until we came to Berlin. We came to Berlin, a commandeer came over,\nhe said Noah, now you see you \u2014 you have to go. Where I have to go? He said. You\ntake one cannon with 10 people and we\u2019ll push you on the ropes, because the trucks\nApril 8, 1999\ncannot go in. The fire is in \u2014 unbelievable.",
        "A: Yeah, it was in Lodz when we were on the Wiesel(ph) \u2014 on the Wisla. Wisla\nnear Warsaw. W-We were standing there for months, and then we pushed and we\nwent back to L\u00e9dz to see because we \u2014 we knew they still had the Jewish people\nover there.

And from there wh \u2014\nby the way w-we went to \u2014 to Berlin, we came to a \u2014 to the water in the \u2014 the other\n[indecipherable] is like this and the Warta is like this, two waters go\n[indecipherable]. And we \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 and we had to go over on the other side in\norder to stop the ger \u2014 the Germans, they shouldn\u2019t be able to \u2014 to go \u2014 to go the\nbridge. All night long we build the bridges, you know, pontoon bridges under the\nwater. And we took lines, like oil, so the tanks can see the \u2014 the lines oil, how to get\non \u2014 on the bridge, because everything\u2019s under the water. And we came with our\ntruck, a GMC, American GMC and our cannon, 105 millimeter Howitz(ph), and\nwe were sitting on \u2014 and \u2014 and going through and all of a sudden Germans came and\nstarted bombing. And all the bridge was collapsed and our truck is in the water and\nme and one another guy ju-jump out from \u2014 on top of the water was a piece of ice,\nyou know? This was 1945 already, maybe in February, March. And we were sitting\nApril 8, 1999\non the \u2014 on the piece \u2014 on the \u2014 on the ice, and we running with the rifles wet, back\nto Kustrin where the Germans are. I said it \u2014 I am not going, I am jumping. And I\nstart jumping from one piece of ice to the other \u2014 to the other with the big clothes on\nyourself and somehow the energy made it I should be able to come on the other\nside, and we came alive, two of us. When we came on the other side they didn\u2019t\nbelieve we are alive because everybody is under the water already.",
        "A: Yes, I saw.",
        "A: I talk.",
        "A: Oh you \u2014 we talk that 1-1f they can be alive another day or two, and we shouldn\u2019t\n\u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they were afraid to \u2014 to eat too much, because the American in some\nplaces they didn\u2019t give them nothing, in some places they give them chocolate. The\nRussians were better, I\u2019m telling you, the Russian gave them soup. Skinny, not that\nfat, just to \u2014 to \u2014 little by little, not too much, so they \u2014 they [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, sure we knew. We knew everything.",
        "A: Because the trou \u2014 Russian propaganda was \u2014 was telling us everything. Telling\nevery \u2014 we used to hear news three, four times a day.",
        "A: Sure. Auschwitz and Majdanek and Treblinka. And we knew that this probably\nhappened to Jews and the Russians, because they will not take American or British\nover there, that what we knew. Because all the time we had a \u2014 a [indecipherable]\nwe were afraid that one day [indecipherable] the American and the British will at-\nattack us. It was almost [indecipherable] said, the American going to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nattack us, maybe a day or two or three, it was very close to it. I don\u2019t know why it\ndid not happen, but it was on the agenda in \u2014 in \u2014 in Germany, before we took\nBerlin, because the Russian wanted to press so hard, kill how many Russians and\nGermans together, just to be the first in Berlin. And they did. And we have to be the\nfirst, we have to be the first and push and push. This what I\u2019m telling you is nothing.\nIf I would tell you stories how many days and nights we didn\u2019t sleep, we didn\u2019t eat,\nwe had to fight and fight. Some places we had hills, where the Germans give us fire\nhell. We couldn\u2019t go up the hill. We have to shot for days, you know, in order to get\nthrough to these places, because the Germans were so defendable. They had\n[indecipherable] arms, and \u2014 and \u2014 and good soldiers.",
        "A: Well, in my heart I was a Jew, but with the clothes and everything, he \u2014 I was a\nRussian soldier, of course. I couldn\u2019t say \u2014 say \u2014 when \u2014 when I f\u2014 when I get the\nGermans prisoners. So I tell them [speaks German]. He never responded, he never\nsay anything. He thought I am going to kill him a lot. I didn\u2019t touch him, I didn\u2019t do\nnothing to him because I had a order not to do anything. To kill, somebody else will\nkill him, but not me. And if he \u2014 if he a \u2014 he was a general, he wouldn\u2019t even speak\nto a [indecipherable] he wants a general to speak to. Such a chutzpah from the\nGermans y-you wouldn\u2019t believe, yeah. Unheardable, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the respect\nfor [indecipherable]",
        "A: Now \u2014 now we have to go into Berlin, so he says to me, Noah, you take y \u2014 nine\npeople and you will commandeer, and we\u2019ll bring you at night into the city. What\nyou have to do, the first floor everywhere is already Russian soldiers. The second\nfloor, third, Germans. How do we get rid of the Germans, how \u2014 how can we do it,\nwe cannot send our people with \u2014 with rifles? What can \u2014 what can do our infantry\nmen? If we go up, it\u2019ll [indecipherable], it\u2019ll kill them. Now, on every cross is\nsnipers. The Germans killed every Russian, couldn\u2019t go through. So the only thing,\nat night we\u2019ll bring the [indecipherable] and you\u2019ll start shooting in the houses, and\nApril 8, 1999\nthat what we did. We did it for a few days. We destroyed houses, second and third\nfloor mish-mash. So maybe I kill a German [indecipherable] too, I don\u2019t know.\nWhat do you think? So after maybe \u2014 by a week, we couldn\u2019t move the \u2014 the \u2014 th-\nthe machines to other place, because if we would move they would kill us, the\nsnipers. So we stood over there until I heard a shrapnel is coming. A \u2014 when I knew\nwhen the shrapnel is coming, one behind me and one in the side of me, and one\nbefore of me, I knew the [indecipherable] will get into me. So I said to the guys,\nlet\u2019s jump 1n into the \u2014 into the places where the bombs fell before. And we didn\u2019t\nhave a chance to jump out and an air cannon, boom, and nine people were killed in\n\u2014 in one shot. One guy was his head split in half, and I was wounded, but I det \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t feel nothing. I took my [indecipherable] and take his head, it \u2014 1t shouldn\u2019t\nfall apart [indecipherable] ban-bandaged it, and I call for help should come, we \u2014\nwe had nothing. And they used to be in touch with us thr-through telephone. All of a\nsudden the telephone was e \u2014 e \u2014 not in contact. There I knew already so something\nhappened. This was like five in the evening, we found out afterwards \u2014 at this time.\nAnd we were wait \u2014 li-li \u2014 sitting and waiting until 11 o\u2019clock at night they came\nwith that big American truck, and they took us out both, and they took us to\nSchoeneichel(ph). This is Forstit(ph), a little village before Berlin. And they took\nit over there and you see doctors 1-in red, all the clothes is red from \u2014 from blood.\nApril 8, 1999\nAnd you see with the cut hands, legs, people operate \u2014 operate on the field. And I \u2014\nI sa \u2014 I said, oh, I\u2019m nothing. Came to me later somebody with a \u2014 with a scissor,\nstarts cutting my head, I was wounded here, I was wounded here, I was wounded\nhere. I said, a little needle, or something, 1-in Russian, he said, don\u2019t talk nothing.\nWe gonna save your life, otherwise you\u2019re gonna die. And they cut what they did\nwhatever the thing they \u2014 I scream to the \u2014 to the sky, and took me to the hospital. I\n\u2014 took \u2014 took me to hospital. I went to the hospital, I look, full of Germans, full of\nRussians. Full. I took me \u2014 and I look to my \u2014 said to myself [indecipherable] I\u2019m\nalive, maybe they \u2014 I\u2019ll be alive. So the May fifth, three days before the war was\nover, my friend die. He was \u2014 had the split head before, he \u2014 me \u2014 he die. So we had\nnothing left, just me. And I said, my God, I \u2014 I had \u2014 I have no sense t \u2014 of crying,\nor of begging or this. And I cried and said [indecipherable] ah, I am alive. I want to\nsee this \u2014 th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the end of Hitler and then I should die, you know? And I\nwas alive, a-and I ke \u2014 wake up. And my sister came to me, and I see sh \u2014 chocolate\nunder my head, apple. How come? One day, two days, three days, I k \u2014 the best\nfood. In one week I was already ou \u2014 in hospital a \u2014 moving around the hospital.\nAnd they \u2014 they give me some clothes, you know, [indecipherable] and I went to\nthe city.

I was so shocked, it was\nso \u2014 but it [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable] I cou \u2014 I couldn\u2019t take that\na Russian should do to a Jew. I said to him in Russian [speaks Russian] do you\nknow he is Jewish and I am Jewish too? And you do to a Jew, whatever he left from\nthe concentration camp here, all his family is killed. He is quiet, he\u2019s not saying\nanything. He almost cried, too, the Russian. But I couldn\u2019t stop myself and I give\nhim a shot and I knock him out, his eye.

I tell him [speaks foreign language here] no. He took him for\nthe ear and slap him and took the other one too. I went to the army, I told the\nofficers in the [indecipherable] what\u2019s happen. He said, we\u2019|l make you a passport,\nin two hours you \u2014 you go on back to your place, you \u2014 you\u2019re not here any more.\nCause they\u2019re gonna zoo \u2014 look for you.

The second, I bought shoes, thousand\npairs. Then I bought sweaters, a million. And I start in \u2014 in one month, trucks, 10\ntrucks I took, 10 trucks I took five times a day, 10 trucks I \u2014 thousands of soldiers\nApril 8, 1999\nworked just t-to load th \u2014 make everything, you know th \u2014 after two, three months,\nwe had four \u2014 billions of dollars materials.

I had so much money I didn't know what to do\n\u2014 what to do with it. And all my officers used to come and beg, Noah\n[indecipherable] a bottle vodka. Give him a bottle vodka. It\u2019s a \u2014 everybody was\nmy friend. I organize games, chess, soccer, volleyball, right? And everybody with\nclothes and everything.

I said, because the Polacks is sh \u2014 har \u2014 killing Jews and the Russian. Oh,\nyeah, good idea. And he let me go with him. Then we come to \u2014 to Poland. And\ninstead to go to Baranowicze, to see what\u2019s going on there, right, first of all I was in\n1943 as a partisan I was there, so I knew what the \u2014 our house 1s th \u2014 and the people\nare killed, is \u2014 1s nothing special for me to see. And whatever I could see is to see\nher and oth-other friends who \u2014 who are alive. But to me \u2014 to me was more\nimportant to take Jewish people from Poland and bring them over to\nCzechoslovakia, because I had two months passporten(ph).

And I\u2019m very p \u2014 if I am telling you, I am a perfectionist.\nSo, I made in Israel a nice life. In a very short time I build a house for myself and I\nbecome a builder and have a car.

But\nthey didn\u2019t think I wanted to learn, I wanted to become engineer, as I said. How can\nyou become engineer when Israel [indecipherable] engineer? Everybody\u2019s a\ndoctor, and everybody\u2019s a professor. I'll become a builder, it\u2019s good enough. Money\nI don\u2019t have, protection I don\u2019t have, I have to work hard.

But, you\nknow, you get used to the sl \u2014 slowly, slowly, but we are more Israelis. We ha \u2014 we\n\u2014 we \u2014 we live in Israel a lot.

        "A: I would. I would be different. I was \u2014 from the war I became hot, a beater against\na lot of people. Oh, I couldn\u2019t take you see \u2014 you see somebody\u2019s \u2014 even a Jew\nagainst a Jew is hounding, not right, I \u2014 I cannot take this.

I have many [indecipherable] with people about things like that.\nAnd if I would be \u2014 if not the war, I\u2019m telling you, I would be a teacher and I would\nbe much cooler, much slower. Because of the war, I had to change myself, because\nif I went to school in Russia, I had to be better. If I wouldn\u2019t be better, they would\nmamish(ph) beat me up. If a Jew is not better, he \u2014 he feels like a shmatta(ph).

I would learning a lot. But I\nhad from him to learn, because school is nothing.

And that\u2019s what I\nwas missing. All the years I used to say, uh, I have to go to school. School is far. A-\nAfter a day\u2019s walk, we [indecipherable] went by hand to Israel in the hot day, they\nhave \u2014 you have \u2014 the \u2014 you strong enough to go into school twen \u2014 20 kilometer.\nAnd you [indecipherable] money for \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to pay for the bus. But if my father\nwould be li \u2014 alive, I\u2014 I would sit with him for an hour I learn something. So I was\nalways telling myself, that what I\u2019m missing the most. But I know I couldn\u2019t return\nthe whole thing, so I used to learn myself, I used to ta \u2014 buy books and sits to\n[indecipherable] after \u2014 after a day\u2019s work, I used to take couple hours of sleep and\nmy \u2014 my daughter and my wife was sleepy, sleepy and I used to wake up, get in the\nkitchen, the kitchen was big, you know, like \u2014 like this \u2014 this thing, and take a pen\nand paper and write. I used to write poems and I write a book, was 700 pages. And\nbecause I wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] Israel, so I keep the book because they said\neverybody who \u2014 who had material, you should keep \u2014 we should know in the\nfuture, and they took it away and never returned me.",
        "A: Mm-hm. I wrote it from the partisans and the Russian army and th \u2014 Israel, and\nthey took it away. So this I lo \u2014 this I lost, cause over there the dates and the \u2014 and\nthe things, you cannot return this.\n116April 8, 1999",

Not the [indecipherable] no, no, not the [indecipherable], British. And I\ncame to Israel, I didn\u2019t want to know about it, but Shabbas and Yontif\n[indecipherable] my wife put the lights, and I used to get to shul sometime. But I\ndidn\u2019t give my children that feeling. And my daughter, my older [indecipherable]\nthe older, she says to me, why I don\u2019t have uncles and \u2014 and this and this and that?\nFa \u2014 one, two, three times? What can you tell her? So instead to tell her the stories\nwhat we went through, we decide not to tell her. After many, many years she didn\u2019t\neven ask. We wi \u2014 decide she will grow up, she [indecipherable] and then we\u2019re\ngonna tell her, and she understand better. And that was a mistake, should be \u2014 we\nshould tell her, we had to tell her. So, we all living on mistakes, with no mistakes\nyou cannot live.

Look, I [indecipherable] English, I didn\u2019t finish\nany school. In Israel I was a successful builder and the same thing over here.",
        "A: No, no, I wish them the best. I am glad that they didn\u2019t have to do this. Because\nin order to \u2014 to go through that what I went through, I do believe that a lot of people\nwouldn\u2019t be able to do it. If you th-think about physically, emotionally, it wasn\u2019t so\n[indecipherable], it wasn\u2019t so easy. You had to think about it and then say, I don\u2019t\nwant to know about it. I have to continue living. I have to go and \u2014 go and kill or to\nget killed. I-Is \u2014 is thi \u2014 is \u2014 1s this a life? I-Is this easy to say about 1t? When you\u2019re\nliving in \u2014 1n the woods and they call you up at night, say now you have to go. You\nknow, when you leave this place, finish every \u2014 every \u2014 every minute you can get\nkilled. And you have to go in snow so high, right, no food. You don\u2019t know what t \u2014\nbefore you and behind you. And if you\u2019re making, you\u2019re making it\n[indecipherable] gonna make, nobody will go crying you. It was like hefka(ph),\nyou know he \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 not something \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 to do this 1 \u2014 this alone, just to think\n118April 8, 1999\nabout it 1s \u2014 is \u2014 it \u2014 it isn\u2019t so simple. And now this, many times I had to take a\nhorse and go and find out where the Germans are. So, I used to go with\n[indecipherable] you know, with such a ambition. I \u2014 I am the first who gonna see\nGermans and tell my commandeer that over here they\u2019re here and we\u2019|l come with a\ngroup and we\u2019re gonna destroy them. This was the day the [indecipherable] that\nyou \u2014 what you did, you accomplished something. And many times I came, I came\nto a\u2014 to a plo \u2014 toa place where I used to run with my horse, like a machine, and d\n\u2014I call a lalka(ph), lalka(ph) in \u2014 in Russian or Polish 1s a buba(ph), you know\nwhat a buba(ph) is? A doll. So I came to a place and my horse jumped, a little\nwater, maybe 10 feet. I went to the road, Germans in the right and 1n the left. They\ngo to get \u2014 go to get the partisans. I jumped from the horse on his neck, and jumping\nback into the woods, until the g \u2014 the Germans d-decided this not theirs, I was\nalready back on th \u2014 on the horse and come and tell my group that here come the\nGermans and we came out, a group maybe 50 - 70 partisans and we let them \u2014 let\nthem \u2014 let them go, you know, maybe 50 feet and more, 80 feet, a hundred feet and\nfrom all the side we open fire on them. And they were so surprised that they \u2014 they\ncouldn\u2019t schlep the \u2014 the hand grenades and the [indecipherable], they took off the\n\u2014 the pants a \u2014 a\u2014 they should be able to run. And that\u2019s the way they run into the\nwoods, nobody ever get them out [indecipherable]. You know what \u2014 what a\n119\nApril 8, 1999\nfeeling this is? Like the [indecipherable] they explain, if you do something like\nthat, and you have the [indecipherable] with the \u2014 you know what the\n[indecipherable] is? Power. [indecipherable] Is \u2014 this is the sweetest thing in your\nlife, when you see something like that. So I\u2014 many things I made \u2014 what made me\nreally ah \u2014",

I\u2019m accomplishing maybe for the future generation, they\nshould know what was happening. But so many people writing books, and most of\nthem what I know are gormisht(ph). They do nothing.
