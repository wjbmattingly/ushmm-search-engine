        "Q: Marty, I\u2019d like you to begin by telling me your name, where you were born, date",
        "A: My name is Martin Irvin Glickman. I\u2019m usually referred to as Marty Glickman. I\nwas born in the Bronx. At the age of 6 I moved to Brooklyn. I was raised in\nBrooklyn.",
        "Q: And what year were you born?",
        "A: I was born in 1917. My parents came from Romania. They came over about\n1912. I don\u2019t remember exactly when. I wasn\u2019t around when they got here. But I\nwas born in 1917. Lived originally in the Bronx.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your childhood and your family.",
        "A: My father was not an extremely religious person. As a matter of fact uh he was\nJewish. We observed the High Holy Days. Occasionally on Shabbat we\u2019d go to\nsynagogue, only occasionally. My grandfather and grandmother on my mother\u2019s\nside were, kept a kosher home uh with the two sets of dishes and the silverware\nand things like that. I was bar mitzvahed. I went to Hebrew school and uh I\nraised my own children in the Jewish faith. And my two sons were bar\nmitzvahed. My two daughters were not bar mitzvahed, but we have a Jewish\nbackground, a Hebrew background.",
        "Q: Was that very important to you as a boy?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t uh very important in terms of my uh, uh grand feeling about Judaism. I\nwas like any other kid. I, I was brought up in Jewish neighborhoods, mixed\nneighborhoods actually. Uh we lived amongst Italians and Irish.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you start that again because you\u2019ve sort of conflicted yourself. What\nkind of neighborhood were you brought up in demographically?",
        "A: I was brought up in a, a mixed neighborhood. I was brought up in a, a mixed\nIrish, Italian and Jewish neighborhood. There certainly were as many Jewish\nboys around with whom I played as there were people of other faiths. And I\ndidn\u2019t feel unusual about being a Jew. Uh many of my friends went to Hebrew\nschool with me and many of my classmates in school were Jews. Uh it was uh\nnothing out of the ordinary being Jewish in my neighborhood.",
        "Q: Then you didn\u2019t feel any anti-Semitism from the non-Jewish kids?\n1\n2",
        "A: Occasionally we\u2019d get into a fight. Uh I had an older cousin who was a big strong\nyoung man and he fought with an Italian boy one day because he was called a Jew\nBastard. And uh he got into a fight, and uh I\u2019m pleased to say that my cousin won\nthe fight. But I never actually uh struck a blow because I was called a, a Jew\nBastard or anything like that. Uh as I say I was amongst Jews most of the time.",
        "Q: So you really never felt in any way slighted because you were Jewish or you\nnever saw that as something that you\u2019d have to rally against?",
        "A: I never felt as though I, I had to overcome the fact that I was a Jew. I was aware\nhowever that I was Jewish. And uh, uh the great athletes of the day uh, Venny\nLeonard was my father\u2019s hero. Another great prize fighter named Leach Cross uh\nwas a man that he admired greatly. And uh Hank Greenberg was one of my early\nheroes. So I was aware of Jewish athletes and Jewish competitors who did well. I\nwanted to do well also to show that a Jew could do just as well, perhaps better,\nthan anybody else.",
        "Q: Then there was that distinction. How important were sports and how did you get\ninvolved in sports?",
        "A: I got involved in sports because I was always the fastest kid on the block. I could\nrun faster than anybody else could run. And, and uh I found this true until I ran\nagainst Jesse Owens, He was the one fellow I couldn\u2019t beat, never could beat\nhim. But other than that I was, as I say, the fastest kid around. And because of\nthat I had an advantage in any sport I played. So I played, punch ball, and box\nball, and ring-a-leaveo, the games kids played in the Bronx and Brooklyn in those\ndays. And when I started playing basketball or baseball or football, because I had\nthe speed, I had an advantage and so I could be perhaps better than some of the\nother guys. I could almost steal first base in baseball.",
        "Q: So you started sports at a fairly early age?",
        "A: I started sports, I started my first running when I was uh five years of age I think.\nUh we used to run around the block. And uh we\u2019d start in opposite directions, I\nand my opponent would run off around the block and we\u2019d come back to the same\nspot. And the first one returned to that spot was the winner. And uh the older\nguys in the neighborhood would match me against some of the older boys there\nbecause I could beat the fellows my age rather handily. And I almost never lost.\nI don\u2019t remember losing a race until I ran against Jesse.",
        "Q: Now when did this running and sort of neighborhood sports become sports in a\nmore organized fashion?",
        "A: Sports for me became more organized when I went to Junior High School.\nMontauk Junior High School in Brooklyn. And uh I played on four different\n2\n3\nteams. I was a catcher on the baseball team. I played on the basketball team. We\nwon a city championship in, in basketball. Also won a city championship in\nbaseball. Uh I ran on the track team and I was the field day champion. I was the\nfastest runner in the school. And of all things I swam on the swimming team.\nAnd in those days athletes played all sports in season. In the spring and summer\nyou played baseball. In the fall you played football. In the winter time you\nplayed basketball. And all year round you ran. I don\u2019t ever remember walking as\nif as a young person. I always ran. It was just my nature to run.",
        "Q: So sports were very important to you it seems.",
        "A: Sports were critical to me. Uh my life was built around sports. And I think it\nbegan when I started reading the Merrywell books. Now uh those of you who are\nmy age may well remember the Merrywell books. They were written by Bert L.\nStandish and Frank Merrywell was the premier hero. He had a younger brother\nnamed Dick Merrywell who also was a great athlete. And Frank Merrywell\nmarried and had a son named Frank Merrywell, Jr., who also was a great athlete.\nAnd I wanted to be like Frank Merrywell junior or senior or Dick Merrywell.\nAnd uh the exploits of the book, I started reading them I guess when I was 12\nyears of age, and I wanted to duplicate those exploits. He ultimately went to\nYale. Became an all \u2014 American football player, basketball player, a champion in\nall the sports he participated in and a, a well \u2014 rounded All \u2014 American type\nperson. I wanted to be Frank Merrywell. I still remember his, his, his girlfriend\u2019s\nname whom he married. Her name was Inez. I married a person named Margery,\nbut I met her in high school. So it was uh, uh it was my, my goal to be like Frank\nMerrywell, this fictional character.",
        "Q: Then your goal was to be this quintessential All \u2014 American guy?",
        "A: Yes that\u2019s right. I wanted to be the uh as good as I possibly could be in sports and\nalso be a good student, because Frank Merrywell was a good student. I, I wound\nup being, I would say, uh a B student. Uh I never had problems passing a, a\ncourses in school. I was uh a fair student.",
        "Q: So there is actually one story I\u2019m curious about. When you talk about how active\nyou were in sports and how they really were your life at that point. Did you think\nthat you had a future in sports, that you might be thinking in terms of Olympics or\nan athletic career?",
        "A: I never thought in terms of having a future in sports. I never aspired, for example,\nto be a, a sports announcer. That came through my uh the good day I had, the\nbest day I ever had on a football field. But the only reference I recall as to having\naspirations in sports was in my uh Junior High School graduating year when I was\nall of 14 years of age. My homeroom teacher, a man named Hugh Brown, who\nwas an alumnus of Yale, wrote in my yearbook \u2014 be seeing you in the 1936\nOlympics. And I thought that was very nice. I was a fast runner in school. But\n3\n4\nuh I was only 14. I didn\u2019t think in terms of the Olympic games, but he predicted\nit.",
        "Q: After you read that did you think ah ha maybe that is where I\u2019m going or is that\nsomething I should aspire to?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think in terms of the Olympic games until I was uh well into my uh\nfreshman year at Syracuse University. Uh I was a, a school boy champion as a\nsprinter. I was the, the city champion, the state champion, the national sprint\nchampion, but I didn\u2019t think in terms of the in terms of the Olympic games\nbecause I, I was still a kid. I was 17. And uh only in my freshman year when I\nbegan to win against important competition did I realize I had a chance to make\nthe team. And when I won the metropolitan championships in New York City\nand then the Eastern Olympic trials up at Harvard against a great sprinter named\nBen Johnson. When I beat Ben he was uh, uh, he was uh the world\u2019s record\nholder at 60 yards indoors, and when I beat him I realized then just a, a month\nbefore the Olympic games that I had a chance to make the Olympic team.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you to repeat one sentence. Not the whole thing. When you said\nsomething about not until I was in my freshman year. Can you say not until I was\nin my freshman year in college?",
        "A: Not only my freshman year in college did I realize that I had a chance to make the\nOlympic team? I was uh a high school champion, New York City sprint\nchampion for several years, and New York State champion. I was also the\nnational interscholastic schoolboy champion. I and I knew I could run fast, but I\ndidn\u2019t know how fast I ran until I ran against uh some of the better sprinters in\nAmerica and was able to beat them, particularly a fellow from Columbia named\nBen Johnson, an outstanding sprinter. He was the world\u2019s record holder at 60\nyards indoors and when I beat Ben, beat him a couple of times, I realized I had a\nshot for the Olympic team and that was at the end of my freshman year at\nSyracuse.",
        "Q: Having all of a sudden this thought or goal, was there anything different about\nbeing a Jewish American athlete than just being another great athlete?",
        "A: In my high school years and my junior high school years, there was nothing\ndifferent about being a Jewish high school athlete certainly not in New York City.\nI\u2019d competed against everyone. And uh I felt no different than other athletes in\nschool. It was only in my uh freshman year at Syracuse University that I became\naware of the fact that I might have been a little bit different when at my first\ntraining table meal as a freshman, I asked uh at lunch, the very first meal, please\npass the lamb chops, and everyone laughed at the table, because they weren\u2019t\nlamb chops. They were pork chops. So I realized then I was a little bit different\nthan most of the other guys on the football squad.\n4\n5",
        "Q: Did it motivate you differently? Did you think about it differently when you\ncompeted?",
        "A: I was always aware of the fact that \u2019'm a Jew. Uh never unaware of it under\nvirtually all circumstances. And uh even in uh the high school competitions and\ncertainly at college and uh for the Olympic team I wanted to show that uh a Jew\ncould do just as well as any other individual no matter what his race, creed or\ncolor and perhaps even better. And uh it wasn\u2019t until uh the, the circumstances\ndeveloped in the Olympic games when I was refused the opportunity to run in the\ngames uh because of the fact I\u2019m Jewish.",
        "Q: At this time you\u2019re a little bit older, you\u2019re a little bit smarter about what\u2019s going\non in the rest of the world, were you more aware of the restrictions applied to\nJews. I mean in your, in your community growing up it was very mixed. It didn\u2019t\nseem to be an issue. But were you aware that there was anti \u2014 Semitism in\nAmerica, that you couldn\u2019t go everywhere you wanted to and that sort of thing?",
        "A: I was certainly aware of the fact that there was anti\u2014 Semitism. My grandfather\nand my father, my uncles, told me about the pogroms in Europe and Romania.\nThey\u2019d heard about the pogroms in Poland as well and in other parts of Europe\nand Russia and I was aware of uh anti \u2014 Semitism. In New York City I was also\naware of the fact that there were certain places I was not welcome. I might go\ninto a hotel for example and uh see a small sign where you registered uh which\nread restricted clientele, which meant in effect no Jews, no Blacks allowed. There\nwere certain areas around New York City where you couldn\u2019t live. Like Darian,\nConnecticut, for example was a place where Jews were not permitted to own\nhomes in Darian. And uh I was aware of that. Uh my folks would tell me and my\nin \u2014 laws later on uh told me about reservations they made at a hotel and my\nfather \u2014 in \u2014 law\u2019s name was Dorman and uh neither Jewish or Gentile, and he\nwould try to check into a hotel having made a reservation at some resort and\nbeing turned away when they found out he was Jewish. He might check in as\nJack Dorman, which he was, but his friends and associates might have names like\nGoldberg or Cohen or Goldstein and the group was turned away uh upon\noccasion. So I was aware. I was aware of anti\u2014 Semitism. In New York and\nthroughout the country as well.",
        "Q: How much in the early 30\u2019s did you know about what was going on in Europe and\nGermany in particular?",
        "A: I knew practically nothing about what was going on in uh Germany uh\nspecifically and in Europe generally, except that I\u2019d heard about the pogroms in\neastern Europe basically as I mentioned in Romania and Poland and Russia. Uh\nbut I was not specifically aware until my freshman year at Syracuse when as a\npolitical science major I began to learn of the uh anti \u2014 Semitism that uh some of\nthe Fascist countries were subjecting Jews to, particularly in Nazi Germany.\nThere was anti \u2014 Semitism in Germany. I knew that. And there was anti \u2014\n5\n6\nSemitism in America. The uh Nuremberg laws as I understand it were passed in\n1933. I was aware that there were.",
        "Q: I think 35. There were restrictions from 33.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: ...Start over.",
        "A: Yes. I, I, I was aware of the Nuremberg laws which were passed in 1935. Um\nHitler had come to power in 1933. As a political science major at Syracuse\nUniversity, I was aware of those anti \u2014 Semitic laws, but these were merely on the\nbooks uh like the laws perhaps, not going to certain hotels, not going into certain\nareas, the unwritten laws, or the law about not crossing against a red light if\nyou\u2019re crossing the street. Uh they were not seriously spoken nor seriously taken\nin the States. We were aware of it. But how, how they affected individuals I\ndidn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t have any family in Europe?",
        "A: At that time uh the family I had in Europe uh were my father\u2019s brothers who uh\nlived in Romania and were still there. But uh I didn\u2019t know how they were\naffected by it at all.",
        "Q: Okay. It\u2019s just interesting to know, you know, what you knew before going over\nto Germany. Tell me about qualifying for the Olympics. How did that come\nabout?",
        "A: I qualified for the Olympic games by winning a series of races to qualify for the\nfinal trials which were held at Randall\u2019s Island in New York City uh the first use\nof that Randall\u2019s Island Stadium for track and field championships. I qualified by\nwinning the metropolitan championships and then the eastern qualifying round up\nat Harvard Stadium in Boston. There were Eastern, Near \u2014 Midwestern, Western,\nand Far western trials and I was the winner of the sprint in the East so I qualified\nfor the final round. It was a series of qualifying rounds and I and about, I would\nguess, 14 other sprinters qualified for the final round. And 1n that final round I\nqualified and made the team.",
        "Q: How did you place in those final rounds? What happened there?",
        "A: Uh the placement in the final round, in the actual finals, I qualified by finishing\nsecond in my uh in that semi \u2014 final heat uh at Randall\u2019s Island. And uh I\u2019d like\nto tell the story of uh my first race against Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe. Uh\nthese two were the two great black sprinters of the day. Uh we drew uh, uh\nmarbles which we numbered for the lanes in which you ran. I drew lane number\n5. Jesse Owns was in lane number 4. Ralph Metcalfe was in lane number 6. And\n6\n7\nI\u2019m in number 5. So here is Owens, the world\u2019s champion, alongside of me.\nMetcalfe, who\u2019d run and won a silver in the 1932 Olympic games, on the other\nside. These two magnificent athletes on either side of me and I\u2019m scared stiff. I\nmean I was shaking so that when the starter called us to our marks, to put our feet\nin the starting holes, we didn\u2019t use starting blocks in those days, you dug holes\nwith a trowel. When I started to put my front foot, my left foot, in the hole, my\nfoot was shaking so I could not put my foot in that starting hole. It was just\nvibrating so I couldn\u2019t put it down. And all six additional sprinters on either side\nof me were on, on their marks, getting ready to go, and I\u2019m still standing there\nshaking. And the starter called everyone up and called me over to him. I knew\nthe man. Uh he\u2019d started me in some of the high school races I had run, and he\nsaid Marty walk up and down a bit, take a few deep breaths, relax, jog up and\ndown, relax, and we\u2019ll try to start again. And after several minutes uh I was\ncalmed down sufficiently to get my foot into that starting hole. Both feet in and\nwe raced. Uh I don\u2019t remember the gun going off. We were set terribly tense of\ncourse on our marks, and then set, and then I was running. And there was Owens\non my left and Metcalfe on my right and for forty yards I\u2019m running even with\nthem. And then suddenly as though they were on an escalator and I was not they\nwere pulling ahead and moving ahead. And I fought as best I could and I kept\ndropping back. And uh then I realized I wasn\u2019t going to catch either one of them\nand I thought I finished third in the race. Uh so much so that uh Ted Using who\nwas broadcasting the race on the infield of the track, he was the leading track and\nfield broadcaster of the time. Uh Ted called me over after the race and said here\u2019s\nMarty Glickman, the kid from Brooklyn who finished third. Oh wait a second he\nsaid. I see they\u2019ve placed Frank Wycoff third. Marty finished fourth. And he\ninterviews Frank and then he says now here\u2019s Mar, oh just a moment he says, uh\nthey\u2019ve placed Floyd Draper in the fourth place, Marty finished fifth. So he\ninterviewed Floyd Draper and then he, he interviewed me finishing fifth. Which\nis where I was placed. I was a bit upset about that. Uh films from the race\nindicate that uh I beat Floyd Draper by a foot uh. Very little question about that.\nAs for Frank and myself, you could, you could choose the winner between the\ntwo of us, but uh, uh I didn\u2019t know whether I beat Frank or not. Nor did he. Uh\nlater in Paris in a post \u2014 Olympic meet I beat Frank but uh, uh we were virtually\nin a dead heat for third place. So I, Iso remember Dean Cromwell finishing uh,\nuh it\u2019s too long already.",
        "Q: Yeah. I guess I\u2019m asking was there something that happened there, that was a\nprecursor of anything else?",
        "A: Well Dean Cromwell, Dean Cromwell leads to another story which has to do with\nthe selection uh my ouster from the team. So uh if you can fit this in. As we\nfinished the race, I noted that Dean Cromwell, the assistant head track coach of\nthe American Olympic team and the head track coach of the University of\nSouthern California, was in amongst the officials, arguing with them that Frank\nWycoff had finished third and Floyd Draper had finished fourth. Because he was\nthe coach of Southern Cal and Wycoff and Draper ran for Southern Cal or had\n7\n8\nrun. Wycoff was graduated. Had run for Southern Cal. These were his boys and\nhe pushed them amongst the officials uh as finishing third and fourth. And I was\nplaced fifth. I don\u2019t know whether I finished third, fourth, or fifth. I just don\u2019t\nknow. But I do know that Dean Cromwell had a hand in the placement of the\norder of finish.",
        "Q: And you think it was clearly favoritism, not the fact that you were a Jew?",
        "A: I think it was clearly favoritism that uh he wanted his boys placed third and\nfourth. Uh the fact that I was Jewish I think did not matter at that time. He\nwanted his boys in there. And uh I had made the team anyhow because the first\nseven men were to make the team. The first three finishers running the 100 meter\nrun, and the next four finishers making up the 400 meter relay. So I had made the\nteam.",
        "Q: Any other Jews on the team?",
        "A: The other Jew on the track team, one other Jew was Sam Stoller. Stoller was\nplaced sixth in the 100 meter final. He finished behind me. He ran a poor race.\nLater Sam beat me in the Olympic Village in a trial race we had amongst the three\nof us. Sam Stoller finishing first. I was beaten by a shoulder by Sam, and we\nboth beat Floyd Draper. Floyd Draper wound up running on the team.",
        "Q: We'll get to that. Now after you qualified for the Olympic team, what sort of\npreparation was there between those qualifying rounds at Randall\u2019s Island and\ngoing to Berlin?",
        "A: We qualified for the Olympic team uh on a uh Friday and we were on board the\nship I believe on Tuesday, heading for uh Berlin. It was almost immediate. Uh\nwe were measured for our uniforms. Uh there were several events we attended,\nuh several ceremonies we attended and we were aboard ship uh within three days\nafter making the team. It was very quick. There was no training period or\nanything like that. We stayed in shape, of course. We kept working out every\nday to make sure we were in good condition. And we took the S.S. Manhattan for\nBerlin.",
        "Q: Now this sounds pretty exciting. I don\u2019t know how much you had traveled before\nthen, but winning these rounds and then a few days later being on a boat going to\nEurope sounds like a big deal.",
        "A: This was quite an experience for me. I had been no farther than Boston. I\u2019d been\nno further south than Philadelphia until that time. I was uh this 18 year old kid\nfrom Brooklyn. I was the second youngest kid on the team, on the track team.\nAnd here I was aboard this magnificent liner heading for Europe and uh it was a\nmost exciting time. Uh it was wonderful, it was thrilling, it was, it was great. It\nwas fulfilling my Frank Merrywell dream partially.\n8\n9",
        "Q: What was it like on the boat?",
        "A: The boat was uh informal. It was fun. Uh we, we trained aboard the ship. It was\na, a five day crossing and a sixth day getting uh to Hamburg and then down to\nBerlin by train. Uh but we had no opportunity to really sprint aboard ship. So we\ndid calisthenics, we jogged up and down, we did a great deal of walking aboard\nship. We uh watched our diet fairly carefully. Uh there was no specific training\nregimen because we were all pretty good athletes, had our own different coaches\nand coaching techniques applied to us for months and years beforehand. So we\nwere not concerned with uh being uh directed by the coaches who were on the\nteam. It was a fun time. It was, it was a time that was loose and easy and pleasant\nand, and we looked forward with great anticipation to getting to Europe and\ngetting in competition.\n(end of Tape 1 of 4)\nTape 2 of 4\n(five seconds)",
        "Q: I want to backtrack for a moment. Prior to your going to Berlin, do you\nremember any conversation, any newspaper articles, any talk of America\nboycotting the Olympics because of what was going on already in Germany?",
        "A: At the time we were competing in the uh regional finals and then the finals at\nRandall\u2019s Island uh the talk was so slight that I truly was not aware of the\npossibility of a boycott of the 1936 games. It had very little play in the press if\nany. I don\u2019t remember seeing it in the newspapers or hearing it on the radio. Asa\nmatter of actual fact, no Jewish organization like B\u2019nai Brith or uh ADL or uh the\nAmerican Jewish Congress if there was an AJC then. Uh no Jewish\norganization nor any individual ever said to me, Marty don\u2019t go. There was no\ntalk, general talk, of boycott. I know now that there was a vote taken involving\nthe AAU, the Amateur Athletic Union, and the American Olympic Committee\nand that uh they voted to go. Uh but there was no such publicity or promotion\nsuch as existed in 1980 when the President of our United States, Jimmy Carter, uh\nstrongly recommended that we don\u2019t participate in the 1980 games. There was no\nsuch popular movement at the time of 1936.",
        "Q: And you weren\u2019t aware that there were athletes who had decided not to go on\ntheir own?",
        "A: I was not aware of any athletes who decided not to go. I know now that athletes\nuh say they decided not to go. There was a fine sprinter whom I never met, never\nran against, fellow named Herman Newgas, of Tulane, who determined that he\n9\n10\nwas nor going to try out for the team. Uh he didn\u2019t go, he didn\u2019t try out for the\nteam. But I knew that later, in later years.",
        "Q: So this was just not an issue?",
        "A: The fact of going or not going was not an issue. Not as far as I was concerned nor\nin terms of the public press or the populace generally. Uh we didn\u2019t think in\nterms of not going.",
        "Q: Tell me about the trip over, the anticipation, what it was like being on the boat?",
        "A: Being on the boat was fun. Being on the boat was a brand new experience\nparticularly for a kid from Brooklyn or any of us who\u2019d never been abroad. Uh\nI\u2019d been no farther north than uh, uh than Boston. I\u2019d been no farther south than\nPhiladelphia, and here I was uh an eighteen year old kid from Brooklyn uh\nheading for Europe. Uh had been, a name, a place my parents came from, going\nto Germany, and uh visiting other countries as well. Our first stop for example\nwas uh in Ireland with the ship. Just stopping there and seeing it in the distance\nand how beautifully green it was. We stopped in England momentarily at\nPlymouth and I could, uh I couldn\u2019t see the Plymouth Rock or anything like that\nand uh, uh but it was Plymouth England and then we went across to uh, uh\nGermany to uh, uh landed in Hamburg and from Hamburg took the train down\ninto the uh heart of Berlin to the huge Bahnhof in Berlin.",
        "Q: What was going on on that boat? What was the mood? People were I assume\nfairly excited.",
        "A: All of us were pleased at having made the team. And uh the boat was wide open.\nIn those days a huge ship uh like the Manhattan uh had different classes, first\nclass, second class, uh cabin class or whatever, steerage even. Uh but we had the\nrun of the boat. And uh, uh those we ate in what amounted to uh the uh second\nclass dining room, we were not in the top categories of dining room, we had huge\nmenus to choose from. We were not given training table food. We selected our\nown foods. There was a fellow on the team named Tarzan Brown. Uh an Indian,\nNarragansett Indian from Maine who\u2019d never seen a menu like this before. And\nTarzan was a marathon runner. He weighed perhaps a hundred and thirty pounds.\nUh, uh a great marathon runner. He\u2019d won the Boston marathon. On the team\nand we had uh this huge menu. And every meal, every day, he ate the menu from\ntop to bottom. I mean six appetizers, and two or three soups, and four main\ncourses. In those six days on the ship uh he might have put on between 10 and 11\npounds. He ran the first mile of the marathon and uh then he sat by the wayside\nand uh gave it all up.",
        "Q: How were you spending your time on the boat?\n10\n11",
        "A: We spent our time on the boat talking, uh working out, uh calisthenics mostly.\nJogging up and down on some of the very short, straight aways on deck. Uh there\nwas no facility to really work out the way we would have ordinarily on a, a cinder\ntrack or a clay track, certainly no quarter \u2014 mile track aboard ship. Uh but we, we\nstretched, uh we jogged, we walked, we did exercises and uh we talked and we\nread and uh, uh generally it was a group of guys having a good time together.\nThere were women on the team as well, but uh, I guess I was not involved nor\ninterested in any of the women. I had a girlfriend who later became my wife.",
        "Q: Was there any special camaraderie amongst the few Jewish athletes on the boat?",
        "A: There was no special camaraderie amongst the Jewish athletes except a, a warm\nfriendship that I developed with a, a baseball player, Herman Goldberg, who was\na catcher on the exhibition baseball team. There was no international baseball\ncompetition. America was practically the only place where baseball was played\nin those days. So it was a demonstration. An exhibition team and he was on the\nteam and on the Olympic team. Herman was, a catcher on the team. We hit it off\nvery nicely. But usually uh with the athletes from the different sports, the track\nathletes stayed together, uh the gymnasts were together, the swimmers were\ntogether. Not that we didn\u2019t fraternize with each other but we had much more in\ncommon with Olympic team.",
        "Q: Now when you say you talked a lot, what did you talk about? What it was going\nto be like in Berlin competing or?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk about uh about what Europe was going to be like. We talked uh\nabout mostly about America. We talked about uh, uh baseball and football and\nparticularly about track and field. Uh we told stories, we swapped yarns. We\nwere, how can I say it best, we were a bunch of guys who enjoyed each other.\nWe had enormous respect for each other. And I as one of the younger fellows on\nthe team, looked up to some of the older men who were not only older but bigger\nand stronger uh that one. And uh it was just a very pleasant time, a group of\nyoung men being with each other enjoying uh the sea voyage, enjoying each\nother\u2019s company.",
        "Q: Did you think about the fact that you were representing the United States in the\nOlympics?",
        "A: It\u2019s rather unusual uh for me or any athlete to say that uh we represented America.\nI didn\u2019t feel as though I represented the USA. Uh I represented me. I was a, I\nwas glad I was on the team. It was a goal I had sought. It was uh an achievement\nfor me. It was an individual thing. After all the Olympic games in theory and I\nstrongly believe this, the Olympic games are for the individual, for the excellence\nof the individual and theoretically though we wear national uniforms we don\u2019t\nrepresent the different countries who\u2019s uniforms we wear. We represent athletes.\nWe represent sports. We compete in sports for sports\u2019 sake. The competition 1s\n11\n12\nall important. Winning is not important. Baron de Coubertin who founded the\nmodern Olympic games insisted, has been quoted many times as saying, winning\nis not the goal of the Olympic games, taking part, participating 1s what the\nOlympic games are all about. So it wasn\u2019t as though we were going there to win\nfor the United States. That was the thought that was perhaps in the back of our\nminds. It was not a conscious thought. We were going as athletes, not\nnecessarily as Americans. I was going there as a Jewish American athlete, but as\nan athlete basically. A Jew, an American, and an athlete.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the reality of what you\u2019re saying that there is that there are no, are you\nsaying theoretically there are no national lines, there are no politics in the\nOlympics? I mean that certainly isn\u2019t my perception.",
        "A: People say that there are politics in the Olympic games. I say hogwash. I say\nnonsense. Where does politics fit in when you run 100 meters? Or 1500 meters?\nOr put the shot? Or even play basketball against each other? What politics are\ninvolved? The first man across the finish line wins. No matter what the race.\nThe man who puts the shot a longer distance than any other is the gold medal\nwinner, or spins the discus, or throws the javelin or whatever the event. There are\nno politics amongst the athletes. You talk about politics amongst the nations.\nCertainly. But not as far as the Olympic games are concerned. They don\u2019t exist.\nPolitics are not involved in terms of winning and losing. That\u2019s a good kasook\nright?",
        "Q: Well I just clearly nations have used those gold medals in a political framework.",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe that at all. I don\u2019t believe that the uh, having uh, medal winners\nfor a particular country in terms of anything important, anything solid. After all,\nthe East Germans were terrific as long as East Germany existed and they uh\nsought and worked hard to get, to develop great Olympic athletes. And the Soviet\nUnion won many, many medals, dominated a couple of Olympic games, and, and\ncertainly the uh, the uh the Italians to some extent won many Olympic events as\nwell as other Fascist countries doing well and centered their interest in the\nOlympic games. And where is the Soviet Union today? Where are the East\nGermans today? Where is Nazi Germany today? They just don\u2019t exist any more\nand Nazi Germany won more medals in the \u201936 games than the United States did.\n33 to 26. Although they won medals for dressage and for pistol shooting and rifle\nshooting and things like that. Uh I don\u2019t see the importance of international\nathletics in terms of politics at all. They say that the governments use it, but even\nthe successful Olympic teams like Germany and East Germany and the Soviet\nUnion, where are they? What good did it do them?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t necessarily need to belabor this, but except for that in 1936 Germany\u2019s\nsuccesses not only in presenting the Olympics but in also winning a lot of medals,\nmay have been an encouragement, may have spurred them on in ways at that time.\n12\n13",
        "A: Many people say that uh the \u00b036 Olympic games were the Nazi Olympics or\nHitler\u2019s Olympic games. I saw that they were Jesse Owens Olympic games. The\nmyth of Nazi Aryan supremacy was smashed to smithereens by the great non \u2014\nAryan athletes. Black athletes, wonderful black athletes, won the 100, the 200,\nthe 400, the 800, the long jump, uh the high jump, medaled in many other events\nas well. It was the Olympic games of Jesse Owens not of Adolph Hitler. Jesse\nwas idolized by the German population. He couldn\u2019t walk into the stadium using\nthe regular player\u2019s entrance into the stadium. He had to be secreted into the\nstadium. He had to use a secret entrance to get in. Otherwise he\u2019d been mobbed\nby the uh idolizing uh German population or whoever the spectators were and\nthey were mostly Germans in the 120,000 seat stadium. It was Jesse Owens\nOlympics as far as I was concerned, and I think as far as the world was concerned.\nAnd it certainly proved that uh this Aryan business of supremacy was ridiculous.\nThere were non \u2014 Aryans winning the most important events.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to your story now. So you had this terrific boat ride over and tell\nme about your arrival and getting to Berlin and all of that.",
        "A: We arrived at the Bahnof in Berlin at midday in a huge crowd.",
        "Q: Let me just stop. You arrived on the boat in Hamburg. Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was there anybody there to greet you?",
        "A: We went right to the train.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Nothing happened.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: There was a huge crowd waiting for us at the Bahnhof in Berlin, this huge railroad\nstation, uh newspapermen, camera people with the newsreels, uh photographers,\nfans, officials of all sorts, uniforms of all sorts. Huge crowd waiting on the\nplatform when we arrived. And as we uh got off the train and milled about on the\nplatform I felt a tap on my shoulder. And I turned and saw a smallish looking\nyoung man in his mid \u2014 twenties obviously an American as soon as he talked to\nme, and he said to me are you Marty Glickman. I said yes. He said you\u2019re Jewish\naren\u2019t you. I said yes I am. Slightly taken aback. I said uh why do you ask. He\nsaid well I\u2019m Jewish also. I said you\u2019re Jewish. What are you doing here. He\nsaid I\u2019m going to med school here in Germany. I said you\u2019re going to med school\nhere in Germany. He said yes. I couldn\u2019t get into an American med school. So\nthe feeling I had of Berlin being very much like New York in it\u2019s anti \u2014 Semitism\n13\n14\nor it\u2019s lack of anti \u2014 Semitism uh was similar to New York and Berlin. It was the\nsame sort of city, I thought, particularly as a result of this conversation with this\nyoung man going to med school.",
        "Q: What did he tell you about the political climate in Germany as a Jew?",
        "A: I asked him what it was like for you as a Jew here in Germany. He says well in\nBerlin I go practically unnoticed. Nobody knows that I\u2019m Jewish. Uh I\u2019m going\nto med school here. Uh in the shtetels, in the smaller cities around uh Germany\nuh there are problems. But now during the Olympic games and leading up to the\nOlympic games everything is, is, is quite. Uh nothing seems to be going on in\nterms of anti\u2014 Semitism. And as far as my being here in Berlin, I\u2019m just like\nanybody else here in Berlin. I\u2019m going to med school.",
        "Q: All of these people who greeted you at the train station in Berlin, were they\ncarrying swastikas, was there any of that?",
        "A: There was a huge number of uniformed individuals. I noticed and we commented\nabout it, my teammates and I, about the fact that uh there seemed to be no men\nunder the age of approximately 35, no young men who were not in one uniform or\nanother. They were wearing either gray, green or brown. In one uniform or\nanother. No young men in street clothes, in civilian attire, except those who were\nolder than 35 or obviously older than uh the age that we athletes were. Everyone\nseemed to be in uniform. As for banners and flags, they were all over the place,\ndominated by the swastika. The swastika was all over. On virtually every other\nbanner we saw there was a swastika. But this was \u201936. This was before we really\ngot to know what the swastika truly meant. This was two years before\nKristallnacht. This was three years before the outbreak of the war. It was five\nyears before the United States was involved in the war. So the swastika and those\nuh German flags, the black and red and white of the German flags, did, didn\u2019t\nmean very much to us except as a form of decoration.",
        "Q: And it wasn\u2019t sort of an unnerving amount of patriotism?",
        "A: I\u2019d never been asked about the patriotism exhibited by the Germans at that time.\nUh it was a, a, a natural thing to see uh all these German flags. Uh but flags of\nother nations were exhibited as well. Uh they rimmed the stadium. They were on\nthe streets. There were many flags. Mostly German. Most of those German flags\nwere contained the swastika. Uh there was seemed to be no outward display of\npatriotism except when Hitler walked into the stadium. He would walk into his\nbox overlooking the field and I was perhaps 50 to 75 feet away from Hitler\u2019s box.\nAnd he\u2019d walk in and the stands would rise and you\u2019d hear it in unison. Seig\nHeil. Seig Heil. All together, this huge sound reverberating through the stadium.\nThat was the patriotism, the German patriotism I saw. Seig Heil, with a hundred\nand twenty thousand people shouting it, or most of the hundred and twenty\nthousand people. But that same shout of Seig Heil was matched by the sound of\n14\n15\nJesse Owens name. Every time Owens came on the track and he was on\nfrequently because he ran in four different races, and qualifying times and\nqualifying races for all those races. Every time Jesse appeared on the track the\ncrowd would yell, Oo vens, Oo vens, the w in German is pronounced as av. And\nthey would shout with the same amount of fervor it seemed for Jesse as they\nsounded for Seig Heil. Oo vens. Oo vens. It was a remarkable thing to see this\nmarvelous black athlete saluted by a hundred and twenty thousand Germans.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a great story. Now when Owens wasn\u2019t coming out on the field was there\nanything alarming about this Seig Heil in unison, a hundred and twenty thousand,\nor I don\u2019t know how many people were actually shouting it, but what seemed like\nthe entire stadium?",
        "A: Uh, I never felt as though there was anything alarming in terms of uh the Seig\nHeil, a feeling of fear or anything like that. It was almost as though uh we in, in\nthe States were singing the National Anthem or uh, uh stating uh the pledge of\nallegiance to our flag. Uh it was uh it was fairly brief. Hitler would walk in with\nan entourage of uh Goering and Goebbels and Hess and Himmler and Stryker and\ntake their seats in this box with Hitler in the middle, slightly forward of the rest of\nthe group, and Goering with his uh resplendent, outlandish uniforms uh wildly\ndecorative and Goebbels the rat like face and the rest uh Hess with a very dark\nbeard that he had. Uh they, they sat there. Uh and uh Hitler particularly was\nextremely nervous when German athletes ran. He\u2019d sit in his seat and rub his\nthighs and, and, and move back and forth as I\u2019m doing now, and uh he was\nobviously very much involved in the race. And he was, I thought he was nervous\nfor his own athletes. When other athletes competed, he just sat there uh quietly\nand observed. Uh he was thrilled, overjoyed, smiled when uh German athletes\nwent to the winning podium. When the black athletes went to the winning\npodium, Hitler was gone. As soon as the black athlete won his gold medal and\nwas going to the podium to receive it, the box would empty out, Hitler\u2019s box\nwould empty out. They\u2019d all be gone and they would not pay homage to the great\nblack athletes who were there. They stayed for the white athletes. But they left\nfor the black athletes.\n(adjustments to Marty\u2019s appearance)",
        "Q: I want to know a little bit about what it was like being in Germany, the Olympic\nvillage, what that was like? Did you take little side trips into town or into other\nareas as a tourist? If you can tell me a little bit about the mood before the\nOlympics.",
        "A: The event I was supposed to run, the 400 meter relay, was uh one of the last\nevents in the track and field program. It came, the trials came on the penultimate\nday and the final day of the games for track and field was the final of the 400\nmeter run. So uh [had plenty of time and so did the other athletes, except fellows\n15\n16\nlike uh Jesse Owens and uh one or two others who competed in several events, uh\nI had plenty of time to uh go into Berlin during the morning hours usually or late\nin the afternoon after the afternoon events took place and I uh had my freedom\nthroughout Berlin. I could hitch a ride if I chose to, get aboard a, a bus or a\ntrolley, or whatever, because I was wearing a, an Olympic uniform and I had\nOlympic identification of all sorts on me, and uh it, it was, 1t was beautiful, it was\nlovely. Uh I walked along uh Unter der Linden uh I thought that Unter der\nLinden, later I went to Paris and walked along the Champs Elysee. I believed\nthen that uh the Camps Elysee was not as attractive as Unter der Linden in Berlin\nbut that was my own personal feeling about it. Uh the Olympic village was a, a\nbeautiful campus of bungalows and low lying houses which uh housed the uh\nvarious teams of the Olympic games. Uh and it was like a college campus. Uh\nslightly rolling hills, low hills and uh dotted with uh these bungalows and\ndifferent buildings there. There was a practice track, there was a swimming area,\nuh an indoor natautorium, and uh we worked out at the practice track. The single\nmost important thing I got from the games was the fact that the other athletes of\nthe world were just like me. And I was just like they. Uh I worked out with\nHungarian athletes and uh, uh Romanian athletes and British athletes, French,\nJapanese athletes. We had many things in common. The things involving our\nsports uh and uh I\u2019d jog alongside of the different athletes. I walked alongside of\nthem of the dining room and rooms but we were with each other and we enjoyed\neach other\u2019s presence even though we couldn\u2019t communicate very well with most\nof the teams of the world because I didn\u2019t speak their language and they didn\u2019t\nspeak mine. Talked to the English, of course, and talked to those who spoke\nEnglish. Uh there was one Finn, a great Finnish athlete named Gunnar Harkert.\nUh Gunnar was uh the 5,000 meter champion. A young man in his early twenties\nwho was a beautiful blond, blue \u2014 eyed, apple cheeked young man, and a great,\ngreat runner. He won the gold medal. And he spoke good English. And we spent\na great deal of time with Gunnar because he liked being with the American\nathletes. He liked speaking English and we liked Gunnar. And to my shock and\nhorror, he was killed in the Russian \u2014 Finnish war just a few years after the\nOlympic games. But knowing him and knowing the other athletes, even just\nbeing with them for this limited amount of time, made me feel like one of them.\nAnd I think they felt like one of us. It was a wonderful education for all of us and\nme particularly.",
        "Q: Did you mingle with German athletes?",
        "A: The German athletes usually stayed to themselves. The German athletes worked\nout together. Worked out by themselves. Uh they weren\u2019t as free, as loose, as\neasy as athletes from other countries of the world.\n(end Tape 2 of 4)\n(Tape 3 of 4)\n16\n17",
        "Q: You were saying that you had time before your event or your supposed event in\nthe Olympics and you were able to go into Berlin and all that. In this did you feel\nanything about the atmosphere? Was it charged? Did you see signs saying No\nJews Here? Did you experience any of what was to come?",
        "A: In my time in Germany I felt and saw nothing overt. I saw no signs. I heard no\nverbiage of any sort. I speak a little German because of the Yiddish that I know\nand I took some German at school. Uh and I heard nothing and I saw nothing\nwhich was anti \u2014 Semitic in any way, except for the day that I was supposed to\nrun the trial heats of the 400 meter relay. And uh, uh that was the first anti and\nonly anti \u2014 Semitism that I experienced. And I experienced it from American\ncoaches and not from Germans. There was no overt sign of any anti \u2014 Semitic\nfeeling or activity at all that I saw in Berlin or wherever I went in Germany.",
        "Q: Now Herman Goldberg your pal at the Olympics mentioned a trip into Berlin\nwhere I guess you hitched a ride with some German soldiers. What happened\nthere?",
        "A: One of the ways of getting from the Olympic village to the Olympic stadium\nwhich was about eight miles distant from the Olympic village was to hitch a ride.\nAnd uh Herman Goldberg, my buddy and I, hitched a ride in what amounts to a\nGerman Army jeep. And it was driven by a German sergeant who looked like a\nNazi sergeant and he sat alongside of his passenger who was a, a very handsome\nLieutenant in the German army, blond, blue \u2014 eyed, most attractive looking man.\nAnd as we got into the jeep, hitching the ride, they asked for our autographs. And\nwe said we\u2019ll give it to you when we get off the jeep. Which we did. Uh we took\nthese uh eight miles at a what we thought was a reckless speed to begin with. We\ncould see the speedometer going up to uh 70, 80, 90, 100. 100 kilometers we\nfinally realized and not a 100 miles an hour, almost uh only half the speed. At\nany rate we get to uh the Olympic stadium and uh they, they give us some paper\nto sign our names and we scrawled our names, Herman Goldberg, Marty\nGlickman and left almost immediately. Uh we didn\u2019t want them to have them ask\nquestions about our names, Goldberg, Glickman, were we Jewish, or do we have\nGerman Jewish background or whatever. We were aware of the fact that we were\nwith this German Lieutenant uh and this German sergeant who looked every inch\nthe typical Nazi Army officer and under officer.",
        "Q: So you knew that there was potential for problems?",
        "A: We were aware of the fact that uh there was anti \u2014 Semitism in Germany. We\nwere aware of the fact that these were obviously German soldiers, perhaps Nazis,\nbut we thought all Germans uh all soldiers certainly uh were sympathetic to the\nNazis. And uh we just didn\u2019t know what Nazism was. Remember. This is from\nthe prospective of two years before Kristallnacht. Uh the Holocaust was not only\nnot a thought, it didn\u2019t exist in our imagination, 1n our dreams uh we, we didn\u2019t\nhave nightmares about the Holocaust. It was a word that I didn\u2019t even know in\n17\n18\n1936. Uh certainly had we uh any inkling of what was going to happen, we\nwouldn\u2019t have been in Germany in the first place. But uh the uh, uh the feeling\nabout anti \u2014 Semitism for me and probably for Herman and the two other Jews\nwho uh whom I knew uh on, on the team. There was a, a fine basketball player\nnamed Sam Bolter who was on the team and Herman and I and uh, uh there was\nanother Jewish athlete uh, uh who. The Jewish athletes I knew on the team uh\nwere Herman Goldberg, who was my buddy much of the time, and Sam Stoller\nwho was team mate on the 400 meter relay, and Sam Bolter was a, a wonderful\nbasketball player, a guard on the basketball team and uh the four of us were the\nonly Jews I was aware of. I understand now there were three other Jews who\nwere on the uh American Olympic team, but I didn\u2019t know them then. I didn\u2019t\nknow they were Jewish. But the, the four of them I knew, the four of us were the\nJews whom I knew. And we certainly were not aware of what was to come. I\nguess the whole world was not aware of, of what was to come.",
        "Q: So Berlin was like any other big city, but very beautiful.",
        "A: Berlin was like any other big city. If I would use a single word to describe Berlin\nduring that period of time. The word would be carnival. There was an atmosphere\nof carnival about Berlin with the flags flying and the beautiful weather, almost\nevery day uh it was, it was golden. Fleecy white clouds occasionally overhead.\nLate in the day, on a couple of days, there was some rain at the stadium. But most\nof the time it was just lovely. The city was immaculate as I understand it still is\nand as I saw a couple of years when I was back there again. And uh the people\nwere well dressed and seemingly well fed. Uh the beer flowed and uh it was a\ncarnival atmosphere.",
        "Q: Now before I get to, I want you to tell me about how you were basically dumped\nfrom the race, but I just wanted to ask you on the boat or in the Olympic village,\ndid you get to know John Woodruff at all?",
        "A: I knew John Woodruff uh slightly from the various track meets in which we\ncompeted at the same time. He ran the half mile. I was the sprinter running a 100\nmeters and sometimes 200 meters. And John and I were among the younger\nmembers of the team. Uh John was a, a uh a wonder athlete. He was taller than\nvirtually anyone else on the, on the squad except for some basketball players, six\nfeet four, a quiet, reserved, and a magnificent runner. He had the longest stride,\nrunning stride, in the world at that time. And he ran a marvelous race to win the\ngold medal at 800 meters. He was far better than the rest of the field as you\nprobably know and have seen, he virtually came to a halt at the half \u2014 way mark\nof the race, at the end of the first quarter, let the rest of the field go by because he\nwas pocketed in. He couldn\u2019t get to the outside. He couldn\u2019t make a move\nbecause there were runners in front of him and along side of him, so he let the\nfield go by him, ran around the entire field and then came on to win handily down\nthe stretch and down the backstretch first, around the far turn and around the\nstretch, and uh, a quiet, self \u2014 effacing, and a uh just a wonderful athlete.\n18\n19",
        "Q: Now tell me about your anticipation for your event. I know you were training for\nit, and what happened?",
        "A: The 400 meter relay was selected beforehand and the four of us in order, Sam\nStoller would start, he had the best start of the group of us. I was to run the\nsecond leg down the back stretch straightway. Floyd Draper run the third leg.\nAnd Frank Wycoff run the anchor leg. He was the great veteran. This was his\nthird Olympic team that he was on. And we practiced passing the baton and\npassing the baton is terribly important in the 400 meter relay because the race is\nshort and you to make a, a, a good pass, the best possible pass. And we practiced\nthis every day. In that order. So that we knew each other and we knew the\ndistance we had to start running and things like that. The morning of the day we\nwere supposed to run in the trial heats, we were called into a meeting, the seven\nsprinters were, along with Gene Cromwell, the assistant head track coach, and\nLawrence Robertson, the head track coach. And Robertson announced to the\nseven of us that he\u2019s heard very strong rumors that the Germans were saving their\nbest sprinters, hiding them, to upset the American team in the 400 meter relay.\nAnd consequently, Sam and I were to be replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph\nMetcalfe. Now there\u2019s no question that Jesse and Ralph were faster at 100 meters\nthan Sam and I. They\u2019d beaten us fairly regularly. And we were shocked. Uh\nSam was completely stunned. He didn\u2019t say a word in the meeting. I\u2019m a brash\n18 year old kid and I said coach, you can\u2019t hide world class sprinters. In order to\nbe a world class sprinter you must run in world class competition. And we don\u2019t\nknow of any Germans outside of Erik Borkmaier who finished fifth in the 100\nmeter final beaten by Frank Wycoff, the, as well as Jesse Owens and Ralph\nMetcalfe. He was the best German sprinter. Later I beat Borkamier in another\npost Olympic track meet, but we all knew we could beat Borkmaier, and you\ndon\u2019t hide world class sprinters. I said coach there can\u2019t be any German world\nclass sprinters. He says well we\u2019re going to take no chances, said Dean\nCromwell. And Jesse and Ralph are going to take Sam pla, Sam\u2019s place and your\nplace. At which point Jesse spoke up and said coach I\u2019ve won my three gold\nmedals, the 100, the 200, and the long jump. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve had it. Let Marty\nand Sam run. They deserve it, said Jesse. And Cromwell pointed his finger at\nhim and said you\u2019ll do as you\u2019re told. And in those days black athletes did as they\nwere told. And Jesse was quiet after that. But he volunteered not to run, not to\nwin his fourth gold medal so that Sam and I, the only two Jews on the track team,\ncould run and win or try to win. The only way we could have lost that race is had\nwe dropped the baton. Frank Wycoff later said that uh we probably would have\nrun just as fast because our baton passing would have been superior because we\nhad practiced. I spoke up, I said something else, I said coach no matter who runs\nwe\u2019re going to win this race by fifteen yards. We won by fifteen yards. When\nyou see the finish of the race, all you see is Frank Wycoff crossing the finish line.\nYou don\u2019t even see the next, second place finisher. He\u2019s out of the picture. He\u2019s\nthat far back. Fifteen yards behind. The Germans didn\u2019t finish second or third.\nThey finished fourth. They were placed third because the Dutch team ran out of\n19\n20\ntheir lane and so they were disqualified. But they finished third in the race some\nfifteen, sixteen yards back. So the story given us was an out and out lie by\nRobertson and by Dean Cromwell. I believe now that with Hitler\u2019s humiliation\nby having the black athletes stand on the winning podium the many times that\nthey did in the 100, the 200, the 400, the 800, the long jump, the high jump. They\nwere dominating the games. That it would have been further humiliation for\nHitler to have Jews stand on the winning podium. And as I said the only way we\nwould not stand on the winning podium had we dropped the baton. We would\nhave won the race by, by fifteen yards or more. So we didn\u2019t get to run.",
        "Q: Now you say now this is the way you look at it. Try to put yourself back to this\ntime in the summer of 1936 as you were told that you weren\u2019t going to be\nrunning. What was going through your mind? What were you thinking?",
        "A: As I was told that Sam and I would not run | thought that track politics was taking\nplace, that uh Dean Cromwell, the assistant head track coach, wanted to make\nsure that both his boys, Floyd Draper and Frank Wycoff were on the team. And\nso he was making sure they were going to be on because in a trial race in the\nOlympic village three days before this race took place, the 400 meter race took\nplace, we ran a trial heat. And Stoller won the race, beating me by about oh a\nshoulder, a foot, and we both beat Floyd Draper by a yard. So here is Draper\nrunning the relay, whom we had both beaten just a couple of days before and Sam\nand I were not running. In the entire history of the modern Olympic games, now\ngoing into it\u2019s 100\" year, no fit American track and field performer has ever not\ncompeted in the Olympic games except for Sam Stoller and me, the only two\nJews on the 1936 team. Every other American track and field athlete has\ncompeted, so long as he was physically fit, didn\u2019t have a pulled muscle or didn\u2019t\nhave an appendectomy as one of our track athletes did have and couldn\u2019t run, a\nfellow named Hal Smallwood. But with that exception uh every athlete has run.",
        "Q: Okay. But you didn\u2019t. I mean you weren\u2019t thinking in those terms in August of\n\u00b036. You were thinking it was basically favoritism again.",
        "A: In August of \u201936 I thought originally, I did mention in that meeting I did say that\ncoach you know we\u2019re the only two Jews on the track team, Sam and I. There\u2019s\nbound to be a furor about this back home. We\u2019ll worry about that later said Dean\nCromwell. Later, of course, Dean Cromwell also was a member of the American\nFirst committee, that group in America which was sympathetic to the Nazi cause.\nSo my thoughts were that Cromwell was seeing to it that his boys were on that\n400 meter relay. And uh about that threat of other German sprinters that was just\nuh had a whole cloth. It, it, 1t was a complete lie.",
        "Q: What were you feeling? Here you had been preparing for this in a way for years\nand you\u2019d been training especially hard, you were, I\u2019m sure, very, very excited to\nparticipate in the Olympics.\n20\n21",
        "A: I was fortunate. I was young. I was 18. Sam was three years older than I. He\nwas a senior at Michigan. And uh in those days when you finished your college\ncareer that was usually it. And Sam was at the end of his college career. He\nvowed never to run again because of this terrible disappointment. He did run and\nwon a collegiate championship the following year. He did change his mind a bit\nlater on. I as an 18 year old, just out of my freshman year, I vowed that come\n1940, I\u2019d win it all. I'd win the 100, the 200, I\u2019d uh run on the relay. I was going\nto be 22 in 1940 and I'd be at the height of my supposed uh athletic abilities in\nthose years. Of course 1940 never came. There was a war on. 1944 never came.\nBut I was frustrated and angered enough so that I could look ahead and get even\nfour years hence. Young enough to get even. In addition I was a football player\nuh at Syracuse and uh a month from the Olympic games I was going to be playing\nfootball at Syracuse University, my first varsity season then. And uh I had\nsomething to look forward to. I had something to dissipate my disappointment by\nhaving a, a football season too, looming for me.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t even temporarily devastated by this?",
        "A: I was, I was, I was not if you use the word devastated, I was not devastated. I was\nangered. I was frustrated. And as I say I was young enough to think ahead.",
        "Q: Say that again without the as I say.",
        "A: I was not devastated by not being on that 400 meter team. Terribly angry.\nTerribly frustrated. But I was young enough to be able to look ahead to 1940 and\nperhaps win it all, to win the 100 and the 200. I might be at my athletic peak\nwhen I was 22 years of age. Here I was only 18. So I had something to shoot for,\nsomething to look forward to, come 1940 and the next Olympic games. I also had\na football season I was looking forward to because I was going into my\nsophomore year, first year of varsity football, and that occupied my thoughts and\ntime and energies immediately after the games.",
        "Q: You mentioned that Owens stepped forward and said, let these guys run. Did you\nget that kind of support from the other athletes?",
        "A: No one else said anything in that room during the course of this meeting. Ralph\nMetcalfe didn\u2019t say a word. I think he wanted to run on the relay and this\njustification, why, why not, if he could run on the relay. And the only other\nathlete involved who didn\u2019t run was Mac Robinson. Mac, Jackie Robinson\u2019s\nolder brother, already had won the silver medal at 200 meters and he was not as\ngood at 100 meters as he was at 200 meters. In addition he was not involved in\nthe practice of passing the baton. That 400 meter relay was set as I say with uh\nleading off was Sam Stoller with that great start. I was running the second leg,\nFloyd Draper the third leg, Frank Wycoff the anchor leg and we practiced passing\nthe baton 1n that order for two weeks in the Olympic village.\n21\n22",
        "Q: Did the other athletes after this decision had been made, were they supportive or\ndid they or did you guys just not talk about it?",
        "A: They were supportive. The other athletes were supportive afterwards. Uh patted\nme on the back. Say, saying Marty you should have run. Uh not en masse.\nEverybody was involved with his own uh achievements or striding. Uh the, the\nfeeling was that tough luck. But for me, as I say, it was the feeling of I'll show\nthem. I'll get even. I was there. I sat in the stands and watched the race. The\nqualifying heats proved that we were by far the best team among the other\ncountries of the world, the best 400 meter relay team. The following day I was\nwalking across the campus of the Olympic village and I heard my name called to\nme, and 50 yards away was Lawrence Robertson, the head track coach, uh with\nhis cane. He was an older man. Marty, Marty. And I jogged over to him. I just\nwant to tell you how sorry Iam. I made a terrible mistake. And uh he said he\nwas sorry. Dean Cromwell didn\u2019t say a word. Never spoke to me again. Uh I\ndon\u2019t know what he said or thought to anyone else, but he never said a word to\nme. Wycoff later said we would have run just as fast had you and Sam run\nbecause our superior baton passing because of practice could have enabled us to\nrun and win.",
        "Q: Now you started to say you were there watching your meet. What was that like?",
        "A: Watching the trial heat and watching the final the following day were uh strange,\nweird, all sorts of emotions flashed through my being. Uh frustration certainly.\nAnger certainly. I look out on the track and I see Metcalfe passing runners down\nthe backstretch. He ran the second leg. And that should be me out there. As they\nwarmed up, jogging up and down the track, I, that should be me. That, that\u2019s me\nout there. And you know frustrated at it uh feeling uh also feeling relief that I\nwasn\u2019t running in this race. I didn\u2019t have the pressure of receiving the baton,\nrunning with it and passing the baton. I wasn\u2019t fearful of dropping the baton.\nAnd all relay runners have that uncertainty, that fear of the possibility. I\u2019ve never\ndropped a baton in the many relay races I\u2019ve run, but I\u2019ve seen it dropped. So I it\nwas some feeling of relief, but mostly it was anger and frustration and the feeling\nthat should be me out there.",
        "Q: Who were you sitting with during the event?",
        "A: My recollection is I sat with Herman Goldberg uh during the events for either the\ntrial race or the trial heats or for the finals. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t believe I sat\nwith Herman both those days. Very often we would sit together and sometimes\nwe would not. After all he had his own assignments to take care of. He was\npracticing and playing with the American baseball team. But I do believe that for\none of those races either the trial heat or in the final that Herman was alongside\nme.",
        "Q: Did you talk about what was going on?\n22\n23",
        "A: No. I uh I didn\u2019t say a word. Words can\u2019t convey how you feel. Not at the\nmoment anyhow. Uh words wouldn\u2019t have made me feel any better or less angry.\nI uh I just sat there and uh suffered or just felt. I felt all these emotions. And\nagain at the age of 18, the world 1s bright and glorious in front of you. I was a\ngood athlete. I knew that. And uh four years hence I was going to be out there\nagain.",
        "Q: Now when the American team did win and went up to the podium to receive their\nhonors, were you proud for them, were you happy for them?",
        "A: When the American team was on the podium, I was not necessarily proud for\nthem. I was pleased, of course, that they won, and I was particularly pleased that\nthey won by fifteen yards to prove the point that uh anyone, anyone of the\nAmerican uh sprinters could have won on the, run on the relay and won the event\nhandily. But we, I don\u2019t feel as though uh I was an American athlete, or that I\nwas a Jewish athlete. I was an athlete. I was a, a member of the Olympic team. I\nwas in the Olympic stadium. Uh I was part of this overall thing, which I believe\nhas done me so much good in all the years which follow, 60 years now, which\nhave followed those \u201936 games. Where I began to realize that I\u2019m just like the\nother athletes of the world, the other people of the world and they\u2019re just like me.\nWe\u2019re all alike. We\u2019re all brothers. And uh the whole point of the games, the\nwhole point of all athletic competition is to learn to respect each other, to like\neach other, to love each other, to get to really know each other. And I was part of\nthat. And I was also angry.",
        "Q: Were you envious?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I was envious? I uh. The only feeling I have today, I\u2019m a\ngrandfather of 10, and I\u2019m the great \u2014 grandfather of 4. So I don\u2019t have the\ngrandchildren or the great \u2014 grandchildren I can show this gold medal to. That\u2019s\nthe only feeling of disappointment I now have, that I can\u2019t show my grandchildren\nthis gold Olympic medal. That\u2019s the only, the only feeling I have now. I think\nit\u2019s wonderful that I was on the team. I think it\u2019s great that I made this trip. Uh it\nexposed me to, to marvelous things. And also exposed me to the hurt of anti \u2014\nSemitism.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you can tell me about what it was like, not necessarily for\nyour competition in particular, but just what it was like being in the Olympic\nstadium? Can you describe it?",
        "A: The Olympic stadium itself is a very impressive place. Uh it\u2019s a, it was\nparticularly impressive then when filled with a hundred and twenty thousand\npeople and it was virtually brand new. And I'll never forget walking into the\nstadium, marching in along with my American teammates in the opening day\nparade. And I use the word march loosely here because American athletes don\u2019t\n23\n24\nmarch very well. We kind of sclumped in you know in line but ah walking in the\nmanner of loose \u2014 limbed, uh easy going American athletes. And I remember\nlooking up at Adolph Hitler as we walked by, marched by, and he was glaring\ndown at us we thought. And the comment heard in the ranks and I said it also, he\nlooks just like Charlie Chaplin. And that\u2019s just the way we felt about him. He\nwas almost a comic figure with his drab, khaki uniform he wore, khaki shirt and\nkhaki pants. No decorations on it. That funny little moustache and the cowlick\nover his forehead and uh he was a comic figure. Uh I thought of him and I think\nmany of us thought of him as like a typical South American dictator of those\nyears who was here today and gone tomorrow. After all he\u2019d just been in power\nsome two and a half years and who knew how long he was going to last or how\nmuch power he would ultimately have. But uh he was comic to us. Uh along with\nthe rest of his entourage and uh certainly they were funny looking in terms of uh\nGoering and his uniform and Goebbels with his rat like face and some of the\ndiplomats in their with their long frock coats and ascots and uh, uh some of the\nArmy uniforms and Naval uniforms around them. So uh it was uh it was uh an\nexperience I\u2019m pleased to have be a part of. And of I\u2019m still angry at not having\nthat medal to show the kids.",
        "Q: Was there something awesome about marching in with a hundred thousand people\nsitting there?",
        "A: We felt no feeling of awe. We were cocky, young, uh well \u2014 trained, uh good\nathletes. And uh nothing awesome about going into a huge stadium. We\u2019d been\nin huge stadiums before. We\u2019d competed in these huge stadiums. Uh the ha the\nthing I remember, one of the things I remember most, was as part of the opening\nceremonies these thousands of pigeons which had been kept in cages",
        "Q: I need to stop you here cause the tapes...\n(end of Tape 3 of 4)\n(Tape 4 of 4)",
        "Q: When we stopped you were describing what it was like being in the Olympic\nstadium, the pageantry.",
        "A: The opening day parade. One of the things I, I best remember about the uh, uh\nthe opening day ceremonies of the Olympic games was standing in the infield of\nthe stadium while the Olympic oath was being taken and uh the various music\nwas being played, was the release of these thousands of pigeons which had been\ncooped up and they were all, alongside the inner perimeter of the stadium. And\nnow after being in these cages for I don\u2019t know how many hours or how many\ndays, they were suddenly released and they flew up over the stadium and circled\nround and round. And we began to hear on our straw hats that was part of our\nuniform, the straw hats, splat, splat, splat from these pigeons. And we were afraid\n24\n25\nto look up of course or else we\u2019d get it in the eye. But there we were cringing in\nthe stadium and the splat, splat of all these thousands of pigeons going round and\nround and finally they went far enough up to get out of the stadium and flew\naway. It was a very funny moment.",
        "Q: Do you remember. Were you at the closing ceremonies?",
        "A: No. We, we left before the end of the Olympic games. Avery Brundage I\nbelieve, the head of the American Olympic committee, was the basic reason, I\nbelieve that Sam and I didn\u2019t get to run in the Olympic games. Adolph Hitler was\nbeing humiliated by the great success of the black American athletes and I think\nthat he wanted to see to it that Jewish athletes didn\u2019t stand on the winning podium\nand further humiliate Adolph Hitler, embarrass him with that nonsense about\nAryan supremacy because here were the great black athletes who couldn\u2019t be\nkept off the winning podium because of their number and their great reputations.\nAnd they were marvelous. But here were two rather obscure Jewish American\nathletes who could be kept from the winning podium and I believe that Avery\nBrundage who was close to Hitler, who had examined Germany for anti \u2014\nSemitism the year before to see whether or not the games should be held in\nGermany. Here was Avery Brundage keeping Jews from the winning podium so\nas not to further embarrass Adolph Hitler.",
        "Q: This was something that you realized later.",
        "A: I was, I was more aware of it later than Iam. I was more aware of it later uh than\nI was at that time. But uh Brundage was a most important figure. Head of the\nAmerican Olympic Committee and later on the president of the International\nOlympic Committee.",
        "Q: You mentioned you had wanted, or were thinking forward to the 1940 Olympics.\nSo apparently this experience didn\u2019t sour you at all on sports, or fairness,\nOlympics.\nA; My experience in the Olympic games and the fact that I didn\u2019t run didn\u2019t sour me\non the games at all. It soured me on Avery Brundage. It certainly soured me on\nanti \u2014 Semitism and the Nazis as well. But as far as the Olympic games then and\nfor many years thereafter, I was an Olympic uh booster. I didn\u2019t want us to\nboycott the games in the Soviet Union in 1980. I didn\u2019t want the Soviet Union to\nboycott the American games in 1984. But I\u2019m not very happy with the current\nOlympic games. The Olympic games of \u201996 and the enormous commercialization\nof the Olympic games. I think that the Olympic ideal, the Olympic creed, doesn\u2019t\nexist any longer. It\u2019s all strictly professionalism. I think that the current Olympic\ngames in Atlanta is a huge project for profit and that\u2019s about all.",
        "Q: At what point after the games did you become more aware of what was actually\ntaking place in Germany and in Europe?\n25\n26",
        "A: I became aware of what took place in Germany in 1938, Kristallnacht was the\nbeginning of the knowledge generally of what took place in Germany. In 1936\neven the German Jews stayed in Germany until 1938. Many left but far more\nremained in Germany until \u201938 and then they started to try to get out of Germany.\nOf course, I didn\u2019t know about uh the Holocaust until after the war was over. I\nwas a, a marine in the, in the central Pacific during World War II on the Marshall\nIslands and uh the European campaign was that far distant from our involvement\nin the Pacific. So it wasn\u2019t until I came back in December of \u201945 that I began to\nrealize, began to hear and know of what took place in the years, the closing years\nof World War IT",
        "Q: Did you rethink at all about your participation in 1936/ I mean when you started\nlearning much more, did it make you think about it all in context?",
        "A: I\u2019ve been asked many times whether I have second guesses about going to\nGermany in 1936 and uh I persist in saying that I\u2019m delighted I went. Uh I\u2019m\nglad that the games took place in 1936. UhI saw no harm from the games\nthemselves. I saw a great deal of good from the games. For me as an individual\nlearning about the other athletes of the world and for the great success of the non\n\u2014 Aryan athletes, the marvelous black athletes who had this great success in\nhelping smash that myth of Aryan supremacy. I think that was a very positive\nthing.",
        "Q: Did you afterwards think more about being a Jewish athlete? I mean did it,\nbecause in fact that seems to be what happened in 1936 even though prior to that\nyou never considered yourself a Jewish athlete. You were one.",
        "A: Something took place in 1937 which uh was a direct result of what happened to\nme in 1936. I was playing football at Syracuse and uh for this particular I was the\nstar of the team. We had upset Cornell the week before and uh I had uh scored\nboth touchdowns for Syracuse against Cornell 14 to 6 was the final score. And\nI\u2019d had the best day I ever had on the football field. Lot of publicity about me\nthen. And uh I\u2019m embarrassed almost to say it, I was the star of the team going to\na game against Maryland, in Baltimore. And as we\u2019re getting dressed for the\ngame sitting alongside of me is the other starting half \u2014 back. His name is\nWilmoth Sedette Sing. He is a black man but his mother married a Hindu\nphysician and Will and I played side by side. We\u2019re in the same class. We took\nclasses together. He helped me through my physics class, my physics course.\nLater he was a member of the uh the black airmen, the black squadron who helped\nform uh the one squadron of black aviators in World War II. But this was in\nBaltimore, Maryland. We\u2019re being dressed for the game. He\u2019s sitting right\nalongside of me, right here. He slept alongside of me where we slept in the, in the\ngym during the football season. And the coach came in, Ossie Solom along with\nthe Director of Athletics Lou Andreas and he said uh fellows I\u2019ve got some news.\nUh the local press and Maryland had just found out that Will is not a Hindu but\n26\n27\nhe\u2019s a black man and consequently he won\u2019t play today. And I said to myself\nsitting there, stand up Marty and say if Will doesn\u2019t play, I don\u2019t play. And I\u2019m\none of the leaders of the team. I\u2019m the star of the team, this week anyhow\nbecause of that previous game the week before. And I say stand up and say that.\nAnd I think to myself, but if I do stand up and say that and the game is cancelled\nand there\u2019s ruckus or this furor develops as a result of the game being cancelled, if\nthat happens they\u2019II point to me and there\u2019s that Jewish guy getting in trouble\nagain. Because just the year before I\u2019d been involved in the anti \u2014 Semitic\nincident in Berlin. And so I didn\u2019t say a word. And Will didn\u2019t play. And I\nplayed. And we got beat. We got beat twelve nothing. A couple of years after\nthat, Will was killed in World War II and to this day I still feel very strongly\nabout it. That I should have gotten up and said and he was good enough to die for\nour country, but he wasn\u2019t good enough to play against Maryland.",
        "Q: I want to ask you one more question. (Straighten jacket and tie0",
        "A: After the Olympic games uh many of the track and field athletes toured Europe\nand several different track meets. I ran on a 400 yard relay team in London at\nWhite City Stadium. I ran with Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe and Frank\nWycoff and me. We set a world\u2019s record at 400 yards. That world\u2019s record still\nstands. Mostly because they rarely run that race and they don\u2019t run yards any\nmore they now run meters. So um the four of us are still world record holders at\nthe 400 yard relay. I also ran in Paris after the uh Olympic games. Ran against\nFrank Wycoff and uh I won the race against Wycoff that day and uh a\ncombination of uh Japanese and French athletes as well as American athletes\ncompeted that day. And I won that race. Also ran in Scotland. Iran ina\nhandicap race and uh didn\u2019t win that handicap race. Uh I was set back so far from\nthe rest of the field because these were local athletes in uh in Edinburgh, Scotland,\nthat uh I was literally off the track, uh that far back, and had to run up a slight\nincline to get to the track and then start running. I finished out of the money.",
        "Q: So I think what you\u2019re telling me from those first few races is that you probably\nwere good enough to run in the Olympics.",
        "A: Well, I, I was on the team.",
        "Q: But to have actually competed instead of all that stuff you were...",
        "A: Do you want me to say that.",
        "Q: Sure. All of a sudden a few weeks after the Olympics, you\u2019re making a world\nrecord in the same event.",
        "A: I don\u2019t want to brag. I mean it\u2019s been said. I, I was on the team. That\u2019s the\nimportant thing. I made the team and the obviously I was good enough to be uh\nto run in the Olympic games because I was on the American team. And uh\n27\n28\nAmerican athletes compete in the Olympic games when they make the Olympic\nteam, except for these two Jewish athletes who didn\u2019t because of Avery Brundage\nand Adolph Hitler and anti \u2014 Semitism. And I\u2019d like to add one other thing that\nsometimes people feel sorry for me and what happened to me in, in Germany, in\nBerlin, in 1936. What happened to me was as nothing, absolutely zero to that\nwhich took place later on. There\u2019s just no feeling of uh comparison and no\nfeeling of, of hurt. Uh there\u2019s still feeling of anger, but uh I was there and uh that\nmattered. What took place was much, much more important afterwards.",
        "Q: I think I have one more question. You mentioned this race in Maryland.",
        "A: The football game in Maryland.",
        "Q: Right. I\u2019m sorry. The football game. And the fact that you were very conflicted\nabout standing up for this black Indian athlete. Have you thought about ways in\nwhich your experience from the 1936 Olympics impacted you or shaped you in\nterms of values or choices you made afterwards. I know it\u2019s a fairly broad\nquestion, but.",
        "A: I think my experience in 1936, my experience in athletics generally specifically in\n\u00b036 made me aware of the fact that I am not different than other people of the\nworld. I am not different than blacks or browns or yellows or whites. That we\u2019re\nall one. And uh I think I\u2019ve learned not to be tolerant necessarily because\ntolerance I think implies sort of a uh a superiority over individuals. But I\u2019ve\nlearned to appreciate other people I think because of my experience in \u201936 and my\nexperience in athletics.",
        "Q: Did it make you more vigilant toward racism, anti \u2014 Semitism, discrimination?",
        "A: I think the experience of all athletes makes me more conscious of other people, of\nbias and prejudice against uh Black and Asiatics and Latins and Jews. I think that\nwe're people. I\u2019ve learned that through sports. I think that at every level of sports\nfrom my days as a schoolboy to my days as a broadcaster has enabled me to\nthoroughly enjoy and appreciate the abilities of the great athletes. I was able to\nlook at and broadcast about. The Jim Browns. The wonderful Black athletes, the\nwonderful Japanese athletes, uh the great athletes of the world uh regardless of\nwhat their background was.",
        "Q: Sports is the great equalizer.",
        "A: Sports is the great equalizer. The fellow who gets to the finish line first 1s the\nwinner. Uh brings to mind another thought that uh the Olympic games should be\nuh a competition amongst individuals and not amongst teams because teams\nrepresent nationalities. Individuals represent themselves. Even though we wore\nthe uniform of the United States Olympic Team, we ran as individuals. For the\nrelay, the relay is a unique track and field event, four men running together but\n28\n29\nrunning individually together. Uh basketball and hockey, great sports, they\u2019re\nwonderful sports, and football too, of course, but the, the point of sports is the\nexultation the individual athlete feels when he does it by himself. And that\u2019s the\npoint of the Olympic games. Team sports are marvelous. They teach all the\nthings that ought to be taught in terms of team work and cooperation and practice\nand respect for the other team and all that. But uh, the Olympic games are for the\nindividual and for the extolling of the individual abilities, the excellence of the\nindividual rather than the nation or the team.",

        "Q: Was that very important to you as a boy?",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you start that again because you\u2019ve sort of conflicted yourself. What\nkind of neighborhood were you brought up in demographically?",
        "Q: Then you didn\u2019t feel any anti-Semitism from the non-Jewish kids?",
        "Q: So you really never felt in any way slighted because you were Jewish or you\nnever saw that as something that you\u2019d have to rally against?",
        "Q: Then there was that distinction. How important were sports and how did you get\ninvolved in sports?",
        "Q: So you started sports at a fairly early age?",
        "Q: Now when did this running and sort of neighborhood sports become sports in a\nmore organized fashion?",
        "Q: So sports were very important to you it seems.",
        "Q: Then your goal was to be this quintessential All \u2014 American guy?",
        "Q: So there is actually one story I\u2019m curious about. When you talk about how active\nyou were in sports and how they really were your life at that point. Did you think\nthat you had a future in sports, that you might be thinking in terms of Olympics or\nan athletic career?",
        "Q: After you read that did you think ah ha maybe that is where I\u2019m going or is that\nsomething I should aspire to?",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you to repeat one sentence. Not the whole thing. When you said\nsomething about not until I was in my freshman year. Can you say not until I was\nin my freshman year in college?",
        "Q: Having all of a sudden this thought or goal, was there anything different about\nbeing a Jewish American athlete than just being another great athlete?",
        "Q: Did it motivate you differently? Did you think about it differently when you\ncompeted?",
        "Q: At this time you\u2019re a little bit older, you\u2019re a little bit smarter about what\u2019s going\non in the rest of the world, were you more aware of the restrictions applied to\nJews. I mean in your, in your community growing up it was very mixed. It didn\u2019t\nseem to be an issue. But were you aware that there was anti \u2014 Semitism in\nAmerica, that you couldn\u2019t go everywhere you wanted to and that sort of thing?",
        "Q: How much in the early 30\u2019s did you know about what was going on in Europe and\nGermany in particular?",
        "Q: I think 35. There were restrictions from 33.",
        "Q: ...Start over.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t have any family in Europe?",
        "Q: Okay. It\u2019s just interesting to know, you know, what you knew before going over\nto Germany. Tell me about qualifying for the Olympics. How did that come\nabout?",
        "Q: How did you place in those final rounds? What happened there?",
        "Q: Yeah. I guess I\u2019m asking was there something that happened there, that was a\nprecursor of anything else?",
        "Q: And you think it was clearly favoritism, not the fact that you were a Jew?",
        "Q: Any other Jews on the team?",
        "Q: We'll get to that. Now after you qualified for the Olympic team, what sort of\npreparation was there between those qualifying rounds at Randall\u2019s Island and\ngoing to Berlin?",
        "Q: Now this sounds pretty exciting. I don\u2019t know how much you had traveled before\nthen, but winning these rounds and then a few days later being on a boat going to\nEurope sounds like a big deal.",
        "Q: What was it like on the boat?",
        "Q: I want to backtrack for a moment. Prior to your going to Berlin, do you\nremember any conversation, any newspaper articles, any talk of America\nboycotting the Olympics because of what was going on already in Germany?",
        "Q: And you weren\u2019t aware that there were athletes who had decided not to go on\ntheir own?",
        "Q: So this was just not an issue?",
        "Q: Tell me about the trip over, the anticipation, what it was like being on the boat?",
        "Q: What was going on on that boat? What was the mood? People were I assume\nfairly excited.",
        "Q: How were you spending your time on the boat?",
        "Q: Was there any special camaraderie amongst the few Jewish athletes on the boat?",
        "Q: Now when you say you talked a lot, what did you talk about? What it was going\nto be like in Berlin competing or?",
        "Q: Did you think about the fact that you were representing the United States in the\nOlympics?",
        "Q: What\u2019s the reality of what you\u2019re saying that there is that there are no, are you\nsaying theoretically there are no national lines, there are no politics in the\nOlympics? I mean that certainly isn\u2019t my perception.",
        "Q: Well I just clearly nations have used those gold medals in a political framework.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t necessarily need to belabor this, but except for that in 1936 Germany\u2019s\nsuccesses not only in presenting the Olympics but in also winning a lot of medals,\nmay have been an encouragement, may have spurred them on in ways at that time.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to your story now. So you had this terrific boat ride over and tell\nme about your arrival and getting to Berlin and all of that.",
        "Q: Let me just stop. You arrived on the boat in Hamburg. Yes?",
        "Q: Was there anybody there to greet you?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "Q: What did he tell you about the political climate in Germany as a Jew?",
        "Q: All of these people who greeted you at the train station in Berlin, were they\ncarrying swastikas, was there any of that?",
        "Q: And it wasn\u2019t sort of an unnerving amount of patriotism?",
        "Q: That\u2019s a great story. Now when Owens wasn\u2019t coming out on the field was there\nanything alarming about this Seig Heil in unison, a hundred and twenty thousand,\nor I don\u2019t know how many people were actually shouting it, but what seemed like\nthe entire stadium?",
        "Q: I want to know a little bit about what it was like being in Germany, the Olympic\nvillage, what that was like? Did you take little side trips into town or into other\nareas as a tourist? If you can tell me a little bit about the mood before the\nOlympics.",
        "Q: Did you mingle with German athletes?",
        "Q: You were saying that you had time before your event or your supposed event in\nthe Olympics and you were able to go into Berlin and all that. In this did you feel\nanything about the atmosphere? Was it charged? Did you see signs saying No\nJews Here? Did you experience any of what was to come?",
        "Q: Now Herman Goldberg your pal at the Olympics mentioned a trip into Berlin\nwhere I guess you hitched a ride with some German soldiers. What happened\nthere?",
        "Q: So you knew that there was potential for problems?",
        "Q: So Berlin was like any other big city, but very beautiful.",
        "Q: Now before I get to, I want you to tell me about how you were basically dumped\nfrom the race, but I just wanted to ask you on the boat or in the Olympic village,\ndid you get to know John Woodruff at all?",
        "Q: Now tell me about your anticipation for your event. I know you were training for\nit, and what happened?",
        "Q: Now you say now this is the way you look at it. Try to put yourself back to this\ntime in the summer of 1936 as you were told that you weren\u2019t going to be\nrunning. What was going through your mind? What were you thinking?",
        "Q: Okay. But you didn\u2019t. I mean you weren\u2019t thinking in those terms in August of\n\u00b036. You were thinking it was basically favoritism again.",
        "Q: What were you feeling? Here you had been preparing for this in a way for years\nand you\u2019d been training especially hard, you were, I\u2019m sure, very, very excited to\nparticipate in the Olympics.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t even temporarily devastated by this?",
        "Q: Say that again without the as I say.",
        "Q: You mentioned that Owens stepped forward and said, let these guys run. Did you\nget that kind of support from the other athletes?",
        "Q: Did the other athletes after this decision had been made, were they supportive or\ndid they or did you guys just not talk about it?",
        "Q: Now you started to say you were there watching your meet. What was that like?",
        "Q: Who were you sitting with during the event?",
        "Q: Did you talk about what was going on?",
        "Q: Now when the American team did win and went up to the podium to receive their\nhonors, were you proud for them, were you happy for them?",
        "Q: Were you envious?",
        "Q: Is there anything else you can tell me about what it was like, not necessarily for\nyour competition in particular, but just what it was like being in the Olympic\nstadium? Can you describe it?",
        "Q: Was there something awesome about marching in with a hundred thousand people\nsitting there?",
        "Q: I need to stop you here cause the tapes...",
        "Q: When we stopped you were describing what it was like being in the Olympic\nstadium, the pageantry.",
        "Q: Do you remember. Were you at the closing ceremonies?",
        "Q: This was something that you realized later.",
        "Q: You mentioned you had wanted, or were thinking forward to the 1940 Olympics.\nSo apparently this experience didn\u2019t sour you at all on sports, or fairness,\nOlympics.",
        "Q: At what point after the games did you become more aware of what was actually\ntaking place in Germany and in Europe?",
        "Q: Did you rethink at all about your participation in 1936/ I mean when you started\nlearning much more, did it make you think about it all in context?",
        "Q: Did you afterwards think more about being a Jewish athlete? I mean did it,\nbecause in fact that seems to be what happened in 1936 even though prior to that\nyou never considered yourself a Jewish athlete. You were one.",
        "Q: I want to ask you one more question. (Straighten jacket and tie0",
        "Q: So I think what you\u2019re telling me from those first few races is that you probably\nwere good enough to run in the Olympics.",
        "Q: But to have actually competed instead of all that stuff you were...",
        "Q: Sure. All of a sudden a few weeks after the Olympics, you\u2019re making a world\nrecord in the same event.",
        "Q: I think I have one more question. You mentioned this race in Maryland.",
        "Q: Right. I\u2019m sorry. The football game. And the fact that you were very conflicted\nabout standing up for this black Indian athlete. Have you thought about ways in\nwhich your experience from the 1936 Olympics impacted you or shaped you in\nterms of values or choices you made afterwards.

        "A: My father was not an extremely religious person. As a matter of fact uh he was\nJewish. We observed the High Holy Days. Occasionally on Shabbat we\u2019d go to\nsynagogue, only occasionally. My grandfather and grandmother on my mother\u2019s\nside were, kept a kosher home uh with the two sets of dishes and the silverware\nand things like that. I was bar mitzvahed.

My two daughters were not bar mitzvahed, but we have a Jewish\nbackground, a Hebrew background.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t uh very important in terms of my uh, uh grand feeling about Judaism. I\nwas like any other kid. I, I was brought up in Jewish neighborhoods, mixed\nneighborhoods actually. Uh we lived amongst Italians and Irish.",
        "A: I was brought up in a, a mixed neighborhood. I was brought up in a, a mixed\nIrish, Italian and Jewish neighborhood. There certainly were as many Jewish\nboys around with whom I played as there were people of other faiths. And I\ndidn\u2019t feel unusual about being a Jew. Uh many of my friends went to Hebrew\nschool with me and many of my classmates in school were Jews. Uh it was uh\nnothing out of the ordinary being Jewish in my neighborhood.\n1\n2",

And, and uh I found this true until I ran\nagainst Jesse Owens, He was the one fellow I couldn\u2019t beat, never could beat\nhim. But other than that I was, as I say, the fastest kid around. And because of\nthat I had an advantage in any sport I played. So I played, punch ball, and box\nball, and ring-a-leaveo, the games kids played in the Bronx and Brooklyn in those\ndays. And when I started playing basketball or baseball or football, because I had\nthe speed, I had an advantage and so I could be perhaps better than some of the\nother guys.

And of all things I swam on the swimming team.\nAnd in those days athletes played all sports in season. In the spring and summer\nyou played baseball. In the fall you played football.

        "A: Sports were critical to me. Uh my life was built around sports. And I think it\nbegan when I started reading the Merrywell books. Now uh those of you who are\nmy age may well remember the Merrywell books. They were written by Bert L.\nStandish and Frank Merrywell was the premier hero. He had a younger brother\nnamed Dick Merrywell who also was a great athlete. And Frank Merrywell\nmarried and had a son named Frank Merrywell, Jr., who also was a great athlete.\nAnd I wanted to be like Frank Merrywell junior or senior or Dick Merrywell.\nAnd uh the exploits of the book, I started reading them I guess when I was 12\nyears of age, and I wanted to duplicate those exploits. He ultimately went to\nYale. Became an all \u2014 American football player, basketball player, a champion in\nall the sports he participated in and a, a well \u2014 rounded All \u2014 American type\nperson.

It was only in my uh freshman year at Syracuse University that I became\naware of the fact that I might have been a little bit different when at my first\ntraining table meal as a freshman, I asked uh at lunch, the very first meal, please\npass the lamb chops, and everyone laughed at the table, because they weren\u2019t\nlamb chops.

In New York City I was also\naware of the fact that there were certain places I was not welcome. I might go\ninto a hotel for example and uh see a small sign where you registered uh which\nread restricted clientele, which meant in effect no Jews, no Blacks allowed. There\nwere certain areas around New York City where you couldn\u2019t live. Like Darian,\nConnecticut, for example was a place where Jews were not permitted to own\nhomes in Darian.

        "A: I qualified for the Olympic games by winning a series of races to qualify for the\nfinal trials which were held at Randall\u2019s Island in New York City uh the first use\nof that Randall\u2019s Island Stadium for track and field championships. I qualified by\nwinning the metropolitan championships and then the eastern qualifying round up\nat Harvard Stadium in Boston. There were Eastern, Near \u2014 Midwestern, Western,\nand Far western trials and I was the winner of the sprint in the East so I qualified\nfor the final round. It was a series of qualifying rounds and I and about, I would\nguess, 14 other sprinters qualified for the final round. And 1n that final round I\nqualified and made the team.",
        "A: Uh the placement in the final round, in the actual finals, I qualified by finishing\nsecond in my uh in that semi \u2014 final heat uh at Randall\u2019s Island. And uh I\u2019d like\nto tell the story of uh my first race against Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe. Uh\nthese two were the two great black sprinters of the day. Uh we drew uh, uh\nmarbles which we numbered for the lanes in which you ran. I drew lane number\n5. Jesse Owns was in lane number 4. Ralph Metcalfe was in lane number 6. And\n6\n7\nI\u2019m in number 5. So here is Owens, the world\u2019s champion, alongside of me.\nMetcalfe, who\u2019d run and won a silver in the 1932 Olympic games, on the other\nside. These two magnificent athletes on either side of me and I\u2019m scared stiff. I\nmean I was shaking so that when the starter called us to our marks, to put our feet\nin the starting holes, we didn\u2019t use starting blocks in those days, you dug holes\nwith a trowel. When I started to put my front foot, my left foot, in the hole, my\nfoot was shaking so I could not put my foot in that starting hole. It was just\nvibrating so I couldn\u2019t put it down. And all six additional sprinters on either side\nof me were on, on their marks, getting ready to go, and I\u2019m still standing there\nshaking. And the starter called everyone up and called me over to him. I knew\nthe man. Uh he\u2019d started me in some of the high school races I had run, and he\nsaid Marty walk up and down a bit, take a few deep breaths, relax, jog up and\ndown, relax, and we\u2019ll try to start again. And after several minutes uh I was\ncalmed down sufficiently to get my foot into that starting hole. Both feet in and\nwe raced. Uh I don\u2019t remember the gun going off. We were set terribly tense of\ncourse on our marks, and then set, and then I was running. And there was Owens\non my left and Metcalfe on my right and for forty yards I\u2019m running even with\nthem. And then suddenly as though they were on an escalator and I was not they\nwere pulling ahead and moving ahead. And I fought as best I could and I kept\ndropping back. And uh then I realized I wasn\u2019t going to catch either one of them\nand I thought I finished third in the race. Uh so much so that uh Ted Using who\nwas broadcasting the race on the infield of the track, he was the leading track and\nfield broadcaster of the time. Uh Ted called me over after the race and said here\u2019s\nMarty Glickman, the kid from Brooklyn who finished third. Oh wait a second he\nsaid. I see they\u2019ve placed Frank Wycoff third. Marty finished fourth. And he\ninterviews Frank and then he says now here\u2019s Mar, oh just a moment he says, uh\nthey\u2019ve placed Floyd Draper in the fourth place, Marty finished fifth. So he\ninterviewed Floyd Draper and then he, he interviewed me finishing fifth. Which\nis where I was placed. I was a bit upset about that. Uh films from the race\nindicate that uh I beat Floyd Draper by a foot uh. Very little question about that.\nAs for Frank and myself, you could, you could choose the winner between the\ntwo of us, but uh, uh I didn\u2019t know whether I beat Frank or not. Nor did he. Uh\nlater in Paris in a post \u2014 Olympic meet I beat Frank but uh, uh we were virtually\nin a dead heat for third place. So I, Iso remember Dean Cromwell finishing uh,\nuh it\u2019s too long already.",
        "A: Well Dean Cromwell, Dean Cromwell leads to another story which has to do with\nthe selection uh my ouster from the team. So uh if you can fit this in. As we\nfinished the race, I noted that Dean Cromwell, the assistant head track coach of\nthe American Olympic team and the head track coach of the University of\nSouthern California, was in amongst the officials, arguing with them that Frank\nWycoff had finished third and Floyd Draper had finished fourth. Because he was\nthe coach of Southern Cal and Wycoff and Draper ran for Southern Cal or had\n7\n8\nrun. Wycoff was graduated. Had run for Southern Cal. These were his boys and\nhe pushed them amongst the officials uh as finishing third and fourth. And I was\nplaced fifth. I don\u2019t know whether I finished third, fourth, or fifth. I just don\u2019t\nknow. But I do know that Dean Cromwell had a hand in the placement of the\norder of finish.",
        "A: I think it was clearly favoritism that uh he wanted his boys placed third and\nfourth. Uh the fact that I was Jewish I think did not matter at that time. He\nwanted his boys in there. And uh I had made the team anyhow because the first\nseven men were to make the team. The first three finishers running the 100 meter\nrun, and the next four finishers making up the 400 meter relay. So I had made the\nteam.",
        "A: The other Jew on the track team, one other Jew was Sam Stoller. Stoller was\nplaced sixth in the 100 meter final. He finished behind me. He ran a poor race.\nLater Sam beat me in the Olympic Village in a trial race we had amongst the three\nof us. Sam Stoller finishing first. I was beaten by a shoulder by Sam, and we\nboth beat Floyd Draper. Floyd Draper wound up running on the team.",
        "A: We qualified for the Olympic team uh on a uh Friday and we were on board the\nship I believe on Tuesday, heading for uh Berlin. It was almost immediate. Uh\nwe were measured for our uniforms. Uh there were several events we attended,\nuh several ceremonies we attended and we were aboard ship uh within three days\nafter making the team. It was very quick. There was no training period or\nanything like that. We stayed in shape, of course. We kept working out every\nday to make sure we were in good condition. And we took the S.S. Manhattan for\nBerlin.",
        "A: This was quite an experience for me. I had been no farther than Boston. I\u2019d been\nno further south than Philadelphia until that time. I was uh this 18 year old kid\nfrom Brooklyn. I was the second youngest kid on the team, on the track team.\nAnd here I was aboard this magnificent liner heading for Europe and uh it was a\nmost exciting time. Uh it was wonderful, it was thrilling, it was, it was great. It\nwas fulfilling my Frank Merrywell dream partially.\n8\n9",
        "A: The boat was uh informal. It was fun. Uh we, we trained aboard the ship. It was\na, a five day crossing and a sixth day getting uh to Hamburg and then down to\nBerlin by train. Uh but we had no opportunity to really sprint aboard ship. So we\ndid calisthenics, we jogged up and down, we did a great deal of walking aboard\nship. We uh watched our diet fairly carefully. Uh there was no specific training\nregimen because we were all pretty good athletes, had our own different coaches\nand coaching techniques applied to us for months and years beforehand. So we\nwere not concerned with uh being uh directed by the coaches who were on the\nteam. It was a fun time. It was, it was a time that was loose and easy and pleasant\nand, and we looked forward with great anticipation to getting to Europe and\ngetting in competition.\n(end of Tape 1 of 4)\nTape 2 of 4\n(five seconds)",
        "A: At the time we were competing in the uh regional finals and then the finals at\nRandall\u2019s Island uh the talk was so slight that I truly was not aware of the\npossibility of a boycott of the 1936 games. It had very little play in the press if\nany. I don\u2019t remember seeing it in the newspapers or hearing it on the radio. Asa\nmatter of actual fact, no Jewish organization like B\u2019nai Brith or uh ADL or uh the\nAmerican Jewish Congress if there was an AJC then. Uh no Jewish\norganization nor any individual ever said to me, Marty don\u2019t go. There was no\ntalk, general talk, of boycott. I know now that there was a vote taken involving\nthe AAU, the Amateur Athletic Union, and the American Olympic Committee\nand that uh they voted to go. Uh but there was no such publicity or promotion\nsuch as existed in 1980 when the President of our United States, Jimmy Carter, uh\nstrongly recommended that we don\u2019t participate in the 1980 games. There was no\nsuch popular movement at the time of 1936.",
        "A: I was not aware of any athletes who decided not to go. I know now that athletes\nuh say they decided not to go. There was a fine sprinter whom I never met, never\nran against, fellow named Herman Newgas, of Tulane, who determined that he\n9\n10\nwas nor going to try out for the team. Uh he didn\u2019t go, he didn\u2019t try out for the\nteam. But I knew that later, in later years.",
        "A: The fact of going or not going was not an issue. Not as far as I was concerned nor\nin terms of the public press or the populace generally. Uh we didn\u2019t think in\nterms of not going.",
        "A: Being on the boat was fun. Being on the boat was a brand new experience\nparticularly for a kid from Brooklyn or any of us who\u2019d never been abroad. Uh\nI\u2019d been no farther north than uh, uh than Boston. I\u2019d been no farther south than\nPhiladelphia, and here I was uh an eighteen year old kid from Brooklyn uh\nheading for Europe. Uh had been, a name, a place my parents came from, going\nto Germany, and uh visiting other countries as well. Our first stop for example\nwas uh in Ireland with the ship. Just stopping there and seeing it in the distance\nand how beautifully green it was. We stopped in England momentarily at\nPlymouth and I could, uh I couldn\u2019t see the Plymouth Rock or anything like that\nand uh, uh but it was Plymouth England and then we went across to uh, uh\nGermany to uh, uh landed in Hamburg and from Hamburg took the train down\ninto the uh heart of Berlin to the huge Bahnhof in Berlin.",
        "A: All of us were pleased at having made the team. And uh the boat was wide open.\nIn those days a huge ship uh like the Manhattan uh had different classes, first\nclass, second class, uh cabin class or whatever, steerage even. Uh but we had the\nrun of the boat. And uh, uh those we ate in what amounted to uh the uh second\nclass dining room, we were not in the top categories of dining room, we had huge\nmenus to choose from. We were not given training table food. We selected our\nown foods. There was a fellow on the team named Tarzan Brown. Uh an Indian,\nNarragansett Indian from Maine who\u2019d never seen a menu like this before. And\nTarzan was a marathon runner. He weighed perhaps a hundred and thirty pounds.\nUh, uh a great marathon runner. He\u2019d won the Boston marathon. On the team\nand we had uh this huge menu. And every meal, every day, he ate the menu from\ntop to bottom. I mean six appetizers, and two or three soups, and four main\ncourses. In those six days on the ship uh he might have put on between 10 and 11\npounds. He ran the first mile of the marathon and uh then he sat by the wayside\nand uh gave it all up.\n10\n11",
        "A: We spent our time on the boat talking, uh working out, uh calisthenics mostly.\nJogging up and down on some of the very short, straight aways on deck. Uh there\nwas no facility to really work out the way we would have ordinarily on a, a cinder\ntrack or a clay track, certainly no quarter \u2014 mile track aboard ship. Uh but we, we\nstretched, uh we jogged, we walked, we did exercises and uh we talked and we\nread and uh, uh generally it was a group of guys having a good time together.\nThere were women on the team as well, but uh, I guess I was not involved nor\ninterested in any of the women. I had a girlfriend who later became my wife.",
        "A: There was no special camaraderie amongst the Jewish athletes except a, a warm\nfriendship that I developed with a, a baseball player, Herman Goldberg, who was\na catcher on the exhibition baseball team. There was no international baseball\ncompetition. America was practically the only place where baseball was played\nin those days. So it was a demonstration. An exhibition team and he was on the\nteam and on the Olympic team. Herman was, a catcher on the team. We hit it off\nvery nicely. But usually uh with the athletes from the different sports, the track\nathletes stayed together, uh the gymnasts were together, the swimmers were\ntogether. Not that we didn\u2019t fraternize with each other but we had much more in\ncommon with Olympic team.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk about uh about what Europe was going to be like. We talked uh\nabout mostly about America. We talked about uh, uh baseball and football and\nparticularly about track and field. Uh we told stories, we swapped yarns. We\nwere, how can I say it best, we were a bunch of guys who enjoyed each other.\nWe had enormous respect for each other. And I as one of the younger fellows on\nthe team, looked up to some of the older men who were not only older but bigger\nand stronger uh that one. And uh it was just a very pleasant time, a group of\nyoung men being with each other enjoying uh the sea voyage, enjoying each\nother\u2019s company.",
        "A: It\u2019s rather unusual uh for me or any athlete to say that uh we represented America.\nI didn\u2019t feel as though I represented the USA. Uh I represented me. I was a, I\nwas glad I was on the team. It was a goal I had sought. It was uh an achievement\nfor me. It was an individual thing. After all the Olympic games in theory and I\nstrongly believe this, the Olympic games are for the individual, for the excellence\nof the individual and theoretically though we wear national uniforms we don\u2019t\nrepresent the different countries who\u2019s uniforms we wear. We represent athletes.\nWe represent sports. We compete in sports for sports\u2019 sake. The competition 1s\n11\n12\nall important. Winning is not important. Baron de Coubertin who founded the\nmodern Olympic games insisted, has been quoted many times as saying, winning\nis not the goal of the Olympic games, taking part, participating 1s what the\nOlympic games are all about. So it wasn\u2019t as though we were going there to win\nfor the United States. That was the thought that was perhaps in the back of our\nminds. It was not a conscious thought. We were going as athletes, not\nnecessarily as Americans. I was going there as a Jewish American athlete, but as\nan athlete basically. A Jew, an American, and an athlete.",
        "A: People say that there are politics in the Olympic games. I say hogwash. I say\nnonsense. Where does politics fit in when you run 100 meters? Or 1500 meters?\nOr put the shot? Or even play basketball against each other? What politics are\ninvolved? The first man across the finish line wins. No matter what the race.\nThe man who puts the shot a longer distance than any other is the gold medal\nwinner, or spins the discus, or throws the javelin or whatever the event. There are\nno politics amongst the athletes. You talk about politics amongst the nations.\nCertainly. But not as far as the Olympic games are concerned. They don\u2019t exist.\nPolitics are not involved in terms of winning and losing. That\u2019s a good kasook\nright?",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe that at all. I don\u2019t believe that the uh, having uh, medal winners\nfor a particular country in terms of anything important, anything solid. After all,\nthe East Germans were terrific as long as East Germany existed and they uh\nsought and worked hard to get, to develop great Olympic athletes. And the Soviet\nUnion won many, many medals, dominated a couple of Olympic games, and, and\ncertainly the uh, the uh the Italians to some extent won many Olympic events as\nwell as other Fascist countries doing well and centered their interest in the\nOlympic games. And where is the Soviet Union today? Where are the East\nGermans today? Where is Nazi Germany today? They just don\u2019t exist any more\nand Nazi Germany won more medals in the \u201936 games than the United States did.\n33 to 26. Although they won medals for dressage and for pistol shooting and rifle\nshooting and things like that. Uh I don\u2019t see the importance of international\nathletics in terms of politics at all. They say that the governments use it, but even\nthe successful Olympic teams like Germany and East Germany and the Soviet\nUnion, where are they? What good did it do them?\n12\n13",
        "A: Many people say that uh the \u00b036 Olympic games were the Nazi Olympics or\nHitler\u2019s Olympic games. I saw that they were Jesse Owens Olympic games. The\nmyth of Nazi Aryan supremacy was smashed to smithereens by the great non \u2014\nAryan athletes. Black athletes, wonderful black athletes, won the 100, the 200,\nthe 400, the 800, the long jump, uh the high jump, medaled in many other events\nas well. It was the Olympic games of Jesse Owens not of Adolph Hitler. Jesse\nwas idolized by the German population. He couldn\u2019t walk into the stadium using\nthe regular player\u2019s entrance into the stadium. He had to be secreted into the\nstadium. He had to use a secret entrance to get in. Otherwise he\u2019d been mobbed\nby the uh idolizing uh German population or whoever the spectators were and\nthey were mostly Germans in the 120,000 seat stadium. It was Jesse Owens\nOlympics as far as I was concerned, and I think as far as the world was concerned.\nAnd it certainly proved that uh this Aryan business of supremacy was ridiculous.\nThere were non \u2014 Aryans winning the most important events.",
        "A: We arrived at the Bahnof in Berlin at midday in a huge crowd.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We went right to the train.",
        "A: Nothing happened.",
        "A: There was a huge crowd waiting for us at the Bahnhof in Berlin, this huge railroad\nstation, uh newspapermen, camera people with the newsreels, uh photographers,\nfans, officials of all sorts, uniforms of all sorts. Huge crowd waiting on the\nplatform when we arrived. And as we uh got off the train and milled about on the\nplatform I felt a tap on my shoulder. And I turned and saw a smallish looking\nyoung man in his mid \u2014 twenties obviously an American as soon as he talked to\nme, and he said to me are you Marty Glickman. I said yes. He said you\u2019re Jewish\naren\u2019t you. I said yes I am. Slightly taken aback. I said uh why do you ask. He\nsaid well I\u2019m Jewish also. I said you\u2019re Jewish. What are you doing here. He\nsaid I\u2019m going to med school here in Germany. I said you\u2019re going to med school\nhere in Germany. He said yes. I couldn\u2019t get into an American med school. So\nthe feeling I had of Berlin being very much like New York in it\u2019s anti \u2014 Semitism\n13\n14\nor it\u2019s lack of anti \u2014 Semitism uh was similar to New York and Berlin. It was the\nsame sort of city, I thought, particularly as a result of this conversation with this\nyoung man going to med school.",
        "A: I asked him what it was like for you as a Jew here in Germany. He says well in\nBerlin I go practically unnoticed. Nobody knows that I\u2019m Jewish. Uh I\u2019m going\nto med school here. Uh in the shtetels, in the smaller cities around uh Germany\nuh there are problems. But now during the Olympic games and leading up to the\nOlympic games everything is, is, is quite. Uh nothing seems to be going on in\nterms of anti\u2014 Semitism. And as far as my being here in Berlin, I\u2019m just like\nanybody else here in Berlin. I\u2019m going to med school.",
        "A: There was a huge number of uniformed individuals. I noticed and we commented\nabout it, my teammates and I, about the fact that uh there seemed to be no men\nunder the age of approximately 35, no young men who were not in one uniform or\nanother. They were wearing either gray, green or brown. In one uniform or\nanother. No young men in street clothes, in civilian attire, except those who were\nolder than 35 or obviously older than uh the age that we athletes were. Everyone\nseemed to be in uniform. As for banners and flags, they were all over the place,\ndominated by the swastika. The swastika was all over. On virtually every other\nbanner we saw there was a swastika. But this was \u201936. This was before we really\ngot to know what the swastika truly meant. This was two years before\nKristallnacht. This was three years before the outbreak of the war. It was five\nyears before the United States was involved in the war. So the swastika and those\nuh German flags, the black and red and white of the German flags, did, didn\u2019t\nmean very much to us except as a form of decoration.",
        "A: I\u2019d never been asked about the patriotism exhibited by the Germans at that time.\nUh it was a, a, a natural thing to see uh all these German flags. Uh but flags of\nother nations were exhibited as well. Uh they rimmed the stadium. They were on\nthe streets. There were many flags. Mostly German. Most of those German flags\nwere contained the swastika. Uh there was seemed to be no outward display of\npatriotism except when Hitler walked into the stadium. He would walk into his\nbox overlooking the field and I was perhaps 50 to 75 feet away from Hitler\u2019s box.\nAnd he\u2019d walk in and the stands would rise and you\u2019d hear it in unison. Seig\nHeil. Seig Heil. All together, this huge sound reverberating through the stadium.\nThat was the patriotism, the German patriotism I saw. Seig Heil, with a hundred\nand twenty thousand people shouting it, or most of the hundred and twenty\nthousand people. But that same shout of Seig Heil was matched by the sound of\n14\n15\nJesse Owens name. Every time Owens came on the track and he was on\nfrequently because he ran in four different races, and qualifying times and\nqualifying races for all those races. Every time Jesse appeared on the track the\ncrowd would yell, Oo vens, Oo vens, the w in German is pronounced as av. And\nthey would shout with the same amount of fervor it seemed for Jesse as they\nsounded for Seig Heil. Oo vens. Oo vens. It was a remarkable thing to see this\nmarvelous black athlete saluted by a hundred and twenty thousand Germans.",
        "A: Uh, I never felt as though there was anything alarming in terms of uh the Seig\nHeil, a feeling of fear or anything like that. It was almost as though uh we in, in\nthe States were singing the National Anthem or uh, uh stating uh the pledge of\nallegiance to our flag. Uh it was uh it was fairly brief. Hitler would walk in with\nan entourage of uh Goering and Goebbels and Hess and Himmler and Stryker and\ntake their seats in this box with Hitler in the middle, slightly forward of the rest of\nthe group, and Goering with his uh resplendent, outlandish uniforms uh wildly\ndecorative and Goebbels the rat like face and the rest uh Hess with a very dark\nbeard that he had. Uh they, they sat there. Uh and uh Hitler particularly was\nextremely nervous when German athletes ran. He\u2019d sit in his seat and rub his\nthighs and, and, and move back and forth as I\u2019m doing now, and uh he was\nobviously very much involved in the race. And he was, I thought he was nervous\nfor his own athletes. When other athletes competed, he just sat there uh quietly\nand observed. Uh he was thrilled, overjoyed, smiled when uh German athletes\nwent to the winning podium. When the black athletes went to the winning\npodium, Hitler was gone. As soon as the black athlete won his gold medal and\nwas going to the podium to receive it, the box would empty out, Hitler\u2019s box\nwould empty out. They\u2019d all be gone and they would not pay homage to the great\nblack athletes who were there. They stayed for the white athletes. But they left\nfor the black athletes.\n(adjustments to Marty\u2019s appearance)",
        "A: The event I was supposed to run, the 400 meter relay, was uh one of the last\nevents in the track and field program. It came, the trials came on the penultimate\nday and the final day of the games for track and field was the final of the 400\nmeter run. So uh [had plenty of time and so did the other athletes, except fellows\n15\n16\nlike uh Jesse Owens and uh one or two others who competed in several events, uh\nI had plenty of time to uh go into Berlin during the morning hours usually or late\nin the afternoon after the afternoon events took place and I uh had my freedom\nthroughout Berlin. I could hitch a ride if I chose to, get aboard a, a bus or a\ntrolley, or whatever, because I was wearing a, an Olympic uniform and I had\nOlympic identification of all sorts on me, and uh it, it was, 1t was beautiful, it was\nlovely. Uh I walked along uh Unter der Linden uh I thought that Unter der\nLinden, later I went to Paris and walked along the Champs Elysee. I believed\nthen that uh the Camps Elysee was not as attractive as Unter der Linden in Berlin\nbut that was my own personal feeling about it. Uh the Olympic village was a, a\nbeautiful campus of bungalows and low lying houses which uh housed the uh\nvarious teams of the Olympic games. Uh and it was like a college campus. Uh\nslightly rolling hills, low hills and uh dotted with uh these bungalows and\ndifferent buildings there. There was a practice track, there was a swimming area,\nuh an indoor natautorium, and uh we worked out at the practice track. The single\nmost important thing I got from the games was the fact that the other athletes of\nthe world were just like me. And I was just like they. Uh I worked out with\nHungarian athletes and uh, uh Romanian athletes and British athletes, French,\nJapanese athletes. We had many things in common. The things involving our\nsports uh and uh I\u2019d jog alongside of the different athletes. I walked alongside of\nthem of the dining room and rooms but we were with each other and we enjoyed\neach other\u2019s presence even though we couldn\u2019t communicate very well with most\nof the teams of the world because I didn\u2019t speak their language and they didn\u2019t\nspeak mine. Talked to the English, of course, and talked to those who spoke\nEnglish. Uh there was one Finn, a great Finnish athlete named Gunnar Harkert.\nUh Gunnar was uh the 5,000 meter champion. A young man in his early twenties\nwho was a beautiful blond, blue \u2014 eyed, apple cheeked young man, and a great,\ngreat runner. He won the gold medal. And he spoke good English. And we spent\na great deal of time with Gunnar because he liked being with the American\nathletes. He liked speaking English and we liked Gunnar. And to my shock and\nhorror, he was killed in the Russian \u2014 Finnish war just a few years after the\nOlympic games. But knowing him and knowing the other athletes, even just\nbeing with them for this limited amount of time, made me feel like one of them.\nAnd I think they felt like one of us. It was a wonderful education for all of us and\nme particularly.",
        "A: The German athletes usually stayed to themselves. The German athletes worked\nout together. Worked out by themselves. Uh they weren\u2019t as free, as loose, as\neasy as athletes from other countries of the world.\n(end Tape 2 of 4)\n(Tape 3 of 4)\n16\n17",

And uh, uh that was the first anti and\nonly anti \u2014 Semitism that I experienced. And I experienced it from American\ncoaches and not from Germans. There was no overt sign of any anti \u2014 Semitic\nfeeling or activity at all that I saw in Berlin or wherever I went in Germany.",
        "A: One of the ways of getting from the Olympic village to the Olympic stadium\nwhich was about eight miles distant from the Olympic village was to hitch a ride.\nAnd uh Herman Goldberg, my buddy and I, hitched a ride in what amounts to a\nGerman Army jeep. And it was driven by a German sergeant who looked like a\nNazi sergeant and he sat alongside of his passenger who was a, a very handsome\nLieutenant in the German army, blond, blue \u2014 eyed, most attractive looking man.\nAnd as we got into the jeep, hitching the ride, they asked for our autographs. And\nwe said we\u2019ll give it to you when we get off the jeep. Which we did. Uh we took\nthese uh eight miles at a what we thought was a reckless speed to begin with. We\ncould see the speedometer going up to uh 70, 80, 90, 100. 100 kilometers we\nfinally realized and not a 100 miles an hour, almost uh only half the speed. At\nany rate we get to uh the Olympic stadium and uh they, they give us some paper\nto sign our names and we scrawled our names, Herman Goldberg, Marty\nGlickman and left almost immediately. Uh we didn\u2019t want them to have them ask\nquestions about our names, Goldberg, Glickman, were we Jewish, or do we have\nGerman Jewish background or whatever. We were aware of the fact that we were\nwith this German Lieutenant uh and this German sergeant who looked every inch\nthe typical Nazi Army officer and under officer.",
        "A: We were aware of the fact that uh there was anti \u2014 Semitism in Germany. We\nwere aware of the fact that these were obviously German soldiers, perhaps Nazis,\nbut we thought all Germans uh all soldiers certainly uh were sympathetic to the\nNazis. And uh we just didn\u2019t know what Nazism was. Remember. This is from\nthe prospective of two years before Kristallnacht. Uh the Holocaust was not only\nnot a thought, it didn\u2019t exist in our imagination, 1n our dreams uh we, we didn\u2019t\nhave nightmares about the Holocaust. It was a word that I didn\u2019t even know in\n17\n18\n1936. Uh certainly had we uh any inkling of what was going to happen, we\nwouldn\u2019t have been in Germany in the first place. But uh the uh, uh the feeling\nabout anti \u2014 Semitism for me and probably for Herman and the two other Jews\nwho uh whom I knew uh on, on the team. There was a, a fine basketball player\nnamed Sam Bolter who was on the team and Herman and I and uh, uh there was\nanother Jewish athlete uh, uh who. The Jewish athletes I knew on the team uh\nwere Herman Goldberg, who was my buddy much of the time, and Sam Stoller\nwho was team mate on the 400 meter relay, and Sam Bolter was a, a wonderful\nbasketball player, a guard on the basketball team and uh the four of us were the\nonly Jews I was aware of. I understand now there were three other Jews who\nwere on the uh American Olympic team, but I didn\u2019t know them then. I didn\u2019t\nknow they were Jewish. But the, the four of them I knew, the four of us were the\nJews whom I knew. And we certainly were not aware of what was to come. I\nguess the whole world was not aware of, of what was to come.",
        "A: Berlin was like any other big city. If I would use a single word to describe Berlin\nduring that period of time. The word would be carnival. There was an atmosphere\nof carnival about Berlin with the flags flying and the beautiful weather, almost\nevery day uh it was, it was golden. Fleecy white clouds occasionally overhead.\nLate in the day, on a couple of days, there was some rain at the stadium. But most\nof the time it was just lovely. The city was immaculate as I understand it still is\nand as I saw a couple of years when I was back there again. And uh the people\nwere well dressed and seemingly well fed. Uh the beer flowed and uh it was a\ncarnival atmosphere.",
        "A: I knew John Woodruff uh slightly from the various track meets in which we\ncompeted at the same time. He ran the half mile. I was the sprinter running a 100\nmeters and sometimes 200 meters. And John and I were among the younger\nmembers of the team. Uh John was a, a uh a wonder athlete. He was taller than\nvirtually anyone else on the, on the squad except for some basketball players, six\nfeet four, a quiet, reserved, and a magnificent runner. He had the longest stride,\nrunning stride, in the world at that time. And he ran a marvelous race to win the\ngold medal at 800 meters. He was far better than the rest of the field as you\nprobably know and have seen, he virtually came to a halt at the half \u2014 way mark\nof the race, at the end of the first quarter, let the rest of the field go by because he\nwas pocketed in. He couldn\u2019t get to the outside. He couldn\u2019t make a move\nbecause there were runners in front of him and along side of him, so he let the\nfield go by him, ran around the entire field and then came on to win handily down\nthe stretch and down the backstretch first, around the far turn and around the\nstretch, and uh, a quiet, self \u2014 effacing, and a uh just a wonderful athlete.\n18\n19",
        "A: The 400 meter relay was selected beforehand and the four of us in order, Sam\nStoller would start, he had the best start of the group of us. I was to run the\nsecond leg down the back stretch straightway. Floyd Draper run the third leg.\nAnd Frank Wycoff run the anchor leg. He was the great veteran. This was his\nthird Olympic team that he was on. And we practiced passing the baton and\npassing the baton is terribly important in the 400 meter relay because the race is\nshort and you to make a, a, a good pass, the best possible pass. And we practiced\nthis every day. In that order. So that we knew each other and we knew the\ndistance we had to start running and things like that. The morning of the day we\nwere supposed to run in the trial heats, we were called into a meeting, the seven\nsprinters were, along with Gene Cromwell, the assistant head track coach, and\nLawrence Robertson, the head track coach. And Robertson announced to the\nseven of us that he\u2019s heard very strong rumors that the Germans were saving their\nbest sprinters, hiding them, to upset the American team in the 400 meter relay.\nAnd consequently, Sam and I were to be replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph\nMetcalfe. Now there\u2019s no question that Jesse and Ralph were faster at 100 meters\nthan Sam and I. They\u2019d beaten us fairly regularly. And we were shocked. Uh\nSam was completely stunned. He didn\u2019t say a word in the meeting. I\u2019m a brash\n18 year old kid and I said coach, you can\u2019t hide world class sprinters. In order to\nbe a world class sprinter you must run in world class competition. And we don\u2019t\nknow of any Germans outside of Erik Borkmaier who finished fifth in the 100\nmeter final beaten by Frank Wycoff, the, as well as Jesse Owens and Ralph\nMetcalfe. He was the best German sprinter. Later I beat Borkamier in another\npost Olympic track meet, but we all knew we could beat Borkmaier, and you\ndon\u2019t hide world class sprinters. I said coach there can\u2019t be any German world\nclass sprinters. He says well we\u2019re going to take no chances, said Dean\nCromwell. And Jesse and Ralph are going to take Sam pla, Sam\u2019s place and your\nplace. At which point Jesse spoke up and said coach I\u2019ve won my three gold\nmedals, the 100, the 200, and the long jump. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve had it. Let Marty\nand Sam run. They deserve it, said Jesse. And Cromwell pointed his finger at\nhim and said you\u2019ll do as you\u2019re told. And in those days black athletes did as they\nwere told. And Jesse was quiet after that. But he volunteered not to run, not to\nwin his fourth gold medal so that Sam and I, the only two Jews on the track team,\ncould run and win or try to win. The only way we could have lost that race is had\nwe dropped the baton. Frank Wycoff later said that uh we probably would have\nrun just as fast because our baton passing would have been superior because we\nhad practiced. I spoke up, I said something else, I said coach no matter who runs\nwe\u2019re going to win this race by fifteen yards. We won by fifteen yards. When\nyou see the finish of the race, all you see is Frank Wycoff crossing the finish line.\nYou don\u2019t even see the next, second place finisher. He\u2019s out of the picture. He\u2019s\nthat far back. Fifteen yards behind. The Germans didn\u2019t finish second or third.\nThey finished fourth. They were placed third because the Dutch team ran out of\n19\n20\ntheir lane and so they were disqualified. But they finished third in the race some\nfifteen, sixteen yards back. So the story given us was an out and out lie by\nRobertson and by Dean Cromwell. I believe now that with Hitler\u2019s humiliation\nby having the black athletes stand on the winning podium the many times that\nthey did in the 100, the 200, the 400, the 800, the long jump, the high jump. They\nwere dominating the games. That it would have been further humiliation for\nHitler to have Jews stand on the winning podium. And as I said the only way we\nwould not stand on the winning podium had we dropped the baton. We would\nhave won the race by, by fifteen yards or more. So we didn\u2019t get to run.",
        "A: As I was told that Sam and I would not run | thought that track politics was taking\nplace, that uh Dean Cromwell, the assistant head track coach, wanted to make\nsure that both his boys, Floyd Draper and Frank Wycoff were on the team. And\nso he was making sure they were going to be on because in a trial race in the\nOlympic village three days before this race took place, the 400 meter race took\nplace, we ran a trial heat. And Stoller won the race, beating me by about oh a\nshoulder, a foot, and we both beat Floyd Draper by a yard. So here is Draper\nrunning the relay, whom we had both beaten just a couple of days before and Sam\nand I were not running. In the entire history of the modern Olympic games, now\ngoing into it\u2019s 100\" year, no fit American track and field performer has ever not\ncompeted in the Olympic games except for Sam Stoller and me, the only two\nJews on the 1936 team. Every other American track and field athlete has\ncompeted, so long as he was physically fit, didn\u2019t have a pulled muscle or didn\u2019t\nhave an appendectomy as one of our track athletes did have and couldn\u2019t run, a\nfellow named Hal Smallwood. But with that exception uh every athlete has run.",
        "A: In August of \u201936 I thought originally, I did mention in that meeting I did say that\ncoach you know we\u2019re the only two Jews on the track team, Sam and I. There\u2019s\nbound to be a furor about this back home. We\u2019ll worry about that later said Dean\nCromwell. Later, of course, Dean Cromwell also was a member of the American\nFirst committee, that group in America which was sympathetic to the Nazi cause.\nSo my thoughts were that Cromwell was seeing to it that his boys were on that\n400 meter relay. And uh about that threat of other German sprinters that was just\nuh had a whole cloth. It, it, 1t was a complete lie.\n20\n21",
        "A: I was fortunate. I was young. I was 18. Sam was three years older than I. He\nwas a senior at Michigan. And uh in those days when you finished your college\ncareer that was usually it. And Sam was at the end of his college career. He\nvowed never to run again because of this terrible disappointment. He did run and\nwon a collegiate championship the following year. He did change his mind a bit\nlater on. I as an 18 year old, just out of my freshman year, I vowed that come\n1940, I\u2019d win it all. I'd win the 100, the 200, I\u2019d uh run on the relay. I was going\nto be 22 in 1940 and I'd be at the height of my supposed uh athletic abilities in\nthose years. Of course 1940 never came. There was a war on. 1944 never came.\nBut I was frustrated and angered enough so that I could look ahead and get even\nfour years hence. Young enough to get even. In addition I was a football player\nuh at Syracuse and uh a month from the Olympic games I was going to be playing\nfootball at Syracuse University, my first varsity season then. And uh I had\nsomething to look forward to. I had something to dissipate my disappointment by\nhaving a, a football season too, looming for me.",
        "A: I was, I was, I was not if you use the word devastated, I was not devastated. I was\nangered. I was frustrated. And as I say I was young enough to think ahead.",
        "A: I was not devastated by not being on that 400 meter team. Terribly angry.\nTerribly frustrated. But I was young enough to be able to look ahead to 1940 and\nperhaps win it all, to win the 100 and the 200. I might be at my athletic peak\nwhen I was 22 years of age. Here I was only 18. So I had something to shoot for,\nsomething to look forward to, come 1940 and the next Olympic games. I also had\na football season I was looking forward to because I was going into my\nsophomore year, first year of varsity football, and that occupied my thoughts and\ntime and energies immediately after the games.",
        "A: No one else said anything in that room during the course of this meeting. Ralph\nMetcalfe didn\u2019t say a word. I think he wanted to run on the relay and this\njustification, why, why not, if he could run on the relay. And the only other\nathlete involved who didn\u2019t run was Mac Robinson. Mac, Jackie Robinson\u2019s\nolder brother, already had won the silver medal at 200 meters and he was not as\ngood at 100 meters as he was at 200 meters. In addition he was not involved in\nthe practice of passing the baton. That 400 meter relay was set as I say with uh\nleading off was Sam Stoller with that great start. I was running the second leg,\nFloyd Draper the third leg, Frank Wycoff the anchor leg and we practiced passing\nthe baton 1n that order for two weeks in the Olympic village.\n21\n22",
        "A: They were supportive. The other athletes were supportive afterwards. Uh patted\nme on the back. Say, saying Marty you should have run. Uh not en masse.\nEverybody was involved with his own uh achievements or striding. Uh the, the\nfeeling was that tough luck. But for me, as I say, it was the feeling of I'll show\nthem. I'll get even. I was there. I sat in the stands and watched the race. The\nqualifying heats proved that we were by far the best team among the other\ncountries of the world, the best 400 meter relay team. The following day I was\nwalking across the campus of the Olympic village and I heard my name called to\nme, and 50 yards away was Lawrence Robertson, the head track coach, uh with\nhis cane. He was an older man. Marty, Marty. And I jogged over to him. I just\nwant to tell you how sorry Iam. I made a terrible mistake. And uh he said he\nwas sorry. Dean Cromwell didn\u2019t say a word. Never spoke to me again. Uh I\ndon\u2019t know what he said or thought to anyone else, but he never said a word to\nme. Wycoff later said we would have run just as fast had you and Sam run\nbecause our superior baton passing because of practice could have enabled us to\nrun and win.",
        "A: Watching the trial heat and watching the final the following day were uh strange,\nweird, all sorts of emotions flashed through my being. Uh frustration certainly.\nAnger certainly. I look out on the track and I see Metcalfe passing runners down\nthe backstretch. He ran the second leg. And that should be me out there. As they\nwarmed up, jogging up and down the track, I, that should be me. That, that\u2019s me\nout there. And you know frustrated at it uh feeling uh also feeling relief that I\nwasn\u2019t running in this race. I didn\u2019t have the pressure of receiving the baton,\nrunning with it and passing the baton. I wasn\u2019t fearful of dropping the baton.\nAnd all relay runners have that uncertainty, that fear of the possibility. I\u2019ve never\ndropped a baton in the many relay races I\u2019ve run, but I\u2019ve seen it dropped. So I it\nwas some feeling of relief, but mostly it was anger and frustration and the feeling\nthat should be me out there.",
        "A: My recollection is I sat with Herman Goldberg uh during the events for either the\ntrial race or the trial heats or for the finals. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t believe I sat\nwith Herman both those days. Very often we would sit together and sometimes\nwe would not. After all he had his own assignments to take care of. He was\npracticing and playing with the American baseball team. But I do believe that for\none of those races either the trial heat or in the final that Herman was alongside\nme.\n22\n23",
        "A: No. I uh I didn\u2019t say a word. Words can\u2019t convey how you feel. Not at the\nmoment anyhow. Uh words wouldn\u2019t have made me feel any better or less angry.\nI uh I just sat there and uh suffered or just felt. I felt all these emotions. And\nagain at the age of 18, the world 1s bright and glorious in front of you. I was a\ngood athlete. I knew that. And uh four years hence I was going to be out there\nagain.",
        "A: When the American team was on the podium, I was not necessarily proud for\nthem. I was pleased, of course, that they won, and I was particularly pleased that\nthey won by fifteen yards to prove the point that uh anyone, anyone of the\nAmerican uh sprinters could have won on the, run on the relay and won the event\nhandily. But we, I don\u2019t feel as though uh I was an American athlete, or that I\nwas a Jewish athlete. I was an athlete. I was a, a member of the Olympic team. I\nwas in the Olympic stadium. Uh I was part of this overall thing, which I believe\nhas done me so much good in all the years which follow, 60 years now, which\nhave followed those \u201936 games. Where I began to realize that I\u2019m just like the\nother athletes of the world, the other people of the world and they\u2019re just like me.\nWe\u2019re all alike. We\u2019re all brothers. And uh the whole point of the games, the\nwhole point of all athletic competition is to learn to respect each other, to like\neach other, to love each other, to get to really know each other. And I was part of\nthat. And I was also angry.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I was envious? I uh. The only feeling I have today, I\u2019m a\ngrandfather of 10, and I\u2019m the great \u2014 grandfather of 4. So I don\u2019t have the\ngrandchildren or the great \u2014 grandchildren I can show this gold medal to. That\u2019s\nthe only feeling of disappointment I now have, that I can\u2019t show my grandchildren\nthis gold Olympic medal. That\u2019s the only, the only feeling I have now. I think\nit\u2019s wonderful that I was on the team. I think it\u2019s great that I made this trip. Uh it\nexposed me to, to marvelous things. And also exposed me to the hurt of anti \u2014\nSemitism.",
        "A: The Olympic stadium itself is a very impressive place. Uh it\u2019s a, it was\nparticularly impressive then when filled with a hundred and twenty thousand\npeople and it was virtually brand new. And I'll never forget walking into the\nstadium, marching in along with my American teammates in the opening day\nparade. And I use the word march loosely here because American athletes don\u2019t\n23\n24\nmarch very well. We kind of sclumped in you know in line but ah walking in the\nmanner of loose \u2014 limbed, uh easy going American athletes. And I remember\nlooking up at Adolph Hitler as we walked by, marched by, and he was glaring\ndown at us we thought. And the comment heard in the ranks and I said it also, he\nlooks just like Charlie Chaplin. And that\u2019s just the way we felt about him. He\nwas almost a comic figure with his drab, khaki uniform he wore, khaki shirt and\nkhaki pants. No decorations on it. That funny little moustache and the cowlick\nover his forehead and uh he was a comic figure. Uh I thought of him and I think\nmany of us thought of him as like a typical South American dictator of those\nyears who was here today and gone tomorrow. After all he\u2019d just been in power\nsome two and a half years and who knew how long he was going to last or how\nmuch power he would ultimately have. But uh he was comic to us. Uh along with\nthe rest of his entourage and uh certainly they were funny looking in terms of uh\nGoering and his uniform and Goebbels with his rat like face and some of the\ndiplomats in their with their long frock coats and ascots and uh, uh some of the\nArmy uniforms and Naval uniforms around them. So uh it was uh it was uh an\nexperience I\u2019m pleased to have be a part of. And of I\u2019m still angry at not having\nthat medal to show the kids.",
        "A: We felt no feeling of awe. We were cocky, young, uh well \u2014 trained, uh good\nathletes. And uh nothing awesome about going into a huge stadium. We\u2019d been\nin huge stadiums before. We\u2019d competed in these huge stadiums. Uh the ha the\nthing I remember, one of the things I remember most, was as part of the opening\nceremonies these thousands of pigeons which had been kept in cages\n(end of Tape 3 of 4)\n(Tape 4 of 4)",
        "A: The opening day parade. One of the things I, I best remember about the uh, uh\nthe opening day ceremonies of the Olympic games was standing in the infield of\nthe stadium while the Olympic oath was being taken and uh the various music\nwas being played, was the release of these thousands of pigeons which had been\ncooped up and they were all, alongside the inner perimeter of the stadium. And\nnow after being in these cages for I don\u2019t know how many hours or how many\ndays, they were suddenly released and they flew up over the stadium and circled\nround and round. And we began to hear on our straw hats that was part of our\nuniform, the straw hats, splat, splat, splat from these pigeons. And we were afraid\n24\n25\nto look up of course or else we\u2019d get it in the eye. But there we were cringing in\nthe stadium and the splat, splat of all these thousands of pigeons going round and\nround and finally they went far enough up to get out of the stadium and flew\naway. It was a very funny moment.",
        "A: No. We, we left before the end of the Olympic games. Avery Brundage I\nbelieve, the head of the American Olympic committee, was the basic reason, I\nbelieve that Sam and I didn\u2019t get to run in the Olympic games. Adolph Hitler was\nbeing humiliated by the great success of the black American athletes and I think\nthat he wanted to see to it that Jewish athletes didn\u2019t stand on the winning podium\nand further humiliate Adolph Hitler, embarrass him with that nonsense about\nAryan supremacy because here were the great black athletes who couldn\u2019t be\nkept off the winning podium because of their number and their great reputations.\nAnd they were marvelous. But here were two rather obscure Jewish American\nathletes who could be kept from the winning podium and I believe that Avery\nBrundage who was close to Hitler, who had examined Germany for anti \u2014\nSemitism the year before to see whether or not the games should be held in\nGermany. Here was Avery Brundage keeping Jews from the winning podium so\nas not to further embarrass Adolph Hitler.",
        "A: I was, I was more aware of it later than Iam. I was more aware of it later uh than\nI was at that time. But uh Brundage was a most important figure. Head of the\nAmerican Olympic Committee and later on the president of the International\nOlympic Committee.\nA; My experience in the Olympic games and the fact that I didn\u2019t run didn\u2019t sour me\non the games at all. It soured me on Avery Brundage. It certainly soured me on\nanti \u2014 Semitism and the Nazis as well. But as far as the Olympic games then and\nfor many years thereafter, I was an Olympic uh booster. I didn\u2019t want us to\nboycott the games in the Soviet Union in 1980. I didn\u2019t want the Soviet Union to\nboycott the American games in 1984. But I\u2019m not very happy with the current\nOlympic games. The Olympic games of \u201996 and the enormous commercialization\nof the Olympic games. I think that the Olympic ideal, the Olympic creed, doesn\u2019t\nexist any longer. It\u2019s all strictly professionalism. I think that the current Olympic\ngames in Atlanta is a huge project for profit and that\u2019s about all.\n25\n26",
        "A: I became aware of what took place in Germany in 1938, Kristallnacht was the\nbeginning of the knowledge generally of what took place in Germany. In 1936\neven the German Jews stayed in Germany until 1938. Many left but far more\nremained in Germany until \u201938 and then they started to try to get out of Germany.\nOf course, I didn\u2019t know about uh the Holocaust until after the war was over. I\nwas a, a marine in the, in the central Pacific during World War II on the Marshall\nIslands and uh the European campaign was that far distant from our involvement\nin the Pacific. So it wasn\u2019t until I came back in December of \u201945 that I began to\nrealize, began to hear and know of what took place in the years, the closing years\nof World War IT",
        "A: I\u2019ve been asked many times whether I have second guesses about going to\nGermany in 1936 and uh I persist in saying that I\u2019m delighted I went. Uh I\u2019m\nglad that the games took place in 1936. UhI saw no harm from the games\nthemselves. I saw a great deal of good from the games. For me as an individual\nlearning about the other athletes of the world and for the great success of the non\n\u2014 Aryan athletes, the marvelous black athletes who had this great success in\nhelping smash that myth of Aryan supremacy. I think that was a very positive\nthing.",
        "A: Something took place in 1937 which uh was a direct result of what happened to\nme in 1936. I was playing football at Syracuse and uh for this particular I was the\nstar of the team. We had upset Cornell the week before and uh I had uh scored\nboth touchdowns for Syracuse against Cornell 14 to 6 was the final score. And\nI\u2019d had the best day I ever had on the football field. Lot of publicity about me\nthen. And uh I\u2019m embarrassed almost to say it, I was the star of the team going to\na game against Maryland, in Baltimore. And as we\u2019re getting dressed for the\ngame sitting alongside of me is the other starting half \u2014 back. His name is\nWilmoth Sedette Sing. He is a black man but his mother married a Hindu\nphysician and Will and I played side by side. We\u2019re in the same class. We took\nclasses together. He helped me through my physics class, my physics course.\nLater he was a member of the uh the black airmen, the black squadron who helped\nform uh the one squadron of black aviators in World War II. But this was in\nBaltimore, Maryland. We\u2019re being dressed for the game. He\u2019s sitting right\nalongside of me, right here. He slept alongside of me where we slept in the, in the\ngym during the football season. And the coach came in, Ossie Solom along with\nthe Director of Athletics Lou Andreas and he said uh fellows I\u2019ve got some news.\nUh the local press and Maryland had just found out that Will is not a Hindu but\n26\n27\nhe\u2019s a black man and consequently he won\u2019t play today. And I said to myself\nsitting there, stand up Marty and say if Will doesn\u2019t play, I don\u2019t play. And I\u2019m\none of the leaders of the team. I\u2019m the star of the team, this week anyhow\nbecause of that previous game the week before. And I say stand up and say that.\nAnd I think to myself, but if I do stand up and say that and the game is cancelled\nand there\u2019s ruckus or this furor develops as a result of the game being cancelled, if\nthat happens they\u2019II point to me and there\u2019s that Jewish guy getting in trouble\nagain. Because just the year before I\u2019d been involved in the anti \u2014 Semitic\nincident in Berlin. And so I didn\u2019t say a word. And Will didn\u2019t play. And I\nplayed. And we got beat. We got beat twelve nothing. A couple of years after\nthat, Will was killed in World War II and to this day I still feel very strongly\nabout it. That I should have gotten up and said and he was good enough to die for\nour country, but he wasn\u2019t good enough to play against Maryland.",
        "A: After the Olympic games uh many of the track and field athletes toured Europe\nand several different track meets. I ran on a 400 yard relay team in London at\nWhite City Stadium. I ran with Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe and Frank\nWycoff and me. We set a world\u2019s record at 400 yards. That world\u2019s record still\nstands. Mostly because they rarely run that race and they don\u2019t run yards any\nmore they now run meters. So um the four of us are still world record holders at\nthe 400 yard relay. I also ran in Paris after the uh Olympic games. Ran against\nFrank Wycoff and uh I won the race against Wycoff that day and uh a\ncombination of uh Japanese and French athletes as well as American athletes\ncompeted that day. And I won that race. Also ran in Scotland. Iran ina\nhandicap race and uh didn\u2019t win that handicap race. Uh I was set back so far from\nthe rest of the field because these were local athletes in uh in Edinburgh, Scotland,\nthat uh I was literally off the track, uh that far back, and had to run up a slight\nincline to get to the track and then start running. I finished out of the money.",
        "A: Well, I, I was on the team.",
        "A: Do you want me to say that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t want to brag. I mean it\u2019s been said. I, I was on the team. That\u2019s the\nimportant thing. I made the team and the obviously I was good enough to be uh\nto run in the Olympic games because I was on the American team. And uh\n27\n28\nAmerican athletes compete in the Olympic games when they make the Olympic\nteam, except for these two Jewish athletes who didn\u2019t because of Avery Brundage\nand Adolph Hitler and anti \u2014 Semitism. And I\u2019d like to add one other thing that\nsometimes people feel sorry for me and what happened to me in, in Germany, in\nBerlin, in 1936. What happened to me was as nothing, absolutely zero to that\nwhich took place later on. There\u2019s just no feeling of uh comparison and no\nfeeling of, of hurt. Uh there\u2019s still feeling of anger, but uh I was there and uh that\nmattered. What took place was much, much more important afterwards.",
        "A: The football game in Maryland.",
        "A: I think my experience in 1936, my experience in athletics generally specifically in\n\u00b036 made me aware of the fact that I am not different than other people of the\nworld. I am not different than blacks or browns or yellows or whites. That we\u2019re\nall one. And uh I think I\u2019ve learned not to be tolerant necessarily because\ntolerance I think implies sort of a uh a superiority over individuals. But I\u2019ve\nlearned to appreciate other people I think because of my experience in \u201936 and my\nexperience in athletics.",
        "A: I think the experience of all athletes makes me more conscious of other people, of\nbias and prejudice against uh Black and Asiatics and Latins and Jews. I think that\nwe're people. I\u2019ve learned that through sports. I think that at every level of sports\nfrom my days as a schoolboy to my days as a broadcaster has enabled me to\nthoroughly enjoy and appreciate the abilities of the great athletes. I was able to\nlook at and broadcast about. The Jim Browns. The wonderful Black athletes, the\nwonderful Japanese athletes, uh the great athletes of the world uh regardless of\nwhat their background was.",
        "A: Sports is the great equalizer. The fellow who gets to the finish line first 1s the\nwinner. Uh brings to mind another thought that uh the Olympic games should be\nuh a competition amongst individuals and not amongst teams because teams\nrepresent nationalities. Individuals represent themselves. Even though we wore\nthe uniform of the United States Olympic Team, we ran as individuals. For the\nrelay, the relay is a unique track and field event, four men running together but\n28\n29\nrunning individually together. Uh basketball and hockey, great sports, they\u2019re\nwonderful sports, and football too, of course, but the, the point of sports is the\nexultation the individual athlete feels when he does it by himself. And that\u2019s the\npoint of the Olympic games. Team sports are marvelous. They teach all the\nthings that ought to be taught in terms of team work and cooperation and practice\nand respect for the other team and all that. But uh, the Olympic games are for the\nindividual and for the extolling of the individual abilities, the excellence of the\nindividual rather than the nation or the team.",
