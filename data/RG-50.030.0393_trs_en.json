        "Q: This is September 21*, 1998, we are in Arlington, Virginia, and this is an interview for\nthe Holocaust Museum with Tadeusz Marchaj. And if I could just get you to begin.\nIntroduce yourself, say your full name.",
        "A: Okay. This is -- my name is Tadeusz Marcha}. Yestem -- I -- I cannot talk in Polish. \u2019'm a\nson of the Stanislavo Marchaj Mulanietch and Neho Marcha}. [speaks Polish]",
        "Q: I think you just spoke in Polish then.",
        "A: Oh, Jesus. Sorry. Yes, I -- yes. You see, when I\u2019m coming to my memory, I don\u2019t know,\nsomewhere in my mind 1s everything automatically switched to the Polish language. So\nnow, fine. Marchaj ema in America, and talk English. So, I am the -- a boy born in\nPoland as the first generation of the Polish people after reaching the independence as a\ncountry in the 1918, and ri -- and yet Poland was again a state in 1918. And therefore,\nbeing born in \u201924, I am one of the first generation of the Polish people. We -- this what\nhappened just after the war, and I started to think independently, was that I started to\nunderstand the great effort of my parents, and parents of my friends, that they fought to\nreach this independence. And therefore I found a very -- important for me to learn about\nthe history and fight for the independence. I understand the very big losses in Polish\npopulation to reach this goal, to be again independent country. Therefore, I understand\nvery well the need to be educated patriotic, as a patriot. And therefore, a -- from very\nbeginning what I remember in my youth, it was always all events, all occurrences, all\nanniversary, very enused, very, very touchy. All -- say for example like anniversary of\nthe Polish constitution, the third May, this was the constitution which was written based\non the American Constitution, and written by the Tadeusz Kashoushka, who was the\nfriend of Thomas Jefferson. And this third May, it was a very big day in Polish history,\nevery more -- every day, every year. There -- and then we --",
        "Q: What would people do, why -- how could you tell it was a big day?",
        "A: Well, it means that especially -- may I make a -- a little bit comi -- to come back to the\nhistory of Poland, the society of Poland, to the people of Poland. You have to realize,\neverybody who want to understand Polish people, and their behavior, you have to assume\n-- not assume, have to recognize the fact that Poland didn\u2019t exist for 125 years. This\nmeans six generations of the Polish people were not Polish. You have to realize this fact\nthat people didn\u2019t know, after six generations, what does it mean Poland, especially that\nthe -- the recognizing country, recognizing the nation occurred very late in human history\nin Europe. This is the so-called, the spring of the nation, and in moment -- you have to\nrealize the fact that there was no German, there was no Austrian, there was not Polish\npeople. They were the principalities, somebody was Bavarian, or was the Silesian, was\nthe Galician, was the Pomac. People didn\u2019t know yet what does it mean Poland, they\ndidn\u2019t know yet what are Germany, they didn\u2019t know what are Austria, and so on. History\nwas the history of the big family, big kings, but not a big country. Big Germany.\nGermany\u2019s a very modern -- modern -- modern creature, I can say. And therefore, when\nPoland reached the independent, people within the territory, within the border of the so-\ncalled thow Poland, they didn\u2019t know who are they. There was a -- here in the United\nStates, you can find a group of Polish people gathering somewhere in the center of park,\nspeaking the same language, and asking each other, who are you? They are speaking\nSilesian. No, I am Mazurin, I am Galician, and I am speaking Galicia. I am speaking\nSilesian, I am speaking Mazurin. They even didn\u2019t recognize they are speaking Polish,\nbecause Poland was a -- a totally new element of [indecipherable]. So therefore, you\nrealize this sounded -- it was extremely important for the people who reach, and were at\nthe government, at the steering of the new country, like Pilsudski, Marshal Pilsudski who\nstarted to fight for -- for the freedom of Poland. They introduce a very strong, very -- no,\nthey introduce a histor -- education of histor. And at the time, we and my friends in\ndifferent country -- different part of the Poland, they started to be the conscious who --\nwhat does 1t mean Poland. What does it mean to be a Polish? Of course, in this\ndevelopment, there was a very big part of the Catholic church. This -- the church was the\n-- the first unit of the government, yes, to create a -- the -- to create am -- hard, that\u2019s the\n[indecipherable] you see the -- if -- if I would like -- sorry -- if I would like to talk in\nperfe -- about my profession, I -- I had no problem to find the words, and when I am\ntalking on this subject, I have a problem. So they started to create the conscious -- can I\nsay conscious?",
        "Q: Consciousness.",
        "A: Consciousness of the Polish people, what does it mean Poland, yes. And very big\nemphasize in this consciousness was a -- that we are Catholic. And really, really there\nwas a -- 90 percent, yes, of suppold Polish people were Catholic. And therefore, in -- in\nthe -- in the school, ground school, and then in gimnasium, which is a correspondent to\nthe high school, there -- we started to -- not only to be Polish, but to cultivate Polish. And\none of these big movement in cultivation of the Polish -- Poland, was scouting.\nOrganization hartseffo, scouting.",
        "Q: Mr. Marchaj, what I\u2019m going to do, is because I feel us moving forward, you\u2019re almost a\nteenager now, I would like to go back a little bit and get even to when you were a little\nboy, and then we will revisit this idea of how you were surrounded by this new\nconsciousness.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, if you could tell us -- tell us about your mother and father. What -- what were they\nlike, and what was it like to be a little boy in their home.",
        "A: Yes. Okay, that\u2019s a very, very basic question, because sometimes in America, I\u2019m trying\nto tell the people that I am a son of the slave. That is a big surprise. And if you would try\nto find a definition who 1s slave? The person which is taken away from home, from\ncountry, by some big power, to another country, to be totally without freedom, and to\nhave and obey the rules of the -- this who took him to another country. That\u2019s -- I\nunderstand the definition of the slave from Africa to America is exactly the same. They\nwere taken away to another country, without willpower, without anything, just to go and\nobey the law of the lord, yes? So this is my father. My father was from family where it\nwas seven children, and -- four son and three daughters, and this town, land where he was\nborn, Vol-Volbrum, in Poland, had to supply to the tsar of Russia, a soldier, forever.\nThey were taken away from this small town to, in case of my father to Petersburg to be a\nsoldier. Now why this happened, you know, there was seven, four brothers, and there was\na gathering of the family, because Volbrum, town Volbrum had to supply X number of\npeople -- soldiers to the tsar. So when there was a tragic meeting in the family, they say,\nnow Miko, Neho, you will go. And he was taken away to Petersburg, and this was\nsomewhere in the -- in 1905, something like that, maybe 10, ist -- I don\u2019t remember the\ndate. And so this is my father. My mother was a daughter of the family --",
        "Q: Can you just --",
        "A: With close?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Okay, I am moving [indecipherable]. So, therefore my f -- so I mentioned who was my\nfather, and of course, even if I would like to ask at that -- at that time, who you were,\nprobably his answer would be, I am shlos -- Silesian. In spite of fact that he was talking\nPolish. He had no knowledge about the Poland [indecipherable]. Then he went to the\nPetersburg, and he was a -- I can tell you, very intelligent boy. He didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t was\n-- he wasn\u2019t there a -- a -- a simple soldier. He was intelligent, so he made advance in his\nranking. Of course, that he will never reach the officer\u2019s ranking, but he reached the\nstarshina, which means like a sergeant, starshina. Now he was taught not to be only a\nsoldier, or to give the orders to another soldier, he started to be a professional soldier in\nthe armament. He was a perfectly taught how to be with the armament. He was a\nperfectly taught how to deal with the armament, carbine, guns, and everything, how to\nrepair it, how to build it and so on. So he was out of the service of the soldier, he was in -\n- somewhere in the kazerna, yes, in the camp, or -- camp somebody [indecipherable]\nexactly it was Veeberg, which is now in [indecipherable]. And he, when the war came,\nwar -- the first World War, he was not a soldier to be killed.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes. Because he knew well all the soldiers, and the first battle that my father faced, it was\nTanenberk battle, very famous battle, and he found the only -- he saw the battle after the\nbattle, and he survived this bacca -- the only because he was not in the first line. He was\ndelivering the armament to this killing. And he survive, and then he participate in the\nwar, later on the -- on the front, and the Austria, Italy, Austria, some went there. And then\nwas captured as a -- as a -- you know -- captured by the -- by the [indecipherable] army,\nso was the --",
        "Q: By the which army?",
        "A: By Austria.",
        "Q: Austria, mm-hm.",
        "A: And he at that moment, he said that, I am with the Russian, yes? And Austria, they found\nhim very useful. Oh, we get a professional, yes. Let\u2019s use him in the manufacturing in\nVienna, yes? So he from the statusk of what is this, gefarn genay, now what is this\nAmerican English? Prisoner of war, yes? He was no prisoner of war, he was a worker in\nalready a certain industry of Austria. At that time, he met -- he send the letter and contact\nthe father, and father later came, and he made arrangement, better arrangement for him to\nbe almost like a worker, free worker. And awadi -- I have even the -- the picture of this\nvisit that, in my grandfather visit my father. And he was -- and this was the end of the\nwar, I mean, as you know. This is the end of the war, and Pilsudski, Leggionipulski, they\nstarted to fight. 120 soldiers get out from Krakow to fight for Poland. Do you realize this\nfact? 100 very well educated soldiers, under the [indecipherable] of Pilsudski started to\nfight with the three power European power, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Fortunately for\nPoland, all these three powers fought each other, in different combinations. So it was\nquite -- no, not easy, but 120 soldiers started to bil -- to fight and build the Poland. And in\n1918, when the treaty in Versailles, Mr. Woodrow Wilson, yes, was involved to promise\nPoland independence, and Pilsudski was at the moment leader openly. They gave Poland\nchance to be a nation as Poland. So I -- do you know [indecipherable] my father, yes. My\nmother was not the same story, but she was a daughter of the restorator in Slominik1. Is a\ntown of -- very close to Krak\u00e9w. And they met each other, they start to love each other,\nand they were married, yes, I -- I don\u2019t know, probably 18 or twen -- no, 20 -- 18 - 18 -\n18 they were married. And at the moment, my father, being in some way involved -- he\nwas in connection to the -- this military movement in Poland, and he entered Polish\npolice. Police, yes? And he was the -- again, in the county Keldsa, 1s a part of Poland, he\nwas re-responsible for the armament of the police. He\u2019s a -- you realize this was the year\n18 - 19 - 20, and now you -- maybe you know that -- that in 1920, Poland was not yet\nfully Poland, because there was on the east a growing Communist, a Red army attack\nPoland in 1920, with the full power they invaded Poland just to take Poland into the --\ninto the Communist [speaks Polish] I -- I said in Poland, in Polish. And at the moment --\nyou realize this [indecipherable]. Poland, they have two years of independence, two years\nto build the consciousness what does it mean Poland. They have to fight with the Russian\npower. Not only Russian, the whole Socialist block. And they were very badly defeated.\nWith Germany and Russian Red army was totally destroyed, which is invading not only\nPoland, but invading very weak German. This is the very crucial moment in history of --\nof the youth. Yes, either you will study some -- some historical period, 1920, you will see\nhow weak it was at the moment, Europe, to be captured by Communists. There was a --\nGermany was -- after the war, was totally destroyed. So, doesn\u2019t matter. In 1920 my\nfather fought as a -- as a soldier, again -- Polish soldier against the Communist Red army.\nAfterwards [indecipherable] Red army was defeated very badly, and the moment even\nPolish army ended up to the Kiev, very far, far, deep into the Russia. But, doesn\u2019t matter.\nW-We can say that since \u201920, Poland was a really [indecipherable], yes. So realize in \u201920,\nin 1939, 19 years later, we were invaded by Germany, and saw the killing again. But in\nthis period of 18 years, you have mi -- imagination how much we built in Poland.\nIncredible, incredible. We --",
        "Q: Do you remember your -- tell us what you remember about your father talking about this,\nabout being a soldier, about fighting for Poland.",
        "A: He was very pacifistic, especially -- especially when we were espouting, yes, and we\nwere in some way paramilitary organization. So, a very good education, part of the Polish\nscouting, was the military decoration, to know everything about military, about the -- the\nsimple behavior even, but without using the weapon, yes? But basically again, how to use\nthe cartography, how to use the geography, how to use the knowledge of the medicine,\nand so on. This was a paramilitary organization with -- without -- no, with out the -- the\nleading us to the militaristic -- no, militaristic future. No, this was a -- do you know the\nfounder of this organization was in England, Badin Power [indecipherable]. Scouting was\na very broad movement in Europe. And my father was always, but don\u2019t think about to\nfight, because you are only -- you will be only the -- the target of -- to be killed. So he\nwas pacifistic at this moment.",
        "Q: I\u2019m not sure I understand. Is that something your father would say to you?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But he -- if there was some meeting in the home, yes, and they will usually, in the\nSunday, and we were very, very patriotic. And as you know, in every country there is\npolitical issues, yes? So, my father was -- was now oriented more to build the life, to\nbuild something good. And he said, \u201cDon\u2019t believe in everything what you are teaching\nyou in the school.\u201d And he said, \u201cThink independently what is going on.\u201d Yes, and he\nrealized this fact that Poland was so fresh, so unexperienced country, that he had a\nterrible problem. Minority, yes, Belarus, yes, and Cryena. Jewish people, some German,\nand so on. Even what I can tell you something about the -- how I -- how I lived with my\nfriend, the Jewish people, yes, because as I mentioned to you, my father, and my mother\ncame from the small town, especially later, I was very much more attached to the family\nof my mother, especially that my godfather was Jusef Meeta, was a soldier of the\nPilsudski army, a regular soldier. And he was the vouloust, a mayor of this small town.\nAnd he had a very -- my cousin, yes, were the same age, so during the vacation, either\nthey were in our home, or I was in their home. So this was like my -- the distance\nbetween my br -- I had it one brother and two sister. My brother was six years older. So\nat that year -- age, say 12, he was 18, there was no contact. So the contact was with my\ncousin, who was 12, too. And therefore I -- I was very close to the -- to the Titus\nKameeta, my cousin, and Barbara Kameeta. Titus, it was his name, Titus Kameeta. And\nlater he was a soldier of the -- too. And it doesn\u2019t matter, this is the case that I was in --\nattached, yes. In this town -- because I started to tell about the Jewish people, Slominik1,\nsay for example, it was a s --",
        "Q: Which town?",
        "A: Slominiki -- Slominiki --",
        "Q: Which is not the town that you grew up 1n?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But your --",
        "A: Hi -- I grew up in --",
        "Q: -- cousin\u2019s hometown.",
        "A: -- yes, cam -- I -- I grew up, because I meant -- I didn\u2019t mention this, that my father was\nresponsible for the police department, armament only, yes, in Kelsa, and was a -- like a\ncapital -- county town, county town. This was a -- a 200,000 in -- inhabitant, yes, big\ntown. And so therefore, he -- I -- Slominiki was 6,000, and there was the -- we knew\n3,000 Jewish people. Now, that\u2019s the very -- that you -- maybe you are interested in some\nway, that similar way, Jewish people, if you go now back into history, they didn\u2019t know\nPoland. He came maybe when it was the Kasimiros del grossa in the 15\" century, when\nhe invade -- in -- invited Jewish people into the very big kingdom at the time, was\nPoland, yes? And probably his idea was to move to the new territory, which was at the\ndomination of the king Kasimiros, but in very peaceful way. Kasimiros del gressa never\nfought the war, and the -- at the time, there was a -- the greatest part of Europe under his\ndomination. You know, after ya -- Besarabia -- you know -- you know Besarabia Ukraina\ninto Lithuania? This was due to the m -- marriage -- married his daughter Elsan, they\ndom -- started to dominate this big territory, but not Poland. This was a do -- domination,\nthen th -- this was the aga -- under the -- under the [indecipherable] it\u2019s hard to say. It was\na governor -- king, no, under the how do we -- I lost the word. Doesn\u2019t matter. The\n[indecipherable] king, Kasimiros del grossa had the influence into the Lithuania because\nhis daughter was married to the agawar, or something like that, yes? And therefore, he\nstarted to enter -- the properties was his idea to introduce a lot of Jewish people, who\nwere the merchant, who were the professional in very many activity, even to -- to make\ndresses, to -- to -- to make a business, to do something, yes? At the moment Polish\npeasant, they didn\u2019t know anything about it, yeah? So therefore, and I\u2019m saying, in\nSlominiki there was a 6,000 inh -- in -- in -- inhabitant, and there was a 3000 Jewish\npeople. Who are they, who were they, yes? Professionals. Business, bakery, and another\nactivity of the merchant, yes. And at the time, when I was in the vacation, I played the\ngame like a kid\u2019s game with my friends Jewish. I -- up to now I understand such an\nexpression, hanush kamoyra? Yes, hanush kamoyra, this is the Jew -- Yiddish don\u2019t\nworry, hanush kamoyra. Or a -- or very many su -- such expression, yes? So we were\ntogether --",
        "Q: That you learned from your friends?",
        "A: Yes, playing the game. Now, I -- I met them later in the schools, yes, but they have some\ndifficulties, because they -- they were Jewish by religion. They didn\u2019t know Poland, and\nthe -- very little of these Jewish boys and girls, they were Jewish. And this was later a\nterrible disaster for them, when the German entered Poland. They were so distinguished,\nso different, that the German can very easy separate them from th -- and I am just saying,\nbut that\u2019s -- this is the -- I mentioned that in -- in my life, I know very well what it means\nto be Jewish, yes? You see, in the -- in this -- in this town, you can have it always some\ncuriosity, yes? You can distinguish the curiosity between these people. So I can tell you if\nthere will be -- if there were jokes, or some malicious action, they were not organized, or\nsomething like -- because they -- people were very different, so they will make jokes on\nhim, or something, some curiosity, like you know, this is the certain period 1-in -- in\nJewish that they are bill -- building the shackle -- so small -- small hut, yes? For the -- I\ndon\u2019t know, this is the -- to memorize the traveling across the desert since many thousand\nyears ago, yes? So, I remember this, that they -- they -- they -- they people, or see -- or\nlike me, I say what\u2019s this, and so on, yes? But this was a curiosity that sometimes you can\nmake a joke, yes? But this was not a -- something that I -- I -- I hate this, yes? It was only\nrecognizing that they are different. Okay, but this is the word what I said, now what I\nhave to go, because I lost my -- my -- my -- my -- my talking.",
        "Q: I want you to just tell a little bit about family life. What was it like at home, what did\nyour mother do, or how much were you at home with your mother and father, your\nbrother and your sister?",
        "A: Yeah. So, of course that my very young period in Keltsa was -- was n-not significant for\nme, because 1 -- I wa -- I was seven, so at seven years old, I remember very little about\nthe Slominiki. I remember my friends playing the games and this, or going for fishing, or\nswimming. Or going to the forest to pick up the berries. And when I -- my really I enter\nmore active life, when I -- when our family move from Keltsa to Warsaw. At the age of\nseven I was with family in Warsaw. What\u2019s happened, my father was transfer from\nKeltsa to the headquarters of the police in Warsaw to be responsible for the certain\nmanufacturing in the workshop, and equipment which was needed for the Polish police.\nAnd at the time, I was already a student of the ed -- en -- be -- of high school, my -- my\nbrother was already in the gimnasium. My -- my daughters -- sisters were in the same --\nin different gimnasium for the girls, yes? And in a moment, as I mentioned to you, that --\nthat contact with mother and father was a very -- very close, but you had no time to be --\nfor a very long time together, yes? This was only sup -- some days. But, in the morning\nyou go to school, after school come back, workshop -- homework, and that\u2019s it. My\nactivities a -- by -- after ou -- after school, I participate in bands to play the corono, yes.\nMarching bands, and activity of the scouting, yes? And this was a -- three times a week,\nyes? So this is -- my brother, same real story, yes?",
        "Q: What was his name? His name?",
        "A: His name? Cheslof. Cheslof. He\u2019s a very famous name in -- in the work. I -- I will tell\nyou later. And -- and he was already studying [indecipherable] in gimnasium -- my sister\nwas in gimnasium, ri -- yes? My mother was a so-called housewife, yes? That\u2019s possible\nfor activity in the home, she had some help, yes, of the -- some maid from her town, who\nwas like a member of our family, forever, Helena Klanofska. And --",
        "Q: Just get you to say the names of your two sisters.",
        "A: Yes, ah, my sister was Yenema, and second Maria. Yenema, and Maria ga -- work in\ngimnasium that was a -- you -- you have to know that the gimnasium program was\nabsolutely the same in all gimnasium in Poland. There was no differences like here in the\nUnited States, that -- where you can study whatever you want. No, there was a program\nby the Ministry of Education, and the program of every gimnasium are absolutely the\nsame. And somebody can say, ho ho, this was the very fine matter to brainwash the\npeople, yes? Because you have a -- this is to be known for you. Yes, and no, but I can tell\nyou that in my life it was a positive, because this -- this program that was presented to\nme, I found that this was the very universal program. There was nothing very exaggerated\nto brainwash a young boy or a young girl. So, this is the time when we were to -- to\nPoland -- to -- to Rashava at \u201835, yes? And now is \u201835 [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Before we keep moving, when you got to Warsaw, where did you live?",
        "A: Aha.",
        "Q: What was the neighborhood like?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And also, 1f you could speak a bit about how you observed your faith.",
        "A: Ah. I have the picture. Maybe later I will show you. Education -- my education, because\nit -- what I remember since 30 -- exactly, exactly \u00b033 to \u00b039 yes, it was that -- being a\nstudent. Making the homework, go to the school, come back, make homework. Some\ncertain activity assign from the marching band, and -- and -- and scouting. Is, of course,\nvacation, going for the camps. I\u2019m saying this way, this was a very nice, and -- and\nstraightforward activity prescribed by the almost Ministry of Education, yes? So, contact\nwith mother and father was duri -- usually in the s -- Sunday, or -- or something like that.\nNow, my father, in 1955, yes, he made a decision because of the heart problem, that he\nhas to leave police, not as a rent -- not how to say voluntarily, yes? He\u2019s -- he said, \u201cI\nspending police enough of my life. I am still young.\u201d He always underlined this, in spite\nof the fact that he was 50, \u201cthat I have to do something for myself.\u201d And believe or not,\nhe was a very successful contractor -- contractor. He started to build homes in Warsaw.\nNow, we started to live in the part of Warsaw which was so called Saskakampa. This is\nthe very close, the proximity to the -- to the centrum of Vashar, it was two kilometers.\nAnd when I remembered -- when we came to this part of the town when my father build\nthe first house, there was a fields -- fields [indecipherable] fields, yes? When, at the end\nof the war, there was a beautiful, I think most beautiful part of the Warsaw, as a meeting\narea, like a n -- those were not big houses, small houses. And 1n this part of -- of war -- of\nWarsaw, in Saskacampa, my father build the five homes. And our -- we -- we started to\nbe very rich now, very rich. You know what does it mean to be worth in the time -- of\ncourse my family [indecipherable] father is a hundred thousand dollars. It was a lot of\nmoney. And he -- while he was -- he started to do this? Because he was in -- Michael\nMarcha}, yes, he was always energetic and full of activity. What he did, he said, there are\nmy town, there are my friends from the young period, and he had work. Let\u2019s them be my\nhelper, that I will take them from Volbrum, or Slominiki, I will bring them to the\nWarsaw, we will build the contemporary barracks, and then we\u2019ll start in spring to build\nthe house, and at the end of the year, the home for stoies with -- were ready. And my --\nfor these people, who [indecipherable] brought -- they took -- physically come here, build\nthe barracks. They -- Helena, our maid, she was a cooker for them, and believe me -- and\nthey were paid very well. They paid not as a salary by week, or something like, they\n[indecipherable] in this way. If you -- by number of bricks, yes, they get the salary. And\nthey, at the time earned a lot of money in the one summer period. And they -- they get out\nfor the winter, then next spring they came to another place, and do the same. So my father\ndid a lot of this very intelligently, and giving the chance to his friends, and now they were\nso angry to be again and again, so even then selected another friend --",
        "Q: So angry?",
        "A: Angry -- not angry, no, sorry, a wrong -- a wrong words.",
        "Q: Eager?",
        "A: Eager, yes they were eager to come here again, even to bring a better friends, to do better\njob, to do more money, yes, because they were in some way. So in this way, y -- we -- we\n-- I remember this, that in the springtime there was a [indecipherable]. In the -- in the -- in\nthe fall there was a -- a home. And -- so this was that. And the -- at the time, nothing\u2019s\nchanged in Marrowshak. The way of life was the same. We -- we -- my father -- I say it\nwas worth a hundred thousand dollars [indecipherable] that he di -- he doesn\u2019t have the --\nthis hundred dollars to spend, yes. This was the -- his building the future that he\nrecognized the fact that money make money. You cannot stop to do this. He was in very\nbig contact with the banks. He had the open credit in -- in the very famous banks in\nWarsaw. The name of my father was known, and he was a good creditor, yes, yes,\ncreditor. And besides that he build the houses, he made a -- a street, also, with the water,\nelectricity, and sewer system. Everything was [indecipherable] so when my father started\nin the very beginning of the street, he -- he -- the end was -- is another home, yes. So this\nwas the [indecipherable]. And now, it\u2019s come \u00b039 -- 1939.",
        "Q: Before you go there. I am curious about how your family worshipped.",
        "A: Ah, oh, yes, I mentioned it. Of course you see that there was a church built in the -- in\nthis part of the town where my father participate a lot. And in the school, yes, as I\nmentioned to you, there was a program, yes, that y -- y-you can -- you were -- you were\ntaught by the certain rules, and our education 1n school was in Catholic education to\n[indecipherable] that we have, and say for example Jewish -- for example Jewish, and --\nor ukra -- Protestant, because I was in the -- in the state gimnasium, yes? So it was\nrecognized by [indecipherable] by constitution as that, fine. That is a majority of the\nstudents, yes they are Catholic, so we have a catahead yes, in the p -- priest, yes, we were\ncoming and i -- they taught us a certain basic facts, and -- of -- of Catholic church\n[indecipherable] yes, yes? But, at the time there was such a -- is that somebody was\nProtestant or Jewish, yes? He was free to go to another -- his own far -- pre -- is his own,\nno -- activity, yes?",
        "Q: In other words, when you were studying tenants of your Catholic faith, maybe a\nProtestant or a Jewish student --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- would leave, go to another class, and they would have their own class?",
        "A: No, no. Because there was so little them at that moment, in spite of [indecipherable]\npopulation of the Jewish people, it was very -- quite big, yes? There was usually in -- in\ngimnasium -- government -- state gimnasium, mostly in my class it was three Jewish\npeople, and there was five Ukrainian. Is a -- yes -- no -- what is this in -- belief --\nOrthodox -- Orthodox Catholics, yes? So there they -- they did participate at that\nmoment, and this -- what they wanted to do depends on them. Yes -- during the -- of\ncourse, that -- when was that, Sunday, yes, and -- and it was summertime. I -- we were\nvery happy [indecipherable] because I played the march band, yes, we march band, so\nmany were to the church, and the gimnasium, went to the church in Sunday, yes? But we\n-- we -- we -- we have these privileges that we are saying between us, that we don\u2019t have\nto go to the mass. We don\u2019t -- we -- we -- we sit on the greens, under the tree, with our\ninstruments, yes. We didn\u2019t have to -- to be -- to be in the church, yes, and we listen to\nthis, yes, you know, I am saying we are -- and it was -- you -- you realize this fact, that\nthis was something which is forcibly to -- to put on you, you are re -- re -- very\nresistance, yes? So at the moment, to sit on the grass was better than to go to the church,\nwe said. But this was a -- you know, and not very serious abuse of -- I believe, but just\nyoung behavior, yes.",
        "Q: How old are you at this point, and what -- what are your ideas? Are you beginning to\nthink about what you might do in your life?",
        "A: Yes. Of course that -- under very big influence of -- for me, was my brother. So he was\ngrowing more and more, and he was very seriously, and good educated in the technical\nschool to be a constructor on the planes, yes? Aeronautics. So, of course my dream was\nof course when I finish in this, my education in the gimnasium, I will go to Polytechnic to\nbe a constructor of the planes, and at moment I will tell you that Poland was in the -- it\nwas very good to build the planes. Really fantastic industry of the military plane and\nsports plane. Every year the great event for us was the challenges. It was such a\ncompetition of the old country, German, Italy, France, and Czechoslovakia the so --\nSoviet Union never, there was a competition to fly -- racing, yes? A-Across -- around\nEurope. There was -- all these plane was [indecipherable] beautiful, beautiful planes. This\nis the time when the first Atlantic crossing in the opposite direction from east to west,\nwas made by Scarlinski on the plane who was I don\u2019t know. The Spirit of Saint Louis\nwas about twice as bigger, you see what I\u2019m saying? You know what speed\n[indecipherable] remember, Spirit of Saint Louis. Now I can see it in the museum in\nWashington, and that\u2019s was -- it\u2019s -- I saw it in Poland, in Warsaw when Lindberg visited\nPoland and with the san -- Spirit Saint Louis. I remember up to now this -- this especial\n[indecipherable] but special pattern of the heart of the engine made in circles. You can\nsee this very easy, and I remember this, even this detail, yes. So I -- I was very\nenthusiastic about the -- the planes, and another even was the gol -- golden Bennett\nballoon competition in Poland -- in Poland. It was a very, very, very nicely developed\nPoland, in 15 years of Poland existence. A lot of good teachers, scientists was\n[indecipherable] by the -- by the society.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve mentioned several times how patriotic your father was, and how his ideas and\nwhat was going on at the time shaped you. Can you tell us a little bit about the things he\nmight have said directly to you, as a son, about that?",
        "A: Yes, but this was -- this was something that I never agree with my father. It went that he\nwas in, at a certain time, not actively, not by his tek -- life experience, 1n opposition\nwhat\u2019s happening Poland. You remember the Pilsudsk1, 1t was in my -- my god, yes? You\nbelieve or not, I have here in my wallet his picture. And because I never forgot at the\nmoment that he and 120 young people started to build the Poland, fight for Poland. Of\ncourse that later, this called the first brigade, this wa -- so-called. Piersha brigada, the first\nbrigade. All these people were very educated, very aware people, very good educated\npeople in military and professional. In the process of the development of the country, and\nadministration of the country, a little of these people, very good people, as a soldier, was\nnot necessary very good to be in government. And my father, because he was more\nactive, and he has a very open eyes as a business man, yes? He say no, these people are\nnot very good. So don\u2019t believe everything, you know? And this was in some way in very\nmalicious -- not malicious, how to say distortion, yes? The very famous song of this\ngroup of people, yes, was [sings in Polish]. It was such a melody, and it was very often\nplayed during these festivities, yes? So my father s-s -- found the song a little bit\ndistortion, he say, \u201cDon\u2019t give me everything what they are singing to you.\u201d This was\nalways a warning for my father. But politically, he was not a politician, and politically\nPoland was in statoos nastemi, s-speaking in Latin, the state of to be born, yes? So we --\nwe have no knowledge what does it mean politics, yes? This new cadre of the people,\nyoung people, like a new generation which were growing to reach for this power, never\ndid it, because of the war --\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: -- me Greek.",
        "Q: -- and you know, Mr. Marchaj, anything that -- that comes up --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s Teddy, I\u2019m Ted.",
        "Q: Tadeusz. This is September 21\u00b0, 1998. We are in Arlington, Virginia to do an interview\nfor the Holocaust Memorial Museum. And this interview is with Tadeusz Marchaj. Tape\nnumber two. Can you tell us about your involvement with the scouts? What were the\nscouts?",
        "A: Scouting organization, as I mentioned in the very beginning -- you know the very\nbeginning in the meantime. Well, this was a movement established by the Baden Powell.\nHe was a -- some officer during the first World War, and he had an idea at the time, so far\nas I remember that people has to do something to avoid war. So this was a -- 1n some way\nI -- I mentioned that like a paramilitary organization, but strong emphasize that the war,\nand fighting will never be used. So shortly is picking the education in the scouting\norganization, it was rather to present the history of nation, if this -- in Poland there was\nPolish nation, or in France French, or in England. And this was a -- maybe this is a -- in\nsome way, a -- a contradiction, that we were educated militarily, yes? But there was never\npresented to us that we will be a soldier. And -- but this -- maybe somebody who -- who\nin Poland was in the command of this organization in Poland, maybe they have some\nhidden idea. Let\u2019s keep some cadre, some basic people who will be educated\npatriotically, and paramilitarily, with some knowledge of the survival, yes, in every\npossible way, and let\u2019s to exercise this, yes. So let\u2019s go to the forest, let\u2019s go to the\nwoods, and do what we want to do. That\u2019s a -- in the United States you have this\norganization up to now. I don\u2019t know how the -- how they are calling here, is --",
        "Q: Boy Scouts.",
        "A: Boy Scout, yes, Boy Scout, yes. Same story. And in 90 percent, it was the same, but with\nsome addition in Poland, that we have education in Polish army, yes? But not army, m-m-\nmilitary education that\u2019s safe -- soldier were taught, yes? And you have to know that in --\nhad the -- one of the Polish town -- I am saying Polish, because it\u2019s no more Polish, but\nhe was always Polish, this Lvov. But this is strange, because I don\u2019t want to abuse\n[indecipherable] Cryenian, who claimed that Lvov is L\u2019viv. Because really, Lvov is in\nCryena, but it was built by the -- historically, by the people from Poland, from the\ninfluence of the kings, and the big town was like a island in the ocean of the Ukrainian\npeople. So, really, it is a Polish town, but is a Ukrainian town. So why I\u2019m mentioning\nthat, in the fight for this -- for this town, participate a lot of young people, with the\nbackground of the scouting, the youngest soldier in that time, and were called -- and even\nthere was a very famous cemetery, which was destroyed during the Soviet occupation of\nUkrainia. And now there\u2019s a big issue between Ukrainia and Poland, how to rebuild this\ncemetery, which is a very sanct -- sanctisimus place for the Polish people. And not to\nabuse the Ukrainian. You have to find the modis revendi between the Ukrainian who hate\nPoland because of action of these small kids fighting for Lvov, and now this cemetery\nagain. And so they are trying [indecipherable] but I think that -- I hope that there will be a\nsolution.",
        "Q: Can you give us an example of something that you were taught when you talk about\nparamilitary techniques? What were some of the things that you were taught in scouting?",
        "A: Y-You see the -- it will be hel -- very proper to say that at the time I had no time to think\nabout it. This was a -- scouting was such a big pleasure even to -- to do this or that, and\nso on, if this is the military or not military. There was a something that is needed, I think,\nfor the young people. And -- and therefore the -- this movement of the scouting, Boy\nScouts in America, is still in existence, yes? Or I -- I don\u2019t know if it will exist farther,\nbut there is a need for this, and there was a need for us. And what -- what I was thinking,\nfirst of all, that anyway, if there was a so-called zbouvika is in Polish, the meeting, yes?\nMeeting of the -- say, a group of -- is very difficult for me to say, because maybe there is\nano -- I cannot translate. Zasta. A -- a group, like sa -- shortly speaking, but the\ndoushina, means a unit of the same gimnasium, was divided in -- in sastempai. Doushina,\nthey consist with say, seven, eight groups of, and every group has a different name,\ndifferent flags, proportion, different distinction, and so on. So there was, in some way, a\nvery visible military influence into this group. But believe me, I never in my -- at the\ntime, in my mind was a feeling that I will be a soldier, yes? We didn\u2019t think about that,\nbut very soon, it\u2019s happened that we started to think 1n this way, when the war came.",
        "Q: Did you learn any skills that you would call survival skills, and what were they?",
        "A: Oh, oh yes, yes, every -- I can tell you that 1 -- this independence of movement, and --\nand the reading the maps. When he -- I remember they lost my camp, that our group shot\n-- | have to g -- [indecipherable] backwards. My group of -- of this organization was\nplaced or attached to the gimnasium. This was a pack activity of the gimnasium\neducation. I -- my gimnasium was called gimnasium iminya, like airport in New York,\nhere in the Washington D.C.\u2019s, Reagan\u2019s and so on. So this group was Iminya\nTerayousha Raytanna. And it was a very historical, patriotic man who fought in one of\nthe uprising against the partition, and he was very famous fighter. He was captured and\nexecuted in Poland. Tadeusz Rader. And -- no do -- Rater, sorry. Raton, it was a fighter, a\nlegal fighter for the 1m -- for the Polish constitution, during the -- now the -- th-this group\nwas name Iminya Romwilda Trowaguta. Romwald Trowagut. This was the gam -- man\nwho fought in Polish uprising, one of the many of Polish uprising, and it was executed in\nSitadella in Warsaw. So, y-you can see, the name of the gimnasium is some fighter. The\ngroup of the s-scouting is Amoura Trowguta, and this was the Vuda -- WDH,\nVudabashefska Doushina Hertesk. Iminya Rumwilda Trowguta. Number one. We were\nthe black one in Warsaw. Very good and known Doushina. And now I am coming back\nto the -- to -- to continue what you aski -- what you were asking me, il -- and this was?",
        "Q: Survival skills.",
        "A: Survival skills. So therefore, the last vacation we had in Lithuania -- now, in Lithuania,\nbut at the time, was Poland. And why Lithuania was Polish, because you have no -- that\u2019s\nthe whole Lithuania, I will have no problems with it -- with Lithuania, because you can\ngo to the Central Park in Manhattan, you can find the -- the monument of King Leogarro,\nwith the two swords, and there is written under the pedestal, of this monument in Central\nPark in Manhattan, that this king, and Queen Yadiveega, it was the first confederation in\nhuman history of the two states peacefully. Lithuania and Poland were built now\ntogether, big, huge country, yes? So peacefully created, not -- no single blood was flown,\nyes? So, in Lithuania, of course that after the war, first World War was finished, a lot of\nsmall countries claim their right to be independent state. So Lithuania was such a leetva --\nwhatva -- Estonia, yes? These country were built due to the treaty in Versailles after the\nwar. Now, a very powerful man in this political movement was Pilsudski, who created, as\nI mentioned to you, there was hundred -- with the two hun -- 120 soldier he went to fight,\nand he was born in Lithuania, in the territory of Lithuania. And he say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s mine,\nand forget it.\u201d\u201d Yeah, he -- nobody can do this, and he -- if -- he said, \u201cIf some -- if the\ntreaty will not accept it, we of Poland, so we will fight.\u201d",
        "Q: So you went to Lithuania for the vacation?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: With the scouts.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is this where you learned some of the skills?",
        "A: No, he -- it means that every s -- I mentioned only that the one of my last scouting -- two\nmonths I spend there, the last, but in the meantime I was in manning, previously. But this\nwas the more -- my heart, I was lost there, in Lithuania. This is such a beautiful country,\nthat you have my imagination. And it -- in the nature, the rivers, history. The Polish\npoetry, like Padameetskavi is one of the Polish biggest poets. He was born there, too, and\nhis biggest poem was related to the Lithuania. His poem -- he opens -- he opens this\npoem, a very famous poem, Pamapdayoush, he open in this way, [speaks Polish]. I will\ntranslate. Leetfo -- my fatherlike -- my -- yes? He, in some way, he is not saying that\nLeetva was totally not recognize. It was always recognize, yes? But these Lithuanian\npeople -- strictly Lithuanian, they -- they accepted this, oy -- and they are always saying\noh, adam mitskabich. He is a Lithuanian, sorry that he wrote in Polish. Yeah, but this 1s\nthe case. So -- but this is only a certain animosity occurred because of the proud, yes?\nToo much proud. And now, personally, yes, I am answering the question. Lithuania is\nLithuania. I know that this is the place where he -- Jusef Plusetti was born, and Adam\nMitskavich was there, but Lithuania was Lithuania. So maybe you -- on this case you will\nfind my character in some way, that I am not a chauvinist is very -- how to say it? Is not -\n-] am not a chauvinist, shortly speaking, yes? So, I am open-minded, I want to respect\nthis, and bart -- what I\u2019m saying, that I love Lithuania, doesn\u2019t mean that I have\n[indecipherable] Lithuania is mine. And now, in this -- in this territory, survivor. In some\nway military education. We get the military map, very accurate, you know, one kilometer\nwas one centimeter. And we get a one Polish zokey -- money. And we get our task force,\nsay. We are going from here to here, in three days. You have to pass these -- all places,\nand this is the straightforward, not roads, because there wasn\u2019t roads, yes? You have a\ncompass, map, money for survival in the case that you can buy something. And you have\nto pass this route going from the place to place, and you have to get the stamp from the\nauthorities of the village, or some places. There are -- you -- y-you realize this fact, that\nin every village, there is a so-called vuid. I don\u2019t know how to translate it, yes, who --\nwho is administrator from the government side, yes? Now he had the stamp, he sign it,\nand so on. And in this way, you have to go by three days, alone, through the forest, from\nplace to place in three days. Of course, we did it sometimes, these routes in the zastiempi,\nin the very small group, yes, five, six, seven boys. Same [indecipherable], yes? Now y --\nthis was so-sometimes more difficult because a route was made by the -- our leaders, yes,\nthat you have to cross the river, yes? It was a no mo -- no bridges, yes, you have to find a\nway that you have to be on the other side, yes, and so on. So this was a survivor. This was\na very, very difficult.",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: At that time I was 13.",
        "Q: And how did you do it?",
        "A: I did it. I did it. I can tell you that the one -- no, this -- this -- this last one was -- I was 14,\nbecause you see, I now recognize this fact that my route was drawn by our leader through\nthe military exercise polygon. You know what does it mean? A polygon? I don\u2019t know\nhow to translate. Evongsplatz in German, which, it be a subject, the -- th -- what is this,\nthe -- that the -- that the military training ground --",
        "Q: Like training school?",
        "A: -- oh, training ground. And I approach my g -- then, and there was a post of the soldier. I\nsay, \u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d Did you hear what there is going around in here\n[indecipherable]. And you hear, [makes whirring sound]. The guns shel was passing, and\nwhum! Yes, there was a so-called [indecipherable] it was not a ex -- 1-it was a -- the shell\nwas a real shell, yes. So if I would be there, I could be killed. So at that moment I opened\nmy map, and asked to the soldier, he was very respectful for me, oh-oh. So no, no, so you\nhave to go -- you have to go now this, this, this, and so on. This was another six\nkilometers more, yes, and I did it, yes. A-A-A-And this was a -- a very big pleasure.\nAdventure. Adventure not only this, because you see, I -- when I have to go and to sleep,\nof course I can do this. On the ground, with my, you know, rucksack, yes, backpack. But\nthis is a very romantic [indecipherable] of Poland, that there you have small houses, so-\ncalled -- you see, Poland are very attached to the nobilities, but nobilities -- not only very\nhigh ranking nobilities, you have a certain gradation of nobilities from grafs and so on,\ngoing down, down, down, down, and you have a nobility which we call in Poland shlakta.\nIt means that these were the previous soldier in the kingdom, yes, that they get the certain\nprivileges from the king, including the -- what is this, coat of arm, yes, and name of this\ncoat of arm. And they get the right to build a beautiful houses, small houses. Even -- I\ndon\u2019t know if -- if you have a picture of the sort of house that you could see, it was the\nhouse where the [indecipherable] was born, and he lived there. Such a small house. And\nwe -- crossing this country, we tried to find such a place. And we get there beautiful -- no\n-- treatment, yes? But very -- but this is -- was a dying, dying history, yes, when I came to\nsuch a house, and there was this sitting old man, and he, \u201cHey, boy, what are you doing?\u201d\nAnd so on. I say, \u201cMay I ask you, sir to spend the night here?\u201d\u2019 Ooh, so at once he called\nsomebody [indecipherable], \u201cPrepare this room for this boy,\u201d and so on. And this was\nsuch a nice -- and you are [indecipherable] homes full of history, full of different picture,\ncarvings, and so on. Beautiful. So this was the -- my -- my experience of the -- such a --\nexercising this scouting.",
        "Q: Tell us about your health.",
        "A: Health, oh. It went that -- I didn\u2019t mention very important fact in my life, that being four\nyears old, I was a victim polio, in Kieltsa, there was epitome 17 cases of the -- of this\nillnesses, and -- and I was paralyzed at the time from the -- the lower part of my body,\nand -- and therefore as -- as I mentioned is that I have a small compart with my brother,\nbecause when I recover, and when I started recover my ability to walk, I was cripple. I\nwas walking in very special way, you know, very big movement from side to side to -- to\nmove the legs in the direction. And step by step, day by day, year by years, my\nimprovement was very big, and -- and I -- I recover almost all my ability to walk, and to\nthis extent that when I was say, 15 - 16 -- this 1s the occupation time, I had no visible --\nvisible -- no visible effects of this. And at the moment I remember that when I was\ntrained by the very big sportsman in Poland, the medalist of the Olympic games in Berlin,\n1936, he train us to jump. He was a -- a dec -- decathlon -- decathlon. And he exercise us,\nand all the -- you see this the occupation like maybe we will [indecipherable] to this\n[indecipherable] in occupation. So I recover, and I was good swimmer, especially\nbecause it was given order by the doctors, swim, swim, swim, swim, swim. So swimming\ngive me a chance to build up again the muscle.",
        "Q: Do you know if the other children in Kieltsa were able to recover like you?",
        "A: Believe me I didn\u2019t want it to mention. There was only one. You see, I was born, and my\nmother told me strictly, \u201cYou are not born to us. You are born on [indecipherable] what is\nwritten [indecipherable]. \u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cyou were born in cap.\u201d You -- you know the\nlegend if somebody\u2019s born in cap, ifchukgu ouradzoni, it means that he is the very lucky\nperson.

He will be Tadeusz Kashoushka.\u201d So I am\nTadeusz, because of his will.",
        "Q: Think back to when you first began to perhaps hear what was going on in Germany. I\ndon\u2019t know if you might have heard it on the radio, maybe your father came home and\nwas speaking of it. Can you tell us about that?",
        "A: Of course. I have some -- some recognition -- not ne -- re -- not recognition si -- no,\nadmit -- I remember [indecipherable] speaking. When my brother, as I mentioned to you\ntoo, he was a student in the aeronautic department, and he was a very good student. He,\nas a award, he was sent to Paris on the Internationale Exhibition of the Aeronautics, as a\nstudent, and he did a -- such a gift from Polytechnic. And he was traveling from Paris to\nGermany to Poland. And when he was traveling through the Germany, he had a double\n[indecipherable] and he told me -- these things I remember -- that in Berlin, he was\nalmost abused by some German because he didn\u2019t speak German, and 1s a -- ridiculous\nthat he -- consider him that he\u2019s Jewish. And he just had a problem just to get the lead off\nthis followers who tried to -- to -- to -- to do something with him. But I remember this.\nThat\u2019s one story. But another story --",

        "A: At the train station in Berlin somewhere.",
        "Q: Okay, uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: And -- but anyway, he was admirer of Germany because of his progress technologic. He\nwas -- you understand, he was how to build the planes, and so on, and at that moment,\nyou know, the yoomkers, you know, with big, very famous planes and so on, and was for\nhim, you know, recognized and a-as a professional [indecipherable] were there, good.\nYou -- you -- you follow me?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s the only one of -- of the Germans he is thinking about. Of course, that -- this the\nimpression about this Volkswagen, you know, this was another story, yes? Jesus, how\nmany cars? You know, the -- everybody has a car, and so on, and so on. So this was this,\nbut the other part of this, he said, \u201cThere -- I was almost beaten there, because they\nconsider me that I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d",
        "Q: And what was the conversation like between you? Did you speculate about what was\ngoing on? Was it surprising?",
        "A: Oh y -- yo-you see, this tension started many -- maybe two, three years before the war\noccurred. It was a big recognition of the problem that is growing with the German,\nbecause demand, you know, maybe you were -- ma -- you rec -- you know where the\nbigger -- beginning of the aggressive movement on the German was annexia of the\nAustria. Then was an action of the Czechoslovakia. And this was a very big shame for\nPoland, that\u2019s a terrible. You know, the German enter into the certain territory of\nCzechoslovakia. Poland enter at the certain territory of Czechoslovakia einder, which\nPoland claimed that this is the Polish. And this is a shame. I -- I -- even at that time, my\nfather -- oh, my father was terrible. What they are doing? What they are doing, you\nknow? And you know, Czechoslovakia under the big power. And [indecipherable] you\nsee, there was -- this will never happen when Pilsudski was, only now, only now. This\nwas the -- this -- his officer, you know, from the peersha brigada, you -- you follow me?\nThese people did a very bad historical movement. Because later, in few years, we get the\nsame from the Soviet Union. So, y-y-you -- you know that this was a -- and therefore, as I\nmentioned, this is start to grow our concern, what will happen, how will we -- how will --\nwe will be -- how will we behaves? And then was the first demand of Hitler, yes? That he\nwant to have the -- a railroad line across the Polish territory from Germany to East\nPrussia. Then, started to claim the Dansk -- Dansik is German. Absolutely ridiculous\nbecause you can call the any time -- any town, you can call it, because the Gdansk is a\nharbor, was created by the Hunza. Hunza it was a merchant organization who, along the\nshore of the Baltic Sea, and North Sea created the harbor for the merchant. For the\nhandling, for the transportation of goods back and forth, yes? And Gdansk was built as a\nharbor in some way by the people -- not the people, by the company -- like you remember\nthat -- what is -- what was Carlotta in the very beginning? Carlotta in the very beginning -\n- beginning was a company country, yes? So in the same way, Hunza built -- not claim\nthe -- not claim the -- that this territory belongs to, but they started to build the wa -- the\ntown. And with all background, yes? And -- and never consider is that this is the -- wa --\nthat this was not -- not a -- not a such a country like Hunza. Hunza was a -- it was a\ncompany, yes? So this was a -- a very strong -- Hitler said, \u201cThis is German.\u201d This line\nhas to be -- and is growing, and growing, pressure, exploded in some way, and I was\nparticipating in this event historical, and of course, at the time, Minister Beck, owsen\nminister, made a speech. On the 15\"\" of August, and I have always problem to translate\nwhat is Herpen, Herpen is August. So this was the 15\" day, and this was anniversary\nwhen the Polish -- 120 Polish, under the leadership of -- of Pilsudski started to war, and\nhe said, openly to Hitler in some way, \u201cWe will never give you -- our coat to you. We\nwill never give you a button from this coat.\u201d I remember this word nyoldami never\ngozheeka. This button you will never get from us. And this was a strong --",
        "Q: [inaudible] which year?",
        "A: Ee?",
        "Q: Which year?",
        "A: It was exactly \u201939. I remember I came from the scouting camp, and I went to visit my --\nmy [indecipherable] parents, as I mentioned, you know, Titusk, Kameeta, and so on, and\nwe -- I was with my godfather, Jusef Meeta. He took us, yes, me and his children who\nwent to the special place in Borna korkoski. A -- a field, yes, special bornia field, this\n[indecipherable]. And there was this big gathering, and at this gathering owsen minister\nsaid, \u201cWe will never retreat from this [indecipherable] man.\u201d And believe or not, this was\nthe 15\"\", and 23\" of -- of September. The paratroopers -- not paratroop -- paratroopers,\nno. The parachuters, yes? The special units of the German army already invaded a very\nstrategic pass in Tutramounti. Because order was given by the Hitler that this is the day to\nbegin the war.",
        "Q: In -- in August of \u201939, after that speech, or perhaps even before it, were preparations\nbeing made that you knew of?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: To -- were peop -- I guess I want to ask, what were people expecting, and what were you\nand your family expecting?",
        "A: You see, this was a only patriotic reaction.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We will fight. And build up of our -- I have am -- a big feeling about myself, oh I am\nstrong, and I can resist, of course. It was, shortly speaking, it was stupid, yes. It means\nthat megalomaniac. I am using a wrong word. You see, when you are proud, you can\nbuild up -- no, no, I am strong enough to fight, and so on. Let\u2019s try to fight, yes we will\nfight. But without -- without calculation, you have to calculate how many planes you\nhave, how many guns you have, how many things you have, with whom you will fight?\nWith the bare hands? Yes, and this was the case. That soldier, Polish soldier in battle in\nthe war in 1939 fought with the bare hands with the tanks. [indecipherable]. No, this 1s\nhow -- I will tell you, because I -- I was the witness of this, yes. When the Polish cavalry\nattacked with the -- with the -- with the almost [indecipherable] yes, the German tank.",
        "Q: So tha -- at that point, you knew there may be a battle?",
        "A: Yes. I -- even I remember in my -- my -- in my -- my cousin [indecipherable] because I\nwent apart from this day, because I know, in my -- my uncle -- my grandfather say, \u201cNot\nta -- Tad, go back home, yes, because is very bad.\u201d This a -- this was the 20\", yes -- yes\na -- is not yet first, yes, of September, \u201cyou have to go back in to -- to family, because,\u201d --\nand I know that this 1s [indecipherable] wrote in this memoir. When the -- when the war\nis behind it all. To memorize this, and so on, and I wrote. And when I was in Poland, she\nshow -- show -- show me this inscription, and -- and [indecipherable] if you said it was\nsome preparation, yes, there was a -- a mobilization, and the -- there is a -- the soldier had\nto go, you had a certain no -- documents to be in the certain military units and so on, and\nslowly Poland prepared to do war, but anyway -- and this came to us as a big surprise,\nyes.",
        "Q: What was your father doing, and your mother, and [indecipherable] and your brother\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah -- oh yes, absolutely, I -- I remember everything this day, this morning. I opened\nthe radio -- no, uh-huh, first of all, I not yet know. It was already the preparation for the\nwar was ordered in some way that -- of course, I know I -- lucky guess, but I knew,\neverywhere, people are doing up to now, they saying, we -- we tape the window glasses\nby the paper, yes, to avoid when the blow will hit the glass, and the bomb, and there will\nbe no shrapnels from these glasses, and you will avoid -- first of all, you are\nstrengthening this window, and you are avoiding the splintering of the glasses. So I, at\nthat moment, day before, and at that morning, I was busy to tape the windows. And I\nopened the radio, and I hear the pom per om pom pom per ad da da da dum. It is Polish\nanthem playing, and then there will be a -- appeal of the president Ignacio Mashtitsk1.\nAnd I am listening. Today at five o\u2019clock, German army crossed the border. We are in\nstate of war with Germany. I jumped on the balcony, my father was doing somewhere,\nand I said, \u201cFather,\u201d [indecipherable]. I say, \u201cIt\u2019s a war.\u201d He didn\u2019t recognize what I am\ntalking about. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said, \u201cIt is a war.\u201d And at the moment I remember that his voice\nburst into the cry, \u201cWhat?\u201d Once more again he was asking. I say, \u201cIs a war.\u201d And he ran\nupstairs, and was listening, and he said -- because he knew, he knew [indecipherable].\nThere is no chance, yes? That\u2019s end. And of course, this was beginning of the episode of\nour -- we are calling this rising -- not rising, jammi, because the -- very soon knew, of\ncourse, that we saw this first battle fight -- fight by -- by the planes over the Warsaw, this\n-- you know, this sounds of the machine guns from the area [makes machine gun noise].\nThis was a fight in here. And then came this morning, a [indecipherable] with brother of\nmy father from another part of Warsaw and bring this big, huge part of the bomb. And\nsee, because there was a, \u201c[indecipherable] bombing? No, that\u2019s not true.\u201d And he\u2019s\ntaking a [indecipherable], \u201cLook at this, what does it mean?\u201d And then was a appeal of\nthe mayor of the -- of the -- after a few days that the eight of September, that appeal to\nthe people that all mens who are able to carry the duty, they have to lead the force in\nPoland -- Varbarshava, and have to go into the eastern direction. And now, my brother.\nHe was a worker in the Institute of Aeronaut -- Aerodynamics of the Polish -- Polish nay\n-- Polytechnic, he was the worker at that time, scientist, and -- not scientist, mo --\nscientist, yes, part of the -- of the staff of the Polytechnic, and they got the order for\nevacuation of this institute into the east, too. And he was separately, he -- he\n[indecipherable] say, \u201c\u201cGood-bye, maybe we will see each other,\u201d and he gone. And then -",
        "Q: You did get a chance to say good-bye?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes, he-he came to the home, he was prepare -- he took the rucksack, he would\ntake the -- some blankets, and so on, and he departed with the Institute of Aeronautactics.\nAnd I -- I was at that month, as I say, exactly 14 - 15, I begin. And ha -- my father told\nme he is decision family, we are leaving Warsaw all together. Mother, father, me and two\nsister. And we started to go, yes, and this was the hour, no, or the saya, no, it\u2019s not the\nsaya, this is -- was a -- hard to say, this was big tragedy because hide -- at the moment I\nsaw everything possible that war is giving us. We started to go with the crowded roads,\ntogether mixed, the soldier, people. One is going this, another is going this. And so on, in\na couple hours they are flying these planes, German, and bombing these, and you can see\nmore and more graves, killing horses and so on. Smell of -- of war. You can see burning\nhouses. And this was a -- because this is -- this was a first experience of this. And we\ndidn\u2019t walk too -- very far when we were [indecipherable]. I think 1t was 17 September.\nWe were in the very small village, Kitchkee, I remember forever, and we get a message\nfrom the soldier, that Soviet Union is fighting on the eastern -- our border. Is attacking us\nfrom behind. So our departure into the east was useless, yes? So therefore my mother,\nand my father yes, they made a decision, we are staying here in this village, and we will\nsee what\u2019s happen. And Warsaw -- and very soon we -- oh, we -- we had a contact around\nthere, for the first time, you know, my father was -- I considered my father that he is a --\na little bit coward. I always consider his resistance to do something that this the sign of\nhis cowardness, which it was -- which was wrong. And maybe this --",
        "Q: I don\u2019t understand? Co-ward?",
        "A: I -- coward, coward.",
        "Q: Coward. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Coward, yes, so. Some sort of coward. H-He sm -- his resistance to do something, to be --\nto be patriotic and so on, because he [indecipherable] father, but there was one day, when\nwe -- everything was just in one bigs mixture of the army, this army, Polish army, almost\nlike a partisan war. And in one place we were on -- on the road in some -- a crossing\nroad, and suddenly, unbelievable, Polish army is gone, yes? Cars, cavalry, yes, and the\nrunning, and my father, I -- I saw his first time that he jumped because he was a\npoliceman, yes, he was -- he knew what is going on, yes? He jumped on this criss-\ncrossing of this lot, and asks of this commander, \u201cWhere you want to go?\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWe want to go there, and there.\u201d So [indecipherable] like aragu -- you like be in the\nRussian [indecipherable] yes? With the commander of the -- at the -- at the corner of the\nstreet. This way, this way, yes? So he did -- get, and he stood in this criss-crossing, and\nhe say, \u201cThere are German in opposite -- not Germans backwards.\u201d It was like this Polish\narmy went like that, but German was on this road, yes? My father was standing and\nsaying, \u201cGo there. Not here, not here, because there are the German.\u201d So they -- they\nwent there. Believe me it was in one minute my -- my father was still standing on this\ncorner, and dshhhooo, they are going the -- the German -- German -- the -- with tanks,\nand the tanks, and -- and military [indecipherable] armored [indecipherable]. And he had\nenough time just to jump out from this street. And the people [indecipherable] want some\nof the action. And then these people entered on the lot where the -- these Polish troops\nwent, in some way creating impression that this road is not used. And German, they was\nconfused, they went to go, and ssshooo, went there. Of course, that this was not very long\ntime because they have no chance, yes, and sooner or later there was five. But not at that\npoint. And moment I see, ho, ho, ho, my -- my father is not -- is not a such great coward.\n[indecipherable] I can say. This is the os -- episode of this. And then we stay as four --\nfour more days and then we get a message that Warsaw, on the 27\" of September,\nsurrounded. [indecipherable] town for -- fort -- this was big tragedy, you know this was\nhow badly was demolished for -- we might -- that\u2019s the first victim of my family. A girl,\nthree years old. It was a daughter, it was my cousin, daughter of my -- of brother to my\nfather. He working in hospital by the bombing. They -- they bomb everything. Hospital\nwere not respected. So she was dead. Of course, then there -- we came to the Warsaw,\nfirst contact with the German.",
        "Q: What made your father and mother decide to [inaudible]",
        "A: Why?",
        "Q: What?",
        "A: No -- we knew it, yes, already, yes. We get the message that the Soviet Union is fighting\non this part. So our -- our looking for the freedom in the east, it was just dreaming\n[indecipherable] bad -- wrong thing. So why don\u2019t we -- let\u2019s go home. Come back home,\nand then fine, we would find what we -- how this new time will be, and we\u2019 ll see -- and\nwe approach the Warsaw, and there was a [indecipherable] German surrounding the -- in\nthe Warsaw, and -- with the guard still standing, aiming into the Warsaw, and they say,\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d In German, and \u201cHome,\u201d yes? And they just resp -- not\nrespected the -- kee -- making such a movement [indecipherable]. And -- and of course\nthat -- only this street, not -- not something because you can have some mine -- some --\nyes, because there was some prepared by the Polish [indecipherable]. So they have to go\nonly this [indecipherable] and the -- at end of the day, we -- we found a home, not totally\n-- not destroyed, but there was na -- no window, yes, everything was blown away. And\nthat home was still home, yeah. And this 1s the beginning of the occupation. Of course,\nthis is the beginning of a new chapter which -- which is a -- very long, because we -- we\nwere, as I mentioned to you that suddenly the whole life was wiped out. No supply, no\nelectricity, no water, this, and so on. So we started -- and winter was very severe, you\nknow, at the time. [indecipherable]. Big frost. But we managed to -- to cover everything,\nand ha -- ha -- and ha -- and this is the case. So September, October, we started to dream\nabout the school, and I was already in -- visitor the school, asking the professors if we --\nwhen we will started to do something, and so on. Yes, [indecipherable] were enthusiastic,\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we will very soon begin.\u201d And so on. So we did it. The school started. But\n-- because there was not even from the German side, there was no yet -- not yet order\ngiven. They didn\u2019t know what they will do with us, yes? And -- and after a -- say two\nweeks of our presence in the school, in the di -- director, Yeski said, \u201cAnd now we have\nto wait what the German authorities will give us. But be will contact with us, because if --\nif we will have no permission to open the gimnasium, we will do this secretly, yes.\u201d Yes,\nin Poland, you have the whole education system working in conspiracy, including the\nuniversity.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: This is September 21\u201c, 1998. We are in Arlington, Virginia, doing an interview for the\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum. And this interview is with Tadeusz Marchaj. And it is\ntape number three. And let\u2019s begin where we left off, which was really school, and what\nwas going on with school?",
        "A: So, as I mentioned, in the very beginning of the occupation, we went to the school, for\nthe very short few weeks, maybe days, it\u2019s hard for me to remember. And then, when we\ncame one day, and that director of the school, Yarosh Yishki, his name, and\n[indecipherable] what\u2019s means honey, he was such a sweet man. And he said, \u201cWe will\nbe in contact with you, either when will be a commission to do something legally by the\nauthorities, or we will start to teach you in conspiracy.\u201d Of course, I think that it was\nsomething very hard for me to remember the exactly -- but in the very beginning of the\nspringtime, it was organized by the German, so-called -- I -- I will tell you in Polish\nmaybe, because later I will try to translate it is [speaks Polish] grade two. It means that --\nmeaning this was that the -- are the schools preparing the student for the profession --\nprofession. Zebador. It means that this here, the time you can see, yes? That the German\nestablished the -- that we can learn something, but only to be a, say, professional, like a\nmechanics, whatever is, es -- mechanics, I don\u2019t know, carpenter, anything. It means that\n-- meaning of this arrangement was just to -- that description of the future Polish people\nis to be a worker, slave. And I -- so we started in such a school, but of course it -- the\npicture were the same. So between the program established by German, there was\nsecretly delivered history of Poland, language Polish, and this what was strictly forbidden\nfrom the -- to -- to maintain the identification of the -- identity of the student, yes. We are",
        "Q: If it was -- how was it secretly done?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Would they do it in the class, or would -- what were they doing?",
        "A: Yes, yes, and no. It means that history, and so on, was made on the complete -- we are\nsaying complett -- complete a group of students, yes, assigned by the professor, they were\nin private apartment, yes, and there was a teacher, yes. But if there was a legal given, say\nfor example this was a -- no, just writing, yes, you know, you have to teach the writing,\nand -- a-and some grammary, and so on. So in this class, there was a 1 -- Yensik Poleski\nwith the literature selected for us, almost according to the program established by the\nMinister of Education in Poland, which Germans say forget it, yes? No, we did it. And\nbesides, at that moment, conspiracy wi -- to do something illegal in the school, it was\nmaybe illegal for the authorities, but it was not illegal for us, because you -- we identify\nus very easy. We know who we are, and there was no totally for -- not the foreigners no,\nthe strangers, yes? So we know that we are between the Polish student. So this was easy,\nyes. It was because I say, but something that was strictly forbidden, like history and so\non, we made it in complete, 1-1-in -- in -- in totally di-different places, yes. But something\nwere -- was, according to the Ministry of Education, Polish, yes, was made by the\nprofessor voluntarily, yes? In spite of the order of the authorities. Because there was no\nguards standing in the school, yeah. And this is the case. And at the same time, yes, we\nscouts, our doushina, the first WAGD started to operate. So we had -- we started power\ngathering, yes, continuously, like nothing happened. But not in the school, but\nsomewhere.",
        "Q: Tell us about that first meeting. Who -- who called it, and what did they say, and did you\nunderstand that it was something secretive?",
        "A: Yes. We know each other, yes, very good. And there was a certain kierarchy in our\ncommandant, yes. And there was a meeting, and the first meeting, say for example I was\n-- | was in the group with the -- the name was lion -- lion, roar, roar. And at this meeting\ncame our higher commander, and he say, \u201cWe will do this secretly as previously.\u201d Of\ncourse that you are now total -- and it was not yet very well, in the very beginning,\norganized, but the system started to operate that there was a certain schematic\npresentation. The line of the command, yes. Because there was such a line of command,\neven in the scouting, Polish scouting, yes. There was a hartsmish, you know, or -- or\ncommandant of the rayon -- region of Warsaw, then you have this. So this was starting to\n-- and this was the very beginning, there was not yet -- because you realize this fact, who\ncan -- who could do this? We. And therefore, we are the group that we started to operate\nin 1940, in March, as an organization. We have already more or less established the\nschematic line of order, yes? But of course, we didn\u2019t know what it was, yes? And these\ndocuments were collected, and were in storage later by the special emissary, yes, who\ntraveled. Later, was organized quite eerily, the day where the couriers that crossed the\nborders going through Yugoslavia, Italy, to this way, to search for the -- to deliver the\nsecond document. Then when this was established on the military bases, because the\nintelligence of the -- of the -- of the British, yes, was involved in this, yes, to -- to fight, to\nuse a people certainly, to organize people in Poland as a help -- as a resistance movement.\nAnd these certain documents were transferred. And believe me or not that my documents\nI found not in Warsaw, I found in London, exactly my name and my sowdo -- sudo, yes?\nSowdoyen, yeah? It -- it was, and it, up to now. And those documents I have here. And --\nand -- and of course that this what was scouting. It was like a signal to the higher\nauthorities, yes, because you -- y-you realize that the Polish government in exile have\nhere the representative in Poland. And they started to organize the very well military\norganization, yes, military. Spy, and so on. But -- but this scouting, yes, this was like a\nsignal, do something because people are, yes? And --",
        "Q: Explain that? It was a signal?",
        "A: Signal to the higher authorities --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- from the representative Polish government in exile in England, they have here the\nrepresentative, yes? They have -- it was already -- it is very hard for me to -- to tell you,\nbecause I -- I know, and I can find it yes, very easy, 1-1n -- in the documents -- historical\ndocument, yes, how this was established, day by day and so on, and who was the\nsaygoneero grotrovetski, yes? It was the first commandant of the -- of the home army.",
        "Q: But, 1s what you are saying is that this was somewhat a spontaneous thing, and the fact\nthat it was there was a signal to the powers in exile?",
        "A: Ee, yes, yes, except this was -- y-you have to realize that it was a big chaos, yes, chaos,\nyes? And -- and there was a -- nothing was -- 1-1t was completely everything in ruin,\nmilitary, militarily. Poland as a militare was not existent. But they were a scouting groups\nin Warsaw, and these groups was very -- very few of them. You see, all together you can\n-- you can find that there was as about 3000 in Warsaw. But these 3000 give the idea that\nthis is possible to do, yes? And now, Polish government in exile, started to organize this -\n- from the very beginning, by the nomination of the existing officer of the Polish army,\nand so on, and this was nominated that he is the -- responsible for this, this is responsible\nfor this, and so on, so on. And these organizations started, but this was one year later,\nyes? And the system was this, that sharda sheray, yes, in -- with the scouting organization\nwas called gray troops. Like, I -- I can translate in this way, but sheray shalagy. I have\nthis small anchor, there the symbol, symbol of -- of -- of this organiza -- this scouting\norganization. I -- I maybe -- maybe later I will show you this. And this scouting\norganization were this more mature, and more responsible authorities, yes? They get\ncontact with everything, and at the moment they fight. This 1s the case that we are now,\nthis organization from England, this we are recognizing, you know? But we have to re-\nestablish our skin. And they say no, from 18 up, yes? They say. From 18 up, they are\nrecognize as a member of the regular [indecipherable] so-called first what ZWZ. Zionvic\nWalki Zibronia. And then this or -- this even organization was not yet very well\norganized. The next step was the Akar, Armia Krajowa. Because the Zedvouszet was\nanother spontaneous organization corresponding to the Farasheragi, but not yet\nestablished and connected to the government in London, yeah? Then when government\nunde -- no, on all these groups found the table to talk -- not to talk, this -- this was not a\npolitic, yes, but to establish the action, yes. And say, for example, that there must be only\none organization, yes? So therefore, we were part of the Armia Krajowa. The Akar,\nHome Army.",
        "Q: But you weren\u2019t 18.",
        "A: Yes -- no, no. At the very beginning -- the very beginning, I was 15 - 16 - 17. But, I will\ntell you that we -- we made a very professional job. First of all spying. Collection of the\ninformation of the German army movement. Collection of the information of the location\nof the army -- German army, storages, and so on. I had -- besides, there was like another\nvery intelligent sabotage. You see, Germany used such a slogan, All redare meesen rollen\nfeerdon zeke. Always have to roll for the victory. So they give us a signal that we have to\ndo something, that this raider -- that this will -- will not roll. And there was a very small,\nvery nice sabotage, which was easy to do by us -- for us. To see -- to pour the sand into\nthe bearing of the wheels. So every person --",

Not in \u201939, not in \u201940. This was a little bit later. Because 1 --\nyou -- ee -- I remember that in it -- when I was traveling to Slominiki, during the\noccupation, in the very beginning of [indecipherable], it was almost like nothing\nhappened. You follow me? They suffer in the same way like any Polish people, yes. But\nthen, yes came, yeah, take it away to Krakow ghetto, or somewhere, yes? Or kill them in\nthis place, yes? And [indecipherable] this is the -- here, w -- this order, you know, was\nprobably, when you are starting to -- to re -- to look at these documents, this was 1n co --\ncooperation with the Soviet Union.

It 1 -- 1t is nothing happened to me, but his\nfather and my -- my grandfather -- no, and -- what does this say, I said not the\ngrandfather, he was a godfather, yes. He was when the freedom in the first day of so-\ncalled freedom in 1945, he was arrested by the ent over there, and he went for a few years\nin the gulags in Donbas. When he came back, big man, he was -- weighed 40 pound -- 40\nkilos, yes? So he was skin, and this. And he came, he was at least to die here. Yeah. But\nthis is -- what I am saying, another part, because this is after \u201945.",
        "Q: Right. At this point where is your brother? Do you know?",
        "A: Uh-huh. Of course you know that my -- my brother, you see, besides of the certain -- the\nproblem of the family problem, he was at this age, yes, that he tried to do something on\nhis own, yes. He -- he -- I was dependent on my -- my parent\u2019s care, of course that I\nwork, as a worker somewhere, to earn a little bit money. And my -- my -- my son -- or\nmy son, my brother, yes. He started to work somewhere in the certain company who\nbuild something in -- what was the bwonia? Some place they build some roads and\nsomething like that.",
        "Q: He came back to Warsaw?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. He Warsaw. And then in -- of course it -- 1 -- 1 -- y -- y -- you -- you can -- of\ncourse he was in the conspiracy, university, he studied. In the very beginning he now --\nyou see, because he -- he left home -- home was always home for every [indecipherable]\nyes? If he had a idea ha -- I was to do something, yes? He went, and he tried to earn some\nmoney, yes. But generally our home was base for us -- for us. And in spite of, I would\nsay, somebody at the age of 26 or something like that, they should be independent. But\nthis was a very special time, yes, that -- that his profession was very good, in the\npeaceful, when he was working in [indecipherable] army, where you have the\n[indecipherable] in -- 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- during the war. So there was a -- the -- we tried to\naccomplished our I-life almost day by day. You see, y -- I say, when I started to work\nsomewhere, yes, that I have [indecipherable] work for half year, yes. And I earn some\nmoney, yes, to help the parents. And then, you see, at that moment, this is the case, which\nis worse to -- to lie about it, how a empty place, when the Jewish people were eliminated\nin the life of Polish peop -- of Poland, in this vacuum place, th -- another people entered.\nAnd they started to make a business, yes, a business, make a life what since thousands of\nyears, yes, Jewish people did all over the world. In some way, this was -- call it\nopportunity, i-it was a empty place. Suddenly, from -- from the town of Slominiki, 3000\npeople vanished. We -- this was not action of the Polish people. They were taken away by\nthe German according to this Final Solution, yeah. Of course, that -- what is here the\n[indecipherable] now I will -- I am antery with something. You see, people always\nidentified the same by allegiance. Majority of the Jewish people in Poland were Orthodox\nJewish people. Very -- they established they life in the Orthodox way. You can see, yeah?\nHow? Black suit, a special hat, the -- this now, what is this, paysa -- paysak -- th-the --\nthe air -- hairs, yes, are long. They -- they were -- even they will try to hide, they were\nalways recognized by Germans. You follow me? Now, in the very beginning there was\nsome promises given to him. Oh, we are sending you to another establishment, and so on.\nAnd now I am coming to the very, very special situation, and we -- our family, and\nJewish people. In our home, in home that was base of our family -- this was a nine\napartment house, there was living a couple, Mr. Majinski, Rudolf Majenski e Stefania\nMayinska, that was known for my parents. Later I was informed by father, because he was\na great conspirator, I didn\u2019t know that they were Jews. I -- I knew only when something\nhappened, very dramatic. My father knew it. Now, who was my father? I tel -- I told you,\nmy brother was in organization Armia Krajowa, I was in organization Shara Faragi\nbayana Krajowa. My sister, one younger sister was in Armia Krajowa. The older sister,\nshe started to be married, so forget it. No, Mother was not, but Father was, and I didn\u2019t\nknow. But officially, yes, he was in organization so-called Zhigotta. Where did you hear\nsomething like that? Zhigotta was a selected -- is not military organization. The purpose\nof -- existence of this organization was to recognize potential enemy of the Polish people\nin this territory, and protect the people who need the protection in this te-territory. And\nfather -- because my father was a previous policeman, he had a contact with the Polish\nprecinct, because during the war there was a German police, and there was also called a --\na -- another pol -- police which cooperate with German. Yes, big name cooperate. In any\ncountry you have to have a police, so it\u2019s better to have the police -- Polish police than\nGerman police, yes. So this -- in this policemen, there were people and people. Y- You\nfollow me, they were -- because if somebody\u2019s in the power, and he want to do this, and\nthis the war time, fine, I -- I\u2019m a god, yes. So he used the power for the wrong purposes.\nSo my father had the, in this precinct, a very -- policeman who were very sure like he\nPolish, yes. I can tell you that my first shooting with the gun was -- but shooting only for\nexercise, yes, was I used the gun of the policeman, who gave us ammunition, and he go\nand try to shoot, yeah. So there. And my father was in contact. So through these people,\nhe knew a lot of the different things that will happen and so on. So first Majinski, yes?\nSunday, there came a message from the police precinct, Neho, Majinski sa -- are the --\nthe conspirator. Next day there will be Gestapo to take them away. Now, you realize this\nfargit, to be involve, if -- if you will prove it, Gestapo will prove it, yes, that you are\nhiding these people, physically, yes. Now, say for example that somebody has a hidden\nplace. Fine, at the moment if such a case happen, this family who try to hide these people,\nbang, bang, bang in spot. In this case, not -- my father was a owner of this home, so in\nsome way again, this police -- because the -- the police shoo the duties, yes? So my father\nget a message, warned them to get away, because they will be destroyed. And in some\nway this policeman from the precinct presented this case maybe to Gestapo maybe in\nsuch a way that may be presented the Marchaj, Neho is a -- is a owner of this house, and\nlook at this, this pi -- yes. They didn\u2019t know. That simple. He and she, they were Jewish,\ndefinitely, but I didn\u2019t know -- they are Mrs. -- Miss -- Mrs. Majinska, Stephania was the\nchairman of the very ca -- very known in Poland charity organization for the poor people.\nThe Mr. Mayjinsky, Rudolf was a -- a doctor, at the age at the time about 70. And you see\nth -- you -- you have to know that there were cases that some Jewish people met and\nother Jewish people who were involved in something, and he just send the message, oh,\nyou are this, here, and bang -- zekonds perasi, a-and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: What did your father say that made -- to the police, that made the Gestapo --",
        "A: It means that the message came to the -- from Gestapo to police precinct to prepare\naction. But by this bypass to Neho Marchaj came from this policeman who knew, get the\nmessage from Gestapo that they will be taken away. So now, ma -- Marchaj, as I\nmentioned to you, he was involved to -- to search for such information, so fora -- my\nfather, police precinct was a source of information, too. Of course h-he had averiman\ninformation -- I don\u2019t know even, you know, I -- how broad knowledge of my father was.\nSo he -- they were taken away at once. My father found the place. They were taken away\nabout six, seven blocks in the same area, in south Katinpatou, and vanished, yes. The --\nthe pr -- the wa -- the -- the -- the -- the table in kitchen was arranged in such a way that\nthese people left this place almost half an hour ago, yes? It was a still hot water, this and\nso on. And really, next day came, and they found empty, empty, empty room. But of\ncourse, all -- me, father, me -- mother not, but me, brother and sister, the -- we get out\nfrom this, no -- because we didn\u2019t know what -- what will happen, yeah?",
        "Q: Your father hid them?",
        "A: Yes, he arranged the hiding place.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Yes, so -- and they survived. You know, they survived later, they -- they -- they found\nson of the Majinsky, Stanislau Majinsky and Hilda Mayinsky, they were living in\nSaskacampa, and they survived -- all survive. And the next day, they came back looking\nthat this camouflage, yes, that they departed was just coincidence, only maybe they will\ncome back. They came back, the Gestapo, and found the apartment in the same way. So\nthey get the knows, yes, they know -- they knew at the time, yes, that they get out, yes.\nAnd at that moment, why my father was badly beaten by the -- by this German -- by\nGestapo, and they throw him into the basement. And believe me or not, Stanislau\nMayjinsky, who was the witness, who came the same day when Gestapo come back again,\nhe came to ask father about something, but he ran to the different apartment. My father\nwas beaten and that\u2019s it. Now, what\u2019s happen only, and this is --",
        "Q: Were you there when your father was beaten?",
        "A: Beaten, yeah. Only f-from this, you know, from this hatred, you know, that somebody\u2019s\nescaped, they have no proof in some way, maybe as I mentioned to you, maybe in some\nway Gestapo was involved by somebody from this precinct. Not mar -- Marchaj, he\u2019s a\nowner, and they make it a lot of maybe some movement, Majinsky? They are Jewish?\nYou follow, they -- you can do something if you ca -- if you -- if you want to do\nsomething. So happily, yes, happily, it was not very big damage to our family, yes? Now,\nanother story of action of my father. He had a friend. I don\u2019t remember now his name, but\n-- first name, but I remember very good name, Sigoua, who was the machinist of the first\nclass machinist before the war, and first class machinist either are leading the -- in the\nexpress train, or the freight train. The -- the -- to -- to -- to -- to be machinist of the\nexpress train, obviously has to be responsible man. In same way, if you are making a\ntransport of the freight train, very long, loaded and so on, a first class machinist has to be.\nOne day, and I was witness at that time, he came to our house, and very moved, and he\nsay, \u201c\u201cNeho, I was in the [indecipherable].\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d \u201cI delivered the transport\nof people to Birkenau, and do you know, I didn\u2019t know that I am going there, because I,\u201d\n-- at that moment very rare, was -- 1s -- was not yet very public, yes? Maybe such a case\nis like Sigoua case. Send the message to the world. And he said to my father, \u201cThese\npeople went for dead, to be killed. And I saw it by my own eyes. I was inside a delivery\ntrain to the -- to the oven.\u201d And he described [indecipherable] and say, \u201cI cannot drive\nnow, unless I will do something.\u201d And he asked my father. \u201cPlease, I want to change my\nname, I want to have the document for me and my family. I want to have a place on the\nnext train, but not with the people, but some military train I will derail.\u201d And that\u2019s\n[indecipherable] he got a new document, and his name was, I remember Bojenski, they\nchanged name to Bojenski. He left home, took family, and vanished. And as he said, with\nthe transport of the military train to the east, with his -- and for this man was prepare the\nsame, yes? And he derail in this special place, he know what to do, how to derail the\ntrain, yes? You know, at the certain point where it was a curvature, and downhill, yes, he\njust put the full fa -- power, and jumped from the train, and the train [indecipherable].\nAnd this is the history [indecipherable]. So this is what I\u2019m saying.",
        "Q: Did your father -- when did your father tell you that story?",
        "A: This was just after.",
        "Q: After.",
        "A: After. But I was the witness when he was talking about this -- Birkenau.",
        "Q: Oh, you heard that?",
        "A: Yes. When he came to my father, I was present. When he was talking about where he\nwas, and what he did. Because he was -- he suddenly feel guilty, but he didn\u2019t -- he -- he\nnever knew, he got a destination point this and this and that\u2019s it. They -- they not inform\n[indecipherable] Mr. Sigoua you are taking the train with [indecipherable] to be -- Jewish\npeople to be killed, no. So this was a -- two occurrences where I know. I can tell you only\nanother, that when my father died --",
        "Q: Just one second. When you heard him tell that story --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- about going to Birkenau, what were your thoughts?",
        "A: Oh, boy. You see, this was a nightmare for everybody. This was a nightmare. You see, 1 -\n- especially, you see, I have no thoughts or feeling at that time, but you know, later I was,\nafter the war, one of the first visit to the south when I was again visiting my parents, yes,\nthe -- say, godfather, yes. I visited the -- the Auschwins.",
        "Q: Auschwitz?",
        "A: Auschwitz -- Auschwitz. I visited almost -- I can\u2019t -- no, I don\u2019t want to be cruel -- not\ncruel, but to hurt somebody by telling. It was almost hot, because this was in -- in -- I was\nthere in May after the war. So, \u201945 May. I never was yet at the time in Stutthof when I\nwas a few times ish -- in -- in Birkenau. Oh, Birkenau was absolutely terrible, especially\nwhen -- if you are visiting Birkenau, or Auschwitz, or if somebody is making the picture,\nmovie, it\u2019s just impossible. You have to smell this. You have to -- to touch this mad --\nthis -- this -- everything. But y-you see, that\u2019s a -- and what -- what is our reason 1s just to\navoid this, but not by the remembers. Of course we remember, but to do something that --\nthat people will make a conclusion frim remembrance.",
        "Q: But when you heard that story, did you s -- did you and your father exchange any\nthoughts, was there -- did you know before you heard that story that exactly that was\nhappening?",
        "A: Do you know -- I will tell you something, what\u2019s a -- what was the occupation? You are a\nsubject of the German power, not a object that you can do something in reality. You were\nonly a hunted animal. Do you realize how many places is in the Warsaw where 40 people\nin spot were shot? Dra -- men remember, yes, a special plaque built into the wall. Is over\n600. This is only the every day -- daily bread, I can tell you. So this was not a sensation\nfor us at that moment. This was normal, yes? You are -- you were -- you left home going\nto the town, yes, and suddenly say, very usually -- usually this was the place, your train\nentered the bridge, and suddenly -- this was always the point where you are crossing a\ndangerous line, yes? Because very many times, you have to go to the bridge because you\nhave to go from here there. But one end, and under, then suddenly you see the crost by\nthe -- by the police German, yes? And then trains stop and they are coming to the -- get\nout, you, you, you, you, this way, please, this way, yes? There were special -- we -- we\ncall it buda, vudit, yes, a keester, a case, or I don\u2019t know how to translate swo -- the word\nbuda. And they load it, and usually these people who were in such a car, never come\nback. Now, during the war, lo -- you have to be in some way -- you have to use the\nauthorities of German, and therefore I -- I will mention for you who I was.",
        "Q: Stop you right there, cause I feel like we\u2019re getting ready to tell a story, and -- yeah. So\nwe'll come back on that.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",

Of course, in our organization, yes, we were divided in the\ntroops, yes, so they say we -- we call it a gathering, it\u2019s very hard to translate, grupavania.\nThat\u2019s a very big unit, grupavania grove, yes? What does it mean grove? Is a part of the\ntown, grove, and this was a grupavania. And this grupavania, this group of certain part of\nthe town was divided in the section, or -- boy, oh boy. Platoons, yes, 1s better, yes? And\neach of these platoon have the number, and who knew? Who is in the -- or leader of the\ncertain platoon? It was known to the greater ka -- hierarchy, yes? Probably even in\nLondon archives was only all -- not archives, in London possession was known, I\u2019m\nguessing only, that they knew ours grupavania grow to even in here, in grove grupavania,\nthere was a leader of this, and he knew who is under him. But in general, yes, how is\nrelation, like say for example, as grupavania grove to -- to the commandant of the Armia\nKrajowa. Like Groetravetski, yes, General Groetravetski, he was captured, and -- and he\nwas hold in the Mauthausen for a very long time. But anyway, he was killed. Then it was\n-- after him was General Burkomarosky. So this was known for very few people, who is\nthis man, and what is his name? I didn\u2019t know -- I knew -- I know now, after the war,\nwho was my -- or when -- when we started the open fight during the Warsaw uprising,\nno, it wa [indecipherable] it was everything open, yes? Because there was a meeting of\nthe -- of the leadership, and they knew this, this, this, and at the moment when they knew\nwhat\u2019s the name, inu, and everything. Family name. But during the occupation I can tell\nyou that I know rish my -- my leader of this platoon, I knew who is his -- and of course, I\nknow him. I know who is the -- how say, the second in row, yes. His pseudo name was\nHinshaw, and then ma -- it was my friends. Friends who are the member of the platoon.\nAnd there was as has -- seven -- seven, and everybody has a pseudo, yes, and we know\neach other. Between us there was no problem, yes. It was a -- I know that he is in my\ntroop, and of course that he is my soldier, yes. And at that moment, of course, sometimes,\nwe exercise, of course, some youth -- youthful stupidity, I can sell you, that we tried to\nprove how we are very resistance against the pain, yes? We could say, [indecipherable]\nyou Gestapo will touch you, and they will be investigated, and you will be beaten and so\non. Did you say who is next to you, and so on, and so on. So I remember that -- of course,\nas I said, stupidity, because later, when I was really in prison, I don\u2019t -- I can tell you,\nprison in the Communist Poland, and I was investigated for a very long time, I didn\u2019t\nknow myself. I didn\u2019t know myself, camut -- how much I can stand. So, you see, what we\ndid, we sometimes, to prove it that I was such a resistance to pain, we -- we --\ndistinguished the cigarettes on the hand, without crying, yes. You know, very naive. But\nwe did it, this was the -- no, I -- I call it this is stupidity because -- because the facts\nwhere it was, you were in the hand of the oppressors, yes. At that moment is the best way\nto die as fast as possible.",
        "Q: How did you know these boys? Had you known these boys before?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. This was the boys from -- I can say, our block, yes. The same -- the same\nterritory, yes, Saskacampa. And say all of my friends in the -- in the block, three, four\nblocks area. Of course that this is the -- and in these four blocks there was a few platoons.\nYou see, everybody different. And anyway, we knew because we were in same block.\nAnd I can tell you that say now we are entering -- we are approaching to the -- to the\nWarsaw uprising. So I was attached to the platoon, I -- I have to -- to check it exactly,\nyou see, but later I will give you a proper -- proper number. We are assigned to the\ncertain targets for the Warsaw uprising. Fortunate then -- not fortunately, our platoon --\nfew of them, too, because th -- we -- we were not only we, because there was another.\nOur goal was too attack the -- the building -- school building, which was the quarter of\nthe SS regiment. You have an imagination that, you know, even [indecipherable]\napproaching the day, D-day, these are the -- the first of the August, when we started the\nWarsaw uprising, but you want to touch this problem now, or you want to --",
        "Q: Not -- not quite. I\u2019d li -- I have a few more --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- organizational questions, but I -- but -- but I do want to know that. If you could, just\nthink back and tell us -- give us an example, how would you be told about a meeting, and\nthen how would you be given an assignment, and then how would you do it? If you could\nsort of walk us through that. Any example.",
        "A: You say it, I\u2019m trying to the -- you see, this is such a -- such a difficult problem. See, I --\nI will tell you that I participated as a courier, yes -- not a courier, carrier, carrier of the\nbulletin informatseeni. This was used like il-illegal publication which were printed, I\ndon\u2019t know where. What I know, that this assignment came from my platoon leader, yes?\nI mean, he say, \u201cBoy, such and such a day, at this and this time, you are going to the\nstreet -- Stanislau Powgas Street. There, in the certain point, there will be a package. You\nwill take this package, and you will carry this package to the -- to the center of the town.\u201d\nI -- remember which is forbidden, it was -- but then not to remember, but -- sorry is this\n-- you cannot have a [indecipherable] and you cannot stop to remember certain fact. So\nwileeta Hosha Street, and we stare ar -- to the certain point, there will be a box, you put\ninto the box, and that\u2019s that.",
        "Q: And -- and when --",
        "A: Yeah. I did it, period. Yeah, now, another story. I -- I know because this is related to my\ncourier activity. About how we are e -- how we -- we will use the authorities German, as\na protection. So I work for a few months or half year. I have this document\n[indecipherable] but I don\u2019t remember now that I was a worker in the manufacturer of the\nelectrical batteries, yes? Which were produced for the public, yes. Of course, if this such\nac -- such a situation it would be worth to make a sabotage, yes, I would be used. Say,\nfor example, to put something into the mixture of the battery, to make this battery work\nless after short time, yeah? But anyway, I -- I stop to work this, because I found a better\nsolution for me, and a protection that I was -- it was so cold luft shutz heirbdidst. I am\nsaying in German. It means that the LHD. And this was in translation a service for the --\nfor the fire department help. The front start to approach Warsaw, so Warsaw was faced it\nwill be bombed, we will have the fires, and so on. So German authorities organized of\ncourse in certain way, the fire department, yes, to make this fire department better\nworking. To build the retention in vessels, 1 - dig in the wall, in the earth, to collect the\nwater for -- to -- for the fire extinguishing. And this service, according to my morality, I\ncan say -- not only morality, but my -- my understanding that my work is not a work that\nwill support German military activity. Because this what we have, what built, 1t was for\nthe protection of the civilian people in Warsaw, yes. And it was a good protection for the\n-- another authorities of German, because it had a s -- let\u2019s say certain how to say\ndocuments, yes? That such and such person is working in department of the -- say fire\ndepartment in Herakoska traga, yes? Will be s-stamp with the -- with the say vrona, say\nthe German eagle, you know, this hakencroitz? And in the case of the wapanka --\nwapanka, that\u2019s was very popular way hunting for the people, as I mentioned yes, that\nthere\u2019s a bridge, they stop here, they stop [indecipherable] and get out, yes? And they\nyou, you, you. And that moment, say, for example, this was a document that I could show\nto the Germans, yes, that I am loyal to them, I\u2019m working for the fire department, which\nis a -- I don\u2019t want to use this America -- American expression, a work [indecipherable]\nfor -- my work was [indecipherable] but it was working, by even this was not working so\ngood, because this German who a issue as this special document, they said, \u201cBut if you\nwill be in the wapanka,\u201d you know, in this stoppage and selection, \u201cin the very beginning,\ndon\u2019t show to the authorities, because could happen,\u201d [makes tearing sound] \u201c\u2018and you are\nnothing. So, hold 1t when you will go to -- for the investigation, at that moment, take it.\nAnd it is possible, they -- they told us, that if s-somebody from the febia will know that\nyou were captured, send a message to the fire department, and fire department will know\nwhat to do.\u201d You see, there was in some way, between the Polish people, and even with\nthe German, because who was this fire -- fire fighter from the German side? He was\nanother professional firefighter. He was not there from Gestapo, he was not from\n[indecipherable], he was professional firefighter, to fight the fire. So they know what to\ndo, yes? And at that moment, these authorities will go to the German Gestapo, or\nwhoever is, this and will reclaim you, unless you are not carrying at the moment weapon,\nand -- and you are -- you are subject to another activity of the -- of the Gestapo. So this\nwas say where I participate, in ahardai elijli to protect myself. Now -- now what was the\nsi -- very frightening situation? My father was a conspirator, so -- and I was carrier of the\n-- of the certain technical documentation or information, or so-called publication. And I\nwas neglecting a lot of safety factors. So when I have a package, which I don\u2019t have to\ndeliver, strictly from point A to point B, but sometimes I get it, for the distribution\nbetween my friends, yes, in Klaus, and I have to keep it because I -- I couldn\u2019t take it and\n-- and go, no. So I -- I put in different places, yes? I hide it in different places, and I -- I --\nI keep it for one, two, three days. My brother was arrested by the Germans, and he was in\nterrible trouble, yes? On the basis of the certain -- not a military activity, because he was\na soldier of the army -- Home Army, but for the -- to earn some money, he was involved\nin certain activity -- I can tell you, simple. The alcohol distribution, or production of the\nillegal alcohol, yes? This was against the German law, but not military law. And my\nbrother enter a big problem of this, and he was taken by the German authorities to explain\nhis activity, because he was, according to the German law, he was a parasite in this\nsociety. Yes he had to go for the so-called forcible work. He went to the concentration\ncamp, could be sent. But now, how the sociality -- sociality, yes? No. What is this na --\nname in -- very famous person?",
        "Q: Oh, celebrity.",
        "A: Celebrity. He was in -- in -- in Gestapo hand, first, at the very beginning. And there was a\nvery famous, in Poland, sportsman, as I mentioned few hours ago, that train us. It was\nAloukelski and Gerouto. Gerouto was the decathlon, and Aloukelski was the javelin\nthrower, and jumper, and so on. And both were Olympian. And, believe it or not, even\nGestapo recognized an Olympian, because he was Olympian in Berlin. And believe or\nnot, he went to this certain ranking officer of Gestapo, Mr. Gerouto Rito, and he say fine,\nI -- maybe I can help him, yes? It was a very big risk, yes, because he was a Polish, but\nhe has all these documents, and so on, the Olympiada in -- in Berlin, and he went into the\njaw of the beast to -- to try to do something in, and he did it. He recognize him, okay, ma\n-- yavolt, in German, fine. But he\u2019s a very bad guy, he\u2019s a parasite. He will go for the\nforcible work. Okay, and we know, yes, perhaps he will be transferred from this prison to\nthat prison. But this other prison was only the holding place, yes? And they were German\nbut not Gestapo. And there, if somebody has again connection between the people -- the\npeople, yes? You can pay the bribery, and he gets free. And this happen. And my brother\nget out from there. Okay, so one -- one case is okay, but now what to do with this\nbrother? He has to have some -- some documents, yes. So there was a [indecipherable]\nokay, so you know, I was in the -- 1-1n the fire department, so just what, I have to do this\nfor you, and you will be a firefighter, and you will have this document, that minimum\nthat you have to have, you know. Because you cannot be -- survive the occupation doing\nnothing, or -- you see, because this is what the first act where you were stopped by the --\nby the German, yes, documents. You are somebody or not, working or not working,\nuseful or not useful. Why? Because they need only to have the hostages, or something. So\nif you have this, fine, you are in some way prepared. Now, how this related? Of course\nthat this is a meaningless situation, but I\u2019m saying how life was in Poland. I put the -- this\ncertain documents for the distribution in some place that my father found it. And this was\nforbidden for me. Oh, reprimand terrible, yeah, if I can find, Gestapo will find, yes? And\nhe was so nervous and preoccupy of this what I did, that he forgot that he has to go with\nmy brother to the fire department chapter of the German police. And in his passion, he\nput this -- this -- this document that I was hiding, put into the pocket and went -- at the\nmoment brother [indecipherable] and now, let\u2019s go, we are going. And they went into the\n-- what I say? The jaw of the beast. And my brother -- that\u2019s the relation of my brother.\nBut they -- they passed some gates, and so on, and he\u2019s going somewhere from the fire\ndepartment, and then he was sit down, and sitting, and something hit, and my brother\nlook into the face of -- of my father, and if he\u2019s paralyzed, almost. He found that he has in\nthe pocket something that is that. But quietly he went somewhere when this -- they were\napproaching of this interview, he put into the basket, garbage basket this, ended out. Of\ncourse that means this -- in this document there was absolutely nothing that related to the\nperson, and so on. But this was on the [indecipherable] action of the weapon, or\nsomething, how to operate or some -- something. So I\u2019m saying that\u2019s the -- this is the --\nsuch a -- traps or occurrences can happen. M -- and of course, as I say, this is a\nmeaningless, this has nothing to do with [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No, but it\u2019s telling. It\u2019s a telling detail.",
        "A: Telling the -- telling you -- telling you that how is it, yes? You could be in very big\ntrouble. And how to avoid the trouble, and so on. Not that\u2019s -- but this is the way how\noccupation was day by day, that we survived this occupation day by day. Now, e -- e -- e\n-- you See we are very close to sa -- execution. I knew that somebody will be shot. Even\nme. You see, our dream of everybody of us was to have a weapon, enough to have a\nparabellum, or to have some FN nine millimeter, or maybe who dreamed to have a\nmachine gun? How to find it? How to do this [indecipherable]. In Saskacampa, this was a\npart of -- of the town that was at the Vistula River shore. And along this Vistula River\nshore, some very common soldier with the shvesta and -- and other service men and\nwomen -- service women, make a walk along the shore, usually afternoon, peaceful\nsituation. So we -- this we did what the -- where is the target to [indecipherable] the from\nthe [indecipherable]. So we knew exactly, you know, that we were -- there was our\nterritory, you know? So, first was the scout, yes? What he has? Oh, he has a parabellum.\nFine. Besides what? And then on the bicycles, bikes, yes, we drove there. I am talking\nabout -- because I didn\u2019t know this, yes, but I was very much involved in -- in such\naction. As a -- as a security and so on. But the [indecipherable] in particular, and then\nusually this was a very easy gun, yeah, take it out, and he was very happy to be alive,\nyes? And get out. But one case was very different. [indecipherable] was -- result was I\nwasn\u2019t this -- now, I am not saying that -- that persecute myself, but for the re-really fact,\nbut because I was in some way still responsible for this, because I -- I participate many\ntimes in such a [indecipherable] is going a officer, what he has? FN7 millimeter\n[indecipherable]. Ah, dream. Seven, it was very small, and very handy. Okay, who is\nwith him? A shvester. Okay. So they drove it, they stop at him, they pull the gun, and this\nofficer at that moment pulled the hand from the pocket of the -- with the hand -- handgun\nin this, what was not in the holster, yes, but he took it from there. What he want to do\nwith this, maybe he want to give it up -- up. It doesn\u2019t matter for at this my friend who s -\n- was standing in there on front of him, he just pulled the trigger, because he didn\u2019t know\nwhat he will do. This shvester panics, and with the bare hand, jump on the -- another\nfriend. Same story, just he pulled the trigger, and it -- it was holding gun to -- to shoot,\nand he killed this shvester of the Red Cross, and this officer was the medical doctor. And\nboth die.",
        "Q: He killed them both?",
        "A: Yeah. In four days, in this place, they brought the 40 people, and shot to death, as the\nreparation. Now, few days later, I -- my father called me. He -- I -- I didn\u2019t told him\nanything, and he, \u201cTadeusz, tell different -- I am telling you, and you have to tell all\nthese.\u201d And he\u2019s mentioning by name this, this, this, this, this. \u201cIf this what -- will occur\nonce again, you and all your friends, you will be executed, because your action was\nabsolutely not accepted by the authorities, and you found the result what\u2019s happened in\nthis place. This is not a way that you will fight.\u201d We get the warning, because --",
        "Q: This was a warning from your own command?",
        "A: My -- our command. But my father knew it. He knew it, and everything. And he said,\n\u201cThis 1s not your action. When will be needed weapon, you will get it.\u201d And, I will tell\nyou --",
        "Q: Because you were trying to just get weapons on your own?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And it wasn\u2019t something that was authorized?",
        "A: No, this was not assign -- yeah, that\u2019s was our private -- private action. And this action\ncost too many lives. Of course, as a explanation, as a -- some -- to throw out this guilt,\nyes, I will say, anyway, these people will be killed. You follow me? Because the\nhostages, for the killing, were permarently delivered anyway. So -- but I\u2019m just telling\nyou that you -- you will understand in no other way we have t-to do. So there was a\nlegality, and there was something illegal. Like, for example, there was a execution, yes,\nyes, there was a legal execution, yes, that I -- what -- what I -- as I mentioned t-to you --\nyour -- my father was involve to select the people for protection, or select the people to\nbe eliminated. And one of such elimination I knew that will be done. But again, it was\nsomething done that wo -- shouldn\u2019t be, yes? Because it was a history of the yacht arina.\nIt was on the Vistula River. And this yacht arina has on the board, a radio station. And in\nthe marina, when this yacht was anchored, was in charge of -- of the marina was Gulka,\nhis name was Gulka, and it was, without any doubt, yes, known and investigated that he\nis a confident of the Gestapo, and -- and he is guilty the dra -- death of the five boys that\nwere operating the radio station on this yacht, and Gestapo came and they were killed.\nOne of them jumped into the Vistula River and vanished. And he survived. And the --\nafter many months of investigation, it was confirmation, and there was given by\nauthorities, acceptance of execution Mr. Gulka. And I knew it. And believe me, I met him\nevery day, many times I was on this marina for another reason, because I have a --\nanothers -- my small boat, and now a man who was shooting, I knew him very well,\nbecause he give me this message. \u201cTadeusz, if you have something, you have to finish the\n-- the -- some -- if you have some problems with Gulka or you -- the -- yes -- you -- he\nwill be killed.\u201d And he came. He executed this Gulka. The dog, who 1n defend of his\nmaster jump on this guy, he killed his dog. But this was, in some way, this is the\ncharacters, yes? Character of the people. He was so full of hate, yes, that he did\nsomething what he shouldn\u2019t do, yes? He went home, and he kill his wife and child in the\ncreek. So you see, character in character, military action, and other military action, you\nhave to recognize that there is a killing which is say, so-called legal by the military\nnorms, but in this case, this is just a simple crime. That\u2019s my opinion.",
        "Q: Can you describe any friendships you had within this platoon?",
        "A: Oh, up to -- no, up to this day, of course, of course that. First of all, with the two of them,\nI was in concentration camp. Marchashu Pariski is one, and Bogedon Palmoski 1s another\none. I -- I can tell you that Marchashu Pariski, who is a doctor, medical doctor in -- in\nWarsaw, and Bogedon Palmosk1 is a architect. He was here in America. And he survive.\nAnd I can tell you that Matchie, I just took him, grab him from the behind, I say, \u201cLet\u2019s\ngo from this camp, and go, and you will be a draftsman.\u201d Because he -- he think I don\u2019t\nknow how to make drawings. I will teach you. This is the -- on the appelleplatz in\nStutthof, when the meekis --",
        "Q: Right. We\u2019re going to get to that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So another [indecipherable], unfortunately he was killed in accident by car. Zigmund\nPaloalouk, very famous name from Bizantium, Paloalouk\u2019s Bizantium. He is living in\nCanada. And that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Were you at some point ever trained how to use weapons?",
        "A: I mention you -- I mention you that the first -- th-the first and the only shooting from the\ngun, it was from the police gun.",
        "Q: So you were never taken out and --",
        "A: No, no, ye-ye-yes --",
        "Q: -- taught how to shoot a gun?",
        "A: -- yes, yes. Oh, of course, that during the -- our lecturing of the weapon, yes, they were\ndelivered, a certain weapon, the -- just how to operate the machine gun, yes? So this was\nyes. It means that we were familiar how to operate, say, Meisner, Schmeitzer, or another\ngun, yes.",
        "Q: Can you describe where that would happen?",
        "A: Home, family home.",
        "Q: There\u2019d be some guns in the home?",
        "A: Yes, yes, of course they\u2019d be in hidden place. Yes, it was not on the table, yes, but they\nwere. So now, another story, this was a tragedy, yes, a finishing tragedy because at one\ntime, y -- we -- we -- we pick up the deserter of the -- of the German army, and he was\nstaying for two days in the home of my friend, Raphael Padolski, very good painter e\nAustralia. And there was a mother, father, and he. And now it\u2019s happen he get everything\n-- help from us to depart somewhere, and -- but he was captured. German -- was captured\nby German. And you -- he know where he stayed, and he brought them, and the whole\nfamily was taken away to Mauthausen. Father die, mother survive, and Raphael survive.\nAnd now another very, very strange that something happen, that you have to put your --\nyour future on judgment of the certain situation which could be a deadly. I pick up this --\nmy order for me, yes fine, go to Raphael, and take the clothes, and everything of this guy,\nthis ch -- this deserter. So I took this everything with me, and instead to go home, I went\nfor my service time into the special place of this LHD, the fire department location,\nwhich was located in Saskacampa. And I took this package, and I put in someplace in this\n-- in this building, a building there was a -- a-abandoned villa by a very rich family in\nSaskacampa, and there was a -- our station. And fine, because okay, tomorrow morning I\nwill -- I will take it [indecipherable] for hiding, yes? I went to the bed, you know, the\nbank bed, yes, because you have to stay -- service was to stay for the night. I -- I -- I hear\nthe whisper, yes? People in this room are whispering, and talking [inaudible]. You see\nthat something is -- something happened, and then I hear you, ask Tadeusz, ask Tadeusz.\nOh, they found it. If you will believing this, there was a -- 40 person in this room, big,\nhuge hall. And now -- and I -- I -- I know this guys, this man quite -- you know, with the\ngood character, some alcoholics, some this, you know, because there was a -- the\nselection of these people, not -- not like me, there was the -- a -- like a coincident that\nthey was there. And now I have to answer the question. I have to say, yes, that\u2019s my\n[indecipherable] opened my future to the absolutely unknown person. And I said, \u201cYes,\nthat\u2019s mine.\u201d So I have heard only very bad expression in Polish language, untransla --\nuntranslatable, \u201cGet out from here.\u201d And that\u2019s it. And blah, blah, blah. So I took it that,\nand I go home, and hide it, and nothing happen.",
        "Q: Did that mean that you never went back to your job?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: No, nothing happened. I came next day after they ansa. So, you see, this was a very\ndifficult time in Poland, that where somebody was a Polish, very rare was a canalya, you\nknow, was a -- a bad man. In spite of fact that I -- I -- I can tell you, that many of them\nwere simple pigs, almost.",
        "Q: But did Poles inform on other Poles?",
        "A: Oh yes, solidarity was. And it was very easy to distinguish what the [indecipherable |\nsaying this was the period of time where you recognize the enemy, because this enemy, it\nwas not the Polish. But this is another period of my time when I was in Communist\nPoland, and I was [indecipherable] Poland -- Polish.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- Poles were supporting other Poles?",

        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: An unknown person, [indecipherable] I course, but I -- I took a good -- good point, yes,\nimmediate. Because you see, if I will -- 1f I would do a different action, and I will say, no,\nthat\u2019s not mine, you see what will happen, some provocation, maybe we will have to send\nthe message to the -- to the police, German, and he is finished.",
        "Q: How were you feeling in the middle of these actions? Were you afraid, ever? Some of\nthese sound very intense.",
        "A: You see, we -- we were, in the five years, yes? \u201940 - 41 - \u00b042 - \u00b043 - \u00b044 - \u201945, six years,\nyes, you are all the time aware -- very close to death. There was not normal, nothing was\nnormal. You know, y -- I -- y-you never knowed if you are going to the Warsaw, if will\nbe back. It\u2019s because you are entering a simple operation wapanka, and you a -- you are\nin trouble, terro -- very serious trouble. You see that in -- in Warsaw, there was --\nWarsaw was dying as a town day by day, execution by execution, but totally different\nstories in [indecipherable] which was a act of heroism, yes, and cost Warsaw, a town, and\n-- of a quarter million people.",
        "Q: So you felt close to death most of the time?",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you feel afraid, or what gave you the courage?",
        "A: Just life, and you have t -- you have to live. You have to -- you have to survive. Therefore\nI am saying, the sa -- the same story about -- is -- was a -- you can\u2019t compare, you know,\nthis -- the fate of the Jewish people, yes, that\u2019s a totally -- totally different. So therefore, I\nam saying, if there was a -- if there was a Warsaw uprising in ghetto, they were our\ntroops fighting for Warsaw ghetto. But this was a helpless, this was useless. You cannot\nfight es -- insane -- in the few months later, and this happened to the Warsaw. You realize\nthis fact, that it was a -- around eastern -- no, [indecipherable] holy, holy period, yes,\nEaster, yeah, I am saying good. It was a end of the ghetto. End. It was the final days\nwhere the young desperate people said fine, we have to die, die fighting. And they started\nto fight. But there was no -- no -- you say -- you see this was a very small scale, yes? If\nyou get main ghetto wipe out, yes, was done without any resistance, yes? You see, as I\nmentioned to you, there was difficulties for the Jewish people to -- to try to escape,\nbecause these routes were available, yes, but they were so different in behavior, in\neverything, that -- that they just give up, you know, like in this picture that you see s --\nwith the hand up, and I am going.",
        "Q: Did you ever observe any collaboration between the Polish underground and resistance\nand the Jewish resistance?",
        "A: Y-Y-You see, there was no collaboration in so-called ni -- call it peaceful -- peaceful, you\nknow -- there was no uprising, no. There was no. Because you see, even for us, we have\nno collaboration with the Communist resistance, yes? Even worse, we were punished, we\nwere killed by them. We -- as a potential enemy when the Soviet Union will come.\nHuman behaviors, yes, only human behaviors, yes, then -- the troops, which were close to\nghetto, and this is the certain part of the Warsaw, we were far away. They fought from\noutside into the ghetto, when there was a point of fighting, yes?",
        "Q: The Polish troops?",
        "A: Yes, Polish troop. Where there was a --",
        "Q: Your comrades?",
        "A: Yes. Very special troops, yes? They -- w -- they tried to fight. Ila -- a -- like from the --\nfrom the other side, from the backside of the Germans. But of course, this was without\nany sham. This was only act of solidarity. But same story, that for us, when we started the\nwar -- abs -- Warsaw [indecipherable] there -- help was six -- 2000 miles away, yes? Or,\nwas just behind Vistula River, yes? Soviet army. So the fly -- flies -- the planes came\nfrom the Italy, yes, or from Britain to drop the armament in the Warsaw. It was one wit --\nwitness of the one fight -- one -- one flight that was shot down. This was a in -- in my\neyesight. I -- I have the document, I know the name of these pilots, and the crew, and one\nsurvivor was found there. They -- they -- this was a act of heroism, yes, because you have\nto realize that suddenly plane flying -- I don\u2019t know, six hours from Brindisi, somewhere\nin [indecipherable] or some -- somewhere there, they are approaching the Warsaw,\nWarsaw is in flame, and he is flying over the roofs of the do -- of the -- of the houses.\nAnd he, pilot, he came this thousand miles to drop in the spot, because if he -- he can fly,\nyou know, and drop someone and get out, yes? He was going back and forth, he\nvanishing the -- in the smoke of the -- of the burning say, and -- and believe me, he did it\nso many flights, that the Germans at the gun, they knew, aha, he is going the -- we have\nit, yes? He will come from this point. And I see the one shot from the big anta -- anti-\naircraft, and hit him in the -- in the tail, and the plane went down, and exploded. I -- I\nhave the greatest -- the greatest feelings of my friendship to this pilot who did it. It was a\nsoldier\u2019s duty. You follow me? He was trained regardless if he will be killed or not. It\nwas a very, very act of heroism. No, therefore I am saying that are we [indecipherable]\nand that\u2019s just behind you Vistula River, just in the face sig -- and this happen, you know,\nthat in this troop standing in the Soviet army, at the Vistula River, they were Polish\nsoldiers, yes? And without permission of the commander of the si -- great Red Army,\nthey launch the attack, and started to cross in Vistula River, and they did it, but that\u2019s it.\nThey passed the Vistula River. They created the bridgehurt, no German heres, and it was\ncut off, and died.",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering -- we were -- we are beginning now to talk about the Warsaw uprising, so\nif you could go back a little bit before it begins and set the context. What was going on\nright before it began? You know, in the weeks or two. Did you know something was\nmaybe being planned?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: Te -- tell us a little bit about it.",
        "A: You see, there was a --",
        "Q: When it was.",
        "A: -- two -- two concepts. This was everything in July happen. June, July, August,\nSeptember, yes? This was a very crucial point.",
        "Q: The year?",
        "A: Year, \u201944. And at the -- at the certain day, I think if it was July, I get the order.\nMobilization point, go to the mobilization point. We know what to do. We have to have\nthis, this, this, this, this, and we are going to the certain place, and we are ready to go.",
        "Q: What was it?",
        "A: Go.",
        "Q: What was it that you had to have?",
        "A: You know it was that -- no, I am saying --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- you have to take the food, medicine, weapon, whatever it is, some clothes, good shoes.\nWe are leaving Warsaw. We are going outside of the walls.",
        "Q: And at that point you did have a weapon?",
        "A: Yes, of cour --",
        "Q: You had been given a weapon.",
        "A: Yes, immediate -- at that moment we are going to the second point where we will get the\nweapon. Of course that somebody of us had a private weapon, and -- and we -- it -- a\ndecision by the authorities, yes, our Home Army was that we will not fight in Warsaw.\nWe are going into the forest, and we are starting a regular partisan wa -- war. Now came\nthe politic ish. Because so -- fine, we are leaving Warsaw, and Warsaw is open, so some\nof you in -- will enter like to the old towns, yes? And we will be in the forest. And this, it\nwas political thinking, yes? So it means that there is a capital town of Poland without\nPolish authorities, yes? There will be authorities brought with the Soviet Union army.\nThis was the political issue",
        "Q: [inaudible |\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: This is September 21\u00b0, 1998, we\u2019re in Arlington, Virginia, doing an interview for the US\nHolocaust Memorial Museum. The interview is with Tadeusz Marcha}, and this is tape\nnumber five. And you were just --",
        "A: To leave the Warsaw, or not to leave the Warsaw. So, as -- as I mentioned that 1s no\ndoubt for me now, but very little I know during the time when this decision was made by\nthe authorities, if -- this I know now, but at that time I know as a soldier of the\nunderground army, Home Army, I have to go somewhere, wherever they may ask me to\ngo. And of course, the -- the -- 1t was very easy to understand that this is the only one --\none way to go, is that to go to the compinose kapushta over another part of Poland with\nthe forest, and to -- to continue the fight with the Germans in the form of parti -- partisan\naction. At that moment it was a big motion. I can say commotion in the movement of\narmy. A lot of evacuated, the authorities si -- 1 -- of German macht, German power. A --\ne-evacuation of the unnecessary departments of the army, and ha -- in -- including the --\nthis was a quite good opportunities to pick up the weapon, because a lot of soldier of the\ncooperating army with the Germans, were passing Warsaw. Hungarian, Italian, and -- and\nthey were very friendly. That means that for the food or something like that, you can --\nyou can buy carbines, machine guns, and so on. But this -- this lasted about -- aha, this is\nthe very -- maybe important to mention this was a time when there was a assassination of\nthe Hitler by -- by the -- in Volchance.",
        "Q: The -- the attempt?",
        "A: The attempt, yes. And this was a very big excitement, yes the -- oh, maybe this is the\ncrevend of the war. No, it was -- he survive, and so -- so, and then the situation was quiet.\nIn order -- and we are s -- we were ready to go in this so-called point of mobilization,\nwhich was aimed in home of my father. And --",
        "Q: The point of mobilization --",
        "A: Yes, yes --",
        "Q: -- was in your house?",
        "A: -- and because my -- ma -- my troops were very close to us, and this was a -- we had a\nquite big apartment, so okay, that\u2019s it, and this is the point. And then after a few days,\nthey -- not existing is a situation normal, yes, the way things get farther -- further. And it\npasses one month and then it came the first of August. And we get the message, yes, that\nwe are attacking -- no, first of all, no, we have to for the gathering place. There will be a -\n- our commander, and everything what is needed to perform attack on the -- on the school\nfull of the SS soldiers. It 1s exactly at five o\u2019clock, we -- we gather in the apartment of the\nshistof, his name was Soukoski, and I remember that he was a very devoted Catholics,\nChristian, and [indecipherable] the history of Poland, he was -- his name was Soukosk1,\nand he was on the family of the Soukoski who was marshal of the [indecipherable]\nNapoleon. Soukoski. He was a -- he died -- died in Egypt, in very strange -- in\ncircumstances. Alas, this is not important. History is telling that he was poisoned by\nNapoleon because he was a big enemy of a -- Napoleon, and -- and -- and he had some\nplans, who knows? Doesn\u2019t matter. We gather, and he -- and I remember when he has\nsaid -- asked us, \u201cPlease, go to the knees, and really pray to our God.\u201d Oh, boy. He use\nthis very old poem, very old poem, probably from the 10\u2122 century, when he is praying to\nthe mother of God, [speaks Polish]. I forget it. Doesn\u2019t matter. And -- and believe me,\nthis pick up us. We were lifted mora, and we just took our weapon, whatever we have,\nand we started to go. And we were passing on the way to the -- our gathering place, my\nhome. And at the door was standing my father. And he said to me, \u201cShow me what you\nhave to fight.\u201d And I had at the time my private 7FN. He gave me this [indecipherable],\n\u201cT would rather allow you to go with the bricks in the hand than with this.\u201d And he gave\nme, here is the weapon, and he gave me the parabellum nine millimeters -- shtuon\nparabellum with very long -- special edition of this, with the long barrel, and 200 pieces\nof ammunition. I said -- he was not a coward. He knew where I am going, but he didn\u2019t\nsay, \u201cTad, stay home,\u201d yes? Believe me -- probably, after my experience now, I will say\nto my son, \u201cStay home.\u201d We went and we had to approach our point where you had to\ncross a big, street, and be approaching this street. We know that they are movement of the\n-- of the armored carrier, light -- light wagon. So we have to pass this street very fast.\nAnd when we in group, in some way, we mobilize this big movement, this alarm another\npost of the German -- the German soldier, and they open fire to us. Believe me, this was a\n-- a-- so frightening that never in my life experienced something. Because my friends\nwere in the first line and were jumping to the housing. I was somewhere in the middle,\nand I had to run in the gun\u2019s fire. But I couldn\u2019t, so I dropped into the tarfofal field --\npotato field, and in this field, yes, th-this shooter, yes, they knew that I am there because I\nwas there [indecipherable]. And you have no imagination what does it mean when --\nwhen the shooting is of the bullets is whizzling, yes, above your hand -- head, and you\ncan -- you hear the shots, and -- and bullet sounds, and you can see the potatoes cut. It\nwas -- it was a -- it was just unbelievable. Yes, it was. And we were soldier that we never\nshoot to the people, to the -- another soldier. And we didn\u2019t wa -- we didn\u2019t were -- no,\nwe went -- we were not in the real fight. Young chicken. So at last -- no, I found from\nbravery that I say no, now I am jumping, yes? I jump [indecipherable] nice, and I -- I see\nthe -- I saw the -- the red brick\u2019s powder, yes, in front of me, because he shoot at the edge\nof the house, knowing that I will pass this point. And I pass, and nothing happen to me.\nAnd believe me, my first -- first was where I can have a droplets of water. My -- m -- I\u2019m\n-- I\u2019m telling only to emphasize the fact that everybody could have the same thing. Don\u2019t\ntelling me that you can be brave like -- like hero. No, the organs, your body will react in\nsome way -- maybe my body. I went into the appletel. They are still shooting, but a little\nbit far away. But it is [indecipherable] as you think, my first will was to have an apple\nand juice. And I climb on this -- on -- on this thing. I take the apple, bite it, and I was in\nseventh heaven. And at that moment, of course, I became right [indecipherable] yes, a\nstory of bravery, Marchaj, who in spite of the fire, he climbed the tree. That\u2019s was a very\nbravery man. So no, no, it was not me, not here. It doesn\u2019t matter now. Time -- and when\nI get the sip of the juice, I went down in -- into the building where we have to -- supposed\nto be. And then was I -- we found the three guys, very professional tadif. The three\nbrothers Rainishevski. Three brothers. You know the -- as special -- as the special cond --\nspecial diversion -- there was a special name, forget it. Doesn\u2019t matter, they were\nprofessionally killers.",
        "Q: These are Polish?",
        "A: Polish, yeah.",
        "Q: Polish.",
        "A: Yes. But -- tadif. [speaks Polish]. They were giving them special action to execute -- even\nthe execution, yes? Or special action to assassinated somebody, and so on. So they were\nvery, very brave, you know, it -- they were soldier. And they get out from this building,\nfrom these fences, and he -- they started to shoot [indecipherable]. Fine, they jump, they\nempty magazines, you know, of the bullets, and they came back and say, \u201cWho has\nammunition? We are without bullets.\u201d I say, \u201cI have.\u201d From my father. \u201cOh, sit down\nhere and load.\u201d Yes? And to say sit down, they give me empty this and I started to load,\nyes? And they get out for another jump, and again this was the -- the lack of\nprofessionalism of these three brothers, because they were surprised by the action of the\nGerman. German were not in the same place. They were a little bit farther to the left or\nright, doesn\u2019t matter. They attention was to look at these direction and to ge -- fire from\nthe sideway, and the -- suddenly the gates opened, and these two brothers are carrying the\nthird one. Bloody [indecipherable] blo -- blood from the head, from -- yes. And -- and\nthey came and say, \u201cWhere are our leaders?\u201d Yes? Because we came to this place, and\nthere was no single person who will be giving the orders what to do. But of course they\nstarted to cry, \u201cWhere is the sanitary -- sanitary, sanitary,\u201d and so on. They move it from\nanother, and took it -- took him to the quiet place, and fortunately he survive, he survive.\nAnd it was a one of the oldest of us who was thish free Christopher Soukoski, he took\nleadership. And he say fine, we have to move this from this point, because we cannot stay\nhere. We have to go to the -- another place, and make a hort. Yes, he was -- you know, he\nlooks like a -- you know, like a -- I don\u2019t know, bookkeeper from the pousher, you know,\nbut he -- I will never say that he is able to do this. He organized us, and we went into the\nsecond location, and came the first night, and we put the post, you know, and so on,\nregularly, according to the certain routine of the military action, and we -- we have a\nrotation in the -- in the -- to be a -- alive, and searching for the possibility of the German\nattacks, and so on, but they didn\u2019t think about it, the Germans. But, this night we hear the\nSoviet things. They were one kilometer from us. No man\u2019s land was between Soviet\nUnion and us. They penetrate our scouts, I can say, jump in they direction. They made a\ncontact with them, and there was nothing whatsoever, some action and action, and so on,\nno question. And they turn back and went back. I don\u2019t know, maybe on this basis, the\nleaders -- our troop -- aha, of course that our target, this German school full of -- of this,\nwe never attack this. Of course that there was another attack on the -- on the bridge fet of\nthe -- the Vistula River. Absolutely all of them attacking this day. All, n -- even survivor,\neven the women, there was not. They try -- this was -- this would be our future, our fate\nwhen we do the same to this professional, this arms up to the [indecipherable]. So came a\nquiet, and maybe they give some information about the movement in the front, and so on.\nThey made a decision, go to the waiting position in your first -- first gathering, so -- in\nSaskacampa, yes?",
        "Q: Someone -- a courier came, and gave you a message?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Somehow.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yes, yes. Some --",
        "Q: Courier [indecipherable] group gave you a new message.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. It means that, shortly speaking, during the night --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and during the next day, and during the next night, they found themselves, they made a\ndecision to go, that -- give up the weapon, that -- our private weapon, and this which\nwe'll get from this first place, and go to the first location when we left our territory in\nSaskacampa going into the gathering place in Grokov, yes, where we were, you know,\nwhen -- when this shooting occur with us, you know, and --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- especially in -- with me, yeah. But what\u2019s happened now? When I came from --\nbecause this is the time that we give the -- give the order us to go home, because this is\ncloser to wis -- to wint -- to Vistula River, maybe we will cross Vistula River, nobody\nknows. Our -- our situation was this, wait for the [indecipherable]. When I came home, it\nwas a shock in the -- in my home. Sister are crying hysterically, \u201cYou\u2019re alive!\u201d I say,\n\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cY-Y-Y -- our mother is looking your body in the field in Grokov.\u201d I say -- \u201cOne\nof a -- your men from your group came back, and he said that Tad, especially Tad, is\ndead.\u201d When my father investigated him, how was wearing, what was he wearing?\nDescribe it. And he start to make fantasy. \u201cI saw,\u201d he said, \u201cthat he was killed by German\nwith his parabellum.\u201d He exactly described this gun that I had, this gun that is -- was\ngiven by my father. And that\u2019s it. So, my mother was looking for my body, and in the\nbasement I met my father, yes, finishing the coffin for me. So, the coffin for me, it was\nalready built. But I\u2019m still alive. That\u2019s was the end of my participation in Warsaw\nuprising.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s reaction [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh my, you have imagination. Terrible. So we waited for another few days -- not few,\nthis was the 23\" of September, and the -- our territory was surrounded by Germans, as I\nmention in my beginning of this story. We left, because you had to left, you know? What\ndoes it mean, you know? For us, the reality of the Warsaw uprising vanished, yes? We\nwere no weapon, no commands. We did whatever it was -- has -- has to do, and we went\ninto the Pruszkow, yes, by the -- by the train.",
        "Q: What did your father, when -- when you went home and told your father about what\nhappened, and that the leader didn\u2019t show up, it -- did --",
        "A: Ah, you see --",
        "Q: -- did -- what -- what was his reaction --",
        "A: -- what my react -- shi -- you see, he -- my father was a -- he was a quiet man, he was a --\nhe can burst sometimes, and terrible, yes? But in -- in reality, he was very quiet man, and\nhe didn\u2019t blame me, he didn\u2019t do, he didn\u2019t complain about somebody. Be happy that you\nare alive, and that\u2019s it, you know.",
        "Q: So what happened then, at some point, were you ordered to surrender?",
        "A: No, it means that at that moment, it was our decision, yes? It means our decision --",
        "Q: Group?",
        "A: Groups, yes, because as I mentioned to you, we came back and then, when we went --\nwhen we give up to the -- to the Germans, at that moment we were almost together, yes?\nSo decision was, fine, what we are doing, yes? The youngest of us, yes, Marix Keptinski,\nhe was so young, that according to this request of the Germans, yes, he was not eligible to\nget out, yes, he was 16. And he stayed, and Matchie Shapinski, me, Zigmund Paolernuk,\nmys -- my brother-in-law, Paulo Logansun, we went to the gathering place given us by\nthe Germans, and we lost surrender -- peaceful surrender, not as -- as I mentioned to you,\nnot as a soldier of the Warsaw uprising, because if we surrender as the Warsaw uprising\nsays to be honorable soldier, yes, we will be killed in spot. At that moment I told you this,\nthat the authorities of the army in the west, under the command Eisenhower, they didn\u2019t\nsend for two -- almost six weeks, the message to the Germans that they have the three\nsoldier of the Warsaw uprising as a prisoner of the war according to the Geneva\nconvention. This was after six weeks, in spite of fact we were wearing certain distinction\nbands on the head -- arm bands, bla -- white and red. And at that moment, we should be\nrespected as a soldier. Now, this never happened in first six weeks in Warsaw. Every\nsoldier captured was killed in place. Banded. That\u2019s it. Even then, you know, that didn\u2019t -\n- did was naro -- no rule at all, because the civilian were killed in thousand. They used the\ncivilian as a shield in attack to the certain position of the -- of the fighting soldier in\nWarsaw uprising.",
        "Q: But when you went to this place to surrender, what were you surrendering as? A -- a\nPolish citizen?",
        "A: No, [indecipherable] that I surrendered myself to the -- a very big, unknown fate. Yo-Yo\n-- you -- you follow me? I give up my body, and mind to -- to go somewhere, where\nGerman would be leaflets set to us. You want to -- you have to -- simply was pick man\nbetween the age this and this has to leave the -- Warsaw. They will be respected as a\npeople, not -- not so -- but there was a -- in this message there was no mentioning soldier,\nthat pe -- men from age to age, they have to leave the [indecipherable]. There was\nnothing about a soldier. If we will do this -- either, exposed the troops, yes, as we are\ngoing, and we are the soldier of the Warsaw uprising, they will shoot us.",
        "Q: Well, so it was a general call for men to be evacuated from Warsaw\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, no -- you so -- simple story, they tried to remove the potential fighters, yes, and to\nfind workers for them -- some work in Germany.",
        "Q: Did your father go with you?",
        "A: No. No, he was as -- over the age. That\u2019s the one story, and probably at that moment he --\nhe was not so stupid to go, yes. Exactly. We -- yo-yo-you -- you -- you can -- you see this\nis a psychological problem for us. After the shock, we saw ourself that we are zero. That -\n- that our -- we give up everything already, and it was only lucky condition, yes, that we\nsurvive. And now, you realize this is after big emotion, and giving up to fight, and\nsuddenly everything collapsed, I have to build up again something without weapon,\nwithout the commander. So organize something for what? We saw already what\u2019s\nhappened. So, fine, we know that if -- or this we will -- this we\u2019ll know at the time very\nwell. That if yee -- you were -- if you want to oppose the Germans at that moment, you\nare killed. You are dead. So, at that moment we took a risk, yes, to give up ourself into\nthe German hands, but not as a soldier, but as a people that they are asking for. We are\nthe men of 18, get out from here.",
        "Q: So when you got ready to go to that --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Did you say good-bye? How -- please tell us about saying good-bye to your family.",
        "A: Oh yes, it was a lot of tears, and well wishing, you see, because at the moment my\nbrother-in-law, who was not in the army, yes, because he was already new married man,\nyes, husband of my sister, but anyway he had to go, yes? So he joined us, and -- and other\npeople, too, the neighbors, and so on. It not only we, there was a -- from Saskacampa\nthere was 3000 men had to left -- had to leave, and -- and just taking a chance. Another\nchance, you see, to say -- to give up your future into the unknown fate. You know? What\nhappened with us? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s -- a chance was a 50 - 50, maybe less than 50 - 50,\nbecause in the -- in the history that will follow, I had a very little chance, you see? I could\nbe a captured in --in -- I can be locked in the Stutthof, as a inmate, period. And could be\ntreated in -- like a 17,000 last inmate in Stutthof, they were drowned in the Baltic Sea.\nYou know this? Very last group of the Stutthof people were loaded on the barges, and\ndrowned in the sea, wintertime. So -- but there was a lesson, of course. You -- you see,\nthere was a lesson that -- that -- that he -- we -- I get this lesson, that you have to be\nactive. Active. Y-Y-You have to do something that you are thinking that this is proper.\nJust to give up themself -- I have an idea what I will do. This happened in Pruszkow,\nwhen we came to the Pruszkow, a group of our neighbor, yes, they -- they give up the\ninitiative into the German\u2019s hand. It mean that not in such a way that -- to the -- because\nwe were all in the German hands, but they didn\u2019t try to make a own movement. You\nfollow me? They say, \u201cOh, I, now I\u2019m here, okay, I will be here, yes? I will not do\nanything unless somebody will touch me for -- by the -- by the arms, and get up.\u201d We left\nthe Stutthof in the -- of course, that is the coincident -- we left the Stutthof in the first\ntransport, and we made the decision. Now, they are asking us to get out? Yes, we are\ngoing. And we get out, and we enter the transport to Stutthof. This other, my friends, I\ncall them. Inie Pavouschevski, come on with us. Yes? No, he say, no, no, no. The next\ntransport went to the Austria. Austria, Gross-Rosen. None of them come back.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to your s -- you\u2019re standing around, you\u2019ve been called, you\u2019re\nsurrendering, your -- your -- you\u2019re following this order.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: May I interrupt you?",
        "Q: Mo -- absolutely.",

You see, they told me, give up your\nweapon, go int -- go to this gathering place where you were, and ga -- and li -- wait for\nthe farther orders. Sorry, your farther\u2019s orders never come again, yes? Because at this\nmoment, yes, earlier and be -- on the September 23\", German came and say, \u201cGet out\nfrom here.\u201d Now -- so, yo-you realize this fact, sometimes I am th -- I am thinking on\nthis subject, and I say we didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Because either I will -- we could\nfight, but maybe it was n -- I can say providence made the -- another decision with our\nlife, yes? At -- maybe they save -- spare our life in this way, and with it, a lot of our life --\nin our life.",
        "Q: How did the Germans treat you when you went to this gathering point? What -- what\nhappened?",
        "A: This was a -- you see, there was a very many kinds of Germans. Even they were the\ncertain cooperating army from outside Germany, it\u2019s like Ukrainian army, Hungarian\narmy, Lithuanian army, Estonian army. Or this is, I will tell you something, because I met\nvery s -- fast aggression, yes? The men who hire me in [indecipherable] company -- you\nrealize this fact? Men who hired --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- me when I came this, he was a soldier of the Estonian army, and he was in\nSuchenwald. Okay, so what I am saying -- and they\u2019re for. In this case, because the\nguerilla [indecipherable] was a very high authority --",
        "Q: In Germany\u201d",
        "A: In Germany, yes, very, very. And he -- I -- in some way I am considering ou --\nconsidering him as a -- as a honorable general, because what he said, he -- and promise,\nhe did it. If he give the order to do this, he did it. And he was not the apparachik Hitler\nNazi -- you know, like Himmler, or something like that, no. So, but I\u2019m not -- \u2019'm not\napologizing him -- making apology for the -- for the action that the -- of the\n[indecipherable], but when we came to the gathering place, there were army soldiers.\nArmy, not SS, not some -- some unknown people. They loaded us to the -- to the we --\nwagon, and we had to wait closed in the wagon for about 60 hours, because at that\nmoment they -- there was heavy fight along the train going to the Pruszkow. And this --\nthis railroad track was passing through the lines of the Warsaw uprising, and Germany.\nAnd inside of our train, there were killed people. Probably by the -- by the friendly fire.\nBecause you see, some Polish soldier saw the train passing. Saw the train, German train,\nso let\u2019s shoot them. And we arrived the -- to the Pruszkow, and in Pruszkow was first to\nrelax, yes.",
        "Q: What was Pruszkow, where was it?",
        "A: Pruszkow, it was a previous big company, building the -- the machinery, and -- and the\nwagon, railroad tracks, and so on. This was this, and -- but at the time was totally empty.\n[indecipherable] manufacture the hose, and everything was empty, and there was only\nwater in hydrants, nothing to sleep, just concrete, railrer tracks, and that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: How long of a ride was it?",
        "A: Right?",
        "Q: How long were -- did it take to get there?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s a -- from -- from this place where we entered the train, to this, this was about --\nwaiting time was -- to -- to wait for the free passage, yes? And it was about two hours,\nand -- and that\u2019s it, we were in -- in the -- in the afternoon, ear -- early afternoon, we were\n-- in early morning, and early afternoon we were there. And of course, you see, this is a\nstory that we get something from mother, this from sister, and so on. I remember after I\nget there, and now that\u2019s -- this was mother. You know, he give me the gold bracelet, you\nknow, maybe you will have to eat -- to use this, and so on.",
        "Q: This is your mom? Your mother?",
        "A: From my moth -- from my mother. A-And I can tell you I sure that I brought it back. All\nthe time I have it with me, in the belt here, under the belt. So, I brought back, and more.\nNot more in such a case because [indecipherable] myself, yeah. And in the Pruszkow,\nthere was a selection, yes? I -- I wasn\u2019t there. You see, I -- I even don\u2019t know exactly how\na -- how long I was this -- very shortly, the 23 and yes, and the morning 25, it is\n[indecipherable] two days after two days, we -- and we were loaded to the transport, and -\n- and we reached the Stegna. Stegna. And this was the beginning of the oppression,\nbecause at the time there, we found the German superselect Gestapo, with the Topenkoff,\nyou know, the -- you know what this Topenkoff meaning? Skull -- skool, yes? Skool and\nbones. You know, this is the symbol on the -- on the -- here, on the collars. On the black,\nwhite skull with the bones, this is -- was the symbol of SS. And of course we -- we\narrived very -- beginning of the night, and with the carol, and of course that I -- I said this\nwas the fright -- frightening, this was in -- inhuman, you know, when this prisoner from\nthe Stutthof tr -- well, he had a smart idea. He tried to penetrate us, and he lose our\nidentification of the -- of the -- of the -- of the prison.",
        "Q: So right when you first got to Stegna, which is Stutthof --",
        "A: Stegna, no, is a -- a railroad station not far from Stutthof.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. I\u2019m just clarifying, okay. So you -- you -- you\u2019ve arrived nearby Stutthof.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The concentration camp?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what you\u2019re describing is a prisoner from there 1s trying to kind of melt into your\ngroup?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It means that in the potato field, they were working inmates of the -- of the -- of the -- of\nthe concentration camp, under the guards of the periphery. And one of them started to --\nto penetrate this through the potato field, our group. But some boy, he [indecipherable]\nyou know, maybe 12 years old, you know, he showed him, yes? And that morning when\nhe started to run away, wherever -- in what -- in whatever direction he run, he hit the\nguards. So he run another way. And then this -- this -- he was surrounded closer, and\ncloser, and closer and then was beaten terribly, you know, the carbines were broken on\nhis body. And -- and they last all day, they, believe me, this was like a [indecipherable],\nyes, for us, and for them, you know. They -- they can do and get a gun and shoot him,\nand that\u2019s it, it\u2019s finished in any moment, yeah? No, they did it for -- for us. We get a\n[indecipherable]. And they took him, you know, the -- you know, dragging him, and then\n-- then he vanished then. Later -- later, I saw the [indecipherable] of this gun, I saw the\nexecution of this man -- of this man, because he wasn\u2019t killed. When he entered the\nStutthof, of course, during the night, barking dogs, you know this -- in white uniform,\nyes, to -- to be s -- visible, you know, in the crowd, with these bats, yes. Sticks, and so we\nwent there, exhausted emotionally, and everything, and it\u2019s -- some of us started to\nrealize where we are. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know that where I am, but there are\npeople who knew. And the same day, the same night, one of us newcomer, he committed\nsuicide. He went just -- in spite of the warning voices, halt, halt, yes, and then you hear\nonly two shots bang, bang, and he fall down on the -- on the electrical fence. So was\nkilled finally by the -- by the shock, electric fence shock. He was taken away and then the\nnext few days -- two days, we spent on the -- in the open place, sitting on the sound,\nwithout weapon, without nothing, just sitting. And there was s -- the -- our older people\nfrom our group, fluently speaking English, with the li -- booklets -- no, leaflets from\n[indecipherable]. They s -- that\u2019s for me and [indecipherable] they started to talk to them.\nThey permit them to talk to the authorities of the camp, and they presented this, that we\nare the volunteer. We came here, and we gave up our person to the authorities, and so on.\nAnd I think that you will accept the [indecipherable]. And of course did I mention here in\nmy -- in my s -- letter that probably this was not only this, but they were -- they were\noverloaded. It came too many persons, and the struthel was not so -- there was a\nfareetenslager like Birkenau, where can destroy the fi -- 5000 people in day. So -- so --\nhave a problem, that\u2019s a one story. They -- they need me, they need work to be done,\nsomewhere. If you want to build the conce -- any concentration camp as a subcamp of the\nStutthof, you have to organize, yes? You have to guard, you have this, and you have the\nshelter for the guard, you have the kitchen for the guards. Because even if you don\u2019t have\nto think about the inmates, yes, the prisoner. But you have to do this by the guards. So\nthey had not. So this was a probably the case that, fine, let\u2019s use it as a worker, yes?",
        "Q: What kind of people were mostly there? Poles, or was it a mix of people?",
        "A: This in this group, exclusively Polish people from Praga. Praga or Saskacampa. This was\n5000 people that arrived at Pruszkow, in the first transport, that I was in. So probably in\n99 percent was only Polish.",
        "Q: But in the whole concentration camp, also?",
        "A: Oh no, no, this was a [indecipherable] concentration camp existed since 1939, when the -\n- when the -- Poland was attacked by Hitler in Gdansk, and this territory, yes, that were\ncaptured by Germany, there was a lot of opposition, a lot of Polish patriots, and so on, so\nthey -- again, what I said, the -- cut the head, and you will -- you have a problem\nresolved, yes, and therefore the most people [indecipherable] were sent to the Stutthof\nfrom this territory. And say e -- in the -- in the Stutthof camp -- subcamp in Sofinbaden,\nthere was the people from Poltuleetsa. Poltuleetsa there were ordinary cashoops, you\nknow, cashoora -- cashoop is the Polish people who are calling themself as a cashoop,\nthey are speaking Polish, but if -- if you are -- 1f you would ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d He\nwill say -- give you the answer, \u201cI am cashoop,\u201d yes. But like, say maybe you can go to\nbeautiful places in Zakoparna, i1-in Mounting, yes? Who are you? I am Gourat, yes? And\nif you will -- if you will study this situation here, you will find that who are the gouras in\nPolish territory who are speaking Polish, and they are very Polish people, yes? They are\nthe stits -- you know, sitz, they travel as a tribe across the Europe, and finish his journey\nin Scotland. Scottish people are absolutely Polish cashoops. We are dancing in the same\nway, and they are singing in the same, they are playing the -- the -- no -- pipes, yes? This\nis the tribe that didn\u2019t reach the Scotland, but are Polish now.",
        "Q: When you first got to the outskirts of the concentration camp, and you saw the man who\nwas hunted --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then another person who was with you committed suicide --",
        "A: Suicide.",
        "Q: What were you realizing? What was going through your mind about where -- what kind\nof situation you were 1n?",
        "A: No, I -- yes, no, not only this, because you know, as I mentioned, you know this -- was a\nfew days later, execution of the men. And I was able, from this position where I was, to\nsee this execution, and to hear the music playing during this execution. Beautiful melody\nof Lehas. You know, [sings]. I hear it in concentration camp and when the man was\nhanging. And at that moment, you see, where you were at work -- I am work, you see, I\nhave to leave this place as possible, as fast as possible, to get out, to have a chance at --\nand suddenly, they calling for the professionals by -- by the baroof -- baroof --\nprofession. And I -- I am there, and I say I\u2019m a draftsman, I am [indecipherable] e bin\nsifener, and they find -- note it this way.",
        "Q: But you weren\u2019t, were you?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Were you a draftsman?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Yes, I was, you see, a -- during the war, as -- I was the -- say, I did the first degree in my\ntechnical education. So I was a good draftsman at that time, and I -- I -- I can do this very\nwell. And at that moment, I capture my friend, Shapinski, come on, you. Are you going\nto [indecipherable] you. Take a chance to get out from here. Later we will think about it,\nwhat to do, yeah. In the same way ask the people to dig that simple -- simple worker. I\nsend -- I -- I told to my -- to my -- to my s -- brother-in-law, \u201cNietai, get out from here,\nand you will [indecipherable] you will -- you will have a -- you will u -- use the digging\ndevices, and you will be worker, yes. Get out from here.\u201d And so a lot of people, it was\nabout, as I mentioned, about 150 they selected us, and they, next day transported us to the\n-- another subcamp.",
        "Q: Just in that little bit of a moment, you were really taking kind of a -- a leadership role\nwith people that you cared about, and --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: -- were trying to help. Di -- what made you do that? I mean, you weren\u2019t just looking out\nfor yourself [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, no. You see, as I -- I -- I -- I would like to live it, we were in the group from the\ntroops, yes, somehow our Home Army troop. We were together all the time. I will tell\nyou then something that -- not that I\u2019m -- to emphasize that I am such a good boy, yes,\nthat I\u2019m so patriots, that I am so friendly to another friends. You see in this concentration\n-- you know, in the Pruszkow, I met Garouto, you remember, the Olympian, that he was -\n- he\u2019d once help us, and he taught me as a light athletes to throw the javelin, and s --\njumps, and so on. He met me, \u201cOh, Tadeusz, what are you doing here? Fine. Let\u2019s go,\nand you will be my hemp -- helper.\u201d\u2019 And my answer was very simple. \u201cI am not alone.\u201d\n\u201cHow many you have?\u201d \u201cFive.\u201d [indecipherable]. \u201cI cannot,\u201d he said to me, and I said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, [indecipherable], I -- I will manage.\u201d And we went together. So we went\ninto the Stutthof together, and in the first time [indecipherable] I was -- the -- we were\ntogether. So, we left Saskacampa, and we left Stutthof in the same time. And really, wi --\nthis was my [indecipherable] to exers -- to eck -- to --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, exaggerated [indecipherable], I was initiate -- initiator. I was in this game, believe\nme, I was my father. Yes, I behave like my father. Don\u2019t be waiting. You have to be\nactive. Go, search. You -- you have a -- your mobility will give you a bigger chance.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: -- we\u2019re in Arlington, Virginia doing an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, with Tadeusz Marchaj. And this is tape six. See, so we left you, you are now in\nStutthof.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you\u2019ve been there for a day or two.",
        "A: Day or -- day.",
        "Q: A day. And what is your physical state at this point, and your mental state?",
        "A: First of all -- no, what was the -- the physical state, it was just that I was in good shape\nphysics. It means that all these experiences with the exhaustion due to the heat and so on,\nI can stand it very easy. Mentally, this -- there was a lot of thinking. It was not a -- a\ndevotion to started to think what I will do, what I will do. No, I have to do something. In -\n- in the possible -- in the margin of my possible ways, yes, to do something. So, I know\nhow to manage, to sleep on the -- on the sand, under the sky. This is something\nexperience, you know, that it -- 1t was too bothering me, yes, 1-it was a -- almost natural,\nyes. When I was re -- lying on my back, and instead of ceiling, I saw beautiful\nconstellation, I say at that moment, I\u2019m in the camp, but a little bit different,\n[indecipherable] at camp. It means that mentally I -- I try to relax, and not even to find, in\nthis condition the work that I am still -- 1-1-1n the nice wert, that around me something\nthat I want to reach there. And therefore, the -- I was able to think only what was needed,\nwhat I will do next day, yes, if they will select me, yes, because these -- they were\nstarting to talk about the selection, we had talks about selection. And therefore, when this\ncame, I was absolutely sure who are you, siekner, and I am going to leave this place as\nsoon as possible. What I can do, I took my friend with me, I advise my brother-in-law,\nand another friend, Zigmund Paolernuk from my troops, to go find. We will use the\nphysical force to dig the earth. And we left. Of course, in me -- in the meantime, I know -\n- not as I -- as I mentioned this execution and so on, this closed my knowledge about the\nStutthof. You know, I know that Stutthof, about the Stutthof you can write in books. Is\nstory of thousands of peoples, and each of the story was the same, yes? Sitting in barrack,\nand get the piece of bread, go to work, and come back, and so on. Fortunately for me, of\ncourse, this a -- my lucky star was shining about me, that I never was a such a person.\nAnd I am very pity for these people, and I know immediate what I will say that I saw it,\nbut without pain. It was that I get a knowledge without pain. I was observant, almost,\nyes? And my faith, it give me the chance to be only in this position, because I knew very\nwell that Stutthof wasn\u2019t a nice place to be. And that\u2019s all, and fe -- I -- I -- I -- I\nmentioned in the very beginning, you know, that I was in some way curious when I read\nthis Gittorda Schnyder book, that she probably has the same practice like me. That she\ndidn\u2019t fight -- that she didn\u2019t find the Stutthof, and Suchenwalda only as a martyrdom.\nShe took away -- she took away something more. More teaching element, about the\nhumanity, and so on. Little -- I -- I was very surprised, you know, that they tried to save\nthis SS man.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about an author of a book --",
        "A: Of the book.",
        "Q: -- we should just make that clear.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And we don\u2019t need to go into that, but the --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- the name of the book is, \u201cThe Unfinished Road.\u201d",
        "A: \u201cUnfinished Road,\u201d and this is the book about the Suchenwalda that we are -- that we\nwill start to talk about this [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re feeling pretty good, and there is an off -- there is a selection, or an\nopportunity, and you volunteer yourself as a professional draftsman?",
        "A: Draftsman, yes.",
        "Q: Tell us what happens then.",
        "A: So, next day, I think so, this was the day of -- I can look at the date, but this 1s not so\nimportant, but same day that -- August 29\", yes? They started to organize nus -- us, and\nwe left on the August 30\". So I was in -- in concentration part har -- in Stutthof, I was\nfive days. I came 25\". and I left 30. And therefore, this was the five days, as I mentioned.\nWhat I saw -- I saw the -- oh, I already mention, yes, that it was enough to -- to have a\nfull knowledge what does it mean, and the -- to be in -- with this knowledge, to be free,\nwithout experienci-cing a real life in Stutthof. That\u2019s was a big, big, lucky condition that I\nfaced at that time. So we went to the station, Stegna. We entered the railroad track,\npersonal. Free for the open public, not a -- not a --",
        "Q: Cattle cars.",
        "A: Car -- I say -- cattle car, yes. And in very cultural way, we arrived to Leibush. Cultural\nway because we were sitting on the banks, yes, open doors, open windows. If somebody\nwould like to escape, lees you can do this. Even you can do this, yes. But of course that\nmy feeling, and everybody feeling was no, no, no, no, that\u2019s is not the time, yes. My\nfeeling is. Maybe somebody, but nobody make attempt. Where is this -- the Leibush?\nThere was a very loose, small camp, surrounded by the fences, barbed wire, and post\ntowers. And we spend there -- hat there was a first registration. First registration beyond\nthe Stutthof, because in Stutthof we never entered the registration of the Stutthof. Certain\nnotation about the -- about our profession technically was for the special people who\nwere looking for this, but this was not for the authorities of the -- of the camp. So\ntherefore, this is my problem life, that I cannot find the records of my presence in the\nStutthof. But doesn\u2019t matter. In -- in -- in the first registration, was in Leibush, but there\nwas a very short time, I think that this something lee -- about two days, you see. And\nfrom this point they took us to place called Brucie -- Brucie. And there was a official\nname of this, it was hausencommander -- commander Leibush, commander Brucie,\nhausencommander SS trupen eeboongsplatz, bruce sopienbarda1. It means that this\ncomplex -- aha, now, of course I can make a digression, that we entered the territory\nwhen we were moved from Leibush to Brucie. We can say like a capital town of the\npulligol. There was a territory in -- in cashoops, yes, but this was the Polish territory\nbefore the war, but as izproisin in Germany during the occupation. And they -- this\nterritory was about 50 kilometers by 40, yes? Big, big, totally secluded. People, if they\nwere living, they throw it away, and they started to build a eebungsplatz, which this\nmeans exercising some military action. But not only because I knew a little bit more,\nbecause I was a draftsman at the drawings. That was not only eebungsplatz, that was a\nfuture launching territory of the rockets in the direction to the north. All orientation of the\nlaunching pad were north. It was not to Sweden because this was exactly Sweden in front\nof this territory, yes. This was probably -- the goal was United States. And of course, at\nthat time, Germans were able to send the rockets V17, from Europe to America, over the\nNorth Pole. And of course there was missing only one element, yes? Rocketry was\nperfect, but there was no atomic head, because there would be a stupidity to send a simple\nexplosive, yes? They were waiting at the time for atomic head. If they will -- if they\nwould have had atomic head at that time, the launching was -- would be Sofinwalda.\nYeah, so we came there, first to Brucie, and this was official subcamp of Stutthof. But\nthey have no ability to the people, yes, so the -- they -- this was in s -- in the state of the --\nto be born, yes? Start was nastendi to have people and labor camp for this arrangement.\nAnd in Bruce was again the selection, and I -- and selection -- in Bruce, a certain people\nwho were for the physical work, like my -- my brother-in-law, Zigmund Paolernuk, they\nwent into the orlik -- in the place orlik, and they started to be a simple worker. And they\nbuild the -- they build the hospital for this territory. It was a lot of different -- different\nsection of this territory. I was sent to Zochenbad. In Zochenballid there was a ballitunk. It\nmeans that the -- the place where you are -- management place of this -- of this territory,\nand there was a -- some engineering stop, and we came as a draftsman to make a drawing\nfor them. And as -- as I mentioned yes, that this was the so-called SS from erbiten unken\nnaming number 128. This was the official name. And when we came there, we get shelter\nin the barracks, which were built already, wi -- ve -- with very little fancies, bar fancies,\nand a lot of different storage houses for the -- for the any materials, yes, that could be\nused to build this beauti -- big -- big enterprise, Sofienwalda, SS evungsplatz isproisa.\nAnd there were -- we get the -- this card, in number, I -- this is the card that I only -- you\nsee, I don\u2019t know why I have it, and not my friend. This was the escarta. It means that\ncoupon for the food. Why, after it -- it -- about one week, we build our arrangement. We\nmade a arrangement to build a kitchen, and we started to -- to have a cook, who cook for\nus the food.",
        "Q: In your barracks?",
        "A: In our barracks, within the certain fences, yes, barbed wire fences. But very loose, you\nknow, there was no guard standing, you see? There was another big fence, around bigger\narea where was the management building, where were the storage houses, and this\nterritory was in some way guarded by the -- by the guards. But very loose, even as you\nhard1 -- shortly speaking, we were treated as a worker. We could get out from our -- from\n-- from this camp. We can go to the town by permission, written permission, and you see\nnow, after the Stutthof, we were 1n paradise, you know? You -- what -- what you had to\ndo, you had to work, yes? Of course the food was -- you -- you have imagination, but it\nwas eatable, and was enough. Not die. And treatment was, as I mentioned, on the basis\nthe lord and servant, and German and Polish, yes, so th-th-this was the relationship, but a\nvery -- but it, first of all they -- they recognize our professional. If I make a drawing --\nand I remember when I made the first drawing, yes, oh, nice, yes. And they even ge --\nthey applauded me, oh, very nice drawing, yes? Th-They recognize me as a professional,\nyou see, because they were in the SS uniform, but they were professional.",
        "Q: S-S-So there was a certain amount of respect. Did you ever encounter SS troop -- men\nwho were hostile towards Poles? Just Poles, and --",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Y-Y-You see, we had a -- we were mis -- as I understand, because nobody\nexplained me what was our status at that time, but I understand that they don\u2019t want to\nhave any trouble with -- with the new development. It was they were happy as is. We are\nthe worker making work, and therefore, why to think about to build the fences, to build\nthe bunkers, yes, for the penalty, and to do some oppressive elements in this -- in this\ncamp, like -- like in stut -- stut -- Stutthof, because there was a just the -- the history of\nany concentration camp where they try to destroy the people, it was just to -- to key the --\nsuch a condition that the human body weight is going down and down and down. Is a\nterrible way of thinking about, because this was a technological problem for the German.\nHow to destroy the people. So is easier to destroy the 50 kilograms body than the 150. So\ntherefore the first priority was just to -- to -- to lose the weight. Terrible. You know, what\n-- what was the Birkenau -- Rejinka this t -- hundreds of barracks where they deliver\nthese people, 5000 a day. What they did in these barracks? They make the easy way to\ndestroy the bodies. From 100 to 50. So this was a -- moral issue doesn\u2019t exist at all. There\nwas only technological problem. So we were not in this position, yes? Stutthof was. So\nwe -- we were regular worker. A little later change everything, yes? In the very beginning\nwas -- and now, to -- to give as the feeling that we are not so easygoing Polish people, so\nwe had a visit from the personnel, from Stutthof, and I was beaten by such a SS man,\nwho came to us, and he -- I didn\u2019t yet, at that moment to understand his German very\nfluently, he started to put me in the corner of the -- of the room, and took a -- a -- a line\nfor the -- for the for measurement, and he push me 1-in such a possin that I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what he wanted from me? What -- what I have to do? And he just tried to put\nme in the corner and measure what is the dimension of my body to build a bunker. You\nknow what was the penalize bunker for them. Is the three dimensional for the width, and -\n- and this, and you had to stay there in -- in the standing position for I don\u2019t know, two,\nthree, four days, without sitting. So I suffer in the same, you know where? In the Polish\nprison. Exactly in the bunker. So, you know, the Polish prison -- at that moment if\nsomebody is asking me, they were not better than Hitler, bunkers. So, but of course, this\nis not the Polish. I said Polish, but is wrong, this was the Communist. Cause the\nCommunist really -- so, he came to us to give us the warning, you are not a free peop --\nyes a -- yes, so we had this visit. And this was a very nice, everything, up to the -- of\ncourse it -- I -- I presented here in my memoir, you know, the -- the name of the -- of the\npeople that -- which is very interesting to point one, that there was a engineer from\nBoinies, who was in uniform s -- SS, and -- but was origin Dutch. Now, this was a totally\nlike us, yes, behaves, but not -- not very openly. When we were only with us, he behaves\nin very special way. And later he vanished. At a certain day, when the alliance of frenzif\nin the west started to go into the Holland direction, he vanished, and then we -- we have a\nmessage, not the message, rumor, that he was a spy. He left the office, taking a document,\nand he just got out. So, was the Boinies, when I -- I -- I just mentioned it, when I -- when\nthis Robert, SS man, like orengutang, you know, he looks, and he just make the sketch,\nand put on -- on the desk, to do the drawing. So when I asked the -- my authorities what I\nhave to do with this sketch. At that moment, they say, [indecipherable] he did show, yeah\n-- So wit -- this was his answer. And -- and then this was up to the November 23. On\nNovember 23, in the very beginning of the day, we were awake up -- woke up surrounded\nby the many guards. And they throwed us from the -- from the barracks. They made a\nsearch our body, anyway they didn\u2019t find gold, and -- and because I was always with me,\nand -- but they searched the barracks, they took a lot of things from the barracks, and --\nand they force us to build a second row -- second fence. And they read to us the order of\nthe commandant that since today, we will be treated as a political prisoner. And our\nunsubordination to the order will be penalized at once by the death, but -- and the\ncrossing the border of the guards line, you will be shot without warning. It\u2019s like at the\nbig a -- concentration camp, and fi -- but it was given this, and of course everything was\ncancelled in our -- our walking, our letter, wa -- everything is this. And we were regular\nprisoner, but again, 1t was dying [indecipherable] you know, the Third Reich was dying,\nand this impulse, yes, was given by the -- by the order of the higher authorities, yes, that\nis --that we are prisoner, but you have to execute this in some way. But, to execute this,\nyou have to have a power, you have to [indecipherable], what I wrote in the very\nbeginning. You have to create a condition of the real concentration camp. And of course,\nthe -- our regime of our work time, walking, correspond mail, and so on, was like in -- in\nthe concentration camp, but there were no pressure. There was not standing by a cr --\ncrematorium, yes? There was not a standing by oppressor who are waiting to kill you,\nyes, because there was a -- the only one purpose to be in -- 1 -- in Stutthof, it was to be\nkilled. Here, we were still worker, treated as a -- as a politisha pratinga, but -- but they\nrecognized the fact that fine, I cannot kill him because he is working for me, give me the\npurpose. My presence here was totally different than in Stutthof. And of course, day by\nday, November, December, you know, Red Army\u2019s approaching in the west, 1s, you\nknow, the alien forces are entering almost Germany. So this is the case when in February,\nyes, it was a -- oh, was only we, yes, and the poltuleetsa camp, it was a Sofenwalda, we\nare there. There was a prisoner from the poltuleetsa, as I mentioned, this was the prisoner,\npolitical prisoner cashoops, that never try to recognize a power, and authorities of\nGerman. You know, they were really Polish people who said no, we are Polish people,\nand we are not recognizing you as a power. So they send them to the prison. Of course, a\nlot of them, they recognize this power, and they went into the German army, fighting on\nthe west -- east front. So you see, this was another set -- another chance for the people,\nyes, to go with, or to go against. You see, they said, I am going against, and they won.\nThey who said, fine, I am going with German, they were loser, because they were forced\nto be a German with all privileges to be soldier, and to be killed in the name of the Third\nReich. So, you see, when I give up myself to the German, I did something opposite were\nthese people in poltuleetsa. Is a very hard to find the choice, wh-what I have to do in my\nlife now? So, this is the nu -- you cannot find the answer what you have to do. This 1s the\n-- you, your ability, imagination, and decision.",
        "Q: A-And you\u2019re, at this point, you\u2019re still with your -- your two friends?",
        "A: Yes, ah, now, before this happened that they locked us as a political prisoner, my friends,\nwho are -- who were Jewish origin, you know, Matchie Shapinski is a Jewish, but -- he\nwas a Jewish, and I know that he was a Jewish, because I know who is a professor\nBatswell Shapinski, very famous mathematician in Poland. So, I never discuss this\nproblem with ma -- Matchie, yes? We were very good friend, yes, so --",
        "Q: But he was pretending to be Catholic? Or --",
        "A: I never re -- never saw him a -- a -- a -- performing the act of the -- of the Catholic boy,\nyeah?",

        "Q: He was hiding, yeah.",
        "A: -- fra -- | am saying, it was an terrible story for the Jewish people in Poland, that these\nOrthodox people were so distinguished, easy to recognize, that even they have no chance\nto hide themselve, because they were just -- the Jewish know the -- like -- like a looking\nat the -- at -- at -- at the shape, yes? So you know that this is a shape, so when you look at\nthese guys -- see, here you know he is a Jewish. Y-You see, they were so different that\nthey find a problem to hide themselves. Even to find the hiding place for them. You\nfollow me? You couldn\u2019t go to forest on, to find as a prisoner like a partisan.\n[indecipherable] know how you could do this, where you have the family with the\nchildren. So alright, so --",
        "Q: Your friend --",
        "A: -- Matchie, my friend, one day he went -- we -- we are free to go. He went to the place\nwith the scorshishina, and he was at the doctor, and he came back, and say -- said, very\nsad, \u201cTadeusz, I have tuberculosis.\u201d \u201cMatchie, [indecipherable] what you are talking\nabout?\u201d \u201cNo, but maybe I have a chance to get out from this place.\u201d \u201cFine, so I will go to\nmy -- my uncle and -- a-and [indecipherable] this [indecipherable] near Krakow, you\nknow, Slominiki.\u201d So fine, okay. The same day I met Bogdon Palmoski. I have\ntuberculosis. [indecipherable]. You know? And his brother Palmoski, he has the\ntuberculosis. You know, how brave was this doctor? He\u2019s not out for me, who gave they -\n- them this test -- a test really, how to say, the prognosis -- no, really --",
        "Q: Diagnosis.",
        "A: Diagnosis of this doctor, because German were -- were very afraid this, coo --\ntuberculosis for them, they all -- they were very afraid. And because the gia -- German\nauthorities everywhere, yes, for them tuberculosis was like a cancer that ee -- that could\nspread this cancer by the -- no, congestion, yes, congestion. Congestion? No, not\ncongestion, no. That some illness is -- could be transferred to another person by -- no --",
        "Q: Contagious.",
        "A: -- by virus -- contagious.",
        "Q: Contagious, yes.",
        "A: That, contagious. They -- they were very afraid, the disease of tuberculosis is contagious,\nforget it. And believe or not, three Jewish boy left Sofenwald. I, of course, at the time, I\nwas serious. I say -- even Balmosi get this. I was a little bit start to think, but I persuaded\nmyself. Tadeusz, you are facing some act of mercy of a person who 1s giving help.\nPhysically, he could be killed. He made a help for them. I have to respect this. I cannot do\nsomething, because probably he bisk -- this -- this -- this doctor was probably a Jewish.\nHe\u2019d been some way. He covered, I don\u2019t know, maybe not the first generation, maybe\nsecond generation Jewish. He give it a chance to survive. And they left the concentration\ncamp. So I was, as you can see, the only time that I was together with them, and so then I\nwas alone. Okay, but they get to Krakow, and they have a very good life with the family 1\n-- my family there.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re alone in Sofenwalda?",
        "A: Yes. And then came this November 23 [indecipherable] ah, there was a -- I can tell you, I\nmade many attempts, but in different way to arrange my departure from the -- from this.\nAs I mentioned my -- my -- my godfather, Jusef Kameeta, who was before the war a -- a -\n- a mayor of this Slominiki, yes? During the occupation, he was all -- still recognized by\nthe people of Slominiki as a representative of -- of the society, of -- of this town. And he\nhad a good connection, as I mentioned, connection, celebrities played the role in the life.\nHe approached the German authorities of the SS bowelitung near Krakow -- y-y-you --\nyou see the same name, SS bowelitung in different place. I was in the hand of SS\nbowelitung from the [indecipherable] numery -- number 120. Similar arrangement of the\n-- of the enterprise of the SS, to build something, was near Krakow. And he sent to me\nletter, before this 23 of November. \u201cTadeusz, I will ask a help from the authorities of the\nSS bowelitung near Krakow, to transfer you from this place to another place.\u201d And this\nletter one day arrive, official letter in for me. Not for me, but for the -- is -- is not here. I -\n- I never -- because I -- I couldn\u2019t make this am, but I am just [indecipherable] because\nthese are not how this was played. And this -- this order to transfer person -- Tadeusz\nMarchaj from there to there came, and yost volga viost called me. \u201cHey, Tad -- Tadeusz,\u201d\nhe was -- he was speaking to -- to -- to me in this way. \u201cYou want to go home?\u201d I say,\n\u201cNo -- I can say so.\u201d I was talking German. \u201cBut you see, I\u2019m a berstubenfeer\nvolgangyos, and if you want to be transfer, this letter has to build -- has to be undersigned\nby be -- the two rankings higher officer. At the time, I will respect. I will have the right to\nrespect.\u201d [indecipherable] this? Between them, there were the some -- some connection,\nI-I don\u2019t know, like a social connection. And he want to be respected, yes, by -- by the\nother guy, yeah? And this letter went back. So I get this letter. \u201cOkay, I will have\ntouchiga.\u201d, my uncle answer. And this letter, with the two highest order officer, came\nafter 23\" of November. I was already political prisoner. So, was another attempt made,\nthat he said ah -- my -- my -- my -- my unc -- my godfather said, \u201cTad,\u201d -- it was yet\npossible to -- to send the letters, because it was very, very limited. \u201cCan you get you from\nthe prison -- from the camp, because I will send a man who will pick up you, and will\ndeliver you to Krakow.

        "A: -- it was such a -- because feesay I will -- maybe there will be a -- a -- a visiting -- a -- our\nfriend. Association do have a chance to get out from -- from this, and that was enough for\nme to understand what they are they trying to do.",
        "Q: As the war is coming closer to an end, how do things change for you, or do they?",
        "A: No, 1-1-it means that of course that I\u2019m saying -- I -- I mention only this to say that I was\nalways active, and somebody was -- has to be active to do something, but fail, fail, fail.\nNow, this is prepare, 23rd 1s coming, prisoner and -- political prisoner, [indecipherable]\nmoment is everything finished, yes? It means that now I -- 1s still something that I can do.\nAnd I -- what I am thinking, what I did -- I -- in what a condition, I\u2019m -- I am paralyzed,\nalmost, because I entered the room of my authorities, Mr. Rudy -- Rudy Brann, and took\na stamp in Blanco, on the paper, with the here, and there, white paper, that I --",
        "Q: Took it?",
        "A: I enter his room --",
        "Q: You stole it?",
        "A: Stole it. I stamp it, and put in my pockets, and maybe I can write here something on this\npaper as a passport, yes, to get out. But if -- believe me, if this somebody will caught me\nin this moment at -- in the desk of the serouti brand, they will probably, 1-in spite of some\nfriend will kill -- they will kill me, or send to the concentration camp. What a risk I make.\nOh, now zlotas. The war is approaching, end is approaching. As I mentioned, they are\nonly -- we are in de -- Sofenwalda, this business is finished. We are at full liquidation,\nand they liquidate also our camp, and transfer to the poltuleetsa camp, to be together\nunder one command, one -- one rooms, one guards, and so on. And the -- this is the day\nwhen is coming the liquidation of the -- of the Jewish women part of the camp. And one\nday, this is the -- this is the -- this is the -- ah, wait. In the -- yes, yes, this is -- just I\nmentioned, only February, 1945. We got the orders, yes, we have to go to this place, and\nto clean a certain buildings where the --",
        "Q: Within Sofenwald?",
        "A: Yes, in the -- within the Sofenwald, wa -- the -- was get to [indecipherable] Schineder --\nSchnyder, and -- and we went and entered this roo -- this part of the camp -- we was\ntotally separated from another. And you see, this is the building, and this is the building --\nof course, tha -- sa -- you see only fragment of this -- part of this. But they are there\nstanding, two big, huge buildings, where the Jewish women were. And -- to clean the --\nyeah. Now, when we enter this territory, I say, there\u2019s women no more. There 1s no\nJewish women here, yes? The camp is not surrounded by -- by guards, there are a few\nguards which came with us, were outside, and they give us the order, clean these rooms\nand so on. And I cleaning this, and walking around this -- this buildings, I entered the\nroom where from the darkness of this room came a -- a woman. So I -- I ask her,\n[indecipherable] here? What they are doing here, in German, yes? And then she started to\n-- to talk too fast for me to understand, but I could understand that they are waiting.\nThey\u2019re waiting for something. I think they was maybe -- maybe I -- I -- I don\u2019t know,\nnow I -- I am trying to -- to fantasy. But maybe these Germans who departed with all\nthese Jewish women -- I don\u2019t know, but this was very difficult to -- to -- to -- to\nunderstand, because all these women that were in this room, they were sick. Typhoid, and\neverything, something like that. And they -- they look at me like I [indecipherable]\nmessenger that -- that the war is finished, you see, because they ent -- in they room, they\nenter not a German. A-A-And I say -- I couldn\u2019t say anything. I say -- I get out from this\nroom, yes, and of course, so far what -- what is later explained by another books, that\nthey came a car, this day, they loaded this girls, and they transported to the woods\nsomewhere, and all were killed. So I just wrote to get through th -- that probably I am the\nlast -- last one that saw your friends. A-And that\u2019s all. Of course, then, it came at order --\nevacuation totally, we have to go. But in one direction, not in the direction when Jewish\nwomen departed, or Estonian soldier departed. We started to be moved by an -- under the\norder of the SS at the time yet, yes, into the direction of Gdansk, to the north. To the\ndirection of that Red Army. And then, when we approach it -- I am talking more or less\nfast, we enter into the hand of the army -- regular army of the German. And we enter\nunder the command of the German army, and they say to us -- oh, they didn\u2019t say in this\nway, but you are the worker, you will work here, and you will do whatever we will give\nyou to do. And we were the worker to -- to dig the trenches, ditches, anti-tank, in the\ncertain territory of the predictable direction of the Soviet army. Of course, never\nhappened. So whatever I did, didn\u2019t work at all. So I -- I -- this is where my clear -- clean\n-- my conscience, yes, that I -- I was not a helper. So -- but situation was always this, you\nsee, when we transp -- we were transported on foot, and this the wintertime, and we are\ngoing against the traffic of the flicklinger, the -- the escapee of the -- all population from\nthe east Prussian. We were surrounded by such a fatije that it was a just impossible to\ntake a risk, because it was such a possibility that I can jump this -- mi -- my surrounding\nGermans, and to hide somewhere. But the chance was only one, yes? Either successful, or\nI am dead. There was no -- no other chance, yes, if -- there were -- when somebody was -\n- was -- if the -- some soldier, and especially the -- especial troops which were -- made\nthe order for any possibility of the desertion -- you see, I could be treated, yes, that I am a\nGerman, yes, who\u2019d thrown away the uniform, and he\u2019s now at hiding, yeah? So, in every\ncase, I faced the death. So, for me at that moment, my job then was follow up with them.\nAnd in this way, I -- I reached the point when we were taken away from the SS, because\nSS very fast started to vanish, yes, because we were approaching Red front, and we enter\ninto the hands of the regular army. And these were regular hand. I know that they were\nenemy, our, but they were regular army, like the Polish army who fought German. I -- I\nam recognizing any army as a army, yes? And they were German army, but army, not a --\nnot a beast in the form of SS. And they treated us -- but they warn us, you see, 1n this\ndirection, there is Soviet Union troops. And there are our troops. Now, if you want to be\nbetween them, you will be killed either by these, or by them. It\u2019s very simple, yes? So,\nthat\u2019s the one story. You know that I mention you, in -- during the coffee break, yes?\nBelieve me, I had a idea to reach the point that we would start to go into the west,\nbecause my dream at the time was not to come back to Poland, but to go to the west. I\u2019m\nhonestly speaking. Background of my action was, under this pressure, there was nothing\nthat -- that was waiting for me, because I knew what is there in the Soviet Union, and\nCommunist -- and -- and in this way, I reached the point when we were totally\nsurrounded. The only one way to enter the territory behind the Vistula River, and the\ndepression [indecipherable], we dig the dams, and we let water run into the depression,\nand we surrounded ourself in -- in Germany. The remnants of the army, yeah, by the\nwater. And -- and the fifth of May came for us the freedom.",
        "Q: And how did it come, exactly?",
        "A: How they come? I saw like a hooves, you know, cribe on the horses, with the flying\npapasha, you know this? And -- and when I look at this, they were very special animal.\nYou see, a very independent soldier, very -- I can say that there was not command for\nthem at that moment. They enter this territory like a conquistaros, yes? Everything, ah\n[indecipherable] you have the watch, 1 -- give it to me, yes. Everything was them. And I\nam not blaming you. Probably I would do the same, you see? But they enter, as I\nmention, like people not from Europe, exactly not from Europe. This was a -- I remember\nPolish army. I remember the Italian army who was the prisoner between us later, soldier\nfrom the Mussolini army. They came, and I met first military -- first Polish police, who\nentered this territory, because aha, when the Russian came, and we wanted to go, they say\nmilsha minadda. No, no, no, stay here. Oh, you see, this was a ha, now we are going to\nSiberia. Believe me, we know exactly. We already get before my -- before Warsaw\nuprising, that the Polish soldier from the Akar, Home Army, they were -- when they were\ncapture, and not killed, they were sent to Siberia. In the gulags at Heepalago. So --",
        "Q: Did they know, though, that you were from --",

        "Q: -- the [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- there was a thousand of people, Russian, Ukrainian, Italian, and Polish people, you\nsee? All the [indecipherable] not the German -- and there was a lot of that such a people,\nsurrounded -- you know, you never hunt the -- the -- the rabbits, or -- or this, when you\nhave the circle, you are circling a certain territory, yes, and you can -- and the -- the\npeople are approaching into the center of this surrounding territory, you see. You\ncouldn\u2019t see in the very beginning do -- the -- the animal. And then you see\n[indecipherable] and then is a boiling animals inside of this. So therefore, when -- when\nthe -- when we re -- we were encircled by the -- by the army, Red Army, and this army\napproached to the closer and closer to the sea, you see when I would -- I took the map\nwith me, to understand for you what the big territory was first surrounding, and then the\narmy started -- Red Army started to close it closer and closer to the -- such a small point.\nSo there was a thousand of people, yes?",
        "Q: But when they first came in, what was your reaction? Were you -- did -- did you feel that\nyou were being liberated?",
        "A: No, never had that feeling. Sorry. I never had a feeling that I will liberated, and the first\napproach was such I want to go home, and I hit the guards of the Soviet Union soldier.\nNo, no, no, there -- it was not looking for me, freedom. And now I -- listen to me. When I\nthen came the opra after three days staying in those woods, which was very comfortable,\nnice weather, we started to go outside, and press down is a prousht. And there they told\nus, in Russian but I understand. Go to the vieni commandant -- go to the military\ncommandant in -- in s -- Cherf to get a propouskou. Is a pass -- pass document to go to\nWarsaw. And this was a trap, because such a pe -- boys like me, the first question they\nask you, Atko darry? Where are you -- where are you from? Warsaw.

        "Q: So wa -- and what does that --",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Ah, what does it mean?",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: We were the enemy. According to them, we were the enemy of the Soviet Union. You\nwill follow me, and therefore, the only one solution for us is there -- to send them to the\nSoviet Union. You see, because we didn\u2019t fight with -- for God\u2019s sake, we didn\u2019t fight\nwith the Soviet Union, we fought with German, but all the time, in history of the second\nWorld War, sorry, Soviet army was our enemy from the 17 of September, 1939.

        "Q: This is an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, and this is with Tadeusz\nMarcha].",
        "A: Marcha].",
        "Q: And this is tape number seven. And what -- what I\u2019d like now is just if you can say very\nbriefly what happened to you in the couple years after the -- the -- the war.",
        "A: Yeah. But be-before I will answer, I say that my first contact with the Polish authority,\nwhich was a platoon of the Polish militia, young boys, maybe my age, they warn me.\nThey give me -- they gave me, in spite of fact that they were Communist, definitely, they\ngive me, \u201cHey boys, you want to be home? Forget about that you are from Warsaw, if\nyou don\u2019t want to be in Siberia.\u201d Exactly he told us this. So, I knew that this is the\nconfirmation what I was thinking. Okay, now, after the war, when I was come back\nhome, I found everybody survive. I found already my brother-in-law. I found Matchie\nShapinski. I found Zigmund, and a lot of my friends. And I -- we started a new life. Of\ncourse, in the -- but of course that we are in the same area, but my family was everything\nintact. Family, and yet, father, mother, brother and two sisters. The whole war passed\naway, and we survive. I was the last one. And again, like in my Warsaw uprising, my first\nday, I didn\u2019t find my mother, because she was at the Gdansk, in this territory, looking for\nmy body, because again came some messages that Tadeusz, he work in Sofenwalda, ah,\nyes, he had the problem with the legs. You know, what is the background my -- my --\npolio, he had a problem to walk. Not what -- not me, another has. That doesn\u2019t matter,\nmother came, found me in good, and we started life. Now what\u2019s happened to our family?\nI went into the school. Objectively I\u2019m saying that at that moment, Polish government\ndidn\u2019t recognize me as a enemy of Poland, because I never was, yes? I was enemy of the\ncertain system, but when I am not accepting something, it doesn\u2019t mean that I am a -- a\ncriminal, to destroy the system that I don\u2019t like. So I entered the Polish pri -- Warsaw\nPolytechnic, and started to education of the aeronautical department. And everything was\nbeautiful. I remember this time forever, as a very beautiful time, because I started to\ndream -- realize my dreams. I started to fly with the gliding glider aeroplane. Even very\nfamous kokoruznik that killed us at the -- at the fee -- on the field of -- of -- of grines. So\nI flew this kokoruznik, beautiful planes, absolutely. So I married, but 1t came -- because\nyou see, at the time was everything occur in Poland. A certain people were in power, but\nthen this power shifted. And there came to Poland so-called verification of the society. So\nthey started to select who are you, what is your background, and if it\u2019s not good, get out.\nAt that moment I was the assistant on the faculty of the Warsaw Polytechnic, and there\nwas a first e-e-e-exercise the -- this verification, and I get a paper from the rector, and say\nsorry he even not pape -- I get a paper, but he called me, and very sadly, he said,\n\u201cTindecipherable] Mr. Marchaj, you cannot be 1n the staff of our faculty, and it is not my.\nThis is the order, and I cannot do anything to do.\u201d So suddenly, I was cut off from my\ndreams. And this was a order that even it\u2019s forbidden for me to enter the airfield.",
        "Q: And then you end up in jail?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s the -- at that moment, you see, what\u2019s happened, I started to do this, I started to\ndream. I have to leave Poland, yes? I have to leave Poland, if legally, or not legally, I will\ndo this. And I started to plan to escape from Poland, very close to Stutthof. Vistula River.\nThe good boats, and to get out of this country, and going with the very -- speed boats,\ndesigned by us, designed by the proper, it was designed by us and prepared by us. And\nthese boats were faster than any boats in this area. And we had a very great chance to\nescape. But, I have the friends who are not very conscious. They st -- shared this -- our --\nbecause they want to participate in our escape, and one of the friends of the friends was a\nconfidant of the -- of the ed -- Polish secret police. And before we -- we make a first\nattempt to get out to the sea, we tested our boats on the Vistula River going into the --\ninto the sea, we were captured, and accused of the attempt to escape, in spite of fact that\nyes, we were thinking about, but there was not attempt, because we were not yet on the\nway. In -- in -- in front of us was still the dams, different passages sot -- forget it. This\nwas -- this was the first talking. We were -- now, ah -- yeah?",
        "Q: And what were you sentenced? I just want to --",
        "A: Yeah, no, I suppose. When they approach us to be arrested, the first called person was not\nmy brother, who was the older, but Tadeusz Marchaj. Who is Tadeusz Marchaj? Behind\nyou. Okay. They took me first. And accusation was that Iam a spy, American Capitalist\nspy. Because this guy who send the documents to the secret police, maybe to get the\norder, or a special award, and I was the e -- I was a -- on the faculty of the aircraft engine,\nand I was involved in the project to design the aircraft engine for the MON. MON, it\nmeans that Ministry Obronin Nardova. Minister of the Defense. Such accusation, being\nthe project [indecipherable] the designer of this, it was very easy to say, yes, quite\nprobably, let\u2019s tested him. And I was eight months investigated.",
        "Q: Okay, then if we can just -- cause I\u2019d like to finish this in the next minute or so --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- just that, what was your sentence, and --",
        "A: One in three -- I was sentence -- after eight mis -- months of investigation, I was\nsentenced to one year and three months. And, of course, when I get out from this, I\ncouldn\u2019t find a job, I was black sheep in Polish society. So again, I have to wait for the\nstalindai, and when the stalindai and chen -- there was some change, I start a -- can enter\nagains into the society, into the science work, and I started to work in Institute of Physic\nPolish Academy of Sciences in the cryogenic department. But again came the same. I\ndon\u2019t know for what reason, yes, they said no, you cannot go there, you cannot go there.\nYou can go dwe -- and so on. There was a -- again some oppression, yes? Political. And\nat that moment, I said to my wife, Festa, \u201cIf you would have a chance, go. Take the\nchildren. If you will get it, fine.\u2019 And it was such -- of course paid with the money, yes, it\nwas -- I was hostage. So she went to Switzerland, and then to America, to f -- he had a --\nshe had a family, and I was the hostage. And three years I tried to -- every possible\nattempt. You know, I tried to -- to bribe in very special way, the daughter of the -- of the\nsecretary of the Communist party, a very nice girl. And she promised that there will be no\ntrouble. And then no, came again -- and this is what\u2019s happened here. Maybe as a -- as a\nshock, because this is a -- we are stuck in the very big story --",
        "Q: No, we [indecipherable]",
        "A: This is my brother.",
        "Q: No, I know, and -- we c -- if you could just tell it really shortly, cause I just wanted to get\nthis at the end.",
        "A: Yeah, I understand. So -- no, toe -- I will -- I will not touch. Anyway, there was some --\nmy -- my brother was the very famous writer on the subject of aerodynamics, and\nhydrodynamics [indecipherable], and he\u2019s considering the word is a number one on the\nsubject. And he was a professor in the Southampton University in England. So, his work\nin -- in England, yes, created a problem for him. I was a hostage for my brother. But my\nbrother was thinking the same what I was thinking, and he didn\u2019t share this problem with\nme. He is tr -- he was trying to stay in England [indecipherable]",

        "Q: So that, hopefully you\u2019ll get a chance to tell that at more length. Is there anything about\nthe actual war that we didn\u2019t touch on, that you think you should say? The war, or\nliberation?",
        "A: You see, I was, as I mentioned to you, very patriotic, educated human beings. And I\ndidn\u2019t do anything wrong against my country, even the Communist country. I did\neverything possible for my Poland, yes? But I try to be somebody in -- in -- in Poland\nCommunist, and I was. I was a good student, I was starting to work.

        "A: Well, it means that especially -- may I make a -- a little bit comi -- to come back to the\nhistory of Poland, the society of Poland, to the people of Poland. You have to realize,\neverybody who want to understand Polish people, and their behavior, you have to assume\n-- not assume, have to recognize the fact that Poland didn\u2019t exist for 125 years. This\nmeans six generations of the Polish people were not Polish. You have to realize this fact\nthat people didn\u2019t know, after six generations, what does it mean Poland, especially that\nthe -- the recognizing country, recognizing the nation occurred very late in human history\nin Europe. This is the so-called, the spring of the nation, and in moment -- you have to\nrealize the fact that there was no German, there was no Austrian, there was not Polish\npeople. They were the principalities, somebody was Bavarian, or was the Silesian, was\nthe Galician, was the Pomac. People didn\u2019t know yet what does it mean Poland, they\ndidn\u2019t know yet what are Germany, they didn\u2019t know what are Austria, and so on. History\nwas the history of the big family, big kings, but not a big country. Big Germany.\nGermany\u2019s a very modern -- modern -- modern creature, I can say. And therefore, when\nPoland reached the independent, people within the territory, within the border of the so-\ncalled thow Poland, they didn\u2019t know who are they. There was a -- here in the United\nStates, you can find a group of Polish people gathering somewhere in the center of park,\nspeaking the same language, and asking each other, who are you? They are speaking\nSilesian. No, I am Mazurin, I am Galician, and I am speaking Galicia. I am speaking\nSilesian, I am speaking Mazurin. They even didn\u2019t recognize they are speaking Polish,\nbecause Poland was a -- a totally new element of [indecipherable]. So therefore, you\nrealize this sounded -- it was extremely important for the people who reach, and were at\nthe government, at the steering of the new country, like Pilsudski, Marshal Pilsudski who\nstarted to fight for -- for the freedom of Poland. They introduce a very strong, very -- no,\nthey introduce a histor -- education of histor. And at the time, we and my friends in\ndifferent country -- different part of the Poland, they started to be the conscious who --\nwhat does 1t mean Poland. What does it mean to be a Polish? Of course, in this\ndevelopment, there was a very big part of the Catholic church. This -- the church was the\n-- the first unit of the government, yes, to create a -- the -- to create am -- hard, that\u2019s the\n[indecipherable] you see the -- if -- if I would like -- sorry -- if I would like to talk in\nperfe -- about my profession, I -- I had no problem to find the words, and when I am\ntalking on this subject, I have a problem. So they started to create the conscious -- can I\nsay conscious?",
        "A: Consciousness of the Polish people, what does it mean Poland, yes. And very big\nemphasize in this consciousness was a -- that we are Catholic. And really, really there\nwas a -- 90 percent, yes, of suppold Polish people were Catholic. And therefore, in -- in\nthe -- in the school, ground school, and then in gimnasium, which is a correspondent to\nthe high school, there -- we started to -- not only to be Polish, but to cultivate Polish. And\none of these big movement in cultivation of the Polish -- Poland, was scouting.\nOrganization hartseffo, scouting.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Okay, that\u2019s a very, very basic question, because sometimes in America, I\u2019m trying\nto tell the people that I am a son of the slave. That is a big surprise. And if you would try\nto find a definition who 1s slave? The person which is taken away from home, from\ncountry, by some big power, to another country, to be totally without freedom, and to\nhave and obey the rules of the -- this who took him to another country. That\u2019s -- I\nunderstand the definition of the slave from Africa to America is exactly the same. They\nwere taken away to another country, without willpower, without anything, just to go and\nobey the law of the lord, yes? So this is my father. My father was from family where it\nwas seven children, and -- four son and three daughters, and this town, land where he was\nborn, Vol-Volbrum, in Poland, had to supply to the tsar of Russia, a soldier, forever.\nThey were taken away from this small town to, in case of my father to Petersburg to be a\nsoldier. Now why this happened, you know, there was seven, four brothers, and there was\na gathering of the family, because Volbrum, town Volbrum had to supply X number of\npeople -- soldiers to the tsar. So when there was a tragic meeting in the family, they say,\nnow Miko, Neho, you will go. And he was taken away to Petersburg, and this was\nsomewhere in the -- in 1905, something like that, maybe 10, ist -- I don\u2019t remember the\ndate. And so this is my father. My mother was a daughter of the family --",
        "A: With close?",
        "A: Okay, I am moving [indecipherable]. So, therefore my f -- so I mentioned who was my\nfather, and of course, even if I would like to ask at that -- at that time, who you were,\nprobably his answer would be, I am shlos -- Silesian. In spite of fact that he was talking\nPolish. He had no knowledge about the Poland [indecipherable]. Then he went to the\nPetersburg, and he was a -- I can tell you, very intelligent boy. He didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t was\n-- he wasn\u2019t there a -- a -- a simple soldier. He was intelligent, so he made advance in his\nranking. Of course, that he will never reach the officer\u2019s ranking, but he reached the\nstarshina, which means like a sergeant, starshina. Now he was taught not to be only a\nsoldier, or to give the orders to another soldier, he started to be a professional soldier in\nthe armament. He was a perfectly taught how to be with the armament. He was a\nperfectly taught how to deal with the armament, carbine, guns, and everything, how to\nrepair it, how to build it and so on. So he was out of the service of the soldier, he was in -\n- somewhere in the kazerna, yes, in the camp, or -- camp somebody [indecipherable]\nexactly it was Veeberg, which is now in [indecipherable]. And he, when the war came,\nwar -- the first World War, he was not a soldier to be killed.",
        "A: Yes. Because he knew well all the soldiers, and the first battle that my father faced, it was\nTanenberk battle, very famous battle, and he found the only -- he saw the battle after the\nbattle, and he survived this bacca -- the only because he was not in the first line. He was\ndelivering the armament to this killing. And he survive, and then he participate in the\nwar, later on the -- on the front, and the Austria, Italy, Austria, some went there. And then\nwas captured as a -- as a -- you know -- captured by the -- by the [indecipherable] army,\nso was the --",
        "A: By Austria.",
        "A: And he at that moment, he said that, I am with the Russian, yes? And Austria, they found\nhim very useful. Oh, we get a professional, yes. Let\u2019s use him in the manufacturing in\nVienna, yes? So he from the statusk of what is this, gefarn genay, now what is this\nAmerican English? Prisoner of war, yes? He was no prisoner of war, he was a worker in\nalready a certain industry of Austria. At that time, he met -- he send the letter and contact\nthe father, and father later came, and he made arrangement, better arrangement for him to\nbe almost like a worker, free worker. And awadi -- I have even the -- the picture of this\nvisit that, in my grandfather visit my father. And he was -- and this was the end of the\nwar, I mean, as you know. This is the end of the war, and Pilsudski, Leggionipulski, they\nstarted to fight. 120 soldiers get out from Krakow to fight for Poland. Do you realize this\nfact? 100 very well educated soldiers, under the [indecipherable] of Pilsudski started to\nfight with the three power European power, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Fortunately for\nPoland, all these three powers fought each other, in different combinations. So it was\nquite -- no, not easy, but 120 soldiers started to bil -- to fight and build the Poland. And in\n1918, when the treaty in Versailles, Mr. Woodrow Wilson, yes, was involved to promise\nPoland independence, and Pilsudski was at the moment leader openly. They gave Poland\nchance to be a nation as Poland. So I -- do you know [indecipherable] my father, yes. My\nmother was not the same story, but she was a daughter of the restorator in Slominik1. Is a\ntown of -- very close to Krak\u00e9w. And they met each other, they start to love each other,\nand they were married, yes, I -- I don\u2019t know, probably 18 or twen -- no, 20 -- 18 - 18 -\n18 they were married. And at the moment, my father, being in some way involved -- he\nwas in connection to the -- this military movement in Poland, and he entered Polish\npolice. Police, yes? And he was the -- again, in the county Keldsa, 1s a part of Poland, he\nwas re-responsible for the armament of the police. He\u2019s a -- you realize this was the year\n18 - 19 - 20, and now you -- maybe you know that -- that in 1920, Poland was not yet\nfully Poland, because there was on the east a growing Communist, a Red army attack\nPoland in 1920, with the full power they invaded Poland just to take Poland into the --\ninto the Communist [speaks Polish] I -- I said in Poland, in Polish. And at the moment --\nyou realize this [indecipherable]. Poland, they have two years of independence, two years\nto build the consciousness what does it mean Poland. They have to fight with the Russian\npower. Not only Russian, the whole Socialist block. And they were very badly defeated.\nWith Germany and Russian Red army was totally destroyed, which is invading not only\nPoland, but invading very weak German. This is the very crucial moment in history of --\nof the youth. Yes, either you will study some -- some historical period, 1920, you will see\nhow weak it was at the moment, Europe, to be captured by Communists. There was a --\nGermany was -- after the war, was totally destroyed. So, doesn\u2019t matter. In 1920 my\nfather fought as a -- as a soldier, again -- Polish soldier against the Communist Red army.\nAfterwards [indecipherable] Red army was defeated very badly, and the moment even\nPolish army ended up to the Kiev, very far, far, deep into the Russia. But, doesn\u2019t matter.\nW-We can say that since \u201920, Poland was a really [indecipherable], yes. So realize in \u201920,\nin 1939, 19 years later, we were invaded by Germany, and saw the killing again. But in\nthis period of 18 years, you have mi -- imagination how much we built in Poland.\nIncredible, incredible. We --",
        "A: He was very pacifistic, especially -- especially when we were espouting, yes, and we\nwere in some way paramilitary organization. So, a very good education, part of the Polish\nscouting, was the military decoration, to know everything about military, about the -- the\nsimple behavior even, but without using the weapon, yes? But basically again, how to use\nthe cartography, how to use the geography, how to use the knowledge of the medicine,\nand so on. This was a paramilitary organization with -- without -- no, with out the -- the\nleading us to the militaristic -- no, militaristic future. No, this was a -- do you know the\nfounder of this organization was in England, Badin Power [indecipherable]. Scouting was\na very broad movement in Europe. And my father was always, but don\u2019t think about to\nfight, because you are only -- you will be only the -- the target of -- to be killed. So he\nwas pacifistic at this moment.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: But he -- if there was some meeting in the home, yes, and they will usually, in the\nSunday, and we were very, very patriotic. And as you know, in every country there is\npolitical issues, yes? So, my father was -- was now oriented more to build the life, to\nbuild something good. And he said, \u201cDon\u2019t believe in everything what you are teaching\nyou in the school.\u201d And he said, \u201cThink independently what is going on.\u201d Yes, and he\nrealized this fact that Poland was so fresh, so unexperienced country, that he had a\nterrible problem. Minority, yes, Belarus, yes, and Cryena. Jewish people, some German,\nand so on. Even what I can tell you something about the -- how I -- how I lived with my\nfriend, the Jewish people, yes, because as I mentioned to you, my father, and my mother\ncame from the small town, especially later, I was very much more attached to the family\nof my mother, especially that my godfather was Jusef Meeta, was a soldier of the\nPilsudski army, a regular soldier. And he was the vouloust, a mayor of this small town.\nAnd he had a very -- my cousin, yes, were the same age, so during the vacation, either\nthey were in our home, or I was in their home. So this was like my -- the distance\nbetween my br -- I had it one brother and two sister. My brother was six years older. So\nat that year -- age, say 12, he was 18, there was no contact. So the contact was with my\ncousin, who was 12, too. And therefore I -- I was very close to the -- to the Titus\nKameeta, my cousin, and Barbara Kameeta. Titus, it was his name, Titus Kameeta. And\nlater he was a soldier of the -- too. And it doesn\u2019t matter, this is the case that I was in --\nattached, yes. In this town -- because I started to tell about the Jewish people, Slominik1,\nsay for example, it was a s --",
        "A: Slominiki -- Slominiki --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Hi -- I grew up in --",
        "A: -- yes, cam -- I -- I grew up, because I meant -- I didn\u2019t mention this, that my father was\nresponsible for the police department, armament only, yes, in Kelsa, and was a -- like a\ncapital -- county town, county town. This was a -- a 200,000 in -- inhabitant, yes, big\ntown. And so therefore, he -- I -- Slominiki was 6,000, and there was the -- we knew\n3,000 Jewish people. Now, that\u2019s the very -- that you -- maybe you are interested in some\nway, that similar way, Jewish people, if you go now back into history, they didn\u2019t know\nPoland. He came maybe when it was the Kasimiros del grossa in the 15\" century, when\nhe invade -- in -- invited Jewish people into the very big kingdom at the time, was\nPoland, yes? And probably his idea was to move to the new territory, which was at the\ndomination of the king Kasimiros, but in very peaceful way. Kasimiros del gressa never\nfought the war, and the -- at the time, there was a -- the greatest part of Europe under his\ndomination. You know, after ya -- Besarabia -- you know -- you know Besarabia Ukraina\ninto Lithuania? This was due to the m -- marriage -- married his daughter Elsan, they\ndom -- started to dominate this big territory, but not Poland. This was a do -- domination,\nthen th -- this was the aga -- under the -- under the [indecipherable] it\u2019s hard to say. It was\na governor -- king, no, under the how do we -- I lost the word. Doesn\u2019t matter. The\n[indecipherable] king, Kasimiros del grossa had the influence into the Lithuania because\nhis daughter was married to the agawar, or something like that, yes? And therefore, he\nstarted to enter -- the properties was his idea to introduce a lot of Jewish people, who\nwere the merchant, who were the professional in very many activity, even to -- to make\ndresses, to -- to -- to make a business, to do something, yes? At the moment Polish\npeasant, they didn\u2019t know anything about it, yeah? So therefore, and I\u2019m saying, in\nSlominiki there was a 6,000 inh -- in -- in -- inhabitant, and there was a 3000 Jewish\npeople. Who are they, who were they, yes? Professionals. Business, bakery, and another\nactivity of the merchant, yes. And at the time, when I was in the vacation, I played the\ngame like a kid\u2019s game with my friends Jewish. I -- up to now I understand such an\nexpression, hanush kamoyra? Yes, hanush kamoyra, this is the Jew -- Yiddish don\u2019t\nworry, hanush kamoyra. Or a -- or very many su -- such expression, yes? So we were\ntogether --",
        "A: Yes, playing the game. Now, I -- I met them later in the schools, yes, but they have some\ndifficulties, because they -- they were Jewish by religion. They didn\u2019t know Poland, and\nthe -- very little of these Jewish boys and girls, they were Jewish. And this was later a\nterrible disaster for them, when the German entered Poland. They were so distinguished,\nso different, that the German can very easy separate them from th -- and I am just saying,\nbut that\u2019s -- this is the -- I mentioned that in -- in my life, I know very well what it means\nto be Jewish, yes? You see, in the -- in this -- in this town, you can have it always some\ncuriosity, yes? You can distinguish the curiosity between these people. So I can tell you if\nthere will be -- if there were jokes, or some malicious action, they were not organized, or\nsomething like -- because they -- people were very different, so they will make jokes on\nhim, or something, some curiosity, like you know, this is the certain period 1-in -- in\nJewish that they are bill -- building the shackle -- so small -- small hut, yes? For the -- I\ndon\u2019t know, this is the -- to memorize the traveling across the desert since many thousand\nyears ago, yes? So, I remember this, that they -- they -- they -- they people, or see -- or\nlike me, I say what\u2019s this, and so on, yes? But this was a curiosity that sometimes you can\nmake a joke, yes? But this was not a -- something that I -- I -- I hate this, yes? It was only\nrecognizing that they are different. Okay, but this is the word what I said, now what I\nhave to go, because I lost my -- my -- my -- my -- my talking.",
        "A: Yeah. So, of course that my very young period in Keltsa was -- was n-not significant for\nme, because 1 -- I wa -- I was seven, so at seven years old, I remember very little about\nthe Slominiki. I remember my friends playing the games and this, or going for fishing, or\nswimming. Or going to the forest to pick up the berries. And when I -- my really I enter\nmore active life, when I -- when our family move from Keltsa to Warsaw. At the age of\nseven I was with family in Warsaw. What\u2019s happened, my father was transfer from\nKeltsa to the headquarters of the police in Warsaw to be responsible for the certain\nmanufacturing in the workshop, and equipment which was needed for the Polish police.\nAnd at the time, I was already a student of the ed -- en -- be -- of high school, my -- my\nbrother was already in the gimnasium. My -- my daughters -- sisters were in the same --\nin different gimnasium for the girls, yes? And in a moment, as I mentioned to you, that --\nthat contact with mother and father was a very -- very close, but you had no time to be --\nfor a very long time together, yes? This was only sup -- some days. But, in the morning\nyou go to school, after school come back, workshop -- homework, and that\u2019s it. My\nactivities a -- by -- after ou -- after school, I participate in bands to play the corono, yes.\nMarching bands, and activity of the scouting, yes? And this was a -- three times a week,\nyes? So this is -- my brother, same real story, yes?",
        "A: His name? Cheslof. Cheslof. He\u2019s a very famous name in -- in the work. I -- I will tell\nyou later. And -- and he was already studying [indecipherable] in gimnasium -- my sister\nwas in gimnasium, ri -- yes? My mother was a so-called housewife, yes? That\u2019s possible\nfor activity in the home, she had some help, yes, of the -- some maid from her town, who\nwas like a member of our family, forever, Helena Klanofska. And --",
        "A: Yes, ah, my sister was Yenema, and second Maria. Yenema, and Maria ga -- work in\ngimnasium that was a -- you -- you have to know that the gimnasium program was\nabsolutely the same in all gimnasium in Poland. There was no differences like here in the\nUnited States, that -- where you can study whatever you want. No, there was a program\nby the Ministry of Education, and the program of every gimnasium are absolutely the\nsame. And somebody can say, ho ho, this was the very fine matter to brainwash the\npeople, yes? Because you have a -- this is to be known for you. Yes, and no, but I can tell\nyou that in my life it was a positive, because this -- this program that was presented to\nme, I found that this was the very universal program. There was nothing very exaggerated\nto brainwash a young boy or a young girl. So, this is the time when we were to -- to\nPoland -- to -- to Rashava at \u201835, yes? And now is \u201835 [indecipherable]",
        "A: Aha.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Ah. I have the picture. Maybe later I will show you. Education -- my education, because\nit -- what I remember since 30 -- exactly, exactly \u00b033 to \u00b039 yes, it was that -- being a\nstudent. Making the homework, go to the school, come back, make homework. Some\ncertain activity assign from the marching band, and -- and -- and scouting. Is, of course,\nvacation, going for the camps. I\u2019m saying this way, this was a very nice, and -- and\nstraightforward activity prescribed by the almost Ministry of Education, yes? So, contact\nwith mother and father was duri -- usually in the s -- Sunday, or -- or something like that.\nNow, my father, in 1955, yes, he made a decision because of the heart problem, that he\nhas to leave police, not as a rent -- not how to say voluntarily, yes? He\u2019s -- he said, \u201cI\nspending police enough of my life. I am still young.\u201d He always underlined this, in spite\nof the fact that he was 50, \u201cthat I have to do something for myself.\u201d And believe or not,\nhe was a very successful contractor -- contractor. He started to build homes in Warsaw.\nNow, we started to live in the part of Warsaw which was so called Saskakampa. This is\nthe very close, the proximity to the -- to the centrum of Vashar, it was two kilometers.\nAnd when I remembered -- when we came to this part of the town when my father build\nthe first house, there was a fields -- fields [indecipherable] fields, yes? When, at the end\nof the war, there was a beautiful, I think most beautiful part of the Warsaw, as a meeting\narea, like a n -- those were not big houses, small houses. And 1n this part of -- of war -- of\nWarsaw, in Saskacampa, my father build the five homes. And our -- we -- we started to\nbe very rich now, very rich. You know what does it mean to be worth in the time -- of\ncourse my family [indecipherable] father is a hundred thousand dollars. It was a lot of\nmoney. And he -- while he was -- he started to do this? Because he was in -- Michael\nMarcha}, yes, he was always energetic and full of activity. What he did, he said, there are\nmy town, there are my friends from the young period, and he had work. Let\u2019s them be my\nhelper, that I will take them from Volbrum, or Slominiki, I will bring them to the\nWarsaw, we will build the contemporary barracks, and then we\u2019ll start in spring to build\nthe house, and at the end of the year, the home for stoies with -- were ready. And my --\nfor these people, who [indecipherable] brought -- they took -- physically come here, build\nthe barracks. They -- Helena, our maid, she was a cooker for them, and believe me -- and\nthey were paid very well. They paid not as a salary by week, or something like, they\n[indecipherable] in this way. If you -- by number of bricks, yes, they get the salary. And\nthey, at the time earned a lot of money in the one summer period. And they -- they get out\nfor the winter, then next spring they came to another place, and do the same. So my father\ndid a lot of this very intelligently, and giving the chance to his friends, and now they were\nso angry to be again and again, so even then selected another friend --",
        "A: Angry -- not angry, no, sorry, a wrong -- a wrong words.",
        "A: Eager, yes they were eager to come here again, even to bring a better friends, to do better\njob, to do more money, yes, because they were in some way. So in this way, y -- we -- we\n-- I remember this, that in the springtime there was a [indecipherable]. In the -- in the -- in\nthe fall there was a -- a home. And -- so this was that. And the -- at the time, nothing\u2019s\nchanged in Marrowshak. The way of life was the same. We -- we -- my father -- I say it\nwas worth a hundred thousand dollars [indecipherable] that he di -- he doesn\u2019t have the --\nthis hundred dollars to spend, yes. This was the -- his building the future that he\nrecognized the fact that money make money. You cannot stop to do this. He was in very\nbig contact with the banks. He had the open credit in -- in the very famous banks in\nWarsaw. The name of my father was known, and he was a good creditor, yes, yes,\ncreditor. And besides that he build the houses, he made a -- a street, also, with the water,\nelectricity, and sewer system. Everything was [indecipherable] so when my father started\nin the very beginning of the street, he -- he -- the end was -- is another home, yes. So this\nwas the [indecipherable]. And now, it\u2019s come \u00b039 -- 1939.",
        "A: Ah, oh, yes, I mentioned it. Of course you see that there was a church built in the -- in\nthis part of the town where my father participate a lot. And in the school, yes, as I\nmentioned to you, there was a program, yes, that y -- y-you can -- you were -- you were\ntaught by the certain rules, and our education 1n school was in Catholic education to\n[indecipherable] that we have, and say for example Jewish -- for example Jewish, and --\nor ukra -- Protestant, because I was in the -- in the state gimnasium, yes?

There was usually in -- in\ngimnasium -- government -- state gimnasium, mostly in my class it was three Jewish\npeople, and there was five Ukrainian. Is a -- yes -- no -- what is this in -- belief --\nOrthodox -- Orthodox Catholics, yes? So there they -- they did participate at that\nmoment, and this -- what they wanted to do depends on them. Yes -- during the -- of\ncourse, that -- when was that, Sunday, yes, and -- and it was summertime. I -- we were\nvery happy [indecipherable] because I played the march band, yes, we march band, so\nmany were to the church, and the gimnasium, went to the church in Sunday, yes?

We don\u2019t -- we -- we -- we sit on the greens, under the tree, with our\ninstruments, yes. We didn\u2019t have to -- to be -- to be in the church, yes, and we listen to\nthis, yes, you know, I am saying we are -- and it was -- you -- you realize this fact, that\nthis was something which is forcibly to -- to put on you, you are re -- re -- very\nresistance, yes? So at the moment, to sit on the grass was better than to go to the church,\nwe said. But this was a -- you know, and not very serious abuse of -- I believe, but just\nyoung behavior, yes.",
        "A: Yes. Of course that -- under very big influence of -- for me, was my brother. So he was\ngrowing more and more, and he was very seriously, and good educated in the technical\nschool to be a constructor on the planes, yes? Aeronautics. So, of course my dream was\nof course when I finish in this, my education in the gimnasium, I will go to Polytechnic to\nbe a constructor of the planes, and at moment I will tell you that Poland was in the -- it\nwas very good to build the planes. Really fantastic industry of the military plane and\nsports plane. Every year the great event for us was the challenges. It was such a\ncompetition of the old country, German, Italy, France, and Czechoslovakia the so --\nSoviet Union never, there was a competition to fly -- racing, yes? A-Across -- around\nEurope. There was -- all these plane was [indecipherable] beautiful, beautiful planes. This\nis the time when the first Atlantic crossing in the opposite direction from east to west,\nwas made by Scarlinski on the plane who was I don\u2019t know. The Spirit of Saint Louis\nwas about twice as bigger, you see what I\u2019m saying? You know what speed\n[indecipherable] remember, Spirit of Saint Louis. Now I can see it in the museum in\nWashington, and that\u2019s was -- it\u2019s -- I saw it in Poland, in Warsaw when Lindberg visited\nPoland and with the san -- Spirit Saint Louis. I remember up to now this -- this especial\n[indecipherable] but special pattern of the heart of the engine made in circles. You can\nsee this very easy, and I remember this, even this detail, yes. So I -- I was very\nenthusiastic about the -- the planes, and another even was the gol -- golden Bennett\nballoon competition in Poland -- in Poland. It was a very, very, very nicely developed\nPoland, in 15 years of Poland existence. A lot of good teachers, scientists was\n[indecipherable] by the -- by the society.",
        "A: Yes, but this was -- this was something that I never agree with my father. It went that he\nwas in, at a certain time, not actively, not by his tek -- life experience, 1n opposition\nwhat\u2019s happening Poland. You remember the Pilsudsk1, 1t was in my -- my god, yes? You\nbelieve or not, I have here in my wallet his picture. And because I never forgot at the\nmoment that he and 120 young people started to build the Poland, fight for Poland. Of\ncourse that later, this called the first brigade, this wa -- so-called. Piersha brigada, the first\nbrigade. All these people were very educated, very aware people, very good educated\npeople in military and professional. In the process of the development of the country, and\nadministration of the country, a little of these people, very good people, as a soldier, was\nnot necessary very good to be in government. And my father, because he was more\nactive, and he has a very open eyes as a business man, yes? He say no, these people are\nnot very good. So don\u2019t believe everything, you know? And this was in some way in very\nmalicious -- not malicious, how to say distortion, yes? The very famous song of this\ngroup of people, yes, was [sings in Polish]. It was such a melody, and it was very often\nplayed during these festivities, yes? So my father s-s -- found the song a little bit\ndistortion, he say, \u201cDon\u2019t give me everything what they are singing to you.\u201d This was\nalways a warning for my father. But politically, he was not a politician, and politically\nPoland was in statoos nastemi, s-speaking in Latin, the state of to be born, yes? So we --\nwe have no knowledge what does it mean politics, yes? This new cadre of the people,\nyoung people, like a new generation which were growing to reach for this power, never\ndid it, because of the war --\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: -- me Greek.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s Teddy, I\u2019m Ted.",
        "A: Scouting organization, as I mentioned in the very beginning -- you know the very\nbeginning in the meantime. Well, this was a movement established by the Baden Powell.\nHe was a -- some officer during the first World War, and he had an idea at the time, so far\nas I remember that people has to do something to avoid war. So this was a -- 1n some way\nI -- I mentioned that like a paramilitary organization, but strong emphasize that the war,\nand fighting will never be used. So shortly is picking the education in the scouting\norganization, it was rather to present the history of nation, if this -- in Poland there was\nPolish nation, or in France French, or in England. And this was a -- maybe this is a -- in\nsome way, a -- a contradiction, that we were educated militarily, yes? But there was never\npresented to us that we will be a soldier. And -- but this -- maybe somebody who -- who\nin Poland was in the command of this organization in Poland, maybe they have some\nhidden idea. Let\u2019s keep some cadre, some basic people who will be educated\npatriotically, and paramilitarily, with some knowledge of the survival, yes, in every\npossible way, and let\u2019s to exercise this, yes. So let\u2019s go to the forest, let\u2019s go to the\nwoods, and do what we want to do. That\u2019s a -- in the United States you have this\norganization up to now. I don\u2019t know how the -- how they are calling here, is --",
        "A: Boy Scout, yes, Boy Scout, yes. Same story. And in 90 percent, it was the same, but with\nsome addition in Poland, that we have education in Polish army, yes? But not army, m-m-\nmilitary education that\u2019s safe -- soldier were taught, yes? And you have to know that in --\nhad the -- one of the Polish town -- I am saying Polish, because it\u2019s no more Polish, but\nhe was always Polish, this Lvov. But this is strange, because I don\u2019t want to abuse\n[indecipherable] Cryenian, who claimed that Lvov is L\u2019viv. Because really, Lvov is in\nCryena, but it was built by the -- historically, by the people from Poland, from the\ninfluence of the kings, and the big town was like a island in the ocean of the Ukrainian\npeople. So, really, it is a Polish town, but is a Ukrainian town. So why I\u2019m mentioning\nthat, in the fight for this -- for this town, participate a lot of young people, with the\nbackground of the scouting, the youngest soldier in that time, and were called -- and even\nthere was a very famous cemetery, which was destroyed during the Soviet occupation of\nUkrainia. And now there\u2019s a big issue between Ukrainia and Poland, how to rebuild this\ncemetery, which is a very sanct -- sanctisimus place for the Polish people. And not to\nabuse the Ukrainian. You have to find the modis revendi between the Ukrainian who hate\nPoland because of action of these small kids fighting for Lvov, and now this cemetery\nagain. And so they are trying [indecipherable] but I think that -- I hope that there will be a\nsolution.",
        "A: Y-You see the -- it will be hel -- very proper to say that at the time I had no time to think\nabout it. This was a -- scouting was such a big pleasure even to -- to do this or that, and\nso on, if this is the military or not military. There was a something that is needed, I think,\nfor the young people. And -- and therefore the -- this movement of the scouting, Boy\nScouts in America, is still in existence, yes? Or I -- I don\u2019t know if it will exist farther,\nbut there is a need for this, and there was a need for us. And what -- what I was thinking,\nfirst of all, that anyway, if there was a so-called zbouvika is in Polish, the meeting, yes?\nMeeting of the -- say, a group of -- is very difficult for me to say, because maybe there is\nano -- I cannot translate. Zasta. A -- a group, like sa -- shortly speaking, but the\ndoushina, means a unit of the same gimnasium, was divided in -- in sastempai. Doushina,\nthey consist with say, seven, eight groups of, and every group has a different name,\ndifferent flags, proportion, different distinction, and so on. So there was, in some way, a\nvery visible military influence into this group. But believe me, I never in my -- at the\ntime, in my mind was a feeling that I will be a soldier, yes? We didn\u2019t think about that,\nbut very soon, it\u2019s happened that we started to think 1n this way, when the war came.",
        "A: Oh, oh yes, yes, every -- I can tell you that 1 -- this independence of movement, and --\nand the reading the maps. When he -- I remember they lost my camp, that our group shot\n-- | have to g -- [indecipherable] backwards. My group of -- of this organization was\nplaced or attached to the gimnasium. This was a pack activity of the gimnasium\neducation. I -- my gimnasium was called gimnasium iminya, like airport in New York,\nhere in the Washington D.C.\u2019s, Reagan\u2019s and so on. So this group was Iminya\nTerayousha Raytanna. And it was a very historical, patriotic man who fought in one of\nthe uprising against the partition, and he was very famous fighter. He was captured and\nexecuted in Poland. Tadeusz Rader. And -- no do -- Rater, sorry. Raton, it was a fighter, a\nlegal fighter for the 1m -- for the Polish constitution, during the -- now the -- th-this group\nwas name Iminya Romwilda Trowaguta. Romwald Trowagut. This was the gam -- man\nwho fought in Polish uprising, one of the many of Polish uprising, and it was executed in\nSitadella in Warsaw. So, y-you can see, the name of the gimnasium is some fighter. The\ngroup of the s-scouting is Amoura Trowguta, and this was the Vuda -- WDH,\nVudabashefska Doushina Hertesk. Iminya Rumwilda Trowguta. Number one. We were\nthe black one in Warsaw. Very good and known Doushina. And now I am coming back\nto the -- to -- to continue what you aski -- what you were asking me, il -- and this was?",
        "A: Survival skills. So therefore, the last vacation we had in Lithuania -- now, in Lithuania,\nbut at the time, was Poland. And why Lithuania was Polish, because you have no -- that\u2019s\nthe whole Lithuania, I will have no problems with it -- with Lithuania, because you can\ngo to the Central Park in Manhattan, you can find the -- the monument of King Leogarro,\nwith the two swords, and there is written under the pedestal, of this monument in Central\nPark in Manhattan, that this king, and Queen Yadiveega, it was the first confederation in\nhuman history of the two states peacefully. Lithuania and Poland were built now\ntogether, big, huge country, yes? So peacefully created, not -- no single blood was flown,\nyes? So, in Lithuania, of course that after the war, first World War was finished, a lot of\nsmall countries claim their right to be independent state. So Lithuania was such a leetva --\nwhatva -- Estonia, yes? These country were built due to the treaty in Versailles after the\nwar. Now, a very powerful man in this political movement was Pilsudski, who created, as\nI mentioned to you, there was hundred -- with the two hun -- 120 soldier he went to fight,\nand he was born in Lithuania, in the territory of Lithuania. And he say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s mine,\nand forget it.\u201d\u201d Yeah, he -- nobody can do this, and he -- if -- he said, \u201cIf some -- if the\ntreaty will not accept it, we of Poland, so we will fight.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, he -- it means that every s -- I mentioned only that the one of my last scouting -- two\nmonths I spend there, the last, but in the meantime I was in manning, previously. But this\nwas the more -- my heart, I was lost there, in Lithuania. This is such a beautiful country,\nthat you have my imagination. And it -- in the nature, the rivers, history. The Polish\npoetry, like Padameetskavi is one of the Polish biggest poets. He was born there, too, and\nhis biggest poem was related to the Lithuania. His poem -- he opens -- he opens this\npoem, a very famous poem, Pamapdayoush, he open in this way, [speaks Polish]. I will\ntranslate. Leetfo -- my fatherlike -- my -- yes? He, in some way, he is not saying that\nLeetva was totally not recognize. It was always recognize, yes? But these Lithuanian\npeople -- strictly Lithuanian, they -- they accepted this, oy -- and they are always saying\noh, adam mitskabich. He is a Lithuanian, sorry that he wrote in Polish. Yeah, but this 1s\nthe case. So -- but this is only a certain animosity occurred because of the proud, yes?\nToo much proud. And now, personally, yes, I am answering the question. Lithuania is\nLithuania. I know that this is the place where he -- Jusef Plusetti was born, and Adam\nMitskavich was there, but Lithuania was Lithuania. So maybe you -- on this case you will\nfind my character in some way, that I am not a chauvinist is very -- how to say it? Is not -\n-] am not a chauvinist, shortly speaking, yes? So, I am open-minded, I want to respect\nthis, and bart -- what I\u2019m saying, that I love Lithuania, doesn\u2019t mean that I have\n[indecipherable] Lithuania is mine. And now, in this -- in this territory, survivor. In some\nway military education. We get the military map, very accurate, you know, one kilometer\nwas one centimeter. And we get a one Polish zokey -- money. And we get our task force,\nsay. We are going from here to here, in three days. You have to pass these -- all places,\nand this is the straightforward, not roads, because there wasn\u2019t roads, yes? You have a\ncompass, map, money for survival in the case that you can buy something. And you have\nto pass this route going from the place to place, and you have to get the stamp from the\nauthorities of the village, or some places. There are -- you -- y-you realize this fact, that\nin every village, there is a so-called vuid. I don\u2019t know how to translate it, yes, who --\nwho is administrator from the government side, yes? Now he had the stamp, he sign it,\nand so on. And in this way, you have to go by three days, alone, through the forest, from\nplace to place in three days. Of course, we did it sometimes, these routes in the zastiempi,\nin the very small group, yes, five, six, seven boys. Same [indecipherable], yes? Now y --\nthis was so-sometimes more difficult because a route was made by the -- our leaders, yes,\nthat you have to cross the river, yes? It was a no mo -- no bridges, yes, you have to find a\nway that you have to be on the other side, yes, and so on. So this was a survivor. This was\na very, very difficult.",
        "A: At that time I was 13.",
        "A: I did it. I did it. I can tell you that the one -- no, this -- this -- this last one was -- I was 14,\nbecause you see, I now recognize this fact that my route was drawn by our leader through\nthe military exercise polygon. You know what does it mean? A polygon? I don\u2019t know\nhow to translate.

        "A: -- oh, training ground. And I approach my g -- then, and there was a post of the soldier. I\nsay, \u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d Did you hear what there is going around in here\n[indecipherable]. And you hear, [makes whirring sound]. The guns shel was passing, and\nwhum! Yes, there was a so-called [indecipherable] it was not a ex -- 1-it was a -- the shell\nwas a real shell, yes. So if I would be there, I could be killed. So at that moment I opened\nmy map, and asked to the soldier, he was very respectful for me, oh-oh. So no, no, so you\nhave to go -- you have to go now this, this, this, and so on. This was another six\nkilometers more, yes, and I did it, yes. A-A-A-And this was a -- a very big pleasure.\nAdventure. Adventure not only this, because you see, I -- when I have to go and to sleep,\nof course I can do this. On the ground, with my, you know, rucksack, yes, backpack. But\nthis is a very romantic [indecipherable] of Poland, that there you have small houses, so-\ncalled -- you see, Poland are very attached to the nobilities, but nobilities -- not only very\nhigh ranking nobilities, you have a certain gradation of nobilities from grafs and so on,\ngoing down, down, down, down, and you have a nobility which we call in Poland shlakta.\nIt means that these were the previous soldier in the kingdom, yes, that they get the certain\nprivileges from the king, including the -- what is this, coat of arm, yes, and name of this\ncoat of arm. And they get the right to build a beautiful houses, small houses. Even -- I\ndon\u2019t know if -- if you have a picture of the sort of house that you could see, it was the\nhouse where the [indecipherable] was born, and he lived there. Such a small house. And\nwe -- crossing this country, we tried to find such a place. And we get there beautiful -- no\n-- treatment, yes? But very -- but this is -- was a dying, dying history, yes, when I came to\nsuch a house, and there was this sitting old man, and he, \u201cHey, boy, what are you doing?\u201d\nAnd so on. I say, \u201cMay I ask you, sir to spend the night here?\u201d\u2019 Ooh, so at once he called\nsomebody [indecipherable], \u201cPrepare this room for this boy,\u201d and so on. And this was\nsuch a nice -- and you are [indecipherable] homes full of history, full of different picture,\ncarvings, and so on. Beautiful. So this was the -- my -- my experience of the -- such a --\nexercising this scouting.",
        "A: Health, oh. It went that -- I didn\u2019t mention very important fact in my life, that being four\nyears old, I was a victim polio, in Kieltsa, there was epitome 17 cases of the -- of this\nillnesses, and -- and I was paralyzed at the time from the -- the lower part of my body,\nand -- and therefore as -- as I mentioned is that I have a small compart with my brother,\nbecause when I recover, and when I started recover my ability to walk, I was cripple.

And step by step, day by day, year by years, my\nimprovement was very big, and -- and I -- I recover almost all my ability to walk, and to\nthis extent that when I was say, 15 - 16 -- this 1s the occupation time, I had no visible --\nvisible -- no visible effects of this. And at the moment I remember that when I was\ntrained by the very big sportsman in Poland, the medalist of the Olympic games in Berlin,\n1936, he train us to jump. He was a -- a dec -- decathlon -- decathlon. And he exercise us,\nand all the -- you see this the occupation like maybe we will [indecipherable] to this\n[indecipherable] in occupation.

He,\nas a award, he was sent to Paris on the Internationale Exhibition of the Aeronautics, as a\nstudent, and he did a -- such a gift from Polytechnic. And he was traveling from Paris to\nGermany to Poland.

Then was an action of the Czechoslovakia. And this was a very big shame for\nPoland, that\u2019s a terrible. You know, the German enter into the certain territory of\nCzechoslovakia. Poland enter at the certain territory of Czechoslovakia einder, which\nPoland claimed that this is the Polish. And this is a shame. I -- I -- even at that time, my\nfather -- oh, my father was terrible. What they are doing? What they are doing, you\nknow? And you know, Czechoslovakia under the big power. And [indecipherable] you\nsee, there was -- this will never happen when Pilsudski was, only now, only now. This\nwas the -- this -- his officer, you know, from the peersha brigada, you -- you follow me?\nThese people did a very bad historical movement.

So, y-y-you -- you know that this was a -- and therefore, as I\nmentioned, this is start to grow our concern, what will happen, how will we -- how will --\nwe will be -- how will we behaves? And then was the first demand of Hitler, yes? That he\nwant to have the -- a railroad line across the Polish territory from Germany to East\nPrussia. Then, started to claim the Dansk -- Dansik is German. Absolutely ridiculous\nbecause you can call the any time -- any town, you can call it, because the Gdansk is a\nharbor, was created by the Hunza. Hunza it was a merchant organization who, along the\nshore of the Baltic Sea, and North Sea created the harbor for the merchant. For the\nhandling, for the transportation of goods back and forth, yes? And Gdansk was built as a\nharbor in some way by the people -- not the people, by the company -- like you remember\nthat -- what is -- what was Carlotta in the very beginning?

        "A: Yeah -- oh yes, absolutely, I -- I remember everything this day, this morning. I opened\nthe radio -- no, uh-huh, first of all, I not yet know. It was already the preparation for the\nwar was ordered in some way that -- of course, I know I -- lucky guess, but I knew,\neverywhere, people are doing up to now, they saying, we -- we tape the window glasses\nby the paper, yes, to avoid when the blow will hit the glass, and the bomb, and there will\nbe no shrapnels from these glasses, and you will avoid -- first of all, you are\nstrengthening this window, and you are avoiding the splintering of the glasses. So I, at\nthat moment, day before, and at that morning, I was busy to tape the windows. And I\nopened the radio, and I hear the pom per om pom pom per ad da da da dum. It is Polish\nanthem playing, and then there will be a -- appeal of the president Ignacio Mashtitsk1.\nAnd I am listening. Today at five o\u2019clock, German army crossed the border. We are in\nstate of war with Germany. I jumped on the balcony, my father was doing somewhere,\nand I said, \u201cFather,\u201d [indecipherable]. I say, \u201cIt\u2019s a war.\u201d He didn\u2019t recognize what I am\ntalking about. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said, \u201cIt is a war.\u201d And at the moment I remember that his voice\nburst into the cry, \u201cWhat?\u201d Once more again he was asking. I say, \u201cIs a war.\u201d And he ran\nupstairs, and was listening, and he said -- because he knew, he knew [indecipherable].\nThere is no chance, yes? That\u2019s end. And of course, this was beginning of the episode of\nour -- we are calling this rising -- not rising, jammi, because the -- very soon knew, of\ncourse, that we saw this first battle fight -- fight by -- by the planes over the Warsaw, this\n-- you know, this sounds of the machine guns from the area [makes machine gun noise].\nThis was a fight in here. And then came this morning, a [indecipherable] with brother of\nmy father from another part of Warsaw and bring this big, huge part of the bomb. And\nsee, because there was a, \u201c[indecipherable] bombing? No, that\u2019s not true.\u201d And he\u2019s\ntaking a [indecipherable], \u201cLook at this, what does it mean?\u201d And then was a appeal of\nthe mayor of the -- of the -- after a few days that the eight of September, that appeal to\nthe people that all mens who are able to carry the duty, they have to lead the force in\nPoland -- Varbarshava, and have to go into the eastern direction. And now, my brother.\nHe was a worker in the Institute of Aeronaut -- Aerodynamics of the Polish -- Polish nay\n-- Polytechnic, he was the worker at that time, scientist, and -- not scientist, mo --\nscientist, yes, part of the -- of the staff of the Polytechnic, and they got the order for\nevacuation of this institute into the east, too. And he was separately, he -- he\n[indecipherable] say, \u201c\u201cGood-bye, maybe we will see each other,\u201d and he gone. And then -",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes, he-he came to the home, he was prepare -- he took the rucksack, he would\ntake the -- some blankets, and so on, and he departed with the Institute of Aeronautactics.\nAnd I -- I was at that month, as I say, exactly 14 - 15, I begin. And ha -- my father told\nme he is decision family, we are leaving Warsaw all together. Mother, father, me and two\nsister. And we started to go, yes, and this was the hour, no, or the saya, no, it\u2019s not the\nsaya, this is -- was a -- hard to say, this was big tragedy because hide -- at the moment I\nsaw everything possible that war is giving us. We started to go with the crowded roads,\ntogether mixed, the soldier, people. One is going this, another is going this. And so on, in\na couple hours they are flying these planes, German, and bombing these, and you can see\nmore and more graves, killing horses and so on. Smell of -- of war. You can see burning\nhouses. And this was a -- because this is -- this was a first experience of this. And we\ndidn\u2019t walk too -- very far when we were [indecipherable]. I think 1t was 17 September.\nWe were in the very small village, Kitchkee, I remember forever, and we get a message\nfrom the soldier, that Soviet Union is fighting on the eastern -- our border. Is attacking us\nfrom behind. So our departure into the east was useless, yes? So therefore my mother,\nand my father yes, they made a decision, we are staying here in this village, and we will\nsee what\u2019s happen. And Warsaw -- and very soon we -- oh, we -- we had a contact around\nthere, for the first time, you know, my father was -- I considered my father that he is a --\na little bit coward. I always consider his resistance to do something that this the sign of\nhis cowardness, which it was -- which was wrong. And maybe this --",
        "A: I -- coward, coward.",
        "A: Coward, yes, so. Some sort of coward. H-He sm -- his resistance to do something, to be --\nto be patriotic and so on, because he [indecipherable] father, but there was one day, when\nwe -- everything was just in one bigs mixture of the army, this army, Polish army, almost\nlike a partisan war. And in one place we were on -- on the road in some -- a crossing\nroad, and suddenly, unbelievable, Polish army is gone, yes? Cars, cavalry, yes, and the\nrunning, and my father, I -- I saw his first time that he jumped because he was a\npoliceman, yes, he was -- he knew what is going on, yes? He jumped on this criss-\ncrossing of this lot, and asks of this commander, \u201cWhere you want to go?\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWe want to go there, and there.\u201d So [indecipherable] like aragu -- you like be in the\nRussian [indecipherable] yes? With the commander of the -- at the -- at the corner of the\nstreet. This way, this way, yes? So he did -- get, and he stood in this criss-crossing, and\nhe say, \u201cThere are German in opposite -- not Germans backwards.\u201d It was like this Polish\narmy went like that, but German was on this road, yes? My father was standing and\nsaying, \u201cGo there. Not here, not here, because there are the German.\u201d So they -- they\nwent there. Believe me it was in one minute my -- my father was still standing on this\ncorner, and dshhhooo, they are going the -- the German -- German -- the -- with tanks,\nand the tanks, and -- and military [indecipherable] armored [indecipherable]. And he had\nenough time just to jump out from this street. And the people [indecipherable] want some\nof the action. And then these people entered on the lot where the -- these Polish troops\nwent, in some way creating impression that this road is not used. And German, they was\nconfused, they went to go, and ssshooo, went there. Of course, that this was not very long\ntime because they have no chance, yes, and sooner or later there was five. But not at that\npoint. And moment I see, ho, ho, ho, my -- my father is not -- is not a such great coward.\n[indecipherable] I can say. This is the os -- episode of this. And then we stay as four --\nfour more days and then we get a message that Warsaw, on the 27\" of September,\nsurrounded. [indecipherable] town for -- fort -- this was big tragedy, you know this was\nhow badly was demolished for -- we might -- that\u2019s the first victim of my family. A girl,\nthree years old. It was a daughter, it was my cousin, daughter of my -- of brother to my\nfather. He working in hospital by the bombing. They -- they bomb everything. Hospital\nwere not respected. So she was dead. Of course, then there -- we came to the Warsaw,\nfirst contact with the German.",
        "A: Why?",
        "A: No -- we knew it, yes, already, yes. We get the message that the Soviet Union is fighting\non this part. So our -- our looking for the freedom in the east, it was just dreaming\n[indecipherable] bad -- wrong thing. So why don\u2019t we -- let\u2019s go home. Come back home,\nand then fine, we would find what we -- how this new time will be, and we\u2019 ll see -- and\nwe approach the Warsaw, and there was a [indecipherable] German surrounding the -- in\nthe Warsaw, and -- with the guard still standing, aiming into the Warsaw, and they say,\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d In German, and \u201cHome,\u201d yes? And they just resp -- not\nrespected the -- kee -- making such a movement [indecipherable]. And -- and of course\nthat -- only this street, not -- not something because you can have some mine -- some --\nyes, because there was some prepared by the Polish [indecipherable]. So they have to go\nonly this [indecipherable] and the -- at end of the day, we -- we found a home, not totally\n-- not destroyed, but there was na -- no window, yes, everything was blown away. And\nthat home was still home, yeah. And this 1s the beginning of the occupation. Of course,\nthis is the beginning of a new chapter which -- which is a -- very long, because we -- we\nwere, as I mentioned to you that suddenly the whole life was wiped out. No supply, no\nelectricity, no water, this, and so on. So we started -- and winter was very severe, you\nknow, at the time. [indecipherable]. Big frost. But we managed to -- to cover everything,\nand ha -- ha -- and ha -- and this is the case. So September, October, we started to dream\nabout the school, and I was already in -- visitor the school, asking the professors if we --\nwhen we will started to do something, and so on. Yes, [indecipherable] were enthusiastic,\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we will very soon begin.\u201d And so on. So we did it. The school started. But\n-- because there was not even from the German side, there was no yet -- not yet order\ngiven. They didn\u2019t know what they will do with us, yes? And -- and after a -- say two\nweeks of our presence in the school, in the di -- director, Yeski said, \u201cAnd now we have\nto wait what the German authorities will give us. But be will contact with us, because if --\nif we will have no permission to open the gimnasium, we will do this secretly, yes.\u201d Yes,\nin Poland, you have the whole education system working in conspiracy, including the\nuniversity.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: So, as I mentioned, in the very beginning of the occupation, we went to the school, for\nthe very short few weeks, maybe days, it\u2019s hard for me to remember. And then, when we\ncame one day, and that director of the school, Yarosh Yishki, his name, and\n[indecipherable] what\u2019s means honey, he was such a sweet man. And he said, \u201cWe will\nbe in contact with you, either when will be a commission to do something legally by the\nauthorities, or we will start to teach you in conspiracy.\u201d Of course, I think that it was\nsomething very hard for me to remember the exactly -- but in the very beginning of the\nspringtime, it was organized by the German, so-called -- I -- I will tell you in Polish\nmaybe, because later I will try to translate it is [speaks Polish] grade two. It means that --\nmeaning this was that the -- are the schools preparing the student for the profession --\nprofession. Zebador. It means that this here, the time you can see, yes? That the German\nestablished the -- that we can learn something, but only to be a, say, professional, like a\nmechanics, whatever is, es -- mechanics, I don\u2019t know, carpenter, anything. It means that\n-- meaning of this arrangement was just to -- that description of the future Polish people\nis to be a worker, slave. And I -- so we started in such a school, but of course it -- the\npicture were the same. So between the program established by German, there was\nsecretly delivered history of Poland, language Polish, and this what was strictly forbidden\nfrom the -- to -- to maintain the identification of the -- identity of the student, yes. We are",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, and no. It means that history, and so on, was made on the complete -- we are\nsaying complett -- complete a group of students, yes, assigned by the professor, they were\nin private apartment, yes, and there was a teacher, yes. But if there was a legal given, say\nfor example this was a -- no, just writing, yes, you know, you have to teach the writing,\nand -- a-and some grammary, and so on. So in this class, there was a 1 -- Yensik Poleski\nwith the literature selected for us, almost according to the program established by the\nMinister of Education in Poland, which Germans say forget it, yes? No, we did it. And\nbesides, at that moment, conspiracy wi -- to do something illegal in the school, it was\nmaybe illegal for the authorities, but it was not illegal for us, because you -- we identify\nus very easy. We know who we are, and there was no totally for -- not the foreigners no,\nthe strangers, yes? So we know that we are between the Polish student. So this was easy,\nyes. It was because I say, but something that was strictly forbidden, like history and so\non, we made it in complete, 1-1-in -- in -- in totally di-different places, yes. But something\nwere -- was, according to the Ministry of Education, Polish, yes, was made by the\nprofessor voluntarily, yes? In spite of the order of the authorities. Because there was no\nguards standing in the school, yeah. And this is the case. And at the same time, yes, we\nscouts, our doushina, the first WAGD started to operate. So we had -- we started power\ngathering, yes, continuously, like nothing happened. But not in the school, but\nsomewhere.",
        "A: Yes. We know each other, yes, very good. And there was a certain kierarchy in our\ncommandant, yes. And there was a meeting, and the first meeting, say for example I was\n-- | was in the group with the -- the name was lion -- lion, roar, roar. And at this meeting\ncame our higher commander, and he say, \u201cWe will do this secretly as previously.\u201d Of\ncourse that you are now total -- and it was not yet very well, in the very beginning,\norganized, but the system started to operate that there was a certain schematic\npresentation. The line of the command, yes. Because there was such a line of command,\neven in the scouting, Polish scouting, yes. There was a hartsmish, you know, or -- or\ncommandant of the rayon -- region of Warsaw, then you have this. So this was starting to\n-- and this was the very beginning, there was not yet -- because you realize this fact, who\ncan -- who could do this? We. And therefore, we are the group that we started to operate\nin 1940, in March, as an organization. We have already more or less established the\nschematic line of order, yes? But of course, we didn\u2019t know what it was, yes? And these\ndocuments were collected, and were in storage later by the special emissary, yes, who\ntraveled. Later, was organized quite eerily, the day where the couriers that crossed the\nborders going through Yugoslavia, Italy, to this way, to search for the -- to deliver the\nsecond document. Then when this was established on the military bases, because the\nintelligence of the -- of the -- of the British, yes, was involved in this, yes, to -- to fight, to\nuse a people certainly, to organize people in Poland as a help -- as a resistance movement.\nAnd these certain documents were transferred. And believe me or not that my documents\nI found not in Warsaw, I found in London, exactly my name and my sowdo -- sudo, yes?\nSowdoyen, yeah? It -- it was, and it, up to now. And those documents I have here. And --\nand -- and of course that this what was scouting. It was like a signal to the higher\nauthorities, yes, because you -- y-you realize that the Polish government in exile have\nhere the representative in Poland. And they started to organize the very well military\norganization, yes, military. Spy, and so on. But -- but this scouting, yes, this was like a\nsignal, do something because people are, yes? And --",
        "A: Signal to the higher authorities --",
        "A: -- from the representative Polish government in exile in England, they have here the\nrepresentative, yes? They have -- it was already -- it is very hard for me to -- to tell you,\nbecause I -- I know, and I can find it yes, very easy, 1-1n -- in the documents -- historical\ndocument, yes, how this was established, day by day and so on, and who was the\nsaygoneero grotrovetski, yes? It was the first commandant of the -- of the home army.",
        "A: Ee, yes, yes, except this was -- y-you have to realize that it was a big chaos, yes, chaos,\nyes? And -- and there was a -- nothing was -- 1-1t was completely everything in ruin,\nmilitary, militarily. Poland as a militare was not existent. But they were a scouting groups\nin Warsaw, and these groups was very -- very few of them. You see, all together you can\n-- you can find that there was as about 3000 in Warsaw. But these 3000 give the idea that\nthis is possible to do, yes? And now, Polish government in exile, started to organize this -\n- from the very beginning, by the nomination of the existing officer of the Polish army,\nand so on, and this was nominated that he is the -- responsible for this, this is responsible\nfor this, and so on, so on. And these organizations started, but this was one year later,\nyes? And the system was this, that sharda sheray, yes, in -- with the scouting organization\nwas called gray troops. Like, I -- I can translate in this way, but sheray shalagy. I have\nthis small anchor, there the symbol, symbol of -- of -- of this organiza -- this scouting\norganization. I -- I maybe -- maybe later I will show you this. And this scouting\norganization were this more mature, and more responsible authorities, yes? They get\ncontact with everything, and at the moment they fight. This 1s the case that we are now,\nthis organization from England, this we are recognizing, you know? But we have to re-\nestablish our skin. And they say no, from 18 up, yes? They say. From 18 up, they are\nrecognize as a member of the regular [indecipherable] so-called first what ZWZ. Zionvic\nWalki Zibronia. And then this or -- this even organization was not yet very well\norganized. The next step was the Akar, Armia Krajowa. Because the Zedvouszet was\nanother spontaneous organization corresponding to the Farasheragi, but not yet\nestablished and connected to the government in London, yeah? Then when government\nunde -- no, on all these groups found the table to talk -- not to talk, this -- this was not a\npolitic, yes, but to establish the action, yes. And say, for example, that there must be only\none organization, yes? So therefore, we were part of the Armia Krajowa. The Akar,\nHome Army.",
        "A: Yes -- no, no. At the very beginning -- the very beginning, I was 15 - 16 - 17. But, I will\ntell you that we -- we made a very professional job. First of all spying. Collection of the\ninformation of the German army movement. Collection of the information of the location\nof the army -- German army, storages, and so on. I had -- besides, there was like another\nvery intelligent sabotage. You see, Germany used such a slogan, All redare meesen rollen\nfeerdon zeke. Always have to roll for the victory. So they give us a signal that we have to\ndo something, that this raider -- that this will -- will not roll. And there was a very small,\nvery nice sabotage, which was easy to do by us -- for us. To see -- to pour the sand into\nthe bearing of the wheels. So every person --",
        "A: Sand into the --",
        "A: Bearings.",
        "A: Of the wheels. You know, in the railroad, what is axle? And you have two wheels, and\nyou have here the box. And in this box 1s a -- a system that is greasing, yes? This. This\nwas easy, quite easy to open on the cap of this, and put the sand. So, if is -- it was\npossible in some way to do this, we do this.",
        "A: Ah, what time is it?",
        "A: Yes, immediate -- we had the gathering -- we have the meeting places. It was everything\ncoded, yes? There was a -- if we use between us, say what will be the meeting, so we said\noukashki, or w-whatever, you see? But this was not really my point, yes, exactly the --\nwhere you are -- we meeting out outatka, yes, and ya -- Aldoni Street, yes, no, no. It was\none words and we know where to go. The name -- there was no more name. I was boy,\nyes? Not Tadeusz, not Marchaj. Boy. It was enough to know, aha, that\u2019s him. Another\nstory where we participate. The system of the printing, of the legal -- 1-1 -- illegal\npublication, you know, it was a such bulletin information Army Krajowa. Bulletin, you\nknow, is information of the Polish army, yes? And then was the messages, articles. It\nalways like a paper, yes? Not very often, not every day, there was every two weeks and\nso on, but it was printed. Of course, if somebody was caught on this, he has only one\nchance, he will be killed. By himself [indecipherable]. Y-You know, [indecipherable].\nTherefore the transportation this, I unders -- I remember that I was four times use, only\nbecause this was from the system of conspiracy, I cannot be used every time in a row.\nThis was distributed, this duty, by somebody, yes? Well, fine, you have to go this and this\nplace, and you have to deliver into this into space. That\u2019s it. Even there was no name,\nnothing, yes? A s -- small amount of information of this. Even I would be captured, fine,\nwhere did you pick up this, yes? At the corner of the street, somewhere in the bushes.\nOne point is done. Where you have to deliver this? Into Dehosher Street in Warsaw, yes,\non the stairs. And so on, that\u2019s it. And this what I know. And -- and who give ma -- ask\nthis order? It was totally unknown for me.",
        "A: Verbal, yeah, yeah. Of course, that did -- we had 1-1 -- is -- it was not operatable.

Just simply he was tortured to death, and we don\u2019t know\neven where he was. And we have two of them such. This is me -- in Auschwitz is a -- my\nanother cousin ferder my mother. Yes, he died, yes, he was just -- he went to the\nAuschwitz, and then after, quite a short time, he was -- he vanished, yes, perished.",
        "A: Yes, it means that -- no, no, these cousin -- these cousin that in the summertime, Kitous\nand Barbara, they were spare, if I can say it. It 1 -- 1t is nothing happened to me, but his\nfather and my -- my grandfather -- no, and -- what does this say, I said not the\ngrandfather, he was a godfather, yes. He was when the freedom in the first day of so-\ncalled freedom in 1945, he was arrested by the ent over there, and he went for a few years\nin the gulags in Donbas. When he came back, big man, he was -- weighed 40 pound -- 40\nkilos, yes? So he was skin, and this. And he came, he was at least to die here. Yeah. But\nthis is -- what I am saying, another part, because this is after \u201945.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Of course you know that my -- my brother, you see, besides of the certain -- the\nproblem of the family problem, he was at this age, yes, that he tried to do something on\nhis own, yes. He -- he -- I was dependent on my -- my parent\u2019s care, of course that I\nwork, as a worker somewhere, to earn a little bit money. And my -- my -- my son -- or\nmy son, my brother, yes. He started to work somewhere in the certain company who\nbuild something in -- what was the bwonia? Some place they build some roads and\nsomething like that.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. He Warsaw. And then in -- of course it -- 1 -- 1 -- y -- y -- you -- you can -- of\ncourse he was in the conspiracy, university, he studied. In the very beginning he now --\nyou see, because he -- he left home -- home was always home for every [indecipherable]\nyes? If he had a idea ha -- I was to do something, yes? He went, and he tried to earn some\nmoney, yes. But generally our home was base for us -- for us. And in spite of, I would\nsay, somebody at the age of 26 or something like that, they should be independent. But\nthis was a very special time, yes, that -- that his profession was very good, in the\npeaceful, when he was working in [indecipherable] army, where you have the\n[indecipherable] in -- 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- during the war. So there was a -- the -- we tried to\naccomplished our I-life almost day by day. You see, y -- I say, when I started to work\nsomewhere, yes, that I have [indecipherable] work for half year, yes. And I earn some\nmoney, yes, to help the parents. And then, you see, at that moment, this is the case, which\nis worse to -- to lie about it, how a empty place, when the Jewish people were eliminated\nin the life of Polish peop -- of Poland, in this vacuum place, th -- another people entered.\nAnd they started to make a business, yes, a business, make a life what since thousands of\nyears, yes, Jewish people did all over the world. In some way, this was -- call it\nopportunity, i-it was a empty place. Suddenly, from -- from the town of Slominiki, 3000\npeople vanished. We -- this was not action of the Polish people. They were taken away by\nthe German according to this Final Solution, yeah. Of course, that -- what is here the\n[indecipherable] now I will -- I am antery with something. You see, people always\nidentified the same by allegiance. Majority of the Jewish people in Poland were Orthodox\nJewish people. Very -- they established they life in the Orthodox way. You can see, yeah?\nHow? Black suit, a special hat, the -- this now, what is this, paysa -- paysak -- th-the --\nthe air -- hairs, yes, are long. They -- they were -- even they will try to hide, they were\nalways recognized by Germans. You follow me? Now, in the very beginning there was\nsome promises given to him. Oh, we are sending you to another establishment, and so on.\nAnd now I am coming to the very, very special situation, and we -- our family, and\nJewish people. In our home, in home that was base of our family -- this was a nine\napartment house, there was living a couple, Mr. Majinski, Rudolf Majenski e Stefania\nMayinska, that was known for my parents. Later I was informed by father, because he was\na great conspirator, I didn\u2019t know that they were Jews. I -- I knew only when something\nhappened, very dramatic. My father knew it. Now, who was my father? I tel -- I told you,\nmy brother was in organization Armia Krajowa, I was in organization Shara Faragi\nbayana Krajowa. My sister, one younger sister was in Armia Krajowa. The older sister,\nshe started to be married, so forget it. No, Mother was not, but Father was, and I didn\u2019t\nknow. But officially, yes, he was in organization so-called Zhigotta. Where did you hear\nsomething like that? Zhigotta was a selected -- is not military organization. The purpose\nof -- existence of this organization was to recognize potential enemy of the Polish people\nin this territory, and protect the people who need the protection in this te-territory. And\nfather -- because my father was a previous policeman, he had a contact with the Polish\nprecinct, because during the war there was a German police, and there was also called a --\na -- another pol -- police which cooperate with German. Yes, big name cooperate. In any\ncountry you have to have a police, so it\u2019s better to have the police -- Polish police than\nGerman police, yes. So this -- in this policemen, there were people and people. Y- You\nfollow me, they were -- because if somebody\u2019s in the power, and he want to do this, and\nthis the war time, fine, I -- I\u2019m a god, yes. So he used the power for the wrong purposes.\nSo my father had the, in this precinct, a very -- policeman who were very sure like he\nPolish, yes. I can tell you that my first shooting with the gun was -- but shooting only for\nexercise, yes, was I used the gun of the policeman, who gave us ammunition, and he go\nand try to shoot, yeah. So there. And my father was in contact. So through these people,\nhe knew a lot of the different things that will happen and so on. So first Majinski, yes?\nSunday, there came a message from the police precinct, Neho, Majinski sa -- are the --\nthe conspirator. Next day there will be Gestapo to take them away. Now, you realize this\nfargit, to be involve, if -- if you will prove it, Gestapo will prove it, yes, that you are\nhiding these people, physically, yes. Now, say for example that somebody has a hidden\nplace. Fine, at the moment if such a case happen, this family who try to hide these people,\nbang, bang, bang in spot. In this case, not -- my father was a owner of this home, so in\nsome way again, this police -- because the -- the police shoo the duties, yes? So my father\nget a message, warned them to get away, because they will be destroyed. And in some\nway this policeman from the precinct presented this case maybe to Gestapo maybe in\nsuch a way that may be presented the Marchaj, Neho is a -- is a owner of this house, and\nlook at this, this pi -- yes. They didn\u2019t know. That simple. He and she, they were Jewish,\ndefinitely, but I didn\u2019t know -- they are Mrs. -- Miss -- Mrs. Majinska, Stephania was the\nchairman of the very ca -- very known in Poland charity organization for the poor people.\nThe Mr. Mayjinsky, Rudolf was a -- a doctor, at the age at the time about 70. And you see\nth -- you -- you have to know that there were cases that some Jewish people met and\nother Jewish people who were involved in something, and he just send the message, oh,\nyou are this, here, and bang -- zekonds perasi, a-and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: It means that the message came to the -- from Gestapo to police precinct to prepare\naction. But by this bypass to Neho Marchaj came from this policeman who knew, get the\nmessage from Gestapo that they will be taken away. So now, ma -- Marchaj, as I\nmentioned to you, he was involved to -- to search for such information, so fora -- my\nfather, police precinct was a source of information, too. Of course h-he had averiman\ninformation -- I don\u2019t know even, you know, I -- how broad knowledge of my father was.\nSo he -- they were taken away at once. My father found the place. They were taken away\nabout six, seven blocks in the same area, in south Katinpatou, and vanished, yes. The --\nthe pr -- the wa -- the -- the -- the -- the table in kitchen was arranged in such a way that\nthese people left this place almost half an hour ago, yes? It was a still hot water, this and\nso on. And really, next day came, and they found empty, empty, empty room. But of\ncourse, all -- me, father, me -- mother not, but me, brother and sister, the -- we get out\nfrom this, no -- because we didn\u2019t know what -- what will happen, yeah?",
        "A: Yes, he arranged the hiding place.",
        "A: Yes, so -- and they survived. You know, they survived later, they -- they -- they found\nson of the Majinsky, Stanislau Majinsky and Hilda Mayinsky, they were living in\nSaskacampa, and they survived -- all survive. And the next day, they came back looking\nthat this camouflage, yes, that they departed was just coincidence, only maybe they will\ncome back. They came back, the Gestapo, and found the apartment in the same way. So\nthey get the knows, yes, they know -- they knew at the time, yes, that they get out, yes.\nAnd at that moment, why my father was badly beaten by the -- by this German -- by\nGestapo, and they throw him into the basement. And believe me or not, Stanislau\nMayjinsky, who was the witness, who came the same day when Gestapo come back again,\nhe came to ask father about something, but he ran to the different apartment. My father\nwas beaten and that\u2019s it. Now, what\u2019s happen only, and this is --",
        "A: Beaten, yeah. Only f-from this, you know, from this hatred, you know, that somebody\u2019s\nescaped, they have no proof in some way, maybe as I mentioned to you, maybe in some\nway Gestapo was involved by somebody from this precinct. Not mar -- Marchaj, he\u2019s a\nowner, and they make it a lot of maybe some movement, Majinsky? They are Jewish?\nYou follow, they -- you can do something if you ca -- if you -- if you want to do\nsomething. So happily, yes, happily, it was not very big damage to our family, yes? Now,\nanother story of action of my father. He had a friend. I don\u2019t remember now his name, but\n-- first name, but I remember very good name, Sigoua, who was the machinist of the first\nclass machinist before the war, and first class machinist either are leading the -- in the\nexpress train, or the freight train. The -- the -- to -- to -- to -- to be machinist of the\nexpress train, obviously has to be responsible man. In same way, if you are making a\ntransport of the freight train, very long, loaded and so on, a first class machinist has to be.\nOne day, and I was witness at that time, he came to our house, and very moved, and he\nsay, \u201c\u201cNeho, I was in the [indecipherable].\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d \u201cI delivered the transport\nof people to Birkenau, and do you know, I didn\u2019t know that I am going there, because I,\u201d\n-- at that moment very rare, was -- 1s -- was not yet very public, yes? Maybe such a case\nis like Sigoua case. Send the message to the world. And he said to my father, \u201cThese\npeople went for dead, to be killed. And I saw it by my own eyes. I was inside a delivery\ntrain to the -- to the oven.\u201d And he described [indecipherable] and say, \u201cI cannot drive\nnow, unless I will do something.\u201d And he asked my father. \u201cPlease, I want to change my\nname, I want to have the document for me and my family. I want to have a place on the\nnext train, but not with the people, but some military train I will derail.\u201d And that\u2019s\n[indecipherable] he got a new document, and his name was, I remember Bojenski, they\nchanged name to Bojenski. He left home, took family, and vanished. And as he said, with\nthe transport of the military train to the east, with his -- and for this man was prepare the\nsame, yes? And he derail in this special place, he know what to do, how to derail the\ntrain, yes? You know, at the certain point where it was a curvature, and downhill, yes, he\njust put the full fa -- power, and jumped from the train, and the train [indecipherable].\nAnd this is the history [indecipherable]. So this is what I\u2019m saying.",
        "A: This was just after.",
        "A: After. But I was the witness when he was talking about this -- Birkenau.",
        "A: Yes. When he came to my father, I was present. When he was talking about where he\nwas, and what he did. Because he was -- he suddenly feel guilty, but he didn\u2019t -- he -- he\nnever knew, he got a destination point this and this and that\u2019s it. They -- they not inform\n[indecipherable] Mr. Sigoua you are taking the train with [indecipherable] to be -- Jewish\npeople to be killed, no. So this was a -- two occurrences where I know. I can tell you only\nanother, that when my father died --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, boy. You see, this was a nightmare for everybody. This was a nightmare. You see, 1 -\n- especially, you see, I have no thoughts or feeling at that time, but you know, later I was,\nafter the war, one of the first visit to the south when I was again visiting my parents, yes,\nthe -- say, godfather, yes. I visited the -- the Auschwins.",
        "A: Auschwitz -- Auschwitz. I visited almost -- I can\u2019t -- no, I don\u2019t want to be cruel -- not\ncruel, but to hurt somebody by telling. It was almost hot, because this was in -- in -- I was\nthere in May after the war. So, \u201945 May. I never was yet at the time in Stutthof when I\nwas a few times ish -- in -- in Birkenau. Oh, Birkenau was absolutely terrible, especially\nwhen -- if you are visiting Birkenau, or Auschwitz, or if somebody is making the picture,\nmovie, it\u2019s just impossible. You have to smell this. You have to -- to touch this mad --\nthis -- this -- everything. But y-you see, that\u2019s a -- and what -- what is our reason 1s just to\navoid this, but not by the remembers. Of course we remember, but to do something that --\nthat people will make a conclusion frim remembrance.",
        "A: Do you know -- I will tell you something, what\u2019s a -- what was the occupation? You are a\nsubject of the German power, not a object that you can do something in reality. You were\nonly a hunted animal. Do you realize how many places is in the Warsaw where 40 people\nin spot were shot? Dra -- men remember, yes, a special plaque built into the wall. Is over\n600. This is only the every day -- daily bread, I can tell you. So this was not a sensation\nfor us at that moment. This was normal, yes? You are -- you were -- you left home going\nto the town, yes, and suddenly say, very usually -- usually this was the place, your train\nentered the bridge, and suddenly -- this was always the point where you are crossing a\ndangerous line, yes? Because very many times, you have to go to the bridge because you\nhave to go from here there. But one end, and under, then suddenly you see the crost by\nthe -- by the police German, yes? And then trains stop and they are coming to the -- get\nout, you, you, you, you, this way, please, this way, yes? There were special -- we -- we\ncall it buda, vudit, yes, a keester, a case, or I don\u2019t know how to translate swo -- the word\nbuda. And they load it, and usually these people who were in such a car, never come\nback. Now, during the war, lo -- you have to be in some way -- you have to use the\nauthorities of German, and therefore I -- I will mention for you who I was.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to memorize -- to recall. The first rule of conspiracy is the secrecy. So, my\ncontact, and everybody contact in organization, where the final solution could be a debt,\nyes, there were maintained very certain rules. Don\u2019t talk too much. If something happen,\nanswer only questions. You cannot go beyond the questions, because you are introducing\nyourself in very big trouble. Of course, in our organization, yes, we were divided in the\ntroops, yes, so they say we -- we call it a gathering, it\u2019s very hard to translate, grupavania.\nThat\u2019s a very big unit, grupavania grove, yes? What does it mean grove? Is a part of the\ntown, grove, and this was a grupavania. And this grupavania, this group of certain part of\nthe town was divided in the section, or -- boy, oh boy. Platoons, yes, 1s better, yes? And\neach of these platoon have the number, and who knew? Who is in the -- or leader of the\ncertain platoon? It was known to the greater ka -- hierarchy, yes? Probably even in\nLondon archives was only all -- not archives, in London possession was known, I\u2019m\nguessing only, that they knew ours grupavania grow to even in here, in grove grupavania,\nthere was a leader of this, and he knew who is under him. But in general, yes, how is\nrelation, like say for example, as grupavania grove to -- to the commandant of the Armia\nKrajowa. Like Groetravetski, yes, General Groetravetski, he was captured, and -- and he\nwas hold in the Mauthausen for a very long time. But anyway, he was killed. Then it was\n-- after him was General Burkomarosky. So this was known for very few people, who is\nthis man, and what is his name? I didn\u2019t know -- I knew -- I know now, after the war,\nwho was my -- or when -- when we started the open fight during the Warsaw uprising,\nno, it wa [indecipherable] it was everything open, yes? Because there was a meeting of\nthe -- of the leadership, and they knew this, this, this, and at the moment when they knew\nwhat\u2019s the name, inu, and everything. Family name. But during the occupation I can tell\nyou that I know rish my -- my leader of this platoon, I knew who is his -- and of course, I\nknow him. I know who is the -- how say, the second in row, yes. His pseudo name was\nHinshaw, and then ma -- it was my friends. Friends who are the member of the platoon.\nAnd there was as has -- seven -- seven, and everybody has a pseudo, yes, and we know\neach other. Between us there was no problem, yes. It was a -- I know that he is in my\ntroop, and of course that he is my soldier, yes. And at that moment, of course, sometimes,\nwe exercise, of course, some youth -- youthful stupidity, I can sell you, that we tried to\nprove how we are very resistance against the pain, yes? We could say, [indecipherable]\nyou Gestapo will touch you, and they will be investigated, and you will be beaten and so\non. Did you say who is next to you, and so on, and so on. So I remember that -- of course,\nas I said, stupidity, because later, when I was really in prison, I don\u2019t -- I can tell you,\nprison in the Communist Poland, and I was investigated for a very long time, I didn\u2019t\nknow myself. I didn\u2019t know myself, camut -- how much I can stand. So, you see, what we\ndid, we sometimes, to prove it that I was such a resistance to pain, we -- we --\ndistinguished the cigarettes on the hand, without crying, yes. You know, very naive. But\nwe did it, this was the -- no, I -- I call it this is stupidity because -- because the facts\nwhere it was, you were in the hand of the oppressors, yes. At that moment is the best way\nto die as fast as possible.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. This was the boys from -- I can say, our block, yes. The same -- the same\nterritory, yes, Saskacampa. And say all of my friends in the -- in the block, three, four\nblocks area. Of course that this is the -- and in these four blocks there was a few platoons.\nYou see, everybody different. And anyway, we knew because we were in same block.\nAnd I can tell you that say now we are entering -- we are approaching to the -- to the\nWarsaw uprising. So I was attached to the platoon, I -- I have to -- to check it exactly,\nyou see, but later I will give you a proper -- proper number. We are assigned to the\ncertain targets for the Warsaw uprising. Fortunate then -- not fortunately, our platoon --\nfew of them, too, because th -- we -- we were not only we, because there was another.\nOur goal was too attack the -- the building -- school building, which was the quarter of\nthe SS regiment. You have an imagination that, you know, even [indecipherable]\napproaching the day, D-day, these are the -- the first of the August, when we started the\nWarsaw uprising, but you want to touch this problem now, or you want to --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You say it, I\u2019m trying to the -- you see, this is such a -- such a difficult problem. See, I --\nI will tell you that I participated as a courier, yes -- not a courier, carrier, carrier of the\nbulletin informatseeni. This was used like il-illegal publication which were printed, I\ndon\u2019t know where. What I know, that this assignment came from my platoon leader, yes?\nI mean, he say, \u201cBoy, such and such a day, at this and this time, you are going to the\nstreet -- Stanislau Powgas Street. There, in the certain point, there will be a package. You\nwill take this package, and you will carry this package to the -- to the center of the town.\u201d\nI -- remember which is forbidden, it was -- but then not to remember, but -- sorry is this\n-- you cannot have a [indecipherable] and you cannot stop to remember certain fact. So\nwileeta Hosha Street, and we stare ar -- to the certain point, there will be a box, you put\ninto the box, and that\u2019s that.",
        "A: Yeah. I did it, period. Yeah, now, another story. I -- I know because this is related to my\ncourier activity. About how we are e -- how we -- we will use the authorities German, as\na protection. So I work for a few months or half year. I have this document\n[indecipherable] but I don\u2019t remember now that I was a worker in the manufacturer of the\nelectrical batteries, yes? Which were produced for the public, yes. Of course, if this such\nac -- such a situation it would be worth to make a sabotage, yes, I would be used. Say,\nfor example, to put something into the mixture of the battery, to make this battery work\nless after short time, yeah? But anyway, I -- I stop to work this, because I found a better\nsolution for me, and a protection that I was -- it was so cold luft shutz heirbdidst. I am\nsaying in German. It means that the LHD. And this was in translation a service for the --\nfor the fire department help. The front start to approach Warsaw, so Warsaw was faced it\nwill be bombed, we will have the fires, and so on. So German authorities organized of\ncourse in certain way, the fire department, yes, to make this fire department better\nworking. To build the retention in vessels, 1 - dig in the wall, in the earth, to collect the\nwater for -- to -- for the fire extinguishing. And this service, according to my morality, I\ncan say -- not only morality, but my -- my understanding that my work is not a work that\nwill support German military activity. Because this what we have, what built, 1t was for\nthe protection of the civilian people in Warsaw, yes. And it was a good protection for the\n-- another authorities of German, because it had a s -- let\u2019s say certain how to say\ndocuments, yes? That such and such person is working in department of the -- say fire\ndepartment in Herakoska traga, yes? Will be s-stamp with the -- with the say vrona, say\nthe German eagle, you know, this hakencroitz? And in the case of the wapanka --\nwapanka, that\u2019s was very popular way hunting for the people, as I mentioned yes, that\nthere\u2019s a bridge, they stop here, they stop [indecipherable] and get out, yes? And they\nyou, you, you. And that moment, say, for example, this was a document that I could show\nto the Germans, yes, that I am loyal to them, I\u2019m working for the fire department, which\nis a -- I don\u2019t want to use this America -- American expression, a work [indecipherable]\nfor -- my work was [indecipherable] but it was working, by even this was not working so\ngood, because this German who a issue as this special document, they said, \u201cBut if you\nwill be in the wapanka,\u201d you know, in this stoppage and selection, \u201cin the very beginning,\ndon\u2019t show to the authorities, because could happen,\u201d [makes tearing sound] \u201c\u2018and you are\nnothing. So, hold 1t when you will go to -- for the investigation, at that moment, take it.\nAnd it is possible, they -- they told us, that if s-somebody from the febia will know that\nyou were captured, send a message to the fire department, and fire department will know\nwhat to do.\u201d You see, there was in some way, between the Polish people, and even with\nthe German, because who was this fire -- fire fighter from the German side? He was\nanother professional firefighter. He was not there from Gestapo, he was not from\n[indecipherable], he was professional firefighter, to fight the fire. So they know what to\ndo, yes? And at that moment, these authorities will go to the German Gestapo, or\nwhoever is, this and will reclaim you, unless you are not carrying at the moment weapon,\nand -- and you are -- you are subject to another activity of the -- of the Gestapo. So this\nwas say where I participate, in ahardai elijli to protect myself. Now -- now what was the\nsi -- very frightening situation? My father was a conspirator, so -- and I was carrier of the\n-- of the certain technical documentation or information, or so-called publication. And I\nwas neglecting a lot of safety factors. So when I have a package, which I don\u2019t have to\ndeliver, strictly from point A to point B, but sometimes I get it, for the distribution\nbetween my friends, yes, in Klaus, and I have to keep it because I -- I couldn\u2019t take it and\n-- and go, no. So I -- I put in different places, yes? I hide it in different places, and I -- I --\nI keep it for one, two, three days. My brother was arrested by the Germans, and he was in\nterrible trouble, yes? On the basis of the certain -- not a military activity, because he was\na soldier of the army -- Home Army, but for the -- to earn some money, he was involved\nin certain activity -- I can tell you, simple. The alcohol distribution, or production of the\nillegal alcohol, yes? This was against the German law, but not military law. And my\nbrother enter a big problem of this, and he was taken by the German authorities to explain\nhis activity, because he was, according to the German law, he was a parasite in this\nsociety. Yes he had to go for the so-called forcible work. He went to the concentration\ncamp, could be sent. But now, how the sociality -- sociality, yes? No. What is this na --\nname in -- very famous person?",
        "A: Celebrity. He was in -- in -- in Gestapo hand, first, at the very beginning. And there was a\nvery famous, in Poland, sportsman, as I mentioned few hours ago, that train us. It was\nAloukelski and Gerouto. Gerouto was the decathlon, and Aloukelski was the javelin\nthrower, and jumper, and so on. And both were Olympian. And, believe it or not, even\nGestapo recognized an Olympian, because he was Olympian in Berlin. And believe or\nnot, he went to this certain ranking officer of Gestapo, Mr. Gerouto Rito, and he say fine,\nI -- maybe I can help him, yes? It was a very big risk, yes, because he was a Polish, but\nhe has all these documents, and so on, the Olympiada in -- in Berlin, and he went into the\njaw of the beast to -- to try to do something in, and he did it. He recognize him, okay, ma\n-- yavolt, in German, fine. But he\u2019s a very bad guy, he\u2019s a parasite. He will go for the\nforcible work. Okay, and we know, yes, perhaps he will be transferred from this prison to\nthat prison. But this other prison was only the holding place, yes? And they were German\nbut not Gestapo. And there, if somebody has again connection between the people -- the\npeople, yes? You can pay the bribery, and he gets free. And this happen. And my brother\nget out from there. Okay, so one -- one case is okay, but now what to do with this\nbrother? He has to have some -- some documents, yes. So there was a [indecipherable]\nokay, so you know, I was in the -- 1-1n the fire department, so just what, I have to do this\nfor you, and you will be a firefighter, and you will have this document, that minimum\nthat you have to have, you know. Because you cannot be -- survive the occupation doing\nnothing, or -- you see, because this is what the first act where you were stopped by the --\nby the German, yes, documents. You are somebody or not, working or not working,\nuseful or not useful. Why? Because they need only to have the hostages, or something. So\nif you have this, fine, you are in some way prepared. Now, how this related? Of course\nthat this is a meaningless situation, but I\u2019m saying how life was in Poland. I put the -- this\ncertain documents for the distribution in some place that my father found it. And this was\nforbidden for me. Oh, reprimand terrible, yeah, if I can find, Gestapo will find, yes? And\nhe was so nervous and preoccupy of this what I did, that he forgot that he has to go with\nmy brother to the fire department chapter of the German police. And in his passion, he\nput this -- this -- this document that I was hiding, put into the pocket and went -- at the\nmoment brother [indecipherable] and now, let\u2019s go, we are going. And they went into the\n-- what I say? The jaw of the beast. And my brother -- that\u2019s the relation of my brother.\nBut they -- they passed some gates, and so on, and he\u2019s going somewhere from the fire\ndepartment, and then he was sit down, and sitting, and something hit, and my brother\nlook into the face of -- of my father, and if he\u2019s paralyzed, almost. He found that he has in\nthe pocket something that is that. But quietly he went somewhere when this -- they were\napproaching of this interview, he put into the basket, garbage basket this, ended out. Of\ncourse that means this -- in this document there was absolutely nothing that related to the\nperson, and so on. But this was on the [indecipherable] action of the weapon, or\nsomething, how to operate or some -- something. So I\u2019m saying that\u2019s the -- this is the --\nsuch a -- traps or occurrences can happen. M -- and of course, as I say, this is a\nmeaningless, this has nothing to do with [indecipherable]",
        "A: Telling the -- telling you -- telling you that how is it, yes? You could be in very big\ntrouble. And how to avoid the trouble, and so on. Not that\u2019s -- but this is the way how\noccupation was day by day, that we survived this occupation day by day. Now, e -- e -- e\n-- you See we are very close to sa -- execution. I knew that somebody will be shot. Even\nme. You see, our dream of everybody of us was to have a weapon, enough to have a\nparabellum, or to have some FN nine millimeter, or maybe who dreamed to have a\nmachine gun? How to find it? How to do this [indecipherable]. In Saskacampa, this was a\npart of -- of the town that was at the Vistula River shore. And along this Vistula River\nshore, some very common soldier with the shvesta and -- and other service men and\nwomen -- service women, make a walk along the shore, usually afternoon, peaceful\nsituation. So we -- this we did what the -- where is the target to [indecipherable] the from\nthe [indecipherable]. So we knew exactly, you know, that we were -- there was our\nterritory, you know? So, first was the scout, yes? What he has? Oh, he has a parabellum.\nFine. Besides what? And then on the bicycles, bikes, yes, we drove there. I am talking\nabout -- because I didn\u2019t know this, yes, but I was very much involved in -- in such\naction. As a -- as a security and so on. But the [indecipherable] in particular, and then\nusually this was a very easy gun, yeah, take it out, and he was very happy to be alive,\nyes? And get out. But one case was very different. [indecipherable] was -- result was I\nwasn\u2019t this -- now, I am not saying that -- that persecute myself, but for the re-really fact,\nbut because I was in some way still responsible for this, because I -- I participate many\ntimes in such a [indecipherable] is going a officer, what he has? FN7 millimeter\n[indecipherable]. Ah, dream. Seven, it was very small, and very handy. Okay, who is\nwith him? A shvester. Okay. So they drove it, they stop at him, they pull the gun, and this\nofficer at that moment pulled the hand from the pocket of the -- with the hand -- handgun\nin this, what was not in the holster, yes, but he took it from there. What he want to do\nwith this, maybe he want to give it up -- up. It doesn\u2019t matter for at this my friend who s -\n- was standing in there on front of him, he just pulled the trigger, because he didn\u2019t know\nwhat he will do. This shvester panics, and with the bare hand, jump on the -- another\nfriend. Same story, just he pulled the trigger, and it -- it was holding gun to -- to shoot,\nand he killed this shvester of the Red Cross, and this officer was the medical doctor. And\nboth die.",
        "A: Yeah. In four days, in this place, they brought the 40 people, and shot to death, as the\nreparation. Now, few days later, I -- my father called me. He -- I -- I didn\u2019t told him\nanything, and he, \u201cTadeusz, tell different -- I am telling you, and you have to tell all\nthese.\u201d And he\u2019s mentioning by name this, this, this, this, this. \u201cIf this what -- will occur\nonce again, you and all your friends, you will be executed, because your action was\nabsolutely not accepted by the authorities, and you found the result what\u2019s happened in\nthis place. This is not a way that you will fight.\u201d We get the warning, because --",
        "A: My -- our command. But my father knew it. He knew it, and everything. And he said,\n\u201cThis 1s not your action. When will be needed weapon, you will get it.\u201d And, I will tell\nyou --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, this was not assign -- yeah, that\u2019s was our private -- private action. And this action\ncost too many lives. Of course, as a explanation, as a -- some -- to throw out this guilt,\nyes, I will say, anyway, these people will be killed. You follow me? Because the\nhostages, for the killing, were permarently delivered anyway. So -- but I\u2019m just telling\nyou that you -- you will understand in no other way we have t-to do. So there was a\nlegality, and there was something illegal. Like, for example, there was a execution, yes,\nyes, there was a legal execution, yes, that I -- what -- what I -- as I mentioned t-to you --\nyour -- my father was involve to select the people for protection, or select the people to\nbe eliminated. And one of such elimination I knew that will be done. But again, it was\nsomething done that wo -- shouldn\u2019t be, yes? Because it was a history of the yacht arina.\nIt was on the Vistula River. And this yacht arina has on the board, a radio station. And in\nthe marina, when this yacht was anchored, was in charge of -- of the marina was Gulka,\nhis name was Gulka, and it was, without any doubt, yes, known and investigated that he\nis a confident of the Gestapo, and -- and he is guilty the dra -- death of the five boys that\nwere operating the radio station on this yacht, and Gestapo came and they were killed.\nOne of them jumped into the Vistula River and vanished. And he survived. And the --\nafter many months of investigation, it was confirmation, and there was given by\nauthorities, acceptance of execution Mr. Gulka. And I knew it. And believe me, I met him\nevery day, many times I was on this marina for another reason, because I have a --\nanothers -- my small boat, and now a man who was shooting, I knew him very well,\nbecause he give me this message. \u201cTadeusz, if you have something, you have to finish the\n-- the -- some -- if you have some problems with Gulka or you -- the -- yes -- you -- he\nwill be killed.\u201d And he came. He executed this Gulka. The dog, who 1n defend of his\nmaster jump on this guy, he killed his dog. But this was, in some way, this is the\ncharacters, yes? Character of the people. He was so full of hate, yes, that he did\nsomething what he shouldn\u2019t do, yes? He went home, and he kill his wife and child in the\ncreek. So you see, character in character, military action, and other military action, you\nhave to recognize that there is a killing which is say, so-called legal by the military\nnorms, but in this case, this is just a simple crime. That\u2019s my opinion.",
        "A: Oh, up to -- no, up to this day, of course, of course that. First of all, with the two of them,\nI was in concentration camp. Marchashu Pariski is one, and Bogedon Palmoski 1s another\none. I -- I can tell you that Marchashu Pariski, who is a doctor, medical doctor in -- in\nWarsaw, and Bogedon Palmosk1 is a architect. He was here in America.

        "A: No, no, ye-ye-yes --",
        "A: -- yes, yes. Oh, of course, that during the -- our lecturing of the weapon, yes, they were\ndelivered, a certain weapon, the -- just how to operate the machine gun, yes? So this was\nyes. It means that we were familiar how to operate, say, Meisner, Schmeitzer, or another\ngun, yes.",
        "A: Home, family home.",
        "A: Yes, yes, of course they\u2019d be in hidden place. Yes, it was not on the table, yes, but they\nwere. So now, another story, this was a tragedy, yes, a finishing tragedy because at one\ntime, y -- we -- we -- we pick up the deserter of the -- of the German army, and he was\nstaying for two days in the home of my friend, Raphael Padolski, very good painter e\nAustralia. And there was a mother, father, and he. And now it\u2019s happen he get everything\n-- help from us to depart somewhere, and -- but he was captured. German -- was captured\nby German. And you -- he know where he stayed, and he brought them, and the whole\nfamily was taken away to Mauthausen. Father die, mother survive, and Raphael survive.\nAnd now another very, very strange that something happen, that you have to put your --\nyour future on judgment of the certain situation which could be a deadly. I pick up this --\nmy order for me, yes fine, go to Raphael, and take the clothes, and everything of this guy,\nthis ch -- this deserter. So I took this everything with me, and instead to go home, I went\nfor my service time into the special place of this LHD, the fire department location,\nwhich was located in Saskacampa. And I took this package, and I put in someplace in this\n-- in this building, a building there was a -- a-abandoned villa by a very rich family in\nSaskacampa, and there was a -- our station. And fine, because okay, tomorrow morning I\nwill -- I will take it [indecipherable] for hiding, yes? I went to the bed, you know, the\nbank bed, yes, because you have to stay -- service was to stay for the night. I -- I -- I hear\nthe whisper, yes? People in this room are whispering, and talking [inaudible]. You see\nthat something is -- something happened, and then I hear you, ask Tadeusz, ask Tadeusz.\nOh, they found it.

And I said, \u201cYes,\nthat\u2019s mine.\u201d So I have heard only very bad expression in Polish language, untransla --\nuntranslatable, \u201cGet out from here.\u201d And that\u2019s it. And blah, blah, blah. So I took it that,\nand I go home, and hide it, and nothing happen.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, nothing happened. I came next day after they ansa. So, you see, this was a very\ndifficult time in Poland, that where somebody was a Polish, very rare was a canalya, you\nknow, was a -- a bad man. In spite of fact that I -- I -- I can tell you, that many of them\nwere simple pigs, almost.",

So therefore, I\nam saying, if there was a -- if there was a Warsaw uprising in ghetto, they were our\ntroops fighting for Warsaw ghetto. But this was a helpless, this was useless. You cannot\nfight es -- insane -- in the few months later, and this happened to the Warsaw. You realize\nthis fact, that it was a -- around eastern -- no, [indecipherable] holy, holy period, yes,\nEaster, yeah, I am saying good. It was a end of the ghetto. End. It was the final days\nwhere the young desperate people said fine, we have to die, die fighting. And they started\nto fight. But there was no -- no -- you say -- you see this was a very small scale, yes? If\nyou get main ghetto wipe out, yes, was done without any resistance, yes? You see, as I\nmentioned to you, there was difficulties for the Jewish people to -- to try to escape,\nbecause these routes were available, yes, but they were so different in behavior, in\neverything, that -- that they just give up, you know, like in this picture that you see s --\nwith the hand up, and I am going.",

We -- as a potential enemy when the Soviet Union will come.\nHuman behaviors, yes, only human behaviors, yes, then -- the troops, which were close to\nghetto, and this is the certain part of the Warsaw, we were far away.

But same story, that for us, when we started the\nwar -- abs -- Warsaw [indecipherable] there -- help was six -- 2000 miles away, yes? Or,\nwas just behind Vistula River, yes? Soviet army. So the fly -- flies -- the planes came\nfrom the Italy, yes, or from Britain to drop the armament in the Warsaw. It was one wit --\nwitness of the one fight -- one -- one flight that was shot down. This was a in -- in my\neyesight. I -- I have the document, I know the name of these pilots, and the crew, and one\nsurvivor was found there. They -- they -- this was a act of heroism, yes, because you have\nto realize that suddenly plane flying -- I don\u2019t know, six hours from Brindisi, somewhere\nin [indecipherable] or some -- somewhere there, they are approaching the Warsaw,\nWarsaw is in flame, and he is flying over the roofs of the do -- of the -- of the houses.\nAnd he, pilot, he came this thousand miles to drop in the spot, because if he -- he can fly,\nyou know, and drop someone and get out, yes? He was going back and forth, he\nvanishing the -- in the smoke of the -- of the burning say, and -- and believe me, he did it\nso many flights, that the Germans at the gun, they knew, aha, he is going the -- we have\nit, yes? He will come from this point. And I see the one shot from the big anta -- anti-\naircraft, and hit him in the -- in the tail, and the plane went down, and exploded. I -- I\nhave the greatest -- the greatest feelings of my friendship to this pilot who did it. It was a\nsoldier\u2019s duty. You follow me? He was trained regardless if he will be killed or not. It\nwas a very, very act of heroism.

At that moment it was a big motion. I can say commotion in the movement of\narmy. A lot of evacuated, the authorities si -- 1 -- of German macht, German power. A --\ne-evacuation of the unnecessary departments of the army, and ha -- in -- including the --\nthis was a quite good opportunities to pick up the weapon, because a lot of soldier of the\ncooperating army with the Germans, were passing Warsaw.

I said -- he was not a coward. He knew where I am going, but he didn\u2019t\nsay, \u201cTad, stay home,\u201d yes? Believe me -- probably, after my experience now, I will say\nto my son, \u201cStay home.\u201d We went and we had to approach our point where you had to\ncross a big, street, and be approaching this street. We know that they are movement of the\n-- of the armored carrier, light -- light wagon. So we have to pass this street very fast.\nAnd when we in group, in some way, we mobilize this big movement, this alarm another\npost of the German -- the German soldier, and they open fire to us. Believe me, this was a\n-- a-- so frightening that never in my life experienced something. Because my friends\nwere in the first line and were jumping to the housing. I was somewhere in the middle,\nand I had to run in the gun\u2019s fire. But I couldn\u2019t, so I dropped into the tarfofal field --\npotato field, and in this field, yes, th-this shooter, yes, they knew that I am there because I\nwas there [indecipherable]. And you have no imagination what does it mean when --\nwhen the shooting is of the bullets is whizzling, yes, above your hand -- head, and you\ncan -- you hear the shots, and -- and bullet sounds, and you can see the potatoes cut.

And we didn\u2019t wa -- we didn\u2019t were -- no,\nwe went -- we were not in the real fight. Young chicken. So at last -- no, I found from\nbravery that I say no, now I am jumping, yes? I jump [indecipherable] nice, and I -- I see\nthe -- I saw the -- the red brick\u2019s powder, yes, in front of me, because he shoot at the edge\nof the house, knowing that I will pass this point. And I pass, and nothing happen to me.\nAnd believe me, my first -- first was where I can have a droplets of water. My -- m -- I\u2019m\n-- I\u2019m telling only to emphasize the fact that everybody could have the same thing. Don\u2019t\ntelling me that you can be brave like -- like hero. No, the organs, your body will react in\nsome way -- maybe my body. I went into the appletel. They are still shooting, but a little\nbit far away. But it is [indecipherable] as you think, my first will was to have an apple\nand juice. And I climb on this -- on -- on this thing. I take the apple, bite it, and I was in\nseventh heaven. And at that moment, of course, I became right [indecipherable] yes, a\nstory of bravery, Marchaj, who in spite of the fire, he climbed the tree. That\u2019s was a very\nbravery man. So no, no, it was not me, not here. It doesn\u2019t matter now. Time -- and when\nI get the sip of the juice, I went down in -- into the building where we have to -- supposed\nto be. And then was I -- we found the three guys, very professional tadif. The three\nbrothers Rainishevski. Three brothers. You know the -- as special -- as the special cond --\nspecial diversion -- there was a special name, forget it. Doesn\u2019t matter, they were\nprofessionally killers.",
        "A: Polish, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. But -- tadif. [speaks Polish]. They were giving them special action to execute -- even\nthe execution, yes? Or special action to assassinated somebody, and so on. So they were\nvery, very brave, you know, it -- they were soldier. And they get out from this building,\nfrom these fences, and he -- they started to shoot [indecipherable]. Fine, they jump, they\nempty magazines, you know, of the bullets, and they came back and say, \u201cWho has\nammunition? We are without bullets.\u201d I say, \u201cI have.\u201d From my father. \u201cOh, sit down\nhere and load.\u201d Yes? And to say sit down, they give me empty this and I started to load,\nyes? And they get out for another jump, and again this was the -- the lack of\nprofessionalism of these three brothers, because they were surprised by the action of the\nGerman. German were not in the same place. They were a little bit farther to the left or\nright, doesn\u2019t matter. They attention was to look at these direction and to ge -- fire from\nthe sideway, and the -- suddenly the gates opened, and these two brothers are carrying the\nthird one. Bloody [indecipherable] blo -- blood from the head, from -- yes. And -- and\nthey came and say, \u201cWhere are our leaders?\u201d Yes? Because we came to this place, and\nthere was no single person who will be giving the orders what to do. But of course they\nstarted to cry, \u201cWhere is the sanitary -- sanitary, sanitary,\u201d and so on. They move it from\nanother, and took it -- took him to the quiet place, and fortunately he survive, he survive.\nAnd it was a one of the oldest of us who was thish free Christopher Soukoski, he took\nleadership. And he say fine, we have to move this from this point, because we cannot stay\nhere. We have to go to the -- another place, and make a hort. Yes, he was -- you know, he\nlooks like a -- you know, like a -- I don\u2019t know, bookkeeper from the pousher, you know,\nbut he -- I will never say that he is able to do this. He organized us, and we went into the\nsecond location, and came the first night, and we put the post, you know, and so on,\nregularly, according to the certain routine of the military action, and we -- we have a\nrotation in the -- in the -- to be a -- alive, and searching for the possibility of the German\nattacks, and so on, but they didn\u2019t think about it, the Germans. But, this night we hear the\nSoviet things. They were one kilometer from us. No man\u2019s land was between Soviet\nUnion and us. They penetrate our scouts, I can say, jump in they direction. They made a\ncontact with them, and there was nothing whatsoever, some action and action, and so on,\nno question. And they turn back and went back. I don\u2019t know, maybe on this basis, the\nleaders -- our troop -- aha, of course that our target, this German school full of -- of this,\nwe never attack this. Of course that there was another attack on the -- on the bridge fet of\nthe -- the Vistula River. Absolutely all of them attacking this day. All, n -- even survivor,\neven the women, there was not. They try -- this was -- this would be our future, our fate\nwhen we do the same to this professional, this arms up to the [indecipherable]. So came a\nquiet, and maybe they give some information about the movement in the front, and so on.\nThey made a decision, go to the waiting position in your first -- first gathering, so -- in\nSaskacampa, yes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yes, yes. Some --",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. It means that, shortly speaking, during the night --",
        "A: -- and during the next day, and during the next night, they found themselves, they made a\ndecision to go, that -- give up the weapon, that -- our private weapon, and this which\nwe'll get from this first place, and go to the first location when we left our territory in\nSaskacampa going into the gathering place in Grokov, yes, where we were, you know,\nwhen -- when this shooting occur with us, you know, and --",
        "A: -- especially in -- with me, yeah. But what\u2019s happened now? When I came from --\nbecause this is the time that we give the -- give the order us to go home, because this is\ncloser to wis -- to wint -- to Vistula River, maybe we will cross Vistula River, nobody\nknows. Our -- our situation was this, wait for the [indecipherable]. When I came home, it\nwas a shock in the -- in my home. Sister are crying hysterically, \u201cYou\u2019re alive!\u201d I say,\n\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cY-Y-Y -- our mother is looking your body in the field in Grokov.\u201d I say -- \u201cOne\nof a -- your men from your group came back, and he said that Tad, especially Tad, is\ndead.\u201d When my father investigated him, how was wearing, what was he wearing?\nDescribe it. And he start to make fantasy. \u201cI saw,\u201d he said, \u201cthat he was killed by German\nwith his parabellum.\u201d He exactly described this gun that I had, this gun that is -- was\ngiven by my father. And that\u2019s it. So, my mother was looking for my body, and in the\nbasement I met my father, yes, finishing the coffin for me. So, the coffin for me, it was\nalready built. But I\u2019m still alive. That\u2019s was the end of my participation in Warsaw\nuprising.",
        "A: Oh my, you have imagination. Terrible. So we waited for another few days -- not few,\nthis was the 23\" of September, and the -- our territory was surrounded by Germans, as I\nmention in my beginning of this story. We left, because you had to left, you know? What\ndoes it mean, you know? For us, the reality of the Warsaw uprising vanished, yes? We\nwere no weapon, no commands. We did whatever it was -- has -- has to do, and we went\ninto the Pruszkow, yes, by the -- by the train.",
        "A: Ah, you see --",
        "A: -- what my react -- shi -- you see, he -- my father was a -- he was a quiet man, he was a --\nhe can burst sometimes, and terrible, yes? But in -- in reality, he was very quiet man, and\nhe didn\u2019t blame me, he didn\u2019t do, he didn\u2019t complain about somebody. Be happy that you\nare alive, and that\u2019s it, you know.",
        "A: No, it means that at that moment, it was our decision, yes? It means our decision --",
        "A: Groups, yes, because as I mentioned to you, we came back and then, when we went --\nwhen we give up to the -- to the Germans, at that moment we were almost together, yes?\nSo decision was, fine, what we are doing, yes? The youngest of us, yes, Marix Keptinski,\nhe was so young, that according to this request of the Germans, yes, he was not eligible to\nget out, yes, he was 16. And he stayed, and Matchie Shapinski, me, Zigmund Paolernuk,\nmys -- my brother-in-law, Paulo Logansun, we went to the gathering place given us by\nthe Germans, and we lost surrender -- peaceful surrender, not as -- as I mentioned to you,\nnot as a soldier of the Warsaw uprising, because if we surrender as the Warsaw uprising\nsays to be honorable soldier, yes, we will be killed in spot. At that moment I told you this,\nthat the authorities of the army in the west, under the command Eisenhower, they didn\u2019t\nsend for two -- almost six weeks, the message to the Germans that they have the three\nsoldier of the Warsaw uprising as a prisoner of the war according to the Geneva\nconvention. This was after six weeks, in spite of fact we were wearing certain distinction\nbands on the head -- arm bands, bla -- white and red. And at that moment, we should be\nrespected as a soldier. Now, this never happened in first six weeks in Warsaw. Every\nsoldier captured was killed in place. Banded. That\u2019s it. Even then, you know, that didn\u2019t -\n- did was naro -- no rule at all, because the civilian were killed in thousand. They used the\ncivilian as a shield in attack to the certain position of the -- of the fighting soldier in\nWarsaw uprising.",
        "A: No, [indecipherable] that I surrendered myself to the -- a very big, unknown fate. Yo-Yo\n-- you -- you follow me? I give up my body, and mind to -- to go somewhere, where\nGerman would be leaflets set to us. You want to -- you have to -- simply was pick man\nbetween the age this and this has to leave the -- Warsaw. They will be respected as a\npeople, not -- not so -- but there was a -- in this message there was no mentioning soldier,\nthat pe -- men from age to age, they have to leave the [indecipherable]. There was\nnothing about a soldier. If we will do this -- either, exposed the troops, yes, as we are\ngoing, and we are the soldier of the Warsaw uprising, they will shoot us.",
        "A: Yes, no -- you so -- simple story, they tried to remove the potential fighters, yes, and to\nfind workers for them -- some work in Germany.",
        "A: No. No, he was as -- over the age. That\u2019s the one story, and probably at that moment he --\nhe was not so stupid to go, yes. Exactly. We -- yo-yo-you -- you -- you can -- you see this\nis a psychological problem for us. After the shock, we saw ourself that we are zero. That -\n- that our -- we give up everything already, and it was only lucky condition, yes, that we\nsurvive. And now, you realize this is after big emotion, and giving up to fight, and\nsuddenly everything collapsed, I have to build up again something without weapon,\nwithout the commander. So organize something for what? We saw already what\u2019s\nhappened. So, fine, we know that if -- or this we will -- this we\u2019ll know at the time very\nwell. That if yee -- you were -- if you want to oppose the Germans at that moment, you\nare killed. You are dead. So, at that moment we took a risk, yes, to give up ourself into\nthe German hands, but not as a soldier, but as a people that they are asking for. We are\nthe men of 18, get out from here.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Oh yes, it was a lot of tears, and well wishing, you see, because at the moment my\nbrother-in-law, who was not in the army, yes, because he was already new married man,\nyes, husband of my sister, but anyway he had to go, yes? So he joined us, and -- and other\npeople, too, the neighbors, and so on. It not only we, there was a -- from Saskacampa\nthere was 3000 men had to left -- had to leave, and -- and just taking a chance. Another\nchance, you see, to say -- to give up your future into the unknown fate. You know? What\nhappened with us? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s -- a chance was a 50 - 50, maybe less than 50 - 50,\nbecause in the -- in the history that will follow, I had a very little chance, you see? I could\nbe a captured in --in -- I can be locked in the Stutthof, as a inmate, period. And could be\ntreated in -- like a 17,000 last inmate in Stutthof, they were drowned in the Baltic Sea.\nYou know this? Very last group of the Stutthof people were loaded on the barges, and\ndrowned in the sea, wintertime. So -- but there was a lesson, of course. You -- you see,\nthere was a lesson that -- that -- that he -- we -- I get this lesson, that you have to be\nactive. Active. Y-Y-You have to do something that you are thinking that this is proper.\nJust to give up themself -- I have an idea what I will do. This happened in Pruszkow,\nwhen we came to the Pruszkow, a group of our neighbor, yes, they -- they give up the\ninitiative into the German\u2019s hand. It mean that not in such a way that -- to the -- because\nwe were all in the German hands, but they didn\u2019t try to make a own movement. You\nfollow me? They say, \u201cOh, I, now I\u2019m here, okay, I will be here, yes? I will not do\nanything unless somebody will touch me for -- by the -- by the arms, and get up.\u201d We left\nthe Stutthof in the -- of course, that is the coincident -- we left the Stutthof in the first\ntransport, and we made the decision. Now, they are asking us to get out? Yes, we are\ngoing. And we get out, and we enter the transport to Stutthof. This other, my friends, I\ncall them. Inie Pavouschevski, come on with us. Yes? No, he say, no, no, no. The next\ntransport went to the Austria. Austria, Gross-Rosen. None of them come back.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: May I interrupt you?",
        "A: S-Sorry. I never disobeyed the order of my authority. You see, they told me, give up your\nweapon, go int -- go to this gathering place where you were, and ga -- and li -- wait for\nthe farther orders. Sorry, your farther\u2019s orders never come again, yes? Because at this\nmoment, yes, earlier and be -- on the September 23\", German came and say, \u201cGet out\nfrom here.\u201d Now -- so, yo-you realize this fact, sometimes I am th -- I am thinking on\nthis subject, and I say we didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Because either I will -- we could\nfight, but maybe it was n -- I can say providence made the -- another decision with our\nlife, yes? At -- maybe they save -- spare our life in this way, and with it, a lot of our life --\nin our life.",
        "A: This was a -- you see, there was a very many kinds of Germans. Even they were the\ncertain cooperating army from outside Germany, it\u2019s like Ukrainian army, Hungarian\narmy, Lithuanian army, Estonian army. Or this is, I will tell you something, because I met\nvery s -- fast aggression, yes? The men who hire me in [indecipherable] company -- you\nrealize this fact? Men who hired --",
        "A: -- me when I came this, he was a soldier of the Estonian army, and he was in\nSuchenwald. Okay, so what I am saying -- and they\u2019re for. In this case, because the\nguerilla [indecipherable] was a very high authority --",
        "A: In Germany, yes, very, very. And he -- I -- in some way I am considering ou --\nconsidering him as a -- as a honorable general, because what he said, he -- and promise,\nhe did it. If he give the order to do this, he did it. And he was not the apparachik Hitler\nNazi -- you know, like Himmler, or something like that, no. So, but I\u2019m not -- \u2019'm not\napologizing him -- making apology for the -- for the action that the -- of the\n[indecipherable], but when we came to the gathering place, there were army soldiers.\nArmy, not SS, not some -- some unknown people. They loaded us to the -- to the we --\nwagon, and we had to wait closed in the wagon for about 60 hours, because at that\nmoment they -- there was heavy fight along the train going to the Pruszkow. And this --\nthis railroad track was passing through the lines of the Warsaw uprising, and Germany.\nAnd inside of our train, there were killed people. Probably by the -- by the friendly fire.\nBecause you see, some Polish soldier saw the train passing. Saw the train, German train,\nso let\u2019s shoot them. And we arrived the -- to the Pruszkow, and in Pruszkow was first to\nrelax, yes.",
        "A: Pruszkow, it was a previous big company, building the -- the machinery, and -- and the\nwagon, railroad tracks, and so on. This was this, and -- but at the time was totally empty.\n[indecipherable] manufacture the hose, and everything was empty, and there was only\nwater in hydrants, nothing to sleep, just concrete, railrer tracks, and that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Right?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s a -- from -- from this place where we entered the train, to this, this was about --\nwaiting time was -- to -- to wait for the free passage, yes? And it was about two hours,\nand -- and that\u2019s it, we were in -- in the -- in the afternoon, ear -- early afternoon, we were\n-- in early morning, and early afternoon we were there. And of course, you see, this is a\nstory that we get something from mother, this from sister, and so on. I remember after I\nget there, and now that\u2019s -- this was mother. You know, he give me the gold bracelet, you\nknow, maybe you will have to eat -- to use this, and so on.",
        "A: From my moth -- from my mother. A-And I can tell you I sure that I brought it back. All\nthe time I have it with me, in the belt here, under the belt. So, I brought back, and more.\nNot more in such a case because [indecipherable] myself, yeah. And in the Pruszkow,\nthere was a selection, yes? I -- I wasn\u2019t there. You see, I -- I even don\u2019t know exactly how\na -- how long I was this -- very shortly, the 23 and yes, and the morning 25, it is\n[indecipherable] two days after two days, we -- and we were loaded to the transport, and -\n- and we reached the Stegna. Stegna. And this was the beginning of the oppression,\nbecause at the time there, we found the German superselect Gestapo, with the Topenkoff,\nyou know, the -- you know what this Topenkoff meaning? Skull -- skool, yes? Skool and\nbones. You know, this is the symbol on the -- on the -- here, on the collars. On the black,\nwhite skull with the bones, this is -- was the symbol of SS. And of course we -- we\narrived very -- beginning of the night, and with the carol, and of course that I -- I said this\nwas the fright -- frightening, this was in -- inhuman, you know, when this prisoner from\nthe Stutthof tr -- well, he had a smart idea. He tried to penetrate us, and he lose our\nidentification of the -- of the -- of the -- of the prison.",
        "A: Stegna, no, is a -- a railroad station not far from Stutthof.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It means that in the potato field, they were working inmates of the -- of the -- of the -- of\nthe concentration camp, under the guards of the periphery. And one of them started to --\nto penetrate this through the potato field, our group. But some boy, he [indecipherable]\nyou know, maybe 12 years old, you know, he showed him, yes? And that morning when\nhe started to run away, wherever -- in what -- in whatever direction he run, he hit the\nguards. So he run another way. And then this -- this -- he was surrounded closer, and\ncloser, and closer and then was beaten terribly, you know, the carbines were broken on\nhis body. And -- and they last all day, they, believe me, this was like a [indecipherable],\nyes, for us, and for them, you know. They -- they can do and get a gun and shoot him,\nand that\u2019s it, it\u2019s finished in any moment, yeah? No, they did it for -- for us. We get a\n[indecipherable]. And they took him, you know, the -- you know, dragging him, and then\n-- then he vanished then. Later -- later, I saw the [indecipherable] of this gun, I saw the\nexecution of this man -- of this man, because he wasn\u2019t killed. When he entered the\nStutthof, of course, during the night, barking dogs, you know this -- in white uniform,\nyes, to -- to be s -- visible, you know, in the crowd, with these bats, yes. Sticks, and so we\nwent there, exhausted emotionally, and everything, and it\u2019s -- some of us started to\nrealize where we are. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know that where I am, but there are\npeople who knew. And the same day, the same night, one of us newcomer, he committed\nsuicide. He went just -- in spite of the warning voices, halt, halt, yes, and then you hear\nonly two shots bang, bang, and he fall down on the -- on the electrical fence. So was\nkilled finally by the -- by the shock, electric fence shock. He was taken away and then the\nnext few days -- two days, we spent on the -- in the open place, sitting on the sound,\nwithout weapon, without nothing, just sitting. And there was s -- the -- our older people\nfrom our group, fluently speaking English, with the li -- booklets -- no, leaflets from\n[indecipherable]. They s -- that\u2019s for me and [indecipherable] they started to talk to them.\nThey permit them to talk to the authorities of the camp, and they presented this, that we\nare the volunteer. We came here, and we gave up our person to the authorities, and so on.\nAnd I think that you will accept the [indecipherable]. And of course did I mention here in\nmy -- in my s -- letter that probably this was not only this, but they were -- they were\noverloaded. It came too many persons, and the struthel was not so -- there was a\nfareetenslager like Birkenau, where can destroy the fi -- 5000 people in day. So -- so --\nhave a problem, that\u2019s a one story. They -- they need me, they need work to be done,\nsomewhere. If you want to build the conce -- any concentration camp as a subcamp of the\nStutthof, you have to organize, yes? You have to guard, you have this, and you have the\nshelter for the guard, you have the kitchen for the guards. Because even if you don\u2019t have\nto think about the inmates, yes, the prisoner. But you have to do this by the guards. So\nthey had not. So this was a probably the case that, fine, let\u2019s use it as a worker, yes?",
        "A: This in this group, exclusively Polish people from Praga. Praga or Saskacampa. This was\n5000 people that arrived at Pruszkow, in the first transport, that I was in. So probably in\n99 percent was only Polish.",
        "A: Oh no, no, this was a [indecipherable] concentration camp existed since 1939, when the -\n- when the -- Poland was attacked by Hitler in Gdansk, and this territory, yes, that were\ncaptured by Germany, there was a lot of opposition, a lot of Polish patriots, and so on, so\nthey -- again, what I said, the -- cut the head, and you will -- you have a problem\nresolved, yes, and therefore the most people [indecipherable] were sent to the Stutthof\nfrom this territory. And say e -- in the -- in the Stutthof camp -- subcamp in Sofinbaden,\nthere was the people from Poltuleetsa. Poltuleetsa there were ordinary cashoops, you\nknow, cashoora -- cashoop is the Polish people who are calling themself as a cashoop,\nthey are speaking Polish, but if -- if you are -- 1f you would ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d He\nwill say -- give you the answer, \u201cI am cashoop,\u201d yes. But like, say maybe you can go to\nbeautiful places in Zakoparna, i1-in Mounting, yes? Who are you? I am Gourat, yes? And\nif you will -- if you will study this situation here, you will find that who are the gouras in\nPolish territory who are speaking Polish, and they are very Polish people, yes? They are\nthe stits -- you know, sitz, they travel as a tribe across the Europe, and finish his journey\nin Scotland. Scottish people are absolutely Polish cashoops. We are dancing in the same\nway, and they are singing in the same, they are playing the -- the -- no -- pipes, yes? This\nis the tribe that didn\u2019t reach the Scotland, but are Polish now.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Suicide.",
        "A: No, I -- yes, no, not only this, because you know, as I mentioned, you know this -- was a\nfew days later, execution of the men. And I was able, from this position where I was, to\nsee this execution, and to hear the music playing during this execution. Beautiful melody\nof Lehas. You know, [sings]. I hear it in concentration camp and when the man was\nhanging. And at that moment, you see, where you were at work -- I am work, you see, I\nhave to leave this place as possible, as fast as possible, to get out, to have a chance at --\nand suddenly, they calling for the professionals by -- by the baroof -- baroof --\nprofession. And I -- I am there, and I say I\u2019m a draftsman, I am [indecipherable] e bin\nsifener, and they find -- note it this way.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, I was, you see, a -- during the war, as -- I was the -- say, I did the first degree in my\ntechnical education. So I was a good draftsman at that time, and I -- I -- I can do this very\nwell. And at that moment, I capture my friend, Shapinski, come on, you. Are you going\nto [indecipherable] you. Take a chance to get out from here. Later we will think about it,\nwhat to do, yeah. In the same way ask the people to dig that simple -- simple worker. I\nsend -- I -- I told to my -- to my -- to my s -- brother-in-law, \u201cNietai, get out from here,\nand you will [indecipherable] you will -- you will have a -- you will u -- use the digging\ndevices, and you will be worker, yes. Get out from here.\u201d And so a lot of people, it was\nabout, as I mentioned, about 150 they selected us, and they, next day transported us to the\n-- another subcamp.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: No, no, no. You see, as I -- I -- I -- I would like to live it, we were in the group from the\ntroops, yes, somehow our Home Army troop. We were together all the time. I will tell\nyou then something that -- not that I\u2019m -- to emphasize that I am such a good boy, yes,\nthat I\u2019m so patriots, that I am so friendly to another friends. You see in this concentration\n-- you know, in the Pruszkow, I met Garouto, you remember, the Olympian, that he was -\n- he\u2019d once help us, and he taught me as a light athletes to throw the javelin, and s --\njumps, and so on. He met me, \u201cOh, Tadeusz, what are you doing here? Fine. Let\u2019s go,\nand you will be my hemp -- helper.\u201d\u2019 And my answer was very simple. \u201cI am not alone.\u201d\n\u201cHow many you have?\u201d \u201cFive.\u201d [indecipherable]. \u201cI cannot,\u201d he said to me, and I said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, [indecipherable], I -- I will manage.\u201d And we went together. So we went\ninto the Stutthof together, and in the first time [indecipherable] I was -- the -- we were\ntogether. So, we left Saskacampa, and we left Stutthof in the same time. And really, wi --\nthis was my [indecipherable] to exers -- to eck -- to --",
        "A: No, exaggerated [indecipherable], I was initiate -- initiator. I was in this game, believe\nme, I was my father. Yes, I behave like my father. Don\u2019t be waiting. You have to be\nactive. Go, search. You -- you have a -- your mobility will give you a bigger chance.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Day or -- day.",
        "A: First of all -- no, what was the -- the physical state, it was just that I was in good shape\nphysics. It means that all these experiences with the exhaustion due to the heat and so on,\nI can stand it very easy. Mentally, this -- there was a lot of thinking. It was not a -- a\ndevotion to started to think what I will do, what I will do. No, I have to do something. In -\n- in the possible -- in the margin of my possible ways, yes, to do something. So, I know\nhow to manage, to sleep on the -- on the sand, under the sky. This is something\nexperience, you know, that it -- 1t was too bothering me, yes, 1-it was a -- almost natural,\nyes. When I was re -- lying on my back, and instead of ceiling, I saw beautiful\nconstellation, I say at that moment, I\u2019m in the camp, but a little bit different,\n[indecipherable] at camp. It means that mentally I -- I try to relax, and not even to find, in\nthis condition the work that I am still -- 1-1-1n the nice wert, that around me something\nthat I want to reach there. And therefore, the -- I was able to think only what was needed,\nwhat I will do next day, yes, if they will select me, yes, because these -- they were\nstarting to talk about the selection, we had talks about selection. And therefore, when this\ncame, I was absolutely sure who are you, siekner, and I am going to leave this place as\nsoon as possible. What I can do, I took my friend with me, I advise my brother-in-law,\nand another friend, Zigmund Paolernuk from my troops, to go find. We will use the\nphysical force to dig the earth. And we left. Of course, in me -- in the meantime, I know -\n- not as I -- as I mentioned this execution and so on, this closed my knowledge about the\nStutthof. You know, I know that Stutthof, about the Stutthof you can write in books. Is\nstory of thousands of peoples, and each of the story was the same, yes? Sitting in barrack,\nand get the piece of bread, go to work, and come back, and so on. Fortunately for me, of\ncourse, this a -- my lucky star was shining about me, that I never was a such a person.\nAnd I am very pity for these people, and I know immediate what I will say that I saw it,\nbut without pain. It was that I get a knowledge without pain. I was observant, almost,\nyes? And my faith, it give me the chance to be only in this position, because I knew very\nwell that Stutthof wasn\u2019t a nice place to be. And that\u2019s all, and fe -- I -- I -- I -- I\nmentioned in the very beginning, you know, that I was in some way curious when I read\nthis Gittorda Schnyder book, that she probably has the same practice like me. That she\ndidn\u2019t fight -- that she didn\u2019t find the Stutthof, and Suchenwalda only as a martyrdom.\nShe took away -- she took away something more. More teaching element, about the\nhumanity, and so on. Little -- I -- I was very surprised, you know, that they tried to save\nthis SS man.",
        "A: Of the book.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: \u201cUnfinished Road,\u201d and this is the book about the Suchenwalda that we are -- that we\nwill start to talk about this [indecipherable]",
        "A: Draftsman, yes.",
        "A: So, next day, I think so, this was the day of -- I can look at the date, but this 1s not so\nimportant, but same day that -- August 29\", yes? They started to organize nus -- us, and\nwe left on the August 30\". So I was in -- in concentration part har -- in Stutthof, I was\nfive days. I came 25\". and I left 30. And therefore, this was the five days, as I mentioned.\nWhat I saw -- I saw the -- oh, I already mention, yes, that it was enough to -- to have a\nfull knowledge what does it mean, and the -- to be in -- with this knowledge, to be free,\nwithout experienci-cing a real life in Stutthof. That\u2019s was a big, big, lucky condition that I\nfaced at that time. So we went to the station, Stegna. We entered the railroad track,\npersonal. Free for the open public, not a -- not a --",
        "A: Car -- I say -- cattle car, yes. And in very cultural way, we arrived to Leibush. Cultural\nway because we were sitting on the banks, yes, open doors, open windows. If somebody\nwould like to escape, lees you can do this. Even you can do this, yes. But of course that\nmy feeling, and everybody feeling was no, no, no, no, that\u2019s is not the time, yes. My\nfeeling is. Maybe somebody, but nobody make attempt. Where is this -- the Leibush?\nThere was a very loose, small camp, surrounded by the fences, barbed wire, and post\ntowers. And we spend there -- hat there was a first registration. First registration beyond\nthe Stutthof, because in Stutthof we never entered the registration of the Stutthof. Certain\nnotation about the -- about our profession technically was for the special people who\nwere looking for this, but this was not for the authorities of the -- of the camp. So\ntherefore, this is my problem life, that I cannot find the records of my presence in the\nStutthof. But doesn\u2019t matter. In -- in -- in the first registration, was in Leibush, but there\nwas a very short time, I think that this something lee -- about two days, you see. And\nfrom this point they took us to place called Brucie -- Brucie. And there was a official\nname of this, it was hausencommander -- commander Leibush, commander Brucie,\nhausencommander SS trupen eeboongsplatz, bruce sopienbarda1. It means that this\ncomplex -- aha, now, of course I can make a digression, that we entered the territory\nwhen we were moved from Leibush to Brucie. We can say like a capital town of the\npulligol. There was a territory in -- in cashoops, yes, but this was the Polish territory\nbefore the war, but as izproisin in Germany during the occupation. And they -- this\nterritory was about 50 kilometers by 40, yes? Big, big, totally secluded. People, if they\nwere living, they throw it away, and they started to build a eebungsplatz, which this\nmeans exercising some military action. But not only because I knew a little bit more,\nbecause I was a draftsman at the drawings. That was not only eebungsplatz, that was a\nfuture launching territory of the rockets in the direction to the north. All orientation of the\nlaunching pad were north. It was not to Sweden because this was exactly Sweden in front\nof this territory, yes. This was probably -- the goal was United States. And of course, at\nthat time, Germans were able to send the rockets V17, from Europe to America, over the\nNorth Pole. And of course there was missing only one element, yes? Rocketry was\nperfect, but there was no atomic head, because there would be a stupidity to send a simple\nexplosive, yes? They were waiting at the time for atomic head. If they will -- if they\nwould have had atomic head at that time, the launching was -- would be Sofinwalda.\nYeah, so we came there, first to Brucie, and this was official subcamp of Stutthof. But\nthey have no ability to the people, yes, so the -- they -- this was in s -- in the state of the --\nto be born, yes? Start was nastendi to have people and labor camp for this arrangement.\nAnd in Bruce was again the selection, and I -- and selection -- in Bruce, a certain people\nwho were for the physical work, like my -- my brother-in-law, Zigmund Paolernuk, they\nwent into the orlik -- in the place orlik, and they started to be a simple worker. And they\nbuild the -- they build the hospital for this territory. It was a lot of different -- different\nsection of this territory. I was sent to Zochenbad. In Zochenballid there was a ballitunk. It\nmeans that the -- the place where you are -- management place of this -- of this territory,\nand there was a -- some engineering stop, and we came as a draftsman to make a drawing\nfor them. And as -- as I mentioned yes, that this was the so-called SS from erbiten unken\nnaming number 128. This was the official name. And when we came there, we get shelter\nin the barracks, which were built already, wi -- ve -- with very little fancies, bar fancies,\nand a lot of different storage houses for the -- for the any materials, yes, that could be\nused to build this beauti -- big -- big enterprise, Sofienwalda, SS evungsplatz isproisa.\nAnd there were -- we get the -- this card, in number, I -- this is the card that I only -- you\nsee, I don\u2019t know why I have it, and not my friend. This was the escarta. It means that\ncoupon for the food. Why, after it -- it -- about one week, we build our arrangement. We\nmade a arrangement to build a kitchen, and we started to -- to have a cook, who cook for\nus the food.",
        "A: In our barracks, within the certain fences, yes, barbed wire fences. But very loose, you\nknow, there was no guard standing, you see? There was another big fence, around bigger\narea where was the management building, where were the storage houses, and this\nterritory was in some way guarded by the -- by the guards. But very loose, even as you\nhard1 -- shortly speaking, we were treated as a worker. We could get out from our -- from\n-- from this camp. We can go to the town by permission, written permission, and you see\nnow, after the Stutthof, we were 1n paradise, you know? You -- what -- what you had to\ndo, you had to work, yes? Of course the food was -- you -- you have imagination, but it\nwas eatable, and was enough. Not die. And treatment was, as I mentioned, on the basis\nthe lord and servant, and German and Polish, yes, so th-th-this was the relationship, but a\nvery -- but it, first of all they -- they recognize our professional. If I make a drawing --\nand I remember when I made the first drawing, yes, oh, nice, yes. And they even ge --\nthey applauded me, oh, very nice drawing, yes? Th-They recognize me as a professional,\nyou see, because they were in the SS uniform, but they were professional.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Y-Y-You see, we had a -- we were mis -- as I understand, because nobody\nexplained me what was our status at that time, but I understand that they don\u2019t want to\nhave any trouble with -- with the new development. It was they were happy as is. We are\nthe worker making work, and therefore, why to think about to build the fences, to build\nthe bunkers, yes, for the penalty, and to do some oppressive elements in this -- in this\ncamp, like -- like in stut -- stut -- Stutthof, because there was a just the -- the history of\nany concentration camp where they try to destroy the people, it was just to -- to key the --\nsuch a condition that the human body weight is going down and down and down. Is a\nterrible way of thinking about, because this was a technological problem for the German.\nHow to destroy the people. So is easier to destroy the 50 kilograms body than the 150. So\ntherefore the first priority was just to -- to -- to lose the weight. Terrible. You know, what\n-- what was the Birkenau -- Rejinka this t -- hundreds of barracks where they deliver\nthese people, 5000 a day. What they did in these barracks? They make the easy way to\ndestroy the bodies. From 100 to 50. So this was a -- moral issue doesn\u2019t exist at all. There\nwas only technological problem. So we were not in this position, yes? Stutthof was. So\nwe -- we were regular worker. A little later change everything, yes? In the very beginning\nwas -- and now, to -- to give as the feeling that we are not so easygoing Polish people, so\nwe had a visit from the personnel, from Stutthof, and I was beaten by such a SS man,\nwho came to us, and he -- I didn\u2019t yet, at that moment to understand his German very\nfluently, he started to put me in the corner of the -- of the room, and took a -- a -- a line\nfor the -- for the for measurement, and he push me 1-in such a possin that I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what he wanted from me? What -- what I have to do? And he just tried to put\nme in the corner and measure what is the dimension of my body to build a bunker. You\nknow what was the penalize bunker for them. Is the three dimensional for the width, and -\n- and this, and you had to stay there in -- in the standing position for I don\u2019t know, two,\nthree, four days, without sitting. So I suffer in the same, you know where? In the Polish\nprison. Exactly in the bunker. So, you know, the Polish prison -- at that moment if\nsomebody is asking me, they were not better than Hitler, bunkers. So, but of course, this\nis not the Polish. I said Polish, but is wrong, this was the Communist. Cause the\nCommunist really -- so, he came to us to give us the warning, you are not a free peop --\nyes a -- yes, so we had this visit. And this was a very nice, everything, up to the -- of\ncourse it -- I -- I presented here in my memoir, you know, the -- the name of the -- of the\npeople that -- which is very interesting to point one, that there was a engineer from\nBoinies, who was in uniform s -- SS, and -- but was origin Dutch. Now, this was a totally\nlike us, yes, behaves, but not -- not very openly. When we were only with us, he behaves\nin very special way. And later he vanished. At a certain day, when the alliance of frenzif\nin the west started to go into the Holland direction, he vanished, and then we -- we have a\nmessage, not the message, rumor, that he was a spy. He left the office, taking a document,\nand he just got out. So, was the Boinies, when I -- I -- I just mentioned it, when I -- when\nthis Robert, SS man, like orengutang, you know, he looks, and he just make the sketch,\nand put on -- on the desk, to do the drawing. So when I asked the -- my authorities what I\nhave to do with this sketch. At that moment, they say, [indecipherable] he did show, yeah\n-- So wit -- this was his answer. And -- and then this was up to the November 23. On\nNovember 23, in the very beginning of the day, we were awake up -- woke up surrounded\nby the many guards. And they throwed us from the -- from the barracks. They made a\nsearch our body, anyway they didn\u2019t find gold, and -- and because I was always with me,\nand -- but they searched the barracks, they took a lot of things from the barracks, and --\nand they force us to build a second row -- second fence. And they read to us the order of\nthe commandant that since today, we will be treated as a political prisoner. And our\nunsubordination to the order will be penalized at once by the death, but -- and the\ncrossing the border of the guards line, you will be shot without warning. It\u2019s like at the\nbig a -- concentration camp, and fi -- but it was given this, and of course everything was\ncancelled in our -- our walking, our letter, wa -- everything is this. And we were regular\nprisoner, but again, 1t was dying [indecipherable] you know, the Third Reich was dying,\nand this impulse, yes, was given by the -- by the order of the higher authorities, yes, that\nis --that we are prisoner, but you have to execute this in some way. But, to execute this,\nyou have to have a power, you have to [indecipherable], what I wrote in the very\nbeginning. You have to create a condition of the real concentration camp. And of course,\nthe -- our regime of our work time, walking, correspond mail, and so on, was like in -- in\nthe concentration camp, but there were no pressure. There was not standing by a cr --\ncrematorium, yes? There was not a standing by oppressor who are waiting to kill you,\nyes, because there was a -- the only one purpose to be in -- 1 -- in Stutthof, it was to be\nkilled. Here, we were still worker, treated as a -- as a politisha pratinga, but -- but they\nrecognized the fact that fine, I cannot kill him because he is working for me, give me the\npurpose. My presence here was totally different than in Stutthof. And of course, day by\nday, November, December, you know, Red Army\u2019s approaching in the west, 1s, you\nknow, the alien forces are entering almost Germany. So this is the case when in February,\nyes, it was a -- oh, was only we, yes, and the poltuleetsa camp, it was a Sofenwalda, we\nare there. There was a prisoner from the poltuleetsa, as I mentioned, this was the prisoner,\npolitical prisoner cashoops, that never try to recognize a power, and authorities of\nGerman. You know, they were really Polish people who said no, we are Polish people,\nand we are not recognizing you as a power. So they send them to the prison. Of course, a\nlot of them, they recognize this power, and they went into the German army, fighting on\nthe west -- east front. So you see, this was another set -- another chance for the people,\nyes, to go with, or to go against. You see, they said, I am going against, and they won.\nThey who said, fine, I am going with German, they were loser, because they were forced\nto be a German with all privileges to be soldier, and to be killed in the name of the Third\nReich. So, you see, when I give up myself to the German, I did something opposite were\nthese people in poltuleetsa. Is a very hard to find the choice, wh-what I have to do in my\nlife now? So, this is the nu -- you cannot find the answer what you have to do. This 1s the\n-- you, your ability, imagination, and decision.",
        "A: Yes, ah, now, before this happened that they locked us as a political prisoner, my friends,\nwho are -- who were Jewish origin, you know, Matchie Shapinski is a Jewish, but -- he\nwas a Jewish, and I know that he was a Jewish, because I know who is a professor\nBatswell Shapinski, very famous mathematician in Poland.

So you know that this is a shape, so when you look at\nthese guys -- see, here you know he is a Jewish. Y-You see, they were so different that\nthey find a problem to hide themselves. Even to find the hiding place for them. You\nfollow me? You couldn\u2019t go to forest on, to find as a prisoner like a partisan.\n[indecipherable] know how you could do this, where you have the family with the\nchildren. So alright, so --",
        "A: -- Matchie, my friend, one day he went -- we -- we are free to go.

I, of course, at the time, I\nwas serious. I say -- even Balmosi get this. I was a little bit start to think, but I persuaded\nmyself. Tadeusz, you are facing some act of mercy of a person who 1s giving help.\nPhysically, he could be killed. He made a help for them. I have to respect this. I cannot do\nsomething, because probably he bisk -- this -- this -- this doctor was probably a Jewish.\nHe\u2019d been some way. He covered, I don\u2019t know, maybe not the first generation, maybe\nsecond generation Jewish. He give it a chance to survive. And they left the concentration\ncamp. So I was, as you can see, the only time that I was together with them, and so then I\nwas alone. Okay, but they get to Krakow, and they have a very good life with the family 1\n-- my family there.",
        "A: Yes. And then came this November 23 [indecipherable] ah, there was a -- I can tell you, I\nmade many attempts, but in different way to arrange my departure from the -- from this.\nAs I mentioned my -- my -- my godfather, Jusef Kameeta, who was before the war a -- a -\n- a mayor of this Slominiki, yes? During the occupation, he was all -- still recognized by\nthe people of Slominiki as a representative of -- of the society, of -- of this town. And he\nhad a good connection, as I mentioned, connection, celebrities played the role in the life.\nHe approached the German authorities of the SS bowelitung near Krakow -- y-y-you --\nyou see the same name, SS bowelitung in different place. I was in the hand of SS\nbowelitung from the [indecipherable] numery -- number 120. Similar arrangement of the\n-- of the enterprise of the SS, to build something, was near Krakow.

I think they was maybe -- maybe I -- I -- I don\u2019t know,\nnow I -- I am trying to -- to fantasy. But maybe these Germans who departed with all\nthese Jewish women -- I don\u2019t know, but this was very difficult to -- to -- to -- to\nunderstand, because all these women that were in this room, they were sick. Typhoid, and\neverything, something like that. And they -- they look at me like I [indecipherable]\nmessenger that -- that the war is finished, you see, because they ent -- in they room, they\nenter not a German. A-A-And I say -- I couldn\u2019t say anything. I say -- I get out from this\nroom, yes, and of course, so far what -- what is later explained by another books, that\nthey came a car, this day, they loaded this girls, and they transported to the woods\nsomewhere, and all were killed. So I just wrote to get through th -- that probably I am the\nlast -- last one that saw your friends. A-And that\u2019s all. Of course, then, it came at order --\nevacuation totally, we have to go. But in one direction, not in the direction when Jewish\nwomen departed, or Estonian soldier departed. We started to be moved by an -- under the\norder of the SS at the time yet, yes, into the direction of Gdansk, to the north. To the\ndirection of that Red Army. And then, when we approach it -- I am talking more or less\nfast, we enter into the hand of the army -- regular army of the German. And we enter\nunder the command of the German army, and they say to us -- oh, they didn\u2019t say in this\nway, but you are the worker, you will work here, and you will do whatever we will give\nyou to do. And we were the worker to -- to dig the trenches, ditches, anti-tank, in the\ncertain territory of the predictable direction of the Soviet army. Of course, never\nhappened. So whatever I did, didn\u2019t work at all. So I -- I -- this is where my clear -- clean\n-- my conscience, yes, that I -- I was not a helper. So -- but situation was always this, you\nsee, when we transp -- we were transported on foot, and this the wintertime, and we are\ngoing against the traffic of the flicklinger, the -- the escapee of the -- all population from\nthe east Prussian. We were surrounded by such a fatije that it was a just impossible to\ntake a risk, because it was such a possibility that I can jump this -- mi -- my surrounding\nGermans, and to hide somewhere. But the chance was only one, yes? Either successful, or\nI am dead. There was no -- no other chance, yes, if -- there were -- when somebody was -\n- was -- if the -- some soldier, and especially the -- especial troops which were -- made\nthe order for any possibility of the desertion -- you see, I could be treated, yes, that I am a\nGerman, yes, who\u2019d thrown away the uniform, and he\u2019s now at hiding, yeah? So, in every\ncase, I faced the death. So, for me at that moment, my job then was follow up with them.\nAnd in this way, I -- I reached the point when we were taken away from the SS, because\nSS very fast started to vanish, yes, because we were approaching Red front, and we enter\ninto the hands of the regular army. And these were regular hand. I know that they were\nenemy, our, but they were regular army, like the Polish army who fought German. I -- I\nam recognizing any army as a army, yes? And they were German army, but army, not a --\nnot a beast in the form of SS. And they treated us -- but they warn us, you see, 1n this\ndirection, there is Soviet Union troops. And there are our troops. Now, if you want to be\nbetween them, you will be killed either by these, or by them. It\u2019s very simple, yes? So,\nthat\u2019s the one story. You know that I mention you, in -- during the coffee break, yes?\nBelieve me, I had a idea to reach the point that we would start to go into the west,\nbecause my dream at the time was not to come back to Poland, but to go to the west. I\u2019m\nhonestly speaking. Background of my action was, under this pressure, there was nothing\nthat -- that was waiting for me, because I knew what is there in the Soviet Union, and\nCommunist -- and -- and in this way, I reached the point when we were totally\nsurrounded. The only one way to enter the territory behind the Vistula River, and the\ndepression [indecipherable], we dig the dams, and we let water run into the depression,\nand we surrounded ourself in -- in Germany. The remnants of the army, yeah, by the\nwater. And -- and the fifth of May came for us the freedom.",
        "A: How they come? I saw like a hooves, you know, cribe on the horses, with the flying\npapasha, you know this? And -- and when I look at this, they were very special animal.\nYou see, a very independent soldier, very -- I can say that there was not command for\nthem at that moment. They enter this territory like a conquistaros, yes? Everything, ah\n[indecipherable] you have the watch, 1 -- give it to me, yes. Everything was them. And I\nam not blaming you. Probably I would do the same, you see? But they enter, as I\nmention, like people not from Europe, exactly not from Europe. This was a -- I remember\nPolish army. I remember the Italian army who was the prisoner between us later, soldier\nfrom the Mussolini army. They came, and I met first military -- first Polish police, who\nentered this territory, because aha, when the Russian came, and we wanted to go, they say\nmilsha minadda. No, no, no, stay here. Oh, you see, this was a ha, now we are going to\nSiberia. Believe me, we know exactly. We already get before my -- before Warsaw\nuprising, that the Polish soldier from the Akar, Home Army, they were -- when they were\ncapture, and not killed, they were sent to Siberia. In the gulags at Heepalago. So --",
        "A: Oh, no, no, they -- they -- in [indecipherable] Italy --",
        "A: -- there was a thousand of people, Russian, Ukrainian, Italian, and Polish people, you\nsee? All the [indecipherable] not the German -- and there was a lot of that such a people,\nsurrounded -- you know, you never hunt the -- the -- the rabbits, or -- or this, when you\nhave the circle, you are circling a certain territory, yes, and you can -- and the -- the\npeople are approaching into the center of this surrounding territory, you see. You\ncouldn\u2019t see in the very beginning do -- the -- the animal. And then you see\n[indecipherable] and then is a boiling animals inside of this. So therefore, when -- when\nthe -- when we re -- we were encircled by the -- by the army, Red Army, and this army\napproached to the closer and closer to the sea, you see when I would -- I took the map\nwith me, to understand for you what the big territory was first surrounding, and then the\narmy started -- Red Army started to close it closer and closer to the -- such a small point.\nSo there was a thousand of people, yes?",
        "A: No, never had that feeling. Sorry. I never had a feeling that I will liberated, and the first\napproach was such I want to go home, and I hit the guards of the Soviet Union soldier.\nNo, no, no, there -- it was not looking for me, freedom. And now I -- listen to me. When I\nthen came the opra after three days staying in those woods, which was very comfortable,\nnice weather, we started to go outside, and press down is a prousht. And there they told\nus, in Russian but I understand. Go to the vieni commandant -- go to the military\ncommandant in -- in s -- Cherf to get a propouskou. Is a pass -- pass document to go to\nWarsaw. And this was a trap, because such a pe -- boys like me, the first question they\nask you, Atko darry? Where are you -- where are you from? Warsaw. Warsava. Uh-huh.\nYeah. Young man from Warsava, who was he being here, in concentration camp? You\nfollow me? They knew exactly. They --",
        "A: Atkou --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: For them? For -- for the Russian was one, this 1s the -- from the Warsaw uprising boy.\nWha --",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Ah, what does it mean?",
        "A: We were the enemy. According to them, we were the enemy of the Soviet Union. You\nwill follow me, and therefore, the only one solution for us is there -- to send them to the\nSoviet Union. You see, because we didn\u2019t fight with -- for God\u2019s sake, we didn\u2019t fight\nwith the Soviet Union, we fought with German, but all the time, in history of the second\nWorld War, sorry, Soviet army was our enemy from the 17 of September, 1939. And then\nwhen th -- came in the *45, it was the same army.\nEnd of Tape # 6\nTape #7",
        "A: Marcha].",
        "A: Yeah. But be-before I will answer, I say that my first contact with the Polish authority,\nwhich was a platoon of the Polish militia, young boys, maybe my age, they warn me.\nThey give me -- they gave me, in spite of fact that they were Communist, definitely, they\ngive me, \u201cHey boys, you want to be home? Forget about that you are from Warsaw, if\nyou don\u2019t want to be in Siberia.\u201d Exactly he told us this. So, I knew that this is the\nconfirmation what I was thinking. Okay, now, after the war, when I was come back\nhome, I found everybody survive. I found already my brother-in-law. I found Matchie\nShapinski. I found Zigmund, and a lot of my friends. And I -- we started a new life. Of\ncourse, in the -- but of course that we are in the same area, but my family was everything\nintact. Family, and yet, father, mother, brother and two sisters. The whole war passed\naway, and we survive. I was the last one. And again, like in my Warsaw uprising, my first\nday, I didn\u2019t find my mother, because she was at the Gdansk, in this territory, looking for\nmy body, because again came some messages that Tadeusz, he work in Sofenwalda, ah,\nyes, he had the problem with the legs. You know, what is the background my -- my --\npolio, he had a problem to walk. Not what -- not me, another has. That doesn\u2019t matter,\nmother came, found me in good, and we started life. Now what\u2019s happened to our family?\nI went into the school. Objectively I\u2019m saying that at that moment, Polish government\ndidn\u2019t recognize me as a enemy of Poland, because I never was, yes? I was enemy of the\ncertain system, but when I am not accepting something, it doesn\u2019t mean that I am a -- a\ncriminal, to destroy the system that I don\u2019t like. So I entered the Polish pri -- Warsaw\nPolytechnic, and started to education of the aeronautical department. And everything was\nbeautiful. I remember this time forever, as a very beautiful time, because I started to\ndream -- realize my dreams. I started to fly with the gliding glider aeroplane. Even very\nfamous kokoruznik that killed us at the -- at the fee -- on the field of -- of -- of grines. So\nI flew this kokoruznik, beautiful planes, absolutely. So I married, but 1t came -- because\nyou see, at the time was everything occur in Poland. A certain people were in power, but\nthen this power shifted. And there came to Poland so-called verification of the society. So\nthey started to select who are you, what is your background, and if it\u2019s not good, get out.\nAt that moment I was the assistant on the faculty of the Warsaw Polytechnic, and there\nwas a first e-e-e-exercise the -- this verification, and I get a paper from the rector, and say\nsorry he even not pape -- I get a paper, but he called me, and very sadly, he said,\n\u201cTindecipherable] Mr. Marchaj, you cannot be 1n the staff of our faculty, and it is not my.\nThis is the order, and I cannot do anything to do.\u201d So suddenly, I was cut off from my\ndreams. And this was a order that even it\u2019s forbidden for me to enter the airfield.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s the -- at that moment, you see, what\u2019s happened, I started to do this, I started to\ndream. I have to leave Poland, yes? I have to leave Poland, if legally, or not legally, I will\ndo this. And I started to plan to escape from Poland, very close to Stutthof. Vistula River.\nThe good boats, and to get out of this country, and going with the very -- speed boats,\ndesigned by us, designed by the proper, it was designed by us and prepared by us. And\nthese boats were faster than any boats in this area. And we had a very great chance to\nescape. But, I have the friends who are not very conscious. They st -- shared this -- our --\nbecause they want to participate in our escape, and one of the friends of the friends was a\nconfidant of the -- of the ed -- Polish secret police. And before we -- we make a first\nattempt to get out to the sea, we tested our boats on the Vistula River going into the --\ninto the sea, we were captured, and accused of the attempt to escape, in spite of fact that\nyes, we were thinking about, but there was not attempt, because we were not yet on the\nway. In -- in -- in front of us was still the dams, different passages sot -- forget it. This\nwas -- this was the first talking. We were -- now, ah -- yeah?",
        "A: Yeah, no, I suppose. When they approach us to be arrested, the first called person was not\nmy brother, who was the older, but Tadeusz Marchaj. Who is Tadeusz Marchaj? Behind\nyou. Okay. They took me first. And accusation was that Iam a spy, American Capitalist\nspy. Because this guy who send the documents to the secret police, maybe to get the\norder, or a special award, and I was the e -- I was a -- on the faculty of the aircraft engine,\nand I was involved in the project to design the aircraft engine for the MON. MON, it\nmeans that Ministry Obronin Nardova. Minister of the Defense. Such accusation, being\nthe project [indecipherable] the designer of this, it was very easy to say, yes, quite\nprobably, let\u2019s tested him. And I was eight months investigated.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: One in three -- I was sentence -- after eight mis -- months of investigation, I was\nsentenced to one year and three months. And, of course, when I get out from this, I\ncouldn\u2019t find a job, I was black sheep in Polish society. So again, I have to wait for the\nstalindai, and when the stalindai and chen -- there was some change, I start a -- can enter\nagains into the society, into the science work, and I started to work in Institute of Physic\nPolish Academy of Sciences in the cryogenic department. But again came the same. I\ndon\u2019t know for what reason, yes, they said no, you cannot go there, you cannot go there.\nYou can go dwe -- and so on. There was a -- again some oppression, yes? Political. And\nat that moment, I said to my wife, Festa, \u201cIf you would have a chance, go. Take the\nchildren. If you will get it, fine.\u2019 And it was such -- of course paid with the money, yes, it\nwas -- I was hostage. So she went to Switzerland, and then to America, to f -- he had a --\nshe had a family, and I was the hostage. And three years I tried to -- every possible\nattempt. You know, I tried to -- to bribe in very special way, the daughter of the -- of the\nsecretary of the Communist party, a very nice girl. And she promised that there will be no\ntrouble. And then no, came again -- and this is what\u2019s happened here. Maybe as a -- as a\nshock, because this is a -- we are stuck in the very big story --",
        "A: This is my brother.",
        "A: Yeah, I understand. So -- no, toe -- I will -- I will not touch. Anyway, there was some --\nmy -- my brother was the very famous writer on the subject of aerodynamics, and\nhydrodynamics [indecipherable], and he\u2019s considering the word is a number one on the\nsubject. And he was a professor in the Southampton University in England. So, his work\nin -- in England, yes, created a problem for him. I was a hostage for my brother. But my\nbrother was thinking the same what I was thinking, and he didn\u2019t share this problem with\nme. He is tr -- he was trying to stay in England [indecipherable]",
        "A: My brother. And he did it. But when he did it, made a decision to stay in England forever,\nI already escape, and I was in Venice.",
        "A: In 1968. So in 1968, my brother made a decision in England, stay in England, and I made\na decision and I did it, and crossed the border six, that he wrote to me a letter only that it\nwas well done. That\u2019s what.",
        "A: You see, I was, as I mentioned to you, very patriotic, educated human beings. And I\ndidn\u2019t do anything wrong against my country, even the Communist country. I did\neverything possible for my Poland, yes? But I try to be somebody in -- in -- in Poland\nCommunist, and I was. I was a good student, I was starting to work. I was very positive\nman, in every possible way. But this burden of my Home Army, and participant in the\nWarsaw uprising, at once a thousand of people was eliminated from the -- to share the\npleasure to build a po -- Poland. It\u2019s just a sacrifice. The -- we were the junk that has to\nbe taken away forever. Then, don\u2019t hear about it. Don\u2019t -- don\u2019t recognize he was a\nhuman beings [indecipherable] have the imagination that the Hitler is a nice person\ncomparing with Stalin. How many own people he killed? Oh m -- I am not saying about\nPolish, Jewish, German, everybody. So therefore I am say -- I -- I have no shame that my\nopinion is this, sorry. And anyway told -- I am telling you, when I was in prison eight\nmonths investigation, I never was in such a condition. You have no imagination what\ndoes it mean what the torture you could create to other person, only because he\u2019s a\npolitical prisoner -- political enemy. [indecipherable]. I -- I was in the prison for one --\neight months, and I was in the elite of the Polish society to be destroyed. Of course, oh\nno, no, th -- they were very -- they have a lot of time to do this. German kill you at very\nfast, bang, bang, bang, is gone. No, you can stay in prison forever, you know, it is that the\nprisoner penalty was very open for life, for life, for life. 15 year, oh, ho, ho. We are -- we\nare joking at that moment, you know, what -- what did you get? Ah, five Sundays. Five\nSundays, so you think you are there five week? No, this the Sunday -- big Sunday, you\nknow, where it -- Easter Sunday. Five Sunday. Fifteen years, this was a joking, but e-e-e-\neven being in -- in the prison, you have to make a joke about, because y-you would not\nstand, oh, how many person they lost common sense? Sta -- it started to be\n[indecipherable] yes? You know, sitting like -- like -- like bird, you know, with the eye in\none spot, and he could sit in this way all day and night. You have to put him down to\nsleep. That, oh how many this person I saw. I don\u2019t know, this is like a -- I don\u2019t know\nwhy this happen. Why this particular illness, mental, and this is -- I saw it.",
        "A: Okay. Okay. Oh, I -- I have a very little photographs. I have a very little here.",

The other, close to them, there was a place where the Jewish women\nlived in the -- hard to say, like a vacation wooden houses, but very, very lousy, yes. And\nthey have to spend and live in this territory, winter, and the very bad weather. Then they\nwere transfer at the end, so say maybe October, yes, into this building, you see this recba\n-- red -- red brick buildings on the left side. And I visited this building when I met the last\nsick woman in the basement, or in some room that was totally dark.
